2015-2018 Country Partnership Strategy for the Kingdom of Swaziland 

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The primary development challenge for the Kingdom of Swaziland is to address the high 
rate of poverty and inequality in the country. An estimated 63 per cent of the population lives 
below the poverty line and inequality is very high with a Gini coefficient of 49.5. Between 
2001/02 and 2009/10 consumption of the bottom 40 per cent of the population grew very slowly. 
Poverty is strongly correlated with unemployment, which is about 28.5 percent overall and 52.4 
percent among the youth. Poverty is also associated with the high burden of communicable 
diseases. The HIV/AIDS prevalence of 31 per cent of the population is the highest in the world 
and life expectancy has fallen to approximately 49 years. While the country has made significant 
progress towards achieving the MDGs, it is unlikely to reach the health related MDGs due to the 
high disease burden.  
To address poverty, the country has to overcome its low growth trap. During the 1980s, 
Swaziland grew at a rapid pace that exceeded the growth rate of other SADC member states. 
Growth slowed down in the 1990s, but remained positive at an average rate of around 3.7 
percent, and dropped further to an average rate of around 2.3 percent in the 2000s. Stimulating 
growth requires a multipronged effort aimed at addressing the HIV/AIDS and TB co-epidemic, 
managing external and domestic shocks better, promoting good governance and fiscal 
management, and strengthening the domestic investment climate in a way that will make 
Swaziland a destination of choice for investors.  
Growth will need to be supported by investments in human capital and an inclusive social 
safety net system to address the poverty challenge. The country faces a unique opportunity to 
capitalize on the demographic dividend; improvements in containing the health epidemic can 
propel more young people into the labor force. For the country to utilize this growth potential, 
adequate investments have to be made in education and skills development. This would also 
require adequately supporting the poor and the vulnerable, in a manner consistent with fiscal 
affordability. To seize these opportunities, consistent implementation of existing policies and a 
transformative development program is required in order to put Swaziland on a high growth and 
development trajectory.  
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2015-2018 recognizes country specific 
constraints, as well as client demand for World Bank Group (WBG) support in selected 
developmental areas, which are consistent with the World Bank Group’s strategic goals of 
reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable way. The new 
CPS will prioritize two program pillars: (i) Promoting growth and job creation -  This pillar will 
support Government create an enabling environment for private sector investment and 
competitiveness, MSME growth and job creation with a strong focus on the agribusiness and 
tourism sectors;  and  (ii) Strengthening state capabilities to design implement and monitor 
policies to reduce poverty and inequality -  The World Bank Group will under this pillar provide 
support in the areas of governance, economic management and social services delivery. The CPS 
seeks to mitigate governance and implementation risks through interventions directly affecting 
service delivery to citizens such as health, local government capacity, public sector efficiency, 
and job creation as well as promoting advocacy and partnerships.

II. INTRODUCTION  
This document presents the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) with the Kingdom of Swaziland for 2015-18. The goal of the CPS is to support the 
country’s efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, and to promote shared prosperity in a 
sustainable way. The CPS is aligned with the National Development Strategy (NDS) and its 
priorities for maintaining macro-economic stability, investing in strategic infrastructure and 
human capital to unlock new growth opportunities. This CPS builds on the results achieved 
under the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) 2008-2010, including the currently active programs 
initiated under the ISN. After its expiration in 2010, the ISN continued to frame the World Bank 
engagement in local administration and health, including the approval of two lending operations, 
and carrying out analytical work and providing intensive implementation support between 2010 
and 2014.

III. COUNTRY BACKGROUND 
Swaziland is a landlocked, small open economy in Southern Africa. It has a land area 
of 17,364 km2 and a population of 1.2 million. The country is largely mountainous with 75.8% of 
the population living in rural areas. It borders Mozambique and South Africa: the nearest ports 
are Maputo, which is 149 km away, and Durban, about 541 km away. With a Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) per capita of about US$3,500, Swaziland is classified as a lower middle income 
country 1. 
Swaziland is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) with South Africa, 
Lesotho, and Namibia, and the domestic currency –the Lilangeni— is pegged at parity with 
the South African rand, which is also a legal tender of the economy. On the one hand, the 
CMA has helped integrate Swaziland closely with South Africa: it has provided a nominal 
anchor to monetary policy and has facilitated capital and commercial transactions with South 
Africa, Swaziland’s major trading partner. On the other hand, the scope to use monetary and 
exchange rate policy instruments is limited by the CMA membership. Close commercial ties 
with South Africa and the peg of the Lilangeni to the Rand have been instrumental to anchor 
inflation expectations, with Swaziland’s inflation somewhat following South Africa’s inflation.

4. 

The country defines itself as a “monarchical democracy”, where both parliamentary 
and traditional systems of governance run concurrently. Swaziland has been independent 
since 1968. The King as Head of State holds supreme executive, legislative and judicial powers. 
He appoints the Prime Minister, 10 of the 76 members of the House of Assembly (the lower 
house of parliament) and 20 of the 31 members of the Senate. The most recent parliamentary 
elections were held in September 2013 and the Prime Minister was reappointed for another term. 
Labor unions and some segments of civil society continue to call for constitutional monarchy and 
legalizing all political parties in order to ensure greater accountability. 
Perceptions about lack of voice and accountability and weak rule of law hamper 
growth and development. The limitations on the rights to participate and form political parties

deprives the citizenry of political competition and electoral feedback to prioritize policy choices. 
The regular arrest of pro-democracy activists contributes to pushing Swaziland low on the 
political freedoms scale and high in the rankings for perceptions of corruption. Transparency 
International ranks Swaziland 82nd among 177 countries on its Corruption Perception Index. 
Swaziland also does not fare well in most categories of the institutions pillar of the Global 
Competitiveness Index. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) was reestablished in 2008 after 
the repeal of the Prevention of Corruption Order of 1993; and has brought some high-profile 
cases before the courts. It is, however, constrained by inadequate human and financial resources.  

IV. DEVELOPMENT DIAGNOSTIC 

Poverty and social protection 

6. 

Poverty and inequality are widespread with an estimated 63 percent of the 
population living below the poverty line and a Gini coefficient of 49.5 in 2010. About 29 
percent of the total population lives below the extreme poverty line. Poverty has fallen since 
early 2000s, with the poverty rate declining by just six percentage points to 63 percent in 
2009/10., when  some 641,000 persons remained below the national poverty line. As Table 1 
shows, both the depth and severity of poverty have also declined between 2000/01 and 2009/10. 
The change in the poverty headcount, however, was of a much smaller magnitude for the poorest 
segments of the population, as reflected by the 1.2 percentage point decline in the poverty 
headcount using the extreme poverty line for the same time period. Inequality declined slightly 
between 2000/01 and 2009/10, from a Gini coefficient of 51.2 to 49.5.  
Growth in Swaziland was not equally shared, not pro-poor and relatively low. The 
growth incidence analysis (Figure 1) shows that growth was regressive with the growth rate of 
the bottom 40 percent being significantly lower than that of the top 60th percentile. Thus, the 
consumption expenditure per capita for the bottom 40 percent remained unchanged between 
2000/01 and 2009/10 (i.e. zero annual compounded growth rate), much lower than the annual 
compounded growth rate of consumption per capita of Swazi households (0.4 percent). A Shared 
Prosperity index, expressed as the growth rate of the bottom 40% of the population, was zero 
percent per annum.

Poverty remains predominantly a rural phenomenon. 75.8 percent of the total 
population lived in rural areas in 2010, whereas 88 percent of those below the national poverty 
line lived in rural areas (Figure 2). The poverty headcount in urban areas was significantly lower 
(31.1 percent) than in rural areas (73.1 percent). Also between 2000/01 and 2009/10, the poverty 
headcount declined faster in urban than rural areas (12.4 percent compared to 8.3 percent 
respectively). Out of the four administrative regions, Shiselweni –the poorest region in 
2000/01—experienced the largest decline in the poverty (about 14 percentage points). 
Nevertheless, Shiselwini, along with Lumbombo, continue to be the two poorest regions, with a 
poverty of 68 and 69 percent, respectively. Hhohho and Manzini, at 61 and 58 percent, perform 
better than the national average.

In view of the widespread poverty, Government has made some progress to provide 
social protection. However, substantial numbers of poor and vulnerable people, 
particularly children, remain without coverage. While some elements of a comprehensive 
social protection system are in place, there is a need to improve targeting efficiency in order to 
reach the extremely poor. For example, the Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) Education 
Grant Program only reaches about 40 percent of children in the poorest quintiles. The Old Age 
Grants (OAG), the largest transfer program in terms of total budget, was introduced in 2005 to 
cushion the impact on the elderly of the loss of support resulting from the deaths of their adult 
children and the increasing burden of caring for orphaned grandchildren. Qualitative evidence 
suggests that the OAG has had a positive impact on beneficiaries’ lives but has not contributed 
much in terms of reducing poverty because a significant share of OAG resources go to non-poor 
households, reflecting limitations in targeting. The country does not currently have a national 
cash transfer program for extremely poor households with children.  

10. 

The current system consists of multiple cash and in-kind transfers, social care 
services, active labor market programs, and community-based programs implemented by 
at least five ministries or departments within ministries. A number of policy documents that 
cover some aspects of social protection are in place, however these programs do not form a 
coherent whole, and some aspects of poverty and vulnerability are not addressed. Table 2 lists 
the multiple programs that currently make up Swaziland’s safety net. The country needs a 
comprehensive social safety net strategy with clear 
implementation and coordination 
mechanisms.

Good progress has been made towards achieving some of the human development 
MDGs; however, health related MDGs are not likely to be reached by 2015. The country is 
likely to reach universal access and eliminate gender disparities in education. Also net primary 
enrolment ratio improved from 72 percent in 2002 to 92 percent in 2010. Primary education 
completion rate is about 77 percent (girls’ slightly higher than boys). The gross enrollment rate 
for secondary schools is about 60 percent. HIV/AIDS has stabilized but at a high of 31 percent 
prevalence rate. Maternal mortality rate stands at 320/100,000 live births and under five 
mortality rate at 80/1,000 live births. The country battles with the highest estimated TB incidence 
rate of 1,320/1,000,000. While much progress has been recorded, the current state of these 
indicators suggests that health MDGs will not be reached by 2015.

Stunting or shortness for age is a major nutrition challenge facing the country. 
About 31 percent of Swazi children below the age of five are stunted (Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Survey 2010). The 2013 Cost of Hunger in Africa study suggests that the economy loses up to 
3.1 percent of its GDP annually associated to chronic under nutrition – through higher costs in 
healthcare, lower educational achievement and lost productivity in manual and non-manual 
workforces. Continued commitment to addressing child nutrition can prevent these losses in the 
future. UN agencies and other partners are supporting government respond to this challenge 
through a multi-sectoral intervention program.  

13. 

The country has made strides in adopting institutional and policy arrangements for 
gender equality; however progress has been slow and undermined by slow policy 
implementation. The 2014 Human Development Report ranks Swaziland 115 out of 148 
countries on the gender inequality index. Women hold only 6 percent of the Parliamentary seats 
against a target of 30 percent; 50 percent of adult women have reached a secondary or higher 
level of education compared to 46.1 percent of their male counterparts. Female labor 
participation was 55.2 percent compared to 58.2 percent for males in 2010. Some recent 
progressive steps include locating of the Gender and Families Unit in the Deputy Prime 
Minister’s Office, the approval of the National Gender policy, and the ratification of the SADC 
protocol on Gender and Development. However, these advancements are countered by persistent 
patriarchal practices enshrined in a number of legal instruments. 2 

Growth performance 

14. 

Given the widespread poverty, improving economic performance remains a 
necessary condition to make significant progress towards reducing poverty and inequality. 
Swaziland’s economic growth rate has slowed considerably over the past three decades. 
Annual GDP growth averaged 6.3 percent in the 1980s, a period in which the country was 
favored by the tightening of sanctions against apartheid. This led to a surge and relocation of 
investments into Swaziland. Growth slowed in the 1990s, reflecting a variety of influences, 
including the HIV/AIDS epidemics, the ending of economic sanctions against South Africa, 
heightened competition from neighboring countries in attracting investment and slow 
implementation of reforms. Growth moderated to an average of around 3.7 percent in the 1990s 
and further dropped to just 2.3 percent over the 2000s (Figure 3). Proximate causes of the growth 
slowdown can be traced to lagging performance of exports and investment. 
15. While agriculture’s share in total gross value added has declined over time to about 
9 percent of GDP, agricultural development remains crucial for development. Over 75 
percent of the total population still lived in rural areas in 2010, hence the importance of the 
sector for both inclusive growth and rapid poverty reduction. Agriculture also remains important 
as a source of exports and as a supplier of inputs to the manufacturing sector. Agricultural sector 
performance, however, has been severely affected by chronic underinvestment accentuated by 
recurring droughts and the impact of HIV/AIDS.

16. Manufacturing activity is relatively broad, but concentrated around two main 
sectors: food processing (including Coca-Cola concentrate) and textiles and apparel. 
Manufacturing sector development benefited in the past from the tightening of economic 
sanctions against apartheid, which led to a surge in investments by South African and 
international firms, including the relocation of the Coca-Cola concentrate plant from Durban in 
1986. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, spurred by Africa Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA), 
Swaziland also developed a large textile and apparel sector. However, the expiry of quotas in 
international trade in textiles and clothing since 2005 and increased competition from large 
Asian producers have had a significantly adverse impact on the sector, which declined in 
importance relative to the overall economy. Services accounted for about 45 percent of total

GDP.  Within the tertiary sector, public administration represented the largest single component, 
accounting for about 30 percent of total gross value added in the 2000s. 3 
International trade has long been an important driver of the economy. For a small 
open economy, export development is essential to growth prospects. Swaziland’s distribution of 
export goods is dominated by foodstuffs and chemicals (mainly Coca-Cola concentrate), which 
together account for two-thirds of all exports. Textiles and clothing constitute the third largest 
sector. In terms of the market, Swaziland is very closely linked to South Africa, which accounts 
for about 85 percent of imports and about 60 percent of exports. 4 The European Union is the 
second largest export market for Swaziland. While the country was able to use trade effectively 
to generate growth in the past, export performance has weakened in recent years. Looking ahead, 
Swaziland faces considerable vulnerabilities in its existing export base. A significant portion of 
current exports is dependent on trade preferences, including sugar (under the EU Sugar Regime) 
and apparel (under AGOA). The former is scheduled to expire in the near term. For the latter, 
Swaziland did not meet the conditions for the extension of AGOA set for May 15, 2014, and as a 
result preferences are set to expire by January 2015. This is expected to have a negative impact 
on exports and jobs, given that about one-third of total apparel exports are destined to the US 
market. On the labor market, the adverse impact will be felt particularly negatively among 
women. Uncertainty originating from AGOA may lead to a significant contraction in the sector. 
However, the overall impact on growth and employment is likely to be dampened by a 
reallocation of production towards regional markets.  

18. 

Higher rates of investment are also required to achieve higher growth rates and 
increase export capacity, but investment has come down sharply, largely driven by falling 
private investment. Gross investment in the private sector fell from an average of around 14.2 
percent in the 1980s to just 9 percent in the 2000s. Over the past two decades average investment 
levels have been lower than in all other regional comparators and fast growing small states. The 
decline that started in the mid-1990s coincided with the ending of economic sanctions against 
South Africa and the progressive opening up of the low labor cost economy of Mozambique. 
Across Africa too, countries reduced political strife and undertook reforms that improved 
macroeconomic stability, governance and the investment climate. These have magnified the 
competition that Swaziland faces in attracting investment. Swaziland’s inability to attract 
investment into the economy also limits the potential growth of the country and underscores the 
need to address key structural weaknesses in the economy.

Labor market outcomes 
Low growth rates have not helped reduce the high levels of unemployment 
prevailing in the country. Unemployment is high, at 28.5 percent, and once discouraged 
workers are accounted for, the unemployment rate rises to 40.7%. The most recent labor 
force survey (2010) suggests that labor market outcomes have not improved between 2007 and 
2010. Although surveys are outdated and conducted infrequently, available labor market 
indicators suggest that unemployment has been high and persistent, and labor force participation 
has fallen over time (Figure 6). Given the persistent and structural characteristics of 
unemployment, employment to working age population ratio may represent a better metric of the 
labor market situation. This indicator also deteriorated between 2007 and 2010, and less than 3.4 
persons out of ten were employed in 2010. The country’s employment to working age population 
ratio is well below the median and average for Sub-Saharan African countries, lower middle 
income countries, and developing countries. 
Youth, women, and the least educated have been particularly affected by 
unemployment spells. Unemployment is high among the youth (aged 15 - 24), at 52.4 percent. 
Female unemployment stood at 46.3 percent, compared to 34.4 percent for males in 2010. Only 
three females out of ten were employed in 2010. Survey results also suggest that unemployment 
has also been concentrated among the least educated segments of the workforce. About 80 
percent of the unemployed or underemployed have been in that situation for over a year, 
suggesting that unemployment is structural rather than cyclical. 

20. 

21. 

The public sector is one of the largest employers in the country, with about 42,000 
employees (or 22 percent of total employment, according to the Labor Force Survey of 
2010). The private sector employed about 42 percent, followed by the informal sector (about 33 
percent). In 2010, relatively more females were employed in the informal sector (59 percent), 
whereas relatively more males where employed in the private sector (62 percent).

Poverty continues to be exacerbated by the high prevailing levels of unemployment. 
Faster, more inclusive and sustained growth, supported by skills development and private 
investment can lift the country away from the circle of high poverty-inequality-unemployment. 
This is even more relevant as the country is expected to undergo a demographic transition over 
the next two decades, which will place further pressure on labor markets. The proportion of 
people in the working age population will continue to increase and the dependency ratio will fall. 
Projections suggest that, over the next two decades, the working age population (15-64) is 
expected to increase by 30.6 percent between 2015 and 2035, with the dependency ratio 
declining from 66.3% in 2015 to 50.9% in 2035. The growth implications of this demographic 
transition will depend critically on whether job opportunities grow fast enough to absorb the 
additional number of people entering the labor force. If managed well including through 
investments in skills development and job creation, this transition has the potential to propel 
growth higher (see also para 45 on p. 16).  

Constraints to achieving growth and the twin goals 

23. 

Human capital and disease burden  
The burden of disease has been a major contributor to the persistence of high of 
poverty and inequality rates and a major obstacle to broad based growth. The economic 
cost of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been enormous. An estimated 31 percent in ages 18-49 are 
HIV-positive and life expectancy has fallen to about 49 years. 5 Of growing concern has been the 
spread of tuberculosis (TB), which takes deadly form when people are already immune-
compromised from HIV. The spread of TB is in large part due to migrant Swazi workers in 
South African mines. Early deaths due to preventable diseases have translated into great human 
capital and output loss. With a life expectancy of 49, Swaziland has lost remarkably on the 
productive years of the economic active population due to early deaths. 6

24. 

The HIV/AIDS epidemic has dramatically affected the human capital formation and 
its negative impacts will continue over the medium to long term, keeping the country below 
its income group in the human development rankings. Swaziland ranks 141st out of 187 on the 
UNDP Human Development Index. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has resulted to a significant loss of 
human capital and a steep decline in life expectancy. Yet another outcome has been the 
proliferation of single-headed households and child-headed households –many times by children 
who have lost both parents to the disease. 

25. 

The magnitude of financing the national response to HIV/AIDS represents a 
challenge from a fiscal perspective. Costs related to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatments are 
substantial and are expected to remain high in the medium- to long-run. Swaziland already 
finances 40% of its own HIV response, hence the need to select cost-effective interventions that 
can be implemented most efficiently. An evaluation of the financial and fiscal impact of the 
extended National Strategic Framework (eNSF) for HIV/AIDS 2014-2016 has to take into 
account the change in spending commitments implied by both the improved access to 
HIV/AIDS-related services and the reduced number of HIV infections achieved under its 
implementation. Provided that the decline in the number of HIV infections outweighs the 
increase in the immediate costs caused by each HIV infection, the eNSF would then reduce the 
fiscal and financial burden committed by the national HIV/AIDS response. 7  

26. 

The loss of human capital has deepened poverty and lowered the growth rates of the 
country. The high cost of treatment and the loss of family income have been catastrophic for 
many families, pushing them into poverty. The time loss due to illness, absenteeism and 
shrinkage of the labour force has had an adverse impact on firms. Other adverse consequences 
include changes in saving, investment and production decisions at the individual and household 
level, the negative effect on school enrolment and attendance, and changes in household 
formation dynamics.  

27. 

Macroeconomic uncertainty 
 A weak institutional framework and perceptions of policy uncertainty, both related 
to macroeconomic policies and the regulatory environment, and human capital weaknesses 
currently represent some of the most pressing constraints to investment and growth. 
International evidence suggests that macroeconomic stability and prudent fiscal management are 
essential building blocks to attract investment and achieve higher, sustained economic growth. 
The fiscal crisis of 2010-11 brought to the fore the importance of following prudent fiscal 
policies and minimize the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty in the real economy. With the 
collapse of SACU transfers from about 20 percent of GDP in FY09/10 to below 10 percent in the 
following two fiscal years, fiscal balances deteriorated sharply and acute fiscal difficulties 
followed: the level of reserves to sustain the peg with the Rand fell below acceptable levels, the 
government ran arrears with the private sector and cut capital outlays and deferred other 
expenditures including on essentials such as those for combating HIV/AIDS, education, and 
social grants to vulnerable groups.

28. Many of the fiscal challenges arise from the country’s dependence on SACU 
transfers, which are volatile. Whereas the immediate catalyst of the fiscal crisis were the 
significant declines in SACU transfers in 2010 and 2011, government’s pro-cyclical spending 
patterns have contributed to transfer the volatility of SACU receipts to public spending, and 
ultimately to the real economy. SACU transfers, which derive from customs duties and excise 
tax collections, represent over half of the government’s total revenue collections. Following an 
output contraction of 0.7 percent in 2011, the recovery in SACU transfers –together with enacted 
revenue-side measures such as the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) regime and tax 
administration strengthening— have contributed to restore confidence in the economy and the 
peg.  

29. 

Fiscal sustainability, however, remains vulnerable in the medium-term as the 
elevated level of government expenditures and high dependence on SACU receipts remain 
to be addressed. Recurrent outlays continue to represent the vast majority of total expenditures, 
leaving little room for productivity-enhancing expenditures. Better macroeconomic and fiscal 
management can help stabilize output, minimize pro-cyclical measures and overall reduce boom-
bust cycles. Improving SACU transfers management, therefore, can reduce macroeconomic risks 
and uncertainty, generate fiscal space for growth enhancing investment and contribute towards 
attracting more investment into the country. 
One of the lessons learnt from the recent fiscal crisis was the importance of enacting 
prudent fiscal policies, reduce the dependence on SACU transfers and mitigate their 
volatility. Swaziland has made significant improvements in their fiscal accounts following the 
2010-11 crises, when the government accumulated arrears amounting to several percentage 
points of GDP and international reserves fell to about 2.3 months of imports. Since then, the 
government has cleared accumulated arrears and international reserves have recovered to about 4 
months of imports. Economic and financial indicators also suggests that business is somewhat 
improving. The government enacted revenue side measures such as the introduction of a VAT 
regime and tax administration strengthening, which resulted in improved revenue collections. On 
the expenditure side, a partial wage and hiring freeze has moderated the growth of recurrent 
expenditures and an ongoing payroll audit might serve as a key cornerstone for a public sector 
reform.  
The recently-released Government Programme of Action 2013-2018 also emphasizes 
the importance of fiscal prudence. The document highlights the need to build adequate buffers 
in good times to mitigate the impact of SACU revenue volatility and a potential decline in the 
medium-term. The document also calls for increasing the share of domestic revenues in total 
revenue collection, and controlling the public wage bill.

Regulatory environment and institutional framework 

32. 

To attract more investment and propel growth higher, Swaziland also needs to 
provide a business environment that is more conducive to private sector development, 
improve transparency in regulatory systems and provide clarity on government policies 
and implementation. This can contribute towards reducing uncertainty at the firm level. In that 
spirit, the government has already adopted several strategies and policies to attract investment 
and foster private sector activity, such as Private Sector Development Strategy (PSDS), Investor 
Road Map (IRM) and Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS). These strategies, largely consistent 
with each other, have however been subject to slow implementation. Stronger commitment and 
leadership is required to accelerate the pace of implementation of agreed policies and to boost 
investor confidence. 
33. While 
the country has shown some 
improvements 
in both 
the Global 
Competitiveness Report 8 and the Doing Business Indicators, Swaziland continues to be 
ranked lower than what its level of economic development would suggest. The country is 
ranked 123rd out of 144 countries in the Global Competitiveness Index of 2014-15. Inefficient 
government bureaucracy, perceptions of corruption and access to financing were often cited 
among the top five most problematic factors for doing business in the country. The Doing 
Business Report (2015) ranks Swaziland 110th out of 189 countries in the overall ease of doing 
business. The country shows subpar performance and ranking in several areas, particularly in 
enforcing contracts (173rd), starting a business (145th), and getting electricity (140th). A 
comparison across several of the Doing Business indicators between 2006 and 2015 also 
suggests that the country has made some (absolute) improvements in several indicators over 
time. However, the overall pace of progress has been slower than in Sub-Saharan Africa and 
other countries in general, resulting in a stagnation in Swaziland’s relative ranking vis-à-vis the 
rest of the world. 
Direct intervention by the state in economic sectors also seems to be a deterrent. The 
state is invested in key economic sectors through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the 
company owned by the royal family – Tibiyo Taka Ngwane. These institutions operate in 
multiple economic sectors including agriculture, transport, finance, tourism and housing, which 
put them in direct competition with private players, creating conflicts of interest in several 
sectors. Furthermore, some SOEs function as regulators in their sectors, and are responsible for 
charging levies on imports by private enterprises of products that they themselves are selling. 
This creates another set of conflicts of interest and potential opportunities for corruption. The 
overall result is further uncertainty among investors. 

34. 

Investment in agriculture and land productivity 

35. 

Promoting investment in agriculture remains essential to accelerate growth and 
reduce widespread poverty, especially in rural areas. The country has a dual system of land 
management covering two main types of land: Title Deed Land (TDL) and Swazi Nation Land 
(SNL). Production on SNL is primarily for subsistence. Farming techniques are usually 

8 World Competitiveness Report 2013-2014”, Klaus Scwab (Ed), World Economic Forum, 2013 

13 

  
 
 
 
                                                      
traditional, employing predominantly family labor. Commercial agricultural production in 
Swaziland, on the other hand, is carried out mainly in TDL, and remains dominated by sugar and 
sugar-related products for export under preferences to regional and global markets. Production 
techniques on most of the farms in TDL are large scale and capital intensive, using modern 
inputs and mechanization.  

36. 

37. 

Several factors prevent a more efficient use of land and greater investment in 
agriculture: (i) Lack of clarity and documentation for SNL smallholders: This increases 
insecurity among smallholders, reduces their ability to negotiate more effective uses of their land 
through renting or leasing, and reduces their incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing 
technology; (ii) Limited access to credit, fragmentation, and coordination problems in factor and 
products markets for SNL smallholders: This affects the viability of commercially-oriented 
agriculture, with SNL households often having to produce crops under rain-fed conditions, 
perpetuating poverty traps with low-technology, low-yield crop varieties; (iii) The legal 
framework governing commercial investors’ access to land is unclear: better enforcement and 
dispute resolution mechanisms as well as a clear legal context can also help attract higher and 
more sustained levels of investment in commercial agriculture; (iv) Government land holds 
potential to attract private sector investment, but several factors limit access. Large areas are 
occupied by informal settlements and many of these farms are run down because of long periods 
of disuse and underinvestment; and (v) Enhanced coordination across bodies that govern land 
management and administration is needed. The current system is fragmented and involves three 
key ministries that drive land policy and look after land management and administration. This is 
apart from the traditional structures that manage SNL. Significant overlaps exist between the 
mandates of these bodies, but coordination is often lacking.  
Although the Ministry of Agriculture provides support to smallholders and to the 
agribusiness sector, it lacks resources and capacity. Through its extension officers and 
parastatal organizations, the Ministry provides some support to smallholders. For example, the 
parastatal National Agricultural Marketing Board (NAMBoard) regulates imports and exports of 
agricultural commodities, provides specialized extension services in horticulture, and operates 
facilities designed to facilitate certain agribusiness, including a whole a wholesale market, a 
poultry abattoir and a banana ripening facility. Additional support from the Ministry includes: i) 
training farmers on production standards and basic agribusiness concepts, including business 
management, marketing and pricing; and ii) building basic infrastructure, such as earth dams to 
provide water for irrigation purposes. However, the Ministry lacks the resources and capacity to 
provide the support necessary to transform the sector. 
 The Ministry is planning to work closely with other development partners on 
demand-side constraints, including the lack of linkages to formal markets. Specifically, a new 
European Union-funded High Value Crop and Horticulture Project plans to support horticulture 
value chains by strengthening linkages to markets, production planning, production, packing and 
collection of products. This new project will work through the Swaziland Water and Agricultural 
Development Enterprise (SWADE) and NAMBoard. In addition, the Government is in the 
process of negotiating a new project with the International Fund for Agricultural Development 
(IFAD.)  
Swaziland has been experimenting with new and innovative approaches on SNL. 
One such initiative is Swaziland Water and Agricultural Development Enterprise (SWADE)’s 
farming company, which allows smallholders on tracts of SNL to coordinate and engage in 

38. 

39.

commercial scale production. This scheme appears to be working well with a positive impact on 
the productivity of land and smallholder family incomes. Essentially these models work because 
they solve the problem of coordinating small farmers by: (i) Alleviating the fragmentation 
present in SNL and concentrating production in contiguous areas; (ii) Reducing banks’ exposure 
to risk through the presence of an established market (the case of sugar cane), thus easing 
financing constraints; (iii) Clarifying rights through written documentation in the form of a 
Letter of Intent, signed by the Chief. Efforts to support these approaches also require addressing 
infrastructure constraints in rural areas and promoting an integrated rural and agricultural 
development program that could help improve rural livelihoods. 

40. 

The country is vulnerable to extreme events, including floods, droughts and wild 
fires. Mitigation and adaptation measures are important given the strong role of the agriculture 
sector and the large share of the population that lives in rural areas that still relies on subsistence 
agriculture. Swazi households face significant risks of shocks to which the poor are typically the 
most vulnerable. These include seasonal unpredictability of food availability, droughts, floods, 
and sickness and death of working household members. Figure 7 presents a list of extreme events 
that affected the country in the past 30 years.

Infrastructure Development  
Swaziland has relatively well-developed infrastructure in comparison to other Sub-
Saharan African countries, but there are a number of critical areas that require further 
improvement, especially for poor rural communities which can contribute to making 
growth more inclusive. In terms of water and sanitation, approximately 280,000 people lack 
access to potable water supply, while 430,000 – nearly 40 percent of the population – lack access 
to basic sanitation 9. Addressing issues of basic water supply and sanitation, especially in rural 
areas and small towns, is clearly a poverty reduction priority for the country. Though 
Swaziland’s National Development Strategy establishes a goal of universal access to safe water 
supply, sanitation, and solid waste management by 2015, the country lags far behind this 
ambitious goal.

42. 

Access to energy through the national grid also demonstrates a significant 
urban/rural divide – only 45 percent of the total population has access to the distribution 
network, and in rural areas access is less than 10 percent. 10 Energy use amounts to roughly 902 
kWh/capita, less than 25 percent of neighboring South Africa’s use. Rural populations rely on a 
mix of kerosene, wood, and paraffin for basic heating, and there is a significant opportunity to 
improve rural access through renewable resources (e.g. solar PV systems) which are approaching 
traditional energy in terms of cost effectiveness. Swaziland has a relatively well developed road 
network with over 3,000 km of roads, of which approximately 33 percent are paved. While the 
basic infrastructure is relatively in good condition, the absence of an infrastructure development 
plan constrains the proper prioritization of projects that would help bridge the rural / urban 
divide. Rural infrastructure development is critical to facilitate easy access to services for poor 
communities, and access to markets for the rural Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs).  

V. SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
WBG ENGAGEMENT 

43. 

To support the Government goal to reach a ‘first world status by 2022’ and address 
the challenges of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the country 
has to stimulate growth, improve capacity of the state to implement policies and deliver 
services to the poor. The World Bank Group can support the country’s development efforts by 
collaborating with Government and other institutions to strengthen business environment and 
promote competitiveness, improve economic management and service delivery, and developing 
human capital.  

44. 

Business Environment and Competitiveness. To achieve its ambitious goal, the country 
needs to promote private sector growth and competitiveness by facilitating the ease of doing 
business and creating an enabling environment for job creation, investment and growth. 
Swaziland needs to take full advantage of every available growth opportunity ‒ the large South 
African market, connectivity to ports in neighboring countries, and abundant sources of water 
and untapped agricultural potential. The World Bank Group can assist the country in selected 
sectors with lowering the costs of investing and running a business, better integration of MSMEs 
firms into local and regional market chains, lowering logistical and customs costs to facilitate 
cross-border trade. 

45. 

Skills Development. Swaziland’s working age population growth will be outpacing its 
total population growth, which would lead to increased expectations for job creation, especially 
productive jobs. The present low firms-level productivity is attributed largely to relatively low 
level of education and skills of the workforce, insufficient training, and limited capability of 
technology transfer in production. While enrolment ratios have improved, continued investments 
to improve the quality of basic, secondary, tertiary and vocational education are required to 
prepare youth for entry into the labor market. The World Bank Group can support the 
government effort in job creation and productivity growth by improving the quality, efficiency 
and coverage of skills development programs, particularly targeting the youth (the 15-24 age 
group).

46. 

Economic management capacity limitations undermine macroeconomic stability and 
allocation of resources for priority growth and development initiatives. The Bank can assist the 
Government to address the challenges of public financial management (PFM) performance-
management, public investment program, monitoring and evaluation, strengthening civil service 
management, SOE monitoring and building capacity at local government level by providing 
investments, technical assistance as well as analytical and advisory services.  

47. 

Social services delivery remains critical to reduce poverty especially amongst the bottom 
40 per cent of the population. Further investments in quality health care are necessary to improve 
life expectancy, and reduce the adverse socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS and TB. A 
comprehensive social protection system is necessary to improve poverty monitoring, consolidate 
the social protection programs and protect vulnerable households from adverse idiosyncratic and 
economy-wide shocks.  

48. 

For the country to achieve its development objectives it needs a robust set of social 
and economic data to assess and monitor progress deepening of a culture of evidence based 
analysis, policy formulation and implementation. The national accounts have not been compiled 
by the statistics office for several years and the government relies upon the economic data from 
the Central Bank. A well-designed national accounts system as well as poverty monitoring and 
analysis system, will require capacity building on both the supply and demand side of data. The 
Bank can support capacity building of institutions such as the Central Statistics Office (CSO), 
and administrative units in sector ministries and local governments.  

VI. GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 

49. 

The National Development Strategy (NDS): Vision 2022 of 1997 articulates the 
country’s development vision: “By the Year 2022, the Kingdom of Swaziland will be in the top 
10% of the medium human development group of countries founded on sustainable economic 
development, social justice and political stability.” NDS implementation has been slow and was 
negatively affected by the fiscal crisis of 2010-11. The document is currently under review, and 
Government has identified three ongoing priorities: (i) maintaining macro-economic stability and 
accelerate economic diversification;, (ii) boosting strategic infrastructure; and (iii) unlocking 
human capacity.  

50. 

In 2007 the Cabinet approved Swaziland’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy and 
Action Plan (PRSAP) to implement the NDS; the main challenge remains implementation 
capacity. The PRSAP acknowledged that while the country had seen notable growth since 
independence, “the benefits did not trickle down equitably to the whole population, thus 
widening inequalities”. The urban-rural and regional imbalances were noted, with Shiselweni 
and Lubombo identified as the two poorest regions. The document stressed the vulnerability of 
the poor to HIV/AIDS, natural disasters, economic shocks and food insecurity. The overall goal 
of the PRSAP was to reduce poverty to 30% by 2015, and to absolutely eradicate it by 2022. 
Based on progress so far, it is evident that this overall goal cannot be practically achieved within 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the initially set time frames. Both the PRSAP and NDP recognize the challenges facing the 
country, but unfortunately lack prioritization. For example, all strategic objectives under the six 
pillars of the PRSAP 11 currently appear to have the same level of importance and urgency. This 
is all the more regrettable, as prioritization was one of the explicit goals of the PRSAP vis-à-vis 
the broad NDS. The implementation of the NDS has been met with a number of challenges 
including limited state capacity to implement programs, absence of a monitoring, evaluation and 
reporting system.  

51. 

Since the launch of the PRSAP, the central Government has articulated its 
development vision in a series of sectoral documents in response to the fiscal crisis of 2010-
12. The 2010 Fiscal Adjustment Roadmap (FAR) and the 2012 Updated Fiscal Adjustment 
Roadmap (UFAR) emphasized macroeconomic stability, both through improving public 
financial management and the investment climate in order to stimulate private sector growth. 
Both, the FAR and UFAR placed great emphasis on reducing the size of the large public sector 
wage bill. A cornerstone of the UFAR, in particular, was the Enhanced Voluntary Early 
Retirement Scheme (EVERS). While some of the reforms identified in the UFAR have been 
achieved, those concerning the wage bill are yet to be implemented.  

52. 

In 2011, Government issued a comprehensive Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS), 
identifying ten priority areas for stimulating economic growth. These include tourism, 
agriculture, financial services, information, communications and technology. It also identifies 
cross-sectoral reform priorities such as the fiscal reform, FDI, domestic investment, human 
capital development, infrastructure, and trade. These sectoral reform priorities are expected to 
help Swaziland achieve an annual economic growth rate of at least 5 percent and the creation of 
30,000 new jobs. The development of the ERS included extensive consultations. The 
Implementation Committee was required to report on the progress to Cabinet weekly. Despite the 
pressure put on the Committee to show quick results, underfunding and capacity constraints 
hampered its ability to facilitate and achieve quick wins.  

53. 

The Swaziland Investor Promotion Authority (SIPA) re-launched the IRM in 2012, 
with the goal of spurring reforms to improve Swaziland’s investment climate. At the re-
launch event, His Majesty announced a new goal for Swaziland to be ranked within the top fifty 
countries in the Doing Business rankings within two years. With efforts from SIPA, some 
reforms have been implemented, but Swaziland’s ranking in the 2014 Doing Business report 
remained at 123 (out of 189 economies).  

54. 

 Strategic plans were prepared by central and line ministries with limited 
implementation success. The Ministry of Finance prepared a Public Financial Management 
Reform Bill scheduled for review by Parliament in mid-2014. While the bill is not a strategy 
document per se, it articulates very clearly the ministry’s vision for improving PFM. The 
National Health Sector Strategic Plan (NHSSP) was completed in 2008, and the Ministry of 

11 The six pillars of the PRSAP are: i) Human capital development; ii) Macro-economic stability and accelerated 
growth based on broad participation; iii) Empowering the poor to generate income and reduce inequalities; iv) 
Fair distribution of the benefits of growth through fiscal policy; v) Improving the quality of life of the poor; and 
Improving governance and strengthening institutions.

Health undertook a review of the Plan in 2013. The Ministry of Education and Training issued 
several strategy documents, including the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2010-2022 (November 
2010), and the National Education and Training Improvement Plan (NETIP) in 2013.  

55. 

Government has published its Programme of Action (2013-2018). It reaffirms His 
Majesty’s vision 2022, and provides the following definition: “A first world country is one 
where all citizens are able to sustainably pursue their life goals, and enjoy lives of value and 
dignity in a safe and secure environment. This implies equitable access to sufficient resources, 
education, health, food security and quality infrastructure and services, as well as good 
governance.” To measure progress towards Vision 2022, the Government has recently defined 
the Swaziland Development Index (SDI), a composite index with eight focus areas: (i) economic 
prosperity, (ii) agriculture & environmental sustainability, (iii) education, (iv) health, (v) 
government service delivery, (vi) infrastructure, (vii) governance, and viii) corruption. The index 
will be used to assess the country’s overall status, but also to set performance targets and action 
plans for ministries and agencies up to 2022. Prior to initiation of the SDI process, there has been 
no Government wide system of tracking development results.  

56. 

These overlapping policy statements, strategy documents, and action plans require 
prioritization and commitment. Government has to harmonize policy instruments and 
prioritize implementation of the most urgent ones that can have immediate impact on poverty 
reduction. Other strategies, particularly the Programme of Action, have become more prominent 
than the NDS / PRSAP in guiding Government’s activities; this will need to be addressed during 
the NDS review.  

VII.  WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP 

Evolution of World Bank Group Program 

57. 

The World Bank Group’s partnership with the Government of Swaziland has a long 
history; however, the level of engagement has been uneven. Swaziland became a World Bank 
member in 1962. The last full World Bank Country Assistance Strategy was endorsed in 1994. 
Government did not borrow from the Bank during the period FY1996- FY2008, due to concerns 
about IBRD loan pricing. However, the Bank maintained regular policy dialogue through 
Economic and Sector Work and a variety of knowledge activities. The only active project at the 
time, the Swaziland Urban Development Project (SUDP), 12 served as a platform for continued 
dialogue. Since 1992, Swaziland has borrowed US$113 million for 2 IDA credits and 12 IBRD 
loans. IFC has invested US$47.78 million for eight projects. Swaziland has been a member of 
MIGA since 1990 with one currently active project– the Motraco-Mozambique Transmission 
Company S.A.R.L. - and a gross exposure of US$69.4 million. In 2008 the ISN was adopted to 
support areas of re-engagement. While no formal strategy was in place during 2010 – 2014, the 
Bank and the Government continued the implementation of projects initiated under the ISN.  

12 SUDP  with a total budget of US$ 29 million was approved by Board  in FY1995 and closed in FY2005 
with all project development objectives met.  

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
58. 

The ISN 2008-2010 supported government efforts in reducing poverty, fighting 
HIV/AIDS, improving governance, and increasing competitiveness. The three most recent 
projects under this program include:  

• The Health, HIV/AIDS and TB Project (US$41 million: GOS US$2m; IBRD US$20m; 
EU US$19m) is ongoing and aims to improve access to and quality of health services 
with a particular focus on primary health care, maternal health, HIV/AIDS and TB, and 
to increase social safety net access for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC). The 
project supports strengthening the capacity of the health sector, including governance, 
management, regulatory and supervisory functions. The project also supports renovation 
and equipping of health facilities; strengthening the referral and transport system; and 
increasing and improving nursing and midwifery services. Other support provided is to 
design and pilot a cash transfer scheme for OVC. 

• The Swaziland Local Government Project (SLGP) for US$26.9 million. Under this 
ongoing project the Bank provides technical assistance for strengthening the capacity of 
urban local governments and selected rural local governments (Tinkhundla) for 
improving financial management and local infrastructure.  

• The Maternal and Child Health Care Project, financed with a US$2.57 million grant 
from the Japan Social Development Fund, closed on February 5, 2014. The project aimed 
to improve essential maternal and child health services (MCH) for vulnerable populations 
at the community level, and was primarily implemented in the underserved region of 
Lubombo (69% of the population living below poverty line). Results achieved include 
updated Community Health Worker (CHW) curricula and distribution of manuals, 
training over 900 CHWs, provision of essential MCH commodities to Lubombo health 
facilities, rural youth outreach and integrated sexual reproductive health, HIV testing, and 
counseling services provided through a mobile clinic, secure health care waste pits 
constructed at community clinics, and training in health care waste management in 
targeted facilities.  

59. 

Increasing competitiveness is a strategic area where the Bank continues to provide 
assistance through a grant of US$586,000 for customs modernization and other non-
lending activities, working closely with the Swaziland Revenue Authority (SRA). The 
objective is to support improvements in trade facilitation performance by implementing key 
measures identified in the 2012 Time Release Study. Specific areas of Bank engagement include 
(i) Upgrading ICT systems to enable data exchanges between the SRA and the South African 
Revenue Service (SARS), (ii) development of an integrated Boarder Management Strategy; (iii) 
training and capacity building for staff and management.  

60. 

Implementation under the ISN (2008-2010) has been mixed. The current ongoing 
projects have experienced implementation delays and slow disbursement. To accelerate 
implementation, the health project team holds monthly reviews and discussions with project 
implementation units to address various implementation bottlenecks. In addition, a core team 
comprising senior officials from the World Bank, Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Ministry of 
Economic Planning and Development conducts periodic portfolio monitoring and resolves any 
problems project teams face. The Bank also conducts fiduciary workshops to strengthen financial 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
management and procurement capacities. These arrangements will be carried through to the new 
CPS in order to avoid implementation delays and other challenges experienced under the ISN.  

61. 

Lessons from the Interim Strategy Note and recent activities 
A major lesson from the Bank’s engagement with Swaziland under the ISN is the 
need for realism in setting up measurable program outcomes taking into account 
implementation capacity. Projected outcomes were overly optimistic and in some cases 
insufficiently linked to ISN activities. ISN outcome indicators were not monitored closely during 
implementation. The responsibility for monitoring such indicators needs to be clearly assigned at 
the beginning of the strategy period if a better performance is to be achieved.

Reengagement in a country takes time and is costly; it requires special investment in 
analytical and advisory services, as well as time to enable Bank staff to appreciate the specific 
country circumstances, and client to learn about Bank procedures. Limited appreciation of client 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
circumstances by the Bank and unfamiliarity with Bank procedure on the part of the client 
caused a number of delays in project preparation and approval.  

Proposed Partnership Strategy 

63. 

The primary goal of this CPS is to support the country’s efforts to reduce poverty 
and inequality, and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The Bank will 
intervene to help address two major challenges facing the country: slow policy implementation 
and low growth, through a two pillar approach of promoting growth and job creation as well as 
strengthening state capabilities. The two pillars are mutually reinforcing as improved growth 
will generate the much needed resources to reduce poverty and create jobs, strengthened state 
capabilities will enable government to implement policies, adequately manage its public 
investment program, create an enabling environment for MSME growth, and prioritize allocation 
of resources to poverty reduction initiatives.  

64. 

 The CPS 2015-18 selectivity framework presented in Figure 8 has been framed by 
the twin goals, prioritizing programs at the interface of development needs, client demand and 
World Bank Group (WBG) comparative advantage. At the interface of development needs and 
WBG comparative advantage with no client demand, the Bank will use analytical products to 
advocate for Government prioritization and generate demand for support. In cases where there 
are development needs and client demand with no Bank comparative advantage, other 
development partners will play a leading role. Noting that a majority of the bottom 40% of the 
population relies on agricultural activities for livelihoods, the Bank has prioritized support on 
skills development in the agribusiness in order to reach this segment of the population. The two-
pillar strategic approach of this CPS is also informed and aligned with the priorities of the NDS. 
Figure 9 presents the two mutually reinforcing strategic pillars.

 Promoting growth and job creation. For Swaziland to create jobs and reduce poverty and 
inequality, the country needs sustained economic growth. This requires enhancements in 
national competitiveness through improvements in the trade and regulatory environment, 
and support for skills development. In this area, the WBG will support a regulatory 
framework that fosters a competitive and resilient private sector and promote skills 
development through appropriate lending instruments, analytical and advisory services. 
Work to be done under this program will build on the growth diagnostic conducted in 
2013 to support Government in addressing barriers to growth and job creation. Various 
policy notes prepared by the Bank on agriculture and agribusiness will provide analytical 
underpinning for programs. This will complement Bank advisory services to the Ministry 
of Agriculture.  

 Strengthening state capabilities. As discussed above, capacity constraints within the civil 
service undermine 
implementation of policies, service delivery and adequate 
macroeconomic management. Human capabilities need to be enhanced for higher growth 
and poverty reduction. The CPS aims to help address these challenges through focused 
capacity building as well as investments in economic management and social services 
delivery. Bank interventions will build on ongoing projects as well as AAA.  

65. 

The WBG recognizes political and demand constraints in the implementation of this 
CPS. Priority will be placed on interventions directly affecting service delivery to citizens such 
as health, local government capacity, public sector efficiency and job creation.  

66. 

The new strategy period will provide a basis for the Systematic Country Diagnostic/ 
Country Partnership Framework (SCD / CPF) for FY19 and beyond. It thus serves a 
transition role between the Interim Strategy Note (2008-2010) and the Country Partnership 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Framework to commence in 2019. An SCD is programmed for FY 17 which will provide a 
comprehensive development diagnostic drawing from CPS implementation.  

67. 

The CPS 2015-18 will build on ongoing and recently completed AAA, including the 
Growth Report, the Review of Social Safety Net Program and the Rapid Assessment of 
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). The Growth report is the first 
systematic analysis of the major constraints to growth in the country and it aims to stimulate 
policy debate and underpin the Bank’s engagement in Swaziland on growth issues. The Review 
of Social Safety Net Program provides invaluable information to inform policy and improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of social protection, which can help better design mechanisms to 
benefit the poorest and most vulnerable households, and thus make growth more inclusive. The 
assessment of TVET provides the current landscape of technical and vocational skills training 
and the identified improvement priorities for interventions. 

68. 

Analytical work planned for the CPS period is expected to fill existing knowledge 
gaps, build capacity, inform evidence-based policy making and lay the building blocks for 
the SCD programmed for FY17. The programmatic fiscal work for the Southern Africa Region 
is expected to provide the analytical background necessary to underpin the policy dialogue in 
SACU countries and improve the quality of fiscal policy making decision. Macroeconomic 
stability and sound economic management remain key elements for Swaziland and other SACU 
countries to foster growth, and increase resilience to shocks. The programmatic poverty work is 
aimed at filling the knowledge gaps and providing the much needed background to assess and 
monitor progress towards the twin goals, and strengthen capacity in the CSO which will help 
produce better quality, more frequent surveys. The programmatic work on trade and 
competitiveness 
is expected 
to provide 
the analytical background 
to 
improve 
trade, 
competitiveness and the regulatory background, support the ongoing work on trade facilitation 
and complement the proposed Private Sector Competitiveness project. It is expected to build on 
existing work on agriculture such as the Swaziland Rural Sector Reviews 13, 14 trade facilitation 
and value chains work, and the recently finalized agribusiness skills study which will help the 
development of agribusiness value chains. This is of special relevance to improve the livelihoods 
of rural households and achieve significant progress towards achievement of the twin goals, 
given that the vast majority of rural households are below the national poverty line.  

69. 

IFC and MIGA will seek to deepen their engagement in Swaziland.  IFC will explore 
opportunities to invest in systemic private sector initiatives in value chains like sugar, beef 
and wood pulp/ forestry as well as supporting government to attract PPPs in water, 
sanitation and solar energy. On a demand basis, IFC will support multinationals investing in 
Swaziland. The use of MIGA guarantees will offer reassurance to foreign investors, including 
investors into PPPs and will complement government efforts to attract foreign direct investment. 
During the CPS period, MIGA will continue to seek opportunities to support private investments 
particularly in NDS target areas. MIGA remains open for business in Swaziland across all of its 
Political Risk Insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of 
Contract and War and Civil Disturbance.

Financing the program  

70. 

The indicative envelope would be E500 million, equivalent to US$50 million for 
FY15-FY18, to be reviewed at mid-term in the light of changing client needs and available 
World Bank Group financing. This will be in addition to ongoing lending projects on health and 
local government and grant for customs modernization. Budget support will be considered 
should a financing need arise, contingent upon adequacy of the macro-economic and fiscal 
framework, country’s creditworthiness and IBRD financing availability, as well as Government 
commitment to a strong growth and reform program. New operations are envisaged on private 
sector competitiveness and public sector modernization within the three years of the program, 
see Table 5.

A. Pillar 1: Promoting growth and job creation 

71. 

A dynamic private sector (both domestic and foreign) is critical for Swaziland to achieve 
sustained economic growth, employment creation and poverty reduction. Priority reforms are 
necessary to develop a “critical mass” of conditions conducive to attract private sector 
investment. This pillar will support government create an enabling environment for private 
sector competitiveness, MSME growth and job creation in agribusiness and tourism sectors 
given their important role in inclusive growth and export potential. The Bank is prioritizing this 
pillar in response to the vast development need and client demand for support. In addition the 
WBG will bring its full strength to implement programs, with IBRD, IFC and MIGA working in 
a complementary manner as this is area of comparative advantage for the three institutions. The 
Bank will employ both lending and non-lending instruments to deliver programs under this 
pillar. 

 Regulatory environment and competitiveness. The World Bank Group interventions aim 
to support the country address challenges of low growth, high unemployment and high 
poverty by: (i) strengthening the business environment in selected sectors with proven 
export potential and poverty reduction. The Bank intervention in this area will aim to 
improve firm level productivity, lower the costs of investing, starting and running a 
business by eliminating policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional constraints that inhibit 
private sector growth; (ii) supporting export-led growth, hampered by limited integration 
of firms to market chains, weak forward/backward linkages among MSMEs and high 
logistics and customs costs. The Bank will support improvements in customs and trade 
regulations to facilitate cross-border trade. This will build on current work on trade 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
facilitation under the customs modernization grant. The Bank will also provide technical 
assistance in drafting of the Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan (FSDIP) 
with a view to introducing reforms in the financial sector by aligning policies and 
legislation to meet the changing structure of the sector. This will include: (a) 
development of a comprehensive FSDIP, which will form the basis for coherent and 
sequential reforms needed to promote financial sector deepening; (b) mapping of 
financial sector work; (c) analysis and sub-studies, including reviews covering the 
following areas: legal framework governing the financial sector, crisis management, 
access to finance, Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) such as insurance, micro-
insurance, and pensions; (d) mobilizing support and financial resources to empower and 
involve the stakeholders in the implementation of the FSDIP. 

 Skills development. The Bank will build upon the recently completed skills study to 
support market-driven skills development as a component of the proposed Private Sector 
Competitiveness Project (see above). The Bank interventions will aim to support the 
government effort in job creation and productivity growth by improving the quality, 
efficiency and coverage of skills development, particularly targeting the young 
population (15-24 age group), in line with the economic growth priorities of the country 
such as agriculture, agribusiness and tourism. These will include: (i) establishing a sound 
policy/incentive regime and a sustainable mechanism in terms of institutional set-up and 
financing for skills development in the country; (ii) reforming and improving the existing 
provision of TVET for increased responsiveness to the labor market and national growth 
priorities; and (iii) enhancing programs in apprenticeship, entrepreneurship, management 
and priority subject areas to skill-up and reskill the workforce for technology transfer and 
utilization and productivity growth, with a focus on middle-level supervisors and 
technicians. As part of the preparation for the proposed project, a forthcoming study on 
agribusiness skills development would complement the planned EU and IFAD-funded 
agriculture projects, which do not include activities to strengthen the country’s formal 
skills development systems. All these interventions aim to support addressing skills 
constraints in the above mentioned sectors and respond to new private sector demand and 
employment opportunities. 

B. Pillar 2: Strengthening state capabilities  

72. 

This pillar will focus on support to strengthen governance through initiatives aimed at 
improving transparency and accountability systems. This will be achieved through strengthening 
government technical and managerial capacity to implement policies and improve service 
delivery. The WBG has prioritized this pillar in response to expressed client demand and the 
developmental need to build the capacity of the state to implement policies, deliver programs and 
improve efficiency in public investments and expenditure. This is an area of World Bank 
comparative advantage, and the new CPS will build on ongoing support on local government, 
health, PFM and reserve asset management. The Bank will work closely with other development 
partners including IMF, USAID, EU, AfDB, UN agencies, and will employ both lending and 
non-lending instruments to deliver programs.  

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Economic management 
The Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and other institutions will be supported through a 
program of technical advisory and knowledge sharing services.  

73. 

 Supporting public financial management: The World Bank will work with other 
development partners in particular AfDB and EU to support critical areas in the PFM 
cycle to enhance accountability in the use of public funds. Priority areas include financial 
management information systems, commitment control systems, expenditure arrears 
management, financial reporting, internal and external audit. The Bank will continue with 
ongoing support to the Swaziland Internal Audit Department, financed by the USAID. 
The objective of this initiative is to support Government implement an internal audit 
philosophy and methodology in line with the standard professional practice of the 
Institute of Internal Auditors. Capacity building support will be provided to the PPP unit 
in the Ministry of Finance and strengthening the public investment management system. 
The Bank will continue to engage the Budget Department to develop, maintain and 
operate a BOOST database. The objectives of this initiative are to improve the quality of 
fiscal and public expenditure data and improve the quality of expenditure analysis that is 
available to government officials that can inform better public expenditure decision 
choices. Support will be provided to the Tender Board, Public Procurement Regulatory 
Agency (SPPRA) Board and executive to operationalize the Agency and ensure full 
compliance with the Procurement Act of 2011.   

 Public sector modernization. Support will be provided to support governance reforms to 
promote professionalization and accountability in the civil service. This will include 
institutionalizing systems for declaration of conflict of interests and financial disclosure 
at senior and executive levels. Such systems will help address perceptions of corruption 
and promote public confidence in senior and executive office bearers. Technical 
assistance will be provided for (i) strengthening government-wide strategic planning, 
including at the departmental and program level; (ii) results-based management and civil 
service management, including the conclusion of the payroll audit, right sizing the civil 
service and strengthening wage bill management; (iii) introducing an integrated 
performance management and M&E system, linking planning, budgeting, management 
and performance M&E.  

 Strengthening local government. The Bank will continue the implementation of the 
ongoing Local Government Project to strengthen accountability and institutional capacity 
of Tinkhundla and urban local governments. The primary focus is on improved practices 
in planning, budgeting, reporting, and social accountability. A possible follow-on 
operation will be discussed at the mid-term progress review stage and could prioritize 
support for improved service delivery at local government level either through an 
operation on water and sanitation or improved agricultural productivity and irrigation 
program. The exact nature of operation will be determined based on client demand.  

 Strengthening reserves asset management. The Reserves Advisory and Management 
Program (RAMP) managed by the Bank Treasury will continue. The Bank will support 
implementation of the Portfolio Analytics Tool (PAT) used to keep track of the reserves 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
portfolio holdings,  and to monitor compliance with the investment guidelines in terms of 
credit and market risk. The CBS will be assisted in defining a benchmark comprising 
Rand-denominated bonds and managing a portfolio of bonds versus this benchmark. 
Support will also be provided in the implementation of an operational risk framework 
through streamlining IT systems architecture, employing more enhanced portfolio 
management techniques and enhancing the monitoring and reporting framework to ensure 
good governance.  

Social services delivery  

74. 

Improved social services delivery through investments in health and social protection are 
essential to improve life expectancy and other social outcomes. The Bank will support social 
services delivery through the following programs: 

 Fighting HIV/AIDS and TB project and strengthening the health system. The ongoing 
IBRD- and EU-financed project supports health systems strengthening, renovation and 
equipping of health facilities; strengthening the referral and transport system; and 
increasing and improving nursing and midwifery services. The project also supports 
increasing social safety net access for OVC. Under this program, the World Bank Group 
will continue to work in close collaboration and complement ongoing programs by other 
development partners. The Bank will also support the implementation of the second 
National Health Sector Strategic Plan (2014-2019). A further health operation is 
envisaged in later years in line with the new strategic plan which is based on the 
Universal Health Coverage principle. An investment project will be supplemented by 
analytical work such as a Public Expenditure Review to identify bottlenecks and 
inefficiencies in the sector. The operation will focus on employing incentives to improve 
both technical and financial efficiency of the sector as well as the productivity of health 
workers through mechanisms such as public private partnerships and performance based 
financing. A common TB framework for the region developed jointly with WHO has 
been signed. The Bank will support implementation of this initiative at country level 
through technical and advisory services.  

 Strengthening social safety net and poverty monitoring system. The WBG will continue 
its social protection engagement under Component 3 of the Health, HIV/AIDS, and TB 
Project, by supporting the development of all key social protection delivery systems 
(poverty targeting methodology and implementation; electronic payment mechanism for 
social transfers; management information system for social transfers) and capacity 
development to the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office in designing and implementing social 
protection programs. The WBG will also provide technical assistance to the Deputy 
Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security on the social 
protection strategy process. These activities will complement the EU’s new social 
protection project. In addition, the Bank will support capacity building through its AAA 
program to strengthen the country’s statistical system by complementing UNDP’s work 
on statistics. This will be accomplished through the programmatic poverty work in the 
sub-region. The Bank will continue to provide training on core modules of ADePT 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
software to analyze micro data to assess poverty, inequality, and the efficiency of social 
programs. Assistance will also be provided to the CSO on poverty measurement and 
household survey methodologies and on micro data preservation and dissemination 
through the Accelerated Data Program initiative (ADP).  

 Conducting analytical work to assess the extent and causes of gender, poverty and 
inequality in Swaziland and propose actionable recommendations for addressing main 
gender challenges. The World Bank will build on the existing gender studies conducted 
by the Government, other donor agencies and the civil society to track levels and changes 
in poverty indicators over time and across regions. The Bank will conduct the Gender 
Assessment early in the CPS period to address needs in gender responsive policies and 
actions for poverty reduction and economic growth, and also to inform the Bank project 
and task level interventions.   

75. 

VIII. PARTNERSHIPS  
There are a number of development partners operating in Swaziland; collaboration with 
these partners will be instrumental for successful implementation of the CPS (see Annex 9). The 
Bank will maintain ongoing dialogue with development partners on common areas of interest. 
Future programs will benefit from close coordination with other development partners to 
harmonize efforts and avoid duplication of resources.  

IX. RISK ASSESSMENT  

76. 

Overall the risk to the 2015-18 CPS is substantial. The World Bank lending to 
Swaziland will increase during the CPS period to $50 million. The residual risks to the CPS 
program that may critically impact on the CPS to achieve its objectives, are (i) macroeconomic 
risks, (ii) political and governance risks, and (iii) fiduciary risks, (agency and capacity risks), 
which may transmit to project implementation levels. 

77. 

The macroeconomic risk with a potential adverse impact on the CPS program 
implementation will remain moderate to substantial. The country faces risks from the external 
economic environment in the form of market shocks (trade shocks or exchange rate volatility), 
reductions in external grants for HIV/AIDS, or declining SACU revenue transfers. The expected 
significant increase of public debt during the mid-term, (doubling as a percent of GDP by 2017) 
in the absence of stringent fiscal adjustment, may result in Swaziland facing the risk of debt 
distress during the CPS period. Although the SACU receipts will strengthen the international 
reserves and the local currency peg to the Rand over the medium term, Swaziland currency 
stability will remain vulnerable to the South Africa CAD volatility. Any deterioration of the 
macroeconomic situation, especially with respect to loss of fiscal revenues would impact 
adversely government health and social protection efforts and transmit to the effectiveness of the 
CPS objectives in growth and jobs pillar and the social services strategic objective. These risks 
will be mitigated through monitoring, policy dialogue and if the circumstances demand by 
budget support, focusing on fiscal consolidation and growth.   

29 

 
 
 
 
78. 

The political and governance risks are expected to be substantial during the CPS 
implementation. The governance system in Swaziland leaves room for political interference, 
policy reversals, vested interests, nepotism and corruption which can adversely affect the 
selection and prioritization of sectoral investments, as well as the effective implementation of 
programs. The Bank’s Private Sector Competitiveness project can be particularly vulnerable to 
such risks, if the project beneficiaries become direct competitors to established vested interest.  
The Bank will seek to mitigate these risks by establishing a high level inter-agency oversight 
body to work on strengthening the mechanisms of transparency, accountability and by enlisting 
broader government and stakeholder support under the CPS’s state capabilities pillar, for the 
implementation of the ongoing Bank’s Local Government Project and the new Public 
Administration Modernization Project. 

79. 

The fiduciary risks to the Bank program will remain substantial. Limitations in state 
implementation capacity pose risks to effectively achieve the objective of the CPS program. 
Requests for Bank Group support often emerge from Ministries or other agencies without central 
coordination. To manage government demand and monitor implementation, the Bank will 
maintain the existing mechanism of regular reviews of project deliverables with Ministry of 
Finance and Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. The planned capacity building 
technical assistance to the Ministries of Health, Deputy Prime Minister’s Office and the Central 
Statistics Office, together with the new Procurement TA will aim to address the capacity and 
fiduciary challenges and mitigate program implementation risks on institutional level. The 
mitigation of project-level risk will be done by strengthening the review process with higher 
attention to non-fiduciary (political economy) risks, hiring ‘hybrid” PIUs consisting of civil 
servants and external consultants, building check lists into the project design, and through 
reviews as part of the ISRs and MTRs during implementation.

Annex 1: CPS Results Matrix 

Pillar I: Promoting Growth and Job Creation 
A dynamic private sector (both domestic and foreign) is critical for Swaziland to achieve sustained economic growth, employment 
creation and poverty reduction. Priority reforms are necessary to develop a “critical mass” of conditions conducive to attract private 
sector investment. Two key priorities to achieve this are: (i) regulatory environment and competitiveness towards improved MSMEs 
productivity and export promotion; and (ii) skills development to align with the market needs. 
Objective 1. Regulatory Environment and Competitiveness
Intervention Logic: The World Bank interventions aim to support the country address challenges of low growth, high unemployment 
and poverty by: (i) strengthening the business environment in agribusiness and tourism given their inclusive growth and export 
potential; reducing the costs of doing business and improving firm-level productivity; and (ii) supporting export-led growth, hampered 
by poor integration of firms to market chains, weak forward/backward linkages among MSMEs and high logistics and customs costs. 
The Bank will support improvements in customs and trade regulations to facilitate improvements in cross-border trade. The Bank will 
also support Government efforts towards financial inclusion through (iii) Development of the FSDIP and review of the legal 
framework governing financial sector and NBFI. This is a core program for the World Bank, meeting all three selectivity criteria (see 
selectivity framework Figure 8). The Bank will support the country effort through analytical and advisory services in areas with 
moderate to substantial operational risks however, with significant pay-offs.

Objective 2. Skills Development
Intervention Logic: The growth of Swaziland’s working age population will be outpacing its total population growth, which would 
lead to increased expectations for job creation, especially productive jobs. The Bank will build upon the recently completed skills study 
to support market-driven skills development as a component of the proposed Private Sector Competitiveness Project. The Bank 
interventions will support government effort in job creation and productivity growth by improving the quality, efficiency and coverage 
of skills development, particularly targeting the young population (15-24 age group), in line with the economic growth priorities of the 
country in targeted sectors such as agriculture, agribusiness and tourism. This is an operational area with low to medium operation risk. 
The Bank’s interventions were identified based on the developmental needs in reference to relevant international experiences and client 
demand. They are complementarity to the above Strategic Objective #1.

Pillar II: Strengthening State Capabilities 
A capable and well performing state requires strong domestic sources of revenue and effective public service delivery; human 
capabilities need to be enhanced to increase growth, raise incomes and alleviate poverty in a sustainable manner. The World Bank 
Group can contribute to strengthening state capabilities in the following areas: (i) Economic management and (ii) Social services 
delivery 
Objective 1. Economic Management
Intervention Logic: The capacity constraints within the civil service undermine policy implementation, service delivery and adequate 
macroeconomic management. The Bank will support the client in the following areas: (i) PFM, (ii) public sector modernization, (iii) 
reserves asset management and; (iv) local government. The Bank interventions were identified through sector analytics and the country 
selectivity framework. This is a core program area and it carries substantial implementation risks.

Objective 2. Social services delivery 
Intervention Logic: The state ability to effectively address the growth and poverty challenges is hampered by inadequate poverty 
monitoring, fragmentation of the social protection programs, lack of SP strategy, and the high prevalence of disease (TB and 
HIV/AIDS), undermining human capital investments. In collaboration with other development partners, the World Bank will support 
the country efforts to (i) consolidate the safety nets and management; (ii) improve quality of the health services delivery, and (iii) 
strengthen the poverty statistical monitoring. The Bank interventions will support this strategic area with lending and TA. The 
operational risk level is moderate to substantial.

Annex 8: Summary of Stakeholder Consultations 

The World Bank organized a series of consultations in May 2014 to engage partners on the 
proposed CPS. Bank staff delivered a brief presentation on the Swaziland’s development 
challenges and the proposed program pillars and invited stakeholders to offer input 16.  
Development Challenges. In general, there was agreement on the development challenges 
facing Swaziland. All of the stakeholders agreed that the high levels of poverty, inequality, and 
unemployment remain significant obstacles. While the Bank’s presentation suggested that the 
HIV/AIDS situation in Swaziland has stabilized, albeit at a high level, there was some concern 
that the focus on HIV/AIDS should not be lost in the new CPS.  

Governance and State capacity. All parties consulted agree on limitations in state capacity 
which undermines implementation of policies and service delivery. Some stakeholders identified 
the lack of political will to review the current system of Governance and the separation of 
powers. Cases of imprisonment of media representatives and unionists demonstrate that the 
Swazi public has no mechanism through which to voice their concerns. Other areas of concern 
include lack of accountability and transparency in the public service in general and public 
investments in particular.  

Investment climate and private sector competitiveness. Stakeholders cited the poor 
investment climate as a major barrier to economic growth. A number of challenges faced by 
firms were highlighted including bureaucratic processes and poor service delivery which raises 
the cost of doing business. Concerns were raised about the high costs and poor quality of 
telecommunications as well as the absence of competition in this sector. Some noted the high tax 
burden, especially for micro, small, and medium enterprises, coupled with financing constraints 
this impedes on MSME growth. Another concern was the cumbersome procedures and high costs 
of trading across borders. For Swaziland, a small state that depends heavily on the success of 
exporting for economic growth, lowering the cost (both in financial and in terms of time) of 
trading across borders is absolutely essential.  

Education and skills development. Another area of concern noted by stakeholders was the 
mismatch between the skills provided by the education system and the skill needs demanded by 
the private sector. There was concern that the quality of the education system is slipping, and that 
students graduating from secondary school are not equipped for success. There was also concern 
that tertiary institutions are not able to provide the skills that the private sector needs, and even 
are sometimes resistant to changes suggested by the private sector.  

Areas of collaboration Possible areas of collaboration were discussed with development 
partners. These included social protection; private sector development; agribusiness; building 
state capacities; and health.  

16 Stakeholders consulted include: Government, UN Agencies, Chamber of Commerce, Civil Society Organizations, 
European Union, USAID.

Annex 9: Coordination with Development Partners 

Health 

The United States Government-funded President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 
continues to be the largest development partner funding activity across the continuum of 
HIV/AIDS and TB care in the areas of prevention, care and treatment, impact mitigation, and 
health systems strengthening. The Swaziland Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) has four 
active grants from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, & Malaria, which support 
essential services in HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria on prevention, care and treatment and impact 
mitigation. However, these grants are coming to an end in 2014, and the CCM is currently 
developing three grant applications to the Global Fund for TB-HIV, Malaria and Health Systems 
Strengthening for the period 2014-2016. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is 
supporting government-owned, sustainable M&E capacity development through needs-based 
human capacity development training in line with the Government’s National HIV/AIDS 
Strategic Plan and HIV M&E Plan. The European Union contributes to development in the 
health sector through its co-financing of the ongoing World Bank/EU Health, HIV/AIDS, and 
TB Project, which focuses on primary health care, maternal and child health, and the HIV/AIDS 
and TB co-epidemic. The project also strengthens the social safety net for orphans and 
vulnerable children. The World Bank is also working on a regional initiative on tuberculosis in 
the mining sector.

Education 

The European Union continues to support the Government’s efforts to provide universal Free 
Primary Education by financing costs relating to Grade 1 students. Japan International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA) continues to support the improvement of secondary education by 
dispatching Experts / Volunteers on Mathematics/Science/ICT and constructing new secondary 
schools. The Bank’s recent activities in education have been limited mostly to two pieces of 
analytical work: a rapid assessment of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in 
2013 and a study on the skills needed for agribusiness in 2014.  

Agriculture 

The European Union has financed significant interventions in the agriculture sector. The 
objective of the Swaziland Agriculture Development Project is to develop improved smallholder 
production and marketing systems which lead to sustainable food security and an improved 
quality of life for rural households in Swaziland. The EU is also preparing the new High Value 
Crop and Horticulture Project, which will support high impact commodity value chains with a 
focus on horticulture through strengthening of market finding, production planning, production, 
packing and collection of products. This new project will work through the Swaziland Water and 
Agricultural Development Enterprise (SWADE) and the National Agricultural Marketing Board 
(NAMBoard.) 

Infrastructure 

The European Union has been supporting agricultural infrastructure in two areas: 1) the 
upgrading of roads in the sugar belt to help decrease the costs of transporting sugar cane from 
smallholder farms to the mills; and 2) rehabilitation of irrigation canals. The EU also supports 
the 
implementation of small-scale community development 
infrastructure 
through 
the 
Government’s MicroProjects Programme (MPP.) These small-scale infrastructure projects are 
similar to those funded by the World Bank’s Swaziland Local Government Project (SLGP,) but 
are in different Tinkhundla (administrative districts) than those funded by the SLGP.  

Governance 

The European Union’s Governance Project will seek to improve public financial management by 
financing the implementation of an integrated financial management information system 
(IFMIS), as well as technical assistance relating to the implementation of the Public Financial 
Management Bill. The World Bank’s ongoing Swaziland Local Government Project focuses on 
improving governance at the municipality and Tinkhundla level.  

Social Protection 

The European Union is preparing a new project in the area of social protection, which will seek 
to build the capacity of the Government to manage social protection programs, and also to 
improve the effectiveness of existing social protection programs in Swaziland. The United 
Nations system continues to engage the Government on policy dialogue relating to social 
protection. Component 3 of the World Bank/ EU Health, HIV/AIDS, and TB Project is designing 
and implementing a pilot program to provide cash transfers to the households of orphans and 
vulnerable children.
