EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. 
Amidst the historic and tumultuous changes that have marked the Region in
recent years, Morocco has embarked on a promising and peaceful political and social
transition toward a more open society. The transition has come in response to the demands
of Moroccans who took to the streets in early 2011 to call for change as the economy failed to
deliver on jobs and opportunities, particularly for youth, despite years of strong growth and
prudent economic management.

ii. 
In response, the King of Morocco launched a broad program of reforms and a
new Constitution was adopted in 2011. It presents a revised governance framework,
strengthening the powers of the Head of Government and of Parliament and the independence
of the judiciary. It grants greater human and social rights, providing for a more open and
decentralized system of governance. A new coalition Government formed in 2012 has sought
to implement the reforms promised under the new Constitution. As weak global growth has
dampened Morocco's economic performance and hindered job creation, the Government has
increasingly focused on managing social pressures, and this has delayed reforms. In 2014, the
coalition Government renewed its commitment to the reform program.

iii. Morocco's economic prospects are closely tied to Europe's, and any slow-down
there will undermine the macro-economic outlook through continued weak exports,
tourism, remittances or FDI. High fuel prices, deterioration in the regional context, or
renewed global financial turmoil would compound these challenges. While the Government
has launched a series of sector strategies to boost economic performance, absent a reorientation
of the economy toward the tradable sector and increased competitiveness, growth and job
creation will remain weak. Morocco will therefore need to increase its efforts to enhance
competitiveness and gain market share on global markets. These efforts will require a higher
quality of domestic 
investments and continuing to attract large flows of foreign direct
investments. It will call for increased opportunities and economic freedom for all Moroccans,
to compete, produce and participate in the economy, and a greater role for the private sector.

iv. Macroeconomic stability will depend on strengthened governance and robust
fiscal consolidation-particularly subsidy, pension, and fiscal reforms, a prudent
monetary policy, and greater flexibility in exchange rate management. While subsidy and
pension reforms are most urgent, including establishing more effective and inclusive social
protection programs, structural reforms are needed in the medium term to boost enterprise
productivity by better channeling resources to competitive industries. The 2014 Budget Law
confirmed the Government's strategy to continue reforming the subsidy system and launch the
reforms of the pension and fiscal systems this year. In addition, government intends to adopt
the Organic Budget Law to strengthen the articulation and implementation of local government
budgets. The government plans to proceed with justice reform, improve access to financing,
especially for SMEs, address constraints to land access, develop logistics services, and
reinforce technical training. Assuming these reforms take place, growth in the non-agriculture
economy could reach around 5.5 percent over the medium term, with inflation below 2 percent
and the budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP.

v. 
Against this backdrop, the World Bank Group (WBG) seeks to renew its
commitment to support Morocco 
in accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth to
create much-needed employment and to achieve the twin goals of eliminating poverty and
boosting shared prosperity. Under this four-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the
WBG proposes to scale up its support for Morocco's open governance and green growth
agendas, supporting innovative multi-sector approaches to sustainable and environmentally-

Vii

sound development, for the benefit of future generations and to improve private sector-led
competitiveness and global integration. The CPS deepens the WBG's focus on improving
governance and strengthening the accountability and capacity of institutions that manage
public resources and deliver basic services, particularly at the local level. Promoting citizens'
voice and participation is integral to these efforts, as is the focus on gender and youth. The CPS
is designed to support these objectives with a broad array of financial and technical instruments
and services drawing on the comparative strengths of IBRD, IFC and MIGA.

vi. Morocco's estimated demand for IBRD financing during the CPS period of FY14-
17 may reach US$4 billion. Lending volumes 
in FY15-17 will depend on country
performance, IBRD's lending capacity, demand by other Bank borrowers and global economic
developments. This level of financing represents a notable scale up for the World Bank in
Morocco and would allow for a high case lending scenario that would support the critical
reforms and investments in the area of public administration reform, increased accountability
and decentralization, employment support, inclusive green growth, agriculture modernization
and basic services. This stepped-up engagement will respond to Morocco's need for external
financing and enable the authorities to pursue economic transformation against a backdrop of
economic difficulties in Europe that have dampened external demand; high international food
and fuel prices; and escalating social pressure pressures to create jobs and to deliver on the
promises of the new Constitution. Development Policy Loans (DPL) are expected to continue
to play an important role in IBRD lending to support reforms. At the same time, as the Bank
shifts toward a more results-centered program, providing increased 
levels of technical
assistance for reforms and building institutional capacity, the proportion of non-DPL financing,
namely investment lending and program for results lending, is expected to increase.

vii. 
IFC will focus its efforts on attracting more private capital to Morocco, and in
FY14 IFC expects to invest about US$150 million from its own account. Assuming continued
improvements in the business environment, IFC expects to invest a total of around US$350-
400 million over the FY15-17 period from its own account, as well as mobilize additional
resources from other investors. IFC will continue to boost investor confidence in Morocco by
playing a counter cyclical role and will adjust its approach to allow for flexibility in
implementing its program to reflect changes in market conditions. In line with the principles of
additionality, IFC will remain selective in its engagement in the country and continue focus on
innovative areas, inclusion and south-south/regional 
integration. Promoting South-South
investments, particularly to support the expansion of Morocco's regional players, will be a
critical aspect of IFC's strategy. IFC's stepped up engagement in Morocco will continue to
focus on increasing private sector led growth, creating jobs and expanding access to finance for
small and medium business, especially of youth and women. IFC will continue to implement a
sizeable advisory program to address constraints to private sector development which is critical
to foster a competitive private sector.

vii. 
The Bank Group's performance will be measured against its contributions to the
priorities of the Government as proposed in the CPS. Annex 2 presents a Results
Framework that tracks progress towards expected CPS outcomes in each of the three Results
Areas. The Bank will hold Performance Learning Reviews to evaluate program performance
jointly with Moroccan counterparts.

viii. The CPS identifies several risks to the program and mitigating measures:
Economic, social and external risks: Uncertain economic prospects in Europe and emerging
markets create downside 
risk 
to Morocco's trade position, economic growth, fiscal
performance and pace of financing for investments. Morocco will remain under tremendous
domestic pressure to continue generous social programs. The CPS program is designed

Viii

precisely to provide financial and technical assistance on these complex issues, including
reforms to improve the fiscal situation, to help the economy become more competitive and to
bolster broad-based support for reforms. Political risks. The implementation of the CPS and
achievement of proposed outcomes are predicated on the Government's adherence to the
ambitious reforms set out in its program. The WBG will maintain a close dialogue with the
authorities and other stakeholders and help raise awareness of reform options. Program
coordination risks: To mitigate delays in preparation and implementation of multi-sector
operations due to weak coordination, the Bank will work closely with its partners to establish
consensus and define clear roles and responsibilities, in line with the respective technical
expertise and mandate of agencies. Implementation risks are relate principally to resolving
safeguards issues around land acquisition and compensation that have delayed implementation
of some investment operations The Bank has launched a review of these and other safeguards
issues and is discussing a program for resolving them with the authorities. The Bank will also
work closely with counterparts to ensure the availability of data that is essential for key
analytical activities to proceed.

I. 

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This document presents the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Morocco for FY14 to FY17. The WBG's approach under the new CPS
has evolved in a number of important ways since the 2010 CPS (Board presentation in January
2010) and CPS Progress Report (Board presentation in June 2012). Following the historic
political and social events in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region since early
2011, Morocco has engaged in a promising transition and reform process built on the principles
of a new Constitution providing for greater accountability, openness, and opportunity. At the
same time, weak global growth, strains on natural resources, and stubborn unemployment
levels have dampened Morocco's economic performance and highlighted the need for
important shifts in its development model.

2. 
Against this backdrop, the WBG seeks to renew its commitment to support
Morocco 
in accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth to create much-needed
employment and to eliminate poverty and boost shared prosperity. Under this CPS, the
WBG proposes to scale up its support for Morocco's open governance and green growth
agendas, supporting innovative multi-sector approaches to sustainable and environmentally
sound development for the benefit of future generations, and to improve private sector-led
competitiveness and global integration to reduce the country's vulnerability to shocks. Indeed,
a broader global integration agenda will be the paramount driver of private sector development,
job creation, and structural changes in Morocco in the coming years. The CPS deepens the
WBG's focus on improving governance and strengthening the accountability and capacity of
institutions that manage public resources and deliver basic services, particularly at the local
level. Promoting citizens' voice and participation is integral to these efforts, as is the focus on
gender and youth. The CPS is designed to support these objectives using a broad array of
financial and technical instruments and services from IBRD, IFC, and MIGA.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

Political Context

3. 
Morocco's political landscape has been relatively stable over the past decades. The
country is governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, whereby executive power is
exercised by a multi-party government led by a Head of Government and by the King who is
the Head of State. Legislative power is vested in both the Chamber of Representatives and the
Chamber of Councilors, while the judiciary is independent from the Government.

4. 
The Arab Spring in early 2011 spurred a peaceful political transformation in
Morocco. Reflective of this call for sweeping change, Moroccans-young people in
particular-called for a revamped democratic system, improved governance, and greater
freedoms, voice, and opportunities. Although Morocco has experienced noteworthy economic
and social advances since the 1990s, high unemployment and lack of opportunity led protestors
to denounce exclusion and corruption.

5. 
The King responded by launching a comprehensive program of reforms, including
the drafting of a new Constitution adopted through a referendum in July 2011. The
Constitution presented a revised governance framework and strengthened the powers of the
Head of Government and of Parliament, and the independence of the judiciary. It granted
greater human and social rights, providing for a more open (and decentralized) system of
governance and laying out the rules for fairer and more inclusive development.

1

6. 
Breaking with the past and as required by the new Constitution, the King
designated a Head of Government from the party that won the most seats in legislative
elections held in November 2011. After years in opposition, the Justice and Development
Party (Parti de la justice et du developpement, PJD) achieved a groundbreaking victory by
winning the most seats in legislative elections. In January 2012, the King named Abdelilah
Benkirane, the head of the PJD, as Head of Government to form a new coalition government
("Benkinrane I") that would be tasked with delivering on the main reforms under the new
Constitution and to harmonize legislative texts with the new constitutional provisions.

7. 
Benkirane I was slow 
to deliver on the ambitious legislative agenda amid
significant social pressures and a weakened economic environment. As growth slowed, in
the context of the Eurozone crisis and instability in the region, the Government focused on
managing social pressures. Progress on reforms was also hampered by the differing views of
coalition members on how best to approach them. Moreover, new requirements for public
consultations have lengthened the process for finalizing and adopting new policies.

8. 
In 2014, the coalition Government renewed its commitment to pursue reforms and
implement the Constitution. Following changes in the coalition government in 2013,1 the
Benkirane II Government confirmed its commitment to push forward with reforms and
accelerate the legislative agenda set out by the new Constitution.

Social Context and Poverty Profile2

9. 
With an average economic growth rate of nearly 5 percent from 2001-2011,
Morocco reduced poverty and boosted shared prosperity. Extreme poverty has practically
been eradicated, dropping from 2 percent to 0.28 percent over the same period. 3 Relative
poverty also declined, from 15.3 percent to 6.2 percent, and population vulnerability (those
living just above the poverty line) decreased from 22.8 percent to 13.3 percent.4 Still, nearly 20
percent of the country, or 6.3 million Moroccans, live in poverty or under constant threat of
falling back into poverty. During the same period, the wellbeing of the bottom 40 percent of
the population grew both in absolute terms (the wellbeing of the poor improved) and relative
terms (the wellbeing of the poor improved relative to that of the non-poor), suggesting an
increase in shared prosperity.

** 

5

10. 
Inequality, poverty and vulnerability remain important challenges. Morocco's Gini
coefficient of 0.41 reflects stubbornly high levels of inequality. Disparities in poverty rates
across regions provide one measure of this inequality: in 2011, the poverty rate in seven of
Morocco's sixteen regions was higher than the national average, as much as 40 percent higher
in three of those regions (Figure 1). Moroccan cities, generating 75 percent of GDP, have
pockets of entrenched poverty and high rates of unemployment. Inequality hinders the potential
for economic growth to reduce poverty rates further and delays the emergence of a larger
middle class.

Notably, the withdrawal of the Istiqlal party, the second largest in the coalition,and the subsequent entry of the center-right
National Rally of Independents (NRI) party in the government coalition.
2 All poverty indicators for 2011 are HCP estimates mapping 2007 HHCS data with LFSs. Results are published by HCP in the
2013 MDGs report.
Extreme poverty refers to the population living on less than US$1 PPP/day. The drop is based on the national poverty
threshold, corresponding to the equivalent of US$2.15 PPP in 2007.
4Alternative poverty measurements confirm this decline. The Alkire-Foster multidimensional poverty rates declined from
28.5% in 2004 to 8.9% in 2011.
The wellbeing of the bottom 40% of the population grew by 3.3 percent over 2001-2007, against the growth rate of per-capita
household consumption (3.2%) over that period.

11. 
Poverty rates are highest in rural areas. Ten percent of Morocco's 13.4 million rural
residents lived below the poverty line in 2011. They account for two-thirds of the poor in
Morocco and are largely employed in informal agriculture (including fisheries and forestry).
Poverty is linked to difficult geographic conditions, particularly mountainous areas, as well as
to deteriorating 
infrastructure, poor access to basic services and very limited formal
employment opportunities. The emerging effects of climate change are expected to have the
greatest impact on the poorest and most vulnerable. Participants in CPS consultations in the
Taounate province confirmed the long distances, lack of adequate transportation, and costs
encountered in reaching schools and health facilities, noting that their children leave for school
before daybreak and return after sunset, often by foot. Close to a quarter of rural households
have no direct access to a road and live at least 10 kilometers away from basic health services.
The share of births attended by skilled health personnel averages 63 percent, compared to 92
percent in urban areas. 6 In certain regions (such as the Atlantic coast and Mediterranean
mountainous 
region), households still do not have access 
to safe drinking water.
Telecommunications service coverage also poses a challenge in rural areas. These factors all
combine to lower the quality of life, productivity, and prospects of rural households.

12. 
Despite some notable progress on key human development indicators, Morocco
still lags in health and education achievements. Immunization of one-year-olds 
is nearly
universal and indicators of life expectancy and average infant and maternal mortality rates have
all improved over the past ten years.7 Nonetheless, they compare poorly to similar economies
and progress has been uneven, with rural areas being left behind. Morocco is in the midst of a
rapid demographic and epidemiological transition, seeing fewer communicable illnesses but
growing incidence of chronic disease which has important cost implications for the health
sector. Non-communicable diseases (NCD) account for 75 percent of all deaths, followed by
diabetes. The leading cause of death for young Moroccans (between the ages of 20 and 29) is

Life expectancy improved from 71.7 years in 2004 to 74.9 years in 2011 (Source: HCP); Mortality rates increased by over 15
percent from 2000 to 2012 (Source: UNDP).

road traffic accidents, which have increased by an alarming 35 percent during 2000-2010.
Morocco spends less on health care than do countries of similar socioeconomic development.

13. 
There has been remarkable improvement in access to education, though the MDG
of universal primary school completion is unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Net primary
school enrollment rates increased from 75 to 96 percent between 2000 and 2011, and similar
improvements were noted at the secondary level. 9 Nonetheless, educational quality and
learning outcomes continue to lag well behind those of other countries with similar or even
lower income levels and overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity in secondary and higher
education also remain high. International studies have shown that 74 percent of Moroccan
students do not reach even the lowest benchmark level of Grade 4 mathematics, compared with
the international median of 10 percent.

14. With less than half of the Moroccan population economically active, Morocco has
one of the lowest labor participation rates among emerging economies. Despite declining
by 4 percent between 2000 and 2011, unemployment has remained at around 9 percent, or one
million people. Unemployment rates are higher in urban areas (13.7 percent compared to 4
percent in rural areas), among women (at 10 percent compared to 9 for men, though with a
very low participation rate of 25 percent), youth (18 percent, although only 32 percent
participate), and highly educated individuals, according to the Haut Commissariat Au Plan
(HCP).

15. 
Access to basic infrastructure services has increased dramatically over the past 15
years, although quality and sustainability remain of concern. Nearly 98 percent of urban
households have access 
to a power network, and 98 percent of rural households have
electricity. Thousands of villages have standpipes providing potable water for 93 percent of the
population as of 2013 (compared to 61 percent in 2004). The rate of connection to sewerage is
estimated at around 76 percent in large cities. The mobile telephone penetration rate has grown
dramatically from 73 percent in 2008 to 122 percent in 2013. Despite these advances, overall
progress has been uneven and some rural and peri-urban areas, as well as small and medium-
sized cities, still lack access 
to basic infrastructure services. Moreover, the reliability,
maintenance, and financial sustainability of these services remain a persistent challenge,
particularly at the local level.

Economic Developments and Prospects"

16. 
Structurally, the Moroccan economy remains oriented toward nontradable
activities (such as construction, public works, and low value-added services) and volatile,
poorly productive agriculture. Given this orientation, Morocco has made little productivity
gains over the past two decades despite high levels of investment." 
Investment efforts-
dominated by publicly funded large infrastructure projects-have boosted the productivity of
labor, but have not triggered a growth take-off through higher total factor productivity (TFP).
Some positive effects may still occur in coming years as the TFP gains from government
expenditures on infrastructure (energy, highways, ports, airports, industrial zones) materialize.
But Morocco has yet to guarantee the productivity gains needed to support the emergence of a

larger middle class. The challenge of increasing and further sharing prosperity remains
paramount.

17. 
One important explanatory factor behind Morocco's weak economic performance
can be traced to its difficulty in benefitting from the current wave of globalization.
Morocco's share of global exports has hovered around 0.15 percent since the mid-1970s, while
most competitors have seen substantial increases in their shares. The price of the national
export basket has generally been higher, than that of key competitors and this gap has widened
since the global financial crisis. High and rising export prices are symptomatic of persistent
weaknesses in the competitiveness of Moroccan enterprises on the global market. Moroccan
firms strive to improve the sophistication and quality of their export products. While existing
firms have increased their market share for existing products in existing destinations, the
renewal of the exporter base with entry and exit of firms is limited, and existing firms exhibit
little product and market innovation.

18. 
The enormous competitiveness challenge faced by Moroccan firms was highlighted
by the country's response to recent adverse external shocks. While the 2008 financial crisis
has had limited direct effects on Morocco's economy, the subsequent food and fuel price crises
and Eurozone crisis have had more serious repercussions. Morocco suffered a major
deterioration of its terms of trade, compounded by a significant increase in its food import bill
since 2008 (18 percent per year on average). Moreover, with a strong trade exposure to the
European Union (EU), Morocco has been adversely affected by the sovereign debt crises in
Spain, Italy, and Portugal, and the subsequent slowdown of economic growth in Europe more
generally. As a result, economic growth beyond the agricultural sector has decelerated to an
average of 3.5 percent since 2009, compared to 4.7 percent during 2000-2008. Growth has
been driven mostly by debt-creating domestic demand, most notably by growing public
expenditures. On the upside, the emergence of new growth drivers in higher value-added
industries (such as car manufacturing and aeronautics) and the expansion of Moroccan
companies in Western Africa are potentially creating the conditions for Morocco to become a
regional hub for investments between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.

19. 
In response to deteriorating fiscal trends, the Government initiated the reform of
the subsidy system and began to rein in other recurrent and capital expenditures.
Morocco's fiscal balance swung from a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to the highest
deficit in two decades, at 7.3 percent of GDP, in 2012. The activation of a price indexation
mechanism helped cut subsidies by almost 2 percentage points of GDP in 2013. The
consolidation measures also included limiting the rise of the wage bill to 2 percent and cutting
capital outlays by 6.2 percent. As a result, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 6 percent of GDP1 2 in
2013, and the recourse to international markets was limited to US$750 million in 2013, as
compared to US$1.5 billion in 2012. Following an agreement signed with the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries in 2012, Morocco has also received US$615 million in capital grants
in 2013. Outstanding government debt continued to increase in 2013 (albeit at a slower pace
than in recent years) to reach 62.3 percent of GDP.

20. 
The pursuit of expansionary fiscal policies has fuelled current account deficits in
recent years. After widening to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2012, the current account deficit is
estimated to have improved to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2013. Europe has remained Morocco's
main trading partner by far. On the financing side, in a context of a fixed exchange rate, net

including capital grants was 5.4 percent of GDP in 2013.

foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows grew by an impressive 23 percent in 2013. After two
years of falling foreign exchange reserves, overall financial flows more than covered the
current account deficit in 2013, leading to a consolidation of foreign reserves by US$1.3 billion
to US$18.5 billion (4.3 months of imports).

21. 
The financing of fiscal deficits tightened banking system liquidity. In 2012, Bank
Al-Maghrib partly compensated for this by relaxing its stance in a context of low inflation:
cutting its policy rate from 3.25 to 3 percent, lowering the commercial banks' reserve
requirement from 6 to 4 percent, and increasing liquidity injections. In 2013, the monetary
stance was less accommodating and money supply grew by only 2.8 percent, compared to 4.5
percent in 2012. Non-performing loans continued to increase in 2013, reaching 5.9 percent of
bank credit to the private sector. With the loan-to-deposit ratio exceeding 100 percent in
domestic banks, the scope for extending credits 
to the private sector 
is increasingly
constrained. The implementation of the Basel III accords, which comes into force in 2014, is
expected to put further pressure on credit extension, especially longer terms and to larger
borrowers.

22. 
Progress toward fiscal consolidation and improvement in external indicators
underscore that the Government's medium-term macroeconomic framework remains
broadly appropriate. Nevertheless, difficult conditions 
in 
the global and 
regional
environment entail significant downside risks. In particular, three debt sustainability analysis
tests put the medium-term public debt-to-GDP ratio in the 62-64 percent range, highlighting
the risks posed by a limited reform scenario. However, successful implementation of the
Government's revamped development strategy should ensure that this outcome is avoided (see
Table 1 for key macroeconomic projections under a strong reform scenario). In the 2014
Budget Law, the Government confirmed its intention to continue reforming the subsidy system
and to launch a reform of the pension system. In addition, it has asserted its commitment to
deepen regionalization and deconcentration and adopt the organic budget law necessary to
enhance the central and local governments' ability to deliver better and more efficient services.
To improve the investment climate further, the Government plans to proceed with justice
reform; improve access to financing, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs);
address constraints in access to land; develop logistics services; and reinforce technical
training. Last year, Bank Al-Maghrib announced its aim to move toward a more flexible
exchange rate mechanism over the next three years.

Key Development Challenges

A. Accelerating and Sustaining Economic Growth

Accelerating shared growth

23. 
One of the key challenges for Morocco is to grow its economy faster than at
historical rates in order to generate more jobs and greater wealth. Prudent economic
management produced average growth rates of around 5 percent during 2001-2011 and reduced
poverty (see above section on the poverty profile). Yet this growth rate has been insufficient to
reduce unemployment, which has held at 9-10 percent since 2006. A simultaneously declining
participation rate points to a disturbing trend of increased exclusion. It is estimated that
Morocco needs to reach annual growth rates of 6-7 percent to absorb new entrants into the
labor market and generate greater wealth for all.

24. 
To achieve stronger growth rates, Morocco will need a structural transformation
of its economy, with a focus on broadening economic opportunities. These include a more
stable macroeconomic environment, 
trade and exchange rate policies 
that support the
competitiveness of Moroccan products, an improved business environment with a financial
sector that better serves smaller and newer firms, more opportunities for private investment
across all sectors, a labor force that is better trained and more productive, and a reduction in
Morocco's reliance upon and inefficient use of natural resources (e.g. groundwater, imported
fossil fuels).

25. 
A more stable macroeconomic environment can only come with a more diversified
and resilient economy. Morocco's reliance on a few sectors (for example, agriculture,
tourism, and phosphates) and on fragile and deteriorating natural resources, which are often
exported without much local transformation and to a few markets (such as the Euro zone),
makes it particularly vulnerable to internal and external shocks. The further development of
agro-industry, along with a comprehensive program 
to modernize 
irrigation and adapt
agriculture practices and crops to a changing climate, would further protect Morocco against
such shocks. In addition, Morocco's dependence on fossil fuels and energy imports makes its
economy vulnerable to global price fluctuations, while its significant potential in renewable
energy (wind and solar) and in energy efficiency, including in transport, remain largely
untapped.

26. 
Trade and exchange rate policies must support competitiveness and integration in
global value chains. While export development plans are in place and Morocco has adopted an
ambitious agenda with regard to free trade agreements, especially vis-i-vis the EU, the
implementation of comprehensive 
investment climate reforms, increased productivity and
reduced trade and investment barriers will be required to ensure deeper integration with global
markets. In recent years Morocco has invested in robust trade reforms, notably in customs, and
in major and successful transshipment activities. Yet trade costs remain relatively high, mostly
due to supply chain inefficiencies, 
in particular among Maghreb countries. Modernizing
logistics services can better connect Morocco to global value chains. Morocco also needs to
shift progressively to a flexible exchange rate regime that would better support its export
strategies and help increase resilience to external and internal shocks.

27. 
Implementing a comprehensive global integration agenda would require greater
government efforts to coordinate and execute economic integration initiatives. Strategic
reform areas will include foreign investment policy and investment protection, services trade

7

liberalization, competition policy, and consumer protection-all areas in which Morocco has
room for improvement. This may require lifting government coordination to a higher position
in the political hierarchy and establishing administrative units within the civil service to
support the transition. Drawing best practices from successful experiences in Poland, Serbia,
Slovenia, and Turkey could help Morocco build the institutions and 
implementation
mechanisms needed to promote effective integration.

28. Morocco's financial sector could be more diversified and better serve SMEs and
new firms. Morocco has a fairly diversified financial system that grew rapidly over the past
decade. Financial system assets as a percentage of GDP have reached levels comparable to
some high-income countries. 1 3 Morocco's financial system has therefore performed well in
mobilizing savings for the formation of capital. However, finance functions pertaining to
allocating and monitoring capital inhibit growth. At this stage of Morocco's development, a
better mix between banking and capital markets might help increase diversity among investors,
improve transparency in capital decisions, and foster good corporate governance. Raising the
proportion of equity capital in the financial structure of particular SMEs, by facilitating access
to external finance, could also enhance creditworthiness. Finally, implementing G-20 financial
system reforms will naturally give capital markets a greater role in providing long-term
financing to the economy.

29. 
An environment more conducive to starting and growing businesses would boost
economic activity and provide needed opportunities for disadvantaged youth and women
entrepreneurs. Despite some business environment reforms, 
the 
legal and regulatory
environment in many respects still does not facilitate the creation or formalization of small
enterprises. The unpredictable application of rules by the bureaucracy and the courts, together
with numerous administrative instructions and circulars, create an opaque and overly complex
environment that discourages informal businesses from formalizing. As a result, informality
rates are high in Morocco, with most informal workers being in small firms that engage in low-
productivity activities.14 SMEs also commonly face barriers 
in access to land, finance,
information, and support. These challenges were brought up emphatically throughout CPS
consultations by young entrepreneurs and women who are most affected by these constraints.

30. 
Upgrading the skills of the 
labor force would 
improve productivity and
employment rates in Morocco. This issue has worsened in recent years, with 35 percent of
firms pointing to difficulties 
in identifying skilled workers as an important constraint,
compared to 20 percent in 2004.15 This lack of skills is due to inadequate education (for the
new labor force) and a lack of continued education (for the existing labor stock). During CPS
consultations, participants expressed frustration with 
the mismatch between academic
programs and employment opportunities, particularly the limited relevance of educational
curricula in today's job market.

31. 
Labor regulations and comparatively high payroll taxes discourage the emergence
of a dynamic labor force and formal employment, disproportionately affecting youth and
women. Morocco's highly restrictive fixed-term contract 
laws and heavy employment
regulations and costs constitute important obstacles to firms that seek to adjust their staffing to
cope with new demand, technologies, and economic shocks. With one of the highest minimum

8

wagesl6 in the world and relatively high payroll taxes, the cost of formal labor is inflated in
Morocco. As a result, businesses prefer to remain informal to minimize labor costs and
rigidities, which negatively affects the quality ofjobs available to young people and women.

Sustainable growth forfuture generations

32. 
Stronger health and education outcomes would boost Morocco's economic growth.
11 percent of economic growth and 25 percent of total income growth in developing countries
during 2000-2011 could be traced to health improvements alone. 17 Early interventions in health
and education are key to ensuring a healthy and productive workforce for Morocco's future.
Malnutrition, in particular, impairs cognitive development in early childhood and limits
learning, performance, productivity, and earnings later in adult life. In addition, the rise of
NCDs has significant consequences for future health spending and labor productivity.

33. 
A more sustainable use of natural resources will help to ensure they continue to be
available to future generations. At issue is the overexploitation of Morocco's natural capital
base on which the economy relies heavily and which is vulnerable to climate change.
Agriculture and fisheries (accounting for nearly 20 percent of GDP) face land and water
resource constraints; aquifers are being overexploited to provide water for irrigation and, to a
lesser extent, industry; and the sustained growth of the tourism sector relies on coastal and
marine assets that are also under pressure. Morocco is also particularly vulnerable to climate
change: global warming and a decline in rainfall will negatively affect already scarce water
resources, and have serious implications for the many industries that rely upon them.'8

34. 
Actions taken by Morocco to mitigate the potential impact of natural hazards will
decrease threats to sustainable growth. Morocco is susceptible to destructive earthquakes, as
well as flooding, droughts, and rising sea levels, all of which are expected to worsen due to
climate change with potential impacts likely to be exacerbated by urbanization. Greater
Casablanca, for example, is becoming increasingly prone to flooding, coastal erosion, and
marine inundation. Rural areas are also vulnerable. A majority of Morocco's farms are small,
semi-subsistence, and largely rain-fed, hence at risk of losses in the face of recurrent droughts.

B. Addressing Social and Economic Exclusion

35. 
Reducing inequality and exclusion is a prerequisite for a stronger economy in the
long term. Great disparities still exist in access to social and economic opportunities and
services between coastal and interior regions, urban, peri-urban and rural areas, within rural
areas, and among different segments of the population. During CPS consultations, civil society
representatives from marginalized or remote regions complained about the lack of political will
to implement social and infrastructure programs that would sustainably 
improve living
conditions at the local level. These concerns were at the heart of the protest movement that led
to the 2011 constitutional reforms.

36. 
Improving the prospects of the rural poor requires sustainable farming practices,
higher incomes, and more diverse income opportunities. Farming is the main source of
income in rural areas, and for the vast majority it consists of semi-subsistence farming of low
productivity and quality on small lands. Women's work on such farms is often unrecognized or

16 Equivalent to 70% of average wages in 2011.

18 These include hydropower generation capacity, rainfed agriculture yields, and water for irrigation, fisheries, and tourism.

unpaid. Small farmers face significant constraints, including land titling issues and land
fragmentation, limited farmer organization, unpredictable rainfall, marginal land, and limited
access to markets. Highlighting the dualist nature and inequality of the agriculture sector, fewer
than one percent of farmers have very profitable, commercial, and export-oriented farms,
representing 14 percent of cultivated land. Increased value added from irrigation water and
crops produced, 
improved agriculture value chain management and commercialization
practices, reform of extension services, and promotion of local transformation through agro-
industry would ensure that better sector performance translates into higher incomes for all.
Promoting aquaculture and ecotourism activities would provide alternative income sources in
marginal and mountainous rural areas while reducing pressure on natural resources.

37. 
Integrated, participatory development approaches are needed to improve rural
access to social and infrastructure services. Experience demonstrates that truly integrated
and participatory rural development approaches are critical to improving living conditions and
creating economic opportunities in rural areas. Achieving better service levels in a given area
calls for concerted and coordinated multi-sector approaches centered on harmonized planning.
The challenge for Government is to bridge sector divides and support the local level (e.g.
communes) to find innovative ways of providing services in rural areas.

38. With half of Morocco's population living 
in cities, improving urban service
delivery is a key priority for the Government. Urban and peri-urban centers face uneven
access to city services such as solid waste management, public transportation, water, sanitation,
and sewerage infrastructure, highlighting the need for structured and integrated programs to
upgrade or expand services in response to the needs of growing urban populations. To that
effect, the technical and financial capacity of municipalities needs to be enhanced, and public
funds need to be allocated for key services that are not currently being delivered, including
through performance-based partnerships with public or private service providers. In addition,
ICT and e-government services can help play a key role in promoting more effective,
transparent and equitable delivery of services.

39. 
Local governments, the primary citizen interface for a majority of basic services,
will require significant strengthening. Limited access to information and space for voice
limits opportunities 
to enhance public and private service provision. Local government
capacity and community organization need to be strengthened and combined with local
participatory governance and community-driven development approaches to decide on and
deliver solutions that ensure quality service to all citizens. In parallel, central and local
government resources need to be allocated according to local priorities.

40. 
Creating opportunities for young people who are disproportionately excluded
from the economy and have limited voice is an important challenge. More than half of
young people are inactive, neither in school nor employed. While unemployment rates are
higher for more educated youth, a vast majority of unemployed young people have not
completed middle school or are illiterate.1 9 A staggering 82 percent of girls drop out of school
and are not in the labor force due to family reasons or discouragement. Most employed young
people work in the informal sector with few, if any, benefits and under precarious conditions.
Government employment policies have focused primarily on supporting university graduates -
an approach that has had only limited impact on youth employment. A diagnostic on 11
countries 20 highlighted the issue of employability (the mismatch between the available

19 63 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

10

workforce and available jobs) and its links to the lack of information sharing between the
education sector and the job market, the lack of data on placement rates per education type, and
the poor quality of job intermediation. Additional efforts need to be made to partner with the
private sector and to work with youth groups, schools, and other local organizations to develop
programs that more effectively keep young people active, particularly by better informing and
equipping them for the future.

41. 
Shortcomings 
in the implementation of the legal framework undermine the
economic, social, and political status of women. Social norms exclude women socially and
economically, leading to social phenomena such as harassment and domestic violence, for
which there is no comprehensive legislation. In addition to gaps in the legal framework,
women are affected by limited application of existing legislation, caused by weak institutional
capacity and selective enforcement by public officials influenced by social norms. In particular,
some social norms restrict women's ability to exercise newly acquired rights, further limiting
their economic, social, and political participation. Women's access to top management
positions is limited both in the professional and political arena.

42. 
Efficient subsidy and targeted safety net programs are needed to better support
disadvantaged and excluded Moroccans. The current social protection system is not
effective in fighting poverty, as it favors primarily the wealthiest households and supply chain
networks. Data from 2012 show that the richest 25 percent of Morocco's households benefit
from 46.7 percent of all butane subsidies and around 40 percent of all liquid fuel subsidies. 2 1
At the same time, social assistance programs remain limited in scope, fragmented, and poorly
targeted, while the social insurance system has limited coverage and displays ad hoc financing
mechanisms and redistributive arrangements that increase the cost of formal employment and
make the system financially unsustainable and inequitable. The challenge for the Government
is to raise awareness about the advantages of reforming these programs in order to expand their
coverage, improve their targeting, and promote program integration while assisting the sector
stakeholders who are most affected. In particular, the Government needs to reach consensus on
how best to sequence and apply subsidy and safety net reforms.

C. Strengthening Governance and Institutions for Better Public Interventions

43. 
Improving public sector governance and the capacity of institutions and service
providers is critical to ensuring effective and inclusive public interventions. Access to
basic public services is central to sustained poverty reduction and to the promotion of shared
prosperity. Indeed, the poorest segments of the population are particularly dependent, and
therefore vulnerable, to any discretion or quality deficiencies in public service provision. Lack
of access to these basic services has a direct effect on citizens' living conditions and
purchasing power. To remedy this, 
the Constitution has mandated the government to
implement reforms to make institutions more accountable and transparent in the delivery of
public services at the local level, including through decentralization and fiscal transfers.

44. 
At the central level, a key priority is improving public sector governance,
including strengthening accountability and transparency in the management of public
resources. The budget is considered opaque, insufficiently strategic, highly fragmented, and
difficult 
to monitor and evaluate. Similarly, the process for fiscal 
transfers 
is highly

21 Wealth being determined by consumption quintile, World Bank estimates, Verme, Araar and Gadiry-Barry, 2012.

11

prescriptive and rigid with the result that spending is not as effective as it could be. 2 2 To
address these challenges, the organic budget law is being revised to introduce performance-
based budgeting. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) represent two-thirds of public investment and
half of public expenditures and play an important role in delivering services and implementing
public policy. As such, the Government has embarked on a program to modernize the
governance of SOEs to promote more efficient service delivery.

45. Morocco's health sector 
illustrates some of the governance challenges that
undermine access to services and their quality. The system faces a critical shortage of
health personnel, who are often poorly trained, do not report to work, and are not equitably
distributed, particularly to health facilities in rural areas. There is also no system for regulating
or evaluating the quality of health care providers and no program for career management.
Many health care facilities are poorly operated, lack legitimacy and are not accountable to
patients. Drug policies and controls are weak (prices of drugs are inconsistent and leakages
occur). At the institutional level, different actors have overlapping functions, or one institution
may do more than it is mandated to do.

46. Morocco's procurement system also needs to be modernized. It would benefit from
greater transparency, accountability, and efficiency to align with international good practices
and to effectively reduce the risk of corruption.2 3 The revision of the procurement decree at the
end of 2013, harmonizing the application of public procurement across all government entities,
is a welcome first step.

47. 
The new Constitution introduced the principle of open governance by granting
citizens the right to information, to public consultation, and to petition the Government
and Parliament. The Government has launched a number of initiatives in this regard, which
strengthen voice and public participation but that need to be translated into dedicated policies
applied across the public sector. These reforms, including a new access to information law,
take time to implement and will require education and communication campaigns to raise
awareness and change behaviors. To facilitate this process, the Government is seeking to
further develop e-government solutions, as illustrated by the Watiqa 24 platform.

48. 
At the local level, governance reforms should aim to improve access to and quality
of service delivery, by listening to users and making service providers more accountable.
What matters most to citizens is receiving services whose cost, timeliness, and reliability is
acceptable. Many of these services are provided primarily at the decentralized level, either by
municipalities or other decentralized government entities. To guarantee that such services are
efficiently delivered and relevant to the user, infrastructure bottlenecks need to be addressed,
tariff issues (for example, in water, sanitation, and electricity) resolved, and greater voice in
service delivery discussions allowed at the local level. Public services need to be modernized
and more accessible to citizens. Strengthening the private sector's role in infrastructure assets
and service delivery, through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and greater competition,
would also help ensure proper, cost-efficient, and sustainable management of good-quality
service delivery.

Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy

49. 

The Government's strategic priorities mirror in great part the principles, changes,
and actions prescribed by the new Constitution. This was detailed in the Head of
Government's January 2012 speech, which laid out the Government's 2012-2016 program. The
latter reflects constitutional priorities such as inclusion, reinforcement of good governance
principles, human rights, and protection of individual freedoms, as well as institutional
responsibility and accountability, sustainable development, and the move toward a more
decentralized system of governance.

50. 
The Government's program is structured around five mutually-reinforcing
pillars: (I) deepening national identity, preserving social cohesion and diversity, and openness;
(II) consolidating the rule of law, strengthening good governance, democratic participation and
advancement of regionalization and decentralization, in the context of accountability and true
citizenship; 
(III) pursuing strong, competitive, multi-sector, diversified, wealth- and
employment-generating, and equitable economic growth; (IV) promoting social programs
guaranteeing equitable access to basic services and strengthening solidarity and equal
opportunities across citizens, generations, and regions; and (V) Consolidation of the country's
regional and international credibility and promotion of public services aimed at Moroccans
living abroad. Based on the WBG's comparative advantages and aim of ensuring selective
support to those areas of the Government program that will most effectively address the key
development challenges identified, the CPS program seeks most directly to support three of
these pillars (II, III and IV) (Figure 2).

regional and international credibility, as

well as support to Moroccans abroad

51. 
Under Pillar II, the Government is pursuing governance reforms focused on the
delivery of public services, access to information and public consultation, tax reform,
budget reform, advanced regionalization (that is, decentralization), and a better-
functioning justice sector. A common goal of these governance reforms is to improve the
effectiveness of public policies and the delivery of public services to all citizens. This is being
pursued through an integrated, holistic program of governance reforms using mutually
reinforcing reform levers across the public sector, covering the central administration, SOEs,
and local governments. Over the last decade, Morocco has invested heavily to improve local
service delivery. Several national sector plans have directed large amounts of funding to
infrastructure for local services in the form of financial incentives for investment and
professionalizing services (mostly through PPPs), in particular in sanitation (Programme
National d'Assainissement), solid waste management (Programme National des Dchets
Menagers), urban transport, urban upgrading (Mise i Niveau urbaine), and rural electrification.
Although programs to universalize access to services have been fairly successful, about two
million people in low-income peri-urban areas still do not have water or sanitation services. In
parallel, the new constitutional rights on access to information and public participation aim to
create a more open and inclusive government to foster voice and accountability. Public
financial management and public sector reforms aim to strengthen public institutions and
accountability in the use of public resources in order to improve the delivery and efficiency of
public services. Decentralization reforms focus on strengthening local governance and bringing
the most relevant and efficient services to citizens, based on the principle of subsidiarity that
decisions should be taken as close as possible to the citizens.

52. 
Under this pillar, the Government also seeks to improve economic and financial
governance. Strengthening the Competition Council, improving governance in SOEs, putting
in place more transparent and performance-based budgeting, reforming public procurement,
rebalancing the pension system through parametric reforms, and implementing fiscal transfers
to local governments are key efforts in this regard.

53. 
Under Pillar III, the Government seeks to improve economic productivity. To this
end, Morocco continues 
to 
implement key

sector-specific strategies consisting mainly of 
Selected Targets
tax incentives 
to sectors with high growth
potential, 
combined 
with 
dedicated 
infrastructure 
investments, simplification of 
administrative procedures, and broader access 
to 
financing. Several strategies have been 
adopted 
covering 
the main 
sectors 
that 
Morocco wishes to develop, such as agriculture 
(through the Plan Maroc Vert), ICT (through 
Plan Maroc Numeric), and tourism (Plan Azur 
and Vision 2020). An ambitious 
industrial 
strategy was launched in 2005 and continues to 
be implemented under the "National Pact of 

As part of its program, the Government set out
to achieve the following targets by 2016:
* Growth rate of 5.5 percent
* Inflation rate of 2 percent
* Reduction of unemployment rate to 8 percent

pillars: offshoring, automobiles, aeronautics, electronics, textile and leather, agro-industry,

.

. Greater support to SMEs

SME competitiveness, investment climate, training, and industrial zones.

14

54. 
Sustainable management of natural resources is also a key component of Pillar III.
The Government has made the green growth agenda a top priority. The Framework Law on
Environment and Sustainable Development, approved in January 2013, defines the rights and
obligations of the state and citizens for the protection and preservation of the environment and
sustainable development; establishes 
the "Police de 
l'Environnement" to strengthen
environmental control and inspection; introduces a green tax (the "fiscalit verte"); and
promotes waste reduction, reuse, and recycling with a view to achieving more productive and
resilient use of environmental assets. The Government is currently preparing a national strategy
for the sustainable management of natural resources.

55. 
Pillar IV is focused on improving social indicators and economic opportunities.
Through continued support to employment creation programs and the introduction of new
programs to insert the unemployed into business and associations, the Government aims to
reduce the employment rate to 8 percent by 2016. Other priorities include improving
Morocco's weakest health indicators, such as infant and maternal mortality; addressing the
growing challenge of NCDs; improving service quality across the health sector; and reducing
the financial burden on households and protecting them from impoverishment due to out-of-
pocket health expenditures. A particular emphasis on promoting women's social and economic
opportunities, including through participation, is also stressed under this Pillar. More generally,
human development remains a priority for the Government, supported heavily through the
National Initiative for Human Development (INDH). More than ever, the importance of
fulfilling the goals of the Education Charter, and in particular promoting better governance and
quality in the education sector, has been recognized as one of the Government's top priorities.
56. 
Social solidarity, equity, and inclusion are all emphasized under this pillar, with a
special focus on poor and vulnerable households. The Government seeks to move from
channeling support to the population through universal energy and food subsidies to more
efficient, targeted safety nets. In September 2013, the Government embarked on an important
reform to progressively phase out all fuel subsidies except butane, which is used predominately
by the poor. The Government is considering how best to move forward with a broad parallel
reform of the more cost-effective and better-targeted social assistance program. Broadening the
array of citizens that can benefit from the pension system is also an important feature of the
program Finally, continued expansion of basic infrastructure services such as water, sanitation,
electricity, roads, and ICT, including mobile phone and Internet services, to remote and
underserved areas remains a government priority.

III. BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

Lessons Learned from the Previous CPS and Stakeholder Feedback

A. Lessons from the CPS Progress and Completion Reports

57. 
The FY10-13 CPS concentrated on 
three strategic pillars: 
(i) growth,
competitiveness and employment; (ii) service delivery to citizens; and (iii) sustainable
development 
in a changing climate, supported by the two crosscutting beams of
governance and territoriality. A CPS Progress Report was prepared in 2012 to assess
implementation progress and make mid-course adjustments, 
in particular to bring new
emphasis to the themes of inclusion, governance, accountability, voice, and opportunity.

58. 
The WBG's performance in designing and implementing the CPS program was
rated good in the CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). The evaluation highlighted the
relevance of the strategy's highly flexible design as social, political, and economic

15

transformation took hold in Morocco and the broader MENA region over the course of the CPS
period. The CPS made use of a unique mix of instruments to support implementation of the
Government's ambitious reform agenda, backed up by a well-designed results matrix that
closely linked expected CPS outcomes to the outcomes of planned interventions and struck a
practical balance between flexibility and specificity. WBG implementation of the CPS program
was characterized by largely satisfactory project outcomes, disbursements above the regional
average despite significantly expanded lending commitments, increased IFC investment in key
sectors, a strong program of analytical and advisory activities, and close and effective
partnerships with the Government, development partners, foreign investors, regional players,
and nongovemment stakeholders in the country.

59. 
The CPSCR concludes that good progress was made toward achieving most CPS
proposed outcomes. The CPSCR rates program performance as moderately satisfactory, with
notable achievements in private and financial sector reform, access to education, addressing
vulnerability and social exclusion, agriculture 
sector management, and solid waste
management (SWM). Substantial progress was made toward most other expected outcomes,
though some targets on water management, energy and health sector reforms, and climate
change adaptation were not achieved. In general, successful CPS interventions enjoyed high-
level government ownership and 
integration with government programs; participatory
approaches; effective technical assistance (TA); and well-specified, operationally integrated,
and regularly monitored outcome indicators. In a few areas (such as the competitiveness
program), momentum was slowed by the additional challenges associated with interagency
coordination and under the auspices of new multi-sector DPLs, by low government staffing, or
as a result of imperfectly specified targets.

60. 
Lessons from the CPSCR have informed the design of the FY14-17 CPS. WBG
engagement in strategic areas such as competitiveness, governance, green growth, social
protection, and service delivery remains relevant and has been scaled up in pursuit of
promoting shared prosperity and eliminating poverty. The integration of gender and youth
across CPS pillars and activities is maintained and further deepened through discrete new
interventions. This CPS retains the previous strategy's flexible model, which successfully
allowed the WBG to adjust its program as needed to respond to emerging priorities. Although
significant sector advancements were made through single-sector DPLs under the previous
CPS, the CPSCR pointed out the importance of supporting more ambitious second-generation
reforms with cross-sectoral dimensions while continuing to focus on service provision,
strengthening coordination to achieve tangible results, and enhancing citizen participation. This
approach responds to the Government's request for more multi-sector programs to help tackle
more complex, multidimensional problems. Building on the previous CPS focus on a wide
reform agenda, under this CPS, the WBG will bring more focus to implementation support,
with a more balanced portfolio of instruments (relying less heavily on DPLs). Given the
positive experience with Morocco's first Program for Results (PforR) operation, approved for
the INDH2 in 2012, together with the Government's interest in managing for results, the WBG
will mobilize this new instrument to achieve a more balanced, results-focused program, in
conjunction with continued DPL and investment lending support where appropriate. In terms
of investment lending, the CPSCR confirmed that many operations encountered challenges
with implementation readiness, which delayed the pace of procurement and disbursement,
particularly in the first year of implementation. This issue has proved particularly acute with
grant-financed operations. Overall, the CPSCR concludes that the FY1O-13 CPS was generally
implemented as planned and reached a majority of the intended results.

16

B. Client Feedback and Stakeholder Consultations

61. 
The WBG carried out comprehensive and inclusive in-country consultations in
2013 through formal conferences and bilateral meetings with the Government, civil
society, private sector, academia, and development partners, at both the central and
regional level. A wide variety of development stakeholders were invited to provide feedback,
comments, and recommendations around key themes of WBG involvement in Morocco. They
were asked to offer their views on the new partnership framework with regard to Morocco's
development priorities. A dedicated web space was created to keep stakeholders informed
about the CPS process and invite further comments.

62. 
Civil society recommendations have been critical to the WBG's dialogue with the
Moroccan Government and have helped to frame the orientation of the CPS. Civil society
representatives have provided valuable feedback based on their experience on the ground and
their knowledge of major bottlenecks in key sectors, and have made constructive proposals to
enhance the WBG's support to the Government. The following are key recommendations made
by civil society.

63. Morocco's civil society constitutes a vibrant and growing development stakeholder
whose field presence and experience are invaluable. Its capacity and expertise should be
strengthened to more effectively deliver on the ground. One of the most common demands
made by civil society organizations during CPS consultations was the chance to be involved in
Morocco's development programs from inception to implementation, including in the decision-
making process. They requested 
that 
their role be better recognized and 
taken 
into
consideration in development policies and reforms at the local and national level.

64. 
Governance is at the heart of Morocco's development challenges. In virtually all
consultations held, civil society stakeholders pointed to weak governance mechanisms as a key
cause of public service failures to deliver on promised results, despite the involvement in some
cases of substantial financial resources. Stakeholders advocated for urgent collective action to
upgrade governance norms and guidelines in all public facilities and services, mirroring a
strong demand among street protesters in 2011: combating corruption, privilege, and rent
seeking.

65. 
In particular, there was a request for increased transparency and participation at
all levels of decision making. Be it at a central or local, sectoral or administrative level,
Morocco's governance system will gain in efficiency and performance if managed through the
prism of transparency, participation, and accountability, according to stakeholders. This is seen
as the thrust of the new Constitution.

66. 
The performance of public services, and social programs in particular, falls well
below people's expectations, especially in lagging regions and some urban and peri-urban
areas. Training, education, and capacity building for civil society, young people, rural women,
and local authorities are needed to equip citizens with adequate knowledge and competences to
become effective actors in an open society.2 5 Stakeholders called on the WBG to support
efforts to provide more economic opportunities, combat corruption and nepotism, and promote
entrepreneurship and private sector development.

25 An open society is understood as a flexible and tolerant society that is based on the rule of law and justice, individual
responsibility, accountability, transparency, freedom of information and participation, and that promotes fairness in political,
legal and economic systems, as well as equal opportunities for all.

Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy

A. World Bank Group Partnership Strategy Overview

67. 
The WBG, through its renewed partnership with Morocco, seeks to selectively
deepen 
its support for a more open society and sustainable economic and social
opportunities for all Moroccans. The CPS builds on the strategic areas of cooperation under
the 2010 CPS, as well as selective themes introduced in the 2012 CPS Progress Report in
response to the 2011 Constitution. This support includes promoting a more competitive
economy, creating employment, improving service delivery to citizens, greening growth, and
increasing the focus on voice and accountability, particularly in local governance, by bringing
citizens into decision-making processes. Within these themes, the WBG team focused on three
areas of strategic engagement with the aim of achieving, through tailored packages of services,
14 selective outcomes directly linked to the WBG goals (Annex 1).

68. 
The new CPS will increase the focus on competitive growth to create much-needed
jobs, while ensuring that growth is sustainable, inclusive, and responsive to the WBG's
twin objectives of boosting shared prosperity and eradicating extreme poverty. The WBG
will scale up its support for Morocco's green growth agenda, supporting innovative multisector
approaches to sustainable and environmentally sound development, for the benefit of future
generations and to reduce the country's vulnerability to shocks. The strategy also brings a new
focus to improving governance and service delivery, with increased support for more efficient,
transparent, and inclusive governance arrangements across all levels of government (central to
local), as well as in state-owned and private enterprises responsible for ensuring equitable
access and quality of services. Promoting citizens' voice and participation is integral to these
efforts, as is the focus on gender and youth.

69. 
The CPS retains a flexible approach while increasing the focus on multisector
operations to better respond to Morocco's development challenges. While the CPS
program has been designed to achieve specific objectives and outcomes, the program is
indicative and there is some flexibility to address any unforeseen or newly emerging priorities
that may arise in Morocco. In particular, the detailed program of support and the coverage of
milestones will give greater focus to the first two years of the CPS period, namely FY14-15. A
CPS Progress Report will define the milestones for the remaining period, namely FY16-17,
allowing for mid-term adaptation based on the latest conditions. The focus on transversal and
multisector operations will reduce what has at times been a fragmented and narrow sector
approach. This is expected to enable the WBG to support Morocco's more ambitious reforms.
A detailed Results Framework is presented in Annex 2.

70. 
On this basis, three strategic results areas are proposed as an organizing
framework for the new CPS program (Figure 3):

* Result Area 1: Promoting Competitive and Inclusive Growth
* Result Area 2: Building a Green and Resilient Future
* Result Area 3: Strengthening Governance and Institutions for Improved Service
Delivery to All Citizens

71. 
Because of their sensitivity and recognized importance to Morocco's development,
the CPS proposes to maintain or raise the visibility of three crosscutting themes
throughout its program: (i) gender, (ii) youth, and (iii) voice and participation.

B. Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending Activities

Results Area 1: Promoting Competitive and Inclusive Growth

72. 

Under this Results Area, the WBG will support the Government of Morocco in its
efforts to achieve a more competitive economy in which the benefits of growth are shared

by all. The WBG will support policies and interventions 
that promote investment 
in
competitive sectors as one channel for accelerating Morocco's growth potential to further
reduce poverty; and strengthen the business environment and financial sector to encourage and
accompany entrepreneurs and emerging businesses, 
facilitate 
the participation of all
Moroccans, including the rural poor, women and young people, in the economy, and ensure a
greater role for the private sector. (See Annex 1 which discusses the proposed pLqgram.
xpected outcomes and impact on WBG Goals).

Strategic Outcome oti Enhance the business environment with a more supportive
institution aframework for business entry, trade facilitation and SME development

Link to twin goals: This outcome will boost economic activity to help create jobs and is
linked to the goal of boosting shared prosperity.

73. 

Business environment. Efforts to improve the business environment were initiated
under the Economic Competitiveness Support Program (ECSP) DPL series and associated

19

technical and advisory assistance, and will be pursued under a second ECSP operation (FY15).
The ECSP series will be complemented by dedicated assistance, several parallel studies, and
additional TA. For instance, a new Country Economic Memorandum (FY14/15) will examine
opportunities to promote a more open society and thus reignite Morocco's economic dynamism
to set it on a higher and more inclusive growth path. Joint Bank-IFC TA will continue to be
dedicated 
to 
institutional 
strengthening of 
the Competition Council (Conseil de 
la
Concurrence), increasing 
the 
transparency with which 
the 
Investment Commission
(Commission des Investissements) grants 
incentives, and strengthening public-private
coordination in designing investment climate reforms through the public-private National
Business Environment Committee (ComWit National de l'Environnement des Affaires, CNEA).

74. 
Trade facilitation. A study on trade and integration with the EU will further inform the
understanding of, and future support to, the competitiveness agenda. Morocco's first-ever
reimbursable TA initiative is exploring how the establishment of a new Moroccan Investment
Agency could help provide adequate tools for supporting public and private investments in
strategic projects in productive and transformative sectors such as agribusiness. TA on ICT-
enabled business process outsourcing (BPO) will help the country cement its status as a
destination for foreign investment in areas such as call centers and software development. The
WBG will provide TA to the transport sector, potentially through the Deauville MENA
Transition Fund (DTF), to focus on logistics, public-private partnerships in transport, an
assessment of transit along the trans-Maghreb corridor, the competitiveness of the national
railway, and the trucking industry. Additional TA in logistics will support the newly created
Moroccan Agency for the Development of Logistics (AMDL), urban logistics, customs
reforms, and collaboration with other international financial institutions. In addition, IFC will
continue to support a public-private initiative in collaboration with AMDL and the private
sector to improve youth employability and the sector's overall competitiveness.

75. 
Entrepreneurship and SME development. The World Bank and IFC will pursue an
integrated approach to facilitate entrepreneurship and SME development. The MENA MSME
Technical Assistance Facility, a joint World Bank-IFC led project, will continue to provide TA
to governments, regulators, financial institutions, and micro, small, and medium enterprises
(MSMEs) in Morocco. Additional support for microenterprises, microfinance institutions, and
their enabling environment will be provided under a Microfinance Development Project
(FY14), financed by the DTF. A new procurement framework enabling greater participation of
SMEs in public contracts and systematic publication of awards is also receiving TA through an
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. IFC will complement the Bank's support to SMEs
by investing in financial intermediaries, SME funds, and microfinance institutions. IFC will
continue to implement a sizeable advisory program in MSME finance, business environment,
skills development and corporate governance program, which 
is critical to strengthen
companies' ability to attract investment and promote economic development.

Strategic Outcome 1.2. Improve access to finance, with a particular focus on low income
households, micro, small and young firms, and youth and women

Link 
to 
twin goals: This outcome will help create more opportunities for young
entrepreneurs and boost shared prosperity.

76. Micro and SME finance. These priorities will be supported through several WBG
instruments: (i) the programmatic DPL series (FY14-16) 
in support of capital market
development and SME access to finance; (ii) the Microfinance Development Project, which
will promote access to finance among low-income households, MSMEs, and women; (iii) an

20

IFC microfinance investment and advisory program that will continue to support the three main
microfinance institutions, enhancing their resilience and diversifying their product offerings to
improve their ability to manage risks and to scale up their outreach, particularly to women and
youth, in a sustainable manner; (iv) the ongoing MSME Development Project, which provides
partial credit guarantees 
to SMEs and 
is nearly fully disbursed after 18 months of
implementation due to high uptake of the credit guarantee for very small enterprises,
confirming needs in this area and opening up the possibility of a follow-on operation; (v)
training to 
improve the financial 
literacy of women and youth and for microfinance
institutions, supported through a regional TA program on enhancing microfinance for women
and youth; and (vi) Bank TA and lending to provide innovative entrepreneurs with capital and
support adapted to the risk profile of early-stage ventures. As one of the priority areas of its
engagement in Morocco, IFC will continue 
to support SMEs by investing in financial
intermediaries, private equity funds targeting high-growth SMEs, and through microfinance
institutions that provide access to finance mostly to women and young entrepreneurs

77. 
Capital market development. The programmatic DPL series mentioned above will
support capital market development by promoting more sophisticated financing tools that
optimize domestic and foreign investment allocations in productive and innovative sectors.

Strategic Outcome 1.3 Increase the productivity and value-added of the agri-food sector

Link to twin goals: This outcome will increase revenues for farmers, thereby boosting
prosperity and reducing poverty in rural areas.

78. 
The Bank will continue to support the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), which seeks to double
the agriculture sector's value-added and supports activities to integrate commercial and small
farmers into domestic and international markets. The Bank will continue to support the PMV
components that aim to enhance farmers' 
income through better techniques, skills, and
knowledge support, and IFC will continue to promote private agribusiness investments to
maximize outreach to farmers and help increase and diversify rural incomes. In line with the
PMV DPL series, the Bank will further support the expansion of drip irrigation and associated
improvements in the value chain and farmers' organizations through additional lending. 2 6 In
the outer years of the CPS, new lending, possibly though PforR operations, and programmatic
economic and sector work (ESW) is envisaged to support further agriculture modernization
(including restructuring of the Department of Agriculture's decentralized services at the
regional level, establishment of regional irrigation utilities to improve service to farmers,
establishment of agro-industrial areas and 
trade and commercialization platforms, and
sustainable approaches to improve the livelihoods of small famers27 ). Focus on productive
adaptation of Morocco's agriculture sector to climate change will also continue under the
ongoing GEF-funded Social and Integrated Agriculture (ASIMA), Integrating Climate Change
in the Implementation of the PMV (PICCPMV) and Integrated Management of Coastal Zones
(GIZC) projects, as well as the new Inclusive Green Growth (IGG) DPL series

26 Additional financing to the Modernization of Irrigated Agriculture in the Oum Er Rbia River Basin project (FY15).
27 Pillar 2 of the PMV program.

21

Strategic Outcome 1.4. Better leverage the socioeconomic potential of integrated rural
development and tourism

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help create new economic opportunities in rural areas
thereby boosting shared prosperity.

79. 
Integrated Rural Development. Building on its past support to the implementation of
the Rural Development Strategy, as well as from Integrated Rural Development projects
financed by the IFAD and EU, the Bank will support rural development in targeted regions of
Morocco, through a new PforR operation aiming to (i) promote local economic opportunities in
agriculture and off-farm sectors, especially for women; (ii) ensure an integrated approach,
coordinated at the provincial level, in order to decentralize decisions on resource allocation
closer to the population to further the process of de-concentration and decentralization; (iii)
strengthen the capacity of the "communes rurales" by reinforcing their role 
in local
development; and (iv) further the process of transfer of responsibilities to local development
associations and producer organizations. The Bank will also support efforts to diversify
economic activities through integrated rural development programs that promote linkages
between investment in agriculture and nonagriculture sectors in rural areas through the ongoing
GEF-funded GIZC project.

80. 
Tourism. A Tourism Development 
lending project 
is working to 
leverage the
socioeconomic potential of Morocco's 31 medinas and 
its rural and natural assets by
supporting the Ministry of Tourism's M'dinti and Qariati programs, which aim to diversify the
sector and create additional revenues and job opportunities through new investment and
management models on the empowerment of regions, cities, and local communities.

Strategic Outcome 1.5. Improve the reliability of electricity supply

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help ensure businesses can operate without
interruption, as part of a more competitive economy needed to create employment and boost
shared prosperity.

81. 
To ensure the electricity supply needed to meet the growing demand associated with a
stronger and more competitive economy, while increasing Morocco's energy security by
reducing its exposure to the volatile prices and subsidy burden associated with imported fossil
fuels, the WBG will support ONEE's efforts to strengthen its power transmission grid through
the ongoing ONEE Support Project, as well as Morocco's strategic development of renewable
energy capacity (see Results Area 3), regional 
integration efforts, and potential IFC
investments in the energy sector. MIGA will see to support eligible foreign investors in
renewable energy through traditional political risk insurance and new products (see para 116).

Strategic Outcome 1.6. Better match skills developed through higher education or vocational
training with the needs of the job market

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help create employment for young people and is linked
to the goal of shared prosperity

82. 
Skills training. The Skills and Employment DPL (SEDP) series, launched in FY12 and
whose second operation 
is planned for FY14, supports the Government's program of
improving skills, productivity, and quality of employment. The CPS will support efforts to
enhance the quality and relevance of higher education and vocational training through
assistance in implementing the reforms initiated under the SEDP series, as well as TA to the

22

establishment of the "Agence d'valuation universitaire" and the participation of Moroccan
universities in the CMI University Regional Network to support governance reforms. The
WBG plans to support the implementation of the new vocational training strategy that is under
preparation, aiming to develop a training system that better responds to labor market needs and
offering additional opportunities, especially to disadvantaged youth and women, through TA
and possibly lending. The Bank will support the Government in gaining tools to monitor jobs
and skills offerings 
through a National Labor Observatory, and the IFC will support
improvements in employment-based education offerings at a sectoral level. Through the E4E
Initiative for Arab Youth, IFC will work with the AMDL and the Ministry of Tourism to put in
place sector-specific labor observatories that will complement the National Labor Observatory.
Furthermore, IFC will work with the Ministry of Tourism to refine the sector's existing
qualification 
framework 
and 
design 
a 
training 
program 
to 
improve 
the
management/administration of education providers in the sector. The E4E Initiative also
focuses on providing high quality training to youth, in order to fill their skill gap and prepare
them better for the job market, as well as enhancing their career opportunities.

83. Micro-entrepreneurship. Through a DTF TA operation (FY14), the Bank will
continue to help disadvantaged youth receive micro-entrepreneurship development services
and to assist in strengthening the institutional capacity of national and local stakeholders,
including civil society organizations that work with young people. The Bank will provide
technical support to the Government in preparing and implementing an Integrated National
Youth Strategy and establishing a Consultative Council for Youth, which aims to strengthen
youth participation in policy decisions that affect them directly.

84. 
Revenue-generating activities. The Bank's flagship PforR operation supporting the
second phase of the National Human Development Initiative (INDH2) works through local
governments and community-driven development to promote services and income-generating
activities in poor areas, including for young people and women, while increasing local
communities' participation in decision making. Similarly, the IGG DPL series will promote
investments aimed at diversifying revenues and job opportunities in rural areas.

Strategic Outcome 1.7. Improve access to and effectiveness of social protection programs,
especially for youth

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help ensure that social protection reaches the most
vulnerable, to reduce poverty.

85. 
Active Labor Market Programs. The Bank will continue to support active labor
market programs for unemployed youth. Through policy dialogue and lending, the Bank plans
to support the reform agenda of the national employment and skills promotion agency
(ANAPEC), based on a four-pillar policy framework: (i) developing results-based PPPs; (ii)
improving the effectiveness of labor intermediation; (iii) developing results-based monitoring
and evaluation frameworks; and (iv) promoting entrepreneurship/self-employment, on-the-job
training, and life skills training among job seekers. Lending in outer years of the CPS period
could include an operation focused on youth employment opportunities. To offer opportunities
for less formal learning and lower barriers to labor market entry, including geographic
boundaries, time flexibility, and home-based work, the Bank will continue to support ICT
solutions and innovative ideas such as ICT-enabled micro-work (such as employing people
with limited opportunities for sustainable employment as principal workers in BPO centers,
and shifting simple outsourcing work from cities to poor rural areas for cost reduction).

23

86. 
Employment regulations. To prepare the ground for a more favorable regulatory
framework for employment creation in the formal sector (notably for youth and women), the
Bank will engage with the Government to identify reform options in the areas of labor
regulation, labor taxation, and wage-setting mechanisms (including minimum wage policy).

87. 

Social protection programs and policies. The Bank will continue to provide analytical
support on subsidies and the social protection system through a Social Protection ESW and
TA, pension TA, and poverty ESW. The Social Protection TA envisions developing the
Government's technical capacity to improve efficiency in the delivery of social safety nets by:
(i) finding alternatives to develop a national methodology to target poor households, and (ii)
proposing options to develop a unified registry of beneficiaries of social assistance programs.
Analytical work and TA on subsidies and social protection systems will continue to inform
policies to improve the targeting of beneficiaries of social safety nets and will inform the
preparation of a possible Social Protection P4R (FY16/17). Likewise, analytical work and TA
on youth inclusion will inform the design of a possible Youth and Employment Support
operation (FY16/17). The INDH2 project remains a critical pillar of the social protection
system being supported by the Bank and is expected to show good results during the CPS
period. Analytical work on gender will inform the policy dialogue on promoting the inclusion
of women, as well as the integration of gender considerations in development policy and
programs.

Results Area 2: Buildin! a Green and Resilient Future

88. 
Under this Results Area, the WBG will support Morocco's efforts to: (i) increase
the efficiency and sustainability of natural resource use, and (ii) mitigate the economy's
vulnerability to natural hazards. Poor and vulnerable groups are known to be more impacted
by common goods problems and environmental externalities. Measures aimed at improving the
sustainability of natural assets and environmental stewardship are key to ensuring equity and
shared prosperity, including from an inter-generational perspective. The WBG will support
policies and measures that enhance the management of natural assets to sustain the growth of
key sectors, including through strengthened management of soil, coastal, and water resources;
more rational production and utilization of energy; increased use of renewable energy and
resource efficiency; and more integrated and effective mechanisms to prevent and mitigate
against natural disasters and the effects of climate change.

Strategic Outcome 2.1. Strengthen management of soil, coastal, and water resources

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help ensure that natural resources are used in a
sustainable manner and is linked to both reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

89. 
Land and coastal management. Consistent with the Government's objective of
encouraging growth that is less costly for the environment, the Bank will continue to promote
industrial depollution, better soil management, integrated coastal management, and enhanced
and adapted agriculture techniques and knowledge through the ongoing GEF-financed Social
ASIMA, GIZC, PICCPMV projects, as well as through the IGG DPL series.

90. Water resources. The Bank will continue to promote wastewater treatment and reuse.
Additionally, in the context of both ongoing and new lending support to the water sector, the
Bank will support nonrevenue water reduction, desalination, and access to improved sanitation.

24

91. 
Climate change. In line with Morocco's green growth agenda, the Bank will continue
to support the analysis of climate change impacts through TA and programmatic ESW, as well
as TA on mining sector reform.

Strategic Outcome 2.2. Increase renewable energy generation and enhance energy efficiency

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help ensure that scarce resources are invested more
sustainably in the energy sector and is linked to both reducing poverty and boosting shared
prosperity.

92. 
Renewable energy. In the context of Morocco's intent to reduce its dependence on
fossil fuels, development of the country's vast renewable energy resource potential remains a
top priority for the Government. Morocco's new energy strategy targets a renewable energy
capacity of 42 percent by 2020. To maintain the momentum behind Morocco's Solar Plan, and
building upon the success of the first phase of the 500W Ouarzazate concentrated solar plant
(Noor I) project, together with the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), and many other donors, the
WBG intends to support the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy's strategy for developing the
remaining 350 MW of the solar complex through the Noor II & III project (FY15). On top of
its own financing, the WBG will help mobilize additional concessional financing (notably
through CTF funding for Concentrated Solar Power), and IFC will seek to increase private
sector participation in the implementation of future phases of the Solar Plan. A Partnership for
Market Readiness Grant (FY15) will support the establishment of national systems to measure
and manage greenhouse gas emissions in different sectors. The Bank also intends to support
the Government in pursuing regional collaboration opportunities with Maghreb and EU
countries. The country's ambitious move to greater renewable energy use requires further
reinforcement of the power system to enable 
it to absorb large amounts of renewable
generation while meeting growing demand. In that context, the Bank proposes to assist ONEE,
as operator of the power system, in coping with potential grid instability from integrating wind
and solar power at a large scale without corresponding investments through a Clean and
Efficient Energy lending project (FY15) aiming at optimizing the dispatch.

93. 
Energy efficiency. The Government has set an ambitious target of 12 percent energy
efficiency savings by 2020. Rapid growth in electricity demand has strained the operation of
existing power generation and transmission assets, leading to damaging network congestion.
To alleviate the concentration of peak coincidence of electric loads, and thus to avoid the costly
investment and heavy carbon footprint associated with additional generation, the WBG
proposes to support policy measures and investments that encourage reductions in electricity
consumption during times of peak electricity demand. This support would be provided through
the Clean and Efficient Energy project. The IGG DPL series will continue to support
institutional reforms in the energy sector through the creation of an energy regulator and
revision of the legislative framework for renewable energy. During FY14-16, IFC's advisory
services will focus on resource efficiency, namely on the implementation of projects with a
number of agribusiness companies and provision of a sector-tailored guidance manual to scale
up the adoption of cleaner production technologies through relevant aggregators (such as
industrial associations). IFC also intends to implement resource efficiency projects with a
number of companies in various sectors in the industrial zone in Casablanca. Finally, IFC will
identify technologies with high resource efficiency potential per industrial sector and design
business model(s) for wider uptake in the market.

25

Strategic Outcome 2.3. Better integrate mechanisms to prevent and mitigate against natural
disasters

Link to twin goals: This outcome will help mitigate the impact of natural disasters -- which
disproportionately affect the poor -- and is linked to the goal of reducing poverty.

94. 
The Bank plans to support the Government's efforts to consolidate, modernize, and
expand existing risk prevention and mitigation initiatives into an integrated risk management
strategy and program, through an Integrated Risk Management Support PforR (FY15). The
new project would build on many years of Bank-led analytical work and technical assistance,
with support from key donors, including the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
TA on climate change adaptation in rural roads is also being prepared.

Results Area 3: Stren!thenin! Governance and Institutions for Improved Service
Delivery to All Citizens

95. 
Under this Results Area, the WBG will support activities to: (i) strengthen public
sector governance and institutional capacity, and (ii) improve access to basic and quality
services for all citizens. The WBG will support policies and interventions that promote a more
open and inclusive governance framework, more transparent and accountable management of
public resources, and more effective and equitable delivery of basic and quality services to all
Moroccans across the public sector. Access to basic public services is central to sustained
poverty reduction and to promoting shared prosperity as the poorest segments of the population
are particularly dependent on these services for their social and economic well-being.

Strategic Outcome 3.1. Support more open and inclusive governance ensuring effective
rights for citizens to access information and to petition government

Link to twin goals: This outcome is linked to both boosting shared prosperity and reducing
poverty.

96. Morocco's new constitution has strengthened the principles of open governance and
introduced new citizen rights, such as the right to information (article 27) and the right to
petition and to propose legislative motions (articles 14 and 15) 
in order to foster more
participatory democracy. These rights now need to be translated into specific policies and
implemented. The Government has undertaken reforms to increase fiscal transparency and
public access to information, including through the publication of draft laws and regulations
prior to consideration for adoption. To improve voice and citizen engagement, the Government
has launched a national dialogue for the implementation of the constitutional provisions on
citizen participation. The Bank is directly supporting these policies, including a draft law on
public petitions, a public consultations policy, and the law on access to information, through a
Transparency and Accountability (Hakama) programmatic DPL series, launched in FY14, and
associated TA. The Bank is supporting demand for social accountability through a multi-
stakeholder working group on e-participation and through the Global Partnership for Social
Accountability (GPSA), which Morocco joined in 2013. Design and implementation of the
new budget reform and citizen engagement policies will be supported by a New Governance
Framework Implementation Support TA (FY14), financed by a DTF. INDH2 will contribute to
this objective 
through 
its emphasis on inclusive 
local development, notably 
through
community participation of women and youth and enhanced social accountability mechanisms
targeting program beneficiaries.

26

97. 
To ensure better and wider governance of service delivery, and of its accountability
framework 
in particular, citizens and their representatives need more opportunities 
to
participate in the planning, organization, management, and control of service provision,
making 
the decision-making process more 
transparent. Combined with 
the ongoing
decentralization process, greater participation allows citizens to play a real role in public
policy. Entry points include enhancing access to water supply and sanitation, including in rural
areas (through the FY14 Second Rural Water Supply project) and improving the quality of
public transportation services (through the FY15 Urban Transport PforR operation).

Strategic Outcome 3.2. Enable more transparent and accountable management of public
resources through budget and procurement reforms

Link to twin goals: This outcome of improving effectiveness of public spending is linked to
reducing poverty.

98. 
To help the Government carry a more strategic budget policy, increase the allocative
and operational efficiency of public spending, and improve fiscal transparency, accountability,
and the focus on performance, the WBG will support reforms such as the introduction of
programmatic, multiannual, and performance-based budgeting; a new legal framework for
PPPs aimed at leveraging private investments, expertise, and competition; and a modernized
public procurement framework that strengthens the management of public resources through
unified regulation, introduction of grievance mechanisms, increase use of e-procurement, and
institutional and capacity building. In addition, the WBG will support the move toward a more
strategic and less systematic ex-ante control system (financial control) together with increased
reliance on ex-post controls (internal and external audits). Likewise, the WBG will seek to help
improve the efficiency of public investments and the effectiveness of public services by
strengthening the governance of SOEs and agencies, and the implementation of the new code
for SOE governance in priority sectors. Some of the reforms supported will contribute to
Strategic Outcome 3.3. by improving the capacity and management of public services. This
support will be provided through a Transparency and Accountability DPL series ("Hakama")
(FY14) in close coordination with the EU and the African Development Bank (AfDB), a DTF-
funded New Governance Framework TA (FY14), and an IDF-funded TA. A Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment will be undertaken jointly with the EU
and AfDB to update the analytical underpinnings of the large public financial management
reform program and to assess progress to date.

99. 
Through the above-mentioned governance program, the Bank will assist in modernizing
the management of local finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations. This entails a revision
of the system for financial transfers to local governments, with a view to strengthening the
legal framework, making the rules more transparent, and enhancing the impact of transfers, in
line with the Government's regionalization strategy. In parallel, financial management
information systems will be strengthened by extending the integrated expenditure management
system to municipalities.

27

Strategic Outcome 3.3. Improve capacity to plan, manage, and assess the delivery of key
services, especially at the local level

Link to twin goals: This outcome of improving public service delivery is linked to both
reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

100. 
Sector-specific services. Strengthening the capacity of municipalities and improving
their services is critical to delivering good-quality services to all citizens. Despite recent
achievements, additional efforts are needed to enhance governance, particularly on the demand
side, in sectors such as transport and SWM by improving accountability, transparency, and
access to information, and by providing citizens and civil society with new and effective
opportunities for engagement and voice while reducing disparities in the quality of and access
to services. To achieve these goals, the WBG will continue its support to the SWM sector
through a Fourth Municipal Solid Waste Management DPL (FY15) aimed at extending access
to and improving the quality of SWM services, as well as support to the urban transport sector
through a PforR operation (FY15) to improve coordination, quality, and access in urban
transportation with the aim of creating more sustainable and livable cities, connecting people to
opportunities, and reducing congestion and emissions from personal cars and taxis. The
ongoing Judicial Performance Enhancement for Service to Citizens Project will contribute to
this objective by strengthening the institutional capacities of the Ministry of Justice and
Liberties and improving the transparency and effectiveness of its services to citizens and
businesses.

101. Local government capacity. In addition to sector-specific reforms, there is a need to
strengthen the overall institutional and technical capacity of local governments. The Local
Government Support Program (Programme d'Appui aux Collectivits Territoriales, PACT)
(FY14), financed by the DTF, aims to leverage the economies of scale inherent in municipal
cooperation by establishing: (i) support centers to provide TA to local governments in
preparing and managing public service projects; and (ii) municipal groupings allowing
municipalities to build capacity to better invest in, manage, and operate the services they have
been mandated to provide to their constituents, whether directly or by contracting private
operators. The Bank will scale up its support to the Government's effort to strengthen local
government service delivery capacity through potential PforR financing (FY16) while
continuing 
to strengthen 
local governments' 
role 
in 
including communities 
through
participatory planning and avenues for voice and accountability through its ongoing support to
the INDH program. MIGA is looking to support a foreign investment into an integrated utility
service provider at the municipal level.

102. Education. The Bank will sustain the support provided to the education Emergency
Plan and the associated wave of reforms being defined by the Government through wide
consultations, together with other development partners. Going forward, TA and lending
support will have a stronger focus on improving the quality, equity, and governance of
education, particularly through supporting the acquisition of basic skills in early grades and
more effective 
teacher policies; consolidating and improving the efficiency of subsidy
programs targeting rural and disadvantaged areas; and improving the governance of the
education system by building the capacity of the regional academies and providing support to
school-based management mechanisms.

103. Health. To support the Government's program for expanding equitable access to
primary health services and improving the quality and distribution of health human resources
to needed regions, and to address governance issues and gaps in the health management

28

information system (HMIS), the Bank proposes a Health Sector PforR (FY15), underpinned by
a recent health public expenditure tracking survey and public expenditure review. The HMIS,
also supported though a MENA Multidonor Trust Fund (MDTF) grant, will strengthen health
sector officials' capacity to plan and provide health care access to more people across the
country, and 
improve service efficiency by making health 
information available 
to
policymakers and the public in a transparent manner. To further support health sector reforms,
the Bank is considering another complementary lending operation and additional TA in the
outer years.

104. E-government. In order to improve service delivery by reducing the redundancy in
Morocco's development effort and increase the efficiency of overall government service
delivery, 
the Bank will consider assisting the e-government agenda by ensuring that
government services, datasets, and infrastructure are shared and mutually utilized, based on
coherently defined interoperability.

Strategic Outcome 3.4. Expand access 
to basic services (water, sanitation, electricity,
transport, telecommunications, health, education)

Link to twin goals: This outcome of expanded access to services is linked to both reducing
poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

105. 
In order to reduce the outstanding access gap still observed in some areas for some
basic services, efforts still need to be made to extend services such as roads, water supply and
sanitation, electricity, telecommunications (mobile phones, internet, broadband networks
infrastructure), health, and education to underserved areas, particularly in rural and peri-urban
areas. Increasing the rural population's access to all-weather roads through the successful
National Rural Roads program (ongoing and future lending); assisting the efforts of ONEE,
local governments, and municipal service providers in expanding access to water supply and
sanitation services in underserved urban, peri-urban, and rural areas; strengthening access to
reliable power supply in underserved areas, particularly in remote areas and lagging regions,
through the development of renewable energy solutions; improving access to primary health
care services through the Health Sector PforR and TA in support of national consultations that
were initiated with the Second National Health Conference, preparation of a universal health
coverage strategy, and development of a National Health Charter; and enabling basic
telecommunications in remote areas will all constitute a focus of Bank support over the CPS
period.

106. To promote further rural deployment of infrastructure, the Bank envisages TA to
formulate policies and regulations as well as supporting PPPs to catalyze further private
investment, in particular in agro-industry and in trade and commercialization platforms for
farmers.

Crosscuttin! Themes: Gender, Youth, and Voice and Participation

107. The WBG's program will adopt a gender-sensitive approach that takes into
account the role of women and provides them with equal opportunities. Morocco's new
Constitution introduces the principle of gender equality and emphasizes the need to involve
women in the development process. Nevertheless, key indicators show that progress still needs
to be made to strengthen their status and give them equal access to opportunities. In this
respect, the CPS program seeks to promote more emphatically and concretely the gender
agenda throughout WBG-supported activities, including the INDH2 operation. To help track

29

progress in this area, gender-disaggregated indicators will be used in such key areas as
entrepreneurship, revenue-generating activities, skills training, active labor market programs
and access to basic services. A comprehensive Country Gender Assessment (FY14) is expected
to expand the Bank's understanding of challenges faced by women in Morocco and yield
concrete recommendations on how best to support opportunities and services for women. IFC
will complement the WBG's engagement in this area through a strategic and selective
approach, especially through access to finance instrument, looking for opportunities in its
investment and advisory services to improve job creation and empowerment of women and
youth entrepreneurs.

108. No one can deny the challenges faced today by Morocco's young people, one of the
largest and most vulnerable segments of the population. While acknowledged to have the
potential of being a rich and powerful engine of growth, this group is too often left out of
economic opportunities and of the decision-making process around matters that affect it most.
As a complement to the Bank's support for a new coherent and integrated government strategy,
as well as ongoing support to youth representation and participation under the INDH2, youth
challenges will be addressed through sector-specific interventions (such as the education,
employment, or entrepreneurship agendas) with the common goal of seeking to provide young
people with the social and economic opportunities they need to succeed and become productive
contributors to Morocco's future.

109. 
Increased voice and participation are seen as prerequisites for a more inclusive
development process and as a lever for improving the delivery of key public services. The
new Constitution fosters good governance and citizen engagement through enhanced access to
information, participation, and responsibility across all sectors and institutions. While large-
scale initiatives have already been launched in this area, especially around the law on access to
information and policies on public consultation, much still needs to be done to develop the
operational instruments and support the implementation of these new policies across the public
sector in order to inform and shape citizens' voice and establish an adapted space for citizen
participation. This requires support to both the public sector and civil society organizations,
notably through the GPSA.

Implementing the FY14-1 7 Country Partnership Strategy

A. Managing the Program

110. Country demand for the CPS period FY14-FY17 is estimated at up to US$4 billion
(Table 2). The indicative financing program for FY14 is US$1,185 million and is reasonably
firm. Lending volumes in FY15-17 will depend on country performance, IBRD's lending
capacity, demand by other Bank borrowers, and global economic developments. This level of
financing represents a notable increase over the total amount of financing granted during the
previous CPS, which amounted to just under US$2.5 billion. This larger lending envelope
would allow the Bank to pursue a high-case lending scenario to support critical reforms and
investments in public administration reform, accountability and decentralization, employment
support, inclusive green growth, and rural services. This stepped-up engagement would
respond to Morocco's financing demands and enable the authorities to pursue economic
transformation against a backdrop of economic difficulties in Europe, which have dampened
external demand; high international food and fuel prices; and social pressure to create jobs and
deliver on the promises of the new Constitution.

30

111. A greater focus on results and implementation will require a more balanced mix of
instruments. Development policy operations (DPLs), which accounted for 60 percent of total
lending during the last CPS period, have had a proven record of combining policy advice and
support with flexible financing. They are expected to continue to play an important role in
IBRD lending support to Morocco. At the same time, given the Government's shift toward a
more results-centered program and the greater emphasis sought on supporting reform
implementation and institutional capacity building in particular, the share of non-DPL
financing, namely investment lending and PforR lending, is expected to increase to nearly half
of IBRD financing over the CPS period. In particular, greater use of the PforR instrument,
successfully introduced in Morocco in support of the second phase of INDH and particularly
appreciated for its focus on tangible results on the ground, the intensive and continued capacity
building support 
it offers 
throughout 
implementation, and 
its 
flexible disbursement
arrangements, will be considered where most relevant. The timing and composition of IBRD
financing is expected to be managed flexibly, allowing for financing across instruments and
areas of engagement in response to evolving global conditions and country priorities within the
overall envelope.

112. AAA will remain a key ingredient of the Bank's strategic support. To optimize the
Bank's knowledge and leverage greater impact on the ground, and in continuation of past
practice, the Bank will selectively use analytical and advisory services, and particularly
programmatic ESW, as an integral part of the implementation of the CPS program, continuing
to inform and support the policy dialogue on reforms and the overall lending and grant
portfolio. Discussions around the planned Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) should

31

help to seek a more integrated view of where Morocco stands on key economic issues. Support
to Morocco's green growth agenda and analysis of the impacts of climate change will continue
through programmatic ESW. Building on past knowledge work,28 a new programmatic ESW
will help to assess and review management models for service delivery, tariff and efficiency
improvements in the water and sanitation sector, and decentralization and integration of the
impacts of climate change in sector policies. Where appropriate, strategic partnerships with
Moroccan counterparts (such as the fruitful ongoing collaboration with HCP on poverty work
and on the ongoing Country Gender Assessment, the envisaged partnership with the Social and
Economic Council of Morocco on the CEM) will be sought. Opportunities to build on
emerging lessons from the country's first fee-based TA will be assessed in due time. The Bank
will continue to be flexible and responsive to other counterpart demands by providing just-in-
time AAA when appropriate.

113. Where opportunities arise, promotion of South-South exchanges will continue.
Given Morocco's own successful, and at 
times pioneering, experience 
in some key
development areas (such as climate change adaptation, integrated natural catastrophe risk
management, reliance on civil society for youth programs, use of the PforR instrument in
support of ambitious national human development programs, and pioneering solar energy
generation models), the WBG will continue to encourage Morocco's sharing of good practices
and successful experiences with other Bank client countries. Promoting South-South
investments will remain an integral part of IFC's strategy in Morocco. Supported by IFC's
program, the expansion of Morocco's banking sector to Sub-Saharan Africa helped partially
offset the impact of the slowdown of the Eurozone. IFC will continue to support Moroccan
regional players and further mobilize resources to increase investments, deepen regional
integration, and expand South-South opportunities, especially into Sub-Saharan Africa.

114. The continued but selective use of grants, trust funds, and partnerships will allow
for complementary and targeted interventions where most relevant. Where feasible, DTF
funding will be sought for larger-scale TA activities that aim to accompany critical reforms or
programs of a truly transformational nature and that require particularly intensive technical
support (such as support to the national governance framework, to local government capacity
building, to the introduction of underserved youth to micro-entrepreneurship, or to the
development of microfinance). GEF funding will be leveraged strategically to complement
operations supporting pilot or innovative initiatives in the area of sustainable development.
Similarly, support to sensitive reforms and groundbreaking analytical work in the social sectors
(such as social protection, subsidy reforms, and health) will continue to rely in part on grant
facilities such as the Japan Social Development Fund and MENA MDTF.

115. 
IFC will continue to increase its support to Morocco with a view to restoring
investor confidence through countercyclical investment support to existing clients and
new firms. The focus will be on financial markets, with equity investments likely representing
the majority of new investments as a means to help the economy through the crisis. IFC will
explore investments in agribusiness, education, aeronautics, renewables, and mining. Through
its advisory services program, IFC will help improve the Moroccan business environment, with
a focus on PPPs in the infrastructure sector. At the same time, IFC will assist businesses in
improving their corporate governance and internal controls, which are vital to attracting
investors.

28 2008-2010 Water PESW

32

116. MIGA 
is open to continuing its support for sustainable projects with high
development 
impact in sectors aligned with the broader WBG strategy. MIGA has
continued to expand its product line by introducing two new products: non-honoring of
sovereign financial obligations (NHSFO) in 2010 and non-honoring of financial obligations of
state-owned enterprises (NHFO-SOE) in 2013. Foreign investments in Morocco, including
projects in the infrastructure and energy sectors, may be eligible for support through these
products. MIGA will strive to ensure that eligible investments avail themselves of these new
products to support foreign investments. MIGA's client base has expanded and now includes
equity investors, lenders and capital market investors. MIGA will reach out to such potential
clients, including through business development missions. Notwithstanding the new products,
MIGA will continue to support investors interested in Morocco through traditional political
risk 
insurance, 
including 
through 
its Small 
Investment Program. Supporting foreign
investments into Morocco is in line with MIGA's MENA Initiative, according to which MIGA
has mobilized up to US$1 billion in capacity for new guarantees for cross-border investments
into the MENA region. Working together with IFC, MIGA will continue to support Morocco's
efforts to attract foreign private investors, including South-based and regional investors,
through the provision of guarantees for noncommercial risk. MIGA also stands ready to
support Moroccan investors and banks seeking to expand their operations in developing
economies.

B. Portfolio and Pipeline Management

117. Morocco's lending portfolio, totaling US$1.2 billion as of January 2014, consists of
one PforR operation with a commitment of US$300 million, and 9 investment operations,
with commitments totaling $945 million and an undisbursed balance of US$556 million.
While this undisbursed balance may appear high, it should be noted that close to 40 percent of it
is driven by an atypical project, the US$200 million Noor I CSP project, whose financing
profile will, by design, only lead to disbursements toward the end of the project's life (FY16).
The remaining balance is explained by a combination of new operations, some of them
involving new partners, and a few investment operations faced with challenging land acquisition
administrative procedures. Though still falling short of expectations, overall disbursement
improved somewhat over the past two years, with a FY13 disbursement ratio reaching 12.1
percent.

118. 
IFC scaled up its engagement in Morocco during the last CPS period. Since
January 2011, IFC has invested a total of US$590 million, including mobilization through its
subsidiary, IFC Asset Management Company (AMC), as well as cross-border investments.
IFC's investment portfolio has grown and has reached almost US$ 396 million in 16 companies
(end-February 2014). IFC had a record year in FY13 with annual commitments increasing to
about US$272 million (including mobilization). This increase was driven by a large equity
investment of US$204 million 
in Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP) 
to support 
the
Government's reforms of the banking sector through BCP's increased lending to SMEs and
expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, IFC committed over US$300 million of
investments in South-South projects during the past three years. In FY13, IFC also made an
equity investment of US$7 million in the education sector. 
In FY14 thus far, IFC has
committed a total of US$ 133 million in social housing, agribusiness, funds, and MSME
support. In addition, IFC has been scaling up its advisory work in the areas of microfinance,
SME banking, corporate governance, investment climate, energy efficiency, public-private
partnerships in infrastructure and skills development for the youth as part of the regional E4E
Initiative for the Arab Youth.

119. Over the course of the last CPS, the Bank successfully introduced the new PforR
instrument to Morocco in the context of its support to the second phase of the INDH
program. In addition 
to focusing on results, strengthening 
institutional capacity and
governance, and optimizing coordination among partners, the new instrument responded to the
Government's request for greater use of country systems. It is anticipated that several areas of
support under the new CPS will benefit from this instrument.

120. Key stakeholders will be involved more proactively and better prepared to
implement new lending operations and grant-funded activities. The recent past has seen
recurring slow disbursements in some investment lending activities and a majority of grant-
funded operations. Following the recommendations of a June 2013 country fiduciary forum in
Rabat, a more proactive and integrated approach to portfolio management has been initiated, in
close collaboration with Moroccan counterparts. It ensures that all stakeholders with direct
involvement in implementation are brought on board and together much earlier during project
preparation, so that key steps such as proper budgeting, setup of payment mechanisms and
clarification of roles can be secured before effectiveness. In addition, a more systematic
application of the existing but still little-known "green circuit" procedures2 9 for activities funded
under donor grants, which allow for lighter and more ex-post financial controls in the
Government's management of funds, is being sought. Another positive development for the
auditing of Bank-financed projects is the agreement obtained to progressively migrate auditing
responsibilities from the Inspection Generale des Finances to the Cour des Comptes, which is
also mandated to carry out such functions and whose independence has been strengthened by
the new Constitution.

C. Partnerships and Donor Coordination

121. Articulation of donor strategies for support to the Moroccan Government is often
in sync, sharing similar areas of focus and strategic objectives. Alignment of donor
programs with government priorities will continue to be strong. This is especially true around
ongoing or new budget support operations (such as Hakama, IGG, SEDP2), but it also applies
to ongoing and envisaged results-based lending programs (including INDH, health, agriculture,
and urban transport) as well as investment lending operations, where possible (for example, the
Noor I CSP project and support to the national rural roads program). In addition to seeking
joint synergies (such as with the EU when supporting health and governance reforms, with the
Agence Frangaise de Developpement (AFD) on the employment agenda, or with AfDB and the
EU on a new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment), the Bank will step
up its engagement in key areas where other donors withdraw due to their own strategic
realignment (as with the AFD in the health sector). Close and effective donor coordination will
continue through regular thematic meetings held locally at the technical level, through the more
strategic exchanges with in-country representations or visiting officials from headquarters, or
through numerous interactions sought around joint operations, from the exploratory phase of
preparation phase through implementation.

IV. MANAGING RISKS

122. Economic, social, and external risks. A fragile global environment, characterized by
an uncertain economic recovery in Europe and volatile economic conditions in many emerging
markets, create downside risks to Morocco's trade position, economic growth, and fiscal
performance, as well as to the pace of financing the country's investments. Adhering to sound

macroeconomic management-including reining in spending-and accelerating reforms to
boost Morocco's competitiveness and revenues will help reduce its vulnerability to external
shocks and mitigate the risk of a narrowing fiscal space with limited policy options. The
Bank's program is designed to support the authorities in undertaking reforms critical to
strengthening the country's trade position and competitiveness, and to increase the fiscal space
through reforms and fast-disbursing resources. Morocco will remain under tremendous
domestic pressure to maintain generous social programs and will need to raise awareness and
communicate widely regarding the objectives of wage, subsidy, and social safety net reforms to
bolster broad-based support. CPS outcomes which would be most at risk are associated with
improving the business environment, social protection programs and strengthening governance.
The WBG is supporting these efforts through the DPL and TA activities discussed in the CPS
document. The program's flexible design will allow for adjustments to Bank support in line
with the pace of reforms, as needed. Should the environment for the private sector deteriorates
significantly, IFC will stand ready to provide selective and high impact countercyclical support
to help existing and new clients continue their business operations and maintain their
workforces.

123. Political risks. Implementation of the CPS and the achievement of proposed outcomes,
particularly under Results Areas 1 and 3, are predicated on the coalition government's
adherence to the ambitious reforms set out in its program and mandated by the new
Constitution. Any reduction in the depth and scope of those reforms would directly affect the
CPS program, especially the delivery of the envisaged DPL operations and the proposed scale
up in lending support. The WBG will maintain a close dialogue with the authorities and other
stakeholders and continue to provide TA aimed at improving the knowledge base and
understanding of policy options for the reform program, in particular for sensitive or complex
reforms supported by the CPS program, such as subsidies, social protection, decentralization,
competitiveness, transparency, and employment promotion.

124. Program coordination risks. Given the shift toward more transversal and multi-sector
programs supported by the WBG under the CPS, there is a risk of weak coordination among
the many government actors supporting implementation, which could in turn lead to delays in
preparation and implementation of such operations. To manage such risk, the Bank will work
closely with its partners to establish consensus and define clear roles and responsibilities in line
with each agency's mandate and technical expertise. This will be particularly critical for the
delivery of the envisaged PforR operations, which involve multiple stakeholders and are
particularly critical to achieving outcomes across all three Results Areas.

125. 
Implementation risks. Land acquisition and compensation issues played a role in
delaying preparation and implementation of investment operations under the previous CPS.
Given the continued reliance on investment projects, especially to achieve the outcomes under
Results Area 3, and the opportunity for lending scale up under the CPS, the Bank has launched
a review of these and other safeguards issues and is discussing a program for resolving them
with the authorities. Success of some of the analytical work supported by the CPS (for
example, the planned Country Gender Assessment) relies heavily on official data. The Bank
will pursue close collaboration with relevant government counterparts to ensure that such data
can be made available where possible and to reduce the risk of weakening the credibility and
impact of such work.

Note: The above assessment identifies whether WBG interventions have a high, average or low expected impact on income poverty or on the access to any of the basic
needs that are reflected in the multi-dimensional poverty assessment. A high value represents areas where the initial expected direct impact could be on both the income
side and the access to basic needs. In other words, this refers to strategic areas on which WBG interventions could have a direct impact on "extreme poverty", defined as
population with monetary income below the 'minimum welfare' line and with at least three deprivations. An average value reflects areas where the initial impact could
be either on the income side or on the access to basic needs. Finally, a low value refers to areas that may not necessarily have an expected direct impact on the income or
the basic needs sides (i.e. a direct impact on the extreme poor).

Shared prosperity focuses on income growth of the bottom 40 % of the population; 'average' or 'low' indicates the WBG's impact on economic growth in general. 'High'
indicates impact on specific target groups within the bottom 40%.

Annex 2 : Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 Completion Report

I. INTRODUCTION

126. 

This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) evaluates 
the
Country Partnership Strategy prepared jointly by the World Bank and International
Finance Corporation (IFC) for the Kingdom of Morocco for FY2010-2013. Based on a
review of the operational support, technical assistance, and knowledge and coordination
services provided by the World Bank Group (WBG), this CPSCR: (i) assesses the extent to
which expected CPS outcomes, as updated in the May 2012 CPS Progress Report (CPSPR),
were achieved; (ii) evaluates the WBG's performance in designing and implementing the CPS
program; and (iii) draws lessons for the preparation of the forthcoming CPS for FY2014-2017.

127. 
The main objective of the CPSfor FY2010-2013, which was presented to the World
Bank's Board of Directors in January 2010, was to support the government in the
implementation of its reform program. In doing so, the WBG's intention was to focus on the
"how to" of implementation by facilitating institutional reform and coordination, to support
reform implementation in areas requiring interagency coordination and capacity building
through lending programs built on a strong foundation of analytical work, and to help increase
the results orientation of country programs. The strategy focused on three thematic pillars of
relevance to both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
IFC: (i) growth, competitiveness, and employment; (ii) service delivery to citizens; and (iii)
sustainable development in a changing climate. In addition, all CPS activities were to address
two crosscutting beams: governance and territoriality. 3 0

128. 
This evaluation of the performance of the CPS program, and of the WBG's design
and implementation of the strategy, points to positive results overall. The country team has
rated program performance Moderately Satisfactory, highlighting notable achievements in
private and financial sector reform, access to education, addressing vulnerability and social
exclusion, agriculture sector management, implementation of conditional cash transfers, and
solid waste management. Substantial progress was made toward most other expected
outcomes, though some targets in water management, energy sector reform, and climate
change adaptation were not achieved. WBG performance is rated Good, reflecting the highly
flexible design of the CPS and its responsiveness to the significant social, political, and
economic changes that took hold in Morocco during the CPS period. Implementation of the
CPS program was characterized by largely satisfactory project outcomes, disbursements above
the regional average despite expanded lending commitments, increased IFC investment in key
sectors, a strong program of analytical and advisory work, and close and effective
partnerships. This evaluation is based on the results matrix as updated in the CPSPR, and
ratings are based on the latest guidelines on assessing country partnership strategies.
Highlights of the program assessment are discussed below, and details are provided in the
summary assessment matrix (Annex 2A).

II. CHANGES IN COUNTRY CONTEXT AND PROGRESS TOWARD LONGER-
TERM NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

2.1 Social and Political Environment

129. 
Following the Arab awakening, Morocco's social and political context has shifted
considerably since the preparation of the FY2010-2013 CPS. Morocco's experience with this
social movement has been relatively peaceful and constructive compared to other countries in
the region. Street protests conducted during 2011 and early 2012 centered around the need for
political change, including the establishment of a more democratic constitution enshrining the
principles of popular sovereignty, an independent judiciary, and separation of powers.
Protesters called for greater social equality, better social welfare services, improved media
freedom and independence, and better, more transparent governance. Despite many of the
same popular grievances expressed in other countries affected by this movement, Morocco's
experience underlines 
its political distinctiveness 
in 
the region. Successive national
governments have overseen an impressive political, economic, and social transformation, with
a marked acceleration of reforms in recent years. Though these gains did not provide
immunity to popular dissatisfaction or remaining development challenges, the country's
experience has shown that Moroccans seem more inclined to seek evolution within the system
rather than seeking change outside of it.

130. 
In March 2011, King Mohammed VI responded to popular calls for reform with a
broad package of political, institutional, and social reforms that gathered widespread
popular support through a constitutional referendum held in July 2011. The new
constitution reinforces the principles of good governance, human rights, and protection of
individual freedoms, including extending the previous guarantee of political equality between
women and men to civil and social arenas as well. In addition, the new constitution
strengthens the separation of powers, judicial independence, and checks and balances, and lays
the basis for regionalization as a decentralized system of government. Transparent elections
held in November 2011 brought the Justice and Development Party (PJD) to power in a
convincing victory. The King named the head of the PJD, Abdelilah Benkirane, as Head of
Government in January 2012.

2.2 Recent Economic Developments

131. Morocco's economy performed relatively well during the CPS period, despite the
environment of regional upheaval and global economic slowdown. Annual growth averaged
3.8 percent during 2010-2012 and registered 4.4 percent in 2013, during which a 21 percent
jump in agricultural production offset slower growth in other sectors. Growth of non-
agriculture GDP declined from an average of 4.9 percent during the period 2000-2008 to 3.4
percent per year, on average, since 2009. The main drivers of growth have been domestic
demand and fiscal spending. After declining steadily from 62 percent of GDP in 2005 to 50.3
percent in 2010, government debt has grown to 61.9 percent of GDP in 2013, where it was
contained by substantial capital grants. The Government has made a significant effort to
control inflation mainly through subsidies on food and fuel products, with growth in the
consumer price index limited to one percent in the last few years, though increasing slightly to
1.9 percent in 2013. Gross investment as a share of GDP has increased from 25 percent in the
1990s to 35 percent currently, and net foreign direct investment inflows more than doubled

over the CPS period, increasing from US$ 1.5 billion in 2009 to US$ 3.4 billion in 2013.

49

132. 
Fiscal sustainability has been tested by increased government spending to alleviate
popular grievances and counteract the economic effects of the financial crisis in Europe.
Subsidies on food and fuel, at 6.6 percent of GDP in 2012, exceeded capital expenditures for
the first time. In 2012, the budget deficit widened to 7.6 percent of GDP, well above the
Budget Law's target of 5.5 percent. In 2013, owing to lower world fuel prices and the start of
a fuel price indexation system, the subsidy bill declined to 4.8 percent of GDP and the fiscal
deficit narrowed to just below 6 percent of GDP.

133. Morocco's terms of trade deteriorated significantly over the CPS period, faced with
high prices for food and fuel and diminished demand in European markets. The country's
food import bill rose significantly 
in 2012 
in response 
to severe drought conditions
domestically at a time of soaring international prices for food, especially wheat. With no
domestic oil production, Morocco's spending on fuel imports was similarly affected by high
oil prices, which averaged US$ 110 per barrel in 2011-2012. At the same time, demand for
Moroccan products declined in the European Union-the country's principal trading partner,
largely as a result of sovereign debt crises in Spain, Italy, and elsewhere, and the broader
economic slowdown that followed.

134. 
Given these external challenges, Morocco will have to rely on its own forces to
foster the structural transformation necessary to eradicate poverty, grow the middle class,
and meet citizens' high expectations. Though Morocco's production structure has gradually
shifted toward services (whose share in GDP has increased from 51.8 percent in the 1990s to
55.8 percent in the 2000s), continued weak performance in manufacturing and agriculture has
prevented the country from taking full advantage of opportunities for better market access.
With further structural changes, Morocco could expand its export potential-and the growth
and employment benefits that would follow.

2.3 Poverty and Human Development

135. 
Economic growth in Morocco has been pro-poor, but vulnerability and inequality
remain important challenges. Absolute poverty has decreased sharply in the space of a
decade, from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 6.2 percent in 2011. Average per-capita income doubled
during the same period to US$ 3,100 in 2011. Despite the country's improved poverty profile,
13.3 percent of Moroccans live just above the poverty line and thus continue to face the threat
of falling into poverty. Rural areas are subject to higher poverty rates (15 percent in 2011),
largely as a result of difficult geography, deteriorating infrastructure, poor access to basic
services, and limited opportunities for formal employment. Income inequality has remained
high, with a Gini coefficient of 0.41.32

136. 
Unemployment is an enduring challenge, particularly in urban areas and among
young people. Overall unemployment has remained steady at about nine percent since 2011,
after dropping from about 13 percent in 2000. Unemployment is 13.7 percent in urban areas,
as compared to four percent in rural areas. Youth unemployment is high at 18 percent overall
and 35 percent in urban areas. The unemployment rate among women is ten percent, as
compared to nine percent for men.

32 The Gini coefficient measures the dispersion of wealth, with 0 indicating perfect equality and I indicating maximum
inequality.

50

137. 

Despite good progress on poverty reduction and social indicators such as access to
education, Morocco lags behind comparator countries on human development outcomes,
especially for women. Morocco ranks 
1 3 0 th of 187 countries on the United Nations
Development Programme's 2013 Human Development Index. 3 3 Life expectancy increased
from 71.7 years in 2004 to 74.9 years in 2011. Infant mortality rates declined from 36.1 per
1,000 live births in 2004 to 26.8 in 2012, and the maternal mortality ratio dropped from 170

per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 100 in 2011. Yet health indicators continue to lag behind

similar economies (Table 1). Similarly, despite a remarkable expansion in access to schooling,
with net primary school enrollment rates growing from 52.4 percent in 1990/91 
to 93.5
percent in 2006/07 to 96.6 percent in 2011/12, literacy remains low at about 67 percent, and
gender disparities and gaps in educational quality and efficiency remain.

III. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

138. 
The strategic themes of the CPS and the majority of its envisioned activities were
implemented broadly as expected, though the country team made effective use of the
strategy's flexible approach to make mid-course adjustments and additions in response to
changing country circumstances and priorities. The CPS was built around 19 program areas
that were recognized at the time of CPS preparation as being at different stages of
development. Of these program areas, 14 were considered sufficiently well advanced to be
included in the CPS results matrix, and it was expected that the program would be adjusted
based on client needs as well as any progress made in fleshing out the program areas that were
still under development at the start of the CPS period. By the time the mid-term CPSPR was
prepared, Morocco had experienced significant social and political changes, including the
adoption of the new constitution and election of a new coalition government. The CPS
program was adjusted to reflect a greater focus on governance and accountability, social and
economic inclusion, and voice and participation.

139. 
A revised results matrix was presented in the CPSPR, reflecting both the pace of
implementation progress and shifts in emphasis in both the Government's and the WBG's
programs. The health sector activities envisaged in the CPS did not evolve as planned,
following the Ministry of Health's decision not to engage the WBG in support of the health
agenda. Program Area 1.3 on the health sector was therefore dropped from the results matrix
and will not be evaluated by this CPSCR, save for an exploration of lessons learned from this
experience. By contrast, as the WBG's engagement in the area of trade and competitiveness

educational attainment, and income.

51

had evolved into a key element of the country program, the CPSPR included a new results
area to capture implementation progress and outcomes. Expected results in public sector
management, skills and employment, and social protection were fine-tuned to align more
closely with government priorities and with the actual delivery of the WBG program. In other
areas, indicators were added or revised to strengthen gender disaggregation and ensure
effective measurement of progress toward expected outcomes. These changes were indicated
clearly in the text of the revised results matrix appended to the CPSPR.

140. 
Overall performance of the CPS program is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as
expected program outcomes were mostly achieved (Annex 1). There were notable results in
private and financial sector reform, access to education, addressing vulnerability and social
exclusion, agriculture sector management, implementation of conditional cash transfers, and
solid waste management. Substantial progress was made toward most other expected
outcomes, though some targets on water management, energy sector reform, and climate
change adaptation were not achieved. In general, successful CPS interventions enjoyed high-
level government ownership and 
integration with government programs; participatory
approaches; effective technical assistance; and well-specified, operationally integrated, and
regularly monitored outcome indicators. In a few areas, momentum was slowed by the
additional challenges associated with interagency coordination under the auspices of new
multisectoral development policy loans (DPLs), by low government staffing, or as a result of
imperfectly specified targets.

3.1 Pillar One: Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment

141. 
Performance on the first strategic pillar is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Good
progress on private sector reform took shape in significant improvements to Morocco's Doing
Business indicators over the course of the CPS period. The country's ranking for overall ease
of doing business rose from 12 4 th of 181 economies in 2009 to 8 7 th of 189 economies in 2013.
Importantly, Morocco eliminated 
the minimum capital requirement for limited liability
companies and slightly exceeded targets on strengthening investor protection. The financial
sector reform agenda advanced considerably over the CPS period supported by a joint Bank-
IFC package of lending, TA and advisory services, exceeding targets on strengthening credit
infrastructure for small businesses, improving liquidity, and putting in place the legal
framework needed to establish independent supervisory authorities on insurance and pension
funds and on capital markets. Performance on expanding household access to finance was
mixed, exceeding 
targets on increasing the number of deposit accounts relative to the
population and initially meeting targets on reducing the share of nonperforming loans in
microfinance institutions before this indicator slipped again in 2012. Moderate progress was
achieved on the multisectoral agendas related to skills and employment and trade and
competitiveness, which the WBG supported through DPLs and technical assistance. Delays
related to changes in the Government's organizational structure and limited human resource
capacity were among the constraints.

3.2 Pillar Two: Service Delivery to Citizens

142. 
Performance on the second strategic pillar is rated Moderately Satisfactory. All
expected outcomes were at least partially achieved, and there was exceptional progress in a
few key areas. The education sector saw impressive gains in primary school enrollment
rates-both overall and for girls specifically-reflecting improvements in student retention.
Under the Government's National Initiative for Human Development (known by its French
acronym, INDH), targets on the use, accountability, and inclusiveness of basic infrastructure

52

services were exceeded as a result of strong political support and successful mobilization to
reach over five million beneficiaries. In the social protection arena, the Tayssir pilot program
of conditional cash transfers in education reached nearly double the targeted number of
beneficiaries and has been scaled up to the national level. An impact evaluation showed that
the program played a role in reducing dropout rates and improving students' math test results.
The RAMED program of non-contributory insurance for poor and vulnerable segments of the
population was scaled up to the national level, and its targeting systems were improved. Other
areas showed moderate progress toward expected outcomes. There was some progress in
introducing key public sector management 
tools such as medium-term expenditure
frameworks (MTEF) at the sector and subsector level and e-government platforms. In the
education sector, expanded school enrollment at the primary level was not matched at the
lower secondary tier, largely as a result of low enrollment in rural areas and overly ambitious
targets. Expected results in reducing repetition rates and increasing the efficiency of human
resource allocations were not achieved. In the transport sector, rural access to all-weather
roads improved significantly, and preparation of a strategy for the maintenance of unclassified
rural roads has advanced, though at a slower pace than expected. In the agriculture sector,
targets on irrigation water management and public sector support to smallholders were
achieved, and there was good progress in integrating smallholders into domestic markets.

3.3 Pillar Three: Sustainable Development in a Changing Climate

143. 
Performance on the third strategic pillar is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Good
progress was recorded in the water management sector, with improvement in off-farm
irrigation networks and extension of subsidized household access to piped sanitation supported
though WBG investment projects. Targets on urban sewerage and wastewater treatment
coverage were not met, however. There was some progress on institutional reforms in the
energy sector, though price reform targets were not met owing to historically high oil prices
during the CPS period. CPS targets in the solid waste management sector were all achieved,
including the establishment of legislative decrees and improvements in financial sustainability
and cost effectiveness through a successful series of DPLs in the sector. Good progress was
recorded on climate change adaptation. An adaptation action plan was adopted for the
agriculture sector, and pilot initiatives on adaptation in the sector were launched as planned as
part of the PMV DPL series and supporting GEF activities. There was some movement on
developing a national climate change strategy, but the establishment of climate early warning
systems has been delayed.

3.4 Cross-Cutting Beams

144. 
Through the CPSPR, the WBG indicated its intention to realign its governance
agenda to support the development and implementation of Morocco's new constitution and
the subsequent changes 
to 
the country's overall governance structure. Governance
continued to be mainstreamed in all WBG operations, supported by institutional development
activities under DPLs on competitiveness and sustainable access to finance. The first INDH
program was designed around 
the principles of 
transparency, accountability, and
inclusiveness, and its expected outcomes amended in the CPSPR to reflect this enhanced
governance focus. The Public Administration Reform DPL IV focused on strengthening
budget management, human resource management, and e-government, and there has been
good progress on procurement reforms. These initiatives were supported by extensive
analytical and advisory work, including programmatic economic and sector work (P-ESW) on
public administration reform, a Country Governance and Anticorruption assessment, a Use of
Country Systems Initiative Pilot, and a Bank Governance Review. The country team is

53

continuing to deepen its governance focus, preparing an Accountability and Transparency
DPL and a New Governance Framework Implementation Support Project for implementation
beginning in FY2014.

145. 
The CPS supported governance improvements at the sector level. The Solid Waste
DPL3 has helped strengthen demand-driven governance improvements by supporting the
progressive rollout of Citizen Report Cards on the quality and adequacy of municipal solid
waste services, following a successful pilot in T6mara. In the agriculture sector, the first DPL
in support of the Plan Maroc Vert worked to improve the legal and institutional framework
and enhance the governance and public financial management of agricultural investment
support. The Education DPL helped strengthen sector public expenditure management, and as
part of the Urban Transport DPL agencies involved in sector governance were established and
strengthened.

146. 
The WBG has implemented a program of targeted assistance to the justice sector,
building on the new Government's strong focus in this area. The ongoing Judicial
Performance Enhancement Project aims to strengthen the Government's capacity to deliver
efficient, timely, and transparent justice services to citizens and businesses by piloting a
participatory reform process involving judges, court staff, and the public in selected courts,
and strengthening central capacity to support and monitor the court system. The project has
been somewhat slow to roll out, but there have been some consultations with judges and
administrative staff and several planned activities will be launched in the near future. This
program has been accompanied by justice sector technical assistance in FY20 11 and a Justice
Public Expenditure Review in FY2013.

147. 
The CPS aimed to support the Government's objective of fostering spatially
inclusive development and increasing 
the role, performance, accountability, and
empowerment of local governments. These goals were 
tackled largely 
through sector
programs, with good results in expanding access to critical services in rural areas. The Second
Rural Roads Project has made significant progress in increasing the share of Moroccans who
have access to an all-weather road (from 54 percent in 2005 to 77 percent in 2013) and is on
track to meet the target of 80 percent by the end of 2015. The Improved Access to Water and
Sanitation Services Project supported an innovative, large-scale, and successful pilot in poor
peri-urban neighborhoods of three cities to demonstrate output-based aid mechanisms for the
promotion of water and sanitation service connections in chronically underserved areas. The
ongoing Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project is making progress 
in expanding
sustainable access to potable water supply in rural areas. Several sector interventions focused
on strengthening local government. These activities were supported by technical assistance on
regional development for disadvantaged areas and on governance and territoriality. The New
Governance Framework 
Implementation Support Project 
aims 
to 
support 
fiscal
decentralization by assisting in the revision of the fiscal transfer and equalization system for
local governments and providing training to regional and other local authorities.

3.5 Gender, Inclusion, and Voice

148. 
The CPSPR committed to strengthening the focus on gender, inclusion, and voice
during the remainder of CPS implementation. The WBG has focused on using knowledge as
a platform for dialogue and advocacy by disseminating data from analytical and advisory work
to inform reforms, nourish public debate, and ensure more effective targeting. Work on gender
and inclusion has been informed by a report on promoting youth opportunities, a TA program
in employment, a social protection strategy note, and statistical work on poverty. A Gender
Assessment is underway, with delivery expected in FY2014. In addition, the WBG has

54

continued to work with stakeholder and citizen groups to implement the ongoing portfolio
with an emphasis on gender mainstreaming where possible, and enhancing outreach and
communication. The CPSPR 
introduced 
several new, gender-disaggregated outcome
indicators intended to better assess the effect of CPS programs on women and girls in
education and in the area of vulnerability and social exclusion. Progress toward these targets
was good under the INDH program and on primary education, but less successful on girls'
enrollment and repetition rates in lower secondary school.

149. 
Approved 
in FY2012, the flagship Program for Results (PforR) operation on
targeting women, 
tackling vulnerability, and strengthening inclusion-the National
Initiative for Human Development 2-has so far been successful in expanding educational
support and opportunities for local governance among women. This program aims to address
economic and social inclusion through a participatory and community-driven approach that
promotes voice in development and reaches out to marginalized groups such as women and
young people. Its monitoring and evaluation component features gender-disaggregated
information and wide application of social accountability tools. In addition to the INDH2, the
MSME Project (FY2012) aims to improve access to finance among women-owned micro,
small, and medium enterprises, and the WBG has prepared a project on Strengthening Micro-
Entrepreneurship for Disadvantaged Youth (FY2014) to strengthen youth inclusion through
self-employment.

150. 
IFC's investment and advisory services have focused on empowering women
entrepreneurs, especially 
in underserved regions. IFC has partnered with microfinance
institutions that have a strong gender focus, helping to increase their outreach and thus
increase access to finance among women micro-entrepreneurs.

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE

151. 
Overall WBG performance is rated Good. The strategy's flexible design allowed the
WBG to respond quickly to adjust the CPS program as social, political, and economic
transformation took hold in Morocco and the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
region. The CPS used a unique mix of instruments to support implementation of the
Government's ambitious reform agenda, backed up by a well-designed results matrix, in that it
closely linked expected CPS outcomes to the outcomes of planned interventions and struck a

55

practical balance between flexibility and specificity. WBG implementation of the CPS
program was characterized by largely satisfactory project outcomes, disbursements above the
regional average despite expanded lending commitments, increased IFC investment in key
sectors, a strong program of analytical and advisory activities, and close and effective
partnerships with the government, development partners, and nongovernment stakeholders in
the country.

4.1 Design and Relevance

152. 
The flexible design of the CPS proved highly relevant, allowing the WBG to make
seamless program adjustments in response to changes in government and in the social,
political, and economic environment more broadly. Based on the lessons learned in
implementing the previous Country Assistance Strategy, the CPS for FY2010-2013 was
intentionally designed as a flexible, evolving program. It encompassed a 24-month business
plan of firmly developed activities whose expected outcomes were defined 
in 
the
accompanying results matrix, embedded within a longer-term strategic framework that
included several potential activities still under development. The later stages of the CPS
program were to be laid out more concretely at mid-term, through the preparation of the
CPSPR and a fully updated results matrix. This nimble design proved to be an asset, as the
CPS program and expected results were easily adjusted following changes in the country's
constitution and government and in response to the economic challenges posed by the
domestic drought and the financial crisis in Europe. The flexibility of the CPS also proved to
be an effective risk mitigation measure, as both risks highlighted in the original CPS-
systemic and exogenous risks related to the global economic crisis, as well as the role of
political economy factors in successful implementation of the government program-came
into play during CPS implementation.

153. While the original strategy's three strategic pillars remained relevant, the CPS
program was revised at mid-term to align with the priorities of the new government and to
adhere to the MENA region's commitment to "do things differently" following the Arab
awakening. The program was adapted to focus more on strengthening governance and
accountability, ensuring greater social and economic inclusion, and increasing voice and
participation. The CPSPR proposed two fundamental directions for the WBG program going
forward. First, it aimed to support more ambitious reforms, including an enhanced focus on
sectoral governance, communication, and participation 
in ongoing program areas, and
stepped-up engagement on economic competitiveness in support of growth and job creation,
governance, social protection and subsidy reform, and strengthening inclusion and voice,
particularly for young people and women. Second, the CPSPR introduced multisector
approaches to lay the basis for consolidation in the next CPS, allowing stronger alignment
with the Government's priority of addressing complex cross-sectoral issues. This adjustment
took shape in a move from single-sector development policy lending to more intricate cross-
cutting programs in areas such as skills and employment, competitiveness, and green growth.
These shifts in the CPS program design were appropriate and effective in advancing the
WBG's contribution to achieving Morocco's country development goals, and in setting the
stage for continued support under the forthcoming CPS, though it is important to note that the
increased focus on multisectoral approaches introduces new challenges in coordination and
implementation.

154. 
The CPS program employed a unique mix of instruments to support implementation
of the Government's ambitious reform agenda. The use of DPLs has become a defining
aspect of the WBG's program in Morocco, reflecting the Government's preference for this

56

instrument's flexibility and ability to tackle the structural challenges posed by sectorwide
reforms. In parallel, the WBG implemented sectoral investment lending programs in key
sectors such as water and sanitation, rural roads, irrigation modernization, agriculture, and
judicial reform. Beginning in FY2012, the WBG successfully introduced the new and
innovative PforR instrument in the context of a second program in support of the INDH. The
PforR format responds closely to the government's request for greater use of country systems
and stronger focus on results.3 4

155. 
As part of the flexible CPS approach, IFC's program adapted to market conditions
in a difficult environment for private investment. In response to sweeping changes in the
regional context and in the domestic political environment, IFC stepped in to restore investor
confidence by increasing its engagement in Morocco. The global crisis had a dampening effect
on IFC's investment pipeline, however, especially in infrastructure and the real sector. Some
projects were delayed or passed on to public financing, and some potential investment areas,
such as direct agribusiness investments, did not materialize due to a lack of suitable
opportunities.

156. 
The CPS program was underpinned by a well-designed results framework, which
succeeded in striking a balance between flexibility and specificity. The CPS results matrix,
and its updated version in the CPSPR, provided a clear link between country development
goals and expected CPS outcomes, targets, milestones, and proposed programs. The realism of
CPS objectives was broadly on target, though some sectors saw advanced progress by the time
of the CPSPR in FY2012 while targets in a few areas (such as school completion and energy
sector reform) proved to be overly ambitious. Monitoring and evaluation of CPS outcomes
and targets was, in most sectors, relatively well integrated into supervision and results
monitoring at the program level.

4.2 Implementation

157. 
Lending commitments slightly exceeded the anticipated envelope. The CPS proposed
an annual IBRD 
lending envelope of US$ 600 million. Over the course of CPS
implementation, IBRD commitments to Morocco averaged about US$ 630 million per year
and reached record levels in FY20 10 at US$ 729.5 million, after which they amounted to US$
480.3 million in FY2011, US$ 716 million in FY2012, and US$ 593 million in FY2013. The
WBG delivered eleven DPLs, seven investment projects, and one PforR project during the
four-year CPS cycle. Pursuing several DPLs at once allowed the Bank to provide deeper
support to a broader range of reforms than would have been the case had several sectors been
bundled into multisectoral DPLs. At the close of the CPS period, the IBRD investment
portfolio consisted of eleven operations for a total of US$ 1.3 billion in commitments, with an
undisbursed balance of US$ 922.5 million. The relatively high level of undisbursed funds is
explained by a combination of new operations, some of which involve new partners; a few
investment operations 
that face challenging administrative procedures related 
to 
land
acquisition; and atypical projects such as 
the US$ 200 million Ouarzazate (Noor I)
Concentrated Solar Power Project, whose design implies that disbursements are only expected
toward the end of the project (FY2016).

34 This new instrument, introduced in January 2012, supports government programs and links the disbursement of funds
directly to the delivery of defined results with a special focus on strengthening institutions.

57

158. 
Performance of the IBRD portfolio has been broadly satisfactory, with all projects
rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. There have been some delays in launching new
projects due to lengthy procurement processes and a focus on capacity building at the start of
project implementation, particularly for decentralized entities that are responsible for project
implementation. The disbursement ratio averaged 15.6 percent over 
the CPS period,
outperforming the regional average of 13.6 percent.

159. 
As evidenced by the substantial program shifts introduced at the time of the CPSPR,
implementation of the CPS has been responsive 
to changing country circumstances,
emerging needs, and client requests. As discussed above, the intentionally flexible design of
the CPS allowed for mid-course adjustments to strengthen the WBG program in the light of
game-changing regional and domestic developments. As envisioned, the WBG responded to
these shifts by rebalancing the sectoral and thematic emphasis of the CPS program to better
match government plans and needs, and by expanding the use of multisectoral (e.g. support to
skills and employment, social protection, competitiveness) and results-based (e.g. PforR
support to INDH2) 
instruments as CPS 
implementation evolved. The country team's
responsiveness extended to the implementation of individual initiatives as well.

160. 
The WBG continues 
to mobilize significant trust funds to complement 
its
engagement in Morocco. The inclusion of trust funds in the WBG country budget has been
particularly successful, helping to ensure smooth implementation.

161. 
A strong program of analytical and advisory activities (AAA) has helped to broaden
and deepen the knowledge base in critical areas, informing the design and implementation
of sector reform programs and the preparation of DPLs and investment programs across the
CPS portfolio. Twinning reform implementation with technical assistance, capacity building,
and policy dialogue has been a key aspect of the WBG's partnership with Morocco. The WBG
approach has been to carry out strong AAA that underpins dialogue and advocacy in many
sectors, and then build up engagement to DPL or investment financing once sectoral reform
programs are well designed, fully costed, and set to be evaluated on the basis of relevant
objectives and indicators. The WBG's AAA program in Morocco has served as a vehicle for
effective advocacy on critical issues such as youth exclusion, social protection reform, poverty
analysis, governance, competitiveness, labor market dynamics, and innovative service delivery
approaches such as conditional cash transfers.

162. 
IFC scaled up its engagement in Morocco during the CPS period. Since January
2011, IFC committed a total of US$ 477 million in investments, including mobilization of
investments through its subsidiary, IFC Asset Management Company (AMC), as well as
cross-border investments. IFC's investment program has grown from a committed portfolio of
only around US$ 6 million in FY2006 to US$ 272 million in FY2013. A 75 percent increase
in IFC's investment portfolio between FY2012 and FY2013 was driven by IFC's large equity

58

investment of US$ 204 million in Banque Centrale Populaire to support its lending to a
greater number of small businesses and expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa. IFC also made an
equity investment of US$ 7 million (within a total project size of US$ 21 million) in the
education sector in connection with the regional Education for Employment Initiative in the
Arab World (e4e). This expansion has allowed IFC to have significant development impact,
including supporting the creation of around 12,000 jobs and helping generate $1.3 billion of
volume in MSME loans.

163. 
IFC's investment activities have been complemented by a strong advisory services
program for investment climate, microfinance, and public private partnerships (PPPs) in
infrastructure. IFC supported two flagship PPP projects showcasing Morocco's regional
leadership on climate change and water: (i) a PPP advisory project to help assess the
feasibility of and structure 
the Ouarzazate Concentrated Solar Power Project; and (ii)
assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture in structuring and implementing Morocco's first PPP
for desalination and integrated irrigation in the Chtouka region, one of Morocco's largest
agricultural areas. IFC also provided capacity building to the Ministry of Finance to help with
the design and implementation of PPP projects in health and education.

164. 
The CPS commitment to greater collaboration and harmonization yielded dividends
in the form of successful World Bank-IFC integration, strong donor coordination, and a
growing partnership with nongovernment stakeholders. As foreseen in the jointly prepared,
well-integrated results framework, collaboration between the World Bank and IFC was strong
over the course of CPS implementation. Examples include support to MSMEs through IBRD
lending and a joint TA facility, and joint advisory and TA work on targeted measures to
improve the business climate. Coordination among Morocco's development partners has
continued to be effective, with close alignment between donor programs and government
priorities, especially around budget support operations. Donor partnerships have been
particularly strong in education, public administration reform, financial sector reform, rural
roads, and support for the government's INDH. Finally, consultation with nongovernment
stakeholders, outreach to beneficiaries, and dissemination of knowledge evolved into central
themes over the course of CPS implementation. This increased emphasis on civil society
partnerships reflected 
the WBG's broader effort to take a more inclusive approach to
development in response to the profound changes in the MENA region. In Morocco, these
efforts involved further strengthening transparency about WBG programs and broadening
relationships to provide a wider range of stakeholders with opportunities to provide input into
program and give feedback on implementation results.

V. LESSONS RELEVANT TO THE NEXT COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

165. 
Implementation of the CPS confirmed the importance of flexible program design.
The strategy's two-level approach included a 24-month business plan of firmly developed
activities and a longer-term framework of potential intervention areas. This approach allowed
the WBG 
to adapt 
to country circumstances and client demand, including as a new
Government took office and developed its own reform plans and as a new constitution was
adopted midway into the program.

166. Morocco's response 
to 
the challenges emerging from 
the Arab awakening
highlights the importance of understanding the political economy environment. Although
confronted by 
Morocco 
faced many of the 
same challenges 
its neighbors-high
unemployment and poor job quality, inequality, exclusionary practices that benefited elites,
and a public service delivery system that partially failed to deliver good-quality results-its

59

responses were more effective as a result of the Government's willingness to work in a
participatory and inclusive manner.3 5 There is a broad understanding in Morocco that to
achieve real social transformation requires two comprehensive sets of reforms: fostering
equitable growth and jobs, and strengthening service delivery and governance. The CPS aimed
to strengthen its focus in these areas following the CPSPR, and will continue to seek
opportunities to do so in the next CPS.

167. High-level government ownership-together with consistent and constructive
dialogue-are helpful in generating interest and building momentum for reform. Under the
CPS, reforms with regular high-level attention were able to move forward more easily. This
included 
the investment climate work 
through 
the national commission on business
environment, IFC's advisory work with the central bank on credit access, and agriculture
sector reforms under the government's high-profile Plan Maroc Vert and the National Plan for
Irrigation Water Conservation in Morocco. High-level dialogue on broad macro sustainability
issues raised awareness of the importance of controlling the wage bill, allowing reform
progress even after this objective was dropped from the CPS and in the absence of a dedicated
program in this area. Where reform commitment was not backed up by appropriate resources,
as in the case of insufficient staffing to implement trade and competitiveness reforms, progress
was slow. Even where there has been clear government ownership, as on business
environment reforms, 
their 
impact has been weaker 
than anticipated given 
that 
the
bureaucracy has been slow to adapt to new practices. This suggests the importance of pairing
high-level dialogue with practical change management approaches targeted to working-level
staff.

168. While capitalizing on client ownership and reform momentum, attention to
appropriate sequencing remains important. Some reforms envisaged under the CPS stalled
because smaller reform steps that enjoyed significant interest and backing were taken before
overarching frameworks were in place. In the area of public sector management, for example,
multiannual performance budgeting objectives did not yield intended results because sector
medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) were developed before the global MTEF. In
the solid waste sector, policy reforms adopted under the first two DPLs may have advanced
more quickly than the administrative procedures required to implement them.

169. 
Participatory approaches are essential to ensure broader stakeholder ownership of
reform. In light of Morocco's new constitutional mandate to conduct more systematic public
consultations and foster citizen participation, the CPSPR highlighted the need to strengthen
the WBG's support for greater outreach, 
inclusion, and accountability. Participatory
approaches were successful in ushering forward reform through the INDH, on agriculture, on
water and sanitation, and in implementing the Clean Development Mechanism in the solid
waste sector. It will be important to build on these successful experiences in the forthcoming
CPS.

170. 
The single-sector DPLs on which the CPS program relied were effective in moving
forward on a broad program of first-generation reforms amid weaknesses 
in cross-
ministerial coordination, but Morocco's development needs-and the Government's reform
interests-now center around more complex second-generation reforms that involve more
cross-sectoral challenges. Several of the Government's priority reforms, in areas such as trade
and competitiveness, employment generation, and climate change adaptation and green

3s The new constitution specifically states that the government is obliged to work in a more participatory and inclusive way.

60

growth, can only be achieved through across-the-board efforts encompassing a wide variety of
actors. In response to this need, the WBG program has begun to move toward the design of
operations that support the Government in mobilizing multiple institutions and actors and
ensuring better coordination and communication. This shift implies a risk that implementation
progress will stall in the face of continued challenges in cross-agency collaboration. However,
recent experience demonstrates that carefully designed multisectoral operations, backed by
support for institutional coordination mechanisms, could improve the chances of reform
success and, indeed, have a greater impact on complex cross-sectoral reforms than a "silo"
approach centered on individual sectors. For example, the experience of the CNEA shows that
interministerial coordination mechanisms can help build reform momentum 
if given
appropriately high-level support. In the water sector, improved coordination and better
governance were key factors 
in resolving the disconnect between water mobilization
investments and irrigation infrastructure (each the responsibility of a different agency) on the
one hand, and underutilization of already mobilized water resources.

171. 
The strong AAA approach adopted under the CPS was a key factor in developing
and maintaining strong country engagement, and this will need to continue and deepen as
more ambitious reforms are undertaken. It will be important to ensure, however, that the
WBG has the required knowledge and expertise to accompany the Government and can add
real value to the process. Well-targeted technical assistance can help foster institutional and
technical capacity building, an area that is expected to receive greater emphasis as the WBG
moves to implement activities with a stronger focus on implementation and results, as well as
initiatives that aim to strengthen governance, accountability, and voice. In parallel, as echoed
by regular counterpart requests, there 
is a need 
to step up technical assistance and
implementation support for reforms. This is particularly important as the program continues to
shift toward multisectoral reform programs. The WBG program needs 
to step up
implementation support going forward.

172. 
Thoughtful design of monitoring and evaluation frameworks was a factor in the
successful implementation of CPS programs. The INDH program benefited from a thorough
approach to monitoring and evaluation design, which was emphasized not only as a
mechanism for tracking and improving INDH performance and for measuring achievements
against targets, but also as a key element in two-way communication with beneficiaries.
Achievements in the transport sector were facilitated by the use of an indicator on rural access
to all-weather roads, which was well defined, measurable, and well understood and
internalized by all stakeholders. On business environment reforms, the WBG followed the
Government's lead in concentrating on improving performance against the high-profile Doing
Business indicators, which resulted in significant progress in key areas of this survey. Good
results 
in advisory projects 
led by IFC showed 
the importance of involving project
stakeholders in developing monitoring and evaluation frameworks to ensure the same vision
of success. In other areas, such as public sector management reforms, the country team felt
that ownership of reforms could be strengthened through enhanced consultation of users and
stakeholders, notably in the definition of performance objectives and indicators.

Pillar 1: GROWTH, COMPETITIVENESS AND EMPLOYMENT

1.1 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:

Government Objectives: Improve the business environment, especially for SMEs, via a comprehensive investment climate reform strategy supported by an effective reform implementation and
coordination

Key Issues Targeted : (1) Uneven quality of the business law/regulatory framework and its enforcement, leading to an unlevel playing field that reduces entry of new SMEs and diversification and
(2) Weak and uninstitutionalized process of PSD reform identification, preparation, implementation and coordination.
Progress Overview: Among other achievements, Morocco improved its Doing Business indicators the most in 2011 compared to other global economies, climbing 21 places to 94 out of 183
economies on overall ease of doing business; with continued progress, Morocco is now ranked 87 of 189 economies. This improvement reflects progress on CPS outcomes such as eliminating the
minimum capital requirement for limited liability companies and strengthening investor protections. Progress in reducing the time and cost of registering a business has been slower than planned,
but is expected to gain momentum through the establishment of e-registration in 2014.

Lessons Learned

Business environment simplification is a key demand
from the private sector. Moroccan authorities have been
able to streamline regulatory processes and
administrative procedures in certain areas, but with a
relatively moderate impact.
The Competitiveness DPL and TA assistance to the
CNEA aimed at generating an ambitious approach to
this issue. Following the TA, the Ministry in charge of
Administrative Simplification has contmcted out a
private firm with the mission of establishing a
streamlined mechanism for simplifying procedures
through a certification process for administrative forms.
In parallel, several legal and regulatory reforms have
been undertaken by concerned ministries.
However, even though there is a clear progress and
willingness of authorities to continue moving on that
front, the concrete impact of these efforts remains
relatively weak, as the bureaucracy is slow to adapt its
practices to the new business environment.
*In terms of project implementation, advisory projects
led by IFC showed the importance of building synergies
among different project partners for greater impact, as
well as the importance of having project stakeholders

with the private sector needs to be enhanced to ensure

that reforms have an actual impact on business

1.2 FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM -

Government Objectives: (1) Improve further access to finance for households; (2) Strengthen access to finance for SMEs; (3) Promote financial stability; and (4) Foster capital
market development to improve access to finance, competition, and risk management.

Key Issues Targeted : (1) More than half of the population does not have access to banking or postal accounts and MFI weaknesses could affect over 1.2 million customers; (2)
SMEs remain underserved; (3) New risks generated by the development of the financial system (e.g. real estate, interest rate, etc.); and (4) Limited development of long term market
instruments.
Progress Overview: Nearly all targets met. Establishment of authorities on capital markets and insurance and pension funds has advanced significantly through the passage of key
laws, and nomination of the heads of these authorities is expected soon.

Pillar 2: SERVICE DELIVERY TO CITIZENS

2.1 PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT -

Government Objectives: (1) Increase transparency, accountability and performance measurement of the budget; (2) Progress in implementing key components of HR reform; (3)
Consolidate and control civil service payroll evolution; (4) Simplification of PA procedures and greater availability of on line services.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Insufficient visibility of policies in their medium-term budgetary implications which would allow for budgetary allocation decisions in a multiyear
framework; (2) Need to improve HR management to enhance civil service performance including in deconcentrated entities; (3) Strengthen payroll management to foster control of
overall public wage bill and promote macroeconomic stability; and (4) Inefficient and nontransparent procedures undermine quality and reliability ofPA processes.
Progress Overview: Moderate progress recorded based mainly on PARL IV DPL actions. Some good progress on reducing the wage bill was achieved in 2010 but was then reversed
due to Arab Spring pressures up to 2012. As the medium-term sustainability of public finance was at risk, the government worked to better control expenditures in 2013, including the
wage bill, with encouraging results. The First Transparency and Accountability DPL series was signed in December 2013. It supports key policy reforms to enhance transparency and
accountability in the management of public resources and foster a more open mode of governance through access to information and public participation. A parallel technical
assistance project, funded by the Transition Fund, was approved in October 2013 to support the implementation of reforms related to performance budgeting, citizen participation, and
fiscal decentralization.

Lessons Learned

The multiannual performance budgeting did not yield
the intended results in the absence of a central
medium-term budget framework and a clear legal
framework. Sector MTEFs were developed without a
global MTEF or initial globalization of
appropriations at budget item level before genuine
budget program and heads were defined. The benefits
from testing the performance approach were
therefore limited. This is being addressed through the
new organic budget law.
There is a need for stronger coordination with a
number of connected reforms, including payroll and
human resources management as well as the
deconcentration charter. Similarly, synergies between
these central reforms and sector strategies seem to
have been underutilized.
The long and incremental preparation phase and its
extended pilot testing have led to reform fatigue in
line ministries. A shorter implementation phase (2 to
3 years) with a participatory platform approach may
be more effective in fully mobilizing the

This outcome was dropped due to the

administration for reform implementation, as in the
Latin American experience with public sector
reforms.
Lessons learned from the steering of the preparatory
and experimental phase confirm the need to
strengthen and formalize the steering of the reform
on three levels: (i) a specific, temporary, and
adequately fumnded coordination unit within the
Ministry of Finance and dedicated temporary units,
which are directly attached to sector ministries and
have both budget and operational expertise; (ii)
senior-level thematic inter-ministerial committees for
consolidating and broadening the working groups
created to revise the organic budget law; and (iii) a
political interministerial committee that would meet
regularly to steer the reform, arbitrate and to monitor
its implementation.
Ownership of reforms could be strengthened through:
(i) enhanced consultation of users and stakeholders,
notably in the definition of performance objectives
and indicators; (ii) creating a reform community
(through an Internet/Intranet website and topical
seminars) aimed at networking experts and
disseminating knowledge and experience; (iii)
intensifying and institutionalizing information and
training (ENA, management training organizations,
etc.).
* Although no Bank program is addressing the wage
bill issue explicitly, dialogue with the government on
the consolidation of public finance to ensure
macroeconomic sustainability over the medium term
raises awareness of the government on the need to
control the wage bill. The government is felly
committed to rationalizing management of the wage
bill, which it succeeded to achieve in 2013 despite

Nevertheless, after an increase to 11.6% of GDP
in 2012, the wage bill was reduced to around
11% of GDP in 2013.

2.2 QUALITY AND ACCESS IN EDUCATION -

Government Objectives: (1) Achieve universal compulsory basic education by 2015; (2) Improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship); (3) Mobilize and
utilize resources effectively.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Large number of school-aged remains excluded from the system, with high repetition and dropout rates; (2) Weak external efficiency and quality of the
education system; and (3) Weak institutional performance in teaching, management and stewardship.

Progress Overview: Good progress toward most outcomes, particularly in the area of access to primary education. Slower progress in expanding access to lower secondary education
reflects low enrollment in rural areas as well as overly ambitious indicators. Targets on quality and management capacity were mostly achieved. The thrust of the Bank's support to
education evolved during the CPS period, focusing more on quality than on access. Gender-disaggregated indicators were introduced in the CPSPR.

Lessons Learned

helping the Ministry of National Education
(MEN) achieve most of its targets in terms of
improved access to education.
Targets regarding lower secondary education
were overly ambitious given wide disparity in
enrollments between urban and rural areas.

2.3 HEALTH SECTOR REFORM -

Government Objectives: (1) Reduce the burden of major health conditions; (2) Reduce inequity in access to services affecting poor and rural populations; (3) Improve financing and
efficiency of the sector; and (4) Improve governance of the sector.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Dual burden of non-communicable diseases and poor maternal and child health outcomes; (2) Public financing of health services remains inadequate,
resulting, among other things, in high out-of-pocket expenditures; and (3) Limited access to affordable and quality pharmaceutical products (quantity scarce in public sector, prices
high in the private sector).
Progress Overview: The Bank's Health DPL preparation was cancelled because no agreement was reached on the adequacy of the measures to be supported, the instrument, or sector
needs. Technical assistance was carried out.

2.4 VULNERABILITY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION -

Government Objectives: (1) Reduce rural poverty, urban social exclusion and vulnerability; (2) Empower poor and vulnerable groups for their own development.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) High level of rural poverty, social exclusion and vulnerability; (2) Insufficient access to/use of basic infrastructure, social services and economic
opportunities, by poor and vulnerable groups; (3) Lack of convergence of poverty alleviation policies and implementation mechanism across government agencies; and (4) Centrally-
driven approach dealing with poverty and social exclusion, with little room for participation and empowerment of the stakeholders.
Progress Overview: Advanced progress recorded based on the successful completion of INDH-1, in which many outcomes surpassed their targets. The CPS outcomes in this program
area were amended at the time of the CPSPR in response to changes made in INDH-1 project development objectives, at the government's request, to better capture the outcomes of
inclusiveness, accountability and transparency, and to measure the impact on the target population. Recognizing the value added provided by the Bank, the client requested Bank
technical and financial support for the p ogram's second phase, launched in June 2011. The Bank is supporting the INDH-2 through the first PforR operation in Morocco (2012-2015).

2.5 TRANSPORT - P

Government Objectives: (1) Rural Roads: Improve access of rural dwellers to basic infrastructure and social services with all weather roads; (2) Urban Transport: develop the
institutional framework, improve efficiency of services and infrastructure, and ensure the environmental and social sustainability.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Rural Roads Accessibility: only 54% of the rural population has access to roads that can be used all times; (2) Responsibility over maintenance of the
3,000km of unclassified roads is unclear; (3) Inefficient provision of transport services and infrastructure due also to weak institutional capacity.
Progress Overview: Advanced progress recorded. Access among the rural population to an all-weather road improved significantly from 54 percent in 2005 to 77 percent in 2013.
Preparation of a strategy for the maintenance of unclassified rural roads has advanced, albeit at a slower pace than expected. Indicators and milestones for the Urban Transport PforR
will be specified at the time of preparation and will be captured by the next CPS. The JSDF grant supporting accessibility of people with reduced mobility expects to achieve results
only by end-2013, which is beyond the timeframe of the current CPS; results of this activity will therefore be captured in the next CPS.

Lessons Learned

One key success factor of the Second National
Program of Rural Roads was its monitoring
and evaluation system, which was built upon
the indicator of the rural population's access to
an all-weather road. All stakeholders
understood and internalized this well-defined
and measurable indicator, which is more
relevant than the length of improved roads.

launched the Second National Program of 
Rural Roads to increase this percentage from 
54% in 2005 to 80% in 2015 through the 
improvement of 15,600 km of rural roads. In 
2007 the government decided to bring the 
program's completion date forward to 2012, 
but this proved infeasible due to a lack of 
financing. The program is ongoing, with 
completion expected in 2015 as originally

working to set up a similar institution. The 
Ministry of Interior's current strategy is to have 
local government-owned holding companies
(Socit

urban transport planning and management
authorities. Over the medium term, it is planned
that STRS (Socimo de Tramway de Rabat-Sal 
will act as the de facto urban transport authority
for Greater Rabat. The Urban Transport Project
(PforR) will support this strategy under the next
CPS.

5 cities (Tangers, Casablanca, Rabat, T6touan,

Lessons Learned

The Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime
Fisheries (MAPM) has demonstrated
sufficient capacity to design and implement
agreed reforms. However, this capacity
continues to be challenged in the case of
reforms entailing interministerial coordination,
as in the case of improving the efficiency of
domestic markets.
9 Reducing domestic market distortions through
increased investment and improved
management of marketing infrastructure and
distribution systems for fruit and
vegetables will require more time because the
process of change involves many actors, both
in the central government and in the
municipalities, that have traditionally played a
large role in regulating marketing at the local

amount of MAD 12 billion (US$1.4 billion) in 
investment. Provincial technical committees 
have been established for the pre-selection of 
Pillar II projects. The main contributing factors 
to the achievement of this outcome are the 
lessons learned since the launch of the Plan 
Maroc Vert in 2008 and the priority given by 
the government to this program. Pillar II 
projects are financed mainly by public 
resources. 

* ADA, the agency responsible for
implementing and monitoring the PMV, is
highly dynamic. They are able to combine
these Pillar II approaches with the value chain
diversification they are also promoting.
* Strengthening good governance and public
financial management is important to sector
outcomes.
* Pillar II of PMV demonstrates the
government's push to confront problems of
falling productivity and low incomes of small
farmers.
* There is important domestic pressure to
address challenges in small-scale farming in
an effort to increase its contribution to the rest
of the economy.

2.7 SOCIAL PROTECTION REFORM-

Government Objectives: (1) System reform to consolidate SP: (i) Design and implement a more equitable, efficient and coherent package of social protection programs; (ii) As part
of the above, reform the oil and food subsidies programs.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Main safety net remains the general subsidies provided by the Caisse de Compensation which in the medium to long term may become unsustainable. In
addition, the poor receive only about 10 percent of the allocated amounts (2007). Lack of coherent social protection strategy to inform reform options; (2) Current SP system is
fragmented. The various targeting methods generate inequities. Efficiency and impact of most programs are unknown; (3) Less than 25% of the labor force has access to pensions,
health insurance, and other social security benefits.
Progress Overview: The most promising social protection programs envisioned in the CPS-RAMED (a non-contributory insurance scheme for poor and vulnerable segments of the
population) and Tayssir (a conditional cash transfer program) were rolled out. The govermnent introduced measures to decrease fuel subsidies.

*Despite 

In June 2012, the government introduced a one-
off increase in the price for unleaded gasoline and
diesel fuel by 20 percent and 16 percent,
respectively-the sharpest single increase in fuel
prices in several years. In August 2013, the Prime
Minister approved an Order introducing
automatic price adjustments based on
international price fluctuations for three
subsidized petroleum products (diesel, gasoline,
and industrial fuel).
the lack of political consensus regarding
social protection and subsidy reforms in Morocco
and the lack of a high-level government champion
supporting a comprehensive medium-term reform
of subsidies, high-level officials in the
government acknowledge that the Bank's
technical assistance on subsidy reform in recent
years has shaped the government's decision-
making process. At the technical level, the
government acknowledges that future social
protection reforms (and notably the development
of a system of household compensation) will need
to be in place if other subsidized products
(notably butane) are indexedliberalized, as they
have higher incidence on the consumption

83

patterns of poor, vulnerable, and middle class
households. In this context, the Bank needs to
continue to identify and assess policy options to
further reform subsidies and social protection and
discuss them with the main stakeholders despite
uncertainties. Doing so is expected to inform the
political process and promote consensus building.
* In addition to technical issues, the establishment
of national registries/identification systems
confronts political economy challenges. The Bank
may be able to overcome these political economy
challenges by using its convening power at the
national level.

More efficient and effective social

Pillar 3: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN A CHANGING CLIMATE

3.1 WATER MANAGEMENT -

Government Objectives: (1)Promote water demand management; (2) Improve water resources quality protection; (3) Adaptation to climate change impacts on water resources (see
CC matrix); (4) Improve water supply and sanitation (WSS) service coverage and efficiency; and (5) Pursue institutional reforms of the water sector.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Sub-optimal use of irrigation water, overexploitation of aquifers and weak enforcement of water abstraction regulation; (2) Inadequate sewerage, lack of
wastewater treatment, environmental degradation and weak enforcement of water quality regulation; (3) Water resources management institutions not well prepared; (4) Inadequate
access to WSS service in poor peri-urban and rural areas, need for enhanced cost recovery and investment capacity in WSS utility service and inefficient sector organization and
operator regulation; and (5) Weak inter-ministerial coordination.

Progress Overview: Moderate progress recorded, with significant progress on modernization of irrigation practices, preparation of an action plan on climate change adaptation, and
improved coordination. Targets on increased coverage of urban sewerage and wastewater treatment were not met, however. The results matrix in this area was fully revised during the
CPSPR to better reflect the Bank's program and align with the objectives of the three water/sanitation/irrigation investment projects approved by Board in June 2010 (after the CPS).

* The OER Sanitation Project, although
implemented by ONEE, responds to communes'
requests for such investments. The post-2011
period saw an increase in local politics translating
into delays in obtaining commitments of
communes. Some communes decided to drop out
of the project and are being replaced by
communes that show a clear demand.
* The Government of Morocco has not yet
implemented the National Program for Water and
Sanitation extension to low-income peri-urban
areas. Although some progress took place, it is
not in Bank support and is therefore not recorded.

* Understanding CC impacts on water resources is
key to informing public policies and major
investments in the sector, such as interbasin
transfers and desalination for water supply, as
available freshwater resources get more scarce,
despite >90% mobilization of surface water.
* Impacts of CC are significant in the OER basin
and demonstrate that water availability stated in
current plans and strategies (PDAIRE, Plan
National de l'Eau) is overoptimistic.
* Further to the study, the OER River Basin
Agency is working to accompany a voluntary
reduction of groundwater abstraction in the OER
river basin, to protect this strategic resource.

* Improved coordination and better governance
contributed to put a halt to the disconnect
between water mobilization investments
(responsibility of MEMEE) and irrigation
infrastructure (responsibility of MAPM), and
underutilization of already mobilized water
resources. In 2010, the gap between the potential
area irrigable by reservoirs and the actual area
irrigated by these reservoirs reached 108,000 ha.

The investment needed to fill this gap is estimated

* MAPM elaborated a program to close the

* This integrated planning approach allows MEF to
allocate financial resources for investments in
water mobilization consistently with investments
in irrigation infrastructure development.
* Water scarcity in Morocco calls for more such
integrated approaches in the coming years,
ideally. Such coordination, embedded in the
Water Law (10-95) should be implemented
systematically and involve all stakeholders.

3.2 LOW CARBON ENERGY POLICY AND ENERGY SECTOR RESTRUCTURING -

Government Objectives: Enhance energy security and ensure availability of energy to all households and businesses at competitive prices, while protecting the environment and
mitigating climate change.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) High import dependency and strong reliance on fossil fuels, resulting in a high carbon content of the energy mix; (2) Budgetary burden of price support
schemes; (3) Finding the financial resources required by large investment needs of fast growing energy demand, especially to finance highly capital intensive low carbon technologies;
and (4) Avoiding a negative effect on the balance of trade because of the switch to more complex low carbon technologies.
Progress Overview: Good progress at the level of the program. It should be noted that the indicators measuring the CPS outcome are dominated by effects that are outside of the
control of the measures that were adopted. The results matrix has been updated. Since the CPSPR, the Noor I (previously Ouarzazate Phase 1) project has become effective and
construction has begun. The Ain Beni Mathar ISCC is fully operational and the project closed with satisfactory outcomes. The ONEE Support Project is making good progress and
Additional Financing to tackle cost overruns has been approved. The Bank's program will continue to explore ways of being more innovative on issues such as pricing reforms and
energy efficiency. To this end, dedicated triggers have been inserted in a Green Growth DPL. Dedicated TA for energy efficiency is also underway.

outcomes should be more closely aligned with the

The share of renewable energy in TPES is better
measured by excluding hydropower, as
hydropower is subject to significant annual
fluctuations. To understand the progress that is
being made on new and renewable energy sources

is could be useful to choose an indicators that

simply states the MW installed, even if such an
indicator does not well capture the GWh

3.3 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT -

Government Objectives: (1)Provide legal and institutional basis for effective establishment of integrated municipal solid waste systems ; (2) Enhance the sustainability of the
municipal solid waste sector through the introduction of financial mechanisms and incentives ; and (3) Upgrade and operationalize the existing EIA system and improve the
environmental and social performances of the solid waste sector.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Lack of policy planning and coordination in the sector, and ineffective implementation of the national solid waste law; (2) Ad-hoc, limited and inefficient
allocation of financial resources to the sector and modest cost effectiveness of the services; and (3) Poor waste disposal practices with huge environmental and social negative impacts.
Progress Overview: All targets achieved, mainly due to the successful completion of the DPL-2 for the Solid Waste Sector. The legislative framework for the municipal solid waste
sector is nearly complete. The financial sustainability of the solid waste management sector and the cost effectiveness of municipal solid waster services have improved. Disposal
practices met targets. A Solid Waste Carbon Fund program has been appraised by the Bank and the related Emission Reduction Purchasing Agreement (ERPA) signed in 2013.

Lessons Learned

Continued coordination among ministries,
national entities, and municipalities is needed for
sustained successful results. One of the major
impacts of the first three DPLs was to mainstream
coordinated planning to support the MSW reform
program. This was a major milestone in the way
the government conducts business, not only in the
solid waste sector but in other reform areas. The
Bank was able to act as a catalyst for a new
modus operandi for interministerial collaboration
and accompany the government in a new spirit of
openness, in which the ministries were looking
for partnerships but were not yet working together
on cross-sectoral issues. The new interministerial
committee will continue to play this coordinating
role, including the introduction of eco-taxes and
the oversight of the development of the recycling
value chains.

* Policy reforms adopted under the first two DPLs
may have advanced more quickly than the
administrative procedures required to implement
them. This was due in particular to the allocation
of financial support from the center to the
municipalities for solid waste investments and the
implementation of model contracts for private
service providers. Therefore, special attention
should be paid in the future to the implementation
capacity of the relevant agencies for investment
appraisals, financing, and contracting
mechanisms.

sector increased substantially (collection services
are provided by private operation to more than
75% of the urban population), the capacity
building and standard specifications supported by
the DPL series have shown their limitations in
terms of improving cost-effectiveness; more
needs to be done in terms of market development.
For now, the major cities have the funds
necessary to contract out services, based on
revenues from the municipal service tax, but as
coverage rates and service standards continue to
increase, new sources of funds targeted at MSW
should be developed, including the eco-tax. The
second programmatic series supports a number of
actions intended to improve budget management,
reduce LG arrears toward private sector service
providers, and set in place conciliation
mechanisms.
* External factors-including the complex and long
CDM registration process, as well as the volatility
of the carbon market-affected the outcome of
this program and its delivery timing. Flexibility in
the design and early involvement of key players
(private operators and local governments) are key.

3.4 CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION -

Government Objectives: Improve resilience to climate variability and change through the integration of adaptation actions across and within sectors.

Key Issues Targeted: (1) Limited interagency coordination and policy coherence on CC adaptation; (2) Limited ability to design climate-resilient sector policies; and (3) Few
experiences on the ground of viable adaptation options
Progress Overview: The planned Climate Change DPL was replaced by the Inclusive Green Growth DPL series, whose first operation was approved in December 2013, after the
close of the CPS period.

Annex 3 : Detailed Macroeconomic Overview

Economic Developments

173. 
Structurally, the Moroccan economy remains largely dependent on a volatile and
poorly productive agricultural sector. The sector is the first employer in the economy,
absorbing almost 40 percent of the labor force. Although on a declining trend, the share of
agricultural and fisheries activities has remained significant over the last decade (an average
15.6 percent of GDP at factor costs). The reliance of agriculture on erratic weather conditions
also explains the volatile nature of growth. The decline in the primary sector's share of GDP
benefitted services sector, and notably the relatively low value-added services. As a result,
Morocco could not guarantee the productivity gains that would have allowed the emergence
of a larger middle class. The challenge of increasing and further sharing prosperity remains.

174. One key stylized aspect of Morocco's weak economic performance can be traced
in its difficulty to benefit from the current wave of globalization. Morocco's share of
global exports has been stagnant around 0.15 percent since mid-70s, while most competitors
saw substantial increases in their shares. The price of the national export basket has generally
been higher than that of key competitors and the gap has widened since the global financial
crisis. High and rising export prices are symptomatic of persistent weaknesses 
in the
competitiveness of Moroccan enterprises on the global market.

175. While the 2008 financial crisis had a limited impact on Morocco's economy, the
food and fuel price crisis had an important effect, which was magnified by reduced
demand from European markets. With the price of oil averaging US$110 per barrel in
2011-2012, Morocco suffered a major deterioration of its terms of trade. This deterioration
was compounded by a significant increase in its food import bill in 2012 because of a severe
domestic drought at a time of soaring international food prices, especially of wheat.
Moreover, with a strong trade exposure to the EU, Morocco has been adversely affected by
developments in the Eurozone, in particular sovereign debt crises in Spain and Italy, among
other countries, and the subsequent slowdown in economic growth. The banking/sovereign
crises in Europe and related recessionary tendencies reduced demand for Moroccan exports
and tourism, while remittances declined. As a result, growth of non-agriculture GDP
decelerated to an average of 3.5 percent since 2009 compared to 4.7 percent over 2000-2008.
Growth has mostly been driven by debt-creating domestic demand and fiscal spending.

176. The private sector in Morocco was compelled to find new growth drivers. Thanks
to solid economic fundamentals, a smooth political transition, and a relatively good track
record of conducting reforms as well as the capacity of finding new sectors of growth, helped
the Moroccan private sector weather the effects of the crises. While both traditional domestic-
and export-driven sectors 39 slowed down, the Moroccan private sector reacted by shifting its
focus to new high value industries (i.e. car manufacturing, aeronautics, etc.) and the
expansion of Moroccan companies in Sub-Saharan Africa, creating the basis for Morocco to
become a regional hub for investments.

177. External shocks however, highlighted the weak competitiveness of Moroccan
enterprises. Morocco has made virtually no productivity gains over the past two decades,

39 Exporters of traditional products (particularly phosphates and textiles) have continued to struggle, while the newer
branches of Morocco's manufacturing sector (especially the automotive and aerospace industries) have grown.

98

despite high levels of investment: (i) Morocco has consistently invested (public and private) 5
to 10 percentage points of GDP more than peer countries; (ii) investment as a share of GDP
has increased from 25 percent in the 1990s to 35 percent currently. Investment has been
insufficiently productive, even though its high level has helped dampen the volatility of
growth. Quite simply, investment has merely boosted the productivity of labor (a gain of 3
percent per year since 1999), but has not yet triggered a growth take-off through higher Total
Factor Productivity (TFP). Some impact might still occur 
in that government capital
expenditures (about 5 percent of GDP in average) focus on infrastructure (energy, highways,
ports, airports, industrial zones), for which TFP gains take longer to materialize.

178. 
Investments in the infrastructure sector have remained dominantly led by the
public sector, with limited clarity on the efficiency of the Moroccan investment and
capital allocation model. Public investment increased dramatically from about US$6.3 bln
to US$16.5 bln between 2005 and 2013, with a large share carried out by state owned
enterprises (65 percent in 2013). These investments were focused on large infrastructure
projects, including the extension of the Tangier Med port, the construction of new highways,
the extension of phosphate production facilities (Office Chrifien des Phosphates, OCP), and
increasing electricity production by ONEE. Lack of private sector involvement in these
investments is also due to the absence of a legal framework for public-private partnerships
and restrictive regulations in some sectors, including medium voltage energy, healthcare, and
intercity transport. In 2014, a number of laws (including on PPP and energy) that could have
a positive impact on private sector involvement in the infrastructure sector, both in terms of
local as well as foreign investors, are expected to be ratified.

179. The authorities put a great deal of emphasis on controlling inflation. Subsidies on
food and fuel products have helped cap inflation, notwithstanding recently higher import
prices. The consumer price index evolution has been low over the last few years (at 1 percent
in average), but edged up to 1.3 percent in 2012 and 1.9 percent in 2013, with food prices
contributing the most (+2.2 and +2.4 percent respectively). Increases in administered prices
for fuel and their direct impact on transportation (up 3.2 percent) have had limited indirect
effects on inflation so far. However, the fixed exchange rate combined with subsidies on
imported food and fuel products have increased pressures on international reserves. BAM's
expansionary stance has helped to mitigate private sector crowding out. However, poor fiscal
fundamentals have begun to feed through to higher interest rates, with yields on the key 5-
year bond gaining 100 basis points since mid-2012.

180. 
Increased government spending on subsidies, higher civil service wages and
pensions helped counteract weak demand from Europe, but is jeopardizing fiscal
sustainability. In 2012, for the first time, subsidies were higher than capital expenditures and
the pension fund for the civil and military services entered a phase of rapid decumulation
(payout). The fiscal outcome for the year was worse than expected with the deficit widening
to 7.3 percent of GDP, compared to 5.5 percent in the Budget Law, despite good tax
collection and hikes in subsidized fuel prices (up 19.6 percent for gasoline, 14 for diesel, 13.4
for industrial fuel). Subsidies (on fuel and food) and the wage and pension bill (up 12.4 and
8.7 percent, respectively) exceeded half of total expenditures.

181. 
In a difficult but decisive move, Government initiated reforms of the subsidy
system in 2013 to help reverse the deteriorating fiscal trend. The fiscal deficit narrowed
to 6 percent of GDP 40 in 2013 as a result of the activation of a price indexation mechanism
that cut subsidies by almost 2 percentage point of GDP. The budget also benefitted from
lower world fuel prices. The government's decision to rein in recurrent expenditures and
capital outlays also explains the consolidation of public finance. The rise of the wage bill was
contained to 2 percent in 2013- thanks to the absence of any exceptional promotions or wage
increases- while capital outlays were cut by 6.2 percent.

182. Government debt increased significantly in 2012 to reach 60.1 percent of GDP,
but was contained to 62.3 percent of GDP in 2013 in part thanks to substantial capital
grants. The deficit in 2013 was mostly financed domestically, though Morocco also tapped
international markets (BBB- rating). The Treasury issued 4.7 percent of GDP in domestic
bonds and raised US$750 million through international bonds in May 2013. It also benefited
from the equivalent of one billion dollars in capital grant, mainly from the Gulf countries.
Although less than a quarter of debt is denominated in foreign exchange, Morocco's
government debt increased by 15 percentage points of GDP in just five years of which 6.4
points in 2012 alone.

183. 
Substantial capital grants, mainly from the GCC, were critical in financing the
current account deficit and consolidating foreign reserves in 2013. Fiscal expansion and
weak exports and remittances fuelled the current account deficit in 2012 and to a lesser extent
in 2013. After widening to 9.7 % of GDP in 2012, the current account deficit is estimated to
have improved to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2013 with both imports (CIF) and exports (FOB)
declining by 2 % and 0.8 %, respectively. Europe has remained by far Morocco's main
trading partner (absorbing 60 % of its exports and providing 80 % of the remittances
received) with a strong concentration on only two markets: France and Spain accounting for a
third of total exports and half of total remittances. On the financing side, in a context of fixed
exchange rate, net FDI inflows grew by an impressive 23 % in 2013. Thanks to the capital
grants and the issuance of Eurobonds, overall financial flows more than covered the current
account deficit, leading to a consolidation of foreign reserves by US$1.3 billion to US$18.5

billion (4.3 months of imports) end 2013.

184. Current account deficits have 
tightened banking system 
liquidity. BAM
compensated by relaxing its stance in a context of low inflation: cutting its policy rate from
3.25 to 3 percent in March 2012, lowering reserve requirement from 6 to 4 percent in
September 2012, and increasing liquidity injections. However, money supply grew by only
2.8 percent in 2013, compared to 4.5 percent in 2012. Bank credit to the economy grew 3.5
percent (4.6 percent in 2012), mostly driven by mortgage credit (6.3 percent) on the back of
housing programs and credit for business equipment (1.9 percent). Consumption credit

40 The budget deficit does not take account of capital grants, which is registered as source of financing. The
budget deficit including capital grants was 5.4 percent of GDP in 2013.

100

slowed down to 2.1 percent in 2013, while working capital loans declined by 6 percent. Non-
performing loans have been increasing in 2013 and represented 5.9 percent of bank credit to
the private sector in December 2013. With the loan-to-deposit ratio above 100% in domestic
banks, deposit growth is insufficient 
to support 
loans growth to 
the private sector.
Implementation of the Basel III accords starting 2014 is expected to put further pressure on
credit extension, especially longer terms and to larger borrowers.

Economic Prospects

185. The Government's medium-term macroeconomic 
framework 
is broadly
appropriate, although both the global and regional contexts exacerbate downside risks.
Recessionary tendencies in Europe would undermine the macro-economic outlook through
continued weak exports, tourism, remittances or FDI. High fuel prices, deterioration in the
regional context, or renewed global financial turmoil would compound these challenges.
Under these conditions, it would become difficult to sustainably finance pre-crisis growth
levels if internal demand remains the key driver of growth. Absent a significant reorientation
of the economy toward the tradable sector and increased competitiveness, growth, private
sector job creation will remain weak.

186. Morocco's macroeconomic prospects are essentially 
linked to the country's
capacity to generate productivity gains. Morocco would therefore benefit from increased
efforts to enhance competitiveness and gain market shares on global markets. Along with the
sector strategies already under implementation, these efforts would involve improving the
quality of domestic investments and continuing to attract large flows of FDIs. This would call
for more opportunities and economic freedom for all Moroccans, to compete, produce and
participate in the economy, including with a greater role for the private sector. Moreover,
macroeconomic 
stability depends on 
strengthened governance 
and 
robust 
fiscal
consolidation-particularly subsidy, pension, and fiscal reforms, a prudent monetary policy,
and greater flexibility in exchange rate management. While subsidy and pension reforms are
most urgent, including establishing more effective and inclusive social protection programs,
proceeding with structural reforms is needed in the medium term to boost enterprise
productivity through better channeling resources to competitive industries.

187. 
Besides the measures discussed above, the Government confirmed in the 2014
Budget Law its strategy to continue reforming the subsidy system and launch the
reforms of the pension and fiscal systems this year. In addition, it intends to deepen
regionalization and de-concentration and adopt the Budget Organic Law to enhance central
and local governments' budget design and implementation for better public service delivery
and efficiency. To improve further the investment climate, the government planned to
proceed with the justice reform, improve access to financing, especially for the SMEs,
address access to land constraints, develop logistics services, and reinforce technical training.
The Central Bank also announced last year its objective to progressively put in place a more
flexible exchange rate mechanism over the next 3 years. Assuming these reforms take place,
growth in the non-agriculture economy would reach around 5.5 percent over the medium
term, with inflation below 2.5 percent and the budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP. Main
macroeconomic indicators under a strong reform scenario are found in Table 2.

188. External debt sustainability remains within reach provided reforms take hold.
The current account deficit would progressively narrow from 9.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to
around 5 percent in 2017 benefiting from better export potentials and a recovery of tourism
and remittances. External debt is expected to peak at close to 40.8 percent of GDP in 2015
before declining thereafter. Foreign reserves would remain at a little more than four months
of imports, assuming foreign 
investors retain confidence and GCC financial support
materializes timely as it has been the case so far.4 1 Over the last two years, FDIs inflows has
seen double digit growth (22 percent on average, in US dollars) and is expected to continue at
the same pace over the next few years.

189. Assuming the process of reforming the subsidy and pension systems continues as
planned by the Government and the wage bill cost of civil servants is better controlled
through restrained hiring and wage policies as confirmed in the Budget Law 2014, the
fiscal framework would remain sustainable over the medium term. Stress tests suggested
sustainability over the medium term, although debt in three tests stayed between 62-64
percent of GDP, highlighting the risks posed by a limited reform scenario. Even under the

41 The Government signed in February 2013 a grant for US$1.25 billion over a five-year period with the Kuwait
Development Fund (KDF). KDF made a first installment of US$500 million in November 2013. In 2013, the Government
also received US$675 million from the Saudi Development Fund under a US$ 1.25 billion grant agreement. Qatar pledged
its share of US$1.25 billion in January 2014 and activated the first and second installment of a total of US$500 in March
2014. All these grants are part of a cooperation agreement with GCC governments for US$5 billion.

more optimistic scenarios, the debt ratio to GDP would remain above the range generally
judged appropriate for mid-size emerging markets.4 2

42 See IMF World Economic Outlook, Fall 2013: "based on past fiscal performance, the sustainable public debt level for a
typical emerging market may only be about 25 percent of GDP, (...) emerging markets as a group have failed to respond
in a manner consistent with ensuring fiscal sustainability once public debt exceeds 50 percent of GDP."
