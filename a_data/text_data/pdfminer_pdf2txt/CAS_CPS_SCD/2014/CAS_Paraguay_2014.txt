FY15-18 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR 
THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY 

INTRODUCTION 

I. 
1. 
Paraguay is undergoing a dynamic transformation. While historically often lagging 
behind the economic performance in the region, growth and poverty reduction kept pace with the 
‘golden decade’ in Latin America recently: economic activity expanded on average by 4.9 
percent annually from 2003 to 2013 while poverty was almost halved, dropping from 44 percent 
to 24 percent during the same period. While land-locked, the richness in agricultural land and 
clean energy resources have propelled the country to a significant, albeit volatile, private-sector 
led dynamism. The country is young with the demographic window wide open. As a 
consequence, structural transformation from on- to off-farm, from rural to urban, and from 
primary-to higher-value production is in full swing. However, the private sector has outpaced 
public sector capacity, constraining crucial investment in service delivery, human assets, and 
infrastructure which are all vital for future prosperity and sustained poverty reduction. Deep-
rooted governance problems and corruption remains the Achilles heel of the country. Given its 
location and resource base, Paraguay – and predominantly its most vulnerable population – is 
especially exposed to climatic changes. In addition, environmental degradation is already 
significant with the country recording the second highest deforestation level in the world. 

2. 
The last Paraguay CPS (FY09-FY14) focused its program on three thematic 
engagements: Governance and Anti-Corruption, Poverty and Inclusive Economic Growth. 
During that period the WBG included support during the global economic crisis of 2009 with 
policy based lending, along with investments to improve basic infrastructure. On the private 
sector side, IFC’s portfolio saw a fourfold increase, making it the largest multilateral institution 
in the country in terms of disbursements. 1 IFC investments were particularly strong in 
agribusiness, logistics and the financial sector, reaching over 30,000 farmers and guaranteeing 
trade flows worth US$450 million. The CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) discusses the 
challenges and lessons learned during a period marked by slow implementation of investment 
projects and a changing political landscape which included a Presidential impeachment process. 

3. 
This CPS 
(FY15-FY18) supports Paraguay 
in 
implementing 
its National 
Development Plan which calls for eradicating extreme poverty. The document presents a 
brief analysis of the country’s challenges, and government program, followed by the proposed 
one WBG program for the FY15-FY18 period which will be demand-driven, selective and 
flexible, and will employ the array of instruments available to WBG clients. 

1 Annual Report of Public Debt, Ministry of Hacienda, 2014. Yearly multilateral disbursements for Paraguay have 
reached $230 and $210 million in 2012 and 2013, which as a reference were equivalent to IFC disbursements to the 
private sector in those same years.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

A. Sociopolitical, Demographic and Institutional Factors 
4. 
Paraguay is a relatively young democracy that has undergone significant political 
liberalization over the last twenty five years. After the end of thirty-five years under the rule 
of Alfredo Stroessner in 1989, an interim administration paved the way for a new constitution 
adopted in 1992. This constitution strengthened the system of checks and balances with 
separation of power into Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches. Nonetheless, political 
decision making is vulnerable to vetoes, institutions are nascent, and governance continues to be 
a major challenge. 

5. 
Mr. Horacio Cartes was sworn in as President on August 15th 2013 on a platform to 
improve the investment climate, reduce poverty, improve governance, develop the lagging 
infrastructure of the country and generate jobs. The current administration made poverty 
reduction its overall objective and has prepared, during its first year in office, a National 
Development Plan (NDP), which is geared to private sector job creation, social inclusion and 
poverty reduction. The NDP includes an ambitious infrastructure development plan. Against the 
backdrop of high corruption perceptions in the country (Paraguay ranked 150 out of 177 in 
Transparency International’s 2013 Corruption Perception Index 2), the GoP has been actively 
pursuing increased public transparency, with the recent passage of a landmark new law on 
access to information. Among other provisions, the law mandates the public disclosure of all 
remunerations of public employees. This is an important step in building efficient and 
transparent institutions that enable agency and voice, and ultimately create the foundation for 
sustained growth, elimination of extreme poverty and increased shared prosperity. 

6. 
The country is beginning to reap the benefits of the demographic dividend with a 
median age of twenty-seven and a burgeoning potentially productive population. Forty 
percent of the population is between 25 and 54 years old and another 20 percent between 15 and 
24. The large number of working age people will be an important source of labor in the near 
future. Inequality, while falling somewhat recently, remains persistently high. As such, it is a 
threat to capitalizing on the opportunity created by a young workforce. This young population is 
searching for its voice, with only 6 percent of Paraguayans expressing satisfaction with 
democratic institutions – among the lowest levels in the region. 3 Investing in education and 
employability of the young, as well as creating an environment conducive to inclusive growth, 
are critical to help create more and better opportunities for this young generation. 

7. 
The country’s structural transformation is gaining momentum. Agricultural 
employment has fallen from 30 to 20 percent over the last decade, while employment in 
services, commerce and construction made up the difference. Paraguay has the highest 
expansion rate of urbanization in South America, and inequality in the urban space is growing. 
The private sector threatens to outpace the public sector’s ability to provide supporting services. 
Low levels of connective infrastructure create unique challenges for a landlocked country with a 
rapidly growing natural resources based economy.

8. 
Agriculture’s share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown over the last 
decade thanks in part to abundant land resources. Agriculture and livestock contributed 23 
percent to GDP in 2013 and 86 percent of total exports are food and agricultural products. Rising 
production and exports were achieved through both intensification 4 and the doubling of the 
cultivated area. A growing share of GDP in agriculture is an unusual pattern for a middle-income 
country (MIC) and represents both an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity is that it 
represents an important source of sustainable wealth. There are two potential challenges. First, 
production is increasingly volatile as it is concentrated in few sectors that are heavily dependent 
on weather patterns and international commodity prices. Recent studies reveal that the Southern 
Cone (Argentina, southern Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) is highly susceptible to climate 
shocks, mainly related to changing rainfall patterns and rising heat extremes and this is expected 
to severely impact maize and soy yields. 5 The second is that Paraguay has one of the most 
unequal land distributions in the world, making equitable growth a continuing challenge. 

9. 
Paraguay’s wealth of energy resources is both an opportunity and a challenge for 
pro-poor economic management. Paraguay is one of the largest net exporters of electricity in 
the world with about four percent of GDP coming from the hydroelectric complexes of Itaipú 
and Yacyretá. There may also be prospects for oil. Drilling has started and, if successful, the 
country would be faced with the task to turn resource abundance into riches and preventing them 
from becoming a curse. Paraguay’s contributions to the construction of Itaipú will be fully paid 
off in 2023, with the revenue stream then tripling – a unique opportunity for the country to 
finance investments in public goods and basic services. The challenge is to increase the 
efficiency of the public sector and establish governance structures to manage this revenue stream 
effectively and transparently. 

10. 
Paraguay has an open trade and investment regime that positions it well to benefit 
from abundant natural capital and the demographic dividend. Paraguay ranks 13th out of 33 
LAC countries in the Ease of Doing Business Report. 6 It is open to foreign investment and its 
legislation guarantees equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors. Foreign trade has 
grown rapidly over the last decade, reaching 98 percent of GDP which reflects the high degree of 
openness of the country. Private sector led growth is driving job creation. Both private 
investment and consumption have been the dominant sources of growth in the last decade, with 
private sector investment accounting for 85 percent of total investment in the country. 

11. While poverty has fallen significantly over the past ten years, entrenched 
inequalities and exclusion continue to create barriers to opportunity. Improvements have 
been particularly strong in reducing gender imbalances in endowments. However, women 
continue to be under-represented in politics and business. They occupy only 12.5 percent of 
parliamentary seats and only one in five firms had a top woman manager in 2011. Indigenous 
communities in Paraguay continue to be underserved with basic services. Indigenous people 
have substantially higher illiteracy than the general population and are often identified as the

2002 to $248 million in 2012 and fertilizer consumption per hectare of arable land increased from 60 kg nutrients to 
80 kg.

group most discriminated against in Paraguay. 7 Paraguay has one of the most skewed patterns of 
land ownership in the world and the most uneven in Latin America – with two percent of the 
agricultural establishment occupying 82 percent of the agricultural exploited land. 8 

B. Poverty and Shared Prosperity 
12. While per capita income in Paraguay grew 22 percent between 2003 and 2011, 
extreme poverty remained persistently high. In 2011, three out of 10 people were living 
below the poverty line and 18 percent could not afford the basic food basket (the extreme poor), 
placing the country among the poorest in Latin America. In the eight years from 2003 to 2011, 
incomes of individuals in the bottom two quintiles grew at a rate slightly above that of the mean 
person (4 and 3.3 percent, respectively), but this growth was not enough to significantly reduce 
the high levels of extreme poverty and income inequality (see Figure 1).  

13. 
Since 2011 there have been substantial welfare improvements. By 2013, moderate 
poverty fell to 24 percent, extreme poverty reached a historical low of 10 percent, and inequality 
dropped below 0.48 for the first time in the last fifteen years. These changes reflect the rate of 
income growth among individuals at the bottom 40 percent of the distribution (the first two 
quintiles) which was two and half times higher than that of the average person (14 and 5.6 
percent, respectively).

Source: CBP and DGEEC.  Note: Permanent Household Surveys 2003-13. Poverty and inequality are calculated on 
the basis of per capita household income which includes the following components: labor income, private and public 
transfers and capital income. Monthly extreme poverty line measured at the end of 2013 was G 364,241 in the 
metropolitan area, G 279,524 in other urban areas and G 258,654 in rural areas per person, equivalent to US$3.4, 
US$2.6 and US$2.4 per person per day in 2005 Purchasing Power Parity, respectively. Monthly moderate lines are 
set in 2013 at G 607,855 in the metropolitan area, G 435,067 in other urban areas and G 375,801 in rural areas, 
equivalent to US$5.7, US$4.1 and US$3.5 per person per day in 2005 Purchasing Power Parity.

Access to basic services has also improved but quality remains a problem. Between 
2003 and 2013, the country almost universalized access to electricity, and increased access to 
sanitation 9 and to adequate water sources (from 56 to 78 percent and from 65 to 88 percent, 
respectively). In terms of education, the country has achieved almost universal access to primary 
schooling and over 80 percent of children aged 15 to 17 are in school – more than 10 points 
higher than a decade prior. Infant mortality fell from 20 to 16 per 1,000 live births and maternal 
mortality fell from 174 to 100 per 100,000 live births between 2000 and 2010. Quality remains a 
problem and in remote areas availability of water and electricity is often limited to a few hours a 
day. 

15. Macro-economic stability was the base for the positive growth, employment and 
poverty developments. High rates of economic growth opened new labor opportunities also for 
the many poor in better paid sectors (such as construction and public administration) and other 
types of employment (such as wage-agriculture). The stable macroeconomic environment 
slowed growth in local food prices. In 2012 and 2013, food price inflation fell, leaving the value 
of basic food items almost unaltered.

Poverty reduction in rural areas is driven both by an increase in the number of 
people employed and higher average earnings of the employed. Over a third of the fall in 
poverty is associated with households adding additional workers; both male and female (see 
Figure 2). An additional third of poverty reduction comes from increased earnings. As a result, 
about two-thirds of the poverty reduction was driven by improved labor market outcomes. For a 
household most likely to have exited extreme poverty (the second through the fourth decile), the 
main source of labor income growth was wage gains, particularly in agriculture. While 
agricultural self-employment continues to be prevalent among the worst-off, in the past decade

there has been a shift towards off-farm agricultural salary jobs, suggesting a gradual reallocation 
of rural labor from less productive small farms to more productive agribusinesses. In addition, 
non-agricultural wage employment, such as construction and public services, offered alternative 
sources of incomes that tended to be more profitable than own-farm earnings. Among the 
bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, individuals more likely to take on these improved 
opportunities in agriculture and non-agriculture wage employment were men and women of 
working age (30-45 years old) and concentrated in specific departments, among them those of 
the Central region. 

17. 
Non-labor income, especially public transfers such as Tekoporã and Adultos 
Mayores, accounted for the remaining third of the decline in rural poverty. The conditional 
cash transfer Tekoporã, targeted to poor families with school aged children, offers a sizeable 
transfer (on average 20 percent of household income among the extreme poor) but its coverage 
is still fairly low. In 2013, only 6 percent of the extreme poor rural families and 4 percent of 
those living in moderate poverty were receiving this transfer. Family transfers may not have 
been an important driver behind the change in the incidence of poverty but still played an 
increasing role in protecting households from falling into extreme poverty and as a mechanism 
to cope with adverse shocks. Without these transfers, the extreme poverty rate in rural areas 
would have been four percentage points higher. The elderly and female-headed households were 
receiving substantially larger family transfers, suggesting that migration is a household income 
diversification and coping mechanism. Finally, informal lending represents an important third 
mechanism which rural households use to cope with potential shocks. Despite a lack of access 
to formal financial markets (in 2011, only 3 percent of the bottom 40 reported having a bank 
account), 21 percent of rural Paraguayans reported having loans, often obtained from friends 
and family (see Figure 3).

Important Poverty Impacts (Left); Private Transfers Played an Important Role in 
Protecting Families from Falling into Poverty (right), 2003-13.

The halving of urban poverty is associated with significant improvements in the 
urban labor market. The 79 percent fall in urban poverty from 2003 to 2013 is due to 
increased labor earnings and employment levels. Higher earnings, for both men and women, 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were the primary drivers of urban poverty reduction, accounting for almost 60 percent of the 
overall change. This rise in labor income is associated with growing earnings of the self-
employed and workers in small firms as well as with a surge in the higher-paying large firm 
sector (such as construction and public and private services) among low-skilled workers. 
Among the bottom 20 percent, the better educated, particularly men and those living in the main 
metropolitan area (Asuncion and Central), were more likely to be employed in higher-wage 
large firms and the public sector. In addition, the number of income earners in the households 
increased as the unemployment rate declined and female employment increased from 37 to 46 
percent (see figure 4).

19. 

The two main challenges to the sustainability of poverty reduction in the last two 
years are vulnerability of the poor and near-poor and inequality of opportunity for the 
poor. First, while employment opportunities have expanded, a large share of the population still 
faces a volatile economic environment both in rural and urban areas. In rural areas more than 
two-thirds of the extreme poor are largely self-employed in agriculture, a highly volatile sector. 
In urban areas, the informally employed are especially exposed to fluctuations in the economy 
and largely untouched by minimum wage legislation. In addition, a sizeable proportion of those 
above the extreme and moderate poverty lines have incomes close enough to these thresholds so 
that small changes in the economy or in the price of basic goods could push them back into 
poverty. Second, the inadequate quality of basic services, such as health, education, water and 
sanitation, uninterrupted electricity especially among the most vulnerable segments of the 
population contribute to a lack of opportunity and compromise the country’s path toward an 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
equitable and prosperous society.  

20. 
Services such as water, sanitation and electricity are plagued by inefficient resource 
allocation. A recent study found that, while access to treated water stands at 86 percent, 
reliability and quality are lacking. This is especially true among poor rural households where 40 
percent of the population does not have home connections. Less than 10 percent of the 
population is connected to sanitary sewers, and there is no waste water treatment in the country. 

21. 
Although Paraguay has achieved universal access to primary education, its 
education performance is among the weakest in Latin America. Specifically, results from 
the “Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluación de la Calidad de la Educación” (Latin 
American Education Quality Evaluation Laboratory - LLECE) place Paraguay as one of the 
worst performing education systems in the region, trailing only Ecuador in the share of students 
who score below a level 1 proficiency in basic mathematics competencies. Similarly, the 
national standardized test SNEPE (2010) shows that only one in four students in third grade has 
the required level of math and communication skills, and that performance in communication is 
even lower among students attending rural schools. 

22. 
Despite improvements in both infant and maternal mortality, Paraguay is unlikely 
to achieve the health-related MDGs. 10 The country suffers from a double burden given that 
perinatal, nutritional and communicable diseases continue to cause a significant number of 
deaths while the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is on the rise. Easily 
preventable diseases such as yellow fever, dengue and other mosquito-borne transmissions, have 
become endemic in Paraguay, with a doubling of dengue cases from 2011 to 2013. While there 
have been efforts to combat these diseases, structural issues related to social determinants on 
health such as education, water and sanitation impede the successful control of diseases. Access 
to health insurance, through the Social Prevision Institute (IPS), 11 is low (29 percent in 2013). 
Access is unequal across areas and socioeconomic groups reaching more than half in Asuncion 
and among the richest income quintile but fewer than five percent in the poorest income 
quintile.  

23. 
Social insurance is low both in terms of contributors and beneficiaries, the 
institutional framework is fragmented and few instruments are available. The pension sub-
system covers less than 15 percent of the elderly. This is a consequence of the high degree of 
informality in the labor market, which in 2011 was 65.8 percent of the total employed 
population (20 percentage points higher than the average in LAC). No other contributory sub-
system is in place; neither unemployment insurance nor family allowances.  

24. 
Paraguay has made progress over the last decade in promoting women’s 
empowerment and gender equality, but important challenges still persist. Improvements 
have been particularly strong in women’s endowments: Indicators for sexual and reproductive 
health have improved although the country still lags behind the LAC region in other dimensions, 

10 The three health MDGs are child mortality, maternal mortality, and the incidence of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other 
major diseases. 
11 IPS health insurance covers the formal worker and his/her offspring until 18 years of age and parents if they are 
dependent of the direct affiliate.

particularly in maternal mortality and skilled birth attendance. Educational outcomes for girls 
(attainment and achievement) have improved and today girls outperform boys. In recent years 
there have also been important improvements in the legal framework for gender equality. While 
the level of female labor force participation has risen, the rate is still significantly lower than for 
men and several other labor market indicators – such as unemployment risk or informality– are 
higher for women, pointing to structural disadvantages.  

25. 

Paraguay’s indigenous people continue to be considered the most vulnerable social 
group of Paraguay. There are about 20 different indigenous ethnic groups comprising around 
115,000 people (1.7 percent of the country’s total) with the large majority living in rural areas 
(around 91.5 percent). 12 Language is an important reference for many of the indigenous peoples 
as more than three-quarters of the indigenous people speaks the language of their respective 
ethnicity (there are five main linguistic groups). Most indigenous people lack legal titles to their 
traditional territories, 13 only 2.5 percent have access to potable water and 31.2 percent to 
electricity. 14 Illiteracy among indigenous people is estimated at 38 percent (seven times higher 
than the national average), morbidity at 30 percent, and only 39 percent have consulted a 
physician about ailments or accidents. Labor force participation is 52 percent – lower than the 
national average – and more than four fifths of those working are employed in the primary 
sector (agriculture, hunting and fishing). Public expenditures 
targeted 
to 
indigenous 
communities and people amounted to 0.2 percent of the national budget in 2012. 15 Promoting 
income generation, enabling access to basic services (water, sanitation and health, decent 
housing and electricity), and restituting and finalizing titling of indigenous lands are the main 
strategies for improving the well-being of Paraguay’s indigenous peoples that are foreseen in the 
NDP. 16 

C. Economic Developments and Outlook 
26. 
Robust economic performance was underpinned by a solid macroeconomic 
framework. Paraguay suffered from recurring and costly financial distress in the late 1990s, 
which was aggravated by weaknesses in the financial system and the contagion from the 
regional crisis in 2002. In response to that crisis, the GoP adopted an ambitious stabilization 
program in 2003, supported by Stand-By agreements with the IMF which supported significant 
structural reforms and resulted in improved fiscal revenue mobilization, the modernization of 
tax and custom administration, improvements in the regulatory framework of the financial 
sector and improvements in the business environment. In addition, the commodity boom and 
strong external demand supported stabilization and economic recovery. Fast export growth 
underpinned a strong upturn of private consumption and investment. As a result  the GoP had 
eight consecutive years of overall budget surpluses during 2004-2011, and public debt fell by 
almost 30 percentage points as a share of GDP within the last decade. Inflation levels also 
decreased from an annual average of 10 percent in 1994-2003 to 6 percent in 2004-2013.

27. 
Paraguay is rich in natural resources which, if well managed, could accelerate 
poverty reduction and expand shared prosperity. Paraguay has one of the best hydrological 
endowments in the world, mainly due to the hydropower plants 17 which make it a leader in clean 
energy production and a net exporter of electricity. Electricity exports represent about 4 percent 
of GDP. Prospects for oil are present, as exploration drilling has started this year in El Chaco 
region. 

28. Modernization of the agricultural sector has been the backbone of economic 
growth. Over the last fifteen years, Paraguay has witnessed a shift from a traditional and 
family-based agriculture to one which is modern and based on agribusiness with high-rent 
products (mainly soy and beef) and oriented to foreign markets (mainly Brazil and Russia). 
Exports, driven by the agricultural sector, have experienced sharp increases within the last 
decade, jumping from 4 percent of annual growth in 1994-2003 to 15 percent in 2004-2013. 
This has contributed in turn to an almost tenfold increase in foreign reserves since 2002 (from 
US$640 million to US$5,871 million). Imports also increased substantially, growing by 22 
percent annually during 2004-2013, compared to 4 percent in 1994-2003. Imports were 
encouraged by the need for more and better capital goods to support agricultural transformation 
and an appreciating domestic currency.

29. On the supply side, agriculture was the second biggest contributor to GDP growth 
after trade and services, while on the demand side private consumption was the driving 
factor. During 2003-2013 about 1.4 percent points of the 4.9 percent annual average GDP 
growth came from the expansion of agriculture, while trade and services contributed 3.2 
percentage points. On the demand side private consumption was the engine of growth, 
contributing on average 3.9 percentage points to yearly GDP growth. Another 1.4 percentage 
points of the average yearly growth came from total gross fixed capital formation. Agricultural 
expansion had a positive impact on both private consumption and total investment. Due to 
strong external demand the contribution of net exports to growth was also positive (See Fig. 5). 

17 The hydroelectric plants of Itaipú (14,000 MW) and Yacyretá (3,200 MW), are both bi-national entities shared 
with Brazil and Argentina, respectively. Paraguay’s share is 8,810 MW, with low production costs, and the excess 
production over domestic demand is exported to Brazil and Argentina, respectively.

Paraguay invests less compared to its regional peers.  Total investment has been only 
around 16 percent of GDP over the last decade. Compared to many other LAC countries which 
invest about 20 percent or more of GDP, this is relatively low. And considering that LAC 
invests much less than fast growing East Asian economies, Paraguay’s investment levels are 
especially low by international comparison. The private sector has been the main driver of 
investment with an investment to GDP ratio of about 13-14 percent. Central Government 
investment in Paraguay has been stable around 2.5 percent of GDP. This is almost half of what 
other countries investing in LAC, such as Mexico, Peru or Uruguay (see Figures 6 and 7).

The concentration of the economy in agriculture has increased volatility. Paraguay’s 
economic performance closely tracks the agricultural production of its top three commodities in 
terms of export and production value: soy, beef, and maize. 18 The dynamics of GDP growth 
reflects an increase of volatility of agricultural GDP as the agricultural share in the economy has 
increased over time. Overall, agricultural GDP in Paraguay is far more volatile than the 
aggregate. Weather related shocks alone account for more than 50 percent of agricultural GDP 
volatility (See figure 8 and Box 1). 19

Box 1. Economic volatility is high in Paraguay 

Growth volatility is driven by external shocks and agricultural sector. In collaboration with national authorities, 
the WBG undertook a volatility study in 2013 to evaluate its sources and impact on the economy, with a view to 
develop policies for mitigating the impact of volatility. According to the findings, about half of growth volatility 
comes from external shocks, particularly external demand and world interest rates. The other half stems from 
internal shocks, with a higher impact on agricultural production than total GDP. Most of the vulnerability affecting 
the agricultural sector is related to exogenous shocks such as weather conditions (droughts and floods) and 
fluctuations in international commodity prices. The larger weight of agriculture in the country’s GDP has increased 
overall GDP volatility in recent times, putting Paraguay among the top countries with the highest volatility in LAC. 
Such high levels of volatility have negative outcomes in terms of achieving sustainable economic growth and 
continuous poverty reduction. In the short run, it affects sectors linked to the agribusiness chain such as transport, 
trade and financial services. In the medium-run, the consequences fall mostly on infrastructure and investments in 
general, pushing them below their potential. All of these have fiscal revenue implications, making revenue 
collection unstable and unpredictable, thereby decreasing the government’s margin to tackle poverty and reduce 
inequality. Public policy should then be concentrated in risk management by devising instruments that help avoid or 
mitigate certain economic shocks. Diversifying the economy, preventing foot-and-mouth disease, establishing fiscal 
rules and creating stabilization funds are some of the options to strengthen the resilience of the Paraguayan 
economy. 

A further study on agricultural risks had the objective to identify, quantify and prioritize those risks, and propose 
policy options to reduce the volatility of sectoral output and family farming income. The study shows that, on 
average, Paraguay loses about 5 percent of the agricultural GDP due to production risks that could be managed. The 
most notable risk is drought, while animal health problems such as foot and mouth diseases also having significant 
economic consequences. Export prices for family farm products, such as sesame and cotton, are subject to large 
fluctuations which are transmitted directly to the producers. Consequently, rural poverty in Paraguay is closely 
linked to vulnerability to agricultural risks.

Recent Economic Developments 

32. 
The economy continues to expand based on favorable agricultural output and 
commodity prices. Boosted by agricultural production and exports, GDP growth bounced back 
to 13.6 percent in 2013, following a contraction of 1.2 percent in 2012. GDP growth is expected 
to be moderate at 4.8 percent in 2014 according to the CBP’s most recent estimates.  

33. 
Inflation remains low and is closely monitored. In 2013, consumer price inflation was 
3.7 percent and annual consumer price inflation has remained within the CBP’s target range (2.5 
- 7.5 percent) for the seventh year in a row. For 2014, the inflation rate is estimated to be around 
5 percent. In February 2014, the CBP initiated a monetary contraction by increasing its policy 
rate from 5.5 percent to 6.75 percent. The rate has been kept at this level since then. 

34. 
The external sector continues to perform strongly, leading to currency appreciation 
and increase in reserves. Following the surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2013, the current 
account surplus was 1.3 percent of GDP during the first quarter 2014. Paraguay’s chief export 
products are soy and beef, contributing to 38 percent of the total in 2013, with Brazil (30 
percent) and Russia (10 percent) as the main export destinations. 20 The exchange rate 
appreciated gradually, while the stock of international reserves reached US$7.1 billion in 
October 2014, exceeding 7 months of imports -- about 10 times higher than a decade ago. 

35. 
The fiscal deficit remains below two percent. Government budget deficits were 1.7 
percent and 1.9 percent of GDP respectively in 2012 and 2013. The recent deterioration in fiscal 
accounts was mainly a result of weak performance of revenue collection, in particular the 
selective consumption tax and import taxes, despite a strong economic expansion. The 
Government adopted measures at the end of 2013 to curb the declining fiscal balances and 
enable the expansion of fiscal space for investments. These measures included the approval of 
the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) to enhance fiscal discipline and stability as well revenue 
enhancement measures to improve tax collection (see Boxes 2 and 3). Historically, Paraguay has 
had low tax efforts and the tax-to-GDP ratio remains one of the lowest in LAC. The GoP has set 
long term revenue targets and is putting efforts to increase tax revenues. 

Box 2. Paraguay’s reforms to increase fiscal discipline and limit the growth of current expenditures 

The Paraguayan Legislative Branch approved a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) at the end of 2013. The FRL 
supports stability and sustainability of public finances. It also establishes multi-annual budgeting and the need to 
attach a debt sustainability analysis and estimations of some macroeconomic variables to the budget proposals in 
order to provide more predictability to medium term fiscal policy. To increase fiscal discipline, the FRL sets an 
upper limit of 1.5 percent of GDP for the fiscal deficit for any given year, unless there is a case of national 
emergency, international crisis or a downturn of economic activity. In addition, the Law puts limits on wage 
increases and public primary current expenditures. In this regard, the FRL provides a sound anchor to underpin 
fiscal sustainability. Nonetheless, stronger budget institutions are needed to improve the quality of spending, along 
with strengthened tax and customs administration and capacity to deal with potential risks from Public-Private 
Partnerships (PPPs). In fact, the FRL is widely seen as a first important step but still insufficient in ensuring long 
term fiscal sustainability as the law does not establish penalties for deviations (e.g. when the fiscal deficit exceeds 
1.5 percent of GDP).

36. 
Public debt is low and stable, yet it is expected to increase gradually. Public debt fell 
slightly from 14.4 of GDP in 2012 to 14.1 percent of GDP in 2013. Central Administration debt 
represents about 91.1 percent of total public debt. Public debt is mostly external (almost 80 
percent) and denominated in United States Dollars. The authorities have decided to take 
advantage of historical low interest rates and improved access to international capital markets to 
finance an ambitious investment program in the next years. Following a successful sovereign 
bonds issuance of US$1 billion in August, public debt is expected to increase to 18.5 percent of 
GDP by the end of 2014.  

Box 3. Paraguay is determined to enhance fiscal revenues  

In spite of significant progress in strengthening fiscal policy framework, public revenues are still low in 
Paraguay. A tax reform in 2004 helped to raise tax revenues from 8.7 percent of GDP in 2003 to 12.1 percent in 
2011. Nonetheless, tax revenues have stagnated around 12 percent of GDP in the last two years. This is significantly 
lower than the LAC average of 18 percent. To address the challenge of low fiscal revenues and thereby support 
growth enhancing investment and poverty reduction programs, the GoP has adopted, since 2013, several fiscal 
measures aimed at increasing public revenues. Tax policy reforms included an increase in the VAT rate applied to 
the financial sector from 5 percent to the standard rate of 10 percent, as well as defining a VAT collection base for 
agricultural products (5 percent rate). It is expected that these actions would generate about 30 percent increase in 
total VAT collection by 2016. Moreover, a new agriculture sector corporate tax (IRAGRO) was introduced in 
December 2013, both to boost fiscal revenues and to make the tax system more progressive. IRAGRO broadens the 
tax base and is expected to increase the contribution of the agricultural sector to total tax revenues from 6 percent to 
around 9 percent by 2016. In parallel, the tax administration office (SET) is in a process of strengthening its 
institutional capacity. The GoP is targeting an 18 percent of tax to GDP ratio by 2030. 

Economic Outlook 

37. 
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable overall; however some vulnerability will 
remain in the short run. As shown in Table 1, Paraguay’s economic growth is expected to 
return to historical levels between 4.5 percent and 5 percent in the few next years (4.8 percent 
expected for 2014 according to CBP’s data). In the medium-term, GDP growth is expected to 
increase and be less volatile as the GoP’s macroeconomic framework is maintained and 
structural policies are expected to foster private investment, improve productivity and encourage 
economic diversification. Nonetheless, droughts, floods as well as other climatic phenomena are 
expected to still have a strong influence on GDP growth. As Paraguay is a small and increasingly 
open economy, it will continue to face downside risks such as fluctuations in international 
demand and commodity prices for its agricultural exports. In relation to this, a weak economic 
outlook for Brazil and Argentina is an additional source of risk for the Paraguayan economy. 

38. On the fiscal front, projected increases in fiscal revenues and the strict control of 
recurrent spending will support the expansion of public investments consistent with a 
prudent increase of indebtedness. Fiscal deficits are projected to be around 1.5 percent of GDP 
in 2014 and 2015, with a gradual improvement in the following years. The full implementation 
of the FRL is expected to limit the growth of recurrent spending, creating fiscal space for the 
expansion of investments. Here, though, implementation capacity remains a core bottleneck for 
the country.

D. Development Challenges 
41. 
Paraguay’s development agenda includes a combination of new challenges to ensure 
sustainability of recent gains in growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and long 
standing structural obstacles. Emerging new challenges include improving resilience to risks 
and vulnerability in order to preserve and build on the gains in poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity of the last few years. Long standing structural obstacles include strengthening pro-
poor service delivery, including access and quality, and fostering inclusive markets. 

42. With the ‘golden decade’ of growth coming to a close, Paraguay is confronted with 
the 
task of overcoming development challenges while managing 
its structural 
transformation. The challenges include unequal land distribution, substantial differences in 
endowments and opportunities between the poor and non-poor, and concentration of economic 
activity and indirectly public revenues in an agriculture sector dependent on an increasingly 
volatile climate. At the same time the structural transformation is well underway, with jobs 
moving from on to off farm, people moving from rural to urban space and production moving 
from primary to higher-value.  

43. 
Thanks to its abundant natural resources wealth, Paraguay is well positioned to 
ensure that the underlying conditions necessary to overcome the challenges and facilitate 
the transformation are in place. Managing the risks associated with economic activity that is 
increasingly concentrated in a few sectors will be key to making sure that the rural poor are not 
disproportionately vulnerable to volatility and the gains from the last decade are not lost. 
Boosting pro-poor delivery of public goods and services such as education, health, and basic 
infrastructure is critical to creating better opportunities for the more disadvantaged segments of 
the population and putting in place the conditions to reap the benefits of the demographic 
dividend going forward.  

Strengthening Resilience to Risks and Volatility 

44. 
The commodity and climate related exposure risks are creating challenges for 
Paraguay at both macro and sectorial levels. Paraguay is a relatively small open economy 
with increasingly higher exposure to external shocks. While the favorable global environment of 
commodity prices supported the economic recovery after 2002 with important dividends to the 
society, reliance on few agricultural products in limited markets has led to increased volatility of 
GDP. Shocks are mostly driven by the agriculture sector through commodity price fluctuations, 
weather changes and animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease which have 
interdependence to the macro-fiscal framework. In addition to posing direct challenges to 
households whose primary source of income is from agriculture, volatility also has a significant 
impact on tax revenues and fiscal planning and management. Moreover, not taxing the 
agricultural sector until recently has created disincentives for diversifying the economy beyond 
agriculture. Lack of access to finance and underdevelopment in financial literacy exacerbates the 
risks and the impact of volatility on the poor. Heavy reliance on agriculture also creates 
challenges for environmental sustainability. 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45. Households have few risk mitigation instruments, and this is further hampered by 
lacking access to the financial system. 21 About 45 percent of adults do not have an account or 
borrow at a formal institution, use mobile money services, or have insurance. They receive their 
wages and transfer domestic remittances in cash only. These adults are disproportionately poor, 
have a primary education or less, and are unemployed or out of the work force. With only 29 
percent of the adults having an account at a formal institution, account penetration in Paraguay is 
significantly less than the regional average (39 percent). Variations in the ownership of formal 
accounts track closely demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The largest gaps are 
related to income and education levels, though there are also significant differences across rural 
and urban populations, employment categories, and regions. Access in rural areas is particularly 
low, with only about 10 percent of the population reporting having an account and less than 8 
percent reporting any savings. This combination of low savings and poor access to formal 
financial institutions poses a challenge in the event of household shocks. Promoting sound 
financial inclusion will be essential for helping poor households to improve their livelihoods and 
reduce their vulnerability to shocks and emergencies, by enabling them to build assets, smooth 
consumption and manage risks. Furthering responsible and sustainable access to financial 
services for poorest households will also require strengthening the regulatory and supervisory 
framework –particularly for non-banking financial institutions– as well as enhancing financial 
literacy, consumer financial capabilities, and consumer protection mechanisms. 

46. 
The sustainability of Paraguay’s growth model is under threat from environmental 
degradation. Apart from significant climate risks, rapid agricultural expansion and 
intensification creates serious challenges to sustainability. Agricultural expansion is contributing 
to the second highest deforestation rate in the world (13,000 ha per year) according to the World 
Wildlife Fund (2013) and the consequent loss of unique and valuable biodiversity. Forests also 
play a valuable role in stabilizing local hydrology, which is important for a country so dependent 
on hydropower, as well as for soil conservation (again, critical for a country dependent on 
agriculture). Intensification and the associated increase in use of fertilizers and pesticides 
contribute to the contamination of water resources. Unplanned urbanization is also contributing 
to water problems, particularly around Asuncion where disposal of untreated wastewater is 
contributing to the eutrophication of Lake Ypacaraí. While there has been substantial progress in 
the last decade in bringing down the rate of deforestation and improving water resources 
management, enforcement of environmental legislation and regulation remain weak due to low 
institutional capacity, overlapping and at times with conflicting institutional responsibilities and 
weak governance. 

47. 
Addressing key issues related to climate change will also help reduce agriculture 
based risk and volatility. Land use change and forestry are the largest contributors to 
greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate variability 
and this, coupled with problems of land degradation in the country, contributes to increased 
volatility. The emission reduction potential is large, particularly through improved agricultural 
practices and reforestation. Carbon trading opportunities may also be an opportunity worth 
exploring. 

21 All figures are from the 2013 financial inclusion survey carried out by The CBP which incorporated an expanded 
version of the standardized Findex questionnaire.

Boosting Pro-Poor Delivery of Public Goods and Services 

48. 
In order to capitalize on its opportunities, Paraguay needs to improve its public 
sector capacity of service delivery. Paraguay’s young population is a window of opportunity 
for the country to accelerate its growth and economic development. The expected future income 
from Itaipú is another significant opportunity to propel the country to upper-middle income 
levels. However, the demands on the country during this transition are many. With a large 
portion of its population still lacking access to vital and quality services in rural areas, migration 
to cities requires increased employment generation in modern sectors, especially for the young. 
Large investments in infrastructure are needed to improve regional connectivity and access to 
markets, particularly for the poor as well as small firms. The key to success will be raising state 
capacity and governance to take advantage of such opportunities, leading to effective program 
and budget execution. Fiscal space for the necessary investment demand requires increasing tax 
revenues. Shifts towards progressive taxes and expenditures would make the effect of fiscal 
policies significantly more pro-poor.  

Box 4. The Paraguay Public Expenditure Review 

A Public Expenditure Review (PER) was carried out by the WBG in collaboration with the GoP between 
2013 and 2014. The purpose of this study was to answer the following question: Has fiscal policy in Paraguay 
contributed to poverty reduction and shared prosperity, given the structure and challenges of the economy? The PER 
concludes that there has been some progress in fiscal policy during the last decade, with increasing fiscal 
consolidation (sustained fiscal surplus in 2004-2011 and Fiscal Responsibility Law approved at the end of 2013); a 
continuously decreasing debt-to-GDP ratio; larger social expenditures; and higher revenue collection (tax reform in 
2004 and implementation of an Agricultural Income Tax Law (IRAGRO) at the end of 2014). Despite these 
achievements, several challenges still remain. In the short-run, there is a need of turning fiscal policy from pro-
cyclical to counter-cyclical, so as to buffer negative shocks and prevent the economy from overheating. In the long-
run, increasing investment levels as well as the accumulation of physical and human capital are needed to ensure 
sustained economic growth. In fact, the study finds that both revenues and expenditures are rather low in comparison 
to other LAC and lower-middle-income countries, in particular tax collection, social and capital expenditures. In 
addition to being low, public spending in Paraguay is not efficient and is not progressive. The latter is especially 
relevant in social sectors like health and education, which reveal a lack of progressive spending and even shows 
some regressive spending for some expenditure categories. These challenges prevent fiscal policy from being a main 
player in reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. 

49. 
Low revenue mobilization has traditionally constrained the Government’s ability 
for public investment. Paraguay tax revenue potential is underdeveloped. Fiscal consolidation 
has been critical for improved growth and macroeconomic stability. Current expenditures, 
however, were affected less by the consolidation while space for investment was limited. The 
share of current expenditures was about 75 percent of the total government expenditures in 2013. 
Along with low institutional capacity in budget execution, this has hampered the government’s 
ability to address serious infrastructure bottlenecks to improve service delivery and the country’s 
prospects for higher and sustained integrative growth. 

50. 
Spending on social infrastructure is low and needs to be better targeted to the poor. 
Improving access to and quality of public services for the poor is critical to helping them emerge 
from, and remain out of, poverty. Spending on social and basic services remains very low 
compared to other countries in the region. For example, public investment in education has 
declined since the beginning of the 2000s, from 5 percent of GDP to 4 percent, below the 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
regional average of 5 percent of GDP. 22 Moreover, public investments on education are 
concentrated in Asunción and other urban areas. Public expenditure on health has increased to 
four percent of GDP in 2011 but remains among the lowest in the region. Access to health 
services is very limited in the remote rural regions of the country. 

51. 
The existing tax regime is regressive. In addition to a low level of taxation, taxes are 
also regressive, further exacerbating inequality. They are regressive because of their heavy 
dependence on indirect measures such as the VAT, which accounted for 53 percent of total tax 
revenues as of July 2014. Incidence analysis carried out in 2010 shows the bottom decile paying 
an average of 43 percent of income in indirect taxes, resulting in increases in extreme poverty 
from 14 percent based on disposable income (market income, less direct taxes, plus direct 
transfers) to 16 percent, as measured by the international $2.50-a-day poverty line. A large 
number of exemptions and differentiated rates (which were designed to boost the growth of 
priority sectors) eroded the tax base. While low taxation has played a major role in attracting 
investment in the agriculture sector that have fueled the country’s export growth, the lack of 
neutrality of the existing tax system creates artificial profitability for its beneficiaries. 

52. 
Strengthening public sector management, transparency and overall governance at 
all levels of GoP is needed to improve efficiency of spending. Limited capacity for planning, 
implementing and monitoring public investments is common in most ministries and national 
agencies, aggravated by low capacity of municipal governments to enforce minimum standards 
of quality of service delivery and monitor effectiveness. Effectively holding government 
accountable for service delivery and use of public funds is especially important to fight 
corruption, especially at the local level. Improving public sector performance requires setting 
clear rules on how public funds are allocated to the different parts of the country and 
incentivizing providers of services to deliver efficiently and with quality by rewarding 
performance and strengthening accountability to citizens.  

53. Quality of schooling is an important driver of social mobility but varies widely 
between urban and rural areas. According to the Second Regional Comparative and 
Explanatory Study (SERCE), Paraguay ranks 12 out of 17 countries in Latin America in terms of 
student learning. Additionally, there are noticeable differences in performance depending on 
location and level of the parent’s education. An urban child in a household with a wealthier 
socioeconomic background scores similarly to the average Brazilian child on tests (Brazil was 
sixth among the countries studied), whereas a poor rural child is likely to score below the mean 
in any country in the study, including the countries with the lowest performance levels 
(Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Guatemala). Designing and enacting an education finance 
law to provide the education system with the necessary resources, ensure basic school inputs in 
all schools and distribute the resources on the basis of equity criteria is a priority policy. 

54. 
Reducing gaps in access to basic health services requires allocating more resources 
to poor areas and in a more efficient way. This can be done through: (i) strengthening the 
primary health care (PHC) network in marginalized and rural areas; (ii) introducing output-based 
financing as mechanisms to transfer money to regional and local health councils and strengthen 

22 Low investment in education and a very young demographic profile explain the five-fold difference in public 
expenditure per primary school pupil between Paraguay and the other MERCOSUR members.

governance of the whole health system; and (iii) using innovative technology (e-health, e-
medicine) to deliver or control specific health services in remote areas.  

55. 
Setting up a comprehensive and efficient safety net system for the poor requires 
resources and reliable information. Although there has been some initial progress in 
establishing social assistance programs targeted to the poor and vulnerable groups (such as the 
conditional cash transfer program Tekoporã and the non-contributory pension program Adultos 
Mayores), they have not been sufficiently efficient or broad in coverage to lift a significant 
number of the extreme poor out of poverty. Improving targeting of these programs and having a 
single registry of beneficiaries of all conditional cash transfer programs are two important steps 
to make progress. 

56. 
Fundamental challenges in the water and sanitation sectors are low coverage and 
inequality in service provision. Low coverage is evident in the provision of safe water in rural 
areas (especially the poorest) and access to sanitary sewers and adequate treatment of discharge 
in the Asuncion metropolitan area. Addressing these challenges involves investment in 
expansion of coverage and an effective policy of fees and subsidies to ensure satisfactory 
operation and maintenance. 

Fostering Integrative Markets 

57. 
Sustaining high economic growth and continuing with the ongoing structural 
transformation will require improving connectivity and reducing logistic costs as well as 
increasing the efficiency and reliability of value chains for Paraguay’s exports. Paraguay has 
benefited significantly from the commodity boom in the last decade as evidenced by its robust 
economic performance. However, as the initial positive impact of the boom vanishes, existing 
structural challenges are becoming more constraining for Paraguay’s rural development and 
export markets. Connectivity at regional and rural level is poor and an obstacle for business 
development. In addition, transport and logistics costs are high, undermining profitability of 
firms. While the country has moved towards modern agriculture with large scale firm based 
production, small firms and families are significantly lagging behind the transition. Problems and 
inefficiencies in production and export value chains are both leading to cost increases and 
weaknesses in capacity to respond to market demand.  

58. 
Improving small farm productivity and integrating smaller agricultural producers 
into export value chains remain a challenge. Paraguay’s strong economic performance has 
been driven by agricultural production and exports by a sub-sector of capitalized entrepreneurial 
producers who are fully integrated into world markets. Smaller producers and firms in the other 
sectors maintain low levels of productivity and have limited linkages to dynamic commercial 
markets. These low productivity levels and deficient market integration are also associated with 
several factors including shortcomings in the business environment, poor use of technology, 
limited access to extension and business services, and limited access to finance. This situation is 
compounded by weak public-private dialogue and lack of inter-institutional coordination 
mechanisms which hamper the effectiveness of authorities’ initiatives to foster integrative 
growth. 

20 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
59. 
Agriculture plays an important role in food security, particularly for smallholders 
that have less than 10 hectares (almost 60 percent of total agricultural producers in the 
country). There has been an accelerated concentration of lands in large farms mainly within 
some of the most fertile regions in the country (i.e. Alto Parana, Canindeyu and Caaguazu). 
Rural land sale and rental markets appear to be transferring land to households with higher 
productive capacity. However, cultivation of more lucrative crops (e.g. soy) is correlated with 
higher land inequality and foreign ownership of land. About 87 percent of soy, cattle, and export 
crops are produced on large landholdings (over 100 hectares) with limited or no spill-overs to 
smaller production units. 

60. 
Paraguay’s low levels of connectivity further exacerbate exclusion. Transport is a 
critical component of Paraguay’s economy. Being landlocked makes it heavily dependent on 
road and fluvial transport to connect with neighboring countries for its exports. The challenges 
go beyond the road network since other transport systems still fall short of desired standards. 
Paraguay scores low on the density of km of roads per country surface area (148 km per 1000 
km2 compared to 333 km per 1000 km2 for lower-middle-income countries), but relatively well 
on km of roads per 1000 persons (9 km per 1000 inhabitants compared to 4.9 for lower-middle-
income countries). The road network is heavily concentrated in the south-eastern part of the 
country, leaving the northwest poorly connected to the rest of the country and its neighbors. The 
significant shortfalls in the quality of the transport infrastructure add to this burden and 
contribute to volatile price formation. Drought induced delays in river transport cause local 
commodity prices to fall and local food prices to rise. Given its crucial role, it is therefore 
imperative to prevent the sector from becoming a binding constraint to integrative growth. 

61. 
Unplanned urban sprawl is becoming a development challenge. The Gini coefficient 
in the urban area has been rising, possibly as a consequence of more people moving in search of 
wage earning opportunities. Many of the urban poor live in precarious settlements in risk-prone 
flood areas, with about two thirds of unplanned settlements in urban areas classified as poor. 
Furthermore, in Asuncion metropolitan area, it was estimated that there were about 150,000 
homeless people in 2011 and that more than 800,000 families have some kind of deficit in 
housing. Only about 15 percent of them have access to sewerage and 75 percent or less have 24-
hour water service. Transportation to and from work is becoming increasingly difficult, due to 
weak public transport infrastructure and congestion. 

III. WBG PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
A. Government Program and Medium-term Strategy 
62. 
The GoP has prepared its first National Development Plan 2014-2030. The NDP’s 
overall goals include a focus on eliminating extreme poverty and realizing a growth in incomes 
of the bottom 40 percent higher than average incomes. As such, the WBG’s twin goals are well 
aligned with the NDP. The Plan establishes an ambitious agenda until 2018 which aims to create 
an inclusive society with an innovative and productive private sector that generates jobs and 
opportunities. The vision foresees an improved targeting of social safety nets to the vulnerable 
groups, and an economy linked to regional value chains, and to the world. The NDP also 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
establishes a monitoring system to track overall progress and, in particular, of the flagship 
program "Sembrando Oportunidades" –Sowing Opportunities– which targets the rural poor. The 
NDP has been widely consulted with development partners, civil society, private sector and local 
authorities. 

63. 
The NDP is organized around three thematic pillars: (i) Poverty Reduction and Social 
Development,(ii) Inclusive Economic Growth, and (iii) Insertion of Paraguay into World 
Markets. The NDP includes four transversal themes: equal opportunity, efficiency and 
transparency, land management, and environmental sustainability. The Plan is anchored in a 
medium term economic framework which supports sustainable fiscal policies, enhanced tax 
revenue efforts, improved efficiency in social protection polices and targeting, and widened 
financial inclusion. 

64. 
Pillar I -- Poverty Reduction and Social Development. The challenges faced by the 
extreme poor and vulnerable would be addressed by providing equal opportunities in health care, 
education sanitation and housing, and other social services. The actions under this pillar include 
improved coverage and targeting of social protection schemes. The NDP proposes the rollout of 
an integrated information system to create a registry of approximately 250,000 families in 
situation of vulnerability to be linked to social schemes and agricultural programs, including 
education and health services. 

65. 
Pillar II - Inclusive Economic Growth. Following successive years of strong economic 
growth, the role of the Government is described as providing support to productive processes, 
especially through public investments in services and infrastructure. This will enable access to 
markets and greater competitiveness. The NDP gives priority to funding infrastructure through 
Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Some particular targets under this pillar include upgrading 
logistics infrastructure (e.g, the hidrovía), and the facilitation of market mechanisms to mitigate 
the agricultural risks (i.e., creation of commodities exchanges, agricultural or weather-related 
insurance and an increase in the number of certified companies with recognized quality standards 
and safeguards). 

66. 
Pillar III – International Insertion of Paraguay. This pillar calls for coordination 
efforts between Paraguay and its key partners to expand trade and investment, as well as to 
protect key environmental assets, such as the watershed of the Paraguay and Parana rivers. The 
insertion of Paraguay into the world economy also requires efficient public institutions that 
guarantee the rule of law and an enabling environment for investors. The Plan spells out an 
ambitious regional agenda with Paraguay’s neighbors to realize such investment. 

67. 
The national budget is aligned with the NDP. The proposed government program 
includes a medium-term economic framework anchored in a credible and predictable budget 
closely linked to the NDP. The GoP has earmarked fiscal resources, including from royalties 
from the bi-national hydropower plants for social sectors, and external financing from 
international capital markets, direct foreign investment and multilateral financing to support the 
overall implementation of the NDP. The main economic institutions leading these efforts are the 
Ministry of Hacienda (MoH) and the Secretary of Technical Planning (STP) which have 
coordinated the preparation of the NDP through a consultative process that involved all 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
stakeholders in the country (the national, regional and local governments, civil society and 
development partners). The NDP will be regularly monitored and reports made available to the 
public at large. 

B. Proposed WBG Engagement  
68. 
The proposed WBG engagement in Paraguay consists of a portfolio of financial, 
knowledge and convening services focused on promoting shared prosperity and reducing 
poverty in a developmentally sustainable manner. The CPS builds on lessons learned and 
outlines a program that further strengthens the collaboration within the WBG and with other key 
development partners (for the lessons learned from the FY10-14 CPS Completion Report 
(CPSCR), please refer to Annex 2). 

Lessons learned and stakeholder consultations 
69. 
Strengthening portfolio performance, increased selectivity and strategic focus are 
critical for the new engagement. Weak coordination has, in the past, negatively impacted 
portfolio performance and led to several knowledge products falling short of their potential 
policy impact. The experience of IFC, especially in supporting the burgeoning agribusiness 
sector –working with local banks on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) lending 
mechanisms– has been very effective, reaching close to 33,000 farmers. Given the important 
leadership role of the MoH and the STP in designing the NDP, a close coordination with both 
institutions as well as line ministers is vital for effective program development and 
implementation. 

70. 
The WBG will seek to streamline its engagement and work closer with the 
Legislative Branch and other development partners. Lack of effective dialogue between the 
Executive and Legislative Branches about the intended plans and objectives of the IBRD loans 
was a critical element in driving delays in obtaining the respective legislative approvals (with an 
average delay of 8 to 9 months). The WBG will make a conscious effort to initiate a structured 
dialogue with the Parliamentarians in the Legislature and seek to provide the necessary 
information and details on WBG operations, procedures and issues of specific interest to them. 
The proposed WBG program will focus, throughout, on strengthening the capacity to manage 
public resources (including WBG financed projects), improving good governance through social 
accountability mechanisms and promoting transparent public management. Better coordination 
with other development partners will be made to ensure more effective collaboration, either by 
creating dialogue spaces or by participating more actively in already established fora. 

71. Knowledge services should develop dissemination mechanisms fully integrated in 
the analytical process and aim to serve as a platform for policy dialogue on issues identified 
in the result areas. During the 2009-2014 period, the WBG delivered 31 Analytical and 
Advisory Activities (AAAs) products that provided analysis of public sector management, 
financial and private sector strengthening, economic policy, land management, education reform, 
etc. While some analytical pieces were well received and had positive policy impacts (e.g. tax 
reform, SOE reform) and informing dialogues on poverty (equity assessment, volatility study), 
others have not had the desired impact and their public availability was limited. This left an 
important body of analytical work under-used. Under the new CPS, the Government and the 

23 

 
  
 
 
 
 
WBG have agreed to a joint analytical and advisory program, to be complemented by 
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RASs) and just-in-time policy notes on specific topics 
following the pattern adopted by several MICs. Further, the WBG will also promote increased 
South-South knowledge exchanges which will be valuable for all stakeholders. 

72. 
The Government and the WBG held consultations to support the formulation of this 
CPS. Meetings held in Asuncion sought inputs from the international development community; 
key opinion leaders in the country; representatives of the private and financial sector and civil 
society represented by organizations working on issues of poverty, citizen participation, 
transparency, education and anti-corruption. Important topics covered and concerns raised 
included the importance for Paraguay to strengthen the capacity of the public sector (particularly 
for implementing public investment programs), to focus its development policies on the medium-
to-longer-term, and to integrate environmental sustainability in an inclusive way in the 
development framework (see Annex 6 for a more detailed description). 

C. Proposed WBG Program  
73. 
The CPS applies several filters in identifying the outcomes of its support. First, the 
expected results of the CPS are linked to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity as described in this section. The program seeks to support Paraguay to address longer-
run developmental bottlenecks to sustained poverty reduction and improved equity, while being 
cognizant of the past complex implementation experience in the country. Second, the CPS 
expected results reflect the priorities of the government’s NDP that is focused on the 
sustainability of the growth patterns, sharing the benefits of growth with the poor and near poor, 
and increasing the resilience to economic and nature risks. Third, the WBG support is closely 
related to analytical work and technical assistance (TA) in place which provide a good 
understanding of the delivery chains and risks, and the coordination with other development 
partners. A tighter WBG coordination should also enhance delivery. 

74. 
In addition, the CPS is selective by focusing on fewer and larger operations and a 
sharper, co-financed AAA program. Based on lessons from the past, the WBG will limit the 
number but work towards larger operations. Attention during the first two years will be on 
infrastructure and policy through a contingent DPL. The investment support of the CPS focuses 
on the asset supply of poor households, and includes specific targets of achieving synergies 
between the different IBRD financed operations and IFC programs which can support the GoP to 
create an operational platform to tackle poverty within the NDP. In developing a joint IBRD/IFC 
program, the analytical and advisory services will be designed under a coordinated and co-
financed Paraguay Analytical and Advisory Program (PAAP) to match the results areas and will 
support the overall CPS objectives. Specific attention will be placed on contributing to poverty 
reduction and increasing shared prosperity through the PAAP, particularly in the social sectors 
through targeted TA. The WBG, as part of the CPS, is launching a focused effort to improve 
project implementation performance by mitigating potential risks to the delivery of objectives. 
Adjustments will be made during the Performance Learning Review at the mid-point of CPS 
implementation.  

75. 
The proposed WBG Program is fully aligned with the NDP and aims to contribute 
to its overall poverty and equity targets. Hence, the higher level objective of this CPS is that 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
of the NDP to reduce extreme poverty to 9 percent by 2018 and fostering income growth of the 
bottom 40 percent, which is higher than the national average.  More specifically, the proposed 
WBG program in this CPS is integrated into priority objectives within the NDP which it will 
support, given the WBG’s current engagement and comparative advantage. Thus the proposed 
WBG program has selectively been built around three results areas: (i) strengthening resilience 
to risks and volatility; (ii) boosting pro-poor delivery of public goods and services; and (iii) 
fostering integrative markets. The results framework chosen for the CPS derives from the targets 
outlined in the NDP; and the WBG program results try to go, in most cases, beyond the 
individual achievements of a specific activity and will require the IBRD and IFC to work closely 
together in the programing of its instruments.  

Results Area 1: Strengthening Resilience to Risks and Volatility 

76. 
Under the CPS, the WBG will continue to support authorities’ efforts to mitigate the 
costs associated with the vulnerability of the poor to exogenous risks. First, efforts will focus 
on strengthening the ability of the households and producers –in particular the poor– to cope 
with price and climate shocks by furthering access to financial services, enhancing agricultural 
risk management and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Second, efforts will focus on 
strengthening the public finance management to help mitigate the impact of growth volatility and 
enabling private sector investments. It will also advise on the implementation of the FRL that 
aims to help the government manage volatility and its impact on fiscal balances. By defining a 
ceiling for the overall fiscal deficit and limitations on wage increases and public primary current 
expenditures, it formally requires the preparation of a medium term fiscal plan and will support a 
predictable fiscal policy to anchor private sector expectations and encourage investment.  

Result 1.1: Enhanced agricultural risk management 

NDP 2030 Indicator:  
* Mitigate the costs of natural disasters caused by climatic events 

WBG Result Indicators:  
* Agricultural insurance penetration rate increased by 15 percent by 2018 (2013 Baseline: 
0.39 percent) – will be measured disaggregated by gender in 2018. 

77. 
The WBG will support the development of an integrated agricultural risk 
management program that will help promote more equitable sustainable growth. Improved 
agricultural risk management is imperative given the weight of agriculture in the country’s 
economy as well as the potentially large impact of increased agricultural volatility on the low 
income segments of the population. The WBG’s support will come from technical assistance and 
through the Proyecto de Desarrollo Rural Sostenible (Sustainable Rural Development Project - 
PRODERS). Ongoing technical assistance provides support to the development of: (i) improved 
sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, (ii) design of agricultural insurance schemes for small 
farmers (increasing the insurance penetration rate measured as the volume of insurance 
premiums over agricultural GDP), (iii) better price formation through the introduction of a 
formal commodities exchange, and (iv) increased access to information on weather. PRODERS 
will support the development and deployment of an information system that will facilitate rapid 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response to emerging animal health issues. The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in September 
2011 demonstrated the vulnerability of the sector. The cattle industry was forced to slaughter 
some 1,000 animals to quell the outbreak and beef exports were banned for 80 days. 
Furthermore, droughts and floods have produced significant losses both in terms of agriculture 
export commodities as well as for family farmers producing for local markets, highlighting the 
urgent need for developing the market for risk transfer instruments, like agriculture insurance, to 
be able to smooth out incomes in light of natural disaster events. 

Result 1.2: Improved Financial Inclusion 

NDP 2030 Indicator:  
* Reaching financial inclusion of 100 percent of households by 2030 

WBG Result Indicators:  
* 50 percent of adults with savings accounts by 2018 (2013 baseline: 29 percent) -
disaggregated by gender 
* 163,000 individuals and microenterprises accessed to microfinance client services by 2018 
(2012 baseline: 125,000) 
* 7 percent of farmers with improved access to markets and access to enhanced productivity 
and financial services by 2018 (2013 baseline: 5 percent) 

78. 
The WBG will continue to support efforts to broaden and deepen Paraguay’s 
financial sector and promote sound and responsible financial inclusion. The development of 
inclusive and efficient financial markets will help poor households improve their livelihoods and 
small businesses grow by enabling them to save, invest and cope with economic uncertainties. 
The WBG assistance combines advisory services, policy-based lending, and investment lending. 
Ongoing advisory services will continue to support the design and implementation of a 
comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy, coordinating and leveraging efforts from 
public and private stakeholders as well as the donor community. The related institutional and 
regulatory reform agenda will be supported by a DPL. IFC will continue to support the financial 
sector development and financial inclusion agenda through ongoing investment operations, 
which could be strengthened through targeted advisory assistance to government and the key 
financial institutions to ensure the availability of financial services to more citizens and MSMEs. 
IFC’s business operations in financial markets since FY13 are cumulatively expected to increase 
access to financial services for about 17,500 SME clients and 163,000 microfinance clients, most 
of them in rural areas and agribusiness.  

Result 1.3: Improved environmental management 
NDP 2030 Indicator: 
* Reduce to zero the illegal deforestation rate 
WBG Result Indicators:  
* 
Improved forest management and conservation practices introduced on an area 
equivalent to 18 percent of the current Alto Paraná Atlantic Forest area 23 by 2018 (Baseline 
2014: 9 percent) 

23 Total current area of Alto Paraná’s Atlantic Forest is 1,702,000 hectares. Source WWF, 20014,

79. 
The WBG program assistance to the environmental sector focuses on institutional 
strengthening and forest land conservation. Rapid environmental degradation weakens the 
contribution of Paraguay’s natural resources wealth to growth. Technical assistance on 
institutional strengthening will focus on environmental compliance of sector agencies, such as 
the Secretary for the Environment in issuing water extraction licenses or the Ministry of Public 
Works in managing wastes produced by road construction. The WBG program continues to 
conserve the Atlantic Forest located in Paraguay through the introduction of sustainable forestry 
and land management practices that reducing emissions from deforestation and forest 
degradation. 

Results Area 2: Boosting Pro-Poor Delivery of Public Goods and Services 

80. 
During the CPS period, the WBG will focus on the pro-poor delivery of public goods 
and services. This includes support for efforts to raise revenue collection, make both taxing and 
spending more pro-poor, delivering quality services to the poor, and improving the 
accountability and transparency of public spending for the poor. The existing IBRD investment 
portfolio, a new DPL project, as well as analytical and advisory services, including the PAAP, 
would support the achievement of these results. 

Result 2.1: Increased Revenues and Progressivity of Fiscal Management 

NDP Indicator:  
* 
Improvement in the tax/GDP ratio to 18 percent by 2030 

WBG Result Indicators:  
* Total tax/GDP ratio increased from 11.5 percent (2013) to 14 percent (2018) and the 
progressivity of the tax system improved compared to the base year 2013 
* Progressivity of expenditures in social and infrastructure service delivery improved by 2018 
compared to baseline in 2013 

81. 
A core result of the WBG’s program during the CPS will be to support Government 
in raising the level and improving the incidence of taxation. Although Paraguay has 
undergone a thorough fiscal reform program since 2002, there remains an unfinished agenda to 
further raise fiscal revenues, render fiscal policy more progressive, and increase spending on 
priority social programs where expenditures are low and outcomes remain weak.  

82. 
The Government has taken initial steps to simultaneously enhance its ability to 
collect tax revenues and to make the system more neutral for consumption and investment 
decisions. The Bank will continue providing support for expanding the tax base and reducing 
regressive taxes as well as strengthening institutional capacity of the Tax Administration. The 
WBG is supporting the Government’s efforts to improve public spending efficiency through its 
advisory services. The proposed DPL/DDO will support (i) increasing the value added tax 
(VAT) rate applied to the financial sector from 5 percent to the standard rate of 10 percent; (ii) 
defining the VAT collection base for the agriculture sector and establishing a 5 percent rate to 
this tax base; (iii) replacing the existing agricultural income tax with a new Tax on Agriculture 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Income (Corporate tax for agricultural activities – IRAGRO) to fix the loopholes in the system.  
Estimates are that these efforts will increase the ratio of tax collection to GDP and reduce the 
burden on the bottom 40 percent. 

83. 
The WBG will also provide technical assistance –under the PAAP– to the STP on 
the overall monitoring and evaluation of the NDP as well as on the development of 
instruments for targeting. Such technical assistance would be geared to (i) monitor progress 
towards overall poverty and inequality targets in Paraguay, including analysis as to the main 
drivers of poverty dynamics; (ii) develop an overall framework for executing and monitoring the 
implementation of the NDP, and executing it; (iii) update the targeting instruments of several 
programs aiming to reach the most vulnerable groups, including the conditional cash transfer 
program Tekoporã and the non-contributory pension program for the elderly Adultos Mayores; 
and (iv) support the design and implementation of a single registry of beneficiaries of all social 
programs, which constitutes a necessary pillar for an inclusive, transparent and efficient social 
protection system. For the latter, the WBG will facilitate South-South knowledge exchanges. 

Result 2.2: Improved Access to Quality Public Services for the Poor 
NDP 2030 Indicator:  
* Universalization of access to potable water and improved sanitation (currently 85 percent 
and 79 percent) 

WBG Result Indicators: 
* 10 percent of urban extreme poor in Asunción metropolitan area benefiting from improved 
environmental sanitation by 2018 (2014 Baseline: 0) –disaggregated by gender 
Indigenous peoples with access to sustainable water increased from 2.5 percent (2013) to 6.5 
percent (2018) - disaggregated by gender 

* 

84. 
The WBG will maintain its engagement on providing improved access to and better 
quality of basic services for the rural poor, emphasizing the provision of improved water 
and sanitation. Three ongoing IBRD programs and a grant-funded project will work on 
bettering basic services to the poor, largely but not exclusively based on geographic targeting to 
the poorest districts. The largest (including a recently approved additional financing) of these 
operations is the integrated rural development program PRODERS that focuses on community-
based delivery of basic infrastructure services in the poorest districts of the country. The 
Biodiversity Project supports demand based provision of basic infrastructure to poor indigenous 
communities. Ongoing investments in water and sanitation support access to sustainable water 
systems in indigenous communities, with an emphasis on their operation and maintenance to 
increase sustainability. The ongoing energy operation aims to improve the reliability and quality 
of electricity throughout the country. 

85. 
In addition the WBG program will pay specific attention to institution building 
activities designed to improve delivery of quality services through resources planning and 
management. The ongoing roads project helps 
the Ministry of Public Works and 
Communications (MOPC) prioritizing road maintenance activities. The water and sanitation 
project focuses on improved management of the water utility. The agricultural program supports 
community organization development and capacity building. The energy project supports 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
institutional strengthening to improve managerial decision making. 

Result 2.3: Improved Social Accountability and Transparency 

NDP 2030 Indicator:   
* Ensuring the transparency of public expenditures at all three levels of the Government and in 
all three democratic powers 

WBG Result Indicators:  
* Open Information Law 24 fully implemented by at least 20 percent of government agencies by 
2018 (2014 baseline: 9 percent) 
* At least 10 new education sector information tools and 15 datasets available for internal 
management and public access by 2018 (2014 baseline: 0) 
* At least two social accountability mechanisms under the Open Government initiative are 
successfully implemented by independent CSOs by 2018 (2014 baseline: 0) 

86. 
The WBG will support the GoP in its open government and transparency agenda 
that includes enabling greater civic engagement (easing public access to relevant 
information on government budgets, budgetary processes, norms of service, and service 
performance data). Except for the ongoing energy program, all IBRD ongoing and planned 
investment program include social auditing that enables citizens to provide structured feedback 
to public sector on the quality of services delivery. In PRODERS and the Biodiversity Project, 
this includes opportunities for communities to identify and prioritize the assistance they receive 
to address their development needs. In the Water and Sanitation Project, this includes the 
development of “citizen’s commitment charters” between the communities and the state-owned 
water and sanitation utility. This social watch mechanism tracks standards and improvements, 
including reports on service providers and the quality of services. It provides for complaints 
mechanisms and establishes rights and obligations for users. Importantly, the WBG has been 
invited in by the Government to work with the Tekoporã conditional cash transfer program to 
develop a model for civil society-government partnership for more transparent and accountable 
implementation of the program. Further, all AAA activities under the PAAP will include an 
actionable – or content – social accountability angle. 

87. 
As part of the CPS, a special attention will be given to provide technical assistance 
to the Ministry of Education to strengthen four policies that are critical to improving the 
transparency, accountability and effectiveness of the education system. First, it will support 
a thorough review of education financing and the development of alternative resource-allocation 
options for basic school inputs, which are currently regressive and distribute more resources to 
areas that have better endowments. This is geared to prepare the grounds for an Education 
Finance Law which would regulate all public resources allocations, including the Fondo 
Nacional de Inversión Pública y Desarrollo (National Public Investment and Development Fund 
- FONACIDE), determining in a clear and transparent way the responsibility of education 
authorities at all levels: national, departmental, municipal and in the schools. Second, it will 
focus on identifying the policy levers to improve efficiency and quality of service delivery. 

24 The Open Information Law  (Ley 5189/2014) makes mandatory the publication of salaries and allowances 
received by the civil service. 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
Special attention will be paid on revising policies to improve quality of teaching, which have 
been found in Paraguay and elsewhere to be the most important determinant of the effectiveness 
of an education system. 25 Pre-service teacher professional development, in-service teacher 
training and evaluation of teachers are going to be the initial areas of focus. Third, the WBG 
would support strengthening the education information system to provide the mechanisms for 
evidence-based policy making and better accountability and overall governance. Finally, the 
WBG will provide technical assistance to help the Ministry of Education prepare sound 
proposals to be financed by FONACIDE. 

Results Area 3: Fostering Market Integration 

88. 
The WBG aims to support Paraguay in fostering market integration to create better 
opportunities for smallholder farmers to participate in markets and for overall 
connectivity to improve. This will be achieved through a comprehensive program that increases 
productivity of the small farmers complemented by interventions that decrease the time and cost 
of access to markets as well as leverages private sector knowledge and capital to improve 
connectivity and reduce logistics costs. Complementary support to a dynamic and rapidly 
growing private sector will include advisory services to promote improved access to business 
services, technology and finance to link producers to emerging value chains.  

Result 3.1: Improved Agricultural Productivity and Access to Markets for Small-holder Farmers 
NDP 2030 Indicator:   
* Reducing to less than 3 percent the productivity gap of land use between family farming and 
commercial farming 

WBG Result Indicators:  
* 
Income of 15 percent of poor households (out of 130,000) in Concepción, San Pedro, 
Canindeyú, Caaguazú and Caazapá increased by 30 percent by 2018 (2013 Baseline: annual 
income is G4 million) disaggregated by gender. 
* 130 additional indigenous communities’ (representing more than 50 percent of Indigenous 
Peoples in Paraguay) economic development improved through enhancement of 
organizational capacity and better quality living conditions by 2018 (2014 baseline: 45 
communities) disaggregated by gender. 

89. 
The WBG will pilot support for smallholder farmers to increase technical 
knowledge and to access inputs as a contribution to greater productivity. Financing from 
PRODERS will improve the socio-economic conditions of small-scale farmers and indigenous 
communities through increasing the number of extension agents and providing farmers with 
access to inputs while linking them to value chains. The project is designed to increase the 
incomes of 25,500 small-holder farmers by 30 percent by 2018 and recent simulations suggest 
this may help lift an additional 125,000 people out of poverty. IFC’s trade finance program with 
five Paraguayan banking institutions worth US$110 million has guaranteed over US$450 million 
in trade flows, primarily related to fertilizers, agricultural machinery, agricultural commodities,

and leather and meat. Looking ahead, IFC intends to further expand this collaboration by 
strengthening the country’s agricultural sector and small-scale farmers, aiming to increase or 
improve sustainable farming opportunities for close to 11,000 farmers. The WBG will work with 
government on scaling-up these pilot interventions and will revisit the broader impact during the 
progress report. The results indicators are based on household surveys which include gender 
related questions, such as if the head of household is a woman, among many others. 

Result 3.2: Increased private investments in logistics projects/initiatives and reduced logistics 
costs 

NDP 2030 Indicator:  
* Consolidation of an efficient and effective transport network that reduces logistics costs to 
internationally competitive levels 

WBG Result Indicators: 
* At least two public private partnership transactions in transport/logistics by 2018 (2014 
baseline: 0). 
* Travel time on two 200 km segments of roads in selected priority Departments (San Pedro, 
Caaguazú and Caazapá, or similar) reduced by at least 30 minutes by 2018 (Baseline 2014: 
average travel time for a 200 km segment of a national road is 3 hours and 20 minutes) 26 

90. 
The WBG prioritizes, jointly with other development partners, supporting 
Paraguay in raising the connectivity and integration of isolated rural communities. 
Paraguay has launched a large program involving the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IADB), the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA) and the WBG to improve road infrastructure and connectivity in the poorest parts 
of the country through investments in feeder and trunk roads. The WBG will continue working 
on critical components such as rehabilitation of trunk roads in selected corridors in the poorest 
districts, institutional strengthening to improve asset maintenance and the launching of a road 
safety program designed to address the rapidly increasing public health crisis associated with 
road accidents and fatalities. Under the CPS, the WBG will finance a share of the ambitious 
investment plans in rural roads through existing and potentially new financing commitments. 

91. 
Technical assistance will help Paraguay identify logistics bottlenecks and ways of 
addressing them. Improving competitiveness and bringing down the costs of doing business in 
Paraguay requires addressing the infrastructure gap, particularly in the transport sector. Ongoing 
TA 27 on the costs of transporting export commodities from the farm to the market reveals that 
logistics costs are currently estimated to be half of the freight on board cost of delivering grain to 
port in Asuncion. Particularly telling is that road congestion in Asuncion, both access to the 
metropolitan area and to the port terminals, represents 25 to 30 percent of the inland transport 
from the farm to gateway port. This TA will help identify logistical bottlenecks and set priorities 
for investment.

92. 
The Government has identified public private partnerships (PPPs) as one of the 
instruments they will use to close the infrastructure gap while bringing innovation and 
efficiency to infrastructure asset management. As IBRD, IFC is engaged in infrastructure and 
service investments to enhance the competitive advantage of Paraguay’s agribusiness sector 
through key infrastructure investments. IFC’s support to barge transport operators in the hidrovía 
covers about 30 percent of the country’s soy production and 40 percent of fuel transport. Over 
the next CPS period, IFC is keen to expand its financing of critical infrastructure investments, 
including direct investments and advising the GoP on the structuring of PPP projects. The focus 
of the WBG’s assistance in this area is to strengthening the Government’s program through the 
development of institutional capacity as well as financing options for key infrastructure assets 
such as roads, airports and the hidrovía. 

D. Implementing the FY15-18 Country Partnership Strategy 
93. 
The overall WBG financial support is expected to be in the range of US$900 million 
to US$1,100 million during the CPS period. This includes an indicative IBRD program of 
about US$600 - US$700 million as well as expected IFC financing for the private sector in the 
range of US$300 - US$400 million, assuming appropriate market conditions. The Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will also play a role to facilitate and broaden the 
involvement of foreign private investments within PPP initiatives by providing political and 
credit risk insurances to foreign investors. The actual volume of IBRD lending will depend on 
how program performance evolves in the course of the CPS period, continued government 
interest in IBRD financing, and on IBRD’s lending capacity and demand from other borrowers.  

94. 
Total current IBRD exposure to Paraguay is US$352.2 million with FY14 
disbursement totaling US$47.2 million. The active portfolio consists of 4 IBRD loans for a 
total of US$375 million – US$265.2 million remains undisbursed (See Table 2). The Bank also 
manages a portfolio of 10 trust funds (of which one GEF project) for a total of US$5.6 million. 
Only two of these are Bank administered Trust Funds (TFs). The disbursement rate for FY14 
was 21.8 percent, a strong increase from FY13 8.64 percent.

96. 
The WBG program performance during the FY10-14 CPS was rated moderately 
unsatisfactory. As the results under the new strategy will be largely influenced by the ongoing 
portfolio the team has taken into consideration the lessons learned (see Annex 2) in the design of 
the proposed approach. The successful IFC engagement provides an excellent opportunity for 
IBRD-IFC synergies and joint activities under the new CPS and cooperation will be furthered 
under the new engagement areas. 

97. 
Close supervision and implementation support need to be strengthened further 
under the new CPS. The IBRD program has faced important challenges, particularly in the 
implementation of Investment Project Financing (IPF), which will continue to be addressed 
during the new CPS. Implementation of the four active IPF operations (in agriculture, energy, 
roads, and water and sanitation) has experienced significant challenges starting with major 
delays in becoming effective. The effectiveness delays of the projects coupled with rather 
complex design and safeguards arrangements, involving several institutions and high staff 
turnover (partially due to the political crisis in 2012) have impacted the overall portfolio 
execution. While disbursements picked up in FY14 with a disbursement ratio of 21 percent, the 
challenge is how to sustain this pace during the new CPS period. Going forward, the WBG will 
provide close implementation support including regular portfolio performance reviews and, for 
new engagements, use simpler project design avoiding schemes with several implementing 
agencies to reduce coordination demands. 

98. While Development Policy Loans (DPLs) suffered from similar effectiveness delays, 
their implementation has been more successful in supporting critical public sector reforms. 
Effectiveness delays did not have a major impact on the achievement of results of the DPL 
operations given that they focus on policy and institutional actions that are completed prior to the 
operation becoming effective. DPLs have focused on public sector management using the rich 
analysis from years of economic and sector work. The lessons learned from designing DPLs in 
Paraguay underscore the importance of national ownership of reform actions and striking the 
right balance between political feasibility and depth of reforms. A strong knowledge background 
is essential for the choice of policy actions and evaluation of their relevance and political 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
feasibility. More specifically expertise in the specificities and challenges of the country is 
essential for a proper assessment of the support for reforms across constituencies and gauging of 
political risk. Sustained engagement on the part of the Bank is also considered critical for 
supporting reform processes over the medium term. 

99. 
Implementing the strategy the WBG will keep different levels of engagement, 
starting with the twice-a-year portfolio reviews that involve the MoH, the line ministries, 
and the WBG teams and management. In addition, some innovations already in place, such as 
the use of e-disbursement on a pilot basis with the GEF Paraguay Biodiversity project could be 
extended to other projects. All portfolio procurement plans are now published on the 
Procurement Plan Execution System (SEPA - www.iniciativasepa.org) which brings public 
disclosure to past and future procurement actions. Additionally, the Implementation Status and 
Results Reports (ISRs) are now translated in Spanish and made available to upload on the 
clients’ official websites. 

100. Mainstreaming gender in the WBG. The WBG will continue to mainstream gender 
issues both in lending and non-lending activities, and the gender disaggregated indicators will 
updated by the time of the Performance Learning Review. It will introduce the SWIFT (Survey 
on Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking) monitoring system for every new operation to 
track disaggregated data and monitor potential differences in impact on men and women. 
SWIFT’s survey will register the respondent's and all household members’ gender for statistical 
purposes. In addition, the SWIFT team, in collaboration with the WBG Gender Team, will 
consider additional gender-specific questions pertaining to, inter alia, domestic violence, 
employment opportunities and access to social services, which might be relevant for a more 
comprehensive understanding of these issues (for more detail see Annex 10). 

101. The Bank will continue its support for further developing the country systems. The 
country Public Financial Management (PFM) system has not been fully utilized in the 
implementation of the IBRD Paraguay portfolio due to a number of issues including: (i) 
complicated flow of funds procedures; (ii) lack of skilled staff and high personnel turnover in the 
implementing agencies; and (iii) the need for an upgrade of the accounting module of the 
Sistema de Contabilidad (Integrated Financial Management System – SICO) at the government 
level. In recent years some progress has been made with the introduction of budget 
commitments, development of the Modelo Estándar de Control Interno del Paraguay (Standard 
Model of Internal Control Manual - MECIP). Nevertheless, challenges remain and particular 
attention will be paid to strengthening internal controls and building institutional capacity of the 
internal audit function to facilitate transitioning to use of country systems. 

102. Procurement strengthening will be furthered under the CPS with the goal of 
preparing the transition to use of the country’s procurement systems. The Bank is 
supporting the Dirección Nacional de Compras Públicas (National Procurement Office - DNCP) 
to strengthen their Public Procurement System. The pilot program using reverse auction system 
for shopping of goods (up to US$50,000) in Bank-financed projects has closed with promising 
results. Significant savings were obtained and the Bank is looking into extending it up to 
National Competitive Bidding thresholds. In addition, DNCP has taken the first steps in the 
“framework contracts” method. The Bank is closely monitoring the development of this initiative 
with the possibility to gradually incorporate this method in Bank-financed projects. In addition 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
the Bank has started to work with DNCP to provide technical assistance and support: (i) DNCP 
system re-engineering (e-procurement); (ii) digital signature certification; (iii) open contracting; 
(iv) complaint system; and (v) internal management system for the Unidades Operativas de 
Contrataciones (Decentralized Public Procurement Agencies -UOC). The benefits of this support 
and assistance would have an impact not only on Bank’s financed Projects, but also on the whole 
Paraguayan public investment system. 

103. The CPS will continue to support the Open Government and Open Data initiatives 
agenda articulated in the NDP. The initiatives aim to increase public sector transparency and 
improve social accountability mechanisms. The GoP issued its second Open Government 2014-
2016 Action Plan in July 2014, following President Cartes' declaration of that "what is public 
shall be public". The NDP endorsed an international social accountability initiative under the 
Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) in which Paraguay was among eight 
countries selected to enhance citizen engagement to facilitate the dissemination of public 
information, and make the GoP more accountable. Ongoing IBRD operations have a mechanism 
for social accountability, and through the GPSA grant, a group of CSOs will audit social 
spending in the Tekoporã program and related social protection networks. All IBRD and GEF 
operations will apply SWIFT to monitor progress in their impact on poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity indicators, and with the inclusion of gender specific impacts.  

104. Partnerships and Coordination. Development partners are mostly engaged in 
strengthening commercial and international trade ties, and the specialized financial support is 
provided by multilaterals, such as the IADB, the CAF and the European Union (EU). In the 
governance agenda, the WBG also works closely with lead of the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID). The WBG is particularly focused on the poverty reduction 
agenda, at the request of the GoP, and with the lead of the MoH and STP in the Social Cabinet, 
coordination meetings are being organized since 2014 to disseminate the NDP (see Annex 4 for a 
more detailed description the main programs in Paraguay). The process of harmonizing 
development partners in Paraguay has had different arrangements through time and the WBG 
would continue to facilitate that dialogue, such as during the consultations during the CPS (see 
Annex 6 on more details from the consultations with stakeholders). 

IV. MANAGING RISKS 
105. The outcomes targeted by this CPS are subject to various economic and political risks as 
well as risks related to institutional capacity and program implementation. Overall risk is rated as 
“substantial” with several risk categories described in more details below. 

106. Economic risks. The main risk in Paraguay is the economic management of volatility 
derived from agriculture. Paraguay’s economic growth has become more volatile in recent years 
which stems from external shocks and shocks to an agricultural sector, whose weight within the 
overall economy has grown in recent decades. Volatility has wide-ranging impacts on the 
economy, including productive sector performance, tax revenue, and on poverty and equality 
rates. Particularly, poor people working in agriculture are exposed to sharp swings in activity and 
thereby in their incomes. Volatility also renders planning and forecasting more difficult for 
macroeconomic management. A related risk is the exposure of Paraguay to external shocks due 
to limited diversification of its product base and trading partners. Paraguay remains highly 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
vulnerable to regional and global economic fluctuations and to weather-related shocks. In 
particular, the slowdown in Paraguay’s main trade partners, Argentina and Brazil, may 
negatively affect demand for Paraguayan exports. Another challenge is linked to the limited 
fiscal resources that constrain spending on human development and growth enhancing policies. 
However, as the country’s exports are mainly commodities, reductions in the demand of regional 
partners can be compensated in other international markets, albeit with a lag. Adverse shocks to 
the Paraguayan economy are likely to have adverse impacts on government revenues and the 
ability of the Government to provide public services and investment.  

107. 
Institutional capacity and implementation risk. Public sector capacity constraints are 
considerable in Paraguay and constitute a major challenge to successful budget execution, 
completion of key investment projects and implementation of reform programs. The limited 
number of technical staff in core ministries and project implementation units poses 
implementation risks. Investment projects supported both under the government budget and by 
international financial institutions suffer from long years of slow implementation with major cost 
increases in the overall value of the projects. The Government’s ambitious agenda for attracting 
large infrastructure investments through PPPs may not materialize due to weak investment 
programming capacity and regulatory risks. There are also limitations in the assessment and 
mitigation of social and environmental risks, which may result in excessive delays in the 
implementation of infrastructure projects. In addition weak inter-institutional coordination could 
put the success of the Government’s reform program at risk. However, the Government’s NDP 
aims at increasing inter-institutional coordination and establishing Monitoring and Evaluation 
(M&E) mechanisms for achieving results on time. The WBG will continue supporting the MoH 
and other line ministries to build fiduciary capacity for better management public investments. 
The Bank also supports institutional capacity through its non-lending TA for strengthening Tax 
Administration and SOEs’ corporate governance structure. 

108. Governance risks and corruption. Paraguay ranks very low in good governance 
indicators, such as the perception of corruption measured by Transparency International which 
places Paraguay in the 150th place out of 177 countries. 28 Tackling corruption and improving 
governance is more than a short-term development goal. Importantly, the Government is 
pursuing a number of important initiatives, including the dissemination of public information 
through public websites, using feedback hotlines for public procurement and discussing in the 
Legislative Branch a public information law. The WBG will continue supporting initiatives 
aligned with the open government agenda of the NDP and providing fiduciary support to 
implementation units in line ministries. The WBG will also be supporting social accountability 
schemes from independent civil society organizations under a grant from the GPSA. 

109. Political Risks: The Paraguayan political system elects the President and the members of 
the Legislative Branch for a period of five years simultaneously. President Cartes currently 
enjoys a majority in the Legislative Branch. Nevertheless, Paraguayan political dynamics does 
not always imply an alignment between the governing party and its Legislature representatives. 
Therefore, ensuring the support from the Legislative Branch for the approval of IBRD loans is a 
key issue that needs to be dealt in a one-by-one basis. The election of mayors will take place in 
2015 and it can potentially influence the political scene. However, the WBG program is focused

on poverty reduction and shared prosperity, an area which is a priority across the political 
spectrum. The WBG will make a special effort to reach different parties in the Legislative 
Branch to better explain the scope and priorities of the WBG program in Paraguay.

INTRODUCTION 

I. 
1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) is a self-evaluation by 
the World Bank Paraguay country team of its performance in implementing the Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS - report #48087-PY) for the period FY09-14. The CPSCR summarizes 
and evaluates the support provided through the delivery of a tailored development solutions 
package of financial, knowledge, and convening services. The CPSCR is intended to (a) assess 
CPS program performance to achieve the Bank’s 30 expected outcomes measured against the 
updated CPS Results Matrix; and (b) assess the Bank and IFC performance in delivering their 
respective programs. 31 The CPS implementation lessons are aimed to help formulate the new 
engagement with Paraguay.  

2. 
The CPS provided a framework for a flexible, knowledge-focused partnership with 
somewhat 
less 
innovative 
tailored financial solutions 
in 
three key 
thematic areas:  
(i) Governance and Anti-Corruption; (ii) Poverty; and (iii) Economic Growth with Inclusion.  

3. 
The CPS Progress Report of April 2012 (CPSPR – report #66782-PY) reaffirmed the 
Bank’s support to the three key original thematic areas, while introducing some adjustments to 
the results framework in light of shifting priorities and implementation fine-tuning. The program 
performance is evaluated against the adjusted framework. 

4. 
The lending program has responded to evolving Government priorities; it supported 
structural areas of the Government’s long term development program, as well as its response to 
the impact of the global economic crisis of 2009. 32 More specifically, the program supported the 
government’s economic policies and its capacity to provide basic services. The economic policy 
components provided support in areas such as fiscal transparency and macroeconomic policy; it 
also provided budget support after the global crisis. The other aspect of the Bank’s program 
provided greater access to basic infrastructure services, such as water, sanitation, electricity, and 
transportation. In the timeframe of the CPS, four lending operations for a total of $364 million 
were approved. 33 

5. 
Knowledge and convening services have become an important element of the Bank’s 
engagement with Paraguay; the Bank delivered 31 analytic and advisory activities (AAA) in the 
timeframe that spans this report, in areas such as governance/anticorruption, fiscal framework, 
service delivery, and growth/competitiveness. This effort was not unaffected by 
the 
aforementioned changes in the national administrations, which produced conflicting priorities 
and demands. 

6. 
In the private sector, IFC has had a highly successful program, significantly increasing its 
investments in Paraguay since 2009. The program has a strong focus on financial services, but 

30 From this point forward, references to the “Bank” refer exclusively to IBRD.  
31 IBRD and IFC strategies were developed separately, because IFC began operations in the country after the CPS 
was drafted and discussed by the Board of Executive Directors. 
32 The difficult period of the global economic crisis was exacerbated by drought and outbreaks of foot/mouth disease 
in the cattle industry. This period also experienced strong political turmoil, leading to the impeachment of 
President Fernando Lugo in June 2012; this was followed by three different governments in the CPS timeframe. 
33 Unless otherwise specified, the currency used throughout this report is the U.S. dollar.  

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
has also supported Paraguay‘s burgeoning agribusiness sector and made several river 
transportation investments. These enabled IFC to reach substantial numbers of the poor and 
underserved. IFC transactions with local banks have supported microfinance, small and medium-
size enterprises (SMEs), and small farms through earmarked loans to increase the availability of 
longer-term and local currency financing to these client segments. 

7. 
Overall, program implementation was slow for most of the CPS timeframe. In 
coordination with the respective governments, the Bank continually worked to improve 
implementation, including by providing: (a) capacity-building workshops in procurement, 
safeguards, and financial management; and (b) monthly project-specific procurement support. As 
a result of this concerted effort, implementation improved in the second half of the CPS, with the 
portfolio reaching a 21.8 percent disbursement ratio in FY14. However, implementation 
challenges remain. The combination of complex project design, lack of coordination between co-
executors of different components of the projects, frequent staff turnover in some project 
implementation units (in particular because of the political turmoil in 2012), limited technical 
and safeguards capacity, complex safeguards arrangements, and inadequate resources to learn 
about other experiences contributed to implementation challenges. 

8. 
Traditional politics in the Legislative Branch was an important element driving 
effectiveness delays. Overall, projects took an average of 8.9 months to become effective; for 
lending operations the average delay was 9.4 months and for trust funds the average was 8.2 
months. When combined with limited local capacity to prepare and manage projects and frequent 
staff turnover, implementation delays were inevitable.  

9. 
Based on an extensive analysis of the CPS outcomes during the implementation period, 
the program performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory and the Bank’s performance in 
implementing the strategy is rated as fair. 

II. 

CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

A. OVERVIEW 

10. 
Program performance evaluates the expected results by end FY-14 as presented in the 
CPS and updated in the CPS Progress Report of April 2012. CPS performance, particularly the 
pace of implementation, was a challenge throughout the period; this is reflected in the 
achievement of the intended objectives, which were in the most part partially achieved. Of the 42 
outcomes in the results matrix, 14 were achieved, 17 partially achieved, and 11 not achieved. 
Furthermore, three of the four active lending operations have been rated “problem projects” for 
most of the CPS period under review. Thus, the World Bank’s overall program performance is 
rated moderately unsatisfactory. 

B. PROGRESS BY STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT THEMES 

Pillar 1. Governance and Anticorruption: Strengthening state institutions to improve 
policymaking, public service provision, and rule of law for investments and households  

44 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
11. 
Fighting corruption and increasing transparency. To promote good governance and 
anticorruption, the Bank provided analytical and advisory activities and built in governance in 
lending operations. Two Development Policy Loans (DPLs) (P113457 and P117043) 
successfully helped to establish internal financial controls for intensified government 
accountability. Specifically, they contributed to the implementation of a merit-based civil service 
recruitment and promotion system, as well as to the establishment of internal control norms for 
ministerial budgeting. Through the Global Partnership Facility (GPF) Building Accountability 
Coalition Project (P117391), training was provided to 196 journalists, as well as capacity-
building programs for various ministries creating frameworks for the transparent dissemination 
of information in Government agencies. In addition, specific attention was given to governance 
in the portfolio: the Road Maintenance Project (P082026) developed an Improve Governance 
Action Plan (IGAP), which has been functioning within an electronic platform (Control Board) 
since 2010; the uses of the Control Board and IGAP have been expanded to all activities and 
projects managed by the Ministry of Public Works. The Sustainable Agriculture and Rural 
Development Project (PRODERS) (P088799) has helped strengthen neighborhood committees in 
30 micro watersheds to allow for control mechanisms for public sector investments; and the 
Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project (P095235) has its own website, as well as an 
action plan for a governance strategy and a framework to monitor governance indicators. 
Achievements include the establishment of quarterly reports on product delivery and outcome 
indicators within various government agencies. Through AAA, the Bank has assisted the 
institutional strengthening of the National Audit Office and the legislative budgeting process. 34 

12. Modernization of 
the public administration 
to 
improve service delivery. The 
programmatic DPLs and some advisory services helped improve the functioning of the public 
administration across a range of institutions: ministries, the CBP, and state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs). At the request of the MoH, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) 
assessment led by the European Union (EU) was conducted jointly with IADB and the Bank 
until 2011. It concluded that important progress had been made in the area of internal controls 
and audit (in particular, a standardized internal control framework was introduced by decree and 
intensive capacity building to support implementation). The work on internal control and internal 
audit at the Central Government contributed to reform implementation at the Office of the 
Executive’s Internal Auditor (AGPE), providing broader coverage and higher quality of the 
internal audit function, and expansion of a set of internal control rules within 70 percent of 
ministries, paving the way for the improvement achieved in various ministries. Support to the 
CBP included knowledge services (FBS Payments System P110984 and RAS Payment Systems 
#2 P122533) to set up automated transfer systems for processing of payments as well as creating 
a legal and regulatory framework for their operation. The strategy envisioned improving civil 
servant recruitment and promotion practices by implementing a merit-based framework. Progress 
toward achieving indicators included a draft law that was presented during President Lugo’s 
mandate. It delivered a diagnostic of the state of human capital in the MoH and provided 
concrete recommendations to improve its status; however, there was no enforcement mechanism 
for the system. A revision of intergovernmental transfers was undertaken. 

13. 

Increasing the transparency of SOEs and setting a framework through which they can

Strengthening Congressional Legislative Process and Budget Oversight Capacity TA (P115219), respectively.

operate more efficiently was addressed through the public sector strengthening DPLs and their 
complementary knowledge services; as well as within the water and energy sector IPFs 35. The 
DPLs (P113457 and P117043) addressed SOE strengthening by: (a) developing a mechanism for 
the payment of SOEs’ outstanding debt (this wasn’t completed); (b) increasing the rate of timely 
payments (from 27 percent to 51 percent); (c) strengthening SOE internal audit systems; and (d) 
implementing Results-Based Management contracts. The Energy Sector Program experienced 
implementation delays – and the goal of reducing power outages and their adverse effects on the 
economy was not achieved because of implementation such delays. The Water and Sanitation 
Project has provided more tangible results: each W&S agency has developed its own website and 
various institutions are working on frameworks to provide more information (for example, 
financial statements) through these websites. Complementary knowledge services included PY 
Public Sector NLTA (P117046) and the PY Public Sector Effectiveness (P120699), which aimed 
to generate new pricing mechanisms to address SOE internal finances.  

Pillar 2 Poverty: Improving investments in the social sectors (Health and Education) and 
focusing public spending on fighting extreme poverty 

14. 
The WBG partnership under 
this pillar was designed 
to contribute 
to  
(a) employment generation and poverty reduction, (b) agrarian reform and reactivation of small-
scale (household) agriculture, (c) increasing enrollment rates and the quality of secondary 
education, (d) increasing access to water and sewerage services for the entire population, and  
(e) increasing access to basic health services of good quality. 

15. 
Poverty reduction and employment generation. Together with the Paraguay Public 
Sector Reform DPL (P113457), various poverty assessments 36 were conducted to analyze, 
through new methodologies, the determinants of poverty and to increase the impact of 
Government transfer programs. More specifically, the AAA focused on improving the scope and 
targeting of the government cash transfer program “Tekoporã”, as well as the non-contributory 
pensions program “Adultos Mayores.” Targeting under Tekoporã significantly improved through 
the introduction of a geographic targeting and door-to-door census. The number of households 
integrated into the program has exceeded its target (40 percent of households in extreme poverty 
are covered under the program) and various methods have been designed to fine-tune the 
programs’ targeting; however, the frequency of transfers has been unstable since 2010 because of 
budgetary difficulties. At the same time, a chapter on Paraguay’s non-contributory pension was 
included in the regional study Beyond Pensions in Latin America (P129699). Finally, during the 
last phase of the CPS, the Bank provided technical assistance (TA) to the Ministry of Justice and 
Labor to review and assess its National Employment Strategy, including the initial design of a 
Temporary Employment Program. 

16. 
Poverty and macroeconomics. Preparing strategies to respond to the effects of an 
economic crisis that implicates employment was set as an important part of the Bank’s 

35 Investment Project Financing (IPF) 
36 PY Equity Assessment and Poverty Support (P132332); PY Social Protection NLTA (P106877); NLTA 
Programmatic Poverty II (P123533); Paraguay HD Programmatic Activity (P146699).  

46 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
engagement, for which it prepared a series of five AAA products. 37 The AAA activities 
examined the link between growth, employment, and poverty reduction; other activities analyzed 
these trends through the country’s Mercosur trade strategy. The results show that growth and 
poverty reduction seem to be linked through three main phenomena: (a) high levels of initial 
inequality in income and assets holdings (such as land); (b) a rural growth pattern; and (c) rising 
food prices that affect the extremely poor. The Bank also engaged in the review of the National 
Employment Plan, which supported the creation of an independent Ministry of Labor, 
Employment and Social Security, to allow for a more rapid, focused, and efficient institution to 
respond to labor market issues.  

17. 
Integrated agrarian reform and reactivation of small-scale agriculture. The preparation 
of a coherent reform of the agriculture sector was an important part of the actions set out by both 
the Government and the Bank to reduce poverty. The Bank’s projects involved programs such as 
the aforementioned Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project (PRODERS) 
(P088799) 38 to provide support to the rural poor population and to increase the number of 
indigenous communities with formal property titles. PRODER has been a success and additional 
financing was requested, which was processed by the Bank team in record time. A Country Land 
Assessment (P123711) was carried out to assess land use change and to evaluate the land 
property market. It established a strong link between access to agricultural credit and inequality, 
as well as limited access of the poor to leased land; it also recommended framing land reform 
within a broad rural development strategy and explained the risks of unsustainable grazing with 
respect to long-term soil erosion. In addition, the Bank supported Government efforts through 
facilitating a knowledge exchange about land reform experiences in LAC.  

18. 
Increase enrollment rates and quality of secondary education. As part of a strategy to 
increase registration rates and the quality of secondary education, during the second half of the 
CPS period the Government requested Bank assistance to develop a methodology that would 
help identify the most important needs of the school system. To that end, the Bank delivered the 
“Improve Evidence-Based Decision-Making within the Ministry of Education of Paraguay” 
study (P129179), which found that reforms to improve access to education should focus on 
designing a financial structure to ensure the provision of basic infrastructure and school inputs, 
as well as putting in place policies to increase the quality of schooling, including explicit and 
transparent rules for recruiting, training, and motivating teachers. These findings were 
disseminated through several workshops to relevant partners.  

19. 
Increase access to water and sewerage services for the entire population. The WBG 
addressed this goal through the rural and urban components of the PY Water and Sanitation 
Sector Modernization Project (P095235). Although the project experienced significant start-up 
delays, implementation is gaining momentum at the end of the CPS period and the development 
objective is still within reach. Under Component 1 (Support to the Modernization of the Sector), 
the project has so far developed and is implementing a Governance Action Plan to improve 

37 PY Equity Assessment and Poverty Support (P132332); PY Social Protection NLTA (P106877); NLTA 
Programmatic Poverty II (P123533); Paraguay HD Programmatic Activity (P146699); and PY Mercosur Trade 
Study (P108545). 
38 The project is currently ongoing and has obtained an additional financing for US$ 100 million which is awaiting 
effectiveness by the Legislative Branch. 

47 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
communication, participation, transparency, and accountability in the sector and is finalizing the 
preparation of the national water and sanitation policy and strategy. The second component 
focused on strengthening the Empresa de Servicios Sanitarios de Paraguay (ESSAP); this 
intervention has registered some progress and works are currently in progress. To date, the third 
component (Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene education and Institutional 
Strengthening of SENASA) has provided access to safe water and sanitation services to some 
17,500 people, of whom 6,200 are indigenous peoples who received access to improved 
sanitation services (latrines). 

20. 
Increase access to basic health services of good quality. Through the Paraguay Health 
Sector Medium and Long-Term Vision study (P111929), the Bank, in partnership with the 
Ministry of Health and in coordination with other development agencies, prepared a policy 
framework to discuss measures to increase access to basic health services among the poor while 
simultaneously reducing their out-of-pocket expenditure on medication. The analysis was timely 
and of good quality and helped shape government’s policy decisions, including the elimination 
of user fees. However, its impact was limited because of low demand from the client during the 
changes in government. 

Pillar 3. Economic Growth with Inclusion: Fostering growth with a focus on employment 
generation and on improving income distribution, without destabilizing the country’s 
macroeconomic framework, and in an environmentally friendly manner 

21. 
Under pillar 3 the Bank’s partnership focused on designing ways to: (a) appropriately 
respond to the global financial crisis, while safeguarding macroeconomic and financial stability; 
(b) moving toward a more sustainable pattern of growth, based on greater diversification of 
products and external markets; (c) supporting investments in infrastructure and human capital, as 
well as improving the investment and business climate; (d) finding new sources of growth and 
improving the economy’s overall competitiveness; and (e) safeguarding the environment. 

22. 
Responding to the global financial crisis and safeguarding financial stability. The 
Bank’s engagement, articulated through a Public Sector Reform DPL (P113457) and 
complementary knowledge services, concentrated on building the institutions and conditions 
through which the country could absorb possible future shocks. These initiatives have helped 
improve the tax/GDP ratio, 39 fostered adoption of an anti-crisis counter-cyclical stabilization 
fund, and introduced a more effective tax policy aimed at large taxpayers. The complementary 
technical assistance completed various crisis simulation exercises, which helped to test 
government tools and procedures to manage financial distress and possible systematic crisis. IFC 
served its counter-cyclical role during the financial crisis, creating an Asset Management 
Company (AMC) to mobilize third-party and IFC contributions to capitalize banks worldwide. In 
2009, AMC provided the first of such funds in Paraguay by investing during the crisis much-
needed equity ($20 million) in Banco Continental (Paraguay's second largest bank). 

22. 
Financial inclusion has been an area of WBG support, and the build-up of IFC’s 
investment portfolio with the country’s main financial institutions is bearing fruit. As of end-
2012, IFC’s financial markets clients had approximately 20,000 SME loans outstanding for $1.6 

39 The tax/GDP ratio reached 11.5 percent in 2013, against a target of 13.0 percent. 

48 

 
 
  
 
 
 
                                                           
billion, making 2012 the third straight year during which Paraguay’s average SME loan size 
ranked in the top two among LAC lower-middle-income economies. In addition, IFC clients 
supported 30,226 microenterprise loans outstanding for approximately $36 million (~$1,200/loan 
average). Overall, these investments have reached close to 33,000 farmers and have generated 
about $3 million in tax revenue for the GoP. In addition, IBRD has delivered on knowledge 
services to analyze the possibility of developing a mobile phone-based payment system for the 
rural poor (P144971).  

23. 
Public spending targeting. The internal financial control components within both DPLs 
focused on taking advantage of fiscal headway and utilizing it for targeted social spending. 
Economic and sector work (ESW) initiatives such as the PY Public Expenditure Review 
(P127351) identified the limitations of fiscal policy and the tax system on inclusive economic 
growth; it also presented policy options, but its impact was limited because of the change in 
government. Nonetheless, following this Bank support, the share of social programs in the 
overall budget expenditures increased during the crisis, while coverage of social protection 
programs increased more than six-fold; thus there was a partial achievement of the indicators for 
investment to GDP ratio (3 percent in 2013, against a target of 3.5 percent). 

24. 
Infrastructure investment and diversification. To diversify and provide an improved 
business climate, the CPS focused on investment and maintenance of infrastructure for the 
national energy system and the road network. The Paraguay Energy Sector Strengthening Project 
(P114971) focuses on modernizing the energy agency (ANDE) and installing an advanced 
metering system for high energy consuming customers, with the objective of improving service 
quality by reducing power outages. The project experienced implementation delays but began to 
advance  in February 2014 after the mid-term review. The construction and maintenance of road 
infrastructure was addressed through the Road Maintenance Project (P082026), which helped 
pave 1,210 km of roads and introduced performance-based contracting for road maintenance 
through the “Gestión y Mantenimiento de Carreteras por Niveles de Servicios” (GMANS) 
system. Regarding the complementary knowledge services, the PY Transport Sector Assessment 
(P106825) has provided a detailed diagnosis of road infrastructure quality and the Transport 
Sector Assessment TA (P106825) provided an analysis of the country’s aerial, water, and 
terrestrial transport systems and government expenditures on these items. Improvements in river 
navigation were approached through technical assistance through the Support for the Design of 
River Navigation Concessions-Phase II (P122325), which evaluated the likely benefits of 
investing in river navigation; and the PY Infrastructure and Logistic (P129630) created an expert 
workshop to analyze the required infrastructure logistics to dredge the Paraguay River. Although 
there has been substantial progress in both investment operations and various knowledge services 
were delivered, the expected outcomes were not achieved due to the initial delays. IFC has had a 
strong engagement in the sector, providing financing to increase the availability and efficiency of 
barges in the hidrovia; IFC’s support to barge transport operators in the hidrovia covers about 30 
percent of the country’s transport of soy production and 40 percent of fuel transport. 

25. 
Growth and competitiveness. The Bank delivered a number of knowledge products, such 
as the Inclusive Competitiveness Study - Phase 1 (P126568), the Implications of Trade 
Liberalization (P119925) and the 2013 Public Sector Effectiveness study (P120699). The 
Inclusive Competitiveness Study found great potential in public-private partnerships (PPPs) and 

49 

 
 
 
 
contributed to the adoption of the PPP law. The trade liberalization study examined the literature 
on what represents a perfect customs union and presented a set of recommendations on how to 
use tariff revenue between countries, following the example of the EU and the Southern African 
Customs Union. IFC has also supported the increase in trade transactions through its global 
guarantee program. IFC’s trade finance program with five Paraguayan banking institutions worth 
$110 million has guaranteed over $450 million in trade flows, primarily related to fertilizers, 
agri-machinery, agri-commodities, leather, and meat; this effort introduced Paraguayan local 
banks to global IFC client banks with which they had no previous relationship. IFC guarantees 
provided comfort to these global banks to undertake and increase transactions against a 
background of political risk in Paraguay. In 2013, IFC provided seed capital in a project to 
explore for oil and gas in the Chaco region, the success of which would be a game-changer for 
the country, potentially allowing the country to achieve fuel self-sufficiency. In 2012, IFC used 
trust funds to support the PPP program to analyze the potential concession of the country’s main 
airport in Paraguay. In 2010, IFC also used Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility 
(PPIAF) funds to diagnose the financial situation of the Municipality of Asunción and provided 
recommendations to improve financial management.  

26. 
Safeguarding the environment. As part of the search for new paths toward growth and 
poverty reduction, the CPS focused on natural resources management in rural areas. This 
involved work on reducing unsustainable forest management practices and strengthening the 
institutions in charge of environmental management through the GEF-financed Project 
Conservation of Biodiversity and Sustainable Land Management in the Atlantic Forest of Eastern 
Paraguay (P094335). This project got off to a slow start because of overly complicated 
institutional arrangements coupled with frequent staff turnover in the project implementation unit 
(PIU). 

III. WBG PERFORMANCE 
27. 
The Bank’s performance is rated as fair albeit noting IFC’s successful and sizable 
program expansion. Although the Bank’s engagement was aligned with the country’s 
development objectives and correctly addressed some of the portfolio’s fiduciary issues, it lost 
the opportunity to address the numerous issues that were identified during the time of the CPS 
Progress Report. The Bank team should have followed up on various activities more closely (for 
example, when restructuring operations); it also should have increased its presence in the country 
office in order to resolve the basic implementation and administrative issues that arose during the 
CPS. Knowing that effectiveness delays were a problem in the country, it should have engaged 
the Legislative Branch in a dialogue on the important development outcomes of new investment.  

Design and Relevance  

28. 
The CPS was relevant for the country and was aligned to the development goals and the 
Government's agenda and priorities. The CPS was envisaged to be flexible and responsive to 
Government requests. However, the political changes and turnover of officials made it difficult 
for the Bank to carry on the dialogue in the context of shifting priorities and demands by the 
different governments.  

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
29. 
The CPS was designed to provide a total of $364 million in new operations; it originally 
envisioned seven lending operations (three DPLs and four investment loans in land access, 
education, safety nets operation, and electricity). The original CPS period, 2009-mid-2013 was 
extended until December 31, 2013 to align the next strategy with the new Government’s term. 
Although this strategy was not developed jointly with IFC (as previously explained), since 2009 
it has incorporated a vast array of new IFC operations, which were reflected in the Progress 
Report and are included in the Results Framework (see Annex 1).  

A.  Program Implementation and Portfolio Performance 

30. 
The portfolio experienced a series of challenges that ultimately shaped its performance 
(see Table 2). The challenges that defined its pace of implementation and disbursements were:  
(a) complex project designs; (b) delays in effectiveness; (c) the complex government annual 
budget cycle; (d) limited technical, fiduciary, and safeguards capacity; (e) lack of coordination 
among co-executors of different components of projects; (f) frequent staff turnover in some 
project implementation units, consequent upon political changes; (g) a limited use of South-
South experiences; and (h) limited resources for supervising investment projects. These 
ultimately contributed to the performance rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.  

31. 
The Paraguay portfolio was adversely affected by political turmoil during the 
impeachment of President Fernando Lugo in 2012, which resulted in three presidential regimes 
during the CPS period: Mr. Fernando Lugo, followed by Mr. Federico Franco, who was 
succeeded by Mr. Horacio Cartes in August 2013. The Bank conducted an ongoing assessment 
of the situation and during this period implementation of the portfolio proceeded normally. 
However, it faced the challenge of working with a new administration (and in some cases with 
new PIU staff), which ultimately led to significant implementation delays. No new lending and 
technical assistance were approved during this period (June 2012–April 2013). The selected 
instruments were two DPLs focused on public sector reforms, each for $100 million 40, and two 
investment loans, one to modernize the country’s energy sector ($100 million) and the other to 
modernize its water/sanitation sector ($64 million).  

32. 
The active portfolio carries ongoing projects from previous strategies. The PY Road 
Maintenance Project (P082026) disbursed 65.04 percent of its funds and the Sustainable 
Agriculture and Rural Development Project (P088799) disbursed 70.28 percent. 41 The active 
portfolio’s disbursement rate has shown improvements from the first quarter of FY14; the rate is 
currently 21.8 percent for FY14, 42 which shows an improvement in disbursement indicators for 
the entire portfolio when compared to previous years (not including DPL disbursements). 

33. 
Given its focus on the private sector as its inherent preferred creditor status, IFC’s 
operations continued to grow during the political turmoil. This provided confidence in the private 
sector, strengthening IFC’s status as a financier of preference. IFC has the largest disbursed and 

40 The CPS envisioned three DPLs, the final two were merged into a single $100 million public sector strengthening 
project versus two $50 million projects to take advantage of the Legislative Branch approval windows.

34. 
Knowledge services were focused on strategic sector reforms linked to poverty reduction, 
inclusion, and governance. The Bank’s engagement delivered 31 products: 13 ESW and 18 TA; 
these were focused on various themes, with public sector governance the leading one, followed 
by financial and private sector strengthening, and economic policy. However, even with the 
Bank’s efforts to disseminate these works, AAA delivery encountered challenges within the CPS 
period. The main issue was the shifting political landscape, resulting in changing counterparts 
within Government agencies and their priorities.  

35. 
Paraguay lags well behind its regional counterparts on the amount of South-South 
knowledge exchanges that it has completed. Only eight South-South knowledge exchanges were 
prepared in the time frame of strategy. 

36. 
Aiming at presenting issues and options for the in-coming government, the Bank 
prepared and presented a set of Policy Notes in September 2013. The Notes were prepared for 
sectors in which there were successful past engagements and where the Bank has a comparative 
advantage. 

37. 
Trust funds have been used selectively in the Bank program to support key institutional 
reforms and project implementation. Of the 19 ($7.6million) trust funds approved during the 
CPS period, 11 were administered by the WBG, the rest by the recipient. These supported 
activities related to strengthening national budgetary oversight, public sector reform and 
governance, indigenous land regulation, natural resources management (GEF), and the national 
statistics office. Trust fund performance was poor; the underlying causes were the same as those 
encountered for lending operations. Effectiveness delays were also common, as a consequence of 
the need for the Legislative Branch approval for recipient-executed trust funds. 

52 

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Management of Risks  

38. 
Political risks identified at the beginning of the partnership had a strong effect on the 
effectiveness of the Bank’s engagement. The Bank’s strategies to ameliorate these risks 
consisted of: (a) support to the MoH to improve its communication strategy for building 
consensus and obtaining approval in the Legislative Branch; and (b) AAA to support ministries 
to better inform stakeholders of their investment programs and the results and impact of the 
reforms. 

39. Macroeconomic volatility had a strong effect on overall partnership effectiveness. 
Paraguay is exposed to fluctuations in international demand and prices for commodities through 
its strong dependence on agriculture exports. Within the CPS period, the country experienced an 
unstable environment for its agriculture exports: first a strong deterioration of world demand, 
which gave way to a -4 percent growth rate in 2009, followed by an 13.1 percent growth rate in 
2010, and finally sluggish growth toward the end of the CPS period (the average growth rate 
during the CPS timeframe was 4.49 percent). As an amelioration strategy, the Bank produced 
and delivered the PY Volatility Analysis (P143809), which presented a set of policy options to 
mitigate the impact of volatility on the poor and to improve the country’s resilience to 
macroeconomic shocks. 

40. 
Limited institutional capacity has caused delays in the Bank portfolio. Progress in the 
Bank program was affected by weak human resource capacity in the public sector, as well as 
limited inter-institutional cooperation. The Bank and the Government monitored the program 
through annual Country Performance Portfolio Reviews (CPPRs) and action plans to address the 
problems identified, but overall problems still remain, even though there has been a significant 
improvement in disbursements since the second quarter of FY14. 

41. 
Social tensions regarding land tenure escalated; social risks were assessed as high. The 
CPS identified the pressures from social demands as a risk to deliver quickly on its program. The 
political transition generated high expectations, particularly among the rural poor and indigenous 
peoples, for urgent social needs and land tenure reform, which were not met due to political 
bottlenecks and a lack of consensus on an agenda. The Bank assisted in the mitigation of this risk 
by aiming to improve social safety net targeting and land use targeting. 

42. 
The fiduciary risk was high in the CPS period. The Government made strong efforts to 
address weaknesses in its control system identified in the CPS; despite these efforts, the lack of 
accountability, inadequate human resources policies, and cumbersome procedures and work 
practices impeded the effectiveness of the strategy. The Bank will continue providing close 
supervision to the program and related technical assistance in future engagements.  

43. 
Environmental and social risks have materialized in some projects. Implementation of 
infrastructure projects has raised some concerns at the community level or with indigenous 
people. The Government made efforts to address them. However, the lack of capacity combined 
with the complex design of safeguards instruments have led to implementation delays. The Bank 
has provided technical assistance and has deployed expert personnel to address specific issues 
with a more intensive supervision scheme. 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Given the experience of the implementation of this CPS, it is recommended: 

IV. 
44. 

(a) 

To pay closer attention to the preparation stage of projects and to allocate additional 
resources to this phase of the cycle.  
i. This could include the support to technical preparation of social and 
environmental management, where the existing instruments have shown to 
be complex and sometimes cumbersome to the existing capacity in the 
country.  
ii. Projects should be designed assuming long effectiveness delays. The 
project’s life span should be expanded taking into account an 18-24 month 
delay in effectiveness. During this period, teams should advance on the 
preparation of procurement documents in order to quickly advance when 
legally able.  
Following the experience that led to an increase in the overall FY14 disbursement 
ratio to 21 percent, it is recommended that disbursement profiles be designed to start 
disbursements at a later stage of the project. 
To strengthen the management capacity of the implementation teams in Paraguay in 
order to improve the execution and disbursement of the portfolio, through increased 
BB resources for supervising projects and enhanced efforts of supervision (e.g., 
monthly CMU-TTLs meetings to follow upon portfolio performance). 
To maintain the capacity-building efforts such as the ones initiated during the second 
part of the CPS period, concentrating on fiduciary and safeguards topics. To continue 
the monthly capacity-building activities with PIUs and all relevant technical staff 
based on their demand and with workshops for all PIUs as needed. To continue 
capacity-building efforts aimed at strengthening country systems to be able to support 
WBG investment lending operations in the future CPS.  
To promote the use of simple designs, avoiding schemes with several executors and 
unnecessary project complexities; this should help reduce coordination demands.  
To develop a broader dialogue with The Legislative Branch in order to address 
project approval (such as the case of PRODERS); and the preparation of the new 
strategy.  
To establish a smooth channel of communication with the main IBRD counterparts, 
the MoH and the STP.  
To jointly prepare the next CPS in coordination with IFC. 
To explore the use of different WBG instruments and services (DPLs, IPFs, TFs, 
Reimbursable Advisory Services, TA, ESW) and their complementarity in key areas 
on which the Bank and the Government agree. It is also recommended to increase the 
association between knowledge and lending services. 
To increase the amount of South-South knowledge exchanges.  
To involve the national indigenous peoples institutions as part of project governance 
or advisory structures in order to win their support when dealing with eventual claims 
or conflicts.  
To simplify the CPS and Results Matrix design. Given the envelope and the size of 
the portfolio, it would be good to include up to 10 outcomes. It is also important to

present relevant and measurable indicators for all outcomes in order to correctly 
reflect the portfolio performance. 

45. 
In order to prevent knowledge services from failing to influence decision making and 
policy design, the Bank must monitor AAA more closely. Within the next CPS the WBG must 
pursue a joint analytical and advisory program given the big demand for such services, which 
should be complemented by RASs and just-in-time policy notes on specific topics following the 
pattern adopted by many MICs. 

46. 
The Bank can strengthen its collaboration with groups outside of the Government. As the 
World Bank Paraguay Country Survey FY13 shows, while perceptions of the way the Bank 
collaborates with the Government are relatively positive, there is room to improve the Bank’s 
relationships with NGOs and groups outside the Government.

of intensive support is required for Financial Management. They 
also receive appropriate fiduciary management of public 
investments. In both cases, contract implementation is underway 
after strong delays.  
Under component 3 of the project, the engagement has enabled 
access tosafe water and sanitation services to around 17,500 
people, of whom 6,200 are indigenous peoples who received 
access to sanitation services.

the determinants of poverty, analyzed trends in the urban labor 
market, and analyzed the possible poverty impacts of a 
(simulated) expansion in monetary transfer programs (both 
CCTs and the new non-contributory pension law). 

The Equity Assessment in Paraguay aimed to contribute to an 
understanding of the patterns behind the weak linkages between 
poverty reduction and economic growth, and thus the limited 
capacity of the economy to create a strong middle class, under 
the hypothesis that equity-enhancing policies should be 
conceptualized within a broader discussion regarding the pattern

and sustainable agriculture. Initial delay because of the 
finalization of the legal documentation. 
Achieved 

Completion of the Carbon Finance Assist Country Work 
Program. Two workshops and five technical studies were 
successfully carried out to assess the low carbon potential in 
relevant productive sectors. 

Partially Achieved  
Following a very slow project implementation startup, an 
extension of the closing date was granted in March 2014. The 
current closing date is April 10, 2016. 
As of May, 2014, the first project’s activities were already 
showing firm outputs in line with the expected results. Project 
implementation has been improved by a more strengthened 
Project Implementation Unit and by an active coordination with 
Secretary for the Environment ( Secretaría del Ambiente 
SEAM). However, the project has not yet made an impact at the 
outcomes level. The project will be restructured to adjust its 
results framework in order to deliver the project PDO in the new 
timeframe. The dialogue with representatives from indigenous 
communities in the project target area has continued and there 
are ongoing discussions related to their participation in the 
project in the context of the project’s Indigenous People 
Strategy. The Instituto Nacional de Asuntos Indígenas (INDI) 
has approached the project to request participation and to offer 
support. 
Partially Achieved 
The PIU has conducted a key training activity on forestry 
management issues led by the Centro Agronómico Tropical de 
Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE) from Costa Rica. This has 
involved more than 100 participants from Itaipú, SEAM, and 
other stakeholders in the project area of influence, as well as 
experts from PRODERS.  
No Achieved 
No activities have been undertaken.

In projects that might affect 
indigenous peoples, it is advisable to 
involve the National Indigenous 
Peoples institutions as part of the 
project’s governance or advisory 
structures in order to win their 
support when dealing with eventual 
claims or conflicts. However, their 
involvement may require some level 
of strengthening both in terms or 
provision of resources and capacity 
building. 
Although implementation of projects 
with bi-national entities might not 
require going through usual formal 
procedures before effectiveness (e.g., 
The Legislative Branch approval), it 
is advisable to promote the use of 
simple designs, avoiding schemes 
with several executors and 
unnecessary formal complexities; this 
will help to reduce coordination 
demands. 
The use of bi-national entities as 
executants may help to ensure a 
smooth availability of co-funding and 
counterpart human resources, which 
are of great value for project 
execution. 
The lack of long-term policies,

grounded on wide political 
consensus, combined with some 
degree of political instability can 
severely delay project 
implementation. 
Actions aimed at strengthening 
institutional capacities may prove 
pointless when the intended 
beneficiaries do not have clear and 
pre-defined priorities, or lack certain 
“basic needs.” In these cases, extra 
and sustained hand-holding may be 
needed, as well as great flexibility to 
adapt to changing, short-term 
requirements.

Annex 3. Monitoring and Evaluation of the CPS FY15-18 Results Framework  

Results Area 1 - Strengthening Resilience to Risks and Volatility 

Result 1.1: Enhanced agricultural risk management 

WBG Result Indicators: 

(i) Agricultural insurance penetration rate increased by 15 percent by 2018 (2013 Baseline 0.39 
percent). 

Agricultural insurance is typically one of many tools that farmers can use as part of their 
comprehensive strategy for managing agricultural production risks. It is measured by the ratio 
between agricultural insurance premiums and the agricultural GDP for the same year. Baseline 
and target data sources for the agricultural insurance premiums and for the agricultural GDP are 
reports from the CBP. 45  For comparison purposes, the EU insurance penetration rate is around 1 
percent. 

Result 1.2: Improved Financial Inclusion 

WBG Result Indicators: 

(i) 50 percent of adults with savings accounts by 2018 (2013 baseline: 29 percent). 

One of the indicators for the National Financial Inclusion Strategy is to increase the number of 
adults with savings accounts in Paraguay from 29 percent in 2013 to 50 percent in 2018. 
Paraguay conducted a Financial Inclusion Survey (FINDEX) in 2013 which provided the 
baseline result of 29 percent. In the same year, the LAC regional average of adults who have a 
savings account was 39 percent. Thus, Paraguay has aimed to increase the number of adults who 
have savings accounts through a number of supporting policy actions identified in the National 
Strategy. As part of the National Strategy Plan, the GoP will launch a new survey to track down 
progress, and will be carried out by 2017 in order to demonstrate the survey results by 2018.  

(ii) 163,000 individuals and microenterprises accessed to microfinance client services by 2018 
(2012 baseline: 125,000). 

The 163,000 figure represents just the additional reach IFC's clients expect to achieve in total in 
Paraguay in the outlook period over the baseline/actual amount of 125,000 in 2012. In terms of 
measurement, the figure represents the number of loans outstanding below $10,000 to 
individuals and microenterprises. 

45 Both reports are annually published at http://www.bcp.org.py (see: Estadisticas del Sector Asegurador (Insurance 
Sector Statistics) and Anexo Estadístico del Informe Económico (Statistical Annex to the Economic Report).

(iii) 7 percent of farmers with improved access to markets and access to enhanced productivity 
and financial services by 2018 (2013 baseline: 5 percent). 

This figure represents the number of farmers serviced by IFC clients, and these farmers are 
expected to benefit from (i) improved access to markets, inputs and services; (ii) improved 
functioning of markets and services; (iii) improved financial outcomes; or (iv) training on 
practices to improve productivity or promote sustainability” of their farming activities. As of 
December 2013, 33,000 farmers have been reached (out of a total of 638.590 46). The target for 
the CPS period is 45,000 farmers. Source: IFC Development Impact Department. 

Result 1.3: Improved environmental management 

WBG Result Indicator: 

(i) Improved forest management and conservation practices introduced on an area equivalent to 
18 percent of the current Alto Paraná’s Atlantic Forest area 47 by 2018 (2014 Baseline: 9 
percent). 

Despite its ecological importance, Paraguay suffers from severe environmental degradation. In 
particular, Paraguay’s deforestation rate was until recently one of the highest in Latin America. 
Deforestation has greatly reduced both the extent and continuity of Paraguay’s remaining forest 
cover. This deforestation, combined with further unsustainable land management practices 
including slash-and-burn agriculture, extensive grazing and the practice of mono-cultivation of 
cotton, and more recently soybeans and sugarcane, are also leading to soil erosion, loss of soil 
fertility and decreased quantity and quality of water resources,—constraining the livelihoods and 
productivity of farmers within the region. Additionally, erosion and siltation is affecting the 
operation of the country’s main source of public revenue, the Itaipú hydroelectrical dam.  

By 2018 it is expected that protected areas included in the project will be strengthened based on 
the use of the GEF Strategic Priority#1 tracking tool 48. The target of 310,799 ha includes: (i) the 
area where subprojects are expected to be implemented (2018 target: 120,000 ha – 2014 
baseline: 0); plus (ii) the area where private reserves are expected to be implemented and/or 
created (2018 target: 124,374 ha – 2014 baseline: 107,734 ha considering the area of the existing 
private reserves (Natural Reserve Mbaracayu Forest, Morombi natural reserve,  Ypeti natural 
reserve and Tapyta natural reserve); plus (iii) the public protected areas where the system is 
expected to be strengthened (2018 target: 66,425 ha – 2014 baseline 58,000 ha including 
Caazapá national park, Ñacunday national park and 6 reserves belonging to Itaipú). Progress 

46 Total number of farmers according to the 2013 National Household Survey. 
47 Total current area of Alto Parana’s Atlantic Forest is 1,7002,000 hectares. Source: WWF, 2014 (Available at 
http://www.wwf.org.py/que_hacemos/bosque_atlantico/. 
48 A World Bank/WWF Alliance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use (‘the Alliance’) was formed in April 
1998, in response to the continued depletion of the world’s forest biodiversity and of forest-based goods and 
services essential for sustainable development. As part of its program of work the Alliance set a target of 50 million 
hectares of existing but highly threatened forest protected areas to be secured under effective management by the 
year 2005.To evaluate progress towards this target the Alliance has developed a simple site-level tracking tool to 
facilitate reporting on management effectiveness of protected areas within WWF and World Bank projects.

towards the achievement of this indicator will be informed by Project Management Unit through 
its semi-annual reports with data collected a monitoring and evaluation system. 2018 information 
will also be provided by the Project Management Unit. 

Results Area 2: Boosting Pro-Poor Delivery of Public Goods and Services 

Result 2.1: Increased Revenues and Progressivity of Fiscal Management 

WBG Result Indicators:  

(i) Total tax/GDP ratio increased from 11.5 percent (2013) to 14 percent (2018) and the 
progressivity of the tax system improved compared to the base year 2013.  

Baseline data source on total tax/GDP ratio is the Ministry of Hacienda (MoH) with data 
collected by the Tax Administration Office (SET), and 2018 information will also be provided 
by MoH. Improvement in progressivity will be evidenced by estimating the share of tax 
collection via progressive taxes to total tax revenue in the base year and comparing the same 
estimation for 2018. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) carried out by the Bank in 2013 
includes an analysis of taxes by income deciles and this will be used to inform the baseline 
values. During the implementation of the CPS, the Bank will carry out an update of this 
document using the same methodology in order to generate the corresponding numbers in 2018. 

(ii) Progressivity of expenditures in social and infrastructure service delivery improved by 2018  

The PER mentioned above also has a chapter focused on the role of fiscal policy on poverty 
reduction where progressivity of public expenditures is evaluated. This document includes, inter 
alia, a review of the expenditures on health and education per quintile that will serve as a 
baseline for 2013. During the implementation of the CPS, the Bank will carry out an update of 
this document using the same methodology in order to generate the corresponding numbers in 
2018. 

Result 2.2: Improved Access to Quality Public Services for the Rural Poor 

WBG Result Indicators:  

(i) 10 percent of urban extreme poor in Asunción metropolitan area benefiting from improved 
environmental sanitation services by 2018 (2014 Baseline: 0). 

Definition of access to improved environmental sanitation services: environmental sanitation 
refers to access to an enhanced water and sanitation services including network sewerage 
connection ensuring hygienic excreta and sullage disposal and a clean and healthy living 
environment both at home and in the neighborhood of users. Coverage is the proportion of 
people using improved environmental sanitation facilities: 57 Km of a rehabilitated secondary 
distribution water network, 8.4 km of a new sanitation network and 33 Km of new primary 
sanitation collectors in the watershed of Itay. Baseline and target data will be produced by 
ESSAP monitoring framework for key management and service delivery indicators. 

75 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) Indigenous peoples with access to sustainable water increased from 2.5 percent (2013) to 6.5 
percent (2018).  

A rural water system is considered to be sustainable when: (a) the system is designed to ensure 
long-term supply (designed appropriately for yield of source), (b) it is functioning as intended 
and delivers the service either continuously or regularly, depending on the service level selected; 
(c) a long term institutional, social, technical and financial mechanism is in place that guarantees 
operation and maintenance of the system: and (d) the water committee has an incentive to carry 
out its tasks and meet on a regular basis.  

Access to a sustainable water is also defined as access to safe drinking water, which means that 
the source is less than 1 kilometer away from its place of use and that it is possible to reliably 
obtain at least 20 liters per member of a household per day; sustainable water is water with 
microbial, chemical, and physical characteristics that meet WHO guidelines or national standards 
on drinking water quality. Access to sustainable or safe drinking water is the proportion of 
people using improved drinking water sources: household connection; public standpipe; 
borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; or rainwater. Baseline data source is a Country 
Technical Note on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues for Paraguay prepared by the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development - IFAD 49. 2018 target data will be produced by ESSAP monitoring 
framework for key management and service delivery indicators. 

Result 2.3: Improved Social Accountability and Transparency 

WBG Result Indicators: 

(i) Open Information Law 50 fully implemented by least 20 percent of government agencies by 
2018 (2014 baseline: 9 percent). 

The measures supported in this area are expected to improve transparency and accountability of 
the GoP’s public financial management systems, which will contribute towards a more efficient 
delivery of public services as well as increased participation of civil society actors in the fight 
against corruption. This indicator will be considered achieved if information on budget execution 
and civil service salaries is available and updated for at least 70 government agencies (out of 
394) at the MoH portal by 2018 (baseline: ‘No’ in 2013; target: ‘Yes’ in 2018). 

(ii) At least 10 new education sector information tools and 15 datasets available for internal 
management and public access by 2018 (2014 baseline: 0) 

Information Tools will be information and communication technological tools that will help the 
Ministry of Education to better understand and analyze data. These would mainly include 
visualizations of key education data sets and could also comprise the design and development of 

49 The complete report is available at: 
http://www.ifad.org/english/indigenous/pub/documents/tnotes/paraguay_en.pdf  
50 The Open Information Law (Ley 5189/2014) makes mandatory the publication of salaries and allowances 
received by the civil service.

applications for the manipulation of these data. The target for the new information tools would 
be 10  (3 in year one; 3 in year 2; and 4 in year 3) and while during year one the main focus of 
these tools will be on teacher data, the focus for tools to be developed during subsequent years 
will be determined later. Data sets would be new data or new aggregations of existing data. 
Target for new data sets would be 15 additional data sets over the three years (5 each year). 
Datasets for year one will make information available to the public on, inter alia¸ FONACIDE 
and schools eligible for FONACIDE resources, school matriculation, and school infrastructure 
data. Sources of data for both target values will be annual reports from the Ministry of 
Education. 

(iii) At least two social accountability mechanisms under the Open Government initiative 
successfully implemented by independent CSOs by 2018 (2014 baseline: 0).  

The GoP has requested support from the Global Partnerships for Social Accountability to 
develop a model for a civil-society government partnership for a more transparent and 
accountable implementation of the Tekoporã Program. Thereafter, through a competitive 
process, a grant has been provided to a coalition of civil society organizations which will create 
an enabling environment in which citizen feedback is used to solve fundamental problems in 
service delivery and to strengthen the performance public institutions. The program includes 
activities towards strengthening the Beneficiaries’ Voice and Civil Society Oversight by raising 
awareness of the benefits of the Tekoporã Program, improving the quality, effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Tekoporã program using social accountability and gathering information tools, 
and managing knowledge for program 
transparency, 
improvement, sustainability and 
management. The indicator is then to successfully implement this initiative by the end of 2018. 
Additionally, a social accountability mechanism is expected to be successfully implemented as 
part of at least one IBRD Investment Project Financing operation under the current active 
portfolio.   

Results Area 3: Fostering Market Integration 

Result 3.1: Improved Agricultural Productivity and Access to Markets for Small-holder farmers 

WBG Result Indicators:  

(i) Income of 15 percent of poor households (out of 130,000) in Concepción, San Pedro, 
Canindeyú, Caaguazú and Caazapá increased by 30 percent by 2018. (2013 Baseline: G4 
million/year). 

Farmers’ net income with and without the project estimated through annual socio-economic 
surveys for beneficiary farmers and control group (2013 Baseline annual income is G4 
million).  Net incremental income per farmer could vary from 24 percent to over 100 percent 
depending on the farmers’ initial conditions, the cropping pattern and the farmers’ own 
dynamics. Data sources are reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) with 
data collected under yearly socio economic surveys carried out by PRODERS M&E team. 2018 
information will also be provided by MAG. 

77 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Background info: The number of 25,500 comes out from the target of the original loan (50 
pecent of 9,150 families) and the target of the Additional Financing (70 percent of 29,850 
families).The baseline is 4,600 since is the number of families already benefited by the project. 
The difference (20,900 farmers and their families), represent approximately 15 percent of the 
total poor households in the five Departments mentioned in the indicator (132,000 –this has been 
calculated dividing the total number of poor in those departments by 4.5 –which is the average 
size of a rural household). 

(ii)  130 additional indigenous communities’ (representing more than 50 percent of Indigenous 
Peoples 
in Paraguay) economic development 
improved 
through enhancement of 
organizational capacity and better-quality living conditions by 2018 (2014 Baseline: 45 
communities). 

The 130 indigenous communities are considered high priority due to the high incidence of 
poverty and the degree to which the natural resources on which they depend for survival are 
degraded. Enhanced living conditions include a strengthened community organization 51, skills 
for self-governance, and better access to markets and value chains for their products. Access of 
each indigenous community to this line of support under PRODERS has been decided based on 
the Indigenous Peoples Land Access and Natural Resources Use Index 52 designed by the project 
and prepared with the communities and their associations. The Indigenous Communities’ 
Development Plans are monitored and evaluated annually by means of a participatory process by 
project beneficiaries and technicians who submit reports on subprojects implementation to the 
PMU.  Baseline data sources are reports from the MAG with data collected under yearly socio 
economic surveys carried out by the PMU Monitoring and Evaluation team. 2018 information 
will also be provided by MAG based on the aforementioned reports and on an independent 
evaluation of activities with indigenous communities that will be carried out as part of the project 
mid-term and final evaluations.  

Result 3.2: Increased private investments in logistics projects/initiatives and reduced logistics 
costs 

WBG Result Indicators:  

(i) At least two public private partnership transactions in transport/logistics by 2018 (2014 
baseline: 0). 

The National Development Plan (NDP) gives a special role to funding infrastructure investments 
through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). The WBG will monitor these transactions during the 
implementation of the CPS. Target for this indicator will be reached when at least two public 
private partnership transactions have been successfully processed under the new PPP law. 

51 This means the creation or strengthening of Community Development Groups, Micro-Catchment Development 
Committees, Municipal Steering Committees, and/or Indigenous Associations. For More information, please see the 
Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project Appraisal Document (Report  
52 The Index measures: (ii) communities’ knowledge about the location of their lands, their confirmed delimitation 
and legal status (including the availability of land titles), and the level of utilization of lands that are under the 
communities’ name; and (ii) the existence of conflicts on the use of the lands in terms of physical occupation, and 
the existence of problems with regards to litigation and other types of claims.

(ii) Travel time on two 200km segments of roads in selected priority Departments (San Pedro, 
Caaguazú and Caazapá, or similar) reduced by at least 30 minutes by 2018 (Baseline 2014: 
average travel time for a 200km segment of a national road 3hrs and 20 minutes; target: 
average travel time for a 200km segment of a national road 2hrs and 50 minutes).  

The transport sector is an integral part of Paraguay’s economic ecosystem given the country’s 
landlocked condition, and its status as a major producer and exporter. National, departmental and 
tertiary road networks need priority attention in order to improve connectivity of rural 
populations and production to the main consumption centers and export nodes. Travel time is 
defined as the travel time based on average travel speeds for two targeted segments of 200km of 
national roads in two Departments with high level of poor population to be determined. Baseline 
data sources are reports from the MOPC. 2018 information will also be provided by the MOPC.

The EU is presently finalizing its Multi-Annual Indicative Program for the period 2014-2020, 
which is expected to be adopted in the second half of 2014. The strategic objectives are to 
contribute to Paraguay’s social, economic and institutional development, to promote regional 
integration on the South American continent and to develop partnerships for bilateral and global 
issues of common interest. The financial and technical cooperation instruments (grants) will be 
used for: 
• Human capital development, improving productivity of the labor force and reducing 
inequality and poverty. The focus will be on improving access to, and quality of, 
education; 
Improving the business climate, conducive to trade and investments, strengthening of the 
policy-making and implementation capacities of institutions in this field, improving the 
participation of private-sector entities in policy design, and reducing the administrative 
burden for businesses; 
• A stable and socially inclusive Paraguay. The support in this field will concentrate on the 
design and implementation of policies that promote a more equal wealth distribution, 
increase social cohesion and reduce poverty; 
• Strengthening of democratic institutions in Paraguay, among others by implementing the 
recommendations of the 2013 EU’s Election Observation Mission. 
In the area of development cooperation, the EU and its Member States 53 have agreed to start a 
joint programming process, including a joint analysis and response to coordinate their 
programming exercises, covering the 2014-2020 period.

Annex 5. Gender Analysis 

1. 
Paraguay has made progress over the last decade in promoting women’s 
empowerment and gender equality. However, there are still challenges to be addressed in 
order to reduce the gender gap in several dimensions. In preparation of the CPS, the WBG 
Gender Team conducted a review of gender coverage in the portfolio, followed by one-on-one 
interviews with Task Team Leaders to analyze how gender is incorporated in the Bank’s 
program in Paraguay.  
2. 
Legal and institutional framework: Paraguay has ratified major International 
Human Rights Instruments on the rights on women 54 to establish the basis of a legal 
framework aiming to protect and promote women’s rights and gender equality in 
Paraguay. This includes  the American Convention of Human Rights, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and the Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence 
against Women (Belém do Pará). Over the last decade, laws have been amended and new laws 
have been implemented by the Paraguayan government in order to promote women’s 
empowerment and gender equality in the country. 55 The National Constitution of 1992 ensures 
equal rights for all. Specifically, the Constitution establishes equal rights among people (Article 
46), equal rights between women and men (Article 48), and non- discrimination (Article 88). The 
Constitution also guarantees the protection of women against violence (Article 60) and it ensures 
equal labor rights for men and women (Article 89).  
3. 
The Women’s Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic was elevated to the rank 
of a Ministry in 2012. The Ministry designs plans and implements them to promote equality of 
opportunity between women and men. It currently coordinates the implementation of the Third 
National Plan for Equality between Women and Men 2008-2017. 56 
4. 
In terms of gender equality in endowments, specifically health and education, 
Paraguay has made clear progress but it lags behind LAC averages particularly in sexual 
and reproductive health outcomes. With regards to education, the female-to-male ratio in 
primary enrollment has remained almost the same for the last decade (0.96 in 2000 and 2011) 57. 
While boys are slightly favored in primary enrollment compared to girls, the gender gap is 
reversed in favor of girls as the level of education increases. The female-to-male ratio in 
secondary education was 1.05 and the ratio in tertiary education reached 1.31 in 2011. This trend 
is similar to the LAC region, where the gender gap in favor of girls grows as well with increasing 
levels of education (1.07 and 1.27 for female-to-male ratio in secondary and tertiary education 
for 2011 respectively). Paraguay and the LAC region have followed the same trend when it 
comes to persistence to last grade of primary education. In the case of Paraguay, 86.2 percent of 
female children reached the last grade of primary education, compared to 81.6 percent of boys in 
2010 (LAC: 85.8 percent of female children versus 81.4 percent of boys, 2010). Similarly, the

rate of male repeaters is higher than the rate of female repeaters (5.7 percent and 3.6 percent in 
2010 respectively) in primary education as well as in secondary education – although overall 
lower (1.3 percent and 0.5 percent in 2010 respectively). Paraguay performed better than the 
LAC region in terms of adult literacy rate (94.8 percent and 92.8 percent for men and women 
respectively in 2010, compared to 92.2 percent and 90.9 percent for men and women 
respectively in 2011 in LAC). Literacy rates amongst the youth are even higher – standing at 
98.7 percent for girls and 98.5 percent for boys in 2010, slightly higher than the average in the 
LAC region where it reached 97.3 percent for girls and 96.8 percent for boys in 2011.  
5. 
Although the indicators for sexual and reproductive health have improved over the 
last decade, Paraguay lags behind compared to the LAC region (particularly in maternal 
mortality and skilled birth attendance rates). The maternal mortality rate (MMR) has shown 
an improvement in the last decade. It dropped from 110 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 
99 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010. 58 However, this still compares high to the average in 
the LAC region (80 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010). Relatedly, the rate of births attended 
by skilled health staff increased from 77.1 percent in 2004 to 81.9 percent in 2008. However, 
Paraguay’s rate is still below the average one for the LAC region (90.12 percent in 2010). The 
share of pregnant women receiving prenatal care has increased from 94.2 percent in 2004 to 96.3 
percent in 2008, a rate now almost the same as the average rate in the LAC region (96.2 percent 
in 2009). The contraceptive prevalence rate has also consistently increased in the last few years 
from 72.8 percent in 2004 to 79.4 percent in 2008 – which puts Paraguay close to rates of its 
neighboring country Brazil (80.6 percent) and above, for example, Colombia (77 percent). 59 
6. 
Economic opportunities: Similar to many countries in LAC, despite women’s 
achievements in education, challenges still persist regarding their economic opportunities. 
They participate less in the labor market, earn lower wages, and suffer from higher 
unemployment and informality rates compared to their male counterparts. In Paraguay, women 
have made clear progress in labor force participation reaching 53.8 percent in 2012, a rate higher 
than the average for the LAC region (51.2 percent in 2012). Female labor force participation for 
young women (percentage of female population aged 15-24) is also higher (49.7 percent) than 
the average for the LAC region (42.6 percent). The female-to-male labor force participation ratio 
was 0.72 for Paraguay in 2012 (higher than the average ratio for LAC of 0.65 in 2011) - 
indicating that the gender gap is still in favor of men. Part-time work force is rapidly increasing 
in Paraguay, especially for women: From 24 percent (percentage of total female employment) in 
2000 to 31 percent in 2010. The male part-time employment participation only increased to 14 
percent in 2010. 60 While part-time regulations greatly enable women to conciliate domestic/care 
with remunerated work, it also comes at the cost of lower income and the reduction of 
probability to being promoted. Total female unemployment rate for Paraguay has slightly 
dropped from 8.8 percent in 2006 to 6.1 percent in 2012 and is now below the average for the 
LAC region (8.4 percent in 2011). At the same time, female unemployment is higher than the 
male unemployment rates (3.9 percent, in 2012 for males in Paraguay and 5.5 percent for males 
in the LAC region in 2011) both in Paraguay and in LAC. Moreover, the gender gap increases 
when unemployment amongst youth is analyzed. In Paraguay, the unemployment rate for young

girls is 14.6 percent (2011) compared to 9 percent for young males. The LAC average rate for 
young female unemployment is even higher (18.2 percent) – and so is the young male 
unemployment rate (12.4 percent, 2012). However, the female-to-male youth unemployment 
ratio in Paraguay exceeds the LAC average (1.62 compared to 1.47). Informality 61 is a common 
concern in Latin American countries. On average, each country in Latin America produces about 
40 percent of its GDP and employs 70 percent of its labor force informally. 62 In Paraguay, 67.9 
percent of all women work in the informal sector compared to 55 percent of all men. Moreover, 
the percentage of women working in the informal sector increases in rural areas (90.2 percent of 
all women compared to 76.7 percent of all men). 63 While the informal sector generates jobs, 
informal workers typically lack social protection such as worker benefits and health insurance. 
Additionally, informal workers perform their duties under irregular and casual contracts and are 
paid lower wages than in the formal sector. 64 The gender wage gap remained basically the same 
over the last decade: While women were making 69 percent of their male counterparts in 2000, 
they are now making 70 percent (2010, data from PLB 2012). 
7. 
Manifestations of the lack of agency 65 form some of the key challenges facing women 
in Paraguay today. Besides endowments and economic opportunities, agency is the third 
dimension of gender equality according to the World Development Report on Gender Equality 
and Development (2012). Agency can be understood as the process through which women and 
men use their endowments and take advantage of economic opportunities to achieve desired 
outcomes. Thus, agency is essential to understanding how gender outcomes emerge and why 
they are equal or unequal. Agency, or a lack thereof, can manifest itself for instance in low levels 
of female political participation, high prevalence of gender-based violence, or high rates of 
teenage pregnancy. 
8. 
Domestic violence continues to be a key problem which Paraguayan women suffer 
from. Violence against women has been recognized by the United Nations as a public health 
problem, a violation of women’s rights and a barrier for economic development. Law No. 1600 
“Against Domestic Violence” (2000) and the Penal Code are the legal instruments that address 
this issue. The Penal Code was reformed in 2007 and now includes psychological violence 
beyond other forms of violence. According to PAHO 2012, intimate partner violence against 
women is widespread in the LAC region. According to the Encuesta Nacional de Demografía y 
Salud Reproductiva (ENDSSR, 2008), 8 percent of women in Paraguay reported physical or 
sexual violence by their partner within the last 12 months, while 20.4 percent of women reported 
that they have experienced physical or sexual violence by their partner at some point in their 
lives. The same survey results indicate that there is a large gap between women who reside in 
urban areas compared to those who reside in rural areas. Indeed, four out of every ten women 
who live in urban areas experienced verbal violence (40.5 percent), compared to 28.7 percent of 
women in rural areas. The same is true when comparing physical violence; 20.2 percent of urban

transform those choices into desired outcomes.

women compared to 14.1 percent of rural women. In term of sexual violence there is a smaller 
difference when comparing the areas of residence (5.4 percent of women in urban areas and 4.5 
percent of women in rural areas). Another interesting finding is related to whether and/or where 
women look for help after experiencing any type of violence: 44.8 percent of the victims turn to 
family or friends after experiencing a violent episode, but the percentage of women who sought 
institutional help was much lower (12.9 percent 66). According to ENDSSR 2008, women in 
Paraguay cited shame, fear of retaliation, not knowing where to go, and not believing that anyone 
would help as the main reasons for not seeking help. Furthermore, among all countries in LAC 
with comparable data availability, Paraguay comes third in regards to women’s agreement that 
wife-beating is justified for at least one reason (22.9 percent, only after Ecuador and Haiti). 
9. 
Paraguay has implemented several measures to confront domestic violence. The 
Ministry of Women, through the Service to Women (Servicio de Atención a la Mujer - 
SEDAMUR) provides comprehensive information and advice to women victims of domestic 
violence; the government has amended the legal definitions of domestic violence and human 
trafficking in order to be more inclusive; the first shelter for victims of domestic violence has 
been created (in 2010); four Women Regional Centers have been established to provide 
comprehensive services for victims of gender-based violence around the country (located in 
Ciudad del Este, Filadelfia, Curuguaty and Pedro Juan Caballero); and finally, six specialized 
police stations have been established to receive complaints about violence against women, 
children and adolescents, among others. 
10. 
The adolescent fertility rate has decreased over time. From 86.1 births per 1,000 
women aged 15-19 years old in 2000 to 66.9 in 2012. This rate is quite similar to the average rate 
in the LAC region (68 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19years old) for 2012. However, it is 
notable that, while adolescent fertility has decreased over time, the contribution of adolescent 
fertility to total fertility increased (10.5 percent in 1987-90 to 12.8 percent 2005-08) according to 
data from ENDSSR 2008. 67 Also, the reduction in fertility per specific age group is smallest 
amongst teenagers if compared to other age groups and smaller if compared to the total fertility 
rate. ENDSSR 2008 also showed that teenage pregnancy is not evenly distributed amongst 
different ethnic and socio-economic groups, thus indicating that the phenomenon is correlated 
with social exclusion and lack of (economic) opportunities. According to the survey, the 
socioeconomic status and the level of education of young women are inversely proportional to 
the probability of experiencing at least one pregnancy: 5 out of 10 women aged 15-19 years old 
with zero or up to five completed years of education reported having had a pregnancy or more 
(52.2 percent), while among women with 12 and more years of completed education, only two 
out of ten reported at least one pregnancy (21.5 percent). Notably though, the proportion of 
pregnant women aged 15-19 years old is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. 
11. Women in Paraguay remain under-represented at all levels of government. In 2012, 
women occupied 17.5 percent of total parliamentary seats while the average for the LAC region 
for that same year was 24.8 percent. It has to be noted though that this is a significant increase 
from the low level (2.5 percent) in 2000. Similarly, although the percentage of women mayors 
has increased from 2.7 percent in 1998 to 7.5 percent in 2011, the percentage continues to be 
below the average of the LAC region that was 10.2 percent in 2011. It is notable though that

WBG Portfolio 
The objective of the portfolio review carried out in preparation of the CPS was to 
12. 
provide the country team with an assessment of how the WBG is doing in terms of gender 
mainstreaming. Based on this assessment, the country team will develop strategies to strengthen 
the gender focus into project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The Bank 
addresses gender issues in its current portfolio in Paraguay through analysis, respective actions 
and by monitoring progress in a sex-disaggregated way. Overall, 80 percent of the lending 
portfolio is gender-informed 69 and 60 percent of the same are gender-informed in all three 
dimensions. 70 Some concrete examples of how the portfolio is addressing gender issues in the 
different sectors are briefly described below. 
13. 
The Sustainable Agriculture & Rural Development Project (PRODERS) builds on a 
gender analysis of the role that women play as agricultural producers in the project context. The 
project is building capacity of local women and promotes the establishment of women’s 
associations, ensuring that women play a role in the day-to-day functioning of their sub-projects 
through meaningful representation on the communities committees. Particularly, the capacity to 
generate income will be strengthened among indigenous women by supporting handicraft 
activities in indigenous communities supported by the project. The project is monitoring the 
share of beneficiaries by sex - latest available data showed that 39 percent of members of the 
associations supported by the project are women. While the majority of associations supported 
by the project are mixed, 49 associations supported are women-only groups. 
14. 
The Project for the Conservation of Biodiversity and Sustainable Land Management 
in the Atlantic Forest of Eastern Paraguay includes a gender analysis on the role that female 
small farmers and female headed households play in natural resource management. Furthermore, 
this project builds on PRODERS’ strategy to build capacity of local women, promote the 
establishment of women's associations, and encourage their participation in project decision-
making. The project will monitor the number of subprojects to be executed by women as well as 
the overall beneficiaries in a sex-disaggregated way in the project’s annual plans to ensure 
gender-sensitive implementation. 
15. 
The Road Maintenance Project builds on an analysis of the situation of women in the 
department regarding different aspects (e.g. unemployment, economic assets, types of 
discrimination, etc.) and their role in farmers’ families (e.g. land cultivation). The Road 
maintenance project includes a pilot for the creation of “Microenterprises for Road 
Maintenance”, where an affirmative action approach ensured a 29 percent of staff hired for the 
pilot were female - to ensure women benefit equally from employment opportunities created, at 
the same time challenging traditionally gendered segregation within the labor market. At the 
moment, the project implementation unit is expanding this pilot-approach to a broader set of the 
roads under maintenance, creating in total 200 posts and working within the Ministry of Public 
Works and Communications to scale-up this experience. Finally, a planned impact evaluation 
will capture disaggregated data by gender that provides information on access to services (health, 

69 Using the methodology used by PRMGE 

70 There is one project in the portfolio that is not gender-informed. This translates into 20 percent of projects not 
being gender informed. At the same time, due to the technical nature of the project and its components, it seems 
reasonable that it is not a gender informed project (the Energy Sector strengthening Project). If the project cannot be 
gender-informed by definition of its technical nature, it should not be flagged as not complying with the gender 
requirements.

education, water, power, etc.), transportation patterns, levels of education, and economic 
activities, among others. Similar projects (particularly an Impact Evaluation (IE) in 2006 for a 
similar project in Peru) have shown the following gender-related impacts: (i) School attendance 
of girls between 6 and 11 years old increased (by 5 percent from 2004 to 2006); (ii) Non-
remunerated activities performed by women have been reduced (by 12 percent from 2004 to 
2006); (iii) Women living in the areas of intervention have reported that thanks to road 
improvements the time they spend getting food and kerosene has reduced; (iv) Women also 
reported an increase in political participation at the local level; and, (v) Reductions in travel time 
to school and health centers have been translated into more free time for women to participate in 
economical and associative activities. Furthermore, a recently completed IE 2014 (for Peru as 
well) is showing that school attendance for girls between 12 and 18 years old increased (by 19 
percent from 2006) and visits to the health center by women increased (by 57 percent from 
2006).  
16. 
In terms of analytical work, the Equity Assessment for Paraguay, has a strong gender 
focus, not only providing sex-disaggregated analysis in general, but specifically by dedicated in-
depth analysis on women’s labor market outcomes and teenage pregnancy in the country.

Annex 6. Consultations with Stakeholders 

1. 
The WBG in partnership with the GoP organized in-country consultations in 
preparation of the Country Partnership Strategy. Sectorial meetings with the following 
groups were organized: (i) international donor community that included the embassies and 
diplomatic missions, international cooperation organizations and bilateral and multilateral 
organizations; (ii) opinion leaders; (iii) private sector which included representatives of business, 
production and financial sector associations; and (iv) civil society that included organizations 
working on issues of poverty, citizen participation, transparency, education and anti-corruption. 

Consultation with the Donor Community 

2. 
The Consultation with the donor community showed a high level of consensus on 
development priorities and challenges faced by Paraguay. The representatives of the 
international community pointed out that Paraguay has changed and that the economic growth 
experienced in the last decade has led to the country's progress in various sectors. It was stated 
that this new scenario requires a change to the traditional model of bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation. Representatives of international organizations agreed that the government's 
demands to their organizations are also currently focused on the transfer of knowledge, and not 
only on the transfer of funds. 

3. 
Despite the positive changes in the macro economy and the private sector, the 
perception from several donors is that the public sector continues to face the enormous 
challenge of substantially improving the quality of delivery of public services. In this sense, 
the effective and efficient execution of cooperation projects is one of the significant shared 
objectives. The public sector remains weak, especially in the quality of its human resources and 
internal management systems, with excessive bureaucracy in the internal processes. Donors 
agreed that further efforts are needed in order to strengthen the project implementation units. 
Common areas where two or more agencies could work together were identified, such as 
procurement. 

4. 
Donor coordination and harmonization of programs of cooperation is another major 
challenge, and there was general consensus that the government needs to define a work plan with 
the international community to avoid duplication of projects or overlapping of work in strategic 
sectors (e.g. energy, and water and sanitation).  The knowledge exchange agenda should also 
have a high degree of coordination. A key recommendation is that the cooperation activities and 
operations should support long-term programs that transcend presidential terms, such as the 
research towards the National Education Plan and the National Health Plan, and not focus only 
on solving short-term problems. Participants in the meeting agreed on the need to further 
strengthen the role of civil society in cooperation programs to ensure project monitoring and 
proper accountability.  

5. 
Development partners noted that an important change that must be observed and taken 
into account in their strategies is the increasing urbanization rate that the country is experiencing 
and the challenges linked to that this change, with focus on infrastructure.. In addition, 
cooperation should help to strengthen the links between the central government and local 

91 

 
 
  
 
 
 
governments. There is an opportunity to achieve this goal by promoting dialogue platforms on 
development issues, involving the central government and local governments. They also noted 
that there are emerging issues that are not being considered in terms of public policy. For 
example, the potential of extractive industries and in particular the possibility of finding oil in the 
Chaco, that could drastically change the country's GDP. The country is not ready to respond to 
the externalities linked to this potential development and it must be supported to develop novel, 
innovative initiatives and to generate the necessary structures and instruments to take advantage 
of this potential scenario.  

Consultation with Opinion Leaders 

6. 
Opinion Leaders emphasized that there are urgent public sector reforms that have to be 
implemented, such as improving tax collection capacity, improving the quality of public 
spending, and improving mechanisms for accountability and citizen participation and public 
transparency mechanisms. It was recognized that although a "wave of public transparency" is 
being experienced in Paraguay (which leads to insight into the performance of public 
expenditure) and that -like never before- country data is available to the public, data are neither 
readily accessible nor easy to read. Participants were of the opinion that the WBG could play a 
role in supporting the development of friendly platforms to facilitate access to public 
information. There was also consensus that the rationalization of public expenditure should be 
one of the priorities for the country in the short and medium terms. For instance, incentive and 
merits schemes and open competitive processes  for selecting public officials should be created. 
The WBG could facilitate knowledge exchange channels to provide alternatives for this kind of 
initiative.  

7. 
Opinion Leaders also indicated that they believe that tax evasion is very high in Paraguay 
(approx. 40 percent of potential revenue) and that tax collection agencies should be strengthened 
through the development and implementation of an information crosscheck system, for example. 
It was stated that the country must strengthen its regulatory capacity, especially relevant to the 
issue of PPPs, vis-à-vis the investment boom that the country is facing. It was also noted that it is 
very important that the WBG continues to work to strengthen the infrastructure development in 
Paraguay, which has been identified as a chronic deficit that must be mitigated. The issues 
related to housing and sanitation infrastructure were highlighted as two of the most  important 
urban challenges taking into account that Paraguay could have 15 major cities in the next 10 
years. On financing for the private sector, the support provided to traditional sectors such as 
agribusiness was assessed, but it was also recommended to support sectors that - while  not yet 
consolidated– have vast potential, such as, sewage treatment plants, reforestation ventures, new 
technologies development to diversify the productive matrix and increase productivity (e.g. 
irrigation systems). It was noted that the WBG could play a crucial role in supporting the 
Government to enhance public expenditure implementation and management; and that could also 
contribute to the development of tax evasion prevention and anti-corruption programs and 
initiatives. The WBG is seen as an organization that can share experiences from other countries 
in these areas.  

Consultation with the private sector 

92 

 
 
 
 
 
 
8. 
The private sector expressed a consensus that while Paraguay has changed, there are still 
gaps in key sectors that should be addressed, and in this sense the biggest problem is still related 
to infrastructure development. The country has geographic advantages which are being well used 
by the private sector. However, the competitiveness of the country should be strengthened to 
maintain sustainable performance over the long term. The private sector representatives agreed 
that the country's main problem is not funding but management capacity. Focusing on rules and 
standards which determine the working environment of the public sector (and which go beyond 
their legal formulation) was identified as crucial.  

Consultation with Civil Society 

9. 
Civil Society organizations indicated that there is a major weakness in terms of 
instruments and official channels to monitor government institutions, and that isolated bottom-up 
control initiatives have been developed but few coordinated actions exist at the national level. It 
was stated that the WBG could provide support to the Open Government initiatives, with special 
focus on Public Private Partnership projects 
that will require 
the development and 
implementation of stringent control and monitoring instruments. Another priority identified was 
the need to strengthen the civil servant training programs to enhance the quality of public 
policies management.  Lack of coordination between line ministries and agencies was also 
highlighted as one of the main challenges.  A reform in the education sector, with a focus on 
higher education, was also identified as a priority. Finally, it was recommended to generate 
opportunities for civil society organizations to have a more active role in the monitoring and 
evaluation of programs financed by the WBG and that as part of this process the WBG could 
also have an active role in strengthening these CSO’s with knowledge and resources to improve 
their monitoring and evaluation capabilities.

Annex 10. Survey on Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking (SWIFT) 

Paraguay Water & Sanitation SWIFT Survey Experience  
1. 
The WBG’s twin goals—eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity—
have intensified interest in measuring the level and evolution of poverty rates and income levels 
in populations targeted by projects and programs. Operations that cover the poorer segments of 
the population are a necessary, though not sufficient, prerequisite for faster progress towards the 
elimination of extreme poverty and the sustained increase in the average level of welfare of the 
bottom 40% of a country’s population.  

2. 
Thus, there is a need for quick, practical, low cost, and reliable tools for estimating 
poverty rates and income levels among WBG project beneficiaries. Traditionally, official 
poverty rates have been measured at the national level, or in some cases -for urban and rural 
areas of developing countries- via nationally representative surveys that collect information on 
household and individual socioeconomic characteristics and detailed information on income 
and/or consumption expenditures for a sample of households. The sheer size of the questionnaire 
and volume of information required for reliable measurement of household welfare (i.e. income 
or consumption) makes these types of surveys impractical and prohibitively costly for 
measurement at project level. 

3. 
In addition, a large obstacle in monitoring these goals is that household expenditure and 
income data are not frequently collected. According to World Development Indicators (as of 
May 2013), some 40 percent of developing countries had zero or only one poverty estimate 
between 2001 and 2010. And the situation is even worse when it comes to the monitoring of 
investment projects and lending programs. Since the impact of many investment projects and 
lending programs is geographically limited, poverty estimates at the national level, or even for 
urban and rural areas, are not directly useful for monitoring project impacts on extreme poverty 
and shared prosperity. 

4. 
To address this problem the WBG Poverty Global Practice (GPVDR) developed the a 
new welfare monitoring tool, SWIFT (Survey on Well-being via Instant and Frequent Tracking) 
to fill the data gaps in the monitoring of national statistics and projects by calculating poverty 
rates and income levels in a more simply, cheaply, and quickly manner. SWIFT achieves this by 
combining the latest in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with the latest 
statistical methodology. 

Conceptual Framework 
5. 
SWIFT uses a projection method to estimate poverty and distributional statistics. It does 
not collect direct income or consumption data; instead, it collects poverty correlates, such as 
household size, ownership of assets or employment conditions, and then converts them to 
poverty statistics using statistical models. Collection of poverty correlates is much easier and can 
be accomplished much more quickly than collection of income or consumption data. Second, 
SWIFT uses Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) software to create a questionnaire 
and allow full accessibility from tablets and/or smart phones.

6. 
Interviewers ask questions regarding poverty correlates using the tablets or smart phones 
and the data are uploaded via the Internet to a data cloud whenever interviewers reach any 
location where Internet connections are available. Data analysts then download the data and 
convert them into poverty and distributional statistics. 

SWIFT for Paraguay Water & Sanitation Modernization Project 
7. 
As part of the preparation of the Paraguay CPS, the Bank team worked to monitor the 
contribution of four major projects in the country on reduction of extreme poverty and boosting 
shared prosperity. As part of this process, the team has decided to use SWIFT to monitor a water 
and sanitation program’s poverty impact as well as immediate sector-specific outcomes (e.g. 
increase in access to clean water). 

8. 
In the context of Paraguay project monitoring, the SWIFT survey will produce a poverty 
rate and a mean income of the bottom 40 percent in the beginning of the CPS process in areas 
where the water and sanitation project has been implemented. These numbers will become a 
benchmark. The same survey will be carried out during the preparation of the CPS progress 
report to see evolution in these key indicators. 

9. 
A surveying company was selected to carry out the field work. Before the beginning of 
the fieldwork, a training session was carries out, in a four-day event, for the ten enumerators and 
two supervisors. Representatives from the government’s health agency (SENASA) also attended 
the first day. Enumerators and supervisors gained a strong understanding of the questionnaire 
content as well as CAPI, tablet, and 3G technology. In addition, they provided valuable local 
contextual knowledge to improve the content of the questionnaire where appropriate. The 
surveying company then proceeded to the field to conduct approximately 800 interviews in rural 
communities in western and eastern Paraguay, both indigenous and non-indigenous.  

10. 
A major obstacle encountered during the survey fieldwork was heavy rain and resulting 
poor road conditions that prevented the team to access to some of the selected communities. 
However, enumerators ultimately reached all but three communities, which will be visited at the 
end of June. Another obstacle was the lack of connectivity for tablets. Often tablets lacked 3G, 
Wi-Fi, and GPS capacities in the rural communities, particularly the indigenous areas. This 
meant the upload of completed surveys was not literally real-time, nor were the revisions from 
the supervisors. Nonetheless, resulting survey data has thus far been high quality. 

SWIFT Model for other projects in the Bank’s portfolio in Paraguay 
11. 
SWIFT model will be used also to monitor other project’s poverty impact as well as 
immediate sector-specific outcomes, when required. While the team will use the National 
Household data for the Energy Sector Strengthening project because it has a nation-wide impact; 
the team will use other project-linked surveys for the Roads Maintenance Project and the 
Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project (PRODERS).
