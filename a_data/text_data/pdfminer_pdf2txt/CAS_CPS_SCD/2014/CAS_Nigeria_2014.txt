EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
The Nigeria Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers the period FY2014-2017 and 
is fully aligned with the goals of Nigeria’s development agenda, Vision 20:2020, and its 
medium-term strategy for realizing that vision, the Transformation Agenda 2011-2015. The 
CPS represents the World Bank Group’s (WBG) program under the Country Assistance 
Framework (CAF) developed by Nigeria’s partners to coordinate interventions based on each 
partner’s comparative advantage in order to deliver rapid results. With this strategy, Nigeria is 
officially entering blend status, having been declared creditworthy for IBRD financing in FY13 
and having exceeded the IDA operational cut-off.  
Nigeria is One of Africa’s Potential Economic Powerhouses 
2. With its strong fundamentals, including consistent and strong growth since 1999, 
Nigeria qualifies as one of the continent’s potential economic powerhouses. Nigeria is the 
most populous country of the continent (171 million people in 2012) and the second largest 
economy after South Africa. Ranking 13rd in the world, Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer 
and also holds the second highest proven reserves in the continent after Libya. After decades of 
military rule, the country has successfully engaged on the path of democracy since 1999, and 
since then has enjoyed consistent and strong growth. All of these factors make Nigeria one of the 
continent’s potential economic powerhouses.  
3. Responsible macroeconomic policies have supported a high degree of economic 
stability. The introduction of the fiscal reserve Excess Crude Account (ECA) in 2004 has 
facilitated the implementation of countercyclical fiscal policy, including the financing of an 
effective stimulus package during the world financial crisis of 2008-2009. Since 2011, the 
Government has actively pursued fiscal consolidation, and monetary policy has been 
tightened along with the recovery of the banking sector from the crisis of 2009. Inflation is 
also slowing down.    
To Unlock its Full Potential, Nigeria Needs to Tackle Some Critical Development Challenges 
4. 
So far, with rapid population growth, Nigeria has made slow progress in reducing 
poverty. With a median age of 14 and population growth at close to 3 percent, Nigeria faces the 
challenge of providing jobs for its teeming youth population. Despite the robust growth over the 
last decade, rapid population growth combined with increasing inequality hampered faster 
poverty reduction. The poverty (consumption per capita) declined from 48 percent in 2004 to 46 
percent in 2010 using the adult equivalent methodology. The percentage of Nigerians living in 
extreme poverty (US$1.25 per capita per day, purchasing power parity adjusted) declined from 
64 to 63 percent. Given population growth, this implies that the number of extreme poor 
increased from 86 million in 2004 to 100 million in 2010.  
5. 
The key challenge facing Nigeria is therefore how to leverage its oil resources to 
promote sustained inclusive growth, reduce poverty, inequality and unemployment.  
Nigeria is highly dependent on oil, which makes the country vulnerable to commodity price 
volatility.  Nigeria needs to diversify its economy to achieve sustainable inclusive growth and 
accelerate the creation of jobs. Nigeria has been growing at 6 to 8 percent annually over the past 
decade but will need to achieve even higher growth rates to make a dent in poverty. This will 
require effective macroeconomic management, socio-political stability, the provision of key 
infrastructure, structural reforms to reduce impediments to diversified growth, and more 
effective efforts to achieve social inclusion. Given the large regional, social, and economic 

vii 

 
disparities and conflict and insecurity in some parts of the country, achieving these 
objectives requires a resolute and differentiated approach.  
The Government has Formulated a Clear Vision, and is Implementing its Transformation 
Agenda to Address the above Challenges 
6. 
The Vision 20:2020 and its medium-term implementation strategy focus on 
promoting sustainable growth and welfare improvements. Specifically, the Vision 20:2020 
aims to: (a) optimize the country’s human and natural resource potential to achieve rapid 
economic growth and (b) translate that growth into equitable social development for all citizens. 
The medium-term strategy for achieving these goals, the Transformation Agenda, aims at: (a) 
creating a sufficient number of jobs to address the protracted problems of unemployment and 
long-term poverty; (b) laying the foundation for a robust and inclusive growth of the 
Nigerian economy; and (c) improving and sustaining the well-being of all Nigerians 
regardless of their personal circumstances and location. The Government is implementing 
critical programs to: (i) address the structural problems of access to power and to finance; (ii) 
unlock agricultural potential; (iii) create opportunities for job creation; and (iv) implement 
some safety net programs. Preliminary achievements are showing results illustrated by the 
dynamism of some sectors such as ICT and e-commerce, the innovation of young entrepreneurs, 
and an increased interest in Nigeria by international investors and the Nigerian diaspora. 
7. 
The authorities are continuing with efforts to strengthen governance.  Great strides are 
being made in introducing a treasury single account, an integrated financial management system, 
increasing transparency of revenue allocations, and improving access to information about the 
budget. Reforms have also been announced and initiated in customs, tax administration and 
pension administration. International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) have been 
introduced at all levels of government under the federal government leadership. While this is 
work in progress, the reform marks an important milestone, given the strong federal impetus on 
state-level governance reforms in this area. At state level, the picture varies from state to state, 
with some states making headway in public financial management and citizen consultation.  
The World Bank Group Program 
8. 
In support of these objectives, the CPS program is structured around three strategic 
clusters: (a) promoting diversified growth and job creation by reforming the power sector, 
enhancing agricultural productivity, and increasing access to finance; (b) improving the quality 
and efficiency of social service delivery at the state level to promote social inclusion; and (c) 
strengthening governance and public sector management, with gender equity and conflict 
sensitivity as essential elements of governance. WBG support to structural reform agendas for 
diversified growth and jobs focuses specifically on: (a) increasing installed power generation and 
transmission capacity and improving the efficiency and governance of electricity delivery; (b) 
boosting agricultural productivity, improving farmers’ linkages with agro-processors, and 
scaling up resilience to current and future climate variability; and (c)   increasing the supply of 
long-term financing for the housing sector, expanding financing opportunities for SMEs, and 
strengthening the ability of Development Finance Institutions to mobilize private finance for 
key sectors of the economy.   
Principles of Engagement 
9. 
The WBG program is based on a country diagnosis, strong demand by federal and state 
authorities, and WBG comparative advantage. The program seeks to strike the right balance 
between actions to strengthen the enabling environment and direct interventions, recognizing that 

viii 

 
all activities need to be assessed from a governance perspective. This should lead to:  more 
selectivity; a more candid recognition of risks; better identification of reform potential; and 
performance-based approaches rather than funding inputs to leverage changes in systems and 
incentives. It will also seek to enhance the role that citizens can and should play in shaping the 
reform agenda. Both the Government and WBG recognize the importance of focusing on results. 
Therefore, improving information systems, feedback loops, adaptation and learning will become 
key features of the new strategy, in both the existing portfolio and new operations. 
10. The strategy recognizes that the WBG’s impact derives not only from its financial 
resources, which are small compared to the country’s own resources, but also from its 
knowledge work, its deep engagement with federal and state authorities, its understanding 
of the nuances of local contexts, and its ability to mobilize other partners. The CPS will 
support demonstrational and catalytic interventions in areas where: (a) the WBG has a real 
comparative advantage vis-à-vis other partners; and (b) there is high likelihood of durable impact 
on poverty reduction and of replication without additional donor funding.  
11. The strategy foresees close cooperation among development partners to enhance the 
effectiveness and transformational impact of national efforts. The WBG will collaborate with 
CAF partners to leverage external resources and enhance the role of knowledge partnerships in 
building capacity at the state level, furthering the federal Government’s reform agenda, and 
developing platforms for engagement in new areas such as job creation, socio-economic 
development in the North, and urbanization.  
Risks and Mitigating Factors  
12. The strategy faces several risks and has built-in flexibility to allow for appropriate 
responses. Risks to the CPS implementation include economic volatility related to the pace of 
global recovery; a reversal of capital inflows; lower oil prices and oil production; less reform or 
more spending in the lead up to the 2015 elections; in-country violence and insecurity; the 
opposition of vested interests to reform; and instability in the sub-region. The strategy therefore 
has built-in flexibility to allow for appropriate responses to changing country circumstances and 
evolving development opportunities. In particular, the WBG program has been set flexibly to 
allow for mid-term adjustment to take into account additional FY2014-FY2015 diagnostic work 
and engagement with the new Government in 2015.

FY2014-2017 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR 
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA 
I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2010-2013 for the Federal Republic 
Nigeria was updated in the CPS Progress Report in September 2011. The CPS was aligned 
with the country’s Seven Point Agenda and the Vision 20:2020 and the priorities identified by 
the earlier administration, and endorsed by the current administration. The CPS, prepared in 
partnership with the Department for International Development (DFID), the United States 
Agency for International Development (USAID) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), 
focused on four broad themes: (a) mitigating the impact of the global economic crisis; (b) 
improving governance, (c) maintaining non-oil growth; and (d) promoting human development. 
2. 
The new Nigeria CPS covers the period FY2014-FY2017 and introduces a change in 
the country’s borrowing status. Nigeria was declared creditworthy for IBRD financing in 
FY2013 and is officially entering blend status in FY2014.  
3. 
The new CPS reflects the World Bank Group’s commitment to exploit synergies to 
generate maximum development impact through innovative solutions, and to leverage 
WBG knowledge and technical expertise through other partners’ resources. The CPS has 
been developed and will be implemented in close coordination with development partners, as 
articulated in the Country Assistance Framework (CAF – Annex 8). The CAF is the common 
strategic approach of Nigeria’s development partners in support of the Government’s 
development plans. 
4. 
The overarching objective of the CPS is to support the Government’s goals of laying 
the foundation for socially and regionally inclusive growth with a specific focus on reducing 
poverty and increasing shared prosperity. The CPS builds upon two key Government 
documents – the Vision 20:2020 and the Transformation Agenda. The Vision 20:2020 sets out 
Nigeria’s long term development objectives.  The Transformation Agenda represents a medium-
term strategy (2011-2015) for operationalizing Vision 20:2020 and its 2013 mid-term review 
provides information on the performance of all sectors. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT  
II.A.  Social and Political Context 

5. Nigeria is a diverse country with major opportunities and complex challenges.  
Consisting of thirty-six states and the Federal Capital Territory, the Federation is divided into six 
geo-political zones. With more  than 400 ethnolinguistic groups, it also features significant 
contrasts in terms of economic and social outcomes:  robust economic growth and yet modest 
poverty reduction; dynamic urban growth centers and isolated rural areas;  and widening social 
and income disparities in the context of abundant natural and human resources.  
6. 
 Oil has been the dominant source of government revenue since the 1970s, and has 
been at the heart of the political debate as well as a major driver of the creation of new states in 

1 

 
the Federation. Nigeria shares governance challenges with other developing countries with a 
large amount of natural resource revenue. 
7. Nigeria’s democracy is deepening but, like other young democracies, it is also facing 
challenges. The combination of abundant oil wealth and nation building has produced a durable 
yet contested federal system, a multi-party democracy, and important forms of institution 
building (increasing separation of powers, more autonomy of the judiciary, gradual improvement 
in electoral processes and a proliferation of civil society organizations). The last general election 
in 2011 received high praise for being well-managed, despite some post-election violence in 
northern Nigeria.  
8. 
States in Nigeria operate with a high degree of autonomy. States and local governments 
in Nigeria control more than half of the nation’s revenue and are responsible for the provision of 
services that directly influence growth and poverty, such as primary and secondary education, 
health care, water and sanitation, rural infrastructure, and community services. The high degree 
of autonomy provides states, particularly those with dynamic and progressive leadership, an 
opportunity to move ahead on their own. This autonomy, however, also poses a challenge to 
building national consensus across different levels of government, including in the areas of 
macroeconomic stability, prioritizing public resource allocation, and meeting minimal national 
standards in service delivery. 
9. While most Nigerians live in peaceful coexistence, contentious relations among 
different groups have arisen in several parts of the country. Since independence in 1960, 
Nigeria’s political history has been turbulent, punctuated by periods of urban riots and political 
confrontations. Currently, some of the most significant challenges include: (a) the insurgency 
of a violent group popularly known as Boko Haram in the North East, where service delivery is 
the weakest and poverty rates are the highest (since June 2013, the three northeastern states, 
Adamawa, Yobe and Borno, have been under a state of emergency to curb the violence and 
insurgency acts of Boko Haram); (b) inter-communal violence over access to economic and 
natural resources and political power throughout the country, but especially in Plateau State; 
(c) kidnappings, armed robbery, oil theft and communal conflicts over oil spills. especially in 
the South-South; and (d) ongoing efforts to reintegrate militants under an Amnesty Law in the 
Niger Delta. 
10. The 2015 national elections might limit the space for policy reform in the next 12 to 
18 months. With the next round of elections scheduled for early 2015, the positioning of 
political parties – including within parties - is in full swing. In order to build national 
consensus around common goals, the Government called a national conference from mid-
March to end-May 2014 to bring together Nigerians representing the various states, ethnic 
groups, professional groups and trade unions, civil society organizations, religious and 
traditional groups and political parties.   

II.B.  Recent Macroeconomic Performance and Medium-Term Outlook  

11. Nigeria’s recent good macroeconomic management has provided a stable base for 
growth. Nigeria’s high dependence on oil makes prudent macroeconomic management and 
strong countercyclical fiscal policy essential to maintaining macroeconomic stability. To this 
end, Nigeria took the critical step in 2004 of establishing a fiscal reserve fund, the Excess 
Crude Account (ECA). An accumulated fiscal reserve of US$22 billion proved essential for 

2 

 
financing a stimulus package that maintained growth and stability during the global financial 
crisis of 2008-2009.  
12. Following the 2008-2009 global financial crises, the banking sector was effectively 
recapitalized and regulation enhanced, mitigating risks. The 2013 Financial Sector Stability 
Assessment1 concludes that the banking sector has been successfully stabilized and that banking 
supervision has been strengthened markedly in the process. The Assessment also highlights 
remaining weaknesses and risks that still need to be addressed, including the transparency of 
ownership structures, the strengthening of cross-border supervisory arrangements, the phasing-
out of the activities of the bank’s restructuring agency (AMCOM) and the reform of 
development finance.  
13. The fiscal authorities pursued countercyclical policy in 2011-2013, after some 
slippage in 2010, achieving significant budgetary consolidation. The estimated general 
government deficit was reduced from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2012.  The 
expected federal budget deficit in 2013 is 1.85 percent of GDP. The current Medium Term Fiscal 
Framework prescribes continued consolidation, with the Federal Budget Deficit falling steadily 
to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2016. 
14. Monetary policy has also been responsive and effective. Following significant capital 
inflows in recent years, the Central Bank of Nigeria has managed liquidity through changes in 
the Cash Reserve Ratio and the issuance of securities. The tight monetary stance helped reduce 
the pace of consumer price inflation to 8 percent in 2013 from double digits in previous years. 
The CBN has also smoothed exchange rate volatility to a large extent, and has maintained a high 
degree of exchange rate stability.  
15. The Nigerian economy has continued to grow at a rapid pace in recent years.  GDP 
growth has been in the range of 6-8 percent, concentrated primarily in trade, agriculture, and 
telecommunications. These three sectors alone accounted for roughly 80 percent of GDP growth 
during 2009-2012 (GDP statistics are currently being re-based according to a new methodology 
that should afford a reassessment of the size and growth of the Nigerian economy). The 
estimated pace of annual GDP growth has slowed somewhat since 2011, falling from over 
7 percent to 6.6 percent in 2012. Growth has slowed in oil and gas, agriculture and trade. The 
slowdown in agriculture and trade is believed to be related to disruptions from unusually severe 
flooding in 2012 and security problems in some parts of the country. Growth in agriculture 
rebounded somewhat in 2013 in the context of better weather conditions and policy initiatives in 
that sector.  In at least some parts of Nigeria, such as Lagos State, rapid economic growth has 
been transformational and can be associated with significant poverty reduction and an emerging 
middle class.  Inflows of foreign direct investment to Nigeria have been in the range of US$6-8 
billion in recent years, making it one of the top destinations for investment in Africa.  
16. Lower oil production presents an increasing macroeconomic challenge. Nigeria’s oil 
output has contracted in the last three years, with negative growth in 2012 and 2013.  
Regulatory constraints, other uncertainties, and security risks have limited investment in oil and 
natural gas. Investors have been hesitant to make new investments in the light of uncertainty 
regarding legal, regulatory, and fiscal terms in the pending Petroleum Industry Bill currently 
being examined by the National Assembly. Increasing instances of disruptions to pipeline

operations and oil theft have also played a major role in the recent decline in oil output. Projected 
slow growth in international oil trade, which is partly related to the US shale boom, may place 
downward pressures on oil prices over the medium term, with implications for Nigerian oil 
revenues. Due primarily to shortfalls in expected oil revenues, the balance of the Excess Crude 
Account declined to US$2.5 billion in February 2014, down from US$11.5 billion at the end of 
2012. Reconciliation efforts for the flow of funds from the National Oil Company (NNPC) to the 
Nigeria Federation Account have also been the subject of public controversies. A forensic audit 
has been requested by the authorities.   
17. Countercyclical macroeconomic management is essential for stability, growth, and 
diversification. Nigeria needs to counteract the volatility in oil prices and production with 
strongly countercyclical macroeconomic policy. This can provide the macroeconomic stability 
needed for sustaining rapid diversified growth. The accumulation of a fiscal reserve offers 
protection from a negative oil price or production shock, and also enhances investor 
confidence. By preventing excessive overheating and real currency appreciation in boom 
times, countercyclical fiscal policy also prevents an associated erosion of competitiveness of 
Nigerian firms. The effective management of a fiscal reserve is essential for the achievement 
of countercyclical fiscal policy. Nigeria has passed legislation to reform fiscal reserve 
management in the country, involving a shift from the current Excess Crude Account to a 
Sovereign Wealth Fund based on clearer rules and regulations.  
18. The overall macroeconomic outlook for Nigeria over the period of the CPS appears 
strong, assuming that oil output stabilizes and oil prices remain strong. Under these 
conditions, the foreign inflows that generated the balance of payments surplus and reserve 
accumulation will likely continue, and will help stimulate domestic demand that has been driving 
growth. The Government has pursued responsible macroeconomic policy, and assumed a prudent 
fiscal stance in 2013 in light of lower oil revenues, compressing expenditures rather than 
depleting the ECA further. Stronger oil production would alleviate the current tight financial 
constraints on Government programs. There is strong potential for accelerated growth and job 
creation if key infrastructure and institutional constraints can be successfully addressed, along 
with a clarification of regulatory conditions for oil and gas. There are substantial risks to the 
macroeconomic outlook, however. If growth in oil output and exports does not resume in the 
near future, balance of payments and budgetary pressures could become progressively greater, 
and investor sentiment toward Nigeria could deteriorate. The lack of investment in recent years 
in upstream oil exploration and development will limit production in the medium term. Given the 
current low level of fiscal reserves, Nigeria is also vulnerable to an oil price shock, although its 
current strong debt position will offer some room for borrowing in that event. Uncertainty related 
to the pace of global recovery as well as the security situation in Northern Nigeria and the 
upcoming elections also feed into the macroeconomic picture. Nigeria stands at a time of great 
opportunity, but also risk and uncertainty. Table 1 gives projections for an optimistic scenario 
under the assumption that oil prices remain strong, oil output stabilizes, responsible 
macroeconomic policy is sustained, and reforms continue. 
19. Nigeria’s long term growth outlook is also affected by climate change risks. Nigeria’s 
economy is dependent on climate-sensitive and climate-impactful industries, such as 
agriculture, forestry, and extraction.  Recent World Bank analysis 2 indicates that, if not

addressed in time, climate change is expected to exacerbate Nigeria’s vulnerability to weather 
swings and limit its ability to sustain the objective of the Vision 20-20 through reduced crop 
yields, declining productivity of livestock, and variability in water availability.  Climate-
related challenges will be compounded by increasing population pressure on land and water 
resources and rapid urbanization. However, Nigeria can adopt a range of technological 
solutions and management options that can help better handle climate variability and build 
resilience against a harsher climate.

II.C.  The Poverty Challenges 

20. This CPS has been prepared in the context of the World Bank Group’s renewed 
commitment to the twin goals of reducing the number of people living below US$1.25 per 
capita per day to 3 percent by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. The 3 percent target is a 
global target, while shared prosperity is a country-specific target measured by income growth of 
the bottom 40 percent of the population. Nigeria’s progress in reducing extreme poverty is 
important for achieving the 3 percent global target because it is the most populous country in 
Africa and the seventh most populous in the world.

21. So far, with rapid population growth, Nigeria has made slow progress in reducing 
poverty. Nigeria’s official poverty line is constructed on the basis of daily adult consumption of 
3,000 calories plus estimated necessary other expenditures. Using the internationally-accepted 
adult equivalent methodology that accounts for less calories needed by children than adults, the 
poverty headcount in Nigeria declined slightly from 48 percent to 46 percent of the population 
between 2004 and 2010. The percentage of Nigerians living in extreme poverty (US$1.25 per 

Box 1: Poverty and inequality trends in Nigeria: 2010-2013 
The Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) uses the Harmonized National Living Standard Survey 
(HNLSS) to monitor progress in poverty reduction in the country.  The survey is representative at the state level. 
The most recent such survey was conducted in 2009-2010. NBS also conducts other surveys, most notably the 
LSMS-ISA, a panel survey of 5000 households which is representative at national and zonal (geopolitical) 
levels. Two rounds of the LSMS-ISA, conducted in 2010-2011 and in 2012-2013 have been completed, and a 
third round is planned. Therefore, the most recent household survey data available from Nigeria are these panel 
surveys. The poverty numbers calculated from the panel are very preliminary and are not comparable to those 
obtained from the HNLSS. And as indicated above, they are not as yet adopted by the NBS as basis for 
monitoring official poverty.   
That said, at national level, the panel shows lower levels of poverty and a declining trend between 2010 and 
2013. At zonal level, the results confirm some of the trends emerging from HNLSS analysis although absolute 
numbers are also lower. The gap between North and South is widening. Poverty was already lower in the South 
and further decreased in particular in the South South and South West zones.  In the North, the conflict-stricken 
North East experienced a substantial increase in poverty while in North Central it remains stagnant. Finally, in 
the North West poverty appears to have declined but still remains at very high levels. Meanwhile, inequality 
shows an increase countrywide.  

capita per day purchasing power parity adjusted) declined from 64 to 63 percent.  While not fully 
comparable with the 2004-2010 HNLSS surveys, the emerging trend resulting from the 2010-
2011 and 2012-2013 panel surveys is encouraging  (Box 1). 
22. As observed in many African countries, the low growth elasticity of poverty reduction 
in Nigeria reflects growing inequality. The most widely used inequality indicator, the Gini 
index, increased from 39 to 41 percent – equivalent to about 8 percent increase in inequality in 6 
years. Simulations indicate that, holding inequality constant at 2004 value, growth would have 
contributed to a poverty reduction of 5 percentage points, which would have implied a national 
poverty rate of about 43 percent (adult equivalent).3 
23. The quality of growth matters for poverty reduction. Simulations of GDP growth under 
varying assumptions about the elasticity of growth to poverty reduction in Nigeria yield 
interesting insights (Figure 1). At current growth rates and current elasticity (i.e. maintaining the 
status quo), the number of poor in Nigeria is projected to increase (continuous line). By sharing 
the growth dividend by building an infrastructure and financing platform for diversified growth 
and job creation, and improving the efficiency of social services delivery to mitigate income and 
opportunity inequities, Nigeria can alter the sensitivity of poverty to growth and significantly 
reduce the number of poor (dashed and dot plus dashed lines) and therefore avoid maintaining 
their number constant in the face of increasing population (dotted line).

24. The above is consistent with previous poverty analysis in Nigeria. The 2007 World 
Bank poverty assessment report using the 2004/2005 NLSS data concluded that “the poor in 
Nigeria, have less access – physical, financial and social – to government services, and formal 
financial institutions. The poor have lower school enrollment rates, lower utilization of health 
services, and less frequent contact with extension services for increased productivity”.

25. Limited inclusiveness also implies wide divergences in performance between 
geopolitical regions and states. Three trends emerge concerning the geographic distribution of 
the poor). In North East and West poverty rates remain very high: on average above 50 percent 
and in some cases above 70 percent with a tendency to stagnation. Second, the North Central is 
doing well in particular around Abuja. Finally, the picture in the South is more heterogeneous. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On average, this area is performing better, poverty rates are well below those in the North and 
practically all standard poverty correlates indicate the generally higher level of well-being. 
Furthermore, most of the important economic activities are located in the South and the level of 
urbanization is higher. However, mainly the South Western part, where Lagos is located, enjoys 
relatively inclusive growth which is credited with giving that region the fastest poverty reduction 
rate in the country.  

26. The divide between southern states and Abuja and the rest of the country appears to 
reflect disparities in terms of educational outcomes, health care provision and economic 
opportunities in general. As experience shows, any physical investment cannot be efficiently 
utilized and maintained without a critical mass of technical and managerial skills which can only 
accrue over a long period. Mapping the average share of past school attendance in labor force 
age provides a good snapshot of the structural divide. In southern states and Abuja more than 
60 percent of women have at least some education. The picture worsens moving towards the 
North. In all states around and above Abuja, the percentage of women with some education falls 
below 50 percent. At the extreme, in the North West fewer than 20 percent of local women have 
any sort of education.4  For men, the situation is similar but less dramatic. In some North Central 
states surrounding Abuja the percentages are similar to the South. In the North West or North 
East, however, fewer than 50 percent of men have any sort of education. These results are 
confirmed by health outcomes and various indexes in these areas. 
27. While some progress has been registered towards the MDGs, slow poverty reduction 
is reflected in Nigeria’s challenges to meet some MDGs by 2015, particularly MDGs 4 and 
5. Over the last decade the trend in health, nutrition, and population (HNP) outcomes in Nigeria 
has been mixed. Data from the last three Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHSs)5 
demonstrates a 36% decline during this period in the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and a 31% 
decline in the infant mortality rate (Table 3). However the country is still not on track to achieve 
MDG4. There has been almost no progress on reducing fertility. Childhood malnutrition has 
actually worsened by some measures (low weight for age has increased by 21% and wasting has 
increased 64%) and improved only modestly (12%) in terms of stunting (low height for age). 
This mixed picture is consistent with the limited progress in delivering key health interventions. 
There have been some improvements, such as in vaccination coverage and use of insecticide 
treated nets (ITNs), but even these rates remain low. More worrying is the stagnation at low 
levels seen in services such as family planning and the decline in other services such as skilled 
birth attendance and antenatal care, which mitigate against achieving MDG5. Further, the 
national level data hides a very mixed picture within the federation.  For example, in the 2013 
NDHS the level of stunting is 3.4 times higher in the Northwest compared to the Southeast (54.6% 
vs. 16.0% respectively).  

4 Where Has All the Growth Gone? A Poverty Update for Nigeria. WB, 2013. 
5 The use of NDHS data, collected by the National Population Commission, allows for a consistent methodology 
over time and facilitates cross-country comparisons. The data are also very recent.

28. Significant efforts have been made to reduce gender disparities but have not yet been 
reflected in the Gender Development Index (GDI) ranking (123rd out of 140 countries). The 
proportion of women in the legislature increased from 4.7 in 2005 to 7 percent in 2010, and 
many women occupy key government positions both at federal and state levels. Efforts are also 
being made to reduce gender disparities in terms of income. At the same time, pronounced 
gender disparities between regions represent a major challenge.  In North East and West, 
women tend to become mothers in their teens, at 17 to 19 years of age, compared to 19-
21 years in the Central part of the country, and above 20 years in the Coastal South. 
Programs are underway to address the large disparities in pre and post natal assistance to 
pregnant women between the Southern and the Northern states (see details below in section 
on Government Program).  
29. Regional disparities are illustrative of service delivery challenges at the sub-national 
levels.  States and local governments in Nigeria control more than half of the nation’s 
revenue and are responsible for the provision of services that directly influence growth and 
poverty and human capital development. Their autonomy, however, is largely circumscribed 
by weak technical and institutional capacities, including weak Public Financial Management 
(PFM) systems, as discussed below.   

II.D.  Key Constraints to Increasing Shared Prosperity and Accelerating 
Poverty Reduction in Nigeria  

30. The WBG analysis6 and the joint analysis with the CAF partners (Annex 8) reveals Nigeria 
as a country whose evolution of growth and poverty has been significantly influenced by its high 
dependence on oil, governance and institutional capacity, quality of infrastructure networks,

human capital (education and health), market size and wealth, the climate sensitivity of its 
economy, and the labor market’s ability to provide jobs for the rapidly growing population.  
31. Nigeria needs to diversify its production structure to reduce the vulnerability of its 
public finance and balance of payments to a fall in oil prices and/or decline in oil output. In 
recent years, oil and gas account for over 95 percent of exports, about 75 percent of consolidated 
Government revenues, and over 30 percent of GDP (at current prices). Economic diversification 
holds the potential to shift Nigeria away from its sole dependency on oil trade, a dependency that 
threatens sustainable growth and breeds debilitating corruption. Furthermore, the increasing 
exploitation and utilisation of shale gas and other alternative sources of energy by the United 
States and other advanced nations is making it more urgent for Nigeria to accelerate the 
diversification of its economy. 
32. Nigeria needs to grow much faster to create jobs and economic opportunities to 
absorb the expanding labor force. That part of GDP growth driven by the oil industry creates 
few jobs and has limited linkages to local small businesses, so other sectors must play an 
enhanced role in providing employment opportunities. The unemployment rate reached almost 
24 percent in 2011 (up from 12 percent in 2006) and youth unemployment (15-24 year cohort) is 
even more worrying at over 37 percent. Nigeria has a large cohort of youths (over 42 percent of 
citizens are below 15 years of age) and, in common with many of its African neighbors, the 
country’s population is growing and is projected to reach 230 million by 2030.7 Without gainful 
employment for new entrants to the labor market, there will be more pressure on government 
finances (higher social service spending and lower tax revenue). In contrast, if Nigeria succeeds 
in the challenge of job creation, this will help reduce poverty and promote social cohesion by 
allowing more citizens to provide for their own families and join the middle class. 
33. 
Increasing infrastructure capacity is crucial as the country strives to promote private 
sector involvement and exports. Poor infrastructure networks considerably raise business costs 
and compromise competitiveness in key domestic industries. With approximately 3,500 MW of 
total available capacity in early 2013 against an estimated demand of approximately 10,000 MW, 
Nigeria has considerable unmet demand for power, with important implications for achieving 
inclusive growth. Poor road conditions, lack and prohibitive costs for reliable internet 
connection, along with multiple administrative barriers (local taxes, fees, and inspections) 
impose huge costs and discourage investors who may consider servicing the country’s urban 
markets. 8  Strong growth and job creation in a number of Nigerian cities should increase 
migration from rural to urban areas, thereby naturally increasing the productivity of those who 
remain in agriculture. Increasing productivity in agriculture can have major implications for 
poverty reduction. Yet, without good connectivity to larger markets, farmers rely primarily on 
small family farms and local services, with limited opportunities for growth through downstream 
linkages to agribusiness. Poor people continue to be trapped in a downward spiral of low 
agricultural productivity, environmental degradation and limited access to basic services 
necessary for health and well-being.  
34. The financial sector is yet to play a stronger role in supporting inclusive growth. Lack 
of access to finance, particularly longer-term finance, impedes private sector growth and job

creation potential.9 After power, access to finance is the biggest constraint faced by firms. There 
is limited intermediation to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by the formal financial 
sector. Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) are not meeting their development objectives and 
need to be reformed in order to address specific market failures. Lending by financial institutions is 
heavily concentrated on larger corporations and their supplier value-chains.10  
35. 
Infrastructure and financing constraints contribute to low productivity. Low 
productivity activities do not pay enough to lift people out of poverty. While the majority of poor 
households are engaged in some income-generating activity, that income is not enough to lift the 
household from poverty. The majority of jobs held by Nigerians entail working on family farms 
or in very small household enterprises. Only about 10 percent of working-age Nigerians earns a 
wage or salary. With 50 percent of the population depending on agriculture for income, raising 
the productivity of small-holder farms is, therefore, a key aspect to reducing poverty11. At the 
same time, enabling small and medium-size firms to grow and hire more labor will make growth 
more inclusive.  
36. Low education and health outcomes weaken the platform for growth and poverty 
reduction. While good outcomes in nutrition, health, and education are development goals in 
themselves, they are also essential for developing the skills and abilities needed to increase 
growth and reduce poverty in the medium to longer run. Nigeria needs to increase access to and 
improve quality of human development services (skills, education, health, water, nutrition). The 
country ranked 154 out of 187 countries in the 2012 United Nations Human Development Index. 
Forty percent of children are undernourished – either because of disease or a lack for adequate 
caring practices and foods. The large number of illiterate adults (close to 22 million) and the 
large share of school-aged children out of school (26 percent of boys and 31 percent of girls)12 is 
evidence of the need to make the country’s low-skilled and unskilled labor force more 
employable.13 Basic “nutrition-specific” investments (such as vitamin and mineral supplements for 
young children and pregnant women) and practices such as exclusive breast-feeding (through 
health extension services, changes in labor laws, women’s workload reduction, etc.) can address 
the nutrition-specific issues and enhance human capability (productivity) and ultimately, 
employability.  
37. Poor governance has limited the poverty reduction and potential of safety net 
schemes to mitigate shocks.  Social protection programs in Nigeria are small, fragmented and 
focused on a narrow set of risks and target groups. Institutions implementing social protection 
programs have overlapping and unclear mandates, unclear flow of funds, and make use of 
undefined targeting mechanisms. 14 Overall, the present state of social protection programs 
cannot ensure that all members of society reap the benefits of growth, and—with few 
exceptions—doesn’t seem to buffer the economic and climatic shocks faced by the poor. 
Recognizing the challenges, in recent years, the government has sought to develop social 
protection instruments as a mechanism to tackle such high rates of poverty and vulnerability in

the country and to support progress in both the economic and the social spheres. As such, social 
protection has now become a major policy priority for the Government.  
38. Nigeria needs more effective institutions and good governance at federal and state 
levels of government to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth and mitigate violence that 
persists in some of its regions. Good governance is critical for improving the effectiveness and 
efficiency of public expenditures, and also helps to build social cohesion and confidence in 
institutions. It is also essential for enabling private sector to play its role as the main engine of 
growth and job creation.15  The experience of Nigeria shows commendable actions taken by the 
Government but significant challenges remain – both at the federal and state levels. The Federal 
Government has taken a number of steps to improve land ownership registration, fight 
intellectual property (IP) piracy and counterfeiting of goods, and improve the effective 
promotion of IP rights. The tightening of financial system regulation and supervision by the 
Central Bank of Nigeria in 2009 helped to improve the soundness of the financial system. The 
2011 Freedom of Information Act liberalized access to government documents, significantly 
enhancing the transparency. In the oil sector, the reduction of subsidies and the adoption of 
procedures to verify subsidy payments is a major achievement. On the outstanding challenges, 
dispersed policy reforms and poor implementation at federal and state levels impede the 
transparency of the regulatory framework for investment.16 Vested interests, complex patronage 
networks and traditional loyalties and affiliations have resulted in a diversion of funds away from 
intended targets and undermined the trust between citizens and the state. The poor quality of data 
and statistics and weak monitoring and evaluation systems undermine the quality of policy 
design and dialogue across all sectors and different levels of Government (Annex 5).  
39. Many governance and service delivery challenges are at the sub-national levels. 
Nigeria’s federal system provides states a significant degree of legal and de facto autonomy in 
public sector management, and with large responsibilities in delivering services.17 However, state 
autonomy is largely circumscribed by weak technical and institutional capacities and modest 
commitment to implementing reforms. For example, there has been limited progress on 
improving public financial management in order to translate revenue into efficient and equitable 
service delivery.18 It bears noting that states perform differently in delivering services: similar 
per capita expenditures in health and education lead to different outcomes, and public sector 
management efficiency is likely to play an important role. 19 A new generation of state governors 
is emerging, some of whom are engaging in public sector reform as a way to improve the quality 
of services provided. The early results from such efforts are creating new competition for 
reform-minded leadership in Nigeria.

17 Most of the powers assigned to state governments are concurrently shared with the federal and local government. 
However, states have residual powers (any subject not assigned to federal and local government level by the 
Constitution), and have large responsibilities in delivering services in agriculture, health, education, social 
protection, transport, and water and sanitation.

40. The competitive spirit of reform-minded leadership offers scope for demonstration 
effects to help spur growth, strengthen institutions, and reduce existing or possible arenas for 
violence within the country. Nigeria, like other developing countries, is examining global 
development experience and best practices with a view to adapt and embed those into its 
strategies, policies, and projects. In addition, many states within Nigeria are looking at the 
experience of Lagos state and seeking to emulate its progress. Once cited as an example of a 
failed megacity, Lagos has made strong progress in improving infrastructure and services and 
reducing poverty, and many states in Nigeria seek to learn from its experience. Clearly, 
demonstration effect holds great potential to impel federal and state authorities in Nigeria toward 
similar policies and projects in order to emulate international or domestic success.  

II.E.  Opportunities 
for Growth, 
Increasing Shared Prosperity and 
Accelerating Poverty Reduction in Nigeria 

41. With large reserves of human and natural resources, a large domestic market, a 
decade of strong economic growth, evolving democracy, and macroeconomic stability, 
Nigeria has major opportunities to accelerate development and reduce poverty. The 
growing demand for services and manufacturing associated with the emerging middle class 
and rapid urbanization 20 present huge growth opportunities for SMEs and the agricultural 
sector, benefiting from the large size of the domestic market. Globally there is a strong 
causal link between urbanization and economic development.21 Power sector reform is the 
backbone for future growth which, together with efforts to increase financial services and 
address the transportation infrastructure deficit, will effectively connect poor households as 
producers in productive markets. Millions of small farmers will have the potential to produce 
more and become part of competitive agriculture value chains, although only few are 
currently linked to markets that would provide them with the stable income necessary for 
long-term productive investment.  
42. 
ICT holds a strong potential for contributing to economic growth, jobs, productivity, 
transparency, accountability, and social inclusion. New technologies have the potential to 
raise opportunities for the middle class, and create greater domestic inclusion, with appropriate 
policies. ICT can itself reduce the cost of some of public services. E-delivery can improve 
transparency and governance as it reduces discretion and corruption. The mobile telephone is an 
example of a technology product whose falling costs made it accessible to all income classes. 
Mobile telephony has been one of India’s success stories, demonstrating the potential of ICT for 
inclusion. The Nigerian economy has already embraced e-commerce with two e-platforms fully 
functional and with the potential of leapfrogging e-trade in Nigeria in the next decade.  This 
sector is already attracting a number of young Nigerians from the diaspora. 
43. There is scope for increased growth and diversification through regional and global 
and also holds tremendous opportunities for Nigeria’s financial sector. The potential for cross‐
integration. Consolidation of the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) 
market (300 million people) will create spillover effects that will benefit all partners. ECOWAS 
offers significant growth potential for Nigeria’s agriculture sector and gas-based industries, 

20 About half the total population now lives in cities compared to 35 percent in 1990, and this share is projected to 
increase to about 65 percent by 2025.

border portfolio investments by ECOWAS institutions and individuals is high, although full 
integration is still a long way off. Nigeria still has weak links with the rest of the region.22  The 
recent decision at the October 2013 ECOWAS Summit to consolidate the common market and 
adopt the ECOWAS Common External Tariff, along with measures to simplify customs 
procedures at the border, will offer Nigeria additional opportunities to develop regionally and 
globally competitive sectors and to diversify exports through a vibrant and globally 
competitive private sector.  
44. The Convergence and Stability Pact 23 concluded among the ECOWAS Member 
States may help maximize the potential for economic growth in Nigeria with important 
ripple effects for neighboring countries. The Convergence Pact is a formal commitment by the 
ECOWAS Member States to (a) coordinate economic policy, (b) strengthen macroeconomic 
management and macroeconomic stability, and (c) consolidate monetary cooperation in the 
region. Efforts are underway to integrate the region’s three leading stock exchanges—the 
Nigerian Stock Exchange, the Bourse régionale de valeurs mobilières in Abidjan, and the Ghana 
Stock Exchange—and develop mechanisms for cross-listing and trading.  

III. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY 

45. Nigeria aims to become one of the 20 largest economies in the world by 2020. Its 
development agenda, laid out in the Vision 20:2020 document focuses on two transformational 
objectives: (a) optimizing the country’s human and natural resource potential to achieve rapid 
economic growth; and (b) translating that growth into equitable social development for all 
citizens. In this context, the outcome of the ongoing GDP rebasing exercise will offer a 
reassessment of the size and structure of the Nigerian economy, and should offer a new 
framework for informing economic policies that promote competitiveness and the future 
development of the country. 
46. The Government’s medium-term strategy for achieving these goals is articulated in 
the 2011 Transformation Agenda (TA), which aims at laying the foundation for a robust and 
inclusive growth of the Nigerian economy. The Transformation Agenda places strong emphasis 
on measures to address the constraints identified in the previous section, with special emphasis 
on creating sufficient jobs to address the protracted problems of unemployment, poverty and 
inequality, and improving and sustaining the well-being of all Nigerians regardless of their 
personal circumstances and location.24 The mid-term review of the TA presents actions already 
taken by the Government to:  address the country’s huge infrastructure constraints; broaden the 
nation’s productive base and promote private sector investment with particular emphasis on non-
oil sectors with strong job creation and multiplier potential; and improve social outcomes and 
strengthening social safety nets.25  Underpinning the TA is a fiscal reform program that seeks to 
build fiscal buffers and safeguard macroeconomic stability, reduce the deficit of the federal 
Government and the level of domestic debt, and increase capital spending, particularly for 
infrastructure where the needs are huge.

47. The mid-term progress report of the TA emphasizes improvement of governance, as 
exemplified by a number of steps taken.  The new National Sovereign Wealth Fund (NSWF), 
which was established in 2011 and is now fully operational, will likely be less vulnerable than 
the ECA to political demands for ad hoc withdrawals.26 The Government succeeded in reducing 
fuel subsidy payments by both reducing the subsidy rate and cracking down on corruption – the 
petrol subsidy program had been blighted by vested interests and massive corruption. In the 
agricultural sector, there has been progress in cutting some corruption out of the fertilizer 
subsidy scheme. The Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Program (SURE-P) was 
introduced to cushion the partial deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector and mitigate 
the immediate impact of the petroleum subsidy discontinuation, especially on the poor and 
vulnerable, and accelerate economic transformation through investments in critical infrastructure 
and social safety net projects. Efforts are being made to streamline the activities of the 
Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) with a view to reducing the financial burden and 
enable government operate more efficiently and effectively. The Treasury Single Accounting and 
the Governments Integrated Financial Management and Information System (GIFMIS) were 
introduced in 2012, representing an important step forward in increasing the efficiency of PFM. 
The transition of federal and state governments to International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards (IPSAS) has improved the consistency of government financial reporting with 
international standards.  A chip-based secure national identity card has been launched and the 
deployment of the NIMS infrastructure commenced in early 2012. The scheme is expected to 
deliver a single database system for the management of identity in Nigeria and prevent the use of 
false, multiple, duplicate, or ghost identities. The biometric payroll system (the Integrated 
Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS), piloted in 2007 in 7 MDAs, is being 
progressively rolled out across a large number of MDAs (with plans for full roll-out in 2014). 
The deployment of IPPIS is estimated to have saved the federal government millions of Naira 
due to elimination of ghost workers from the federal payroll. 
48. Continuing efforts are made to increase the internally generated revenues from the 
non-oil sector.  Tax administration reforms introduced since 2004/5 are progressively helping to 
streamline and clarify tax procedures, affording taxpayers easy payment options. Tax procedures, 
processes and forms for registration and payment, as well as the tax laws, are now available 
online on the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) website. The most notable achievement 
under tax administration in 2013 was the piloting of an Integrated Tax Administration System 
(ITAS) solution to automate and electronically tie all core tax administration modules together 
for higher efficiency. The Government is currently working with McKinsey to identify pockets 
of productivity improvement in tax administration. Great strides have also been made in the last 
few years in introducing automation and modern information technology into the operation of 
the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). The NCS has been progressively modernized and given the 
additional role of trade facilitation through the reforms. Results to date include taking over the 
Destination Inspection operations from the previous Pre-Shipment Inspection service providers, 
and setting the system for independent monitoring of NCS revenue collection and operational 
performance, for example. The ongoing reforms in the NCS will help improve the transparency

country against external shocks. An infrastructure fund will make direct investments to improve transport and power 
networks, while a third, the Future Generations Fund, will invest in a broader portfolio of international assets, with 
the aim of preserving and growing the country’s cash reserves.

of fees paid for services rendered, will enhance regional and continental trade, and are also 
expected to help boost security in the country.   
49. Progress is being made in expanding financial markets and increasing credit access to 
non-oil sectors with strong job creation and multiplier potential. One of key strategic 
orientations of the Government is to secure economic diversification and promote job creation by 
improving financial markets and increasing credit access to productive sectors of the economy. 
In the housing sector, for example, the Government has partnered with the private sector to 
increase the supply of longer-term financing to enable better access to mortgages. This will create a 
more liquid property market in lower income segments of the population and encourage private 
investment in housing and construction.  In addition, the Central Bank has developed a financial 
inclusion strategy that aims to increase access to finance for SMEs and the largely underserved 
rural areas. The strategy includes extending agent banking and mobile banking, as well as reform 
of the development finance framework for Nigeria.  
50. The Government is making strong efforts to promote SME development and 
creation. The national policy on micro, small and medium enterprises has been revised and has 
led to the recent launch of the National Enterprise Development Program for MSME 
development (NEDEP), which restructures the institutional framework for SME support. 
Furthermore, several programs have been launched to support entrepreneurship and enterprise 
creation in Nigeria. For example, the Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria (YouWiN) is 
an annual business plan competition supporting promising entrepreneurial young individuals to 
develop and execute business ideas that will lead to jobs creation. The program attracted 50,000 
aspiring entrepreneurs in the first year, and over 100,000 in the second year. The program has 
trained 6,000 entrepreneurs so far, provided grants to about 50 percent of the entrepreneurs 
trained, and is set to contribute to 80,000 jobs over its period.   
51. 
In view of achieving diversification and stronger job creation, focus is especially 
placed on agriculture and manufacturing as major drivers of growth and exports. The 
agriculture sector reform aims to increase productivity, but also trade and investment 
linkages and expanding value addition to locally-produced agricultural products. Successful 
reform in this sector is expected to create over 3.5 million jobs by 2015. 27  Within the 
manufacturing sector, the TA targets petrochemicals, chemicals, food, textiles, metals, and 
non-metal minerals, and adopts a cluster-based approach (geographic distribution of these 
key priorities across six main regions of the country). Increasing the downstream linkages of 
agriculture and manufacturing with wholesale and retail trade would potentially allow the 
country to generate more jobs locally and to retain more value added.  These efforts have 
been crystallized in the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) recently launched by the 
President as well. The results of the agricultural sector reform are already visible, as 
exemplified by some corruption cut out of the fertilizer subsidy system and by increased food 
production.  Progress in the manufacturing sector has been constrained by multiple 
challenges, including poor power supply, high cost of inputs and of doing business, multiple 
taxation, infrastructural deficit, low access to finance (particularly long-term finance) and 
weak and poor information flow. The stronger implementation of the power sector reform 
will have a significantly positive effect on manufacturing in Nigeria. Increasing FDI inflows

in manufacturing and services, 24.3 percent and 12.2 percent in 2011 respectively, are 
encouraging signs for non-oil investment and future growth.  
52. Reducing infrastructure bottlenecks is one of the key elements of the Government’s 
agenda. The National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan (NIIMP) is being developed to 
promote a coordinated approach to infrastructure development in the country. This is a 30-year 
plan to be implemented using 10-year operational plans and 5-year medium-term plans. It is 
estimated that Nigeria needs approximately US$350 billion over the period 2011-2020 to close 
the infrastructure gap.28  The limited fiscal space in the public budget, however, constrains the 
Government’s ability to rely solely on public funding for productivity-enhancing investments.29 
Tackling Nigeria’s infrastructure bottlenecks thus requires both public funds and effective 
leveraging of private sector resources. Accordingly, there has been increasing momentum 
towards developing infrastructure projects through public-private partnerships (PPPs), including 
for developing the vitally important gas-to-power infrastructure. Gas-to-power infrastructure is 
vital for meeting the domestic demand for power as well as for developing regional exports.  In 
the transport sector, the Government’s endeavors to rehabilitate roads across the country have led 
to improved conditions of key road corridors (including about 600 km of roads under Bank-
supported projects) and to launching road safety initiatives to tackle the high rate of road traffic 
crashes and fatalities in Nigeria. The Government is also using the Subsidy Reinvestment 
Program (SURE-P) to accelerate the rehabilitation of key road links totaling more than 1,600km, 
such as Abuja-Abaji-Lokoja, Benin-Ore-Sagamu, Onitsha-Enugu-Port Harcourt, Kaduna-
Maiduguri, and East-West Road. As for air transport infrastructure, over 20 airports have been 
earmarked for rehabilitation and reconstruction, and funding has been approved for the 
construction of five new airport terminals. To fully reap the benefits from investment in air 
transport infrastructure, authorities need to continue strengthening the capacity of air transport 
regulatory bodies and infrastructure providers.   Addressing Nigeria’s transport connectivity 
problems can also benefit from well-performing railways. After many years of decay, attempts 
are being made to revive the existing Lagos-Kano railway corridor.  In parallel, authorities are 
investing in the rehabilitation of railway lines and are seeking to open new railway corridors with 
a view of concessioning those to potential investors. Transport infrastructure challenges are 
huge. The authorities need to focus more on strengthening the governance of the sector through 
better strategic planning and enhanced managerial, institutional, and technical capabilities in 
various transport modal institutions and entities. An integrated multi-modal approach, including 
multi-model spatial planning, is needed to prioritize projects, to optimize allocation of resources, 
and to take advantage of growth corridors and increasing urbanization over the medium term. 
53. Significant headway has been made in the power sector which has the highest 
potential to propel the economy to the desired level of growth and development. Nigeria’s 
power sector reform program is one of the most comprehensive and complex ever undertaken 
in Africa. The program: (a) establishes an independent regulator for the sector, the Nigerian 
Electricity Regulatory Commission; (b) sets up a commercial framework for the sector, with 
cost-reflective electricity tariffs; (c) establishes a bulk trader; (d) privatizes the Power Holding 
Company of Nigeria’s (PHCN) six successor generation companies; (e) privatizes the eleven 
PHCN successor distribution companies; and (f) continues efforts to strengthen the gas-to-

power segment. Significant progress has been achieved in all these areas, which has already 
led to tangible improvements in available supply, increased grid stability, increased revenue 
collection, and the introduction of a cost-reflective, multi-year tariff. On 30 September 2013 
the share certificates of 15 state-run electricity distribution and generation companies were 
handed over to a consortium of domestic and foreign investors, marking a major milestone in 
the power sector’s privatization process. The reform program also improved governance 
mechanisms and oversight by clarifying roles and responsibilities of key sector institutions to 
improve the transparency, accountability, corporate governance, and general oversight of the 
sector. As distribution underpins the fundamental soundness of the sector, the success of the 
reform will be largely determined by the capacity of the private operators to transform the 
newly-privatized distribution companies, which will in turn help attract additional investment 
in generation and transmission. 
54. Alongside the economic objectives, the Transformation Agenda pursues social 
objectives. Recognizing the need for addressing social challenges, the Government has decided 
to redirect savings from the reduced oil subsidy through to investing in the SURE-P, expanding 
its interventions in health, education and social safety nets. The total subsidy savings for the 
Federal, state and local governments is N816 billion ($5 billion) from February 2012 (inception 
of SURE-P) to December 2013. More than 50% of the Federal portion was deployed to social 
sector/safety net interventions (Public works, CCT-MCH, Vocational Training, Graduate 
Internship Scheme, etc.).  Nigeria budgeted N273.52 billion (US$1.7 billion) for SURE-P in 
2013, and another N268 billion ($1.67 billion) is planned in 2014 (including a balance of 88.4 
billion naira carried over from the previous year). Social safety nets are being set up along with a 
minimum wage and other initiatives to improve access to housing and financing through micro-
credit. In the education sector, the TA aims to improve access and quality, infrastructure, funding 
and planning, as embodied in a new four-year strategy adopted by the Federal Ministry of 
Education (FMOE) 30 with the overarching objectives of providing access to education with 
equity, quality, and relevant skills for the labor market. In the health sector, there have been 
achievements in strengthening the institutions needed for progress. At the federal level, 
important steps include the development of a National Strategic Health Development Plan, 
creation of a coordination template for accountability and tracking of resources in response to the 
International Health Partnership (IHP+), the establishment of a central coordination mechanism 
for data management in the health sector, the rehabilitation of the Nigeria Health Insurance 
Scheme (NHIS), and increased investment in data and surveys (including the MDGs survey of 
2012). In parallel, an accountability framework for improving immunization coverage on polio 
was developed with the involvement of the Governors, reinforced by the Polio Task Force which 
was inaugurated by the President of the Republic.  To bolster the attention paid to primary health 
care at state level, a large number of states have established, or are in the process of establishing, 
state primary health care development agencies.  These agencies have responsibility for 
strengthening the delivery of basic services particularly in rural areas where publicly provided 
services predominate. The Saving One Million Lives (SOML) initiative is taking a results-based 
approach to:  (a) strengthening basic health services – particularly in rural areas, with the goal of 
preventing deaths of mothers and children; (b) improving clinical governance across all care 
levels; (c) strengthening primary and secondary prevention care; and (d) creating an enabling 
environment for private sector involvement in health services and commodities. A number of

new initiatives were launched, such as support for the Midwives Service Scheme, Village Health 
Workers Program, roll out of the Community-based Social Health Insurance Scheme, the 
Community Health Extension workers, and support for 
immunization and 
lifesaving 
commodities for women and children.  Over 9,000 health care workers were recruited to provide 
quality ante-natal, skilled birth delivery and post-natal services for underserved, poor women in 
rural areas.      
55. Efforts are being made to enhance the climate resilience of the country’s development 
agenda. Aware of the country’s high vulnerability to climate change, the Government is in the 
process of finalizing a National Climate Change Policy and Response Strategy (NPCC-RS).31  In 
parallel, the National Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action for Climate Change in Nigeria 
(NASPA-CNN) are also being finalized. These will provide a guide for the integration of climate 
change adaptation goals into government policies, strategies and programs. Concerning 
agriculture in particular, the NPCC-RS calls for the “development of an integrated agricultural 
intervention plan to reduce the sector’s vulnerability to climate change and enhance its 
productivity for food security and poverty reduction.”  A high-level advisory committee on 
agriculture resilience in Nigeria (ACARN) has been established to provide scientific support to 
this effort. Finally, the Government has been working with other African countries to establish 
African Risk Capacity (ARC), a groundbreaking extreme weather insurance mechanism 
designed to help African Union member states resist and recover from the ravages of drought. 
ARC is an African solution to one of the continent’s most pressing challenges, transferring the 
burden of climate risk away from governments – and the farmers and pastoralists whom they 
protect – to the ARC that can handle that risk much better. 
56. The water sector recently witnessed a resurgence of activities. The rapid and uneven 
expansion of many Nigeria’s cities is putting pressure on water and sanitation services, leading 
to increased efforts to improve the quality and coverage of those services.32  A Water Summit, 
organized under the leadership of the President of Nigeria, focused on ways to identify 
innovative financing options in the sector where the needs are significant. In addition, the dam 
projects which were hitherto abandoned have now been reactivated and are now at various stages 
of rehabilitation for supply of bulk water to treatment plants, generation of hydro-electricity, 
provision of water for irrigation farming and fisheries to boost food security. Furthermore, 
efforts are underway to modernize the institutional framework of the water utilities to give them 
more autonomy and allow them to improve access, reliability, financial viability, and sector 
governance more broadly.  
57. 
Increased women’s representation in government, gender budgeting requirements in 
selected ministries, and gender-sensitive programs should aid in the fight for more access 
and inclusion. Women’s representation in government has increased with the appointment of 13 
female Ministers out of 42, increasing the cabinet posts for women from 16 percent in the 2004 
administration to 33 under the current government. 33 The ministries of Agriculture, 
Communications, Health, Water Resources and Works are allocating budget resources to support 
programs for women, and have to that end signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Federal 

31 Approved by the Federal Executive Council in September 2012. 
32 The priority was reaffirmed during February 2013 Water Summit, which re-established the consensus among the 
federal and state governments and partners on the need to act promptly and jointly to improve water service delivery

Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs. This initiative, tagged Growing 
Girls and Women in Nigeria (G-WIN), was piloted under the 2013 federal budget in these five 
Ministries/sectors and is continuing in 2014 with plans to mainstream across all sectors in the 
future. The Maternal and Child Health Care program (implemented as part of the SURE-P) and 
the second round of the Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria program are targeting 
women in health, education and entrepreneurship and business opportunities.  
58. The Government has made notable progress in advancing ICT agenda in Nigeria. It 
developed the ICT Policy and the National Broadband Development Plan for 2013-2018, and is 
currently preparing the e-Government Strategy. The Federal eGovernment Services Portal was 
launched to drive efficiency and service delivery by institutionalizing a Government-wide 
messaging system and establishing Federal Government ICT Cadres and Council of ICT Heads. 
Efforts are also being made to nurture ICT incubation and accelerator centers (iDEA and 
Techlaunchpad), in addition to launching initiatives such as “Federal Open Data”, “NaijaCloud 
microworks” and “Girls in ICT”, all with the aim of IT industry development and job creation.   

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
IV.A. Lessons 
from CPS Completion Report, IEG Evaluation and 
Stakeholder Consultations 

59. The key lessons from the CPS FY2010-2013 Completion Report (Annex 7) that underpin 
the design of the new CPS include the need to: (a) better understand the political economy of 
various levels of government, and ensure that all activities are assessed from a governance 
perspective, with  a focus on strengthening institutions and policy frameworks rather than funding 
inputs; (b) deepen the Bank’s engagement at the state level in recognition of the strong role played by 
states in economic and social development of the country; and (c) balance federal and state reform 
efforts to enhance and ensure the sustainability of development outcomes.  
Highlights of CPS Completion Report 
Overall progress toward achieving the CPS outcomes is rated moderately satisfactory. 
Results for Pillar 1 Achieving Sustainable and Inclusive Non Growth were partially achieved: 
Activities supported transformational reforms, particularly in the agriculture and energy sectors 
where technical support and policy dialogue helped generate broad consensus on and momentum 
for the reform agenda. Planned improvement in business environment was less successful mainly 
due to the late start of the main instrument, the Growth and Employment in Markets, and a 
shortcoming in the design which covered the entire country whereas Bank’s interventions 
focused on selected states. 
Results for Pillar 2 Sustainable Human Development were partially achieved. Significant 
progress was achieved in improving health sector development, community development and 
post-basic education outcomes. This period also helped to lay the foundation for results-based 
activities, implemented under this new CPS period. 
Results for Pillar 3 Governance for Results were fully achieved. The governance pillar, a core 
aspect of the program, also demonstrated remarkable achievement towards expected outcomes, 
considering the strengthening of Public Financial Management (PFM) systems, improved 
integrity in payroll and personnel control mechanisms in the civil service. Notwithstanding, 
scaling up governance reforms remains a priority for this CPS.  

20 

 
60. The new CPS also incorporates key lessons from IEG validation of previous CPSs. 
These include the need to: (a) ensure that economic and sector work is accompanied by sustained 
dissemination and dialogue with Government; (b) forge better links with state ministries and 
local Governments, and (c) continuously monitor macroeconomic developments and maintain 
the dialogue with the federal and state Governments on fiscal discipline. 
61. The Nigeria Country Survey 2013 and the CPS consultations with Government, civil 
society, think tanks, and the private sector suggest that the Bank’s processes, procedures, and 
instruments will have to be more adaptable, context-specific and responsive to clients’ needs. By 
broadening strategic collaboration with key partners and stakeholders in the country, the WBG 
can help generate broader consensus for reform.  

IV.B. Overview of World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy 

62. The overarching objective of the CPS FY2014-FY2017 
is to support the 
Transformation Agenda’s goals of laying the foundation for socially and regionally 
inclusive economic growth. Based on the country diagnosis, strong level of demand by federal 
and state authorities, and the comparative advantage of the WBG, the CPS organizes the Bank’s 
interventions around three strategic clusters with concerted efforts to strike the right balance 
between actions to strengthen the enabling environment and direct interventions:  

a) The federally-led structural reform agendas for growth and jobs. The agendas seek 
to foster diversified growth and job creation by addressing the two key constraints 
(power and access to finance) and target agriculture as a means for improving living 
conditions in rural areas. WBG support focuses on: (a) increasing installed power 
generation and transmission capacity and improving the efficiency and governance of 
electricity delivery; (b) increasing supply of long-term financing for the housing 
sector, expanding financing opportunities for SMEs, and strengthening the ability of 
state-owned Development Finance Institutions to mobilize private finance for key 
sectors of the economy; and (c) boosting agricultural productivity, improving 
farmers’ linkages with agro-processors, and scaling up Nigeria’s resilience to current 
and future climate variability. 

b) The quality and efficiency of social service delivery at state level for greater social 
inclusion. WBG support will focus on developing more effective mechanisms for 
social service delivery (social protection programs, education, health, and water 
services delivery) to help address inequities in income and opportunities.  

c) Governance and public sector management. The WBG program aims at strengthening 
accountability and public expenditure and investment management. Considerable 
savings could be realized from public sector efficiency gains and reallocated towards 
the objective of inclusive growth. The CPS integrates gender, equity and conflict 
sensitivity as essential elements of governance.  

21 

 
 
 
 
 
63. The WBG has strong comparative advantages in each of these strategic areas. The 
Bank has been the main interlocutor for the Government on power development for the past 10-
15 years and this is an area where the WBG products and expertise play a critical role in 
leveraging private investment in the power sector. The WBG broad financial expertise and global 
knowledge will also help to leverage local, regional and international financial markets for 
financing for development. Building on its successful long engagement with the government on 
community-driven approaches to increasing income and productivity of farmers, the WBG will 
continue to bring to bear its global experience and knowledge on agricultural productivity, 
agriculture value chain development, and climate adaptation and mitigation measures. In social 
services, the Bank will continue to be a main interlocutor with the authorities on social safety 
nets, water sector reform, and a results-based approach to delivery of education and health 
services. As a foundational principle, all of these efforts will be underpinned by the Bank’s 
strong engagement on governance and public finance management at state and federal levels. 
This is also an area where IDA is increasingly leveraging support from other partners.  
64. These three strategic clusters are already embedded in the existing portfolio and will 
be reinforced through new lending and non-lending support. The current IDA portfolio (end-
February 2014) consists of 23 active IDA projects (US$4,920 million), 2 regional IDA 
operations (US$180 million), 4 GEF projects (US$26.2 million), and 68 active trust funds 
(US$198.2 million). The current IFC and MIGA exposure is $1.13bn and $14.5m, respectively. 
The WB’s portfolio is well-aligned with the Government’s strategy. It includes eight lending 
operations in infrastructure (electricity, rural roads, urban transport, water, and PPP), eight in 
social sectors (education, health, social protection, including youth public workfare programs), 
one in natural resource management (mitigating land degradation), five in sources of growth 
(agriculture, housing finance, ICT, and light manufacturing), and three in public sector (PFM and 
public sector management).  

22 

 
Box 2: The CPS approach to Northern Nigeria 

The key elements of the CPS approach to Northern Nigeria include:  
 Recognition of the critical importance of understanding of cultural and institutional specificities of the 
region and its political economy, including the drivers of conflict and fragility. The Bank’s governance 
work (Annex 6) will provide critical tools and inputs to understanding the drivers of conflict.  
 Emphasis on engagement at the state and community levels, with some exploratory capacity building 
activities in education and PFM at the local government level in a limited number of states. 
 Emphasis on collaboration with CAF partners in supporting the efforts of federal and state authorities in 
Northern Nigeria to: (a) increase routine immunization in the North, where rates of immunization are 
particularly low;  and (b) increase access to primary and secondary education, recognizing the 
comparative advantage of DFID and USAID in this area. Within the context of the CAF, the Bank will 
continue to deepen its collaboration and dialogue with partners and federal and state authorities on 
support to Northern Nigeria.  
 Emphasis on broadening the Bank’s strategic collaboration with stakeholders from the North of Nigeria. 
The Bank has initiated dialogue with the group of Northern governors (Northern Governors TA) to 
respond to their request for advisory support to develop a strategic framework for accelerated socio-
economic development in the North, and is working on a special initiative for the North East states under 
state of emergency. 
 Flexibility in adjusting the CPS program to the evolving security situation, and within the overall 
framework of support of the CAF partners to Northern Nigeria. The CPS will maintain a cautious but 
scalable approach that takes advantage of any expanding window of opportunity, drawing, as appropriate, 
on a range of specialized instruments that could provide the level of scalability and flexibility necessary 
in what is likely to continue to be a rapidly-changing situation.  
The lending support to states in the North aims to: (a) increase infrastructure stock (roads and irrigation) in areas 
with high agriculture potential and improve their connectivity with markets; (b) improve the employability of 
labor force by increasing the capacity of training institutions to meet the demand for technical skills, and by 
increasing access to and quality of primary education; (c) improve social protection programs and livelihood 
opportunities for poor households; (d) increase access to and quality of health services; (e) strengthen the 
capacity for reform of water utilities; (f) strengthen the capacity for enhanced climate change resilience; and (g) 
improve PFM. In each of these areas, the CPS will seek to increase transparency and promote social 
accountability – both of which are considered important for reducing arenas for violence. The EU-funded 
SLOGOR operation will support public financial management reforms in the states of Kano, Jigawa and Yobe 
while an IDA operation will support similar reforms in Adamawa, Kebbi and four other Northern states. 

65. The diagnostic work planned in FY2014-2015 will provide the strategic platform for 
further selective support, and for engaging with the Government. The CPS will develop a 
strong knowledge platform to underpin the dialogue on poverty, jobs, inclusive finance and 
markets, education/skills, safety nets, and urbanization issues. Importantly, this knowledge work 
will help initiate WBG’s strategic engagement on urbanization and socio-economic development 
in the North (Box 2), where it will also help guide the design and implementation of the CPS 
program by providing a more thorough understanding of how specific operations may contribute 
to reducing conflict arenas and to enhancing inclusiveness. The CPS mid-term review will offer 
an opportunity to reassess the program and fully define the FY16-17 lending program in 
consultation with the new Government.  
66. The emphasis on demonstrational and catalytic interventions is reflected in the CPS 
results matrix (Annex 1). The majority of results are expected to be generated by demonstration 
operations whose impact will maximized over time, beyond this CPS period, through knowledge 
sharing and scaling up. To that end, a state-level platform will be developed to facilitate 
knowledge exchange among states in the areas of capacity building, project implementation, 
impact evaluation, and beneficiary feedback to strengthen policy and project design and 

23 

 
 
execution. The platform will help in strengthening the capacity of states from all geopolitical 
zones in the country, and is expected to help promote the emulation of successful experiences 
and practices. 

The CPS Principles of Engagement: 
 Selectivity is driven by (1) the country diagnostic work, level of demand from federal and state authorities, 
and WBG comparative advantage, (2) emphasis on maximizing the CPS impact in the context where WBG 
financial resources are small compared to the country’s own resources, and (3) potential for impact through 
support of reform-minded leadership.  
 Tailoring to Context: Understanding the political, cultural and social context within which interventions 
take place so that best practices can be appropriately adapted to their environment. A Governance, Gender 
and Conflict filter will be rolled out to ensure new products have sufficiently understood the local context, 
opportunities and risks. Guide the design and implementation of the program thorough understanding of the 
concrete factors that may drive violence and how specific operation may contribute to reducing conflict 
arenas and to enhancing inclusiveness.  
 State level lending support will be guided by (a) satisfactory portfolio performance (overall disbursement 
delay not greater than 6 months and satisfactory fiduciary and safeguards performance), (b) demand for 
support and commitment to reforms, including participating in financing, (c) state interest to participate in 
the planned governance benchmarking pilot, and (d) the availability of information on public expenditure 
and budget execution. 
 Leverage for results: Leverage government programs, and promote results-based lending, which will 
provide greater opportunity to influence the way the state governments spend their own resources and to 
strengthen their capacity to achieve and sustain results. Leverage private resources and promote private 
investment, giving priority to transformative projects and programs.  Facilitate knowledge exchange among 
states through a state-level platform, helping to build/strengthen the capacity of states from all geopolitical 
zones in the country. The Bank will also continue to pursue an open engagement with Nigerian civil society 
and think tanks on critical questions for the country’s development through its sector work, including the 
regular release of the Nigeria Economic report, workshops and forums.  

67. The CPS consolidates and deepens the WBG’s engagement at state level. Under the 
federal system of government, states and local governments control a large share of public 
expenditures and have direct responsibility for delivering many social and other services to 
poverty reduction and promoting diversified growth. The federal government has always been 
keen to ensure that the WBG's portfolio is distributed across the 6 geographical regions of the 
country more or less equitably, in order to maintain some unity. This is a strong factor in 
Nigeria's political economy and will continue to influence the distribution of the WBG program. 
Within this setting, the WBG’s lending support will be guided by each state’s: (a) satisfactory 
portfolio performance (overall disbursement delay not greater than 6 months and satisfactory 
fiduciary and safeguards performance); (b) demand for support and commitment to reforms; (c) 
willingness to participate in the planned governance benchmarking pilot; and (d) the availability 
of information on public expenditure and budget execution. 

IV.C. Engagement Areas Supported by Lending and Non-Lending Activities 
First Strategic Cluster: Federally Led Structural Reforms for Growth and Jobs 

68. Given the evidence that diversified growth and job creation have an important 
impact on poverty reduction, the CPS will support private sector-led diversified growth 
and job creation. The bulk of the financing program will focus on: (a) increasing installed 
power generation and transmission capacity and improving the efficiency and governance of 

24 

 
 
electricity delivery; (b) boosting agricultural productivity, improving farmers’ linkages with 
agro-processors, and scaling up Nigeria’s resilience to current and future climate variability; and 
(c) increasing access to finance, including long-term financing, for key sectors such as housing, 
SMEs, agriculture, and infrastructure, through various mechanisms involving both private sector 
and PPPs, and potentially through a state-owned wholesale financing mechanism. The WBG’s 
approach under this strategic cluster is to maximize the impact of the CPS by:  (a) strengthening 
linkages among mutually reinforcing agendas (e.g. rural roads, agriculture, irrigation); (b) 
promoting synergy among programs and projects implemented by different levels of 
government, including through spatial analysis; and (c) maximizing the synergies between the 
WB, IFC and MIGA, particularly as regards leveraging additional resources and providing a 
basis for stronger private sector investment. MIGA’s products, which include both its traditional 
political risk insurance coverage against transfer and convertibility restrictions, expropriation, 
breach of contract and war and civil disturbance as well as the Agency's new non-honoring of 
financial obligations cover aimed at enhancing credit and increasing access to commercial 
financing, can help leverage cross-border investment, in particular for critical infrastructure, such 
as power, water and transportation. During the CPS period, MIGA will actively seek to deepen 
its engagement in Nigeria through additional business development efforts in the infrastructure, 
manufacturing and agribusiness sectors, in addition to its already strong engagement in the 
energy sector. MIGA will also engage with Nigerian outward investors in support of their 
projects in Africa and elsewhere.  
69. The three areas of focus under the First Strategic Cluster are discussed in details below: 

POWER GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION CAPACITY, AND EFFICIENCY OF POWER SUPPLY 
TO CONSUMERS 

CPS outcome 
Increase power generation and transmission 
capacity 
Improve the efficiency of electricity delivery 

Outcome indicators 
 16 percent increase in generation capacity  
 8% increase in transmission capacity. 
 8% reduction in the aggregate technical and 
commercial losses of privatized DISCOs 
supported by the WBG EBP. 
Improve access to modern lighting for the base 
 1 million solar lanterns distributed 
of the pyramid through supporting the value 
 5 million people with improved energy 
chain of procuring and distributing solar 
services  
products such as lanterns and cook-stoves 
 100,000 tCO2 being GHG avoided. 
70. Establishing an effective power supply in Nigeria will enable households to make social 
and productive investments that will improve their livelihoods, and enable firms to increase 
productivity and be more competitive. The Government has embarked on an ambitious energy 
sector reform process that is resulting in tangible improvements in energy services. The reform 
program also improved governance mechanisms and oversight by clarifying roles and 
responsibilities of key sector institutions to improve the transparency, accountability, corporate 
governance, and general oversight of the sector. While a strong institutional structure is now in 
place, many of these institutions are new, and until viability of new arrangements is proven, the 
risk perception of private investors will remain high.  

25 

 
71. The WBG will assist the Government in increasing installed power generation and 
transmission capacity, and improving the efficiency and governance of electricity delivery. 
The Bank is providing ongoing support through the IDA Nigeria Electricity and Gas 
Improvement Project (NEGIP), focusing on core transmission and distribution investments and 
capacity building needed to deliver the increased power supply expected from the 10 NIPP 
power plants. NEGIP is also providing partial risk guarantees for gas producers entering into 
long term supply agreements with state owned or recently privatized power plants to improve the 
credit worthiness of these transactions, thus providing the comfort necessary for much needed 
upstream gas infrastructure investment. The Joint World Bank Group "Energy Business Plan" 
(EBP) (Box 3) will support the privatization process, delivery of an initial group of Independent 
Power Producer (IPP) projects, strengthening the transmission backbone, as well as preparation 
of a future portfolio of renewable energy, access and domestic gas supply projects. The newly-
created public trading company (Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trader, NBET) will increase the 
quality and transparency of transactions and ensure compliance with best practice procedures 
including internationally accepted IFC performance standards. The mobilized private investment 
will increase installed power generation capacity and improve the efficiency of electricity 
delivery, helping to spur economic growth and increase shared prosperity. Specific focus will be 
put on the Northern states facing dire power deficit in the absence of proximate power generation 
sources (the bulk of power is generated in the Nigeria’s gas-rich south), and insufficient 
transmission capacity to deliver the limited quantities they receive. MIGA has a number of 
projects in its pipeline in the power and gas sectors which are in line with the objectives of the 
NEGIP project and the joint EBP. By leveraging private sector financing, WBG support will 
ensure transparency and a fair deal for consumers while reducing the need for additional public 
spending on power generation and distribution, enabling more public funds to be deployed to 
address other infrastructure and social needs identified in Vision 20:2020. 

Box 3: The Joint Bank Group Energy Business Plan for Nigeria (EBP) 
The power sector reform in Nigeria encompasses the entire power sector value chain – from upstream 
gas development, through generation and transmission, to distribution and end-user tariffs. It is more 
comprehensive and ambitious than any power sector reform undertaken so far in Africa.  
The Energy Business plan aims to accelerate implementation of the Power Sector Reform Roadmap by 
leveraging WBG products and expertise to attract private investment in new generation capacity. Joint 
solutions by IBRD/IDA, IFC and MIGA for the first set of IPPs/GENCOs/DISCOs under the reforms 
are expected to have a measurable impact on the sector. The fast-tracking of key projects to financial 
closure will enable the power sector to attract some of the most experienced and capable private sector 
investors while removing duplicative due diligence steps across WBG, making it easier to do business 
and deliver results. The targeted transactions may benefit from a mix of different types of IBRD partial 
risk guarantee support (credit enhancement, debt mobilization, regulatory) as well as the joint WBG 
support (IFC equity and lending participation and MIGA guarantees) where justified, and where there is 
no duplication of WBG coverage.  
While IBRD has taken a lead role on the overall sector dialogue, due diligence with regard to the power 
sector reform program, and the power sector’s financial situation and prospects, IFC is playing a 
leading role on lender coordination and investor due diligence. MIGA's value added is expected to be 
credit enhancement through termination guarantees, regulatory risk and other investment guarantees 
paired with vast knowledge and experience in developing political risk insurance instruments for power 
and gas sectors in other countries with similar types of reform. 

26 

 
 
72. An increased supply is expected to provide a sustainable base for future access 
expansion to the 65 percent of Nigeria's population that lack access to electricity services. 
IDA and IBRD investments through NEGIP and the Nigeria Electricity Transmission and Access 
Project are expected to add significant transmission capacity to the national grid over the 
medium term, allowing the increased power generated from new NIPP and IPP projects due to 
come online between 2014-2017 to reach consumers in Nigeria's urban growth centers as well as 
in the under-supplied North. Increased supply is expected to improve the commercial viability 
and quality of service of distribution companies, leading to considerable cost savings for 
connected households and SMEs and reducing their dependency on self-generation. Increased 
supply will also provide a sustainable base for future expansion to the 65 percent of Nigeria's 
population that lack access to electricity services. Due to the weak financial, technical and 
operational position of Nigeria's distribution companies, large-scale access expansion to rural 
areas is not expected to be achieved within the CPS period. However, the expected improvement 
of utility service levels and commercial viability represent critical milestones to expanding 
access in the medium to long term.

73. One percent increase in agricultural productivity will decrease a person’s likelihood 
of being poor by between 2 to 3 percent. 34 The agriculture sector employs half of the 
workforce, providing livelihood for about 90 percent of the rural population. The agricultural 
sector was leading contributor to GDP in 2011, accounting for 31 percent. Within agriculture, a 
major driver of growth is staple food crops (35.8 percent of the agricultural GDP in 2011).35 As

the majority of small farmers in Nigeria grow staples, broad based productivity gains in staples 
will have a far reaching impact on the rural poor, including women, who account for 60-79 
percent of the rural labor force.36 Yet, access to the necessary productivity enhancing inputs is 
limited, due to the  inadequate investment in agricultural research and development, limited 
private investment in developing improved seeds and fertilizers, the insufficient availability of 
improved technologies to farmers, use of various ICT enhanced tools, as well as lack of 
knowledge about their use. Value chains remain underdeveloped due to poor infrastructure, a 
lack of finance for agriculture, and a dearth of market information. Significant deficiencies in 
large-scale dam and irrigation infrastructure negatively impact agricultural productivity, notably 
in the North where the bulk of Nigeria’s dam and irrigation infrastructure is located. Lack of 
access to markets, including through various ICT enabled mechanisms, is a key determinant of 
rural poverty and low agricultural productivity. In 2007, it was estimated that less than half of the 
rural population lived within 2 km of an all-weather road,37 and less than 10-15 percent of the 
country’s state and rural roads are in good or fair condition. 38 Deteriorated infrastructure 
increases transport costs for farmers and agro-business, which in turn lowers their productivity. It 
also affects human capital, as poor households can neither send their children to local schools nor 
access social services provided in health or community centers.  
74. Agricultural productivity is sensitive to climate and land degradation. Climate change 
is likely to exacerbate Nigeria’s current vulnerability to weather variability, leading to a longer-
term reduction in crop yields of up to 20-30 percent; declining productivity of livestock with 
adverse consequences on livelihoods, and worsening prospects for food security, particularly in 
the north and south-west, among others.39  Land degradation accounts for between 1.7 and 6.4 
percent of GDP,40 and is accelerating in the South-East and the arid and semi-arid North.  
75. The WBG will support the agriculture and climate change (resilience) reform agenda 
and its implementation through the federated structure. The ongoing Programmatic 
Agriculture DPO, Fadama 3, Commercial Agriculture Development Project (CADP), Nigeria 
Erosion Management and Watershed Management Project (NEMWAP), Rural Access and 
Mobility Projects 1 and 2 (RAMP 1 and 2), and the planned Irrigation Project, Staple Crop 
Processing Zone Project (SCPZ), and Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Operation 
(DRM-CC) are all instruments that focus on strengthening agricultural productivity and 
enhancing climate resilience, with benefits accruing to the rural population and other 
communities exposed to weather and climate shocks. Key measures include: (a) improving 
farmer’s access to fertilizers, seeds, and extension services; (b) improving farmers’ linkages in 
selected staple value chains in order to help reduce their transaction costs of accessing inputs or 
distributing outputs, thus enhancing their competitiveness; (c) improving farmers’ access to rural 
infrastructure (roads and irrigation, with increasing focus on the North where the bulk of 
Nigeria’s largest dams and irrigated cropped area are located); (d) reducing immediate and long-
term climate risks to rural livelihoods by treating and reversing land degradation, supporting 
climate smart agriculture, water catchment management, reducing deforestation and forest 
degradation and fostering reforestation, and enhancing capacity to prevent and manage climate-

related disasters including through more efficient hydro-meteorological systems and innovative 
finance to respond to shocks.  Building on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of gender and 
agriculture in Nigeria, projects supported by the Bank in this area increasingly target women as 
beneficiaries, in addition to tracking the share of women in the total direct beneficiaries. 
Recognizing the increasing vulnerability of Nigeria’s urban settlements to floods which tend to 
hit the urban poor and vulnerable particularly hard, the CPS support may include support to 
improving resilience of urban centers to natural disasters. 
76. The impact of the above operations will vary in terms of its geographical scope. The 
Programmatic Agriculture DPO is expected to achieve the country-wide impact, given its focus 
on the policy framework. Commercial Agriculture Development Project, Nigeria Erosion 
Watershed Management Project, Staple Crop Processing Zones project, Rural Access and 
Mobility Project 1 and 2, in contrast, have a demonstrational and catalytic nature and are not 
expected to generate country-wide impact but to offer models and practices that could be scaled 
up. For example, the efforts to treat land for erosion include strong community involvement in 
order to help secure their participation and ownership of the larger erosion management planning 
and implementation of activities that will ultimately bring a more permanent solution. It also 
bears noting that the 2,800 additional ha of land treated for erosion that will be achieved during 
this CPS is only a fraction of the total 12,000 ha that will be treated for erosion beyond the CPS 
period. The Disaster Risk Management – Climate Change operation would focus on flood prone 
areas such as those along Benue river basin. The other example of demonstrational support is the 
IFC and the WB work on a joint business plan to help strengthen linkages between farmers and 
agro-processors through the demonstration SCPZ project. Consistent with the emphasis on 
synergy and complementarity between projects, the CPS pairs this work with support under the 
Growth and Employment in Markets (GEM) project to improving linkages among agro-
processors, logistic providers, certification services, and farmers, which will help reduce the 
vulnerability of rural households to volatility in market demand. MIGA will continue to seek 
opportunities to support private investments in the agribusiness sector, including smaller 
projects. MIGA currently has three projects in the pipeline.  
77. A common theme to the support package is the strengthening of institutional and 
governance arrangements across all levels of Government. The CPS will augment the use of 
stakeholder analysis for project design and policy dialogue and continue to embed strengthening 
institutional set-up, regulatory framework, financial management, capacity building and social 
accountability in projects. In addition, RAMP 1 and 2 projects will help strengthen sub-national 
capacity to implement sound rural transport policies and to manage rural roads in a financially 
sustainable manner. RAMP 2 will also promote social accountability by linking road funding to 
the performance of state and local Governments and by introducing community-based and 
performance-based approaches to rural transport infrastructure management and maintenance.  
78. Through the Country Assistance Framework, the WB will coordinate its activities 
with other partners, mobilize and implement trust fund support as appropriate, and 
promote opportunities for leveraging additional resources. Strong collaboration is already 
established with DFID, IFAD, AfDB, USAID and UNIDO on support to staple crop processing 
zones. Trust fund support continues to play an important role by funding technical assistance, 
such as for implementing recommendations of the Post Disaster Risk Assessment and 
strengthening the capacity of Nigeria’s post disaster risk management institutions (EU/GFDRR 
funded projects), and engaging with the Government on agricultural commodity exchange in 

29 

 
Nigeria (Trade Facilitation in Nigeria Agricultural Markets). IDA resources under RAMP 2 are 
leveraged in several states with resources from the French Development Agency, with a view to 
scaling up to include more states and attract more donors. 

FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT 

CPS outcome 
Expanded financing 
opportunities 
for 
SMEs 
Improved supply of 
longer 
term 
financing  

Outcome indicators 
 Additional 100,000 loans provided to SMEs by IFC 
 Additional 2 million micro entrepreneurs provided with financial 
services by IFC. 
 Percentage of long term financing >24 months of outstanding private 
sector credit increased to 5% of the total private sector credit 
 Percentage of housing finance loans in the financial sector increased to 
5% of the total loans 
 Volume of corporate bond issues increased on average to 2 issues every year. 
79. Nigeria needs to broaden and deepen its financial services to diversify its production 
structure and promote a structural shift in employment demand. Lending by financial 
institutions is heavily concentrated on larger corporations and their supplier value-chains.41 Oil 
and gas is the main lending sector, representing approximately 22 percent42 of total credit to the 
private sector. The domestic local currency savings (primarily from pension funds) are not 
channeled to the productive sectors such as infrastructure, housing/mortgages, and SMEs. 43 
Long-term financing, particularly for infrastructure and housing, is largely absent.44 SMEs in 
Nigeria have enormous potential to play a crucial role in economic growth, poverty 
reduction, employment and wealth creation. However, many find it difficult to survive and 
grow, as they lack access to the finance, skills and information to expand and grow. 45 
Nigeria’s SMEs account for only about 5 percent of total lending by commercial banks.46  
80. The CPS program includes support to expanding access to financial services for 
SMEs and enhancing their capacity to absorb those services. The package of support 
envisions IFC working with local banks to expand access to financing for SMEs, while in 
parallel building the banks’ capacity to innovate, manage risk, and efficiently monitor SME 
lending. IFC also plans to provide support for establishing and/or improving financial 
infrastructure (e.g. collateral registry, credit bureaus, payments/mobile banking) to lower the 
risks associated with SME lending by banks and other SME financiers. It also plans, directly and 
through wholesale solutions, to finance commercial microfinance institutions to better reach the 
base-of-the-pyramid entrepreneurs (especially women).  
81. Consistent with expansion of financial services, capacity building support will be 
provided to SMEs and agricultural enterprises to make full use of those services. IFC plans 
to scale up its capacity building support to SMEs through a country-wide roll-out of its Business

Edge and SME toolkit access programs. 47 Recognizing that a significant portion of Africa’s 
MSMEs are owned and run by women, IFC will seek to address obstacles that women face in 
business and will target sectors for investment that tend to employ women. IDA will continue its 
support to promising industry clusters that have the potential for employment growth – the ICT, 
entertainment, construction and manufacturing sectors – through the Growth and Employment 
(GEM) project. CAF partners DFID, GIZ, and EU will closely complement this focus through 
their work on addressing regulatory and administrative barriers to specific cluster/value chains. 
The support in this area is evolving and the CPS progress report will offer an opportunity to 
capture and reflect its impact in the results matrix, as appropriate.  
82. The WBG program will also focus on increasing the supply of long-term financing, 
which is expected to help boost productive employment. The planned Development Finance 
operation will help reform the development finance framework and build a leveraging 
framework to securely channel long term savings from pension and other funds into long term 
lending for the SMEs, agriculture and infrastructure. By supporting the establishment of the 
Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC), the Housing Finance Project supported by IDA 
and IFC will help to increase the supply of long-term finance to the housing market, and enhance 
access to finance for lower income borrowers. Unlocking the residential housing market through 
the development of the housing finance market can provide a wide range of income 
opportunities through the construction sector and related industries, as evidenced in Colombia 
and India. The WBG work in the housing sector is complemented by efforts by DFID and 
Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to improve land and legal systems, and 
the quality of housing construction.48  
83. Given the scarcity of bank lending for diversified growth, IFC plans to promote the 
development of non-bank financing. Its support will focus on: (a) local currency bond; (b) 
regulatory approvals for an IFC medium-term notes shelf program, to enable IFC to periodically 
issue bonds to fund projects in Nigeria with longer-term financing; and (c) the Efficient 
Securities Markets and Institutional Development program, supporting regulatory capacity 
building at the Securities & Exchange Commission and National Pension Commission, among 
others, to help rejuvenate the non-sovereign bond market. Diversifying financial intermediation 
to the debt capital markets complements the strengthening of the banking sector. 
84. Knowledge work represents an important element of the support package. The 
proposed sector work – Inclusive Markets, Inclusive Finance and an Investment Climate 
Assessment Report on Drivers of Job Creation – will aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of 
the program. In conjunction with the planned Job Assessment Report, this work will provide 
policy-makers and new Government with an evidence-based platform to adjust policy mix in 
order to optimize the overall impact of finance for development reforms on jobs and income. 
This knowledge work will also help shape eventual additional lending support in FY16-17.  

47 These are upgraded toolkits designed to assist small and medium entrepreneurs in optimizing their businesses. 
48 The building blocks of the housing sector are sound macroeconomic policies, access to long term financing, 
improved land and legal systems and increased housing construction.

Second Strategic Cluster: Quality, Effectiveness and Efficiency of Social 
Service Delivery at State Level for Greater Social Inclusion 

85. The CPS support seeks to address inequities in income and opportunities by 
developing more effective mechanisms for social service delivery (social protection 
programs, education, health, and water services delivery). Social services delivery in Nigeria 
is largely poorly targeted, with limited coverage, and is not evaluated periodically. This results in 
sub-optimal utilization of funds, and constrains the ability of all members of society, and 
especially the poor and vulnerable, to reap the benefits of growth or to buffer the economic and 
climatic shocks faced by the poor. 

STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY DRIVEN MECHANISMS FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION, AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS 

CPS outcomes 
Improved targeting of 
social protection and 
increased employment 
readiness of youth in 
supported states. 

Outcome indicators 
 # of states using the unified registry of beneficiaries and common 
targeting mechanism increased from 0 to 10  
 Additional 100,000 youth who received orientation and life skills 
training  
 40 percent increase in the number of poor beneficiaries (lowest 
quintiles) from targeted poor households receiving cash transfers. 
 Increased number of poor and vulnerable people (of which not less 
than 50% are women) with access to social and livelihood support 
services through community development plans. 

Increased 
access of 
poor and vulnerable 
households 
to 
social 
and economic services  
86. For a country to respond effectively to shocks and protect its vulnerable citizens, it 
needs a coherent social safety net system. Over the last ten years or so, the WB has been 
supporting community driven development approaches in many Nigerian states as a major 
mechanism for increasing access and utilization of human development and social services by 
poor and vulnerable. The projects have generated good results to date, suggesting the continuing 
validity of this approach. However, given the marginal poverty reduction in Nigeria, there is 
clearly a need for much stronger efforts to accelerate its pace and strengthen the targeting 
system. In particular, social safety nets need to play much stronger role in mitigating inequality 
of income and opportunity. 
87. WBG support combines the continuing support to the CDD approach to poverty 
reduction and efforts to strengthen the social safety net system. The ongoing Community 
Social Development Project (CSDP), State Expenditure Effectiveness for Results (SEEFOR), the 
Youth Employment and Social Support Operation (YESSO) and the planned Additional 
Financing for the CSDP and Social Inclusion and Welfare Advancement project are all 
instruments that will focus on strengthening community driven mechanisms for social inclusion 
and effectiveness of social protection programs. These interventions will complement the recent 
initiative by the federal Government to develop a comprehensive national social safety net 
framework for the country.  A multisectoral federal task team has been established to fashion a 
robust social safety net coordination program in consultation with state governments and 
development partners and complimentary to existing interventions.  Key elements of the ongoing 
and planned support in the area of social protection include: (a) empowering the poor and 
32 

 
vulnerable in the effort to fight poverty; (b) strengthening the capacity for coordination, 
monitoring, policy development and the creation of co-financing mechanisms for social safety 
net programs at the federal level and establishing a common targeting system and the Unified 
Register of Beneficiaries at the state level; (c) supporting the existing public workfare program 
and training unskilled youth for job opportunities, while ensuring that women are included and 
do benefit from those programs; (d) conditional cash transfer program to encourage poor families 
to invest in education and health of their children and female young adults; and (e) increasing the 
share of participating local governments that are funding and incorporating community 
development plans in their budget. Results achieved to date regarding the number of youth 
trained, common targeting mechanism, unified registry of beneficiaries, and cash transfers to 
poor beneficiaries reflect progress in improving the efficiency of government programs. States 
are expected to scale up mechanisms and practices which have been developed to deliver those 
results. The WBG will reinforce and support social protection programs in the immediate future 
through the planned Social Inclusion and Welfare Advancement Project. The Bank will also 
continue to coordinate its activities and collaborate with United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), International Labor Organization 
(ILO), DFID, UNICEF and UN Women within the CAF framework to ensure complementary 
and effectiveness of efforts. 
88. The planned diagnostic work will play an important role in advancing the WB’s 
dialogue and national debate on social protection in Nigeria. Sharing Prosperity in Nigeria: 
An Analytical Work Program on Jobs and Social Protection; the Social Protection Status 
Report 49 and the Nigeria-specific follow up to the World Development Report on jobs will 
provide a strong knowledge platform to stimulate national debate and engage with the new 
Government on those issues. This work will be complemented and supported by the work funded 
under the Governance Partnership Trust Fund, Rapid Social Response Trust Fund and the trust 
fund on environmentally and socially sustainable development.

 At least 80 % coverage with oral polio vaccine sustained in every state 
by 2017. 
 % of pregnant women living with HIV who receive a complete course 
of antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce the risk of mother to child 
transmission increased from 18% to 40%.

89. Economic growth has not improved health status. Rates of malnutrition among children 
has either stagnated or worsened depending on the indicator used and the total fertility rate 
remained stagnant over the last decade. The bright spot has been a reduction in under-five 
mortality rates and this is likely due to the distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets 
that prevent malaria (malaria accounts for almost 24% of the entire burden of disease in Nigeria). 
The upper income quintiles in Nigeria have access to a large private health sector that is mostly 
beyond the reach of the poor who have to rely on a public sector that is not performing well 
enough to meet their needs. Governance, rather than an absolute lack of resources, appears to 
be the main problem in the public health service delivery. Failure to address key governance 
issues such as accountability, incentives, availability of credible data, and capable 
management has consistently impeded progress in improving service delivery even when 
inputs have been available 
90. 
 The CPS program will support the Government in implementing bold approaches to 
addressing governance issues and strengthening service delivery. The ongoing Nigeria State 
Health Investment Project and the proposed Program for Results (P4R) operation will promote 
results-based financing to address governance issues. The focus is on changing incentives and 
increasing accountability for service delivery by linking disbursements (and payments to health 
facilities) to increased quantity and quality of health services. Health facilities in remote areas 
receive higher payments to address equity issues. The Nigeria State Health Investment Project 
has successfully piloted results-based financing and will now expand this to cover 3 states. 
Building on the lessons learned, the proposed P4R operation will use a variety of results-based 
approaches in an additional 6-12 states. Effective use of ICT systems will be explored for 
improved service delivery by encouraging data-driven decision-making, targeted beneficiary 
feedback, and tracking progress against DLIs.   
91. Efforts will be made to help improve monitoring and evaluation, with trust funds 
providing important support in that respect. The HRITF Impact Evaluation Trust Fund is 
supporting the Nigeria State Health Investment Project to assess its progress, thus providing an 
evidence base for its scaling up. Through the Quality of Service grant, the Bank is piloting 
service delivery indicator surveys in 12 states. Data collection systems will also be strengthened 
through the proposed P4R operation, including by leveraging various ICT tools.  
92. The package of support also comprises IDA and IFC collaboration to pilot improved 
hospital management through PPPs and the continuing implementation of the on-going 
HIV/AIDs, malaria, and polio projects. The Polio Buy-Down Program (trust fund) has 
continued to provide critically important support to eradicating polio in Nigeria. Additional 
financing operation may be required in order to help the government eradicate polio and shift 
effectively to strengthened routine immunization (RI), especially in conflict-affected areas of the 
country where polio is still circulating. The country needs to maintain the polio-free status for 
three years after interrupting transmission to be declared polio-free. Since the most polio 
endemic states, Borno and Yobe, face serious security challenges, the new support will test 
innovative approaches to improve the very low routine immunization coverage and strengthen 
primary health care more broadly.

EFFICIENCY, EQUITABLE ACCESS AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION SERVICES  

CPS outcomes 
Improved 
learning environment 
and management capacity 
for 
education  

Outcome indicators 
 10,000 additional teachers in rural areas (baseline: 
31,243 
in 2013, delivered by 
the results-based 
financing of education services in 3 states) 
 50% of supported schools demonstrate improvements 
in learning outcomes (baseline: 4000 schools in 2013, 
delivered by the results-based financing of education 
services in 3 states). 
 # of states with approved Strategic Plan for improving 
quality and relevance of TVE increased from 4 to 15. 

Strengthened 
responsiveness of 
public 
and 
private 
training 
institutions to skills demand 
93. Education is key for Nigeria’s economic growth and poverty reduction. Despite the 
progress made, many challenges remain to increasing enrollment in primary education. About 
one in every three primary-school-age children still does not have access to primary education. 
Poverty has been consistently found to be the dominant factor that prevents many children from 
starting school on time or even setting foot in school.50 Most of these children are concentrated 
in the North, in rural areas, and in poor households. Girls from such backgrounds are 
substantially more disadvantaged in education than are boys. On average, only 37 percent of 
students finish primary school at the official age of 11. At the national level, 60 and 44 percent of 
students, after completing grade 4 and grade 6 respectively, cannot read a complete sentence. 
About 10 percent cannot add numbers at the end of primary education. Lack of technical and 
vocational training and low productivity affect product quality and the growth of value chains in 
Nigeria. Many graduates are unable to find jobs, while skills remain in short supply in some 
industries. A recently-completed Policy Note on Access, Quality and Equity in Education 
Nigeria established that student achievement is hindered by the lack of qualified teachers, 
insufficient teaching, learning resources, school autonomy and weak accountability for results. 
Underlying Nigeria’s skills gaps are a weak basic education system and a lack of coordination 
between firms and education and training institutions.  
94. Given that the WB’s contribution to the education and training sector in Nigeria is a 
very small percentage of overall financing of education (less than 3 percent), the Bank’s 
support will be primarily catalytic, aiming at transforming behaviors and practices. The 
recently-approved State Education Project pilots the results-based approach in three states to 
increase the number of qualified teachers in rural areas (rural schools usually lack qualified 
teachers), ensure a regular system of state-level standardized assessments, and improve quality 
and relevance of technical and vocational education. The planned Global Partnership for 
Education project will promote a similar approach in 9 states in the North, in close coordination 
with DFID, USAID and UNICEF, all of which have existing interventions in the area. The 
planned additional financing for the Lagos Eko Project will consolidate good progress in

improving the quality and relevance of vocational training, 51 while the Africa’s Centers of 
Excellence Project will aim to strengthen Nigeria’s capacity to respond to the demand for skills 
through West Africa and the continent.  
95. Knowledge work will play an extremely important role in advancing the WB’s 
dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders, and the national debate on 
education and skill challenges. The planned series of Policy Notes on Skills for Growth and 
Competitiveness, Political Economy of Education Reforms, Public Expenditures in Education 
and Training First (PET), Poverty, and Jobs will aim to (a) improve the national awareness of the 
significance of the education problem in Nigeria and the critical importance of education for the 
national development, and (b) provide a platform for a much stronger strategic engagement with 
federal and state authorities on how to bring about a profound institutional reform in the 
education sector.  

COVERAGE AND EFFICIENCY OF WATER SUPPLY SERVICES 

CPS outcomes 
Improved coverage and 
efficiency of water supply 
service in selected states 

Outcome indicators 
 # of people with access to improved water supply increased by 
4 million  
 45 percent average increase in cost recovery for operation and 
maintenance. 
96. Nigeria has invested heavily in the water supply and sanitation sector, but significant 
challenges remain. Over the last 20 years, access to safe drinking water increased by 13 
percentage points from 48 percent of the population in 1990 to 61 percent in 2010.52 During 
the same period, the share of those with access to improved sanitation actually declined by 
about 15 percent, from 37 to 31 percent. The sector has been weakened by poor operation 
and maintenance, inept institutions, poor tracking of budgeted funds and expenditures, 
insufficient technical capacity, lack of coordination across different levels of Government, 
and lack of inter-sectoral coordination. Lack of financial autonomy is at the heart of the poor 
performance of all water utilities, coupled with frequent changes in management. 
97. WB support will help improve coverage and efficiency of water supply service. 
Building on the ongoing Urban Water 1 and 2 projects, the new investment support (Water 3) 
will also address governance aspects such as institutional strengthening, policy and regulatory 
reform, tracking system for access to potable water, service standards for State Water Boards, 
and the involvement of civil society in sector dialogue to increase transparency and 
accountability. WB activities will be anchored at the federal and state levels in order to promote 
synergies between state level reforms and federal awards of investment support. In a number of 
states, the WB’s expertise in the sector is leveraged with resources form the AfDB and AFD. 
MIGA can also play a role in facilitating private investments in infrastructure, both at the federal 
as well as state levels, and is currently actively looking at two projects in the water sector.

2017. 
 Increased availability of official statistics to all users at federal and state 
level as measured by 40 percent increase in the number of states with 
State Statistical Yearbook which is less than 3 years old (Baseline: 14 
States, 2013) 
 40 percent increase in the number of statistical thematic areas where 
internationally agreed concepts and standards are applied at federal and 
state level (Baseline: 7 areas, 2013).  

98. Governance has been at the center of the Bank’s engagement and country strategies 
since the transition to democracy in 1999 and has gradually evolved and deepened. The 
focus on strengthening public financial management systems and public sector reform more 
generally at federal level has gradually expanded to also include support to (a) the 
implementation of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), and (b) to 
improving public finance management and governance in states. Concurrently, emphasis on 
sector governance has been increasing. This CPS will continue supporting the NEITI, including 
data handling, standardization, quality control, and trend analysis, and other efforts related to the 
NEITI process, such as outreach and sensitization of professional accounting bodies, auditing 
and accounting firms, and the Bureau of Public Procurement. The CPS will also continue to 
consolidate support aimed at strengthening public financial management at federal and state 
levels while scaling up previous experiences in sector operations by mainstreaming institution 
building, political economy considerations and efforts to strengthen good governance into the 
portfolio. Investment lending and grant support for public financial management reforms will 
increase through operations already approved by the World Bank and other development 
partners. The geographic coverage of the engagement will expand. Cooperation with partners to 
improve governance will be strengthened under the CAF and the close cooperation between the 
Bank and DFID, currently anchored in the Governance Partnership Facility framework, will 
continue. The WBG direct engagement with anti-corruption entities will be scaled down in light 
of the substantial engagement by other CAF development partners.  

37 

 
 
 
PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  

99. 
 Continuing commitment is critical for strengthening public financial management 
and policy formulation and implementation at all levels of Government. Notwithstanding the 
progress in initiating important reforms at both federal and state levels during the last CPS, the 
remaining reform agenda is large. The continuing Bank support to improving PFM systems in 21 
states will help strengthen the fundamentals for improved service delivery, which inter alia, is 
expected to facilitate gains in human development outcomes, growth and competitiveness. 
Exploratory PFM capacity building activities will be initiated within a limited number of local 
authorities. Part of the engagement with the Federal Government will continue to focus on 
effective macroeconomic and reserve management.  
100. The CPS will help enhance transparency in budget execution in targeted states and at 
Federal level by: (a) offering on-demand technical assistance to specific technical areas; (b) 
promoting greater transparency over budget planning and execution;  (c) continuing the dialogue 
on the importance of 'good enough' financial management with a range of stakeholders, (d) 
continuing the support to budget monitoring platforms and facilitating their engagement in multi-
stakeholder dialogues, (e) expanding the scope of GIFMIS at the federal and state levels to 
reduce budget fragmentation, and enhance spending controls through all stages of budget 
execution and (f) strengthen treasury management and improve the efficiency of budget 
execution. Attention will be given to the sequencing and interconnectedness of reforms. While 
some financial management reforms can be embedded in sector operations others require 
changes to overall systems and regulatory frameworks. These activities will be targeted at both 
federal and state levels. At the federal level, new lending support will be available in advancing 
the PFM reform agenda. At the state level, the Bank’s support is anchored in the ongoing 
investment operations in 21 states. The WB will continue to make available support to state-level 
development policy operations (Lagos DPO2 and 3, Edo Growth and Employment Operation 2) 
as a strong vehicle for deep engagement at the state level, particularly for improving public 
financial management.  
101. Building on engagement under the previous CPS, public procurement is identified as 
a special area of focus in the CPS. Important reform progress was made in the area of 
procurement in the last CPS. The legislative framework is now in place at federal level and in 24 
states, while the remaining 12 states are at various stages of this reform engagement. The next 
stage is support to the implementation of the frameworks. The WB will facilitate e-procurement, 
the use of framework contracts, standard bidding documents, and self-assessments of 
procurement policy and practices. Assistance will be provided through capacity building 
initiatives including technical assistance and South-South learning activities focusing on lessons 
from other countries. Support will continue for independent, third-party monitoring of 
procurement processes in various MDA at both the Federal and in targeted state levels. 
102. Multi-sectoral teams will ensure that institutional strengthening, including public 
financial management, is embedded in sector engagements. The WB’s sector engagement 
during the previous CPS has increasingly incorporated institutional strengthening and public 
financial management. For example, the engagement on social safety nets and in the health 
sector will seek to strengthen the functioning of existing institutions and financial 
management arrangements. 

38 

 
103. An important element in the general PFM engagement will be the facilitation of 
state-to-state comparison and learning. Taking into account approaches and lessons from 
Bank work in other Regions   as well as previous initiatives in Nigeria, efforts will be made 
to facilitate communities of practice with relevant stakeholders at the state level across the 
PFM cycle. 

IMPROVED QUALITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF STATISTICS 

104. The poor quality of data and statistics in Nigeria undermine the quality of policy 
design and dialogue across all sectors. Although the use of statistically rigorous impact 
evaluation is increasing, most notably in the health sector, capacity in the use of this tool to 
improve the management and effectiveness of policies and programs remains highly limited. 
105. To address these issues, the WBG will provide new lending support for building a 
modern effective statistical system in Nigeria (Annex 5), and continue supporting the work 
on the Service Delivery Indicators package of tools and public expenditure tracking like 
instruments. The aim is to improve the quality and accessibility of the evidence base for 
decision making. Support to statistical capacity building, which will generate results after this 
CPS period, will emphasize long-term institutional strengthening through a multi-donor 
approach, as opposed to support for individual surveys and analyses. Additionally, the impact 
evaluation will continue to be used to complement statistics and monitoring and evaluation in 
order to advance the science of delivery and promote a culture of results. This engagement will 
feed into a longer-term agenda aimed at improving the basis for decision making and feedback 
on growth and competitiveness as well as on the inclusion agenda. One important priority is to 
improve the methodologies and accuracy of core economic statistics in Nigeria. The WBG is 
currently cooperating with the IMF on the GDP rebasing exercise that should significantly 
improve the methodology for determining the national accounts and GDP in Nigeria. This model 
can potentially be further developed and extended to other areas of core statistics.   
106. Further, the WBG will continue its TA support on Open Government and Open Data 
to the Federal Government and targeted states. The aim of this support is to enable greater 
participation by citizens and improve transparency and collaboration, including via various ICT 
platforms. These efforts will build on the successful launch of the Open Data Initiative at the 
federal level and in Edo State, and are expected to facilitate more effective communication flows 
among government departments and between the government and the public.  

STRENGTHENING OVERSIGHT AND SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY  

107. Legislative oversight of the executive is evolving at the federal level and is very 
uneven at the state level. A key element of good governance and sometimes an important driver 
of PFM reforms, strengthening legislative oversight could have transformative potential in 
Nigeria by (a) strengthening the credibility of the elected houses, (b) strengthening the quality of 
oversight, and (c) creating needed legislative support for the PFM reform agenda. 
108. The WB will provide TA support to the National House of Assembly and State 
Houses of Assembly to strengthen the quality of their involvement in the PFM cycle. 
Participation in national and international peer-to-peer networks will be facilitated. Trainings 
will be provided (especially to committee clerks and other staff) and work with the embryonic 
National Budget and Research office will be intensified in close cooperation with other 

39 

 
development partners. This engagement will aim at improving the overall governance 
environment for development but also more specifically at strengthening the demand and support 
for public financial management reforms.  
109. The strategy will continue to harness civil society for development effectiveness 
through the use of social accountability mechanisms piloted during the previous CPS. At 
the policy level, the CPS will continue supporting a dialogue around open government and open 
data, and targeted initiatives on procurement reform, open budget, freedom of information and 
health reform. At the project level, efforts will continue to support greater transparency, 
participation, leveraging innovative ICT tools for targeted beneficiary feedback and third party 
monitoring in the agriculture, health, education and urban sectors. In an effort to improve the 
internal transparency and accountability of civil society itself, capacity building support will be 
provided to non-state actors, including specialized support to governance-specific CSOs.  
110. Understanding that demand for good governance and social accountability also stems 
from a sense of identity, investment and aspiration on the part of the citizenry, the Bank 
will continue to promote policy dialogue and targeted interventions aimed at promoting 
social cohesion, nation building and “voices for change”. This will build on previous efforts 
focused on gender inclusion and targeted support women’s coalitions. It will build on efforts to 
support coalitions of CSOs that focus on a range of governance issues in order to aggregate voice 
and promote broad-based networks for reform. Finally, it will build on targeted efforts to support 
initiatives that aim to promote social cohesion and ‘positive’ identities- such as previous support 
for key cultural events.  

MAINSTREAMING POLITICAL ECONOMY AND GOVERNANCE INTO THE BANK’S ENGAGEMENT 
IN NIGERIA 

111. With a view to improving the Bank’s effectiveness, a Programmatic Approach to 
Governance has been developed and will be rolled out during the CPS period. The 
approach, developed over a year with buy-in from the country team and accompanied by high-
level technical work, has the following key elements: 
 Political economy analysis of the macro, sector and project levels will help improve the 
WB’s understanding of governance and political economy constraints to development in 
Nigeria and thus the design and implementation of operations.  
 A Governance, Conflict and Gender filter will support task teams in better identifying 
problems and assumptions in approaches, understanding local contexts, learning lessons 
from the past, measuring reform potential, ensuring that fiduciary and corruption risks are 
addressed, and setting in place tracking mechanisms that will make it easier to engage a 
broader range of actors, learn throughout the project cycle, recognize risks and 
implementation challenges, and react accordingly, with increased flexibility.  
 Specifically on facilitating social accountability and the demand for good governance, the 
filter is intended to ensure that operations:  (a) are designed to promote and facilitate 
citizens engagement in the reform process; (b) support beneficiary assessments and 
feedback and promote third-party monitoring; (c) allow for iterative improvements in 
design and implementation based on (a) and (b).  
In the area of conflict, the filter is intended to ensure that operations (a) are designed to 
mitigate conflicts in locations where operations are implemented, (b) clearly identify risks 

 

40 

 
 

of augmenting conflicts and include mitigating features, and (c) in designing supervision 
arrangements, take into account the potential impact of violent conflict for staff safety, 
fiduciary risks and ability to facilitate implementation. 
In the area of gender, the filter will seek to support analysis and consultation on gender-
related issues as part of project preparation and implementation. Specifically, the aim is to 
ensure that projects, where relevant, support specific actions to reduce potential differentiated 
impact of the project activities, address the distinct needs of women and girls, or men and 
boys, or narrow the gender gaps. The design of the gender filter builds on the Gender in 
Fadama Research Project (2012) and the Nigeria Gender Portfolio Review (2012) and their  
recommendations for the better inclusion of gender in the Bank’s projects in Nigeria.  
 Following on lessons learned from the previous CPS, the WB has constituted an external 
Governance Consultation Group, increasing its external outreach and consultation. The 
Group consists of eminent Nigerians, reflecting the diversity of Nigerian society. Its 
objective is to provide real time advice on local contexts to management and task teams. 
112. The governance filter ultimately seeks to improve the capacity of the Bank to deliver 
results and will be implemented through an interdisciplinary committee. The committee will 
include financial management, procurement and monitoring and evaluation colleagues, in 
addition to the Country Management Unit (CMU) and a governance expert. The roll-out of the 
filter will require a number of changes to the incentives, resources and accountability 
mechanisms for the country team as well as additional attention to tailoring and adapting to 
evolving local context at the project level.  

IV.D. Implementing the FY2014-2017 Country Partnership Strategy 
Financing Sources  

113. In order to keep the flexibility mentioned previously, the WBG is proposing a well-
defined program for the first two years (US$3.1 billion IDA and US$1.6 billion IBRD) 
(Table 4). For the outer years, the program will be based on the outcome of the AAA and the 
priorities defined by the new government. Overall IBRD/IDA financing will average about US$2 
billion per year over the CPS period, and additional support will be provided by IFC and MIGA. 
The IDA amounts in the first year of the CPS are based on allocations in IDA16. Actual 
allocations will depend on (a) the country's own performance; (b) its performance relative to 
other IDA recipients; (c) the total amount of resources available to IDA; (d) any changes in the 
list of IDA-eligible countries; (e) any changes in the performance-based allocation system for 
IDA17, and (f) the overall size of the IDA17 replenishment.53  The indicative IBRD financing 
envelope over the four years period under this CPS is US$2.9 billion.  In addition, Nigeria’s 
support under this CPS includes an indicative trust fund financing of about US$200 million and 
Analytical and Advisory Activities, which are set out in Table 5.  

53 As Nigeria is no longer IDA-only, it will not be eligible for compensatory reallocations from MDRI 
netting out assuming this mechanism is carried forward into IDA17. IDA’s lending terms will also be 
hardened from FY14 to IDA blend terms, reflecting Nigeria’s level of income.

114. The CPS will optimize and diversify lending instruments in support of the proposed 
lending program. In addition to traditional investment lending, the proposed program includes 
development policy support to states to support multi-sectoral solutions with a focus on growth 
and poverty. At the federal level, DPOs will be available to support implementation of 
agricultural policy reforms and possibly also to support activities in the area of disaster risk 
management/climate change. Similar, possible state-level DPOs will support the reform agenda 
at the state level, building on the previous CPS. The WB will continue to emphasize 
performance-based approaches in investment lending, notably in the human development sector 
where a Program for Results (P4R) operation is proposed in the health sector. IBRD lending may 
be supported using various instruments, such as DPOs and Guarantees. Presently, the 
Government has requested that much of IBRD support be directed to the financing for 
development support, and to the power sector, to leverage private sector investment through 
partial risk guarantees. . 
115. While the overall ratio of trust funds (TFs) vs. IDA assistance for Nigeria is low, TFs 
have been providing important support. Over the last three fiscal years, total commitments 
under recipient-executed trust funds (RETFs) amount to $182.19 million, while cumulative 
disbursements amounted to US$95.57 million. The Polio Buy-Down Program, the largest trust 
fund, has provided critically important support to eradicating polio in Nigeria. Statistics for 
Development TF is supporting the Bank’s engagement in the statistics area. Much of the impact 
evaluation activities are trust-funded, such as earlier mentioned impact evaluation under the 
Nigeria Health Sector Investment Project. Support from the Global Facility for Disaster 
Reduction and Recovery provided a vehicle for mobilizing and responding to the Government’s 
request for support after 2012 flooding. The Nigeria program continues to benefit from the 
GFDRR support. Another example is the Governance Partnership Facility – it supported the 
development of the Governance Approach and continues to play an important role in the WBG 
engagement in the governance and public management area.

116. As already discussed, knowledge work plays an important role in the CPS program. 
The work planned in FY2014-2015 will provide further selective support as well as the platform 
for engaging with the new Government. For this engagement, the CPS will develop a strong 
knowledge platform around the poverty, jobs, inclusive finance and markets, education/skills, 
safety nets, and urbanization issues (Table 5).  

Portfolio Management 

117. Portfolio implementation experienced challenges during FY2013 mainly due to the 
delay in the approval of the 2012 Borrowing Plan by the National Assembly of Nigeria. 
This, in turn, caused delays in signing the Financing Agreements for 7 projects, delayed 
effectiveness of 8 projects, and an increase in the number of problem projects. Yet, in spite 
of those challenges, the Country Team achieved 19.5 percent disbursement rate by end 
FY2013, which is a significant achievement. Following the approval of the Borrowing Plan, 
all projects approved have become effective and the portfolio implementation is expected to 
further improve.  
118. The CMU has put in place a robust portfolio management mechanism. The key 
elements of that mechanism include: (a) an implementation support team (IST) consisting of 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
country operational staff to work with project teams to address challenges; (b) rigorous periodic 
assessments with multi-sector task teams to pro-actively determine issues in key operational 
areas and offer solutions; (c) monthly portfolio monitoring reports; (d) bi-weekly portfolio 
meetings of the CMU leadership team (the CMU and sector leaders); (e) periodic meetings with 
Project Coordinators and Task Team Leaders; (f) on-boarding events, capacity building 
programs and hands-on clinics to support clients and project teams; and (g) Country Program 
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) at project, zonal and national levels to identify and resolve 
operational issues. The recently-completed zonal CPPRs covering all geopolitical zones have 
fostered renewed momentum, greater ownership and better alignment of IDA programs with 
state programs and priorities. 

Financial Management and Procurement Systems 

119. Nigeria is making progress in improving its financial management systems, but 
important reforms are still pending. The GIFMIS for budget execution has been established 
across 207 federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and a new Cash Management 
Policy has reduced interest costs arising from Central Bank advances to finance the budget. 
There has also been progress at the federal level and in some states in reducing submission time 
for monthly and annual financial statements. Reforms in budget classification are ongoing, and a 
new GFS/COFOG compliant chart of accounts will allow the Government to record all sources 
of funding and report more details of transactions. However, Government has yet to (a) amend 
the Finance (Management and Control) Act of 1958, the organic PFM law, to better reflect 
current financial management requirements; or (b) the Audit Act, to strengthen the functions and 
independence of the federal Auditor General; or (c) transition from prepayment internal audit 
method to the risk-based method. 
120. Nigeria has also improved its procurement policies and practices and strengthened 
procurement capacity at the federal and state levels. A Public Procurement Act has been 
enacted at the federal level and procurement laws are in place in 24 States. Regulatory agencies 
and cadres of public procurement professionals have been established, and a range of 
procurement tools have strengthened budget planning and efficient implementation. At the 
federal level alone, these improvements have resulted in savings of N572 billion (US$3.7 billion) 
in 2012 compared to 2011.54 
121. These 
improvements have enabled greater use of country systems for the 
procurement of goods, works and services. For instance, the National Standard Bidding 
Documents are now used by Bank-financed projects for National Competitive Bidding without 
exceptions, because of their improved quality. The market has responded with increased 
participation in bidding for contracts funded by both Government and Bank leading to more 
competition and cost reduction. The WB will continue to work with authorities to address any 
remaining weakness in the procurement system, to further increase the use of country system in 
WB-funded project.

Monitoring and Evaluation and Advancing the Science of Delivery 

122. The CPS outcomes have been carefully chosen to ensure that they are measureable 
and that progress can be monitored and assessed. Each project will have its own monitoring 
framework with gender-disaggregated and conflict data, where appropriate, and civil society 
monitoring will be promoted to enable citizens to hold local officials to account. Together with 
the CAF partners, the WB will explore opportunities for supporting the Government in building 
coherent and effective national M&E systems.  
123. The CPS will place emphasis on advancing the ‘science of delivery’. Its program of 
impact evaluation aims at (a) improving the effectiveness and operational efficiency of 
specific policies and programs, and (b) promoting the use of impact evaluation more broadly 
as a tool for evidence-based policymaking and to build knowledge, including around 
effective use of ICT in support of service delivery. Impact evaluation cuts across key themes 
in the CPS principles of engagement, including innovative and catalytic interventions, 
knowledge, and the delivery of results, and will be used to complement statistics to advance 
the science of delivery and promote a culture of results. The WB will also use the Country 
Team meetings, Country Portfolio Performance Reviews and CAF framework to capture the 
knowledge, experience and learning collected by project teams and country partners during 
implementation.  
124. An effective communication strategy will aim at raising awareness of relevant 
stakeholders and the general public on the CPS program to foster their participation in 
implementation. The communication strategy will be mainstreamed in all lending operations 
from conception to completion to enhance project performance and achieve development 
objectives. The CPS will emphasize regular and consistent briefing of policy makers key 
Government officials on project processes and results. There will also be capacity building in 
strategic communications for Project Implementation Units and show-casing of results to 
stakeholders to enhance buy-in, support and participation. The communication strategy will also 
address issues of lack of awareness and understanding of WB projects and activities, as indicated 
by the 2013 client survey. 

Partnerships  

125. The CPS is embedded within the broader Country Assistance Framework (CAF) 
(Annex 8). The partnership arrangement under the previous CPS with DFID, AFDB, and USAID 
was expanded to include other partners and led to the development of a comprehensive CAF. 
CAF partners currently 
include African Development Bank, Canadian 
International 
Development Agency, European Union, French Development Agency, Department for 
International Development (UK), Embassy of Brazil and Embassy of China in Nigeria, High 
Commission of India in Nigeria, International Monetary Fund, Japan International Cooperation 
Agency, the Agencies of the  UN, particularly UNDP and UNICEF, USAID and WBG.  
126. The CAF is proving as very effective in furthering the coordination and synergies 
among partners’ strategies of support to Nigeria. For the first time, AFD, CIDA, EU, USAID 
and WB jointly consulted with the Federal Government, private sector, civil society and media 
on their respective country strategies.  

45 

 
127. The WBG will collaborate with CAF partners to enhance the role of knowledge 
partnerships in building capacity at the state level, furthering the federal Government’s reform 
agenda and developing platforms for engagement in new areas such as job creation, socio-
economic development in the North, and urbanization. CAF partners have also agreed to 
establish a coordination forum on governance to ensure sharing of knowledge and operational 
lessons and to enhance cooperation. DFID and the WB initiated a closer cooperation through the 
Global Partnership Facility towards the end of the previous CPS period. This partnership is 
expected to continue in the new CPS period with DFID continuing to support the mainstreaming 
of the governance agenda across the portfolio.  
128. The WBG will also promote knowledge partnerships on the science of delivery. It will 
continue partnering with CSOs on third-party monitoring of WB-funded projects. Such 
monitoring provides valuable insights into the dynamics among stakeholders during project 
implementation, and into qualitative factors that affect project performance. The WB will use the 
framework of Country Portfolio Performance Review to promote learning across projects and 
implementation units. Additionally, together with the CAF partners, the WB will support 
knowledge exchange among states in the areas of capacity building, project implementation, 
impact evaluation, and beneficiary feedback to strengthen project design and execution. The 
platform is expected to help in building/strengthening the capacity of states from all geopolitical 
zones in the country.  

V. MANAGING RISKS 

129. There are several risks to the CPS implementation, including economic volatility 
related to the fluctuation of oil prices and decline in oil output, a political situation that will 
become more fluid leading to the 2015 elections, in-country violence and insecurity, the 
opposition of vested interests to reform, and instability in the region. 
130. Given the high dependence of the country's external balance and consolidated budget 
on oil, Nigeria is vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices or output. Although Nigeria has been 
protecting itself against oil price volatility by maintaining a fiscal reserve, it is still quite 
vulnerable to macroeconomic risks related to oil. Thus, there is potential for an external shock to 
the macroeconomic picture that could change the nature of Government priorities and the 
demand for WB assistance very quickly. This CPS recognizes that the immediate policy 
priorities of the Government could shift very quickly due to this uncertainty, and therefore 
adopts a flexible approach that allows the WB to respond dynamically in the case of significant 
exogenous shocks. The WB will continue to make policy recommendations that support prudent 
macroeconomic management as the key to providing fiscal space for the Government to adjust 
appropriately to external shocks if and when they occur. 
131. Macroeconomic risks have increased in 2013. A largely unexpected decline in oil output 
in the first half of 2013 of roughly 10%, together with somewhat weaker oil prices, have 
tightened the budgetary and balance of payments situation in the country. In this context, the 
balance of the fiscal reserve declined from US$9 to US$5 billion during the first half of 2013 and 
the balance of payments surplus that the country had been generating since September 2011 has 
disappeared. Gross foreign reserves remained at close to US$47 billion from February through 
early September, 2013. An additional potential source of volatility in this context is significant 
short-term portfolio inflows that have sought to exploit high interest rates (12-14%) in the 

46 

 
context of expected exchange rate stability. The increasing proximity of the presidential 
elections, which are typically associated with measurably higher budgetary spending, is yet 
another factor that complicates this picture. 
132.  The WB will stand ready to adjust to shifting priorities of the Government related to 
a worsening of the macroeconomic picture. If the oil output does not stabilize, or oil prices 
decline significantly, Nigeria may find itself in need of a macroeconomic adjustment and without 
the fiscal reserve to support planned budgetary outlays. On the positive side, Nigeria’s sovereign 
debt position is still quite strong, with external debt at only 3% of GDP and domestic debt at 
16%. Given these risks, the WB will keep the flexibility to shift emphasis to budget support or 
other operations that may become highly demanded by the client, likely in support of key 
reforms and institutions that could help insulate the country better from macroeconomic 
volatility in the future.  
133. The evolving and volatile security situation in Northeastern Nigeria represents a 
significant risk to the CPS implementation. In early 2013, Boko Haram shifted its strategy 
from conducting insurgent attacks on Government installations to establishing control over 
swathes of territory of far northeast Borno state. The recent state of emergency in the three 
affected states have displaced civilians and militants alike, raising the risk of pushing fighters to 
other states within Nigeria or over the border to Cameroon or Niger, out of the reach of the 
security services. The counter-insurgency campaign will likely last at least through the full six 
months allowed by the statute but the threat of terrorism and armed conflict will persist beyond 
that period, as it did the recent state of emergency (January-June 2012). In addition to the 
terrorist threat in the northeast, further risk to the implementation of the CPS is manifested in the 
criminal activity along the north-south corridor and communal violence that affects the middle 
belt of the country, from Zamfara to Nasarawa and Taraba. Finally, the kidnapping for ransom 
and express kidnapping risk in the southern part of the country further impedes partners’ ability 
to deliver and supervise projects, especially in the Delta region. 
134. There are three key elements of the WB’s  strategy in mitigating the adverse effect of 
the security situation on its portfolio: 1) agreement with the federal and state Governments to 
modify/restructure projects and  reallocate (on a competitive basis) funds to other states under 
the same projects, should there be no improvement in the security situation over an agreed and 
clearly defined period of time (this practice is already in place); 2) utilization of the 3rd party 
monitoring should WB staff not be able to travel/visit the project areas (this practice is already in 
place); and 3) within the CAF framework, dialogues with the Government and CAF partners, so 
as to be fully informed and up-to-date on the security situation. Should violence escalate, 
creating implementation difficulties for CPS implementation, necessary adjustments to the 
program will be made in consultation with the Government. Additionally, the WB will monitor 
security challenges in the Sahel Region, their developmental impact in the sub-region and 
potential implications for Nigeria, and will dialogue with the Government in that respect, 
drawing on the WB’s strategy for Sahel and the commitment of the Nigeria Government and 
ECOWAS member states to promote peace and security in the Sahel. 
135. Gaps in capacity, especially at the sub-national level, and institutional weaknesses 
continue to pose challenges to the successful implementation of the CPS program:  The 
increasingly transformative nature of the program pushes the boundaries of public sector 
expertise and brings to light systemic issues that pose challenges to successful implementation, 
such as lack of coherent approach to monitoring and evaluation, contract and project 

47 

 
management, and effective use of resources. Continuing attention will be needed to support 
implementation of institutional reforms, adequate staffing, regulatory strengthening, and 
practices and systems for better project management. Likewise, the Bank remains vigilant as 
regards corruption risks to the implementation of its portfolio. New projects will seek to address 
this concern through focused technical assistance, but increased efforts are needed to build 
capacity in local agencies to ensure longer-term sustainability of ongoing projects. Better 
collection of data is critical to effective and evidence-based monitoring and evaluation, which in 
turn helps strengthen the focus on results. 
136. Finally, the lack of clarity regarding the preparation of the Government’s external 
borrowing plan and delays in its approval could pose risks to successful implementation of 
the CPS. The WB will manage these risks by engaging with the Government on how best to 
align its annual assistance cycle with the Government’s processes and practices for external 
borrowing. In addition, as part of its strategy to reach out to its main stakeholders, the WB will 
deepen its engagement with the National Assembly, particularly the committees in charge of aid 
and donor agencies. Most of the FY14 operations are already approved in the 2013 Borrowing 
Plan. The remaining ones will be submitted in the 2014 Borrowing Plan with the 2014 Budget.

deficiencies in the large scale

productivity, notably in northern 
Nigeria where the bulk of Nigeria’s 
dam and irrigation infrastructure is 
located.  
Inadequate transportation networks

Poor roads infrastructure makes it 
difficult to access urban and

ANNEX 5: STRENGTHENING STATISTICS IN NIGERIA - A 
SUGGESTED PATH FORWARD 

1. 
The long-term goal of Nigeria’s national statistical system is to evolve into a system 
that delivers timely, reliable and relevant information about the demographic, social, 
economic and environmental conditions of the country to citizens, businesses, Governments, 
institutions and other interested parties. To be useful, such information must not only be 
regularly available and credible; it must also be consistent. In particular, Nigeria’s determination 
to implement the Transformation Agenda and, beyond and achieve the goal of Vision 20:2020 
would be aided substantially by adequately planned and implemented statistical information, 
which the National Statistical System (NSS) has to provide on a sustained fashion.  
2. 
Following a long period of decline, the capacity of the National Statistical System is 
being rebuilt to enable it to discharge its core functions, and progress has been made in 
several areas. With support from Statistical projects including the Trust Fund for Statistical 
Capacity Building, the Statistics for Results Facility (SRF) and the LSMS-ISA, as well as other 
Bank and donor (UN, EU, DFID, AfDB, and USAID) projects with statistical sub-components, 
the national and sub-national statistical systems have been strengthened, with noticeable 
improvements in data collection, processing, management and dissemination as well as in the 
legal and institutional framework, in staff professionalism, and, to a lesser extent, in the 
coordination of the NSS.  
3. 
Results include passage of the Statistics Act at Federal level in 2007 and Statistics Edict in 
21 states of the Federation; the preparation and implementation of the National Strategy for the 
Development of Statistics (NSDS) 2010-2014 at Federal level, and 23 State Statistical Master 
Plans at state level; the revamping of statistical dissemination tools (websites, yearbooks) at 
federal and state levels; the publication of backlogged statistical products such as state statistical 
yearbooks and sector statistics reports; and deployment of a release calendar. Better coordination 
of the system, at both vertical and horizontal levels, and better donor coordination for enhanced 
aid effectiveness for statistical development in Nigeria, was also promoted by SRF. 
4. 
In 2011, 
the Government prepared 
the 2012-2014 Corporate Strategic 
Implementation Plan (CSIP) to operationalize the NSDS and provide an overarching 
framework for the development and ownership of statistics in Nigeria. The CSIP provides a 
mechanism for a comprehensive reform of the NSS as an integrated, unified data production 
system. It brings together all agencies involved in data production across the three tiers of 
Government and engages all major statistical stakeholders as well as policy makers. The NSDS 
and CSIP are a major attempt to modernize the institutional framework for the production, use, 
and dissemination of statistics in Nigeria including better coordination of the statistical system, 
both horizontally and vertically.  
5. Notwithstanding the recent progress, important constraints hinder the production, 
quality and dissemination of data, which need to be addressed so that the NSS can effectively 
play its role in supporting the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of 
development policies at the national and subnational levels.  
6. 
First, strategic planning and implementation for statistics needs to be improved. The 
results obtained to date in the implementation of the NSDS have been rather limited. Despite an 
implementation plan, the strategy was too broad in scope and over ambitious, paid little 

63 

 
consideration for available resources, lacked a clear advocacy strategy, and a credible financing 
plan. Ideally, the implementation of the NSDS required that the Government ensure a sustainable 
and predictable flow of budgetary resources for statistical development independently of political 
interests. This has not been consistently the case, although the Government made an effort during 
2012 to raise the capital budget of NBS. Moreover, no monitoring and evaluation system was set 
up to regularly assess implementation of the NSDS.  
7. 
Second, organization of data production and dissemination needs more coherence 
and accountability. Critical core sector statistics, macro-economic and poverty data remain 
relatively scarce, old and of uncertain quality. For example, while a cursory look at Nigeria 
surveys systems indicate a large volume of data being produced (see Table 1), household and 
economic surveys are conducted sporadically, depending on the availability of donor funding; 
and, when conducted, results are not rapidly disseminated. Moreover, the metadata, the 
information about the methods used to produce the data, is insufficient to ensure transparency 
about the quality of the data. This has created over time a vicious cycle where the limited 
availability and uncertain quality of official statistics has led to a low demand for data by policy 
makers at all levels. In turn, the underfunding of the NSS by the Government is impeding 
improvements in the quality of data produced by the NSS. To many users of Nigerian statistics, 
data availability and quality are still lagging behind.  
8. 
Third, financial and technical support for the NSS between the Government and 
development partners as well as among development partners has not been well 
coordinated. In the past few years, as development partners stepped up their engagement, the 
Government drastically reduced the capital budget for statistical production. While the recurrent 
budget more than doubled in 2011 to reach US$24 million compared with the US$11 million 
provided yearly during 2006-2010capital budget for NBS declined steadily during the same 
period, from close to US$4 million in 2008 to barely US$1 million in 2011. This has made the 
statistical system highly dependent on donor funding for its development and this is not 
sustainable. As a result, realizing that the current model of financial support for statistical 
development has major deficiencies, development partners are becoming increasingly reluctant 
to maintain their support for statistics. Consequently, Nigerian statistics are under threat; and 
some of the most important new instruments introduced in recent years (for example, the GHS-
panel survey for monitoring household behavior and welfare) risk being discontinued due to lack 
of resources.  
9. 
Fourth, Nigeria is a three-tiered Federation, and this adds a layer of complexity to the 
functioning of the national statistical system. Nigerian statistics – demographic, social and 
economic – are produced by multiple actors at the Federal and state level, which means that 
effective coordination is essential for the production of harmonized data. At the Federal level, the 
apex organization, since the passing of the Statistics Act in 2007, is NBS. Other important 
players include the National Population Commission (NPopC), which has formal responsibility 
for population and demographic statistics, including carrying out the population and housing 
census; and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), responsible for financial and monetary statistics. 
The Departments of Planning, Research and Statistics of the Ministries, Departments and 
Agencies (MDAs) are responsible, under the methodological guidance of NBS, for the 
compilation and dissemination of statistics in their areas of competence. In general, the statistical 
units in the MDAs are not properly set up, are under-resourced, and have very limited capacity to 
undertake the required data production and dissemination activities. There is a similar statistical 

64 

 
structure at state level. However, for each state, in addition to the state-level replication of the 
Federal level structure, there is either a State Statistical Agency (SSA) or a State Bureau of 
Statistics (SBS), depending on the legal structure. All this leads to a poorly functioning statistical 
system competing for the same scarce resources. 
10. 
In response to the recent increased demand for credible statistics on Nigeria, the 
Government has requested the WB’s assistance to strengthen the implementation of the 
NSDS. This provides the opportunity for a bold and effective transformational approach, 
including a comprehensive review of the production of Nigeria core statistics and stronger 
coordination of donor support, to place the NSS on the path to world-class statistics provider.  
11. The main beneficiaries of the planned support are the users and producers of 
statistics on Nigeria. These include: (I) NBS; ii) NPopC; iii) SSAs and SBSs, (iv) MDAs; (v) 
policy makers and planners; (vi) Parliament; (vii) non-state actors (viii) the private sector; and 
(viii) researchers. The Bank and other development partners’ support have a better chance of 
success if it focuses on four core areas: 
 Strategy built on core products: The main objective will be to support the NSS to define a 
brand, of core economic and social statistics products, with a clear roles and 
responsibilities, defined time table of production, and dissemination plans. 
 Support to the Strategy of Financing Statistics, possibly through innovative financing 
models such as P4R or results buy-down. Since frequently inadequate, unpredictable and 
donor-dependent financing is a major contributor to dysfunctional data production 
systems, it is crucial that the financing model aligns incentives for better results. 
 Technical support to production and dissemination of statistics produced through (a)better 
documentation of methodologies; (b) alignment of national methodologies with 
international standards and concepts; (c) professionalization of staff in NBS and other 
statistical agencies in Nigeria to ensure sustained implementation of methodologies;  (d) 
improved coordination between the different components of the NSS for enhanced 
statistical production and dissemination. 
 Strong Partnerships. The Bank is strongly committed to the Partnership approach. The 
Development Partners objective is to maximize the impact of Development Partners’ 
support in improving production and use of M&E and statistics in Nigeria. The group’s 
priority work plan for the period 2012-14 emphasizes support for initiatives that will have 
as priority outcome the enhancement of the quality of core statistics including national 
accounts, health and education, at the federal and sub-national levels.

ANNEX 6: GOVERNANCE APPROACH 

1. 
In order to scale up reform initiatives and support Nigeria in accelerating poverty 
reduction, the Bank will mainstream a governance approach across the portfolio. Based on 
the Bank’s recent review of the portfolio through a governance lens, it is clear that the Bank can 
identify and support pockets of capability, as well as promote socially inclusive coalitions for 
reform that can reduce the potential for conflict and accompany Nigeria on a path of long term 
institution building. Under the past CPS, the Bank fostered a number of reform dialogues 
through a proactive use of its knowledge role with decision makers and state governors, as well 
as other stakeholders. The recent client survey underlines the need for the Bank to do more of 
this. A number of sector teams also used their relationships and knowledge to support reform 
minded teams, including in the energy, health and agriculture sector. The Bank will continue to 
mainstream its use of political economy and governance tools to further mainstream the potential 
to scale up success across the portfolio. State level DPLs have proved effective in supporting 
reform minded leadership, as well as setting in place good governance building blocks. The Bank 
will continue to seek state level interaction through its portfolio and will pursue the opportunity 
to increase competition around performance through a state level performance index. Finally, the 
Bank will roll out the recently designed Governance, Conflict and Gender filter across the 
portfolio, staring in FY14, and the recently constituted Governance Consultative Group will 
continue to provide real time advice on local contexts to management and task teams.  
2. Against this background, the objective of the Governance Approach for the Nigeria 
WB country team is to improve the development effectiveness of WB operations and take 
steps to enhance the enabling environment for good governance in the country. Knowledge 
products and policy dialogue will be used to improve the understanding of governance and 
political economy constraints to development. This understanding will guide the Bank’s 
engagement (including in particular lending/credit operations). A two-pronged strategy seeks to 
make incremental gains through the Bank’s portfolio in the short to medium-term, while using 
demand for good governance entry points and a more proactive convening and communication 
role to improve the overall environment in the long term. This approach allows the Bank to build 
on its recent global move to incorporate upstream governance analysis around projects, learn 
from and scale-up its cross-sectoral approach to good governance, apply a more systematic and 
predictable governance lens to the preparation of all products, and promote greater transparency 
and issues-based debates in the country.55 
3. 
The Governance Approach sets out a number of analyses and processes to strengthen 
the potential that projects contribute to concrete outcomes. This will be done through: 
 An improved understanding of “macro level” political economy issue: through 1) an 
enhanced literature review of governance and political economy in Nigeria, 2) a review 
and assessment of the Banks previous use of political economy analysis and governance 
engagement including DFGG, and 3) an analysis of the drives of successful and non-
successful reforms in the country.  
 Support to task teams throughout the project cycle through a Governance, Gender 
and Conflict Filter for all operations augmenting preparation of investment operations

Bank, 2012.  

67 

 
                                                 
with political economy analysis where appropriate.  
 Increased outreach, consultation and external guidance to the Bank in order to 
enhance the flow of information on relevant development issues, while enabling the 
Bank country team to update and evolve its thinking on relevant political economy 
issues.  

4. At the time of the presentation of the CPS, the analytical work was at an advanced 
stage of preparation and the findings have informed the strategy. An external Governance 
Consultation Group has been established and met on several operations. The Filter has been 
developed and piloted on two operations. 

The Approach is illustrated in the figure below: 

68 

 
 
 
 
 
5. 
The aim of the Filter is to support the country team in understanding key (formal and 
informal) institutional arrangements and funding flows to improve their capacity to 
achieve results throughout the project cycle. It also aims at helping the teams to assess the 
political feasibility of suggested reforms to be supported in proposed projects, identify the level 
of governance, conflict and gender risks that the project is likely to face and appropriate 
mitigation measures and inform sector and country management decisions on new projects 
taking into account the expected risks and possible mitigation measures.  
The Filter will be implemented in a phased manner: 
 As a first step, all new projects under preparation will be supported with a filter at an early 
stage pre-PCN/PCN stage. These projects will also be monitored through the filter during 
ISRs. The filter will be rolled out more comprehensively across the project and ESW 
cycle, after the pilot is concluded.  
 The filter will be open ended but will ask teams to submit a template prior to the PCN 
review, addressing: (i) the fiduciary arrangements for the project including institutional 
arrangements, funding flows and procurement capacity, (ii) conflict, gender and 
institutional and governance lessons from previous operations, (iii) additional analysis of 
3 areas: a) the political economy and reform environment, b) delivery incentives and 
accountability lines for different levels of counterparts, c) possibilities for transparency 
and engagement of  demand side actors. 
 This information will help task teams to prepare the ORAF at the Decision Meeting with 
an opinion submitted to SD and whether risks are sufficiently identified and mitigated. 
 The team will receive guidance NGAG will propose governance indicators that should be 
monitored throughout project implementation. 
 Teams that undertake additional analytical work will prepare governance annexes 
summarizing the findings 
 This pilot approach will be reviewed in December 2013, and findings from analytical 
work, as well as pilot, incorporated. 
6. 
The proposed analytical work will inform the Filter which will be adjusted on an 
ongoing basis as the understanding of the governance challenges improve. The Governance 
Consultation Group is primarily a sounding board for the Country Management Unit Leadership 
Team but will equally inform the evolving design of the filter. Project teams will therefore, as a 
general rule, not approach the Consultation Group directly on project related issues.

ANNEX 7:  FY10-13 JOINT COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
COMPLETION REPORT FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA 

I. 

Executive Summary 

1. 
This CPS Completion Report assesses the performance of the second joint Nigeria 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)56 for FY10-13, discussed by the Board of Executive 
Directors on July 29, 2009. It describes the relevance, achievements and effectiveness of the 
FY10-13 support and articulates lessons for developing the next Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) for FY14-17. The CPS was prepared against the backdrop of two challenges facing 
Nigeria: (a) the need to overcome the effects of the global economic crisis; and (b) the need to 
sustain non-oil growth and develop human capital over the medium term. The core issue of 
governance underpinned both challenges. At the end of the CPS period, Nigeria’s economy 
continues to be vulnerable to oil price shocks, and faces three major challenges: (a) translating 
growth into job opportunities, particularly for youth; (b) addressing increasing social and 
regional disparities; and (c) addressing political challenges and reducing the security threat in the 
North. 
2. 
The report assesses overall progress toward achieving CPS outcomes as moderately 
satisfactory, and WB performance as moderately satisfactory. The CPS program achieved 
sixteen (16) of the twenty-five (25) planned outcomes. Activities under the non-oil growth pillar 
supported transformational reforms, particularly in the agriculture and energy sectors, where 
technical support and policy dialogue helped generate broad consensus on and momentum for 
the reform agenda. The governance pillar, a core aspect of the program, also demonstrated 
remarkable achievement towards expected outcomes. Progress under the sustainable human 
development pillar was slower, but laid the foundation for results-based activities during the next 
CPS period. On WB performance, the clear alignment of the CPS design with the Government’s 
priorities; the WB’s effectiveness in adapting to changing country conditions and unanticipated 
risks; its strength in leveraging partnerships; and its intensive program delivery structure and 
well-organized portfolio 
implementation support were strong achievements. However, 
implementation challenges with two projects contributed to the moderately satisfactory 
performance rating.  
3. 
Important lessons were learned during the implementation period: First, a deeper 
understanding of the political economy and needs of various levels of Government is needed to 
function effectively in Nigeria’s complex governance setting. This will be a critical element in 
deepening the Bank’s engagement with a strategic set of stakeholders during the next assistance 
period. Second, 
improving selectivity and simplifying project design will enhance 
implementation progress and make it easier to achieve expected outcomes. Finally, a finer 
balance and synergy of reform efforts between the Federal and State levels is needed to enhance 
development outcomes. 

56 The strategy was prepared with the UK Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), and the African Development Bank (AfDB).

II. Progress toward Development Outcomes 

4. During the CPS period, Nigeria made progress in three key areas aligned with its 
development goals: (a) macroeconomic management, toward the goals of improving 
Government performance and achieving sustainable and broad-based growth; (b) structural 
reforms, to improve critical infrastructure, the investment climate, and food security; and (c) 
security in the Niger Delta, which both the Government and the partners considered necessary 
for the success of the program, although other unanticipated security threats arose during the 
CPS period.  
Macroeconomic management  
5. Nigeria experienced stable economic growth averaging over 7 percent over the CPS 
period. 57 The Government used part of its US$22 billion in fiscal reserves (Excess Crude 
Account, ECA) to offset the sharp decline in oil revenues during the 2008-2009 global crisis 
which helped to maintain economic growth from 6 percent in 2008 to 7 percent in 2009. 
However, despite the recovery in oil prices in 2010, Nigeria expanded its fiscal stimulus which 
kept growth at 7.9 percent, but nearly exhausted the fiscal reserve while keeping the balance of 
payments in deficit and inflation in double digits. Efforts to rein in excessive fiscal expansion 
started in 2011. Despite the upheaval of January 2012,58 the Government managed to reduce the 
weight of oil subsidy payments which along with other real spending cuts contributed to the 
general Government budget deficit falling from 5.7 percent in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2012. 
6. Macroeconomic risks remain significant, but the short and medium term outlook is 
generally positive. The pace of GDP growth is expected to pick up somewhat in 2013; the 
inflation rate, in double digits in recent years, fell from 12 percent in 2012 to 9 percent in 2013 
and should continue to decline. The balance of payments should remain strong, at least in the 
short term.59  The risk of an oil price shock is still high, given that the ECA balance is now about 
US$4.88 billion. An unexpected decline in crude oil output has tightened the budgetary situation 
and increased the medium-term balance of payments risk. In addition, the fiscal burden of the 
subsidy60 is still significant and could become unsustainable as Nigeria faces the prospect of 
diminishing oil revenues relative to GDP. Investments in the oil sector that could have ensured 
strong medium-term growth in the sector have been delayed pending the passage of the 
Petroleum Industry Bill, which the National Assembly has been debating for a number of years. 
7. Although oil receipts account for 90 percent of Nigeria’s export revenue and 75 
percent of its budget revenue, real GDP growth is mostly supported by the non-oil sector, 
and non-oil GDP will remain the main engine of growth. Since early 2000, expansion of the 
service sector has been at the fore-front of Nigeria’s economic diversification. Public investment 
and a growing middle class should continue to support rapid growth in the coming years. To help 
strengthen the underlying structure of the Nigerian economy, the Government started increasing 
the relative share of capital spending in the budget within the CPS period. In the longer term, this

58 Public reaction to removal of fuel subsidy. 
59 The balance of payments has mostly been in surplus since the fourth quarter of 2011, allowing authorities to increase gross 
monetary foreign reserves from US$32 billion in September 2011 to US$48 billion in May 2013. 
60 The fuel subsidy accounted for 4.6 percent and 2.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Although the Government’s 
bid in January 2011 to entirely eliminate the fuel subsidy resulted in civil unrest and a national strike, a compromise solution was 
eventually proposed with a lower increase of the enforced fixed naira price for petrol.

trend should sustain considerable capital expenditure growth. Transport 
infrastructure 
development and power supply projects will be the main areas of attention and will boost 
Government expenditure, investments and jobs over the coming decade. However, Nigeria will 
have to overcome economic and institutional challenges, such as infrastructure bottlenecks and a 
weak climate for doing business, in order to promote more inclusive economic growth and 
employment and sustain improvements in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
Social Outcomes 
8. However, growth has not been inclusive and has not triggered significant poverty 
reduction. The poverty headcount in Nigeria declined marginally from 48.4 percent in 2003-
2004 to 46 percent in 2009-2010.61 Considering the high population growth rate, the number of 
Nigerians living in poverty has increased from 60 to 75 million within 5 years. While poverty 
seems to have declined faster in the coastal south and around the Federal Capital Abuja, the 
North-East appears to have experienced a significant increase in poverty. Furthermore, 
unemployment has shown little improvement. In fact, formal unemployment grew from 19.7 to 
23.9 percent between 2009 and 2011; and youth unemployment (ages 15-24) rose from 25 to 
37.7 percent,62 with a concomitant increase in the risk of social unrest.  
Structural reforms 
9. 
The banking system was strengthened and the stability of the financial system was 
maintained in the face of the 2008-09 fiscal crisis. By 2012, the sector had been recapitalized 
and governance had significantly improved. As of end-2011, gross financial system assets were 
equivalent to 61 percent of GDP, with banks and pension funds comprising 79 and 12 percent, 
respectively, of total system assets. However, further deepening of the sector through access to 
long-term financing is essential to unlock nascent markets. While bank lending is heavily 
concentrated on the larger corporations and their supplier value chains, longer-term finance is 
largely absent from the sector, and this gap is significantly hampering Nigeria’s economic 
growth potential.  
10. The country made significant progress toward major structural reforms. In the power 
sector, the Government made substantial progress on the implementation of a Presidential 
Roadmap to Power Sector Reform and a Gas Master Plan. These initiatives established a 
commercial framework for domestic gas-to-power sales; allowed for the privatization or private 
management of generation, transmission and distribution utilities; and established a cost-
reflective tariff. Secondly, agriculture has been identified as a key engine of growth under the 
new Agriculture Transformation Agenda (ATA), initiated by the new Government elected in 
2011 which desires more focus on agriculture to ensure food security and more equitable growth. 
First steps include reorganization of the fertilizer and seed sectors, the improvement of market 
institutions, and efforts to set up processing zones to attract the private sector.  
Political and security challenges 
11. The CPS period was marked by political changes and security challenges. The CPS 
saw Nigeria’s third consecutive civil president in the 2011 general elections, which were 
considered historically one of the fairest but were also highly contested in the North, where the

post-election upheaval claimed hundreds of lives. Security became a growing concern in many 
parts of the country, exacerbated by North-South religious and ethnic tensions. While the 
Government’s successful amnesty program for combatants in the Niger Delta Region led to a 
drastic reduction in attacks on oil pipelines and kidnappings of foreign oil workers, the 
unexpected rise in bombings in the North, abductions and organized crime in the South-East, and 
sporadic but vicious communal conflict in the Middle Belt exacerbated challenges for the 
Government. Most recently, the Government declared a state of emergency in three Northern 
states to curtail the violence and insurgency acts of Boko Haram.  

III. CPS Program Performance  

12. The evaluation of program performance, summarized in Annex 1, is based on the outcomes 
and indicators in the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR), which reflects the revisions to the CPS 
program requested by the new Government elected in 2011. The CPSPR annexes 3-1 to 3-10 
present detailed subprogram reviews and assessments for each of the sectors and main areas of 
engagement. Overall, program performance is assessed to be moderately satisfactory: the 
program achieved good progress toward most major expected outcomes, and no major 
shortcomings were identified. Significant progress was achieved under all three pillars, and 
outcomes were quite solid for 16 of the 25 indicators. Overall, the results for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 
were partially achieved, and results for Pillar 3 were achieved. 

C.1 Pillar 1:  Achieving Sustainable and Inclusive Non-Oil Growth 
13. Substantial results were realized in power generation capacity and transmission efficiency, 
road network conditions, environmental and climate change management, and in the financial 
system. Of these outcomes, three (power generation, transmission efficiency and road network 
conditions) were key elements that addressed infrastructure deficits and have a cross-cutting 
impact on all other aspects of non-oil growth. Majority of business owners in Nigeria consider 
poor supply of electricity the biggest challenge to doing business63 and the poor condition of 
roads is one of the factors that discourages foreign investors.64 These outcomes also rose from a 
substantially low base to attain the planned targets, demonstrating that substantial investments in 
these areas, if channeled right, has potential for achieving strong results. The achievements in the 
environment and financial system outcomes also had significant effects on enhancing capacity 
and establishing a policy base in key institutions, where formerly none existed.  
14. Expected outcomes in public transportation, urban water supply, PPPs and agricultural 
productivity were partially achieved, though targets were close to being met, with very minor 
shortcomings. The non-achievement of planned improvement in business environment was 
mainly due to the late start off of the GEM project and a shortcoming in the design of the 
indicator which covered the entire country whereas the Bank only focused on selected states. 

Increased access to critical physical infrastructure   

15. Putting the power reform back on track:  The program’s leveraging of private sector 
financing for power generation and distribution reduced the need for public spending in the 
sector, enabling more public funds to be directed to other Vision 20:2020 priorities. The Bank’s

investment and technical support for the power sector reform contributed to the following 
notable achievements:  
 Development of a commercial framework for domestic gas-to-power sales, supported by 
partial risk guarantees (PRGs) totaling US$400 million for the Nigeria Electricity and 
Gas Improvement Project (NEGIP), which helped to significantly increase gas-based 
generation capacity;  
 Implementation in June 2012 of a cost-reflective multi-year tariff order (MYTO2), which 
was instrumental in attracting private investment for the privatization of state generation 
and distribution utilities, which reached its final stages in early 2013; 
 Effectiveness of a three-year contract with Manitoba Hydro International (MHI) for 
management of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN); and  
 Launch of an Energy Business Plan (EBP) developed jointly by IDA/IBRD, IFC and 
MIGA to help mobilize private investment in new generation capacity totaling 1,500 
MW, for the benefit of independent power producers (IPPs).  
16. 
Improved road network conditions:  Support to the transport sector resulted in an 
increase in the number of rural and federal roads rehabilitated to good or fair condition, as well 
as improved road safety. The introduction of output and performance-based approaches for road 
rehabilitation and maintenance took time to materialize,65 and is now being implemented on a 
smaller scale than originally envisaged by the authorities. Progress on road sector governance 
has been slower than anticipated, as a draft legal framework for management of the federal 
highway system is still being debated. 
17. 
Improved public transport services in Lagos state:  The remarkable improvement in 
public transport management capacity in Lagos state is attributable to the Bank’s sustained 
technical assistance to the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). 
Established under the first Lagos Urban Transport Project and strengthened under the follow-on 
project, LAMATA was recently selected by the World Bank Institute’s (WBI’s) Knowledge Hub 
Community of Practice (CoP) to participate in peer-to-peer learning with other transport agencies 
that are also functioning as regional hubs.  

Sustainable agriculture development and market access  
18. 
Improved agricultural productivity: In the agriculture sector, the community-driven 
development (CDD) approach increased the productivity and income of beneficiary farmers in 
every state, providing a model that could potentially be scaled up by Government. The spatial 
analysis conducted by the Bank will be a tool for aligning infrastructure investment with 
agriculture programs, with a view to improving rural access and regional connectivity and 
stimulating product diversification and job creation. When the new Government defined its 
Agriculture Transformation Agenda (ATA), which aims to position agriculture as an engine of 
growth, the Bank responded by adding an Agricultural Development Policy Operation (DPO) to 
the CPS program to support policy reforms aimed at improving farmers’ access to improved 
technologies, inputs, and markets.  
19. 
Improved environmental and climate change management: The capacity for 
environmental management has improved at all levels. WBG supported development of two key 

65 Due to the need for more preparation to address contractual risk sharing, financing, and the overall readiness of contractors and 
government agencies to implement these innovative approaches

elements of an early warning system for coastal disaster risk management, and helped to 
strengthen environmental planning at the community level. The Bank also worked with the EC, 
DFID, UN and other partners to conduct a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) after the 
devastating floods of 2012; and this PDNA is now providing the framework for long-term 
reconstruction and resilience efforts. Finally, the Bank team’s climate risk analysis provided 
adaptation options for the country’s agriculture, water resource, and energy sectors. The report’s 
recommendations are already being applied in the agriculture sector. 
Improved investment climate and financial system 
20. 
Improved business environment:  Expected improvements in the business environment 
were not fully realized: the Medium, Small and Micro Enterprise (MSME) project aimed at 
providing entrepreneurs in three states (Abia, Lagos and Kaduna) with increased access to 
financial services; and the DFID-funded, Bank-executed Investment Climate Project (ICP) aimed 
at reducing selected investment climate barriers that constrained firm performance in four states 
(Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, and Cross River). Targets were only partially achieved, with only two of 
the four ICP states (Kano and Cross River) having improved the ease of starting a business, and 
only two of the three MSME states (Kaduna and Lagos) having improved contract 
enforcement.66 Ministerial commitment to federal-level reforms has now been secured, and the 
WB and DFID are providing technical support to the Federal Doing Business and 
Competitiveness Council, established following a high-level workshop on business climate 
reform in January 2012. 
21. Maintaining confidence and stability in the financial system:   Overall, assistance to the 
Government and Central Bank achieved its objectives of maintaining confidence and stability in 
the financial system, and strengthening the banking system. Support to help manage the recovery 
from the global crisis began with a DPO in 2009 aimed at strengthening regulation and 
supervision in the banking sector. Bank restructuring began in the second half of 2009 and was 
consolidated during the CPS period; and since 2011, Nigeria’s financial system has been stable 
and the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of banks has remained above 15 percent. By the end of the 
CPS period, 
the Nigerian banking sector was recapitalized, and 
the 
incentives and 
responsibilities of commercial banks significantly improved. In 2012, the Bank and IMF 
prepared a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) which focused on winding down the 
bank restructuring agency, the Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) and 
reforming the framework for development finance. At the request of the Government, the Bank 
and IMF also prepared an Infrastructure Finance Note exploring options for involving domestic 
financial institutions in infrastructure public-private partnerships (PPPs). This Note and the 
FSAP will form the basis for Bank Group support to the financial sector under the next CPS. 
22. 
Increased number of public-private partnerships:  Efforts to increase PPP were only 
partially successful. The Privatization Project under the first CPS had helped to move the 
Government toward adoption of a National Policy on PPP under the 2010-2013 CPS. A PPP 
operation approved in March 2011 aimed at encouraging private investment in Nigeria’s core 
infrastructure sectors; however, the operation faced some implementation challenges, including 
the preference of a number of new ministers for a public investment scheme, leading to a dearth 
of bankable projects, as initially envisioned. On the other hand, the Bank’s efforts to help

helped to boost the confidence of private investors and mobilize financing for privatization.  

C.2 Pillar 2:  Human Development 
23. The Bank achieved significant results in improving health sector development; community 
development and social protection and; in post-basic education outcomes. Conversely, 
achievements were modest in improving access to malaria health care services and in enhancing 
the quality of basic education. Merging the demand side activities with the supply aspects and 
the technical capacity of the implementing agencies in the malaria program at state level 
contributed to the considerable short-fall in implementation outcomes. The quality of basic 
education was impacted by the low achievements in the transition rates and the math and literacy 
scores of grade 4 students in the states that participated in SESP. 
24. The Bank took a system-strengthening approach to improving access, quality, and 
equity in health and education. Interventions specifically targeted improvements in quality and 
access to maternal and child health services, quality of basic education, and access to post-basic 
education; as well as the utilization of services by the extreme poor and vulnerable. Results in 
the areas of health and education were partially achieved; and outcomes under the equitable 
utilization of human development services were achieved. 

Improved health care services 
25. Health sector development:  A review of the Health System Fund Project and the Second 
Health System Development Project (HSPD 2) found that (a) large-scale, input-based approaches 
rarely translate into improvements in health services; (b) failure to consistently address key 
governance issues such as accountability, incentives, and management impede progress even 
when inputs are available; and (c) lack of attention to monitoring and evaluation is a critical 
barrier to success. In response to these lessons, the new Government developed the Saving One 
Million Lives (SOML) initiative, which takes a strategic approach to implementing high- impact, 
evidence-based, cost-effective public health interventions, building on the performance-based 
financing approach piloted under the ongoing Nigeria State Health Investment Project (NSHIP). 
26. The HSDP 2 supported the Ministry of Health in producing a policy document on 
PPPs in health care delivery. The new Government is also working to attract private 
investments to the sector and several states are now using the innovative models proposed in the 
policy document to structure health care investments, with IFC support.  
27. The CPS contributed significantly to progress in polio eradication. As of June 14, 
2013, 28 states have been polio free for one year, and coverage of oral polio vaccine (OPV) in 
Northern endemic states increased from 44 to 90 percent during the project period (spanning 
CPS 1 and 2). 67 The intensive vaccination efforts, strengthening of the disease surveillance 
system, rigorous monitoring, and regular reviews of progress, which depended on collaboration 
among Government, the World Health Organization (WHO), and faith and community-based 
organizations, were instrumental in achieving the CPS targets. 

67 The buy-down arrangement of the Bank’s Polio Project enabled the financing and delivery of OPV without delays for the 
period.

28. The Bank has made the response to HIV/AIDS more effective and evidence-based. 
Bank interventions 68 helped to stabilize the HIV epidemic by: (a) strengthening prevention 
efforts aimed at the most at-risk persons, such as commercial sex workers; (b) carrying out an 
epidemiological analysis to identify states with the highest HIV prevalence rates; (c) increasing 
access to critical HIV-related services such as prevention of mother to child transmission 
(PMTCT); and (d) strengthening the institutions responsible for coordinating programs at 
national and state levels.69   

Improved quality of basic and post-basic education  
29. As in the health sector, lessons in the education sector are driving the Bank’s 
transition from the financing of inputs to the achievement of outcomes. The positive 
experience and lessons from the devolution of decision-making and financial resources to the 
school level through School Development Grants supported by the State Education Sector 
Project (SESP) laid the groundwork for introducing two performance and results-based 
operations: The Lagos Eko Project, which featured competitive funding and performance 
incentives;  and the State Education Programmatic Investment Program (SEPIP), approved last 
year for implementation during the next CPS period, which will make disbursements to three 
states contingent on their achievement of indicators for increased teacher effectiveness, increased 
school-level effectiveness and management accountability, and 
international 
learning 
benchmarks.  
30. Nigeria’s competitiveness has been constrained by limited opportunities for post-
basic education and training, particularly in science and technology. The CPS supported 
Government efforts to expand access to post-basic education, primarily through the Lagos Eko 
Project and the Science and Technology Education Post-Basic (STEP-B), which, like Eko, 
featured competitive funding and performance incentives. The outcomes were quite compelling: 
senior secondary school students’ grades in Lagos state surpassed expectations, and the 
proportion of students obtaining grade B and above in science and technology was more than 
double the CPS target. There are also ongoing efforts focused on skills development and 
improvement; and an ongoing analytical study of skills development for the new economy will 
be completed during the next CPS period.  

Equitable utilization of HD services  
31. The Bank’s aid to human development (HD) increased the equitable utilization of HD 
services by the extreme poor and vulnerable in rural communities, and access to social and 
natural resource infrastructure services in 27 states (see Annex 1). The achievements exceeded 
the target by 600 percent, and produced far-reaching benefits in terms of school enrollment of 
poor children, access to improved water sources, and access to health care. Beneficiaries of the 
Community and Social Development Project (CSDP) were selected through a demand-driven, 
participatory and transparent process that ensured inclusion of the poorest communities. The 
project generated increased participation and transparency at the community level, and 
strengthened community organization processes. Participating local community groups and local 

68 The Government received US$225 million under the Second HIV/AIDS Program Development Project (HPDP 2), in addition 
to the US$150 million provided under HPDP 1 (2002-2012). 
69 The Bank facilitated the transition of the National and State Action Committees for AIDS (NACAs and SACAs) to official 
AIDS control agencies, which have their own budget lines and serve as channels for donor AIDS prevention and control 
resources. 

77 

 
                                                 
and state authorities have now started to commit their own resources to community-level 
planning. The challenge during the next CPS will be to empower local Governments to support 
more community-led development.  

C.3 Pillar 3: Governance for Results 
32. The majority of the outcomes under pillar 3 were achieved especially considering the 
strengthening of PFM systems, improved integrity in payroll and personnel control mechanisms 
in the civil service and the effectiveness of anti-corruption institutions. These advances were the 
resultant effects of the technical assistance and financial aid provided by the Bank. 
Notwithstanding, escalating governance results and scaling up reforms continue to be a challenge 
because of Nigeria’s complex demographic, geographic and political context. For this reason, the 
new CPS proposes to approach governance as a cross-cutting theme through system-wide 
improvements in PFM, technical assistance to improve the selectivity of public investments and 
by improving quality and access to data for decision making.  
33. Most CPS indicators were met and notable results were achieved under this pillar. 
The Bank continued interventions aimed at improving public financial management (PFM) 
institutions and systems at the Federal level, and deepened engagement at state level. Key 
achievements included strengthening the legislative framework for PFM; introducing automated 
treasury systems at the Federal level and in some states; and a comprehensive policy dialogue on 
PFM which led to two DPOs in Lagos and Edo states. The Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (PEFA) study, in particular, laid the groundwork for deepening the Bank’s 
engagement in PFM during the next CPS period. In addition, activities to strengthen social 
accountability were piloted, and will be scaled up under the next CPS.  
34. At the Federal level, the Economic Reform and Governance Project (ERGP) 
facilitated improvements in budget planning, implementation, reporting and auditing. The 
project introduced a Government Integrated Financial Management Information System 
(GIFMIS) connecting the central bank and more than 200 Government agencies; strengthened 
the Treasury Single Account (TSA); introduced medium-term sector strategies; and improved 
accounting procedures. The Bank also facilitated a gap analysis of the consistency of 
Government financial reporting with international standards, resulting in the federal and state 
Governments transitioning to International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS)-
compliant financial reporting. 
35. The Bank’s longstanding engagement in procurement reform continued under the 
CPS, with a focus on modernizing the legal framework. As a result, large federal public 
contracts awarded through open competition increased from 30 to 100 percent,70 and the open 
publication of a greater number of federal and state contract awards increased citizens’ access to 
public procurement information and enhanced accountability and transparency. In addition, the 
number of agencies with third-party monitoring of procurement increased from 0 in 2010 at the 
federal and state levels to 28 at the federal and 12 at the state level, respectively. A recently 
established electronic procurement portal by a coalition of civil society organizations (CSOs) has 
further strengthened accountability. These improved practices reduced waste in public 
expenditure at the Federal level by about US$3.7 billion over the CPS period.71

36. The Bank’s state-level engagement helped a number of state Governments to lay out 
a comprehensive framework for PFM. By the end of the CPS period, public expenditure 
management and financial accountability reviews (PEMFARs) had been concluded in more than 
20 states; programmatic integrated fiduciary assessments (PIFAs) had been carried out in six 
states; DPOs were on track to be completed in two states; and four states had successfully 
implemented PFM reforms. The state-level review processes and the credit-funded operations 
have laid the groundwork for a significant scaling up of the governance agenda during the next 
assistance period, when various TA operations supported by the Bank and EC will expand the 
PFM-anchored governance agenda to 21 states.  
37. State-level engagement also resulted in the passage of procurement laws in 24 states; the 
establishment of regulatory agencies in 18 states and of public procurement professional cadres 
in 10 states; preparation of standard bidding documents in three states; and the introduction of a 
procurement planning tool to improve the efficiency of capital budget implementation at the 
Federal level. As a result, public contracts above thresholds awarded through open competition 
increased from 25 to 40 percent.72  
38. The Bank’s support for development of the country’s statistical systems has advanced 
the availability of critical data at the national and sub-national levels. There were noticeable 
improvements in the collection, processing, management and dissemination of data; in the legal 
and institutional framework for management of statistics; and in staff professionalism. However, 
critical sector statistics and macroeconomic and poverty data remain limited and of questionable 
quality and will continue to be improved during the next CPS period. 
39. The Bank tested a number of accountability tools to make the use of public funds 
more transparent. These efforts included: (a) Open Government initiatives at the federal and 
state levels; (b) CSO-led monitoring of social services provision; and (c) beneficiaries’ rights and 
entitlements campaigns, including under the NSHIP. ICT-based feedback and redress 
mechanisms were also tested in selected areas under NSHIP and Fadama III, with beneficiaries 
using mobile phones and web-based technologies to comment on access to service delivery, 
satisfaction, and complaints. These tools were also used in a teacher absenteeism pilot in the 
SEPIP and Edo DPO projects; and for web-based mapping and monitoring of urban violence in 
Benin City. 

IV. WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE 

40. The WB’s performance in the 2010-2013 CPS is rated moderately satisfactory. The 
Bank’s flexible response to the new Government’s priorities made it possible to achieve most 
CPS outcomes, including revised outcomes; and established the basis for an expanded 
partnership during the upcoming CPS period. The CPS program was well aligned with the 
country’s challenges and Government development priorities. It was anchored in the 
Government’s Vision 20:2020 and its Seven Point Agenda, and focused on four sets of 
challenges: (a) offsetting the fiscal impact of the global financial crisis and maintaining the 
momentum of reform; (b) enhancing the competitiveness of the country in order to expand non-
oil growth; (c) building on advances made in health and education service delivery and social 
assistance, to improve human development outcomes; and (d) improving public sector

governance and PFM efficiency at the federal and state levels. The new Government reaffirmed 
these priorities and also introduced a Transformation Agenda and a National Implementation 
Plan (NIP) centred on improving macroeconomic stability, governance, human development, 
infrastructure, agricultural productivity, and the power sector.  

A. Design  

41. The 2010-2013 CPS improved on the design of the earlier CPS in several important 
ways. First, the choice of available lending instruments was significantly expanded. While 
the first CPS offered only investment operations, the second CPS also included DPOs to help the 
Government cope with the global financial crisis; and (after the 2011 election) to support states 
in improving their fiscal and budgetary management.73 It also included partial risk guarantees 
to encourage private sector investment in the energy sector. 
42. The method for selecting target states was also significantly improved. Whereas the 
earlier CPS concentrated resources in a few high-performing states, the selection of states under 
the 2010-13 CPS was based on their needs, existing programs, state-level governance capability 
and commitment, and zonal/geopolitical balance. Lending instruments were also tailored to the 
conditions of each state. The CPS expanded the Bank’s engagement at the state level, thus 
enhancing its impact on MDG-related activities, for which the states are responsible (see section 
III on CPS performance). IDA financing was used mostly to help increase impacts in areas where 
the participation of CPS partners was not deep. As the same time, more effective supervision and 
increased selectivity in operations resulted in improved outcomes. Going forward, to achieve 
some minimum institutional capacity and standards, the Bank will have to balance this approach 
with the need to ensure that regional disparities are reduced. 
43. The WB responded flexibly to Government’s adjusted needs at mid-term review and 
after the 2011 elections. During the mid-term review, a new irrigation project was added; while 
a number of planned projects were scaled up (e.g. erosion and watershed management and youth 
employment). A proposed Malaria II project was dropped, although additional financing for the 
first malaria project was approved. In addition, as the CPS put greater emphasis on evidence-
based and performance-based approaches, two performance-based loans in education and health 
replaced the traditional investment loans earlier envisaged for health, maternal and child health 
and nutrition, and state education. In response to the 2011 new Government’s adjusted priorities, 
namely agriculture, long-term financing and energy, the WB provided significant resources to 
finance the ATA through a DPO and two investment operations (one of which will be delivered 
under the new CPS) and funded a housing finance project to be delivered in Q1-FY14. Finally, 
an additional financing for NEGIP was approved, and a power sector guarantee project was 
added to the pipeline for the next CPS period.  
44. Leveraging partnerships:  The partnership arrangement under the CPS began with four 
partners – DFID, AfDB, USAID and the WB; but eventually expanded to include the EC and 
AFD after 2011. Currently, the Bank is engaged in co-financing arrangements with the EC on 
governance and with AFD on water and transport projects. The Bank also maintains a strong 

73 Although the Bank upheld the plan to utilize state DPOs (SDPOs) in strongly reforming states, and Lagos state successfully 
pioneered the SDPO as planned, it was only able to access the first tranche during the CPS period. The second tranche, scheduled 
for FY12, was stalled because of resistance from some newly elected executive and legislative officials. However, given the 
results achieved, the second Lagos DPO was finally authorized and is expected to be delivered in FY14. 

80 

 
                                                 
partnership with DFID on governance and statistics. DFID has also seconded staff to the Bank to 
support project supervision in the health and Finance and Private Sector Development (FPD) 
sectors. The broadening scope of engagement has led the development partners to establish a 
comprehensive Country Assistance Framework (CAF) for the next assistance period. Under the 
CAF, development partners will agree on modalities to intensify engagement and measure 
impacts in critical areas. Such collaboration is already apparent in Nigeria’s newly launched 
African Health Markets for Equity (AHME) program, jointly funded by DFID and the Gates 
Foundation.  
45. The WB conducted a gender review of the IDA portfolio and building on the Gender 
World Development Report, organized an evidenced-based gender dialogue with DFID covering 
all the geo-political zones, in recognition of the inadequate emphasis on gender in the portfolio. 
These two activities helped design an approach which will be fully integrated in the new CPS.  
46. The CPS was deemed to have met the principle of flexibility and responsiveness in 
responding to Nigeria’s changing environment and needs. However, the 2012 Country 
Opinion Survey 74 carried out as part of stocktaking for the CPS indicated that the Bank’s 
processes, procedures, and instruments will have to be more adaptable, context-specific and 
responsive going forward to respond to Nigeria’s rapidly changing circumstances.  

B. Implementation 

Lending and non-lending support 
47. The indicative amount from IDA over the FY10-13 period was US$5.5 billion, 
compared to actual commitments of US$5.2 billion, or US$350 million less than planned.75 
The IDA portfolio (26 projects) and GEF (4 projects) were well aligned with the Government 
strategy, including the new Government’s Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA). The 
portfolio focused primarily on non-oil growth (57 percent), human development (33 percent), 
and state-level governance (10 percent).  
48. The delays in the approval of the 2012 Borrowing Plan prevented the timely signing 
of agreements related to investments of US$1.57 billion, of which US$160 million was from 
IDA 15. With the recent adoption of the Borrowing Plan and signing of long-pending 
agreements, the WB teams and the client (federal and state) are now working hard to compensate 
for the delays and accelerating implementation of new projects.  
49. The Bank produced a variety of sector work at the country and state level, which 
formed the basis for policy discussions. The Bank prepared studies on fuel subsidies and the 
fiscal management of oil wealth, highlighting major challenges and opportunities. Two other 
important pieces of analytical work, on enhancing resilience to climate change (which was the 
basis for erosion and watershed project and agriculture DPO), and on opportunities for low 
carbon development, were discussed during a workshop in December 2012 with technical 
stakeholders, and afterward during high-level consultations. In Human Development, the Bank 
produced critical work on the quality of primary education, skill gaps, and the status of social 
protection in Nigeria. In addition, the Bank’s poverty profile of Nigeria, developed in 2013 in 

74 December 2012. 
75 As of May 2013, the World Bank Group’s active commitments in Nigeria include US$5.3 billion from IDA, US$1.1 billion 
from IFC, and US$98 million from MIGA. 

81 

 
                                                 
collaboration with the National Bureau of Statistics, will be the foundation for a more detailed 
poverty assessment to be used in the next CPS program. A study was completed on making fiscal 
federalism work for economic development; it will be followed by a deeper study on spatial 
economic development. The Bank also carried out a Debt Management Performance Assessment 
(DeMPA), undertaken within the broader framework of the Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability Assessment, which could be the basis for a programmatic approach, with other 
CAF partners, to strengthen debt management capacity. 
50. Partnership and South-South collaboration: The Bank has actively facilitated South-
South collaboration and knowledge exchange to inform development activities in Nigeria. Field 
visits to Brazil, India and other African countries on safety nets programs informed the Youth 
Employment and Social Safety Net Operation (YESSO); peer learning events helped to 
strengthen project impact evaluations; the Finance and Private Sector Development Department 
supported 
the Government’s SME cluster development program 
through South-South 
collaboration with China; and the visit of the Fadama 3 project team to India, Singapore and Sri 
Lanka prompted the creation of federations of economic interest groups, a revolving funds 
scheme, and a mobile-based agricultural advisory services pilot. Likewise, in the education 
sector, the Lagos Eko project management team and participants from Ekiti state used a study 
tour to Chile as an opportunity to strengthen partnership, collaboration, and cooperation among 
higher education institutions in both countries. The Bank and IFC also facilitated a trip to the 
Lesotho National Referral Hospital to give Nigerian officials a first-hand look at the use of PPPs 
in healthcare investments. 
51. The Bank used other innovative tools to improve service delivery. Most notable was 
the development of impact evaluation (IE) which was used as tool to drive operational 
effectiveness. The current country IE portfolio includes 19 ongoing and planned IEs in 7 sectors 
and cuts across the three CPS2 pillars.76 The majority of IE activities are concentrated in human 
development and in health in particular, where the Bank is supporting the Saving One Million 
Lives (SOML) Initiative with a dedicated IE program in addition to conducting IEs on IDA-
financed investments. Financial literacy and financial inclusion is another area of focus, 
including an IE of the YouWin business grant program. Additionally, in NEWMAP, YESSO, and 
the SOML IEs, the IE design process is helping to plan for more efficient and timely delivery 
and; in Commercial Agriculture Development Project, Malaria Control Booster Project, State 
Health Program Investment Credit, IE evidence is being used to inform program management.  

Portfolio management and performance 
52. As of end June 2013, the Nigerian portfolio (World Bank) reached an historic high of 
US$5.3 billion, consisting of 26 national operations (US$5.1 billion), 3 regional operations 
(US$226.7 million); and 4 GEF operations (US$26.2 million). The current disbursement ratio of 
the Nigeria portfolio is 18.3 percent (US$530.2 million disbursed in FY13), and the FY12 
disbursement ratio was 16.4 percent. Seven projects 77 are currently classified as problem 

76 Increasingly, the trend is towards “2nd generation” IEs, which examine variations in design of specific interventions to 
understand which variant is most effective in achieving intended results, reflecting a shift towards the proactive creation of 
evidence and knowledge. 
77 Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project (LMDGP), Growth and Employment (GEM), Public Private 
Partnership project (PPP), Edo Growth and Employment Operation (Edo DPO), Public Sector Governance Development Project 
(PSGDP), and Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management project (NEWMAP) and Rural Access and Mobility Project 2 
(RAMP 2).

projects (unsatisfactory or moderately unsatisfactory). The signing of new Financing 
Agreements for three and the restructuring of two are expected to improve the performance of 
these projects.   
53. The delays 
in effectiveness of some projects contributed to 
lags 
in their 
implementation and disbursement. The average disbursement lag in the Nigeria portfolio is 13 
months. Most delays were associated with changes in Government procedures which resulted in 
the lengthy intervals between Board approvals and effectiveness of projects. In the case of the 
Borrowing Plan, the delay in approval resulted in eight projects being flagged for delayed 
effectiveness. In spite of this, the share of commitments at risk was lower in FY13 (21.9 percent) 
than in FY10 (46 percent), and the disbursement rate for FY13 was 19.5 percent, a significant 
achievement  
54. At mid-term review, both the Bank and the new Government realized that strong 
efforts were needed to accelerate portfolio implementation. The Bank and senior officials 
from the Ministry of Finance collaborated on standardizing procedures to process new 
operations. Procurement clinics were organized for 332 project staff from 150 project 
implementation units, and special workshops were held for slow-disbursing projects. 
Additionally, M&E training was provided to key staff in the Ministry’s International Economic 
Relations Department (IERD), with support from the Bank’s Institutional Development Fund 
(IDF). In addition, to strengthen the portfolio over the second half of the CPS period: (a) the 
Country Director constituted a multi-sector task team to conduct intensive assessments of key 
operational areas and offer solutions; (b) the Country Management Unit (CMU) prepared 
monthly Portfolio Monitoring Reports to identify projects requiring closer attention; (c) a CMU 
leadership team, consisting of the CMU core team and sector leaders, met monthly to deliberate 
on project, governance, and political economy issues that had the potential to impact the Country 
Program; (d) the Country Director met periodically with Project Coordinators and Task Team 
Leaders; (e) hands-on clinics and Country Program Performance Reviews (CPPRs) were carried 
out to resolve operational challenges.  
55. Despite these efforts, two projects presented particular challenges. Implementation of 
the malaria project was threatened with the detection of fiduciary weaknesses, confirmed by 
integrity vice presidency (INT) investigation. However, the Bank team reacted in a way which 
was considered as best practice. A follow-up in-depth review by the Bank’s FM team led to the 
introduction of corrective measures and a turnaround of the project after a disbursement lag of 
six to eight months. The LMDG project, aimed at slum upgrading in Lagos, faced technical and 
safeguards issues leading to an underperformance. While efforts were made to address them, it 
was agreed to close the project and draw lessons for future operations. 
56. Civil society organizations (CSOs) and community-based organizations are now 
formally participating in new projects and providing formal feedback on the progress of 
ongoing projects,78 after a stocktaking of social accountability mechanisms in Bank projects 
showed that communities’ informal inputs were not being properly documented or taken into 
account in decision-making. Several pilots involving CSOs in project implementation and 
feedback gathering are now being assessed, with a view to scaling up their engagement in project 
implementation and monitoring during the next CPS period.

C. Management of Risks 
57. Some important risks were identified during CPS preparation. The impact of the 
global financial crisis on the Nigerian economy could not be determined at the start of the CPS 
period, but the Bank anticipated that policy reforms could be threatened. The Bank also 
understood the risks of the turmoil in the Niger Delta and possible disruptions related to the 2011 
elections. The Bank planned to alleviate these risks by ensuring that the program had 
comprehensive support and by cultivating relationships with strong champions at both the federal 
and state who could be expected to maintain a steady pace of reform. 
58. While such efforts mitigated those particular risks, the Bank’s program was actually 
more strongly impacted by one unanticipated risk – increasing insecurity in other parts of 
the country. The risk of deadly attacks constrained project supervision in the North-Eastern 
states of Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, and Gombe during the last year of the CPS, although some 
supervision was carried out by implementing partners on the ground. The Bank’s Corporate 
Security Office has been collaborating with the UN and other partners to continually analyze 
and report on security risks and put mitigation measures in place for the next CPS period. 
The team in Nigeria is also learning from Bank teams in countries such as Pakistan to adjust 
its supervision response.  
V. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

59. Stocktaking activities and assessment of the results of the 2010-2013 CPS confirm 
meaningful progress on the governance agenda and policy reforms, as well as on the use of 
CDD approaches to drive growth and sustainable change in rural areas. However, the following 
lessons will be essential in shaping the CPS for 2014-2017.  
60. Widespread governance challenges remain a binding constraint to Nigeria’s 
development, in spite of the significant gains in the CPS period. Nigeria shares the 
complicated political economy of other resource-rich countries, and the size, ethnic diversity, 
cycles of violent conflict and evolving democratic institutions make development a challenging 
affair. In a shared response to these challenges, the WB has kept its engagement narrowly 
focused on public financial management while other CPS partners have concentrated on 
strengthening democratic institutions and the judiciary. However the Bank has also understood 
the need to better understand and reflect the political economy of the country in sector 
operations. Progress is most notable when such reforms are accompanied by intense policy 
dialogue, technical assistance, and multi-stakeholder involvement, although the challenges to 
achieving good governance through PFM reforms remain substantial. Also, preliminary pilots in 
water and health projects towards the end of the CPS period demonstrate that a better 
understanding of the political economy, financing, and institutional setup for operations could 
potentially improve project performance and development impact.  
61. A number of projects were found to be too complex or overly ambitious, which 
slowed implementation and ultimately impacted the achievement of outcomes. An 
implementation study commissioned by the WB 79 as part of a broader portfolio review 
ascertained the need to improve the quality at entry of projects by: (a) keeping designs simple, 
with a small number of implementing agencies; (b) establishing clear roles, responsibilities, and 
accountabilities for the different implementing agencies, and ensuring each agency’s readiness

for implementation; and (c) setting clear project development objectives and indicators to allow 
for unity of purpose. Improving the design of projects will also benefit from sound analytical 
underpinnings and from a re-examination of the choice and mix of Bank Group instruments.  
62. Facilitating the right balance and fostering synergies between federal and state-level 
reforms will accelerate development. Nigeria’s governance and administration architecture has 
multiple dimensions, and the needs of the federal and state Governments do not always align. 
However, the structural reforms aimed at improving public sector management at both levels 
have been relatively successful, and attest to the possibilities for harmonization. For instance, 
monitoring and evaluation units have been established within the National Planning Commission 
to monitor and evaluate federal Government activities, and these units and their functions are 
being replicated at the state level. To facilitate the alignment of federal and state reforms during 
the next assistance period, the Bank will prepare sector policy notes for state Governments, and 
will strengthen the dialogue with state Governments on the use of DPOs. Moreover, the criteria 
for selecting target states will need to be re-assessed to achieve an optimum balance between the 
performance-based approach and the need to respond to lagging regions, particularly in the 
North. 
63. A final important lesson is that adequate stakeholder engagement is essential to 
enhance results and outcomes. The country survey conducted in December 2012 revealed the 
need to make better use of stakeholder engagement as a channel for collaborative dialogue to 
achieve results. In response, the Bank is reorganizing its strategic outreach to Government at all 
levels, and has initiated regular consultations with the Nigerian Governance Advisory Forum, 
which includes opinion leaders from academia, think tanks, Government, civil society, and the 
private sector. This will help the Bank team further understand the perspectives of different actors 
and better adapt its programs to relevant priorities. Finally, the Bank team has started to deepen its 
engagement with the National Assembly and will continue to do so along with other partners to 
better explain its interventions and facilitate smoother approval of the Borrowing Plan.

Status: Achieved 

 Power supplied increased from 
2800MW in 2009 to 4500MW in 
2013 

 Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO), 
including corresponding feed-in 
tariffs for generation plants,

effect as a “Single Buyer” to enter 
into power purchase agreements 
with Independent Power 
Producers and manage the 
contractual risks.  

 Action Plan and roadmap for 
power sector reform with 

The sector reform agenda was re-launched as 
part of the current administration’s power 
sector reform roadmap and led to Nigeria 
setting a new all-time record in available 
grid supply as of May 2013 with an available 
supply of 4,500 MW while halving the 
number of grid collapses compared to the 
previous year (reduced from an average of 
about 40 per annum to 18 during 2011).  

The MYTO was revised in 2011. It took 
effect on May 31, 2012 and will last for 5 
years. MYTO is designed to provide financial 
motivations for instantly needed incremental 
investments in the industry and increase the 
average Tariff from 8` Naira/kWh to cost 
reflective levels (~ 21 Naira/kWh).  

The NEBT, also known as the bulk trader, 
was established in 2011. It was set up by the 
National Electricity Sector Reforms Act of 
2005 to fight recouping of investment by 
distribution companies which was the single 
biggest risk in the growth of the power sector.  

The Roadmap for Power Sector Reform was 
launched in August 2010. This roadmap is 
critical for improving the gas-to-power

Lessons and Suggestions for 
the new CPS 
The OPRC method of 
contracting requires a long 
procurement process. The delays 
in rehabilitation of roads 
occurred primarily because this 
lengthy process was not factored 
into the project design and 
hence, the contracts for the 
construction of rural roads using 
OPRC concept started later than 
expected. 

Setting up a strong institutional 
basis for coordinated planning 
and regulation is critical to the 
success of urban transport 
projects. LUTP II will continue 
to support the strengthening of 
the capacity of LAMATA to 
effectively deliver this service 
and implement the Strategic 
Transport Master Plan.

Following the CPS PR, the contributing project 
realized that the ‘million Metric Ton’ value 
used is too high a target and erroneous. Since 
the project targets were established differently, 
the value has been adjusted to correspond to 
the program contribution in this summary. 

The progress from sales is gradually 
influencing the income generated from 
agricultural produce in selected communities 
per household per year. A substantial increase 
was achieved, from N135000/hh/yr to

The national agriculture strategy was adopted 
in 2010, reflecting the positive efforts of the

to this program was consolidated by the 
subsequent launching of the Agricultural

Business reports have enabled states to 
examine impediments to growth more closely. 
The Bank completed the Investment Climate 
Assessments (ICAs), reviewed the experiences 
of over 3000 surveyed business owners in 26 
states about the aspects of the business climate 
that affect their enterprises. The Bank also 
provided policy advice through workshops 
which led to Government establishing Ports, 
Competitiveness and Business Councils 
including reducing the number of agencies in 
Ports from 17 to 7. Overall, 60 reforms were 
identified and DFID is providing technical

target. For campaign immunizations, the 
OPV coverage of the endemic states 
increased from 44% in 2003 (CDC) to 90% 
in 2012 (PHSS).90 

Data available from country surveys indicate 
that this result was fully attained: Against the 
baseline of 22.7 percent from the National 
Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 
2008), the National Immunization Coverage 
Survey showed an increase to 53% in 2010 
(NICS 2010). World Development Indicators

Lessons and Suggestions for 
the new CPS 
Nonetheless, a comparison of 
key PDO/IR performance 
indicators of WB assisted states 
with other states using the 
recently conducted National 
Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS 
- 2011) shows clearly that there 
is wide positive disparity in 
results documented from the 
seven states compared with 
other states. There were initial 
teething challenges which 
included synchronizing the 
demand side activities with the 
supply, and capacity challenges 
at the state level.  

Increasing the quality of basic 
education in a grossly 
disadvantaged setting will 
require concerted and consistent 
effort and resources. The CPS 
period was not a realistic 
timeframe in which improved 
quality of education could have 
been achieved in robust terms.

its strategic priorities and the 
attainment of the MDGs. The

DPO approach. The public 
procurement value chain analysis 
at the Federal level will help to 
further identify bottlenecks in the 
current Government practices 
that can hinder effective and 
efficient use of public resources. 
The study also suggested 
mitigating measures to address 
the identified bottlenecks. 

At the Federal level, public contracts awarded 
above threshold through open competition 
exceeded the CPS target of 90 percent, 
increasing to 100 percent whereas the 30 
percent value at state level fell below the target 
of 70 percent and was only a marginal increase 
from the baseline.106

The publication of public contracts awards 
performed much better, increasing from 30

2013. In the states, it increased from 0 to 
between 90 and 100 percent; Lagos, Edo, Cross

Third party procurement

strengthen the established

consolidate budding results.  

Credible policy formulation and 
monitoring of development 
progress in all sectors are 
severely hampered by the current 
poor statistical capacity. In this 
context, improving the collection 
and processing of data, as well as 
optimizing the use of the limited 
data available, are key elements 
for success in enhancing 
governance and decision-making 
in the CPS period. 

A catalytic effect of the SRF

increased from 0 in 2010 at the 
Federal and State levels to 40 
MDAs at federal and 20 MDAs in

Procurement third party monitoring by 
organized civil societies has been introduced 
and MDAs with third party monitoring have 
increased to 28 at Federal and 12 at State level, 
falling below the CPS target of 40 MDAs at 
Federal and 20 at State level.107 However, an 
electronic procurement portal has been

While the CPS considered vertical DPOs, the Bank realized this 
was a politically sensitive issue and considered in 2010 to 
having horizontal DPOs in up to eight states. However, the new 
Government is not favorable to state DPOs so the DPO series 
are currently off the table.

A. THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK  
1. What is CAF?  

1. 
     The Country Assistance Framework (CAF) is the common strategic approach of 
Nigeria’s development partners in support of the Government’s development plans. The CAF is 
derived from the program priorities articulated in Vision 20:2020 and its implementation 
strategy, the Transformation Agenda (TA) 2011-2015. It was developed through a dynamic 
priority-setting process characterized by inclusiveness and stakeholder consultations, and 
focused on achieving national ownership of the development agenda. 
2. 
     The CAF is also a platform to increase aid effectiveness in Nigeria. In line with the 
Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action, the CAF is intended as an instrument to promote 
donor coordination and improve aid effectiveness through better harmonization of interventions, 
avoidance of duplication of tasks, use of common implementation mechanisms wherever 
possible, and periodic discussions around key themes/topics and consultations within and across 
sectors. 
3. 
     The CAF is a living document as well as an instrument for policy dialogue. It facilitates 
discussion and cooperation among partners and stakeholders, and provides flexibility in 
responding to Nigeria’s evolving social, economic, and political context. Partners have agreed to 
formulate their respective country programs and strategies in line with the CAF in order to 
amplify the development impact of their assistance. 
4. 
     The CAF sets out two strategic levels of results expected from the cooperation of 
development partners. Vision 20:2020 and the Transformation Agenda represent the broad, high-
level changes in each of the CAF priority areas to which the partners will contribute. The second 
strategic tier of results will be elaborated separately by each of the CAF partners and reflected in 
their respective country programs and strategies. 

2. Rationale for the CAF  

5. 
The CAF seeks to streamline partners’ support in order to increase aid effectiveness, 
accelerate implementation, and deliver rapid transformational results. The effectiveness of this 
assistance to Nigeria will not derive exclusively from the size of financial contributions, which 
are small relative to the country’s own resources. Total ODA assistance received by Nigeria in 
2010 was US$2.05 billion,112 compared to the gross domestic product (GDP) in the same year of 
close to US$200 billion113 and the federal budget of US$26.6 billion. 
6. Nigeria is a dominant economic and financial force across West Africa, and its success will 
impact the entire Sub-Saharan region. It is home to more than 20 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s 
population, the largest oil producing country in Africa, and the tenth largest global producer. It 
has the sixth largest Muslim population in the world, and is by far the largest country in the 
world to have nearly equal numbers of Christians and Muslims. It is also the fifth largest 
contributor to United Nations peacekeeping forces. As the most influential and militarily 
powerful member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Nigeria has 

112 OECD statistics. 
113 In 2010, the Nigeria economy was ranked the 45th in the world in terms of its gross domestic product (WB).

played a key role in helping to resolve major political and security disputes in West Africa, from 
the Liberian and Sierra Leone crises in the 1990s to the political problems in Guinea, Niger, Côte 
d’Ivoire in the past few years, to Guinea Bissau more recently 
7. Nigeria also presents some complex development challenges. It displays the characteristics 
of various types of African economies, namely: (i) a middle income economy with buoyant 
activity in the Lagos metropolitan area with a vibrant financial and private sector; (ii) a natural 
resource rich country facing the challenges of managing the rent and translating these resources 
into improved social outcomes, especially for the poor and the most vulnerable; (iii) a country 
facing complex security challenges ranging from militant extremism and inter-communal 
conflict over resources to ethno-religious polarization and organized crime; and (iv) the rest of 
the country which displays the features of a typical low income Sub-Saharan African economy 
with high levels of inequality.  

B. DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT  
a. Country Background 

8. Nigeria is a federal state, comprising the federal capital territory administration, 36 state 
Governments, and 774 local Government councils (LGCs). The 1999 Constitution gave 
significant autonomy to the states in the delivery of economic and social services and the 
provision of infrastructure, both directly and jointly with local Governments. The Federal 
Government remains responsible for setting standards, coordinating policy, and discharging 
national functions such as security, foreign affairs, and macroeconomic management. 

b. Country Vision  

9. Nigeria aims to become one of the 20 largest economies in the world by year 2020. Its 
long-term development agenda, as laid in the Vision 20:2020 (NV 20:2020), focuses on  
focusing on two broad objectives: (a) optimizing the country’s human and natural resource 
potential to achieve rapid and sustained economic growth, and (b) translating economic growth 
into equitable social development that guarantees a dignified and meaningful existence for all 
citizens.  
10.  The implementation plan for the Nigeria Vision 20:2020 is in three phases:  the First 
National Implementation Plan (2010 – 2013); the Second (2014-2017); and the Third (2018-
2020). As part of the operationalization of the NV20:2020, the Government has developed a 
medium-term strategy to transform the Nigerian economy during the period 2012-2015 which is 
articulated in the 2011 Transformation Agenda (TA). 
11.   The Transformation Agenda is focused on: (a) building fiscal buffers in the uncertain global 
environment and safeguard macroeconomic stability, (b) making growth more inclusive and (c) 
supporting economic diversification and increasing the competitiveness of Nigeria’s economy. 
The TA is underpinned by a fiscal reform program that seeks to reduce the deficit of the federal 
Government, maintain domestic debt, and 
increase capital spending, particularly for 
infrastructure where the needs are huge. 
12.   These priorities are interlinked, with progress in one area supporting and depending on 
advances in the others. Inclusive growth will require a sustainable increase in employment, which in 

116 

 
 
turn will depend on faster growth in the non-oil sector, and a more skilled and competitive labor 
force. In addition, all levels of Government will need to improve service delivery efficiency, 
particularly in sectors related to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
13.   An integrated and coordinated approach across and between all levels of Government is 
critical for the realization of Nigeria’s development goals. The country vision is complemented 
at state levels by State Economic Development and Empowerment Strategy, where those exist. 
Many states in Nigeria lack their own development strategies, missing to make the full use of 
their high degree of autonomy.  
14.   Nigerian states operate with a high degree of legal and de facto autonomy in the areas of 
service delivery, internal organization, and revenue generation, which coexists with a strong 
federal mandate in the areas of public order, control over subnational borrowing, and 
appointments to the judiciary. While this autonomy provides states, particularly those with 
dynamic and progressive leadership, an opportunity to move ahead on their own, it also poses a 
challenge to building national consensus across different levels of Government, including in the 
areas of macroeconomic stability (management of oil wealth and the general Government 
budget), prioritizing public resource allocation, and meeting minimal national standards in 
service delivery. Creating consensus in those areas can be a difficult task, particularly 
considering the country’s political and institutional complexities. The high level of state 
autonomy also poses a challenge to creating a framework for convergence toward the best 
experiences, which would significantly enhance the country’s progress toward achieving its 
goals. For example, if Nigeria adopted nationwide all of the state-level best practices identified 
in Doing Business 2010, it would rank 72nd out of 183 economies globally – 53 places above its 
actual ranking.  

c. The Economy and Budgetary Management   

15.   Since the return to democratic rule, Nigeria has experienced more than a decade of rapid 
GDP growth. The Nigerian economy exhibited strong GDP growth over the last decade, 
averaging close to 8 percent. This growth has been driven by a rapid expansion of domestic 
demand, and concentrated in sectors servicing the Nigerian market, most notably trade and 
agriculture. In 2012, growth in trade and agriculture slowed in the context of a national strike (in 
January), severe flooding, and growing security challenges to business in parts of the North. By 
preliminary estimates GDP growth in 2012 amounted to 6.6 percent, as opposed to 7.4 percent in 
2011. 
16.   The high dependence on inherently volatile oil revenues presents major balance of 
payments and budgetary risks to the country. Nigeria is highly dependent on oil, which accounts 
for over 95 percent of exports, nearly about 75 percent of consolidated Government revenues, 
and over 40 percent of GDP (at current prices). The uncertain global environment and associated 
oil price volatility emphasize the critical importance of prudent macroeconomic management and 
economic diversification in order to reduce the vulnerability of the country’s public finance and 
balance of payments to a fall in oil prices. 
17.   Nigeria made a major step forward in responsible macroeconomic management by creating 
the Excess Crude Account (ECA) as a fiscal reserve fund in 2004. Oil revenues accruing to the 
Government over and above an agreed benchmark price go to this fund. By September, 2008, 
Nigeria had accumulated US$22 billion in the ECA, much of which was subsequently used to 

117 

 
 
finance a fiscal stimulus package that maintained economic demand and rapid growth during the 
world financial crisis of 2008-2009. Nevertheless, remaining institutional vulnerabilities 
surrounding the ECA surfaced visibly in 2010 and early 2011, when political pressures led to 
excessive ad hoc withdrawals from the ECA, thus financing a large pro-cyclical fiscal expansion 
that put Nigeria’s reserve position and financial stability at risk. 
18.   Fortunately, the Government has worked to restore the countercyclical fiscal policy since 
mid-2011. The Federal Government has reduced its fiscal deficit to well under the 3 percent of 
GDP cap specified in the Fiscal Responsibility Law. The general Government deficit fell from an 
estimated 6.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.2 percent in 2011. In 
2012, budgetary consolidation has continued, while the Government succeeded in reducing fuel 
subsidy payments by both reducing the subsidy rate and cracking down on corruption. The 
federal deficit is expected at 2.4percent of GDP (versus 2.6percent in 2011) and the general 
Government deficit should be about 1.9percent. The ECA has re-accumulated from a very low 
level at the end of 2010 to close to US$9 billion in early 2013. Nevertheless, prudent 
macroeconomic management continues to face challenges, particularly as the Excess Crude 
Account in Nigeria is managed and owned not only by the Federal Government, but by Nigerian 
States as well. The Government and National Assembly responded by passing a law in 2011 that 
establishes a new Sovereign Wealth Fund that will likely be less vulnerable than the ECA to 
political demands for ad hoc withdrawals. However, political controversies have so far delayed 
the transfer of functions from the ECA to the Sovereign Wealth Fund.  
19.   Over the near term, Nigeria faces a challenge of very slow or negligible growth in oil 
output, which implies that oil revenues should become an increasingly smaller share of GDP. In 
2012, Government oil revenues already declined from an estimated 23 percent of GDP to 19.5 
percent, despite generally strong oil prices. This speaks for the imperative of compensating for 
declines in oil receipts with increases in non-oil revenues. In the context of shrinking oil 
revenues relative to GDP, the opportunity cost of the fuel subsidy is increasing. The fuel subsidy, 
accounted for 4.6 percent and 2.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012, respectively. An attempt by 
the Government to remove the fuel subsidy in January 2012 met with massive unrest and a 
national strike, which led to a compromise solution that doubled the enforced fixed naira price 
for petrol. Given inflation and (possible) currency depreciation, the fiscal burden of the subsidy 
(enforcing a fixed naira price for fuel) can grow rapidly with time, eventually reaching 
unsustainable levels. 
20.   The lack of official fiscal data at state level, with harmonized definitions and classifications 
comparable to those for the federal Government, further complicates the formulation of fiscal 
policy and the monitoring of its implementation at different levels of Government. Nevertheless, 
the FAAC has begun to take steps, in association with States, to roll-out a uniform chart of 
accounts and budget classification system, consistent with Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 
in order to harmonize the fiscal operations reporting across the Federation. 

118 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Key Macroeconomic Indicators21.   Nigeria's debt position remains strong, with increasing 
emphasis on controlling domestic borrowing. Following the restructuring and write-off of its 
debt obligations to the Paris Club in 2005, Nigeria has committed to a yearly Debt Sustainability 
Analysis (DSA) exercise to monitor its debt portfolio and forestall potential crises.114 The 2012 
DSA established that Nigeria remains at a low risk of debt distress with a robust debt outlook in 
the short to medium term based on standardized stress tests. External sovereign debt remains less 
than 3 percent of GDP and this is expected to remain the case over the short term. On the other 
hand, the domestic debt level has risen to 16 percent of GDP and is expected to rise further in the 
medium term. In response to the rapid growth in domestic debt and the high associated 
borrowing costs, particularly at the state level, the 2012 DSA recommends a shift from domestic 
to external sources of borrowing. The 2012 DSA also recognizes the potential impact of a 
negative oil price shock on debt sustainability and has recommended the implementation of 
policies that will fast-track the diversification of the economy to non-oil sources of revenue. 

C. OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 

22.   Nigeria remains a country of opportunities and challenges. Its presence is felt across the 
West Africa region, and it accounts for an estimated 70 percent of the regions’ GDP. It is the 
second largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa, and has the potential to 
become the largest, with even greater positive spill-over effects throughout the region. Nigeria is 
the most populous country in Africa, with an estimated population of 171 million in 2013. It is 
also the biggest oil exporter in Africa, and has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent. 
With these large reserves of human and natural resources, Nigeria is poised to build a prosperous 
economy; significantly reduce poverty; and provide health, education, and infrastructure services 
to its population. 

23.   In spite of its natural resource wealth and relatively strong economic growth over the last 
seven years, Nigeria faces widespread poverty and inequality, high youth unemployment, 
inadequate service delivery, low MDG indicators, and governance challenges. The oil industry 
creates few jobs, therefore failing to tackle the rising rate of youth unemployment in the country. 
All of these factors have fuelled grievances which gave given rise to violence that broke out, 
creating security risks in the country and the region. The 2012 Global Peace Index notes that in 
2011 and early 2012 Nigeria experienced the second largest deterioration among Sub-Saharan 
countries and was ranked 146 out of 158 countries.115 

a. Opportunities 

24.   The Transformation Agenda assigns great importance to supporting non-oil sectors that 
have strong job creation and multiplier potential, such as housing and agriculture. Nigeria’s 

114 DSA is conducted by the Debt Management Office.  
115 Other global fragility and conflict indices rank Nigeria similarly low and show a downward trend over recent 
years. Nigeria is in the bottom 4 percent countries globally in the World Bank ratings of Political Stability and 
Absence of Violence. The Failed State Index has repeatedly ranked Nigeria as in ‘danger’, the second-worst 
category, most recently as number 14 out of 177 countries (Failed State index 2012).  

119 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
housing sector grew at 12.6 percent over 2006-2010, fueled by rapid urbanization, but there is 
still an estimated housing gap of 700,000 houses in different market segments. Government is 
working on developing housing finance mechanisms to support  the sector and unlock its job 
creation potential.  
25.   The Government has embarked on an ambitious plan to modernize the agriculture sector, 
which accounts for a substantial share of non-oil GDP and employs 70 percent of the population. 
The sector recorded modest improvement in overall performance in recent years; it grew by 
about 6.8 percent annually between 2005 and 2009. However, this has been attributed mostly to 
land area expansion. While data on agricultural production in Nigeria are weak, it is widely 
recognized that Nigeria’s agriculture sector continues to have a high growth potential, and the 
Government is strongly committed to increasing productivity, guaranteeing food security, 
encouraging better use of existing cultivable areas and improving food processing capacity. The 
Agricultural Transformation Agenda aims to transform agriculture into a modern and 
commercially oriented sector with value-chain linkages to manufacturing. Efforts to encourage 
private investment include tax and tariff incentives. Moving forward, such measures will need to 
be regularly re-evaluated to encourage firms to wean themselves from this support – otherwise, 
policies meant to help firms in their formative years might become a disincentive for improving 
efficiency and productivity. Realizing the potential of agriculture will also depend on addressing 
structural bottlenecks and reducing the cost of doing business in the sector. 
26.   Nigeria’s significant mineral deposits also represent a strategic opportunity for growth. 
Before the oil boom of the 1970s, coal and tin were among the natural resources mined on a 
massive scale, with the former being used to generate electricity, power the railway network, and 
meet the demands of regional and international markets. Lead and zinc were a significant source 
of export revenue, and Nigeria was the world's largest exporter of columbite. Recently, there has 
been a growing recognition of the potential of the solid minerals sector for diversifying the 
economy. The Government’s commitment to mining sector is increasing along with revenues 
and employment generation, and more exploration is taking place by international companies. 
The Government recently developed a long-term roadmap for transformation of the solid 
minerals and metals sector as strategic catalysts of growth. A Solid Mineral Development Fund 
(SMDF) is being created in accordance with the Mining Act to fund the reforms articulated in the 
roadmap. The SMDF, in turn, is to be funded by the President-approved Natural Resources 
Development Fund (NRDF), which is a constitutional established fund to promote natural 
resources development as a whole. These efforts need to be reinforced by developing and 
implementing a well-functioning institutional framework that ensures inclusiveness and good 
corporate governance.  
27.   Rapid urbanization, while challenging, is another opportunity to boost growth and reduce 
poverty. Over the years, Nigeria has experienced rapid urbanization, with 50 percent of its 
population living in urban centers in 2010. The projected continuous high population growth will 
intensify the urbanization process (UN 2012), further increasing opportunities for income 
diversification, expanding options for more affordable service delivery, and widening horizons 
for innovation and skills acquisition. Accomplishing that will require a focus on both rural and 
urban development, improving livability of cities and villages, creating more jobs in cities and 
more off-farm jobs in rural Nigeria, improved urban management, and enhanced integration of 
domestic markets. 

120 

 
 
28.   Strong efforts are needed to unlock the potential of cities to support economic growth. 
Traffic congestion costs, poor service coverage and delivery, and low quality infrastructure all 
negatively affect the competitiveness of urban areas and their capacity to support local economic 
growth and attract investment. The lack of effective urban governance is also a major issue 
across all states and cities. While the Constitution identifies local Government as the third tier of 
Government after the federal Government and state Governments, the presence of several local 
Government units (LGUs) within most large municipal areas has critically reduced the prospects 
for a cohesive management of large urban areas.  
29.   Further, most LGUs lack the capacity to sustainably finance and maintain urban services 
and infrastructure or to effectively accommodate an informal economy. This has had a negative 
impact on city landscapes, and on cities’ contribution to the national economy. The absence of an 
integrated approach at the local and state/Federal levels to maximize the growth potential of 
cities further complicates these challenges. If the economic growth and job creation of cities is to 
be unleashed, it will be necessary for Nigeria to implement needed policy and institutional 
reforms in land use planning and develop sustainable strategies to enhance investment in urban 
infrastructure and service delivery. 
30.   Nigeria also has opportunity for growth and diversification through regional and global 
integration, both of which have been associated with higher long-run growth. China, Korea, 
India, Brazil, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico have all become industrial power-
houses  through transformation of their export structure. 
31.   The West Africa Economic Community has a population of 300 million, and further 
consolidation of this large regional market is likely to attract more foreign direct investment and 
create economies of scale that would directly benefit Nigeria. There has been some progress, but 
trade networks within West Africa still are not well developed (intra-regional trade accounts for 
merely 10 percent of GDP), which constraints Nigeria’s ability to tap into the short and medium-
term growth opportunities offered by the regional market. Nigeria’s ambitious Agriculture 
Transformation Agenda as well as strategies and programs adopted in the framework of the 
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) could be useful instruments 
to boost investment in the sector. However, the Government would need to adopt more open 
trade policies aligned with the ECOWAS trade regime, along with measures to simplify border 
customs procedures.  
32.   The West African regional market also offers significant growth potential for Nigeria’s gas-
based industries, including (a) gas to power (supplying both domestic and regional demand 
through the West Africa Power Pool); (b) gas-based industrialization, including development of 
fertilizer, methanol, and petrochemicals; and (c) development of export capacity through 
investments in liquid natural gas (LNG) and regional pipeline infrastructure, building on the 
West African Gas Pipeline that currently services Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana. 
33.   Similarly, the West African market holds tremendous opportunities for Nigeria’s financial 
sector. Financial integration with West Africa is one of the strategic pillars of Nigeria’s Financial 
Sector Strategy 2020. Efforts are underway to integrate the region’s three leading stock 
and monetary union (between ECOWAS and WAMU). The potential for cross‐border portfolio 
exchanges—the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the Bourse régionale de valeurs mobilières (BRVM) 
in Abidjan, and the Ghana Stock Exchange—and develop mechanisms for cross-listing and 
trading. These efforts are taking place in parallel with efforts to promote economic convergence 
121 

 
 
investments by ECOWAS institutions and individuals is high, although full integration is still a 
long way off. 
34.   To fully benefit from the growth potential offered by regional and global integration, 
Nigeria would need to develop regionally and globally competitive sectors; diversify exports 
through a vibrant and globally competitive private sector; and develop goods and services that 
comply with international standards.  

b. Challenges 
i. Political and Security Challenges 

35.   Since the transition from the military rule to electoral democracy in 1999, Nigeria has had 
four presidential elections, the latest in April 2011.  The last general election in 2011 received 
high praise for being well-managed, despite some post-election violence in northern Nigeria. 
36.   Nigeria’s democracy is deepening although some institutions are still weak. Enactment of 
the Freedom of Information Act in 2011 strengthened the country’s framework for transparency 
and accountability by requiring that  all publicly funded institutions must be open about their 
operations and expenditures, giving citizens the right to access information about their activities. 
The deepening of democratic practices was also evident in the conduct of the 2012 elections for 
governorship in Ondo, Adamawa and Edo, which were adjudged as free and fair.  
37.   Like other young democracies, Nigeria faces continuing challenges. The political 
environment is currently characterized by mistrust among the federal Government, states, and 
local councils over oil revenue-sharing arrangement. Concerns are also being voiced about some 
tensions between the executive and the legislative arms of the Government. Lastly, focus is 
gradually turning toward the 2015 elections which might limit the space for policy reform in the 
next 12 to 18 months.  
38.   Nigeria is also facing a range of complex conflict and security challenges, although the 
incidence and causes of violence differ significantly among Nigeria’s 36 states. Some states have 
proven to be remarkably resilient, while others have seen violence erupting much more 
frequently. Some of the most significant challenges include the insurgency of radical Islamists in 
the North; inter-communal violence over access to economic and natural resources and political 
power, for example in the Middle Belt states; kidnappings, armed robbery and conflicts over oil 
spills especially in the South-East; and ongoing efforts to reintegrate militants under an Amnesty 
provision in the Niger Delta. The current situation stems from a mix of historical, ethnic, 
regional and religious issues coupled with challenges in the value system, oil and gas resources, 
corruption, exclusion, weak checks and balances, poor social participation drive, and poor 
service delivery.  
39.   Many of the long-standing sources of instability have been compounded by the rise of 
Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati Wal-Jihad (JAS), popularly known as Boko Haram, a violent 
Salafist group that began an uprising in 2009. The group carries out frequent attacks on state 
institutions and local populations, both Christian and Muslim. It is responsible for the August 
2011 attack on the UN building in Abuja. State security forces deployed in response to JAS have 
been accused of alleged transgressions against local populations. Moreover, many civilians have 

122 

 
 
fallen victims to inter-communal reprisal attacks carried out in a climate of increasing ethno-
religious polarization.  
40.   As a result, the death toll in recent years has been on the increase in what had already been 
the most violent country in Africa that is not at war. Reliable data are scarce but one of the best 
estimates available has recorded an average of 3,000 conflict-related deaths each year between 
2006 and 2011.116 Violence against women and girls is underreported but also estimated to be 
high.117  
41.   The impact of violence goes beyond the loss of lives. Violence holds back social and 
economic development, and particularly hurts the poorest because they have few assets to begin 
with and face enormous challenges in recovering subsequently. Breaking the cycle of violence 
requires sustainable solutions that address its root causes and resolve the underlying grievances. 
Existing political and development responses are yet to start generating results in this regard. 
42.   Ultimately, the impact of political and security challenges on Nigeria’s development will 
depend on how political and other elites address, in words of Professor Akim Iwayemi, “a trilogy 
of discontent in contemporary Nigeria, namely: massive youth joblessness, social inequity, [and] 
huge public spending with marginal impact on social well-being of majority of the population 
due mainly to waste and large scale corruption.”.118 
Governance  
43. Lack of a well-functioning civil service poses challenges to achieving sustainable 
development outcomes. Decades of authoritarian rule have weakened the state and federal civil 
service. Human resources management in general is not well developed, and ghost workers are 
common. The degree of freedom with respect to human resources management varies between 
the federal agencies – those outside the core civil service, such as the Federal tax authority, enjoy 
greater freedom. Affirmative action, patronage and geo-political considerations in appointments 
crowd out merit-based hiring, thereby weakening overall capacity. Rotation policies take priority 
over continuity, making it difficult to sustain improved capacity over time. Further, the 
fragmentation of responsibilities across different commissions and agencies increases the 
difficulty of implementing reforms. There has been some success in cleaning up nominal 
payrolls and in strengthening merit-based hiring. The most senior positions are now tenured with 
renewals tied to performance and some top positions in several key public institutions were 
advertised and filled competitively in 2012. Other aspects of civil service reform such as merit-
based recruitment, promotion and dismissal, remuneration structures, pension schemes, rotation 
policies and training remain largely unaddressed. More broadly, Nigeria still needs to strengthen 
public institutions and nurture effective leadership in the public administration. The weak civil 
service regime implies that top level leadership is the key to most reform efforts. On the other 
hand, many successful reforms championed by visionary leaders have proven unsustainable.  
44. There is a great deal of variation across states in their capacity for governance. A new 
generation of state governors is emerging, albeit still a minority. Some are beginning to address 
public sector reform, through civil service modernization and right sizing, and strengthening 
financial management. The emphasis of some governors is being broadened to the quality of

services provided, and that entails modifying budget structures, inculcating a performance 
orientation in staff, and increasing transparency. 
45. 
 The three tiers of Government (federal, state and local) in Nigeria have overlapping but 
autonomous fiscal and policy jurisdictions for public services that directly impinge on the 
MDGs. In such federal settings, progress towards the MDGs is hindered or accelerated 
depending on synergy and coordination of policies and service delivery across the layers of 
Government. In particular, because Nigeria’s state and local Governments ideally should be 
closest to the grassroots in terms of providing basic public services, their actions or inactions 
could impact greatly on MDGs. In reality, however, states and local Governments in Nigeria 
largely follow the MDGs policy frameworks initiated by the federal Government. The fiscal and 
policy autonomy of state Governments is largely circumscribed by weak technical and 
institutional capacities. Also, because of the relatively higher concentration of more experienced 
public officials at the Federal level, state Governments generally suffer from weaker public 
service bureaucracies. 
46. Capacity and institutional challenges also affect the policy design and dialogue. Due to 
inadequate data collection and monitoring (M&E), policies and funding decisions often are not 
informed by facts, and their impacts on poverty reduction and welfare cannot be monitored. 
47. While many reforms have been initiated to improve public finance management (PFM), 
much remains to be done. Reforms have included strengthening the legislative framework at the 
Federal level through the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the Public Procurement Act, and similar 
laws and regulations at the state level. Improving the transparency and accountability of the 
country’s PFM and procurement systems is essential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of service delivery. This will require (a) collating of data to identify bottlenecks in implementing 
reforms, (b) providing capacity development and incentives for civil servants in charge of 
exercising internal controls; (c) further automating financial management and e-procurement 
functions through integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS) at the state 
and Federal levels; and (d) enhancing oversight of procurement system performance. The 
challenge lies in the uneven capacity and commitment, across states and federal ministries, 
departments and agencies (MDAs) to embrace the needed changes and adopt practices consistent 
with modern PFM principles. In addition, given the low capital budget execution rates further 
capacity building is needed in the areas of procurement, implementation, and project evaluation 
to ensure that the planned scaling up of capital spending will result in productive and effective 
development. 
48. While formal mechanisms of governance such as an independent judiciary, protection of 
human rights, legislative oversight, and free and fair elections have improved in recent years, 
they remain weak. The independence of parliament, external audit institutions and the judiciary 
from vested interests is of concern, and there are few incentives for reform. Given the centrality 
of these institutions in the governance of the country, improvements are badly needed. 
49. Governance and the complicated political economy of reform are increasingly recognized 
as the primary challenges to development in Nigeria. Vested interests, complex networks of 
patronage, and traditional loyalties and affiliations result in grand and petty corruption, which is 
fueled by the extraordinary rents from oil and gas.  
50. Civil society in Nigeria is not yet a reliable watchdog or source of pressure for reform. 
While there are many demands for governance reform in the traditional and social media, it is 

124 

 
 
difficult to discern any popular movement that is capable of channeling this dissatisfaction into a 
series of actions that can challenge the status quo or ensure the accountability of elected officials. 
However, some progress has been made in procurement monitoring at the Federal level with the 
development of a procurement observatory by a coalition of civil society organizations.  

ii. Competitiveness 

51. Nigeria is making progress in improving its competitiveness. The Global Benchmarking 
Network has ranked Nigeria 115th in its 2012 Global Competitiveness Report, up from 127th in 
2011, due to improved macroeconomic condition and recovery from the financial sector crisis of 
2009. Yet, significant challenges still remain. 
52. The institutional environment does not support a competitive economy because of 
concerns about the protection of property rights, ethics and corruption, undue influence, and 
Government inefficiencies, including regarding reform and policy implementation. The public 
private interface, business and property, registries, customs at port etc. perform badly when 
compared to other economies (reflected in an overall DB ranking of 133 from 183 countries). 
The Nigerian trade regime remains restrictive, and ineffectual as Nigeria ranks 149th in the 
Trading Across Borders category, in the Doing Business index. In addition, Nigeria ranks 180th 
in land administration, among the worst figures in the world. This insecurity of tenure is linked 
to lack of investment, especially in the construction sector.  
53. Access to and cost of finance are the second and third greatest constraints faced by 
firms.119 Financial markets lack the depth to drive economic diversification and job creation, or 
finance infrastructure investment. Promoting the financial sector’s role in development is a key 
policy priority. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria have very limited access to 
bank credit or other financial services – in 2011, fewer than 10 percent of SMEs had a loan or 
line of credit and SMEs represented only 5 percent of bank lending.120 The banking system (80 
percent of financial system assets) is largely focused on servicing the largest Nigeria 
corporations in the oil and telecoms sectors and the "value chains" associated with them. Banks 
perceive that lending 'beyond the frontier' is too risky, particularly given the recent rise in 
Treasury security interest rates. 
54. Nigeria is a diverse country with poorly integrated markets. Most Nigerian states still 
function largely in isolation and face enormous challenges in moving their economies beyond 
subsistence agriculture and local services. To benefit from economies of scale, sharpen 
international competitiveness, and improve non-oil growth and income levels, there is a need for 
better integration of markets in goods and services, labour, and finance within the country. At 
present, the efficient functioning of Nigeria’s domestic market is impeded by physical, policy 
and administrative barriers, including poor infrastructure and multiple taxes, fees, and 
inspections that constrain the movement of goods and services. Coordinated efforts are needed at 
both the federal and state levels to remove these barriers. 
55. The country has a large infrastructure deficit, particularly in power and transport. Power: 
The electricity grid supplies approximately 4,300 MW of available generation, against an 
estimated demand of approximately 10,000 MW. Rural accessibility remains a serious problem,

with major repercussions for agricultural and rural development; and 83 percent of Nigerian 
business owners consider lack of electricity the biggest obstacle to doing business.121  
56. The Government’s power sector reform program is one of the most comprehensive and 
complex ever undertaken in Africa. The program (a) establishes an independent regulator for the 
sector, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission; (b) sets up a commercial framework for 
the sector, with cost-reflective electricity tariffs; (c) establishes a bulk trader; (d) privatizes the 
Power Holding Company of Nigeria’s (PHCN) six successor generation companies; (f) 
privatizes the eleven PHCN successor distribution companies; and (g) continues efforts to 
strengthen the gas-to-power segment. The first three pillars are already in place, and have led to 
some tangible improvements in available supply, increased grid stability, increased revenue 
collection, and the introduction of a cost-reflective, multi-year tariff. The privatization process is 
ongoing but faces resistance that will require sustained commitment to overcome. 
57. Any 
increase 
in electricity generation 
is dependent on 
improved gas-to-power 
infrastructure. Nigeria has an estimated 185 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, the eighth largest 
in the world and the largest in Africa. Increasing attention is now being given to this vital sector, 
both to meet increasing domestic demand and to develop regional exports. The development of 
alternative markets for Nigerian gas – LNG exports through the Bonny LNG terminal; regional 
exports through the 678 km West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP)122 to Benin, Ghana, and Togo – 
has increased incentives for commercializing gas assets. The Government has responded by 
developing the Gas Master Plan, which outlines reforms needed in the sector. Initial results can 
already be seen. Gas deliveries to the domestic market and the power sector reached 1000 
mmscfd in 2012, an all-time high, compared to only about 300 mmscfd in 2009. Commercial 
negotiations are advancing to establish fair and equitable gas supply and aggregation contracts. 
And the improved availability and lower cost of gas compared to alternative fuels have triggered 
renewed interest from WAGP countries, which want to increase deliveries beyond the 133 
mmscfd already agreed. 
58. Transport: Nigeria’s national rail network is second only to South Africa’s in length, but 
traffic volumes have all but collapsed. 123 Due to deficient performance and erratic services, 
traffic volumes have been on a long-term decline from 3 million tons in 1960 to 15,000 tons in 
2005 – equivalent to about five trucks per day.124 
59. Revamping the transport infrastructure sector remains one of the key focal points for 
supporting growth. The Government has committed to a massive rehabilitation of roads and 
airports across the country, and has intensified efforts to fix the railways. However, an integrated 
multi-modal approach is needed to prioritize projects, and to take advantage of growth corridors 
and increasing urbanization over the medium term. Spatial planning could be particularly 
advantageous. In addition to facilitating greater integration across the housing, transport, energy 
and industry sectors, spatial planning would help to align rural road and agricultural development 
policies; align national and local systems of urban and rural development; and take account of 
environmental considerations. Rural areas in Nigeria are poorly connected to cities, resulting in 
weak value chains for agricultural products and slow rates of off-farm job creation. A multi-

modal, spatial planning approach could also serve as a framework for phasing investments in line 
with available resources.  
60. Skills:  An adequate skills base is essential to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic 
growth. Nigeria faces skills gaps in both formal and informal sectors which are hindering the 
country’s efforts to improve competitiveness and increase employment. Universities and 
technical and vocational training institutions tend to be supply rather than demand driven. This 
leads to many graduates being unable to find jobs, while skills remain in short supply in some 
industries. 125  The first pilot from Assessment of Core Competence for Employability in the 
Services Sector (ACCESS)126 in Abuja, Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, and Enugu found that students do 
not have the skills needed for employment in that sector.127  Critical factors contributing to the 
low quality and relevance of training include a poor learning environment, as measured by 
physical facilities, essential textbooks, and instructional aids; lack of teachers in core subjects 
and in rural areas; low teacher attendance; and poor teaching quality due to inadequate teacher 
training, low motivation, and limited opportunities for professional development. These 
problems are compounded by the lack of coordination and dialogue among training institutions, 
research institutions, universities, ministries, and private sector employers about needed skills 
and training opportunities. Underlying Nigeria’s skills gap are weak basic education system, the 
lack of coordination and dialogue between training institutions, research institutions, universities, 
and ministries with those from the industries and private sector, leading to out of date curriculum 
and low quality of education and training.  
61. Nigeria’s universal primary education policy, first implemented in 1976 and reinstated in 
1999 and 2004 mandates free, compulsory education, but the progress has been slow and 
regressed since 2006. Trends in gross enrollment rate (GER) and net enrollment rate (NER) in 
primary school show deterioration in access to primary school in recent years. GER, after 
improving from 84.2 percent in 1990 to 102.9 percent in 2006, declined to 83.3 percent in 2010. 
At the same time, not much effort was made to get children to start school on time. The NER 
stayed flat at 61.3 percent from 1999 and even decreased slightly to 57.6 percent in 2010.  
62. While access to education has been shrinking at the primary level, it has expanded 
substantially at the secondary and tertiary levels. Secondary GER almost doubled from 24.3 
percent in 1990 to 44 percent in 2010. The territory enrollment rate increased about six fold from 
1.9 percent to 11.9 percent, setting Nigeria at a level twice as high as the average African country 
(6.8 percent) and comparable with the average South Asian country (15.3 percent). This increase, 
however, would need to be balanced with the emphasis on primary education in terms of 
enrollment and education outcomes, so to strengthen the country’s skill base and, importantly, to 
ensure that the poorest and most disadvantaged children are not left out of primary school while 
secondary and tertiary schools are expanded for middle-class children. 

iii. Social Welfare 

63. Wide spread poverty:  In spite of strong economic growth in the last decade, poverty in 
Nigeria remains widespread. The poverty headcount declined marginally from 48.4 percent in 

125 World Bank, 2006.

2003-2004 to 46 percent in 2009-2010 (using adult equivalent methodology), but, given the 
growth in the population, this implies an increase in the number of Nigerians living in poverty 
from 60 to 75 million. Poverty rates vary across and within states. While some parts of the 
country, most notably Lagos, are experiencing genuine economic booms that are reducing 
poverty, a number of other states are most likely growing at a rate less than that of the 
population.  
64. Across states, there is also a remarkable stability in poverty levels and trends. Some 6 in 10 
states that had the lowest poverty rates in 2004 continued to be among the top 10 lowest poverty 
states in 2010. However, as noted above a few states have made substantial progress, in reducing 
poverty during the period. As indicated below, Lagos State has the lowest estimated poverty rate 
of 22.9 percent, while Jigawa has the highest at 77.5 percent. These numbers confirm the fact 
that poverty is particularly concentrated in the Northern part of the country, while the South 
West experiences the lowest poverty rates. Average poverty rates for the North East and North 
West areas are 59.7 and 58 percent, respectively, while the North Central has an average rate of 
48.8. By contrast, average rates in the South West, South East, and South South are 30.6, 39, and 
37.6, respectively. By far, the Lagos State made the greatest strides toward poverty reduction 
between 2003-2004 and 2009-2010, reducing its estimated poverty rate from 43.8 to 22.9 
percent. By contrast, a number of States, particularly in the North, made little or no progress in 
reducing their poverty rates over this period.

79. Unemployment:  Jobs are an important component of poverty reduction, increased 
productivity, and social cohesion, and therefore are a cornerstone of development.128  Yet the 
pace of growth has so far not delivered significant employment opportunities for the population, 
particularly in the North-West, where the unemployment rate was 21.5 percent in 2009, 
compared to a low of 8.9 percent in the South-East. Nigeria is grappling with how best to 
provide opportunities to its burgeoning young workforce. Youth unemployment is particularly 
worrisome (37.7 percent for the age group 15-24 and 22.4 percent for the age group 25-44).129 
With persistent high fertility rates of 5.5 births per woman (2010) 130 and 43 percent of the 
population below 15 years of age (2010), the projected strong population growth will further 
complicate this challenge. Most demographic growth will be in people of working age (15-64), 
and Nigeria faces the urgent challenge of absorbing them into productive employment. Failure to 
do so could become a major source of social and political instability. These challenges are 
complex in nature, but with well-coordinated and multi-sectoral approaches, they could be 
transformed into opportunities to capture the demographic dividend through skills enhancement 
of young people.

80. Disparities:  Wide disparities in terms of gender, geographical boundaries, and 
geopolitical zones complicate economic and social development. The country is ranked 79th out 
of 86 in the 2012 Social Institutions and Gender Index (OECD), and 120th out of 135 in the 2011 
Global Gender Gap Index. Gender gaps are particularly notable in access to education, 
household decision making, and political representation. The Nigeria Digest of Education 
Statistics (2006-2010) shows 54,434 public primary schools in Nigeria, with an enrollment of 
24.4 million, of which females account for 11.1 million (45.5 percent), indicating a gender parity 
index of 83.6. The rural North has persistently lower primary completion rates than other 
regions, and many children do not even complete primary school until age 18; and its secondary 
completion rate of 54 percent is significantly below that of the urban South, at 54 compared to 89 
percent. (See para. 62 for analysis of overall education system.)  The same regional differences 
seen in education are also observed in health outcomes. Maternal mortality in the rural North-
East is 1,549, more than five times the national average.131  Malnutrition prevalence is highest in 
the North-West and North-East regions (35.1 and 34.5 percent, respectively) and lowest in the 
South-East and South-South (10.0 and 12.8 percent, respectively). 132 Regional disparities are 
also reflected in unemployment. In 2009, unemployment was highest in the North-West (21.5 
percent) and lowest in the South-East (8.9 percent). The youth labor force participation rate 
(males and females) is highest in the Northern zones, likely because school enrollment rates in 
these regions are the lowest in the country and more youths are out of school. The South-West 
zone has the lowest youth labor force participation rate, also likely due to the relatively high 
school enrollment rates in this zone. 
81. Health:  Investments in human capital development have not resulted in more inclusive 
growth or brought the country closer to reaching the Millennium Development Goals. Despite 
large investments in the health sector over the last decade, Nigeria’s health statistics are worse 
than the average for African countries. Nigeria has 2 percent of the world’s population but has 10 
percent of maternal deaths (545 per 100,000 live births), 10 percent of under-five mortality (157 
per 1,000 live births), and 25 percent of the world malaria burden. The country also has 10 
percent of the world burden for mother-to child-transmission of HIV. Nigeria lags behind the 
SSA average on three key health indicators:  the maternal mortality rate is 545 per one hundred 
thousand live births (versus the SSA average of 500); the infant mortality rate is 75 per one 
thousand live births (versus 65 for SSA); and the under-five mortality rate is 157 per one 
thousand live births (versus 104 for SSA). However, the Government has developed an 
integrated response under the “Saving One Million Lives” initiative which is very promising. 
82. Education:  Access to and quality of education remain important impediments to 
sustainable growth and equitable development. There is limited access for the poorest, the 
quality of education is inferior at all levels, and the enrollment rate in basic and secondary 
education is low. Many students, especially in the rural North, delay their completion of primary 
school.133  In the North, completion is as low as 24 percent. On average, only 37 percent of 
students finish primary school at the official graduation age of 11. A high percentage of students 
never finish secondary school. Only 75 percent finish secondary school by age 24, and the 
remaining 25 percent never finish. Nationally, only 29 percent of those who start school graduate

133 Completion rate is measured as the percentage of the population in the relevant age group who ever attended 
school and completed primary school.

from secondary school at the official age of 17. About 7 million children are not in school. The 
total number of illiterate adults, almost 22 million, places Nigeria among only ten countries 
worldwide with more than 10 million adult illiterates (15 years and above). Nigeria spends about 
5 percent of its GDP on education, which is in line with international benchmarks, but about 80 
percent of that spending is allocated to recurrent costs.  
83. Water supply and sanitation:  Are central to improvements in health in Nigeria, as they 
are for improvements in education, urban and rural development, development of industry and 
general economic development. Responsibility for water supply is shared between three levels of 
Government – federal, state and local. The federal Government is in charge of water resources 
management; state Governments have the primary responsibility for urban water supply; and 
local Governments together with communities are responsible for rural water supply. The 
responsibility for sanitation is not clearly defined. Water supply service quality and cost recovery 
are low. Water tariffs are low and many water users do not pay their bills. Service providers thus 
rely mostly on occasional subsidies to cover their operating costs. Investments are mainly 
financed by foreign donors and fall short of what is needed to achieve a significant increase in 
access.  
84. The challenges in the sector are huge. Over the last 20 years, access to safe drinking water 
increased by only 10 percent, from 48 percent of the population in 1990 to 58 percent in 2010.134  
During the same period, the share of those with access to improved sanitation actually declined 
by about 15 percent, from 37 to 31 percent. The sector has been weakened by poor operation and 
maintenance, inept institutions, poor tracking of budgeted funds and expenditures, insufficient 
technical capacity, lack of coordination across different levels of Government, and lack of inter-
sectoral coordination. These failures have dramatic consequences for lives, livelihoods, and 
development. 
85. Social protection:  The challenges of poverty and unemployment have highlighted the 
need to assess the effectiveness of the current approach to social protection. Public expenditure 
on social services and assistance programs has increased but is still insufficient. According to the 
annual reports of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), federal Government spending on social 
programs (including education and health but excluding pensions and other related transfers) 
rose from about 1.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to almost 2 percent in 2009. Social expenditures at 
the state level were significantly higher ‒ 2.9 percent of GDP in 2008. Combined social spending 
by the federal and state Governments increased between 2004 and 2008 to almost 5 percent of 
GDP, which is still quite low compared with other countries.135 
86. Over the last few decades, the Government has developed an array of social safety net and 
labor programs, but they are poorly targeted, have limited coverage, are not evaluated 
periodically, and are generally insufficiently funded. The conditional cash transfer (CCT) program 
that was introduced as part of the National Poverty Eradication Program (NAPEP) is the first major 
social safety net that is targeted and well-resourced at both the federal and state levels. The 
Government of Nigeria has shown an interest in CCT interventions as a way to reduce both short-
term and long-term poverty, especially where effective supply-side interventions are in place. The 
Government’s interest in this approach was prompted by the fact that it combines the transfer of

resources to the poorest households with incentives to increase investments in human capital, 
which is relevant to the nature of poverty and vulnerability in Nigeria.  

iv. Climate Change 
Challenges 

and Environmental Degradation 

87. Nigeria is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The 2012 flood was the worst in a 
century. Preliminary estimates from the Post Disaster Needs Assessment suggest that the damage 
and losses are the worst in Nigeria’s history. Nigeria’s disaster profile is characterized by 
extreme hydro-meteorological events which will likely increase in frequency and magnitude due 
to climate change. Neither Nigeria’s monitoring and early warning systems nor its response 
mechanisms are well developed.  
88. The cost of ongoing environmental degradation and associated disasters is likely to 
increase under a business-as-usual scenario. Nationwide, cropland degradation accounts for 
between 1.7 and 6.4 percent of GDP.136 Land degradation is accelerating in the South-East and 
land degradation and environmental insecurity are also accelerating in the arid and semi-arid 
North. High population growth and poverty levels, resource depletion, rainfall variability, 
recurrent droughts and floods, soil infertility and erosion, and deforestation threaten the 80 
percent of Northern Nigerians who depend on land and water resources for their economic and 
physical security. Nigeria’s woody savannah systems are also under stress from clearing and 
reduced rainfall. 
89. Environmental pollution and governance, 
including enhanced 
transparency 
in 
environmental decision making; management of natural resource rents; and environmental 
assessment and management; as well as waste and chemicals management is central to the 
environmental sustainability and the actualization of the Government’s Transformation Agenda. 
In general three major sources of pollution can be identified in Nigeria. They include (i) 
industrial waste including massive oil spills have continued for decades and compromised 
important mangrove and inland wetlands and fisheries in the Niger delta, (ii) domestic/municipal 
waste, (iii) radioactive/hazardous waste and e-waste, as Nigeria hosts numerous disposal sites. 
90. As Nigeria works toward becoming one of the top 20 world economies by 2020, air 
pollution could also become an issue. Achieving that goal might entail a doubling by 2035 of 
emissions compared to current levels; and throughout the period, cumulative emissions might 
add up to some 11.6 billion tons of CO2—five times the estimated historical emissions over 
1900-2005. 
91. Nigeria already has several policies and strategic initiatives which if properly implemented 
can serve as adaptive as well as mitigating climate change measures. Thus, the country has many 
options to grow its economy with full respect for the ecological integrity of the country.137  The 
national benefits of the low-carbon strategy include cheaper and more diversified provision of 
electricity (with total savings up to 2035 on the order of 7 percent, or US$12 billion); more 
efficient operations in the oil/gas industry (with discounted net benefits on the order of US$7.5 
billion); more climate resilient and more productive agriculture (with net additional benefits to

farmers on the order of 0.2 percent of GDP); and better transport services (resulting in economies 
of fuel, better air quality, reduced congestion). Over 25 years, the emission of some 2.4 billion 
tons of CO2e could be avoided, while at the same time reaping domestic benefits. 
92. Building a climate resilient society within a 
low-carbon/high growth economic 
development framework will (a) integrated and comprehensive disaster risk management, (b) 
climate-responsive infrastructure development, (c) appropriate research and development, (vi) 
capacity building, institutional strengthening and governance, and (d) sustainable and 
coordinated climate change financing. 

D. CAF FRAMEWORK AND FOCUS 

79. The CAF framework combines the growth and job agenda, to support the Government to 
establish a platform for strong, sustained, socially and regionally inclusive growth. 

a. Fundamentals 

80. Macroeconomic stability, an enabling business environment, investments in human capital, 
the rule of law, and respect for property and personal rights are essential for growth and job 
creation. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment 
climate and thus influence investment prospects and job creation by private firms. While good 
outcomes in nutrition, health, and education are development goals in themselves, they are also 
important from the growth and jobs perspective, because they equip people for productive 
employment. Rule of law and respect for rights are critical to give the private sector the 
confidence to invest and operate. In Nigeria and other countries that need to manage resource-

133 

 
 
 
related risks, fundamentals also include efficient, accountable, and transparent public sector 
management, i.e., good governance.

In support of sound macroeconomic management, the CAF partners will (a) provide the 
Government with financial support and offer regular analytical and policy advice aimed at 
improving budget and public financial management, deepening financial systems, ensuring debt 
sustainability, and enhancing the capacity for collecting and analyzing statistics. The partners 
will also support (b) a range of core diagnostic work to improve fiscal sustainability, including 
public expenditure reviews, fiduciary assessments, and expenditure tracking studies; (c) activities 
to increase mobilization of domestic revenues, reform utilities and enhance public service 
performance, and improve the selectivity and effectiveness of public investment; (d) provide 
analytical support on a range of issues associated with growth and its distributional aspect.  

ii. Improved Enabling Environment 

82. Nigeria lacks the operating environment that businesses need to take full advantage of the 
many economic opportunities in the country. The most pressing constraints are infrastructure and 
financing. Accordingly, CAF support will focus on reducing infrastructure constraints to 
economic diversification and job creation; and on fostering the financial sector’s role in 
development. 
83. Power sector:  To improve the capacity and reliability of its generation, transmission, and 
distribution systems, Nigeria needs to: (a) ensure that the policy and reform agenda continues to 
move forward; (b) institute cost-reflective tariffs and appropriate commercial practices; (c) 
increase transparency in Government investment decisions, sector subsidies, and award of power 
purchase agreements (PPAs); (d) improve accountability by private operators, GENCO/DISCO 
management, and sector staff; and (e) develop the “Sustainable Energy for All” (SE4all) agenda 
for rapid expansion of electricity access, and related analytical data and reports. CAF support 
will also strengthen the Government’s capacity to develop sound technical and analytical reports 
for the sector, to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of future investments in service 
expansion. These analytical products will include: (a) a power demand forecast; (b) a least-cost 
generation and transmission system expansion plan; (c) a detailed rural access expansion plan for 
each state; (d) viable pilots for sustainable off-grid provision of electricity and other energy 
services for cooking and productive uses; and (e) investment-ready feasibility and scoping 
studies for alternative and renewable energy generating options. The partners will provide 
analytical and advisory activities in support of prioritizing sector investments in a context of 
limited financial resources. The CAF will also assist the Government in covering the payment 
risk of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Co. as it enters into PPAs with independent power 
producers (IPPs); and support to Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Co. to establish a culture of 
excellence and transparency to give investors the confidence to develop cost-efficient electricity 
generation projects.  
84. Transportation: In the transportation sector, priority will be given to creating 
infrastructure that improves connections to markets. A spatial knowledge platform will be 
developed to support: (a) coordination of ongoing activities; (b) geographically focused 
interventions; (c) prioritizing and sequencing of future investments in support of value chain 

134 

 
 
development; and (d) identification of future investments. Partners will promote an integrated 
and strategic approach to infrastructure planning, financing, operation and maintenance, and 
collaborate with the National Planning Commission to develop the Nigeria Integrated 
Infrastructure Master Plan. Other strategic priorities include strengthening institutions, ensuring 
the sustainability of assets, enhancing accountability, and building capacities among the various 
state and federal agencies. The partners will also look for opportunities to support projects aimed 
at increasing the integration of poorer-performing states and at shifting to more efficient modes 
of transport. 
85. Access to finance:  Lack of access to finance appears to be a barrier in particular for small 
business, which generally contributes significantly to the GDP of African economies. The easing 
barriers to access to finance to small business could significantly reduce bottlenecks to 
employment growth. The CAF partners will provide advisory and analytical support for fostering 
the financial sector’s role in development, including regarding infrastructure and SMEs 
financing. 

iii. Human Capital 

86. As a country with a population of 162 million, Nigeria has tremendous human potential, 
which can be a source of immense creativity and innovation. To take full advantage of this 
demographic dividend and unlock human capital potential of all its people, Nigeria needs to 
overcome daunting challenges across a range of sectors, including education, social protection, 
skills development, and health and nutrition. Poor access to water and sanitation puts a 
particularly heavy burden on women and children, who spend a good portion of each day 
securing sufficient water for the households. 
87. Health outcomes:  Nigeria’s weak health outcomes undermine its competitiveness. The 
CAF partners are committed to supporting the Government’s Saving One Million Lives (SOML) 
initiative, which aims to strengthen the policy framework and systems aimed at improving 
nutrition. CAF support will focus on developing (a) an enabling environment for private health 
insurance; and (b) robust performance management and data tracking systems for health service 
delivery (The same types of systems will be used to track education service delivery.)  Analytical 
work will focus on constraints and challenges that the poor and vulnerable face in accessing 
welfare-enhancing services. The results will help inform the support of CAF partners to all levels 
of Government to scale up innovative and successful targeting mechanisms and tools to ensure 
equity in social services delivery and utilization. Additionally, the CAF will support annual 
reviews of the effectiveness of MDG-related expenditures, as well as studies to investigate 
constraints and propose solutions for overcoming them. 
88. CAF support will also aim to improve the lives of women by (a) improving the quality of 
maternal health services; (b) facilitating access to credit and land for women in agriculture, and 
access to credit and skills training for women entrepreneurs; (c) improving and strengthening 
legal rights and protections for women; and (d) piloting and mainstreaming gender in 
development programs. 
89. Skills:  A skilled and productive labor force is critical for Nigeria to achieve its Vision 
20:2020 goals. The CAF partners will support the Government in (a) addressing weaknesses in 
the primary education, including improving reading and numeracy skills, (b) making technical 
and vocational education more relevant to the needs of the economy; (c) improving the quality of 

135 

 
 
educational outcomes; and (d) increasing cooperation with the private sector and non-
Governmental organizations. The partners will also support Nigeria’s efforts to bolster its 
knowledge economy through enhanced science and technological research and teaching. 
Analytical work will include a diagnostic on the large segment of Nigeria youth with limited 
basic skills or without secondary or tertiary education. Assistance for implementing reforms and 
developing the technical education and training sector will focus on priority sectors and the 
North. In addition, the CAF partners will support results-based pilots to increase access to and 
quality of education, including public-private partnerships in the education sector. The CAF 
support will also focus on livelihood projects at the state and Federal levels, providing skills 
training for rural youth and connecting young people to jobs or entrepreneurship opportunities 
through innovative approaches. 
90. Water and sanitation:  The CAF partners will assist the Government in developing (a)  
country-wide baseline to track Nigeria’s progress towards meeting the water-related MDGs; (b) 
measurable service standards for State Water Boards; and (c) an integrated approach to 
improving water supply delivery (quality and coverage), and ensuring that water and sanitation 
services are sustainable, cost effective, and affordable to the poor. This shift in approach aims to 
transform the incentive structure and overall performance of the sector. 
91. The CAF partners stand ready to continue partnering with Nigeria to address the huge 
challenges facing the sector, with a focus on reforms to improve governance and service 
delivery. The focus will be on developing and implementing a common results-based approach 
to providing financing to States, based on their commitment to reform and improved 
performance. Some states have already initiated various reforms to improve performance with 
respect to water supply and sanitation services. 

iv. Governance 

92. The strategy to promote stronger capacity for governance and good governance will focus 
on dialogue with the Government and assistance to build capacity of key institutions. The CAF 
partners regard strengthened public financial management and reduced corruption as critical for 
development. Support will be provided to strengthening public financial management systems at 
all levels of Government, deepening the engagement with the Government on civil service 
reform, and to basing planning on accurate and timely management of data and sound human 
resources management. Continued support to civil society will be critical to strengthen the 
demand side for effective, accountable and transparent public sector management. 
93. The CAF will also aim to support further consolidation of democracy, strengthening the 
rule of law, and oversight institutions. In this context, the CAF partners will endeavor to 
strengthen and deepen their understanding of the politics of reform in the country and of the 
complex structure of its governance challenges to better inform their intervention models. 
Recognizing the complexity of this reform area, partners will also work on deepening the 
understanding budgetary flows at different levels of Government. The engagement will include 
pilot engagements at different levels of the policy reform chain to assess the most effective entry 
points including efforts at the policy and project levels with Government stakeholders as well as 
non-state actors. 

136 

 
 
b.       Strategic Directions 

94. Product and market diversification and job creation are critically important for Nigeria’s 
sustained growth and continued progress toward the MDGs. 

i. Promote Product Diversification in the Non-oil Sector 

95. Experience has shown that incomes in a country tend to converge to the level dictated by 
the complexity of their productive structures. This indicates the importance of creating the 
conditions that would allow complexity and innovation to emerge. 138 In Nigeria, this means 
expanding and multiplying value chains in the non-oil sector. Results from other countries 
suggest that innovative products and new value chains can be created either by combining 
existing capabilities in new ways; or acquiring critical new capabilities, often through foreign 
investment, and combining them with existing capabilities.139  As shown by the case of Chile, 
Government initiatives can play a critical role in this process. 

ii. Integrate Markets Domestically and Regionally 

96. 
Increasing domestic, regional, and global market integration can help to drive product 
diversification and job creation, and significantly boost Nigeria’s efforts to achieve non-oil 
growth. Better domestic integration would contribute to more balanced growth among Nigeria’s 
states, helping weaker performing states to converge more quickly with the better performers. 
This will require the removal of policy and regulatory barriers across states. The CAF partners 
will continue to engage with the Government on the increased integration of domestic markets, 
as well as on issues related to regional and global integration. 
97. As noted above, one of the key challenges to improving market connections in Nigeria is 
the large infrastructure deficit. A suggested way forward is to use the proposed spatial planning 
platform to align infrastructure investment with programs in strategic sectors of the economy. 
For example, rural accessibility remains a serious problem in Nigeria, with major repercussions 
for agricultural and rural development; and better alignment of rural road projects with 
agricultural development priorities would increase rural access and regional connectivity, with 
positive spillover effect on product diversification and job creation. 
98. The CAF partners will seek to establish the spatial analysis platform in order to provide the 
Government with a better understanding of the geographical distribution of economic resources 
and their uses, markets and access to them, and how infrastructure services link and affect both. 
According to this multi-sectoral approach, infrastructure is viewed as a shared input to a range of 
downstream economic sectors (such as agriculture, mining, tourism, industry, manufacturing and 
services) and its simultaneous impact on the output of each of these sectors is explicitly taken 
into account. With limited fiscal space for public investment in infrastructure, the use of this 
platform to enhance selectivity and efficiency would also help to strengthen public service 
management and accountability. According to the Public Investment Management Index (PMI)

developed by the International Monetary Fund, Nigeria now ranks in the bottom third – 52nd out 
of 71 surveyed countries.140 
99. Market integration also depends on reform and standardization of the procurement system 
at the national and state levels. Uniform rules, procedures, and incentives are critical for an 
efficient and fair public procurement system. The CAF partners will continue supporting the 
authorities in developing procurement-related legislation and capacities, including management 
information systems; and will facilitate knowledge sharing and networking among public 
procurement institutions in Nigeria. 

iii. Enhance the private sector’s developmental role and 
stimulate entrepreneurship 

100. The private sector is the main engine of job creation and the source of nearly nine out of 
ten jobs in the world. 141 Accordingly, Nigeria’s job creation strategy needs to be embedded 
within the broader strategy, as articulated in the Transformation Agenda, to promote private 
sector growth and entrepreneurship. However, the existing legal framework suffers from poor 
enforcement. In addition, there is ineffective coordination among ministries regulating the 
private sector and between the Government and the private sector; and many ministries have 
limited capacity to implement reforms. Despite those challenges, Nigeria has significant private 
sector potential, with investment opportunities in the telecommunications, construction, 
agribusiness, and tourism sectors. If these opportunities are realized, they will provide substantial 
sources of job creation and diversified growth.  
101. Private sector involvement is also essential for strengthening the country’s skills base and 
identifying gaps. Further, the projected strong population growth and lack of capacity in the 
public education system is likely to increase the importance of the private sector in the delivery 
of education and training services, particularly for the large number of people with low or no 
skills which are beyond school age. 
102. A stronger technological base is key to strong and sustained non-oil growth. Since 
commercial markets are the primary vehicles for technology transfer, these activities need to be 
in line with country development goals. A Government-supported technology transfer program 
could provide incentives and vehicles for domestic businesses acquire or develop innovative 
technologies. The success of such a program, however, will depend on a stronger intellectual 
property rights regime. Historically, businesses have been reluctant to engage in markets that 
lack adequate protection of property rights. The CAF partners will provide support the 
authorities to improve the enabling environment for technological transfer and innovation, giving 
priority to sectors with strong multiplier effects. 
103. Nigeria’s informal economy has been estimated to account for as much as 58 percent of 
GNP,142 and because it is so large it has significant potential for business and job creation. Small 
enterprises and entrepreneurs may not be interested in formalizing, due to limited capacity or 

140 The PMI measures the performance of public investment management in four areas – appraisal, selection, 
implementation, and evaluation. Nigeria fared particularly badly on selection and evaluation categories. The main 
project selection criteria are integration with the budget, legislative scrutiny, and public scrutiny. The main elements 
of the evaluation criteria are evaluation, audit, and assets management.

142 Schneider, 2002. The exact size of the informal economy is difficult to measure due to the scarcity of data.  

138 

 
 
                                                 
risks associated with the transfer to the formal sector,143 but they often spread their risks and 
wealth by expanding horizontally. The CAF will support analytical work aimed at building a 
knowledge platform for sharing and scaling up successful entrepreneurial practices in the 
informal sector.  

c.     Approach 

104. Targeting:  High unemployment and the need to diversify the economy have led the 
Government to target sectors with large multiplier effects and job creation potential, such as 
housing and agriculture. This approach reflects the increasing recognition that some form of 
vertical policy is probably inevitable for resource-rich countries seeking to diversify, since 
market forces alone will tend to pull the country back toward resource dependence. 
Paradoxically, this resource wealth also makes it easier to support diversification efforts, since it 
gives Governments the means to finance public investments that can bring down the costs of 
production for non-resource traded sectors.144 This vertical/targeted approach is therefore also 
important for job creation.145 
105. In the housing sector, the CAF will support the development of long-term housing finance, 
the lack of which has been a major barrier to the growth of the housing market. Other obstacles 
include difficulties with property registration, titling, and the cost and time involved in 
foreclosure. The opaque land allocation and city planning processes are further sources of 
insecurity to households, leading to informal practices in land transactions or related 
investments. A legal framework for foreclosure exists; however, its implementation is not 
sufficiently clear and encourages informal practice. The housing sector also suffers from high 
construction costs, which limits the development of affordable housing. The CAF will support a 
coordinated approach to all parts of the value chain, with a focus on (a) land and legal 
framework, (b) access to housing finance, and (c) housing development. 
106. CAF support will also aim to enhance understanding of Nigeria’s urbanization challenges, 
and provide a platform to engaging with the Government to address those challenges. Financial, 
analytical, and advisory support will be provided for (a) strengthening of urban management, 
infrastructure, and service delivery systems across the urban hierarchy; (b) in situ slum 
upgrading; and (c) selective developments in metropolitan areas. A spatial knowledge platform 
will be constructed to support the coordination of ongoing activities, focus geographically 
planned interventions, and identify and prioritize future investments. 
107. In the agriculture sector, the CAF will engage across the following operational areas: (a) 
inclusive agricultural and rural growth; (b) technologies for increased productivity and climate 
resilience; (c) nutrition security; (d) agricultural markets; and (e) water and natural resources 
management. Engagement will be underpinned by financial and analytical work. The overall 
emphasis will be on innovation, and on addressing constraints to the development of selected 
value chains, strengthening systems, and supporting collective action (especially among women) 
to facilitate access to better economic opportunities.

108. Understand the challenges:  CAF support will focus on removing blockages that have 
prevented targeted sectors from reaching their potential. The effectiveness of this approach will 
depend on an in-depth understanding of political economy dynamics in a country that is (a) 
primarily agrarian but rapidly urbanizing; (b) rich in resources but with large regional disparities; 
(c) facing security challenges, including high youth unemployment. It will be important, for 
example, to understand how job creation challenges in Nigeria’s rural areas vary from those in 
growing cities, or in the manufacturing sectors. Moreover, security challenges, high 
unemployment, and poverty in the North may dictate that higher priority be given to labor-
intensive sectors than to those with high growth potential. 
109. Tensions created by Nigeria’s regional disparities highlight the need for geographically 
broad-based and inclusive development, and for improving access to and quality of public 
services in both urban and rural areas. The CAF will seek to strengthen the focus on the Northern 
states by developing a comprehensive understanding of: 
 
the condition of and policies regarding semi-arid and arid lands, and the capacities 
of institutions responsible for land and water management in the region;   
 barriers to better performance in the education and health sectors; and 
 
the precise nature of the challenges to economic diversification and job creation in 
the region. 
110. The findings from this analytical work will provide a platform for engaging with the 
Government on designing an integrated approach to growth and job creation in the North. They 
will also inform the ongoing and planned CAF-supported projects in the region. 
111. Reduce vulnerabilities:  For a country to respond effectively to shocks and protect its 
vulnerable citizens, it needs a coherent social safety net system. To date, Nigeria does not have a 
broad-based social protection system and policy. Developing an effective social safety net 
system with interventions focused on youth employment and empowerment and demand-side 
support for human capital development as the starting point would help in increasing 
opportunities for the poor and increasing household resilience to shocks. 
112. Nigeria is increasingly aware of its vulnerability to climate change risks, as demonstrated 
by the recent floods. The CAF will assist the Government and other stakeholders in also 
recognizing the risks associated with environmental and natural resource degradation, and in 
developing strategies, governance arrangements, monitoring and early warning systems, and 
response mechanisms for natural hazards. 
113. To reduce the vulnerabilities of the rural population, the partners will assist national and 
state authorities in implementing rural-livelihood projects to promote inclusive growth, building 
on existing support for community-driven development initiatives. The three-pronged approach 
will aim at (a) improving existing livelihoods, by working with farmers to diversify products, 
lower production costs, and identify stable markets for their goods; (b) identifying self-
employment opportunities and providing technical assistance for business development; and (c) 
developing skills that are better matched to the needs of the market. 
114. Monitor for Results:  The successful implementation of the diversification and job 
creation drive requires the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. It is thus imperative that 
there is a sustained effective process that links the implementing agents and provides due public 

140 

 
 
awareness of the strategy and priorities. The strategy, in turn, will only be a success if it can be 
implemented effectively and timeously, hence the critical importance of ensuring that programs 
are held accountable against measurable and transparent milestones. 

E. CAF PRINCIPLES AND MODALITY OF ENGAGEMENT 

115. Principles:  The CAF is centered on three principles, which are consistent with those 
articulated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. These are: 
 Supporting implementation of the country-owned strategy to achieve the MDGs and 
other developmental goals. 
 Collaborating more effectively, both among development partners and with the Government. 
 Focusing on results and outcomes (including managing resources and improving 
decision-making for results, and strengthening systems for monitoring and evaluation). 
116. The CAF partners will build on progress made in harmonizing development assistance in 
Nigeria. The partners will strive to increasingly (i) use common arrangements to deliver aid, (ii) 
harmonize programming and policy dialogue, and to rationalize engagement in sectors, choice of 
aid instruments, and advisory capacity. They will seek to achieve greater harmonization at sector 
level, including through aligning partners’ support with sector priorities agreed with the 
Government and complementing support provided by other partners. 
117. The key element that will guide this work is a country-based approach that emphasizes 
country ownership and Government leadership, includes capacity building, recognizes diverse 
aid modalities, and engages non-Governmental stakeholders, including civil society and the 
private sector.  
118. The partners will seek to support the Government in leading the overall consultative 
institutions, including organizing and chairing consultative groups, high-level meetings, working 
groups and similar arrangements, and providing the secretariat. This requires adequate staffing, 
resources and appropriate location within the Government structure. Where necessary, the CAF 
partners will seek support the co-ordination process financially and technically. 
119. The CAF assistance will comprise financial and analytical and advisory support. The 
partners will finance the implementation of the CAF through four main channels: budget and 
project support to the Government, support to the programs of civil society organizations, 
assistance to the private sector, and support channeled through U.N. agencies. The financing 
support will be complemented with analytical work and policy dialogue to build institutions and 
strengthen capacity in key areas and to provide the foundation for future support. 
120. The CAF is flexible; partners will adapt their level and nature of support in response to 
emerging national developments and needs, as feasible. Adjustments will be made in 
consultation with the Government and with other partners. The annual CAF review process will 
provide the opportunity for identifying and agreeing any changes.  
121. The CAF builds on Nigeria’s recent achievements, but also incorporates lessons learnt 
from the partner’s engagement in the country, to develop transformational and innovative 
solutions to tackle Nigeria’s most pressing challenges. In particular, the CAF will: 

141 

 
 
 Focus on catalytic interventions which are innovative in design and approach and, 
scaled up with Government resources, would provide additional benefits that could 
far exceed their initial direct impact;  
 Enhance the synergy between state and national interventions and facilitate a mutual 
dialogue of different levels of Government around results;  
 Enhance the role of knowledge partnerships in building capacity at state level, 
supporting the federal Government in furthering its reform agenda, and developing 
platforms for engagement with the Government in new areas such as job creation, 
socio-economic development in the North, civil service reform and urbanization;  
 Promote an integrated approach to providing solutions/support, applying value chain 
approach where appropriate, and using the spatial analysis as one of the platforms for 
improving selectivity; 
 Leverage collaboration among partners to intensify support in selected areas with a 
view of accelerating the delivery of results. 
122. CAF engagement at the state level is based on the recognition of marked regional 
disparities in Nigeria. The CAF supports dynamic and reformist states and the scaling up of their 
emerging good practices, while also strengthening the capacity of weaker states to address their 
development challenges. The CAF partners will seek to support the States Governors Forum as a 
state-level platform for (a) dissemination of knowledge and experience; and (b) provision of 
flexible support to strengthen the capacity of state-level systems to meet common norms and 
standards.  
123. Modalities: In order to achieve the above objectives, the partners plan to follow some key 
practical modalities as follows: 
 Organize discussions on a selected number of priority sectors/themes (to be agreed 
upon with Government) through donor sector groups. A proposed list will be 
provided. Each group will be chaired (facilitated) by a partner who will take the 
leadership in facilitating periodic meetings, be the spoke person to represent partners 
in discussions with Governments and other stakeholders. TORs for the group will be 
reviewed and validated. 
 Use common implementation mechanisms as much as possible and leverage our 
instruments to maximize aid effectiveness in Nigeria. 
 Use the Governors Forum as a platform to organize strategic discussions with state 
and facilitate dissemination of knowledge and share experiences across states. 
 Develop a common approach to engage with states. 
 Use the development database to facilitate maintaining up to date information on aid 
in Nigeria and its recording in the Government budget, and  
 Develop a strategic platform for high level policy discussions with the Government. It 
will aim at meeting twice a year on strategic issues. 

142 

 
 
F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES  

124. There are several risks to the CAF implementation, including in-country violence and 
insecurity, a politically fluid situation leading to the 2015 elections, vested interests, regional 
instability, as well as economic volatility related to the fluctuation of oil prices. The CAF aims to 
be candid about identified risks and their impact - direct or indirect - on its implementation. 
125. The most important risk pertains to the security which remains challenging. The continuing 
incidents of terrorist activities and other acts of violence in the North and of kidnapping across 
the country could hinder achievement of national and sub-national development objectives. 
Tension, infighting, and conflict could become more pronounced as the 2015 election 
approaches, making reform increasingly difficult to accomplish. Another external shock that may 
impact Nigeria is the risk of spillover from Mali which could jeopardize the whole region. 
Bilateral partners will seek to support the Government’s efforts to reduce incidents of terrorist 
activities. The CAF partners will maintain dialogue with the Government on development of the 
North region, and provide non-lending and lending support to that end. The partners will seek to 
strengthen civil society organizations to deliver services and to increase their engagement in 
monitoring the rule of law and respect of rights. Should regional instability spill over to Nigeria, 
creating implementation difficulties for the CAF implementation, necessary adjustments to the 
program will be made in consultation with the Government. 
126. The volatile security situation is making supervision of projects challenging. To mitigate 
these risks, the CAF partners will seek to provide training and to undertake risk-based 
supervision missions as possible to help build capacity and ensure that adequate controls are in 
place for financial transactions and accuracy in financial reporting, audit and disbursement. The 
partners will establish an information sharing mechanism regarding their respective portfolio risk 
assessments and risk mitigation practices and experiences. 
127. Under the above circumstances, it is important for the CAF partners to focus on what is 
possible, help sustain momentum within the Government’s economic development program, and 
build support for reforms across all parts of the coalition Government as well as with civil 
society and the private sector. Given the volatility of the security environment and the upcoming 
elections, the CAF will remain flexible and will strategically adapt its engagement to respond to 
the evolving situation on the ground.  
128. With its largely oil-based economy, Nigeria is vulnerable to oil price fluctuations. While 
the risk of a major domestic crisis in Nigeria is not substantial, the implications of the global 
economic developments on Nigeria’s growth will need to be monitored closely. The need for a 
flexible approach that allows the partners to respond dynamically to such exogenous risks will be 
a hallmark of this CAF. The CAF partners will continue to make policy recommendations and 
support prudent macroeconomic management by the Government. Prudent macroeconomic 
management will remain the key to providing the fiscal space for the Government to adjust 
appropriately to external shocks when they occur. 
129. A lack of incentives for performance and poor coordination between Government agencies 
and across different levels of Government may slow down the reform implementation as well as 
undermine the success of the CAF assistance. The partners will seek to mitigate this risk through 
advocacy program for civil service reform and targeting their capacity building support to key 
program areas. 

143 

 
 
130. Gaps in capacity, especially at subnational level, and institutional weaknesses continue to 
pose challenges to the successful implementation of the partners’ programs. The increasingly 
transformative nature of programs, pushing the boundaries of the public sector expertise and 
hence having to deal with systemic issues such as institutional weaknesses and a lack of a 
systematic approach to monitoring and evaluation, contract and project management, or asset 
management poses many challenges to the CAF implementation. Continued attention is needed 
to support implementation of institutional reforms, adequate staffing, strengthening regulatory 
frameworks, and institutionalization of practices and systems for better project management. 
New projects will seek to address this concern through focused technical assistance, but 
increased efforts are needed to build capacity in local agencies to ensure longer-term 
sustainability of ongoing projects. Better collection of data is critical to effective and evidence-
based monitoring and evaluation, and in turn helps strengthen the focus on results. The CAF 
partners will also seek to pilot a governance filter to better identify ownership, capacity and 
institutional constraints and to systematically ensure that Government resources and policies are 
leveraged for development impact.  
131. The lack of clarity by the CAF partners regarding the preparation of the external borrowing 
plan and delays in its approval impacts the CAF implementation (Annex 1). The partners will 
engage with the Government on how best to align their respective annual assistance cycle with 
the Government’s processes and practices for external borrowing and regarding how to manage 
risks that delays in the Government approval of the borrowing plan create for partners’ own 
planning and programming cycle. 
132. Finally, the period leading to the elections will certainly reduce the momentum for major 
policy reforms as policy makers enter in electoral campaign. Again, partners will need to share 
views and harmonize ways to handle the dialogue during this period. Our counterparts are clearly 
indicating that 2013 is the year where most reforms can be implemented. It is therefore a window 
of opportunity that we must use collectively.

Introduction:  External Financing of projects in Nigeria is coordinated by two main interlocutors of Government:  International 
Economic Relations Department (IERD) and National Planning Commission (NPC). The IERD in the Federal Ministry of Finance is 
responsible for articulating the external funding needs and requests of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and state 
Governments based on the guidelines on foreign borrowing and the requirements in the National Implementation Plan (NIP).  
The International Cooperation Department (IC) in the National Planning Commission is responsible for the negotiation, 
coordination and monitoring of grants and other bilateral flows must sign on any bilateral Agreement as the National Authorization 
Officer (NAO) before such funds can be utilized. This matrix below presents the new guidelines provided by the Federal Executive 
Council (FEC) and Council of States (approved in 2001) which specified the terms and conditions under which foreign loans could be 
contracted.
