I. OVERVIEW 
1. 
The objective of this CPS is to help reduce poverty in Romania and foster 
sustainable income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population.   These goals will be 
achieved in the context of Romania’s economic convergence process within the EU and the 
EU2020, “smart sustainable and inclusive” agenda.  
2. 
The World Bank Group has forged a strong partnership of trust with Romania.  
The country has become a major borrower from the WBG, and has the largest program of 
reimbursable advisory services (RAS). Romania also became the 173rd member of IDA in April 
2014. Romania makes full use of all the Bank’s instruments and IFC has an extensive program of 
US$600m focused on banking, infrastructure and health. The WBG is complementary to and 
coordinates closely with the European Commission (EC), the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), and other financing institutions.   
3. 
EU accession has been good for growth and poverty reduction in Romania.  Between 
the year 2000 (when EU negotiations to join the EU began) up to the global financial crisis of 
2008, Romania grew at an average of 6 percent per annum: a rate that resulted in moving from 
27 to 48 percent of the EU average income per capita. The growth was shared broadly with the 
bottom two quintiles growing faster than the average.  
4. 
The financial crisis halted progress in poverty reduction and growth of incomes for 
the bottom forty percent, making progress on this agenda will require a more sustainable 
growth pattern underpinned by job creation in areas such as manufacturing, tradable services, 
and energy products. Such a new growth model will in turn require: (i) a well-functioning public 
sector; (ii) a strong business environment, access to credit, a skilled labor force and lifelong 
learning to ensure participation by aging workers; and (iii) policies to reach out to excluded 
groups that have not been able to participate in the labor market and have not benefited from 
social policies, particularly marginalized communities such as the Roma. 
5. 
The CPS is fully aligned with the WBG’s twin goals and the ECA regional strategy.  
Romania remains among the poorest countries in the EU with a GDP per capita of US$8,560 in 
2012 similar to countries in the Western Balkans and less than Turkey. Although poverty rates 
have come down significantly since joining the EU, they remain high: close to a third live below 
the ECA poverty line of US$5 per day. The ECA Regional Strategy supports inclusive and 
sustainable growth through a focus on competitiveness, inclusion, and climate change, and a 
renewed emphasis on governance as a cross-cutting theme.  
6. 
Our lending program focuses where we can contribute most to achieving the twin 
goals. During the CPS period, WBG lending will consist of a single DPL (part of a 
programmatic series) and 1-2 Investment Project Financing (IPFs) per year only (with an initial 
focus on the social sectors). The strategy will focus on selective engagement in the three areas 
presented below. IFC and MIGA will focus efforts on the growth and social inclusion pillars.  
These areas are based on detailed analytical work and extensive local consultation (see Annexes 
12 and 13).

7. 
The transformation associated with EU accession has been good for growth. 
Negotiations for Romania to join the EU began on February 15, 2000.  Between then and 2009, 
GDP per capita growth averaged more 
than 6 percent per annum, and per 
capita income (PPP) grew from about 
27 percent of the EU average to 48 
percent. Growth was fueled by a 
reallocation of 
labor 
from 
less 
productive 
sectors 
especially 
agriculture, 
to 
construction 
and 
services. Employment in construction 
grew quickly (8.3 percent per year), 
doubling from 4 to 8 percent of total 
employment, as it absorbed low-skilled 
migrants from rural areas who also 
moved into other non-tradable service 
sectors. Foreign direct 
investment, 
short-term debt, mainly in construction and services contributed to growth up until the crisis.

8. 
Since EU accession, growth has contributed significantly to poverty reduction, but 
almost a third of Romanians still live in poverty. The absolute poverty rate—based on the 
ECA regional poverty line of US$5 per person per day (2005 USD PPP) fell from 44 percent in 
2006 to 33 percent in 2008. The sharp decline in absolute poverty over this period was observed 
in both rural areas (from 60 to 47 percent) and urban areas (from 24 to 17 percent). Progress was 
also made in terms of EU indicators of poverty and social exclusion (Table 1). Despite these 
successes, Romania has one of the highest levels of poverty in the EU, higher than several 
neighboring countries that remain outside the EU (Figure 2). 

-2- 

9. While growth has favored the less well-off, the global financial crisis of 2008 
triggered a severe recession in Romania, halting income growth and poverty reduction. 
From 2006-2008, income growth was widely shared with the bottom 40 percent growing at an 
annual rate of 13 percent, compared to 9 percent for the population overall (Figure 3).  However, 
from 2008 to 2010, average per capita household incomes fell by 1.1 percent per year. The 
richest 20 percent were the hardest hit and their incomes dropped, while the incomes of the 
bottom 40 percent stagnated, increasing by only 0.2 percent annually. Absolute poverty (as 
measured by the US$5/day poverty line) remained essentially unchanged between 2008 and 2010 
(Figure A13).  Social transfers played an important role in mitigating the impact of the crisis on 
the bottom 40 percent, especially through increases in pension payments. However, the growth in 
pension costs and other social transfers contributed to a rise in fiscal deficits that is gradually 
being reduced. Further fiscal challenges will come from the demographic realities of Romania’s 
aging population, which has been exacerbated by the out-migration of younger workers.

10. The crisis also resulted in high non-performing loans in the banking sector that 
continue to constrain private sector growth. Recent reforms have helped rebuild capital 
buffers and provisioning and improved resolution of problem banks. Stress tests found that 
Romanian banks would remain resilient under the severe scenario of a deep depreciation of the 
currency and a prolonged recession, though a number of banks would have to raise additional 
capital. The capital adequacy ratio at about 14 percent is comfortable and provisioning covers 
over 90 percent of NPLs. The authorities continue to reinforce the bank resolution framework to 
deal with large systemic banks as well as smaller banks, and include least-cost tests and bailing-
in clauses to protect taxpayer resources. The authorities also plan to ensure that the deposit 
guarantee fund is compliant with the draft EU Banking Resolution and Recovery Directive.  
11. A new growth model is needed to boost growth and create more productive jobs.  The 
boost that Romania received from increased foreign direct investment (FDI) and cheap credit 
associated with EU accession is now over.  Much of the growth in wages and hours worked, 
which bolstered shared prosperity during the high growth years, was associated with a 
construction boom fueled by the large expansion of easy credit and public sector jobs. On the 

-3- 

 
demand side, growth was unbalanced with domestic demand playing the leading role and 
generating large external imbalances.  While earnings from employment will need to be the basis 
of sustainable inclusive growth in Romania, a return to pre-crisis credit conditions is unlikely (as 
banking supervision is strengthened across Europe), so sectors other than construction will likely 
need to take the lead in creating productive employment. The crisis also revealed a lack of 
progress on important structural issues such as a weak public administration, the continued 
dominance of the state in vital infrastructure sectors and a poor business environment.    
Macroeconomic outlook and debt sustainability 
12. Growth is picking up but Romania has yet to reach its potential.  After falling slightly 
in the summer of 2013, exports have continued an upward trend, boosted by an exceptional 
agriculture crop and were the driving force for growth, led by sales of machinery and 
transportation equipment and food items amid greater demand including from non-EU countries. 
At the same time, a fall in investment and low consumer demand has contributed to weaker 
imports bringing the current account close to balance by the end of 2013 (Annex 2). Economic 
growth is forecast at 2% in 2014, as exports continue to grow, albeit slower than in 2013, while 
consumer demand and public investment both increase (Table A2).  However, growth could be 
even higher if Romania was to overcome some of the structural obstacles outlined later.   
13. Prudent macroeconomic management underpins the rebound.  Tight fiscal policy has 
reduced the budget deficit, in cash terms, to close to 2.5 percent and the country exited from the 
EU’s excessive deficit procedures in June 2013.  The commitment to continued fiscal 
consolidation was clearly signaled in the amended budget passed in October 2013, which 
tightened discretionary spending across the board. The budget envisages holding the wage bill to 
7.3 percent of GDP and public pensions to 7.8 percent. However, to boost growth and provide 
fiscal space for co-financing of EU funded projects, the capital budget has been protected and 
total capital spending (including EU funds) is expected to rise from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2013 
to 6.1 percent in 2015. Romania continues to target a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 
2015, which should reduce government debt according to national legislation (excluding 
temporary financing) from about 40 percent of GDP in 2013 to 36 percent by 2018. Prudent 
monetary and fiscal policies are expected to anchor inflation expectations, maintain fiscal 
buffers, and reduce public debt. Inflation fell to the lower half of the +/- 1 percent band of the 2.5 
percent target during the last months of 2013 helped by lower food prices. However, inflationary 
pressures may come as a result of the liberalization of electricity markets (January 1st 2014) and 
gas markets (scheduled for July 1st, 2014), but core inflation should stay low.  
14. The external position is expected to remain comfortable. As domestic demand 
recovers, the Current Account Deficit (CAD) will widen slightly, to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014. 
FDI is likely to pick up and cover 80 percent of the CAD in 2014, but will remain below the pre-
crisis levels of 5–6 percent of GDP.  Export volumes are expected to rise by 6–7 percent in 
2014–15 as conditions improve in the Eurozone, especially Germany. 
15. Though external debt is high, it is declining having peaked in 2012 at about 75.6 
percent of GDP. It is projected to fall to less than 60 percent in 2018 as economic activity 
rebounds. Short-term external debt is also expected to drop from a peak of 17 percent of GDP in 
2011 to about 11 percent. Romania will need to mobilize about €35–40 billion (about 21-26 
percent of GDP) annually to meet gross external financing requirements (Table A4). 

-4- 

16. Romania’s public debt is among the lowest in the EU and is expected to stabilize over 
the medium term, while public debt excluding temporary financing is forecast to drop further. 
The public-debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to ease to 35.9 percent by 2018. Public debt and debt 
service are well within EU Growth and Stability Pact norms. Gross public financing needs, some 
€16–20 billion a year, are substantial (6-10 percent of GDP) but manageable (Table A5). Further 
debt analysis is presented in Annex 2. 
17. Financial markets have 
taken note of Romania’s strong macroeconomic 
performance.  Romania’s 10-year bond yield is 5.6%, much lower than the 7.25% in 2011. 
Standard & Poor raised the outlook on the sovereign bond rating from “stable” to “positive” on 
November 22, 2013, implying a possible upgrade from the current BB+ by the end of 2014. 

B. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS  

18. 
 Rapidly shifting coalition politics have led to several changes in government in 
recent years. In spite of government and political coalition changes, the economic policies that 
are at the center of the agreements with the IMF/EU and the dialogue with the World Bank are 
viewed as the foundation for domestic policies.  
19. The December 2012 general elections resulted in a new coalition.  The Social-Liberal 
Union (USL), a four-member coalition formed in February 2011 by the Social-Democratic Party 
(PSD), the National Liberal Party (PNL), the Conservative Party (PC) and later joined by the 
National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) secured a 70% parliamentary majority.  
20. The USL coalition broke up in February 2014 when the PNL withdrew its ministers 
from the cabinet and became an opposition party. In just two weeks, a reshuffled government 
secured parliamentary support from a new political alliance that included the Social Democratic 
Union and the Hungarians in Romania Democratic Union (UDMR) and is projected to provide 
continuity in government actions.  
21. European Parliamentary elections at the end of May 2014 are an important signal 
for the upcoming Romanian presidential elections in November 2014.  Obligations stemming 
from the EU membership status of Romania, such as the implementation of the acquis 
communautaire, the European Semester, and the Europe 2020 agenda for smart, sustainable and 
inclusive growth, constitute a solid foundation for Romania’s development planning process, and 
EU policy directions provide a strong anchor for the content and direction of Romanian policy-
making. 
22. Recent tension in the region is being closely monitored in terms of impact on 
economic growth in neighboring countries.  Most of Romania's trade links are with EU 
countries (about two-thirds of exports and over half of imports), although in recent years, as 
growth in the EU slowed, Romania has increased its trade links with countries in Asia.  This 
diversification of trade is projected to mitigate potential significant adverse impacts.

23. There is some uncertainty as to whether some topics that were high on the public 
agenda during the last year will remain a priority.  To date, the constitutional reform and the 
related regionalization and decentralization agenda have received significant political and public 
support. Going forward, it is anticipated that the debate related to exploitation of mineral 
resources (shale gas, gold) will be revived. European integration, absorption of European funds, 
the Europe 2020 strategy, and judicial reform are expected to remain high on the agenda, 
requiring specialized expertise, know-how and institution building.   
24. The challenge and opportunity for the Bank in this context, is to continue to be a 
reliable partner, a knowledge provider and an honest broker to Government in supporting 
the design and implementation of difficult and long standing public sector reforms, 
complemented by flexibility, efficiency and financing support to the budget.  

C. CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVING THE TWIN GOALS 
25. As explained earlier, reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity will come 
from a more sustainable pattern of growth underpinned by job creation in areas such as 
manufacturing, tradable services, and energy products. The Romania Country Economic 
Memorandum outlines such a growth model that is based on the following challenges:  
(i) Boosting economic growth and job creation by improving the business 
environment: through a more flexible business environment, with less direct state 
involvement and better regulation and access to credit;  
(ii) Building the assets of the poor, especially their health and education endowments: 
i.e. to ensure a skilled labor force with lifelong learning to ensure participation by 
aging workers;  
(iii) Addressing social protection and social inclusion; including coping with the 
challenges of an ageing population, with better targeted social assistance programs and 
support to excluded groups including the Roma, that have not been able to participate 
in the labor market and have not benefited from social policies to support 
marginalized, low-income communities; 
(iv) Addressing remaining 
infrastructure challenges: 
i.e. building a modern 
infrastructure for connectivity, e.g. roads and telecom, and supporting greater 
productivity, e.g. irrigation; and  
(v) Strengthening the public administration and service delivery system: to produce a 
well-functioning public sector that is able to design and execute pro-poor growth 
strategies, taking advantage of the availability of significant EU funds. 
26. Romania will have to achieve all these goals whilst also paying attention to gender gaps 
(Annex 3) and ensuring that future growth is green (Annex 4). 

Boosting economic growth and job creation by improving the business environment 
27. Romania’s new growth paradigm should aim to create more efficient markets and a 
more competitive enterprise sector (see Annex 2). Romania carried out a set of important 
reforms to join the EU between 2000-2007 and was rewarded with strong growth, rapid 
convergence, poverty reduction and shared prosperity.  However, domestic consumption and the 
expansion of non-tradable sectors, based on cheap credit, can no longer ensure rising living 
standards.  A sound environment for private sector investment and innovation could encourage a 

-6- 

 
substantial increase in FDI and domestic investment, particularly in export oriented and other 
productive sectors, to take advantage of the common EU market. 
28. 
Improving the business environment would stimulate job creation and growth. 
Streamlining interactions between Government and business and reducing compliance costs is a 
priority for private sector job creation and poverty reduction. Up to EU accession, Romania was 
the second most active reformer according to Doing Business surveys, but the reform momentum 
has slowed in recent years. The OECD ranks Romania 20th out of 22 EU countries, in terms of 
degree to which regulations restrict competition (see Figure A15). Doing Business 2014 ranks 
Romania at 73rd out of 183 countries on ease of doing business and down from 56 in 2011) and 
among the most restrictive in the EU, and below neighboring Bulgaria (58th) and Poland (45nd). 
Getting electricity, obtaining construction permits and paying taxes all remain problematic in 
Romania (see Figure A11). Improving the investment climate for all businesses, enhancing 
competitiveness of key sectors and reducing the cost of compliance (especially tax) will go a 
long way to boosting growth. IBRD, IFC and MIGA will all collaborate on this agenda. 
29. 
  Reducing the role of the state in the economy is also a priority, particularly in 
transport, energy and communications.  As of 2011, there were more than 900 SOEs of which 
645 reported financial statements to the Ministry of Public Finance.  The latter had revenues 
amounting to about 10 percent of GDP and employed 22 percent and 5 percent of the public and 
total labor force respectively.  Their underperformance, low productivity, insufficient capital 
investments, and pricing distortions cause significant damage to the economy and the country. 
SOE arrears have been halved but remain at about 2% of GDP at end-December 2013 and 
account for 96% of all public sector arrears. Their financial fragility has a direct impact on actual 
and contingent state finances, capital markets, the banking sector and the social security system.   
30. 
Improving the regulatory environment for SMEs is also important to unlock 
Romania’s growth potential. SMEs represent an important engine for economic activity in 
Romania. The medium-sized group in particular produces above-average contributions to 
employment (21.1% as compared to 17.2% in the EU) and value added (20.6% as compared to 
18.3% in the EU). However, Romania’s SMEs have lower labor productivity as the regulatory 
burden tends to be heavier for SMEs (Table A6).  Moreover, the Romanian private sector, and 
particularly SMEs, access to financial markets is limited as the sector is perceived to be risker. 
IFC will support strategic investments for small businesses and female-headed enterprises. 
31. 
In order to grow, firms will need greater access to bank finance.  However, banks 
remain saddled with high and rising non-performing loans (NPLs), particularly as a result of 
weaknesses in the corporate and domestic sectors as well as a slow write-down process.  In order 
to ease the cost and time required to exit the market, the authorities are strengthening the bank 
resolution framework. IBRD and IFC are supporting increased access to credit and the ongoing 
efforts to strengthen the bank resolution framework.  
Building the assets of the poor especially their health and education endowments 
32. Compared to the rest of the population, those in the bottom 40 percent have fewer 
assets, employ those assets less intensively, and tend to receive lower returns to those assets. 
Human capital assets are much lower in the bottom 40 percent in Romania than other countries: 
i.e. only two percent have completed tertiary education (Figure 4). They have lower employment 
rates and those who are employed tend to work in low-skilled occupations. A large proportion of 
the bottom 40 percent is self-employed, often underemployed in informal, low-return enterprises. 

-7- 

Those in the bottom 40 percent are also highly vulnerable: only 31 percent report that they are 
able to meet unexpected expenses. 1 Fully engaging these groups in the growth process will 
require coordinated and sustained policies.

33. Romania needs a highly-skilled, innovative workforce to support a competitive 
economy 
based 
on 
increased 
productivity. This 
requires 
an 
education and training system that is 
effective at: (i) 
imparting strong 
cognitive and behavioral foundation 
skills 
(that 
are 
necessary 
for 
successful lifelong learning); and (ii) 
continuously updating technical skills 
in line with technological change and 
economic development. However, 
with high rates of early school leaving 
(Figure 
5) 
and 
poor, 
though 
improving mathematics, reading and 
science competencies of 15 year-olds 
(Figure A16), there is considerable 
scope 
for 
improvement. As 
for 
building technical skills, Romania’s 
gross enrolment ratio for 
tertiary 
education is low (59%) in comparison with other EU countries as is the share of adults aged 25-
64 participating in lifelong learning (1.6%) with no evident gender differences. Special measures 
targeted at the Roma could also close the significant education gap (see later), as only 12% of 
Roma men and 6% of Roma women complete secondary school, the lowest rates in the whole 
region. The early school leaving rate for Roma aged 18-25 is a staggering 95%.  This is not just

an equity issue but also has an impact on macroeconomic growth since the Roma are a young 
and growing population within an aging and shrinking society.  They constitute between 8-15% 
of the labor market entrants a share that will continue to grow during the CPS period.  It is 
estimated that the economic gains from ensuring that they are brought up to the standards of the 
non-Roma population are of the order of 3-4% of GDP.

34. The quality and relevance of tertiary education is also a challenge: although the 
curriculum is based on professional qualifications universities find it difficult to keep up with 
changing market demand, contributing to lags in Romanian innovation and competitiveness. As 
in other sectors administrative capacity remains weak. Total education spending, at 4.2% of 
GDP, is lower than any other country in the EU except Slovakia.  Scandinavian countries spend 
twice as much as a share of GDP. The challenge to meet the twin goals will be to increase 
education spending efficiency, and to improve innovation, quality, equity and relevance. 
35. Romania’s demographics also present a challenge to economic growth and give 
further impetus to the push for a highly skilled workforce.  According to the United Nations, 
Romania’s population is projected to decline by more than 4 million people, or almost 19%, 
between 2010 and 2050. The population is aging and shrinking rapidly not only due to low birth 
rates, but also according to a recent OECD migration report, because 2.7 million young workers 
have emigrated to better-paying jobs in the rest of Europe during the past decade.  Emigration is 
particularly concentrated at the higher end of the skills distribution. Counteracting the aging 
population will require reforms to raise the productivity of current and future labor market 
cohorts and expand domestic employment opportunities. 
36. Stewardship of the Romanian health sector can also be improved.  Romania’s health 
indicators lag well behind EU 15 and EU 27 averages.   Romania has the highest infant mortality 
rate in the EU (9.8 per 1,000 live births, more than twice the EU rate of 4.1per 1,000). Moreover, 
the life expectancy gap between Romania and EU15 since 1970 has almost doubled. This gap is 
associated with the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). For example, the 
country has not yet benefited from the “cardiovascular revolution,” which helped Western 
European countries achieve substantial gains 
in 
life expectancy. Romania’s rate of 
cardiovascular disease is more than twice the EU rate. The challenges that Romania’s health

system must address have also changed as a consequence of the demographic and 
epidemiological transition in the country (i.e. cardiovascular diseases and cancer account for 
three-quarters of all deaths) but the health system has failed to transform itself accordingly. 

37. The health care system can be reoriented towards the needs of the bottom 40 percent 
by increasing the focus on access, particularly to primary and preventative care.  Other 
challenges to the health system include, user dissatisfaction, lack of access to quality care by the 
poor and other vulnerable groups (maternal mortality rates for the Roma are 15 times higher than 
for non-Roma), and weak financial performance. Health service delivery remains biased toward 
inpatient services – there are too many hospitals with too many beds, and hospital infrastructure 
is fragmented. Primary care is underutilized; and there is limited focus on prevention. Health 
financing and resource allocation mechanisms perpetuate a hospital-centric system while weak 
enforcement of regulations generates inefficiencies and reduces transparency. 
Addressing social protection and social inclusion 
38. Romania’s social protection system needs further reforms to cope with an aging 
population as well as more effective targeting to the poor and vulnerable. According to the 
functional review of social protection, almost 84 percent of Romania’s population benefit from at 
least one social protection program indicating that the program is not well targeted to the needy.  
39. Means-tested social assistance programs are well targeted but remain small in size 
compared to regressive categorical benefits (Figure A17). Means-tested programs have seen 
significant budget cuts since 2010, more so than categorical benefits. The Government is now 
engaged in a reform of social assistance with the aim of strengthening the effectiveness of the 
system to expand the coverage of the poor and improve targeting effectiveness, generosity and 
work incentives of means-tested programs. The reforms will introduce a management 
information system (MIS), consolidating multiple benefits, harmonizing eligibility criteria and 
payment functions, and strengthening cooperation between state agencies.  
40. Pension reforms have contributed to poverty reduction, but further reforms are 
needed to meet the challenge of an aging population.  Following the comprehensive pension 

Figure 7: Smarter and more health spending is needed 

 
 
 
42. 

reforms of 2011, the public pension fund deficit stabilized at 3% of GDP over a two year period. 
However, over the longer term, the sustainability of the public pensions system will be 
challenged by the aging population and shrinking labor force. Faster implementation of the 
legislated reforms, i.e. increasing retirement ages and contributions, will result in a more 
effective system that offers adequate protection to the poor and vulnerable. 
41. Reducing poverty in Romania also requires tackling endemic social exclusion and 
empowering marginalized communities. Almost 2 million of Europe’s 10 million Roma live in 
Romania2.  Although the census reports the Roma population at 3.3%, unofficial expert estimates 
reported in the National Roma Integration Strategy, range up to 10% as many Roma do not self-
identify.  According to a recent EC-UNDP-WB 2011 report, the vast majority of the Roma 
population (72%) is in the bottom income quintile, a further 12% in the next quintile.  More than 
90 percent of the Roma are living in severe material deprivation.  The majority of Roma are from 
large households and live in sparsely populated rural areas. Less than 5% have post-secondary 
education.  Close to 75% live without a bathroom or sewer, while half have no piped water.    
Inequalities for the Roma start early with low pre-school enrolment rates.  Romania 
enacted legislation in 2011 that mandates one year of pre-school for all children.  This is 
intended to equalize the level of preparation for primary education (Hungary has gone further in 
passing a law that calls for compulsory pre-school from age 3).  Despite a minister’s order 
1540/2007 calling for the elimination of school segregation and monitoring by the national 
education ministry in years 1, V and IX, many Roma children face poor quality education and 
many classrooms remain segregated, with a quarter of Roma children attending mostly Roma 
classes. Only 12% of Roma men and 6% of Roma women complete secondary school despite the 
expressed wish of their parents (71% for boys and 75% for girls). 
43. Poor educational attainment contributes to poor labor market outcomes.  Less than 
19% of Roma women and 42% of men are employed, many as unskilled laborers (38%). They 
perform mostly temporary, seasonal or occasional work, which points to massive under-
employment. Only 10-15% are salaried employees. The most recent Social Inclusion Barometer 
(2010) indicates that the Roma are ten times more likely to be laid off than the overall population 
and 41% of the Roma in search of a job are not hired because of their ethnicity. For this reason, 
55% of Roma workers don’t have an employment contract and 45% hold only occasional or 
temporary jobs (versus 5% of Romanians). Under these circumstances, 72% of the Roma looking 
for a job are ready to work regardless of the conditions and even without legal formalities, 
meaning that they will not contribute to a pension fund and will not benefit from social security. 
44. Growth alone is not enough to achieve significant poverty reduction in this ethnic 
group as they face discrimination are often excluded from sharing the benefits of growth. 
Discrimination continues to be a hurdle with 26% of Roma households reporting discrimination 
compared to just 3% in the non-Roma population.  This is especially true when they are looking 
for work or housing. Tackling discrimination, intervening with an integrated solution to break 
inter-generational transmission of poverty and following up through the medium term is the only 
way to successfully address the continued social exclusion of low-income populations including 
the Roma. Based on demographic data, between 6 and 20% of new labor market entrants are 
Roma, and this share is expected to increase. A recent Bank report on the economic benefits of 
Roma integration estimates the benefits of productivity increases to bring Roma up to the 
standards of non-Roma employees at about 3-4% of Romania’s GDP.

Addressing remaining infrastructure challenges  
45. Greater investments in infrastructure particularly transport and energy would yield 
higher growth rates. Improving roads, railways, and ports to reduce the cost of transport and 
trade would bolster exports and growth potential. Only 240 km of new motorways have been 
built over the past 20 years and only 200 km of railways have been upgraded for higher-speed 
trains. The result is that road and rail transport is slow, expensive and inefficient. Investments in 
rail are needed and the private sector could contribute to improving the management of the rail 
service.  In addition, road-building needs to accelerate, using available but untapped EU funds. 
46. The energy sector can become a motor for growth by producing energy more reliably 
and efficiently.  Energy reforms are progressing rapidly. Swiftly privatizing all non-strategic 
companies, proceeding with IPOs in strategic companies e.g. Hidroelectrica and Oltenia in the 
energy sector, and improving the governance framework for SOEs is key. Equally important is 
the implementation of the Gas and Electricity Road Maps which would bring Romania closer to 
participating in a common EU energy market. Implementing the reform agenda would increase 
energy security and transform Romania into an important player in the regional energy market.

47. Given its geographical location and endowments in terms of land, water and 
affordable labor force, Romania could have comparative advantage in the agriculture and 
the food processing sector.  Once a breadbasket for Eastern Europe, the country now imports 70 
percent of its food.  Agriculture accounts for only 5 percent of GDP but affects a large proportion 
of the population since 45% of the total lives in rural areas, one of the highest percentages within 
the EU, and generates 28 percent of total employment, compared to only 3 percent in the EU153.  
Structural weaknesses have prevented capital investments and the adoption of modern techniques 
necessary to boost productivity and improve competitiveness thus keeping the sector well below 
its export potential.  Romania has the lowest farm labor productivity in the EU.  Romania can 
make use of EU agricultural policy tools to address bottlenecks in land titling, knowledge 
transfers and irrigation.    
Strengthening public administration and service delivery 
48. A well-functioning public administration 
is key 
to policy formulation and 
implementation and service delivery and is a sine qua non for achieving the twin goals in 
Romania.  A relatively weak public administration has resulted in continued inefficiencies and 
poor quality public investment, and shortcomings in the programming and utilization of EU 
funds (see below), as well as poor oversight of state-owned enterprises that remain dominant in 
the energy and transport sectors and weak service delivery in the health and education sector. 
49. Romania’s public administration remains below EU standards.  The European 
Council recommendation on Romania’s national reform program of 2013 stated that, “The public 
administration is characterized by an inconsistent legal framework, frequent recourse to 
emergency ordinances, low levels of inter-ministerial cooperation and excessive bureaucracy. It 
is also undermined by a lack of skills, a lack of transparency in staff recruitment and high 
management turnover rates.” A recent summary 4 of Romania’s governance and public 
administration challenges notes that Romania is below the ECA average in many key areas of 
governance including voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and political stability among 
others. Government effectiveness is particularly 
low.  This indicator captures perceptions of the 
quality of public services, civil service, policy 
formulation and implementation and credibility 
of the government’s commitment to policies. 
Other 
areas 
highlighted 
for 
continued 
improvement 
include corruption 
indicators, 
particularly regarding petty corruption and 
bribes; government effectiveness, and easing 
business constraints. Other efforts are needed to 
strengthen 
institutions 
and 
accountability 
(particularly in the judiciary). 
50. Effectively utilizing EU funds and 
increasing the efficiency of public investment 
can also secure employment in many sectors.  
EU resources represent a significant amount of

national resources available for productive investment in infrastructure, networks and innovation 
which, if well managed can strengthen both local and national businesses while improving the 
business environment in both agriculture and the productive sectors (see Box 1).  

Box 1: Improved strategic planning of and efficiency in the use of EU Funds 

Romania was allocated €20 billion in EU cohesion funds over 2007-2013 and is expected to receive €22.9 
billion over 2014-2020 (with 20 percent of the spending mandated to climate change actions).  However, 
Romania’s absorption rate, as of end 2013, for social and cohesion funds (the rate at which EU resources 
are used) at less than 35% is the lowest in the EU. About the same amount of funds was made available 
for rural development and agricultural funds. The rate of absorption for such funds has improved 
markedly up to 67 percent at end 2013 from just 20 percent at end-2012.  Romania also experienced the 
highest rate of financial corrections until 2013 (when EU rules are not followed the money has to be 
returned) at almost 20%.  While further major improvements in absorption are expected until the end of 
2015, it is difficult to imagine that all available funds can be absorbed. This leaves precious grant 
resources on the table and misses an opportunity to create fiscal space and support economic growth.   
The Bank is supporting efforts to address this through improved systems, supervision and better planning. 
The Romanian authorities are conscious of the need to improve programing and effective implementation 
of EU resources and have secured the Bank’s assistance in this area to bring in best practices from other 
member states.  The Bank also supports efforts to improve impact, monitoring and evaluation. Social 
inclusion of the most vulnerable groups particularly the Roma, would most benefit of the improved EU 
funds absorption and impact, responding thus to some key priorities of the EC in the area.   
IFC will continue to structure projects with an emphasis on supporting Romania to utilize EU funds, 
building on its co-financed projects with the EU at the sub-national level. As an example, IFC finance 
will focus on improving the district heating for Romanian municipalities. The projects will improve the 
quality of life and will have significant impact on climate change. This goal is supported through RAS 
engagements, in particular to produce various strategies that are required by the EC before they release 
funds for the forthcoming Operational Programs (ex-ante conditionalities). Additional RAS engagements 
that will support this goal include the Public Investment Management, harmonizing state and EU funded 
projects for the benefit of sub-national governments, the Project Selection Models RAS and the Delivery 
Unit RAS.  The proposed first DPL series will also support a number of key legislative and institutional 
changes to improve the overall system.  

Gender gaps5 
51. Gender gaps in economic opportunities, human capital, and voice and agency exist 
and are magnified for excluded groups. Romania ranks in the middle of countries assessed for 
gender equality in the Global Gender Gap Index by the World Economic Forum and the Gender 
Empowerment Measure by the UNDP. There are few indications of a gender gap in endowments, 
while gender gaps in access to economic opportunities and voice and agency persist. These 
gender gaps constrain inclusive growth, and hence poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
52. Economic opportunities: Gender differences exist not just in employment, wages, and 
entrepreneurship, but also in pensions. Female and male labor force participation rates are 57 
percent and 72 percent, respectively, leaving a gender gap of 15 percentage points, which is 
larger than that in the EU. The gender pay gap is estimated to be 9.7 percent (in 2012) which 

5 In compliance with OP/BP 4.20, the CPS is informed by an assessment of the gender situation based on existing data World 
Bank’s Gender at a Glance for Romania and GenderStats, which identified the main areas of concern for gender equality. These 
were covered by the European Commission (2013) report “The current situation of gender equality in Romania- Country Profile” 
which was deemed by the World Bank team as satisfactory, and complemented with a report with a specific focus on pensions.

reflects occupational segregation and discrimination. Romania has set a goal of achieving 70 
percent employment rate which would be difficult to reach without increasing women’s 
employment. These rates mask an even greater inequality: only 19 percent of Roma women and 
42 percent of Roma men are employed. Less than a third of business owners in Romania are 
women. Gender differences in the labor market can accumulate over time and result in gender 
gaps in pensions receipts (regardless of how equitable the pensions system is). The average 
gender gap in pensions payments is estimated at 12 percent (16 percent in the EU).  
53. Endowments of education and health: Gender gaps in education exist mainly at the 
tertiary level, in choice of subjects studied and among the Roma; health indicators reveal that 
maternal mortality is a concern especially among Roma women. There are no major gender gaps 
in primary and secondary gross enrollment rates, primary completion and adult literacy rates. 
However, over 20 percent of the Roma are illiterate and Roma women have on average 5 years 
of schooling, half that of non-Roma women. Among the entire population, the female tertiary 
enrollment rate outpaces that of males, at 68 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Similarly to 
other countries in the region, gender disparities exist in educational specialization. Women 
constitute 90 percent of students specializing in education and over 70 percent of students 
studying health, humanities, and art. Female life expectancy in Romania exceeds men’s by 7 
years. Although the adult mortality rate is higher for men than for women, maternal mortality is 
still a concern and is estimated at 27 per 100,000 live births, three times the EU average. 
Maternal mortality for Roma women is fifteen times that for non-Roma women. 
54. Voice and agency: Women have limited presence in public decision making and are more 
likely than men to experience domestic violence. Only 12 percent of seats in the national 
parliament are held by women, and only 17 percent of ministers are women. Additionally, in a 
UNDP/WB/EC survey for Romania, 28 percent of Roma women felt they had been 
discriminated against because of ethnicity, and 11 percent felt they had been on account of 
gender. Domestic violence is another manifestation of women’s lack of voice and agency. The 
2013 EU Violence against women survey reveals that 30 percent of women in Romania have 
experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15.  

III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY  
A. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY 
55. The government has produced a comprehensive 2013 National Reform Program 
(NRP), a Convergence Program (CP) for 2013–16, and an associated Government Program 
(GP) of actions. The objectives are to: (i) modernize public administration, (ii) increase the 
absorption of structural and cohesion funds, and (iii) improve the business environment. The GP 
details the government’s macroeconomic strategy and commitment to targets under the growth 
and stability pact of a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2015. In October 2013, the 
European Council of Ministers confirmed the GP as realistic but emphasized the risks of the lack 
of budget financing for priority public sector projects and limited progress on SOE restructuring. 
56. The Government Program details achievements and reform plans in eight areas: (i) 
enhancing social justice; (ii) managing public resources efficiently; (iii) curbing tax evasion; (iv) 
improving the business environment; (v) improving management of public debt; (vi) enhancing 
investor confidence; (vii) strengthening internal and external buffers for macroeconomic 
stability; and (viii) accelerating the pace of structural reforms. 

-15- 

57. The Government Program covers economic, social, and political reforms, with 
special attention to making more efficient use of public resources and improving the 
functioning of markets. It also stresses the importance of setting measurable results indicators 
consistent with budget allocations; helping those Romanians most affected by the crisis; 
accelerating structural reforms in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and energy and capital 
markets; and putting in place sound cadaster and land registration systems. 
58. Romania’s medium term development strategy is framed within the broader context 
of the EU’s “Europe 2020” strategy, which is designed around the concept of “sustainable, 
smart and inclusive growth”. Europe 2020 proposes a set of specific targets for the EU as a 
whole and for each member country (Box A2).  
59. The Romanian government also completed its draft Partnership Agreement (PA), 
framing the use of European funds under the 2014-20 EU financing perspectives.  The draft 
partnership agreement identifies the following priorities for Romania: (i) competitiveness; (ii) 
people and society; (iii) infrastructure; (iv) resources; and (v) administration and government. 
For each of these areas, one or more thematic objectives was defined after providing an analysis 
of the current situation and highlighting development needs to be addressed, expected results and 
proposed actions.  The PA includes indicative allocations of EU structural and cohesion funds as 
follows: (i) infrastructure (including transport, energy and environment) (Euro 9.5 billion); (ii) 
regional development (Euro 6.7 billion); (iii) human capital (Euro 4.2 billion); and (iv) private 
sector and competitiveness (Euro 1.2 billion).  The remainder goes to administration and TA.

Annex 10) focus on the following priority areas: (i) fiscal consolidation; (ii) health sector reform; 
(iii) employment, youth and labor market; (iv) education and training; (v) public sector 
management; (vi) business environment; (vii) network industries; and (viii) completing the 
EU/IMF financial program. 
61. Romania as a part II member of IDA.  Romania has become the 173rd member of IDA 
in April 2014. Payment of the initial subscription (US$4.09 million) was made in December 
2013. An additional optional subscription of US$1.36 million, corresponding to subscriptions to 
IDA 3 to IDA 16 will be paid. 
B. LESSONS LEARNED FROM FY09-13 
62. The 2009-2013 CPS was devised to help mitigate the negative effects of the global 
economic and financial crises on Romania.  The country faced a challenge to protect the gains 
of almost a decade of rapid growth and poverty reduction.  The authorities wanted to focus their 
efforts on improved economic management and the large unfinished agenda of public sector and 
governance reforms. The previous CPS period witnessed great progress in economic 
management but restoring the sources of sustainable and equitable growth proved more difficult.  
The CPS Completion Report (see Annex 4) assesses progress made towards the program 
outcomes and draws the following lessons and recommendations which were taken on board in 
preparing the new CPS including: 

 

 

 

Lesson 1: Aligning the program to the EU strategy. Throughout the CPS period, 
Romania had access to large amounts of EU grants and European Investment Bank (EIB) 
loans. In the next programing period, 2014-2020, Romania will be allocated funds worth 
€22 billion from structural and cohesion funds plus a further €18 billion in agriculture and 
rural development funds to support convergence and meet EU accession treaty obligations, 
making it especially important for Bank financing to be focused on instruments and areas 
not covered by EU grant resources, or where Bank interventions can improve the efficiency 
of spending or strengthen capacity to sustainably manage EU funded investment.  Bank TA 
should also continue to support the EU agenda, including improving Romania’s ability to 
use EU Funds. The new CPS FY14-17 is therefore closely aligned to such priorities and 
fully consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy (see Box A2). 
Lesson 2: The Bank is a trusted partner of Romania (as well as the EC and IMF). The 
Bank, in close coordination with the IMF and EC, has been able to support Romania in 
weathering the financial crisis and has strengthened its role of strategic adviser. It is clear 
that the Bank has a role to play in a new EU member country like Romania in building 
administrative capacity to address institutional and social issues necessary to achieve EU 
living and other standards. The Government and the EC and IMF have all welcomed and at 
times insisted on the Bank Group’s involvement in Romania given the Bank’s deep sectoral 
knowledge and reform experience.    
Lesson 3: Multi-tranche DPLs allowed the Bank to support macro stabilization with 
the IMF and EC while pursuing much needed structural reforms. The DPL program 
supported government reforms in fiscal and public administration management, social 
protection, and the financial sector. The DPL-DDO, approved during the crisis, helped 
consolidate progress towards macroeconomic stabilization, increased competitiveness of 
the energy sector and fiscal sustainability of the health care system.  It also supported and 

-17- 

 

 

 

facilitated access to markets. A series of large DPLs focused on key structural reform 
issues will anchor the lending program under the current CPS. 
Lesson 4: The RAS instrument proved especially effective in strengthening the Bank’s 
partnership with Romania.  RAS requests confirmed that the Bank’s knowledge services 
are highly valued. Demand-driven technical assistance supplied through the RAS program 
enhanced our role as reform advocate, neutral stakeholder and trusted adviser to the 
Government. The Functional Reviews provided a solid analysis of administrative capacity 
in various public institutions and practical recommendations to improve their performance 
which have been translated into Government action plans currently under implementation. 
The quality of the RAS work also strengthened collaboration with the European 
Commission and IFIs.  The Bank’s ability to mobilize global and local teams and to provide 
independent technical advice were highly sought and the RAS program allowed the Bank 
to go far beyond what could have been done relying solely on our own resources. 
Lesson 5: Selectivity in investment project finance (IPF).  During the previous CPS 
period several projects faced insufficient budgetary allocations during implementation.  
This was partly due to a change of priorities due to the financial crisis. The portfolio has 
been restructured and is now much leaner and retains projects that can be supported within 
the existing constrained fiscal environment. The CPS will be highly selective with just one 
or two IPFs per year focused on key areas that will be mutually agreed with the authorities. 
Lesson 6: Strengthening M&E. A strengthened M&E framework at government level and 
the culture of progressive assessment and reporting of results are still lacking and thus 
capacity building in this area is key. For example, the M&E issue is critical to GHG 
emissions monitoring and reporting as required by EU and UNFCCC and will help monitor 
the achievements of some of the thematic objectives under the EC partnership agreement. 

C. PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP CPS FOR ROMANIA 
I. 
STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 
Our strategic areas of engagement 
63. The overall objective of this CPS is to reduce poverty in Romania and foster 
sustainable income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population.   The later will be 
achieved within the context of Romania’s economic convergence process with the EU and the 
EU2020, “smart sustainable and inclusive” agenda. 
64. To achieve the twin goals, Romania needs to move to a sustainable growth model.  
The Bank Group will focus efforts on increasing the growth rate with interventions in the 
business environment, financial sector and skills development. 
65. Social protection and the inclusion of low-income communities, especially the Roma 
is a priority.  The WBG has expertise in the design of social protection systems and also in 
designing and implementing social inclusion projects.  Interventions in the latter area will build 
on lessons learned from the current SIP project. 
66. Romania faces an unfinished agenda in establishing the key institutions for economic 
and social development.  This area of interventions addresses the need to continue with this 
important public agenda started when Romania first started accession negotiations. The WBG 
will focus its interventions on public sector strengthening and health sector reform.     

-18- 

 
67. 
It is envisaged that the WBG will adopt a selective approach in Romania will use the 
full range of WBG instruments including financing, analytical and advisory services and 
RAS.  This section explains what each part of the WBG will provide in support of the broad 
objectives outlined above.  The following section explains how they come together to bring 
combined resources on each of the thematic topics. 

 IBRD lending resources.  In the first two years, IBRD will provide funding of the order 
of Euro 1 billion. Lending volumes and instruments in the outer years will depend on the 
country’s performance and priorities, IBRD lending capacity, demand from other borrowing 
countries and global economic developments. The bulk of the funds will be earmarked for 
budget support.  The first DPL series will start with a focus on fiscal effectiveness and 
growth. A second series of two operations in the later years will focus on the remaining 
structural reform program. During the CPS period, it is envisaged that about 30% of the 
funds made available to the country will be used for investment projects (IPF) in either one 
large operation (for example in FY14) or two smaller operations for each year (for example 
in FY15). Investment project financing in the first two years of the CPS will focus on health, 
education and social inclusion.  The authorities have requested that the IPFs for the outer 
years remain tentative. These could include judicial reforms, private sector and/or an energy 
related project (in line with Climate Change requirements and commitments), or could target 
growth enabling infrastructure investments in complementarity with EU and other IFI 
programs. In general, all IPFs would include components to leverage EU funds and/or 
increase the efficiency of public sector expenditures.  

 IFC will focus on the growth and job creation agenda.  IFC will support sustainable 
growth and enhance economic competitiveness through selective financing of private sector 
projects. IFC’s program during FY14-17 is expected to be in the range of US$150 million to 
US$250 million annually.  IFC’s strategy is to support the private sector with projects that 
can achieve significant impact in areas not covered by other IFIs. Strategic sectors include: 
financial markets, agriculture and infrastructure. Within financial markets, IFC will continue 
post-crisis support, with an emphasis on re-building the alternative financing in local 
currency of the capital markets jointly with the Bank.  IFC will continue ongoing work with 
financial intermediaries to support the SME market segment, provide loans to under-served 
populations and provide co-financing with EU programs where appropriate. IFC will also 
help develop Romania’s competitive advantages through select investments in primary 
production, food and beverage processing, and retail. IFC will also address bottlenecks to 
growth in areas that IBRD is not playing a role in, such as infrastructure, including through 
PPPs with an emphasis on climate change, innovation and new technologies especially for 
exporters. 

 MIGA is striving to re-engage in Romania.  MIGA has not been active in Romania 
since 2004. The Romanian authorities have recently expressed keen interest in MIGA's credit 
enhancement products. MIGA has identified relevant State-Owned Enterprises in the 
country's energy sector with a view to potentially providing guarantees for state-owned 
utilities to modernize and expand local and regional interconnection networks. The financing 
needs for the sector are estimated in the order of Euro 30 billion (US$41 billion) for a period 
of 10-15 years, and thus MIGA can only be a part of any financing solution. MIGA's credit 
enhancement would aim to significantly improve borrowing terms, either on international 
capital markets or through cross-border loans.

Note: Lending volumes will depend on the country’s performance and priorities, IBRD lending capacity, demand from other 
borrowers and global economic developments. The size and type of lending program for the outer years of the CPS will be 
determined jointly with the government. This will be also reflected in the CPS Progress Report. The DPLs will support the 
authority’s reform agendas dependent on the prevailing macroeconomic context.

Prudent stewardship of our RAS portfolio 
68. During the CPS period most analytical and advisory services will be supplied through 
demand-led RAS engagements. While it is not possible to foresee the areas or accurately 
estimate the size of future the RAS engagement we have presented a summary of our RAS work 
to date (Annex 7). The Bank’s own resources for analytical work will be focused on public 
goods, studies to improve our own knowledge of the country’s development challenges, areas 
where we wish take an independent view (e.g. mining), and areas that are critical for the twin 
goals that are not being undertaken by government or other IFIs. 
69. The RAS portfolio has grown rapidly to 24 ongoing engagements worth a total of 
US$42 million this equates to approximately US$20 million per year as many of the larger RAS 
engagements are multi-year.  RAS engagements allow the WBG to deepen our engagement in 
key areas that would be impossible to finance through internal resources. This growth is 
expected to taper especially at the start of new EU Programming Period 2014-20.  The Romanian 
authorities have signaled that they cannot accurately assess future demand for RAS. 
70. RAS has strengthened the Bank’s engagement with Romania. RAS enhanced our role 
as reform advocate, neutral stakeholder and trusted adviser to the Government.  Satisfaction with 
the quality of the Bank’s work under RAS also strengthened close collaboration with the 
European Commission and the IMF. Several RAS engagements have supported the development 
of strategies that are ex-ante conditionalities for accessing EU resources. The Bank will thus 
contribute to medium-term development issues as well as help unlock EU resources and inform 
their use. As demand for RAS grew in volume and complexity, it deepened our policy dialogue 
and engaged us in sensitive reform areas essential for attainment of the Bank Group’s goals of 
eliminating poverty and boosting shared prosperity such as public investment management, 

-20- 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Roma inclusion, regional development, climate change, competitiveness, land registration, 
agriculture, transport efficiency, tertiary education and early school leaving.   

71. Capacity building is an important element of our knowledge program.  Institutional 
capacity building is a daunting and lengthy process requiring long term political commitment.  
Engaging the Bank through RAS also encourages Government to focus on long term issues, 
sustain reforms and mitigate the backsliding to improve the functions of state. Our policy 
dialogue and knowledge activities foster a change of views and a focus on results and 
modernization of management practices in the public administration.   

72. Positive Synergy of RAS with lending and other Bank Group instruments.  RAS are 
often at the core of the Bank’s program, providing analytical underpinnings for the ongoing DPL 
DDO and the new DPL series.  RAS engagements also generate knowledge that is valuable for 
the Bank for cross-fertilization, including with lower-income countries e.g. Eastern Partnership 
and pre-accession countries as well as other important MICs such as Brazil and China. RAS 
plays to the strength of the World Bank Group as a global knowledge institution and is crucial to 
the WBG’s continued transformation into an institution that generates and brokers knowledge. 

Measuring the results of the proposed CPS 
73. Annex 1 provides the results framework which will be used to monitor and evaluate 
progress in the implementation of the CPS.  Some of the outcome indicators will be supported by 
existing investment projects and others will be supported by the Bank’s knowledge program 
including both bank-financed and RAS activities.  In cases where the WBG’s engagement 
consists only of analytical and advisory services the results can often be no more than 
intermediate outcomes in a longer results chain.  
The CPS followed a broad consultative process and is based on high quality diagnostic work 
74. The proposed CPS program is the result of a prolonged period of consultation with a 
wide variety of stakeholders.  The joint Bank / IFC team had discussions with stakeholders in 
government, the private sector, academia, think tanks and other interested parties.  The team also 
traveled to various regional locations within Romania. And the CPS is informed by the recently 
concluded country survey and knowledge mapping exercises, (see Annex 10 for more details). 
75. The CPS is based on a large amount of high quality diagnostic work.  The CPS has 
drawn on analytical work produced by the WBG, Government of Romania, EU, IMF, EIB, 
EBRD and other stakeholders.  A list of the reference sources is included in Annexes 7 and 12. 
76. The WBG values stakeholders’ opinions regarding the priority areas for reform and where 
the Bank’s assistance could bring added value. Two exercises gathered stakeholder feedback: 
(i) Country Survey which focused on the evaluation of the WBG’s activities during the 
previous CPS period (2009-2013), but also touched on Romania’s priorities and areas where 
the Bank should continue its support; and  
(ii) Knowledge Mapping exercise which examined the perceived vision for Romania, 
referring both to needs and priorities. The findings of these two projects are complementary.  
77. The analysis acts as a dashboard to support WBG’s operations in Romania in the 
following four years. The respondents emphasized the areas where the Bank should support 

-21- 

 
 
 
Romania’s reforms agenda, among which Education, Health and Governance were the most 
frequently mentioned all are areas included in the indicative program for the 2014-2017 period.  
II. 
THE CPS PILLARS: IMPROVING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, 
SUPPORTING GROWTH AND INCLUSION 
78. The strategy proposed for the Bank Group’s operations in Romania will focus on the three 
pillars below. Attention to gender equality will cut across these pillars, aligning with the National 
Strategy for Gender Equality (2014-2017) whose main areas of interventions include gender 
equality in the labor force and an integrated approach for gender equality among others. 
(i) Creating a 21st century government: A well-functioning public administration that 
utilizes effectively all fiscal resources (including EU funds) is a pre-requisite for improved 
service delivery.  The Bank is already working in this area including: the DPL-DOO which 
supports improved PFM, tax laws, and SOE performance, the Judicial Reform project and the 
Revenue Administration Modernization Project (RAMP). A number of RAS engagements 
have also provided a strong analytical base including the functional reviews and the public 
investment framework review. In the past year, RAS activities have been focusing on public 
administration reform and strengthening capacity. The Bank has also recently signed a RAS 
to support the establishment of a Delivery Unit at the center of government that will focus on 
introducing a culture of performance frameworks, tracking mechanisms and a results 
orientation starting with the priority areas of; job creation, energy, tax administration and 
public procurement.  IFC’s involvement in large PPPs structuring ensures transfer of best 
practice and capacity building at local administration levels.  
(ii)  Growth and job creation: The only sustainable way out of poverty is through private 
sector employment. As explained above, Romania needs to adopt a sustainable growth model 
creating productive jobs as well as expanding employment especially among women. This 
pillar will support growth and private sector job creation by focusing on: (i) education and 
skills, (ii) reducing the role of the state and improving the business environment.  IBRD will 
finance an education sector IPF whose details will be determined jointly with government. 
IBRD and IFC are expected to collaborate on improving the business environment through 
TA and support of the proposed DPLs.  IBRD and IFC will also collaborate on financing for 
enterprises and development of the capital markets. IBRD will continue to work on improved 
SOE governance while IFC will re-engage in privatization of SOEs, especially in the energy 
sector, while MIGA is also considering proposed support to strategic energy sector SOEs.  
(iii)  Social inclusion is an important part of the EU’s Europe 2020 agenda and is the heart of 
the Bank’s shared prosperity goal and also a vital ingredient for sustainable development. 
The authorities will focus on improving the quality of public sector interventions in health, 
education and social protection. Labor market interventions, formalization of civil documents 
and property rights as well as combatting discrimination will all play a role in addressing 
living standards of marginal communities. Enhancing equality of opportunity will be 
important as well as improving the effectiveness of safety nets and providing access to basic 
services. This pillar will build on previous interventions such as: Social Inclusion Project, 
Social Assistance Modernization Project, and the RAS reports on Roma, and Early School 
Leaving as well as the poverty maps. Targeting of gender analysis, actions and monitoring 
can improve social inclusion, contributing to shared prosperity and sustainable development: 
for example the Social Inclusion Project targets social assistance projects for victims of 
domestic violence, and the Social Assistance System Modernization Project gender 

-22- 

disaggregates beneficiaries reached by government programs. Addressing Social Inclusion 
was a requirement in structuring health PPPs and in co-financing with EU projects in the sub-
national sector. IFC will continue to focus on addressing these issues in the years ahead. 
III. 
PLANNED ACTIVITIES IN CPS AREAS OF ENGAGEMENT 
Pillar 1: Creating a 21st Century Government 
79. 
Improving public sector management for efficient and effective service delivery is at the 
heart of achieving the twin goals and an area where the Bank has a strong comparative 
advantage.  The Bank has been actively engaged in this area, through successive DPL series, a 
recently approved project, analytical work, and technical assistance, in close cooperation with 
the EC and the IMF. This support will continue under this CPS. 
80. Country Development Goal 1: Improving Public Administration.  Romania has gone 
through an impressive fiscal consolidation effort.  This component will build on recent efforts 
with two key initiatives:  
a. Improving the quality of public expenditures. 
b. Strengthening Center of Government functions. 
81. 
Improving the quality of public expenditures:  This component will support (i) 
strengthening public investment management and (ii) introducing results-informed budgeting.  
Bank interventions could span both central and local governments, SOE governance and 
investment policy. Consolidation of the management controls system of EU and State 
operational programs would also help to increase the efficiency and transparency of EU funds 
absorption and of domestic investment and reduce the high level of financial corrections of the 
previous period. 
82. Strengthening of Center of Government functions. Strengthening the center of the 
Government has been identified as one of the immediate essential tasks to overcome public 
sector delivery challenges. Specific issues include government-wide policy prioritization 
improved coordination across the government and strengthened policy implementation. The 
Bank will support the establishment of a central Delivery Unit to help focus political attention on 
a limited set of priority objectives, initially including; energy, public procurement, job creation 
and tax administration and to routinely track performance against results.  
83. Line of sight to the twin goals:  Improving the quality of public expenditure will allow 
services public services to be delivered in an efficient and cost-effective manner, allowing 
expenditures to be better targeted to the bottom forty percent in a manner that is fiscally 
sustainable over the medium term. 
84. Country Development Goal 2:  Improved Health Sector Delivery.  As noted above, 
health outcomes in Romania lag behind EU standards. The delivery system needs to be upgraded 
to meet the needs of an aging population, take advantage of new health technologies and 
incorporate marginalized communities.  Since 2009, the Bank has partnered with the EC and the 
IMF on the structural reform of the health care system.  The reform program seeks to increase 
the emphasis on primary care and prevention, reduce unnecessary inpatient admission services, 
and develop sustainable access to higher-quality secondary ambulatory services. These reforms 
would lead to an increase in the quality of care and efficiency of system administration, and 
improved health outcomes. The proposed health sector reform investment project will focus on: 

-23- 

(i) streamlining hospital services; (ii) enhancing primary health care services; (iii) implementing 
specialized secondary ambulatory care; and (iv) improving sector governance and stewardship. 
85. 
IFC will invest selectively, focusing on opportunities to support projects outside 
Bucharest, complementing the proposed IBRD IPF within the sector.   
86. Line of sight to the twin goals:  Health care interventions will enhance the effectiveness, 
management and modernization of the hospital network, which in turn will contribute to 
developing a more effective health system which can delivery improved primary care, rationalize 
the cost of services, improve access and accountability as well as coping with the needs of an 
aging society.  This in turn will result in improvements in health outcomes for the bottom forty 
percent and increased opportunities to participate in the labor market for the elderly and 
vulnerable which will promote income growth for the bottom forty percent.  
87. Pillar 1 Instruments: Investment Project Lending (RAMP ongoing), Proposed DPLs, 
Investment Project Lending (Proposed Health Sector Reform Project FY14), IDF grant to 
strengthen M&E systems, IFC investments in the sector  and economic and sector work much of 
which will be delivered through RAS.    
Pillar 2:  Growth and Job Creation 
88. Ensuring robust economic growth is the key to convergence, poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity goals. The challenge in this area is how to increase the rate of growth from 2 percent 
(an early estimate for 2014) to 4 to 6 percent which would be required for quicker poverty 
reduction and sustained income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population.  This will be 
especially difficult in the context of an aging and shrinking population.  The solution is increased 
competition and competitiveness. Action will be required on several fronts but the WBG will 
focus selectively on just three areas; (i) enhancing the business environment; (ii) inclusive and 
efficient labor market outcomes; and (iii) improving access to finance. 
89. Although infrastructure is an important element of the growth agenda IBRD lending to the 
sector is not foreseen in the early years of the CPS due to the availability of EU resources for the 
public sector. However, WBG will continue to support Romania’s efforts to build a secure, 
sustainable, and efficient energy sector through selected IFC investments and advisory services 
(e.g. district heating and market-based approaches to energy efficiency). IFC has focused on 
improving competitiveness in Romania through innovation and transfer of new technologies.  In 
infrastructure, IFC will continue to address bottlenecks to growth and improve access to markets 
through investments in energy, transport, and logistics.  IFC will also seek to invest in sub-
national infrastructure, including through PPPs, with a particular emphasis on climate change 
and will support efforts to increase EU funds utilization through PPPs. 
90. Country Development Goal 3: Enhanced businesses environment.  Fostering faster 
growth and job creation will require a new growth paradigm based on efficient markets and a 
competitive enterprise sector. Three things are key in this initiative: (i) streamlining business 
regulation; (ii) improving the regulatory environment for SMEs; and (iii) enhancing competition 
and harmonizing the institutional framework for competition with EU principles. (See Annex 2). 
91. A number of WBG teams are working in this area on issues such as land registration, 
competition policy, revenue administration, construction permits, doing business indicators etc.  
Each team will report on its own area of expertise and these outcome reviews will be captured in 
the mid-term progress report and the final CPS ICR.  Two indicators have been selected to 

-24- 

measure progress on this broad objective as they are believed to be fundamental to making 
progress on enhancing the business environment.  The indicators are streamlining the payment of 
taxes and reducing the time required for a construction permit.  These indicators are supported by 
the Revenue Administration Modernization Project and the DPL series respectively. 
92. Line of sight to the twin goals:  An enhanced business environment will facilitate 
investments and create new jobs.  Since the bottom 40 percent have lower labor market 
participation and lower return on their labor they will benefit from increased labor demand. 
93. Country Development Goal 4: Inclusive and efficient labor markets. Increased 
participation in the labor market is key for sustained economic growth as well as for social 
inclusion and poverty reduction particularly for youth and the Roma population.  The 
government is making efforts to improve the functioning of the labor market, including 
strengthening Public Employment Services and reviewing and strengthening activation policies 
(with support from the European Social Fund).  A portrait of labor market exclusion in Romania 
supported by DG Employment highlighted the various groupings of unemployment in Romania 
(see Table A7). 
94. 
In addition to activation policies, Romania needs to improve its education and skills 
outcomes as noted above. It will be important to reduce early school leaving among worst off 
groups, with particular focus on rural areas and the Roma population and strengthen the 
cognitive and behavioral foundation skills of graduates through higher quality in general 
education, improve the relevance and quality of tertiary education and establish a system for 
lifelong learning and upgrading of technical skills.  The Bank has engaged with the Romanian 
authorities on a RAS basis on many of these issues.  It is envisaged that this agenda will be taken 
up in FY15 through an education and skills IPF. 
95. Line of sight to the twin goals:  Reducing early school leaving and increasing the skills of 
the members of marginalized communities especially the Roma and facilitating increased labor 
market inclusion will support poverty reduction in Romania. 
96. Country Goal 5:  Improving access to finance.  Increased economic growth will require 
greater access to finance for the private sector.  However, the Romanian banking sector has been 
contracting as the deleveraging process following the financial crisis continues. In the short term 
the authorities are trying to facilitate NPL resolution by speeding up the bankruptcy process.  
Over the medium term, the authorities are examining ways to grow and deepen the financial 
sector.  Three particular areas are under consideration: (i) strengthening the existing risk sharing 
facility to unlock bank lending in the short term; (ii) developing non-bank financial institutions; 
and (iii) deepening of the capital market with focus on a new economic growth model, so that it 
plays a more important role in mobilizing domestic resources and to foster tradables.  The 
development of the securities market includes, among others, the non-government fixed income 
market (with long maturities), asset backed securities, and collective investment schemes, and at 
the same time establishes a framework (and capacity) to supervise and enforce market integrity 
in all these areas and address macro prudential supervision.  A joint IBRD/IFC capital markets 
assessment project will help identify the improvements needed for a more effective primary and 
secondary market. The proposed DPL series could support capital market development and 
strengthening financial sector stability while IFC may participate in IPOs and local currency 
bonds as an investor. IFC can also play a role in the development of NBFIs which provide 
market-based safety-nets to support growth and job creation.  This will follow on the success of 
projects with similar entities in micro-finance and farmer financing. IFC will continue to work 

-25- 

with financial intermediaries to provide financing to farmers and small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) in the sector, groups that have been largely neglected by commercial banks. IFC will 
help develop the country’s competitive edge through selective investments in food and beverage 
production, processing, and retail.  
97. 
Increasing access to finance will also require high-quality financial statements, which 
imply improving external audit quality through better monitoring and enforcement systems.  The 
authorities are following the 2008 ROSC Accounting and Auditing which recommended 
strengthening monitoring and enforcing quality external audits by establishing a public oversight 
system and strengthening audit quality reviews by the Chamber of Financial Auditors. 
98. Line of sight to the twin goals:  Improving access to finance generally will allow 
successful entrepreneurs to create employment opportunities benefiting the bottom 40 percent.  
Improving access to microfinance and farmer financing in particular will address the needs of 
vulnerable and rural communities that have otherwise limited access to financial services.  
Allowing such groups to save, invest and borrow to expand their businesses will result in income 
growth for the bottom forty percent. 
99. 
IFC can play a role in helping banks reduce their NPLs.  IFC has established a global 
network of investment platforms with distressed assets players to: (i) build the required capacity 
to actively operate in the sector; (ii) align interests with selected partners.  IFC distressed assets 
investments are helping banks convert non-productive assets into productive resources, so that 
banks extend new credit to support the growth of these economies.  IFC will continue to play a 
role in providing alternatives to financial institutions in balance sheet management and capital 
preservation.  The increased provisioning slowly underway in the region may finally allow banks 
to dispose of their distressed assets at market prices.  IFC will make equity and loan investments 
in select collection companies and/or directly invest in portfolios across asset classes. 
100. In financial markets, IFC will continue to support the strengthening of the banking sector 
and development of capital markets as an additional source of funding. IFC’s role is twofold: (i) 
IFC’s presence, as an active bond investor, increases the likelihood of successful bond 
placements re-opening the dormant local bond market; and (ii) IFC potential participation as 
investor in the IPOs of large state-owned companies, primarily from the energy sector will 
improve the corporate governance of privatized companies in case there will be additionality and 
a transformational role for IFC in such projects. IFC’s impact may be needed in the 
transformation of SOEs into competitive private companies.  
101. IFC’s longer-term strategy in the banking sector, largely dominated by foreign banks, is 
to strengthen the capacity of banks and non-banking financial institutions to provide loans to 
under-served sectors (micro and SMEs, with dedicated loan tranches for on-lending to women 
entrepreneurs) and promote products such as trade finance lines, bond investments, local 
currency and renewable energy finance. More importance will also be given to capital markets 
strengthening by participation in local currency bond market and co- financing of EU programs. 
102. Pillar 2 Instruments: Investment Lending (proposed education sector project), economic 
and sector work (Aging), technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Education, 
Labor Market, Social Assistance); IFC investments;  Joint IBRD/IFC assessments. 
Pillar 3: Social Inclusion 
103. The final pillar is focused on social inclusion, ensuring that all Romanians can share in the 

-26- 

growth and improved service delivery that will be supported by the first two pillars.  There are 
clear overlaps with earlier pillars e.g. improved public administration will enable improved 
service delivery to those that are currently excluded and working on unemployment and skills 
development will also benefit those currently in the bottom 40 percent of the population.  In this 
area, the WBG will focus on (i) Inclusive services for marginalized communities especially the 
Roma and (ii) Improving the social protection system. 
104. Country Goal 6:  Inclusive services for marginalized communities.  The Bank will 
prepare a project to support social inclusion with a strong focus on the Roma.  A Social Inclusion 
Project (SIP) was implemented during the previous CPS period and will close in June 2014. The 
previous SIP addressed differences in development outcomes between Roma and non-Roma 
communities that start in early childhood by constructing, rehabilitating and furnishing 
kindergartens in 27 Roma communities as well as other early childhood inputs, and provisional 
results appear remarkable.  The project will be subjected to an intensive learning Implementation 
Completion Report (ICR) during the forthcoming CPS period. A RAS engagement on poor and 
disadvantaged communities and another report on “Diagnostics and Policy Advice for 
Supporting Roma Inclusion in Romania” are ongoing. Both initiatives will feed into the design 
and implementation of an integrated support project that will include education, housing, health, 
employment and safety nets components as well as mobilizing EU resources and instruments. 
The design will also follow the updated National Roma Integration Strategy as the organizing 
framework for Romania’s reforms and EU financing of Roma inclusion. 
105. Line of sight to the twin goals: Addressing the needs of the marginalized communities in 
an integrated manner will directly reduce poverty in Romania. 
106. Country Goal 7:  Improving the Social Protection System.  Focusing on the growth and 
job creation agenda is the most efficient and sustainable way to move large numbers of poor out 
of poverty. However, there will always be some people who are not able to participate in the 
labor market and not otherwise able to take advantage of a growing economy.  Social protection 
systems are the answer in promoting resilience, equity and opportunity for the poor and 
vulnerable and their improved targeting has been a government priority for some years. 
107. During the previous CPS period, the Bank supported the Social Assistance System 
Modernization Project (SASMP) with the objective of improving the overall performance of 
Romania's social assistance system by strengthening performance management, improving 
equity, improving administrative efficiency and reducing error and fraud.  The project aims to 
increase the share of social assistance funds going to the poorest quintile and to promote the 
efficiency of spending by reducing the administrative costs of means-tested benefits.  It is a 
results-based investment operation that aims to introduce many of the elements of the program 
for results approach.  During the forthcoming CPS period, the Bank will support improvements 
in the social protection system through RAS engagements and the new DPL series.   
108. Line of sight to the twin goals:  The social protection system played an important role in 
protecting the incomes of the bottom forty percent during the crisis.  Improving targeting to the 
needy through means-testing will support income protection for the bottom 40 percent. 
109. Pillar 3 Instruments: Investment Lending (proposed SIP2 project), economic and sector 
work, technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services. Proposed DPLs. 

-27- 

D. IMPLEMENTING THE WORLD BANK GROUP CPS FOR ROMANIA 
WBG ONGOING PROGRAM 
110. The IBRD lending portfolio is US$2.05 billion. During 2009-2013, six new operations 
were approved including: three DPLs, 1 DPL- DDO, a Results Based Social Assistance System 
Modernization project (SASMP) and the Revenue Administration Modernization Project 
(RAMP). The Government has also decided to draw down on the €1 billion under the DPL DDO.  
In October 2013, Government withdrew €700m and announced its intention to draw down the 
remainder in 2014. 
111. There are 24 Reimbursable Advisory Services (worth US$42 million) with ongoing 
engagements to strengthen administrative capacity and support the effectiveness, quality and rate 
of implementation of EU grant programs (covering a multitude of areas, including Agriculture, 
Public Finance, Transport, Education, Competition, Regional Development, Climate Change, 
Center of the Government).  
112. IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Romania as of 30 June 2013 is US$619 million. 
In fiscal year 2013, IFC invested US$160 million in Romania. IFC’s role in Romania is changing 
in light of the country’s EU membership and the growing availability of private financing. IFC 
has focused on sub-national climate change investments, strengthening of the banking sector, 
including lending to SMEs, with a specific focus on women-owned entrepreneurial initiatives, 
local currency bonds investments and trade finance to banks.  
113. MIGA: is not active in Romania but is considering support to EXIM Bank and potential 
support to SOEs especially in the energy sector (see above).   
PARTNERSHIP AND DONOR COORDINATION 
114. The WBG is committed to ensuring a tight alignment at both strategic and 
operational levels of its activities with EU priorities and programs, as discussed above.  A 
significant part of the WBG advisory services will be aimed at strengthening capacity to make 
the most of available EU resources.  The WBG also maintains a close partnership with the EC 
through the organization of regular knowledge-sharing events (including dissemination in 
Brussels of key knowledge products) and the development of ad hoc cooperation in selected 
areas (in particular in areas where the WBG’s technical expertise and local knowledge can 
contribute to advancing the EU agenda).   
115. In June 2013 Romania successfully completed a 27-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) 
with the IMF, including a three-month extension equivalent to SDR 3,090.6 million (€3.4 
billion). The authorities then signed a successor 24-month SBA with proposed access of SDR 
1,751.34 million (about €2 billion) in September 2013.  A similar arrangement was also signed 
with the EC for a comparable sum shortly thereafter. 
116. The WBG cooperates closely with other multilateral institutions and development 
partners. The WBG conducts regular consultations with the IMF and EC accompanies all the 
program missions.  The Bank has also recently strengthened relations with the EIB, EBRD and 
EU technical arms such as JASPERS. 
117. The WBG aims to support Romania’s growing and varied civil society in its 
partnership roles.  A pro-active and empowered civil society is key for Romania’s social 

-28- 

development. The WBG considers that it can benefit greatly from partnering and consulting 
regularly with the representatives of the civil society in view of improving its operational 
performance. The WBG has involved the civil society representatives in the consultations for the 
preparation of the 2014-2018 Country Partnership Strategy for Romania and aims to enhance this 
partnership because it brings valuable local knowledge, innovative and participatory approach to 
solving problems and it leverages the social capital. 
MANAGING THE WBG PROGRAM 
118. The WBG will track progress towards achieving the country outcomes defined in the 
CPS results framework, spelled out in Annex 1. On this basis, the WBG will conduct an annual 
CPS implementation review for assessing progress under the CPS and possible adjustments to 
the WBG program. This review process is also expected to provide inputs for the planned CPS 
Progress Report in FY16 when adjustments in the CPS results framework will be made. 
119. Regular Joint Program Reviews will take stock of progress in implementing the 
WBG Program in Romania. Previous experience showed that the joint program reviews are a 
good opportunity for the Government (with the Ministry of Public Finance as a main 
communication partner, recently expanded to the Ministry of EU Funds to cover the RAS 
engagement) and the Bank to review the progress in implementation of all active projects and 
advisory services and highlight and address any project specific challenges.  In addition, 
quarterly meetings are organized by the Ministry of European Funds  and attended by 
representatives of line ministries, managing authorities, the Bank and other IFIs active on RAS-
type of engagement, to take stock of the RAS portfolio.  Monthly updates are exchanged 
between the Bank and representatives of the Government on these advisory services and an 
annual progress report is prepared. 
IV. MANAGING RISKS 
120. The Romania program is robust, embodies a partnership of trust with the relevant 
authorities and utilizes all the Bank Group’s instruments to the fullest extent.  The RAS 
engagement is expected to stabilize at the current level in the first half of the CPS period, while 
lending will expand as indicated above.  There are risks to this plan as described below: 
121. Political instability: Coalition politics creates a risk for sustainability of structural 
reforms and project implementation.  In February 2014 the ruling coalition broke apart with the 
exit of the National Liberals (PNL) and a new coalition was formed.  However, to date all major 
parties remain committed to the country's reform program and the precautionary arrangements 
with international financing institutions. The Bank team will continue to work with all members 
of the coalition and will continue to consult widely including member of the opposition and other 
stakeholders in order to ensure continuity in the event of political changes.   
122. Macroeconomic risks: External factors include the domestic banking sector's exposure to 
foreign currency denominated assets (62 percent of lending), and weaker external demand from 
the Eurozone, could lead to the widening of the country's current account deficit. However, 
Romania is better prepared to absorb such shocks than before 2008. The current account deficit 
was less than 1 percent in 2013. Euro denominated loans are decreasing. The National Bank of 
Romania continues to use a floating exchange rate while intervening to smooth sharp exchange 
rate fluctuations. The current macroeconomic situation includes significant buffers to further 
exogenous shocks.   

-29- 

123. Financial Sector risks:  While Romanian banks have to cope with high NPLs (currently 
over 22 percent, as at February 2014), related losses have already been recognized in the form of 
loss provisions (89.7% in February 2014), with little residual risk related to such exposures going 
forward. The National Bank of Romania is closely monitoring the situation; capital adequacy is 
comfortable at over 14. Continued prudent macroeconomic policies, EU monitoring safeguards, 
and the IMF, EC, and World Bank-supported programs provide effective mechanisms for 
mitigating these risks. 
124. Institutional capacity: Concern with implementation capacity at both the national and 
local levels has continued to affect Romania. Improving the capacity of government is the first 
pillar of the CPS and will include a number of measures to directly address this bottleneck 
including supporting the implementation of a delivery unit in the Prime Minister’s office.  The 
government is keen to make progress in the area of public administration reform and 
strengthening public institutions. 
125. Portfolio implementation risks:  During the previous CPS period, several Bank 
supported projects were hampered in their implementation due to a lack of counterpart 
government funds and insufficient fiscal space. The Bank has since restructured its portfolio and 
canceled or closed several projects.  In order to avoid this happening in future, the Bank has 
supported the Romanian administration to review the process of investment financing and is 
engaged in a RAS on project selection models.  The Government is also under-taking a number 
of measures to prioritize the large infrastructure investment program and ensure that only EU 
funded and other priority projects are included in the budget.  These measures are being 
supported and followed up under the proposed DPL series. 
126. Risks to the RAS program:  The RAS program has grown rapidly during the previous 
CPS period and the next CPS period envisages a stabilization in the level of the engagement. The 
tendency towards engaging only on more selective and transformative RAS programs which is 
now ongoing would be further pursued in the upcoming CPS.  The Bank will monitor the RAS 
program, including with government, and support the Romanian authorities in strengthening 
their management and direction of the program. This oversight function will be an integral part 
of the joint portfolio review process with Government. 
127. Fiduciary risks:  The legal framework of the Romanian public procurement system has 
undergone significant improvements in line with EU legislation 7 . The present institutional 
framework follows the principles of institutional independence and separation of competencies8. 
Romania has enhanced its e –procurement system (SEAP) to cover all key phases of the 
procurement process.  However the slow procurement process and low transparency in how 
public funds are spent, and reported integrity challenges remain an issue. Public procurement 
was identified as a cross-cutting issue in the sector functional reviews prepared by the Bank and 
among the main factors accounting for the country’s low rates of EU funds absorption. Key 
obstacles include the frequent changes in the legal framework, the complex institutional set up, 
resulting in misalignment and overlap of responsibilities, and lack of sufficient capacity.  In 

7 The public procurement law (Emergency Government Ordinance 34/2006) was adopted in June 2006 and is fully aligned with 
EU Directives. The law has undergone several substantial amendments since June 2006, the last one entering into force in April 
2013. 
8 The regulator – ANRMAP reports to the Prime Minister, the ex-ante Control Unit (UCVAP) to the Minister of Public Finance, 
the e-procurement system operator (National Center for IT Management Society) to the Ministry of Communication and 
Information Society; the complaint handling body National Council for Complaint Resolution (CNSC) is an independent body;  

-30- 

                                                            
addition, while the e-procurement system is in place, only around 40% of the procurement 
transactions take place through the system. Thus its main advantages – obtaining best value for 
money and high monitoring potential – could not be fully utilized. The area of public 
procurement is also one of the areas identified by the Romania Government as priority for the 
Delivery Unit in the Prime Minister’s office.

CPS Objectives and Outcome 
Indicators 

Pillar 1: Creating a 21st Century Government 

Romania’s prudent macroeconomic 
performance has led to its exit from the 
EU Excessive Deficit Procedure, but 
continued fiscal consolidation is needed 
to reach the money transfer operator 
(MTO). 

In order to consolidate this achievement, 
the government is planning action in 
three areas; revenue administration, debt 
management and improving the quality 
and effectiveness of public expenditures. 

CPS Objective 1: 

Revenue and expenditure 
administration improved. 

Outcome Indicators: 
(i) Increasing tax revenues by 
3% of GDP within 5 years. 
(The 2013 baseline was 28 
percent of GDP). 

(ii) Introducing results-
informed budgeting, and 
piloting it in two ministries. 

Goal 1: 

Improving public 
administration 

(This outcome is linked to 
the following Europe 
2020 strategic elements: 
Guideline 1 
“Ensuring the quality and 
the sustainability 
of public finances” 
and Guideline 2 
“Addressing 
macroeconomic

Romania wants to upgrade the health 
care system to meet the needs of an 
aging population and take advantage of 
new health technologies.   

The reform program will increase the 
emphasis on primary and secondary 
prevention, reduce unnecessary inpatient 
admission services. 

The reforms will rationalizing hospitals, 
enhance primary care at the community 
level, increase ambulatory care, and 
improve governance over the whole 
sector.

Pillar 2 : Growth and Job Creation 

Goal 3: 

Enhanced business environment 

(This outcome is linked to the 
following Europe 2020 strategic 
elements: Flagship Initiative “An 
industrial policy for the 
globalization era” and Guideline 6 
“Improving the business and 
consumer environment and 
modernizing the 
industrial base”) 

Increasing Romania’s productivity 
growth and competitiveness requires 
increasing both international and 
domestic investment.  But the 
business environment remains weak.  
Romania ranks at 73 out of 183 
countries and 25 out of 28 EU 
countries. Getting electricity, paying 
taxes, registering property and 
dealing with construction permits 
require the most attention.  

Goal 4: 

Inclusive and efficient labor 
markets 

(This outcome is linked to the 
following Europe 2020 strategic 
elements: National Europe 2020 
targets (for Romania): (i) 70 
percent of the population aged 20-
64 employed: (ii) the share of early 
school leavers 11.3 percent; (iii) at 
least 26.7 percent of 30–34 year-
olds completed tertiary education; 
(iv) at least 10 percent of 25-64 
year-olds participate in lifelong 
learning 

Participation in the labor market is 
widely seen as the most effective 
way to escape poverty and share in 
the country’s prosperity. 

Yet, labor force participation 
remains low, especially for three 
groups: older workers, women 
(especially rural), and youth 
(especially low-skilled). Skills are a 
key barrier to labor force 
participation and Romania is 
developing strategic frameworks to 
address early school leaving promote 
completion of higher education and 
expand lifelong learning. 

Significant resources are available 
under the new EU Financial 
Perspective to promote labor market 
inclusion through education and 
skills interventions.

30-34 year-olds who have 
completed a higher 
education degree from the 
2012 baseline of 21.8 
percent 
(iii) Increasing the share of 
adults (aged 25-64) 
participating in lifelong 
learning from the 2012 
baseline of 1.4 percent 

Goal 5: 

Improving access to finance 

Years of deleveraging have shrunk 
the Romanian banking sector.  Banks 
need to reduce their NPLs and start 
lending to the private sector 
especially SMEs. 

To support this objective, 
government is working on the 
resolution framework to facilitate 
NPL clean-ups. 

CPS Objective 5: 

WBG 

Making it easier for 
business to exit the market.  

Outcome Indicator: 
(i) adopting a new 
insolvency code in line 
with the ROSC principles. 

(ii) Reducing the time 
taken to resolve 
insolvencies from 3.3 to 
2.75 years.

Pillar 3 : Social Inclusion 

Goal 6: 

Inclusive services for 
marginalized communities  

(This outcome is linked to the 
following Europe 2020 strategic 
element: (i) reduction of the 
population at risk of poverty or 
social exclusion [Romania 
target] 580,000 and (ii)  
Flagship Initiative “European 
platform against poverty”) 

The Roma are a marginalized 
community 90 percent live in severe 
material deprivation.  Integrating 
them into mainstream society by 
ensuring equality of education, 
opportunity and providing them with 
basic living standards can bring great 
economic benefits to the country. 

However, achieving this will require 
an integrated multi-faceted solution 
including education, housing, 
employment, health and infrastructure 
inputs that will have to be coordinated 
and carefully applied. 

Goal 7: 

Improving the social 
protection system 

Social protection systems have played 
an important part in reducing poverty 
in Romania as in other EU countries. 

In order to ensure the sustainability of 
the Romanian social protection 
system in the context of an ongoing 
fiscal consolidation it will be 
important to reduce the administrative 
costs of the system especially for 
means-tested benefits and attempt to 
divert more resources to the poorest 
quintile. 

CPS Objective 6: 

WBG 

Support an ambitious and 
successful government 
program to tackle social 
inclusion of the Roma 
community. 

Outcome Indicators:  
(i) An updated national Roma 
strategy adopted and 
implemented. 

(ii) An increase in the 
percentage of Roma children 
enrolled in pre-primary 
education (currently 30%).  
This indicator will also track 
the percentage of Roma girls 
in preschool (currently 34%) 

(iii) Successfully mobilizing 
EU resources and instruments 
(including by supporting the 
implementation of the 
Community Led Local 
Development (CLLD) 
instrument for Roma 
inclusion. 

CPS Objective 7:  

A more streamlined, better 
targeted and more cost-
efficient social protection 
system. 

Outcome Indicator:  
(i) Government consolidates 
three means-tested programs 
and reduces disincentives for 
work by changing the benefit 
formula to avoid penalizing 
work. 

(ii) Increasing the coverage of 
means-tested programs to 60 
percent of the poorest 20 
percent of households by end 
2017.

128. Romania’s debt remains sustainable in the medium term under a range of adverse 
shocks, such as a combined permanent shock of 0.25 standard deviation in the real interest rate, 
the GDP growth rate, and the CAD (Figure 2, panel a). With these adverse assumptions, external 
debt continues to decline, though more moderately than in the baseline, reaching about 68 
percent of GDP in 2018 compared to 59 percent in the baseline. However, an extreme shock of a 
one-time 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation (Figure 2, panel b)—which could be caused 
by a reversal of prudent macroeconomic policies, large capital outflows, and a confidence shock–
–would escalate external debt to about 100 percent of GDP in the short run before sliding back to 
87 percent by 2018. This underscores the importance of continued monetary and fiscal prudence 
to keep macroeconomic vulnerabilities in check.

129. Streamlining business regulation and provision of eGovernment services.  The General 
Secretariat of the Government (GSG) has launched a project to identify the administrative 
barriers and to evaluate the time and costs for regulatory compliance imposed by the stock of 
legal regulations in different regulatory areas so that a target of 25% reduction of administrative 
burdens can be established at the end of the simplification process. In addition in an effort to 
calculate the real cost of regulations regulatory impact assessments (RIA) will be carried out. 
This area will be supported by the proposed DPL and joint IBRD-IFC advisory services. 
130. Supporting SMEs.  Government has been paying particular attention to both the Small 
Business Act for Europe (SBA), launched by the European Commission, and to the achievement 
of the priorities in the 'Strategy Europe 2020' (smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth). 

9 Estimates for 2011, based on 2005-2009 figures from the Structural Business Statistics Database (Eurostat). The estimates have been produced 
by Cambridge Econometrics. The data cover the 'business economy' which includes industry, construction, trade, and services (NACE Rev. 2 
Sections B to J, L, M and N). The data does not cover the enterprises in agriculture, forestry, fishing or the largely nonmarket services such as 
education and health. The advantage of using Eurostat data is that the statistics from different countries have been harmonized and are 
comparable across countries. The disadvantage is that for some countries these data may be different from data published by national authorities.

Box A2: The Europe 2020 strategy and reducing poverty and social exclusion 

Adopted in 2010, Europe 2020 is the European Union’s strategy for “smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.” The 
strategy includes five interrelated headline targets to be achieved by the year 2020, encompassing employment, 
innovation, education, poverty and social inclusion, and climate/energy. The development strategies of EU member 
states are set within the broader framework of the Europe 2020 strategy.  

One of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the number of poor and socially excluded people 
by 20 million, with national-level targets set by each of the EU Member States. Romania has set a national target of 
reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) by 580,000 by the year 2020. Three 
interrelated indicators are used. First is the at-risk-of-poverty rate (AROP), a measure of relative poverty defined as 
the percent of the population with incomes less than 60 percent of the national median income after social transfers. 
Second is the index of severe material deprivation (SMD), a measure of the percent of people who cannot afford a 
number of necessities that are considered essential in order to live decent lives in Europe. Third is low work 
intensity (LWI), which is the percentage of people living in households in which adults worked less than 20 percent 
of their potential. A person who is considered deprived by any one (or more) of these measures is considered at risk 
of poverty or social exclusion. 

Romania has the second-highest rate of AROPE in the EU at 41.7 percent in 2012 (Bulgaria’s rate for 2012 is 49.3 
percent). The AROPE rate has fallen from 45.9 percent in 2007, decreasing steadily to 40.3 in 2011 before ticking 
up slightly in 2012. Severe material deprivation (SMD) is the largest contributor to poverty and social exclusion in 
Romania, with nearly 30 percent of the population unable to afford several basic necessities. The second largest 
contributor in Romania is AROP, or risk of relative monetary poverty, which has fluctuated slightly between 21 and 
25 percent of the Romanian population since 2007. Low work intensity is by far the smallest contributor, with only 
seven percent of the Romanian population living in jobless households.

131. Enhancing competition and harmonizing the institutional framework for competition 
with EU principles is needed to reignite productivity growth in Romania. The business 
environment in Romania is less conducive to competition than other EU countries with negative 
impacts on productivity growth. Rules of the game that favor competition are an essential 
condition for economic growth as they have important knock-on effects on the functioning of 
markets. In this regard, competition policy is a powerful instrument to increase efficiency in 
domestic markets and also to increase integration of markets across the EU. There is significant 
scope for competition policy in Romania. The OECD ranks Romania, in terms of degree to 
which regulations restrict competition, at 20th out of the 22 EU countries rated in the most recent 
survey (see Figure A15). Romania’s rank on the effectiveness of anti-monopoly policies – a 
perception based indicator -- has plummeted from 66 to 113, according to the Global 
Competitiveness Report (2009-10 and 2013-14). Without competition firms do not face strong 
incentives to reduce costs, innovate and become more efficient and productive than their rivals 
and therefore they do not create the basis for further growth in employment.  Romania still lags 

-41- 

 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
behind EU economies in the application of competition policy.  Without completion firms do not 
face strong incentives to reduce costs, innovate and become more efficient and productive than 
their rivals and therefore they do not create the basis for further growth in employment. This area 
is being directly supported by the RAS with the Romanian Competition Council.

132. Equally important will be the Authorities’ ability to leverage the capacity of nonbank 
financial institutions. In the decade prior to the crisis, the financial system grew rapidly, 
dominated by banks. Today, scarcer foreign funding means that the large financing requirements 
needed to support economic development will have to be met from domestic sources, including 
the nonbanking sector. Even pension funds have become more important in Romania, nonbank 
financial intermediation remains embryonic, and further reforms are required to strengthen the 
pension system’s ability to participate in developing domestic capital markets. The need to 
develop the nonbanking sector, starting with strengthening its regulation and supervision, is 
important for the development of the sector. 

133. Improving the exit regime is also essential to foster firms churning and the resulting 
private investments and productivity increases.  The insolvency legal framework in Romania 
gas undergone important reforms. However it requires significant improvements to make it fully 
compliant with international standards and to fit to deal effectively with the challenges it faces in 
a difficult economic climate. Firms suffering from financial difficulty with valuable breathing 
space to redeploy resources in orderly way, the smoother reallocation of resources into more 
productive uses needs and the predictability brought by an efficient insolvency system would 
help the resumption of private sector growth.

Annex 3:  Poverty, Shared Prosperity and Gender in Romania 

Gender in Romania 

Education 
134. In Romania, the overall rate of participation in education is higher for women than for 
men, with some exceptions for Roma and rural population. In the school year 2012-2013 77.2% 
of those enrolled in education were women compared to 75.3% men. Moreover, the European 
Institute for Gender Equality reports an equal number of women and men that are graduatesof tertiary 
education. However, the situation is slightly different comparing Roma to non-Roma and urban to 
rural population (as shown in Figure A18). The rate of enrollment for Roma population is 
dramatically lower than for the non-Roma, with even more alarming rate for women both in rural and 
urban environment, most opf the time due to discriminatory environment, promoted especially by 
teachers, as the Regional Roma Survey shows.

135. Stereotypes in Romania promote the idea that people of Roma origin are not supporting 
their children’s education. The Roma Regional Survey included questions referring to this 
hypothesis and the findings show that Roma parents have similar desires regarding their children’s’ 
education to non-Roma parents when it comes to upper secondary education. The same share of 
Roma and non-Roma parents wants their children, both girls and boys, to graduate upper secondary 
education. The difference is higher when referring to the post-secondary education, Roma people 
being more reluctant to their children’s enrollment for further education: only 23% of Roma parents 
compared to around 45% of non-Roma parents who want their children to enroll in tertiary 
education. There are no relevant differences in the attitude towards the education of women and men. 

Health 
136. On average, women and men benefit from the same quality of health services and have 
equal access to it. The EU statistics shows that the services provided for Romanian men and women 
are equal, together with the access to these services. In the same time, the most important recorded 
difference is related to life expectancy at birth which is higher for women than for men. Women are 
expected to live around 77.6 years compared to men who are expected to live 70.1 years. Despite 
this, the subjective well-being is lower for women, only 66% of the Romanian women reporting good 
or very good health, compared to 75.8%. This is also the trend at EU level. (see annex 2). 

137. Within the most vulnerable groups, women are more affected than men. Generally, the 
problems refer to: (i) diseases that are determined by poor living conditions, such as infectious 
diseases, diarrhea and respiratory disease- this is generally the case for Roma households, (ii) 
unhealthy and risky behavior such as smoking, poor diet and low levels of physical activity, (iii) lack 

-44- 

 
 
 
of access to health facilities, which is caused by distance from the hospital or clinic, and high costs of 
the needed care combined with the lack of insurance. By all these, women seem to be more affected, 
reporting a lower satisfaction with their health condition. This is justifiable especially since the 
responsibility of taking care of the household and children is almost entirely belonging to women. 

Economic activity and employment 

138. In Romania, women’s employment rates are lower with 15% than those of men. One of 
the EU 2020 targets is to reach a higher employment rate in each Member State. At EU level, the 
target is 75% and the national target for Romania is 70%. This cannot be reached if attention is not 
being paid to the integration of women on the formal labor market. The total employment rate is 
63.8%, and the employment rate for men is 71.4% compared to 56.3% for women.  

139. Active measures need to be taken to encourage the integration of women in  the formal 
labor market. In some cases, the lower employment rate for women come as a consequence of 
parenthood. The employment rate for women who have children is much lower than for women 
without children in almost all European Union Member States, but the gender employment gap is 
even higher in Romania. At the other end, men’s employment rate does not seem to be much affected 
by parenthood. The explanation of this negative influence of parenthood on women’s employment is 
double edged. First, we need to make reference to the existence of affordable formal arrangements 
for children care. In 2011, in Romania, only 3% of population of up to 3 years was attending this 
type of child care, and around 40% for those above 3 years. In a comparison made by the EU at 
Member States’ level, Romania has the lowest scores. Secondly, larger costs of care facilities 
increase the marginal effective tax rates for second earners when moving from non-work to work, or 
when increasing hours worked, acting as disincentive to take up jobs or increase working hours given 
that second earners have large labor supply elasticity. 

140. Furthermore, the longer women are out of the labor market or unemployed due to care 
duties, the more difficult will be for them to find a job in the longer term. The gender 
employment gap is widening through life cycle, especially because employers prefer people with 
experience than only educated people, so it becomes even more difficult to be employed on 
something that you are qualified on since you do not have enough experience. This employment gap 
reaches a peak for the older cohort. A direct consequence is that fewer career options push senior 
women out of formal labor market into informal labor market, which accounts in providing care for 
grandchildren or elderly individuals and which is dominated by women. And this affects the quality 
of life and promotes harmful stereotypes. It has been proven that housewives tend to have serious 
socializing problems, being difficult for them to integrate in society and in the labor market. Another 
direct consequence is that women immigrate and go to other countries, to work. National Statistics 
from 2012 show that there are more women who have immigrated in the past years, and most of them 
aged 18-40 years.  

141. One of the most obvious gender disparities are reflected in earning and pensions. The 
prevailing gender gaps in the working age population result in wide pension gaps between women 
and men. According to EUROSTAT data, in the year 2011, the percentage of the difference in 
payments between men and women at EU level was 16.4% and in Romania, 12%. All years of 
experience taken into account, this translates into even a greater pension’s gap. At EU level, the 
gender gap in pensions is of 39%, whereas in Romania it reaches 32%.  

-45- 

 
 
Entrepreneurship 

142. There are fewer women entrepreneurs than men in Romania. In 2008, in Romania, from 
the total number of people who owned a business, only 27% were women, and only 31% of 
businesses had a women associate. Studies done by different organizations that support women 
entrepreneurship show that there are two main interlinked causes. Firstly, the situation is caused by 
stereotypes. One of them is that entrepreneurship being perceived as an area where men can be more 
successful. Another stereotype is related to the perception of power relationship, according to which 
people are used to see men leading and women as subordinates. Secondly, another cause of the low 
number of women entrepreneurs is that given this stereotypes, it is more difficult for women to 
access necessary funds to begin and maintain an enterprise.  

Agent/Voice and representation 

143. Women are better represented in 2013 compared to 1990. In the 1990-1992 Parliament, 
only 24 women were elected as parliamentarians and this was representing 4.9% of the total number. 
In the 2012-2016 Parliament, 68 parliamentarians are women and this accounts for 11.5%. Although 
the number is still low, it is encouraging to see constant progress towards a more representative voice 
for women in the Parliament. Moreover, in the current government, the majority of Ministers are 
men, and only 17% are women (the cabinet is formed of 27 plus the Prime Minister and there are 
only six women).  

Violence 

144. Better education and higher financial independence for women could decrease the rate 
of domestic violence. The most recent report done by the Ministry of Labor, Family and Social 
Protection in 2009 on domestic violencen showns that during 2004-2008 around 48.000 cases of 
domestic violence were recorded, out of which 672 resulted in deaths. Most of the victims were adult 
women, followed by girls and boys. The biggest occurrence was for women between 25 and 45 years 
old, reporting that they were beaten, most of the times, on a weekly basis. Out of this number, the 
lowest percentage is represented by women who graduated college who are more financially 
independent. The report also shows that out of the total number of victims, only 33.73% are making 
complaints to the police and up to 13% withdrawn. This happens because in most of the cases, there 
is a high financial dependency on the aggressor and especially in families with children, women are 
still obliged to live with the aggressor afterwards. In conclusion, there are two cases in which the 
reported violence is lower: (i) when women were graduates of tertiary education, (ii) where women 
were less dependable on the income produced by the aggressor.  

National Strategy 

145. The Ministry of Labor has prepared a national strategy for gender equality, to cover the 
period 2014-2017. The main areas of intervention are: (i)education, (ii)labor force, (iii) participation 
to the decision making, (iv)integrated approach for gender equality, (v)gender violence. The 
objectives proposed are mostly related to combating gender stereotypes, raising awareness on the 
main problems affecting gender equality and analyze the current situation. In consequence, the most 
of the activities planned are social campaigns, researches, and reports writing. The biggest flaw of 
this strategy is that it does not include any active measures to address real problems related to gender 
inequality. For example, the gender gap in the remuneration is around 15%. In order to change this, 
there is place for more action that just to raise awareness that this problem exists. The Government 
could create facilities for private companies to support covering this gap.

Areas where the Bank could support the Romanian Government 
Pillar 1: 21st Century Government 
 
Increasing gender equality in the government, including the judicial sector 
 
Incorporating a gender perspective in organizational, tax, expenditure, and processes reforms 
Pillar 2: Growth and Job Creation 
 Decreassing the gender pay gap 
 
Increasing access to formal and accessible day care for balancing the influence of parenthood 
on female employment 
 Combatting stereotypes related to women’s role in society as a whole and to female 
entrepreneurship 
 
Incorporating a gender analysis into analytical work on job creation 
Pillar 3: Social Inclusion 
 Promoting gender equality in education and health 
 Reducing gender based violence 
Types of action 

146. The World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development proposes global 
action to focus on complementing country efforts on five priority areas. These areas are relevant 
for Romania. 

 Closing gender gaps in human endowments, especially for those that are coming from the 
most vulnerable categories, such as the poor, the rural and the Roma population where 
women are even more affected.  
 Women’s access to economic opportunities, in Romania’s case, refers to more and better 
incentives for increasing women’s formal employment 
 Closing gender gaps in voice and agency reffers to encouraging and promoting women’s 
leadership roles and representation at all levels in the public administration and in key 
decision-making positions 
 Preventing intergenerational reproduction of gender inequality can be better reflected in 
adequate educational programs, in which positive examples are offered to young boys and 
girls 
 Supporting evidence-based public action: in Romania, the data used by the public authorities 
in terms of gender is a few years old and the EU is supporting the country in this area. 
However, there is still a lack of bodies inside the institutions to monitor the implementation 
of different targets and to report on the status of the activities proposed by the national 
Startegy for equal opportunities for men and women.

Romania Portfolio Review: Assessing Gender Inclusion10 

147. Projects can include gender dimensions in the analytical underpinnings of the projects, actions 
supported, and the results framework. Attention to gender in project design can enhance their 
development impact and contribute to shared prosperity. The review assesses the portfolio for most 
frequent ways that gender has been included in analysis, actions and results frameworks, identified 
some missed opportunities for gender inclusion, and opportunities for integrating gender going 
forward. Main findings from a desk review of project materials (PADs, ISRs, concept notes, 
quarterly reports) and exchange with select TTL’s of active projects include:  

 

In FY10-13 Romania outperformed the ECA region, but fell short of the World Bank average 
on gender-informed lending projects. 
 Active lending projects are slightly underperforming in prior years, with 63% gender 
informed. 
 Lending projects from FY10-14 have been gender informed most often in their analysis. 
 100% of lending projects and AAA on social inclusion are gender informed. 
 44% of lending projects and AAA on government and 50% on jobs and growth are gender 
informed. 
 Most FY14-15 AAA (61%) does not include any gender analysis. AAA often serves as 
background work to lending, therefore the meaningful inclusion of gender here can translate 
into better inclusion in the active portfolio down the line. Its absence is a main missed 
opportunity. 
 Going forward, specific AAA for FY15 that could incorporate gender includes that on 
reducing early school leaving, increasing tertiary education, lifelong learning, taxes and 
expenditure, and real estate modernization. 

Further analysis is provided below.

Pillar I. Creating 21st Century Government 
148. Budgeting decisions over public investments is a key area that should be informed by 
analyzing the distinct impacts of spending on women and men. For example, the DPL-DDO 
recognizes that its shifting of resources to the elderly benefits women since they have longer life 

10 This review looks at gender inclusion in the active and pipeline portfolio from projects FY10-13 and covers 
projects for which documents were available. The review also covers AAA for FY14 and FY15. Projects without 
concept notes were not reviewed. Also considered in the review are ratings undertaken by PREM Gender Anchor.

expectancies. Analysis can also focus on who receives which transfers as well as who are the 
publicly funded employees. Additionally, this principle of recognizing differences between women 
and men is required in changes to tax laws and administration. The Revenue Administration Project 
recognizes that the absence of gender disaggregated data on tax compliance limits analysis. It then 
specifies that surveys supported by the project to assess taxpayer services will provide gender 
disaggregated data and monitor resulting gender differences.  

149. However, the Judicial Reform Project would have benefited from explicitly mandating gender 
disaggregated baseline and results surveys. Additionally, justice sector reforms could take into 
account gender imbalances of judges and others in the judicial system, the level of sensitivity to 
gender based violence, and a gender informed analysis of case delay and resolution. While the AAA 
Judicial Functional Review mentions women as at risk in access to justice, it too does not include this 
type of fully informed gender analysis. Similarly, the AAA HR Strategy for MOF could have gender 
informed its entire analysis, including recruiting,  hours, promotions, pay, staff development, staff 
performance, and harassment. Additionally, gender should be included in upcoming AAA on the 
issues of land registration and taxes and expenditure. 

Pillar II. Growth and job creation 

150. Access to economic opportunities is where the greatest gender gaps in Romania persist, and 
these gaps limit Romania’s economic potential. Strategies for growth and job creation can correct 
some of the gender gaps currently observed through incorporating lessons from what we know to be 
similarities and differences between men and women as workers, employers, and family members. 
Analysis in the Social Assistance System Modernization Project recognizes that Romanian society 
values labor force participation of both men and women. Combining this with knowledge of family 
care situations, implementation included a mother back-to-work bonus that roughly pays for child 
care for a year. This employment support for mothers successfully stimulated their return to work 
and adequate child care. The project also gender disaggregates beneficiaries reached by government 
social assistance. Additionally, AAA work has incorporated a gender analysis of employment in one 
report, and two others have informed their monitoring and evaluation. However, AAA work on 
competitiveness and growth poles would have benefited from gender differentiated analysis of 
employment, ownership, access to finance, and training. For example, there is gender segregation by 
sector, and men are currently twice as likely as women to be employers and own account workers. 
These lessons could be relevant to the AAA work.  

Pillar III. Social Inclusion 

151. Attention to overall gender disparities as well as those within the Roma community will be 
crucial to effectively improving social inclusion in Romania. Already, the Health Sector Reform 
Project successfully includes gender analysis and actions in improving the quality of public sector 
interventions and access to basic health services, specifically to the system of maternity and neonatal 
care. At the same time, the Social Inclusion Project targets social assistance projects for victims of 
domestic violence, and the Social Assistance System Modernization Project gender disaggregates 
beneficiaries reached by government programs. This targeting of gender analysis, actions, and 
monitoring can improve social inclusion, contributing to shared prosperity and sustainable 
development. Upcoming AAA work on leaving school early could therefore benefit from analyzing 
gender differences in causes. Similarly, work on tertiary education could analyze differences in 
enrollment and specialization. Doing so could inform more effective policy design under this CPS.

Annex 4: Romania – Property Rights and Climate Action 

Box A3: The importance of property rights in Romania 

Lack of reliable information on real estate rights affects the development of rural and urban areas, infrastructure, 
growth, social development, and environmental actions. Less than 50 percent of real estate rights are registered in the 
cadastre, and only 15 percent of real estate records are verified and registered in digital form in the eTerra system. Coverage 
is particularly low in rural areas, where only 9% are registered in the eTerra system (9%). This hampers EU structural 
investments.  It also constrains farmers’ ability to utilize funds under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and 
access institutional credit. Thus, increasing the coverage of legal real estate registration would improve the efficiency and 
transparency of real estate market transactions, stimulate farmland consolidation, trigger new investments, and allow greater 
and more efficient use of EU funds in Romania.' 
Implications of the lack of reliable information on real estate rights: 
 Limited tenure security for many Romanians and the real risk of incurring a high cost in having rights formally 
recognized or resolving disputed claims; 
 Delays in investments in infrastructure and environmental projects in urban/rural areas as a result of 
difficulties in clarifying rights and gaining access to land; 
 Limited investment in rural areas due to uncertainty over property rights; 
 Stagnation of the real estate market and great difficulty in consolidating land holdings; 
 Limited scope of the mortgage finance market development due in large part to the inability of using land 
resources as security to facilitate economic and business activity; 
 Difficulties in raising local taxes due to lack of reliable information for real property taxation. 
Government is launching a registration campaign to register over 20 million properties over the next eight years with the 
support of EU funding.  The Bank has been supporting land registration in Romania since late 90'ies and is well positioned 
to provide technical assistance to these large programs.   
Special attention should be paid to regularize Roma property rights. The Roma are present in almost every rural village. 
Many have built informal settlements on the outskirts of villages.  The land that they have occupied is in general the 
property of the state (public or private); they have built houses and the local authorities have generally tolerated this 
situation. In some cases the municipalities solved the lack of property deeds by approving the issuance of property titles, 
based on the restitution laws. Nevertheless, there are a large number of informal settlements in the rural villages. Systematic 
registration is the solution to formalize these cases. 

Ensuring sustainability by tackling climate change 

152. Climate change affects Romania.  Global warming will have a far-reaching impact on 
the earth's climate patterns and pose a serious threat to global and local ecological and economic 
systems. Like all other countries, Romania is not immune to climate change.  The country has 
already been experiencing the effects of climate variability and change. In 2005, Romania 
suffered historic floods which caused 76 deaths and significant property damage, and 2007 
brought the country’s most severe drought in the last 60 years. Extreme weather events have 
adversely affected the country through significant economic loss in agriculture, transport, energy 
supply, and water management. Climate action is an important priority for Romania as the 
negative impacts of climate change are forecast to become more severe.  
153. Compared to other EU Member States, the agriculture and rural development 
(ARD) sector in Romania is significant, occupying 59.8% of total territory and home to 44.9% 
of the total population.  Mitigation and adaptation procedures need to be put in place to build the 

-54- 

 
 
resilience and adaptive capacity of the two key ARD sub-sectors (large commercial farms and 
communities of small-scale subsistence farms). IFC will continue financing underserved farmers. 
154. Tackling excessive energy intensity to address climate change. While significant 
progress has been made, Romania remains among the most energy-intensive economies in the 
EU because of structural issues, inefficiency in thermal power generation, manufacturing – 
chemicals and steel in particular – and in other major end uses, such as space heating.  Key 
financing gaps exist, especially in mobilizing private sector investments in energy efficiency.  
Energy sector reforms, e.g. governance, regulation and subsidies remain unfinished.  
Implementation capacity is lacking, which has contributed to the underutilization of EU funds.   
155. Shifting towards a low-carbon economy poses three main challenges in Romania: (i) 
securing reliable and cleaner energy supply, (ii) increasing energy efficiency, and (iii) 
maintaining energy affordability.  Per capita fuel and electricity consumption in Romania are 
among the lowest in the EU, at about 51 and 47 percent of the EU average, respectively.  
Significant increases in energy demand are expected as growth and convergence continue.  Fossil 
fuels account for 77 percent of Romania’s primary energy supply.  Natural gas accounts for 
about 40 percent of all fossil fuels but has been in decline due to dwindling domestic supply.  
The energy sector needs to ensure reliable supply for the growing demand while pursuing cost-
effective de-carbonization options.  Large opportunities exist in end use sectors to reduce future 
energy demand through energy efficiency investments and behavioral changes, as indicated in 
the energy intensity gap between Romania and the EU15 countries.  While there are still 
significant gains from economic structural adjustments, much of the future energy productivity 
improvement will come from investments in retrofits, energy-efficient designs and technologies, 
areas where success has been limited by policy barriers and implementation constraints.  Energy 
affordability remains a key issue, especially in the residential sector.   
156. The EU is also committed to tackling climate change12 and becoming a highly energy-
efficient, low-carbon economy. It has installed some of the world’s most ambitious climate and 
energy “20-20-20” targets for 2020, and passed binding legislation to ensure that they are 

12 The EU as a whole is committed to achieving at least a 20% reduction of its greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions (excluding LULUCF12) by 2020 compared to 1990. This objective implies: 
- 21% reduction in emissions from sectors covered by the EU ETS (emission trading scheme) compared to 
2005 by 2020;  
- 10% reduction in emissions for sectors outside the EU ETS (non-ETS sectors). To achieve this 10% overall 
target each Member State has agreed country-specific greenhouse gas emission limits for 2020 compared to 2005 
(Council Decision 2009/406/EC).  
National level (Romania): 
By NRP 2011-2013, Romania committed to achieve by 2020 a target for reducing GHG emission (excluding 
LULUCF) by 20%, as compared to 1990 reference year. 
By the Kyoto Protocol, Romania committed to achieve by 2012 an intermediary target for reducing GHG 
emission by 8%, as compared to 1989 reference year - in Romania, the forecast for 2012 indicates a decrease of 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) by 22.92%, as compared to 1990 reference year. 
By the legislative package “Energy - Climate Change”, for sectors outside the EU ETS (non-ETS sectors), 
Romania may have, by 2020, higher emissions, increased by 19%, as compared to the basic year 2005. 
In Romania, according to National Inventory Report (NIR) from October 2013, for 2011 compared to 1990 
reference year, the total of greenhouse gas emissions (excluding LULUCF) decreased by 49.54% and the total of 
greenhouse gas emissions (including LULUCF) decreased by 54.84%.

achieved. The Multiannual Financial Framework approved by the European Council in February 
2013 particularly requires that “Climate action objectives represent at least 20 percent of EU 
spending in the period 2014-2020.” As an EU member state, Romania has made a commitment 
to the following climate action targets: achieving, by 2020, a 24% share of energy from 
renewable sources in its gross final energy consumption (up from 18% in 2005). Romania’s 
operational programming for EU funds in the budgetary cycle of 2014-2020 needs to reflect and 
integrate climate action on mitigation and adaptation for meeting the objective of 20% climate-
related expenditures. This represents a great opportunity to channel billions of Euros in a 
combination of modern technologies and traditional sectors (for example building retrofits), 
which will mostly benefit local companies, and the EU also encourages to use these funds to 
leverage private resources for investment (for example electricity generation and building 
rehabilitation). IFC is and will continue to be  active in co-financing EU funds in this area

Annex 5: Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report 

Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Board Discussion:
July 16, 2009 
CPS Progress Report (Board AOB): December 20, 2011 
Period covered by CPS Completion Report:
July 2009-June 2013 

PART I:  OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND PROGRAM OVERVIEW   

157. 
 The overall program performance of the Romania Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) for the period July 2009- June 2013 is rated moderately satisfactory, and Bank 
performance in designing and managing CPS program implementation is also rated 
moderately satisfactory.  Progress in helping Romania restore sound public finances, achieve 
fiscal consolidation, and implement important structural reforms in several sectors supported 
under the first part of the CPS was successful. Progress in helping Romania meet longer-term 
development objectives in the context of EU convergence during the second half of the CPS was 
in some cases slower than expected, particularly in the energy, transport, and agriculture sectors.  
158. The Romania CPS was discussed just two years after Romania joined the European 
Union (EU) in 2007 and at a time of major uncertainty caused by the global financial crisis. 
It therefore adopted a flexible approach that defined the Bank’s program for the first two years, 
focusing on a series of Development Policy Lending (DPL) operations (DPLs1-3) that provided 
€1 billion (US$1.36 billion) 13 to support macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms, 
including in the areas of budgeting, the pension system, public pay, health and education 
expenditure efficiencies, rationalization of the social assistance system, and financial sector 
consolidation. The structural reform agenda was also supported by demand-driven Analytical 
and Advisory Activities (AAA). The CPS allowed flexibility in the outer years to adapt to 
changing circumstances and needs. The CPS built on a strong partnership with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), European Commission (EC), and other financial institutions (e.g., EBRD, 
EIB). The CPS was jointly prepared with the International Financial Corporation (IFC), which in 
the early years of the CPS assumed a crisis response role, including support for banking system 
recapitalization and trade finance to local financial institutions.  
159. During its first two years, the CPS was centered on the DPL program. The DPL series 
was the main policy instrument for dialogue with the Government and helped strengthen the 
partnership with the IMF and EC. DPLs1-3 supported a comprehensive reform agenda, and the 
policy dialogue was supported by an array of technical assistance through a joint program of the 
Bank, IMF, and EC. AAA was instrumental in helping Romania articulate the DPL program and 
implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms for it. DPL-related AAA 
work included inter alia a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), Technical Notes 
on Medium-Term Budgeting and Public Sector Pay, and Policy Notes on the Education and 
Health Sectors.

160. The Bank’s program, in complement to IMF and EC support, assisted Romania to 
adjust macro imbalances, resume growth, and re-start the EU convergence process (to EU 
income and living standards), which was interrupted by the crisis (see Figure 1). The 
reforms supported by the DPL series and targeted AAA contributed substantially through 2010-
13 to the stabilization of the Romanian economy, including:  

 

 An orderly adjustment of the fiscal deficit (Romania exited the EC’s excessive deficit 
procedure as of June 21, 2013);  
Improvements in the budget process and discipline (multi-annual budgetary planning has 
started, number of budget rectifications reduced);  
 Financial resilience (no bank failures, stronger prudential regulations);   
 Structural reforms in public wages and employment conditions (unified public wage and 
better sustainability of the wage bill, more flexible Labor Code);  
 Improvements in spending in the education and health sectors (rationalization of sectors’ 
budgets through new per-pupil financing in education; mobilization of revenues from 
tobacco excises, increased use of compensated generic drugs, rationalization of the hospitals 
network);  
 Ongoing pension reforms (new pension law, progress towards equalizing the pensionable 
age for men and women, pension indexation aligned to international practice);  
 Adoption of convergence-related targets in judicial reform (new Civil and Criminal Codes 
and Procedural Codes implemented, criteria for optimization of Courts procedures adopted);  
 Agriculture reforms (training in all agriculture EU directives, reform of agricultural 
research, preparation of the National Rural Development Program for 2014-2020);  
 Diagnosis and recommendations for public administration reform (functional reviews of 
major ministries and government agencies, preparation of reform action plans, initiation of 
reforms in selected ministries).

161. A CPS Progress Report was prepared at the mid-point in 2011.14 It was informed by a 
survey and several sectoral roundtable consultations on the potential role of the Bank (in 
agriculture and rural development, climate change, education governance, health, the social 
sectors, public finance, and smart growth). The Progress Report concluded that the CPS pillars—

-58- 

 
                                                            
public sector reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion—remained 
relevant. With the financial crisis mitigated, the Progress Report turned the focus to furthering 
reforms in the areas covered by these pillars, emphasizing a “more European lens.” Three EU-
related themes contextualized Bank activities during the second half of the CPS period: (i) policy 
reforms to be undertaken by Romania to reap the benefits of EU membership; (ii) Romania’s 
need to modernize public institutions to enhance resource allocation and absorption of EU funds; 
and (iii) Bank complementarity to EU funding. The Progress Report followed on Romania’s 
adoption in April 2011 of its 2011-2013 National Reform Program for EU convergence, which 
outlined Romania’s strategic priorities and targets under the EU2020 strategy.15    
162. Romania’s convergence with the EU and absorption of EU funds became 
increasingly important over the CPS period. The Bank introduced the use of the 
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) instrument to respond to Romania’s demand for 
assistance in this area.16 RAS engagements fell into three groupings: 

 

 

Functional Reviews (FRs): A first package of RAS, prepared over 2010-2011, reviewed the 
performance of 13 ministries and government agencies and resulted in strategic and 
operational recommendations and helped to inform Romania’s National Reform Program 
2011-2013.   
 Modernizing the Public Administration: From FY13, a series of 14 follow-on RAS 
engagements are supporting the implementation of priority actions derived from Phase 1 
FRs.   
EU Funds Absorption:  In 2011, the Government requested Bank assistance to strengthen 
its capacity for absorption of EU structural funds.  An evolving package of 12 RASs has 
been supporting Romania to meet ex-ante conditionalities to enable Romania to access EU 
funds in the 2014-2020 programming period. (A pipeline of 10 additional RAS 
engagements is also focused on helping Romania absorb EU funds.) 
163. The portfolio structure evolved through the CPS period. Several sector investment 
projects closed. Lending during the second half of the CPS included €1 billion (US$1.33 billion) 
through a DPL Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL DDO, which will continue into the next CPS 
period). The DPL DDO agenda included: in public finance, improvements in budget process and 
tax administration; in energy, compliance with EU directives, market liberalization of gas and 
electricity, sales of state assets, and attraction of private investment, professional management in 
key state owned enterprises; in health, introduction of health technology assessments, revision of 
the package of health benefits, and implementation of the hospital rationalization strategy. A 
further €570 million (US$801 million) was provided through a results-based Social Assistance 
System Modernization Project (SASMP) and a Revenue Administration Modernization Project 
(RAMP). The Attachment provides a full list of Bank operations during the CPS period in Tables 
1 and 2, Bank AAA (including RAS) in Table 3, Bank/IMF/EC support packages in Table 4, and 
Bank-administered trust fund support in Table 5.  
164. Social protection for the poor and vulnerable and benefits for selected disadvantaged 
communities was improved with the support of DPLs1-3 and the Social Assistance 
Modernization Project (SASMP) and Social Inclusion Project (SIP). The effectiveness of the 
best performing social assistance schemes improved under the DPL series: Guaranteed Minimum 

15  See http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/nrp/nrp_romania_en.pdf and http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm.   
16  RASs are financed by the Government from EU funds available for Romania.  

-59- 

                                                            
Income coverage of the poorest increased 20 percent, beneficiaries were paid in full, and family 
allowances increased.  Building on this, the SASMP helped simplify the eligibility criteria for all 
means-tested programs; assets tests erroneously excluding genuinely poor families were 
removed; heating benefits were enhanced; and a new social assistance framework law was 
enacted. The SIP supported selected Roma communities: living standards, children’s access to 
education, and social inclusion have all improved. The Knowledge Economy Project helped 
bridge the digital divide in 255 “K-disadvantaged” communities. To mitigate the gradual 
increase in energy prices (gas and electricity), the Government put in place a calendar of 
mitigation measures using existing means-tested cash transfer programs.  
165. Achievements in transport and agriculture were less impressive and the impetus for 
energy sector reforms weakened. Road and rail infrastructure improvements (supported by the 
Transport Sector Projects) remained unfinished, including: restructuring of the road and railways 
administration (reclassification of the road network, changes to improve road management and 
financing, increasing road sector efficiency through privatization, redesign of the Railway 
Company business processes) and the piloting of performance based contracts for road 
maintenance. In energy, a large parallel market involving bilateral non-transparent agreements 
emerged in 2009-2010, full price liberalization was halted, and the energy strategy back pedaled.  
The impact and sustainability of irrigation sector reforms have been affected by numerous 
changes in the sector’s legislation and regulations. On the positive side, some of these sector 
challenges are now being addressed under specific Bank RAS engagements (transport and 
agriculture), or pursued as part of the EU’s third energy package and the DPL DDO.  
166. IFC played an active role throughout the CPS period. The original CPS envisioned a 
phased reduction in IFC investment. Due to risks associated with the European debt crisis and 
the economic downturn, IFC assumed a countercyclical role, with selective private sector 
investments. From FY09-13, IFC invested more than US$1 billion (US$798 million of its own 
funds and mobilized an additional US$242 million) allocated in 29 projects in various areas 
including the financial, renewable energy, agriculture and health sectors.    
PART II: ROMANIA’S PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING COUNTRY GOALS 

167. Firm fiscal discipline and prudent economic management have supported Romania’s 
recovery from recession.  After declining in 2009 and 2010, GDP increased 2.3 percent in 2011 
and 0.7 percent in 2012. The fiscal deficit was reduced from 4.8 percent in 2009 to 2.5 percent in 
2012. The current account deficit was similarly reduced from US$23.7 billion in 2009, to US$6.3 
billion in 2012. Government projects that the current account will be balanced by the end of 
2013.  
168. The accumulation of arrears (including at the local level) continues to be a challenge 
to fiscal discipline. Arrears incurred by key SOEs came down to 2 percent of GDP in 2012, but 
remain above the 1.5 percent target. The pace of progress in restructuring, introduction of 
professional management, and privatization remain inadequate and under surveillance by the 
international financial institutions (IFIs). Although specific measures were taken in 2012 to 
reduce local government arrears, progress has been less than expected. An insolvency law for 
local governments (GEO 46/2013) and stricter monitoring of the implementation of the Public 
Finance Law at the local level will attempt to address these issues.  

-60- 

169. Financial market conditions have improved, but pressure remains on asset quality. 
The banking sector remains strongly capitalized (15 percent in June 2013). Deleveraging has 
been moderate by regional standards. Risks from parent banks (80 percent of Romania’s banks 
are foreign-owned) could, however, impede the credit growth recovery. In close coordination 
with the IMF and EC, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) will continue careful sector 
supervision and will regularly conduct top-down and bottom up solvency stress tests as well as 
liquidity stress tests of the banking institutions. The share of non-performing loans rose to 
approximately 20 percent at end June 2013, but at 88 percent provisioning for bad loans is 
adequate by IFRS standards. The amendment of the insolvency code is ongoing and will be 
debated in Parliament. 
170. Regulatory reforms in energy and transport are in progress. Government has 
transposed the third EU energy directive into national law and has strengthened the 
independence of the energy regulator (Laws 123/2012, respectively 160/2012). Roadmaps for the 
gradual deregulation of gas and electricity prices by end 2015 and 2017, respectively (part of the 
EU third energy package) were approved by legislation in 2012 and are under implementation 
(under IFIs monitoring). The practice of below market bilateral contracts for electricity purchase 
was stopped. Progress has also been made with payment discipline among SOEs in the energy 
sector.17 In the transport sector, the Government undertook policy steps to improve the regulatory 
framework under which the railway company operates, 18 and the independence of the rail 
regulator was improved. Outstanding measures include better integration into the EU gas market 
(launching a trading platform for gas), improvements in the financial position and operating 
efficiency of SOEs,19 improvements in the corporate governance of state owned assets,20 and 
strengthening transport sector strategic capacity planning.    
171. Employment has recovered though more needs to be done to increase labor market 
participation of particular groups. Romania adopted a new Labor Code in 2011 that promotes 
labor market flexibility and reduces hiring and firing costs. Unemployment was brought down 
from 7.4 percent in 2011 to 6.7 percent in June 2013. However, youth unemployment remains 
high (23 percent), and Roma unemployment even higher (49 percent). 
172. Reforms in the education and health sectors have been implemented, but outcome 
and quality improvements are yet to be seen. A new national Education Law was adopted in 
2010.  It mandates a per-pupil financing system and supports school network rationalization. The 
classification of the universities has been improved and a management framework focusing on 
performance has been introduced. The Ministry of National Education is currently implementing 
a Reform Action Plan to improve its policy planning and managerial capacity. Reforms in health 
care were initiated, including the legal possibility to replace the hospital manager if a hospital is 
incurring arrears. The Ministry of Health provides information on both local and central 
government level hospitals budgets to the Ministry of Public finance, which provides a check on 
hospital over-spending. The Ministry of Health intends to implement additional healthcare 
reforms including improved ambulatory preventive care, revising the National Health Programs, 
defining the basic benefit package, and increasing the efficiency of health spending.  

17  SOE arrears have declined from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to around 2.2 percent at end-June 2013. 
18  Revised formula for calculation of subsidy for public services obligations, closure of unprofitable routes. 
19  Quarterly indicative targets for arrears, recourse to debt/equity swap, insolvency, liquidation to clean arrears. 
20 A new ownership guide has been developed by the Ministry of Transport, and new administrative plans of the railway 
companies and use of performance based contracts have been developed by the railway infrastructure company. 

-61- 

                                                            
173. In May 2013, the Government submitted Reform Action Plans by some ministries 
and government agencies21 based primarily on recommendations from the FRs. This was an 
important step towards deepening the pace of public administration reform. However, 
administrative capacity remains a core concern in Romania as improvements will take time to 
realize. Improving the efficiency and independence of the judiciary and combatting corruption in 
justice and public procurement is progressing slowly and ranks high on the reform agenda.  
174. Quicker absorption of EU funds would contribute to higher growth and more job 
creation.  Romania has the lowest rate of funds absorption in the EU with just 20 percent (€5.53 
billion) absorbed of the €20 billion in total structural, cohesion, and agricultural funding 
available to it under the EU 2007-13 budget period. Romania has obtained €22 billion (US$29 
billion) in structural funds from the EU budget for the 2014-2020 period and will also receive 
€17.5 billion in funds for agriculture over 2014-20 under the Common Agricultural Policy 
(CAP), up from €13.8 billion over 2007-13. To improve absorption rates (at 24.97 percent for 
January-October 2013), the Government is currently restructuring the various managing 
authorities. 

PART III: ACHIEVEMENT OF CPS OUTCOMES 

175. As shown in Annex 1, more than three-quarters of the CPS outcomes were fully 
achieved, while the remainder were partially achieved or in progress. Progress on milestones 
linked directly to Bank-supported activities was high (84 percent achieved). Good performing 
sectors included: public financial management, financial sector, competition, knowledge 
economy, education, and health (with CPS targets reaching above 90 percent). There has been 
progress in the remaining sectors, but in some cases the achievement of outcomes was delayed 
by implementation bottlenecks.  Results by pillar are highlighted below and more details are 
included in Annex 1. 
CPS Pillar 1: Public Sector Reforms 
176. Romania’s fiscal consolidation has been impressive. A more disciplined budget process 
and limits on the public sector wage bill have contributed to this outcome as has a new medium 
term budget framework (MTEF 2012-2014) and a new Fiscal Responsibility Law (69/2010). The 
Fiscal Responsibility Law includes binding aggregate expenditure ceilings and strict rules for 
their oversight by a newly constituted Fiscal Council established in 2010. A new Framework 
Unitary Pay Law established tighter control of arbitrary bonuses of public servants. As a 
consequence, growth in the public wage bill was brought down from 9.4 percent in 2009 to 6.9 
percent of GDP in 2012 and base salaries now comprise at least 70 percent of total 
compensation. All these measures were supported by the DPL series as well as the DPL DDO. 
As a result, the budget deficit has been brought to 2.5 percent and Romania exited the EU’s 
excessive deficit procedure in June 2013.   
177. Medium-term budgeting has made similar progress. Regulatory measures have 
translated into a more credible medium term fiscal plan based on binding expenditure limits and 
fiscal risk analysis; a lower variance between the approved and actual budget expenditures 
(reduced from 27 percent in 2008 to less than 10 percent in 2012); and a smaller number of

yearly budget rectifications. The RAMP Project has set the basis for future improvements in 
Romania’s tax administration system. 
178. Progress on governance and judicial reform has been slower. The Bank supported 
improvements in efficiency, accountability, and professionalism of the judiciary via technical 
work for the optimization of court procedures and support for the development of quality 
management systems at the Ministry of Justice and Superior Council of Magistracy. Learning 
plans were also developed for the National Institute of Magistracy and the National Securities 
Commission under the Judicial Reform Project (JRP). The JRP was restructured in 2010 to 
accommodate Government need to revise and prepare for enforcement of the new Civil Code and 
Criminal Codes.  As the JRP implementation pace was slow, measurable improvements in 
efficiency and quality in the judiciary and the full implementation of the four codes will be 
finalized beyond the CPS time line.   
179. More efficient spending in the education and health sectors has reinforced sound 
public financial management. In the education sector, the introduction of per capita financing, 
supported by the DPL series, replaced budget allocation by inputs (teachers and schools) and 
created room for schools and staff rationalization which, along with the optimization of class 
sizes, reduced the administrative costs and enabled the programing of additional funds for quality 
changes in the system, especially teacher training.  Public health reforms were introduced that 
increased the use of generic drugs, set forth conditions for the reimbursement of drugs in the 
basic health package, and rationalized the number of hospitals via the implementation of a 
National Hospital Master Plan. Potential savings of over €100 million in the health budget over 
the medium term are projected, while budget allocations for health prevention and promotion 
programs will be gradually increased.  
CPS Pillar 2: Growth and Competitiveness 
180. Romania has stabilized its economy following the crisis. The global financial crisis 
showed that expansionary fiscal policy combined with credit growth was pro-cyclical and 
detrimental to long-term growth. With the support of the Bank and other IFIs, Government 
responded with a macroeconomic stabilization plan that included sharp fiscal consolidation, 
depreciation of exchange rate leading to export recovery, curtailing of credit, and several 
measures aimed at stabilizing the banking sector.  More recently, the Government has re-
launched reforms in the energy and SOE sectors. The CPS targeted all these areas, especially 
through the DPL DDO and Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), which focused on the 
growth agenda, including the performance of Romania’s SOEs, competition and the regulatory 
environment, labor and skills, energy, transport, and agriculture.  
181. The banking sector has been stabilized with support from the Bank Group, the EU, 
and the IMF. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) undertaken in December 2008 
highlighted the vulnerability of the financial sector to deleveraging and contagion risks 
(Romania’s banking sector is largely foreign-owned). The Bank supported the elaboration of the 
Government’s Strategic Action Plan for potential interventions from the NBR and the Ministry 
of Public Finance to sustain financial sector stability, developed under DPL1. Stress tests were 
conducted covering 90 percent of system assets based on which capital increases were sought to 
ensure that the capital adequacy ratio was above 10 percent. The NBR also prepared, with Bank 

-63- 

analytical support, Internal Guidelines for the implementation of Basel II,22 supported by DPL2. 
Initiatives that infringed on the independence of the Central Bank and non-bank financial 
regulators were reversed with the support of DPL3. Bank-led analytical work under the DPL 
series supported the Ministry of Justice, the NBR, and the Ministry of Public Finance to prepare 
guidelines for corporate debt restructuring and mortgage debt restructuring, with inputs from the 
Banking Association, the Consumer Protection Agency, and from non-Bank Associations. The 
guidelines were endorsed and published by the Romanian authorities. IFC focused its efforts on 
countercyclical support to existing banking sector clients by providing a large spectrum of 
products, including supporting banks with long term finance to address liquidity concerns, 
mezzanine and equity capital to strengthen capitalization, risk sharing facilities, and trade finance 
lines to sustain funding to vulnerable businesses. IFC provided equity and quasi-equity 
instruments to Banca Transilvania and ProCredit Bank.   
182. Creating a more conducive business environment remains a work in progress. 
Romania ranked 72 in Doing Business 2013 and 73 in Doing Business 2014. Since 2010, positive 
changes in the starting a business, enforcing contracts, paying taxes, and resolving insolvency 
areas have been made. However, more work is needed in areas such as getting electricity, getting 
credit, registering property, dealing with construction permits, and protecting investors. Romania 
adopted a new Competition Law in 2011 and, with Bank analytical support, continues the 
adjustment of the competition legal framework more in line with the EU model. The Bank-
supported Mine Closure Project resulted in the reduction of subsidies in the mining sector from 
US$220 million in 2006 to US$54 million in 2012. The introduction of e-filing of tax returns 
under the DPL DDO agenda has the potential to increase e-government services in tax payments, 
which will reduce compliance costs for firms, though a recent IMF mission noted that 
implementation issues are still to be addressed. To support capital market development, IFC 
participated as the largest investor with US$37 million investment in UniCredit Tiriac, the 
bank’s first bond issue. This was the largest local currency bond issue ever on the Bucharest 
Stock Exchange and the first local currency bond issued by a financial institution in Romania.  
183. 
IFC played a significant role in creating a larger and more dynamic private sector. 
As part of its support to the small and medium enterprise (SME), agribusiness, and health 
sectors, IFC provided targeted debt financing to local financial institutions. IFC also structured 
several financial sector projects, including a US$70 million loan to Banca Comercială Română 
and a US$13 million loan to ATE Bank in FY09, and US$17 million loan to Agricover Credit 
IFN in FY12 for on-lending to agribusiness. IFC supported Banca Transilvania to further 
develop its healthcare financing division through a US$71 million loan in FY10.  
184. 
In FY12, IFC partnered with Garanti Bank for on-lending to SMEs, with a special loan 
tranche for SMEs owned by women entrepreneurs. In addition, IFC provided much-needed term 
local currency debt and granted a US$10 million loan to Patria Credit, the largest microfinance 
institution in Romania. IFC’s  total  guarantees of US$143 million, issued under the trade finance 
lines to Bancpost, Garanti Bank, Banca Transilvania and Banca Romaneasca, allowed these 
banks to increase their trade finance offerings and mobilize pre-export and import financing for 
companies active in key job-creating sectors, including in agribusiness.  

22 Basel II Banking Sector International Regulatory Standards, are anchored by three main pillars: minimum capital requirements, 
supervisory review (in addition to capital requirements to determine the soundness of internal processes for capital adequacy 
assessment, and market discipline (disclosure) 

-64- 

                                                            
185. 
In the corporate sector, IFC provided a US$96 million equivalent loan to Kaufland 
Romania and a US$67 million loan to Lidl Romania to support the opening of hypermarkets 
mainly in small and remote towns, creating much needed employment. The expansion of 
MedLife, the leading player in the Romanian private health care market and a unique provider of 
integrated medical services for corporate clients and individuals, was possible due to IFC A/B 
loans of US$69 million. In FY11 and FY12, IFC raised US$135 million to develop a 228 
megawatt wind power park in Romania. Support to the infrastructure sector was sustained 
through a US$23 million equity investment in TTS, the leading river transport company.  
186. Education remains a priority for the Government and is seen as the main 
instrument to increase labor market participation and productivity. Bank analytical work23 
completed in 2011 resulted in Reform Action Plans currently under implementation by the 
Ministry of National Education. The reforms focus on enhancing the Ministry’s administrative 
capacity; developing management and leadership skills; establishing a system for M&E and 
reporting on organizational performance; and the design and delivery of training programs. More 
recent analytical work 24 assessed specific education challenges that affect the labor market 
functioning—early school leaving, quality of education provision particularly at the tertiary 
level, triggers of endemic skills shortages, labor training and education’s contribution to 
promoting entrepreneurship—and provided policy-based recommendations. An education sub-
component of the Knowledge Economy Project helped integrate ICT into schools by improving 
the digital competencies of teachers and students.  
187. Despite considerable EU resources, a large discrepancy remains between Romania’s 
agriculture potential and its contribution to growth and poverty reduction. Almost half the 
population and more than two-thirds of the poor live in rural areas. Yields in agriculture are half 
that of the EU average. Land tenure remains unsecured (systematic land registration still in pilot 
stage), and rural infrastructure is only now emerging. Given Romania’s land availability and 
moderate climate, a productive rural, non-farm economy is key to employment and poverty 
alleviation in Romania. In addition, major grant financing from the EU is available to the sector. 
During the 2007-13 period, Romania received a total of €13.8 billion through the European 
Agriculture Guarantee Funds (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural 
Development (EAFRD). In May 2013, the EC-reported absorption rate for the EAFRD was 48.6 
percent, higher than Romania’s absorption of EU structural funds, but substantially below the 
EU-27 average of 62.7 percent.  
188. Bank Group financed projects in agriculture have met with mixed results.  Projects 
under the CPS included: 

 Modernizing Agriculture Knowledge 
Information Systems 
(MAKIS): Supported 
agricultural research reform, improved production technologies, and institutional reforms. 
 Complementing EU Support for Agriculture Restructuring (CESAR): provided socio-
economic guidance to farmers, and piloted systematic land registration, human resources 
policies, and ICT. 
Irrigation Reform Project: supported reforms and rehabilitation interventions in the 
irrigation sector. 



 
IFC Loan: IFC loan of US$100 million to financial institutions for on-lending to farmers 
and private agribusinesses.  
189. Mixed results included:   

 The former irrigation company was restructured and a new law on land reclamation was 
passed. A new system for tariffs setting allowed the transition from highly subsidized to 
full cost recovery. Associative structures of users were developed, with a view to assume 
the management of the irrigation schemes and tariffs negotiations (Federations of Water 
Users Associations) and ownership over the tertiary irrigation infrastructure. However, 
the small farmer groups were not well prepared to assume their role and thus adversely 
impacted project achievements.25 Frequent changes in ministry leadership also weakened 
commitment to the reform agenda.   
 A new law on agricultural research provided financing and enabled the development and 
implementation of reform programs sector-wide. Four national research institutes 
developed and implemented the reform agenda and are now operating at EU standards.    
 Socio-economic guidance capacity was increased by the establishment of training centers 
and a nation-wide distribution network (National Agency for Agriculture Consultancy). 
A large number of experts and farmers were trained. However, the lack of a long-term 
business model raises sustainability concerns. 
 The CESAR Project developed procedures for systematic land registration in a 
consultative manner considering the rights of land owners and the needs of vulnerable 
populations. 
190. At mid-term, the MAKIS and CESAR Projects were restructured to support 
convergence to EU standards and accommodate EU priorities. The third component of 
MAKIS was reshaped to include the review and upgrade of the Integrated Administration and 
Control System (IACS) to become fully EU compliant and to ensure the timely provision of EU 
agriculture support funds (CAP payments). The third component of CESAR was re-designated to 
address selected issues signaled by a FR of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development 
including: (a) development of an agriculture and rural development sector strategy; (b) 
development and implementation of a strategic plan for restructuring the sector administration; 
and (c) implementation of a management information system. Additional RAS engagements 
(Strengthening Agri-Food Sector Strategy Formulation, Strategic Planning for Agricultural 
Administration, Implementation of an Internal Management System, Developing an Integrated 
Financial Management System) have been started. 
191. The energy sector witnessed limited progress during the CPS, but lately reforms 
have picked up. To introduce EU-wide market principles in the energy sector, the EU adopted 
standard practices (“packages”) to liberalize the energy market. The third package separated 
competitive from monopoly activities and allowed energy to be traded freely across borders. The 
energy debate in Romania since 2010 proposed to consolidate the sector into two energy 
champions and cross-subsidize costly products (coal-generated electricity) with more efficient 
ones (hydro-generated electricity), but these proposals were not put in place.  In addition, a 
system of bilateral contracts in electricity and regulated prices in both electricity and gas resulted 

25 The two project schemes where small farmers predominate showed very low economic rates of return (2.8 percent and 9.6 percent per 
respective scheme). The other three irrigation schemes where medium and large farms dominate show economic rates of return between 20 
percent and 32 percent.

in losses and arrears incurred by energy SOEs that impacted fiscal stability, but significant 
improvement measures has been undertaken  in this respect. 
192. The Bank supported the energy sector reform agenda with analytical work and 
budget support operations. With the Bank’s support, Government embarked on an agreed 
energy reform agenda supported by the DPL DDO. The Bank also completed a FR of the sector 
and a sector policy note in 2013. The priorities identified and recognized by the Government 
called for: (a) legal and regulatory reforms in the sector; (b) safety net to protect the poorest 
households from tariff increases; (c) transparent and competitive contracting by SOEs; (d) 
enhancing the commercial and payment discipline; (e) improving the corporate governance; (f) 
attracting private sector participation in the various SOEs operating in the sector; and (g) 
promoting green energy. Reforms will continue into the next CPS period, but some progress is 
already visible:  

 A new Electricity and Gas Law 123 became effective in July 2012 and the Law 160/2012 
introducing the financial and corporate independence of ANRE, the energy sector 
regulator, was adopted by the Parliament and promulgated by the President in October 
2012.  
 Electricity and Gas Road Maps with timetables for phasing out regulated prices and 
liberalizing electricity and gas markets were issued and their implementation is in 
progress. 
 Hidroelectrica, the main hydro energy producer, most affected by price distortion, 
completed its insolvency procedure, including cancellation of below market contracts and 
renegotiation of contracts with energy-intensive industrial clients, with significant price 
increases, and was back on the market briefly but has since returned to insolvency. 
193. During the CPS period, IFC supported private green energy producers by financing one 
of the first wind power parks in Romania—alongside EBRD, IFC mobilized US$135 million for 
the Cernavoda and Pestera Projects. 
194. Romania’s road and railway networks remain under-developed. Two transport 
projects attempted to rehabilitate and modernize transport infrastructure to improve safety and 
relieve traffic congestion in or around large cities. Bank support also targeted a reclassification 
of the road network and changes in road management and privatization goals.  In the rail sector, 
the completion of the state railway companies’ restructuring, improving productivity, and 
moving to full cost recovery were Government goals supported by the Bank. However, 
indecision about reforms, frequent changes at higher management levels, massive floods (which 
temporarily switched Bank assistance to emergency repairs to infrastructure), budget constraints, 
and the impact of crisis all conspired to slow down progress in the reform agenda.  The two 
transport projects closed without delivering the expected institutional reforms.  
195. However, transport sector reforms are ongoing with Bank support. In later CPS 
years, the Government and the Bank resumed a strategic dialogue in the transport sector via FRs 
of the sector’s institutional settings. Reform Action Plans were developed based on the 
recommendations of the FRs and sector reforms have been initiated with Bank support, 26 
including strengthening the ministry’s strategic planning capacity, corporate governance of 
SOEs, cost recovery for infrastructure, and capacity to undertake public-private partnerships.

The performance of transport SOEs is generally regarded as one of the main constraints in the 
sector and with Bank support the Ministry introduced a transparent method for appointing 
professional boards of directors to these companies and developed a guide for SOE corporate 
governance that has now been proposed as a model for SOEs in the rest of the country. Critically 
the work on strategic planning also helped to focus company business plans around an agreed set 
of priorities. There is still much to do to improve consistent implementation of these issues but at 
least there is now a strong framework going forward.   
CPS Pillar 3: Social and Spatial Inclusion 
196. Roma integration continues to be a key issue for Romania. New survey data show that 
the vast majority of Roma in Romania (74 percent) continue to live in poverty;27 83 percent of 
Roma households are reported not having a toilet or bathroom indoors; and only 10 percent of 
Roma aged 20-24 years old have completed upper secondary education.  The Social Inclusion 
Project (SIP) included Roma dedicated sub-components, which were implemented by the 
Romanian Social Development Fund. The small SIP sub-projects implemented in a participatory 
manner provided the targeted Roma communities’ with access to rural infrastructure, roads, and 
water supply. More importantly, over 1,200 meetings between Roma and the local authorities in 
2009-2013 helped mainstream the Roma into community-driven initiates.  Recent analytical 
work28 supports the Government in developing national policies and identifying cost-effective 
programs 
to promote 
the 
integration of Roma by providing diagnostics and policy 
recommendations in key areas of poverty and social safety nets, employment, education, 
housing, health, anti-discrimination, institutional mechanisms for effective local service delivery, 
and use of EU instruments.  
197. Reforms in social assistance were supported by the DPL series as well as the 
SASMP.  In the early years, the DPL series addressed the targeting of family benefits and the 
under-funding of the Guaranteed Minimum Income program and gaps in its administration 
(which were excluding eligible beneficiaries from benefits). At mid-point, Government adopted 
a more strategic approach to support social assistance reforms by adding an innovative results-
based project, the SASMP (US$710 million, FY11), to the portfolio. This operation disburses 
against the achievement of 20 indicators. However, the innovative nature of the instrument and 
the legal steps required for loan approval caused a slow start to the program. It has since taken 
off and the SASMP has been restructured and extended. SASMP achievements so far include 
simplification of the eligibility criteria for all means-tested programs, removal of assets tests 
erroneously excluding genuinely poor families, enhancement of heating benefits, and the 
enactment of a new social assistance framework law (2011).  
198. The transparency of the pension system has been improved with Bank support 
through a RAS. A new Pension Law (2010) provided a framework for aligning the indexation 
of pensions to international practice, consolidating and aligning special pensions (military and 
security retirees) with the general system, and eliminating unwarranted invalidity pensions 
following a careful review of the eligibility for disability pension and enforcement of stricter 
criteria.  
199. Government measures supported by the Bank helped improve health and 
rationalize sector expenditures. The Health Adaptable Program Loan helped increase access to 

27 Risk of Poverty: percent with equivalized household incomes below 60 percent of national median (UNDP/WB/EC data 2011).

and improve the quality of maternal, rural, and emergency health care services, prepare 
Romania’s Primary Health Care Strategy (2011), and review the content and listing processes for 
the Romanian basic package of health services and technologies (2011). The DPL series and the 
DPL DDO agendas supported reforms to improve the fiscal sustainability of the health sector 
through the revision of the list of compensated drugs (2010), implementation of the National 
Hospital Rationalization Strategy (2010), creating the institutional framework to implement 
Health Technology Assessment procedures, and introduction of co-payment. Close coordination 
and collaboration with the EIB and other partners helped ensure the harmonization of 
interventions and the efficient use of funds. IFC supported private sector investments in the 
health sector by lending to private health care providers, such as Medlife.   
PART IV:  WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

CPS Program Design  
200. The CPS had the dual objective of mitigating the effects of the financial crisis and 
broadening reforms for sustainable growth and social cohesion. The CPS’s flexible approach 
was tested and proved successful as it allowed the Bank to re-focus at midterm, moving from the 
immediate crisis response to a longer-term perspective that supported Romania’s EU 
convergence priorities. As a byproduct of the strong collaboration with the Government and the 
EC, the Bank assumed the role of a strategic adviser to the Government over the CPS period.  
201. The CPS was fully aligned with Romania’s strategic framework and evolving 
priorities. Earlier CPS interventions were guided by the Government’s EU Convergence 
Program 2009-2013, 29 which spelled out the need to stabilize the economy (as the crisis 
unfolded) through a significant reduction of the fiscal and external deficits; improve medium-
term predictability and performance of fiscal policy; and stabilize and strengthen the financial 
sector. Within this context, the Bank undertook a number of analytical reports, including sectoral 
policy briefs, an assessment of the impact of the economic crisis on poverty, the PEIR, an FSAP, 
and a Civil Service pay diagnosis.  The FY09-11 DPL series drew on this strong analytical base 
and was the main driver of the dialogue.  
202. Since 2010, the Bank repositioned itself to support Romania’s longer-term EU 
convergence goals in line with the National Reform Program and EU priorities.  Since 2010, 
Romania’s focus has been on implementing the EC recommendations under the EU2020 strategy 
to foster convergence with EU standards and living conditions. Romania’s focus was on inter 
alia continuing 
the fiscal consolidation process; addressing capacity gaps 
in public 
administration to accelerate EU funds absorption; reforming the judiciary; and increasing the 
efficiency of the state-owned sector, with mitigation of adverse impacts on the poor. 
Accordingly, the CPS Progress Report (2011) moved the Bank’s activity toward providing 
technical support for public administration reforms and strengthening of Romania’s capacity for 
EU funds absorption.   

29 The Government Convergence Program covers a four year period and is updated annually. It is complemented by Annual 
Government Programs, Annual Reform Programs, and sector strategies. Since 2007, Romania has benefited from the European 
Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds, which amount to about €17.2 billion for all priorities for the period 2007-2013. In addition 
to the GCP, Romania has a National Strategic Reference Framework that maps out Romania‘s plan for investing structural funds, 
which are disbursed through Sectoral Operational Programs. In total, there are seven Sectoral Operational Programs, each 
structured around several priority axes plus a National Rural Development Plan.  

-69- 

                                                            
203. This transition was made possible by the introduction and use of the RAS 
instrument. The RAS program, which began with the FRs, was formalized through a 
Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Government in early 2012. In addition, two 
innovative lending operations were added:  the results-based SASMP (US$710 million) to 
support improved targeting of benefits and harmonization and simplification in social assistance 
(in line with the sector Reform Program); and the DPL DDO (US$1.33 billion), which supported 
an agenda focused on fiscal consolidation, energy sector compliance with the EU energy policy 
and energy SOE governance issues, and health sector reforms. A Health Sector Reform operation 
(US$336 million) was not concluded within the CPS period—it is under preparation.  
204. The participatory process and transparency fostered through the CPS process is 
notable. The Government now regularly posts new legislative and policy initiatives on the 
ministries’ web sites for consultations and feedback. In addition, in specific cases stakeholders 
with special interests in respective reforms were invited by the Government for consultations 
(i.e., trade unions and employers’ associations were called to participate in the elaboration of 
public pay reforms; public debates and consultations with the teaching staff and school 
inspectors preceded education reforms/changes of the education law; extensive consultations of 
professional associations and local public administration preceded the adoption of new strategies 
and reforms). 
205. 
In general, the CPS results framework provided a useful structure for measuring 
CPS progress and performance. The results framework included clearly defined outcomes and 
milestones for each of the three main pillars, revised in the CPS Progress Report as necessary in 
line with the refocused approach. The outcomes and milestones identified in the CPS results 
matrix were drawn from the projects’ development objectives across the portfolio and were 
therefore carefully specified and generally relevant in terms of the areas of influence of Bank 
activities.   
CPS Implementation 
206. Overall portfolio performance improved over 2009-2013, but individual project 
performance was uneven. At CPS closing (June 2013) Romania’s lending portfolio (US$2.05 
billion) was the third largest in ECA (after Turkey, US$4.4 billion, and Kazakhstan, US$3.6 
billion).  Across the CPS period, the realism rate stood at 100 percent, proactivity improved over 
2010-1330 (with the proactivity index broadly at 100 percent), and portfolio riskiness decreasing 
from 35.9 percent commitments at risk to 5.2 percent. The average disbursement rate for projects 
over FY10-13 was 23 percent, however a few projects—CESAR, Integrated Nutrient Pollution 
Control Project (INPCP), JRP, Knowledge Economy, and SIP—were at times listed as slow 
disbursing projects having disbursed less than 40 percent in a five-year life span. The main 
causes of slow disbursement were: (a) a long approval cycle of investments in Romania (JRP, 
SIP); (b) changes to ministries’ upper management and in implementing agencies affiliation 
(CESAR, INPCP); (c) change in the technical approach; and (d) severe budget constraints 
(CESAR, JRP, Knowledge Economy). Some of the projects (CESAR, Knowledge Economy) had 
to be restructured with significant cancellation of funds. Other projects (INPCP, JRP, SIP), 
monitored under timed action plans, overcame critical problems and improved performance.  

30 Proactivity Index increased from 33 percent in 2009 to 100 percent over 2010-2014. The Proactivity Index in June 2013 dipped temporarily to 
50 percent because one project, CESAR, completed its restructuring on June 26, 2013 in slightly more than the 12 months allowed for proactivity 
action (CESAR was downgraded as of June 7, 2012).   

-70- 

                                                            
207. The lending pipeline was largely delivered as anticipated changing the portfolio 
structure over the CPS period. During the CPS period, six new operations were delivered: 
DPLs1-3, the DPL DDO, the SASMP, and RAMP. The additions represent some 88 percent of 
CPS lending commitments. As 14 operations closed in the same period, the total number of 
projects in the portfolio was halved while the commitment level was sustained by larger loan 
sizes. The portfolio structure evolved through the CPS period, from largely sector investment 
loans to 65 percent DPLs, 21 percent results based financing, and 14 percent sector investment 
loans. The two most prominent themes in the portfolio became social assistance reform (28.3 
percent) and human development (20.7 percent).    
208. During the CPS period, Romania’s knowledge portfolio increased four-fold as the 
Bank repositioned itself as a strategic adviser to the Government. By June 2013, the 
knowledge portfolio counted 26 RAS engagements in various stages of approval.  Contracts 
worth US$25 million were signed (see Table 3 for a full list of AAA, including RAS). Given that 
RAS engagements largely address EC-related development issues, progress on RAS activities is 
monitored jointly with the Government and the EC. 
209. Over the CPS period, a strong partnership with a broad range of stakeholders 
became the norm. Civil society, academia, think thanks, and representatives of the private 
sector were consulted through the preparation of many new projects, in particular the DPLs, the 
DPL DDO, and the SASMP. The CEM findings and recommendations were discussed in several 
participatory conferences. A Social Accountability Citizens Report Card technical assistance 
supported extensive consultations with professionals and the civil society.  

PART V:  LESSONS LEARNED 

210. General lessons include: 

 Lesson 1: The Bank is a trusted partner of Romania and an important complement 
to the EC. Due to a deep understanding of the structural reform agenda the Bank, in 
close coordination with the IMF and EC, was a trusted partner that supported Romania in 
weathering the financial crisis and then transitioned to strategic adviser in supporting 
Romania to meet longer-term development objectives under its EU Convergence 
Program and EU2020 national commitments. It is clear that the Bank has a role to play in 
helping newer EU members build the capacity and address institutional and social issues 
necessary to achieve EU living and other standards. The Bank’s partnership with 
Romania will continue to evolve under the next CPS period.     
 Lesson 2: Multi-tranche development policy operations allowed the Bank to 
contribute to a coordinated program of macro stabilization with the IMF and EC 
while allowing for the pursuit of needed structural reforms. The DPL1 program 
development objective supported government reforms in fiscal and public administration 
management, social protection, and the financial sector. The DPL1 Program Document 
identified 21 actions, six of which were defined as prior actions and the rest as triggers 
for DPL2 and DPL3. Most of the original prior actions and triggers were sustained 
through the series, and virtually all were fulfilled. The structural measures were adopted 
by the EC in its assessment of Romania’s 2013 National Reform Program and 
Convergence Program 2012-2016.  

-71- 

 Lesson 3: The RAS instrument proved effective in taking the Bank’s partnership 
with Romania to the next level. As an EU member, Romania has access to considerable 
grant financing from EU sources. In the next programing period, 2014-2020, funds worth 
€40 billion31 will be available to Romania, therefore reducing reliance on Bank financing. 
At the same time, demand-driven technical assistance supplied through the RAS program 
has proved an effective instrument for responding to the country’s considerable needs to 
implement reforms, meet development challenges, and enhance its capacity to converge 
to EU standards. During the next CPS period, the evolution from lender to technical 
adviser and knowledge broker is expected to continue.  
 Lesson 4: The CPS process can be used to promote greater transparency and more 
inclusive consultation. The CPS was effective in bringing together the Government and 
civil society partners, business sector and private non-commercial actors. However, there 
is room for further improvement. Greater attention should be given to the poorest, under-
served population, especially the Roma. In view of the frequent turnover of high-level 
government staff, increased attention by the Bank to the political opposition and other 
parliamentary groups would also provide valuable insights, awareness, and ownership of 
Bank support over a broader spectrum of stakeholders.  
211. Specific lessons include: 

 Short-term challenges versus long-term development: More effort should be invested 
by the Government and the Bank to address the tensions between short-term challenges 
(budget deficit levels) and longer-term targets (implementation of reforms, infrastructure 
investments). 
 Mitigating governance shortcomings: The Bank should recognize the risks generated 
by governance shortcomings (frequent changes in line ministries’ management, changing 
priorities as higher management changes, poor cross coordination, minimal 
accountability to sustainability) and identify more effective mitigation measures from the 
outset. For instance early briefing for incoming officials and work with permanent staff 
of the relevant ministries where appropriate to provide continuity to the program. 
 Need for strengthened M&E: A strengthened M&E framework at government level and 
the culture of progressive assessment and reporting of results are still lacking and thus 
capacity building in this area is key. 
 Addressing shifting government priorities: Although the Government engaged closely 
during project preparation, certain projects (e.g., CESAR, JRP, Knowledge Economy) 
faced insufficient budgetary allocation during the implementation period. As projects did 
not get their budgetary allocation they were forced to slow down or in some cases halt 
their implementation due to lack of counterpart funding. This was partly due to the 
scarcity of budget resources and need to observe agreed deficit targets. There is a need to 
proactively manage the portfolio in such a situation with timely restructurings, 
cancelations and closures of projects that no longer have the support of the Ministry of 
Finance.

RESULTS AREAS AND OUTCOMES 
TO WHICH THE CPS IS CONTRIBUTING 

MILESTONES 
CAS PILLAR 1: PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM 

WBG INSTRUMENTS 

GOALS: To improve the accountability and responsiveness of the public administration and to enhance predictability and efficiency in public resource management. 
Issues and Obstacles as identified in 2009:  Pro-cyclical fiscal policies and weak fiscal management have led to serious macroeconomic vulnerabilities.  The budget process lacks predictability and 
transparency, as well as weak prioritization of public investment.  Introduction of an MTEF will require capacity and support to both plan on a multi-year horizon and to link budget with outcomes.  Public sector 
wages have more than doubled since 2005 contributing to pro-cyclical policies, but without adequately rewarding performance or productivity.  Governance is weak and monitored by the EU bi-annually.  The 
court system has a large back-log of cases.   
Country Objective: Reduce fiscal vulnerabilities by restoring budget discipline, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures, and improved resource mobilization. 

1.1  PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 

Outcome 1.1.1: Medium Term Expenditure Framework operational by 
2012 and beyond  

 

Indicator (revised): Reduction in variance between main aggregate 
ceiling (Wage, Goods & Services, Capital) approved by Parliament in 
the MTEF (2011-13) and the actual expenditures. Baseline (2008): 
27% variance for three largest economic classes (Wage, Goods 
&Services, Capital) Target: deviation ≤ 17% 
Achieved: variance down to 10% in 2010 and significantly below 
in 2011, 2012.32 

Outcome 1.1.2: Sustainable growth in public wage bill 

 

Indicator: Annual expenditure for personnel (2011-13) consistent 
with the limits approved in MTEFs and does not increase as a share of 
GDP above expected 2009 level. Baseline: 9.4% in 2009   
Achieved: wage bill at 8.3% of GDP in 2010 and 6.9% in 2012.  

 

 

Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) 69/2010 approved & enacted  
Achieved: 2010.

Parliament with three-years ceilings for major spending 
ministries  
Achieved: 2011 to date. 

 

Fiscal Strategy 2011-13 approved by Government  
Achieved: September 2010 

 Wage bill increases below inflation rate Achieved: increase in 
2010 and 2011 was negative vs. an average inflation rate of 
6.1% in 2010 and 5.8% in 2011. Since 2012, fiscal 
adjustment has allowed progressive restoration of the wage 
bill.  

 Completed:   
 
Policy Briefs (FY09) 
 
PEIR Updates focused on opportunities for fiscal 
savings and efficiency gains in major expenditure 
categories, starting with education and  health (FY09-

Summary of multi-year public investment program annexed to 
2010-2011 budget  
Achieved: planned spending for major capital projects set 
out in 2012 Budget. 
Country Objective (revised to include Reform of PA): improve the organizational effectiveness and transparency of the public administration at central and local levels; and improve the public pay system to 
enhance transparency and predictability, motivate performance among public sector employees, attract and retain critical skills. 

 

32 For 2011: variance below 1.3%. For 2012 variance vs. MTEF below 10% as follows:  wage bill of consolidated budget below 1.2%; wage bill of state budget below 1%;  goods and services of state budget 
below 9%; capital expenses below 1% .

1.2 PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (PA) REFORM 

Outcome 1.2.1 (new): Initiation by GoR of the RO PA Reform – approval 
of Reform Action Plans for selected PA institutions  
Achieved: 12 Functional Reviews completed for ministries and 
agencies selected for Phases 1 and 2, and Reform Action Plans (based 
on recommendations in the Functional Reviews) submitted to the EC 

Outcome 1.2.2 (new):  Progress in enacting and implementing the 
strategies/tools/ procedures/etc. in the Reform Action Plans. 

 

Indicator Favorable assessment by EC of Romania’s progress in 
improving the organizational effectiveness and transparency of its 
Public Administration (EC Opinion on the National Reform Plan  and 
progress under the Memorandum of Understanding with EU)  
Partially Achieved: Reform Action Plans   submitted by GoR to 
the EC and selected reform measures are under implementation 
with Bank support. EC has positively acknowledged the role of 
the Bank in the Functional Reviews and Reform Action Plans. EC 
review of Romania’s National Reform Plan 2012/2013 took stock 
of the Functional Reviews and Reform Action Plans, noting that 
PA capacity remains a core issue.  This is a long-term institutional 
development agenda, and the Bank continues to support GoR in 
this area.

administration) 

 

Indicator: Reduction in aggregate allowances and bonuses and limit 
amount for any individual  Baseline: over 30% of total public

CAS PILLAR 2: GROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS 

GOALS:  in the short-run, put in place crisis-management measures in the financial sector; and in the medium-term, establish the building blocks for sustainable convergence to EU-average living standards 
through improved business environment, enhanced skills, better infrastructure and more efficient agriculture. 
Issues and Obstacles as identified in 2009:  The crisis has revealed weaknesses in financial sector supervision across the region, new, best practices will need to be adopted to strengthen the system.  A recovery 
in growth will depend both on recovery in key trading partners and on the strength of Romania’s own reforms and policies.  All countries are seeking to emerge from the crisis in a strong position, so competition 
will be strong.  Romania lags international competitors on education, business environment and agriculture productivity indicators. Transport and energy need significant investment and reform to be able to 
meet demand.   
Country Objective: (new) support to the Government for identification of priority reforms for growth

based on best international practices and constitute a code 
of conduct for negotiations between creditors and debtors 
in distress or insolvency. This helps avoid accumulation of 
bad credits with the banks. The Romanian workout 
approach has been complemented with a number of key 
reforms to the Insolvency Law (Law 169/14.07.2010) which 
eliminated a number of legal disincentives for out-of-court 
debt restructuring (supported by an FSAP and DPL2).

33 The National Reform Program (NRP), an EU requirement, is the national response of member states to the Lisbon Strategy, through which member states explain how their development strategies are 
aligned with the latter.  The NRP is updated annually and reviewed by the EC. Stating with 2011, the NRP has to be aligned with the objectives of the EU2020 Strategy.  The EU2020 Strategy sets the 
vision for the EU member countries beyond 2013.  Five measurable targets for 2020 steer the process of growth in the EU member countries and give them the direction for reforms in employment, 
research and innovation, climate change and energy, education, and poverty alleviation. The expression of these reforms in national targets and the adoption of a National 2020 Strategy require Romania 
to identify the priorities for intervention and the most appropriate actions for accelerating EU convergence.

Indicator: Fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. Target: 5 in 2009 vs. 6.7 in 
2008  
Not Achieved: Transport Projects closed in CY2009 without 
completing their institutional reform programs in roads and 
railway. Per Bank assessments in 2009-2010, GoR appeared to 
have lost its incentives for pursuing reforms once it became an EU 
member. Given the state of dialogue in early 2009, the impact of 
the global financial crisis, and the lack of agreement between 
Bank and GoR on the TRS Project reform component, a large 
portion of the loan ($120M) was cancelled.   Strategic dialogue in

CAS PILLAR 3: SOCIAL AND SPATIAL INCLUSION 

GOALS: in the short-term, protect the vulnerable from the adverse effects of the crisis; in the medium-term, promote social inclusion and regional development. 
Issues and Obstacles as identified in 2009: The crisis will temporarily increase the number of poor people, especially those involved in service and manufacturing industries.  The long-term poor in rural areas 
and among some population groups remain hard to reach. Some of the social assistance programs are not well targeted. The pension system can be important for poverty reduction, but is currently running a 
deficit and does not reach all those who need it. Romania’s health indicators are lagging the average of those in the EU in important areas.  
Country Objective: assist Romania to improve the social inclusion and living conditions of most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the Romanian society.

46 Family Allowance, Child Raising Benefits, Guaranteed Minimum Income, State Child Allowance. 
47 Target was revised upward as the consolidation in 2010 of special pension systems (army, internal affairs, intelligence services) into the public pension system pushed the deficit of Pillar 1 to 2.95%

Annex 6: Romania - IBRD Indicative Financing Program52 
212. The Romanian authorities have requested increased lending both for budget support and 
investment project financing. The lending ceiling for Romania was raised in November 2013 to 
accommodate projected lending of around US$2.35 billion for the first two years of the CPS 
period.  Budget support operations bring policy coherence to the Government action and anchor 
it in a timetable for structural reform. They are especially effective in Romania as they are 
closely coordinated with the EC and IMF and have strong ownership from the client.

213. Budget support:  The Government has requested annual budget support of the order of 
US$ 1,000 million per year and has asked the Bank to focus initial budget support (FY14) on 
fiscal management, measures to support private sector growth, and structural reforms.  

214. Investment lending: The Government intends to also borrow for investment lending 
lending, to be divided in one to two IPF per year.  The projects planned for the first two years of 
the CPS focus on social development and will cover the health and education sectors and a 
program for social inclusion, with a focus on marginalized communities, including Roma. There 
is also demand for support in the Justice sector and energy.  All projects for the second half of 
the CPS are subject to further discussion and prioritization with the authorities.  

52 Lending volumes will depend on the country’s performance and priorities, IBRD lending capacity, demand from other 
borrowers and global economic developments. The full lending program for the outer years of the CPS will be determined jointly 
with the government and will be reflected in the CPS Progress Report. A DPL series will explore with the authorities reform 
agendas dependent on the macroeconomic environment at the time.

Reimbursable Advisory Services 
215. 
 Reimbursable advisory services (RAS) significantly boosted the World Bank’s AAA 
and knowledge sharing program for Romania.  These activities aim to spur Romania’s 
convergence with EU living standards and support EU2020 targets for smart, inclusive and 
sustainable growth which are fully consistent with the Bank’s goals of alleviating poverty and 
boosting shared prosperity.  The Government faces several challenges to achieve such objectives, 
including poor administrative capacity for public investment management which hampers 
absorption of EU funds.  More efficient use of EU funds could increase the level of capital 
investment and address bottlenecks to growth in infrastructure and public services.  Following 
several years of convergence and strong growth, the financial crisis exposed deep-rooted 
weaknesses and the Bank was called on to support reforms, policy formulation and capacity 
building to address them. Our RAS work is informed by a Memorandum of Understanding 
between Romania and the Bank signed on January 26, 201253.  RAS allowed the Bank to deepen 
our engagement in key transformational areas and improved our ability to respond to the client’s 
growing demand for both lending and knowledge.  

216. Romania currently has the Bank’s largest RAS portfolio.  As of mid-March 2014, our 
portfolio comprises 24 RAS under implementation for a total of about US$42.2 million 
equivalent.  The Bank has already completed 22 RAS worth US$10.7 million.  Our pipeline 
consists of several new RAS in advanced stage of 
preparation which we expect will be signed this FY. 

RAS areas mapped by CPS pillars 

217. RAS strengthened the Bank’s engagement with 
Romania.  RAS allowed the Bank to respond to client 
requests for advice and support that cannot be funded 
within the existing Bank’s budget envelope. RAS has 
positioned the Bank as a trusted knowledge partner in 
Romania.   Respondents to the most recent country survey 
indicated that the Bank has the greatest value in (i) 
technical assistance (44%) and (ii) policy advice (39%).  
By expanding the range of instruments to meet Romania’s 
specific needs, RAS enhanced our role as reform advocate, 
neutral stakeholder and trusted adviser to the Government.  
Satisfaction with the quality of the Bank’s work under 
RAS also strengthened close collaboration with the 
European Commission and other IFIs and the IMF.  As 
demand for our RAS grew, it deepened our policy dialogue 
and engaged us in sensitive reform areas essential for 
addressing Romania’s challenges to achieve inclusive and 
sustainable growth, such as agriculture, public investment 
management, Roma integration, regional development, 
climate change, competitiveness, agriculture productivity, land registration, transport sector 
efficiency, early school leaving, life-long learning, active ageing and social inclusion.

218. RAS have evolved into larger and more complex assignments. The first RAS 
engagements in Romania were a series of Functional Reviews (FRs) for 13 ministries and 
government agencies conducted in 2010-11 which provided strategic and operational 
recommendations to help the Government strengthen its capacity and reform its structures.  
Selected actions of the National Reform Program 2011-2013 to modernize public administration 
derived from the Bank’s recommendations are currently under implementation.  The portfolio 
has now gone beyond the areas initially identified in the MOU to meet government’s evolving 
needs and the nature of our RAS has evolved from RAS of short duration, with a single output 
on a sector or thematic area to more complex, cross-sectoral activities with multiple outputs over 
long implementation periods (sometimes for more than two years). These complex activities 
require close coordination and collaboration among sectors and experts both within the Bank and 
across ministries and projects complement each other or address various aspects within the same 
sector.   

219. Capacity building is an important element of our RAS.  Institutional capacity building 
is a complex and lengthy process requiring long term political commitment.  Our RAS and AAA 
program encourages Government to focus on long term issues, sustain reforms and mitigate the 
backsliding to improve the functions of state.  Our policy dialogue and knowledge activities also 
foster change of values, focus on results and modernization of management practices in the 
public administration.  Through our RAS, the Bank also provides guidance on policy formulation 
and strategy development in key areas.  Several of these strategies constitute ex-ante 
conditionalities for the new EU programming period 2014-2020, thus contributing to medium-
term development issues and helping unlock EU resources and inform their use.      

220. Positive Synergy of RAS with lending and other Bank Group instruments.  RAS are 
often at the core of our program, providing analytical underpinnings for the ongoing DPL DDO 
and the new DPL series.  RAS engagements also generate knowledge which is valuable for the 
Bank for cross-fertilization and its knowledge broker role, including with lower-income 
countries e.g. Eastern Partnership and pre-accession countries as well as other important MICs 
such as Brazil and China.   

221. Prudent stewardship of our RAS portfolio.  The size and complexity of our RAS 
engagements in Romania pose a number of challenges for the Bank as it rapidly adapt to make 
full use of this instrument. These include human resource availability/staffing, need for 
automated tools and systems to administer billing and payments, exchange rate fluctuations 
affecting agreements, potential for “reputational” risk, etc.  The Romania country team, Bank 
management, and corporate RAS working groups are proactively addressing these issues. The 
presence of sector specialists in the Bucharest office has been expanded to help deliver on this 
ambitious agenda and the country management unit has further strengthened its RAS core team.  
During the CPS period, we plan to undertake a comprehensive and independent evaluation of all 
RAS engagements to date and initiate the discussions for amending the existing MoU in order to 
introduce more flexible type of agreements (output based agreements), and reflect Bank 
corporate updates in costing methodologies, RAS policies and standard RAS agreement clauses.

Annex 11: Romania EU Country Specific Recommendations for 2013-2014 

1. Complete the EU/IMF financial assistance program. 
2. Ensure growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and implement the budgetary strategy for the year 2013 
and beyond as envisaged, thus ensuring achievement of the medium term objective by  2015. Improve tax 
collection by implementing a comprehensive tax compliance strategy and fight undeclared work. In 
parallel, explore ways to increase reliance on environmental taxes. Equalize the pensionable age for men 
and women and promote employability of older workers. 
3. Pursue health sector reforms to increase its efficiency, quality and accessibility, in particular for 
disadvantaged people and remote and isolated communities. Reduce the excessive use of hospital care 
including by strengthening outpatient care.  
4. Improve labor market participation, as well as employability and productivity of the labor force, by 
reviewing and strengthening active labor market policies, to provide training and individualized services 
and promoting lifelong learning. Enhance the capacity of the National Employment Agency to increase 
the quality and coverage of its services. To fight youth unemployment, implement without delay the 
National Plan for Youth Employment, including for example through a Youth Guarantee. To alleviate 
poverty, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social transfers with a particular focus on children. 
Complete the social assistance reform by adopting the relevant legislation and strengthening its link with 
activation measures. Ensure concrete delivery of the National Roma integration strategy. 
5.  Speed up the education reform including the building up of administrative capacity at both central and 
local level and evaluate the impact of the reforms. Step up reforms in vocational education and training. 
Further align tertiary education with the needs of the labor market and improve access for disadvantaged 
people. Implement a national strategy on early school leaving focusing on better access to quality early 
childhood education, including for Roma children. Transition quickly from institutional to alternative care 
for children deprived of parental care.  
6. Strengthen governance and the quality of institutions and the public administration, in particular by 
improving the capacity for strategic and budgetary planning, by increasing the professionalism of the 
public service through improved human resource management and by strengthening the mechanisms for 
coordination between the different levels of government. Significantly improve the quality of regulations 
through the use of impact assessments, and systematic evaluations. Step up efforts to accelerate the 
absorption of EU funds in particular by strengthening management and control systems and improving 
public procurement. 
7. Improve and simplify the business environment in particular through reducing administrative burdens 
on SMEs and implementing a coherent e-government strategy. Ease and diversify access to finance for 
SMEs. Ensure closer links between research, innovation and industry, in particular by prioritizing 
research and development activities that have the potential to attract private investment. Step up efforts to 
improve the quality, independence and efficiency of the judicial system in resolving cases and fight 
corruption more effectively. 
8. Promote competition and efficiency in network industries, by ensuring the independence and capacity 
of national regulatory authorities, and by continuing the corporate governance reform of state-owned 
enterprises in the energy and transport sectors. Adopt a comprehensive long-term transport plan and 
improve broadband infrastructure. Continue to remove regulated gas and electricity prices and improve 
energy efficiency. Improve the cross-border integration of energy networks and speed up implementation 
of the gas interconnection projects.

Annex 12: Documenting the Consultative Process 

222. The proposed CPS program is the result of a prolonged period of consultation with a 
wide variety of stakeholders.  The CPS team had several discussions with the Ministry of 
Public Finance and other ministries including health, agriculture, information society, economy, 
transport, EU funds Regional development, labor and social protection, justice, environment and 
climate change, education, large infrastructure.  In Bucharest the team also held consultations 
with the National Bank of Romania, the Bucharest Stock Exchange, and convened brainstorming 
workshops with selected think-tanks and NGOs, and with the private sector.  The EC was also 
consulted periodically including a half day Romania Country Team workshop convened in 
Brussels by the Secretariat General. 
223. Regional consultations have enriched the analysis contained in the CPS.  Joint Bank 
and IFC regional consultations were held in Timisoara, Cluj, Iasi and Constanta.  In each 
location the team met with the Mayor or deputy Mayor and the heads of the regional 
development agency and the city council.  Additional meetings were held with leading members 
of the private sector, academia and development authorities.  The team also visited Slobozia, 
Bora Neighborhood to review the Bank’s experience in establishing a multi-functional center 
that was developed under the Social Inclusion Project and to a Roma settlement in the city. The 
team had discussions with the local authorities, the beneficiaries of the projects and with people 
of Roma origin who had the opportunity to present the situation and the most urgent challenges 
they are facing. The CPS is also informed by the recently concluded country survey and 
knowledge mapping exercises which reached out to those most familiar with the Bank in 
Romania to gather their thoughts and ideas on the Bank’s recent performance and potential areas 
for future engagement.  The team informed the public through regular press briefings as well as 
by placing selected materials on the internal and external websites for comment.
