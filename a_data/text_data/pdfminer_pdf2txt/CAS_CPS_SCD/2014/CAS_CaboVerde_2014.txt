EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Cabo Verde’s strong growth from 2000 to 2008, driven by steadily growing tourism 
services and accelerated capital accumulation, translated into considerable poverty 
reduction and boosted shared prosperity. During those years, GDP growth averaged 6 percent 
annually and the economy grew from US$0.5 billion in 2000 to US$1.8 billion in 2012.   Per 
capita Gross National Income (GNI, Atlas method) reached US$3,630 in 2013, more than four 
times what it was in 1990, placing the country firmly in the World Bank’s lower-middle-income 
category. In 2007, Cabo Verde became one of the few nations to graduate from the United 
Nations list of Least Developed Countries (LDC). The poverty rate dropped from 37 percent in 
2001/2002 to 27 percent in 2007. The extreme-poverty rate dropped from 21 percent in 2002 to 
12 percent in 2007, while the Gini coefficient fell from 0.55 to 0.48 over the same period. The 
income of the bottom 40 percent of the population increased as a share of total income from 9.9 
percent to 21 percent;   its share of consumption expenditures increased from 7 percent to 19 
percent. The country also made such steady progress towards achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) that achieving all of them by 2015 is within reach. 
ii. 
However, since 2008, Cabo Verde has been severely affected by the global financial 
crisis and the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on markets. GDP growth fell 
from an average of 6.7 percent in the pre-global crisis period (2000-08) to an average of 1.2 
percent since then (2009-12). The global crisis has also affected macroeconomic stability, 
reflected in weakened fiscal and debt sustainability. The adverse external context marked a 
strong shift in the Government’s fiscal stance. The Government has accelerated its public 
investment program since 2008 as part of an ambitious drive to draw on remaining concessional 
resources to provide key infrastructure. The Public Investment Program (PIP) provided a modest 
impetus to economic growth but resulted in large fiscal deficits and increasing indebtedness. 
iii. 
Cabo Verde understands the need to reset its diversified sources of growth.  The 
Government recognizes that capital accumulation alone cannot sustain high growth rates 
indefinitely, and that the positive external circumstances that contributed to strong growth in the 
past have now become significantly less favorable. In the face of a difficult macroeconomic 
position and a highly uncertain global scenario, the Government’s Third Growth and Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP III) articulates a macroeconomic adjustment in the short to 
medium term, with a strong structural reform agenda to enhance productivity as the new source 
of growth and to promote shared and more diverse growth.  
iv. 
Enhancing macroeconomic resilience and ensuring sustained growth through 
improvements in productivity are two interdependent endeavors. It will be crucial to contain 
expenditure, and especially to maintain the commitment toward decelerating the Public 
Investment Program. Fiscal consolidation implies a smaller fiscal envelope, which means that the 
public sector will need to increase its efficiency in expenditure management and promote a 
greater role for the private sector in Cabo Verde’s economic growth. A dynamic economy will be 
a crucial ingredient for reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio and thus strengthening fiscal and debt 
sustainability. 
v. 
Cabo Verde will have to prepare itself for financing at market terms given that 
graduating from the UN list of LDCs in 2007 means that access to concessional financing is 
phasing out. Domestic public borrowing is limited by the need to support the currency peg and 
the risk of crowding out private investment. Thus, the government will have to mobilize new 
external resources to finance its existing and future debt obligations. Strong fiscal discipline and 

i 

 
 
a downward-trending debt-to-GDP ratio will be indispensable for accessing financing at market 
terms, both from development partners and international capital markets more generally. 
vi. 
Tourism will remain the key driver for growth and enhancing its performance will 
be critical. Over the past 15 years, the country has succeeded to position itself as a “sun, sea and 
sand” destination, and in 2013, for the first time the number of tourists visiting in one year 
exceeded the population of Cabo Verde. The contribution of tourism to local GDP grew from 5 
percent in 2000 to around 20 percent in 2012. Given the sustained inflow of Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) in tourism, the sector is expected to continue being a driver of growth and a 
source of employment in the medium and long term.  
vii. 
Against this backdrop, the FY15-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims at 
supporting Cabo Verde in enhancing macro-fiscal stability and addressing growth 
challenges. The CPS outlines the financial and technical support of the World Bank Group 
(WBG), organized around two complementary programmatic pillars: (a) enhancing macro-fiscal 
stability in order to set the foundation for sustained growth, and (b) improving competitiveness 
and private sector development. The latter includes support to establish a conducive investment 
climate and improve the performance of the tourism sector and other sectors (e.g. fisheries and 
agriculture) that are potential drivers of poverty reduction. Knowledge products will include, 
among others, technical assistance to help the country develop external financing tools as part of 
its transition for financing at market terms.

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Cabo Verde is an archipelago of 10 islands located off the west coast of Africa. Nine 
of these islands are inhabited by approximately 500,000 inhabitants.  The country has few natural 
resources and suffers from serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought, 
one of the main causes of emigration in Cabo Verde’s earlier history. It is believed that now at 
least as many Cabo Verdeans (and descendants) live abroad as on the archipelago. 
2. 
The preparation of the proposed CPS (FY15-17) was delayed in order to give time to 
the government and the World Bank Group to assess the severe impact of the global 
financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis on Cabo Verde’s economy. This 
assessment has informed the design of the proposed CPS. The CPS was also informed by broad 
consultations with all stakeholders, including government officials and members of civil society 
and the private sector. 
3. 
The CPS is in line with the GRSP III, and guided by the WBG’s two strategic goals 
of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Cabo Verde has already made great 
strides in reducing extreme poverty and increasing the welfare of the bottom 40 percent. Through 
the WBG’s focus on agriculture as a cornerstone of poverty reduction, and on strengthening the 
linkages of tourism to the agriculture and fisheries sectors, the WBG program will support the 
Government’s target of reducing the poverty rate to 20 percent by 2016.  Through support to 
private sector development, in particular to the tourism sector, the WBG program will boost 
shared prosperity.  

2.1. OVERVIEW 

II. 

COUNTRY DIAGNOSIS 

4. 
Cabo Verde is a robust democracy. The Polity IV index, which measures the strength 
of a country’s democratic institutions, rates Cabo Verde high in the region. Cabo Verde has not 
experienced a single coup d’état, a West African record shared only by Senegal. Since the 
adoption of a multiparty system in 1991, Cabo Verde has enjoyed remarkable political stability. 
The African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde (PAICV) and the Movement for 
Democracy (MpD) have dominated Cabo Verdean politics, with each party having ruled for 
about a decade and  alternating power regularly and peacefully.1 In 2003, Freedom House lauded 
Cabo Verde’s achievements since independence (Figure 1). Cabo Verde’s strong institutions are 
reflected in its score in the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) 
(Figure 2): it ranks at the top among IDA-recipient countries in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) 
region, and third among all IDA countries.   

1 In fact, currently both parties are in the Government, with the PAICV controlling the cabinet and the MpD the 
presidency. This power sharing arrangement, in place since the 2011 elections, has been functioning smoothly.

5. 
A steadily expanding tourism sector and accelerated capital accumulation were the 
drivers of economic growth.  Fueled by strong external demand, tourism export receipts grew 
from US$40 million in 2000 to more than US$400 million in 20122, an annual growth rate of 19 
percent, much higher than the 6 percent observed for worldwide tourism in this period. The 
boom in tourism was driven by large FDI inflows, while the extensive utilization of Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) enabled the Government of Cabo Verde to increase public 
investment to about 10 percent of GDP over the last two decades. Consequently, Cabo Verde 
now has a relatively well-developed stock of infrastructure assets. Pivotal to the economic 
success was the establishment of the exchange rate regime, pegged to the euro, as a new 
mechanism for conducting monetary and exchange rate policy, which was supported by prudent 
fiscal policies.  In addition, the fixed exchange rate facilitated the growth of FDI, remittances and 
migrant deposits, producing positive effects on growth, consumption and national savings, and 
providing liquidity to the domestic financial sector. 
6. 
There has been noticeable progress in terms of poverty reduction and boosting 
shared prosperity. The poverty rate dropped from 49 percent in 1988/89 to 37 percent in 
2001/2002 and then to 27 percent in 2007. The proportion of the population in extreme poverty 
also dropped significantly, from 21 percent in 2002 to 12 percent 2007. Income distribution and 
shared prosperity have improved. The Gini coefficient fell from 0.55 in 2002 to 0.48 in 2007, 
while the income of the bottom 40 percent as a share of total income increased from 9.9 percent 
in 2002 to 21 percent in 2007. Moreover, the share of expenditures of the bottom 40 percent in 
total expenditures increased from 7 percent in 2002 to 19 percent in 2007, demonstrating that the 
welfare of the bottom 40 percent has improved substantially. The GPRSP III projects a reduction 
in the poverty rate to 20 percent by 2016, to be achieved by promoting modernization of the 
agriculture and fisheries sectors, in which poverty incidence is most acute, thereby enhancing 
employment prospects for poor and vulnerable groups.  
7. 
A poverty mapping exercise revealed that tourism growth in Cabo Verde has the 
potential to lift more people out of poverty. Poverty is particularly low in Sal and Boa Vista, 
the islands that have experienced much of the tourism growth (Figure 3). These islands were two

of the three islands that reduced poverty the most between 2000 and 2007, when tourism grew 
from 7 percent of GDP to nearly 20 percent. The large drop in poverty rates is largely due to the 
migration of Cabo Verdeans from other islands to seek economic opportunities in the relatively 
well-paying tourism sector. While the national poverty headcount is about 27 percent, the 
poverty headcount among agriculture and fisheries workers is 44 percent and 35 percent, 
respectively. Poverty among households linked to the tourism sector is just 12 percent. Falling 
poverty rates on other islands have likely been fueled by internal remittances from relatives 
working in the tourism sector in Sal and Boa Vista.

8. 
Cabo Verde has also improved its social indicators. Cabo Verde ranks 132nd out of 
187 countries in the UNDP’s 2013 Human Development Index (HDI), the third-highest ranking 
in SSA, putting it in the “medium human development” category. Cabo Verde’s average life 
expectancy, estimated at 71 years, is the highest in SSA. The infant mortality rate fell from 26 
per 1,000 live births in 2007 to 15 in 2011.  The maternal mortality rate fell from 36 per 100,000 
live births in 2006 to 26 in 2011. By 2011, 94 percent of children under one year of age were 
fully immunized, and the percentage of the total population living less than half an hour from a 
health center reached 86 percent. Similarly, education outcomes put Cabo Verde at the top of 
Sub-Saharan Africa. The adult literacy rate is estimated at 87 percent, although disparities persist 
between men and women.   
9. 
Despite its rapid economic growth in the 2000s, Cabo Verde continues to experience 
high unemployment, currently at 16.4 percent, as the rate of job creation has been lower 
than the growth of the economically active population. The current and projected 
demographic structure will likely generate a high and growing number of young workers 
entering the labor force. An analysis of the dynamics of labor force participation by gender 
indicates that an increasing number of women will enter the workforce. Without a comparable 
increase in the demand for labor, this trend will increase the unemployment rate, and likely affect 
women disproportionately. Female unemployment is almost 3 percentage points higher than 
male unemployment. Cabo Verde’s unemployment is not only biased towards women but also 
towards youth, and is especially acute among low-skilled workers. Large regional differences in 

3 

 
 
 
  
 
unemployment are also observed. In addition to high unemployment, the islands of Santiago, 
Santo Antão and São Vicente show evidence of significant skill gaps.  
10. 
Unemployment is not the only problem affecting Cabo Verde’s young and female 
populations. Young people and women generally have lower skills and labor productivity and 
tend to work in low-quality jobs.  The available data show that informality is higher than average 
among women and youth. Individuals younger than 25 years old are mainly employed in the 
informal sector, the population between 25 and 35 years old is mainly formal, and the population 
between 35 and 60 years old is distributed almost evenly between formality and informality. The 
majority of elderly workers are employed in the informal sector. Results also show that 
informality is highly correlated with female workers, disadvantaging them in the labor market. 
Table 1 show that households headed by women are significantly poorer than households headed 
by men across all of the nine inhabited islands.

In Cabo Verde, the importance of the diaspora is indisputable. The Cabo Verdean 
diaspora is large and estimated to number at least as many as the population of the archipelago. 
The vast majority are based in European countries and the United States. Indeed, emigration has 
been essential to the archipelago and today it is one of the main channels through which the 
country participates in the global economy. The diaspora supports the Cabo Verdean economy in 
four ways. First, they send home remittances. Second, they deposit a considerable amount of 
savings in Cabo Verdean banks, accounting for 40 percent of total deposits. Through financial 
intermediation, these deposits can support domestic investment and growth. Third, some 
members of the diaspora have invested in domestic enterprises through FDI. And fourth, it is 
estimated that Cabo Verdeans returning for holidays and vacations comprise about 20 percent of 
the total tourism industry.  
12. While the diaspora has played and continues to play a critical role in the country’s 
economic and social life, there is untapped potential to engage the diaspora in supporting the 
transition of Cabo Verde to a higher income country, either as investors or as agents for the 
transfer of know-how in several areas of expertise.  Furthermore, with about two-thirds of Cabo 
Verde’s tertiary-educated population living abroad, the diaspora can generate human capital 
gains. The GPRSP III recognizes the central role that the diaspora can play in the economic 
development of the country

2.2. MAJOR DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND THE WAY FORWARD 

13. 
Cabo Verde faces three interrelated development challenges. First, it is confronted 
with a difficult external macroeconomic environment, compounded by weakened fiscal accounts 
and vulnerable external accounts. Second, while economic growth will continue to be mainly 
driven by the tourism industry, the sector needs to be more closely linked to the rest of the 
economy, to increase tourism’s multiplier effect. Third, Cabo Verde needs to increase its 
competitiveness by fostering private sector investment as its future growth has to rely less on 
physical capital accumulation and more on improvements in productivity. 
14. 
Analytical work prepared in the last 4 years has informed the identification of the 
country challenges, in particular the recently completed Country Economic Memorandum 
(CEM).

2.2.1 A difficult macro-fiscal scenario and the need to enhance stability 

15. 
The global financial crisis and double-dip 
recession in the Eurozone exacted a heavy toll on 
Cabo Verde’s economic growth and macroeconomic 
stability (Figure 4). After strong GDP growth that 
averaged 6.7 percent annually since 2000, Cabo Verde 
experienced a recession in 2009 as GDP contracted by 
1.3 percent, recovering modestly to 1.5 percent in 2010 
and to 4 percent in 2011. Another recession in the 
Eurozone in 2012 contributed to renewed economic 
weakening. Falling imports, decelerating credit to the 
private sector, contracting FDI, frail business confidence, 
flat inflation, and increases in unemployment and non-
performing loans, suggest that growth has remained 
anemic since then, estimated at 0.5 percent for 2013 and 
1.0 percent for 2014. Overall, Cabo Verde’s average 
GDP growth rate in the post-crisis period (2009-13) fell 
to 1.2 percent from 6.7 percent in the pre-crisis period.

16. 
The fall in revenues as a consequence of the economic slowdown accounted for 
almost 40 percent of the deterioration of fiscal balances.3 Due to the simultaneous drop in 
both tax revenues and donor grants, Government revenues fell from an average of 28.7 percent 
of GDP in 2006-08 to 25.2 percent in 2009-2013. Tax revenues fell from an average of 21.5 
percent of GDP in 2006-08 to 18.6 percent in 2009-13. As a result of the economic crisis among 
Cabo Verde’s main development partners in Europe, external grants fell from an average of 4.9 
percent of GDP to 3.6 percent in 2009-13. In 2014, the government made a considerable effort to 
increase revenues to counteract the fall in revenues, including the raising of VAT rates to the 
national level of 15 percent for sectors, including hotels and restaurants, which were previously 
only subjected to a 6 percent rate. The revenue outturn of the first half of 2014 shows that this 
has translated into considerable revenue gains on VAT; however, persistent economic weakness 
continues to moderate the overall revenue outturn. This CPS, through the PSRCs series, will 
continue to support government’s efforts in improving tax revenues.  
17. 
Increases in total spending, and in particular investment, have been responsible for 
the remaining 60 percent of the worsening fiscal balances. The wage bill has remained stable 
at around 11 percent of GDP, which is comparable to that of other small economies in which 
economies of scale are not available. As a result of the recent elimination of energy subsidies, 
price-supporting measures in Cabo Verde are very low, at less than 1 percent of GDP. However, 
the authorities have undertaken an ambitious investment program, mostly financed by 
concessional borrowing. When the Public Investment Program was initiated in 2008, public 
investment more than doubled. Since then, public investment as a percentage of GDP (including 
investments through SOEs) has remained in double-digits. To some extent, strong public 
investment constituted a counter-cyclical policy response against strong economic headwinds 
from 2009 onward—although its economic multiplier effect tends to be small due to an import 
content of about 90 percent. Expansionary fiscal policy led to increased deficits and reversed the 
declining trajectory of the public debt, which reached an estimated 99 percent of GDP in 2013. 
However the debt is largely concessional, with an average maturity of 23 years and an average 
interest rate of only 0.75 percent, such that interest payments are low, at about 2 percent of GDP. 
18. 
A stochastic Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared by the Bank team 
indicates that the trajectory of public debt is sustainable, but significant vulnerabilities will 
persist in the short term. Based on the authorities’ Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 
(MTEF) and Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) for 2014-17, which were agreed by the Bank 
and authorities, the DSA indicates that the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reverse its increasing 
trend in 2016, when it will reach a peak of about 120 percent of GDP. It is then expected to fall 
slowly to about 80 percent of GDP by 2030.  
19. 
Financing its debt obligations will become a key challenge for the country, as 
concessional resources decline. The Public Investment Program is almost entirely financed by 
project loans from bilateral and multilateral development partners. Gaps in the operating 
balance 4 and amortizations are financed mainly with domestic public borrowing and budget 
support. Both are limited: domestic public borrowing is limited by law to 3 percent of GDP, and 
budget support is limited by the financing allocations of development partners—which are either 
phasing out or becoming less concessional following the country’s graduation from LDC status. 
Future borrowing will increasingly be devoted to servicing the outstanding debt (i.e. interest 
payments and amortizations). Gross Financing Needs (GFN) are expected to fall, driven by the 
retrenchment of the Public Investment Program, and by recent efforts to mobilize domestic

revenue.  However, it will be a crucial challenge for Cabo Verde to access new non-concessional 
external financing to service its debt obligations. Table 3 presents the key economic indicators 
for 2011-2017.

Medium term outlook   

20. 
The challenge for fiscal policy in the coming years is to strike the right balance 
between supporting growth and preserving macroeconomic discipline and debt 
sustainability. The Government should pursue a gradual medium-term fiscal adjustment 
trajectory. On the revenue side, building on the achievements of the tax reform5, the Government 
should continue the revenue reform by closing tax loopholes, and consolidate achievements in 
tax administration.  
21. On the expenditure side, the Government should pursue the gradual declining 
trajectory of public investment. Both the 2015 budget and the Medium-Term Expenditure 
Framework (MTFF) for 2014-2017 indicate that the retrenchment of public investment and net 
lending has commenced in earnest. Some large foreign-financed investments, including a social 
housing program, expansion of the Praia airport, the renovation of the Boa Vista seaport, and an 
energy project financed by IBRD, will keep investment spending relatively high until the 
completion of these projects. The Government will not add any new projects to the PIP but focus 
on execution of existing projects. Furthermore, the Government has begun developing a new 
national public investment system with Bank support whereby all investment projects will be 
subject to a rigorous technical assessment to calculate financial, economic and social returns 
based on reliable statistics. This should help the Government select investment projects that 
guarantee value for money.   
22. 
The fiscal adjustment required over the medium term to maintain debt 
sustainability is feasible and consistent with the Government’s new economic growth 
model. Reducing debt levels implies lower spending, which suggests that growth-enhancing 
fiscal policies will come not from higher public investment, but mainly from expenditure 
reallocations and efficiency enhancements. At the same time, falling ODA needs to be offset by 
increased efficiency in tax collection. The “fiscal diamond” (Figure 5) illustrates Cabo Verde’s 
shifting fiscal priorities, with a stronger emphasis on domestic revenue and expenditure 
efficiency.  Reducing borrowing in a context of declining ODA flows requires efforts to increase 
domestic resource mobilization and reducing public expenditures, especially public investment. 
Not only do these have short-term macroeconomic implications, but they should also shape the 
country’s new fiscal policy for growth: less aid, less borrowing, more domestic revenue and 
more efficiency. Implementation of the PEMFAR6 recommendations through the modernization 
of public finance management (PFM), enhancement of the public investment management (PIM) 
system, and improvements in the performance of SOEs, will be critical for the fiscal 
consolidation. 

5 To strengthen domestic revenue mobilization, the Government adopted a tax package that increased the value-
added tax (VAT) rate paid by hotels and restaurants from 6 to the standard rate of 15 percent; broadened the base of 
the VAT to include public utilities and oil; introduced a tourism fee of 2 euros per guest per night and a fee for the 
statistical registration of customs transactions; and expanded the base of the ecological tax on non-biodegradable 
imports. 
6 The recent Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR, 2013) prepared by 
the Bank, the AfdB, the EU and the Spanish Agency for International  Cooperation  (EACID), provides a more 
detailed assessment of Cabo Verde’s government expenditure management. This assessment covers expenditure 
management in the health, energy and environment sectors

23. 
Finally, the Government will need to prepare itself for financing at market terms. 
Expanding the financing envelope and reducing reliance on concessional budget support, while 
staying within the statutory limit for domestic borrowing, will be crucial for the Government to 
finance its debt. The African Development Bank has already phased out concessional budget 
support to Cabo Verde; the European Union will stop providing concessional budget support 
grants in 2020. In the future, World Bank budget support will be provided under IBRD terms. 
Moreover, as any emerging economy, Cabo Verde will increasingly have to access international 
capital markets. The small volumes of bond issues associated with a small economy, and high 
indebtedness resulting in weak sovereign credit ratings, will pose hindrances.  
2.2.2 Improving state-owned enterprise (SOE) performance and public sector efficiency 
24. 
Contingent liabilities incurred through state-owned enterprises pose significant 
fiscal risks and exacerbate medium-term vulnerabilities. SOEs in Cabo Verde provide vital 
services, especially in the strategic areas of transport, water, and electricity. The five largest 
SOEs in Cabo Verde are Empresa Nacional de Aeroportos e Segurança Aréa (ASA, operating 
the country’s airports); Empresa Nacional de Administração dos Portos (ENAPOR, operating 
the country’s harbors); Transportes Aéreos de Cabo Verde (TACV, the state airline); Empresa de 
Electricidade e Águas (ELECTRA, the national water and electricity utility); and Imobiliária, 
Fundiária e Habitat (IFH, providing housing services). These five SOEs account for 70 percent 
of state-owned capital and hold assets equivalent to 32 percent of GDP. Four of the five focus on 
transport and utilitiesvital areas for economic development and poverty reduction.  
25. 
These SOEs have long been a source of contingent liabilities for the government, due 
to their generally weak commercial and financial performance. Given that the central 
government is the main shareholder, it directly or indirectly bears all risks of the SOEs’ poor 
financial performance. The total debt of SOEs reached 26 percent of GDP in 2012. While the 
SOE debt guaranteed by the state amounts to just 4 percent of GDP, the critical services that 
SOEs provide mean that the state is effectively obligated to lend financial support to the SOEs 
even on non-guaranteed obligations. The SOEs sometimes cover their losses by postponing 
maintenance or reducing services, but normally they induce financial transfers from the central 
government by defaulting on debts or accumulating arrears with providers. Cumulative debts and 
triggered contingent liabilities result in periodic recapitalization and debt swaps. Therefore, the 
effective contingent liabilities generated are actually much higher than the SOE debt officially 
guaranteed by the state. According to a recent Ministry of Finance report on SOEs (2013), 

9 

 
 
 
underlying contingent liabilities in SOEs amounted to 11.6 percent of GDP in 2012 (including 
both guaranteed and non-guaranteed debt). The same report states that aggregate financial losses 
reached 1.4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 1 percent of GDP in 2012. A social housing project, 
Casa Para Todos, implemented by IFH, is financed with a loan equivalent to about 11 percent of 
2013 GDP.  
26. 
Reforming SOEs to ensure their financial sustainability is one of the major 
challenges for the near future. Support under the previous CPS has yielded tangible results 
(Box 1). But analytical work conducted by the WBG confirms that there is room to significantly 
improve SOE performance in delivering services. Over the last five years, the Government has 
been working to strengthen SOE management and oversight. In 2009, the Govenment adopted a 
new law restructuring the legal and governance framework for SOEs (Lei do Setor Empresarial 
do Estado). However, the effectiveness of state oversight and ownership continues to be limited 
by weak institutional capacities. Reforming the governance of SOEs need not only address 
inefficiencies in service delivery, but also improve financial performance to reduce contingent 
liabilities and improve the sustainability of public debt. In particular, ensuring that Casa Para 
Todos is implemented as originally anticipated will make a major contribution to reducing the 
debt-to-GDP burden.  

Box 1: Combination of DPL and Sector Operations Instrumental in Advancing Structural Reforms 

The PRSC series and the transport sector credits have been supporting each other and helping advance the 
reform agenda in the transport sector. Actions supported under PRSC VIII related to publication of the 
consolidated report on the 2011 SOE financial statements by the Ministry of Finance. The audited statements of the 
main SOEs provided the detailed financial information needed to analyze the weaknesses of those SOEs, and to 
define the needs of the transport SOEs in terms of technical assistance and reforms. TA in the air transport sector 
(funded by the Road Sector Support Project closed in June 2013) helped define short-term strategic cost-saving 
measures, including actions under the PRSC VIII, such as shutting down losing routes and reviewing the free travel 
policies for staff and families.  

The signing of performance agreements between the Government and ASA, ENAPOR, and TACV is a 
proposed action for PRSC X. The drafting of these agreements will be supported by the TA component of the new 
Transport Sector Reform Project (TSRP).  In the road sector, the TSRP is funding performance-based road 
rehabilitation and maintenance contracts covering four islands and about 35 percent of the national road network, 
contributing to the 65 percent target objective set for 2015 in the PRSC series.  PRSC IX supported  the revised fare 
policies for ENAPOR (ports), also supported by the TSRP, which finances the necessary consulting services. 
In the electricity sector, reforms supported by the PRSC series led to the resolution of longstanding legislative and 
regulatory issues (passage of legislation securing electricity bill payment by municipalities, and more recently final 
adoption of new legislation to strengthen judicial enforcement of measures against electricity theft). This was 
complemented by the IBRD-funded Recovery and Reform of the Electricity Sector Project (RRESP) which is 
financing energy mix investments and ELECTRA reform that have reduced the frequency and duration of load 
shedding and fuel costs. 

2.2.3 Enhancing the performance of the tourism sector  
27. 
Since 2007, tourism has been the main driver of growth in Cabo Verde (Figure 6). 
Tourism in Cabo Verde began when the Government started buying vast tracts of land in Sal and 
Boa Vista, two islands with attractive beaches and small populations; and also created special 
tourism development zones to encourage FDI. In 2010, hotels and restaurants generated 83 
percent more jobs than in 2000, underlining the sector’s ability to generate employment. Sixty-
four percent of those jobs were held by women.  The World Travel and Tourism Council 7 

7 World Travel and Tourism Council. 2013. Cabo Verde Economic Impact Report.  

10 

 
 
 
 
                                                            
estimates that the tourism and travel sector generates around one-eighth of all jobs in Cabo 
Verde. If indirect jobs are added to the equation, the sector generates more than 30 percent of 
employment with its linkages to other sectors such as construction, and to a lesser extent, 
agriculture, and fisheries.

28. 
The capacity to design and implement a second generation tourism strategy is very 
limited and dispersed among several stakeholders. The tourism sector is currently overseen 
by the General Directorate of Tourism (DGT) within the Ministry of Tourism, Industry, and 
Energy. Tourism investment promotion is handled by Cabo Verde Investments (CVI), but its 
activities are limited in scope. As highlighted in the GPRSP III, the CVI’s inadequate capacity 
and dispersion are reflected in poor promotion and marketing, lack of data8 analysis to support 
decision-making, weak regulatory capacity, limited dialogue with the private sector, and lack of 
product diversity and supply. As identified in the GPRSP III, the Government needs to establish 
a national tourism organization with strong private sector involvement to provide much-needed 
leadership.  
29. 
Environmental quality is a matter of serious and growing concern, particularly 
given the importance of natural capital to the tourism industry. Maplecroft, in its 2015 
climate change vulnerability index (CCVI)9 identifies West Africa coastal areas as at high risk. 
Coastal erosion, sand extraction, the mismanagement of limited water resources and various 
forms of pollution all pose a significant threat to the country’s growth prospects.  In addition, as 
a small island nation, Cabo Verde faces significant challenges associated with climate change—
especially rising sea levels and the greater frequency of severe weather patterns—which could 
increase the likelihood and severity of droughts and flooding. Rapid economic growth is often 
associated with environmental degradation, and environmental issues are particularly pertinent 
for Cabo Verde, as the health of the tourism industry largely depends on the natural beauty of the 
archipelago. 
30. 
The country’s tourism potential and the corresponding development impact remain 
to be fully exploited. Tourism development in general, and especially more recent projects, have

against 75 indicators under 14 different pillars.

tended to favor the model of large-scale, all-inclusive resorts, with smaller accommodations on 
more populated islands often catering to the local population rather than to international visitors. 
A recent World Bank study finds that all-inclusive resorts and larger bed and breakfasts, 
especially those targeting high-end tourism, have the biggest effect on the economy. Apart from 
their considerable contribution to the national budget through taxation and the generation of 
employment, they can also have a considerable effect on national production through linkages 
with other sectors, especially services, fishing and agriculture (fresh food and vegetables). 
However, such linkages are underdeveloped due to the weakness of inter-island transport and 
local agriculture, which limits the ability of the tourism sector to reduce poverty and increase 
shared prosperity.  
31. 
Investing in agriculture value chain development will focus on increasing 
agricultural productivity and promoting links between producers and the tourism sector. 
Efforts in the agriculture sector have focused on managing irrigation, dam and reservoir 
construction, expanding the area under drip irrigation; introducing new technologies10; extension 
services, rural road construction; and improving access to finance. In total eight dams are 
planned in order to supply 7 million m³ of water to irrigate 700 ha of land and allow several crop 
rotations a year. The result is a clear increase in output and a more commercial orientation away 
from subsistence and reliance on staples, but more efforts are needed to improve agriculture 
productivity through the adoption of improved technologies. In addition, to enable producers to 
enter the tourism value chain will require promoting contract farming mechanisms with local 
food traders and hotels and ensuring that the local supply is of the quality required for targeted 
markets. There is a clear opportunity for job creation for youth and women in particular in the 
areas of services, production, processing and marketing. This will help address some of the 
country’s major development challenges, including the high rate of poverty among farmers (44 
percent) as well as the high rate of unemployment among local youth and women. 
2.2.4 Improving competitiveness and private sector development 
32. 
In Cabo Verde, total factor productivity (TFP) has been weak in recent years. 
Different growth decomposition exercises undertaken for the 2014 Country Economic 
Memorandum indicate that TFP has had a negligible or even negative impact on growth. A 
simple decomposition exercise using physical capital and labor force shows that after a negative 
contribution since independence in 1974, only in the period of 19952000 did TFP have a 
positive contribution to growth. Factoring in Cabo Verde’s considerable improvements in 
education, as well as a growth dividend from an expanding labor force, the calculations suggest 
that TFP has made a consistent and negative contribution to GDP growth (Figures 7 and 8). 
33. 
To continue to enhance its growth potential and move up the income ladder, Cabo 
Verde will need to make productivity its new driver of growth. Intensifying investment in 
human capital is one element of this story. Reallocation of factors from low to high-productivity 
sectors will also be necessary, with improvements in labor force skills and labor market 
flexibility to enable these reallocations. This implies enhancing the performance of the main 
source of growth—the tourism sector—as well as the supporting sectors (such as infrastructure, 
financial sector, and skills development). The public sector will increasingly have to assume an 
enabling role for private sector-led growth.

2.2.4.1 Investment climate 
34. 
Cabo Verde needs to undertake further investment climate reforms and address a 
number of cross-cutting constraints to improve its global competitiveness. Some of Cabo 
Verde’s key weaknesses identified by the 2014 Global Competitiveness Report (Figure 9) 
include its market size (due to its limited domestic market); infrastructure (constraints relating to 
electricity supply, mobile phone subscriptions, availability of airline seats); innovation (limited 
availability of scientists and engineers, weak spending on R&D, limited patents); financial 
market development (high cost of financial services, difficult access to credit); and technological 
readiness (relatively limited internet bandwidth and internet penetration).

In terms of the legal environment, Cabo Verde was 122nd out of 189 countries in the 
overall 2015 Doing Business ranking (Figure 10):  There has been significant progress in some 
areas. For example, the One-Stop-Shop reduced the registration process from 52 to 10 days, and 
the number of procedures from 12 to 7, between 2008 and 2014. However, from an international 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perspective, although the country performs better than immediate neighbors such as Mauritania, 
Senegal or The Gambia, it ranks well below the best African performer—Mauritius—which is 
ranked 28th.  Cabo Verde still lags behind in many areas, including (a) lengthy procedures to get 
construction permits; (b) difficulty in obtaining credit; (c) complexity of trade procedures; (d) the 
lack of a bankruptcy law;  an ineffective court system (e.g., it takes many years for banks to 
redeem collateral in case of loan default); and (f) the high cost of electricity. Investment climate 
reforms in these and other areas are critically needed if the private sector is to play the 
envisioned leading role in economic growth. This is especially important for the tourism sector, 
as it operates in a very competitive global market, where the high cost of doing business 
translates into a less price competitive sector.

36. 
Despite substantial progress in human capital development over the past two 
decades, improving human capital productivity remains a challenge. The Government has 
spent a considerable share of its budget on improving the education system. Between 2000 and 
2010, total economically active population increased by 28 percent and the employed population 
by 25 percent, even as total population increased only 13 percent. Increased labor force 
participation resulted in a demographic dividend for the economy. However, the World 
Economic Forum 2012 Competitiveness Report scores Cabo Verde poor on labor market 
efficiency (124th out of 142 countries). A better functioning of the labor market is another 
element of the reform agenda to ensure that improvements in the qualifications of the labor force 
are reflected in higher labor productivity.  
2.2.4.2  Ensuring financial stability and expanding access to credit 
37. 
Cabo Verde’s financial sector is relatively well developed, with credit to the 
economy close to 60 percent of GDP. The financial sector is dominated by eight commercial 
banks (four larger and four smaller), which together account for about 80 percent of financial 
sector assets. There are 10 non-bank financial institutions including a venture capital firm, three 
currency exchange bureaus, a payment services provider, a leasing company, three securities 
fund management companies, and a money services provider. A public-private risk guarantee 
agency has been established to support lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but it is 
not yet operational. The stock exchange has four listed companies with a total market 
capitalization of US$91 million. There are also a number of offshore national banks, which have 
very limited linkages with the domestic economy and are poorly regulated, making them a 
source of reputational risk for the country. Most Cabo Verdeans have bank accounts at 
commercial banks. There are 1,138 bank accounts per 1,000 adults, about twice as many as in 
peer countries, which have a median of 545 accounts. The Government has started a number of 

14 

 
 
 
initiatives to improve financing for SMEs, including Novo Banco (a publicly owned commercial 
bank), CV Garante (a credit guarantee scheme), a venture capital fund, and a fund to foster 
entrepreneurship. The Government is also improving the conditions for microfinance.  
38. However, access to finance for small and medium enterprises remains a major 
obstacle in Cabo Verde. While large corporations can borrow relatively easily and at interest 
rates comparable to those in the Eurozone, SMEs, which account for 95 percent of Cabo Verde’s 
private sector companies, struggle to obtain finance. In the 2014 Global Competitiveness Report, 
access to finance is rated as the single most important constraint to doing business in Cabo 
Verde, with almost a quarter of survey respondents identifying it as a major obstacle. In addition, 
the global financial crisis and Eurozone recession have not left Cabo Verde’s banks unscathed, 
aggravating existing vulnerabilities. Some of the vulnerabilities in Cabo Verde’s financial sector 
are a consequence of the small size of the market. For example, most banks are exposed to the 
same large clients, mostly in the real estate and construction sector. This increases the risk of 
contagion from shocks across financial institutions. 
39. 
Regulatory capital ratios have been falling as asset quality has declined due to weak 
profitability. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have increased considerably since the onset of the 
global financial crisis, reaching 20 percent in September 2013. Capital asset ratios fell as banks 
built provisions, accounting for rising NPLs. The Central Bank has taken an increasingly 
proactive role in supervising banks, with a considerable amount of technical assistance from 
partners to closely monitor and address vulnerabilities in the financial sector.  
2.2.4.3 Improving infrastructure management 
40. 
Cabo Verde has taken significant steps to close its infrastructure deficits through 
high rates of public investment, which have largely been financed through an intense effort to 
mobilize external revenues. Cabo Verde now has a relatively well-developed stock of basic 
infrastructure. Nearly all of the nine inhabited islands have both marine and air access, and more 
than 72 percent of the national road network is paved, however maintenance is still an issue. The 
country has four international airports and three local airports, as well as nine seaports, seven of 
which have been modernized and expanded in the last five years. Its energy generation capacity 
is 156 MWs, of which almost 25 percent is renewable. As of 2014, more than 98 percent and 60 
percent of the population have access to electricity and running water services, respectively.  
41. Maintaining and making the most of the country’s infrastructure has become a top 
priority for Cabo Verde. For example, while the national electrification rate is high—as a 
consequence of large investments in energy—the 2014 Global Competitiveness Report ranks the 
quality of Cabo Verde’s electricity supply as very poor, with frequent and lengthy power cuts. 
And whereas much of the transport infrastructure is in good condition, inter-island connectivity 
is a major bottleneck for economic integration. Therefore, one of the most crucial challenges at 
this stage is to improve the management of electricity and transport SOEs, bringing in the private 
sector through private-public partnerships (PPPs) to improve services and maintain existing 
infrastructure.  
42. 
Energy: With support of World Bank investments and TA and development policy loans, 
since 2011, notable progress has taken place in the electricity sector, including the resolution of 
longstanding legislative and regulatory issues (passage of legislation securing electricity bill 
payment by municipalities, and more recently final adoption of new legislation to strengthen 
judicial enforcement of measures against electricity theft). Since 2012, Cabo Verde is unique in 
West Africa in having adopted and successfully implemented tariff regulation mechanisms 
which ensure full cost recovery on a sustained basis. While much remains to be done to improve 

15 

 
 
ELECTRA’s operational performance, the measures implemented by the GoCV since 2011, have 
allowed the utility company to make significant progress in key areas such as addressing the 
backlog of gen-set maintenance and improving the generation mix. In particular, the frequency 
and duration of load shedding have improved markedly since 2011 and 2012, and fuel costs have 
decreased significantly thanks to renewable generation penetration.  The government is pursuing 
the reform of ELECTRA and the scale up of its energy mix, including increasing the share of 
renewable energy. 
43. 
Ports: In 2013, the Government undertook a series of reforms with WBG support, aimed 
at increasing private sector participation in the operation and delivery of port services. These 
included review and amendment of the Law of Ports of 2010; a new regulatory framework for 
the sector; changes in the statutes of the Maritime Port Institute (Instituto Maritimo Portuario, 
IMP), which became the Port and Maritime Agency (AMP), charged with economic and 
technical regulation of the sector; and changes in ENAPOR to turn it into a concessionaire of 
existing ports, with a new legal basis for entering into sub-concession contracts.  
44. 
Air transport: One of the most difficult challenges facing the transportation sector is air 
transport. At the core of these challenges is the difficult financial position of Cabo Verde’s 
national airline, Transportes Aereos de Cabo Verde (TACV). Due to the geographic disposition 
of the Cabo Verde archipelago and the unreliability of maritime transportation between islands, 
air transportation has become the dominant transport mode for the development of tourism 
beyond the three islands with international airports, and the only practical option for reaching 
certain destinations. TACV’s financial solvency has been hampered for years by an array of 
managerial and structural issues, such as the lack of proper assessment of economically viable 
routes and ticket pricing, high labor costs, revenue leakages, lack of appropriate controls and 
financial reporting, and rapidly accumulating arrears. Large resulting losses have required 
capitalizations by the central government, which have made TACV, as currently managed, a 
fiscal liability for the state.  
2.3. OTHER DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

2.3.1 Regional Integration 
45. While Cabo Verde is a very open economy, its links with the global economy are 
highly concentrated in Western Europe. The increasing importance of the tourism industry has 
led to a commensurate dependence on the Eurozone economies. The United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Portugal, and Spain are the most important consumer markets for Cabo Verde’s 
tourism service exports, as well as the most important sources of imports and FDI inflows. These 
countries are also among the major destinations for Cabo Verdean emigrants, and together with 
the United States they represent the main source of remittances. In addition, donor institutions of 
Portugal, Spain, and the European Union (EU) have been major sources of ODA inflows. The 
exchange rate peg to the euro also reinforces the ties with Europe. In addition, in 2007, Cabo 
Verde and the EU signed a Special Partnership Agreement (SPA), which offers Cabo Verde 
access to European internal markets as well as the possibility to gradually take part in certain EU 
policies and programs. The agreement also encompasses the possibility of funding from the 
European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in the framework of cooperation with the 
outermost regions and other budget lines managed by the European Commission. 
46. 
Despite some increase in the last years, Cabo Verde’s trade, investments and 
migration flows with the Africa Region are marginal. Cabo Verde is part of ECOWAS, but its 
share of exports and imports to the other 13 members of ECOWAS constitute barely 2 percent of 
total trade flows. For many years, ECOWAS regional integration was slow and uneven, but this 

16 

 
 
process has recently been accelerated, especially due to the adoption of the ECOWAS common 
external tariff, expected to begin in January, 1, 2015, and the ongoing negotiations on the West 
Africa Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU. Furthermore, the protracted 
recovery of the Eurozone countries and Cabo Verde’s overall diversification strategy suggest that 
integration with the Africa Region and other markets needs to be explored, in view of the 
potential now arising from trade with emerging economies. The GPRSP III recognizes the need 
to diversify Cabo Verde’s partnerships, and this CPS will further strengthen Cabo Verde’s 
regional cooperation, with the inclusion of Cabo Verde in West Africa regional programs, 
including the ongoing West Africa Regional Fisheries Program and the upcoming West Africa 
Agricultural Productivity Program. 
2.3.2 Statistical capacity 
47. 
Cabo Verde’s statistical development is weak for a middle-income country (Annex 
3).  According to the World Bank’s statistical capacity index, Cabo Verde scored 66 in 2013, 
above the averages of 63 and 60 for IDA countries and Sub-Saharan African countries 
respectively, but well below the IBRD average of 75. The main constraints include lack of 
predictable funding, dependence on donor support for the implementation of surveys and 
censuses, and the scarce human resource capacities associated with the small size and geographic 
fragmentation of the country. The low and unpredictable funding and limited technical capacity 
led to (a) infrequent and limited quality of micro- and macro-data; (b) weak systems and 
analytical capacity to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of public policies; (c) undeveloped 
systems to archive, disseminate and grant access to statistical products and indicators.  Several 
donors, including the World Bank through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, as 
well as the African Development Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors are currently providing TA 
to the National Statistics Institute (INE).   

III. GOVERNMENT VISION 

48. 
The challenges identified above are reflected in the GPRSP III, which lays out Cabo 
Verde’s transition to a productivity-driven economic model. The GPRSP III entails several 
important policy shifts compared with previous poverty reduction strategies. The most important 
is significantly greater emphasis on the structural reforms needed to improve the country’s 
competitiveness. The GPRSP III sets out an ambitious structural reform agenda to improve the 
efficiency of public sector investment and SOE service delivery, enhance the investment climate, 
and reform the labor market to raise productivity and foster private sector development. Gender 
is identified as a cross-cutting issue in the GPRSP III, with the Cabo Verde Institute for Gender 
Equality and Equity (ICIEG) responsible for implementing its gender-related objectives. The 
CPS and the GPRSP III are closely aligned across all these areas.  
49. 
A notable shift is the focus on eliminating extreme poverty through the development 
and modernization of the agriculture and fisheries sectors, and promoting shared 
prosperity by strengthening the linkages of the tourism sector with these primary sectors. 
Because of the untapped potential of the agriculture sector, and, given the strong incidence of 
extreme poverty in rural areas, the GPRSP III directs special attention to enhancing agricultural 
productivity and its linkages with the tourism sector by, for example, increasing the use of Cabo 
Verdean agriculture products by tourism operators. In addition, policies on human capital 
development, in particular TVET, are priority areas to boost shared prosperity 
50. 
The GPRSP III supports the development of these seven economic clusters through 
interventions organized under five areas of intervention, or axes:    

17 

 
 
 Infrastructure. Policies under this axis are designed to alleviate remaining infrastructure 
bottlenecks through completion of the Government’s public investment program in 
energy, multi-modal transportation (seaports, airports and road transportation), and water 
mobilization and irrigation facilities. The GPRSP III pays particular attention to 
institutional and managerial reforms in the energy and transportation sectors, as 
infrastructure assets in these sectors have been completed in the recent years.  
 Developing Human Capital. Interventions under this axis have two objectives: (a) to 
create a more competitive labor force and ensure that growth is sufficiently inclusive to 
improve income distribution; and (b) to strengthen Cabo Verde’s global competitiveness 
in technology-intensive industries. Programs under this pillar are viewed as fundamental 
for the promotion of sustainable and shared prosperity.  
 Good Governance. The objectives of this axis are to (a) bolster the country’s resilience 
to adverse shocks by strengthening its macro-fiscal position; and (b) increase the 
effectiveness of public service delivery, including new initiatives in critical areas such as 
the national planning system, public investment management, the government-wide 
M&E system, statistical development, and the oversight and reform of SOEs.  
 Support to the Private Sector.  The overarching focus of the GPRSP III is to shift 
responsibility for the country’s economic development to the private sector. This axis 
includes specific measures to expand trade openness, improve the tax system, promote 
financial sector stability, and enhance the overall business and investment climate, and 
increased private sector participation in infrastructure service delivery. The GPRSP III 
clearly depicts the Government’s role as a catalyst and facilitator of the new economic 
model it proposes.  
 Development of Global Partnerships.  In an environment of declining aid flows and 
reduced access to concessional financing, Cabo Verde still requires intense resource 
mobilization and technical assistance from both traditional and new partners. Hence the 
GPRSP III calls for comprehensive plan to diversify sources of funding to include new 
bilateral trading partners such as China, Brazil, the Middle East, and the West Africa 
region.  

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

4.1. LESSONS LEARNED AND PROCESS OF CONSULTATION 
 The proposed CPS builds on the achievements of the previous CPS11. The Bank 
51. 
Group’s CPS for Cabo Verde and its program of support activities were designed to assist the 
Government in achieving the higher-level development goals that were outlined in its second 
Growth and Poverty and Reduction Strategy Paper for 2008-2011. The performance of the 
previous CPS-supported program (FY09-FY12) was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, mainly 
due to slow implementation of pillar three (Strengthening Human Capital and Social Inclusion). 
As detailed in Annex 4, substantial outcomes were achieved under pillar 1 (Promoting Good 
Governance and Public Sector Capacity), and to some extent under pillar II (Improving 
Competitiveness and the Investment Climate for Private Sector Growth).  
52. 
The approach of the CPS is informed by lessons learned from the implementation of the 
previous CPS, including: 

11 The previous CPS was not a joint a WBG product; it was only a World Bank product. 

18 

 
 
                                                            
 Use of instruments: Cabo Verde’s experience in transport and energy demonstrates how 
policy reforms under the PRSC series, combined with operational support under 
investment projects, can be mutually reinforcing. Going forward, the WBG should 
continue the approach of combining sectoral policy work with investment projects.  
 Selectivity: Given the limited IDA/IBRD allocation for Cabo Verde, the WBG program 
will be highly selective; a maximum of two operations per year would be the norm. 
 South-South cooperation: As an emerging middle-income country, Cabo Verde could 
become a focal point for South-South learning. The Bank has already supported 
successful exchanges on policy and institutional reform issues with Mauritius and 
Seychelles, and on performance-based road management with Brazil, through the South-
South Exchange Trust Fund.  
 Statistics development: The WBG will continue to assist the Government in statistical 
capacity building. Together with AfDB, the WBG is coordinating on the statistics 
agenda through the multi-donor Budget Support Group. 
53. 
This CPS will build on the ongoing program (Table 4), which is composed of 
investment operations in the infrastructure sectors (energy. transport), productive sector (e.g., 
fisheries) and private sector development, complemented by budget support. The portfolio is 
performing well with zero problem or potential problem projects. The US$83 million portfolio 
will be complemented by the new projects coming on stream under this CPS.

The preparation of this CPS was informed by broad in-country consultations with 
the Government, civil society and the private sector. Apart from ongoing policy dialogue, 
consultations took place during a CPS consultation mission in January 2014, during which WBG 
staff presented the findings of the CEM and discussed the proposed CPS.  Civil society and 
private sector actors were consulted during a public forum held in Praia on January 22, 2014.

55. Gender is identified as a cross-cutting issue in the GPRSP III, with the Cabo Verde 
Institute for Gender Equality and Equity (ICIEG) responsible for implementing its gender-related 
objectives. This CPS is informed by the Government’s gender assessment as presented in the 
July 2013 Progress Report on Implementation of the Millennium Development 2010-2011-2012; 
as well as by a Gender Portfolio Review12 conducted by the World Bank Africa Region Gender 
Practice Group in 2013, the Country Economic Memorandum, and in-country consultations with 
the ICIEG. The WBG regards these combined assessments and consultations as constituting a 
full country gender assessment, as laid out in OP/BP 4.20. The findings and conclusions indicate 
that the following issues require immediate attention: (a) improved water and sanitation for rural 
women; (b) increased economic opportunities for young women in the formal sector; and (c) 
technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for women. Since the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation is addressing the water and sanitation issues and the Luxembourg 
Cooperation is focusing on TVET, the WBG will focus on creating more economic 
opportunities, especially for young women whose high levels of human development have yet to 
be 
translated 
into equal opportunities 
in the formal sector, 13 through 
the proposed 

12 The 2013 Cabo Verde Gender Portfolio Review, completed as a background paper for the CPS, provides an 
overview of the current state of gender in the country as well as an assessment of the coverage of gender in the 
World Bank portfolio.  
13 The parity index for gross enrollment ratio in higher education in the academic years 2011/2012 was 1.42; i.e., for 
every 142 women in higher education there were only 100 men. One third of women—33.5 percent—aged 15-24 
years were unemployed in 2011, well above the overall unemployment rate of 27.1 percent, and 22.1 percent for 
men of the same age . Also for the age group ≥ 15 years the rate of unemployment for women is 13.2 percent, 
compared to 11.4 percent for men.  Briefly, unemployment affects women more. (Source: Progress Report on 
Implementation of the Millennium Development 2010-2011-2012).

Competitiveness for Tourism Development Project as well as the West Africa Agricultural 
Productivity Program. 
56. 
The Gender Portfolio Review conducted by the World Bank Africa Region Gender 
Practice Group in 2013 found that only 20 percent14 of the Bank’s portfolio for Cabo Verde 
is gender informed. The review also looked at four Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) 
and found that only one out of four activities was gender informed. The low integration of 
gender in the portfolio may be partly explained by the fact that Cabo Verde is already performing 
well in the areas in which the WBG tends to be strong on gender mainstreaming, such as health 
and education. However, more support is required in other areas, such as gender-based violence. 
Gender-informed activities in the current portfolio include support to women-run MSMEs and a 
gender-informed analysis of human capital and labor market issues. The Poverty and Gender 
assessment to be carried out under this CPS will further inform the mainstreaming of gender in 
projects supported by this CPS.  
57. 
The proposed CPS aims to increase the gender sensitivity of the portfolio by:  
 
Increasing attention to gender in the area of economic opportunity through the proposed 
program on competitiveness; 
Increasing attention to gender empowerment through the program on agriculture 
development;  
 Ensuring that future projects are consistent and coherent in addressing gender across 
analysis, actions, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).  

 

4.2. WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR FY15-17 
58. 
The objective of the proposed CPS for FY15-17 is to provide a framework for 
supporting the implementation of GPRSP III, as the previous CPS did for GPRSP II. The 
proposed CPS will be structured around two complementary pillars: (a) enhancing macro-fiscal 
stability, setting the foundations for renewed growth; and (b) improving competitiveness and 
private sector development. This represents a continuation of the two successful pillars under the 
previous CPS, with some adjustments, to respond to the country’s needs as articulated in the 
GPRSP III. To the extent possible, the Bank, IFC and MIGA will carry out joint or 
complementary programs in the transport and energy sectors that have great potential in terms of 
PPPs. The Bank will focus on the policy agenda and IFC and MIGA will bring in their expertise 
and financing tools for PPPs. In the tourism sector, IFC will complement the Bank’s 
interventions by exploring financing for hotel operators as well as possible support to improve 
the linkage between the tourism and agriculture sectors. The World Bank and IFC teams will 
also work together on improving the investment climate.   More detailed information per pillar 
follows. 
Pillar I: Enhancing Macro-Fiscal Stability – Setting the foundation for renewed growth 
59. 
As a small island economy, Cabo Verde is highly vulnerable to external 
macroeconomic volatility. Its heavy reliance on tourism export receipts, FDI, and ODA makes 
the country highly sensitive to changes in global market conditions and critical macroeconomic 
buffers have been severely strained by the impact of the global financial and Eurozone crises. 
Under its new growth model supported by this CPS, the Government will need to enhance 
domestic resource mobilization and improve the cost-effectiveness of its spending.  

14 This rate is well below the IDA-16 target of 60 percent of gender-informed activities.  

21 

 
 
 
                                                            
60. 
Link to the WBG twin goals: the objective of Pillar I is the enhancement of macro-
fiscal stability to support the authorities’ efforts to boost domestic resources and improve the 
public investment system to ensure high-quality investment, in addition to reducing fiscal risks 
and improving service delivery by promoting a set of priority reforms focusing on the 
performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  Activities under Pillar I are  expected to create 
some additional fiscal space, which in turn, if put to good use, could expand the ability of the 
Government to invest in social sectors and accelerate human capital formation and raise the 
employability of the labor force. The second objective of making public expenditures more 
efficient is expected to reinforce these effects. Raising the quality of public spending can 
improve service delivery, both coverage and quality, especially among those living in the islands 
that benefit relatively less from tourism and are more dependent on agriculture. More and better 
public services will enable a broader fraction of the population, particularly low and middle 
income individuals, to benefit from more diversified growth, contributing to poverty reduction 
and enhancing shared prosperity.  Pillar I outcomes are summarized in Table 5; a more detailed 
discussion, per outcome follows the table.

*Related WBG instruments are reflected in the Results Matrix (Annex 1) 

61. Outcome 1: Improved tax revenues: Cabo Verde’s attractiveness to private investment 
has been enhanced by a generous system of fiscal incentives; however, this system has negative 
implications for fiscal revenues. Building on the achievement of the previous series, the PRSCs 
series will support the tax-policy agenda for 2014-15 to enable the tax authority to expedite 
collection procedures, reduce tax evasion and accelerate the clearance of tax arrears.  
62. Outcome 2: Improved public expenditure efficiency: The public sector efficiency 
reform agenda will focus on three main areas: (i) SOE reform; (ii) strengthening the national 
public investment system is also critical to ensure that public resources are allocated to projects 
with high rates of financial, economic and social returns; and(iii) continuation of PFM reforms.  
63. World Bank instruments include development policy operations, sector investments 
and knowledge products.    
 The PRSCs series VIII-XI will be the main Bank instrument for the support to Pillar I.     
Specific activities will include the preparation of result-based management contracts 
between the MoFP and the major SOEs; the strengthening of the national investment 
system (NIS) and the consolidation of major PFM reform, including the full use of the 
electronic financial management system (SIGOF); the monitoring of fiscal liabilities 
related to state-owned enterprises; and improved external audits and controls.  

22 

 
 
 The Economic Governance/Public Sector Efficiency Project will strengthen the SOE 
Unit (within the Ministry of Finance) capacity to monitor performance contracts, 
including progress toward achieving financial and service delivery targets. It will also 
support the implementation of the action plan prepared jointly by the World Bank and 
IMF on the basis of the PEMFAR. 
 The ongoing IDA Transport Sector Reform Project (US$19 million) will support the 
implementation of transport sector State Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform. This will be 
complemented by IFC support for the development of selected PPP transactions. 
 The ongoing IBRD Electricity Sector Project (US$53.5 million) will continue to 
support implementation of the performance contract for ELECTRA. 
64. 
Analytical work will include the following: 
 An SOE Policy Note will help analyze options to improve SOEs’ fiscal management and 
service performance. This note will inform the preparation of the proposed Economic 
Governance/Public Sector Efficiency Project. 
 An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant will support implementation of the 3-
year action plan to enhance the efficiency of the NIS. The grant will also establish a 
project appraisal unit at the Ministry of Finance, which will be responsible for screening 
and selecting investment projects.  
65. 
Donor Coordination: In line with the division of labor among development partners (see 
Annex 2), the World Bank is taking the lead on macroeconomic stability in coordination with 
other Budget Support Group (BSG) members. Under the Memorandum of Understanding signed 
with the Government in 200615, the BSG supports the Government’s current GPRSP III in ten 
policy areas. BSG members conduct joint reviews twice a year, which reduce transaction costs 
for the Government and promote harmonization. The Bank is the current BSG coordinator. The 
BSG coordination mechanism has proven to be effective in facilitating the division of labor 
among the BSG members. It has also helped improve donor harmonization. For example, in the 
absence of an IMF program, the Bank has assumed the responsibility of providing 
macroeconomic assessments to the other BSG members, in close coordination with the IMF’s 
Washington-based team. The mechanism has also enhanced the Government’s ability to attract 
additional external budget support. However, the BSG coordination mechanism will need to be 
expanded to include non-BSG members. The WBG will work with the Government to further 
integrate all active donors in the mechanism. 
Pillar II: Improving Competitiveness and Private Sector Development 
66. 
Under Pillar II, the CPS supports the objective of improving competiveness and 
private sector development by focusing on three areas: (a) improving investment climate, (b) 
enhancing the performance of the tourism sector and agricultural productivity, and (c) supporting 
enabling sectors (energy and roads).  
67. 
Link to the WBG strategic goals: enhancing competitiveness and the business climate 
will improve the functioning of markets. In turn, complete and competitive markets are central to 
achieving more efficient utilization of the productive assets of households, in particular their 
labor and human capital. This is of high importance in the context of Cabo Verde, where the 
unemployment rate has remained high, even in periods of strong economic growth—more than

half of the economically active population is employed in informal jobs; and labor force 
participation is substantially lower among some groups of the population (women and youth), 
despite increases in school enrollment and attainment. Improving the business climate, reducing 
production costs (e.g. increasing the efficiency of the electricity sector), improving connectivity 
through better management of the road network, and improving the productivity of critical 
sectors (e.g. agriculture) will increase the accessibility of the poor to markets, strengthen the 
demand for their labor.  Pillar II outcomes are summarized in Table 6; a more detailed 
discussion, per outcome follows the table.

68. Outcome 3: Improved investment climate:  From 2010 to 2011, an aggressive reform 
agenda produced strong improvements in Cabo Verde’s business climate.  
69. World Bank Group instruments: This CPS will support further actions to improve the 
investment climate, and instruments will include the PRSC series, sector specific projects as well 
as participation of IFC.     
 The PRSCs VIII-XI series will support the establishment of a single window system for 
investments, which will significantly expedite the registry and licensing of operations by 
foreign investors, and the provision of tax benefits. 
 Competitiveness for Tourism Development Project will assist the Government in 
implementing investment climate reforms under the Government’s "Move to Compete" 
program to improve competitiveness; including the strengthening of the investment 
promotion agency, the establishment of a national tourism organization, and the creation 
of an investment marketplace to encourage innovation in startups.   
 IFC is exploring financing for hotel projects to complement the WB’s investment in 
the tourism sector. IFC will also work with a commercial bank to create a facility to 
support trade under the IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP), and a credit line 
(or equity participation).  

70. 

Analytical work and technical assistance will include the following: 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Financial Sector Assessment Program. Building on the financial sector strategy 
prepared with Bank’s support, the FSAP will carry out an in-depth review of financial 
sector performance.  
 The Leveraging the Diaspora ESW will explore the scope for expanding the role of the 
diaspora in developing the country's economy. 
71. Outcome 4a: Improved Electricity Sector Performance. With World Bank support, 
the Government has implemented the key elements of a comprehensive reform program for the 
electricity sector and the public electric and water utility, including a result-based management 
contract.  
72. World Bank Group instruments: This CPS, through the series of PSRCs and ongoing 
investment operations, will support further actions to improve operational efficiency in the 
energy and transport sectors, including ELECTRA’s financial viability.  
 PRSCs series will continue to support policy reforms aiming at reducing 
ELECTRA’s commercial and technical losses.  
 The ongoing IBRD Electricity Sector Project will support priority investments in the 
electricity sector that will allow ELECTRA to meet the electricity needs of a growing 
economy, including the extension of Palmarejo Power Plant in Praia (Island of Santiago), 
and extension of Lazareto Power Plant in Mindelo (Island of Sao Vicente). The project 
will also support additional water storage capacity. 
 Support to support renewable projects will be provided, under the WB/IFC new initiative, 
Scale Up Solar energy, in a way that would help leverage other sources of funding (IBRD 
funds, private investors, IFC lending and equity, carbon funds, etc.).  
73. Outcome 4b: Improved management of National Roads Network: with World Bank 
support, steady progress has been achieved in the institutional reform of the road sector, 
including the creation of a road maintenance fund, the establishment of a dedicated road agency 
(Instituto de Estradas IE), and the introduction of a four-year performance-based rehabilitation 
and maintenance contract (PBC).  
74. WBG instruments: this CPS will continue its support to the transport sector to 
consolidate these achievements through a mix of World Bank and IFC instruments.  
 The ongoing IDA Transport Sector Reform Project will help improve efficiency and 
management of its national road assets, and support reform of the transport sector SOEs.  
 IFC, together with MIGA, will complement this by supporting the implementation of 
selected PPP transactions in the sector. 
 The PRSCs series will support the introduction of performance-based management tools 
for maintenance of about 60 percent of the paved road network. 
75. 
Outcome 5: Increased agricultural productivity and linkages to markets: in order to 
address current sector challenges and promote the role of agriculture as a fundamental sector for 
poverty reduction and growth, there is a need to increase agricultural productivity. 
76. WBG instruments will include the following:   
 Cabo Verde will join the program under the regional West Africa Agricultural 
Productivity Project for Capo Verde (WAAPP-1D) series whose objective will be to 
generate and accelerate the adoption of improved technologies for the country’s key 

25 

 
 
agricultural commodities that are aligned with the sub-region’s top agricultural 
commodity priorities.  
 The Competitiveness for Tourism Development Project will foster linkages with the 
tourism value chain, including those in the fisheries and agriculture sectors. 
 IFC is exploring financing for hotel projects for which it will support linkages between 
the tourism and the agriculture sectors. 
77. 
Analytical work will include: 
 An agriculture sector review will assess the agricultural sector in Cabo Verde through: 
(a) a review of current agriculture sector strategies and policies; and, (b) an identification 
of key intervention areas for value chain development based on the country's comparative 
advantage in promising value chains. The study will highlight both poverty- and growth-
based impacts of the proposed interventions, and will guide the preparation of the 
proposed WAAPP-1D.  
78. 
Donor coordination: in line with the division of labor among development partners (see 
annex 2), the WBG will focus on competitiveness and infrastructure development. This will be 
done closely with the African Development Bank (AfDB). In the absence of other donors’ 
interventions, the WBG will explore new interventions in the agriculture sector, a cornerstone for 
poverty reduction; and in the tourism sector as the leading driver of growth in Cabo Verde. For 
other sectors with no WBG financing, such as human development, where the UN agencies, EU 
and Luxembourg are leading, the WBG will play a supporting role by focusing on policy and 
structural reforms through its PRSC series, and on selected knowledge products. Similarly, the 
WBG will work closely with the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Japan, which are 
leading on other infrastructure sectors, such as water and sanitation.  
4.3. FINANCING OF THE PROGRAM 
79. 
The indicative IDA17 envelope is SDR 32 million, equivalent to US$49.5 million for 
FY15-FY17 16 . Cabo Verde will also have access to IBRD resources during the CPS period. 
IBRD lending limits will depend on country performance, IBRD's lending capacity, demand by 
other borrowers and global economic developments. The indicative program is shown in Table 7. 

16 Using the exchange rate 1.54563$/SDR. The actual exchange rate for each operation depends on the applicable 
prevailing rate at the time of approval. The amounts shown in outer years are indicative only. Actual allocations will 
depend on: (i) the total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance rating, per capita GNI, and 
population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits); (iv) the allocation deductions associated with MDRI 
annual debt service foregone as applicable; (v) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance 
terms for other IDA borrowers; and (vi) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

4.4. RISKS AND MITIGATION  
80. 
Implementation of this CPS will face three main types of risks: external, domestic 
and operational. External risks are associated with the uncertain global economic scenario. The 
recovery of the global economy remains anemic and uncertain, and there are significant 
downside risks associated with major developed economies, especially the Eurozone. A further 
deterioration in external conditions would have detrimental effects on Cabo Verde’s growth 
trajectory and puts at risk the delivery of the development policy loans. This risk is rated 
substantial. Together with the IMF (the country is under Article IV arrangement), the Bank, 
through its PRSC series, will provide mitigation measures aimed at enhancing macro-fiscal 
stability and the country’s resilience to both internal and external shocks. In addition, the Bank 
will have flexibility in the type of financial instruments deployed to address changing country 
conditions. 
81. 
A set of domestic risks arises from the private sector’s ability and willingness to 
respond positively to the Government’s structural reform agenda. A pivotal assumption 
behind the structural reforms supported by the PRSC series is that the private sector will become 
the country’s primary engine of economic growth as the Government scales back its investment 
program. However, it is unknown whether the incentives created by the Government’s strategy 
will be sufficient to induce the level of private-sector growth that the strategy envisions; this 
could potentially put at risk the reform program supported by this CPS. This risk is rated modest 
as the robustness of the structural reform agenda, the active participation of the private sector in 
the preparation of the GPRSP III and permanent dialogue between the Government and private 
stakeholders should mitigate these risks. Through its focus on infrastructure development and 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SOE reform, the proposed WBG programs, including the active role of IFC and MIGA, will 
provide the financial and technical support and guarantees that will help crowd in private sector 
participation.  
82. 
There are also political economy risks for sensitive reforms. Some of the proposed 
reform operations under this CPS will require parliamentary approval and are likely to face some 
resistance. The Government has been very effective in building consensus on the diagnosis of the 
country’s development challenges and the need for reforms during the preparation of the GPRSP 
III.  But, given that the next national elections will be in 2016 making 2015 a pre-election year, 
ambitious reforms will become less likely and the risk is substantial. The reform agenda to be 
supported by this CPS, notably the PRSC series in FY15 and FY16, is being accompanied by a 
communication strategy which involves representatives of the private sector, the managers of 
SOEs, civil servants and other stakeholders.  
83. 
Finally, operational risks are still considerable. While by regional standards Cabo 
Verde’s institutional and technical capacity is strong, the limited number of technical staff in 
several core ministries poses substantial implementation risks. The reform of SOEs is 
particularly challenging, as it involves special processes that are not routine for the relevant 
agencies. To address these risks, the WBG and other development partners have made available 
a combination of capacity building assistance, technical support and sector-specific investment 
operations, which will substantially improve prospects for success in the reform areas supported 
by this operation.

been a source of contingent 
liabilities for the Government of 
Cabo Verde due to their generally 
weak commercial and financial 
performance 

Public investment averaged 11.3 % 
of GDP between 2009-2012 which 
contributed to worsen fiscal accounts 
and was responsible for 25 % decline 
in fiscal balances

Annex 3: Statistics in Cabo Verde 
Cabo Verde’s statistical development is weak for a middle income country.  According to 
the World Bank’s statistical capacity index, Cabo Verde scored 66 in 2013, above the averages 
of 63 and 60 for IDA countries and Sub-Saharan African countries respectively, but well below 
the IBRD average of 75. The main constraints include the lack of predictable funding, the 
dependence on donor support for the implementation of surveys and censuses, and the scarce 
human resource capacities associated with the small size and with the geographic fragmentation 
of the country.  
There are a number of shortfalls. The last household survey was performed in 2007 and a 
national census was conducted in 2010 with the support of international development partners. A 
light poverty study was conducted in 2012 as part of the preparation of the third edition of the 
GPRSP III with the support of the World Bank.  The preparation of official national accounts 
was interrupted in 2008 and a new GDP series including recent years was only presented in 
January 2013, updated to the UN accounting methodology of 1993. However, national accounts 
data continue to be produced with a considerable time lag, beyond what is foreseen in national 
law. Employment surveys are scarce and are, similarly, not released in a timely manner; the 
latest information on unemployment rate corresponds to 2012. Cabo Verde does not have a 
tourism satellite account which could provide thorough information on the most important 
economic sector of the country.  
The GPRSP III considers the National Statistics System, led by the national statistics 
institute, INE, a fundamental pillar of the National System of Planning.  Throughout 2012 
and 2013, the government approved a set of decrees to define and strengthen the institutional 
capacity of the National Statistics System including new statutes for INE and a new organic 
structure, the establishment of the National Statistics Council; and complementary regulations 
granting INE more power to collect information from public agencies and private sector. Several 
donors, including the World Bank through the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, as 
well as the African Development Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors are currently providing TA 
to the INE. 
For 2014, the main new outputs in terms of surveys from INE include the household survey 
of expenses and revenues – which will provide critical data to update the poverty analysis; the 
demographic and reproductive health survey which will update important health indicators 
(pertinent also for MDG measuring); and the General Agricultural Survey, a comprehensive 
operation that will provide critical data for fine tuning of agro-business policy decisions in this 
critical primary sector as noted in the GPRSP III.

I – INTRODUCTION  

Annex 4: CPS Completion Report (FY09-12)  

A. Methodology  
1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) presents an assessment 
of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Cabo Verde for FY09-12, supported jointly by the 
International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD) – collectively “the Bank.” The report evaluates (a) the CPS support 
program’s performance in achieving or influencing the objectives set out in the CPS results 
matrix; and (b) the Bank’s performance in designing and implementing the program.  Although 
IFC did not participate in the CPS support program, IFC was active in projects to improve access 
to finance to SMEs and infrastructure projects development during the period, which are noted in 
the report.   

2. 
This self–assessment was conducted in line with the OPCS guidelines related to 
“Assessing Country Partnerships Strategies: A shared approach” dated November 2013. Based 
on the assessment, the overall CPS outcome is rated as moderately unsatisfactory as only Pillar 1 
is rated satisfactory, while pillar 2 and 3 are both rated moderately unsatisfactory. The World 
Bank performance is rated fair. As outlined in Table 1, Pillar 117 is rated satisfactory, as 2 of its 
objectives were fully achieved and 1 mostly achieved; Pillar 2 is rated moderately unsatisfactory 
with one objective out of 2 mostly achieved; and Pillar 3 is rated moderately unsatisfactory as 
both of its objectives were only partially achieved.

B. Summary of Program and Bank Performance 

3. 
The Bank’s CPS for Cabo Verde and its program of support activities were designed to 
assist the Government of Cabo Verde in achieving the higher-level development goals outlined 
in its second Growth and Poverty and Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP II) for 2008-2011. The 
overall Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) rating is a weighted measure of progress made toward 
achieving all major CPS objectives as detailed in Annex 1. Most CPS program activities were 
concentrated under the GPRSP’s Pillar One, “Promoting Good Governance and Public Sector 
Capacity.” Great strides were made during the CPS period to enhance the use of public resources 
and its transparency, to better manage debt and strengthen the regulatory and oversight role of 
the public administration. The program also carried out activities under Pillar Two, 
“Improving Competitiveness and the Investment Climate for Private Sector-Led Growth.”  
Under that pillar, program activities helped raise the country’s Doing Business ranking from 
146th in 2010 to 122nd in 2012 mainly through the simplification of firms’ closure procedures, 
reduction of registering costs and a more transparent and predictable investment code, and to 
expand the administrative services readily available to citizen and investors. The program helped 
to lay the foundation for development of the energy sector, and also contributed to satisfactory 
progress in the road transport sector. Progress in the air transport sector, however, has been 
modest and objectives are expected to appear in the next CPS. In the fisheries sector, the 
program successfully established fisheries management tools and is on track to reach the 
expected results. Under Pillar Three, “Strengthening Human Capital and Social Inclusion,” the 
program partially achieved its goals. In the education sector and the technical and vocational 
education and training (TVET) sector, the Bank’s program was limited to technical assistance 
(TA); while investments were supported by other development partners (DPs) and, due to the 
hard fiscal constraints, Government contributions have been limited. The program also supported 
the Government’s social inclusion agenda through the establishment of legal centers staffed with 
legal counselors. However, the planned evaluations of poverty, gender and other social impact 
investments, as well as the household surveys for poverty, were not carried out.  The four 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) over the three-year period (PRSCs IV-VII), have 
provided a strong knowledge base for preparation of the next CPS.  

4. 
Bank performance and implementation are rated fair overall. The CPS program 
design and objectives were relevant and well-aligned with the objectives of the GPRSP II. In 
spite of the adverse environment following the global and euro crisis, particularly difficult for 
CV and other small island economies, the Bank maintained a productive dialogue with the 
Government throughout implementation of the program. The indicators in the results matrix 
were, for the most part, appropriate to measure CPS objectives, although some had weak logical 
links with those objectives and were not realistically aligned with the CPS timeframe. The 
Bank’s program also included risk identification and mitigation efforts (see paras. 38-39), with 
the provision of TA to assist the Government in weathering the impacts of the global financial 
crisis and defining realistic targets for the CPS. As an active member of the Joint Budget Support 
Group (BSG), 18 the Bank also played a key role in harmonizing the aid architecture in the

country. Additionally, the Bank demonstrated timely flexibility by increasing its IDA allocation 
for Cabo Verde to mitigate the reduction in concessional financing. An Independent Evaluation 
Group (IEG) review of projects closed during the CPS period rated three out of four projects 
Satisfactory. However, IEG noted that cost overruns reduced the value for money in two out of 
three investment projects. IEG also found room for improvement in the design, implementation, 
and use of monitoring and evaluation (M&E).  Finally, the strong commitment of the Bank’s 
country team ensured that the portfolio was managed proactively to quickly adjust to changing 
circumstances within the targeted sectors.  

C. Economic and Sociopolitical Context  

5. 
During the CPS period, Cabo Verde consolidated its position as a service-based 
economy and graduated from Least Developed Countries, per the UN’s classification in 2007. 
With a GNI per capita of US$3,540, the country is firmly placed in the lower-middle income 
countries group, per the Bank’s classification.19  The effects of the global financial crisis and the 
ongoing Eurozone crisis on Cabo Verde have been strongly negative.  GDP growth dropped 
from 6.2 % in 2008 to -1.3 % in 2009 and recovered modestly to 1.5 % in 2010. GDP growth 
rate increased to 4 % in 2011, but the worsening of the Eurozone crisis has prevented the 
consolidation of the recovery trend. GDP growth rate increased to 4 % in 2011, but the 
worsening of the Eurozone crisis has prevented the consolidation of the recovery trend. Cabo 
Verde’s GDP growth slowed again to 1.2% in 2012 and weak growth is also estimated for 2013 
(0.5 %) and 2014 (2-3 %).  The country’s development vision is rooted in the need to leverage its 
geo-strategic position and its natural and cultural assets.  Capital accumulation and the expansion 
of the tourism industry have been the driving forces of the country’s economic growth. The 
tourism sector accounts for around 20 % of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in the 
tourism and real estate sectors represent more than 90 % of total FDI flows to the country. 
Private investments have driven the rapid development of tourism facilities and related real 
estate construction activities, while public investments have financed the development of 
transportation infrastructure services and energy supply.  

6. 
Rapid economic growth during most of the 2000s has also translated into improved 
social conditions. Poverty in Cabo Verde dropped from 37 % in 2000 to 27 % in 2010, and the 
country is currently on track to achieve nearly all of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
by 2015. In general, these successes are, however, weakened by relatively high unemployment in 
the country, especially among vulnerable groups such as women and youth. 

7. 
The two most recent rounds of national elections, both held in 2011, brought about a 
novel arrangement in Cabo Verdean politics. For the first time, the President and Prime Minister 
are supported by the main opposing parties: the MpD (Movimento para a Democracia - 
Movement for Democracy) and PAICV (Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde - 
African Party for the Independence of Cabo Verde), respectively. The transition and 
subsequent power sharing exercise between the MpD and the PAICV have been going 
smoothly.  Although there are concerns that the two parties might have different visions of how

to implement reforms, the country has so far benefited from the leadership of an administratively 
competent Government in a stable political environment. 

8. 
This political stability and economic growth that have made possible CV’s transition to a 
MIC (Middle Income Country) also bring new challenges including those related to debt 
monitoring and access to concessional finance. During the CPS period, Cabo Verde experienced 
a significant increase in its debt burden, with the public debt stock increasing from 67.9 % of 
GDP in 2008 to 88 % in 2012. Based on a recent stochastic debt sustainability analysis (DSA) 
prepared by the Bank team, the present trajectory of public debt is expected to remain sustainable 
in the long term, but significant vulnerabilities will persist in the short and medium terms. The 
declining access to concessional finance and rapid debt accumulation are expected to increase 
borrowing costs and reduce the fiscal space needed to sustain high public investment rates. The 
ongoing European sovereign debt crisis has already reduced FDI flows and FDI-funded private 
investments. Additionally, the heavy reliance on an undiversified set of economic drivers, and 
the small domestic labor pool and consumer market, limit the potential for economies of scale 
across sectors.  Other factors, such as high unit costs of core infrastructure and public goods 
arising from indivisibilities in public goods supply, along with the high transport costs and 
significant exposure to natural hazards characteristic of small island economies, could 
compromise Cabo Verde’s natural capital, which is its main tourism attraction. 

9. 
Looking forward, the intensive capital accumulation and growth in the tourism 
sector that enabled Cabo Verde to graduate from Least-Developed Country status is 
unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term. Consequently, Cabo Verde faces what may be its 
greatest development policy challenge to date: how to adapt its development model to its new 
economic and financial circumstances, and still sustain high growth and competitiveness in the 
face of its vulnerability to global macroeconomic fluctuations.  During the CPS period, Cabo 
Verde was able to effectively use fiscal tools to partially insulate itself from global shocks, and 
to boost public investment while maintaining control over current expenditures. Going forward, 
in order to meet the challenges of transitioning to MIC status, the Government must now build 
the foundation for enhanced macroeconomic resilience and facilitate a new growth model that 
encourages improved productivity and human capital development rather than physical 
accumulation, while still closely monitoring its vulnerability to external shocks.    

II – CPS Program Performance  

A. Program Overview and Principles of Engagement  

10. 
The GPRSP II for 2008-2011 put strong emphasis on infrastructure and private 
sector development to support growth and reduce poverty.  In support of the GPRSP, the 
CPS also focused on sustaining high levels of growth and reducing unemployment, poverty, and 
inequality.  The five strategic pillars of the GPRSP II were:  (a) promotion of Government 
reform; (b) development of human resources; (c) enhancing competitiveness; (d) investment in 
the country’s economic infrastructure; and (e) strengthening social cohesion.  The CPS support 
program was articulated around three pillars: (a) promotion of good governance and public 
sector capacity; (b) improving competitiveness and the investment climate for private sector-
growth; and (c) strengthening human capital and social inclusion.  

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
11. 
The Bank delivered its technical and financial support program using a blend of 
investment loans and a series of four Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (Annex 2). Box 1 
presents an overview of the PRSC series which accounted for 78 % of the total IDA lending. The 
original indicative IDA envelope of SDR27 million (US$40 million equivalent) envisaged in the 
CPS was reduced to SDR25.2 million (US$37.3 million) in FY10 as a result of the higher GNI 
per capita and in line with the Performance-Based Allocation System. Under IDA16, Cabo 
Verde’s IDA envelope was raised to SDR30.7 million (US$46 million equivalent). The initial 
IBRD envelope of US$52.8 million remained unchanged during the period. 

Box 1.  Areas of Focus of the PRSC Series 
Four PRSCs (IV-VII) were implemented over the course of the CPS period, and the joint work under these 
operations helped to link the policy reforms with enhanced public financial management. Under PRSC IV (which 
supported the last year of GPRSP I implementation and enabled continued policy dialogue with the Government 
during preparation of GPRSP II), the Government made progress in promoting good governance and improving 
health and education outcomes. PRSC V through PRSC VII supported four main policy areas namely (i) good 
governance; (ii) human capital enhancement; (iii) competitiveness; and (iv) infrastructure. PRSC VI-VII explicitly 
had all the four main policy areas while PRSC V only highlighted (i) good governance; and (ii) competitiveness 
and growth. However, human capital enhancement, and infrastructure were embedded as pillars, often with 
benchmark indicators, in the program supported by PRSC V. Reforms in the pillar on social cohesion included in 
PRSC V were dropped. PRSC V had included this area to align itself with the Government’s GPRSP II. However, 
as the Government increasingly considered this area as cross-cutting, the series was already wide-ranging, and this 
component was rather weak, the team for PRSC VI and VII decided to abandon it.  
The joint Bank-development and Government work under the PRSC series also made it possible for the country to 
maximize the return on its public investments, by: (a) linking medium-term investment planning to long-term 
strategic objectives; (b) improving the selection of public investment; (c) integrating financial management 
systems into performance contracts; and (d) establishing transparent procurement measures to track the quality of 
investments.  
The supervision of the PRSCs was through the donor Budget Support Group’s biannual missions which focused on 
the monitoring of prior actions and brought together experts from the country’s priority sectors. The missions 
evaluated progress on the joint matrix, facilitated coordination, and built consensus among donors.   

12. 
The Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) program comprised policy notes and 
core diagnostic assessments (see annex 3) that provided targeted and just-in-time policy support 
on key issues in the infrastructure, social, and financial sectors. With a total net grant amount 
close to US$8.2 million, the Trust Funds program was fully integrated into investment lending 
activities and significantly supported the Bank’s analytical program.  

13. 
Four projects were closed over the course of the CPS (see Table 2), and all had 
identical IEG and ICR ratings. The PRSC IV and the Growth and Competiveness Project were 
both rated Satisfactory; the HIV/AIDS Project was rated Moderately Satisfactory; and the 
Energy and Water Sector Reform and Development Project was rated Unsatisfactory, due to its 
failure to enhance the supply, efficiency, and management of water and electricity in Cabo 
Verde, and to inadequate Bank supervision. Both the ICR and IEG ratings for M&E design, 
implementation, and utilization were modest except in the case of the Growth and 
Competiveness Project, where M&E had the rare rating of Substantial.

14. 
The Bank’s post-CPS portfolio includes a total of four investment projects, in the 
Energy, Transport, Fisheries, and Finance and Private Sector Development sectors. 
Overall, planned activities have been implemented in a timely manner and all four projects are 
on track to achieve results.  The PRSC VIII, with a net commitment of US$12 million over the 
period July-December 2012, has substantially achieved its objectives, according to a preliminary 
assessment.  Progress toward the achievement of Project Development Objectives and the overall 
Implementation Progress are in the satisfactory range. 
B. CPS Program Performance by Strategic Pillar  

15. 
The three strategic pillars of the CPS program were organized around seven 
objectives, as measured by 36 indicators. The assessment presented here is based on the self-
assessments (Achieved, Mostly Achieved, Partially Achieved, Not Achieved) in the CPS results 
matrix, as updated in the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR).20 More details are presented in Annex 
1. 

CPS Pillar 1 – Promoting Good Governance and Public Sector Capacity  

16. 
Pillar 1 is rated satisfactory as the three objectives of Pillar 1 were fully or mostly 
achieved. 

17. Objective 1: Reduced and better managed liabilities. The two indicators of this 
objective were fully achieved. This outcome was achieved through successful implementation of 
the PRSC series and the TA on debt management. The Government cleared all of the arrears 
identified in 2005 by the end of the CPS period. Also, ELECTRA, the public electricity and 
water utility company, has restructured its arrears and reestablished access to suppliers’ credit. 
To improve the management of liabilities, the Bank also carried out a new public expenditure 
management and financial accountability review (PEMFAR), and worked closely with the 
Government to ensure adoption of the public financial management (PFM) reform agenda. The 

20 An outcome is considered Achieved if the program fully achieved the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. all 
the quantitative targets were met). An outcome is considered Mostly Achieved if the program made good progress 
towards achieving the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. more than half of the quantitative targets were met and 
the program is on track to meet the remainder of the targets).  An outcome is considered Partially Achieved if the 
program made only limited progress toward achieving the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. less than half of the 
quantitative targets were met). An outcome is considered Not Achieved if the program made little progress toward 
achieving the Objective during the CPS period (e.g. few if any of the quantitative targets were met). See Annex 
Table 1 for details.

Bank also supported the preparation of the first Medium Term Debt Strategy in 2011 which lays 
the main orientations for Government borrowing in the next years in which a reduction of 
concessional financing  is expected and an increase in access to international markets.  

18. Objective 2: Strengthened management of public resources at central and local 
levels. The four indicators of this objective were fully achieved. Considerable progress has been 
made in rationalizing Government structures with the definition and harmonization of internal 
structures for all the Ministries, establishing principles for a merit-result oriented civil service 
through the career plan and improving the efficiency of public finance management (PFM). A 
commitment to enhanced budget credibility, supported by continuous improvements in 
preparation, execution and reporting, has substantially increased the reliability and efficiency of 
public expenditures, as well as the transparency and accountability of the budget process. The 
introduction of a Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTEF), and key reforms to the legal 
framework for Government procurement, combined with ongoing efforts to strengthen the 
capacity of agencies involved in public procurement, have been among the most notable 
achievements made under good governance pillar. It should be noted that these achievements 
were also supported by the European Union (EU), the African Development Bank (AfDB), 
Spanish Cooperation, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), which provided much-
needed technical assistance and resources, in particular working in close collaboration with the 
public procurement agencies. 

19. 
Substantial institutional strengthening at the municipality level was achieved through 
implementation of a municipal information system (SIM). The SIM, which serves as a 
management and communication tool between the central level and the municipalities, and 
among the municipalities themselves, enabled the central and local Governments to streamline 
processes related to revenue collection and management, land management, human resources, 
and other administrative activities. It also enabled municipal Governments to improve the 
timeliness of their audited accounts; the court of auditors reported that 14 out of 22 
municipalities were audited in 2011. Further, the Bank’s Public Investment Program technical 
assistance helped the Government to improve management of its public investment program by 
more closely aligning the program with the objectives supported by the GPRSP II and the 
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).   

20. Objective 3: Strengthened public administration regulatory and oversight role. Two 
out of the six indicators under this objective were fully achieved. The delay between budget 
execution and auditing of the State accounts has been reduced to two years, down from three 
years in 2008.  The PRSC series supported the establishment of the Government wide 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System which has served as the foundation of a results-based 
management system. The preparation of the Third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(GPRSP III) has benefited from the M&E system and all its programs have a result framework 
and their implementation is closely monitored and linked to the financial execution of projects.   

21. Overall, the selection of indicators was broadly appropriate to capture the progress 
made under this pillar, and targets were largely met.  For instance, the indicator on “use of 
updated indicators by Government in planning and monitoring” encouraged the Government to 
adopt a results-based approach to monitoring public investments.  

40 

 
 
 
 
 
 
CPS Pillar 2 – Improving Competitiveness and the Investment Climate for Private Sector-Led 
Growth   
22. 
Pillar 2 is rated moderately unsatisfactory as one of the two objectives was mostly 
achieved and the other partially achieved.  

23. Objective 1: Improved business climate. Four out of the five indicators were fully 
achieved. The Bank assistance helped Cabo Verde to rise from 143rd in the Doing Business 
rankings in 2008 to 122nd in 2012 (better than the original target of 132nd). Investment climate 
reforms were aimed at reducing bureaucratic hurdles and the cost of doing business, and 
included tax reforms, removal of administrative barriers, establishment of regulatory agencies, 
and private sector and institutional capacity building.  From 2009 to 2011 an aggressive reform 
agenda for this area produced strong improvements in Cabo Verde’s business climate that have 
been reflected in the 2011 and 2012 Doing Business Reports. Cabo Verde was selected in the 
2011 and 2012 DB reports as one of the top 10 countries that have made significant progress in 
improving the ease of doing business, improving twenty-five positions from the 146th position in 
2010 to the 122nd in 2012. Both the PRSC series and the Growth and Competitiveness Project 
supported strengthening of the investment climate. The latter targeted private sector 
stakeholders, while the former largely supported policy reforms. At the closure of the Growth 
and Competitiveness Project, to speed up the pace of reforms and improve access to finance, 
the Bank agreed to prepare the SME Capacity Building and Economic Governance project, 
which supported the reduction of the number of days it takes to receive a business license and the 
cost of registering property. 

24. 
The Bank also supported the reform agenda associated with Cabo Verde’s accession to 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) reached in 2008. Within this agenda, the PRSC series 
supported the adoption of a new customs code in 2009, the law on intellectual property in 2010 
and the approval of a new investment code in 2012. The full implementation of the WTO 
agreements is expected to enable Cabo Verde to attract greater foreign investment inflows and 
level the playing field for business with the elimination of subsidies and fiscal incentives to 
specific sectors.  

25. Objective 2: Improved access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services. 
Only four out of eleven indicators under this objective were fully achieved, hence this objective 
was only partially achieved. The design of the Energy and Water Sector Reform and 
Development Project was too ambitious, as both sectors lacked adequate institutional and 
regulatory, technical and managerial frameworks. Nonetheless, the project helped to push 
forward and shape the reform agenda in both sectors. The Bank’s engagement in the electricity 
and water sectors continued with the project on Recovery and Reform of Electricity Sector, 
which addresses the country’s chronic energy shortage Effective since May 2012, the project 
aims to increase electricity generation on the islands of Sao Vicente and Santiago, and to assist 
ELECTRA in reducing losses on Santiago. The Road Sector Support Project successfully 
established a road maintenance fund, estimated at Escudos 500 million (about US$6 million). 
New investments in rural roads significantly improved the mobility level of several small rural 
communities. The West Africa Regional Fisheries Program is on track to achieve and even 
surpass the objectives set at the design stage. For instance, the project has made considerable 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
progress in registering domestic fishing vessels by working closely with the Operational Nucleus 
for the Information Society (NOSI), an e- government system. Considering the post CPS period, 
we would like to underscore that three more indicators have since been fully or mostly achieved 
(Financial viability of ELECTRA, quality of the road network, and wind energy installed) 
although they were not accounted for in rating this CPS in line with OPCS guidelines. 
ELECTRA’s financial performance significantly improved in 2013 and will continue to do so in 
2014. The “quality of the road network improved by increasing the proportion of roads rated fair 
to good condition” will surpass the 55% target by October 2014. And when smaller windmills 
installed in other islands such as Santo Antao are taken into account, the “wind energy installed” 
indicator will also have been achieved. 

26. 
In addition to the Bank’s involvement in the energy, water, road, and fishery sectors 
under Pillar 2, IFC financed activities to improve access to finance for SMEs and for 
infrastructure projects development. In SME finance, an IFC credit line of EUR 5 million 
helped the publicly owned commercial bank, Caixa Economica de Cabo Verde (CECV), to 
increase its loan book and provide more private sector financing. IFC also supported the 
development of a credit bureau and a leasing program as alternative sources of finance for SMEs. 
In infrastructure, IFC financed the expansion of cellular telephone networks, which increased 
mobile phone penetration to 83 % in 2012 from 22 % in 2008.  All 10 major islands now have 
expanded coverage.  In addition, the communication tariffs were brought down to about US$0.10 
per minute, compared to US$1 in 2008.  

27. 
The achievement of objectives under Pillar 2 was complicated by the fact that it 
encompassed several distinct sectors. Considerable progress was made in the energy sector 
over the course of the CPS, despite some slippages. In the road sector project, there was a 
disparity between the baseline in the CPS and the project baseline; and the target in the CPS 
results matrix was higher than the one in the project document as per the Implementation Status 
and Results Report (ISR). In the fisheries sector, the indicators were not specific or time 
sensitive. 

CPS Pillar 3 – Strengthening Human Capital and Social Inclusion  

28. 
Pillar 3 is rated moderately unsatisfactory as one of the two objectives was only partially 
achieved. 

29. Objective 1: Better positioning of the education and TVET sectors to meet the needs 
of the labor market. Only one indicator out of three for this objective was fully achieved. The 
Bank carried out analytical work to inform policymaking in the TVET sector, and financial 
support for the expansion of the TVET supply has been provided by the Dutch Cooperation 
(from 2008 to 11) and by the Luxemburg Cooperation (from 2012 onwards). Up to 2010 the 
delivery of technical and vocational courses increased substantially from 1,500 beneficiaries in 
2008 to 5,200 in 2010.  Supported by the Dutch Cooperation, the Training Support Fund (TSF) 
reactivated in 2009 played an important role in the expansion of TVET courses.  In 2010, 55 
projects involving 11 public and private providers had been financed in the amount of about 
€550,000 for the period 2009-2010, very close to the €600,000 target for the period.    Good 
progress was also obtained on the institutional arrangements of the TEVET sector. In 2011, the 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Government approved new statutes for the Employment and Professional Training Institute 
(IEFP) and for the publicly funded Employment Centers (ECs). The integration of vocational 
training programs and ECs under the new IEFP model would ensure that vocational training is 
better attuned to the needs of private employers, indeed the private sector has been involved in 
consultations on qualifications and courses. The Government also introduced a national 
qualification framework to ensure the quality of training is consistent with international 
benchmarks, namely the system applied in the EU. Finally, the certification/accreditation system 
for TVET programs was operationalized and new 7 training centers were certified in 2011-2012.  

30. 
However, fiscal constraints and the end of the Dutch cooperation program interrupted the 
expansionary trend observed until 2010. The number of beneficiaries of TVET actions dropped 
from 5,150 trainees in 2010 to 2,300 in 2011 and further to 1,552 in 2012. This drop also resulted 
from the Government’s decision to put on hold the TSF in 2011 while new regulations and 
financial arrangements to ensure its financial sustainability were defined at the end of 2012.  In 
2013, the Government capitalized the TSF and it is expected that the number of beneficiaries will 
recover in the short run.  

31. Objective 2: Improved targeting of public expenditures and specific programs. 
Three out of the five indicators of this objective were achieved. The TA on access to justice, 
financed by the Japan Social Development Fund, supported the social inclusion agenda. It 
provided the most vulnerable groups with access to basic legal advice in the most pressing legal 
issues. Four new legal centers became operational increasing the number to eleven. Communities 
and community leaders have thus received legal literacy training and legal counseling by trained 
paralegals in the eleven legal centers. The HIV/AIDS project aimed to reduce the spread of 
HIV/AIDS infection in Cabo Verde but it was challenging to ensure political commitment to 
target vulnerable populations. 

32. 
Financed by the Capacity Development for Poverty Work & PRSPs in African Countries, 
the Bank supported the Government efforts on the building-up of the Government’s M&E 
system to assess progress in the GRPS-2. The grant activities encompassed the preparation of a 
Diagnostic Report of the M&E system, workshops on M&E, impact evaluation, Software 
Platform for Automated Economic Analysis (ADePT) and Poverty Map which supported the 
definition of outcome indicators for the GPRSP III and are expected to improve the targeting of 
Government programs. 

33. 
The implementation of household living standards surveys for poverty indicators 
and diagnostic of the incidence of key public programs has not been carried out by the 
National Statistical Institute (INE) which suffers from a shortage of financial and human 
resources. Once the activities envisioned under the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building 
begin, they will be able to address some of INE’s limitations. Indeed, the project will support 
training on sampling techniques, revision of survey tools, data bank management and civil 
registration data analysis to name a few.  

34. 
The indicators under this pillar are mostly linked to AAA products and the PRSC 
series making it difficult to discern the direct impact of the Bank’s assistance. As a case in 
point, the change in the indicator ‘%age of secondary school pupils of the third cycle proceeding 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to technical school increased from base of 13.8 in 2008 to 14.1 % in 2012’ is attributable to the 
financing the Bank provided to the GoCV through the PRSC series. The Bank solely relied on 
the Government’s commitment to allocate some of the funding from the budget support line to 
the education sector but the budget allocation for education did not meet the target. Moreover, 
the AAA products focused on the diagnostic aspect of the issues while the GoCV and other DPs 
(under the umbrella of the Budget Support Group) were expected to carry out the activities to 
allow a better positioning of the education and TVET sectors for the labor market. For the 
indicator “Increase in number of vocational trainees to 8,000 by 2012” training had mainly been 
supported by a Training Support Fund (TSF) set up with financial support from the Dutch 
Government. In 2011 the Dutch Government withdrew from the sector and the GoCV has not 
been able to finance the TSF. Although the Bank supported the Government’s strategy in this 
sector through a Higher Education AAA, highlighting how higher education can support the 
economic and social transformation agenda in Cabo Verde, there was no investment project to 
impact the change in number of vocational trainees. Finally, the HIV/AIDS project lacked 
baseline data for key indicators, which complicated the process of results-oriented project 
management. 
C. Overall CPS Assessment 

35. 
The CPS program broadly delivered the major expected objectives across the three 
strategic pillars. Under Pillar 1, most of the planned public reforms were achieved. Under Pillar 
2, progress was made in the transport and energy sectors, and the private sector development 
agenda was advanced. Under Pillar 3, some progress was made in the social inclusion agenda, 
but activities to strengthen human capital fell short of the expected results. There were some 
minor shortcomings, such as the lack of clear and logical connections between Bank projects and 
some of the outcome indicators, which weakened the results matrix. On balance, the CPS 
performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. 

III - BANK PERFORMANCE 

36. 
Evaluation of the Bank’s performance focuses on two key dimensions:  (a) design of the 
program; and (b) implementation of the CPS program.  

A. CPS Design and Relevance 

37. 
The FY09-12 CPS was well-aligned with the development priorities underscored in 
the GPRSP II. The Bank continued to concentrate its financial resources in selected areas within 
the three pillars of the CPS so as to achieve transformational change over time. The areas of 
engagement of the CPS were well aligned with those of the GPRSP II, including a strong 
emphasis on energy, infrastructure, and private sector development.  The Bank was commended 
by the two main Chambers of Commerce (Sotavento and Barlavento) for its successful 
engagement with small and medium enterprises through the matching grants program. The 
timeframe for project implementation was mostly adequate.  Among the Bank’s client countries, 
Cabo Verde is a strong performer with demonstrated Government capacity on structural reforms. 
Thus, the choice of the PRSC series as the main lending instrument supported by investment 
projects in the critical sectors was adequate. 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
38. Overall, the expected objectives were well defined and appropriate. However, the 
results framework could have been strengthened by omitting results that were not expected to be 
achieved over the CPS period. The implementation of some activities was delayed due to internal 
Bank procurement and legal procedures. A more realistic assessment of preparation time and 
implementation readiness could have helped to set achievable target values for some of the 
indicators. The flexibility in the choice of AAA products provided the Bank with the tools to 
effectively respond to the Government’s demands throughout the CPS period, including with a 
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, and knowledge products 
to support policymaking in education and transport.   

B. Implementation of CPS Support Program 

39. 
The Bank team demonstrated a high level of commitment to implementing the 
projects in the CPS portfolio; and the PRSC series successfully supported broader structural 
reforms in public financial management.  However, changes in the program’s leadership and lack 
of coordination among project implementation units somewhat impeded the transfer of 
experience and knowledge gained from earlier projects. In the area of private sector 
development, for instance, the design of the SME Capacity Building and Economic Governance 
Project did not build on the lessons learned from implementation of the Growth and 
Competitiveness Project. Further, some of the indicators were not well aligned with the 
specificities of the country’s FDI landscape.  

40. 
The Analytical and Advisory Assistance program was responsive to the client’s 
needs and focused on the priority issues of infrastructure development, public sector 
effectiveness, and private sector competitiveness. The analytical portfolio consistently 
informed the design of new projects. As a case in point, the design of the new transport project 
built on the findings of the Air Transport Diagnostic AAA.  In addition, the Bank – cognizant of 
the weak institutional capacity in the energy and water sectors, and in preparation of the current 
IBRD project on Recovery and Reform of the Electricity Sector – supported in-depth analytical 
work on institutional arrangements in those sectors through the Public-Private Infrastructure 
Advisory Facility (PPIAF)’s TA program for ELECTRA. The Poverty Assessment TA informed 
the dialogue on reforming targeted social assistance, while the Financial Sector Assessment 
Program identified areas for strengthening banking supervision. The Initial Labor Market 
Assessment reviewed constraints in the labor market, and provided grounds for optimism 
regarding net job creation and integration of the national labor market. The TA for the Public 
Investment Program helped develop the Government's capacity to routinely evaluate the poverty, 
gender, and other social impacts of investments. The PEMFAR provided important inputs to the 
policy dialogue under the PRSC series.  

41. 
Effective country team involvement in implementing the program helped to 
maintain the focus on development objectives despite the adverse effects of the global and 
then the euro crisis.  The smooth implementation of the program at the project level benefited 
from the strong commitment of the country team coupled with multiple supervision visits from 
the project TTLs and ongoing dialogue with the Project Implementation Unites (PIUs). However, 
internal Bank fiduciary (procurement and financial management) processes delayed the 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
implementation of several projects over the course of the CPS. The cost of implementation 
exceeded the initial allocation for the Growth and Competitiveness and HIV/AIDs projects. 

42. 
The Bank was highly responsive to the changing priorities and demands of the 
Government.  The team’s flexibility was key to achieving salient objectives not initially 
included in individual project designs. For instance, the Growth and Competitiveness Project did 
not include the design of a Strategic Plan for the Chamber of Commerce of Cabo Verde. Yet the 
Bank team foresaw the value of creating a strategic plan for the Chamber of Commerce, and 
worked with the PIU to include it in the project’s activities. The strategic plan has since guided 
the work and increased the efficiency of the Chamber of Commerce.  The Bank’s responsiveness 
was also demonstrated by the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program which added a 
component to upgrade the port of Praia to make it suitable for exports towards Europe. This will 
bring to two the number of ports certified to serve the European Union market, the first one 
being the port of Mindelo in San Vicente.  

43. 
The use of the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) to introduce course correction and 
update the results matrix was broadly satisfactory. As requested by the World Bank 
Executive Directors at the time of the CPS Board discussion, the CPSPR was completed before 
the completion of the first two years of the CPS to provide the necessary course correction in 
light of the global economic crisis. To make the changes inclusive and relevant, the review 
process included consultations with private sector stakeholders and civil society.  The CPSPR 
included new indicators to replace those unlikely to be achieved, and adjusted those whose 
targets had already been achieved by increasing target values.  Some outcome indicators were 
not adequately revised to reflect changing sector and project contexts, such as implementation 
delays and shifting Government priorities. Overall, the Bank’s strategy remained unchanged, 
with only minor adjustments to the timing and amount of credits disbursed. The CPSPR also 
recognized that the initial objectives of GPRSP II, to reduce unemployment below 10 %, attain a 
real economic growth rate above 10 %, and cut poverty by half, were too ambitious in view of 
the global crisis.  

44. 
The Bank’s efforts to enhance the overall value of donor assistance were highly 
effective.  In accordance with the Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness, the Bank joined other 
major bilateral and multilateral donors to harmonize their budget support around a mutually 
agreed-upon policy matrix aligned with the Government’s GPRSP II. During the implementation 
of the CPS, the Bank contributed to the Budget Support Group (BSG) with an envelope of 
US$37 million, and coordinated the activities of the group in 2012.  In that capacity, and in the 
absence of an IMF program in Cabo Verde, the Bank has been providing macroeconomic 
assessments to the other BSG members since June 2012.21  The ongoing Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) will further support the Government’s macroeconomic agenda.   In 
addition, the Bank played a key role in ensuring strategic coherence of donor support in the 
public finance, roads, and energy sectors through policy dialogue and technical support. The 
Bank is continuing to lead the discussions within the Budget Support Group regarding the 
definition of a new common matrix for the 2013-16 GPRSP III.   

21 The last IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI) closed in February 2012. 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
45. 
Sustained dialogue and smooth implementation of the CPS strengthened the already 
good partnership between the Bank and the Government. The Bank has a good reputation 
among Government counterparts and PIUs. As a member of the Budget Support Group, the 
Bank’s work was further reinforced by the unified communication system. In fact, under the 
unified communication system, the GoCV only deals with one interlocutor on the donors’ side in 
charge of consolidating the views of all the DPs.  

46. 
Risk identification and corresponding mitigation measures played a key role in the 
overall achievements of the program. At the CPS design stage, the Bank identified the global 
economic slowdown and the euro crisis as risks that could hamper achievement of the country’s 
development objectives. The measures recommended in the CPS22 helped to mitigate these risks. 
The Poverty Assessment identified additional mitigation measures for vulnerable groups. The 
CPSPR was then used to review and adjust the program’s development objectives. The risk of 
political interference with major structural reforms in the infrastructure sectors was accounted for 
by setting realistic objectives indicators. To mitigate the risks pertaining to contingent liabilities, 
the CPS provided targeted support to the energy sector through ELECTRA’s recapitalization; 
supported the strengthening of the Economic Regulation Agency (ARE) which regulates public 
agencies; and helped identify sustainable Public Private Partnerships in the SMEs sector.  

47. 
The weak administrative capacity in the public sector was offset with capacity-
building activities and technical support from the BSG. As the prospect of declining 
concessional financing became palpable, the Government included only firm agreements rather 
than notional commitments in its budget and medium-term framework. Via the PRSC series, the 
Bank increased its IDA financing for Cabo Verde, with a total allocation of US$46 million for 
IDA 16. In FY 11 the Bank also made available US$12 million in unused IDA resources within 
the Africa Region to Cabo Verde. Using its convening power, the Bank also encouraged donor 
partners to maintain concessional commitments to the country. 

C. Bank Performance Rating  
48. 
The overall design of the strategy was adequate and well aligned with Cabo Verde’s 
GPRSP II goals. However, some of the outcome indicators could have been better designed 
to capture the impacts attributable to the Bank. The Bank can be commended for its 
substantial level of proactivity, the good dialogue maintained with the Government throughout 
CPS implementation, and the strong focus on results. However, the monitoring and evaluation 
aspect of the program fell short in terms of timely results reporting and adjustment of indicators. 
The good performance of the current portfolio and the strong commitment of the country team 
have laid the groundwork for good results in the next strategy period. Therefore, the World Bank 
Group performance is overall rated as fair.   

22The mitigation measures included Cabo Verde’s build-up of sizable international reserves in recent years; its 
standing line of credit with the Central Bank of Portugal; continued monitoring of its macroeconomic situation 
under the IMF PSI, and after it was discontinued, by the Bank; its access to budget support from the BSG donors; 
and the country’s solid track record of proactive economic management and timely adjustment to shocks.

IV- KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEXT CPS 

A. CPS Design and Focus 

49. 
The results matrix needs to be aligned only with objectives of projects in the 
portfolio, and not with objectives dependent on external factors. In Pillar 2, some of the 
indicators linked to the completion of reforms were not updated in the CPSPR, which led to 
difficulties during the evaluation. In fact, the design of reforms was ambitious and not time 
sensitive. Pillar 3 was supported mainly by non-lending activities, without any Bank investment 
projects to carry out the recommendations arising from the analytical work. This made it difficult 
during the evaluation to attribute changes to the Bank’s involvement, particularly since the 
objectives were achieved as a result of other donor activities and the Government’s commitment 
to invest in economic infrastructure.    

50. 
The Bank’s focus on the critical energy sector was appropriate, and should 
continue, building on the knowledge gained from its involvement in the sector over the years. 
The Bank turned the unsatisfactory performance of the Energy and Water Sector Reform and 
Development Project into a learning opportunity, 23 and began to focus on institutional 
strengthening. For example, the Bank encouraged the Government to adopt performance-based 
contracts, strengthen the collection system through the use of smart metering, and reform the 
management of the sector. The lessons learned from all of these actions subsequently guided the 
design of the Recovery and Reform of the Electricity Sector Project which is currently rated 
Satisfactory. 

51. 
As an emerging middle-income country, Cabo Verde could become a focal point for 
South-South learning.  The Bank has already supported a successful exchange on policy and 
institutional reform issues between Cabo Verde and Mauritius through the South Experience 
Exchange Trust Fund. Based on this experience, the Bank could assist Cabo Verde in facilitating 
South-South exchanges on sectoral reforms and on the provision of guidance to low-income 
countries. 

52. Going forward, stronger institutional capacity building will be necessary as Cabo 
Verde develops its IBRD portfolio. Bank-financed projects could include stronger institutional 
capacity building activities to strengthen the sector ministries. The National Planning 
Department, housed in the Ministry of Finance, has strong implementation capacity, but other 
ministries generally have weak capacity, particularly in the collection, evaluation, and 
dissemination of the data needed to monitor their projects and programs.  

B. CPS Implementation 

53. 
There is a lack of economies of scale due to the small size of the country. Better 
resource management will be necessary in the future, and the country team could leverage the 
resources of the Dakar Country Office to continue to maintain close dialogue with the 
Government of Cabo Verde as the IBRD portfolio in the country increases.  

23 The Bank paid closer attention to regulatory strengthening, tariff policy, institutional arrangements, and 
strengthening the financial position of ELECTRA. 

48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
54. 
Cabo Verde’s experience in transport and energy demonstrates how policy reforms 
under the PRSC series, combined with operations support under investment projects, can 
be mutually reinforcing. Going forward, the Bank should continue the approach of combining 
sectoral policy work with investment projects.  

55. 
The Bank should continue to assist the Government in statistical capacity building. 
Targeted assistance could build on the work started under two of the expected objectives this 
CPS and include (a) providing funding to the National Statistics Institute (INE) for the 
“Implementation of household living standards surveys for poverty indicators and diagnostic of 
the incidence of key public programs”; and (b) focusing on the social sector to allow “Public 
investment programs to routinely evaluate poverty, gender and other social impacts of 
investments.”

The Court of Auditors reported that 14 
municipalities were audited in 2011. 
 The number of municipalities using SIM and 
producing timely accounts increases from 3 in 
2008 to 12 in 2010. Actual: The indicator was 
revised to refer only to the use of SIM, not the 
production of timely accounts. The number of 
municipalities using the SIM rose from 3 in 2008 
to 18 as of June 2010, so the indicator was 
achieved.

programs are integrated in a national M&E 
system. Actual: As of 2010, 67% of the annual 
budget has gone to programs integrated into the 
national M&E system, up from zero in 2008. The 
indicator ‘percentage of the annual budget 
allocated to the integration of programs into the 
national M&E system’ was dropped in PRSC VI. 
In 2010, the indicators for all active programs 
were being monitored. GPRSP III will be 
monitored by a well-developed M&E system. 
 Use of updated indicators by Government in 
planning and monitoring programs. Actual: The 
national M&E system includes all investments in 
the public investment program. GPRSP III will 
include updated indicators to monitor the public 
investment portfolio. 
 Up-to-date indicators on tourism, transport, 
water and sanitation. Actual: The 2010 Census 
included monitored data on water and sanitation. 
However, lack of funding impeded the 
availability of 2012 data on water and sanitation. 
INE has 2011 indicators for transport, tourism.

rising from 3% to15% by 2012. Actual:  The 
generation capacity was 73.9MW in 2008 and 
116MW in 2012, which is a 57% increase. The 
share of renewable energy generated was 16% in 
2012. This indicator was achieved. 
 The generation capacity was 73.9 MW in 2008. 
30MW of additional heavy fuel oil generation 
capacity contracted by 2012.  Actual: Heavy fuel 
oil generation capacity was above 30MW in 
2012. This indicator was achieved. 
 Financial viability of ELECTRA significantly 
strengthened by 2012, as evidenced by an 
increase in the debt service coverage ratio from 
0.3 in 2008 to 1.1 by 2012. Actual: The DSCR 
for 2012 was either 0.4 or 1.4 depending on the 
inclusion or not in the debt service calculation of 
a major bond refinancing which happened in that 
year. Substantially, ELECTRA remains 
financially dependent from Government support, 
but its performance is improving thanks to the 
measures put in place by the GoCV and the 
utility (tariff adjustments, improved revenue 
collection, investments, efficiency drive…).

CPS period. 
 28MW of wind energy installed. Actual:  The 
installed and functioning wind energy generation 
capacity was 27MW at the end of 2012 from 
about 3MW in 2008. This indicator was not 
achieved during the CPS period. However, 27 
MW is for the 4 wind farms developed by the 
Cabeolica project company. In addition, there are 
a few additional smaller windmills installed in 
other Islands such as Santo Antao – when they 
are taken into account, the installed capacity is 
around 29MW.  
 Technical and non-technical losses decline from 
30% toward less than 22-23% in 2012 (2010 
benchmark: 24%). Actual: The technical and 
non-technical losses stood at 27.8% in 2012. 
This indicator was not achieved. 
 Percentage of road network with maintenance 
increases from 35% to 50%. Actual: 44% of the 
road network was covered by a performance-
based maintenance contract that began in 2010 
and expired in December 2012.  This indicator 
was substantially achieved but did not meet the 
target value set in the CPS; therefore, it was 
partially achieved.  
 Quality of the road network improved by 
increasing the proportion of roads rated fair to 
good condition by 10% (baseline: 45%; target: 
55%). Actual:  In the ISR, baseline is 41%; target

is 50% for 2013). There is a discrepancy between 
the baseline and target values in the CPS and in 
the project documents. As of November 2011, 
the value of the indicator was 41%. The indicator 
was not achieved by end of CPS period. 
However, in mid-2013, the % was at 50 
according to the Results Framework of the 
Transport Sector Reform Project. This figure 
continues to change as there are three ongoing 
rehab contracts (Santo Antão, Fogo and São 
Nicolau) and one more will be signed soon 
(Maio). When these rehab works are completed 
(before October 2014 for the first three), the % 
will have reached more than 60%. At mid-2014, 
this indicator is mostly achieved.  
 Road maintenance financing mechanism 
implemented. Actual: A road maintenance fund 
estimated at Escudos 500 million has been 
established. This indicator was achieved. 
 Action plan to strengthen Transportes Aéreos de 
Cabo Verde (Cabo Verde Airlines) (TACV) 
adopted and under implementation. Actual: No 
action plan to strengthen TACV was adopted 
during the CPS. Hence this indicator was not 
achieved during the CPS period. However, in 
January 2013, the consulting firm Global Energy 
completed a very comprehensive diagnostic of 
TACV, accompanied by a multi-year business 
development strategy. In parallel, out of the

savings of the RSSP, the services of an 
individual consultant were financed to prepare a 
set of immediate, short-term emergency 
measures. TACV is now working according to a 
2-year recovery plan. Some of its measures have 
already been implemented or are being 
implemented, such as the cancellation of a wet 
lease, reduced free travel perks to third parties, 
cancellation of the most non-profitable routes, 
fuel efficiency gains, use of lower cost airports, 
higher intensity use of planes, spinning off of the 
ground handling services). As result, TACV 
have significantly reduced their operating losses 
(-16 million US dollars in 2013 vs. -40 million in 
2012) 
 Percentage of small-scale fishers supported to 
undertake alternative livelihoods in 
overexploited fisheries increases from base of 
0% to a target of 10%. Actual: The project faced 
some institutional delays during the first year but 
is now on track. The value was 6% in 2012 (34 
out of a total of 564 fishermen in the two co-
management pilot sites of Sal and Maio), This 
falls short of the 10% envisioned at the CPS 
design but is aligned with the West Africa 
Regional Fisheries Program’s projections. 
Within the next months, the number of fishermen 
undertaking alternative livelihoods is expected to 
increase. This indicator was partially achieved.

fisheries increased by 10% from base of 
37kg/motorized vessel for artisanal fisheries, and 
base of 170kg/motorized vessel for artisanal 
small pelagic fisheries. Actual: This indicator is 
on track in relation to the projections established 
under the West Africa Regional Fisheries 
Program 32 kg/trip/motorized vessel for 
artisanal fisheries (2010 data). For artisanal small 
pelagic fisheries it is 210 kg/trip/motorized 
vessel (for purse seine fisheries: 280 
kg/trip/motorized vessel; for gillnet fisheries: 
135 kg/trip/motorized vessel; for hand-line 
fisheries: 75 kg/trip/motorized vessel (2010 
data)). For artisanal fisheries, the catch rate has 
decreased, but the use of newly established 
fisheries management tools will improve rate of 
return in the short to medium term. This 
indicator was partially achieved.
