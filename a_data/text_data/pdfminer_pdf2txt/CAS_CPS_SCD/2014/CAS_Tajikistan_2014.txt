EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
Tajikistan is a country of stark contrasts—physical, economic and social.  These include 
glaciered mountains alongside fertile valleys, vast hydropower resources but chronic energy shortages, 
huge remittance inflows but low foreign exchange reserves, and robust GDP growth but still high rates of 
poverty. At the same time, Tajikistan borders East Asia—the most dynamic developing region in the 
world, Eurasia—one of the most resource rich, and, indirectly, South Asia—the second most populous. 
Yet, the potential of proximity to these international markets remains unrealized, not only by the 
country’s currently limited regional connectivity, but also by a structural reform agenda and 
implementation record that remain works in progress.  

2. 
 Against this background, Tajikistan has reached an important turning point in its 
economic, political, and social development.  Following the re-election of President Emomali Rahmon, 
a new government was appointed in January 2014; parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2015; and a 
new long-term development strategy, 2016–25 is currently under preparation that will incorporate post-
2015 MDGs for which Tajikistan was a focus country.  

3. 
Looking ahead, the authorities’ goals for 2020 are ambitious: to double GDP, to reduce 
poverty to 20 percent, and to expand the middle class.  During the previous CPS, poverty declined 
from 47 percent in 2009 to an estimated 36 percent in 2012, enabling the incomes of the bottom 40 
percent of society to grow faster than the population at large. However, poverty reduction for women was 
lower than for men and MDGs for maternal and child health and access to clean water and sanitation will 
not be achieved. Moreover, other non-monetary indicators of poverty increased in urban areas, 
particularly access to heating and sanitation, affecting the welfare of the growing middle class.  

4. 
Tajikistan will not achieve its goals for 2020 without fundamentally altering its current 
consumption-driven growth model, which is ultimately unsustainable.  Fuelled by the remittances of 
migrant workers now totaling nearly half of GDP, as well as higher wages in state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs), the service sector is expanding while the small industrial sector is contracting. Job creation is 
insufficient to absorb the youth bulge and wage growth has outpaced that of labor productivity. The limits 
of this model are now becoming evident: according to WBG estimates, GDP growth averaging 8 percent 
since 2002 is now projected to decline to 6 percent annually during 2015-18. To achieve higher growth, 
Tajikistan needs to implement a deeper structural reform agenda designed: (a) to reduce the role of the 
state and enlarge that of the private sector in the economy through a more conducive business climate, 
thus increasing private investment and generating more productive jobs; (b) to modernize and improve the 
efficiency and social inclusiveness of basic public services; and (c) to enhance the country’s connectivity 
to regional and global markets and knowledge. 

5. 
This CPS would meet country and the WBG’s corporate goals—to reduce extreme poverty 
and promote shared prosperity—by supporting the expansion of opportunities for private firms 
and poor and vulnerable groups.  It is anchored in policies designed to maintain macroeconomic 
stability and promote better governance, including through sound public finance management and greater 
citizen engagement. To increase shared prosperity, the CPS targets interventions to benefit new private 
firms, small farmers, youth and women.  Specifically, through a mix of lending, analytical and advisory 
services (AAA), and technical assistance, it would: strengthen  the role of the private sector (by reducing 
business transaction costs, increasing access to finance, improving electricity supply, and promoting agri-
business); promote social inclusion (by improving delivery of public services, particularly education, 
health, social assistance, water supply and sanitation, and citizen engagement); and expand regional 
connectivity (through better access to markets and knowledge hrough information and communications 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
technology (ICT), institutional cooperation, and learning networks). At the same time, investments in 
climate adaptation and climate-smart practices would help create jobs and thus reduce migration as a 
coping strategy. To address extreme poverty, the CPS would support government plans to adopt and 
implement nationwide a targeted poverty benefit. 

6. 
Within this framework, the CPS’ indicative program includes a programmatic series of 
three development policy loans (DPOs) commencing FY16 designed to achieve three ‘stretch’ goals.  
The scope and timing of this series would be subject to the authorities’ maintaining a satisfactory 
macroeconomic framework, including fiscal policy consistent with debt sustainability and measures to 
minimize the risk of a systemic banking crisis.  Proposed ‘stretch’ goals to achieve higher growth would 
be: (a) to expand credit for the ongoing commercialization of agriculture through the resolution of Agro-
Invest Bank (AIB)—preferably involving a foreign investor and management contract.  This would be the 
first step towards modernizing the banking system, leading to increased public trust and savings; (b) to 
increase the reliability of electricity supply through measures to improve the financial viability of Barki 
Tajik, the state-owned energy utility; and (c) to boost regional connectivity and reduce transport and 
transaction costs by the further liberalization of aviation and telecommunications. 

7. 
Selectivity was informed by empirical analysis, a client survey, and extensive consultations 
with civil society and youth.  The CPS draws on numerous analytical reports, including the last Country 
Economic Memorandum (CEM),1 which highlighted growth opportunities in agribusiness, mining, and 
hydropower exports, and also a recent Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional flagship report on 
diversified development, 2 which underlined the importance of investment in human capital and 
institutions. It also reflects feedback from a client survey, which highlighted two top development 
priorities: improving the quality of public services and combatting corruption. Meanwhile, economic 
growth, private sector development, job creation (especially for young people), and education and training 
for employment are considered the four most critical areas for reducing poverty and promoting shared 
prosperity.  In line with the recommendation to strengthen collaboration with non-state actors, the WBG 
held extensive consultations with civil society organizations (CSOs) and young people, who comprise 40 
percent of the population. The CPS’ focus on private sector development, social inclusion, and regional 
connectivity as well as its three cross-cutting themes—governance, gender, and climate—resonated with 
virtually all participants and attracted wide support among most groups. A theme repeatedly raised was 
exclusion—of firms from factor inputs and domestic markets, of poor and vulnerable groups from higher 
education and social services, and of citizens and firms from business opportunities and global 
knowledge.  

8. 
In summary, this CPS seeks to help lay the foundation for Tajikistan to transition to a new 
growth model led by investment and exports.  It will involve assisting the authorities to define and then 
implement during the next few years a new, more sustainable growth model that allows more space for 
the private sector. If conditions to implement ‘stretch’ goals through DPOs do not materialize, the CPS 
would nevertheless contribute to a greater role for the private sector by foundational reforms and to 
poverty reduction and shared prosperity through investment in basic human needs, social services, and 
infrastructure.

II. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. 

Political and Regional Context 

1. 
Landlocked and largely mountainous, with a population of about 8 million and a GNI per 
capita of US$880 in 2012 (Atlas methodology), Tajikistan is the poorest country in Europe and 
Central Asia (ECA).  Bordering Afghanistan to the south, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and 
Uzbekistan to the west, barely 7 percent of the country’s land area is arable, due to its elevation and 
topography; the rest consists of glaciers, mountains, and pastureland or steppe that support livestock 
grazing. 3 Endowed with abundant water resources, Tajikistan’s hydropower potential, including for 
export, is substantial. Coal, silver and gold are present and possibly significant reserves of hydrocarbons 
were discovered in mid-2012. It is also the country most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate 
change in ECA.   

2. 
Shortly after independence in 1991, civil and political conflict persisted until mid-1997, 
causing widespread loss of life and physical damage.  It also resulted in a significant exodus of human 
resources, mainly from industry and public administration, and a serious deterioration in the quality of 
human capital. Uniquely among post-Soviet states, Tajikistan’s transition from plan to market has in 
effect been delayed by a decade—until the turn of the century. Many first generation reforms such as land 
and water use rights are just getting underway.  

3. 
Political and administrative centralization unified the country and concentrated authority 
in the executive branch.  The influence of the Presidency is far-reaching. President Emomali Rahmon—
in office since 1994 and recently re-elected to a fourth term ending in 2020—continues to dominate the 
political scene and his People’s Democratic Party has a majority of seats in both houses of parliament 
(Majlisi Oli). Following the election, a new cabinet was formed and several agencies were restructured 
with the aim of bringing more dynamism to government, particularly in the related energy and water 
sectors.   

4. 
Tajikistan is Central Asia’s least accessible, most isolated country, with only limited 
regional and international connectivity.  This is partly a function of the country’s geography and 
topography: internal and regional communications and transportation are problematic, especially in 
winter. It is also due to regional trade and transit obstacles and to vested interests that have inhibited 
liberalization of the transport system, in particular aviation. Moreover, Tajikistan’s relations with its 
neighbors are encumbered by at least three concerns: (a) the management of shared energy and water 
resources—exemplified by Uzbekistan’s opposition to the proposed Rogun Hydropower Plant; (b) the 
flow of illicit drugs across Tajikistan’s territory from South Asia to Eastern Europe; and (c) uncertainties 
stemming from the situation in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of most international forces by end-
2014.  

B. 

Poverty and Shared Prosperity 

5. 
The return of stability and initial reforms led to growth averaging 8 percent annually from 
2000-13, with significant poverty reduction.  Poverty declined from 81 percent in 1999 to 47 percent in 
2009 and, based on more recent, albeit not exactly comparable survey data, to about 36 percent in 2012.4 
Extreme poverty dropped even faster—from 73 percent to 14 percent during the same period. Labor 

3   Mountains cover 90 percent of its 143,100 km2 land area, of which over 50 percent is at least 3,000 meters above sea level. 
4  Poverty estimates for 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2009 are based on Living Standards Surveys (LSS) and data for 2012 on 
Tajikistan’s Household Budget Survey (HBS). Thus, due to different design and implementation protocols, the earlier (TLSS) 
and most recent (HBS) data are not strictly comparable.

earnings accounted for half the decline and remittances for about one third. The benefits of growth were 
also widely shared: consumption by the bottom 40 percent grew faster than that of the population at large. 
However, economic mobility was volatile and higher in rural compared to urban areas. Moreover, poverty 
reduction for women was lower than for men and the gender wage gap widened.   

6. 
The drivers of poverty reduction differed according to income level and place of residence.   
During 1999-2009, the period for which comparable micro data are available, more than one million rural 
people were lifted out of poverty. While poverty dropped substantially nationwide, Khatlon and Gorno 
Badakshan Autonomous Oblast lagged and remain the poorest regions. As noted in Figures 1 and 2, 
middle class, mainly urban groups benefited more from increased labor earnings and remittances than 
poor and vulnerable groups and the bottom 40 per cent. Remittances accounted for 25 percent of poverty 
reduction in rural areas and 18 percent in urban areas.

7. 
Despite these advances, non-monetary indicators of poverty indicate growing deprivation 
and inequality.  Poverty remains widespread and linked to specific factors such as continued high 
fertility (at 3.8, the highest in the CIS), insufficient jobs (with young people, over 40 percent of the 
population, accounting for 60 percent of registered unemployed), and the uneven impact of remittances on 
different population groups. However, inequality in Tajikistan—comparable to Moldova and lower than 
Georgia and the Kyrgyz Republic—is not high. Nonetheless, the poor continue to be disadvantaged by 
limited access to high quality education and health care; and they receive little help from a weak social 
protection system whose benefits until very recently were small and poorly targeted. Health outcomes are 
lower than in comparable ECA countries, in particular for infant, child, and maternal mortality; and 
chronic malnutrition affecting almost 30 percent of children under five is a particular concern.5 Finally, 
access to basic public services such as electricity, heating, clean water, and sanitation—remains very 
limited in rural areas where most of the poor live.

Recently available micro-data suggest that limited or no access to education (secondary and 
tertiary), heating, and sanitation are the main contributors to non-monetary poverty.  These three 
are the most unequally distributed services, with access to education varying by income level and to 
heating and sanitation according to location. Figure 3 below, comparing deprivation in the bottom 40 and 
top 60 percent of the population in 2007 and 2013, indicates expanded coverage and lower inequality in 
terms of monetary poverty, but reduced coverage and increased inequality in access to electricity, heating, 
and sanitation.6

These indicators of deprivation correlate with Tajikistan’s uneven progress towards its 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).7  Only 13 of 42 MDGs are likely to be achieved by 2015, 
according to the most recent (2010) progress report, with 13 still technically possible, but six very 
unlikely. On the positive side, primary and lower secondary enrollment is now almost universal and infant 
and child mortality have dropped to 52/1,000 and 65/1,000 live births respectively. On the negative side, 
potable water supply remains a serious challenge, especially in the countryside where only 48 percent of 
rural communities have access and over 60 percent of water available does not meet local or World 
Health Organization (WHO) standards. Moreover, four lagging indicators are gender-related: maternal 
mortality, one of the highest in ECA; the ratio of girls to boys in upper secondary and especially tertiary 
education; the share of women in non-agricultural employment; and the number of female legislators. 

10. 
Tajikistan ranks the lowest in ECA on gender, where disparities especially in access to 
education remain significant contributors to poverty. The key issues include: disparities in favor of 
boys throughout the education system, but especially at university level; gender-based sectoral and 
occupational segregation and resulting earnings inequities; and weak implementation of gender policies.

Economic Developments and Medium-Term Prospects 

Growth and remittances 

11. 
Tajikistan’s economy was adversely affected by the 2008-09 global economic crisis, but 
growth recovered quickly and averaged over 7 percent annually during 2010-13.  Recovery was 
spurred by remittance inflows, which rebounded sharply and continued to grow, exceeding US$4 billion 
in 2013 (Figure 4). Remittances fueled private consumption and, to a much lesser extent, investment. This 
in turn contributed to strong growth in services, which accounted for more than half total growth in 2013, 
followed by agriculture, accounting for one fifth (Figure 5). Consistent with lower international food and 
fuel prices and a relatively stable exchange rate, consumer price inflation declined from close to 10 
percent at end-2010 to 3.7 percent by end-2013. 

12. 
Remittances helped drive growth by supporting consumption. With GDP growth averaging 
6.8 percent annually and consumption averaging 13.1 percent annually, consumption grew faster than 
GDP in each of the last five years. By contrast, investment (gross fixed capital formation) varied 
significantly, contributing to GDP growth in some years (e.g. 2008, 2010-11, and 2013) but in others (e.g. 
2009 and 2012) not. Indeed, investment during 2009-13 averaged barely 0.3 percent annually. 

13. 
Exports remained broadly stable, albeit at a low level compared to other regional and 
global low income countries.  In 2013, Tajikistan’s exports were less than 17 percent of GDP, compared 
to about 50 percent in Kyrgyzstan, Cambodia, and other countries at similar income levels. The share of 
aluminum and cotton in total export value declined from 80 percent in 2008 to 48 percent in 2013, which 
indicates some diversification but also lower volume and prices for aluminum.

14. 
The difficult environment for doing business in Tajikistan as well as obstacles to foreign 
direct investment (FDI) have discouraged private investment and limited overall investment. 
Averaging about 15 percent of GDP annually since 2008, total investment is low by regional and 
international standards. Public investment accounts for 80 percent of the total, or 12 percent of GDP, and 
private investment for 20 percent, or only 3 percent of GDP—much lower than the ECA developing 
country average. The main obstacles cited by both local and foreign entrepreneurs are inadequate 
infrastructure, in particular insufficient and unreliable energy supply, the weak rule of law, especially as 
regards property rights, and tax policy and administration.8 

15. With international reserves averaging barely 1.5 months of imports during the last five 
years, Tajikistan’s economy is highly vulnerable to external factors beyond its control.  For example, 
its reliance on remittances and the export of only two commodities expose the country to external demand 
and international price shocks. Likewise, its dependence on food and fuel imports makes it no less 
vulnerable to changes in global food and fuel prices.9 Meanwhile, with foreign direct investment (FDI) 
below 2 percent of GDP in 2013, remittances remain the principal source of financing of the current 
account deficit, which in 2013 was about 3 percent of GDP. 

16. 
Tajikistan adopted a flexible exchange rate policy under the 2009-12 IMF Extended Credit 
Facility (ECF) program.  Absent major external shocks, the nominal exchange rate remained relatively 
stable in 2012-13, contributing to lowered inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the recent weakening of 
both the Russian and Kazakhstan currencies is exerting pressure on the somoni. If the authorities were to 
mitigate this pressure by intervening in the foreign exchange market, the already low level of reserves 
could deplete quickly.  

Macroeconomic implications of large remittances 

17. 
Remittances helped drive growth and reduce poverty, but also raised the threshold at which 
recipients are willing to enter the labor market.  In 2012, average economy-wide wages in Russia were 
almost six times higher than in Tajikistan, although the differential in construction and trade—the two 
sectors where most Tajik migrants work—was lower, at 2.5 and 4 times respectively (Figure 6).  
However, it is these two sectors that have seen the highest wage increases over the past four years (apart 
from the financial sector), suggesting that access to the Russian labor market may be pushing up wages in 
Tajikistan. 10 If so, the consequence could be serious because rising labor costs affect competiveness 
directly. Figure 7 shows that although real wages in Tajikistan have risen by almost 300 percent since 
2005, labor productivity has increased by only 32 percent during the same period. While higher wages are 
essential for poverty reduction, increases much larger than productivity growth will hamper job creation. 

18. 
The impact of remittances on the economy is similar to that of other remittance-dependent 
countries, but the risk of Dutch disease appears low.  Remittances are the largest external financing 
item and an important contributor to poverty reduction. Their main impact on the economy to date has 
been increased consumption, at present the main source of growth. This consumption is mostly import-
based—i.e. remittances are used mainly to purchase tradable goods —which has mitigated potential 
pressures on the somoni’s exchange rate and on competitiveness. In the circumstances, the risk of Dutch 
disease appears to be low.11

This paper shows that standard ‘Dutch Disease’ results of appreciation can be substantially weakened even overturned, 
depending on the degree of openness and the share of tradables in consumption.

Lagging investment and the reform context 

19. 
Tajikistan has been unable to create enough jobs for its growing labor force.  Since 2006, the 
population has increased by 17 percent, while formal employment rose by only 10 percent. Employment 
growth in industry was minimal and only modest in agriculture and services, the two largest sectors. The 
relatively small construction sector experienced the highest growth rate (8 percent), driven mainly by 
remittances. This low growth in overall employment, as well as limited internal labor mobility, explain 
the relatively small contribution of employment to poverty reduction, compared to migration.

20. 
Increased private investment and new business development are crucial prerequisites for 
increased job creation.  Large remittances, if properly channeled within a much improved business 
environment, could lead to much higher investment. Examples of this in other countries with high levels 
of remittances include Armenia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Lesotho, and Nepal, where total investment 
averaged 25 percent of GDP in 2012, including private investment averaging 19 percent of GDP. These 
high rates of investment, including private investment, suggest that Tajikistan’s policymakers need to 
reduce the state’s footprint in the economy, prioritize public expenditures within a realistic fiscal 
envelope, and dramatically improve the business environment.  

21. 
Global competitiveness indicators confirm that these are priority areas for improvement. 
For example, the World Economic Forum’s 2012 Global Competitiveness Indicators show that, although 
Tajikistan did as well as, or exceeded the scores for factor-driven economies, it needs to improve its 
infrastructure, macroeconomic management, and market size. This means for infrastructure, addressing 
electricity, transport, and water shortages; for macroeconomic management, reducing quasi fiscal deficits; 
and for market size, diversifying exports beyond aluminum, cotton, and labor. 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22. 
Another important area is the country’s financial sector, which remains fragile and is a 
significant element in the economy’s overall vulnerability.  Dominated by banks, Tajikistan’s financial 
sector remains shallow by regional standards, with credit to the private sector equal to only 12.5 percent 
of GDP in 2013, down from 13.5 percent in 2012. Four large banks control about three quarters of total 
assets—of which three are linked to agriculture, construction and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) 
respectively, with the fourth handling government payments. By end-2013, non-performing loans had 
increased to 23 percent from 18.2 percent at end-2012. Governance issues, poor enforcement of 
prudential regulations, and weak consumer protection are the main concerns. More generally, financial 
sector development overall is undermined by directed lending, which distorts the market, misallocates 
credit, and weakens confidence and the credit culture. By contrast, rapid expansion of microfinance, 
where IFC is a prominent player, reflects the strong demand for capital by small traders and businesses.

agenda—including

remains a work in progress. 
Tajikistan’s low scores for 
large scale privatization and 
governance and enterprise restructuring (Figure 8) reflect the still high number of poorly managed SOEs 
that contribute to quasi fiscal deficits. Likewise, its even lower score for competition policy indicates the 
lack of a level playing field and the close linkages between government agencies and the private sector.

Recent economic developments 

24. 
In the first quarter of 2014, GDP growth slowed but remained strong at 7 percent year-on-
year (yoy). Slower growth of remittances during the last quarter of 2013 (8.1 percent yoy compared to 
25.8 percent in 2012) has not yet translated to slower growth of services and construction—the two 
sectors most dependent on remittances, which together accounted for almost two-thirds of growth in the 
first quarter of 2014. Supported by strong revenue performance and contained expenditures, the state 
budget recorded a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in January-March 2014. In March 2014, average 
inflation fell to 4.1 percent from a 6.7 percent a year earlier. Against this background, the National Bank 
of Tajikistan (NBT)—the country’s central bank—lowered its refinancing rate in 2013-early 2014, 
facilitating a modest increase in credit to the private sector.   

25. 
Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress is moderate.  Government debt fell from 36.6 percent of GDP 
in 2009 to 32.3 percent of GDP in 2013. The 2013 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) reduced the risk of 
debt distress from high to moderate, implying that Tajikistan will move to an IDA credit-grant blend in 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
FY15. However, standard stress tests with a one-off shock to non-debt creating flows (mainly private 
transfers) revealed significant vulnerability to a sustainable debt path, as in the previous DSA. Further, the 
overall fiscal stance is probably worse than official data suggest because of SOEs’ soft budget constraints, 
directed lending by banks, and other quasi fiscal risks. Indeed, given SOEs’ large liabilities, total public 
debt is arguably much higher.  

Medium-term prospects 

26. 
Tajikistan’s growth is projected to ease to 6.8 percent in 2014 and to average 6 percent 
through 2018 in the baseline scenario, which assumes maintenance of prudent macroeconomic 
policies and moderate structural reforms. 12 Three factors explain this trajectory: first, a projected 
slowdown in growth in China over the medium-term and lower growth in Kazakhstan, Russia, and 
Turkey in 2014—four countries that accounted for two-thirds of Tajikistan’s exports in 2013; second, 
continued weak demand and low prices for aluminum; and third, slower growth in remittance flows. 
Inflation is projected to remain relatively low, due to expected stable global food and fuel prices, a 
moderate nominal depreciation of the somoni, and an adequate monetary policy. Private investment is 
projected to increase to a still modest 6.4 percent of GDP, if measures to improve the business 
environment and make more productive use of remittances are implemented vigorously. This would help 
gradually to re-balance growth towards private investment and exports. Gross investment is projected to 
increase to 16.2 percent of GDP by 2018.  

27. 
The baseline scenario also assumes medium-term fiscal consolidation consistent with debt 
sustainability.  The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to below 1 percent of GDP as improved public 
finance management and revenue collection partially compensate for slower economic growth. Capital 
expenditure as a share of GDP would fall only moderately as the externally-financed public investment 
program remains significant and government investments in energy and the social sectors are maintained. 
Social spending, including outlays on the national-wide poverty benefit program, is projected to benefit 
the most from increased revenues. The efficiency of public spending is expected to improve as a result of 
dialogue with and financial support from the WBG and other development partners. While the baseline 
scenario is expected to lead to a gradual decline in public sector debt to less than 30 percent of GDP by 
2018, it may need to be re-visited later to reflect the fiscal and macroeconomic implications of pending 
government decisions regarding the proposed Rogun hydropower project.  

12   The baseline scenario for Tajikistan employs the Bank’s most recent projections for global, regional and country-level growth. 
It also assumes for the time being that the impact of ongoing geo-political tensions on Russia’s economy and growth 
prospects will be limited. The Bank’s current ‘low risk’ scenario for Russia projects growth slowing to 1.1 percent in 2014, 
before increasing slightly to 1.3 percent in 2015. The ‘high risk’ scenario is -1.8 percent (contraction) [Russia Economic 
Report No. 31, March 2013].

Finally, the baseline scenario also assumes a narrowing of the current account deficit to 2 
percent of GDP and an increase in FDI.  The commercialization of agriculture and development of 
agro-processing together with better regional connectivity are expected to boost non-commodity exports. 
Imports of capital goods are projected to rise due to higher investment. WTO accession is expected to 
facilitate a gradual increase in FDI to 2.4 percent of GDP by 2018 in sectors such as energy, 
infrastructure, mining, and telecommunications. Foreign currency reserves are projected to increase to 2.5 
months of imports of goods and services over the medium-term, but to remain below the prudential norm. 

29. 
Overall risks to this baseline outlook are substantial.  These include: lower than projected 
Russian and/or global growth; a steeper reduction in remittances; a slower recovery in the prices of 
aluminum and cotton; potential slippages in macroeconomic management; and possibly sluggish 
implementation of structural reforms. External risks include the country’s reliance on imports of food and 
fuel, both subject to periodic price volatility, as well as its exposure to increasingly serious regional trade 
and transit obstacles. Domestic policy risks include the financial sector’s increasing vulnerability with 
spillover effects to the whole economy, as well as the quasi-fiscal activities of large SOEs. There is also 

11 

 
 
 
 
   
major uncertainty about the financing and timing of large infrastructure investments, such as the proposed 
Rogun project. On the upside, besides faster growth in the economies of Tajikistan’s main trading 
partners and improved terms of trade, more decisive implementation of structural reforms by the newly 
appointed and reorganized government—including actions to channel remittances into productive private 
investments and to reap the benefits of WTO membership—would yield medium and long-term growth 
dividends. 

30. 
Under an alternative low case scenario, a possible contraction in Russia’s GDP in 2014 
would lower Tajikistan’s growth significantly below 6 percent. The negative impact would be 
transmitted mainly via an estimated 10 percent decline in remittances in 2014. In this case, GDP growth 
in 2014 would slow to 4.5 percent as the result of a drop in consumption growth to below 1 percent and a 
sharp (>10 percent) decline in investment. Construction and services would be affected the most, with 
additional negative impacts on incomes and employment. Lower remittances would help improve the 
trade balance by reducing demand for imports and the current account deficit would remain slightly above 
2 percent of GDP. The budget deficit would widen to over 3 percent of GDP due to lower revenues and 
only a moderate reduction in expenditures, gradually improving in the medium-term to less than 1.5 
percent of GDP.  

D. 

Development Challenges 

31. 
Tajikistan’s biggest challenge in the coming years is to lift its low rates of private 
investment.  This will require a much better investment climate and strengthened institutions. Existing 
regulations for starting and operating a business are still too restrictive and access to key inputs is not 
equal for all companies, discouraging new entrants and reducing the interest of potential investors. Given 
the constraints imposed by its geography and the small size of its domestic market, Tajikistan needs to 
make special efforts to improve its image and reputation as a place to start and operate a business and as a 
venue for quality investment, including foreign investment. 

32. 
Increasing private investment will also require improved governance, in particular decisive 
implementation of ongoing governance reforms.  While the governance agenda needs to apply to the 
entire economy, specific reforms may be better addressed in the context of sector-specific strategies.  
Challenges to the business environment for both domestic and potential foreign investors need to be 
addressed, as do challenges to the financial sector, given the low level of financial intermediation. 

33. 
Sound macroeconomic management will be critical for future growth, given the country’s 
vulnerability to external shocks. This will require continued vigilance by the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) and central bank (NBT). There is an urgent need to rebuild fiscal and foreign exchange buffers, 
consolidate fiscal accounts to fully reflect the public sector, and stop leakages and the sub-optimal use of 
public funds. The challenge for policy making is two-fold: (a) to create incentives for the channeling of 
remittances into productive private investments, including strengthening links between the diaspora and 
the local economy; and (b) to remove the barriers to internal migration and the efficient reallocation of 
labor resources within the country.  

34. 
To achieve sustainable growth, Tajikistan needs to become more deeply integrated into the 
regional and global economy. This could be facilitated through labor-intensive exports, including of 
agro-processed products and light manufactures, which would also help create much needed jobs. In 
addition to a better business climate, more attention to logistics and infrastructure is needed, so that 
private entrepreneurs investing in production for export can connect to neighboring markets. 

35. With 70 percent of the population facing extreme hardship due to winter energy shortages, 
and business citing lack of electricity as a binding constraint, the energy sector reform agenda is a 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
long-term challenge.  Resolving it will require political will and persistence, given the poor financial 
management and governance of Barki Tajik, the state-owned energy company, which has led to the 
accumulation of arrears and contingent liabilities, posing macroeconomic and systemic risks.  

36. 
Economic and social exclusion constrains growth.  Bias and a reliance on personal networks 
for civil service employment and access to social services and economic inputs limit economic activity, 
inhibit upward mobility, and exacerbate class, ethnic, and regional tensions. Exclusion of women from 
employment opportunities that could contribute to higher incomes (education, equal pay, services, asset 
ownership, and credit) also reduces potential growth.     

37. 
Climate change and its related impacts put development gains at risk.  Climate change is 
projected to lead to higher temperatures, more rapid glacier melt, increased incidence of flooding, and 
also more severe and prolonged droughts. Poor people will be the most affected as they tend to depend 
more directly on vulnerable land and water resources. Ten years of poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity is thus potentially at risk, as is the achievement of Tajikistan’s national development goals—
food and energy security in particular. In addition, there is limited institutional capacity to mainstream 
climate change adaptation in development plans, programs, and policies.   

E. 

Development Opportunities 

38. 
Expanding opportunities for private businesses will provide the foundation for a new 
growth model focused on private sector-led investment and exports.  This requires continuation of 
efforts to create a business environment conducive to private sector development, including but not 
limited to: (a) creating a level playing field and strengthening the competition framework, so that insiders 
or connected parties do not benefit at the expense of other parties; (b) assuring expanded and equal access 
to finance and energy; and (c) reducing the costs of doing business more aggressively to compensate for 
the country’s geographical disadvantages. Tajikistan has several sectors that could be competitive 
domestically, regionally, and even globally, but developing them will depend upon removing barriers to 
entry and attracting private investment. It will also involve creating opportunities for returning migrants 
to start businesses and to invest their savings locally.  As the business environment improves and 
entrepreneurs (particularly domestic, but also foreign) perceive less risk in investing in Tajikistan, private 
investment will pick up and begin creating bettering-paying jobs, better service delivery, and more robust 
tax revenues. 

39. 
Second, agro-processing and mining are two sectors that offer potentially significant growth 
opportunities and where important structural reforms have recently been adopted.  Efforts are 
underway to make investment in agriculture more profitable, especially for exports, by enhancing access 
to markets and by empowering farmers through strengthening their land-use rights, improving their access 
to credit and inputs, and enabling them to make their own cropping decisions. The recent growth of non-
cotton agricultural exports indicates the potential for growth in agro-processing, including storage of fruit 
and vegetables, which holds great promise for development, along with textiles and clothing. Tajikistan’s 
application to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and its adoption of a new regulatory 
framework for mining should stimulate its growth, including of SMEs that supply the industry. 

40. 
Third, meeting energy demand will be important as part of the agenda to reduce poverty 
and create an enabling environment for private businesses.  Next only to its abundant labor, 
Tajikistan’s vast hydropower potential make it best suited for allocating scarce public resources. 
Strengthening the electricity sector for reliable domestic supply and potential hydropower exports will 
require a diverse set of reforms, ranging from making Barki Tajik’s operations financially viable and 
transparent, to leveraging foreign private investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs). 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
Currently, the government is assessing the feasibility of a large hydropower project at Rogun and other 
investments to rehabilitate the Nurek hydropower station, which supplies 97 percent of Tajikistan’s winter 
energy. These investments need to be considered in light of riparian concerns and macroeconomic 
stability, as well as minimizing the costs to the government and sharing costs and risks with private 
investors. 

41. 
Fourth, sound macroeconomic management remains the essential foundation for future 
growth.  Among other things, this means that large infrastructure investment projects need to be carefully 
appraised and prioritized against the population’s needs for better education, health and social protection. 
Public finance management also requires strengthening to make spending more efficient; and public 
finance reforms aimed at enhancing the transparency of public procurement, while hardening SOEs’ 
budget constraints—especially those in energy—need to be reinforced by adherence to sound principles 
of corporate governance and international financial reporting standards (IFRS). 

42. 
Finally, to realize these opportunities and achieve sustainable growth, Tajikistan will need 
to invest in human capital and institutions.  Although the country faces challenges and opportunities in 
all four types of endowments—natural, physical, human, and institutional—it is the scarcity of human and 
institutional capital that inhibits the country’s growth prospects. Given a growing young labor force, 
policy should focus on enabling youth, particularly from rural and poor families, to acquire knowledge 
and skills of relevance for private sector development and for capacity development in public sector 
institutions.  

F. 

Government Priorities 

43. 
Tajikistan’s overall long-term development goals, reflected in its ongoing 10-year National 
Development Strategy (NDS), 2006-15, are to promote sustainable growth, improve public 
administration, and develop human resources.  A new long-term strategy is presently being prepared 
that is intended to be aligned with post-2015 MDG goals, for which the United Nations undertook 
consultations with the government and a wide range of civil society stakeholders. As was the case for 
current NDS now nearing completion, the second NDS is expected to be supplemented by a series of 3-
year medium-term development programs and strategies.  

44. 
Tajikistan’s current Living Standards Improvement Strategy (LSIS) for 2013-2015 
sharpens the focus on poverty reduction and the expansion of the middle class.  It is therefore fully 
aligned with the WBG’s priorities to reduce extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.  The LSIS’ 
three broad-based priorities are as follows: 

 Strengthening the basis of development—in particular, macroeconomic management, public 
administration, private sector development, investment climate, special economic zones, and 
integration with the global economy; 

 Reinforcing sustainable economic growth—concentrating on energy and industry, physical 
infrastructure, especially communications and transport, and food security, including 
agriculture, land use, and irrigation; and 

 Ensuring development of human potential—focusing on employment and social protection; 
education and science, basic health care, communal utility services, including water supply 
and sanitation, environmental stability, gender equality, and demographic projections and 
planning. 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45. 
President Rahmon has set quantitative targets for national development by 2020.  In his 
inaugural address following re-election on November 16, 2013 and national address to Parliament on 
April 23, 2014, he set two overall targets: to double GDP and to reduce poverty to 20 percent by 2020, 
while also expanding the middle class.  He also reiterated the government’s continuing emphasis on 
achieving energy security, ensuring food security, and increasing connectivity. These critical goals would 
be achieved by ongoing reforms in agriculture; increasing efficiency and productivity in both land and 
water resource use; rehabilitating rural social and economic infrastructure; supporting productive SMEs 
and entrepreneurs; promoting gender equality; and providing social protection and support to the poorest 
citizens. Education and health in particular will remain priorities for government financing and reform; 
tertiary education would be a special focus, with admittance to universities via the Unified Entrance 
Examination expected to increase acceptance on the basis of merit.  In supporting and financing these 
priorities, the government will also aim to utilize budget resources more efficiently. 

III. 

BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. 

Lessons Learned from previous CPS and Stakeholder Feedback 

46. 
The principal objectives of the previous CPS were to mitigate the impact of the 2008-09 
global downturn and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development.  Key 
lessons that have informed the design and content of this CPS include the following. First, Tajikistan’s 
civil war delayed the country’s economic and political transition, including the establishment of modern 
government institutions, by at least a decade. As a result, several first generation reforms remain still to be 
fully completed to lay the foundation for sustainable growth. Second, though many institutional, legal, 
and regulatory reforms were adopted to promote private sector development, their impact so far has been 
limited due to poor governance, capacity constraints, and/or market dominance by related parties. Third, 
sustainable improvement in public service delivery requires a combination of political leadership, 
dedicated civil servants, and the proactive engagement of civil society.  Fourth, the poor quality of 
official data puts development outcomes at risk because policy choices and investment decisions are not 
based on solid evidence or analysis. The Completion Report for the last CPS is at Annex 2. 

47. Meanwhile, the results of a country opinion survey undertaken in early 2014 have informed 
CPS preparation and will guide its implementation.  According to this survey, improving the quality 
of public services and combatting corruption are viewed as the country’s two highest development 
priorities. Meanwhile, economic growth, private sector development, job creation (especially for young 
people), and education and training for employment are considered the four most critical areas for 
reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Overall, the WBG is considered an effective, relevant, 
and respectful development partner, with particularly high scores for collaboration with the government 
and coordination with other development partners. Lower ratings and thus challenges for the future 
include the need to strengthen collaboration with non-state actors and to disseminate more effectively the 
results of its work, including macroeconomic, poverty, and other data. 

48. 
During consultations at the national and local levels between June 2013-February 2014, 
stakeholders argued strongly for WBG support to expand economic and social opportunities for 
excluded groups.  Civil society organizations (CSOs) highlighted: (a) the priority of job creation through 
private sector development especially in the agricultural and rural sectors; (b) the importance of ongoing 
and planned reforms in education, health, and social protection; and (c) the need for better relations with 
neighboring countries, especially in the areas of education, energy, tourism and water resources. CSOs 
also called for young people, the fastest-growing demographic group, to be a focus of the new CPS. More 
detailed summaries of the country opinion survey’s findings and stakeholder consultations and feedback 
are at Annex 5.

B. 

Proposed Bank Group Strategy 

49. 
The strategic goal of this CPS is to help reduce extreme poverty and promote shared 
prosperity by expanding opportunities for the private sector and excluded groups, thus supporting 
transition to a new growth model.  This overarching objective is in line with WBG corporate priorities, 
with the development challenges and opportunities discussed above (paras.31-44), with the country’s 
medium-term (LSIS) development goals, as well as with the new long term strategy that is currently being 
prepared. CPS support would be provided through targeted interventions organized around three broad 
areas of engagement or pillars, as follows:  

 Strengthen the role of the private sector.  The objective is to create enabling conditions to 
expand micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and thereby create jobs.  Joint 
IDA-IFC work will reduce transaction costs for business, increase access to finance, and 
increase the reliability of electricity supply.  Growth opportunities will be targeted in agri-
business and improvements in the regulatory environment for mining. ; 

  Social inclusion. The objective is to improve delivery of basic social services (social 
protection, water and sanitation, primary health care), while expanding access to higher 
education for youth from poor families, and to land rights for women, thus increasing 
opportunities for productive employment.  

  Regional connectivity. The objective is to expand access to regional markets and global 
information 
and 
knowledge 
through 
infrastructure 
improvements 
(including 
telecommunications), thus diversifying economic opportunities.  

50. 
CPS activities under each of these three pillars would also be shaped by applying three cross-
cutting themes: gender, governance, and climate change. Finally, the CPS’ overall design, framework, 
and program reflect reform priorities emerging from policy dialogue with the authorities in the context of 
routine macroeconomic monitoring, recently completed and ongoing AAA, and investment and 
development policy operations, as well as Tajikistan’s CPIA scores for 2013.   

51. 
A ‘One WBG’ approach to planning and implementation informed this CPS.  Based on 
positive practical experience during the last CPS, including joint work on the regulatory environment, 
individual projects (e.g. Pamir Energy, CASA-1000) and AAA (Khatlon: Reinvigorating Regional 
Growth (2012), the teams merged into one for the launch of the CPS and its preparation. To meet CPS 
objectives more efficiently, the WBG is combining core competencies in several strategic areas.  First, to 
help meet ‘stretch goals’ that would boost growth, the WBG jointly identified priorities for the DPO 
series and would collaborate during preparation and/or implementation (see paras. 54-55).  Second, to 
develop MSMEs, the ongoing Private Sector Competitiveness project and IFC advisory services are 
simplifying business registration, permitting and inspections while improving the regulatory environment 
for mining.  A follow-on project is planned for FY18 that would be prepared jointly. Second, given high 
informality, the WBG will modernize tax administration and increase electronic services for tax filing, 
permit applications, and regulatory compliance, thus reducing corruption and encouraging greater 
formality.   Third, to promote agribusiness, the WBG provides a full-service approach, including: i) land 
and irrigation reform to increase sector productivity; ii) development of ‘integrators’ for fertilizer, leasing 
and marketing services; iii) introduction of new financial products through commercial banks; and iv) 
direct investments by IFC in suppliers and retail food.  Further joint efforts are under preparation, 
including in the ICT sector, municipal services and hydropower. In Dushanbe, the Bank and IFC share 
office space and the institutions cooperate on external affairs, IT and HR. 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
52. 
CPS support would be provided through the existing portfolio, by new IDA lending 
averaging US$60 million annually, supplemented where appropriate by trust fund financing, and 
by analytical and advisory activities (AAA).13   Based on recent AAA and operational experience, 
lending would be scaled up for higher impact in sectors that underpin shared prosperity, including land 
reform, water (all uses), energy, and social assistance.  The Bank’s multi-year engagement in the 
education sector would be broadened by the addition of higher education.  Regional connectivity, which 
is a new priority area with strong demand from the Government and civil society, will be informed by 
further AAA.   The shift to fewer, but larger investment lending operations already underway during the 
second half of the last CPS would permit greater selectivity, a more strategic focus on reforms and results, 
and the continued consolidation of the portfolio. No less important, it would also help reduce 
administrative and management burdens on 
the government’s 
limited absorptive and project 
implementation capacity, as well as on scarce Bank Group staff resources. New trust fund commitments 
potentially equivalent to up to half of IDA commitments would leverage IDA financing, especially in 
communal services, energy, environment, and transport.  

53. 
IFC-specific support envisages potential investments averaging up to US$10-20 million 
annually, plus technical assistance. Building upon its existing advisory and investment services 
portfolio, IFC will continue to prioritize activities that contribute to increased access to finance for 
MSMEs, particularly in rural areas, promote investment climate improvements and reduce costs of doing 
business, and support development of agribusiness, hydropower and mining. IFC will also seek 
investment opportunities in other growth-enhancing sectors and develop related advisory services. The 
indicative work program for FY15-17 is presented in Table 2 below.   

54. 
The indicative IDA lending program provides for 3-4 operations annually14, including a 
programmatic series of three DPOs commencing FY16.  In addition, one regional project is planned in 
FY15; others are under consideration. These have the potential to leverage Trust Funds or additional IDA 
and shared solutions.  Based on experience under the last CPS, DPOs are a key instrument to support 
implementation of structural reforms over the medium-term, helping build policy consensus within the 
government, as well as strengthening coordination and implementation structures and practices. If the 
authorities are able to maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework and an acceptable reform 
implementation record, up to one-third of new commitments would be in the form of DPOs to support 
implementation of the structural reform agenda. If not, the available resources would be re-allocated to 
augment or finance new investment operations already in the pipeline. The DPOs would address the 
institutional and policy constraints identified by the Bank and IFC that are holding back progress across 
all three pillars.  Further development of the policy framework would draw upon: (a) the analysis and 
recommendations of ongoing and planned AAA, in particular the public expenditure reviews currently 
underway; (b) policy dialogue in the context of ongoing operations in energy, financial sector, public 
finance management, and social assistance; and (c) recommendations emerging from IFC’s advisory 
services. 

55. 
The scope and timing of the DPO series would aim to achieve three ‘stretch’ goals that 
would boost growth.  These would be to:  (a)  resolve AIB, preferably involving a foreign investor and 
management contract with IFC involvement, thereby facilitating the expansion of credit for the ongoing 
commercialization of agriculture; (b)  increase the reliability of electricity supply through measures to 

13 The IDA allocations for FY15-17 (IDA-17) and FY18 (IDA-18) are indicative. Actual IDA allocations may vary depending 
on:  (a) the total IDA resources available; (b) Tajikistan’s GNI per capita, performance rating, and population; (c) the terms of 
IDA assistance (grants and credits) and deductions associated with MDRI annual debt service foregone; (d) the performance, 
terms, and other assistance parameters of other IDA beneficiaries; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. 
14 3 operations in FY15 and FY18, and 4 operations in FY16 and FY18 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
improve the financial viability of Barki Tajik, the state-owned energy utility, possibly involving a 
management contract for IFC; and (c)  increase regional and international connectivity and reduce private 
enterprises’transaction costs by the further liberalization of aviation and telecommunications. Meanwhile, 
given the high cost and risk of large public investment projects such as the proposed Rogun hydropower 
plant, financing arrangements would need to be considered carefully, taking into account debt 
sustainability strategy, as well as the need to maintain macroeconomic stability and prevent the crowding 
out of other vital public expenditures.  

56. 
Tajikistan’s weak institutional framework and uneven implementation record require the 
mainstreaming of governance mechanisms in country systems and in WBG-financed operations.  
Based on experience under the 3-year Governance Partnership Facility (GPF), demand and supply-side 
mechanisms to strengthen accountability and transparency would be supported by investment operations 
and by Tajikistan’s participation in the Global Program for Social Accountability (GPSA). CSOs would 
be involved throughout the project cycle and in IFC advisory services. The governance checklist would 
inform new operations and mid-year reviews. Using a Russian Trust Fund, the budgetary committee of 
parliament would continue to strengthen its public finance oversight function. In addition, experience 
with the recently approved health ‘results based financing’ project would be carefully monitored. The 
focus on governance also includes strengthening of country systems in public procurement and in 
financial management.  The procurement team is helping increase procurement capacity in ministries and 
supporting e-procurement, which will improve competitive access for private sector participation and 
reduce opportunities for corruption, while the on-going public finance reform project is strengthening the 
treasury to support e-disbursement.

57. 
To build commitment for deeper structural reforms, the CPS program will invest in joint 
policy notes and create space for public dialogue.  The goal will be to enable transformative change 
agents to play a stronger role in the country’s development.  This will be achieved through collaboration 
with the Development Coordination Council by setting up a regular platform for policy dialogue on 
structural reforms with concerned stakeholders, including the government, think tanks, CSOs and the 
private sector. The intention is to help consolidate the currently small and fragmented circle of reform 
advocates, raise their profile and voice, and help them overcome resistance from various vested interests. 
The WBG will contribute to this process by initiating joint policy notes and organizing at least quarterly 
thematic meetings to discuss and disseminate proposals on various critical areas of structural reforms.     

C. 

Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending 

Pillar 1: Strengthening the Role of the Private Sector 

58. 
The first pillar would contribute to the twin goals by increasing opportunities for private 
firms and farmers to invest, grow, and create jobs.  International evidence shows that MSMEs are the 
most important source of new employment, yet this segment of the private sector in Tajikistan is 
disproportionately constrained by high regulatory costs, limited access to finance, governance obstacles, 
and a dominant state role in the economy (45 percent of GDP, EBRD, 2010). As a result, MSMEs have 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had a weak contribution to job growth and poverty reduction since 2006. The CPS therefore targets 
binding constraints that are hampering the expansion of new private investment, particularly for smaller 
firms and farmers.  Building on the previous CPS, the WBG will support implementation by Government 
of reforms that reduce transaction costs on business, including by use of electronic services, and increase 
access to finance, electricity, and land.  Together with interventions to improve the competitiveness of 
agribusiness, the WBG will help small farmers become small businesses by increasing the marketed 
surplus of selected agricultural products.  Besides these specific outcomes, CPS activities under this pillar 
would also improve energy security, which is crucial for private sector growth and welfare improvement 
for the poor, who suffer most from winter energy deficits.     

59. 
Reducing the costs of doing business and improving the investment climate will continue to 
be a focus with an emphasis on implementation and service delivery assessment.  CPS support would 
focus on economy-wide regulatory reforms with the objective of reducing compliance costs for the 
private sector throughout the business cycle—from registration to permits and licensing, tax 
administration, and 
inspections.  Compliance costs are 
largely 
fixed and 
thus 
represent a 
disproportionately high cost to MSMEs.  Consequently, these reforms will be critical to enable smaller 
businesses to grow. Tax administration, which continues to be raised in surveys of the private sector as a 
leading obstacle to growth, will be a particular focus with the objective of modernizing the State Tax 
Committee’s service delivery, internal information technology (IT) capacity, and valued-added tax (VAT) 
systems leading to greater predictability for businesses and improved government efficiency. Drawing 
upon lessons learned in the previous CPS, activities in this area will emphasize reform implementation 
through capacity building, governance, and the use of practical tools to enforce regulations, including 
feedback mechanisms to assess the quality of service delivery. Recommendations emerging from this 
economy-wide focus will also inform and monitor development policy lending.  

60. 
Expanding MSMEs’ access to credit and bolstering the financial sector remain high 
priorities.  The CPS will continue efforts to develop a robust financial sector that can attract new 
investment including remittance inflows, while providing new products and services to borrowers and 
savers. In line with the financial sector reform strategy and action plan, the CPS will support the 
strengthening of financial sector regulation and supervision (both prudential and consumer protection) 
and improving financial market infrastructure. In parallel, IFC will continue to work with individual 
financial institutions providing finance as well as technical assistance on risk management, foreign 
exchange management, and microfinance growth and transformation strategy. By working both at the 
regulatory and firm level, the CPS will support the development of mobile banking, which could facilitate 
better access to finance as well as the intermediation of remittances. Support for immovable property 
registration will facilitate the use of land and buildings as loan collateral. 

61. 
Access to land and property rights that are well defined and enforced are important 
enabling conditions for private investment in agriculture, environmental management, and urban 
development.  The way such rights and access are managed at the policy level is also crucial for ensuring 
socially inclusive development in these areas, particularly regarding women’s land rights.  The WBG has 
supported farm restructuring and the initial creation of a land cadastre and registration system through the 
Land Registration and Cadastre System for Sustainable Agriculture project, but the registration system is 
still not operational for transactions and large areas of land and property remain unrecorded.  In 2014, the 
registration and cadastre of all properties was united in one entity in line with the law on registration, but 
this recent institutional reform must be supported by modern IT, a regulatory framework for the property 
market, and the training of skilled professional staff. The proposed Land Immovable Property 
Registration project (FY17) will provide a platform to continue intensive policy engagement around land, 
be it related to farm restructuring, pasture reform and other communal areas, or urban planning and 
upgrading.

62. 
Improved governance and financial viability of the energy sector are critical to reduce 
persistent winter energy shortages and to enable private sector growth and higher living standards. 
The Tajik energy sector is in a state of crisis and poses serious threats to economic growth, 
macroeconomic stability and social inclusion objectives.  The issues related to sector governance and 
financial viability will need to be addressed as a matter of urgent priority in order to resolve severe winter 
energy shortages, attract private sector capital, reduce the impact of sector debts on the budget, and secure 
citizen support for essential sector and tariff reforms. The WBG has been and will continue to assist the 
country on both the governance and financial issues through lending and technical assistance. The Bank’s 
interventions will help the Government implement its Financial Recovery Plan for Barki Tajik, the state 
utility, and specifically, to bring Barki Tajik’s operations to short term cost recovery levels during the 
CPS period.   Measures that will be undertaken with development partners will include: the completion of 
the consumer metering programs and improved commercial billing practices to reduce commercial losses 
and increase revenues; energy efficiency programs to reduce energy consumption; and investments to 
help mitigate winter energy shortages. IFC will provide assistance in the areas of regulation for clean 
energy investments, private sector participation in the sector through support to small private generation 
projects and possibly through a management contract of Barki Tajik. In addition, IFC may consider other 
infrastructure projects opportunistically. 

63. 
CASA-1000 will establish new mechanisms to improve financial accountability and reduce 
winter energy deprivation.   To ensure that export revenues generated from CASA-1000 are 
transparently managed and used for permissible purposes, the Government will establish an escrow 
account that would accumulate funds from all electricity exports, including the existing bilateral 
Tajikistan-Afghanistan power trade.  Monthly statements of receipts and payments will be published on 
the websites of Barki Tajik and the Ministry of Energy, and the statements will be subject to an annual 
audit.  Permissable uses would include project-related payments and activities agreed with the Bank and 
financiers targeted at priority investments, such as reduction of winter energy deficits.  As part of the 
Community Support Program for communities along the construction corridor, a number of schemes will 
be offered for communities during the construction phase of the project and a part of the benefits through 
a share of CASA revenues.  Based on feedback from focus groups in an on-going study of the social 
impacts of winter energy deprivation, these may include bulk supplies of heating fuels and support for 
energy efficiency of social infrastructure and homes, in addition to targeted social assistance.   

64. 
Helping increase the efficiency and competitiveness of agroindustry will be a ‘one WBG’ 
effort, building on significant policy advances made in the previous CPS.  In Tajikistan, most private 
businesses are small farmers and helping them secure access to markets and sustainable income is central 
to reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The Agriculture Commercialization project 
(FY14) will help small farmers become small businesses by commercializing marketable surpluses. In a 
complementary manner, IFC will promote development of agro-industry along its value chain, aiming to: 
(a) increase farmers’ access to finance (including through development of mobile banking); (b) expand 
agro-aggregators’ capacity and bankability; and (c) foster private investments in agro-processing and 
related infrastructure. IFC will also explore opportunities along the agribusiness value chain and seek 
partnerships with foreign investors planning to set up joint ventures in Tajikistan. Finally, given the 
importance of livestock for poor communities, the WBG may also support Tajikistan’s participation in a 
regional program for food safety and livestock trade.    

Pillar 2: Social Inclusion 

65. 
The second pillar would address extreme poverty and help promote shared prosperity by 
improving delivery of social services that expand opportunities for excluded and vulnerable groups.   

22 

 
 
 
 
 
Based on findings from the ECA report on Diversified Development (2014), human capital in Tajikistan 
is a source of competitive advantage that requires significant new investment in line with the unfinished 
MDG agenda. Outcomes that CPS activities are intended to influence during the next four years, as 
reflected in the results framework, include: (a) increased access to, and better quality of education—in 
particular poor students (bottom 40 percent) in tertiary education; (b)  improved efficiency and quality of 
primary health care, especially for mothers and children; (c) better access to targeted social benefits by 
the poorest quintile of the population, including use of a national electronic registry for social services, 
through the nation-wide rollout of targeted social assistance; and (d) better access to safe drinking water 
(and sanitation) in urban areas, including Dushanbe. .    

66. 
Education.  With the World Bank and several other development partners already involved in 
early childhood, general, and vocational and technical education and training in Tajikistan—all high 
priorities—additional CPS support for education would be selective and focus on the tertiary level. 
University enrollment averaging 150-160,000 or about 20 percent—with boys outnumbering girls by over 
two to one—is unchanged since the mid-2000s; and enrollment in non-university tertiary education has 
also been flat at around 35-40,000. However, quality and completion rates are declining.  According to 
preliminary findings from a World Bank/GIZ study, the private sector sees the shortage of higher 
education graduates and ‘new economy’ skills as a constraint to growth just when educational quality and 
completion rates at the tertiary level are declining.  Moreover, higher education benefits the richest 
groups, raising equity concerns. Thus, investments in tertiary education are vital to improving private 
sector growth and shared prosperity. The READ project financed by Russia established the National 
Testing Centre (NTC), which will reduce corruption in university access. An ongoing Higher Education 
Sector Study is analyzing efficiency, equity, and effectiveness issues and identifying priorities for 
enhancing university-level education’s quality and relevance to the particularities of Tajikistan’s economy 
and labor market. Based on this analysis, as well as studies in Education Governance and ICT Capacity, a 
proposed Higher Education Project (FY16) would support improvements to the system.   

67. 
Health.  The main objective of financing and organizational reforms since the early 2000s has 
been to improve the public health system’s effectiveness and financial sustainability by strengthening 
primary health care and restructuring the oversized and inefficient hospital delivery network inherited 
from the Soviet period. While these reforms and related investments have led to some improvements in 
service delivery, several issues still need to be addressed. First, per capita financing in primary health 
care applies only to the non-salary portion of the budget, representing about 10 percent of total spending 
on primary care. Most public funds are still allocated through line-item budgets that maintain the status 
quo and deter incentives to improving the efficiency and quality of primary health care services. Second, 
Tajikistan’s hospital system, characterized by high bed to population ratios, low occupancy, and long 
average lengths of stay, remains inefficient and continues to consume most of the limited public health 
resources available. Overall financing for health is barely adequate to cover salaries and utilities, leaving 
little for drugs, laboratory re-agents, and facility maintenance. CPS support during FY15-18 would 
comprise the ongoing Health Services Improvement Project (HSIP), in particular the piloting of 
performance-based incentives designed to improve the quality of maternal and child health care and the 
enhancement of the per capita financing system for primary health care.  In addition, with support from a 
second Japanese Social Development Grant, the Bank would expand nutrition training and supplements to 
pregnant mothers to help address the high rate of child under-nutrition and maternal and child mortality. 

68. 
Social Protection.  In 2011, recognizing the need for a comprehensive social protection strategy 
to improve coverage and targeting, the government launched a pilot Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) 
program in two districts. It consolidated the two largest social assistance programs into a single benefit 
and was twice as effective in reaching the poorest 20 percent of the population using proxy means test to 
target benefits. A Rapid Social Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund grant supported implementation and 
evaluation of this pilot and a subsequent IDA-financed Social Safety Net Strengthening Project (FY 11) is 

23 

 
 
 
 
supporting development of a national electronic registry for social assistance as well as capacity building 
to extend the pilot to 25 districts in 2014. As a result of this operation and high-level policy dialogue, the 
government recently agreed to adopt a nation-wide targeted poverty benefit in place of categorical 
benefits.  Thus, an FY14 policy note is providing the fiscal analysis for the benefit; and the institutional 
infrastructure for TSA program implementation nation-wide will be provided during FY15-18 through 
additional financing to the on-going Social Safety Net Strengthening Project. 

69. Water Supply and Sanitation, Urban Development and Disaster Risk Management 
interventions will have the greatest impact in ensuring socially inclusive, sustainable and safer 
communities. Except for the largest cities, urban communities suffer from poor communal service 
coverage, especially sewerage; and access to basic services is particularly poor in small-towns and rural 
areas, with dire sanitation conditions. The economic cost of inadequate and unequal access to water 
supply and sanitation services in terms of health impacts, productivity losses, and coping costs for 
accessing water is estimated at over 3 percent of GDP.  On a per capita basis, average costs represent 
over 9 percent of the lowest quintile’s average income. CPS responses to these challenges will be growth-
centered and will include: the proposed Communal Services Development Fund, with support from EBRD 
and other partners, with an initial focus on water supply in secondary towns. A National Sanitation 
Project is under discussion, beginning in Dushanbe, to build the sanitation sector from the ground up, 
including central institutional capacity building, rehabilitation of urban systems, and introduction of 
innovative decentralized sanitation solutions for small towns and rural communities. These activities will 
also contribute to make water supply and sanitation climate-smart through loss reduction. 

70. 
Employment and Labor Market Reforms.  Despite low unemployment according to official 
data, Tajikistan’s labor market is characterized by limited opportunities for productive work, in particular 
for women, large numbers of job seekers, and significant underemployment, especially in rural areas. 
Youth employment is a special concern because of Tajikistan’s young population—almost 40 percent of 
the labor force is less than 25 years old—and because the quality of education at all levels is problematic.  
Against this background, AAA and TA activities would aim to: (a) deepen understanding of the nexus 
between education and training, labor outcomes, migration, and poverty; (b) assess the labor market’s 
regulatory environment, in particular the potential for more youth-friendly features; and (c) evaluate the 
impact of the recently reformed university entrance examination in terms of access, efficiency, and 
transparency, as well as the relevance and value of higher education in the labor market, in particular for 
women. Proposed lending (FY18) would link the labor market and private sector competitiveness, based 
on experience in IFC’s Education for Employment program in the Middle East and North Africa.  

Pillar 3: Promoting Regional Connectivity 

71. 
The third pillar would address the twin goals by reducing the time and cost of Tajikistan’s 
integration into regional markets and global knowledge networks. Geographically isolated with a 
small domestic market, the World Bank’s Tajikistan Trade Diagnostic Study (2006) concludes that 
reducing economic distance to world markets is a pre-condition for sustained rapid growth and poverty 
reduction by stimulating private sector activity and trade and investment flows.  This in turn would 
generate higher fiscal revenues and household incomes.  The study found that more efficient operations 
and increased competition in road and air service could lower annual transport costs by 20 percent.  
Regarding internet connectivity, the World Bank study on Economic Impact of Broadband (2009) found 
that a 10 percentage point increase in market penetration of broadband services in developing countries 
increases GDP by 1.38 percentage points on average.  Based on these factors, the CPS aims to: (a) 
increase commerce in the Ferghana Valley by strengthening Tajik-Kyrgyz road links; (b) promoting 
regional power trade and creating a Central Asia-South Asia energy market; and (c) liberalizing ICT 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
sector regulation and improvement in international broadband internet connectivity.  Investments in 
infrastructure would be supported by AAA on regional railways and a Tajikistan multi-modal transport 
study. 

72. 
Transport—regional roads. Trade, transit, and transportation are encumbered by poor road 
connectivity, both domestically and regionally. Central Asia region transport margins can be very high, in 
some cases exceeding 100 percent, because of low quality roads, border delays, and other soft and hard 
infrastructure obstacles. Relatively small investments in trans-border links are known to have impacts on 
‘agglomeration’ processes disproportionate to the simple economic value-added from lower transport 
costs. These processes facilitate trade, the competitiveness of domestic products, and the potential for 
diversification. Regional road transport corridors can dramatically reduce these costs, increasing the scope 
for profitable trade and also its intensity. 

73. 
CPS support for the proposed Central Asia Road Links (CARs) program, strengthening 
connections with the Kyrgyz Republic, would complement the ongoing regional Transport and Trade 
Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan, 2008-17, which envisages rehabilitation of six strategic regional 
transport corridors based on their potential to enhance growth and reduce poverty. Focused on the 
northern Sughd region, which accounts for about one quarter of Tajikistan’s GDP and 40 percent of the 
country’s overall freight turnover, the Tajikistan component of this program would not only facilitate 
economic and regional cooperation, but also support private sector participation and the WBG’s agro-
processing strategy for time-sensitive products, such as fruits and vegetables, clothing and textiles, and 
other consumer goods. 

74. 
Electricity trade. The Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade project 
(CASA-1000) (FY14) will enable the export of summer surplus hydropower from Central Asia to energy 
deficit countries in South Asia, improving socio-economic prosperity and stability in all four countries 
(Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan).  CASA-1000 requires that export revenues be 
placed in an escrow account and managed transparently, thus strengthening financial sustainability of 
Barki Tajik.  In addition, opportunities for reconnecting Tajikistan to the Central Asian electricity grid 
and associated trade options with Central Asian countries are being explored under on-going AAA on 
Regional Energy Trade.  Resuscitation of regional energy trade would provide the fastest means to reduce 
winter energy deprivation in Tajikistan, which affects 70 percent of the population.  

75. 
Aviation.  Despite IDA-supported initial reforms, Tajikistan’s air transport system remains 
plagued by weak corporate governance, limited competition, distorted tariffs, and inadequate regulatory 
oversight, leading to one of the highest landing costs in the world. It is also hampered by staffing 
constraints in the three parastatal companies concerned and sub-standard physical infrastructure. In 
coordination with other development partners, CPS support through a DPO and a possible IFC investment 
would promote competition through aviation sector liberalization and strengthened governance, enhanced 
air transport connectivity and safety, as well as greater private sector involvement. However, achievement 
of these outcomes is a CPS ‘stretch goal.’   

76. 
Railways. There is currently no railway link between Dushanbe and the southern regions of the 
country which would be part of a regional corridor link from Dushanbe through northern Afghanistan to 
Turkmenistan. ADB is currently financing a feasibility study of the Afghanistan section and plans to help 
with the Tajikistan component later this year. CPS support for railways would comprise a policy note 
covering financial, strategic, and technical options for Tajikistan’s railway, complementing similar studies 
undertaken in other Central Asian countries. Contingent on agreement between Tajikistan, Afghanistan, 
and Turkmenistan (TAT), a project supporting the TAT rail link is tentatively in the pipeline. 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
77. 

Regional telecommunications connectivity. Tajikistan can integrate further into global 
knowledge and economic networks if it increases the 
diversity 
and 
capacity 
of 
its 
international 
telecommunications links. At present, its connectivity is 
limited—and 
lags other 
landlocked countries 
in 
international 
internet 
bandwidth 
per 
capita—
constraining the ability of businesses and citizens to 
connect with global education, trade, or employment 
opportunities. An inconsistent regulatory framework 
currently prevents private telecommunications firms 
from building cross-border fiber optic cables that would 
connect Tajikistan better with the rest of the world.  In 
this context, as required by WTO, an independent 
regulatory agency needs to be established to create a 
level playing field for all companies, irrespective of ownership. 

Table 3: International Internet bandwidth per capita (kbps),  
Telegeography 2013. 

78. 
An opportunity for Tajikistan arises from the high level of private sector interest in developing 
the national and cross-border connectivity 
infrastructure. Leveraging 
IFC 
investments 
in 
telecommunications, the WBG could help unlock private investment by supporting reforms in the 
regulatory framework and catalytic investments that extend access to rural and remote regions of the 
country. Moreover, an ongoing higher education study is raising awareness and working with universities 
to test the prospects for using the internet and ICT to improve the quality of, and access to higher 
education. A planned higher education project will build on these results, aiming to connect more students 
in Tajikistan with regional and global knowledge networks. 

79. 
Creating regional and international learning networks.  In addition to using university 
networks to integrate Tajikistan into global knowledge, the WBG will continue the on-going Central Asia 
Energy and Water Development Program (CAEWDP) to support regional energy-water cooperation.  As 
a platform for knowledge and experience sharing, the CAEWDP supports comprehensive interaction of 
Central Asia countries and Afghanistan on water and energy linkages. It promotes data-sharing and builds 
technical knowledge on climate modeling, hydrology, and resource-saving technologies, which is 
important because climate change impacts in Central Asia extend across national borders. To improve 
climate resilience, Central Asian countries have requested WBG support for regional collaboration, and a 
program is under discussion that would build on a series of on-going initiatives, encompassing the annual 
Central Asia Climate Knowledge Forum, the Central Asia Technical Working Group on Climate, and the 
ECA Deep Dive Technical Assistance. Finally, as already noted earlier, the WBG may support 
Tajikistan’s participation in a regional food safety and livestock trade program, if regional IDA resources 
are available. 

Cross-Cutting Theme—Gender:  

80. 
Limited access to land, finance, social services and networks represent constraints to female 
entrepreneurship and participation. Women face specific difficulty accessing finance due to lack of 
collateral, education, and knowledge. Women are disproportionally present in the low paid informal 
agricultural sector and have much lower enrollment in tertiary education. Female entrepreneurs are rare 
and face more obstacles in access to land, finance and networks than men. Due to the large-scale 
outmigration of males, Tajikistan has the largest share of female-headed households in Central Asia. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Significant gaps in disparities between women and men are still observed after the completion of basic 
secondary education: according to the 2011 World Development Indicators (WDI) the ratio of female to 
male enrollment in tertiary education was 52 percent.  

81. 
Narrowing the gender gap in human capital endowments and economic opportunities is critical 
for achieving inclusive growth and will remain an important area of CPS support. The private sector-led 
growth pillar will focus on improving women’s access to economic opportunities, building their capacity 
and skills, and providing access to land rights and finance leading to higher productivity especially in the 
low paid agriculture sector. The social inclusion pillar will aim to improve equal access to better quality 
social and public services (health, nutrition, education, social protection). Finally, by supporting regional 
learning networks and climate change adaption practices, girls and women will have greater access to 
information that can build resilience and reduce migration as a coping strategy. 

82. 
Achievement of outcomes will be measured by a composite indicator of gender empowerment, 
including increased access to employment opportunities, land rights and rural productive assets, 
healthcare and nutritional supplements, and home gardening in food insecure districts.  Realizing more 
tangible gender-specific outcomes such as increased university level participation will take more time to 
achieve given the rise of traditionalism and cultural factors that are increasingly limiting the role of 
women in family and society.  

Cross-Cutting Theme—Governance:  

83. 
Governance challenges are cross cutting and pertinent to all pillars of the CPS. Under 
private sector-led growth, the priority will be to help improve economic governance, and reduce red tape 
and corruption. Some examples include: mandatory publication of pre-tender documents; expanding 
opportunities for new firms to bid on WBG-financed contracts; nationwide implementation of the e-filing 
tax system; improved rule of law and implementation of a more conducive investment climate and 
business regulation. This should lead to gradual increases in private investment, along with growth in 
productivity. 

84. 
Under the social inclusion pillar, efforts will be made to address three fundamental governance 
challenges faced by Tajikistan in improving service delivery, namely: (a) the efficient allocation of public 
resources, (b) their efficient and transparent use, and (c) the use of feedback mechanisms on service 
delivery. For example, ongoing education financing reforms supported by the CPS will help further 
improve the targeting of resources to schools by ensuring that money is allocated systematically on the 
basis of enrollment and other factors that directly affect the cost of education. In supporting structural 
reforms of the energy and financial sectors, the CPS will help improve corporate governance aimed at 
enhancing transparency, financial management and accountability. Finally, CPS-supported physical 
infrastructure projects (communal and urban, roads and energy) will undergo governance and institutional 
analysis and safeguards to ensure sustainability.  

Cross-Cutting Theme—Climate Change.  

85. 
Tajikistan is the most vulnerable country in ECA to the impacts of climate change due to climate 
stress and its low adaptive capacity. Recent droughts and weather extremes have underlined inadequacies 
in the climate resilience of major sectors, with increased threats to water resources, energy security, 
ecology, agriculture, and rural livelihoods.  CPS support across all three CPS pillars offer opportunities to 
address climate change vulnerabilities and seize low-emissions growth opportunities, for instance: private 
sector-led growth—more efficient use of energy resources (resilience and mitigation); social inclusion—

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sustainable land and water practices in rural areas (e.g., improved efficiency and resilience of irrigation 
systems and management, reduced erosion and flood/mudflow risk), better disaster risk management, 
treatment); regional connectivity—
improved sanitation (mitigation co-benefits of wastewater 
rehabilitation of road sections taking into account climate variability, new regional program for climate 
resilience (to design systematic and coordinated approach for efficient and scaled-up response to regional 
climate challenges). 

86. 
At the second Central Asian Regional Climate Forum (May 2014), a Central Asia regional project 
on climate change has been proposed to pilot approaches for better identification of local climate risks 
and their social dimensions in order to strengthen resilience through local planning.  Program elements 
may include improvement of data collection and management systems, institutional development to 
strengthen stakeholders’ capacity for climate action, and the identification and scaling-up of climate-
smart investment. The proposed regional project would be informed by national priorities and experience.   
As a PPCR country, Tajikistan is currently  helping communities adapt to climate change and improve 
rural land practices through the Rural Livelihoods project 

D. 

Implementing Bank Group Strategy 

87. 
The provisional IDA lending program comprises fourteen operations over four years 
(FY15-18), including Tajik components of two regional operations.  Six would support private sector 
development, six would focus on social inclusion, and two regional operations would concentrate on 
regional connectivity. As noted earlier, Tajikistan’s indicative allocation under IDA-17 is subject to the 
total IDA resources available, the country’s CPIA rating, the number and performance of other IDA-
eligible countries, and the terms of IDA assistance. In this latter connection, Tajikistan’s access to IDA 
would transition from full grant to 50:50 grant/credit during IDA-17.  

88. Meanwhile, the existing portfolio remains well aligned with the CPS’ strategic goal and 
three pillars.  As of January 2014, IDA’s portfolio comprised 13 active projects with net commitments 
totaling US$222.2 million, compared to 17 projects totaling US$208.8 million in July 2010.  This 
downward trend towards fewer operations of larger average size reflects an ongoing effort by regional 
and country management to consolidate the portfolio and maximize limited WBG budget resources with 
the goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness. The portfolio’s average age is 4.4 years—down from 
4.8 years in 2012—with 3 over 8 years old, entirely a result of additional financing. Portfolio quality 
overall is considered satisfactory, although the number of projects at risk has increased.  This is due both 
to portfolio age and institutional issues.  All are on a WBG-Government watch list and will be discussed 
in May 2014 at a joint review. The last joint WBG-ADB Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) 
held in July 2013 recommended that both the government and the two institutions need: (a) to continue 
efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of implementing agencies, in particular for  monitoring and 
evaluation; (b) to maintain and improve the linkage to sector institutional frameworks; and (c) to improve 
procurement procedures.  
89. 
IFC’s committed investment portfolio and active advisory portfolio are also aligned with 
the pillars of the proposed CPS. As of March 2014, IFC’s committed investment portfolio comprised of 
20 active projects with 12 clients stood at US$31.6 million, of which 90 percent disbursed. Investment 
portfolio is concentrated in microfinance and agribusiness.  IFC’s advisory portfolio includes 10 projects, 
most of which represent programmatic and/or regional engagements. The total funds managed by the IFC 
advisory projects total US$23 million (13 percent of the total for the ECA region). If reforms and 
regulatory improvements supported by IFC’s advisory projects materialize and if the infrastructure and 
mining sectors open up for private investments in the coming years, it may significantly increase IFC 
investment portfolio in Tajikistan over the period of the proposed CPS. . 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Development Partner Coordination 

90. 
All the main bilateral aid agencies are represented in Dushanbe, as are the principal 
multilateral institutions―ADB, EBRD, EDB, EU, IMF, and the United Nations Specialized 
Agencies. A Development Coordination Council (DCC), established in 2006 to enhance donor 
harmonization and alignment in the spirit of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, comprises 
the heads of 28 international agencies active in Tajikistan. Chaired by the WBG since early 2012, the 
DCC plays a key role in fostering country ownership and mutual accountability through several sector-
specific and thematic working groups. These are important because the management of external financial 
and technical assistance by and within the government remains fragmented and weak, despite significant 
investments in capacity building in recent years. At the 2012 meeting of the Tajikistan Development 
Forum chaired by President Rahmon, DCC partners re-affirmed their continued support for the country’s 
development and agreed on cross-sectoral, multi-partner coordinated initiatives designed to achieve 
measurable results by 2015. These initiatives are aligned with the six government priorities reflected in 
Tajikistan’s medium-term Living Standards Improvement Strategy (LSIS): public administration and 
governance; private sector-led growth; development of human potential; energy independence; food 
security; and, transport connectivity. 

E. 

Monitoring and Evaluation 

91. 
The CPS’ expected outcomes are expressed in the results framework attached at Annex 1.  
Based on discussions with the government and consultations with other stakeholders, it is organized 
around the CPS’ three pillars—private sector development, social inclusion, and regional connectivity—
and aligned with the three cross-cutting themes and the WBG’s corporate goals. These three areas are 
then disaggregated into selected NDS/LSIS country goals and related outcomes that the CPS program 
expects to influence and milestones that will be used to track progress. The matrix also identifies the 
lending and non-lending interventions that are intended to contribute towards the achievement of CPS 
outcomes. 

92. While the results framework is designed to monitor progress and measure outcomes, its 
application is intended to be flexible.  It provides an initial sense of strategic direction for WBG 
assistance, but should be considered flexible and subject to change if evolving government priorities or 
external developments so warrant. Similarly, the mapping of AAA by pillar and cross-cutting theme 
(Annex B4) is intended to be adaptable, especially for the two outer years. Progress would be monitored 
as part of routine project implementation support and supervision and a mid-term CPS Progress Report 
slated for end-FY16 would adjust, update, and extend the results framework as needed to reflect activities 
planned for FY17-18. A CPS Completion Report would be prepared during the first half of FY18.

These internal monitoring and evaluation activities would be supplemented by a number of 
in-country initiatives.  These would include, on the one hand, deeper engagement by selected civil 
society organizations and, on the other, periodic reviews by Development Coordination Council (DCC) 
partners of several CPS-related multi-partner, multi-sectoral initiatives. CPS implementation would also 
be assessed regularly in the framework of annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs), as 
well as quarterly mini-CPPRs of ‘problem’ or ‘at risk’ operations. As noted earlier, CSOs would be 
integrated into the project cycle, including in monitoring and evaluation of IDA-funded projects.  For 
example, under the Environmental Land Management and Rural Livelihoods Project, CSOs will actively 
participate in and help organize village-based communications and training activities, help facilitate 

29 

 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
coordination and collaboration across villages implementing land resource management investments, as 
well as support periodic monitoring and progress reporting. 

IV. MANAGING RISKS 

94. 
The overarching CPS objective of supporting transition to a new growth model based on 
increased private sector investment could be affected by adverse macroeconomic developments and 
stalled structural reforms.  While the WBG’s ability to mitigate macroeconomic risks is limited, the 
CPS will focus the dialogue on improvements in macroeconomic management and policies to accelerate 
growth, increase resilience to shocks, and build reserves.  To further structural reforms, the DPO series 
would aim to meet stretch goals for improved financial performance and reduced quasi-fiscal activities of 
state-owned enterprises, particularly in the banking and energy sectors.   If the DPO series is delayed or 
does not materialize, the WBG would continue to collaborate with development partners and facilitate 
dialogue on macro-fiscal and structural reforms under existing government-donor working groups.  In 
addition, the Bank will shift resources to operations where needs are extremely large (e.g. communal 
services) while the WBG will continue advisory services and investments to expand agribusiness and 
improve commercial operations of Barki Tajik.   

95. 
Improvements in public service delivery could be undermined by governance and 
institutional capacity constraints, including poor data quality.  To mitigate this risk, the WBG will 
expand its investment in PFM and public sector governance reforms with a strong focus on strengthening 
institutional capacity in core ministries, tax administration, and social sector agencies.   To strengthen 
decision-making, the Bank will support: i) the Ministry of Finance, to increase the availability of accurate 
and timely financial information; ii) Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, to improve public 
investment planning and prioritization; and iii) TajStat, to improve the quality of statistics, particularly 
related to poverty monitoring.     The WBG will also work with civil society groups to help monitor 
implementation of public service delivery and provide a feedback loop to government. 

96. 
Social fragility could reduce economic opportunities for youth and women.  Tajikistan is at 
risk of social fragility due to a variety of factors, including an increase in radicalism and rising 
traditionalism, which is constraining opportunities for girls to finish secondary school and for women to 
seek employment.  If migration is constrained as an outlet for economic subsistence, coping mechanisms 
for households will diminish rapidly and youth unemployment would worsen, which may lead to high 
levels of discontent.  The focus of the CPS on social inclusion will increase engagement with youth 
through higher education and empower women through land rights and improved access to services, 
while the poverty benefit will enable households to adjust to shocks. By increasing the role of the private 
sector, the CPS also seeks to lay the foundation for higher job creation over time. 

97. 
Regional dialogue, 
including Rogun assessment studies. The 
technical, economic, 
environmental and social assessments of the proposed Rogun Hydropower Plant are now in the final 
phase of a five-year process. With support from the World Bank, a fifth and final consultation with 
riparian countries will be conducted according to international standards of transparency and quality that 
will solicit comments from governments, CSOs, experts and citizens both in upstream and downstream 
countries. Riparian comments will be taken into consideration in final reports. Following riparian 
consultations, the disclosure of final Consultants' reports, Panel of Experts' reports, and a World Bank 
report will mark the end of the assessment process. The World Bank report will outline key 
considerations regarding the Rogun assessment studies for decision-makers, including international 
experience in water-sharing principles and mechanisms to ensure compliance and support coordination 
among the riparian countries. The risk is that, notwithstanding high technical quality of the reports and an 
open and transparent process followed in the assessment studies, regional tensions may increase due to 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
national differences in perception of energy and water needs. The World Bank will continue to work 
closely with all interested stakeholders and riparian countries, laying out the technical and institutional 
options for further regional dialogue, highlighting the potential for mutual economic benefits, and 
identifying areas that require better understanding by the Tajik government, including the macroeconomic 
and fiscal implications of financing a large public investment project from the budget. In addition, the 
World Bank through its Central Asia Energy-Water Development Program will continue serving as a 
knowledge exchange platform on energy security through regional trade; dialogue on energy-water 
linkages; and activities to improve water productivity.

Climate change is expected to 
bring more variability and 
instability to the large water 
resources of Tajikistan with 
growing risks to water 
availability for power 
production, agriculture, and 
human consumption, as well 
as extremes on the rise (glacial 
melt outburst, floods and 
droughts).  These anticipated 
impacts threaten the 
achievement of the country’s 
development priorities, food 
and energy security in 
particular.   
Tajikistan is highly vulnerable 
to the adverse impacts of 
global climate change, as it 
already suffers from low 
agricultural productivity, water 
stress, and high losses from 
disasters.  

Climate change impacts 
poverty by lowering 
agricultural yields, pushing 
people to migration, raising 
food prices, and increasing the

I. 

Introduction 

1. 
The Completion Report rates the achievement of CPS program objectives and outcomes overall 
as moderately satisfactory.  The first strategic objective—mitigating the impact of the 2008-09 global 
economic crises on poverty and vulnerability—was achieved. The WBG’s timely financial and technical 
assistance in FY10-11—two programmatic development policy grants (PDPGs) and additional financing for 
energy—facilitated Tajikistan’s rapid recovery from the effects of the global economic crisis and the 
continued decline in poverty during FY10-14. In addition, it helped mobilize emergency budget, energy, and 
humanitarian support from other development partners. The second strategic objective—paving the way for 
post-crisis recovery and sustained development—was mostly achieved. The WBG helped lay the institutional 
and legal foundation for improvements in the investment climate and financial sector, strengthened public 
administration and public finance management, enhanced access to higher quality social services, 
strengthened the energy sector and increased food security. While most qualitative and quantitative targets 
were met, implementation was uneven and fundamental governance, institutional capacity, and structural 
issues continue to constrain the country’s economic and social development. 

2. 
 The Completion Report rates the WBG’s performance in terms of CPS design and 
implementation as good.  The CPS’ design and content, anchored in Tajikistan’s long-term National 
Development Strategy (NDS), 2006-15, were highly relevant; and CPS implementation—in particular the 
linkage between rapid responses to the country’s short-term post-crisis needs and the structural reforms 
mandated by its long-term development strategy (NDS)—reflected changing circumstances and priorities 
appropriately. A sound program of ongoing lending activities and analytical and advisory services is in place 
for the next strategy period.  

II. 

Progress toward Country Development Goals 

A. Growth 

3. 
Tajikistan’s macroeconomic outcomes during the FY10-14 CPS period—exemplified by its 
rapid recovery from the effects of the 2008-09 global economic downturn and the resumption of 
remittance-driven growth averaging 7 percent—were better than expected.  Although facing the crisis 
from a weak position, the economy withstood the global recession effectively thanks to prudent economic 
management by the authorities and timely external assistance by the country’s development partners. 
Regarding the former, the government’s two-pronged anti-crisis strategy provided for increased public 
spending, including on social programs to create jobs, and for exchange rate flexibility to facilitate current 
43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
account adjustment. Rising international prices for aluminum and cotton during 2009-2011, Tajikistan’s two 
principal exports, also helped. Regarding external assistance, several development partners, including the 
WBG, committed quick-disbursing budget support equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2009, which helped 
finance and reduce the fiscal deficit. No less important, it enabled the government in 2010 and 2011 to 
maintain the 2009 share of the budget allocated to education, health, and social protection. Against this 
background, GDP growth, after slowing to 3.9 percent in 2009, recovered to 6.5 percent in 2010 and for the 
next three years, 2011-13, averaged about 7.3 percent annually. 

4. 
Despite these satisfactory results, the vulnerability of Tajikistan’s economy and budget to 
external shocks and internal constraints remained essentially unchanged.  External risks include the 
country’s reliance on imports of fuel and food, both subject to periodic price volatility, as well as its exposure 
to increasingly serious trade and transit obstacles imposed by Uzbekistan. These negatively impacted 
government receipts as well as the real economy throughout the period. At the same time, two major internal 
weaknesses persisted: first, the financial sector’s fragility, compounded by continued government-directed 
lending through commercial banks; and second, the quasi-fiscal activities of large state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs), including soft budget constraints in the form of arrears and the provision of non-commercial 
services. 

5. 
Tajikistan’s single most serious vulnerability, however, is its large and growing dependence on 
remittances, which grew exponentially during 2002-12—from 5 to 45 percent of GDP.  Exceeding other 
forms of capital inflow, remittances have become an integral part of the country’s growth and development, 
but also a double-edged sword. On the one hand, accounting for an estimated 80 percent of consumption by 
the poorest rural households and 50 percent by that of the poorest urban households, remittances will likely 
remain important contributors to poverty reduction in the short- and medium-term.18 On the other, despite 
these and other economic benefits, the costs of migration to society and individual families are also 
significant. Moreover, migration is not per se a source of sustainable long-term growth. Its contribution to 
economic development could be more productive, however, if remittances were channeled into private 
investment, rather than consumption, and if there were employment opportunities for skilled migrants to 
apply their new knowledge.  

B. 

Poverty 

6. 
Up to the start of the CPS, poverty had declined dramatically and shared prosperity increased.  
According to official data based on the Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS), the poverty headcount 
fell from 81 percent in 1999 to 47 percent in 2009; and extreme poverty dropped even faster—from 73 
percent to 14 percent during the same decade. Recent albeit not comparable survey data show continued 
progress in poverty reduction and shared prosperity: according to preliminary estimates based on the 
government’s household budget survey, 14 percent of the population could not afford the food poverty line 
while 36 percent fell below the upper poverty line in 2012. During 2003-09, wages and remittances 
accounted for half and 30 percent respectively of the decline in poverty. The benefits of growth were also 
widely shared, with consumption of the bottom 40 percent increasing more rapidly than that of the population 
at large. Besides the overall decline in poverty, several important non-income aspects of living standards also 
improved.  

7. 
Despite these achievements, significant social development challenges remain.  Poverty remains 
widespread and linked to specific factors, such as continued high fertility (at 3.8, the highest in the CIS), 
insufficient jobs (with young people, over 40 percent of the population, accounting for 60 percent of 
registered unemployed), and the uneven impact of remittances on different population groups. The poor 
continue to be disadvantaged by limited access to relevant education and good quality health care and receive 
little help from a weak social protection system whose benefits until very recently were small and poorly

targeted. Health outcomes are lower than in other Europe and Central Asia (ECA) countries and Tajikistan 
ranks the lowest in ECA on gender.  

C. Other Development Outcomes 

8. 
Tajikistan’s progress towards five NDS goals supported by the CPS varied widely. 19  Key 
aspects of the structural reform agenda remained for the most part works in progress—a reminder that in 
countries with weak institutions, powerful vested interests, and nascent civil society organizations, strategic 
goals need to be realistic and the pace of change is slow. The latter is also a lingering legacy of Tajikistan’s 
post-independence civil war (1992-97), which not only destroyed physical and social infrastructure and 
depleted human and intellectual capital, but also delayed the country’s overall economic and political 
transition by at least a decade. 

9. 
Outcomes for private sector development were uneven, with significant advances in terms of 
institutions, legislation, and policy, but limited progress in terms of implementation and thus impact.  
At the macro level, the government took a wide range of legal and regulatory measures designed to improve 
the overall business environment: for example, signing the New York Arbitration Convention, applying for 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate status, and—a landmark step in terms of 
broadening and deepening the country’s links with the international economy—joining the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) in 2013. These were matched at the micro level by some progress in reducing the 
burden of regulation on businesses and curbing government intervention in the economy. Nonetheless, 
outcomes in terms of private investment, only 5 percent of GDP, and the private sector’s share of the formal 
economy, barely 50 percent, were disappointing. Moreover, Tajikistan attracts only limited foreign direct 
private investment: for example, state-led infrastructure investment and official loans from China and Russia 
accounted for over 45 percent of foreign investment in 2012. Meanwhile, ranked 143 out of 185 countries in 
the most recent Doing Business, Tajikistan’s 2014 result, though slightly worse than 2013 (141) and way 
below the ECA average (73), was somewhat better than in 2012 (147) and 2011 (152).  

10. 
Outcomes for public administration, public finance management and more broadly, 
strengthened government efficiency were in line with expectations for a fragile state still in transition.  
There were significant advances in defining policies and strategies and enacting decrees, laws, and 
regulations for reforming public administration, including for merit-based recruitment of civil servants, 
performance-based salary administration, and the re-organization of 10 key ministries. Similar progress was 
recorded in improving public finance management, which included the introduction of a medium-term 
expenditure framework, a single treasury account, a unified chart of accounts, a new budget classification 
aligned with the new automated treasury management information system, a revised tax code, and early 
progress in tax administration reforms. However, implementation has been incremental and, given current 
capacity and the long gestation period required, the modernization of Tajikistan’s public administration and 
public finance management is likely to take at least another decade. 

11. 
Results in terms of enhancing access to higher quality social services, especially for the poor, 
and progress towards achieving the country’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were uneven. 
Although Tajikistan appears to be on track to meet its poverty, education, environmental sustainability, and 
global partnership MDGs, those for health and gender are unlikely to be met. Infant, child and maternal 
mortality are declining but more slowly than needed. Despite institutional reforms in the financing, 
management, and delivery of public health services, outcomes in terms of health status remain difficult to 
measure, owing at least partly to insufficient or poor quality data. Moreover, the content and especially the 
quality of these services—a concern in both health and education—remain problematical. Meanwhile, the 
country’s scores on gender indices are low for higher education as well as for economic and political 

19 NDS goals include: (a) improving the investment climate, private sector, and entrepreneurship; (b) strengthening public 
administration and public finance management; (c) enhancing access to higher quality social services; (d) strengthening the energy 
sector; and (e) increasing agricultural productivity and food security. 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
empowerment. The key issues include: disparities in favor of boys throughout the education system, 
especially at university level; gender-based occupational and sectoral segregation and resulting earnings 
inequities; and weak implementation of gender-proactive policies.  

12. Meanwhile, energy—a constraint on the economy’s growth potential and a drain on the 
budget—remained a major challenge.  Tajikistan’s energy system does not provide reliable electricity to 
consumers and runs large deficits that are financed through under-investment in capital and maintenance and 
by tax and inter-enterprise arrears. On the other hand, government efforts to improve the operational and 
financial management and transparency of the two main energy utilities (Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgaz) 
helped reduce their financial and technical losses during the period. Some of these gains were reversed in 
2013, raising questions about sustainability. Progress was also made in regional plans to export summer 
surplus electricity from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan.  

13. 
Finally, there was significant progress in improving agricultural productivity and increasing 
food security.  Agriculture accounted for 14 percent of aggregate economic growth during the period, driven 
mainly by ongoing land reforms and the liberalization of the domestic market for cotton. In 2012, the 
government adopted a 22-point agricultural reform action plan for 2012-20, which includes measures to 
expand farmers’ access to inputs, including credit, irrigation and extension services, and to ensure sustainable 
use and improved management of natural resources. A key measure in this context was action to improve 
farmers’ property rights. While full implementation of these reforms will necessarily take time and may face 
obstacles by vested interests, the early signs appear positive. 

14. 
Against this background, Section III below assesses how the CPS program contributed to, or 
influenced the country’s development goals during FY10-14. Annex 1 summarizes the country team’s self-
evaluation of specific outcomes compared to those expected in the CPS’ results framework.   

III. 

Highlights of CPS Program Performance 

Strategic Objective 1:  Mitigating the impact of the 2008-09 global economic crisis on poverty and 
vulnerability. CPSCR Rating—Achieved.  

15. 
The WBG’s response to Tajikistan’s needs for emergency budget, energy, and humanitarian 
support was proactive, prompt, and pragmatic. The principal instruments were two single-tranche 
Programmatic Development Policy Grants (PDPGs 4 and 5) totaling US$35.4 million approved in FY10 and 
FY11, as well as additional financing of US$15 million for Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance (FY10) 
and a Public Employment for Sustainable Agriculture and Water Management project (PAMP), financed by a 
€7.42 million grant from the European Union Facility for Rapid Response to the Financial Crisis. Together, 
these helped ease the short-term fiscal impact of reduced revenues, lower remittances, and volatile prices. 
Supplemented by similar budget-related support from the ADB, EU, and IMF, the government was enabled 
to maintain public spending on education, health, and social protection in 2010 and 2011 at the targeted 
(2008) baseline of 42 percent, and thus to mitigate the crisis’ adverse impact on poor and vulnerable groups. 
Overall, the WBG provided directly (through IDA) or mobilized (through trust funds) about US$68 million 
for emergency budget, energy, and humanitarian support. Results on the ground included: (a) Dushanbe’s 
power grid and district heating systems were rehabilitated to ensure winter energy supply to hospitals, 
schools, and households; (b) about 150,000 households were helped to increase their food output and reduce 
livestock losses; and (c) a community-based drainage and irrigation infrastructure public works program in 
five food-insecure districts employed over 10,000 poor people and generated net incomes of over US$200 per 
person. A particular achievement was the short-term PAMP operation, which used a combination of public 
works to renovate irrigation and drainage infrastructure and support for reform of water management to 
improve household food security in the short, medium and long-term in five districts in Khatlon oblast. 
Encouraged by the success of this initiative, the government subsequently secured financing from the Global 
46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) and IDA for a second, larger operation (PAMP II) in FY13, 
implemented in coordination with USAID, to create further temporary employment in low income rural 
areas, raise crop production over a wider area, and further strengthen water resources management.  

16. 
Besides these contributions to short-term crisis mitigation, the CPS also supported longer-term 
NDS goals to broaden access to social services for the poor and social protection to vulnerable groups.  
Four human development operations, two ongoing and two approved during the CPS, facilitated longer-term 
structural reforms in education, health, and social assistance.  These included: (a) continued implementation 
of the national strategy for education development (2006-15) aimed at increasing school enrollments, 
addressing gender inequities, and improving education quality, in particular through the nationwide 
implementation of per capita financing for general education; (b) adoption of a long-term health sector 
strategy (2010-20) designed to improve efficiency, effectiveness, equity and quality through increased public 
funding of primary health care; and (c) introduction of pilot schemes designed to consolidate multiple 
existing social assistance programs and their more precise targeting to those most in need. This enabled 
achievement of the CPS’ two original social services outcomes—maintaining access to basic education and 
primary health care; and partial achievement of those for social protection—creating short-term jobs in rural 
areas, and reforming social assistance coverage.  

17. 
The PDPG series bridged crisis mitigation and efforts to promote sustainable growth—
anticipating and in line with the CPS’ 2nd strategic objective.  These included reforms to help improve 
the climate for private investment and also to increase the government’s effectiveness. The former involved 
reducing the rate of corporate income tax, cutting the number of days and procedures needed to start a 
business, and creating a one-stop shop for company registration. The latter included strengthening public 
administration capacity (agencies, committees, ministries, etc.), improving public financial management 
(single treasury account), and enhancing the transparency of large SOEs (published audited accounts). These 
PDPG-supported reforms complemented and reinforced those being carried out under ongoing IDA-financed 
investment projects in agriculture, education, health, and social protection, as well as technical assistance for 
public administration and public financial management modernization. Progress in both areas is reviewed in 
more detail below.   

Strategic Objective 2:  Paving the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development.  CPSCR 
Rating—Mostly Achieved 

18. 
To pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development, the CPS supported five 
NDS goals and sought to achieve a large number of outcomes.  The five goals were: (a) to improve 
Tajikistan’s investment climate and develop the private sector and entrepreneurship; (b) to raise agricultural 
productivity; (c) to expand the country’s energy potential, including measures to alleviate electricity 
shortages and increase exports; (d) to enhance the population’s access to water supply and sanitation; and (e) 
to increase the quantity and quality of social services for the poor. Following adoption of the medium-term 
Living Standards Improvement Strategy (LSIS) in 2012, the CPSPR realigned the results framework and 
simplified its indicators and outcomes. Thus, support for the second and third goals was revised—from 
raising agricultural productivity to increasing food security, and from expanding the country’s energy 
potential to strengthening energy security; and the fourth and fifth goals were consolidated—from enhancing 
the population’s access to water supply and sanitation and increasing the quantity and quality of social 
services for the poor—to improving access to higher quality social services. At the same time, the number of 
intended outcomes was reduced from 34 to a more manageable, though still ambitious 24. Meanwhile, the 
CPS’ original third strategic objective and cross-cutting theme—to mainstream core governance reforms—
was revised to become one of its five specific objectives, namely to improve public administration and public 
finance management. 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial and private sector development—CPSCR rating: Achieved 

19. 
CPS support for financial sector development focused on improving the legislative framework 
and building the required human and institutional infrastructure.  It included a vulnerability assessment 
of the banking system and advice on banking legislation relating inter alia to the central bank, commercial 
banking, deposit insurance, the payments system, and bank insolvency, as well as payment systems 
development, secured transactions, banking supervision, and contingency planning. It also helped the 
authorities prepare a medium-term financial sector development strategy and action plan and mobilized 
financial support for its implementation. Meanwhile, the Private Sector Competitiveness project (FY12) 
includes three financial sector components: the creation of a modern, on-line collateral registry; the upgrading 
of the central bank’s real-time gross settlement payment system; and the further strengthening of the banking 
system’s regulatory and supervisory framework.  

20. 
Complementing 
these activities, IFC supported strengthening of domestic 
financial 
intermediaries and expanding access to finance for MSMEs and farmers through a combination of 
investment and advisory services in the following areas: 

 

Improving the regulatory framework for microfinance and credit reporting: IFC’s advisory 
projects—Financial Market Infrastructure and Transformation for MFIs—provided advice on 
developing a legal and regulatory framework for credit reporting, supported the creation of a 
private credit bureau, and helped enact an improved microfinance law that included provisions 
for licensing, consumer protection, and standardized microfinance practices. 
 Building capacity within the microfinance sector: Through its Transformation for MFIs project, 
IFC assisted four leading microfinance institutions (MFIs)—Imon, HUMO, Arvand and 
FINCA—improve their operations and expand the range of their services. Specifically, IFC 
helped these MFIs attract financing of US$90 million—debt and equity—and supported 
expansion of their MSME on-lending capacity. Their outstanding loan portfolio has increased 
from about US$45 million in 2009 to nearly US$183 million in 2013. As of December 2013, 
three of the four institutions were profitable, serving together about 155,000 clients.  
 Providing debt and equity finance to financial intermediaries: IFC provided much needed short- 
and long-term capital to banking and microfinance clients, including First Microfinance Bank, 
Eskhata Bank, Access Bank, and Imon. In total, IFC provided senior loans totaling to about 
US$16 million, trade finance of about US$5 million, as well as two currency SWOPs to allow 
client MFIs to swap a portion of their foreign exchange denominated borrowings into somoni 
and, hence, hedge their liabilities against possible fluctuations in the exchange rate.  
 Supporting development of leasing finance: IFC’s Agri-Finance and Regulatory Reform project 
supported improvements in the legislative framework for leasing. Specifically, the project 
facilitated the abolition of the 18 percent VAT on leasing, as well as several other improvements 
in tax and custom duties treatment of agricultural machinery and equipment. These significantly 
reduced direct compliance costs, making it possible to increase the scale and profitability of 
leasing operations, particularly in agribusiness. In parallel, this project assisted financial 
intermediaries introduce agro-finance and agro-leasing products and helped raise farmers’ 
awareness. As a result, the project attracted more than US$6 million investments in greenfield 
and existing leasing operators. More broadly, it helped stimulate strong growth in leasing overall, 
which expanded from estimated about US$4.7 million in 2011 to about US$12.7 million in 2013.   

21. 
To help improve the investment climate and promote private sector development—the theme of 
the 2011 Country Economic Memorandum—the PDPG series and IFC supported a variety of 
government efforts.  The most significant and visible was implementation of a ‘single-window’ business 
registration system, which applies to both domestic and foreign applicants and reduces the bureaucracy and, 
in theory, the time required to open a business to five working days. Other business-friendly reforms 
included: reducing business inspections; protecting investors; registering property; reducing the number of 

48 

 
   
 
 
 
permits from more than 600 to 86 and their coverage; and creating a ‘single window’ to simplify import and 
export procedures and processes. In consultation with IDA, IFC provided technical assistance to help draft 
Tajikistan’s new tax code, which cuts the number of taxes and simplifies tax reporting and payment 
procedures. In addition, IFC cooperated with the IDA-financed Tax Administration project to support the 
design and implementation of a risk-based audit system based on objective risk parameters, which was 
piloted in Dushanbe city and is now being rolled out nationwide. 

22. With CPS advice and assistance, the government adopted an aviation policy that initiated 
liberalization of air transport—an important first step towards extending Tajikistan’s regional 
connectivity.  Meanwhile, the Private Sector Competitiveness project includes provision for developing a 
modern mining cadaster, revising mining policy and institutions, and carrying out a strategic environmental 
and social assessment of the mining sector overall. Finally, IDA and IFC jointly supported the development 
of a new law on public-private partnerships (PPPs) to promote private investment in infrastructure and social 
services. Subsequently, with ADB support, the authorities established a PPP Center in the State Investment 
Committee to help bring PPP transactions to market. While IFC advisory work on a concession for the 
Konimansuri Kalon silver mine did not result in a successful tender, the process contributed to Tajikistan’s 
signing of the New York Arbitration Convention and the adoption of a new law on investment agreements. 

Increasing food security—CPSCR rating: Mostly Achieved 

23. 
Effective steps were taken to raise agricultural productivity and increase food security.  With 
agriculture and rural development accounting for the largest share of the IDA portfolio, support for raising 
agricultural productivity was provided through four long-standing operations approved before the CPS period 
and, during the CPS, by additional financing for Fergana Valley Water Resources Management (FY10) and 
Land Registration and Cadaster for Sustainable Agriculture (FY12) and the 2nd Public Employment for 
Sustainable Agriculture (PAMP II) project (FY13). Three of five CPS outcomes—improved access to land, 
increased crop yields, and lower flooded/water-logged areas—were comfortably achieved, and a fourth 
designed to monitor the degree of government interference in farmers’ crop choices (or ‘freedom to farm’) 
was partly achieved, according to beneficiary surveys undertaken in 2013.  The emphasis of this CPS 
objective was shifted mid-term from raising agricultural productivity to increasing food security—a 
presidential priority underlined in the new medium-term 2013-15 Living Standards Improvement Strategy 
(LSIS).  This objective was to be measured by increased incomes in PAMP and related actions of 
development partners.  The annual incremental revenue per beneficiary household increased from US$400 to 
US$550 from productivity investments and from US$140 to US$550 from land resource investments. 

24. Meanwhile, a high-level joint government/development partner Working Group on Agricultural 
Reform was created to help design a comprehensive agriculture reform strategy, comprising six main sub-
groups: for water and irrigation, land reform, agricultural credit, rural social development, local government 
reform, and cotton debt. In cooperation with other development partners, the WBG supported measures to 
improve the enabling environment for agriculture based on an action plan for reform developed by these sub-
working groups. Priority areas supported through lending and technical assistance included: (a) water 
resources management, including technical assistance for policy and institutional reform; (b) farmland re-
structuring through amendment of the law on dehkan farms; (c) development of agro-leasing market and 
alternative agricultural financing instruments; and (d) creating new institutional arrangements for improved 
water management (e.g. river basin authorities).  A major turning point underpinning progress in all these 
areas was adoption of the Land Code in 2012 and legal framework for land and real estate registration, 
allowing leasehold land rights to be traded and held as secure property rights for the first time.

Strengthening energy security—CPSCR rating: Mostly Achieved 

25. 
Incremental progress was achieved in strengthening the country’s energy sector. CPS support 
for strengthening the energy sector included the ongoing Energy Loss Reduction (FY05) project (including 
additional financing approved in FY12), which helped reduce electricity losses from 19.3 percent in 2008 to 
49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 percent in 2013, and gas losses from 16.8 percent in 2008 to 7 percent for gas in 2013, through installation 
of electricity and gas meters and, in addition, improved the operational management and financial viability of 
the two main energy utilities. Audited financial statements were made publicly available for the first time.  It 
also financed strategic studies inter alia to prepare the proposed regional (Central Asia-South Asia) (summer 
surplus) electricity export project (CASA-1000) and the economic and technical feasibility of the proposed 
Rogun hydropower project.  PDPG6 supported an energy audit of TALCO, the largest single consumer of 
electricity that led to an action plan to enable efficiency gains of 22 percent in four years.  Meanwhile, a 
flagship study published in November 2012—Tajikistan’s Winter Energy Crisis: Electricity Supply and 
Demand Alternatives—recommended measures: (a) to reduce domestic demand, in particular a broad-based 
energy efficiency program that limits commercial and technical losses and aligns tariffs to reflect full cost 
recovery; (b) to increase domestic supply, including rehabilitation of existing hydropower assets and 
implementation of a proposed new thermal power plant; and (c) to increase regional electricity trade, 
especially during winter energy deficit months. Against this background, CPS outcomes for reduced power 
outages, lower commercial and technical losses, and improved transparency in the financial management of 
Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgaz were all substantially achieved, though a delay in implementation of cost 
recovery tariffs in 2013 led to a subsequent deterioration in Barki Tajik’s finances. Progress was also made in 
the regional Central Asia-South Asia (CASA-1000) project, which was approved on March 31, 2014, with 
IFC providing technical support for procurement, in particular the pre-qualification of bidders for the first 
major infrastructure package. 

Improving access to higher quality social services—CPSCR rating: Partially Achieved 

26. 
CPS support for higher quality social services (besides water supply and sanitation) focused 
originally on four education and two health outcomes that were later revised and increased to eight, of 
which five were Tajikistan’s MDGs for education and health.  The addition of the MDGs to Bank CPS 
objectives was unintentional and this mistake contributed to less than satisfactory results, because health 
indicators such as infant and maternal mortality are higher-level objectives that cannot be achieved through 
sector-level interventions.  Infant and maternal mortality indicators are unlikely to be achieved by 2015. On 
the other hand, in areas where the CPS sought to make progress, the government increased public spending 
on health, albeit from a low base, and initiated per capita financing of primary health care and case-based 
financing of hospital services in two oblasts. Thus, public spending on primary health care as a share of total 
health expenditures in these two oblasts increased substantially and the annual number of primary health care 
visits to health facilities per capita improved somewhat. Against this background, the recently approved 
results-based Health Services Improvement project (FY14), designed to move away from the previous 
emphasis on health system inputs to the achievement of tangible health results, aims to consolidate ongoing 
reforms and link payments to performance. 

27. 
Regarding education, foundational reforms in financing and governance are helping Tajikistan 
cope with serious structural problems—of opportunity, quality, relevance, and also of size.  Outcomes 
of targeted CPS support for education—through both IDA and bilateral trust fund support (Education for All 
Fast Track Initiative grants and the Russian Education Aid for Development (READ) program—were broadly 
satisfactory. For example, per capita financing for general education has now been in place nationwide since 
2010, well ahead of the original timetable; an education management information system, operational 
nationally since 2009, will be extended to all subsectors by 2015, providing key education data to inform and 
improve policy decision-making; a new long-term national strategy for educational development was adopted 
in 2012; a national testing center became operational in 2012; and, at the tertiary level, a unified university 
entrance examination was piloted for the current 2013-14 academic year and completed registration for 
applications to the 2014-15 school year. These last two developments constitute especially important steps 
towards reducing corruption in the education system.  Meanwhile, two education MDGs—100 percent net 
primary school enrollment and 98 percent of girls completing nine years of education—have been achieved 
or are on track. With numerous other development partners involved in Tajikistan’s education system, the 
WBG played an important coordinating role, especially regarding reforms relating to per capita financing, 
the education management information system, and the new unified university entrance examination.  
50 

 
 
 
 
28. 
Outcomes relating to safe water access were only partially achieved.  The CPS’ urban water 
supply and sanitation objectives for improved urban water accessibility and for lower commercial and 
technical losses were only partially achieved due to slow implementation and weak monitoring and 
evaluation of the decade-long Dushanbe Water Supply project (DWSP) that closed in FY12.  After a slow 
start, DWSPII is on track to meet higher financial and service targets by 2015.  Progress towards improving 
basic community services including water supply in seven municipalities under the ongoing Municipal 
Infrastructure Development project, for which additional financing was approved in FY12, increased the 
share of the population with access to water services in those municipalities to 70 percent by 2012, 10 points 
more than in 2006. 

Improving public administration public finance management—CPSCR rating: Partially Achieved 

29. 
Outcomes for the public administration reforms supported by the CPS were substantially 
achieved.  The now completed Public Sector Reform Technical Assistance project (FY07) helped the 
government design its public administration reform strategy, in particular the legal and organizational basis 
for improved public sector management, enhanced public access to information, and a strengthened 
regulatory framework. Meanwhile, the PDPG series supported introduction of a civil service performance 
appraisal system in February 2011, as well as an action plan to implement it, which involved extensive 
training as well as informational and awareness-raising events. More recently, it facilitated enactment of a 
new law on public administration clarifying the functions of the executive branch of government through a 
three-tier structure that assigns development of national strategies to the Executive Office of the President, 
definition of sectoral policies to line ministries, and implementation and regulatory functions to agencies and 
services. Finally, it also helped with the development and initial implementation of a new performance-based 
salary grid for all central government employees, enhancing the transparency of remuneration and increasing 
the salaries of young professionals whose recruitment and retention had become problematic.  On the other 
hand, competitive recruitment is not increasing in line with the CPS indicator.  

30. 
 The ongoing Public Financial Management Modernization project (FY09) complemented by a 
multi-donor trust fund put in place foundational reforms.  Using an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 
approach, it helped introduce basic processes for more efficient and transparent management of public 
expenditure, in particular the development of capacity in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to operate and 
maintain an automated financial management information system. It also supported creation of a single 
treasury account and, by end-2012, its extension to four local treasuries in Dushanbe and Tursunzade. All 
four intended CPS outcomes were achieved—introduction of administrative budget classification, publication 
of budget execution reports, and enactment of an external audit law including creation of an independent 
external audit body—leading to an increase in the PEFA indicator for budget classification (P15) to B. Going 
forward, the Tax Administration Reform project (FY13) seeks to improve the quality of taxpayer services, 
enhance the level of voluntary compliance, reduce the size of the shadow economy, and contribute toward to 
a more accountable, effective and transparent tax system. It builds on intensive government efforts, supported 
by IFC and several development partners, to implement the revised tax code enacted in 2012. 

31. 
CPS support for Tajikistan’s country governance and anti-corruption (CGAC) strategy took 
the form of a four year (2010-14) US$3.8 million Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) grant. Its main 
purpose was to mainstream WBG governance-related activities in Tajikistan, in particular to shift from broad-
based country-level engagement as the primary intervention (e.g. public sector reform) towards a more 
comprehensive multi-dimensional approach. The GPF grant’s intended beneficiaries and stakeholders were 
the executive and legislative branches of government as well as civil society and non-governmental 
organizations. Although improving governance overall in Tajikistan will clearly be a gradual long-term 
process, GPF grant-financed activities since 2010 have helped develop institutional policies and procedures 
in  the country as well as processes within the WBG that have started to bear fruit. The primary country 
outcomes achieved include: improved understanding of accountability and transparency issues in particular 
sectors, including an energy-audit of the Tajikistan Aluminum Company (TALCO)—the largest state-owned 
51 

 
 
 
 
 
  
enterprise in the country; definition of a new, more comprehensive, sustainable approach to capacity 
development, including through strengthening the Civil Service Agency and Public Administration Institute; 
greater demand for good governance within Tajikistan inter alia through capacity building of civil society 
organizations (CSOs)—to facilitate their participation in monitoring and evaluating WBG-financed 
projects—and creation of a CSO database; and institutionalization of the budget review process in 
Tajikistan’s parliament, which now participates in the overall public finance management reform agenda and 
better understands its role in budget formulation and monitoring. Improved processes within the WBG 
include: creation of a comprehensive dataset—as a tool to promote good governance and for use in analytical 
and diagnostic work by the WBG and its development partners; and better designed ‘governance-smart’ 
projects through introduction of a checklist of political economy questions (including stakeholders’ analyses) 
designed to ensure that governance considerations are taken into account during project preparation and 
implementation;   

Program Outcomes 

32. 
Against this background, the Completion Report rates the achievement of outcomes foreseen in 
the CPS overall as moderately satisfactory.  The reasons for this assessment are as follows.  

 First, the WBG’s timely financial and technical assistance in FY10-11—two PDPGs and 
additional financing for energy—facilitated Tajikistan’s rapid recovery from the effects of the 
global economic crisis and the continued decline in poverty. In addition, it helped mobilize 
emergency budget, energy, and humanitarian support from other development partners.  

 Second, through the PDPGs, investment operations and analytical and advisory services, the 
WBG helped lay the legal and institutional foundation for improvements in the investment 
climate and financial sector. Results included: a reduction in the number of permits and taxes, as 
well as lower costs for the private sector to comply with regulations; amendments to banking and 
deposit insurance laws, and establishment of a functioning Credit Bureau. Revised land and 
aviation policies increased competitiveness in two key sectors. However, implementation was 
uneven and fundamental governance and structural issues continue to constrain financial 
intermediation and private investment far below the levels needed for sustainable, inclusive 
growth. 

 Third, the CPS supported important financing, institutional, and service delivery reforms in 
education, health, and social protection. Per capita-based financing was applied nationally in 
education and a unified university entrance examination was designed and piloted.  In social 
protection, a poverty benefit was successfully tested and expanded to 10 districts, which is more 
than twice as effective in reaching the poorest households as the current method.  Due to two 
unrealistic indicators, intended results in health were only partly achieved. Likewise, despite 
progress towards improving water supply in selected municipalities, the pace of implementation 
in Dushanbe, the capital, was less than satisfactory. 

 Fourth, the modest project-specific outcomes foreseen for energy and for agriculture, including 
food security, were substantially achieved. Yet, many first-generation reforms e.g. land reform 
and systems for financial accountability in Barki Tajik, still require significant investment.  

 Fifth, CPS outcomes for public finance management were achieved. There was also good overall 
progress in public administration reform, evidenced inter alia by the improved CPIA rating, 
although due to overly ambitious objectives, the CPS’ outcomes were only partly achieved.  

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Finally, Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) activities increased knowledge and generated 
demand for governance improvements by civil society organizations (CSOs), the budget 
committee of parliament, and the civil service agency. 

IV. World Bank Group Performance 

33. 
Commitments during the CPS period to date total US$227.1 million—US$157.2 million, or 
almost 70 percent, for 11 new operations and US$69.9 million, or 30 percent, for additional financing 
of 7 ongoing operations.  This represents an average of about US$45 million annually and US$14 million 
per new operation. About 60 percent of the US$84.6 million committed in the two post-crisis years was front-
loaded and approved in FY10. Development policy lending of US$55.4 million accounted for 24 percent of 
the total; and by sector, agriculture, rural development and water resources accounted for 19 percent; 
education, health, social assistance and water supply for 24 percent; energy for 14 percent; and private sector 
development and tax administration for 12 percent. Eight approvals totaling US$76.1 million, or 30 percent, 
were additional financing to scale up ongoing operations. Highlights of the non-lending program included: a 
country economic memorandum (CEM), a programmatic public expenditure review (ongoing), a 
comprehensive agriculture sector study, an analysis of Tajikistan’s winter energy deficit, the Rogun 
hydropower assessment studies, and a regional growth and development study of Khatlon. 

34. 
Trust Funds continued to be an important supplement to IDA resources, accounting for about 
20 percent of total combined commitments.  During the CPS period, more than US$51 million was 
mobilized—about half for agriculture and rural development and the balance for education, public law and 
administration, and health. About US$19 million of these funds have disbursed to date, slightly lower than 
the IDA portfolio five-year average. Tajikistan’s trust fund portfolio comprising 57 active operations with net 
commitments totaling more than US$100 million is currently one of the largest in ECA. Tajikistan is also one 
of nine countries selected by the Climate Investment Fund (CIF) for implementation of Pilot Programs for 
Climate Resistance (PPCR). 

35. 
As of January, 2014, the portfolio comprised 13 active projects with net commitments totaling 
US$222.2 million, compared to 17 projects totaling US$208.8 million in mid-2009 at the start of the 
CPS period.  This downward trend towards fewer operations of larger average size reflects a conscious effort 
by regional and country management to consolidate the portfolio and the WBG’s implementation support and 
supervision resources with the goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness. The portfolio’s average age is 
currently 3.8 years—up slightly from 3.5 years in 2010—with three operations over 8 years old, all a direct 
result of extensions for additional financing. While portfolio quality overall is judged satisfactory, it 
continues to experience implementation challenges, especially delays in grant effectiveness and in 
procurement, specifically in bid evaluation due to the involvement of the State Committee for Investment and 
Property Management Committee (SCIPM) and the lengthy internal approval process. However, there 
appears to be no common thread between operations facing challenges, with the issues being irrespective of 
sector or the project’s age. 

36. Meanwhile, IFC investments during the CPS period to date totaled US$31.5 million in 12 
projects. These included US$5.2 million through a trade finance line with Eskhata Bank, US$5.1 million 
through a global agribusiness project with a commodity trading company ECOM, and a US$2.2 million loan 
to Nutristar, a French-owned local producer of high quality feed for livestock. Other operations included 
loans to, and equity investments in existing clients—First Microfinance Bank, Tajik Access Bank and 
IMON—and related advisory and technical assistance. As of February 2014, IFC’s committed investment 
portfolio of US$27.8 million comprised 20 active projects with 12 clients.  IFC’s outstanding portfolio during 
the CPS period more than doubled—from US$12.1 million to US$24.7 million—indicating improved project 
implementation. IFC’s advisory services during the period amounted to US$14.1 million, mainly financed by 
various development partners.  

53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
37. 
 Performance in terms of acting upon lessons learned from the previous (FY05-09) CPS was 
broadly satisfactory.  The principal operational recommendations of the previous CPS Completion Report 
included: greater selectivity; a continued mix of development policy and investment lending; a more 
aggressive use of analytical and advisory activities as an advocacy and dissemination instrument, especially 
in areas of limited buy-in by the authorities; and continued efforts to harmonize development partners’ 
support. The substance of these recommendations was reflected in the CPS’ design and informed its 
implementation. While the initial results matrix comprising 34 outcomes was overly ambitious, it was 
reduced during the mid-term progress review to a more selective 24 linked to 13 country development 
objectives—an example of a lesson learned during implementation. 

38. 
According to the original CPS, implementation was to be guided by four principles of 
engagement.  These were: (a) frontloading of IDA resources to respond to the ongoing crisis; (b) flexibility 
in design to enable adaptation to changing circumstances; (c) selectivity in both lending and analytical and 
advisory services to conserve limited IDA resources and administrative budgets; and (d) leveraging to attract 
co-financing from development partners, including multi-donor trust funds for investment in global public 
goods. Based on the evidence available, all four principles were largely respected. For example, IDA 
resources were frontloaded during the first year of the period in response to the crisis. Second, the program 
was adjusted and extended mid-term, demonstrating the CPS’s flexible design and adaptation to changed 
circumstances. Third, selectivity in lending was evidenced by the portfolio consolidation (fewer operations of 
larger average size) and recourse to additional financing (seven operations) that occurred during the period. 
Finally, with one of the largest trust fund portfolios in ECA, leveraging to attract co-financing was evidently 
successful, as was Tajikistan’s selection by the Climate Investment Fund (CIF) for implementation of Pilot 
Programs for Climate Resistance (PPCR).  

CAS Design and Relevance 

39. 
Overall, the CPS’ design and content were highly relevant; in particular its linkage of rapid 
responses to short-term post-crisis needs to structural reforms required by long-term development 
strategy.  There was consistency between the NDS’ broad-based, long-term goals and CPS’ results 
framework, and planned outcomes were by and large realistic. Several were based on already agreed project-
specific development objectives that were clearly intended to facilitate achievement. Annex 1 summarizes 
CAS outcomes, the lending and other activities that contributed to or influenced them, and lessons learned 
and recommendations made by the country team. 

40. 
Design of new projects/programs.  New operations took into account lessons learned from 
preceding ICRs, especially institutional development experience. These included: that support for 
implementation of reforms is essential to success in low capacity environments; that a mix of policy-based 
budget support and implementation-focused investment operations raises the potential effectiveness of reform 
interventions; and that emergency recovery assistance projects can also be effective vehicles for helping 
governments to start preparing required medium-longer term measures.  Design improvements continue to be 
needed relating to institutional development. 

41. 
Relevance, quality, and dissemination of knowledge-based activities.  Given the satisfactory 
outcome of analytical and advisory services and technical assistance, knowledge-based activities were 
evidently highly relevant, of appropriate quality, timely, and driven by client demand.  Of particular note are 
the 2011 CEM and the joint WBG Khatlon: Reinvigorating Growth study, which guided Bank-IFC 
preparation of the new CPS FY15-18, and the Rural Investment Climate Assessment, that contributed to the 
Bank-IFC agribusiness strategy and Agriculture Commercialization Project (FY14). 

42. 
 Responsiveness to changing country circumstances, priorities and demands.  The WBG’s 
response to Tajikistan’s needs for emergency budget, energy, and humanitarian support in the wake of the 
2008-09 global economic crisis was extremely quick and very effective. This was facilitated by the 

54 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unexpected delay in presenting the CPS to Executive Directors (from October 2009 to May 2010), which 
enabled it to re-orient its program and mobilize incremental IDA and trust fund resources totaling US$68 
million. At the same time, it took the lead, together with the IMF, in assessing the country’s post-crisis 
external financing requirements.  The CPS’ one-year extension through FY14 demonstrated responsiveness to 
changing country circumstances and will allow the next CPS to be better aligned to the country’s planning 
cycle. 

43. 
Effectiveness of development partner assistance.  Given the limited IDA and other resources 
available, greater coherence and better coordination among development partners was a central focus of three 
meetings of the Tajikistan Development Forum held during the CPS period. The Development Coordination 
Council (DCC) in Dushanbe, currently chaired by the World Bank, plays a key role in fostering country 
ownership and mutual accountability through sector and thematic working groups, in line with the 2005 Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. This is especially important since coordination and management of 
external financing by and within the government remains fragmented and weak.  The CPS had been designed 
within the framework of a 3-year Joint Country Partnership Strategy (JCPS) involving 12 other development 
partners, it was decided, upon its expiry at the end of 2012, to move to series of multi-donor initiatives that 
support key objectives in the Government’s strategy, including four that are in the CPS (energy security, food 
security, improved social services, and private sector development).  These are being monitored through 
DCC-Government meetings that bring a multi-sectoral approach to government planning and greater policy 
coherence among development partners. 

44. 
Throughout the CPS, the WBG played a leading role in supporting other development partners’ 
strategies and programs with high quality analytical products and coordinating their contributions to various 
sector-specific reforms. For example, the recommendations of the 2011 CEM helped DfID, SECO, and the 
EU align their private sector development activities towards investment climate reforms. In addition, the 
WBG helped: (a) coordinate development partner inputs to the drafting of a new tax code; (b) establish a 
high-level public finance management steering committee to formulate a reform strategy and action plan 
(2009-18); (c) develop, together with USAID, mechanisms to issue new land certificates and creation of a 
modern land registration and cadaster system; and (d) together with the Open Society Institute, created a 
coalition of government and non-governmental agencies to support Tajikistan’s participation in the EITI 
validation process. Finally, IFC, partnering with other donors, including ADB and DFID, played an important 
role in helping draft and enact a public-private partnerships (PPP) law. 

45. 
Effectiveness of risk mitigation.  The CPS correctly identified four main risks to program 
implementation: macroeconomic—resulting from a slow global recovery especially in Russia; declining  
commitment to reform in the face of resistance from vested interests; weak institutional capacity; and 
geopolitical risks as a consequence of deteriorating security in Afghanistan and/or Pakistan. While none of 
these contingencies fully materialized, all four risk areas remained valid through the CPS period. Moreover, 
two additional macroeconomic concerns were added at mid-term: the quasi-fiscal risks posed by non-
performing loans exacerbated by government-directed lending; and risks to fiscal discipline and 
accountability resulting from weaknesses in the public finance management system. Non-performing loans 
due to directed lending in one of the largest banks led to a bail-out valued at 2 percent of GDP in 2012 and 
this risk remains. 

2. 

WBG Performance 

46. 
The Completion Report rates the WBG’s performance 
in terms of CPS program 
implementation overall as good.  Relatively strong performing areas were: macro-management, agriculture, 
energy (including the Rogun hydropower studies), education, and, to a lesser extent, financial and private 
sector development, and governance (including public administration and public finance management). 
Relatively weak performing areas were: health, water supply, and the financial management aspects of 
energy. The Bank responded to Government requests to provide additional financing in response to 

55 

 
 
 
 
 
 
emergency needs (e.g. retroactive financing in MIDP-AF to prevent damage from landslides) and to support 
key reforms (e.g. additional financing for land registration to support implementation of the Land Code and 
adoption of a Tax Administration project to support modernization in line with the new Tax Code). 
Implementation of the PDPG series was broadly satisfactory and underpinned steady but incremental 
progress on structural reforms. Development partner cooperation—exemplified by multi-donor initiatives 
undertaken by the WBG-chaired Development Coordination Council (DCC)—was also satisfactory.  
Following presidential elections, the 28 members of the DCC prepared a joint letter to the President, signed 
by the World Bank as Chair, on highest priority reforms for the new government, including ways the DCC 
can provide assistance.  As a result, the government will prepare a joint action plan with the DCC to intensify 
reforms in order to meet LSIS objectives by 2015.   

Country Development Outcomes 

V. 

Key Lessons Learned and Suggestions 

 First, Tajikistan’s post-independence civil war delayed the country’s economic and political 
transition and the development of modern public institutions by at least a decade.  Several first-
generation reforms remain incomplete. Without this foundation, particularly in land and water 
rights, public financial management, and the financial sector, future growth is likely to remain 
below potential.   

 Second, new thinking is needed on methods to expand the role of the private sector in the 
economy. Many important legal and regulatory reforms have been adopted, e.g. by reducing 
transaction costs on business and unbundling the aviation sector, but their impact has been slow 
to materialize in terms of new private investment, due to complex institutional issues or market 
dominance by related parties.  

 Third, sustainable improvement in basic public services requires executive leadership, 
dedicated civil servants, and involvement by civil society and citizens in implementation. 
Schools that benefited from per capita financing and the involvement of parent-teacher 
associations exemplify such alignment. Mechanisms to strengthen this vertical link from the 
executive branch down to local administrations and citizens should be identified.  

 Fourth, the poor quality of official data puts development outcomes at risk because policy and 
investment decisions are not based on solid evidence and analysis. Improved official statistics 
and their objective application are critical to wise policy decisions.  

Operational Lessons 

 First, the PDPG series supported a broad range of reforms and was successful in areas where 
there was consensus and on-going dialogue.  However, realism is required regarding what can 
be achieved in a relatively short period of time and the agenda should be more selective. 

 Second, although many institutional, legal, and regulatory reforms were enacted during the 
period, their implementation remained a challenge.  Weak institutional capacity and vested 
interests slowed the pace of change. Greater policy coherence on critical reforms is needed by 
development partners along with demand-driven mechanisms to garner citizen involvement.  

 Third, ensuring the availability of information on a regular basis is important for monitoring 
progress. Lists of indicators (including data required to monitor the adequacy of the macro-
framework) and the frequency of reporting should be agreed with the government during 
negotiations and have a solid evidence base.

Tajikistan―Development Partner Coordination 

Overview 

1. 
In 2012, according to OECD-DAC data, net overseas development assistance (ODA) to Tajikistan totaled 
about US$394 million, compared to US$348 million in 2011 and US$437 million in 2010. This apparent volatility 
most likely reflected the impact of the varied responses of development partners to the country’s emergency post-
crisis needs for budget support, humanitarian aid, and longer-term development financing. In both 2011 and 2012, 
the bilateral share of gross ODA averaged about 46 percent, or about one fifth higher than the 38 percent recorded 
in 2010. Net ODA as a share of GNI declined from 7.8 percent in 2010 to an average 5.6 percent in 2011-12. 
ADB, EU, IDA, IMF, and IsDB were the top five multilateral contributors during 2011-12 and Germany, Japan, 
Switzerland, and United States were the leading bilateral partners. Program assistance, together with education, 
health and other social sectors accounted for almost two thirds of bilateral aid during 2010-11. Besides Russia, 
other non-OECD countries such as China, India, and Iran have also become increasingly important sources of 
official aid and investment, in particular for infrastructure. 

Development Partner Coordination 

2. 
All the main bilateral aid agencies are represented in Dushanbe, as are the principal multilateral 
institutions―ADB, EBRD, EDB, EU, IMF, and the United Nations Specialized Agencies. A Development 
Coordination Council (DCC) was established in 2006 to enhance donor harmonization and alignment in the spirit 
of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the subsequent 2008 Accra Agenda and 2011 Busan 
Partnership. Comprising the heads of 28 international agencies active in Tajikistan, the DCC meets monthly to 
coordinate activities and policy dialogue with the Tajik authorities. Since early 2012, it has been chaired by the 
World Bank.  Attachment 1 describes development partner involvement by sector. 

3. 
During 2010-12, twelve development partners including IDA planned their activities within the 
framework of a Joint Country Partnership Strategy (JCPS)―an initiative designed to advance the goals of the 
2005 Paris Declaration. While a review undertaken in 2012 confirmed that JCPS achievements were 
significant―including a shared analysis of Tajikistan’s problems and prospects, a results matrix that helped align 
partners’ assistance with the country’s development strategy, and a consultative process that helped boost sectoral 
coordination―it was decided, upon its expiry at the end of 2012, to move to a looser, less binding, and more 
inclusive statement of Shared Principles for Cooperation. These reflect not only the intent of the original Paris 
Declaration, but also the four priorities agreed at Busan in 2011, namely: country ownership of development; 
focus on results; inclusive development partnerships; and transparency and mutual accountability. 

4. 
Meanwhile, the DCC and its secretariat play a key role in fostering country ownership and mutual 
accountability through several sector-specific and thematic working groups. These are important because the 
management of external financial and technical assistance by and within the government remains fragmented and 
weak, despite significant investments in capacity building in recent years. At the 2012 meeting of the Tajikistan 
Development Forum chaired by the President Rahmon, DCC partners re-affirmed their continued support for the 
country’s development and agreed on cross-sectoral, multi-partner coordinated initiatives designed to achieve 
measurable results by 2015. 22 These initiatives are aligned with the six government priorities reflected in 
Tajikistan’s medium-term Living Standards Improvement Strategy (LSIS): public administration and governance; 

22 These initiatives are summarized at Attachment 2.

Multilateral Development Partner Activities  

5. 
ADB is one of Tajikistan’s major development partners and all its assistance is from its concessional 
Asian Development Fund (ADF). As of 30 September 2013, ADB’s cumulative commitments totaled US$1,082 
billion, including US$373 million in 23 loans, US$663 million in 26 grants, and US$46 million in 74 technical 
assistance grants. About two-thirds of ADB’s portfolio comprises initiatives in energy (28 percent) and transport, 
with an emphasis on improving regional connectivity in line with Tajikistan’s active participant in the ADB-
sponsored Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. ADB also supports private sector 
development by facilitating reforms to help improve the business climate and increase the role of public-private 
partnerships in infrastructure development and public service delivery.  

6. 
EBRD has been active in Tajikistan since 1992 in technical cooperation and made its first investments in 
1996. As of January 2014, it had signed 80 projects with a net cumulative business volume of €287 million. Net 
cumulative disbursements totaled €127 million. The private sector share of the portfolio was 36 percent of the 
total. Infrastructure comprising environmental infrastructure and transport accounts for just over half the portfolio, 
the financial sector including investments in micro, small, and medium sized enterprises through financial 
intermediaries for about one quarter, with balance consisting of investments in agribusiness, commerce, energy 
and industry. EBRD’s current country strategy, approved in 2012, focuses on strengthening the financial sector, 
developing private enterprises and agribusinesses, supporting critical infrastructure, and improving energy supply, 
regulation and efficiency. 

7. 
European Union (EU) cooperation with Tajikistan, governed by a three-year (2011-13) national 
indicative program (following the mid-term review of its 2007-13 Central Asia Regional Strategy), concentrates 
on three focal sectors: social protection and employment; health sector reform; and private sector development, 
with public finance management reform as a cross-cutting theme. Financial and technical assistance support for 
2011-13 was expected to total €62.1 million, averaging €20.7 million annually, or about 29 percent of the €216 
million earmarked by the EU for five Central Asia national assistance programs during this three-year period.  

8. 
The United Nations (UN) has been active in Tajikistan since 1992 starting with the UN Tajikistan Office 
for Peace Building (UNTOP), which completed its mandate in 2007. Since 1993, the UN has increased its 
presence to 21 specialized agencies, programs, and funds, including the WBG. UN support to Tajikistan under the 
ongoing 2010-15 United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) comprises four pillars: poverty 
reduction and governance; food and nutrition security; clean water, sustainable environment, and energy; and 
quality basic services. The resources expected to be mobilized for this five-year program total about US$280 
million, averaging US$56 million annually of which 69 percent is allocated for quality basic services, 13 percent 
for food and nutrition security 

9. 
The International Money Fund (IMF) approved a three year US$102.3 million arrangement (90 percent 
of quota) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in April 2009, which was subsequently augmented to US$152 
million (120 percent of quota) in June 2010. The ECF supported the authorities’ efforts to maintain 
macroeconomic stability, promote inclusive growth, address weaknesses in the financial sector, bolster reserves, 
and catalyze critical donor support. The IMF, together with other development partners, is also providing 
technical assistance in the areas of public finance management, tax policy and administration, and financial sector 
issues.

Attachment 2 

Development Coordination Council (DCC) Initiatives 
in Support of Tajikistan’s Living Standards Improvement Strategy (LSIS), 2013-2015 

1. 
Public administration and governance:  The DCC’s two initiatives in this area are designed: (a) 
to strengthen parliament’s ability to fulfill its public expenditure oversight role and, in addition, to 
expedite implementation of ongoing public finance management reforms; and (b) to improve the access of 
marginalized or vulnerable groups to the country’s legal system. Together, they would help improve 
clarity, consistency, and transparency in Tajikistan’s public administration and the creation of an effective 
legal system. Results by end-2015 would include: integration of all public spending, including the quasi-
fiscal activities of state-owned enterprises, into the overall budgetary process; and fulfillment of the 
Chamber of Accounts’ ability to undertake regular audits and submit periodic reports to parliament.  

2. 
Private sector-led growth: The purpose of DCC initiatives under this heading is: (a) to 
support implementation of reforms focused on simplifying procedures for investors, strengthening 
investor protection, and improving public-private sector dialogue; (b) to help the government implement 
Tajikistan’s commitments to the World Trade Organization (WTO) following its accession last year; and 
(c) to help create conditions at national, regional, and local levels for inclusive rural growth through value 
chain support. Together, these actions would reinforce ongoing efforts to improve the business 
environment that are needed to enlarge the private sector’s contribution to growth, including much higher 
levels of domestic and foreign investment. Results by end-2015 would include: an increase in private 
investment—up from the currently low 5 percent of GDP; an increased number of jobs; and an improved 
institutional framework in WTO-related areas such as customs, trade facilitation, and support to 
agriculture including increased agricultural exports.  

3. 
Development of human potential: DCC 
initiatives directed 
towards further 
development of Tajikistan’s human capital would: (a) help increase the efficiency of public spending on 
health while improving the coverage and delivery of the ‘basic benefit’ package; and (b) support creation 
of a nation-wide communal services development fund linked to decentralized water supply services. 
These complementary actions would enhance the population’s access to primary health care services, as 
well as to safe drinking water (including in Dushanbe). Results by end-2015 would include: in health, 
nation-wide roll-out of the basic benefit package; in social protection, scaling up targeted social assistance 
and expansion of public-private partnerships for the delivery of social services; and, in education, 
expansion of early learning and inclusive education practices.    

4. 
Energy security: The DCC’s energy initiative comprises two elements designed to help 
reduce winter electricity shortages, export summer electricity surpluses, and address sector governance 
and management issues: first, by implementing four short- and medium-term actions that also advance 
long-term energy security; and second, by intensifying measures to rehabilitate existing hydropower 
assets, improve overall transmission and distribution system efficiency, and strengthen energy sector 
governance. Results by end-2015 would include: improved reliability of electricity supply, especially 
during winter; increased customer satisfaction with energy service provision; and enhanced financial 
management and transparency of energy enterprises.  

5. 
Food Security: DCC support for food security focuses on four areas: (a) increasing the 
output, processing, and export of agricultural produce; (b) promoting individual household production of 
agricultural products for domestic consumption in support of livelihood development, focusing especially 
on women; (c) scaling-up implementation of interventions to prevent and treat malnutrition, including 
Tajikistan’s participation in the UN Secretary-General’s “Scaling Up Nutrition” (SUN) initiative; and (d) 

70 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disseminating food security and nutrition information and market and farm price data. Results by end-
2015 would include: improved food availability and accessibility for all households; reduced malnutrition 
among children under five and nutrition-related illness in the population at large; and increased 
availability and use of food security and nutrition information for effective policy-making.  

6. 
Connectivity: The DCC’s transport connectivity initiative focuses on: (a) rehabilitating 
and upgrading the existing regional highway infrastructure; (b) maintaining and improving the national 
road network; (c) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework to maximize private sector 
involvement; (d) enhancing cross-border transport operations; and (e) expanding airline connectivity, 
especially to non-CIS international (cargo and passenger) markets. Together, these actions would help 
accelerate cross-border transport, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and facilitate regional and 
international trade.  Results by end-2015 would include: an increased number of road maintenance 
projects contracted out to the private sector; expanded trade with Afghanistan, China and the Kyrgyz 
Republic; a higher number international cargo and passenger flights through Dushanbe and Khujand, 
especially to and from non-CIS countries; and completion of the feasibility study for a railway project.

A. 

FY14 Country Opinion Survey23 

Background 

1. 

During January-February 2014, a country opinion survey was undertaken—the first since FY03. 
Its objectives were threefold: (a) to better understand how WBG stakeholders perceive its role and 
performance; (b) to obtain systematic feedback on a range of country-specific operational issues; and (c) 
to help inform the FY15-18 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). A total of 272 stakeholders, or 57 
percent of a sample of 475 that included national and local government officials at all levels, consultants 
and contractors working on WBG-supported projects and programs; and representatives of bilateral and 
multilateral development partners and a wide range of non-governmental, civil society organizations 
(CSOs), including the media, the private sector, and public policy research institutes, responded to the 
survey. The survey questionnaire—administered by courier, email, and regular mail—comprised over 100 
questions covering: general issues facing the country; overall attitudes towards the WBG; the WBG’s 
effectiveness and results, knowledge and research, and communications and information sharing; and 
perception about its future role in the country. 

Summary of Results 

2. 

Stakeholders identify quality public services (40 percent) and anti-corruption (36 percent) as the 
top development priorities for Tajikistan, followed by public sector governance, jobs, and economic 
growth. Anti-corruption, job creation (specifically for young people), education/training for better 
employment opportunities, and better entrepreneurial opportunities are seen as critical areas for reducing 
poverty and promoting “shared prosperity” in the country. Within this context, stakeholders believe the 
WBG should focus primarily on anti-corruption, quality public services, job creation/employment, and 
economic growth in Tajikistan. 

3. 

Overall, the WBG is viewed as a relevant, effective, and respectful development partner. 
Stakeholders’ views of how the WBG operates on the ground are very positive in terms of effective 
implementation support, use of country systems, lending and “safeguards” requirements. The WBG 
receives high ratings on collaboration with the government and other donors and being “a long term 
partner”.  Areas of concern (some of the survey’s lower ratings) relate to flexibility, responsiveness, and 
timeliness. 

4. 

While WBG’s effectiveness in its sectoral work is rated positively on a number of priority areas 
(economic growth – 6.7; poverty reduction – 6.7 on a 10 point scale), effectiveness ratings for other 
important sectors are 
lower 
(public sector governance – 5.4; anti-corruption – 5.9; 
job 
creation/employment – 5.9). 

5. 

A plurality of stakeholders (74 percent) consider the WBG’s financial services (i.e., investment 
lending) the greatest value that the institution brings to the country. Technical assistance and capacity 
development are also seen as important WBG instruments in reducing poverty. In terms of the WBG’s 
knowledge, overall views of its quality and applicability are quite positive; however, very few 
respondents reported that they use the WBG’s knowledge on a regular basis (11 percent use 
monthly/weekly).

Among WBG weaknesses in Tajikistan, respondents indicated lack of collaboration with non-
state actors and inadequate level of public disclosure of WBG work. A plurality of 41 percent believe that 
the WBG would bring greater value to the country by reaching out more to groups outside of the 
government 
(particularly, NGOs 
and 
private 
sector) 
and 
by 
providing more

Multi-stakeholder consultations 

7. 

Besides the client survey, consultations with civil society organizations (CSOs) in Dushanbe and 
with regional and local government and private sector representatives in Khatlon oblast were undertaken 
in August 2013. Their objective was to discuss early in the CPS preparation process the general direction 
of the WBG’s strategy going forward, as well as the specific activities planned during FY15-18. WBG 
staff met with about 200 representatives of CSOs, professional associations, the business community, as 
well as with other development donors active in the country. In addition, though not specifically linked to 
CPS preparation, the Country Office in Dushanbe consulted a sample of 700 young people in a “Voices of 
Youth” initiative, using a combination of debating tournaments and a survey to obtain their views on the 
most important social and economic issues facing Tajikistan. The results of these three consultation 
processes are summarized in the three attachments to this Annex. 

C. 

Conclusion 

8. 

These consultations were a vehicle for a meaningful exchange of views with the government and 
with other stakeholders on the critical development challenges facing the country as well as policy 
options and programs to address them. They also helped increase government and public understanding of 
the WBG’s work in Tajikistan. The CPS’ focus on private sector-led growth, social inclusion, and 
regional connectivity governance as well as its three cross-cutting themes—governance, gender, and 
climate—resonated with virtually all participants and attracted wide support among most groups.

Consultations with CSOs, Dushanbe 

A. 

Tajikistan’s Development Priorities, FY15-18 

 Unemployment and resultant labor migration are the two biggest problems needing 
immediate attention. Job creation in the regions and rural areas is especially important. Thus, 
more investments are needed in small business development, access to credit, skill training, 
improving the business environment, and ensuring more reliable electricity supply. 
 Fair and transparent implementation of land reforms is needed so that rich and poor equally 
can own land. Gender is important, as women are often excluded from decision making and 
land ownership. Special quotas are needed for women, and better access to low interest credit 
and training would be useful.  
 Education was highlighted as needing reform—at present it does not meet the needs of the 
labor market. Short-term courses, such as vocational training, are needed on skills that are in 
demand.  
 The public sector needs reform as there is a need for young qualified people to bring 
innovation and effectiveness. 
 Other sectors that need attention include: public health, where communities need more 
information on basic diseases, maternal and child health, and nutrition; energy, which is key 
for poverty alleviation, business development; and social assistance, especially in rural areas, 
where there is need for financial support of single mothers, the elderly, and people with 
disabilities. Youth, the largest demographic, need special attention in the new strategy.  

B. 

Priority areas for WBG involvement in Tajikistan 

 Job creation, including private sector development, energy, agriculture, education, and 
health 
 Reducing inequality—e.g. extending reforms, such as land use rights to the entire 
population; ensuring access to social services for people with disabilities; and expanding 
language training, thereby reducing the marginalization of certain ethnic groups. In addition, 
management of Tajikistan’s natural resources—water, silver, gold, etc.—needs to be more 
transparent, so that benefits are distributed equally among all citizens. 
 Education: the current system does not meet the demand of the labor market; there is need 
for vocational training/skills development. Secondly, this new generation, born during/after 
the civil war is largely illiterate, so at this stage we need some short term courses including 
on literacy to educate young people, girls. This will help those who do not go to school, or do 
not finish it, get some basic knowledge/literacy (“informal education”)   
Improvements in governance and ensuring equality in access to education and health 
services were noted as work in progress, and suggested as cross cutting issues.  
 The need for better relations with neighboring countries was listed by a few as a way to 
improve economic development.  “Politicians have to get over their personal ambitions as 
relations with neighbors are critical”, “Tajikistan is landlocked, and it needs to be a transit 
country.”  Sectors such as water, education and tourism were noted for regional cooperation.  
Collaboration among youth, CSOs – can be venues for promoting regional dialogue.

C. 

CSOs support for WBG activities 

 
Independent monitoring and evaluation of public services (this should include media);  
 Public awareness campaigns, i.e. getting information down to local communities;  
 
Informal education for youth, e.g. vocational training and other services;  
 Promoting new ideas and technologies to the government;  
 
In general, government needs to be more inclusive of CSOs across all sectors.  

D. 

CSO involvement in WBG-financed projects 

 Government is not inclusive of CSOs in decision making in the country in general. So when it 
comes to playing a role in WBG-financed projects, the same approach applies. Thus the 
general recommendation is for WBG to more actively advocate for inclusion of CSOs in 
development, including in specific projects.  
 Cooperation with Project Implementation Units (PIUs) is difficult, as the process for 
awarding grants or contracts is not transparent. Even if a CSO wins a grant from a PIU, it 
often becomes a problem, as many agencies, such as anticorruption, tax committee etc. come 
to the CSO to undertake multiple illegal checks and audits. 
 CSOs see a role in monitoring and evaluation of public services and other projects funded by 
the WBG.  
 CSOs would like to be part of the decision making while PIUs give out competitive grants to 
communities and companies as this will make the process transparent. 
 Many CSOs found E-consult handy and easy to use. Sometimes slow internet connection is 
an issue. CSOs would like to negotiate the percentages of funding received as tranches as part 
of contracts, prior to receiving a contract (CSOs do not have large budget reserves, so leaving 
the largest part of funding to the end is an issue).  
In general, CSOs would like more and regular training on e-consult and other WBG-specific 
systems and 
tools, 
including 
those relating 
to monitoring and evaluation, social 
accountability, and other areas. The WBG could also provide institutional capacity building 
for newly established CSOs.  

 

E. 

General recommendations: 

 The WBG needs to be more careful with data and statistics.  The government gives a lot of 
misleading data—the latest examples being poverty data and statistics relating to clean water 
coverage. The WBG is viewed as an objective and credible source of information, so it has to 
provide the public with true numbers and realistic statistics on the country’s development.  
 On the evaluation of the outcomes reached under CPS—CSOs should play a role.  While the 
government reports on improvements in certain sectors, CSOs also have to play a role by 
providing an independent assessment of public services improvement, for example. This will 
show real progress of the achievements reached under a certain CPS.

Consultations with regional and local governments and private sector, Khatlon 

1. 
On August 28, 2013, a joint WB/IFC team visited the city of Kulyab in Khatlon oblast to present 
its joint report entitled Reinvigorating Growth in the Khatlon Oblast. A second objective was to consult 
Khatlon regional authorities and the private sector about the new WBG’ Country Partnership Strategy for 
the period FY15-18. 

2. 
The meeting with the regional authorities included presentations by the governor of Khatlon on 
recent economic and social developments in Khatlon and by the mayor of Kulyab on achievements in the 
city. The mayor said that employment was the key overriding issue, given the large outflow of migrants to 
Russia. The only way to create jobs was through private sector development. While ongoing agricultural 
reforms were facilitating increased productivity, they had also posed a new problem—unemployment of 
women.  

3. 
During the subsequent roundtable discussion with over 30 private sector representatives, the 
following issues were raised as the main obstacles to private sector development in Kulyab and, more 
generally, in Khatlon:  

 Access to credit—commercial bank loans were too costly and their terms too short, making it 
difficult to use borrowed funds to expand businesses, especially in agriculture. 

 Connectivity—poor road connections were a serious problem, especially since there was no 
direct rail link from Kulyab to Dushanbe. Cargo could be transported by air, but this was very 
expensive: the most cost-effective means of transport for exports was by rail from Dushanbe. 

 Land. Access to land, both urban and rural, was also an important constraint to private sector 
development. 

 Storage. There were no large-scale cold storage facilities for fruits and vegetable. For 
example, because fruit could not be stored properly—1kilo of apples cost TJS 4 in the 
summer and TJS 40 in the winter—they went bad and had to be fed to cattle. 

 Leasing. Farmers needed to be able to lease agricultural equipment so as to facilitate 
production of large quantities. 

 Ago-processing. Producers did not know how to dry fruits and vegetables properly, which 
limited their ability to trade out-of-season. Local farmers needed training in agro- and food 
processing. 

 Energy. Owing to inadequate transmission lines, electricity was not available 24/7, thus 
limiting the ability of private businesses to expand.

Voices of Youth Initiative 

1. 
Tajikistan, where the population’s median age is 24.7 years, is one of the youngest countries in 
the world. It is also one of the fastest growing. For this reason, the WBG’s Country Office in Dushanbe 
consulted a sample of 700 young people in a “Voices of Youth” initiative, which used a combination of 
debate tournaments and a survey to obtain the their views on important social and economic issues. The 
initiative was implemented in partnership with several CSOs, debating societies, and universities in all 
regions of Tajikistan. 

YOUTH AS TAJIKISTAN’S MAIN RESOURCE  

2. 
Up to 40 percent of Tajikistan’s working-age population migrates abroad for employment, of 
which the vast majority are the age of 30. In 2012, remittances were equivalent to 49 percent of GDP. 
With fathers, uncles, and other family members seeking employment in other countries, jobs and 
education are among the most popular topics raised by youth.  
 
“Private sector needs to be developed to create more jobs,” said 17-year old Navruza, during 
a discussion in the remote mountainous city of Khorog in eastern Tajikistan. “Farmers need 
help to know how and where to sell their products. If jobs were available in all regions of the 
country, people would not have to leave their homes, their country.”   

3. 
Many young people doubt whether they will find jobs after they graduate because they are 
convinced that ‘. . there are simply no jobs available in Tajikistan.’ Many view migration as the only 
feasible option to make money and learn new skills, though most hope it is temporary and hope to be able 
to return to Tajikistan. Despite these economic and social challenges, in particular in rural Tajikistan, 
young people are optimistic about the future and their role in making the country a better place. The 
majority of the young people surveyed said that they viewed themselves as the main agents of future 
economic growth and shared prosperity in Tajikistan.     
 
“Of course, we will all come back and help our country solve its problems. If there were jobs, 
why go abroad? I belong to Tajikistan,” said Mukim, a student from northern Khujand. 

LITERACY AND ‘CONNECTIONS’ AS OBSTACLES 

4. 
Most of the young people surveyed said that inability to read was a potential threat to the 
country’s development. This was mentioned in the context of deteriorating quality of education in schools 
and universities and fewer girls attending school. They also cited corruption as well as connections— 
required to get a position in government or get anything done—as impediments to the country’s 
development.  
 “The main problem to enroll in the university is corruption— it negatively affects the 
assessment of your application for enrollment,” said one of the young people in an interview.  

5. 
During the final debate tournament in Dushanbe, young people agreed that the country needs an 
educated generation to succeed; however, many noted that the education system is not flexible enough to 
meet existing demands.   
 
“There should be a place, where I can get the skills I need and get them fast. I do not have 
time for a five year higher education degree. My family needs me to start bringing money 
home now, ” said Maruf, from eastern Garm, who just graduated from high school. 

6. 

Education for girls was also among the debated topics.  

77 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

“Tajikistan is experiencing a baby boom, thus educating girls should be the highest priority.  
As we know, an educated mother is an educated child,”—said Ruhafzo at the debate 
tournament in Isfara, a remote conservative northern district, with very few girls attending 
school after the 9th grade.  

DESPITE CHALLENGES, YOUTH MAKES IT WORK   

7. 
Payrav, a student who also leads a local youth organization in southern Kulyab town, says 
cooperation with the government is a challenge.  
 
“Anything outside the state-approved curriculum is viewed as efforts to impose foreign 
ideology on students. The World Bank and other donors need to help us make the Ministry of 
Education and other structures more open and inclusive of new ideas.”

Country Portfolio Performance Review—2013 

1. 
There follows below a brief summary of key findings that emerged from the most recent joint 
ADB/WBG country portfolio performance review (JCPPR) with the government held during July, 2013, 
which assessed the performance of the institutions’ respective portfolios during calendar 2012. 

Key findings: 

ANNEX 6 

 Both ADB and WBG portfolios had remained stable over the last five years and were fully 
consistent with Tajikistan's strategic priorities. More than 80 percent of their portfolios were 
concentrated in three key sectors: agriculture and natural resources, energy, and transport. 

 Overall portfolio quality was satisfactory, though there had been some increase in the number 
of projects experiencing implementation problems, including procurement. However, the 
time required to make projects effective had decreased and disbursement indicators had 
improved. 

 The government had made progress in resolving several generic issues: for example, the new 
tax code had streamlined taxation requirements and project implementation capacity in 
government agencies had improved. On the other hand, many agencies still lacked skills in 
procurement, financial management, and disbursement, with government procurement 
procedures remaining opaque, causing delays and hampering project implementation. 

 

JCCPRs had become an important instrument for monitoring sector-specific results. 
However, inadequate technical capacity and inconsistent statistics continued to constrain 
analysis of development results. Specific issues included: no baseline indicators; lack of 
quality data to monitor project implementation; and inadequate skills to evaluate project 
impact and outcomes in the context of the overall sector and cross-sector reform agenda. In 
addition, the institutional framework in some agencies was not well aligned with sector 
objectives. 

Conclusions and recommendations:  

 Overall, the quality of the two portfolios was assessed as satisfactory. However, despite 
generally favorable procurement and disbursement performance in 2012, there remained 
several issues requiring close attention and/or decisive action by the government. 

 A new time-bound action plan was agreed with the government to address issues related to: 
(a) strengthening government agencies’ capacity for monitoring and evaluation; (b) reviewing 
procurement guidelines for public investment projects; and (c) aligning institutional 
frameworks with sector-specific agendas and objectives.  

Sector Portfolio Results Monitoring:  

 The JCPPR commended the government's efforts to expand assessment of portfolio impact to 
the energy sector and emphasized the need for: (a) regular updating of the joint portfolios’ 
impact in roads, energy, and health, and (b) expanding result-based assessment of portfolio 
impact to the other sectors. It was proposed that agriculture and natural resource would the 
focus of discussion of development results at the next JCPPR in 2014. 

79 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Portfolio Performance Monitoring  

 Following the July 2013 JCPPR, the government, represented by the State Investment 
Committee, and the WBG agreed that more frequent portfolio performance monitoring 
should take place focused on specific projects and/or portfolio themes. The agenda would be 
developed jointly and be expected to review achievements, lessons learned, and problem 
projects.  Action plans would be developed and monitored at subsequent meetings. These 
portfolio performance monitoring meetings would be held quarterly. 

 

In September 2013, the first quarterly review brought together ministerial representatives, 
project implementation units, and WBG staff to review three projects with moderately 
unsatisfactory or unsatisfactory ratings. The result was adoption of action plans for each 
project. All three have subsequently been upgraded or are on track for upgrading following 
restructuring. 

 The next quarterly review is planned for end-May 2014 (an earlier date was not possible due 
to the presidential election in November 2013 and the appointment of a new government in 
January-February 2014).  It will review the status of action plans to reduce the currently four 
actual and two potential problem projects. On the positive side, there is high proactivity with 
three restructurings underway, and one problem project should improve following declaration 
of effectiveness and initial procurement.  The meeting will also discuss mechanisms for early 
identification of problem projects so that action to mitigate risks can be initiated at an early 
stage.

Gender and Women’s Empowerment24 

ANNEX 7 

Background 

1. 
Despite being the poorest country in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), Tajikistan’s human 
development indicators were relatively positive at independence in 1991. Gender disparities in education, 
literacy, and life expectancy were small, thanks to the comprehensive services available under the Soviet 
social welfare system; and quotas for women ensured that they held positions in national and regional 
governments. However, independence and the ensuing five year-long civil war caused huge economic 
shocks and physical devastation resulting in the loss of social services and other disruptions that had 
different gender impacts.  

Recent Trends  

2. 
While burgeoning remittances from migrant labor have helped reduce poverty over the past 
decade, migration has had other negative consequences. It has ‘feminized’ agricultural production, with 
women providing agricultural labor but lacking the education and access to financial and other resources 
needed to transform the agricultural economy. The absence of men in many households and communities 
has meant that women have taken on new responsibilities, but their progress has been constrained by 
cultural stereotypes that still limit women’s opportunities, often confining them to their maternal role. 
Women’s workload has increased because of the need to contribute to their family’s income, to 
supplement family food from a garden plot, and to care for children and the elderly while health and other 
social services deteriorated. Even as poverty rates have declined, social indicators for women have 
continued to deteriorate. In short, women in Tajikistan have arguably borne the brunt of the impact of the 
ongoing transition. 

3. 
Thus, Tajikistan ranks the lowest in ECA on gender, where disparities especially in access to 
education remain significant contributors to poverty. The key issues include: (a) bias in favor of boys 
throughout the education system, but especially at university level; (b) gender-based sector and 
occupational segregation and, as a result, widening earnings gaps; and (c) weak implementation of gender 
policies. 

Education 

4. 
Tajikistan has the largest gender gap in educational attainment in Central Asia and it appears to 
be growing. While there was virtually universal enrollment and near gender parity at the primary level in 
2011, only 82 percent of girls attended secondary school compared to 94 percent of boys. Tertiary 
enrollments were 31 percent for boys but less than half that, or only16 percent for girls. In addition, 
areas of study are severely gender-segregated, with most girls remaining in fields commonly associated 
with women’s traditional roles, such as education, health, and social services, with only a few entering 
into scientific or technical faculties.  

5. 
Low educational levels are also associated with early marriage. According to several surveys, 12 
percent of girls between 15 and 19 years of age are already married, divorced, or widowed, despite a 
legal minimum age for marriage of 17; and 15 percent are married by age 18. There are few jobs for 
girls who continue their education. Moreover, there is a cost to the family to keep them in school. 
Perceiving no economic benefit, families take girls out of school and encourage them to marry early. 
Once married, women begin to have children. Opportunities to get additional schooling are then 
extremely limited. Against this background, women and children belong to the poorest groups. Women

also face difficulties in exercising their rights to use natural resources, including land; and legislation in 
general tends not to be gender-sensitive. Domestic violence is reportedly prevalent in many households 
and there is a widespread ignorance about gender equality and options for assistance in times of need.   

Employment 

6. 
Related both to the impact of labor migration and social attitudes, there is serious gender-
segmentation in the labor force, with women working in the lower-paid sectors of agriculture, education, 
and health care. Young women comprise only 7 percent of students studying agriculture. The lack of 
women studying in agriculture, as well as in other technical fields, reverberates throughout the economy. 
With so many men migrating abroad to look for work, including those with technical skills, these gender-
based occupational choices translate into a lack of human capital in some of the most important areas of 
the economy, such as agriculture and agribusiness. There is also a significant wage gap: women’s average 
monthly earnings are barely half those of men and women are six times less likely to be employed than 
men. 

7. 
Although women’s involvement in agriculture is extensive, they participate largely as workers 
rather than as managers. Despite land reforms and new rules governing the formation of individual or 
family (dehkan) farms, women remain only a small minority of dehkan farm owners and managers. Many 
have not understood these reforms and are unaware of their rights. Due to their lack of agricultural and 
business skills, they are not well-prepared to contribute to the ongoing commercialization of agriculture. 

8. 
Finally, there are many gender-related consequences of labor migration. Women whose husbands 
migrate are often left without adequate resources to maintain their families. They may live with their in-
laws and work for them because it is less expensive than maintaining their own homes. Remittances are 
generally controlled by migrants’ parents, not their wives. Second and third wives who did not marry 
legally face particularly tenuous situations and can be forced out of the home by their in-laws and have no 
legal recourse to property. 

Supporting social inclusion, gender and governance – on all fronts 

     The PPCR and GEF-financed Environmental Land Management and Rural Livelihoods Project aims to support rural 
people in increasing their productive assets, while reducing their vulnerability to climate change. The project is supporting 
sustainable village-based rural production and land resource management in ways that are transparent, equitable, and 
inclusive.  For example, at least half of all households in participating villages will receive grant support to adopt climate 
change adaptation and sustainable land management practices, with community members themselves determining the 
households to receive investment support based on the community's climate and environmental risks.  Given that women 
carry out most of the agricultural labor in the country, but relatively few have meaningful decision-making power, the 
project seeks to address gender and social inclusion issues through its use of participatory processes.  Community 
mobilization and training activities will use mechanisms that help ensure women's participation (e.g., women only sessions) 
and at least 40 percent of project beneficiaries are expected to be women.   Lastly, the project will support the scale up of 
climate change adaptation and sustainable land management practices, by ensuring that results and lessons learned are 
disseminated to national and regional stakeholders, projects and programs, in an effort to incorporate lessons into national 
strategies and policies, and support wider replicability of these practices. 

Gender Policy   

9. 
Tajikistan’s constitution provides for gender equality, but implementation and enforcement are 
weak. In practice, the approach used is to seek to improve women’s status rather than address gender 
inequalities. Moreover, the constitution does not define discrimination and it is therefore difficult to 
challenge inequitable working conditions in court. The cabinet-level Committee on Women and Family 
Affairs, created in 2001, is responsible for managing the state program on gender. It is led by a board 
which is usually chaired by a Deputy Prime Minister. 

82 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. 
Several development partners support efforts to develop and advocate for gender-sensitive 
policies. A group chaired by UNDP and UNIFEM meets regularly and reviews gender issues. Switzerland 
and the Soros Foundation and Open Society Institute are actively involved in addressing gender 
disparities in education and the consequences of gender-based violence.

Governance in Tajikistan 

ANNEX 8 

1. 
Governance challenges in Tajikistan are systemic and wide ranging, and have resulted in a 
number of negative externalities, including weak transparency and accountability, inefficiencies in public 
spending, corruption and state capture, and informality in the private sector.  

2. 
WBG programming in Tajikistan can contribute positively to improvements by continuing to 
emphasize the central question of governance in investment decisions and by setting a standard for 
governance in Bank and IFC operations.  

3. 
The Country Partnership Strategy for Tajikistan for 2015-2018 intends to promote improved 
governance through a number of programs and projects that focus on increasing transparency and 
accountability, strengthened oversight for financial risk from public sector entities, improvements in 
national procurement capacity and systems, continuing to foster demand for good governance from civil 
society, and improving access and quality of data for evidence-based policymaking, monitoring and 
evaluation.  

4. 
This annex summarizes the key achievements in governance under the previous CPS and outlines 
the governance goals, mechanisms, and expected outcomes going forward over the following CPS period. 

5. 
The previous CPS (FY10-14) included a country governance and anti-corruption (CGAC) 
strategy that was designed to mainstream governance in the Tajikistan portfolio focusing on increasing 
transparency and accountability, building capacity, and fostering demand for good governance. The 
CGAC was implemented through the Governance Partnership Facility–financed governance program, a 
BETF of US$3.8M for three years with the goals: firstly to reshape how the Bank does business in 
Tajikistan with regard to governance through governance-informed project design, and second to assist 
counterparts within the executive and legislative branches of the Tajik government, as well as non-
government organizations in the key areas of the CGAC strategy. Towards the first goal, the principal 
innovation was the design and application of the Governance Checklist – a project-level tool applied to all 
new lending operations to ensure that governance challenges and risks were appropriately reflected. The 
second goal was met through testing an innovative approach to institutional capacity building in the Civil 
Service Agency, and increasing capacity, transparency and accountability in the Parliament by 
establishing a secretariat to the Budget Committee of the Tajik Parliament, which enhanced analytical 
capacity of the Budget Committee and increased transparency through regular reporting and monitoring 
of the budget.  

The new CPS priorities for improving governance are as follows: 

6. 
In the area of economic governance, the focus is on the use of electronic mechanisms which will 
be utilized for a wide range of business regulatory procedures from registering a business, to paying taxes, 
to applying for permits leading to reduced opportunities for informal payments. Additional efforts will 
focus on fair access to land use rights, improved feedback mechanisms for the private sector to report 
governance abuses, and an ongoing governance dialogue through existing public-private dialogue forums. 

7. 
In the public sector and PFM reform, the work on budget transparency and accountability of 
the budget process will continue through the PFM investment project (APL2). The reform objective of the 
APL1 is to establish basic processes for the efficient and transparent management of public expenditures 
through implementing an automated fiscal management information system (FMIS). The first phase - 
APL-1 helped to create preconditions for implementation of the FMIS and has supported reforms to the 
institutional structure of the Ministry of Finance and reengineering business processes.  The objective of 

84 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the APL-2 is to move from preconditions to tangible outcomes in having most government expenditures 
being budgeted through a strategic process linked to Government sectoral goals.  Financial reporting will 
be in accordance with TPSAS (based on IPSAS) and annual TPSAS compliant financial statements will 
be produced and subject to independent audit for the whole of government and major government entities 
(other than SOEs which will report according to IFRS). This transformation will result in significantly 
increased transparency, parliamentary participation in the budget process and an improvement in the 
Transparency International Corruption Perception Index ranking. In order to sustain advanced PFM 
reforms outcomes, APL2 will appraise and select a relevant component for government wide institutional 
and civil service reforms.  

8. 
Under the improved transparency and accountability in public procurement process, the 
implementation of a functioning Public Procurement Portal and complaint handling system will be 
continued. The work program for the new CPS includes ongoing and future trust funds such as the ECA 
PFM Trust Fund on Public Procurement Capacity Building, an IDF grant to improve public procurement 
portal and e-procurement, and technical assistance to improve the complaint handing system. These 
efforts will continue to increase capacity of the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) to manage 
procurement, monitor and report on public contracts, and handle grievances. 

9. 
Under improved corporate and banking sector governance, the work will continue to apply 
sound principles of corporate governance and use of international reporting standards especially in the 
energy sector. The Bank’s interventions will help the Government implement its Financial Recovery Plan 
for Barki Tajik. In the banking sector, WBG is planning to employ a transformative approach to improve 
governance. The activities range from proper resolution in systemic bank (AIB) ownership and 
management, building capacity, and providing TA to improve banking supervision, regulation and 
lending policy.  The World Bank and IFC stand ready to help in this transformation of AIB. Placing AIB 
under foreign management and ownership would protect the value of the bank, significantly improve its 
governance, and ensure the provision of credit and other financial services to SMEs and farmers 
throughout the country. The adequate resolution of the bank's situation has a potential to provide a 
“demonstration effect” to other banks. 

10. 
 Under promoting accountability through improving quality of data for evidence-based 
decision-making we will address the critical impediment of limited availability and poor quality of 
national level statistical data on poverty, economic development, labor force, and service delivery. 
Tajikistan faces gaps in statistical capacity of the National Statistics Agency (TajStat) which limits data 
collection, analysis, and dissemination. As an example, the national poverty rate has not been published 
since 2009. The Bank will support development of statistical capacity in order to improve the quality and 
public access to statistical data, particularly poverty and economic data for use by the government, 
development partners, academia and other relevant stakeholders. The target of the CPS is to build the 
capacity of the national statistical system to publish poverty and unemployment data on a quarterly basis 
by 2016.   

11. 
In the area of increasing the capacity of CSOs to demand good governance the efforts will 
continue to build capacity for budget data analysis, M&E, project and financial management, and social 
accountability. Well-trained CSO organizations can provide both the government and the Bank with 
valuable information on quality of public service delivery and identify gaps in service access and quality 
across the country. The Bank has used CSOs to monitor and evaluate its own projects to serve as a 
demonstration effect for government, and will continue to engage CSOs in implementation and 
monitoring of its projects, with the aim of including CSOs in the implementation and/or monitoring of all 
Bank projects by 2018. Applying innovations such as the Governance Checklist, the Capacity Building 
Strategy, and seizing opportunities to enhance governance specifically in sectors, the Bank can achieve 
greater progress under this CPS period within the complex reform environment.

Climate Change in Tajikistan 

ANNEX 9 

1. 
Tajikistan is ranked the country in Europe and Central Asia most vulnerable to the projected 
impacts of climate change, owing to: (a) its natural resource base (e.g. its large rural, and poor, 
population, the fact that agriculture accounts for two-thirds of employment, and its extreme reliance on 
hydropower); (b) inadequacies in the climate resilience of key sectors of the economy (exemplified by  
droughts and weather extremes that caused damage estimated at 1.3 percent of GDP over 2000-07); and 
(c) its low adaptive capacity to ongoing and future changes, including limited institutional capacity to 
mainstream climate change adaptation in development plans, programs, and policies. 

2. 
  Climate change in Tajikistan is mostly about managing the country’s huge water resources, in 
particular growing risks for water availability for agriculture. Ecosystems, hydropower generation, and 
human consumption, as well as the increasing risk of extreme events, such as glacier lake outbursts, 
floods, mudflows, and droughts.  These anticipated impacts put at risk ten years of progress in poverty 
reduction and shared prosperity and threaten the achievement of the country’s development priorities 
(food and energy security in particular). For instance, climate change-related shocks to agricultural 
systems can result in dramatic development and poverty impacts: a 20 percent drop in yields triggered by 
a drought would push the poverty rate up by an estimated 13 percentage points. 

3. 
There are signs that the climate is already changing: since 1940, mean annual ground 
temperatures have increased by 0.5° cover most of the territory and 1°C in the south; glaciers, the most 
vulnerable ecosystems, have lost about 10 percent of their mass during the last 50 years, and smaller ones 
have already disappeared; and other extremes are increasing, such as the number of days with 
temperatures exceeding 40°C nearly doubling since 1940 and more frequent and intense rainfall.  These 
trends are expected to accelerate going forward and climate change is likely to result in increased 
temperatures (0.1-0.2°C per decade), more variable rainfall and snow cover (including more extreme 
events), and a further 15-20 percent shrinking in  glaciered areas. 

4. 
  The main implications of these anticipated changes include: (a) a gradual shift in the seasonality 
of river runoff one to two months forward in the year (e.g., before peak vegetation demand), given earlier 
and greater melting in the cryosphere, as well as an increase in rainfall and decrease in snowfall; (b) a 
gradual increase in annual average river runoff in the short term, due to greater melting in the cryosphere 
followed by a decrease towards the end of the century in the average annual flow in select, un-managed 
sub-basins as smaller glaciers start to disappear; (c) greater variability in annual river flows toward the 
end of the century, due to the increasing contribution from rainfall runoff and the decreasing contribution 
in some sub-basins from snow and ice melt; (d) higher annual evapo-transpiration, leading to higher 
demand for water, and possible seasonal water shortages with implications for agriculture, human 
settlements and ecosystems; and (e) a continued rise in weather-related hazards such as glacier lake 
outbursts, more frequent mudflows caused by intense rainfall and snowmelt during spring, extreme floods 
of melt water during spells of hot weather, and droughts due to low precipitation or low river flows. 

5. 
Participating in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) constitutes a chief component 
of Tajikistan’s response to the related challenges of climate change and development.  PPCR support 
focuses on investments: (a) to strengthen institutional capacities for effectively integrating climate 
resilience into national development and investment planning; (b) to improve the accuracy and timeliness 
of hydro-meteorological services for early warning, weather forecasting, and climate change assessments; 
(c) to make key water management and hydropower infrastructure more climate resilient; and (d) to 
support land management measures to enhance rural livelihoods through greater resilience to climate-
related shocks. 

86 

 
 
 
 
 
6. 
  The WBG, one of the PPCR’s implementing agencies together with ADB and EBRD, is already 
helping Tajikistan address climate change through support for climate resilience directly—e.g. the two 
PPCR-related Bank operations—or for the non-climate drivers of vulnerability, such as unsustainable 
water resources management, land degradation, energy, transport, and urban infrastructure, and disaster-
risk management.  Through ongoing and planned operations, WBG support across the CPS’ three pillars 
offers opportunities to address climate change vulnerabilities: 

 Private sector-led growth—reducing commercial and technical losses in energy and water as 
well as increasing access to, and productivity of, land to build greater resilience in rural 
communities; 

 Social inclusion—making clean water supply and sanitation climate-smart and piloting 
approaches to integrate the social dimensions of climate change into community-based 
responses; and 

 Regional connectivity—improving transport infrastructure, promoting regional power trade, 
and developing a regional program for climate resilience, unifying the five Central Asian 
countries. 

7. 
Beyond the current parameters of WBG engagement, several actions on the policy and 
institutional front could be considered and be part of a development policy (DPO) program.  They 
include: 

 Reforming the pricing of irrigation water 
 
Introducing norms for water efficient appliances 
 Exploring the feasibility of risk coping mechanisms, from community funds to insurance 
schemes 
 Reforming electricity tariffs (as populations are willing to pay more for better service) and 
better recovery (e.g., arrears with irrigation pumps)  
 Expanding the PPCR Secretariat’s mandate to coordinate and implement climate change 
projects

Country Policy and Institutional Assessment—selected indicators   

i. Tajikistan’s overall CPIA score improved from 3.2 to 3.4 during 2008-12. Its overall score compares 
favorably to the IDA average (3.3 FY2012), but lags behind the Kyrgyz Republic and Moldova (3.6 and 
3.8 respectively). The most progress was achieved in the macroeconomic and public sector management 
clusters A and D.  Progress on structural policies, however, was almost negligible, judging by the average 
score for cluster B, although this masks an improvement in the business regulatory environment (from 3.0 
in 2008 to 3.5 in 2012) and deterioration in the financial sector (from 2.5 in 2008 to 2.0 in 2012).  There 
has been some progress in the equity of public resource use and building human resources, which resulted 
in moderate improvement in the scores for cluster C.
