EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Economic and Social Developments 

1. 
After the 2002 crisis, Argentina’s growth rebounded, achieving one of the highest 
growth rates in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region. Argentina’s post-crisis 
GDP growth rates averaged 6 percent annually from 2003 to 2013, exceeded in LAC only by 
Panama and Peru. It was well above the 1.6 percent average annual growth rate Argentina 
achieved during 1980-2000. Especially in the period till the global financial crisis, Argentina’s 
exports grew as a consequence of increased competitiveness from currency depreciation, 
economic growth in main trading partners, and high international commodity prices. Domestic 
demand was supported primarily by internal consumption and private investment. Until 2010, 
export growth and improved tax revenue led to fiscal and external surpluses, allowing Argentina 
to accumulate international reserves, reduce debt, and build fiscal space as buffers against 
shocks. Following the global financial turmoil of 2008, Argentina’s economy slowed, with 
growth averaging 4.3 percent from 2009 to 2013 and with further weakening expected in 2014.  

2. 
Economic growth during 2003-2013 was inclusive, making Argentina one of the top 
two LAC performers in terms of poverty reduction and improvements in shared 
prosperity. The 2002 crisis was impoverishing. Since then, Argentina has recovered lost ground 
and expanded the size of the middle class. Along with proactive social protection policies, 
economic growth enabled the country to reduce poverty and unemployment. Poverty measured at 
$4-a-day 1 declined from 31 percent in 2004 to 10.8 percent in 2013. 2 Inequality was reduced, 3 
and the middle class grew from 34 percent of the population to 53 percent between 2000 and 
2011. Gains in poverty reduction over the past decade have been driven largely by improved 
labor market outcomes as both earning increases and new job creation benefited lower-skilled 
groups. More than two-thirds of poverty reduction derived from improved job opportunities and 
earnings. 

3. 
Strong economic growth was accompanied by rising macro-imbalances and policy 
uncertainty, creating challenges to the sustainability of the macroeconomic policy 
framework. Such imbalances include a sustained inflation pressure which the Government, 
among other measures, has sought to contain through prices freezes for specific products. Fiscal 
accounts deteriorated as a result of the rapid rise of subsidies and social expenditures, while the 
current account weakened as a consequence of currency appreciation and 
loss of 
competitiveness. International reserves declined by about $22 billion during 2010-2013. The 
imbalances, together with a number of sectoral policies, have led to a deteriorating business 
environment, particularly in the energy sector. A change of statistical methodology for the 
consumer price index in 2007 raised questions about official inflation figures, eventually leading 
to an IMF censure and a call for Argentina to improve the quality of its inflation and GDP 
statistics. Argentina continued to face challenges from the debt in default since 2001 with

holdouts that had not participated in the 2005 and 2010 debt exchanges. Argentina also had a 
debt in default with Paris Club creditors until a May 2014 agreement on a new payment 
schedule. In addition, the nationalization of the private pension funds (in 2008), the Argentine 
Airlines (in 2008), and the oil company YPF (in 2012) increased uncertainty about the regulatory 
environment and property rights. Faced with pressure on its foreign reserves, the Government 
increasingly used restrictive trade and exchange rate policies to curb the demand for foreign 
exchange. These imbalances have become more binding as growth weakened.  

4. 
Recently, Argentina has begun to address several of these imbalances and has 
worked to resolve a number of international disputes. In early 2014, Argentina allowed its 
currency to depreciate and tightened its monetary policy to alleviate pressures on the exchange 
rate and international reserves. The Government reduced subsidies on gas and water 
consumption by an average of 20 percent in March 2014. Argentina also reached settlements on 
investment and property disputes. It agreed with Repsol over the nationalized assets of YPF, and 
paid its outstanding debt to companies that had won cases against the country in the International 
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). On May 29, 2014, an agreement was 
reached with Paris Club creditor countries to clear debt in arrears, with a repayment plan worth 
$9.7 billion over five years. Argentina made the first payment to the Paris Club in July 2014 (see 
Box 6). On June 6, 2014, the IMF Executive Board reviewed Argentina’s progress on improving 
the quality of its official statistics, noting the successful completion of an initial set of specific 
actions which had been agreed upon. 

5. 
Today, more than 
40 
percent 
of 
the 
Argentine 
population 
remains at risk of falling 
into 
poverty. 4 
Three 
challenges stand out for the 
poor 
and 
vulnerable 
population:  
• 
First, 
the greatest 
vulnerability 
to poverty 
arises 
in 
periods 
of 
economic 
crises 
or 
prolonged sluggish growth, 
which reduce employment 
and earnings and limit the 
ability of the government to 
finance 
social programs 
that directly support

4 Those considered “vulnerable” to falling into poverty in the event of an adverse shock constitute those living on $4 
to-$10 per day; in 2012 that figure was 33 percent of Argentina’s populace, with another almost 10.9 percent already 
living in poverty; hence the “more than 40 percent” above. The vulnerability measure is uni-dimensional and does 
not include non-monetary poverty indicators.

poor (see Figure 1). Argentina has developed a comprehensive social protection system with 
high coverage rates, which also helped mitigate the impact of the 2009 global crisis during which 
poverty and inequality continued to decline. Nonetheless, because of the importance of labor 
income in poverty reduction, a weakened business climate and labor market can have significant 
adverse effects on poverty rates. Strengthening macroeconomic resilience, improving the 
business environment, and boosting investor confidence will be critical to fostering investment 
and expanding and sustaining the employment thereby generated.  
• 
Second, although Argentina is a broadly inclusive society, endowments and opportunities 
continue to vary for different groups in society and across regions. Poverty risks are highest  
among those with limited access to, and command of, human and basic infrastructure assets. The 
less well developed and integrated Northern provinces, for example, have poverty rates two to 
three times higher than the national average, and lag behind the rest of the country in social 
services and basic infrastructure.  
• 
Third, Argentina’s economy depends on natural capital; and environmental degradation 
represents a significant cost to the economy, threatening livelihoods. Preserving natural capital 
and addressing environmental degradation are critical to sustainability and equity, particularly 
for the poorer and more vulnerable populace that depends heavily on these resources.  

The Argentina Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), FY15-18 

Figure 2. Argentina CPS - Mapping of the WBG Result Areas 

6. 
The CPS for FY15-
18 
is 
selectively built 
around nine World Bank 
Group 
(WBG) 
result 
areas, set within 
three 
broader 
themes: 
(a) 
Employment Creation in 
Firms and Farms; 
(b) 
Availability of Assets for 
People and Households; 
and 
(c) 
Reducing 
Environmental Risks and 
Safeguarding 
Natural 
Resources (see Figure 2). 
The 
results 
areas were 
selected because they are 
important 
to 
achieving 
sustained poverty reduction 
and sharing of the gains of wealth creation—the twin goals of the WBG; they reflect WBG 
expertise and lessons from past performance; they respond to expressed demand from our 
counterparts at the federal, provincial, and firm levels; and they are related to sectors and areas in 
which investments are meeting a favorable policy environment for sustained impact.  

7. 
The CPS details a select number of outcomes to be supported by financial, 
knowledge, and advisory services from across the WBG. With respect to these specific 
outcomes – closely linked to the overarching goal of supporting sustained poverty reduction and 

v 

 
 
 
 
 
shared prosperity in Argentina – the WBG has a proven track record as well as knowledge base 
to engage. During the CPS period, the Bank and IFC will make a joint effort to help the 
government in achieving specified outcomes in the urban development and agribusiness areas 
which are core areas of focus for this CPS. In urban development, this includes reducing average 
transit times to city centers from poor neighborhoods in two metropolitan areas by 15 percent. 
Several ongoing and new provincial financing engagements as well as a program of analytical 
and monitoring work is planned to lead to such an outcome. IFC will intervene with investments 
in target areas based on the Bank’s analytical work and will draw upon its successful experience 
in the urban space in Colombia. Additionally, the Bank and IFC will explore synergies to 
increase by 12 percent the gross value of agricultural production ($/ha) of 80,000 small and 
medium-size farms in lower-income areas. Here, IFC will complement the Bank’s knowledge 
and financial services with investments in farms and SMEs. Further, the WBG aims to support 
an increase in effective national healthcare coverage from 28 percent to 50 percent (through a 
roll-out mechanism focusing first on uncovered and low-income households) by using several 
results-based financing arrangements as well a program of impact evaluations. Other such results 
include reaching 2.3 million households with flood protection; and reducing the annual 
deforestation rate of natural forests in critical areas of Chaco, Salta, and Santiago de Estero, from 
0.56 percent to 0.28 percent. 

8. 
This CPS makes a number of gradual shifts as to where and how the WBG will 
engage. These include (a) phasing out WBG support for road maintenance management and 
direct income support for the poor, which were areas of substantial engagement over the past 
decade and are now well established within the Government’s own programs; (b) scaling-up 
support to enhance the employability of young people as well as support by the IFC to the 
private sector; (c) using a more comprehensive development approach with respect to 
urbanization, environmental management, and public sector management; (d) considerably 
increasing financial services that are results and output-driven; (e) implementing advisory and 
knowledge services bundled into programmatic and multi-year engagements; (f) setting goals for 
expanding the portfolio of impact evaluations; and (g) an increased share of WBG financing 
directed to low-income geographic areas. In addition, the strategy outlines a cross-portfolio 
approach to governance with specific measures to be achieved over the CPS period, including 
the complete move to the Open Procurement System for all IBRD engagements/activities. 

9. 
The proposed CPS will span four years; in 2016 a mid-term Performance and 
Learning Review will focus on the validity of the strategy and spell out any proposed 
adjustments. The CPS builds on lessons learned and outlines a new program that further 
expands the scope of collaboration among WBG organizations and with other key development 
partners (e.g., Inter-American Development Bank, Development Bank of Latin America) for 
each of the relevant strategic results areas and associated CPS results. The FY15-18 CPS 
envisages $1.0 to $1.2 billion of new IBRD investment financing per fiscal year, while IFC 
would expect to commit about a total of $1.7 billion to support Argentine’s private sector under a 
stable market environment. MIGA will be considering requests for coverage for investments on a 
case-by-case basis. 

vi 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. 
The outcomes targeted by this CPS are subject to various economic and political 
risks as well as risks related to program implementation.  

• 

• At the macroeconomic level, the ongoing dispute with several holdout creditors poses 
significant risks. On July 30, 2014, Argentina entered into a partial debt default as it was 
unable to make payments to those private creditors who had accepted exchange bonds as 
part of Argentina’s debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010. On July 31, 2014, Argentina’s 
credit rating on its foreign currency debt was downgraded to ‘selective default’ by several 
credit rating agencies. If the situation remains unresolved for too long, Argentina’s 
economy will suffer, and more so if macro policies do not adjust. The Argentine 
Government has expressed its willingness and capacity to continue paying the 
restructured bonds. The Government also stated that it had paid its debt obligation to 
exchange bond holders but that the Court ruling did not allow for the transfer of payment 
to recipient bondholders. If an agreement with the holdout creditors is reached in a 
relatively short time, the impact on the economy would be limited.  
International reserve losses, the fiscal deficit, and persistent inflation as well as policy 
uncertainty continue to create short- and medium-term challenges. Fiscal and external 
accounts are likely to continue posting deficits, with the risk of fueling inflationary 
pressures and weakening resilience to shocks. GDP growth is likely to remain sluggish. 
Uncertainties about the regulatory and business environment could potentially constrain 
access to finance, discourage foreign investors, and adversely affect economic outcomes. 
Macroeconomic vulnerability and sluggish growth are likely to reduce investment and 
employment creation as well as making it difficult to sustain socially inclusive spending. 
The Government is aware of the risks and recently adopted policies—including the 
exchange rate depreciation, tightening of monetary policy and reduction of gas and water 
subsidies—suggest the Government’s willingness to control macroeconomic imbalances. 
Efforts towards improving statistical quality and reaching agreement on international 
settlements may also improve investor confidence and facilitate new foreign investment.  
• Uncertainty in the global economy could create downside risks to demand for Argentine 
products. Argentina is particularly exposed to commodity price swings and droughts. 
Agricultural and agribusiness exports make up the lion’s share of Argentina’s total 
merchandise exports (about 60 percent in 2013) and export taxes are an important fiscal 
resource (about 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013).  
• At the political level, there may be opposition to government policies. In addition, the 
2015 presidential elections may cause changes in government priorities. However, the 
WBG program is focusing on areas where there is wide consensus across the political 
spectrum. The CPS Performance and Learning Review would take place after the 
October 2015 elections and would give the WBG and the Government an opportunity to 
revisit program priorities.  
• At the program level, while continued significant efforts from both national and sub-
national Governments and the WBG will be made, it is likely that project implementation 
issues will arise, e.g., due to challenges in retaining highly skilled staff in project 
implementation units, complex fiduciary and procurement arrangements, as well as 
administrative requirements of the institutions involved. An expanded engagement at the 
provincial level may also require additional capacity building at the local level, where 
lags persist. The WBG will continue to hold regular portfolio reviews and joint 

vii 

 
 
 
 
implementation workshops to address bottlenecks and provide solutions. In addition, the 
WBG will seek simplicity of project design.

Argentina for FY15-18 focuses on the need to sustain social gains achieved in recent years 
and expand social inclusion in an efficient and sustainable manner, while supporting 
Argentina in mitigating the risks to vulnerable groups of economic downturns and external 
shocks. The CPS builds on lessons learned from previous strategies. In addition, it is aligned 
with both the country’s development goals and the WBG’s new strategy, which establishes the 
key goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. 
Following this introduction, the CPS presents the poverty and shared prosperity diagnostic, gives 
an overview of economic developments and outlook, analyzes the development challenges, 
summarizes the Government program, outlines the proposed WBG engagement for FY15-18, 
and identifies key risks and the ways in which they will be managed. Annexes provide more 
detailed information on selected economic and social aspects of Argentina and on the WBG’s 
engagement with the country.  

I. COUNTRY DIAGNOSIS 
Poverty, Inclusion, and Shared Prosperity  

A. 

Developments since 2002 

2. 
Since its economic crisis of 2002, Argentina has been one of the top two performers 
in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region in reducing poverty and sharing the 
gains of rising prosperity by expanding the middle class. Total poverty (measured at $4-a-
day) 1 declined from 31.0 percent in 2004 to 10.8 percent in 2012 (see Figure 3 and Box 1), while 
extreme poverty (measured at $2.50-a-day) fell from 17.0 percent to 4.7 percent. 2 Income 
inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, fell from 50.2 in 2004 to 42.5 in 2012. Argentina’s 
poverty rate and Gini coefficient are among the lowest in LAC. At the same time, the middle 
class in Argentina grew by 68 percent between 2004 and 2012, reaching 53.7 percent of the 
population. Regarding non-monetary poverty, according to INDEC census figures, the 
proportion of the population with at least one unsatisfied basic need fell from 17.7 percent in 
2001 to 12.5 percent in 2010.

are national. Note that data are unavailable for Brazil in 2010, Colombia in 2006 and 2007, and Mexico in 2007, 2009, and 2011. Poverty rates 
and Gini coefficients for these years are interpolated using a linear average. 

Box 1. Harmonization of Poverty Data and Price 

All of the document’s data attributed to “SEDLAC (CEDLAS and the World Bank)” rely on a harmonized version 
of the urban-only household survey data from the Encuesta Permanente de Hogares-Continua (EPHC). This survey 
is collected quarterly by Argentina’s Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INDEC), although the results 
included in this document use the combination of the third and fourth quarters only.  
The harmonization undertaken by CEDLAS and the World Bank increases the comparability of household surveys 
among various LAC countries, allowing for internationally comparable indicators. The EPHC is representative of 
the 61 percent of the population living in the 31 largest urban areas in the country. While the majority of the 
population is urban, previous analysis suggests that urban-only household surveys may underestimate national 
poverty: the 2001 census showed the rural population and those living in small towns were significantly more likely 
to have at least one unsatisfied basic need (at 36 and 24 percent, respectively) than the rest of the population (at 16 
percent). 
All monetary measures, including poverty rates, are adjusted to USD in 2005 purchasing power parity using private 
estimates of inflation, which differ from official estimates. As a result, poverty is reported using international 
poverty lines. The official poverty line is largely adjusted using official inflation rates. In addition, as the 
harmonization process may result in an income aggregate different from the official income aggregate, the 
harmonized data cannot be used to calculate official poverty rates. In the future, both poverty statistics should 
converge as official inflation estimates based on a revised methodology become available and a new poverty line is 
introduced. 

3. 
The sustained decline in poverty and inequality was a function of high and pro-poor 
growth. Income growth accounted for 58 percent of poverty reduction, while changes in income 
distribution accounted for 42 percent. The growth pattern was strongly pro-poor during 2004-12. 
Average annual income growth was 5.1 percent, while the income of the bottom 40 percent of 
the population grew at an annual average of 8.8 percent. Even within the bottom 40 percent, 
income growth since 2004 has strongly and consistently favored the poorest, with the bottom 
decile experiencing annualized growth rates of 11.1 percent, nearly three times the 3.8 percent 
for those in the top decile.

4. 
Employment growth was significant and markedly different from the 1990s. The 
growth rate of employment in 2004-13 was 2.9 percent, compared to 0.4 percent in 1992-2000. 
Figure 4(a) shows that employment increased among all firm types and particularly among larger 
firms (employing more than five workers). Consequently, large firms’ share of total employment 
increased from 30.8 in 2004 to 35.1 percent in 2012 (see Figure 4b). Rising formal private-sector 
employment resulted in declining informality rates for wage-earners—from 58 percent in 2004 to 
46 percent in in 2012. 3 In addition, the self-employment rate fell slightly, from 20 percent to 17 
percent of adults with jobs. The improvement in job quality resulted in higher earnings.

Note that unpaid workers and employers are not reported in the figures above. Combined, these two groups account for 5 percent of employment 
in 2004 and in 2012. 

5. 
Labor market outcomes drove urban poverty reduction. Increased labor earnings and 
employment levels accounted for nearly 71 percent of the fall in poverty seen between 2004 and 
2012 (see Figure 5). Poverty reduction through employment was so strong because both new 
jobs and higher earnings largely benefited lower-skilled groups. Higher earnings were the 
primary driver for individuals and families moving out of poverty, accounting for more than half 
of overall poverty reduction. Increases in employment accounted for 17 percent of the reduction 
in poverty—11 percent attributable to male and 6 percent to female employment.

6. 
Labor market outcomes benefitted men more than women. Gains were stronger for 
low-skilled men. The average monthly real earnings of men who completed primary schooling 
rose 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. 4 Earnings for men with post-secondary schooling, on 
the other hand, rose 40 percent during the period. On the other hand, women’s earnings grew 
between 16 and 30 percentage points less than similarly educated men. Today, women continue 
to be less likely than men in employment and, if they are working, more likely to be employed in 
the informal sector. They also suffer from higher unemployment rates and have lower earnings 
(see Annex 11).  

7. 
Non-labor income, especially pensions, accounted for about one-third of the decline 
in poverty. Social spending directly benefited 44.6 percent of the population in 2009, including 
91.9 percent of those in extreme poverty and 78.8 percent of those in moderate poverty. Social 
spending was progressive, and well-targeted. 5  

8. 
The population’s asset base and human development outcomes improved over the 
past 10 years but important gaps remain. Among urban children, for example, access to 
sanitation rose from 68.7 percent in 2004 to 78.4 percent in 2012. Educational attainment has

differ from official estimates (see Box 1). 
5 Pension income contributed 21 percent to poverty reduction in 2004-12 and 31 percent in 2007-12 because of the 
moratorium. The primary beneficiaries of the pension moratorium—nearly 90 percent according to official 
statistics—were women who did not have 30 years of contributions into the pension system. Another 7 percent of 
the decline in poverty in 2004-12 derived from public transfers, including conditional cash transfers (CCTs). 
Extreme poverty in 2009 was nearly half what it would have been in the absence of progressive social spending.

also increased somewhat, with the share of 19-25 year olds who did not attend secondary school 
falling from 17.6 percent to 11.5 percent during the period. Nonetheless international test scores 
show deficits in the quality of education. Argentina has made remarkable improvement in 
reducing the infant mortality rate (IMR) from 20.2 in 2002 to 11.1 per 1,000 live births in 2013.  

Today and Risks for the Future 

9. 
Significant regional disparities persist with respect to poverty and access to basic 
services. The gap between regions has grown since the 2002 crisis, with Patagonia far outpacing 
Northeast and Northwest regions (see Figure 6). In addition, disparities exist among and within 
provinces in terms of levels of economic and social development and access to high-quality basic 
services, such as education, health, roads, and water. Even the more developed Province of 
Buenos Aires accommodates a large number of poor people lacking basic services and 
opportunities for escaping poverty (1.7 million persons).

10. 
Argentina has been socially inclusive but endowments and opportunities continue to 
vary. Gender equality has improved, putting Argentina among LAC leaders, especially in female 
political participation (37.4 percent of seats in Congress in 2012), literacy rates (97.8 percent in 
2010), primary school enrollment and completion, and contraceptive use (78 percent in 2005). 
However, it fares worse than other upper-middle-income countries (UMCs) in several other key 
areas, including teenage pregnancy (54.7 births per 1,000 women ages 15-19 in 2012, compared 

5 

 
 
 
 
to 31.2) and maternal mortality rates (35 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013). A more detailed 
gender analysis is included in Annex 11.  

11. 
Indigenous people continue to be worse off, despite provincial and federal programs 
to improve their well-being. Indigenous people (2.5 percent of the population) mostly live in 
the provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Chubut, Neuquén, Tierra del Fuego, Chaco, Formosa, Santa Fe, 
Tucuman, and Mendoza. In access to services, 23.5 percent of indigenous households have 
unsatisfied basic needs, compared to 13.8 for the rest of the population. 6 Schools in 
predominantly indigenous communities are among the worst performing, especially in Spanish. 
Illiteracy among the indigenous population stands at 3.8 percent compared to 1.9 percent for the 
rest of the population. Although access to public health services is high, 47.4 percent of 
indigenous people do not have access to health insurance, and only 10 percent over the age of 65 
are covered by the social security system.  

12. More than 40 percent of the population is vulnerable to adverse shocks. As of 2012, 
10.9 percent of the population lived in poverty (living on less than $4 per day). Another 33 
percent was vulnerable (living on between $4 and $10 per day) to falling back into poverty in the 
event of an adverse shock.

Three main challenges create risks to sustaining and further expanding the gains in 
poverty reduction and mitigating vulnerabilities. 
a. Historically, 
the 
greatest vulnerability of 
Argentina’s population 
to poverty stems from the 
economy’s exposure 
to 
adverse economic shocks, 
which 
reduces 
employment 
and 
earnings and limits the 
ability to finance social 
programs supporting the 
poor. Prolonged periods of 
slower growth or recession 
also create challenges for 
poverty reduction. Figure 7

that poverty and

the 
1990s.

Even so, the impact of the 2002 crisis was severe and widespread, leading to a one-year increase 
of 56 percent in extreme poverty and 34 percent in moderate poverty.  
b. Low asset endowments limit participation in economic activity, putting the poor and 
vulnerable further at risk. Educational attainment is strongly correlated with labor market 
outcomes, and the poor have substantially lower educational attainment. Among heads of 
household in 2012, the average years of schooling was 8.8 for those living in poverty compared 
to 11.2 for the middle class. Similarly, the unemployment rate among 25-65 year-olds living in 
poverty was 24 percent in 2012, compared to 7.4 percent overall. The self-employment rate—
which may indicate lack of access to good employment opportunities—was 23 percent among 
the poor, compared to 16 percent overall. Similarly, lack of access to energy, transport, and water 
and sanitation limits the ability of the poor to access education and health services and 
participate in economic activities.  
c. Environmental and natural resources degradation undermines sustainable growth, in 
a resource-based economy, affecting particularly the poor. Natural capital contributes 17 
percent to national wealth in Argentina. 7 The total cost of environmental degradation amounts to 
about 7 to 8 percent of GDP. The economic cost of damage from environmental health problems 
associated with urban and indoor air pollution, noise, inadequate water supply, and sanitation and 
hygiene are equivalent to about 3 to 4 percent of GDP. Vulnerability to natural disasters 
associated with extreme weather events and deforestation and the corresponding loss of 
biodiversity result in economic costs of about 4 percent of GDP. The increasing specter of 
adverse climate change impacts on Argentina’s natural resources underscores the need for a 
sustainable and inclusive growth path, especially for the poorest households that are often the 
most dependent on these resources.  

B. 

Economic Developments and Outlook 

14. 
After the 2002 crisis Argentina grew rapidly and in an inclusive manner. Post-crisis 
annual GDP growth averaged 6 percent from 2003 to 2013—well above the 1.6 percent average 
witnessed from 1980 to 2000 – and third in LAC behind Panama and Peru. The growth surge 
resulted mainly from rapid export gains as well as internal consumption and private investment. 
Rising commodity prices pushed Argentina’s terms of trade up by 20 percent from 2003 to 2013, 
and trading partners’ growth further enhanced export performance. Growth was driven by 
productivity gains that facilitated some catch-up with levels of the United States, Chile, and 
Mexico (see Figure 8). Recent growth is attributable to increases in total factor productivity 
(TFP) and, to a lesser degree, in capital stock. 8 Productivity increases were largely driven by 
capital-intensive industries with mid-level skilled labor in the manufacturing, utilities, and 
transportation/communication sectors. The recent improvement in TFP is good for the long-term 
health of the labor market, although the challenge will be to sustain the recent trends. Real wage 
increases have been strong since 2007 and have outpaced labor productivity after 2010 (see 
Annex 9). 

7 Staff calculations. 
8 TPF is measured using a standard Cobb-Douglas production function. It includes a margin of error because it is 
measured as a residual, and the margin of error could be higher in the context of changing relative prices, such as 
terms of trade or the relative price of capital. The data source is the Penn World Table and estimations are not 
adjusted for capacity utilization and labor quality.

15. Growth was particularly strong in the first part of the past decade; however, over 
time macro imbalances and policy uncertainty have become more visible.  For a while, the 
strong economic performance before and, in part, after the global financial turmoil (see Figure 9) 
overshadowed growing macroeconomic imbalances, including inflation and a deteriorating 
business environment, particularly in an energy sector affected by subsidies and their attendant 
disincentives. Weakening fiscal and current account balances as well as the fall in international 
reserves increased macroeconomic risk in the second half of the decade. Government 
interventions in the economy, nationalizations, and international legal disputes increased policy 
uncertainty. Changes in the methodology of measuring the CPI resulted in consistent differences 
between official figures and private estimates, and increasing trade and exchange restrictions 
further weakened the business environment. The section below presents the developments since 
the previous CPS.  

Economic Developments since the Last CPS 

16. 
Economic activity rallied in 2010-11 but has since slowed. The impact of the global 
2008 financial crisis was short-lived and GDP grew by an annual average of 8.8 percent in 2010-
11. However, real GDP growth decelerated to 0.9 percent in 2012 before rebounding to 2.9 
percent in 2013. 9 Growth was mostly driven by the expansion of service sectors during 2010-13 
(see Figure 10). The growth deceleration was also reflected in declining investment rates. 
Investment as a share of GDP stood at 17 percent in 2013, compared to 19 percent during 2005-
2009. Argentina’s investment to GDP ratios are lower than comparator emerging economies and 
fall significantly short of the rapidly growing Asian economies (see Figure 11).

index.

17. 
Fiscal accounts have come under pressure as expenditures outpaced revenues. The 
fiscal surplus began declining in 2009, and the budget turned from balance into a deficit after 
2010, gradually increasing to about two percent by 2013. In 2012, a primary deficit of 0.2 
percent of GDP was recorded for the first time in a decade. Provincial budgets also posted fiscal 
deficits, averaging 0.5 percent of GDP since 2009 (with the exception of 2010). Total revenues 
expanded at an average rate of 28.9 percent between 2010 and 2013, higher than official and 
private inflation estimates. In other words, revenues increased in real terms. However, they were 
outpaced by expenditures, which grew at an average rate of 30.8 percent. Subsidies, particularly 
to energy, transport, and food, increased from 0.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to more than 3.5 
percent of GDP in 2013 (see Figure 12). Over the same period, social expenditures increased 
from 17 to 21 percent of GDP (see Annex 7). The increase was notably stronger for the social 
security system. 10  

18. 
From 2009 to 2013, total national tax collection increased from 22 to 26 percent of 
GDP. VAT collection and social security contributions averaged more than 6 percent of GDP, 
followed by income tax at 5 percent and export taxes at approximately 2 percent. Amid rising 
commodity prices, export taxes proved to be a robust source of revenue. However, taxing profits 
of exporting sectors could be more efficient and incomes from commodity exports can be 
volatile. A decline in commodity prices or growth in trading partners is likely to reduce fiscal 
revenues and lead to further expansion of the fiscal deficit. Less volatile revenue sources could 
strengthen fiscal accounts and their predictability. 

19. 
Fiscal deficits would be larger if accrued earnings of the Central Bank and non-
reinvested returns from the national pension administration are excluded. Current revenue 
was augmented by accrued Central Bank earnings from increases in the value of its assets and by 
the non-reinvested returns from the investments of the Sustainability Guarantee Fund, managed 

10 Future pressure from the social security system stems from the aging population: if coverage of the elderly is 
maintained above 90 percent, an additional 1 percent of GDP increase in social protection spending is projected by 
2030 because of population aging.

by the national pension administration. During the 2008 international financial crisis, the entire 
pension system was nationalized, individual accounts were transferred to the Sustainability 
Guaranty Fund, and private pension funds dissolved (see Box 2). Income from the Central Bank 
and the National Administration of Social Security (ANSES) is recorded in the Government’s 
budget as current revenue under the property income category. These non-conventional revenue 
sources added up to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013 (see Figure 13).

Box 2. Nationalization of Pension Funds, Aerolíneas Argentinas, and YPF 

Pension System: The Argentine public pension system had been reformed in 1994, when individual private pension 
funds were introduced. In 2005, a moratorium expanded the pension system’s coverage to the population of 
retirement age who had not made sufficient contributions. In 2007, pensioners in private funds were given the option 
to change to the public pension system. After various reforms and changes, the sustainability of the pension system 
as a whole, including the private funds, was not achieved. Private pension funds collapsed during the 2008 
international financial crisis. The Government nationalized the entire system, aiming also to achieve full coverage of 
the system. Private funds were dissolved, and individual accounts were transferred to the Sustainability Guaranty 
Fund (FGS in Spanish).  

National Airline: In September 2008, Congress approved the acquisition of Aerolíneas Argentinas and Austral, the 
two major national airlines. The Government cited the weak financial position of these companies and their poor 
management as the motivation for the nationalization. The law stipulated that the National Valuation Court would 
determine the final price to be paid. In February 2014, the Argentine justice system ratified the negative value of 
$950 million, which was considered insufficient by the company. A case against Argentina has been filed at the 
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  

YPF: On May 3, 2012, the Argentine Congress passed a law for the Government to assume ownership of 51 percent 
of YPF, previously controlled by the Spanish company Repsol. YPF is Argentina’s largest oil company with a 
market value of $10-13 billion at the time of the nationalization. The Government cited lack of investment by 
Repsol and the deterioration of the energy balance as motivations for the takeover. In February 2014, almost two 
years after the nationalization, Repsol’s Board of Directors and shareholders approved a settlement of nearly $5 
billion from Argentina.

Budget deficits were largely financed by short-term Central Bank advances, leading 
to monetary expansion. Annual Central Bank advances represented 22 percent of the local 
currency indebtedness in 2013, compared to 12 percent in 2010. After 2012, the stock of Central 
Bank advances as a percentage of the monetary base increased when the new Central Bank 
charter raised the limit on transfers to government. The stock of advances surged from 30 percent 
of the monetary base in 2011 to 48 percent in 2013. The monetary base stood at about 11 percent 
of GDP in 2013 and the financing of the fiscal deficit through short-term Central Bank advances 
creates risks of fueling inflation since it amounts to a significant portion of the monetary base. 
The M2/GDP ratio in Argentina is about 18 percent—a low value when compared to countries 
with similar per capita income level.  

21. 
Argentina’s external situation has weakened since 2008. A worsening trade balance 
and strong income and service account deficits have been factors in the deterioration of external 
accounts. While expansionary fiscal policies increased domestic demand, real appreciation of the 
Argentine peso shifted expenditures toward imported goods and services. The Government opted 
for trade and exchange rate restrictions to control the weakening of external balances. These 
restrictions ranged from regulations regarding purchases of US dollars and taxation on the use of 
credit cards abroad to replacement of automatic import licenses by strict import controls (see 
Box 3). On the back of these capital controls, Argentina registered a net capital inflow of $397 
million in 2013, compared to net outflows of $21.5 million in 2011 and $3.4 billion in 2012. 
However, the current account balance weakened in 2013, resulting in a trade surplus of only $8.0 
billion—36 percent less than in 2012 and the lowest since 2003—and a current account deficit of 
$4.6 billion, reflecting the continuing pressure on external accounts. Although the restrictions 
may have slowed the deterioration in external accounts, they were not fully effective to reverse 
or stop the deterioration. At the same time, the restrictions are likely to reduce the country’s 
potential growth through their impact on the business environment and investment.  

Box 3. The Impact of Trade and Foreign Exchange Restrictions 

Trade Restrictions: The Government started to impose stricter trade controls in 2011, adding to restrictive exchange 
rate policies. Subsequently, the number of new trade controls increased and exceeds the number of newly introduced 
measures in other Latin American countries (see Figure below).

Notable trade restricting measures included a policy that imports and exports need to be balanced for several 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
industries; the obligation to repatriate foreign earnings in the mining, oil, and gas sectors; the elimination of the 
automatic import licensing regime; the introduction of pre-approval requirements for imports; and the introduction 
of price controls on imports of a multitude of goods. In February 2012, the Government required that all proposed 
import operations must be approved by Government. Importers have to present a sworn declaration of the goods and 
services they wish to import to the tax collection agency (AFIP) and the Secretariat of Internal Commerce. 

Foreign exchange restrictions: Initial measures were taken in November 2011. Gas, oil, and mining companies were 
required to repatriate 100 percent of all future export earnings (up from 70 percent), while insurance companies 
were told to repatriate funds held abroad. Non-residents were obligated to conduct their foreign exchange 
transactions through the foreign exchange rate market, while residents are required to get prior authorization from 
AFIP to purchase dollars (to a maximum of $2000/month) in commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus. In 
January 2012 the Central Bank restricted transfers of dividends abroad and required increased reserve levels. 

Impact of Restrictions: Although real appreciation of the peso made imports relatively cheap, numerous formal and 
informal trade barriers reduced imports. At the same time, the high export taxes on agricultural products in 
conjunction with the overvalued official exchange rate gave companies an incentive to under-invoice their exports 
and increase their inventories amid expectations of faster currency depreciation. Overall, trade restrictions may have 
slowed down the deterioration of the trade surplus. However, barriers to services imports and profit remittances have 
not proven effective. Some of the components of the services account recorded their highest deficits in 2012. A 
sustainable improvement in the current account balance would require a coordinated policy change to improve 
competitiveness and encourage domestic savings. 

22. 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows fell in 2013. Inflows rose from $4.0 billion in 
2009 to $12.1 billion in 2012, averaging 2 percent of GDP. The FDI increase was attributable to 
profit reinvestment of $8.1 billion in 2012. Profit transfers and dividends from foreign 
companies have fallen from $11.7 billion in 2010 to $8.3 billion in 2013, led by the non-financial 
private sector. In 2013, total inflows fell 25 percent, and equity contributions contracted 36 
percent. 

23. 
International reserves declined. With restricted access to international capital markets, 
US dollar reserves have been the only financing source for servicing external debt. Deterioration 
of the current account balance created additional pressures on international reserves. The 
appreciated currency encouraged consumption and led to an increase in spending by Argentines 
traveling abroad and to a major deterioration in the energy balance. The latter was further 
exacerbated by energy subsidies (see Figure 14 and Figure 15). Hence, Central Bank reserves 
declined from $52.2 billion in 2010 to $30.6 billion in 2013. Compared to other emerging 
economies, Argentina’s reserves-to-imports ratio is at the lower end (see Figure 16 and Figure 
17). Without access to fresh capital flows or a major improvement in the current account 
balance, declining international reserves will continue to be a risk.

24. 
Inflation varied according to different estimates. The official national inflation figure 
for 2013 was 10.9 percent. In the same year, the average of four provinces (Neuquen, San Luis, 
Santa Fe, Tierra del Fuego) showed an annual inflation rate of 25.2 percent based on official 
provincial statistics. Market analysts have contested official inflation numbers since 2007, 
releasing their own estimates. Three members of the opposition in Congress have been reporting 
the average of some private market analysts estimates on a regular basis. According to their 
figures, inflation was 28.4 percent in 2013. No public information exists on the sources and the 
methodology of these inflation estimates as well as their coverage. (see Box 5 for details).  

25. 
Faced with continued inflationary pressures, the Government opted for a number of 
heterodox measures to control inflation. In 2013, it reached an agreement with the largest 
supermarket chains to freeze retail prices from January to June, and prices were stable until July.

In 2014, the Secretary of Commerce added the productive sectors to the arrangement and 
established quarterly price revisions. 11 The impact of price freeze arrangements on inflation is 
likely to be temporary. Prices could increase every time the freeze agreements are renewed and 
retailers may reduce the supply of those goods of which prices are frozen. Fundamental factors 
behind inflation include the expansionary fiscal and monetary policy mix. Also the reform of the 
Central Bank charter in early 2012 further expanded possibilities for fiscal financing (see Box 4). 
The monetary base increased by an average of 33 percent a year in 2010-13. 

26. 
Argentina’s financial system has remained sound but less developed than countries 
with similar income levels. The financial landscape is dominated by banks and the 
Sustainability Guarantee Fund, with insurance companies, mutual funds, and other nonbank 
financial institutions playing a relatively small role. Overall, the banking sector appears resilient, 
protected by large capital and liquidity buffers and strong quality of assets. Banks’ profitability 
has recovered in recent years, supported by sizable financial margins and strong service income. 
In 2012, credit to the private sector represented 18 percent and deposits 23 percent of GDP. 
Long-term finance is almost non-existent. Capital markets have low depth, small institutional 
investors, and debt issues average 1.5 years. Trade finance declined after implementation of 
foreign exchange controls in 2011. In the absence of long-term funding, most transactions are 
settled in cash and firms rely on retained earnings to finance investments. In recent years, the 
Central Bank has made strides in upgrading regulation and supervision to Basel II standards and 
has developed a road map for implementation of Basel III. However, transition to the new 
regulatory framework could be complicated by the uncertainty regarding key economic 
variables, which makes pricing financial risks more difficult. 

Box 4. The New Central Bank Charter Increased the Limit for Transfers to the Public Sector 

On March 22, 2012, Congress approved a new Central Bank charter. It brought two main changes: (i) a more active 
role for the Central Bank in allocating credit, and (ii) expanded possibilities for fiscal financing. In the first case, the 
new charter gives the Central Bank’s Directorate a new role in allocating credit through the application of 
differential reserve requirements for commercial banks. The charter also allows the Central Bank to apply different 
policies for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and regional economies. These changes move the Central 
Bank closer to being a development bank. In the second case, the abolition of the Convertibility Law will allow the 
government to tap previously unexploited reserves for debt-service payments, with no need to maintain any legal 
balance between reserves and the monetary base. Another important change, which will increase financing available 
to the Treasury, is the doubling of the temporary advances the Central Bank can transfer to the Treasury. The new 
charter states that the Central Bank will be able to transfer temporary advances of up to 12 percent of the monetary 
base and 10 percent of the Treasury’s revenues from the previous year, whether to pay debt in foreign currency or 
for other purposes. 

27. 
Debt levels have declined. Continued primary surpluses, together with restructurings of 
defaulted sovereign debt in 2005 and 2010, led to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 166 
percent in 2002 to 32.8 percent in the third quarter of 2013. Bondholders tendered more than 93 
percent of the debt by 2010. Until recently, the untendered debt amounted to about $11 billion. 
With limited access to international capital markets since 2008, the Government has increasingly 

11 Known as “Precios Cuidados”, the program publishes a list of products with their corresponding prices. It first 
started in the Greater Area of Buenos Aires but has also been used in other parts of the country and other sectors, 
such as for construction materials. In the second stage of the program that started in April 2014, 108 products were 
added to the previous 194 and a 3 percent average increase in prices was allowed. 

14 

 
                                                           
relied on inter-public sector borrowing and Central Bank reserves to service sovereign debt. Now 
more than 60 percent of the total debt is owed to public agencies, which may pose a challenge 
for the long-term fiscal sustainability of the creditor public institutions. 12  

Most Recent Economic Developments and Policies 

28. 
Argentina has begun to address several macroeconomic imbalances, although a 
larger set of coordinated policy changes is required to address them fully. The Government 
took steps in early 2014 to rebalance the current account and stop the fall in international 
reserves. Primarily, the Central Bank allowed a significantly faster depreciation rate, 32 percent 
in 2013 followed by 23 percent during the first quarter of 2014. Foreign exchange restrictions 
were loosened and the black-market premium reacted positively and narrowed. The exchange 
rate has remained stable since February and averaged AR$8.12/US$1 in June. Low-interest 
credit lines for agricultural producers and exporters were frozen, creating incentives to sell 
production and bring in foreign exchange earnings. The Central Bank lowered the limit on the 
equity that banks could hold in foreign currency to 30 percent, leading to increased sales of 
foreign exchange in the first four months of 2014. These measures halted the fall in reserves in 
April, bringing the level to $29.3 billion at the end of June. 

29. Monetary policy was tightened. The Central Bank complemented the devaluation with a 
large increase in interest rates. Between January and February 2014, the implicit rate of the 
Central Bank’s three-month and twelve-month notes (LEBACS) increased by 900 basis points, 
leaving three-month notes at 28.8 percent and twelve-month notes at 30.2 percent. Through these 
auctions, the Central Bank absorbed AR$60 billion during the first six months of 2014, more 
than 15 percent of the monetary base, and contributed to the AR$15 billion contraction of the 
monetary base. As a result, its debt stock in notes increased to AR$151.8 billion, and the stock’s 
mean interest rate jumped from 17 percent to almost 22 percent. 

30. 
The government announced a 20 percent reduction in subsidies on gas and water in 
March 2014. The reduction in subsidies to all residential and commercial consumers will be 
implemented in three steps. Initial cuts started in April and the Government also introduced 
further cuts for June and August. In an attempt to encourage efficient use, users who cut their 
consumption by more than 20 percent will avoid tariff increases. The cost of these services for 
residential consumers is expected to increase by an average of more than 200 percent. Pensioners 
and beneficiaries of social security will not see any increase in their tariffs. 

31. 
The Government has launched a new nationwide price index in 2014, which was 
considered important progress by markets and across the political spectrum (sees Box 5). 
The new index showed higher inflation readings compared to the previous index. From January 
to June 2014, the cumulative inflation rate was 15 percent. In addition to the changes in the 
inflation index, the devaluation of the Argentine peso in early 2014 had a high pass-through 
effect on prices. Regarding provincial inflation numbers, the average of the three provinces 
(Neuquen, San Luis, Tierra del Fuego) showed a cumulative inflation of 21 percent during 
January-June 2014. Three members from the opposition in Congress continued to report inflation 

12 This reflects data from the third quarter of 2013. 

15 

 
                                                           
figures reflecting the average of some private estimates, which showed 20 percent inflation for 
the same period (see Box 5 for the debate on the methodology and coverage of these inflation 
estimates). All inflation measures showed a declining trend during January-June 2014.  

Box 5. Changes to Improve Officially Reported CPI and GDP Statistics 

Since 2007, critics have questioned the CPI published by INDEC, which only covered the Greater Buenos Aires 
area. The official inflation rate deviated significantly from the inflation rate reported by unofficial sources and 
provincial statistical offices. Between mid-2008 and 2013, the official annual inflation rate averaged 9.3 percent, 
whereas the average of the four provinces (Neuquen, San Luis, Santa Fe, Tierra del Fuego) showed an annual 
inflation rate of 21.1 percent based on provincial official statistics. The inflation numbers reported by the three 
members from the opposition in Congress, reflecting the mean of different private estimates, recorded an average 
annual inflation rate of 21.6 percent during 2010-2013. However, there also has been a debate on the methodology 
and the coverage of these inflation estimates, which are not made public. The Government also criticized them for 
being non representative and having methodological shortcomings. The co-existence of various inflation figures 
reflected the question about the quality of official statistics. The changes in the CPI also led to changes in other 
indices, such as poverty figures and the measurement of some components of the GDP. 

In early 2014, the new nationwide CPI was launched. It has a wide coverage, tracing 230,000 prices in more than 
13,000 stores in cities with more than 5,000 residents (almost 87 percent of the total population). The new index 
divides the country into six regions, with different baskets tailored to each region’s consumption patterns. 

The first results from the CPI were released on February 13, 2014, revealing an inflation rate of 3.7 percent in 
January. The monthly rate was significantly higher than the previous CPI’s 1.4 percent in December 2013. 
Subsequently, monthly inflation rates declined.  

In May 2014, INDEC published a new GDP index indicating a real growth rate of 2.9 percent for 2013. The new 
national accounts system uses 2004 as the base year instead of the 1993 base used in previous data. . 

32. 
Argentina’s progress on new inflation and GDP statistics are under review. On June 
6, 2014, the IMF Executive Board reviewed Argentina’s progress on improving its statistics, 
noting the successful completion of the requirements for this review. The Board considered the 
Managing Director’s report on Argentina’s progress in implementing an initial set of specified 
actions sought by the IMF to address the quality of the official data for the CPI and GDP. The 
Board recognized the implementation of all the specified actions it had called for at this juncture 
and the initial steps taken by the Argentine authorities to remedy the provision of inaccurate data. 
In line with the Board decision adopted in December 2013, the Argentine authorities are 
expected to implement actions previously specified for the end of September 2014 and the end of 
February 2015. 

33. 
The Government is working to settle international disputes. In October 2013, 
Argentina agreed to compensate five companies that had won ICSID rulings over investment 
disputes. The companies agreed to accept payment in Argentine bonds and with a 25 percent 
‘haircut’. As noted earlier, agreement with Repsol was reached on a $5 billion settlement in 
bonds on the nationalization of YPF in February 2014. Finally on May 29, 2014, the 
Government and Paris Club creditors reached an agreement to repay debt in arrears over a five- 
year period. The first payment was made in July 2014 (see Box 6). Also, Argentina still has an 
unresolved dispute with creditors that did not participate in the 2005 and 2010 debt 
restructurings. Argentina restructured its defaulted debt ($95 billion) with a significant haircut in 
two exchanges, one in 2005 and another in 2010, reaching 93 percent of acceptance among 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
bondholders (the “exchange bondholders”). A minority of bondholders that refused to 
participate in the exchange (the “holdouts”), among which is the hedge fund NML Capital, sued 
in New York City (where the bonds were issued) to collect the full amount. In June 2014, the 
US Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision which ordered Argentina to pay the holdout 
creditors whenever a payment to the exchange bondholders was made. 13 Argentina deposited 
$539 million in the Bank of New York Mellon (BoNY), the Indenture Trustee– before the 
scheduled payment due date (end June 2014) which was the amount due to exchange bond 
holders. However, the payment could not be transferred to the recipient bondholders as the 
Court ruling binds also the payment system intermediaries. 14 For this reason, the Argentine 
Government argues that the country did not enter into a default. Mediation so far has not 
produced an agreed solution. On July 31, 2014, Argentina’s credit rating on its foreign currency 
debt was downgraded to ‘selective default’ by several credit rating agencies.  

Box 6. Settling the Paris Club Debt 

Argentina’s Ministry of Economy and the Paris Club announced an agreement on May 29, 2014, to clear debt in 
arrears that Argentina owes to Paris Club creditors over a five year period. The main points of the agreement are: 
• The total stock of arrears was set at $9.7 billion as April 30, 2014. 
• The agreement provides a flexible structure for clearance of arrears within five years including a 
minimum of USD 1150 million to be paid by May 2015.(*) Another payment will be due in May 2016. 
• Paris Club members’ export credit agencies that wish to do so will resume their export credit activities. 

-------- 
(*): According to the terms agreed upon on 29 May 2014, the first payment of Argentina, due by 30 July, was 
made as scheduled. 

 Economic Outlook 

34. 
A prolonged slowdown is more likely than a deep economic rift. The sluggish 
economic performance, continued inflation, loss of reserves, a deterioration of the business 
environment and the ongoing debt challenges with the holdouts point to such slowdown. But 
debt ratios in the public and private sector are much smaller compared to the past decade and 
macroeconomic imbalances are still moderate (see Table 1). Argentina faces liquidity rather than 
solvency challenges, in financing its fiscal and current account deficits. In addition, the banking 
system is stronger and the economy today is not as dollarized and large currency mismatches of 

13 Argentina’s appeal to the US Supreme Court was denied on June 16, 2014, leaving the lower court decisions in 
place and posing additional macroeconomic challenges. The Court ordered Argentina to pay full face value plus 
accrued interest in cash ($1.3 billion) to NML Capital and other plaintiffs before paying the exchange bonds. In 
addition, the Court ruling binds the payment system intermediaries so that they cannot transfer payments to 
exchange bondholders unless Argentina pays the holdouts.  
14 Argentina argues that the payment to holdout creditors was not possible given the RUFO (Rights-of-Future-
Offers) clause included for exchange bond holders which stipulates that no better restructuring offer can be 
voluntarily made than those they had agreed to. The RUFO clause expires at the end of calendar year 2014. 

17 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
the convertibility regime do not exist. Hence, the risks of a sudden and deep debt or banking 
crisis are moderate.  

35. 
In the short-term, Argentina is facing significant risks arising from recent 
developments in the debt holdouts case. The impact of the stand-off with holdout creditors on 
the Argentine economy will depend on its duration. A solution in the next few months would 
likely have moderate impacts, deepening the slowdown somewhat. However, a prolongation of 
reaching a solution  beyond that could lead to further complications stemming from a potential 
acceleration of future payments to exchange bondholders which the latter could request given the 
default situation. Policies would need to adjust to fiscal, external and inflationary pressures more 
profoundly, including tightening of the fiscal and monetary stance as well as implementing an 
exchange rate regime which protects international reserves from falling further. 

36. 
Additional short-term risks stem from weak external and fiscal accounts. Growth 
deceleration in Argentina’s main trading partners (particularly in China and Brazil) 15 would 
adversely affect Argentina, particularly if commodity prices weaken. In 2013, 23.2 percent of 
exports were commodity-based and 36.2 percent were agro-industrial. The country’s exports 
contracted by 9 percent during the first quarter of 2014. Commodities and the car industry were 
hit particularly hard. The US Federal Reserve’s tapering of quantitative easing will increase the 
risks of portfolio adjustments, capital flow reversals, and increases in interest rates. In Argentina, 
public spending continues to put pressure on the fiscal accounts, although revenue increases have 
been considerable. In the absence of a fiscal tightening, financing needs are likely to create debt-
rollover challenges and the risk of fueling inflation. For exchange rates, the managed float can be 
expected to continue, possibly with further depreciations.  

37. 
Nonetheless, short term risks apart from the ongoing debt challenges with holdout 
creditors are manageable. The primary fiscal deficit is modest  and could potentially be 
contained by reducing subsidies to public utilities and the overall deficit could be financed in 
capital markets. Inflation could remain high but not hard to reign in once the Central Bank is 
given back its policy space to design a monetary program with an indicative interest rate interval 
or, if needed, a loose inflation target. The current account deficit is small and could be managed 
by a combination of more competitive exchange rate, gradual lifting of capital controls and debt 
issuance as well as by FDI inflows. 

38. Medium-term growth prospects in the next one to three years are moderate. Driven 
mostly by agriculture and manufacturing, annual GDP growth is projected to recover to around 
2-3 percent in the upcoming years. Inflation is expected to remain a significant challenge. The 
main internal challenges facing the economy over the medium term are the current account and 
fiscal deficits, inflationary pressures, declining levels of reserves, and a weakening ability to 
respond to shocks. Argentina increased fiscal revenues significantly in the last decade, which 
helped maintain a high level of public spending. However, a slowing growth rate or a fall in 
commodity prices could reduce the ability to sustain public spending at its current levels.  

15 Brazil is the destination of 21.6 percent of Argentina’s exports; nearly 80 percent of which is for the automotive 
industry.

39. 
Long-term growth prospects are strong. The economy has vast reserves of natural 
resources and sound social indicators. It also has a solid human capital basis. Historically, 
Argentina’s economic cycle has alternated between intense boom and bust phases, but growth 
drivers are still strong.  Realizing the growth potential will require tackling the short- and 
medium-run macro-economic challenges outlined above. 

40. 
The short- and medium-term risks and the long-term prospects create distinct 
challenges for poor and vulnerable households. The short-terms risks threaten growth, jobs, 
and the sustainability of social spending. These challenges are extended by the weakening 
business environment. Mitigating the risks requires addressing macro imbalances and ensuring 
the assets of the poor and vulnerable are protected from potential shocks, thereby strengthening 
the economy’s ability to create employment and expand shared prosperity. Addressing these 
risks requires increasing productivity and improving the business environment for firms and 
farms. Capitalizing on abundant natural and environmental capital for long-term growth requires 
investment in individuals’ asset base and a sound governance framework.

C. 
Country Development Challenges for Sustained Poverty Reduction and Shared 
Prosperity 

41. 
Protecting and expanding Argentina’s social inclusion gains requires sustained 
growth, macroeconomic resilience, efficiency and transparency in public spending and 
service delivery, and stewardship of natural and environmental resources. The poverty and 
shared prosperity analysis in section I-A highlights three main risks for sustained poverty 
reduction. These are (a) macroeconomic vulnerability to shocks; (b) an underdeveloped asset 
base of individual and households, limiting their ability to participate in economic activity; and  
(c) natural resource and environmental degradation. In this context, the short- and medium-term 
macroeconomic and fiscal risks described in the previous section are key development 
challenges. Primary among them is the decline in GDP growth relative to the past decade. 
Second is the sustainability of a fiscal framework that has supported a social contract based on 
high levels of spending. Third, labor income is critical for poverty reduction and a weakened 
business climate and labor market may have significant effects on poverty rates. Regarding the 
asset base of individuals and households, opportunities remain relatively high in Argentina; 
however, access to services and their quality is uneven across regions and parental 
circumstances, limiting upward mobility. The country could benefit from improving the 
regulatory and governance environments, which would foster a stronger investment climate and 
enhanced transparency in service delivery. Finally, given the importance of natural and 
environmental resources for long-term growth, their degradation represents an important 
challenge going forward and poses particular risks for vulnerable and poor households.  

Driving Employment Creation in Firms and Farms 

42. 
Increasing macroeconomic stability will require rebalancing the current and fiscal 
accounts, lowering inflation, and enhancing competitiveness. These are critical for Argentina 
to create the underlying conditions for firms and farms to flourish (see also Box 7 on Argentina’s 
long 
term growth drivers). In addition, strengthening 
the business environment and 
competitiveness will be important for encouraging investment, especially in infrastructure and 
energy—two critical areas for realizing Argentina’s potential. Argentina is South America’s 
largest natural gas producer and a significant producer of oil. The sector is heavily regulated, 
limiting the industry’s attractiveness to private investors while shielding consumers from rising 
prices. Demand continues to rise while production is in decline, leading to increasing 
dependence on imports and contributing to fiscal imbalances. 

Box 7. Argentina’s Long-term Growth Determinants 

Argentina’s low average growth rate is not due to its incapability to grow. On the contrary, Argentina is able to grow 
fast, but high growth phases alternate with crises. Empirical findings indicate that high fiscal volatility is consistent 
with low growth rates and high growth volatility, which in turn has contributed to the low average growth rates. 
Sources of fiscal instability include high policy volatility, lack of adherence to fiscal discipline and poor institutional 
development. 
Dornbusch and De Pablo (1987) argue that continuous fiscal problems had an adverse effect on investment and 
growth. A paper published by IDB (2009) underscores the importance of the policymaking process and the quality 
of the institutional framework for growth. Nicolini et al (2011), consider that the systematic mismanagement of 
government budgets is the principal reason for Argentina’s departure from its growth potential. In a paper for the 
World Bank, Fanelli (2012) emphasizes the weak property rights structure and low appropriability as a chronic 
problem in Argentina. Auguste (2012) highlights the negative impact of eroding human capital and macroeconomic 

21 

 
instability in the country’s TFP. He states that Argentina has lagged behind other countries throughout the 20th 
century, even if it has had phases of higher growth.  

Recommendations to unlock growth in Argentina focus on guaranteeing macroeconomic stability, strengthening 
property rights to promote investment, improving the education quality, and investing in infrastructure to alleviate 
bottlenecks and in R+D to boost productivity. Efficiency in the public sector should also be addressed, especially in 
the view that public spending has increased as a share of GDP. Efforts should be directed to reduce informality in 
the job market and tax avoidance.

The main obstacles to business development 
in Argentina 
include policy 
uncertainty, regulatory burden, and access to finance. The financial sector does not provide 
sufficient funding for productive investments, constraining firms to rely on retained earnings to 
finance investments and limiting leverage. Restrictions on imports and capital flows limit firms’ 
ability to access technology, innovate, and expand productive capacities. The high level of 
administrative burdens on firms, price regulations, and State involvement in commercial 
activities increase business risks and weaken the competitive environment. Creating the 
conditions for innovation, improved access to technology and financing, as well as enhanced 
competition will be key to further firm-level productivity growth.  

44. 
Argentina has a formal legal and institutional framework for enhancing good 
governance, including all branches of government; nonetheless, challenges remain with 
respect to effective enforcement. Its regional commitments are notable through participation in 
UNCAC’s MESISIC 16 (Committee of Experts), the anti-corruption agency that includes a 
mechanism through which civil servants can submit grievances. 17 Gaps between these laws and 
their effective enforcement, however, continue to be one of the country’s biggest governance 
challenges. An inefficient public sector in the executive and judicial branches, in particular, 
remain a serious concern, although domestic investment dispute resolution is available through 
both local courts and administrative tribunals. Further improving governance would foster 
private sector development and employment creation.  

45. 
Reducing the internal costs of exporting, importing, and distributing goods will 
improve firm and farm competitiveness. Argentina is almost 4,000 kilometers long and more 
than 1,000 kilometers wide, making transportation critical for trade and competitiveness. 18

Logistics costs (around 27 percent of GDP) are the second highest in Latin America and nearly 
three times higher than the average of Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) countries. 19 Argentina dropped from the 89th position in 2010/2011 to the 105th place 
in 2013/2014 in the competitiveness of its transport infrastructure services. 20 Deteriorating road 
infrastructure continues to create difficulties for the population; particularly in the poorer areas in 
the Northeast region. 

46. With half of Argentina’s population and 64 percent of its firms located in the five 
largest metropolitan regions, agglomeration presents both an opportunity and a threat for 
employment creation. 21 Cities are engines of economic growth and pathways out of poverty. 
Development is largely taking place on the outskirts of Argentina’s metropolitan regions and the 
benefits of agglomeration are being foregone while the costs are being compounded. For 
example, outdoor air pollution in Argentina is associated with 6,650 deaths and about 20 million 
days of illness a year. The demand and supply mismatch in service provision is manifested in the 
proliferation of slums and increasing inequalities in terms of access to land, housing, and 
services. In Greater Buenos Aires approximately 5 million people live in 1,500 settlements with 
irregular land tenure situations and inadequate access to basic services such as transportation, 
water, and sanitation. Their access to reliable and affordable public transportation is critical for 
jobs and keeping themselves out of poverty. 22  

47. Maintaining Argentina’s position as one of the world’s top food providers requires 
adapting to climate change and addressing the needs of smaller farmers. With more than 32 
million hectares of productive land and countercyclical seasonal advantages, Argentina has great 
potential in agriculture. While the effects of rising atmospheric temperatures on the frequency 
and intensity of El Niño events in the future remains uncertain, it is clear that an effect can be 
expected and evidence is emerging that points to more intense and frequent weather patterns. For 
Argentina this could mean increasingly adverse impacts from intense droughts as well as rainfall 
and flooding. To increase productivity, the large number of small and medium-sized farms in 
lagging regions need supporting infrastructure, access to finance, economies of scale that allow 
integration in supply chains, and access to state-of-the-art climate-smart production technologies. 
This will help link the smaller farms with the capital-intensive dynamic part of the sector, which 
includes global leaders in technology adoption.  

Asset Availability of Households and People  

48. 
Ensuring that poor and vulnerable households have the assets to cope with short- 
and medium-term risks requires strengthening public sector service delivery and investing 

and provincial roads (1.15 km/ 1000 inhabitants for Norte Grande versus 2.36 km/1000 inhabitants for the other 
regions).

22 In the five metropolitan regions of Argentina, one-third of the population at the bottom 40 percent of income 
depends on public or non-motorized (e.g., walking and cycling) transportation, which is almost 20 percentage points 
higher than the population in the top 60 percent of income. With expanding urbanization, trips are getting longer 
both in distance and time; and this along with a persistent underinvestment in public transport infrastructure is 
reducing urban productivity.

in basic infrastructure and human development. Provincial governments are responsible for 
the delivery of key basic services, including health, education, energy, water and sanitation, and 
roads. However, strong vertical imbalances between service delivery responsibilities and fiscal 
resources limit provincial capacity to deliver services effectively. 23 Substantial differences in 
revenue efforts, particularly in the poorer provinces, coupled with differences in management 
capacity leads to inequality in the provision of services.  

49. 
Improving basic services in the impoverished central and northern rural areas is 
important for human capital formation. The Government estimates most of the remaining 
people without modern energy services are low-income people living in isolated areas (about 
725,000 people). Access to improved water and sanitation is significantly worse in rural areas 
and poorer provinces—for example household access to improved sanitation was only 18.6 
percent in the northern province of Misiones in 2010. Water and sanitation issues are associated 
with nearly 980 deaths and about 17.6 million days of illness annually. Improved access to 
modern energy services, potable water, and sanitation is particularly important for ensuring that 
the poor and vulnerable have the assets they need to withstand potential shocks.  

50. 
Despite rremarkable improvements in healthcare coverage, significant inequalities 
persist in access and quality. Social health insurance coverage increased from 52 percent in 
2001 to 64 percent in 2010 thanks to an increase in formal employment. However, there are large 
differences across provinces and between socioeconomic groups. For instance, while the infant 
mortality rate in 2012 was 8.3/1000 in the City of Buenos Aires it was 17.3/1000 in the Province 
of Formosa. Similarly, chronic conditions and injuries (CCIs) will continue to rise because of the 
aging population; and CCIs disproportionately affect the poor, 24 partly because of the strong 
correlation between socioeconomic status and preventive behavior. Expanding basic health 
coverage to the working age population and limiting the onset of CCIs will reduce the growth in 
public health expenditure and have a positive economic impact on the labor market. 25 

51. 
Disparities in education are an impediment to getting better jobs. 26 The Argentine 
education system does not effectively promote equality of opportunities. PISA, OECD’s 
international standardized test, shows a negative trend in learning outcomes since 2000. 
Argentina shows the highest between-student variance in learning outcomes among all countries 
as well as the largest proportion of student-to-student variation in test scores because of 
socioeconomic conditions. 27  

23 The provinces are responsible for over 40 percent of the aggregated public sector spending, and approximately 70 
percent for education and health expenditures. However, out of the total tax collection only 15 percent correspond to 
provincial taxes. The rest is levied by the National Government and then distributed through the tax sharing system.

26 For example, the transition from lower to upper secondary education is much more difficult in rural areas than in 
urban areas (the dropout rate in the last year of lower secondary is 22.6 percent in rural areas versus 3.7 percent in 
urban areas), and the dropout rate among upper secondary school students is 3.7 percent in the top income quintile 
but it increases to 41.3 percent in the bottom quintile. Upper secondary dropout rates are also significantly higher 
among boys.

52. While there has been remarkable progress in reducing overall unemployment 
during the past decade, important challenges remain. Specifically, the unemployment rate 
among youth aged 16-24 years old was 16.5 percent in 2012, more than three times the 
unemployment rate of the population aged 25-64 years old. More than half of the youth with a 
salaried job were employed in the informal sector, while the same indicator was below 30 
percent for the population aged 25 to 64. Improving employability of vulnerable youth is 
essential to reducing inequality. Put more starkly, students from private schools are twice as 
likely to achieve a score of 2 or higher than students from public schools on a standardized PISA 
test. These findings indicate that children from lower socioeconomic strata have worse 
educational outcomes and can thus expect to have less success in the labor market as adults.  

Reducing Environmental Risks and Safeguarding Natural Resources  

53. 
Degradation of Argentina’s rich but fragile natural and environmental resources is 
a threat to long-term economic growth and social progress. Natural resources account for 
about 10 percent of GDP and 60 percent of all exports. Argentina’s total wealth per capita has 
increased over the last 15 years; however, this has been achieved through the degradation of 
natural and environmental resources, which might lose their capacity to contribute to Argentina’s 
growth. Also, estimates suggest that Argentineans have a higher estimated natural disaster loss 
per capita than most countries in the region; this poses a particular threat to the poor and 
vulnerable, who are least able to cope with these events.  

54. Over the past two decades, damages from natural disasters have been 
predominantly related to floods. The computed expected annual value of flood cost was about 
0.7 percent of GDP in 2012. Floods result in death tolls and loss of livelihoods. Unsustainable 
urban planning and territorial management practices has driven an increase in the exposure of 
people and assets to floods. Climate change may increase the likelihood of rainfall 
concentrations and increased river flow driving flood risk further up. Sea level rise associated 
with climate change could additionally significantly increase coastal flood risk for large parts of 
Buenos Aires coastal population. Improving disaster risk management through better urban and 
territorial planning and flood mitigation investments will protect households from disaster 
induced poverty.  

55. 
Environmental degradation poses a major cost to the economy and the poor. The top 
three priority issues, based on the orders of magnitude for their economic costs, are judged to be 
outdoor air pollution, exposure to lead, and access to water and sanitation for the urban poor. 28 
The annual cost of the environmental health effects is estimated to be about 3.4 percent of GDP. 
More than 80 percent of the cost is equally divided between outdoor air pollution, urban noise, 
and lead (Pb), while 12 percent is from inadequate water supply sanitation and hygiene, and 6 
percent is from household air pollution. Improving water quality in the Matanza-Riachuelo basin, 
the most contaminated river basin and visible environmental issue in the country, will improve 
living conditions for one of the most vulnerable populations in the country. 

28 See the background note “Why Sustaining Support to Rural Education is Important for Social Inclusion and 
Poverty Reduction in Argentina” prepared by World Bank staff.

56. 
Argentina is well endowed with natural forest resources that are home to some of 
the poorest indigenous communities and serve important environmental functions and 
commercial purposes. With deforestation rates on the order of 0.56 percent for the most critical 
natural areas, natural forests and the ecological services and biodiversity they provide are under 
threat. Deforestation means the loss of the services provided by these ecosystems, and the total 
mean annual cost of deforestation in wooded areas (savannah) is estimated at about $1.2 billion 
(0.3 percent of GDP), while the cost in tropical forests is estimated at about $2.4 billion (0.5 
percent of GDP). Supporting forest-dependent communities (that are largely composed of 
indigenous people) to carry out sustainable forest management, strengthen property rights, and 
improve efficiency of wood fuel use will help stem the rapid rate of deforestation.  

II. GOVERNMENT VISION  
57. 
The Government aims to maintain the achievements of the past decade and sustain 
inclusive growth. In an increasingly volatile international context, policies have been geared 
toward further reducing poverty and inequality, improving labor markets and social protection, 
and increasing productivity, as detailed below. The Office of the Cabinet Ministers outlined the 
strategic priorities and attendant actions, which focus on social and economic inclusion, public 
health, public safety, infrastructure investment, tourism, industry, and agriculture. 

58. 
The Government continues to see formal employment as the basis for social 
inclusion. It has developed a wide range of programs to improve labor quality and productivity, 
targeting youth employment through training and employment services. Additionally, a new law 
was passed in 2014 (Law 26.940) that promotes formalization of informal jobs. It is also 
considering technical and financial assistance to improve the incomes of small cooperatives and 
the self-employed. The Government also plans to provide training to 100,000 women to increase 
their job opportunities. 

59. 
The infrastructure investment program is a key priority for the Government. The 
objective continues to be to support investment in the more impoverished areas of the country 
while at the same time maintaining delivery of key basic services such as energy, water and 
sanitation, and transportation. Infrastructure development has a direct impact on the quality of 
life and on overall productivity. The Government has implemented extensive investment plans in 
energy, transportation, communications, and water and sanitation, such as the expansion and 
maintenance of the road system and the construction of 110,000 houses through the 
PRO.CRE.AR program. 

60. 
The Government’s strategy to promote productivity gains in the industrial sector is 
contained in the 2020 Strategic Industrial Plan. It defines a set of goals to reach by the year 
2020 in 11 strategic subsectors, seeking to increase production, investment, and industrialized 
exports. Several credit programs, like the FON.DE.AR and the FONAPyME, will continue 
financing small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) at low interest rates. The Government also 
considers science and technology essential for increasing productivity and development in 
upcoming years. The Ministry of Science and Technology will continue promoting R&D in all 
productive sectors and funding scientific research through the National Scientific and Technical 
Research Council. It will also continue its flagship program of repatriating Argentine scientists, 
the Red de Argentinos Investigadores y Científicos en el Exterior (RAICES). 

26 

 
61. 
The Government will seek to improve the agricultural sector’s competitiveness, 
focusing on small-scale producers and their access to markets. Argentina will take the 
necessary steps to increase productivity through investment in basic rural infrastructure, such as 
roads, electricity distribution, and irrigation as well as the use of technology and the opening of 
new markets. Goals for upcoming years are 
included 
in 
the Programa Estratégico 
Agroalimentario y Agroindustrial 2016 (the Agri-food and Agribusiness Strategic Plan), 
including support for small farms. 

62. 
The Government is working toward its goal of sustaining the social security 
coverage attained after 2008. It expects to do so through instruments such as expanding 
pensions for the elderly and ensuring universal allowance for children and pregnant women 
(AUH). It plans to increase family transfers by 18 percent, bringing the number of beneficiaries 
to 4.5 million people. It will also provide new non-contributive pensions to 1.6 million people. 

63. 
The objectives for the education sector focus on increasing education quality and 
improving infrastructure at all levels. Through initiatives like ¨Our School¨ program, the 
Government expects to train 300,000 teachers. It also expects to construct more than 600 schools 
and new public universities across the country in 2014. Other goals are to increase the national 
coverage of pre-elementary and secondary schools, and to increase to 100 percent the reach of 
the “Conectar Igualdad” program, which provides netbooks to secondary public school students. 
Additionally, the PROG.R.ES.AR program has provided financial assistance to over one million 
young students to complete secondary and university education.  

64. 
Expanding medical coverage and preventing the spread of preventable diseases are 
the main objectives of the Government’s health policies. To expand medical coverage, the 
Government will enhance non-contributive insurance programs, such as Plan SUMAR, that 
provide free healthcare to an increasingly larger population without social health insurance, 
including children and pregnant women. To stop the propagation of preventable diseases such as 
dengue and Chagas disease, it has committed to eradicating inadequate housing units and 
increasing prevention within high-occurrence areas. At the same time, the Ministry of Health is 
collaborating with other ministries to develop a multisectoral policy framework to address the 
risk factors of the main chronic conditions and injuries, which currently constitute the main 
burden of disease of the Argentine population, especially among the poor.  

65. 
The issue of public safety has been one of the top priorities of the national 
government agenda. The Government expects to improve public safety by increasing the 
capacity of police forces, incorporating more law enforcement officers and providing them with 
improved equipment and technology. It expects to introduce 1,000 new officers and to provide 
scholarships and courses on various crime monitoring systems. Planned equipment purchases 
include security cameras, bulletproof vests, helicopters, and multiple forms of police vehicles. 

66. 
A unified environmental strategy is under discussion focusing on (a) urban issues and 
solid waste management; (b) a new federal environmental agreement that updates the role of 
COFEMA (Consejo Federal del Medio Ambiente) and 
identifies national priorities;  
(c) environmental management of energy, mining, oil, and gas; and (d) the transfer of funds from 
the federal to provincial governments in the context of the native forests law.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT 
67. 
The proposed WBG engagement with Argentina consists of a portfolio of financial, 
knowledge, and convening services focused on on promoting shared prosperity and 
reducing poverty. The CPS builds on lessons learned and outlines a new program that further 
expands the scope of collaboration among WBG organizations and other key development 
partners (e.g., Inter-American Development Bank-BID, Development Bank of Latin America - 
CAF) for each strategic objectives outcome, based on each organization’s comparative advantage 
and client demand (see Figure 18).  

68. 
At the same time, the CPS emphasizes selectivity and impact; to that end, it makes a 
number of shifts as to how, where, and in which areas the WBG will work. It also introduces 
cross-cutting program goals on transparency and accountability. The engagement will also share 
Argentina’s best practice experience globally in several areas, such as the results-based universal 
healthcare system and a unique road safety program.

Lessons Learned from the FY10-14 WBG Engagement and Stakeholder Feedback 

69. 
The FY10-12 CPS 29 supported the country during a period of global uncertainty 
following the 2008 global financial crisis. The country context was continuing weak access to 
financial markets following the 2001 debt default. The CPS provided strategic support in three 
key areas: (a) sustainable growth with equity, (b) social inclusion, and (c) improved governance. 
These areas remained relevant throughout FY10-14, although the CPS Progress Report 30 
included some adjustments to the results framework and program of activities in light of

implementation experience and some shifting priorities. No new CPS was discussed after FY12 
and no new lending was approved by the Board of Executive Directors. The lessons learned are 
based on the Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR), which also provides an 
overview of the continued WBG engagement through FY14. 31 During the FY10-12 CPS, IBRD 
committed $3.3 billion in 14 investment operations and IFC committed $730.7 million to clients 
in Argentina—$586 million from IFC’s own account and an additional $144.7 million mobilized 
from partners.  

70. 
The CPSCR identifies five key lessons that helped guide the design of the new 
strategy: (a) focusing on results while having flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and 
Government priorities was crucial for the achievement of development results; (b) integrating 
governance as a cross-cutting theme into the overall engagement was the most efficient strategy 
for achieving results; (c) ensuring the CPS results framework is tied to the activities under 
implementation and is consistent with activities proposed is essential; (d) strengthening dialogue 
with Government counterparts by focusing on areas where there is a mutual commitment to 
catalyzed innovation and strong results; and (e) maintaining a regular dialogue with Government 
counterparts and sharing implementation experiences helped improve portfolio performance.  

71. 
As noted, it is important to ensure that the CPS results framework is consistent with 
the proposed activities and the time period of implementation. Realistic and measureable 
results need to be tied to the activities already under implementation or expected to be delivered 
early in the CPS period. In a CPS of three years it is unrealistic to think that activities delivered 
after the first year or two will yield tangible results in the CPS period. This is especially true in 
Argentina, where long project effectiveness delays are frequent. 

72. 
As noted, it is important to focus on governance as a cross-cutting theme instead of 
as an independent pillar. Under the FY10-12 CPS and its predecessor, improving governance 
was treated as a pillar. Intended results were only partly achieved because specific activities 
sometimes did not materialize. Significant governance improvements were achieved by treating 
governance as a cross-cutting theme incorporated into project design, most notably in the Plan 
Nacer and CREMA roads projects.  

73. 
Regular dialogue with Government counterparts yielded positive results and lessons 
to improve portfolio performance. The main lessons in this respect include the need to  
(a) increase the presence of results-based financing 32 to replicate successful experiences in health 
and social protection; (b) avoid unnecessary project complexity and reduce coordination 
demands; (c) seek simplicity in design to avoid lengthy administrative processes; (d) recognize 
that additional financing requires the same processes as any new loan for the Government; (e) 
scale-up and formalize the use of mid-term reviews to address weaknesses in design and 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (f) simplify and reduce the number of indicators to better 
demonstrate results; and (g) provide sufficient transition time when changing Task Team Leaders 
(TTLs) and counterpart managers.  

31 The CPSCR is attached as Annex 2 of this document. 
32 Results-based financing links disbursement to results achieved/performance.

74. 
Results-based financing has a successful record of delivering services to 
beneficiaries, building human capital, and fostering employability. Setting targets and 
linking disbursement to results helps strengthens governance and accountability and contributes 
to developing a public sector culture that rewards performance. Results-oriented financing efforts 
have been successful for national programs (as in the case of health and employment support 
schemes) and provincial programs (as in the case of the health sector).  

75. 
Programmatic multi-year knowledge and advisory services are particularly effective 
instruments for evidence-based policy dialogue. Effective policy dialogue can be achieved by 
combining global analytical experience with first-class local research institutions and think-tanks 
and leveraging platforms for policy dialogue (e.g., on the subject of how population aging will 
impact the sustainability of Argentina’s welfare system). The Impact Evaluation of Plan NACER 
was a powerful instrument for policy dialogue not only in terms of final results but also in design 
and implementation. To be effective, impact evaluations require significant human and financial 
resources and stable partnerships between international specialists and local institutions. 

76. 
Input-based public sector support has had limited impact. Large projects with 
national scale have traditionally supported development of information technology- (IT-) based 
solutions to improve governance of the public sector. However, they have sometimes tended to 
suffer from limited focus and have not mobilized additional resources to introduce sustainable 
changes. Direct support to provincial governments focused on building capacity for public 
service delivery has shown a strong record of results through operations based on Disbursement-
Linked Indicators (DLIs) and through technical assistance for Rapid Assessment Action Plans 
(RAAPs).  

Stakeholder Consultations 

77. 
Engaging with Argentina’s civil society, key opinion leaders, prominent political 
figures and government counterparts was part of the consultation process which, together 
with the results of the FY12 client survey, contributed to shaping the country partnership 
strategy. The key areas of consultations included three main topics: (a) how to effectively reach 
the poor, through a program that is focusing new operations in the poorest provinces of the north 
east and north west of Argentina; (b) macro-economic perspectives that will impact the 
implementation of the CPS; and (c) how to advance a stronger gender agenda that promotes 
more women benefiting from the gains of inclusive growth (see Annex 12).  

78. 
Stakeholder consultations underscored poverty and equality of opportunities as top 
development priorities, along with improving macroeconomic stability, reducing poverty and 
expanding shared prosperity; enhancing the quality of infrastructure, transport, and logistics 
services; increasing productivity and competitiveness; strengthening public sector management 
and service delivery at both federal and provincial levels; increasing the quality of education; 
reducing disparities among provinces; improving the fiscal sustainability of social programs and 
their quality, coverage, and efficiency; and reducing environmental degradation and better 
managing climate change and disaster risk. Addressing gender inequalities was seen by 
representatives of civil society as a key factor to make further progress in reducing poverty and 
inequality, with a special focus on worker productivity and reduction in the gender wage gap. 

30 

 
79. 
For project implementation, flexibility and results-based approaches in program 
design were highlighted. Key points included simplifying and reducing results indicators, 
supporting fiduciary aspects, while keeping flexibility in project implementation and putting a 
special focus on reducing the complexity of WBG projects. The prevalent responses to WBG 
2012 Client survey attach higher value to the WBG’s financial services. In terms of knowledge, 
the Bank is recognized for its contributions to the following sectors: health, education, 
agriculture, climate change, economic growth, and poverty reduction. 

80. 
Feedback received on challenges to reaching the poorest provinces of the north, 
included suggestions to: (i) continue with the scheme of results-based financing to replicate 
successful experiences; (ii) support capacity building for public officials at the provincial level, 
specially the poorest ones; and (iii) focus on the simplicity of project design. 

B. 

Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy 

Overview, Strategic Objectives, and Results 

81. 
The World Bank Group CPS for FY15-18 supports the Government’s development 
objectives of protecting the recent social gains and expanding social inclusion in an efficient 
and environmentally sustainable manner, building on and expanding the successful innovations 
of the past. WBG engagement will be selective and directed to areas where there is scope for 
contributing to the WBG’s development objectives with the greatest possible impact. 

82. 
The CPS for FY15-18 is selectively built around nine World Bank Group (WBG) 
result areas, set within three broader themes: (a) Employment Creation in Firms and 
Farms; (b) Availability of Assets for People and Households; and (c) Reducing 
Environmental Risks and Safeguarding Natural Resources (Figure 19 depicts the mapping of 
the WBG result areas to the three themes.) The result areas were selected because they are 
important to achieving sustained poverty reduction and sharing of the gains of wealth creation—
the twin goals of the WBG; they reflect WBG expertise and lessons from past performance; they 
respond to expressed demand from our counterparts at the federal, provincial, and firm levels; 
and they are sectors and areas in which investments are meeting a favorable policy environment 
for sustained impact.  

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 19. Selective Engagement for Sustained Poverty Reduction and Equity 

83. 
The CPS details a select number of outcomes to be supported by the bundle of 
financial, knowledge, and advisory services from across the WBG. A more specific mapping 
of planned WBG activities for the FY15-16 period is provided in Annex 1. At a result-area level, 
this CPS specifies a select number of more aggregate results that could be attributed to WBG 
support to the country (see Table 2). See Annex 3 for the monitoring arrangements and data 
sources for the CPS outcome indicators. 

84. 
This CPS makes a number of gradual shifts as to how, where, and in which areas 
the WBG will work. Many of the instruments for both financing and policy support stem from 
the ongoing portfolio of 20 investment projects ($2.2. billion undisbursed), three GEF 
operations, 18 trust fund- (TF-) financed activities, and 11 knowledge and convening services. 
About half of the active project portfolio is scheduled to close by end-CY2015. This will provide 
a further opportunity, in consultation with the newly appointed government, to select new 
WBG’s activities to be aligned with the CPS results areas. Together with new financial 
engagement envisaged as well as our emphasis on knowledge, convening, and advisory services, 
this CPS aims to achieve the following shifts over the next four years: 

• The WBG will be phasing out its support over the CPS period (both financially as well as 
advisory services) with respect to road maintenance management, which was a mainstay 

32 

 
 
 
 
of past WBG programs) as the Government has mainstreamed the successful model at 
both the federal and provincial levels. Also, the CPS will not provide direct income 
support for the poor. Again, this has been a core part of the Bank program for almost two 
decades, in both crisis and non-crisis times, and the Bank has accompanied Argentina in 
broadening its income transfer schemes through workfare and universal child benefits 
that are now well established. 
• The CPS will scale-up support to raise the employability of young people through job-
oriented skill building, training, apprenticeships, and partnerships with firms as well as 
the contribution and financial support by IFC to the private sector. For IFC, this would 
be gradual, starting with the current client base but then expanding through new client 
engagements during the period of the CPS. 
• The program adapts the development approach with respect to urbanization (bringing the 
WBG’s logistics, urban transport, basic services, skill-building and governance 
interventions in lower-income communities and municipalities within a common 
framework, drawing upon ongoing experience in Colombia); environmental management 
(integrating individual activities in a structured program to systemically address the 
causes of environmental degradation); and public sector management and governance, 
moving from a focus on input-based IT systems toward engagement that provides 
incentives for service delivery for the poor and vulnerable population. 
• Regarding the results-focus, the CPS envisions an increase of financial services in 
relevant Global Practices (e.g., water, sanitation, and public sector management) that use 
results-based or output-based modalities (as has already taken place in the human 
development sectors). Further, the CPS shifts advisory and knowledge support into nine 
programmatic and multi-year engagements that support the overall CPS outcomes 
results. Lastly, the CPS will provide a special boost for impact evaluations (IEs), 
especially in the ‘asset availability of households and people’ theme with the target to 
increase the portfolio of ongoing and completed IEs by 50 percent over the CPS period. 
Wherever possible and appropriate, IEs would include gender disaggregated data. 
• As to the geographic focus of activities, IBRD project financing (through both federal as 
well as provincial lending) would increase the flow to the lowest-income provinces in the 
North plus low-income municipalities in the largest metropolitan areas. IFC will continue 
its focus on frontier regions. The WBG would continue to engage in Reimbursable 
Advisory Services, including in middle-or high-income provinces but seeking pairing 
arrangements with lower-income provinces or municipalities. 

85. 
The IBRD will use a cross-portfolio approach to governance. The WBG’s focus on 
governance will address the underlying issues that lead to implementation problems as well as 
problems with the delivery of public services. It will continue to help update regulations, develop 
institutional transparency, and improve capacity-building programs for public servants. Support 
will be provided to federal and provincial institutions on the development of the National 
Procurement Strategic Plan in order to strengthen country systems. The Bank is also engaged in 
dialogue and capacity building with the supreme audit institutions at the federal and provincial 
levels, and it will continue looking for similar engagement opportunities with other critical 
institutions. At the project level, the IBRD will continue to emphasize lending and supervision 
support to maximize results while managing fiduciary risks.  

33 

 
 
86. 
Specific targets for portfolio governance indicators have been defined. Across the 
portfolio, the CPS provides several governance indicators that include a full implementation of 
the open procurement initiative; the more frequent use of a concurrent, external auditor (who 
verifies the quantity and quality of service-delivery outputs); and an increase in the percentage of 
projects in the Argentina portfolio that are audited by the supreme audit institution at the federal 
or provincial level. Also, in line with the IBRD commitment on citizen engagement, with the 
Government the WBG will work toward ensuring that all newly financed programs contain 
citizen feedback and accountability mechanisms. 

87. 
The WBG will integrate gender into ongoing and forthcoming engagements. This 
includes soliciting gender community inputs at the design stage of new operations to ensure 
existing data gaps are identified and narrowed. Support will be provided to expand gender 
mainstreaming in projects, learning from good practices from within and outside the region and 
focusing on relevant gender issues in Impact Evaluations (see Annex 11). The youth employment 
policy of the Ministry of Labor, which is supported by the Bank, acknowledges the decline in 
labor participation of young women and has developed a strategy to address such issues. 
Whenever appropriate and feasible, the WBG will measure the gender impact of new operations 
by supporting gender disaggregated data collection at the subnational, local, and project levels, 
as for example, in the proposed Youth Employment project 33. 

88. 
The proposed CPS will span four years, In 2016, a mid-term learning and 
performance review will focus on the validity of the strategy and spell out any proposed 
adjustments. The CPS envisages $1.0 to $1.2 billion of new IBRD investment lending financing 
per fiscal year, while IFC would expect to commit about a total of $1.7 billion to support 
Argentina’s private sector assuming reasonably stable market conditions. MIGA will be 
considering requests for coverage for investments on a case-by-case basis.  

33 While many of the existing projects do not have gender-disaggregated indicators as part of their outcome level 
indicators, most of them do track valuable information by gender. The Bank will ensure this information is 
systematically collected, analyzed, and shared with stakeholders. See, for instance, the gender focus of an ongoing 
IE under the Norte Grande Infrastructure Project (see Annex 11).

Private, formal sector job 
creation and earnings increases 
contributed close to 70 percent 
of poverty reduction between 
2002 and 2013. Macro 
instability has historically been 
the most important factor in 
rising poverty. 
Half of the bottom 40 percent of 
income earners live within 40km 
of Buenos Aires (BA). 
Congestion, municipal 
governance, and lack of 
infrastructure hinder higher 
agglomeration economies. 
Production ($/ha) differentials 
are very high by geographical 
area as well as farm size. 

While limited in number, those 
still without electricity 
connection are the poorest and 
most excluded population group. 
In Norte Grande provinces, 17 
percent of the population lack 
access to safe drinking water 
and 59 percent lack improved 
sanitation services. 
Poorer and indigenous groups 
have much more limited access 
to health services, which impairs 
their health and limits abilities 
of families to rise out of poverty. 

IFC experience high; IBRD more 
limited in last 10 years but core for 
sustained employment creation. 

Reduction in cost of freight transport in selected 
corridors of Northern Argentina by 20 percent. 
IFC: Direct jobs supported through IFC clients rise 
from 56,000 to 61,000.  

Long-time engagement at 
provincial level, now shifting to 
more integrated urban 
development model. 

15 percent reduction in average transit time for 
bottom 40 percent in 2 metropolitan areas (Buenos 
Aires, Rosario). 

Long-term engagement to support 
agricultural development with 
increasing focus on small- and 
medium-size farms. 
Long-term engagement at 
provincial level, now moving to 
results-based financing. 

Increase the gross value of agricultural production 
($/ha) of 80,000 small- and medium-size farms by 12 
percent on average by 2018. 

365,000 people receive electricity service (out of 
725,000 without in 2010); access in the Norte Grande 
provinces to safe drinking water increases from 83 to 
92 percent and to sanitation from 41 to 55 percent. 

Systemic impact through 
comprehensive approach to sector, 
now moving to include non-
communicable diseases. 

Proportion of eligible people benefiting from effective 
healthcare rises from 28 percent (2014) to 50 percent 
(2018).

Reducing household 
exposure to environmental 
health hazards in Greater 
Buenos Aires. 

Improving natural forest 
cover in the Chaco Eco

Education access (in rural areas) 
and learning outcomes are 
heavily influenced by socio-
economic status. The school-to 
work transition and reinsertion 
into the labor market are crucial 
steps into the middle-class. 
Floods are a core risk for poor 
and vulnerable households to 
fall deeper into poverty. 

Poor urban households have a 
higher burden of environmental 
health problems. The total 
estimated population of the 14 
municipalities in the Province of 
Buenos Aires, Matanza-
Riachuelo Basin is 3.5 million, 
of which 1.2million are poor. 

Most of the remaining native 
forests are located in the 
northern provinces and are an 
important source of livelihood 
for the poor. 

Rural education focus from 
previous engagement; this CPS 
now also moving into school-to-
work transition and support for 
unemployed youth. 

Long-term engagement now 
shifting to a more integrated 
approach with disaster risk 
management (DRM). 
Engagement in large scale project, 
with systemic impact. 

Small-scale interventions will 
potentially leverage higher impact.  

Reducing

Secondary school completion rate in rural areas rises 
from 61.5 percent (2010) to 65.5 percent (2018); 
relative chance of labor market insertion rate for 
400,000 young people doubles. 

Flood risk protection reaches 2.3 million people in the 
three provinces (baseline 2014: 200,000 people). 

75 percent of sewage discharges from AySA Waste 
Water Treatment Plants, WWTP (Laferrere, El Jaguel, 
Sudoeste, Lanus, Fiorito) to Rio Matanza-Riachuelo 
will be treated according to a regional standard on 
water quality. Baseline is Zero.  

Increase in sewerage coverage from 33 percent to 72 
percent in the Province of Buenos Aires’ 14 
municipalities of the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin. 
Annual deforestation rate of natural forest in critical 
areas of Chaco, Salta, and Santiago de Estero 
(Category I or red according to the National Forest 
Law 26331) falls from 0.56 percent (Baseline 2011) 
to 0.28 percent. 

This would represent a 50 percent decline in 
deforestation in critical areas in targeted provinces.

SUSTAINING EMPLOYMENT CREATION IN FIRMS AND FARMS 

89. 
As presented in the country development challenges section, macroeconomic 
stability, 
the 
investment environment, urban 
infrastructure, and planning and 
competitiveness are among the key areas for enhancing Argentina’s long term growth. The 
WBG will initially focus on private investment and competitiveness, supporting agglomeration 
economies, and raising agriculture productivity among farmers on small plots. The objective will 
be to contribute to the protection of jobs during the economic slowdown and to the creation of 
more and better employment as growth accelerates. Within this broader objective the challenges 
are numerous. The choice of results areas is guided by client demand, existing dialogue, and 
WBG comparative advantages. Going forward, the flexible design of the program will allow for 
engagement in key areas such as macroeconomic and fiscal challenges and longer-term growth 
fundamentals, financial sector development, and trade. A core knowledge task for the Group will 
be to undertake an integrated analysis on growth drivers and poverty. The WBG will also 
develop a set of policy notes for the incoming Government (beginning calendar year 2016), 
which could include specific notes on strengthening the business environment, financial sector 
development, competitiveness, and trade and infrastructure logistics.  

WBG Results Area 1. Fostering private investment and strengthening its enabling 
environment 

CPS Outcome: Reduction in cost of freight transport in selected corridors of Northern Argentina 
by 20 percent; Direct jobs supported through IFC clients rise from 56,000 to 61,000. 

90. 
Supporting investments in logistics infrastructure is critical for the competitiveness 
of firms and farms. The challenges  are particularly acute in the export corridors and the 
lagging regions. The Norte Grande Road Infrastructure Project reduces bottlenecks to economic 
activity in the poorest provinces by building all-weather roads and reducing transport costs. 
Recent analysis shows that improved road quality yields a 28 percent reduction in freight 
transport costs per ton/km, providing a significant boost to competitiveness. Efforts to exploit the 
complementarities of the World Bank Group will be scaled up, with the IFC focusing 
investments in ports, roads, and barges; IBRD on ongoing investments in the roads sector, as 
well as analytical and advisory services; and MIGA on selected opportunities that present 
themselves. 

91. 
IFC will focus on providing renewed access to financing for existing and new clients 
combined with selective support for companies in a range of sectors. IFC will undertake 
deliberate and gradual engagement with existing and new clients to alleviate the lack of long-
term financing consequent upon the absence of access to international capital markets. Given the 
low growth projected for 2014-2015 IFC will focus on job preservation, switching to job 
generation as growth picks up in the second half of the CPS period. In addition, IFC will target 
Argentine companies with an outward focus, selectively financing investments for export-
oriented companies 
to help 
them gain production efficiencies, 
increase 
international 
competitiveness, and raise productivity. IFC will work with Argentine commercial banks and 
financial intermediaries to expand their reach and support domestic SMEs across different 
sectors, especially in poorer and remote provinces – complementing the Bank’s knowledge and 
financial services. Investment support in infrastructure and logistics—including transport, and oil 
and gas—will help boost productivity through reduced cost and enhanced reliability of essential 

37 

 
 
services. MIGA will be considering requests for investments coverage on a case-by-case basis. 
For example, it may potentially be involved in agribusiness, manufacturing, and services. 

92. 
Reliable energy services are core for the investment climate and for firms and farms 
to grow. IFC and IBRD interventions will complement each other in this sector for enhanced 
impact. IFC will support the energy sector in Argentina by exploring opportunities in the oil and 
gas sectors with companies that have strong fundamentals. With the resolution of the YPF 
nationalization, significant private investment in this sector will be essential to reducing 
dependence on imported fuel. Opportunities are emerging with current clients, and IFC has 
targeted new clients to support this industry. IFC’s social and environmental standards would 
aim to provide added value to clients in this sector, seeking to ensure improved management of 
natural resources. IBRD may complement IFC’s activities with technical assistance in key areas 
related to poverty and tariff policy, renewables, and extractive resource governance. 

WBG Results Area 2. Supporting agglomeration economies’ reach low-income areas  

CPS Outcome: 15 percent reduction in average transit time for bottom 40 percent of income 
earners in two metropolitan areas (Buenos Aires and Rosario) 

93. 
Cities present important opportunities to improve the livelihoods of urban residents. 
As the country urbanized rapidly, lack of planning for physical infrastructure, housing and 
amenities led to a mismatch in the demand for and provision of services, which manifested itself 
in proliferating slums. Well-functioning land, housing and job markets are a critical part of 
sustainable, equitable growth. Access to formal job markets may be inhibited by a lack of 
housing, limited access to transportation, and distance of housing to jobs, which in turn impacts 
commuting times and costs of transportation. Cities on sustainable pathways are able to take an 
integrated view at spatial development, by linking urban development 38 and public transit 
investments. Integrated land development and transit present opportunities to: (i) enhance a 
city’s economic competitiveness, as zoning and land use can be used to better connect workers to 
jobs; (ii) reduce local pollution, by promoting densification and mass transport thereby reducing 
congestion and pollution; and (iii) promote inclusive development, by coordinating low-income 
housing programs and transit development.  

94. 
A key element of this strategy is a focus on urban development linked to urban 
transportation. The Bank will leverage investments in Bus Rapid Transport to promote more 
sustainable land use patterns and urban development. The Metropolitan Areas Urban Transport 
Project maintains and improves the quality and sustainability of urban transport systems. This is 
critical for enabling lower income population segments to access urban services, employment 
opportunities, and commercial facilities. Complementary knowledge services provide insights 
into: (i) the implications of tariff increases on the poor; (ii) land value capture instruments; and 
(iii) a GEF grant pilots innovative less energy intensive transport options in cities. Together, this 
bundle of activities facilitates policy dialogue on integrated urban development and sustainable 
transport solutions.

WBG Results Area 3. Raising agricultural productivity of small- and medium-size farms in 
low-income regions 
CPS Outcome: Increase the gross value of agricultural production ($/ha) of 80,000 small- and 
medium-size farms by 12 percent on average by 2018 

95. 
The longstanding engagement in agriculture will continue with a narrower focus on 
the twin challenges of increasing the productivity of small- and medium-size farms and 
adapting to climate change. The first challenge is the duality of a sector characterized by a 
small number of large farms and a large number of small- and medium-size farms. The land 
endowment duality (75 percent of the 330,000 farms cultivate only 15 percent of the agricultural 
land) has translated over time into a difference in access to key factors of production. The second 
challenge is the specter of climate change, where emerging evidence points to the likelihood of 
more intense and frequent extreme weather patterns. More frequent heat stress above crop 
thresholds will likely reduce crop and livestock yields. 

96. 
Being one of two key areas of enhanced coordinated support, the Bank and IFC will 
make a joint effort in the provision of basic infrastructure and financing. Growth and 
productivity opportunities for those that own or till small- and medium-size farms in less well-off 
communities will be aided through financial support to investments in basic productive 
infrastructure (irrigation and drainage, rural roads, rural electricity, etc.) and rural institutions 
that provide access to credit and technical services. Redressing the historical imbalance in public 
investment for smaller farms will increase productivity and contribute to equitable growth. IFC 
aims to support smaller companies and projects through long-term loans at affordable rates 
distributed through its local commercial bank partners. It will also serve current agribusiness 
clients to ensure Argentina’s relevance as a global food producer. In addition, IFC aims to 
deploy a suite of short-term financial products, such as trade finance lines and warehouse 
financing tools, designed to primarily benefit small farms and SMEs. Explicit criteria that favor 
climate-smart agriculture will drive the allocation of IBRD resources.  

ASSET AVAILABILITY OF HOUSEHOLDS AND PEOPLE 

97. 
Argentina faces many short and medium term risks as discussed in the economic 
outlook section. Ensuring that poor and vulnerable households have the assets to cope with 
short- and medium-term risks requires strengthening public sector service delivery and 
investing in basic infrastructure and human development. The WBG will focus on 
strengthening public sector management and governance for public service delivery, increasing 
access to electricity, water, sanitation, and health services for the most vulnerable groups in the 
poorer provinces, and improving employability of youth. These results areas are selected on the 
basis of their impact on poverty and inequality, a successful record of results and innovation in 
performance-based operations, and evidence-based policy engagement and strong demand by the 
Government. Better public sector management and governance will create the enabling 
environment for improved service delivery. Obstacles created by public administrative processes 
reduce the quality and coverage of service delivery. The focus on removing these obstacles will 
contribute to expanded service coverage to the poor and excluded segments of the population, 
equalizing the access to education, health, water and sanitation, and other services by increasing 
public accountability and transparency. The experience of pilot programs will be combined with 
a sector-based service-delivery approach in the various Results Areas under this theme.  

39 

 
 
 
 
98. With regard to Bank support and previous engagements, there has been important 
work by the Government to strengthen implementation capacity and oversight in the 
health sector, for example. In other sectors, the Government has coordinated efforts across line 
ministries, including transport, health, and education as well as infrastructure and public 
contracting. Yet much remains to be done to enhance transparency in response to an ever-
demanding middle class and those who are often excluded from better, more responsive service 
delivery targeted to their needs. The advancements in participation and greater anti-corruption 
efforts will require working together to ensure their sustainability. This CPS offers an 
opportunity to re-engage with Argentina to strengthen governance, both at the federal and 
provincial levels, and it seeks to broaden the package of services, including further dialogue to 
strengthen transparency and accountability. 

WBG Results Area 4. Increasing access to electricity, safe drinking water, and sanitation 
services for the bottom 40 percent in low-income provinces and areas 
CPS Outcomes: 365,000 people receive electricity services (out of 725,000 without in 2010); 
access in the Norte Grande provinces to safe drinking water increases from 83 to 92 percent and 
to sanitation from 41 to 55 percent 

99. 
Access to basic infrastructure services such as electricity, potable water, and 
sanitation are critical for protecting and increasing human capital assets. Argentina’s 
electricity coverage is high. Therefore, people who still have no access are those who are poor 
and mostly indigenous, living in very remote and isolated rural areas. Those areas are difficult to 
be electrified by conventional technologies. Only 84 percent of Argentine households have a 
piped water supply, and only 53 percent have piped sewerage coverage (2010). The problem is 
particularly acute in the poorer areas of the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area and in the 
impoverished Northeast region. Wastewater treatment is limited, with only a 10 percent 
treatment ratio. As highlighted earlier, the poor often bear a disproportionally large share of the 
burden associated with inadequate sewage treatment. Many of the sector challenges are not 
caused only by the lack of infrastructure but are often a function of utility performance. 

100. 
 Ongoing and new operations will support the achievement of the ambitious CPS 
targets. Through ongoing projects, IBRD will continue to invest in the construction and 
rehabilitation of drinking water and sewerage treatment plants, construction and rehabilitation of 
sewerage collectors and distribution networks, and improvements in urban drainage systems. 
These efforts will focus on the poorer Northern provinces, where water and sanitation coverage 
is the lowest (as low as 71 percent for water and 19 percent for sanitation). The projects are 
expected to benefit more than 1 million people during the CPS period and help lower the Unmet 
Basic Needs (UBN) index. The water and sanitation program will shift away from traditional 
contracting approaches and toward financing for results to address more systemic issues 
associated with improving utility performance. A new financing engagement will provide the 
households that are not on the electricity grid (as well as the schools and health centers in their 
communities) with environmentally friendly off-grid sources of electricity. 

WBG Results Area 5. Achieving universal health coverage with focus on the nine poorest 
provinces 

40 

 
 
 
 
CPS Outcome: Proportion of eligible people benefiting from effective healthcare nationally 
increases from 28 percent (2014) to 50 percent (2018) 

101. The Bank will continue to support the Government’s strategy to strengthen the 
governance of the health system and to increase access to quality health services for the 
vulnerable groups. The emphasis will be on reaching vulnerable populations and reducing 
inequalities. During the past decade, the World Bank has supported the Government in its efforts 
to design and implement a comprehensive health system reform strategy, with the goals of 
increasing coverage of basic health services and strengthening the governance and results-
orientation of overall public spending. 39 Systemic sector change, results-based financing, 
performance agreements for intergovernmental transfer of funds, transparent accountability 
mechanisms, multi-sector interventions, and institutional development will continue to be the 
thrusts of the operational portfolio in health.  

102. New financial support under the proposed CPS will be focused on addressing the 
burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This requires innovative, multi-sector 
interventions across different levels of Government. Although the ongoing and planned national 
health programs supported by the World Bank have countrywide reach, they mostly benefit the 
least-advanced provinces in the North, where more people use only these services because they 
do not have formal employment and associated social security health insurance. 40 

103. The use of external, independent audits to verify the achievement of outcome and 
output targets will continue. Auditors that verify indicators linked to disbursement of Bank 
funds have been a key factor in strengthening governance and accountability in the ongoing 
operations and will continue to be used in the new CPS period. At the same time, a program of 
impact evaluations is underway that uses rigorous methods to generate evidence about the 
existing pay-for-results program for maternal and child health, and it will be expanded under the 
new CPS to include interventions addressing health needs of other population groups, such as 
youth and all women below age 65. The Bank will also work with the Government to share 
Argentina’s successful innovations in health service delivery with other countries. 

WBG Results Area 6. Improving employability of Argentina’s youth 
CPS Outcome: (i) secondary school completion rate in rural areas rises from 61.5 percent 
(2010) to 65.5 percent (2018); (ii) relative chance of labor market insertion rate for 400,000 
young people doubles 

104. The WBG will use its financial, knowledge and convening resources to support 
Argentina’s most vulnerable youth build skills for good employment outcomes. To 
contribute to the achievement of this objective, the WBG program will target the skill formation 

39 The implementation of Plan NACER—a public maternal and child health insurance program supported by the 
Bank from the plan’s inception in 2006—has been key to achieving these results. The expanded follow-up program 
–SUMAR – is also supported by the Bank. 
40 In 2010, for example, the proportion of people with neither social security health insurance nor private health 
insurance was 55.9 percent in Santiago del Estero, 57.9 percent in Chaco, and 56.9 percent in Formosa. By contrast, 
the vulnerable population was only 16.9 percent in Santa Cruz, 17.7 percent in the Autonomous City of Buenos 
Aires, and 21.5 percent in the Province of Tierra del Fuego. 

41 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
process in the formal education system in rural areas and the vocational and on-the-job training 
system for unemployed youth nationwide. The Bank will phase out its financial support to direct 
income transfer programs for the poor unless a dramatic and urgent need arises. 

105. Financial and analytical support will boost the quality of education in rural areas. 
With respect to strengthening the efficiency and equity of the formal education system, a 
necessary condition for the acquisition of more job-specific skills, a proposed operation aims to 
further reduce rural-urban disparities, with special emphasis on preschool enrollment, secondary 
school retention, and enhancing quality and learning outcomes in rural schools at all levels. The 
Second Rural Education Improvement Project would finance the National Rural Education Plan 
and would benefit especially poorer provinces in the North, where a higher proportion of 
students attend rural schools. 41 Analytical support to the National Ministry of Education and to 
selected provincial governments will ensure a platform for impact evaluation and comprehensive 
evidence-based policy dialogue. Furthermore, under the programmatic knowledge engagement 
under this pillar, the CPS would also provide support to lower-income provinces to strengthen 
management of education and health services.  

106. Boosting employability of Argentina’s young generation is a program target 
supported by a number of instruments. The proposed Youth Employment Project would 
expand the financing of competency-based training courses to disadvantaged adults in an effort 
to reduce unemployment and improve real wages. The Youth Employment Project will 
contribute to the Government’s goal of reducing youth unemployment, which has been declining 
less rapidly than total unemployment. 42 Through knowledge services, the Bank will support 
authorities’ efforts to develop better diagnostic tools and improve the effectiveness of policies 
implemented at the national and subnational levels to move toward an integrated and sustainable 
social protection system more broadly. IFC may also expand its adult and technical education 
portfolio by supporting private colleges that serve low- and middle-income students and will 
actively support clients that give priority to youth apprenticeship programs. Wider availability of 
skilled technical and mid-level staff is critical to raising private sector productivity. 

REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND SAFEGUARDING NATURAL 
RESOURCES 

107. Natural disasters and environmental degradation pose a major cost to the economy 
and the poor. The WBG will focus on key results in the areas of natural disasters, environmental 
degradation, and deforestation to help Argentina capitalize on its long-term growth prospects. As 
described earlier, there are many challenges to managing Argentina’s abundance of natural and 
environmental capital. The results build on a large and varied portfolio in this areas. The defining 
characteristic of this engagement going forward will be a more systemically structured approach 

41 For example, the proportion of students attending schools located in rural areas is 0 percent in the Autonomous 
City of Buenos Aires and 2.6 percent in the Province of Buenos Aires; it is as high as 19.7 percent in Formosa and 
22.4 percent in Catamarca. 
42 Among youth aged 16-24 years old, the unemployment rate was 16.5 percent in 2012, more than three times the 
unemployment rate of the population aged 25-64 years old (5.29 percent). More than half of the youth with a 
salaried job were employed in the informal sector, while the same indicator was below 30 percent for the population 
aged 25 to 64.  

42 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
building on analytical work analyzing the costs of natural disasters and environmental 
degradation. 

WBG Results Area 7. Reducing exposure to extreme flooding in Chaco, Corrientes, and 
Buenos Aires 
CPS Outcome: Flood risk protection reaches 2.3 million people in the three provinces (baseline 
2014: 200,000 people). 

108. Argentina is particularly prone to natural disasters and extreme weather events. A 
2014 IPCC assessment suggested the problem may be getting worse in the Parana and Paraguay 
River basins as runoff increases. Recent estimations show that flash floods dominate in terms of 
damages, with the computed expected annual value of flood cost of about $3.4 billion or 0.7 
percent of GDP in 2012. Recurring flooding in the city of Buenos Aires, which is home to 3 
million people and has more than 2 million commuters, can be particularly damaging to the 
economy. Flooding of the La Plata River that occurred in April 2013 had a death toll that reached 
51 persons and there were more than 1,500 evacuees; damage was estimated at $500 million. In 
the Buenos Aires area, annual rainfall and runoff have increased significantly in recent decades. 
Between 1990 and 1998, 24 notable floods occurred, affecting neighborhoods at different income 
levels. 

109. Expanding flood protection is a core program result. The World Bank has a 
longstanding engagement with Argentina to improve resilience, with an emphasis on 
infrastructure that reduces the hazard for people living in and transiting through flood-prone 
areas. Ongoing work concentrated on two of the lowest-income provinces (Chaco and 
Corrientes) in the Parana basin will improve resilience for about 400,000 people, and new 
engagement promises to improve resilience in the city of Buenos Aires. Going forward, efforts 
will be made to shift to a systemic results-based approach that improves institutional outcomes 
related to flood planning, risk management, fiscal risk transfer, and emergency services.  

WBG Results Area 8. Reducing household exposure to environmental health hazards in 
greater Buenos Aires 
CPS Outcomes: (i) 75 percent of sewage discharges from AySA Waste Water Treatment Plants, 
WWTP (Laferrere, El Jaguel, Sudoeste, Lanus, Fiorito) to Rio Matanza-Riachuelo will be 
treated according to a regional standard on water quality. Baseline is zero; (ii) increase in 
sewerage coverage from 33 percent to 72 percent in the Province of Buenos Aires’ 14 
municipalities of the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin 

110. The WBG is a long-standing partner of Argentina in the design and implementation 
of innovative strategies to address legacy industrial pollution. The poor are most exposed to 
and least able to bear the costs of the long-term health challenges created by legacy industrial 
pollution. For example, the World Bank supports the Government’s program for the 
comprehensive clean-up of the Matanza-Riachuelo basin. In this case, the industrial sector is 
responsible for about 50 percent of the organic and heavy metals discharges. An estimated 
15,000 industries actively release effluent into basin, and a 2008 study found that soil on the 
banks of the river contained above recommended levels of zinc, lead, copper, nickel, and 
chromium. About 60 percent of the largely 20,000 poor people who reside near the river basin 

43 

 
 
 
 
have higher levels of diarrheal diseases, respiratory illnesses, and possibly cancer. A second 
example is the PRAMU project, which reduces potential economic and health damages 
associated with a closed uranium mining site in Mendoza and more generally strengthens the 
Government’s capacity to assess and mitigate environmental work risks associated with closed 
uranium mines and processing sites. The IBRD support for this area will rely less on ad-hoc 
grants and focus more on systemic interventions that comprehensively address the sources of 
pollution and the associated remediation framework.  

WBG Results Area 9. Improving natural forest cover in the Chaco Eco-Region 

CPS Outcome: The annual deforestation rate of natural forests in the critical areas of Chaco, 
Salta, and Santiago de Estero (Category I or red according to the National Forest Law 26331) 
falls from 0.56 percent (Baseline 2011) to 0.28 percent.  

111. A large share of Argentina’s forest cover is in various stages of degradation. 
Approximately 11 percent of Argentina’s continental territory is covered with natural forest, 
totaling approximately 31.4 million hectares. Two-thirds of this is situated in the Chaco Eco-
Region (21.7 million ha), of which 60 percent is in various stages of degradation. Weak 
institutions, limited development opportunities, and a fragile ecosystem are exacerbating the 
problem. Between 2006 and 2011, more than 1.5 million ha of natural forest were destroyed (a 
deforestation rate of 1.5 percent, including critical and non-critical areas). As a result, the 
outward migration of forest-dependent communities has accelerated, biodiversity has been lost, 
soil and water resources have been degraded, and carbon emissions have increased.  

112. For the last decade, the World Bank and other donors have been supporting the 
legal, institutional, and financial framework for the protection of natural forest. The Forest 
Fund has the potential to provide significant public resources to the provinces to promote 
sustainable use of natural forests and to effect payments for environmental services. Future 
engagements are focused on assisting the Government in piloting development models that can 
later be financed through the Fund. This includes working with the owners of smaller forest plots 
and forest-dependent communities (which are mainly of indigenous and criollo origin, of whom 
70 percent live in poverty).  

C. 

Portfolio and Implementing the FY15-18 Country Partnership Strategy 

113. Portfolio Management. Total current IBRD exposure to Argentina is $5.89 billion, with 
disbursements totaling $701.2 million in FY14. The active portfolio consists of 20 IBRD 
investment projects for a total commitment of $4.87 billion—$2.22 billion remains undisbursed 
(see Table 3). The Bank also manages a portfolio of 18 trust funds (three GEF projects) for a 
total of $68 million—$28.4 million remains undisbursed. Portfolio performance is satisfactory. 
After weakening to 17.9 percent in FY12, the portfolio’s disbursement ratio rebounded to 24.7 
percent in FY13; for FY14, the rate was 24.3 percent. Eighty percent of projects are rated in the 
satisfactory range for both Development Objective and Implementation Progress. Since 2010, 
IEG has evaluated 10 projects, with 8 rated “satisfactory” and 2 “moderately satisfactory.”

IV. MANAGING RISKS  
The outcomes targeted by this CPS are subject to various economic and political risks as well as 
risks related to the program implementation. 

45 

 
 
 
 
115. Economic Risks. On July 31, 2014, Argentina’s credit rating on its foreign currency debt 
was downgraded to ‘selective default’ by several credit rating agencies  following the expiry of 
the thirty-day grace period for the June 30 interest payment on the “exchange bonds” regulated 
by New York and UK law. The International Swaps & Derivatives Association’s determinations 
committee ruled on August 1, 2014 that the failure to pay interest would trigger $1 billion of 
credit-default swaps insurance on Argentina’s debt. These developments pose additional 
challenges for Argentina. Argentina had deposited $539 million to the Bank of New York 
Mellon (BoNY), the Indenture Trustee– before the payment due date but the payment could not 
be transferred to the recipient bondholders as the Court ruling binds also the payment system 
intermediaries. If the situation remains unresolved for too long, Argentina’s economy could 
suffer, especially if macro policies do not adjust. However, the Argentine Government has 
repeatedly argued that it has the capacity and willingness to continue paying the exchange 
bondholders. The Government also argues that it is not in default since it has paid exchange 
bondholders but that the transfer was impeded by the Court order. If an agreement with the 
holdout creditors is reached in a relatively short time period, the impact on the economy would 
be limited. The economic prospect would also be supported by Argentina’s recent steps toward 
settling pending international disputes, including the first payment to Paris Club creditors in July, 
2014, settling five ICSID cases, and reaching an agreement with Repsol over the nationalization 
of YPF. In addition, the Government has released new consumer price indices and GDP series, 
the robustness of which will be evaluated by the IMF. These efforts may improve consumer and 
investor confidence in the Argentine economy and facilitate new foreign investment.. 

116. 
International reserve losses, fiscal deficit, and persistent inflation as well as 
uncertainty in the global economy pose challenges over the medium term. Argentina’s fiscal 
and external accounts are likely to continue posting deficits in the coming years, with the risk of 
rising inflationary pressures and weakening resilience to shocks. GDP growth is likely to remain 
sluggish, which could potentially reduce support for overall government policies through its 
effect on employment. Uncertainty in the global economy could create further downside risks to 
demand for Argentine products. Brazil, China, and the Euro area are Argentina’s main trading 
partners, accounting for about 42 percent of total exports in 2013. Argentina is particularly 
exposed to commodity price swings and droughts. Agricultural and agribusiness exports make up 
the lion’s share of Argentina’s total merchandise exports (about 60 percent in 2013) and export 
taxes are important fiscal resources (about 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013). Moreover, uncertainties 
about the regulatory and business environment could potentially limit access to finance, 
discourage foreign investors, and adversely affect economic outcomes. The Government is aware 
of the risks and the recently adopted policies—including the exchange rate depreciation, 
tightening of monetary policy and reduction of gas and water subsidies—suggest the 
Government’s willingness to control macroeconomic imbalances.  

117. Political Risks. Although the Government retains a majority in both chambers of the 
Congress, political parties may still create opposition to government policies. Also the 
Presidential elections in October 2015 may lead to changes in government priorities. However, 
the WBG program is focused in areas where there is wide consensus across the political 
spectrum. The CPS performance and learning review, which would fall into after-elections 
period, would give the WBG and the incoming Government an opportunity to revisit priorities 
and reflect changes to the CPS program as needed.  

46 

 
 
 
 
118. Portfolio Implementation Risks. Despite the significant efforts from both national and 
subnational Governments and the WBG, it is likely that project implementation issues will arise, 
including project effectiveness delays, challenges in retaining highly-skilled staff in the PIUs, 
and complex fiduciary and procurement arrangements. The expanded engagement at the 
provincial level may also require additional capacity building at the local level, where lags 
persist. The WBG will continue regular portfolio reviews and joint implementation workshops to 
address bottlenecks and provide solutions. In addition, the WBG will focus on the simplicity of 
project design, increasingly linking financial flows directly to results.

I. Introduction 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) is a self-evaluation by 
the World Bank Group (WBG) team of its performance in implementing the FY10-12 Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS), measured against the CPS results framework 43. While no new CPS 
was discussed after FY12 and no new projects were approved, this CPSCR also captures WBG 
activities from FY13-14 to present a comprehensive picture of the continued engagement in 
Argentina. The Argentina FY10-12 CPS 44 was the second full strategy since Argentina 
commenced the shift from recovery to sustained growth in the wake of the economic and social 
crisis of 2001-02. The CPS aimed to support the country in the aftermath of the 2008 global 
financial crisis, a period of worldwide uncertainty and, for Argentina, limited access to financial 
markets following the 2001 debt default. The CPS provided strategic support in three key areas: 
(a) sustainable growth with equity, (b) social inclusion, and (c) improved governance. These 
three pillars remained relevant throughout FY10-14, although the CPS Progress Report 45 
included some adjustments to the results framework and program of activities in light of 
implementation experience and shifting circumstances. With respect to financial services during 
FY10-12 CPS, the Bank committed $3.3 billion 46 in 14 investment operations. The International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) committed $730.7 million to clients in Argentina—$586 million from 
IFC’s own account and an additional $144.7 million mobilized from partners—to benefit 23 
client companies and banks, more than 30,000 farmers, and 38,000 small and medium-size 
enterprises (SMEs). 

2. 
CPS Pillar Results. One third of the outcomes envisioned in the CPS were achieved, 
most notably for the Sustainable Growth with Equity and Social Inclusion pillars, which account 
for the larger share of World Bank Group (WBG) engagement in Argentina. About two thirds of 
the outcomes were partially achieved. Some important outcomes achieved during FY12-14 were 
the result of sustained, long-term engagement in specific sectors, such as infrastructure, social 
protection, and health, where WBG engagements are well-integrated and leverage broad-based 
Government programs.  

3. WBG Flexibility. The WBG provided flexible support to the Government, responding to 
its evolving needs. Fourteen lending operations were delivered; six of these were not originally 
envisioned in the CPS. The Bank provided consistent implementation support to the existing 
portfolio, which included 38 active operations as of June 2012. In response to emerging needs of 
the large and complex portfolio, the Bank increased on-the-ground presence and capacity-
building activities, especially in fiduciary areas. In addition to the substantial knowledge-sharing 
agenda embedded in project preparation and supervision, substantial knowledge services were 
provided in areas, such as logistics, productivity, and human development. By June 2014, the 

43 The team assessed the WBG program performance against the objectives as they were laid out in the CPS and 
CPS Progress Report results frameworks.

active portfolio consisted of 20 IBRD investment projects ($2.2 billion undisbursed), 3 GEF 
operations, and 18 trust-funded activities. Overall WBG program and WBG performance 
during the CPS period are rated as fair. 

II. Progress toward Long-Term Development Outcomes in Argentina 

4. 
Argentina continued to reduce poverty and expand shared prosperity. Poverty measured 
at $4-a-day declined from 17.2 percent in 2008 to 10.8 percent in 2012, while poverty measured 
at $2.50-a-day fell from 8.2 percent to 4.7 percent during the same period. 47 Similarly, Argentina 
continued to improve the population’s assets base and human development outcomes. Access to 
basic services improved and so did educational and health outcomes, although at different paces 
in each sector. Important gaps, however, remain and outcomes differ considerably across 
provinces. In addition, the sustainability of the Government’s inclusive policies came under 
pressure, especially during FY12-14, as economic growth slowed down and the fiscal space 
shrank because of rapidly increasing public spending, particularly on social policies and 
transport and energy subsidies.   

5. 
Infrastructure Improvements. The condition of the national and provincial roads 
system has been improved through WBG-supported programs, reducing costs and boosting 
transport reliability and capacity. In addition, urban transport systems have been strengthened, 
and road safety has been enhanced. Rural electricity capacity is also being expanded, and 
agricultural production has increased. A number of projects under implementation contribute to 
addressing the problem of resource degradation. The Matanza-Riachuelo urban river basin 
project (the largest project in the portfolio) experienced significant implementation delays and 
relevant contracts were only signed in early 2014. Construction works are expected to start later 
in 2014.  

6. 
Social Inclusion Gains. As a result of programs to which the Bank contributed, more 
than 3.6 million children now benefit from an allowance for vulnerable children, and more than 
339,000 workers have received skill-improvement and competency-based training. Health gains 
made under several Government initiatives and Bank projects have been consolidated, while 
continued support will be provided to deepen and ensure the sustainability of reforms. There has 
also been progress toward the goal of reducing disparity in educational attainment between rural 
and urban areas, with rural areas showing increased school promotion rates (i.e., more children 
advancing to next grade).  

7. 
Institutional Strengthening. Bank engagements have contributed to the strengthening of 
a number of key Government systems at the national level, notably the Social Security 
Administration (ANSES). The Bank has also supported implementation of a coordinated data 
system (SINTyS), which is shared by all social protection and safety net agencies in Argentina. 
A number of national agencies have implemented the Citizens’ Charter 48, and surveys show that 

47 Poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity indicators are calculated using harmonized household surveys from 
SEDLAC: Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEDLAS and World Bank). 
48 The Citizens' Charter Program (Programa Carta Compromiso con el Ciudadano), which has existed for more than 
ten years, is a program through which public agencies with direct obligations to provide citizen services 

55 

 
 
 
                                                           
 
this has led to an increase in user satisfaction of more than 70 percent. At the subnational level, 
Bank engagements have supported improvements in service delivery, and systems have been 
implemented that will enable better management of personnel information.  

III. Program Performance  

8.  
This Completion Report focuses on the intended results and milestones as presented and 
updated in the CPS Progress Report of February 2011. One third of the outcomes envisioned in 
the CPS were achieved, and about two thirds of the outcomes were partially achieved under all 
three pillars; however, a distinction should be noted between CPS outcomes that had a broad 
systemic impact and those where the scope of impact was more limited (e.g., to a project, sector, 
or province). For instance, some social and human development programs (lending and 
analytical and advisory activities) have been successful with nationwide impact (e.g., Plan 
NACER) while others were implemented at the provincial level and therefore have had a more 
localized impact (e.g., support to improve public sector management in Cordoba and Chaco 
Provinces). The growing macroeconomic imbalances and increasing policy uncertainties also 
created some challenges for program implementation especially during FY12-14. Overall 
program performance is rated as fair. 

Pillar 1. Sustainable Growth with Equity 

9. 
To promote sustainable growth with equity, WBG support during the CPS period focused 
on activities to (a) upgrade Argentina’s infrastructure to improve livelihoods, address potential 
bottlenecks to competiveness, and underpin medium-term growth and poverty alleviation;  
(b) improve competiveness, quality, and exports in agriculture and livestock production; and  
(c) address a growing problem of resource degradation. Emphasis was placed on leveraging 
broader country programs and building capacity beyond the immediate project needs at the 
national as well as subnational levels. IFC’s engagement with Argentina fell primarily under this 
pillar, focusing on financing resilient companies in strong sectors that can create jobs, meet the 
needs of the poor, and support the country’s long-term growth. Given the structure of 
Argentina’s markets, IFC concentrated its investments in financial institutions and extractive 
industries, which together received 86 percent of its $586 million in total IFC commitments since 
FY10. Several analytical pieces were critical in supporting this investment: the Provincial 
Economic Memorandum for Buenos Aires analyzed the economic prospects, issues, and 
challenges for sustainable growth of the province. The Opportunity Assessment of Chaco 
generated a baseline based on the Human Opportunity Index of social conditions and has been 
followed by Rapid Assessments and Actions Plans (RAAPs) in other provinces. A series of 
policy notes were instrumental in the policy dialogue with the new Government following the 
2011 elections. 

10. 
Roads Improvement. During the CPS period, a major focus of infrastructure work has 
been improving the national and some provincial highways. The CPS target of having more than 
90 percent of non-concessioned paved national roads in good or fair condition has been 

communicate information about their functioning (e.g. objectives, how to access services, citizens' rights and 
responsibilities, etc.) and commit to goals in improving such services (e.g. response time). 

56 

 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
achieved, with 98 percent in good or fair condition. These results were achieved through 
outcome-based contracts 
for 
rehabilitation and maintenance 
(CREMA—Contrato de 
Recuperación y Mantenimiento). The CREMA system is also in place in six provinces, and the 
successful model is now being used in Brazil and Peru.  

11. 
Road Safety. Argentina has become a global leader in the area of road safety. The 
Road Safety Project has successfully achieved the CPS targets and contributed to the 
strengthening of Argentina’s institutional framework and management capacity for reducing 
road-related deaths and injuries. Road fatalities fell 43.2 percent—from a high of 3.7 per 10,000 
registered motor vehicles in 2008 to 2.1 in 2013. Between 2011 and 2013, the average use of seat 
belts increased by 14 percent and helmets by 37 percent, while the number of positive tests for 
driving under the influence of alcohol declined by 40 percentage points. Since the project’s 
approval in 2010, it has also contributed to the establishment of a national driver’s license 
registry in 20 of 24 provinces and the creation of information monitoring systems, such as the 
National Road Safety Observatory, that foster results-based management of road safety issues 
and provides active South-South Knowledge Exchanges with other countries. 

12. 
Port Infrastructure. IFC has played an important role in upgrading the country’s port 
infrastructure by working with private-sector partners. Buenos Aires, Argentina’s principal port, 
suffers from growing congestion. Port operators are investing to increase efficiency and capacity 
at terminals in and around the city as well as at provincial ports. IFC invested $11.1 million in 
two private terminals in Buenos Aires, complementing earlier port investments.  

13. 
Urban Transport. The CPS included significant Bank-financed investments aimed at 
sustainably improving the quality of urban transportation systems in Argentina’s metropolitan 
areas. Investments under the Urban Transport in Metropolitan Areas (PTUMA) and Buenos 
Aires Urban Transport (PTUBA) operations are yielding important results. Enhanced decision-
making tools are in place in several provinces and metropolitan areas, including surveys, 
transport models, and strategic plans to ensure that the eventual investments are part of a larger 
strategic framework. The PTUBA Project, which closed during the CPS period, has produced 
information that will enable Buenos Aires to better manage transportation planning. Moreover, 
the technical element of the project management unit was transformed into a formal planning and 
management agency, which is now the Government’s primary support for transportation issues 
in the country. In addition, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Sustainable Transport and Air 
Quality operation has helped ensure priority status for projects with a lower carbon-footprint and 
lesser impact on climate change. 
14. 
 Flood Risk Management and Urban Drainage. The Bank and Argentina have long 
been working together on flood risk management, with concrete results. During the CPS period, 
two projects were implemented. One focused on the City of Buenos Aires (Maldonado Basin) 
and closed, directly benefiting 325,000 people. The second project is focused on the provinces 
affected by floods from the Parana River. This project will close in 2014 and benefit 395,000 
people, including 207 resettled families. 
15. Greater Rural Electricity Access. The Renewable Energy in Rural Markets Project 
(PERMER), which received additional financing in 2008 and closed in 2012, improved access to 
electricity services in rural and remote areas through renewable sources, including solar and 

57 

 
 
wind power. As a result of project interventions, more than 25,000 poor rural households and 
almost 1,900 schools now have access to electricity. The GEF Energy Efficiency Project also 
became effective early in this CPS and has contributed to increased use of compact fluorescent 
lamps (CFLs); 24.5 million CFLs were purchased with counterpart funds, liberating project 
funds for other uses.  

16. 
Improved Water and Sanitation. The Province of Buenos Aires and the Bank have had 
a close partnership in this area throughout the CPS period. Through the Provincial Infrastructure 
Adaptable Lending Program (APL-1 and APL-2), as well as additional financing for the first 
phase of the program, water and sewage coverage for poor residents has been greatly increased 
in selected parts of Buenos Aires Province. Similarly, the Basic Municipal Services Project has 
invested in water and sewerage infrastructure benefiting municipalities in the provinces of 
Santiago del Estero, Tucumán, Neuquén, and Santa Fe. Work is expected to be completed by 
March 2015. In addition, the initial major work under the First Norte Grande Water 
Infrastructure Project has begun—a drinking-water treatment plant and aqueducts to provide 
potable water to 48,000 people in Chaco Province. The Second Norte Grande Water Project is 
well advanced, with bidding processes underway for a waste-water treatment plant in Chaco, 
expected to benefit 430,000 people with improved sanitation services.  

17. 
Enhanced Environmental Outcomes. The CPS has supported Government efforts to 
address resource degradation and pollution management, and it has concurrently helped build 
institutional capacity to promote environmentally sustainable development. The Solid Waste 
Management Project, approved in FY06, has addressed the issue of resource degradation that 
arises from poor management and disposal of solid waste. Thirteen provincial and municipal 
waste management plans have been completed, exceeding the CPS target. Sanitary landfills and 
solid waste recovery plants have been built in the cities of Rosario and Mar del Plata, and 
Rosario was equipped with trash containers. The construction of the additional landfill in 
Mendoza is expected to be completed during the next CPS.  

18. 
Natural Resource Protection. The Sustainable National Resources Management Project 
and a GEF operation supporting the conservation of biodiversity 49 have contributed to the 
establishment of monitoring units for forest and deforestation assessments. The projects have 
also contributed to building critical infrastructure for protecting national parks. Another GEF 
operation 50 has developed and promoted biodiversity conservation. Finally, an additional 1,140 
tons of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) were eliminated under the Montreal Protocol 
Operation, including a project amendment to phase out CFCs in production of metered-dose 
inhalers, a new industrial sector addressed by the project.  

19. 
River Basin Clean-Up. The Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin Clean-Up Project faced 
significant delays arising from its complexity and high profile. After overcoming those 
challenges, the first contracts were signed in FY14. When completed, the project will directly 
benefit 2.1 million people with expanded sanitation services and 5.7 million people through 
protection of water intake facilities. Although it is too early to measure results, it is noteworthy

that the River Basin Authority (ACUMAR) is fully operational and construction is expected to 
begin soon.  

20. 
Increased Agricultural Productivity and Poverty Alleviation. The WBG continued to 
provide support to Argentina’s agricultural sector through a two-track approach targeting  
(a) medium-sized agricultural producers 
that have 
ready access 
to markets; and  
(b) subsistence farmers for whom agriculture is often not a full-time activity. Under the first 
track, support was primarily delivered through a series of two provincial agricultural 
development projects: PROSAP I and II. These operations provided infrastructure investments in 
18 provinces and resulted in a substantial increase in land under cultivation as well as improved 
yields. Complementing these operations, the IFC financed citrus producer San Miguel, based in 
the frontier province of Tucuman, with $5 million in direct financing and an additional $19.7 
million from investment partners. The company employs more than 1,000 workers, half of them 
women. 

21. 
Further Support to Small and Subsistence Farmers. Additional financing was 
provided to the Small Farmer Development Project (PROINDER), which closed during the CPS 
period. Support was provided to 73,953 beneficiaries and 10,736 agrifood subprojects. Although 
the initial project was primarily aimed at improving the quality of life for subsistence farmers, 
the additional financing broadened the scope to improve market access for small-scale farmers. 
This included building alliances with distributors and ensuring that produce met quality 
standards.  

22. 
IFC Support to Small and Medium-Size Enterprises and Small Farms. IFC 
committed $392 million to Argentine banks in FY10-12. These investments had two objectives. 
First, by supplying liquidity (usually to smaller banks) through its short-term finance facilities, 
IFC helps banks support small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that face difficulties 
borrowing at reasonable rates from larger banks. IFC channeled $317 million to eight, mostly 
second-tier, banks through its Global Trade Finance program. Second, by providing term 
financing for banks, IFC is able to indirectly support large numbers of SMEs, small farms, and 
low-income groups. For instance, through its relationship with Banco Galicia, IFC was able to 
reach more than 2,500 SMEs in CY11. In FY10-12, IFC provided $75 million in term financing 
to three financial institutions through several innovative investments. IFC committed $20 million 
to Banco Galicia, a leading local bank, to finance sustainable farming practices; this is expected 
to benefit more than 1,000 farms, most of them in remote provinces. IFC committed an 
additional $25 million to support Buenos Aires-based DARP SFP, a distressed asset firm. SFP 
aims to originate and restructure $500 million in non-performing loans in Argentina and other 
Latin American countries between 2010 and 2015. This enables participating lenders to 
strengthen their balance sheets and increase their lending capacity. Borrowers benefit by 
reducing their debt burdens, aligning service payments with their ability to pay, and reducing the 
possibility of losing pledged collateral—often their homes. 

23. 
IFC and Extractive Enterprises. IFC provided $236.7 million to five oil, gas, and 
mining projects. They are located in remote provinces, create jobs, and generate substantial 
revenues for local governments. PAE, a local oil company that benefited from one investment, 
made $2.2 billion in government payments in 2011 alone. In addition to providing critical long-
term financing for these projects, IFC’s performance standards mitigated environmental impacts, 

59 

 
 
while its A/B loan program mobilized an additional $125 million from investment partners for 
the extractive industry.  

24. 
Enhancing Exports. The WBG supported export diversification and value added in 
production. The Argentina Unleashing Productive Innovation Project seeks to expand 
Argentina’s capacity to generate productive innovation in knowledge-based areas. Many of the 
project’s activities relate to translating innovative knowledge into applications with high social 
and economic impact. The project has contributed to the creation of “deal flow facilitators” to 
support the incubation cycle of new technology enterprises, while committing significant 
resources to fostering public-private collaboration to help steer the research agenda toward 
projects with greater potential to transform the productive sector. The project has supported 
development of programs to provide graduate degrees in technology management, a key skill 
needed to promote commercialization of research ideas. In addition, IFC continues its support for 
emerging technology companies that are able to draw on—and nurture—the country’s strong 
human capital base. IFC invested $10 million in TIBA, Latin America’s leading provider of 
services to the broadcasting industry, and $5 million in Grupo ASSA, a small regional 
information technology services provider. These build on previous investments aimed at 
bolstering the country’s emerging software and technology sector. 

25. 
IFC and the Manufacturing Sector. Some elements of Argentina’s manufacturing 
sector have shown remarkable resilience in the face of internal and external challenges. IFC’s 
investments helped safeguard or expand employment, including at companies operating in 
remote areas of the country. IFC committed $50 million in loans to three industrial companies, 
which together employ almost 2,000 workers. These clients have demonstrated strong 
management and financial performance. IFC commitments to Turkey’s Kordsa ($15 million) and 
FV Argentina ($10 million) helped these companies diversify their businesses through increased 
South-South integration. Kordsa improved integration of its tire operations in Brazil and 
Argentina. FV Argentina is establishing itself as the Southern Cone’s leading metal fixture 
supplier. IFC’s $25 million financing for Aluar, an aluminum producer, enabled the company to 
increase production, raise annual exports from $600 million to $710 million, and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. Lower emissions enable it to issue certified emission reduction credits 
under the UNFCC’s Clean Development Mechanism. 

Pillar 2. Social Inclusion 

26. 
To promote social inclusion, the FY10-12 CPS focused on: (a) improving the country’s 
social safety nets and fostering employment; (b) improving health outcomes; and (c) improving 
education outcomes. 

27. 
Safety Nets and Employment. Supported by a dialogue with Government counterparts, 
the transition from crisis response to a more permanent social protection system continued 
during the CPS period. Building on knowledge gained under the previous CPS, the Basic 
Protection Project became effective at the beginning of the FY10-12 CPS and received additional 
financing in September 2011; the Universal Child Allowance it supports is already covering 
more than 3.7 million poor children, or more than 80 percent of the eligible population. 

60 

 
 
 
Collaboration between ANSES and the Ministry of Health was crucial to achieving these results 
because the Plan Nacer 51 beneficiary database served as a basis for the Universal Child 
Allowance. Through the Life-Long Learning Project, the Bank continued to support the 
Government’s objective of integrating marginalized groups into the productive marketplace, with 
more than 339,000 participants receiving training. Engagement with the productive sectors has 
been maintained throughout the CPS period, resulting in the establishment of a competency-
based qualifications and certification system. This will contribute to faster economic growth as 
well as higher productivity. Workers continue to build their skills, and the quality of training 
institutions is improving. However, challenges remain: the adult education system has been slow 
to respond to the needs of adult learners and suffers from a lack of focus on results and poor 
information management. 

28. 
Improved Health Outcomes. The Bank has continued to work closely with Government 
counterparts toward the goal of reducing infant and maternal mortality. Strong outcomes 
continued to be delivered by the Plan Nacer Project, which received an Independent Evaluation 
Group (IEG) award for exemplary design and innovation in October 2011. Almost 2 million 
women and children who were previously uninsured have gained access to a defined package of 
health services, exceeding the CPS target of 1.7 million beneficiaries and reaching more than 92 
percent of the eligible population. In the northern provinces, the share of expectant mothers 
receiving pre-natal consultations by week 20 rose from 3 percent at the start of the project to 67 
percent in 2012. Moreover, an impact evaluation analysis supported by the Bank 52 provides 
rigorous evidence of Plan Nacer’s impact on birth outcomes and neonatal health and the cost-
effectiveness of the intervention. Through the GPF Strengthening Governance in Argentina’s 
Health Sector activity, the Bank provided technical assistance in the design of the Federal Health 
Observatory, an institution that supports the development of an integrated health information 
system to monitor health policies by collecting independent data and providing information for 
better decision-making. A report on this effort was submitted to the Ministry of Health, and the 
Government plans to use the findings in establishing the Observatory. Further activities of the 
Observatory implementation will be financed by Bank health sector loans. 

29. 
Improved Education Outcomes. A focused engagement had begun in the education 
sector under the previous CPS, with the goal of improving educational outcomes in rural areas. 
Although Argentina has relatively high rates of school attendance, significant disparities persist 
in educational access and outcomes between urban and rural areas. Progress in reducing this gap 
continues to be made under the Rural Education Improvement Project. To date, more than 95 
percent of rural schools have been beneficiaries of at least one project component, and progress 
has been made on all indicators. The number of 5-year-old children in rural areas not enrolled in 
school has fallen from a baseline of 15,861 to 6,265 during the CPS period, surpassing the target 

51 Launched in 2004 in the poorest nine provinces of northern Argentina, Plan Nacer seeks to improve the maternal 
and child health of uninsured pregnant women and children by introducing highly innovative results-based financing 
mechanisms at the national, provincial, and health provider levels. Later expanded to the remaining 15 provinces of 
the country, Plan Nacer has provided health coverage to more than 4.7 million pregnant women and children and 
delivered some 37 million health services. The program has reached 92.4 percent of the eligible population.

from first to third grades and from 72 to 84 percent from seventh to eighth grades. 

Pillar 3. Improved Governance 

30. 
The original CPS focused on the Government’s goals of expanding performance-based 
management and improving the quality of public expenditures, enhancing service delivery 
outcomes and trust in institutions, and strengthening public sector capacity to foster investment 
and growth. However, the Government chose not to seek Bank financing in support of 
performance-based budgeting; instead, it asked that the Bank focus on improving efficiency and 
service delivery of public institutions at both the national and subnational levels. This pillar was 
reformulated in the CPS Progress Report to address the Government’s changing priorities. 

31. More Efficient Public Institutions. The Bank has continued 
to support 
the 
Government’s goals of improving the efficiency of public institutions at the national level 
through a series of ongoing projects. The Institutional Strengthening of the National Social 
Security Administration Project has contributed to an increase in the number of people who 
report satisfaction with ANSES services—from 45 percent in 2005 to 86 percent in 2012. The 
Social and Fiscal National Identification System APL-2 has, through a program of technical 
assistance and investments, helped raise the share of the population that is correctly identified 
and registered—from a baseline of 31 percent in 2008 to more than 92 percent in June 2012. The 
APL also allowed the Government to substantially increase the number of agencies using 
common processes to identify entities and assets to 91 by the end of the CPS, exceeding the 
target of 18. The Government is committed to continually improving information infrastructure 
to strengthen decision-making. The Bank is supporting the effort through such programs as 
SINTyS and the State Modernization Project, which contribute to institution building as well as 
service delivery. A centralized personnel registry (Sistema de Información del Servicio Nacional 
de Adiestramiento en Trabajo, or SINFO) has been established and covers 70 percent of civilian 
public employees; further progress is expected to be made toward the target of 90 percent during 
the next CPS. The project has also supported an electronic directory of Government procedures, 
which now includes 900 of them and annually attracts more than 2 million site visits. Finally, in 
agencies participating in the Citizens' Charter Program in which surveys of citizen satisfaction 
were carried out, citizen satisfaction improved from the baseline at the start of the project to 70 
percent of agencies according to results from May 2013. 

32. 
Enhanced Subnational Focus. The WBG responded quickly to the Government’s 
request to shift some of the focus on improving the efficiency of public services from the 
national to the subnational level. Through the Subnational Governments Public Sector 
Modernization Project, the provinces of Formosa and Chubut have reduced the time required to 
publish evaluation reports from 15 to 10 days. In addition, the integrated personnel information 
and pay system has been implemented in the province of Chubut, with 40 percent of staff in the 
system. During the CPS period, Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) projects have also been 
approved in San Juan and La Rioja provinces. Subnational service delivery was strengthened 
through the San Juan SWAp, leading to improved health and education outcomes, including an 
increase in child deliveries with more than four ante-natal care consultations from 21.34 percent 
in 2008 to 59.5 percent in 2013 and an increase in primary school promotion rates from 77 

62 

 
 
 
percent in 2008 to 93 percent in 2011. In turn, Bank support has helped La Rioja significantly 
increase local tax revenue, from 159 million pesos in 2011 to 281 million in 2012. 

IV. World Bank Group Performance 

Design and Relevance  

33. 
The CPS was relevant and aligned with Government priorities. Its design and 
implementation contributed to the achievement of CPS outcomes with a focus on results and an 
adaptation to changing circumstances and priorities. While the results framework was slightly 
adjusted with the CPS Progress Report, it appeared overly detailed, and had too many outcomes 
for the envisaged CPS period of three years. The three pillars of the FY10-12 CPS were carried 
over from its predecessor and continued to be priorities for the Government—with some changes 
in the underlying activities that were delivered and, at the request of the Government, a greater 
focus on subnational projects. At the request of the Government, the WBG worked closely with 
several provinces to design and implement new operations aimed at delivering results in the three 
areas. IFC continued to focus on fostering the country’s long-term growth by focusing on strong 
sectors, supporting SMEs and low-income groups through Argentine banks, and encouraging the 
development of high value-added technology enterprises. It should be noted that Argentina is a 
middle income country and space for the WBG to engage in broad macroeconomic dialogue was 
limited. Thus, the World Bank Group performance is rated as fair. 

Program Implementation  

34. 
During FY10-12 the WBG responded to client demand in a flexible manner, while not 
having such ability during FY13-14 as no new projects could be presented to the Board. Six of 
the delivered operations in FY10-12 were not envisioned in the CPS, but they fit with emerging 
Government priorities and the broader CPS pillars and were added during the progress report 
stage. Given the three-year implementation of the CPS it was difficult to build a more 
programmatic mechanism for knowledge services. A shift toward such an approach was seen in 
FY13-FY14, which will be carried over in the new strategy. Positive aspects of WBG 
performance included (a) flexibility in responding to refined Government priorities under all 
three pillars; (b) strong project implementation performance, including in leveraging results 
across broader Government programs in key sectors; and (c) delivery of knowledge services, 
particularly analytical and advisory activities (AAA) integrated in the implementation support of 
the investment portfolio. The Bank also supported South-South knowledge exchanges, helping to 
bring Argentina’s innovations and successes to regional and global audiences.  

35. Knowledge Services (AAA). The CPS laid out an expected AAA program for FY10-11, 
leaving the rest of the program under design and able to respond to emerging Government 
priorities. The majority of the expected program was delivered and well-aligned with the areas of 
engagement in the lending pipeline. Substantial knowledge services were delivered, focused on 
infrastructure, environment, social protection, health, and education, with an increasing demand 
from the subnational level for reimbursable advisory services (RAS) in the areas of public sector 
management and strategies for the productive sectors. Three of these activities have been 
delivered in Corrientes, Cordoba, and Chaco provinces. A substantial amount of knowledge 
work was performed as part of implementation support for lending projects, most notably in 

63 

 
 
infrastructure and health sector operations. While the AAA program was overall of good quality, 
delivered in a timely manner and broadly responding to demand, with hindsight it seems to have 
been scattered across a wide spectrum of sectors and lacking a more programmatic and strategic 
focus. The 18 AAA products that were completed under the CPS did not always benefit from a 
well-designed dissemination plan, and thus missed the opportunity to generate constructive 
dialogue with stakeholders and impact policy-making. This tendency changed, and especially 
during FY13-FY14 in the social and human development sectors, the AAA focused more on 
multi-year programmatic knowledge services that helped build a platform for evidence-based 
policy dialogue with different stakeholders, including the national and provincial governments, 
academia, think-tanks, and other civil society organizations. The Impact Evaluation of Plan 
NACER, for example, proved to be an effective instrument for policy dialogue throughout the 
implementation of the program. Its unique features in terms of scale, use of administrative data, 
and rigorous methodology have been discussed at a national forum on results-based financing for 
health that drew participants from more than 30 countries. Another example of forward-looking 
analysis was the work on demographics and aging that attracted attention from beyond 
Argentina. 

36. 
Constructive Relations with Government Counterparts. The Government and the 
Bank worked closely together on resolving implementation challenges, including through joint 
initiatives such as procurement capacity building and a safeguards gap analysis to link 
Argentina’s Environmental and Social Regulatory Framework to successful Bank-financed 
projects. A joint implementation workshop and regular Country Portfolio Performance Reviews 
(CPPRs) served as platforms for candid discussions of implementation concerns and 
identification of cross-cutting issues for joint action. Overall, the Argentine portfolio has been 
performing well, and there has been an increasing focus on measurable results, which will 
continue in the future (see Table 1). Some of the cross-cutting implementation issues identified 
as a result of joint reviews during the CPS period included: 

a. Project Implementation Unit (PIU) Staff Recruitment and Retention. As agreed 
during the previous CPS period, public officials working on the implementation of Bank-
financed operations are remunerated on the same pay scale as other public servants; this 
enables the PIUs to be fully integrated into implementing agencies. Delays in updating the 
pay scale have made it difficult for PIUs to attract and retain high-caliber specialists, 
particularly in the areas of procurement, engineering, and IT. This will likely to remain a 
challenge in the future.  

b. Effectiveness Delays. Projects requiring the signing of subsidiary loan agreements 
experienced significant effectiveness delays, leading to project effectiveness extensions. 
Although these operations overcame obstacles and achieved positive results, the costs of 
delays were substantial.  

c. Procurement Challenges. Despite many improvements and significant efforts on both 
sides, many projects in the portfolio faced procurement challenges. Cross-cutting issues in 
this area included (a) difficulties in attracting foreign participation at the short-list stage in 
consultant processes and in works contracts, and (b) obstacles to local SMEs obtaining bank 
guarantees. The Bank has already taken actions related to increasing thresholds for National 
Competitive Bidding (NCB) in works processes and for entirely national comprised short-

64 

 
 
lists for the selection of consultants. In addition, an NCB standard bidding document for 
works should be developed and adopted by all implementing entities, allowing the Bank to 
analyze and further update the current thresholds.

37. 
Fiduciary Matters. Overall, fiduciary concerns were moderate during the CPS period. 
Argentina has a mature public financial management (PFM) system, with an adequate legal basis 
and well-trained staff with the appropriate technical skills. The main challenges during the CPS 
period included gaps in the control environment, inconsistent enforcement of rules, and 
difficulties in implementing external audit recommendations. In the procurement area, the Bank 
is committed to working with the Government to strengthen understanding of Bank requirements 
and to explore options for greater flexibility in recognizing local market realities and needs. 
Subnational operations bring additional fiduciary challenges, with great capacity variation across 
provinces. The WBG paid special attention to these challenges in the design of subnational 
projects. During the CPS period, four PFM analytic products were completed in four provinces. 
Lastly, capacity-building activities for PIU staff and the auditing staff of Argentina’s supreme 
audit institution were delivered at least once a year. 

38. Governance. The Government addressed governance risks in a constructive manner. 
During the CPS period, the WBG team worked closely with the client to address governance 
challenges and risks in the health sector, particularly focusing on fiduciary weaknesses. A joint 
Governance Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) was developed, which cut across several 
operations in the sector. At the time of the CPSCR preparation, the majority of the agreed actions 
had been implemented, with the remaining expected to be completed within the next CPS. 

65 

 
 
 
 
 
V. Recommendations and Lessons Learned 

39. 
The CPSCR identifies five key lessons that are relevant for the design of the new 
strategy: (a) focusing on results while having flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and 
Government priorities was crucial for the achievement of project development objectives;  
(b) integrating governance as a cross-cutting theme into the overall engagement was the most 
efficient strategy for achieving results; (c) ensuring the CPS results framework is tied to the 
activities under implementation and is consistent with activities proposed is essential;  
(d) strengthening dialogue with Government counterparts by focusing on areas where there is a 
mutual commitment catalyzed innovation and strong results; and (e) maintaining a regular 
dialogue with Government counterparts and sharing implementation experiences helped improve 
portfolio performance.  

40. 
As noted, it is important to ensure that the CPS results framework is consistent with 
the proposed activities and the time period of implementation. Realistic and measureable 
results need to be tied to the activities already under implementation or expected to be delivered 
early in the CPS period. In a CPS of three years it is unrealistic to think that activities delivered 
after the first year or two will yield tangible results in the CPS period. This is especially true in 
Argentina, where long effectiveness delays are frequent. 

41. 
As noted, it is important to focus on governance as a cross-cutting theme instead of 
as an independent pillar. Under the FY10-12 CPS and its predecessor, improving governance 
was treated as a pillar. Intended results were only partly achieved because specific activities 
sometimes did not materialize. Some governance improvements were achieved by treating 
governance as a cross-cutting theme incorporated into project design, most notably in the Plan 
Nacer and CREMA roads projects.  

42. 
Regular dialogue with Government counterparts yielded positive results and lessons 
to improve portfolio performance. The main lessons in this respect include the need to  
(a) increase the presence of results-based financing to replicate successful experiences in health 
and social protection; (b) avoid unnecessary project complexity and reduce coordination 
demands; (c) seek simplicity in project design to avoid lengthy administrative processes; (d) 
recognize that additional financing requires the same processes as any new loan for the 
Government; (e) scale-up and formalize the use of mid-term reviews to address weaknesses in 
design and monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (f) simplify and reduce the number of indicators 
to better demonstrate results; and (g) provide sufficient transition time when changing Task 
Team Leaders (TTLs) and counterpart managers.  

43. 
Results-based financing has a successful record of delivering services to 
beneficiaries, building human capital and fostering employability. Setting targets and linking 
disbursement to results helps strengthens governance and accountability and contributes to 
developing a public sector culture that rewards performance. Results-oriented financing efforts 
have been successful for national programs (as in the case of employment support schemes) and 
provincial programs (as in the case of the health sector). 

44. 
Programmatic multi-year knowledge and advisory services are particularly effective 
instruments for evidence-based policy dialogue. Effective policy dialogue can be achieved by 

66 

 
 
combining global analytical experience with first-class local research institutions and think-tanks 
and leveraging platforms for policy dialogue (e.g., on the subject of how population aging will 
impact the sustainability of Argentina’s welfare system). The Impact Evaluation of Plan NACER 
was a powerful instrument for policy dialogue not only in terms of final results but also in design 
and implementation. To be effective, impact evaluations require significant human and financial 
resources and stable partnerships between international specialists and local institutions. 

45. 
Input-based public sector support has had limited impact. Large projects with 
national scale have traditionally supported development of information technology- (IT-) based 
solutions to improve governance of the public sector. However, they have sometimes tended to 
suffer from limited focus and have not mobilized additional resources to introduce sustainable 
changes. Direct support to provincial governments focused on building capacity for public 
service delivery has shown a strong record of results through operations based on Disbursement-
Linked Indicators (DLIs) and through technical assistance for Rapid Assessment Action Plans 
(RAAPs).

Lessons and Suggestions for 
the New CPS 

Projects that are implemented in 
cooperation with the local 
government and are closer to the 
beneficiary have better chance to 
yield results (Cordoba Roads 
project). 

Seek simplicity in design to 
avoid lengthy administrative 
processes (e.g., Provincial Road 
Infrastructure; Urban Flood 
APL-2; Municipal Services 
Project; Buenos Aires 
Infrastructure Sustainable 
Development APL-2). 

Any future engagement in 
infrastructure should continue to 
support institutional capacity to 
better manage maintenance and 
budget to carry out rehabilitation 
work. 

A comprehensive assessment of 
current and future needs (beyond 
the project’s life) could be useful 
for the longer-term sustainability 
of infrastructure and can provide 
a better picture of institutional 
needs and financing options 
(taxes, fees, private capital) 
required for maintaining 
infrastructure in good condition.

Complex projects that seek to 
change behavior should adopt a 
gradual approach to avoid a 
prolonged start-up period. 
Sequencing of interventions, 
especially in complex projects, 
maximizes the chances for 
successful outcomes. Important 
activities should be designed 
early on and not left for the

they can take a lot longer than

Inclusion of ex ante emergency

Lessons and Suggestions for

Decentralized implementation of 
a national project is a complex 
task and requires sufficient 
technical assistance to provinces 
as well as monitoring 
instruments for quick diagnostics 
and rapid adjustments. National 
projects also require more 
budget supervision. 

Bilateral agreements between the 
federal government and 
provincial authorities have been 
instrumental in building 
ownership and accountability as 
well as the flexibility of each 
province to undertake specific 
diagnostic work on gaps and 
indicators (e.g., Rural Education

Lessons and Suggestions for 
the New CPS 

Complex projects require 
intensive procurement but strong 
coordination between the Bank 
and implementing agencies 
ensure timely completion of 
activities (e.g., Institutional 
Strengthening of the National 
Social Security Administration 
Project P092836). 

Avoid designs that include 
numerous small contracts that 
require different bidding 
documents and intensive 
procurement (Institutional 
Strengthening of the National 
Social Security Administration 
Project (ANSES II) (P092836), 
State Modernization II Project 
(P101170), and Subnational 
Governments Public Sector 
Modernization Project 
(P070448)). 

The rapid evolution of ICT 
requires that highly trained staff 
are retained to provide support 
and ensure the leverage of new 
technologies to keep up with the 
advancement and application of 
ICT.

Lessons and Suggestions for 
the New CPS 
Too many indicators complicate 
monitoring and are not always 
an effective way to demonstrate 
results. Keeping indicators to 
manageable level is critical for 
efficient monitoring project 
progress 

Regular physical presence of 
Bank staff to help address 
implementation bottlenecks 
facilitates dialogue and 
monitoring of progress in a more 
involved fashion. 

Changes in TTLs and 
counterpart managers, while 
inevitable, need to provide 
sufficient time for transition and 
hand-over to ensure shared 
understanding of project 
objectives and implementation.  

Projects that involve multiple 
institutions should find 
pragmatic coordination 
mechanisms taking into 
consideration the respective 
capacities of the agencies. These 
should be made clear from the 
very beginning.

Annex 3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the CPS FY14-18 Results Framework 

Results area #1: 

Reduction in cost of freight transport in selected corridors of Northern Argentina by 20 
percent 

Baseline 2014: average cost in selected corridors: $/tn.km 0.233 - AR$/tn.km 1.861; target 
2018: average cost in selected corridors: $/tn.km 0.185 - AR$/tn.km 1.476 
Cost of freight transport is defined per DNV methodology to calculate the overall cost of 
transported ton per km, in heavy vehicles, at a given circulation speed. 2014 baseline data 
source: Unidad de Redeterminación de precios de Vialidad Nacional. In 2018 the information 
will be provided by the same source. 

IFC: 61,000 direct jobs supported through IFC clients 

Direct jobs is a portfolio indicator that IFC tracks; it measures the number of direct jobs that its 
portfolio clients support. These are not new jobs (although increases will reflect net hiring). This 
indicator is part of the IFC standard operating procedure; it negotiates relevant indicators with 
clients, and at the end of each calendar year they send IFC their company information. All data is 
vetted by Ernst & Young. Baseline: 56,000. 

Results area #2: 

15 percent reduction in average transit time for bottom 40 percent in 2 metropolitan areas 
(Buenos Aires, Rosario) 

Baseline 2014: Buenos Aires: 51.92 minutes per transit trip + Rosario: 36.78 minutes per transit 
trip // Weighted average: 51 minutes. Target 2018: Baseline - 15 percent. 
Average transit time for the bottom 40 percent of the population in the metropolitan areas of 
Buenos Aires and Rosario is defined as the average travel times for public transport plus the 
average travel time for multimodal trips. Baseline data sources are O/D Surveys in Metropolitan 
Areas of Argentina financed through PTUMA operation, processed and published by the 
Ministry of Interior and Transport. 2018 information will also be provided by PTUMA. 

Results area #3: 

Increase the gross value of agricultural production ($/ha) of 80,000 small- and medium-size 
farms by 12 percent on average by 2018 

Baseline values: Given the demand-driven nature of the projects, it is not possible to define a 
baseline value for the future interventions of PROSAP3 and Rural Inclusion projects. For this 
reason, the GVAP baseline is calculated on the actual without-project data for PROSAP1 
(closed) and PROSAP2 (ongoing). The expected GVAP increase (12 percent) of future 
beneficiaries is based on the average difference between the actual with-project results from 

94 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROSAP1 and estimated with-project results for PROSAP2. The evaluation of GVAP will 
exceed constant prices (i.e., same price for with and without project). Sources: PROSAP1, 
PROSAP2, FAO/PROSAP: Potential of irrigation in Argentina ongoing (2014). 
Producers: The total population of relevant farms is 250,000. Sources: Sheinkerman de 
Obschatko, family farms in Argentina, IICA/PROINDER, 2009. 
The advantages of using the GVAP rather than productivity is that it allows: comparing across 
crops and production systems, converting different yields (pears and oranges) to a uniform 
monetary value; analyzing changes of crop (a crop replaced by another one); and the comparison 
in with/without-project yields would be meaningless. 
Reference from FAO STAT: Gross Value of Production is compiled by multiplying gross 
production in physical terms by output prices at farm gate. Thus, value of production measures 
production in monetary terms at the farm-gate level. Since intermediate uses within the 
agricultural sector (seed and feed) have not been subtracted from production data, this value of 
production aggregate refers to the notion of “gross production.” 
Value of gross production is provided in both current and constant terms and is expressed in US 
dollars and Standard Local Currency (SLC). The current value of production measures value in 
the prices relating to the period being measured. Thus, it represents the market value of food and 
agricultural products at the time they were produced. Knowing this figure is helpful in 
understanding exactly what was happening within a given economy at that point in time. Often, 
this information can help explain economic trends that emerged in later periods and why they 
occurred. Value of production in constant terms is derived using the average prices of a selected 
year or years, known as the base period. Constant price series can be used to show how the 
quantity or volume of products has changed, and are often referred to as volume measures. The 
ratio of the current and constant price series gives a measure of price movements. 

Results area #4: 

365,000 people receive electricity services (out of 725,000 without in 2010); access in the 
Norte Grande provinces to safe drinking water increases from 83 to 92 percent and to 
sanitation from 41 to 55 percent 

People receiving electricity is defined as off-grid population, in households, that can access 
electricity via individual renewable systems or mini grids, not connected to the Interconnected 
National System. Baseline data for 2010 comes from the National Census. Information for 2018 
will be provided by the PIU at the National Energy Secretariat. 
Safe drinking water access is defined as: access to drinking water means that the source is less 
than 1 kilometer away from its place of use and that it is possible to reliably obtain at least 20 
liters per member of a household per day; safe drinking water is water with microbial, chemical, 
and physical characteristics that meet WHO guidelines or national standards on drinking water 
quality. Access to safe drinking water is the proportion of people using improved drinking water 
sources: household connection; public standpipe; borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; 
or rainwater. In Argentina piped water should be available at least 18 hours a day. 

95 

 
 
 
 
 
Definition of access to improved sanitation services: basic sanitation is the lowest-cost 
technology ensuring hygienic excreta and sullage disposal and a clean and healthy living 
environment both at home and in the neighborhood of users. Access to basic sanitation includes 
safety and privacy in the use of these services. Coverage is the proportion of people using 
improved sanitation facilities: public sewer connection; septic system connection; pour-flush 
latrine; simple pit latrine; or ventilated improved pit latrine. 
Baseline data for water and sanitation comes from 2010 National Census. In 2018 water utilities 
from the involved provinces will provide updated access data. 

Results area #5: 

Proportion of eligible people benefiting from effective healthcare rises from 28 percent 
(2014) to 50 percent (2018) 
The indicator is defined as “Eligible people enrolled in Programa Sumar that received a health 
service in a given period of time according to each defined age group”/ “Eligible people: 
uninsured children under 10, youth 10-19, and women 20-64 years of age.” The numerator is 
measured by administrative data of Programa Sumar. The period of time considered to receive 
health services varies by age group, as defined in the Operational Manual of the project. The 
denominator is based on an estimation of eligible population (Massa, 2013) that draws on census 
data as well as administrative data on uninsured population. 

Results area #6: 

Secondary school completion rate in rural areas rises from 61.5 percent (2010) to 65.5 
percent (2018); relative chance of labor market insertion rate for 400,000 young people 
doubles 
Secondary school completion rate in rural areas is defined as “Number of students graduating 
from the last year of upper secondary school (12th grade) “/ “Number of children in secondary 
school graduation age.” The source for the numerator is administrative data from DiNIECE 
(Dirección Nacional de Información y Evaluación de la Calidad Educativa). Population data are 
obtained by applying the proportion of rural population per the 2010 census to the INDEC 
population projections for the years 2011-2018. 
Relative chance of labor market insertion rate is calculated by comparing insertion rates in the 
formal sector for (i) youth benefitting from ALMPs and (ii) comparison group with similar 
characteristics drawn from the EPH (Encuesta Permanente de Hogares). Youth are considered to 
have participated in the program if they have at least attended the Initial Orientation Course 
(POI), and their insertion rate 12 months after exiting from the program is followed through 
ANSES’ registry (SIPA). The comparison group has socioeconomic characteristics similar to 
those of beneficiaries (age 18-24, less than complete secondary school education, not in school, 
unemployed or under-employed, informal workers in the base year).

Results area #7: 

Flood risk protection reaches 2.3 million people in the three provinces of Chaco, Corrientes 
and Buenos Aires (2014 baseline: 200,000 people) 
Flood risk protection is defined as the reduction of flood impacts from structural measures 
controlling the flood of water and nonstructural measures intended to keep people safe from 
flooding through planning and management. The estimation of the beneficiaries was derived 
using two approaches. First to calculate the resident beneficiaries, flood maps were used to 
compare with and without works scenarios (the area affected by floods is considered to have 
more than 20 cm of water height above street, and using the design storm (e.g., in the case of the 
Autonomous City of Buenos Aires this is 10 years). Thus, resident beneficiaries = (area affected 
by floods without works - Area affected by floods with works) * population density. 
The second group of direct beneficiaries includes 1.7 million people that commute daily through 
the target basins; this number derives from two studies: According to the ENMODO Encuesta de 
Movilidad Domiciliaria, 2010 (financed by the World Bank under the PTUBA project study), 1.1 
million people commute daily between the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) and the 
greater metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, and two million people commute within CABA 
limits. According to the INTRUPUBA Investigación de Transporte Urbano Público de Buenos 
Aires, 2009 (financed by the World Bank), 47 percent of the trips within the CABA start, end, 
and/or traverse the Maldonado, Vega, and Cildáñez watersheds, and 69 percent of the trips 
starting or ending in the provinces traverse the same watersheds. 
2014 baseline information comes from flood hazards maps and 2010 national census data. 
Information for 2018 will reflect the updated flood hazard maps of the involved provinces and 
the implemented works. If available, survey data from flood events will be taken into 
consideration. 

Results area #8: 

75 percent of sewage discharges from AySA Waste Water Treatment Plants, WWTP 
(Laferrere, El Jaguel, Sudoeste, Lanus, Fiorito) to Rio Matanza-Riachuelo will be treated 
according to a regional standard on water quality (ACUMAR Res. 03/2009, BOD<15mg/l - 
90 percent of the time). Baseline is zero, as no plant to date satisfies the ACUMAR 
Resolution. 
Increase in sewerage coverage from 33 percent to 72 percent in the Province of Buenos 
Aires’ 14 municipalities of the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin 
In 2018, the quantity and the quality of the AySA sewage discharges will be determined by the 
monitoring of the discharges of the new and/or upgraded plants. This information will be 
produced by AySA and supervised by Acumar. Sewerage coverage is defined as the amount of 
households using improved sanitation facilities. 
The 33 percent baseline data is from the 2010 national census. In 2018, the information 
regarding sewerage coverage for the 14 GBA municipalities will be provided by AySA and 
ABSA, water utilities of the greater metropolitan area of Buenos Aires.

Results area #9: 

Annual deforestation rate of natural forest in critical areas of Chaco, Salta, and Santiago 
de Estero (Category I or red according to the National Forest Law 26331) falls from 0.56 
percent (baseline 2011) to 0.28 during the implementation of the CPS. This would represent 
a 50 percent decline in deforestation in critical areas in targeted provinces. Deforestation 
rate in critical areas is defined as: Category I forest area lost / total Category I Forest area 
in the targeted provinces. 
The baseline and target values for deforestation of natural forests in critical areas were calculated 
focusing on the three provinces with the largest area of natural forest cover (Santiago del Estero, 
Salta, and Chaco). Approximately 85 percent of the total country deforestation in natural forest 
takes place in these provinces. These three provinces also accounted for more than 90 percent of 
total national critical area forest losses in 2011. The baseline rate was calculated as the sum of 
deforestation in critical areas for conservation across the three provinces and divided by the total 
deforested area in these three provinces (RED, YELLOW, and GREEN as indicated in the 
National Forest Law). Data on deforestation in 2011 come from the 2014 Auditor General’s 
report on implementation of the National Forest Law. 
Information for 2018 will be obtained from the Forest Evaluation System Management Unit, 
inside the Forests Directorate of the National Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable 
Development.

Annex 7. Evolution of Social Spending in Argentina 

Public expenditures in Argentina, measured as a percentage of GDP, varied considerably in 
recent years. According to official statistics, 1 while in the 1980s and 1990s expenditures 
amounted to slightly more than 30 percent, the 2001 crisis led to a decline that reached a low 
point of 24 percent in 2004. The official statistics series on social spending published by the 
Ministry of Finance run to 2009. Expenditures began to grow since 2004, sustained by an 
unprecedented increase in fiscal revenues, and by 2009 they represented 35 percent of GDP. 2  
Within 
total public expenditures, social expenditures have been stable, representing 
approximately 65 percent of total spending since the early 1990s; thus, spending in the three 
main social sectors has also shown a rapid increase during the last decade. Note that the main 
increase was not a function of the introduction of specific social assistance programs, but rather 
of an expansion of coverage of the social systems already in place.  
Public spending on education, which amounted to just over 2.5 percent of GDP in the 1980s and 
3.5 percent in the 1990s, by 2009 was closer to the Education Financing Law target, at 5.4 
percent. 3 In the case of Health, total public expenditures also grew consistently since the 1980s, 
and amounted to 5 percent of GDP by 2009. Finally, the Social Protection system (which 
includes Social Security, Social Assistance, and Employment programs) experienced an increase 
between the 1980s and 1990s (from 6.7 percent to 9.9 percent of GDP) and again during the last 
decade, reaching 10.4 percent of GDP in 2009. Part of this change can be explained by the 
adoption of a much stronger social assistance strategy. However, spending on pensions explains 
most of the increase, particularly the expansion in coverage registered since 2006 with the 
“Moratoria” program. 
After 2009, it is possible to construct an estimation of total national spending on social policies 
by using different figures published by other government institutions. Table 1 presents the results 
of this exercise. For the years 2008 and 2009, these data adjust well to the aforementioned series, 
although they seem to overestimate social insurance figures by 0.6 percent and 0.8 percent of 
GDP, respectively. 
According to these estimates, between 2009 and 2012 expenditures on pensions increased the 
most, by more than 1.5 percentage points as a proportion of GDP (from 8.9 percent to 10.6 
percent). Although pensions expenditures have to be managed carefully, scope for rapid increase 
is limited since coverage is almost universal and benefit indexation follows a rule that prevents 
discretionary increases. Moreover, the demographic outlook for Argentina is very favorable and 
projects low and stable dependency ratios for the next few decades. 

1 “Bonari” series on public spending published until 2009 by MECON, Dirección de Análisis de Gasto Público y 
Programas Sociales (DAGPyPS). 
2 This estimation considers the 2014 revision of GDP figures (2004-2014) published by the official national 
authority (INDEC). 
3 This Law, passed in 2005, established that the consolidated public spending in Education (including Federal and 
Provincial governments) should reach 6 percent of GDP by 2010.

Table 7.2 presents data on total spending on Education, Health, and Social Security for OECD 
countries plus Argentina (2009 and 2012) and Brazil as a regional comparator. Figure 2 (A 
through C) presents spending for each type of expenditure as a proportion of GDP per capita (in 
constant 2005 US$), for each of the countries in the sample. The last chart (D) shows the total of 
social spending. All graphs also present the OLS regression line. Argentina has slightly higher 
(in the case of education and pensions) or equal (in the case of healthcare) spending than the 
average country in the sample after income levels are controlled.

Annex 11. Status of Gender Issues in Argentina 

Argentina has made great strides toward gender equality over the past three decades. 1 Although 
it is among the leaders in Latin America in some gender indicators, such as political participation 
at the national level, and basic education in terms of literacy and primary school enrollment, the 
country compares less favorably to its upper-middle-income countries cohort in key areas, 
including teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality rates. This annex examines the status of 
gender issues in Argentina from the framework of the World Development Report (WDR) 2012: 
Gender Equality and Development. That report identified three key dimensions of gender 
equality outcomes: (a) endowments (education and health); (b) economic opportunities, and (c) 
agency 2 that are closely related and mutually reinforcing. Gender equality across all three of 
these dimensions is important for reducing poverty, promoting equity, and enhancing overall 
growth and productivity of current as well as future generations. 

Gender equality in endowments 

1. 
Education. Consistent with most Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries, the 
gender gap in education increases as the level of education rises. Where there is virtual gender 
parity in terms of primary school enrollment rates (female-to-male ratio: 0.98, 2011) 3 boys face 
challenges in post-primary education retention. The ratio of female-to-male enrollment in 
secondary and education shows a gap favoring girls (1.11 and 1.56 respectively, 2011). 
2. 
Sexual and reproductive health. There has been some backsliding in maternal health 
indicators over the last decade, but most recent data show again a positive trend. Contraceptive 
use in Argentina is above the LAC average (78.3 percent versus 75 percent, 2005). While the 
percentage of births attended by skilled health staff has dropped from 99.4 percent in 2007 to 
94.9 percent in 2010, it improved again in 2011 (97.4 percent). This puts Argentina now slightly 
above the average for upper-middle-income (UMC) countries (96.6 percent, 2010) and 
significantly above LAC average (89 percent). Similarly, the maternal mortality ratio (per 
100,000 live births) suffered a significant increase in the 2000s but has now dropped again to a 
level significantly below the LAC average (69 versus 85, 2013). The nature and severity of 
problems facing Argentine women vary substantially in different geographic, demographic, and 
socioeconomic groups, especially with respect to maternal mortality. For example, in Jujuy, there 
are 165 deaths per 100,000 live births because of maternal-related causes, while the count for the 
city of Buenos Aires is only 18. 4  

1 This note is based on a longer Note ‘Gender Issues in Argentina’ (2012) which was prepared (and updated) during 
the process of CPS preparation. The Annex also uses various recent reports from other organizations.  
2 Women’s agency influences their ability to build human capital and pursue economic opportunities, and thus also 
matters for the welfare of their children. 
3 All data used in this note are taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators unless cited otherwise

3. 
Male health outcomes. Compared to women, men face less positive health outcomes, 
especially for life expectancy, non-communicable diseases, accidents, and injuries (including 
suicide and violence). 5  

Gender equality in economic opportunities 

4. 
Labor force participation. Female labor force participation 2003-2013 declined slightly, 
from 64.6 percent to 63.9 percent. 6 Women are more likely to be engaged in informal 7 work 
compared to men (40.2 versus 34.5 percent, 2013). The gender gap in unemployment is 
particularly large for youth (24.0 percent for girls compared to 18.0 percent for boys, 2013).  
5. 
Gender wage gap. The gender wage gap has been closing over the past decade (females 
made only 78 percent of the average male’s earnings in 2010, up from 2000, when females made 
72 percent of male earnings). At the same time, women comprise the majority of the Argentine 
adult population having no income of their own (22.8 percent of women versus 9.7 percent of 
men). 8  

Gender equality in agency 

6. 
Political participation. Women in Argentina hold 37.4 percent (2012) of the seats in 
Parliament, far above the LAC and UMC averages (24.5 percent, 2012 and 21.9 percent, 2012, 
respectively). However, female representation is much lower at the local level, as only 10.2 
percent of mayors are female (CEPAL 2012). 
7. 
Gender-based violence. In Argentina, 20 percent of couples experience violence within 
the home (2008). Disturbingly, 42 percent of female murder victims were killed by their intimate 
partners and 37 percent of women that have been beaten by their partners endure this situation 
for 20 years or more. 9 
8. 
Teenage pregnancy. The adolescent fertility rate for females ages 15-19 has declined 
slowly but steadily: while in 2000 it stood at 64.3 births per 1,000 women, it declined to 54.3 in 
2012, far below the LAC average (68.01) but still far above the UMC average (31.2). Substantial 
disparities can be observed across socioeconomic groups and provinces: While on average 16 
percent of all live births occur to females under the age of 20, Chaco has the highest rate of all 
provinces for 15-19-year-old mothers, at 22.8 percent of all live births, and the northeast region 
has the highest rate overall (22 percent) (OPS 2011).

A gender-sensitive Bank portfolio 

9. 
Data collection. The WBG will make an effort to measure the gender-disaggregated 
impact of new operations by supporting gender-disaggregated data collection at the subnational, 
local, and project levels, whenever feasible. While many existing projects do not have gender-
disaggregated indicators as part of their outcome-level indicators, most of them do track valuable 
information by gender. The Bank will ensure this information is systematically collected, 
analyzed, and shared with stakeholders. 
10. Health sector. The Bank has been a long-standing partner of the Government in 
addressing gender-related issues in the health sector. Incorporating lessons from the 2012 WDR, 
efforts have been intensified to contribute to gender equality across all sectors of Bank 
engagement in Argentina. The health portfolio is supporting the Government in addressing two 
of the main gender-related health issues: maternal mortality and teenage pregnancy.  
11. 
Addressing gender disparities in youth employment. The Youth Employment policy 
developed by the Ministry of Labor and supported by the Bank has developed a design and 
implementation strategy to address gender inequalities. For example, child care services and part 
time training services are provided to facilitate the participation of young mothers in training 
programs. Also, training materials with a specific gender focus have been developed and are 
regularly used in basic orientation courses, as well as for training of municipal employment 
offices' staff. As part of the Youth Employment Support Project, further options on how to 
deepen these initiatives will be explored.  
12. 
Voice. In addition, infrastructure and rural development projects are promoting gender-
sensitive social participation mechanisms intended to strengthen the voice of women and girls in 
the household and their ability to participate in decisions that impact them, their families, and 
their communities.

Annex 12: Consultations with Stakeholders 
1. 
Engaging with Argentina’s civil society, key opinion leaders, prominent political figures 
and government counterparts was part of the consultation process which, together with the 
results of the FY12 client survey, contributed to shaping the country partnership strategy.  
2. 
The key areas of consultations included three main topics: (a) how to effectively reach 
the poor, through a program that is focusing new operations in the poorest provinces of the north 
east and north west of Argentina; (b) macro-economic perspectives that will impact the 
implementation of the CPS; and (c) how to advance a stronger gender agenda that promotes 
more women benefiting from the gains of inclusive growth.  
3. 
Stakeholder consultations underscored poverty and equality of opportunities as top 
development priorities, along with flexibility and results-based approaches in program design. 
The Argentina 2012 client survey results showed poverty and equality of opportunity are the top 
development priorities. The prevalent responses attach higher value to the WBG’s financial 
services. In terms of knowledge, the Bank is recognized for its contributions to the following 
sectors: health, education, agriculture, climate change, economic growth, and poverty reduction.  
4. 
The discussions highlighted the importance of development priorities for Argentina 
which include: improving macroeconomic stability to underpin continued high economic growth, 
poverty reduction and shared prosperity; expanding and enhancing the quality of infrastructure, 
transport, and logistics services to remove bottlenecks; increasing productivity to boost 
competitiveness; strengthen public sector management and service delivery at both federal and 
provincial levels; increasing the quality of education; reducing disparities among provinces; 
improving the fiscal sustainability of social programs and their quality, coverage, and efficiency; 
and reducing environmental degradation and better managing climate change and disaster risk 
5. 
Consultations on economic policies reflected that the country’s outlook was clouded by 
macroeconomic imbalances, increased policy uncertainty, weak global environment and the 
ongoing court case with the holdout creditors. Lack of access to international capital markets and 
reliance on Central Bank reserves for debt payment were highlighted as key challenges because 
the room for maneuvering has been narrowing. Initial consultations had also drawn attention to 
international settlement disputes and the issues related to the quality of national statistics. The 
WBG contributions to improving macroeconomic outcomes were considered to be the relevant 
knowledge and experience that the WBG can share with the country, the plurality in WBG’s 
dialogue in building consensus on key macroeconomic challenges and the positive signaling 
effect in facilitating access to international markets.  
6. 
Feedback received on challenges to reaching the poorest provinces of the north, included 
suggestions to: (i) continue with the scheme of results-based financing to replicate successful 
experiences; (ii) support capacity building for public officials at the provincial level, specially 
the poorest ones; and (iii) focus on the simplicity of project design.

In terms of lessons on project implementation several things were highlighted: (i) the 
need to simplify and reduce the number of indicators to better measure results; (ii) the role of the 
Bank in providing added value in fiduciary issues but also the need for more flexibility in project 
execution as priorities change; (iii) decentralize Task Team Leaders (TTLs) to the country in an 
attempt to improve execution and decision making; and (iv) an overall appreciation of the work 
done with the Bank based on success in achieving results (e.g. flood prevention), in being

innovative and substantive in terms of technical contributions. A special focus needs to be placed 
on how to reduce the complexity of WBG projects to be more effective. Client survey 
respondents together with those who participated in the consultations expressed the opinion that 
the Bank should collaborate more with local governments. 
Addressing gender inequalities was seen by representatives of civil society as a key factor 
to make further progress in reducing poverty and inequality, with a special focus on worker 
productivity and reduction in the gender wage gap. While gender inequality in Argentina is 
lower than in other countries in the region, significant challenges remain in terms of women 
empowerment, health and economic opportunities, most notably in rural areas. Female labor 
force participation 2003-2013 declined slightly, from 64.6 percent to 63.9 percent. 10 The gender 
gap in unemployment is particularly large for youth (24.0 percent for girls compared to 18.0 
percent for boys, 2013. The gender wage gap has been closing over the past decade (females 
made only 78 percent of the average male’s earnings in 2010, up from 2000, when females made 
72 percent of male earnings). Argentina has adequate legislative and institutional structures to 
prevent gender based discrimination, but continues to face challenges in implementation.
