EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

This is the World Bank Group’s first Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Vietnam 
since it became a lower middle-income country in 2009.  Vietnam became IBRD-eligible in 2007 and 
received its first IBRD loan in 2009. The CPS will support implementation of Vietnam‟s new five -year 
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2011-2015.  It combines continuity from the previous 
CPS program with the introduction of some strategic shifts that will likely take more than one CPS period 
to yield significant change.  These shifts are primarily intended to sharpen strategic focus within the 
Bank‟s program, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver development results faster.    

2. 

Vietnam has achieved remarkable development success over the last 25 years.  Reforms 
introduced in 1986 have transformed the country from a centrally planned to a more market oriented 
economy.  This has spurred rapid growth (averaging 7.3 percent during 1990-2010) and significant 
poverty reduction.  Vietnam‟s per capita income has increased more than eleven-fold to US$1,130 in 
2010, and the poverty headcount ratio has fallen from 58 percent in 1993 to 14.5 percent in 2008.  The 
country has already attained several of its original Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and is likely 
to achieve a few more by 2015.  There have been dramatic improvements in the welfare of the average 
Vietnamese citizen.   

3. 

In recent years, however, Vietnam has found it more difficult to maintain high levels of 
growth with macroeconomic stability.  This reflects in part its deeper integration into global markets 
with World Trade Organization (WTO) accession in 2007 and recent global crises.  However, the more 
important explanation is a reliance on public investment, channeled largely through a weak state 
enterprise sector and financed by massive credit expansion, to drive growth.  This has led to an 
accommodating macroeconomic policy stance, inefficient public investments and a high level of 
indebtedness in the state sector.  Banking and financial sector risks have therefore become elevated.  The 
economy has suffered episodes of macroeconomic instability with high levels of inflation, depreciation 
and instability of the currency, and signs of significant internal capital flight.  Since early 2011, the 
Government has been implementing a comprehensive stabilization program (Resolution 11) which has 
begun to reestablish macroeconomic stability.  A plenum of the Communist Party of Vietnam in October 
2011 reaffirmed the Government‟s commitment to sustaining macroeconomic stability and set three 
aspects of economic restructuring as priorities for the next five years.  These are restructuring of (i) public 
investment; (ii) the financial sector with focus on commercial banking system and financial institutions; 
and (iii) state-owned enterprises with focus on economic groups. Action on this will be important for 
tackling the structural drivers of macroeconomic instability and enhancing the economy‟s efficiency. 

4. 

Vietnam’s aspirations to avoid the middle income trap and become a successful middle 
income country (MIC) will require strengthening the economy’s competit iveness.  In addition to 
recent macroeconomic instability, the business environment is constrained by weak infrastructure, by high 
costs of interacting with Government agencies, and by a lack of adequate information on policy.  Vietnam 
will also need to begin to build the basis for shifting to higher productivity, product and process 
innovation, and value addition as its low-cost labor advantage begins to dissipate.  Developing a better 
educated workforce and strengthening its technology and innovation system will be critical for this.   

5. 

Vietnam has relied on its abundant natural resources for growth, but has not always 
managed the environmental impacts properly.  While the share of Vietnam‟s economic growth derived 
from its natural capital (e.g., fisheries, forestry, and mineral resources) will likely diminish with further 
industrialization, it will nonetheless remain an important source of growth and employment especially for 
the poor.  Population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and major changes in patterns of rural 
development have contributed to deterioration of air and water quality and loss of biodiversity.  Vietnam 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
 
relies on international rivers for 60 percent of its surface water flow .  Dry-season water supply is under 
pressure, and climate change will exacerbate the situation.  There is now strong recognition in 
Government of the need for a more sustainable use of natural resources and the environment . 

6. 

Inequality in Vietnam is beginning to rise, and the pace of poverty reduction has inevitably 
slowed, with poverty increasingly concentrated in ethnic minority communities.  Macroeconomic 
instability and adverse weather shocks have also increased household vulnerability.  Development of 
Vietnam‟s systems for governance and accountability has lagged behind the country‟s broader 
development success, making it more difficult to address these challenges effectively.  Progress on these 
issues – competitiveness, sustainability, persistent poverty and rising inequality, vulnerability, and 
governance – are critical for making progress on Vietnam‟s ambitious development aspirations in the 
medium and long term.  Addressing them is at the core of both the Government‟s overall strategy and this 
CPS. 

7. 

The Government’s development vision for the next decade is laid out in its Socio-Economic 
Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020.  The SEDS gives attention to structural reforms, 
environmental sustainability, social equity, and emerging issues of macroeconomic stability.  It defines 
three “breakthrough areas”: (i) promoting human resources/skills development (particularly skills for 
modern industry and innovation), (ii) improving market institutions, and (iii) infrastructure development.  
The overall goal is for Vietnam to lay the foundations for a modern, industrialized society by 2020.  The 
SEDP 2011-2015, approved by the new National Assembly in November 2011, elaborates the objectives 
of the SEDS and identifies the specific measures and resources that are needed for its implementation.  
Aligned with the Government‟s overall strategic priorities and goals, the CPS will support the three 
breakthrough areas of the SEDS and SEDP of promoting human resources, improving market institutions, 
and advancing infrastructure development.   

8. 

The CPS introduces several new principles of Bank engagement in Vietnam aimed at 
increasing the Bank’s impact: (i) sharpening strategic focus by reducing program dispersion through 
consolidation and greater  selectivity; (ii) improving operational efficiency, including through the 
introduction of more systemic approaches, leveraging resources by strengthening policy dialogue and 
analytical and advisory services (AAA), through synergies with development partners, and across the 
World Bank Group (WBG); and (iii) accelerating implementation for more timely results.    

9. 

Building on Vietnam's strong track record of growth and poverty reduction, the World 
Bank Group will partner with Vietnam in its effort to achieve success as a middle income country. 
The CPS program will support selected elements of the transitions required for this, notably, from an 
agrarian economy toward one that is more urban and industrialized; from a focus on quantity toward a 
greater focus on quality of production and service provision; and from a comparative advantage of low-
cost labor, with low value added, to one with a growing share of innovation -led and higher value-added 
production and services.   

10. 

The CPS program will support investments and policies organized into a strategic 
framework of three pillars and three cross-cutting themes.  The pillars are:  (i) strengthening 
Vietnam's competitiveness in the regional and global economy, (ii) increasing the sustainability of its 
development, and (iii) broadening access to opportunity.  Key cross-cutting themes are (i) strengthening 
governance, (ii) supporting gender equity, and (ii) improving resilience in the face of external economic 
shocks, natural hazards and the impact of climate change. A wide range of instruments will be used, 
including results-based approaches, a series of development policy operations (DPOs) to succeed the 
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series concluding with the tenth operation in December 2011, 
regional IDA operations, and programmatic AAA.  The Global Environment Facility (GEF), Recipient 

ii 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Executed Trust Funds (RETFs), and Institutional Development Fund grants (IDFs) for capacity building 
will complement IDA and IBRD resources.  With new challenges emerging in the poverty agenda – e.g., 
rising inequality, urban poverty, and concentration of poverty in remote ethnic minority communities – 
the CPS includes a renewed commitment to poverty reduction, including through better understanding of 
Vietnam‟s shifting poverty dynamics, and to new targeted poverty interventions informed by this 
understanding.  Governance and gender lenses will be applied to all operations at an early stage of 
preparation to seize opportunities for strengthening support in these areas.  Resilience emerges as an 
important theme in light of Vietnam‟s greater vulnerability to shocks on several fronts: external shocks at 
both the macroeconomic and household level, and natural hazards and climate change.  The CPS supports 
a strengthening of Vietnam‟s resilience on these specific issues in the respective pillars of the framework.   

11. 

The challenge for the Vietnam program is to achieve results faster.  Government is 
considering newer approaches such as results-based and output-based disbursement, in order to accelerate 
development results.  Vietnam‟s National Targeted Programs (NTPs) may be useful vehicles for this.  
During the CPS period, the Bank and Government will work to assess underlying fiduciary systems 
capacity and to diversify lending instruments for faster development impact.  The Bank will also continue 
to work jointly with the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and other donors to address systemic 
official development assistance (ODA) implementation issues and undertake analyses to learn from well-
performing provinces and sectors.  At the project level, the Bank and MPI are giving priority to 
improving project readiness for implementation, accelerating preparation, and managing the existing 
portfolio proactively.  A more streamlined results framework of this CPS will serve as a management tool 
for the Bank‟s Vietnam Country Team.   

12. 

Financing resources available to Vietnam during the new CPS period include an indicative 
FY12-FY14 IDA allocation of SDR 2.8 billion (equivalent to US$4.2 billion).  This is the largest 
allocation to Vietnam under any IDA Replenishment, in light of Vietnam‟s strong performance and the 
overall increase under the IDA 16 Replenishment.  As a blend country, Vietnam will also have access to 
modest IBRD resources.  Proposed FY12-FY14 IBRD commitments total US$770 million.  Most of the 
IBRD resources will be used to finance infrastructure investments. As Vietnam transitions to a more 
market-based economy with the private sector increasingly a driver of growth, IFC‟s program is expected 
to increase accordingly during the CPS period.  MIGA is engaging more actively in Vietnam. Its new 
instrument in support of public-private partnerships (PPPs) could be useful for the Government to 
mobilize international financing for priority infrastructure projects.  In addition to new IDA and IBRD 
commitments, resources available to Vietnam during the new CPS period include an undisbursed balance 
of US$5.7 billion (as of September 30, 2011) on the existing portfolio.  

13. 

Trust Funds (TFs) play a major role in the Vietnam program.  FY11 commitments and 
disbursements reached US$296 million and US$170 million, respectively.  The sources of trust funds are 
expected to change as donors shift their attention to newer areas of support or start to scale down in 
Vietnam.  Effective and efficient donor coordination will be important for minimizing gaps resulting from 
these shifts.  Selection criteria for TFs have been developed and will be applied more systematically to 
ensure strategic alignment.   

14. 

As several development partners will end ODA support to Vietnam during the next 5 years, 
the CPS will seek ways to support a smooth transition, including through offering financing 
vehicles for development partners as needed and as appropriate.  Partnerships with other 
development partners, notably large donors such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the 
Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and key bilateral collaborators such as the UK‟s 
Department for International Development (DFID) and the Australian Agency for International 

iii 

 
 
 
 
 
Development (AusAID), will be strengthened to enhance coordination and help Vietnam make further 
progress on its harmonization and broader aid effectiveness agenda.   

15. Monitoring of CPS implementation and results will be done annually .  Adjustments will be 
made to reflect emerging lessons.   

16. 

There are three main risks to implementation of the CPS program.  They are: (i) slowdown 
in the global economy, to be partially mitigated by continued dialogue with government agencies and 
stakeholders on how to build buffers to global shocks; (ii) heightened macroeconomic instability, to be 
partially mitigated by intensified and regular dialogue with Government in consultation with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), including a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP); and (iii) 
implementation risks, to be partially mitigated by capacity building for public financial management 
(PFM) and  procurement, work with Government on modernizing and simplifying the legal framework 
for management of Official Development Assistance (ODA), implementation of credible project 
governance and anti-corruption plans, and technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of Government 
entities and professions responsible for independent assurance.

Vietnam is a development success story.  Political and economic reforms (Đổi Mới) launched in 
1986 have transformed Vietnam from one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita income 
below US$100, to a lower middle income country within a quarter of a century.  The poverty headcount 
ratio has fallen from 58 percent in 1993 to 14.5 percent in 2008, and most indicators of welfare have 
improved.  Vietnam has already attained five of its ten original MDG targets and is well on the way to 
attaining two more by 2015 (see Annex 8).  At the end of 2010, Vietnam‟s per capita income was US$ 
1,130.  Vietnam has also been applauded for the equity of its development, which has been better than 
most other comparators.  The country is playing a more visible role on the regional and global stage, 
having successfully chaired the 2009 Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank 
Group and the IMF, and carried out the Chairmanship of the Association of South East Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) in 2010. 

A. RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

2. 
Vietnam’s most recent political transition (once every five years) formally began with the 
Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam in January 2011.  This was followed by 
elections for local Peoples‟ Councils and for the National Assembly in May 2011 and finally the 
endorsement of a new Cabinet by the new National Assembly in its first meeting in August 2011.  The 
process has also included discussion and agreement on the directions for Vietnam on politics, economic 
and social development, and on engagement with the region and the rest of the World.  The Congress 
called for a more comprehensive approach to the country‟s renovation, decided to promote greater 
citizens‟ participation and unity within Vietnam, and to engage proactively in international integration.  
The Congress re-affirmed Vietnam‟s approach to state-led development, but also revised key policy 
documents to place greater emphasis on market processes and non-state ownership of economic assets.   
Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng has been re-appointed to a second term of office, while the Party 
General Secretary, the President, and the Chairman of the National Assembly have changed.    

3. 
Over the last quarter of a century, Vietnam’s politics and society have gradually evolved 
towards greater openness and space for civil participation.  Public discourse on a range of political, 
social, and economic issues has increased.  Provisions are in place to require input by citizens in certain 
decisions at the grassroots level.  The ability of the National Assembly to perform the role of a check and 
balance on the executive has strengthened. Despite this progress, greater openness and opportunity for 
citizens to participate in governance is needed to support Vietnam‟s long term vision of becoming a 
modern industrialized society.   

4. 
In recent years, Vietnam has faced significant economic challenges, as it struggles to find its 
footing in a more integrated and turbulent world economy.  Steady integration into the global 
economy since WTO accession in 2007 has brought a higher flow of foreign direct investment and 
increased exports.  This integration has exposed Vietnam to increased commodity price volatility and 
financial turbulence in the global economy as well as the effects of growth slowdowns in North America 
and Europe.  With its market-based institutions still not uniformly developed and a slowdown in the 
reform effort, the country has found it increasingly difficult to cope with this new economic environment.  
Consequently, the economy has experienced periodic episodes of macroeconomic instability involving 
high levels of inflation, depreciation of the currency, and significant internal capital flight.  

5. 
The most recent episode of macroeconomic instability started in the second half of 2010, 
following delayed withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures introduced to deal with 
the impact of the global financial crisis.  In August 2011, inflation reached a 33-month high of 23 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percent, sovereign bond spreads hovered around 350-400 basis points, and foreign exchange cover was 
about two months of imports.  The health of the banking sector has remained a source of concern, in part 
because of the build-up of contingent liabilities in state-owned enterprises (SOEs).   

6. 
In early 2011, Government began implementing policy measures that have helped restore 
macroeconomic stability.  The dong was devalued by 9.3 percent against the US dollar on February 11, 
2011, and a stabilization package known as Resolution 11 was approved on February 24, 2011.  It 
contains a wide range of monetary and fiscal policy actions, and commits Government to undertake 
several structural measures, including reforming SOEs, improving communication of policy measures, 
and better protecting the poor from the impacts of macroeconomic instability.  Specific measures 
implemented since then include an increase of 600 basis points in the policy rate over a 7-month period, a 
significant reduction in the growth rate in credit and money supply for 2011 relative to 2010, a reduction 
in the fiscal deficit through higher revenue, and a cut in public investment expenditure.  A modest cash 
subsidy for the poor against electricity price hikes has also been put in place.   

7. 
The stabilization effort has delivered positive results.  In October 2011 monthly inflation eased 
to 0.36 percent from an average of 1.73 percent in the first nine months of 2011, the lowest level since 
August 2010.  Foreign exchange reserves are rising, and the exchange rate premium, as high as 11-12 
percent during the early months of 2011, has been nearly eliminated.  In the first seven months of 2011, 
the current account posted a US$1.3 billion surplus, compared to a deficit of US$3.2 billion during the 
same period last year, and the overall balance of payments (BOP) was reported to be in surplus by US$5 
billion.  There have been a number of equitizations1 of SOEs in the banking sector, and more are planned 
in the coming months.  Government has also initiated a review of SOEs‟ cross-holdings in state-owned 
commercial banks.  Economic growth has slowed but remains robust at 5.6 percent during the first half of 
2011. 

8. 
Implementation of Resolution 11 has had some shortcomings.  For example, efforts to rein in 
the investment budget have not been sufficiently spelled out, a roadmap for SOE reform is not yet in 
place, and communication of macroeconomic data and policy decisions is still slow and hesitant.   The 
pace of structural reforms has been somewhat slow, partly due to the fact that the country has been in a 
period of transition over the past 12 months, as part of its 5-year political cycle. Several important policy 
actions and pieces of new legislation were also deliberately held up until adoption of the new five year 
Socio-Economic Development Plan (2012-2016) expected in November of 2011.  The stabilization 
achievements to date demonstrate Vietnam‟s ability to address its macroeconomic challenges.  The 
government has indicated that it remains committed to implementing Resolution 11 and to supplementing 
it with further reforms in the months ahead to address the areas of weakness. This will be important for 
sustaining stability.   

B. REGIONAL AND GLOBAL CONTEXT2 

9. 
As one of the most open economies in the world, Vietnam will continue to be considerably 
affected by regional and global events.  International trade is equivalent to nearly 160 percent of 
Vietnam‟s gross domestic product (GDP).  Since WTO accession, Vietnam has received more net foreign 
direct investment commitments than Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand combined and the country‟s 
future is intricately linked to the health of its regional and global partners.  Since the last global economic 
crisis, the external environment that Vietnam faces has evolved rapidly and brought new opportunities 
and challenges.

10. 
Vietnam has developed strong ties in the region, which have delivered important economic 
benefits.  It became a member of ASEAN in 1995, and joined the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum in 1998.  Vietnam deepened regional integration efforts more recently by joining a series of Free 
Trade Agreements (FTAs) between ASEAN and Japan, China and Korea (ASEAN+1 FTAs).  ASEAN 
membership, together with accession to the WTO in 2007, should promote a better outcome to trade 
negotiations for Vietnam than if it were to negotiate bilaterally with larger neighboring economies.  
Vietnam‟s exports to the US and EU markets have steadily increased, but East Asian economies still 
account for roughly 40 percent of Vietnam‟s exports and over 60 percent of its imports.  In addition, 
around two-thirds of foreign investment in Vietnam is estimated to have come from East Asian countries.3  
Vietnam is also active in regional efforts to coordinate the use and management of the vast resources of 
the Mekong River.   

11. 
Serious tensions and risks persist in the post-crisis global economy.  In the short run, these 
could derail the recovery to differing degrees.  Continued very low interest rates in high -income countries 
could induce large and volatile flows of capital toward developing countries, including Vietnam, that 
contribute to destabilizing movements in exchange rates, food and commodity prices, and asset prices.  In 
this environment, the growing integration of Vietnam‟s manufacturing and agricultural sectors into the 
global economy has exposed them to wider demand and price volatility.  Longer-term risks center around 
the possibility that policy in the economies most directly hit by the crisis fail to shift focus from short -
term crisis management toward measures that address the underlying structural issues that contributed to 
the crisis in the first place.4 

C. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 

12. 
Stabilizing the economy is crucial to Vietnam’s medium-term growth prospects that 
otherwise remain strong.  Further interest rate increases in October 2011 and the scaling back of growth 
and investment targets demonstrate the Government‟s continued focus on macroeconomic stabilization.  
The conclusions of the October 2011 Communist Party Plenum recognized the need for economic 
restructuring and identified restructuring of public investment, of SOEs and the financial sector, as 
priorities for the next five years.  This suggests that the Government will take needed actions to return to a 
more sustainable macroeconomic environment while laying the foundations for greater efficiency and 
productivity to drive medium and longer-term growth.  

13. 
Vietnam’s economy is expected to gradually return to a more stable macroeconomic 
environment and sustain moderate to high growth rate in the medium-term.  The inflation rate, 
which peaked in August 2011, is expected to continue its downward trend in the coming months.  As 
shown in Table 1, end-of-period inflation in expected to reach 19 percent by December 2011 and 9 
percent by end of next year.  The economy is expected to grow at 5.8 percent during 2011, slower than 
2010, given the impact of stabilization measures.  With robust flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and 
planned restructuring of the economy, we expect industrial growth to remain relatively healthy in the 
medium-term.  Similarly, the agriculture sector should continue to do well as global food prices are 
projected to remain high in the coming years.  Overall, the growth rate of the economy is expected to 
gradually increase to 6.3 percent by 2013.  Assumptions underpinning these projections include no major 
disruption to the global economy, steady progress on structural reforms, improved implementation of 
infrastructure projects, and continued support from development partners and foreign investors.  In the

absence of these changes, growth could slow down but is unlikely to fall significantly below 5 percent – 
given the resilience of Vietnam‟s economy.

14. 
Vietnam’s public debt is likely to remain sustainable if the current economic recovery 
continues and the authorities carry on the current fiscal tightening.  The 2011 Debt Sustainability 
Analysis conducted by the Bank and the IMF shows public debt declining steadily from 52.8 percent of 
GDP in 2010, to 47.9 percent of GDP in 2015.  The large fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010 do not affect the 
overall debt sustainability significantly, as long as the government reverts to the pre-crisis levels of deficit 
in a few years as expected.  A loss of access to non debt-creating capital inflows and a slowdown of 
exports could adversely affect Vietnam‟s debt dynamics.  The standard assumptions applied for these 
shocks are severe, and unlikely to materialize. The largest source of uncertainty and hence, unquantifiable 
risk, to debt sustainability comes from implicit obligations which are not captured under public and 
publicly-guaranteed debt statistics.  Neither a clear definition nor a reliable estimate of such liabilities is 
available, limiting the government‟s ability to manage associated risks. Contingent liabilities might arise 
from off-budget statutory funds such as health insurance fund, large SOEs, and weaknesses in the 
financial sector.  Collecting reliable and up-to-date information on contingent liabilities and assessing 
their fiscal risks has become a priority for the Government and the Bank.

15. 
Vietnam has recently entered a new and higher phase of development.  Achieving success 
will require addressing residual challenges from the past, including advancing its transition to market and 
tackling emerging issues related to middle income status as well as more global challenges such as 
climate change.  The Bank agrees with the Government on the key challenges that need to be addressed 
over the next five years.  These include economic competitiveness, sustainability of growth, pockets of 
persistent poverty and rising inequality, vulnerability, and governance.  The Bank is confident that 
Vietnam can sustain past progress because of its policy priorities and its demonstrated performance.   

A.  COMPETITIVENESS   

16. 
Vietnam’s past rapid growth was made possible by improvements in competitiveness from 
earlier reforms and from progress in provision of economic infrastructure.  Vietnam‟s remaining 
reform agenda is still significant, particularly as regards the state corporate sector, and infrastructure 
access and quality increasingly lags the requirements of rapid growth as does the development of labor 
force skills. These factors constrain further improvements in competitiveness.  Vietnam‟s competitiveness 
was also derived primarily from low-cost labor and unsustainable use of its abundant natural resources.  
This advantage will inevitably diminish overtime.  For Vietnam to sustain its high growth record and 
avoid the so-called “middle income trap,” further reforms and investments are needed to tackle remaining 
inefficiencies in the economy, and strengthen competitiveness.  In addition, the bases for the economy‟s 
competitiveness will need to shift increasingly to higher productivity, product and process innovation, and 
value addition as its low-cost labor advantage dissipates.  Macroeconomic stability, a sound and resilient 
financial sector, and continued improvements to the investment climate will be critical to fostering 
business development and competition.    

17. 
The large SOE sector is an important part of Vietnam’s state-led economic model but has 
become a growing source of inefficiency, weak competitiveness, and a constraint to private 
enterprise development.  SOEs own and absorb a far greater share of the country‟s assets (land) and 
factors (domestic credit) than their share in national output. With recent rapid credit growth, the sector has 
become highly leveraged, and a source of risk to the banking sector. State-owned commercial banks 
(SOCBs) dominate the banking system (approximately half of the system), the largest accounting for 
nearly one sixth of the system.  Both their capital base and loan portfolio quality are weak.  The special 
privileges extended to SOEs make it more difficult for the private sector, large enterprises and small-
medium enterprises (SMEs) alike, to participate in certain key areas of the economy, thus inhibiting 
competition and associated productivity and efficiency gains.  Weak corporate governance, limited 
transparency/disclosure standards, and a passive monitoring and oversight framework further compound 
the risks.  Reforms are needed to remove inefficiencies , promote productivity of the SOE sector, and 
address weaknesses in the financial sector. 

18. 
Considerable private investment will be needed to raise productivity and value addition in 
Vietnam’s industry and agriculture and to begin to shift the country’s core competency from 
natural resource utilization to innovation and knowledge-base industry and services.  But the quality 
of Vietnam‟s infrastructure is low, and skilled labor is generally in short supply.  Though access to 
electricity is widespread, power cuts are frequent in certain parts of the country.  Other aspects of 
infrastructure quality, especially those related to transport and logistical services, also inhibit competitive 
investment. Vietnam has seen remarkable increases in enrolments at primary, secondary and tertiary 
levels but the quality of education needs to be strengthened and made more relevant to labor market 
needs.  This will help address the limited availability of graduates with the right sets of skills and 
competencies for productive employment. Challenges in how the education system is structured and 
managed and the way its resources are spent must be addressed. 
B. ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY  

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
19. 
Vietnam’s economic growth has generated environmental risks.  Population growth, 
industrialization, urbanization, and major changes in patterns of rural development have had adverse 
impacts.  This is most obvious in water, air, and biodiversity.  Water pollution is becoming more acute in 
many of the main rivers and coastal zones of the country, and this has a range of costs and impacts with 
regard to health, availability of clean water for industry and human use, and impacts on fisheries and 
conservation.  Insufficient investment and lack of sustainable financing for critical urban investments in 
drainage, water supply, solid waste management, urban transport, and urban sanitation are rapidly 
contributing to water and air pollution in urban areas.  Impacts on health due to suspended particulates 
and other pollutants are a growing concern for human health in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City 

20. 
Natural habitats are declining.  This loss of ecosystems, combined with poaching of wildlife, is 
leading to extinctions and loss of biodiversity, which also have economic consequences.  To address these 
issues, institutional strengthening is needed in three areas:  (i) systems and capacity to accurately measure 
the status of natural capital and economic returns; (ii) incorporation of environmental considerations into 
planning and decision making; and (iii) strengthening and enforcement of legal and regulatory 
frameworks.  

21. Much of Vietnam’s past growth has been derived from its natural resource wealth.  As 
Vietnam industrializes, its dependence on natural capital will diminish, yet  for the foreseeable future a 
significant part of Vietnam‟s wealth generation will depend on its natural resources,  and this is especially 
so for the poor.  A recent review of the state of Vietnam‟s natural resources and their management 
identified several issues5.  For example, marine capture fisheries, which contribute about 5 percent of 
Vietnam‟s GDP, are in decline, with decreasing yields and signs that some fisheries may be reaching 
tipping points into rapid decline.  Rapid expansion in aquaculture has brought with it major challenges in 
environmental and disease management.  Forest cover nationally is believed to be increasing slightly, yet 
there is also evidence of decrease in mature and native forests.  Vietnam‟s wood processing industries 
rely heavily on imported raw materials and could be exacerbating deforestation in other countries within 
the region.  Major challenges are emerging in relation to water resources management, with evidence of 
depletion of groundwater aquifers in the Mekong Delta and Central Highland regions and growing 
competition in water use among agriculture, aquaculture, conservation flows, industry, and human 
consumption.  Vietnam relies on international rivers for 60 percent of its surface water flow, and planned 
or proposed upstream investments could substantially alter water and sediment flows.  Dry -season water 
availability is already under pressure.  Climate change will accentuate these effects.  There are at present 
limited incentives for efficient water use and complex challenges of inter -provincial and other 
coordination of water resource management. 

C. POVERTY AND INEQUALITY 

22. 
Vietnam has an impressive record of sustained rapid poverty reduction over the past 20 
years.  The poverty headcount (percent living below the poverty line) fell from 58 percent in 1993 to 14.5 
percent in 20086 (Figure 1).  Preliminary results from the 2010 Vietnam Household Living Standard 
Survey (VHLSS) suggest continued progress at reducing poverty.  Poverty reduction has been 
accompanied by widespread access to basic services, including primary and lower secondary education, 
electricity, and clean water supply.  Workers are moving out of agriculture into more highly paid 
employment in services, trade, and industry:  in 2002, 56 percent of the labor force reported working in

Office (GSO).

agriculture, almost exclusively on their own farms; by 2010 the share of labor force in agriculture had 
fallen to 41 percent.  Vietnam has already achieved five of its ten original MDG targets – those related to 
reduced poverty and hunger, gender equality in school enrollment, reduced maternal mortality, and 
malaria control.  Two more – those related to universal primary education and reduced child mortality – 
are likely to be achieved.  However, progress has been slower on the other three targets – those linked to 
ensuring environmental sustainability; access to hygienic sanitation in rural areas, despite good progress 
in ensuring access to clean drinking water, and reducing the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, albeit low at 0.28 
percent for all age groups in 2010 (see Annex 8).

23. 
The impressive national averages mask differences across regions and social groups, and an 
emerging issue is signs of rising inequality.  There is a large and growing gap in income and non-
income indicators of well-being between the poorest households and the better off, as well as a persistent 
gap between different regions of the country and between urban and rural households. The rich-poor gap 
(ratio of average income in the richest 20 percent of the population to the poorest 20 percent of the 
population) has risen from 8.1 in 2002 to 9.2 in 2010.7 Opportunities for the rural population are 
diminished by their more limited access to basic services and to financial, land, and information 
resources.  Rural-urban migration, an important source of growth as people shift from less to more 
productive employment, is expanding the pressures on urban infrastructure and services, while 
employment in urban and peri-urban areas creates new vulnerabilities with less stable jobs and a rapidly 
rising cost of urban living.  A significant share of the poor and vulnerable today resides in and around 
Vietnam‟s greater metropolitan areas.  With rapid urbanization and a common use of eminent domain to 
meet the land demand for urban development, land acquisition and conversion can have considerable 
negative social impacts. 

24. 
Poverty has become increasingly concentrated among ethnic minorities, who make up 
nearly 15 percent of the population.  In 2008, 50 percent of minorities lived below the poverty line, 
compared to only 9 percent of Kinh-Hoa majorities.  By 2010, ethnic minorities accounted for 65 percent 
of individuals in the poorest welfare decile, up from 53 percent in 2006.  Children from minority 
households are less likely to attend school, particularly at upper secondary levels, which perpetuates low 
incomes and persistent poverty across generations.

25. 
Systemic changes in the human development sectors are needed to address Vietnam’s 
poverty agenda, as are further efforts to improve livelihood opportunities.  A renewed effort is 
necessary to promote equality in outcomes for all, and to close wide and growing attainment and learning 
gaps between the poor and non-poor and between ethnic minorities and the Kinh majority.  A more 
results-oriented education system can equip Vietnamese workers with the skills to take advantage of the 
new opportunities and manage the employment risks that come with a changing labor market, while social 
and health insurance can help to shield people better from the worst shocks impacting employment.  
Vietnam currently lacks a basic cash transfer program for the poor, which is an important gap in its 
poverty reduction and social assistance system.  A strengthened social safety net can help the chronic 
poor, respond better to shocks (including natural hazards or shocks affecting domestic prices), and 
address household liquidity constraints that, inter alia, lead to early school drop-out. Cash transfers linked 
to education can thus be an important complementary tool to bridge the gaps in enrolment rates at every 
level.8 Moreover, further upgrades in basic infrastructure and public service delivery and access, 
including facilitating wider participation in labor and product markets, are needed to improve livelihood 
opportunities in rural areas and disadvantaged communities. 

26. 
Vietnam has made substantial progress in closing some important gender gaps, but key 
challenges still remain (see Annex 9).  No poverty gap exists between men and women in the overall 
population, although poverty among the elderly is disproportionately among widows.  Net enrolment rates 
are higher for girls than for boys in primary and secondary education and women have slightly higher 
rates of tertiary enrolment.  Employment rates for men and women aged 25 -64 were fairly close at 93.8 
percent and 87.8 percent, respectively.9  But there are gender gaps in wage levels, and women are less 
likely to have wage employment and more likely to be involved in own account work.  Fifty six percent 
of men are engaged in wage employment compared to 37 percent of women, and estimates suggest that 
women in the informal economy earn 50 percent of male wages despite similar working hours, education 
levels, and seniority.10  There is also a large degree of occupational and industrial segregation across the 
labor force.  Impressive improvements have been made in the areas of child and infant mortality.  Gender 
based violence remains an important issue and is rising.  

D. VULNERABILITY 

27. 
Vietnam is facing rising vulnerabilities.  The country is more vulnerable to macroeconomic 
instability, and to the dual challenge of natural hazards and the impacts of climate change.  Household 
vulnerability has therefore increased as well, especially with the rise in migration to urban areas and 
resulting changes in employment patterns. 

28. 
Vietnam’s economy remains exposed to a number of external shocks and domestic policy 
risks. Deeper integration into the global economy coupled with a highly open economy has meant that 
global shocks are transmitted with full force into Vietnam‟s economy, with effects on household living 
standards and employment prospects.  This implies more macroeconomic turbulence for Vietnam‟s 
economy. On the domestic front, Vietnam faces two major risks.  One is its policy prefe rence for growth 
over macroeconomic stability, giving rise to accommodating fiscal and monetary policy stances.  The 
other is the gradual build-up of contingent liabilities in the system owing to the inefficiencies in the state -
owned enterprises and their close links to the banking sector.

Box 1: Urbanization Opportunities and Challenges 

Vietnam has a low level of urbanization compared to many other countries in Asia, but its urban population has 
begun to grow.  The country is in an incipient stage of urbanization, transitioning to an intermediate stage with 
rapid urbanization (currently 30 percent urban and 3.4 percent urban population growth per year).   

The urbanization process is running in tandem with strong economic growth. Nearly half of Vietnam‟s economic 
output is generated in its six largest urban centers (Hanoi, HCMC, Hai Phong, Da Nang, Can Tho and Baria -Vung 
Tau) with a total population of approximately 18.5 million people. Ho Chi Minh City and the Southeast region 
host nearly half (45 percent) of overall manufacturing production.  However, heavy and fast growing (higher tech, 
higher value added) manufacturing activity is more intense in the Hanoi and the Red River Delta Region than in 
HCMC and the Southeast Region (55 percent and 39 percent, respectively).  Industrialization is rapidly 
progressing in Hanoi and the Red River Delta region due to its proximity to the industrial bases in South China. 
While urbanization is likely to continue to bring strong benefits to Vietnam in terms of economic growth, greater 
economic opportunity, and higher productivity, Government will need to manage the trade-offs that will come 
with rapid urbanization.  There is the potential of congestion costs, regional inequalities and rising land and 
housing prices.  Urban poverty and its social impacts can increase, and secondary cities, often with less capacity, 
have the potential to grow rapidly.  Vietnam‟s urban planning system continues to be overly based on design 
principles rather than facilitating the fluidity of land and housing markets and urban mobility.  Nevertheless, cities 
still enjoy relatively good mobility, due in large part to the nearly universal use of the mot orbike as the primary 
means of transportation and traditional highly mixed use land development patterns.  But this is changing rapidly, 
and increased car use would eventually lead to gridlock as a result of current capacity and road designs.  While 
there are plans for urban transport systems in most major cities, a near universal preference for personal transport 
will compete with plans for urban transit systems.   

29. 
Household vulnerability is on the rise due to demographic changes and the recent period of 
economic turbulence and rising inflation.  Farmers face volatile commodity prices, are exposed to 
frequent climate related shocks (floods, droughts, cold spells), and have been adversely affected by 
endemic animal diseases.  Workers in urban areas, including many rural migrants, were hit by job losses 
and falling wages in late 2008 and 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis.  While job opportunities 
have improved, fuel and food costs have risen sharply, and there are widespread concerns about potential 
increases in poverty in urban areas.  Vietnam has various targeted poverty reduction and area -based 
infrastructure and livelihoods programs, some of which have remained unchanged for the last decade.  As 
the country continues to grow and its economy changes, the measures included under these programs are 
at risk of becoming less relevant for addressing its changing poverty and vulnerability challenges.  New 
solutions, including in social protection, will need to be developed, based on an updated understanding of 
Vietnam‟s poverty situation.  

30. 
Located in the tropical monsoon area in South East Asia, Vietnam is one of the most 
hazard-prone areas in the Asia Pacific Region.  Major storms, flood events, and other natural hazards 
result in annual economic losses equivalent to between 1 percent and 1.5 percent of GDP. Infrastructure 
and people are increasingly concentrated in vulnerable areas such as floodplains and coastal areas, 
suggesting that disaster-related losses will increase in the future. River plain flooding is extensive and 
prolonged throughout the wet season in the large deltas. Most of Vietnam‟s 2,360 rivers are short and 
steep, so that heavy rainfall in their basins produces brief but intense floods. Sizeable portions of the 
country, especially the Central Highlands and Central Coast, are subject to heavy rainfall.  An average of 
six to eight typhoons or tropical storms of varying intensity strike Vietnam each year, with more frequent 
occurrences in the northern and central coastal region earlier in the season.  Notable achievements in 
effective ex-post disaster response need to be matched by enhanced capacity in preparedness and risk 
reduction.  

31. 
Climate change and variability are posing a serious challenge to development in Vietnam, 
with an array of complex and interrelated consequences for every sector of society.  Current models 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
point to potentially significant impacts on economic activity and/or human health directly resulting from 
progressive temperature increases, changes in rainfall patterns, sustained sea level rise, and potential 
shifts in the frequency, severity, and geography of extreme weather events .  These changes would have 
the greatest impacts on low-lying urban areas, coastal areas, river basins vulnerable to storm damage, and 
agricultural sectors. By the end of this century, a sea level rise of between 25 centimeters to 1 meter (from 
a baseline sea level as of 2000) is possible.  The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment 
(MONRE) has estimated that a sea level rise of 65 cm could inundate about 13 percent of the Mekong 
Delta. 

E. GOVERNANCE  

32. Weaknesses in institutional capacity and public sector management continue to constrain 
Vietnam’s development.  A key aspect of Vietnam‟s evolving institutional landscape is the move from a 
highly centralized hierarchical system consistent with central planning, to one where many decisions are 
decentralized.  This devolution of authority has taken place along economic lines (to private economic 
entities), along geographical lines (to provinces and lower levels of government) and along functional 
lines (to hospitals, schools and other service providers).  Capacity building at the local level has not kept 
pace with decentralization.  

33. 
Improvements in basic public service delivery and access are especially needed for 
Vietnam’s poor, vulnerable, or otherwise disadvantaged people.  Even where policies adopted by the 
central government reflect good international practice, implementation at the local level is often 
undermined by limited planning, implementation, and reporting capacities.  Delivery capacity constraints 
are particularly evident in disadvantaged provinces where many of the most vulnerable Vietnamese 
citizens reside.   

34. 
 The accountability system in Vietnam still relies primarily on upward accountability 
through the hierarchy, resulting in a system that encourages excessive risk aversion. Officials rarely 
act without explicit authority to do so, as innovation and pro-activity may yield greater risks than benefits.  
From schools to hospitals, the need to strengthen accountability in a way that encourages innovation and 
performance is a running theme in Vietnam.  Diversifying the accountability system toward mechanisms 
of downward accountability is being experimented with on a small scale.   In addition, grievance redress 
mechanisms are underdeveloped.  Moreover, with little awareness of legal rights and the lack of effective 
mechanisms to demand better services, the citizenry is not well placed to provide pressure from below. 

35. Within the system of hierarchical accountability, the official channels face their own 
challenges.  In the move to a more devolved system of governance, the system of accountability is 
shifting, but not in equal measure and not always in the most efficient form. 11   Decentralized structures 
for looking into corruption can put investigators in the difficult position of examining those with authority 
over their work.  The courts are not widely used and provide little external oversight over the executive.  
The National Assembly, which has been playing an increasingly active role in external oversight, is 
nevertheless characterized by high turnover and with a majority of deputies simultaneously holding 
positions in government.   

36. 
Vietnam has made progress in improving transparency, but challenges remain.  With 
increasing penetration of the internet and other media, information and opinions are more widely 
available than ever.  At the same time, it is difficult for Vietnamese citizens to access information from 

11 This is the central theme of the Vietnam Development Report (VDR) 2010—Modern Institutions.  

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
state bodies, and this in turn constrains public oversight of government -provided services and functions.  
Although several laws call for documents of various kinds to be public information, these documents are 
often difficult to obtain in practice.   

37. 
Governance and corruption issues are openly discussed in Vietnam.  While there are areas of 
progress, there is concern over corruption.  The 2008 VHLSS Governance Module found that two of three 
respondents believed corruption to be a serious problem, and only a small percentage thought things were 
improving.  This does not necessarily mean that corruption in all its forms is getting worse.  For example, 
firms that participated in the World Bank‟s enterprise survey in 2005 and again in 2009 gave, on average, 
lower assessments of corruption as a problem when doing business, although the percentage saying they 
paid bribes and the amounts they reported paying did not decline12.  The enterprise surveys show that 
unofficial payments are common in many sectors.  When asked for innovative proposals for fighting 
corruption as part of Vietnam Innovation Day 2009, most proposals addressed imbalances in awareness 
and access to information. 

III. GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES 

38. 
The Government’s development vision for the next decade, laid out in its SEDS 2011-2020, 
directly responds to all of the development challenges discussed above .  The SEDS identifies key 
priorities for the country, including a long-term growth strategy that gives attention to structural reforms 
environmental sustainability, social equity, and emerging issues of macroeconomic stability to minimize 
short-term vulnerability and achieve sustained long-term growth. Three major “breakthrough areas” are 
noted in the SEDS:  (i) promoting human resources/skills development (particularly skills for modern 
industry and innovation), (ii) improving market institutions, and (iii) infrastructure development.  The key 
challenges will be improved design of programs and better implementation. 

39. 
The SEDS aims to maximize Vietnam’s long-term welfare through rapid growth in 
conjunction with sustainable development.  Rapid growth is expected to be achieved not only through 
increased use of labor, natural resources, and capital, but also by relying more on an improved efficiency 
of resource utilization and allocation, and technical progress.  The SEDS identifies three key determinants 
for sustainable development, namely macroeconomic stability, broad-based growth, and environmental 
sustainability.  Institutional and policy changes are proposed to achieve the ultimate goal through 
completing the transition to a market economy and building modern state governance.   

40. 
The overall goal of the SEDS is for Vietnam to lay the foundations for a modern, 
industrialized society by 2020.  The strategy sets out directions for how Vietnam should continue the 
transformation from a largely agrarian society to an industrialized, modern nation.  The document 
highlights some critical areas that will help Vietnam achieve this goal, including sustainable development, 
improvements in market institutions, and democracy. 

41. 
A five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP 2011-2015) was approved by the 
National Assembly in November 2011.  It elaborates the objectives of the SEDS and identifies the 
specific measures and resources that are needed for its implementation.  The SEDP 2011-2015 focuses on 
the broad range of policies needed to achieve high quality and sustainable economic growth.  These 
include the need to restructure the economy to increase the share of high value-adding economic 
activities, improve the living standards of ethnic minority populations, strengthen environmental 
protection, and mitigate and prevent the adverse impacts of climate change.  The Plan underlines the need 

12 Source: World Bank enterprise surveys 

11 

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
to develop favorable conditions for the private sector and to gradually reduce the contribution of the state 
sector to GDP, while increasing the contribution from the private sector and FDI. Focusing on the same 
three breakthrough areas as the SEDS, the SEDP describes how these breakthroughs will be achieved in 
order to create a more competitive economy.  The SEDP also outlines the importance of environmental 
protection, climate change mitigation, and adaption and building resilience to natural hazards.  Compared 
to the SEDP 2006-2010, the new Plan reflects an increased awareness of the risks of environmental and 
natural resource degradation. The SEDP could have been clearer in two areas: (i) the importance of 
identifying explicit trade-offs in priorities and proposed policy measures, particularly in light of real 
resource constraints; and (ii) the need for greater coherence, integration and linkages between the national 
SEDP, provincial SEDPs, and sector plans being developed by the ministries. 

42. 
Through a CPS program aligned with the overall strategic priorities and goals set out in the 
SEDP and SEDS, the World Bank Group will work with Government to address directly the 
development agenda set out above.  The World Bank Group‟s engagement will support the three 
breakthrough areas of the SEDS and SEDP of promoting human resources, improving market institutions, 
and advancing infrastructure development.  Following the cycle of the SEDP and thus the CPS, Vietnam 
is currently developing a new Strategic Framework for ODA for 2011-2015.  The ODA Strategic 
Framework prioritizes how ODA resources are to be spent within each of the SEDP‟s three breakthrough 
areas.  The Framework identifies priority targets from the SEDP in the areas of economic, social and 
environmental development which ODA should contribute to meeting.  The Bank will contribute to 
reaching these targets through its existing portfolio, new operations, and analytical work organized 
around a CPS Results Framework aligned with SEDP and ODA Strategic Framework targets (see Annex 
1). 

IV. VIETNAM-WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP 

A. LESSONS AND FEEDBACK 

Lessons from the CPS Completion Report  

43. 
The FY07-FY11 CPS Completion Report concludes that overall, the Vietnam program has 
delivered most of what was planned in the CPS, and the Bank has played a key supportive role in 
the development success of Vietnam (see Annex 2).  As discussed above, Vietnam reached its key 
strategic objective (as outlined in the SEDP 2006-2010) of reaching middle income status by 2010.  The 
country became IBRD eligible in 2007 and received its first IBRD loan in 2009.  IFC activities increased 
considerably throughout the period.  The process of building institutions for a modern market economy 
continued, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated in the CPS.    

44. 
The Completion Report rates the program performance as moderately satisfactory.  Across a 
range of engagement areas, the CPS program achieved results in line with expectations, however, in other 
areas, outcomes were only partially achieved due to delays or other obstacles.  World Bank Group 
performance is rated as satisfactory. The Bank responded promptly and effectively to unexpected events, 
such as the food and global financial crises and is responding to emerging concerns such as climate 
change.  IFC engagement maintained a strategic focus on the quality of the business environment and 
finance, while investments more than tripled towards the end of the period , with a particular focus on 
crisis response. Innovative components were introduced in the design of several Bank projects, thereby 
setting the foundation for enhanced impact. Delivery improved with a shorter lag between Board approval 
and effectiveness, but slow implementation (reflected in low disbursement ratios and extensions of project 
closing dates) remains an issue.  

12 

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
45. 
A number of recommendations for the next CPS have emerged from the Completion Report 
and have been directly factored into the design of the new CPS: (i) the WBG needs to respond to the 
emerging vulnerabilities and challenges in Vietnam; (ii) the WBG should maintain a demand-driven focus 
within a framework of selectivity that prioritizes the WBG‟s comparative advantages; (iii) the principles 
guiding selectivity need to be tightened to avoid diffusing the Bank‟s program too thinly; (iv) attention to 
implementation should be complemented with greater attention to program and project design; (v) 
attention should be given to decentralization issues; (vi) commitments on institutional reform should be 
credible and have as much government ownership as possible, while still pushing to move the agenda 
forward; (vii) engagement areas for second generation policy reforms should be chosen more selectively , 
as evidenced by challenges experienced with later operations in the PRSC series;  and (viii) the results 
framework could be used more forcefully as a tool for setting strategic priorities and monitoring 
accountability.  

Feedback from Country Survey  

46. 
In May and June 2010, 335 stakeholders in Vietnam participated in a Country Survey13  
(see Annex 14).   More than half of respondents were from government, while other respondents 
represented academia, bilateral or multilateral agencies, non-government organizations (NGOs) and 
media, private sector, and the National Assembly.  Respondents indicated that Vietnam‟s most important 
development priorities are governance, economic growth, and infrastructure development, while the 
highest priorities for Bank support are poverty reduction, governance, environment, infrastructure, 
climate change, and economic growth and integration.14 The survey results indicate positive attitudes 
toward the Bank and its work in Vietnam, with a favorable rating of 7.7 out of 10 for the Bank‟s overall 
effectiveness in the country, but they also point to areas for improvement.  Results indicate that the Bank 
needs to further enhance its impact in the social sectors, governance, private sector development, climate 
change, and poverty reduction.  The Bank‟s financing and knowledge services are seen to be its value 
added, while its weaknesses relate to inflexibility (e.g., making recommendations that do not take 
sufficient account of political realities or local conditions, and having bureaucratic policies and 
procedures).  It is hoped that the Bank‟s decentralization in recent years will help to help to address these 
concerns by increasing the Bank‟s understanding of the local context and its responsiveness.     

Feedback from CPS Consultations 

47. 
Stakeholder consultations on the new CPS were held at three stages aligned with key 
milestones in CPS preparation.  The consultations were aimed at:  (i) enhancing broad understanding 
and support for the CPS; (ii) engaging with stakeholders in line with the principles of the Paris 
Declaration and Hanoi Core Statement; and (iii) benefiting from the insights of a broad group of 
stakeholders with knowledge and understanding of the country context.  The consultation process started 
upstream during CPS preparation.  The first round of consultations was held in January 2011 (prior to 
initiating the drafting process), where the Bank convened a relatively small group of targeted counterparts 
with day-to-day experience of working with the Bank to elicit their views on key priori ty areas for the 
Bank in the next five years, how the Bank could address these areas and what it could do differently in the 
future.  The second round was undertaken in June 2011, when stakeholders gave feedback on a CPS 
Concept Paper, and at the third round, held in October 2011, stakeholders commented on a draft of the 
CPS document (see Annex 15). 

13 46 percent response rate. Country Surveys are conducted prior to preparation of each CPS in Vietnam.  Li ke is the case for the 
CPS itself, the Country Survey follows a five-year cycle to align with the Government‟s five-year planning cycle.  Survey 
questions are in multiple choice and ranking formats. 
14 Priorities are listed in descending order.

B. CPS PRINCIPLES OF ENGAGEMENT 

48. 
The Bank’s assistance to Vietnam has had considerable positive impact. However, a 
combination of factors – rapid program growth in recent years, slow implementation at start-up,15 and the 
Bank‟s flat country program budget – has highlighted the need for the Bank to improve its business model 
for greater impact.  The CPS program will therefore aim to:  (i) sharpen strategic focus and reduce 
dispersion; (ii) improve operational efficiency; and (iii) accelerate implementation for more timely 
results.   

49. 
The Bank’s strategic focus has been compromised by engagement across a large number of 
sectors and sub-sectors.  Operational efficiency has not been maximized, given (i) significant reliance on 
a retail approach that channels the Bank‟s financing through a large number of traditional sector 
investment operations under implementation in all of Vietnam‟s 63 provinces,16 with inadequate attention 
to synergy of interventions at the provincial level; (ii) cumbersome project implementation ar rangements 
involving the creation of several new implementing entities with each new project, with the result that 
during implementation the Bank has multiple sub-national entities as project counterparts; and (iii) an 
AAA program that does not adequately leverage Bank financing to influence Government policy and the 
way Government uses its own resources.  Timely impact is impeded by long preparation and 
implementation periods for investment operations.  This means significant opportunity cost of delayed 
results.  As of August 31, 2011, the undisbursed portfolio was about US$5.8 billion, 48 percent of which 
was committed in FY08 or earlier.  Delays can also lead to project cost escalation, which diverts 
resources from new initiatives to additional financing and reduces project rates of return. 

50. 
To sharpen strategic focus and decrease dispersion, the Bank’s new CPS program will aim 
to gradually increase lending program consolidation, use more programmatic AAA, and introduce 
more selectivity.  The average size of Vietnam‟s IDA-only operations increased only slightly from 
$109.3 million during IDA 14 to $115.2 million during IDA 15, peaking at $143.6 million in FY09. 
Achieving larger sized operations will require more wholesale approaches including working through 
Government programs.  The ongoing shift to programmatic AAA will be continued to facilitate more 
strategic coherence within the AAA program. 

51. 
Greater selectivity will be achieved through the application of clear criteria for inclusion in 
the program.  Such criteria will include focusing on areas where:  (i) the Bank has a real comparative 
advantage vis-à-vis other partners; (ii) the likelihood of sustainable impact through eventual replication 
without ODA funding is high; (iii) there is a track record of successful project implementation at the 
provincial level; and (iv) there are opportunities to leverage systemic and/or institutional change.  The 
discipline needed for more selectivity will be facilitated by a more systematic and forward-looking 
engagement with Government to plan the lending program.  

52. 
Selectivity will also be achieved over time through exit strategies, sequencing, and intra-
WBG coordination.  In some sectors the agenda is largely complete (e.g., rural electrification), and Bank 
support will be discontinued.  Support will also be phased out in areas where the Bank has had consistent 
difficulties (e.g., large IT-based operations).  Clearer division of responsibilities with IFC will also be 
important.  For example, Bank support for private sector engagement in renewable energy will be phased 
out as the IFC program expands.  Proper sequencing of support in some sectors will also help reduce 

15 Vietnam has had an interesting pattern of implementation:  a very slow pace during the first 24 months, and an average pace 
thereafter. 
16 Of the 78 operations under implementation during the FY07 -FY11 CPS period, 85 percent were sector investment credits or 
loans. 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
dispersion.  For example, in the financial sector, towards the end of the CPS period for the World Bank 
the focus will move from financial infrastructure (e.g., payment systems) to access and market 
development issues.  Finally, the Bank will work with Government to bring more competition in selecting 
provinces to participate in projects.  Clear criteria will be used, including implementation performance of 
the existing portfolio at the provincial level.  Given considerable current dispersion and lengthy 
implementation periods, the impact of this effort at greater selectivity will only become appreciably 
visible over time (likely beyond this new CPS period).   

53. 
To improve operational efficiency, the CPS program will leverage the Bank’s resources 
through increased use of systemic and “wholesale” approaches in the Bank’s delivery of financing.  
In contrast to the more traditional approach of ring-fencing at the project level, systemic approaches 
would include support for Government programs such as Vietnam‟s NTPs, provincial level programs and 
strategically integrated (multi-sectoral) approaches to Bank assistance at the provincial level, increased 
use of financial intermediaries and programmatic approaches to lend to cities to meet their local 
infrastructure needs, and the introduction of results-based approaches to project design.  This would 
provide greater opportunity to influence the way the governments (national and provincial) spend their 
own resources and also strengthen capacity needed to achieve and sustain a program‟s results.  In 
addition, the Bank has begun discussions with Government on options for consolidating PMUs within 
provinces and line ministries. This could yield significant efficiency gains and more sustainable 
capacity.17    

54. 
The Bank will intensify efforts to leverage its lending resources through strengthened policy 
dialogue and AAA that better inform the structural reform agenda to be supported by DPOs, as 
well as investment project design, especially in new areas of engagement.  An effort will be made to 
identify and include in the AAA program issues that preoccupy policy makers on which the Bank has 
expertise.  The Bank will seek more opportunities to partner with local think tanks and other Government 
agencies in such work in order to enhance chances of impact.  Dissemination will be more systematic 
using strategic communication approaches and reaching beyond the executive to the legislat ive bodies 
and broader Vietnamese society.  Growing priority will be given to just-in-time policy notes.  This will 
call for flexible, nimble programming of AAA work.   

55. 
The Bank will also leverage its resources by making more use of opportunities for synergies 
in the CPS program across the World Bank Group and with other development partners .  
Collaboration within the World Bank Group is expected to increase, as Vietnam continues its middle 
income transition and the role of the private sector continues to increase.  IBRD and IFC will strengthen 
collaboration to complement respective programs, particularly in infrastructure, agribusiness, and the 
financial sector.  Increased use of MIGA guarantees can offer reassurance for foreign investors, including 
investors into PPPs, especially those concerned about regulatory risks.  MIGA is working to establish a 
long-term relationship with the Government in support of the PPP agenda.  The Bank Group will also 
continue to leverage assistance through more strategic partnerships with other development partners such 
as our existing highly successful partnership with UK DFID on poverty, governance and climate change 
and the upcoming partnership with AusAID on infrastructure and Economic Reform.  In addition, 
country-level IDA resources will be leveraged through two regional operations for natural resource 
management (water and biodiversity, respectively), in collaboration with other countries in Southeast 
Asia.  

17 Bank-financed projects have spawned PMUs in all 63 provinces of Vietnam.  The Sustainable Development program alone 
accounts for well over 200. 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
56. 
The program will also leverage support through various global and regional initiatives in 
which Vietnam is participating.  Examples include the Water and Sanitation Program, the Global 
Program for Output-Based Aid, the Cities Alliance, and the initiatives related to disaster-resilient cities 
and agro-weather advisory services supported by the Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery 
(GFDRR). 

57. WBI will contribute to the CPS program by focusing on addressing key capacity 
development needs in three areas: (i) Vietnam's transition to a more urban and industrialized economy, 
by supporting Government's efforts to strengthen planning and management of cities to promote more 
sustainable urban development as an engine of growth; (ii) strengthening governance and legislative 
institutional capacities through WBI‟s Parliamentary Strengthening Program; and (iii) health sector 
analysis, policy and reform.  Additionally, WBI will leverage its south-south platforms to promote 
knowledge and experience sharing between Vietnam and other countries within and outside the East Asia 
and Pacific Region, such as the regional/multi-country Leadership Programs and distance and e-learning 
activities around WBI's core thematic areas. 

58. 
To strengthen its impact, the Bank will continue efforts to accelerate implementation of the 
existing portfolio, with emphasis on improving project start-up for all new operations.  These efforts 
will include continued collaboration between MPI and the Six Banks Group18 to address systemic ODA 
implementation issues, replication of good practices in well-performing provinces and sectors, and 
project-level initiatives with MPI.  (See “Monitoring Program Implementation” below.)   

C. CPS ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND EXPECTED RESULTS 

Strategic Engagement Overview 

59. 
Building on Vietnam's strong track record of growth and poverty reduction, the World 
Bank Group will partner with Vietnam in its effort to achieve success as a middle income country.  
The CPS directly supports Government‟s 2011-2020 SEDS and 2011-2015 SEDP, and is guided by the 
key challenges set out above.  The CPS program will support selected elements of this multi-faceted 
transition notably, from an agrarian economy toward one that is more urban and industrialized; from a 
focus on quantity toward a greater focus on quality of production and service provision; from a 
comparative advantage of low-cost labor, with low value added, to one with a growing share of 
innovation-led and higher value-added production and services and towards a greater role for  market 
mechanisms in allocating capital and resources to an increasingly important private sector .  In line with 
the thrust of the Government's five-year SEDP the CPS program will support investments and policies 
aimed at (i) strengthening Vietnam's competitiveness in the regional and global economy, (ii) increasing 
the sustainability of its development, and (iii) broadening access to economic and social opportunity.  
These three areas form the pillars of the strategic framework of the CPS.  Three strategic themes cut 
across the three pillars.  The CPS program will support efforts to (i) strengthen governance, (ii) promote 
gender equality, and (iii) improve resilience in the face of external economic and climatic shocks.  (See 
Figure 2.) 

18 The Six Banks Group consists of ADB, JICA, AFD, KfW, Korea EXIM and the World Bank.  The Group jointly identifies and 
addresses implementation  issues in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and Investment.  Progress is being made in 
common feasibility guidelines, mainstreaming of a common reporting framework, increasing the Ministry of Finance‟s cost 
norms for local consultants, piloting of advance procurement actions, and TA for contract management and procurement (the 
latter two with IDF funding).

 Pillar 1 on competitiveness will address: (a) Vietnam‟s vulnerability to macroeconomic 
instability which has structural roots in distortions in the SOE and financial sectors and in 
weaknesses in public financial management; (b) the low quality of key infrastructure services due 
to inefficiencies in power distribution and transmission and in water and transport sectors; (c) low 
value addition in Vietnamese production; and (d) weak innovation capacity and the related low 
skills base of the Vietnamese labor force.  Accountability gaps exacerbated by decentralization 
and transparency in public financial management are among the governance challenges to be 
addressed under this pillar. 

 Pillar 2 on sustainability will focus on management of water resource and land; conservation of 
forests and biodiversity; pollution control and the related issue of low connectivity to sanitation 
systems; mitigation and adaptation measures in light of Vietnam‟s high vulnerability to climate 
change; and disaster risk management in light of the country‟s increasing exposure to risks posed 
by extreme weather events.  The CPS program under this pillar will address governance 
weaknesses such as unclear and conflicting jurisdiction which undermines enforcement of 
environmental regulation, and limited access to information which undermines accountability. 

 Pillar 3 on opportunity will support the development and implementation of government policies 
to ensure that more citizens can benefit from the country‟s development as a MIC.  This will 
involve efforts to address rising inequality, especially between ethnic minorities and the rest of 
Vietnam‟s population, and between urban and rural households; policy reform and institutional 
strengthening for social insurance and social safety nets to reduce vulnerability at the household 
level; weaknesses in basic public service delivery and access; and gender equality, a special 
theme for IDA 16.  

60. 
Governance is being mainstreamed as a priority cutting across the three CPS pillars.  The 
approach to mainstreaming will be based on the following three principles:  (i) systematically leveraging 
the Bank‟s lending and analytical activities to support improved governance in Vietnam; (ii) improving 
project performance by better understanding and addressing in a meaningful (as opposed to mechanical) 
way the issues that pose governance risks to the achievement of projects‟ development outcomes; and (iii) 
sustaining the effort, including by making periodic adjustments if the approach is not working (see Box 
2).  This should lead to a more comprehensive approach to governance, as recommended in the CPS 
Completion Report. 

61. 
Gender will be a second cross-cutting theme in the strategic framework of the CPS. The 
approach is informed by two recently completed initiatives.  One is the Bank‟s internal assessment (a 
Country Gender Action Plan) of how it could address gender issues more effectively in the CPS program, 
and the other is the Vietnam Country Gender Assessment, conducted by the Bank in collaboration with 
other development partners and Government.  (See Annex 9.)  The Bank‟s support to gender in the CPS 
has four key elements:  (i) to support Government in improving the implementation of the Law on Gender 
Equality and the National Strategy on Gender Equality, in part by building gender awareness and capacity 
within relevant ministries; (ii) to support the development of a national gender data system by building on 
the recent development of the National Gender Statistical Indicator System; (iii) to apply a gender lens to 
identify opportunities to integrate gender more systematically into Bank operations, as was done in the 
Third Rural Transport Project (see Box 3), including by making the systematic collection of data 
disaggregated by gender a guiding principle; and (iv) to help close the knowledge gap through 
quantitative and qualitative research on gender issues. All of these areas of action are cross-cutting in 
nature and impact.

Box 2: Mainstreaming Governance 

Ensuring appropriate attention to governance across all pillars of the CPS program will require a combination of 
project, sector, and country-level approaches, with support from the Bank‟s Governance Hub in Bangkok: 

Project level:  Teams will be encouraged to consider the basic questions of how the project might help advance 
governance (institutional capacity, transparency, accountability, participation, and anti -corruption) in Vietnam, as 
well as how governance issues may impact project effectiveness.  There is no presumption that every project 
should address every problem, but the decision of whether and how to address governance issues should be a 
considered one.  For each proposed project, Bank teams will be asked to consider early in the preparation process 
the following questions: 

 What are the key capacity constraints in this area of work?  Is the Bank addressing them in other 
projects?  Can the proposed project do more and if so, how? 
 What opportunities exist to enhance transparency through this project?  Can the project be designed to 
exploit some of these opportunities and if so, how?   
 Are there opportunities to strengthen accountability and increase transparency vis-à-vis project 
beneficiaries and affected people through incorporation of incentives, periodic public reporting and 
information sharing, meaningful consultations, and feedback mechanisms into the proposed project‟s 
design? 
 Are there opportunities to empower project beneficiaries and affected people to participate in the 
proposed project and enhance the quality of outcomes?  How will the Bank exploit such opportunities? 
 What are specific corruption risks for implementation, and what will the Bank do to help mitigate them?  
In this regard, the Bank‟s Operational Risk Assessment Framework will be a key tool. 

Sector level:  While there is no presumption that every project should be a governance project, it is reasonable to 
expect each of the Bank‟s sector teams to integrate more fully governance thinking into their strategic 
engagement, for true mainstreaming.  Key manifestations of weak governance in different sectors or sub-sectors 
and their causes will be analyzed to inform project design and policy dialogue.  Based on this evolving analysis, a 
small number of priority activities where the Bank can have a meaningful impact will be identified and integrated 
into the Vietnam work program.  

Country level:  The Country Team will annually review experience, success, and gaps in governance 
mainstreaming, and adjust course as necessary.   

Box 3: Empowering Local Women and Improving Rural Road Maintenance 

Transport challenges in rural areas include under-funding of road maintenance and difficulties in engaging local 
contractors for routine road maintenance in remote areas.  During preparation of the Third Rural Transport Project 
(cofinanced with DFID), many poor women with seasonal farming responsibilities in ethnic minority communities 
expressed interest in actively participating as stewards of their local roads.  The Bank and DFID launched an 
initiative to train them in engineering and road building practices and provided formal employment opportunities 
in road maintenance near their communities.  More than 1,500 ethnic minority women have been trained, and 
many more eagerly await the opportunity. Across the rural road networks, 10 -30 women are paid to maintain a 1-2 
km section for three months.  As a result, women have achieved increased economic power and greater voice in 
community decision-making and a more visible role in managing affairs at the household level.   

62. With Vietnam’s vulnerability more evident since 2007, the need to strengthen the country’s 
resilience is now a strategic priority.  The global crisis has exposed Vietnam‟s vulnerability to external 
shocks at both the macroeconomic and household level, and globally there is a heightened awareness of 
risks posed by climate change.  Resilience is therefore a third theme cutting across all three CPS pillars, in 
the context of the macroeconomic policy framework and financial sector soundness (engagement areas 
under Pillar 1 – Competitiveness), climate change mitigation and adaptation (engagement areas under 
Pillar 2 – Sustainability), and social protection and facilitation of livelihoods for the poor (engagement 
areas under Pillar 3 – Opportunity).  However, unlike governance and gender which have explicit 
indicators and milestones integrated into the results framework, resilience is captured in the results 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
framework through relevant indicators and milestones related to macroeconomic stability, social 
protection, natural disaster risk management, and response to climate change. 

Results Framework 

Pillar 1 – Competitiveness  

63. 
Alignment with Government Strategy.  Vietnam‟s SEDS 2011-2020 and the SEDP 2011-2015 
emphasize needed “breakthroughs” in relation to the development of market-based institutions, 
infrastructure, and more skilled human capital.  Realizing the broad transformation processes highlighted 
in the SEDS will require equally transformative changes in the structure and performance of public 
administration, the business environment, and non-farm employment creation. The WBG‟s CPS program 
for the “Competitiveness” pillar is well aligned with the SEDS and supports the Government‟s agenda for 
raising the quality of economic growth and economic management. 

Pillar 1 - CPS Outcomes / Areas of Engagement 

1.1: Improved Economic 
Management and Business 
Environment 

1.2:  Improved quality and 
efficiency of infrastructure 
services 

• Macro-Economic Policy 
Framework 
• Public Financial Management 
• Financial Sector  
• Market-based Regulations 

• Energy 
• Water  
• Transport 

1.3:  Increased capacity for 
innovation and value addition 

• Skills and Innovations Systems 
• Agriculture Value Chains and 
Rural SMEs 

64. 
Outcome 1.1:  Improved economic management and business environment.  The Bank, in 
coordination with the IMF, will continue to contribute to improvement of Vietnam‟s macroeconomic 
management through regular policy dialogue, a comprehensive assessment of the financial sector (FSAP), 
annual budget support operations and systemic AAA.  The Bank will continue to support measures to 
improve PFM, notably modernization of revenue collection and reform of public expenditure 
management and oversight, and reforms to various public investment laws.  Efforts will be made to 
address accountability gaps emerging from decentralization.  The Bank and IFC will provide further 
support to strengthen financial sector soundness, enhance financial infrastructure and improve access to 
financial services, including through capital markets development.  This will include facilitating further 
autonomy of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, 
and building capacity for its effective implementation.  IFC activities will focus on broadening and 
deepening Vietnam‟s financial markets as the main mechanism for capital allocation including engaging 
with top-tier and emerging top-tier financial institutions to strengthen their capital bases and attract 
international banking partners to strengthen and develop their long-term competiveness. The Bank will 
work closely with the IFC to address priority reforms including on the SOE-related issues of soft budget 
constraints and weak corporate governance. The Bank and IFC will strengthen dialogue with Government 
on SOE reform and respond with financial support for restructuring of the sector if requested.  IFC will 
continue support to introduction of global standards of corporate governance and risk management, and in 
attracting world-class strategic partners and investors.    Other governance issues to be addressed include 
transparency and disclosure of financial information.  The Bank will work with the accounting and audit 
professional bodies and regulators to strengthen the quality of corporate financial reporting by following 
up on recommendations from the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on  Account 
and Audit completed in 2009.  IFC will continue to support improvement of the business environment 
through investment climate advisory service activities focused on regulatory reform and will support the 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transition of the Vietnam Business Forum to a self sustainable platform for dialogue between Government 
and businesses. 

Box 4: EMCC to Succeed PRSC Series 

With the PRSC series expected to conclude with its tenth and final operation in December 2011, the Bank has, at 
the Government's request, initiated discussions on what could follow: a DPO series of Economic Management 
and Competitiveness Credits (EMCC).  Like the PRSCs, the EMCCs would be multi -year, multi-donor 
operations starting in FY12 but, like the CPS, with a 5 (rather than 10) year time horizon.  The series would 
focus on critical reforms to enhance competitiveness, central to sustained growth and poverty reduction in 
Vietnam.  Strategic and analytical underpinnings for the EMCCs would be drawn from the SEDS 2011 -20, the 
Competitiveness Pillar of the CPS, the National Competitiveness Report, and recent Vietnam Development 
Reports.  Competitiveness is a function of many factors, but one of the lessons from the PRSC series is the 
importance of a focused reform agenda under one series of budget support operations.  The EMCCs would 
therefore focus on reforms to strengthen (i) macroeconomic stab ility and (ii) institutions for public sector 
governance and private sector development.  They might also address cross -cutting issues related to the policy 
framework for infrastructure and skills critical to enhancing competitiveness, to complement investment 
operations in these areas.     

65. 
Outcome 1.2:  Improved quality and efficiency of infrastructure services.  Considerable 
challenges remain in improving the quality and efficiency of energy, water, transport-related, and other 
services.  In the energy sector, through complementary DPOs and sector investment loans (SILs) the 
Bank will continue to support transmission and distribution with emphasis on issues of operational 
efficiency, market competition, and transparent and cost reflective electricity pricing, while the IFC will 
promote energy efficiency.  The Bank will finance investments supporting efforts to improve quality and 
efficiency of water supply, as well as integrated urban development initiatives in larger cities, covering 
urban planning, municipal management and the integration of major infrastructure and basic services to 
make these cities more attractive venues for investment. Project design will be informed by ongoing 
programmatic AAA on urban development.  WBI will support the program with capacity building in 
urban planning for city officials.  Support for a more competitive transport sector will include financing 
for upgrading of the national road network, investments in urban transport infrastructure and mass transit 
systems, and technical assistance in the areas of trade facilitation, coastal shipping services, and logistics. 
Greater attention will be given to policies and tools for more effective road asset management, addre ssing 
poor project and contract management and developing institutional and regulatory frameworks for multi-
modal transport.  With Vietnam a priority for MIGA, its Asia hub in Singapore will facilitate deeper 
engagement.  MIGA's Political Risk Insurance is particularly attractive to investors in the infrastructure 
sector, so MIGA will contribute to improved quality and efficiency of infrastructure services.  In addition, 
MIGA will launch several new products, including guaranteeing Government‟s payment obligations 
related to PPPs for priority infrastructure projects.  The CPS program will support Government‟s plan to 
scale up public investment by mobilizing private resources for infrastructure development, including 
through  the establishment of a sustainable framework for and implementation of pilot PPP projects.  IFC 
is providing advisory services on PPP transactions and will invest in infrastructure projects, including as 
an anchor investor in large-scale strategic industrial infrastructure projects. To mainstream governance in 
this pillar, accountability, participation, and transparency issues will be addressed based on risk level and 
entry points of specific sectors and projects. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the CPS period, the Bank‟s strategic priorities in the infrastructure sectors in Vietnam will be to: 

Box 5: World Bank’s Infrastructure Strategy in Vietnam 

 Go beyond considerations of access to emphasize the improved quality of public energy, water , and 
transport services;  
 Enhance effective O&M systems for physical and operational sustainability in transport operations,  
household water supply, irrigation systems;  
 Connect the last remaining pockets of the population that lack access to basic services and economic 
opportunities through provision of rural water supply and sanitation, and rural access roads; 
 Fill the missing middle in the transport network by supporting provincial roads, and thereby link rural 
communities with district and provincial centers; 
 Generate quality growth by combining infrastructure investments with policy reforms (e.g., power sector 
reforms), and policy and capacity development support for the Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Construction, 
and selected cities;  
 Enhance resilience of infrastructure and productive assets to climate change and natural disasters;    
 Reduce the carbon footprint of Vietnam‟s economy by supporting renewable energy, energy efficiency, and 
cleaner technology options for urban transport; 
 Do more integrated urban development planning, linked to regional development 

66. 
Outcome 1.3:  Increased capacity for innovation and value addition. A central element of 
Vietnam‟s innovation agenda is strengthening labor market skills by reforming how the education and 
training system is managed.  The program will include the last in a series of three Higher Education DPOs 
addressing university governance (including autonomy, accountability, and financing).  Bank support will 
gradually shift from support for expansion of supply of infrastructure and inputs , towards strengthening 
the education system as a whole and factors that impact service delivery, with a focus on adjustments to 
the finance and governance systems.  Programmatic analytical work will lay the foundation for this shift, 
with a focus on skills needed for economic growth and an assessment of the ability of Vietnam‟s 
education system to deliver needed competencies.  This will include an examination of the structure of the 
education and training system and scope for improving governance by enhancing school autonomy and 
accountability of education providers for learning results, and opportunities to improve spending 
efficiency and make it responsive to labor market needs. Strengthening capacity for measuring outcomes 
in the education system through student learning assessments at all levels will also remain central to the 
program.  A new area of engagement for the Bank will be support, through both AAA and investment 
lending, for reforms in Vietnam‟s innovation systems to modernize and expand capacity.  Support will be 
provided via investment lending for innovations in selected industries where there is potential to benefit 
large numbers of the population, and for the development of business incubation programs that leverage 
regional and sectoral approaches to facilitate development of innovative enterprises.  The Bank will 
collaborate with IFC to support development of micro, small, and medium enterprises and in building 
competitiveness in select industries.  The Bank will remain engaged in promoting upgrades and value -
addition in Vietnam‟s agriculture sector, including through support for public-private partnerships for 
technology transfer, and ongoing operations financing agricultural research, advisory services, and 
capacity building and incentives to raise product quality and ensure food safety.  Bank -IFC collaboration 
will seek to strengthen the enabling environment and capacity for agro-industrial development.  AAA 
work will therefore support policy and institutional reforms needed to accelerate and manage structural 
change in Vietnamese agriculture, agricultural services, and agribusiness.  Part of the expected structural 
change would relate to the respective roles and forms of interaction among public, private, and collective 
entities in the sector.

Pillar 2 – Sustainability  

67. 
Alignment with Government Strategy.  Vietnam‟s SEDS and SEDP point to the need to 
strengthen the protection of natural resources and the environment, to mainstream this in development 
planning, and to implement measures to address natural hazards and climate change.  Growing 
recognition of Vietnam‟s vulnerability to extreme weather events and the country‟s growing contribution 
to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies.  
The WBG's CPS program on "Sustainability" will assist the government and other stakeholders to 
translate this increased recognition in the SEDP/SEDS of risks associated with the environment, natural 
resource degradation, and weather/climate into improved strategies, improved governance arrangements, 
and priority investments. 

Pillar 2 - CPS Outcomes / Areas of Engagement 

2.1:  Improved natural resource 
management 

2.2:  Strengthened 
environmental protection and 
management 

2.3:  Enhanced preparedness 
for natural hazards and climate 
change 

• Water Resources 
Management 
• Land Administration and 
Management 
•Forest and Biodiversity 
Conservation 

• Pollution Reduction 
• Climate Change Mitigation 

• Disaster Risk Management 
• Climate Change Adaptation 

68. 
Outcome 2.1:  Improved natural resources management.  The Bank‟s program related to 
water resources management will continue to provide support for the upgrading and extension of physical 
infrastructure (including for irrigation, urban drainage, and inland waterway transport) . Increased 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attention will be given to strengthening institutional arrangements and incentives for more efficient water 
use and greater financial sustainability of services. For example, support wil l be provided to pilot 
measures to improve on-farm water use efficiency, apply institutional models for improved irrigation and 
residential water supply delivery, and strengthen capacities for river basin, inter-provincial, and 
coordinated trans-boundary water resources management.  Sector governance will be improved through 
development of water user organizations to make collective decisions on water use and mitigate potential 
conflicts. The program will include an investment operation to enhance biodiversity conservation in 
marine and coastal areas, promote sustainable fisheries management, and bring about improvements in 
aquaculture practices and governance.  The Bank will continue to support improved governance through 
strengthening the transparency of Vietnam‟s system for land administration, while stepping up support 
related to land use planning and development of more efficient land markets in urban, peri -urban and 
rural areas. Support will continue in selected areas related to forestry and biodiversity conservation , 
including continued support to high-quality smallholder agro-forestry plantations, forest law enforcement 
and governance, Vietnam‟s readiness to participate in the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and 
Forest Degradation (REDD) Program, biodiversity conservation and other measures through the Vietnam 
Conservation Fund, and efforts to reduce the illegal trade of wildlife and timber products. Instruments 
will include GEF and regional IDA operations. 

69. 
Outcome 2.2:  Strengthened environmental protection and management.  The Bank will 
support measures for pollution reduction and prevention from various sources in order to improve the 
physical environment, and mitigate adverse health and economic impacts.  For example, the program will 
support the safe disposal of hospital waste, investments and capacity building for pollution control 
enforcement at selected industrial parks, the introduction of compressed natural gas public buses, 
improved systems for waste water and solid waste management, and measures to manage livestock waste 
and promote safer use of pesticides.  GEF-funded programs will develop national capacity to manage 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Montreal Protocol projects to phase out the use of ozone -depleting 
substances with a focus on hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and methyl bromide.  WBG support for 
climate change mitigation is strong on both the IFC and Bank side and will include policy dialogue, 
investments and a more specific focus on enhanced energy efficiency – including through the 
development of renewable energy sources, policy actions in the industrial sector, demand-side energy 
efficiency measures (including tariff reforms), providing capital lines and advisory services, as well as 
awareness raising and strengthening of the regulatory environment, and analysis of low-carbon growth 
strategies.  The program will also support climate change mitigation measures in relation to transport, 
urban development, and agriculture.  

70. 
Outcome 2.3:  Enhanced preparedness for natural hazards and climate change.  The Bank 
continues to fill a financing gap for post-disaster reconstruction, helping to improve prioritization of 
budgetary resources promoting the principle of “build back better.”  The Bank‟s support will increasingly 
focus on strengthening capacities to anticipate and reduce the impact of extreme weather events.  Hence, 
the Bank will support strengthening of hydro-meteorological services and early warning systems, 
investments to reduce storm and flood risks in highly vulnerable areas, scaling up of community -based 
disaster risk management, improvements in area-based and urban disaster risk planning and mapping, and 
agro-weather advisory services.  Technical assistance will be provided to assist Government in 
developing a comprehensive disaster risk financing strategy.  Through TFs and a series of DPOs, the 
Bank‟s program will support strengthening governance for addressing climate change through capacity 
building for climate change-related analysis, planning, and M&E in five targeted ministries, as well as for 
enhanced inter-ministerial coordination.  It will support a series of studies pertaining to climate change 

24 

 
 
 
 
adaptation in various sectors, emphasizing the scope for „no regrets‟ types of measures19, while also 
assisting Government to better understand costs, benefits, risks, and alternatives to proposed  investments.

Pillar 3 – Opportunity  

71. 
Alignment with Government Strategy.  The CPS program under the “Opportunity” pillar is 
aligned with the strategic development agenda laid out in the SEDP and the SEDS, including efforts to 
create equal opportunities for access to resources for development, basic services, and social welfare in 
rural and urban areas, to continue with policies for sustainable poverty reduction (especially in the poorest 
districts and among ethnic minorities), and to improve the quality of social services.  Recognizing the 
importance of skills to finding productive and stable employment, Government has made improving the 
quality of human resources one of the three break-through priorities of the SEDS. Government is in the 
process of adopting its first ever Social Protection Strategy which sets out strategic development 
directions for the period 2011-2020.  These include efforts to promote stable and more productive 
employment, make the social insurance system more sustainable and expand its coverage, develop social 
assistance, and improve targeting and management of poverty reduction programs.

72. 
Outcome 3.1:  Increased opportunities for the poor and household resilience to shocks.  
Building on insights from new poverty analysis, the Bank will support Government in its efforts to further 
strengthen poverty reduction and social protection policies, and to improve the livelihood and earning 
opportunities for the remaining poor and vulnerable, many of whom are ethnic minorities.  Analytical 
work will be undertaken to underpin future investment lending focused on regions with very high rates of 
poverty, with support combining upgrades 
in basic productive 
infrastructure, measures 
to 
enhance/diversify livelihood opportunities, and additional measures emerging from the analysis/shocks.  
Programmatic AAA is underway in poverty analysis and M&E capacity building and social protection.  
Complementary support will be provided by both IFC and the Bank to strengthen financial inclusion and 
the provision of and access to micro-finance and other financial services for the urban and rural poor as 
well as rural micro enterprises and SMEs. IFC investment and advisory engagements will focus on: (i) 
supporting development of a viable commercial microfinance industry to improve access to finance for 
Vietnam‟s base of the pyramid and rural population; and (ii) increasing opportunities for the base of the 
pyramid by supporting investments with supply chains linkages into rural economies and by increasing 
private sector-oriented education.  Informed by the ongoing AAA, the Bank will also step up its 
investment financing for further development of the social protection system, inter alia to establish 
linkages between assistance, insurance, and programs aimed at improving the earning opportunities of the 
working poor.  The Bank anticipates this could involve the design of a new social assistance cash transfer 
program targeted at poor households.  Bank support will also focus on reducing the risk of transmission 
of poverty from the current to the next generation by promoting better access of children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds to early childhood education and development services.  Recognizing the 
growing challenge of population aging in Vietnam, the program will contribute to Government‟s efforts 
to enhance the financial sustainability, fairness and coverage of the contributory social insurance system 
as well as to develop mechanisms to expand coverage of workers, including in the informal sector.  It will 
support Government‟s efforts to expand coverage and utilization of health insurance, in particular by the 
poor and the near-poor. Given their importance in driving vulnerability to shocks, food security will be a 
focus of analytical work and policy advice.  Access to information and ability to exercise rights as 
provided by law will be critical for success in expanding opportunity.  The CPS program will therefore 
strive for more open access to official information and support Government‟s efforts to strengthen 
capacity for and awareness of citizen‟s rights.  

73. 
Outcome 3.2:  Improved basic infrastructure and public service delivery and access.   The 
program will continue to support the provision of basic infrastructure and related services in rural and 
urban areas.  Continued support will be provided through financing of investments in rural areas to 
connect communities to basic access and improved all-weather roads and strengthen the management and 
maintenance of the rural road network in provinces throughout northern and central Vietnam.  Efforts will 
continue to sustainably increase access to water supply and sanitation services (including through results -
based approaches), and upgrade the living conditions in poor urban neighborhoods.  With an ongoing 
investment operation the Bank will continue to support improvement of learning outcomes and education 
completion for primary education students, particularly disadvantaged primary education students, 
through co-financing of the Government‟s full-day schooling reform program and the promotion of 
greater school readiness.  Measurement of the quality of service delivery and learning outcomes through 
student assessments will be central to these efforts. The Bank will also continue to support Government‟s 
efforts to expand health insurance coverage among the near-poor, as well as efforts to improve the 
delivery of health services, including through a planned investment operation aimed at improving 
governance of the health sector. Bank support will transition from traditional essential infrastructure 
investment and a single issue disease project approach towards national level engagement in policy and 
institutional capacity strengthening support, including on quality management (See Box 6).

Box 6: Addressing Vietnam’s Remaining Poverty Agenda 

In light of remaining as well as new poverty challenges, Vietnam is working to reframe its strategy to reduce 
poverty, vulnerability, and inequality with the specific aim of (i) ensuring more rapid progress for those left 
behind, with particular focus on ethnic minority households; (ii) consolidating gains and ensuring sustainable 
progress for lower income households and the near poor; and (iii) addressing new challenges, including rising 
inequality across regions and social groups, new vulnerabilities, and challenges linked to rapid urbanization and 
an emerging group of urban poor and vulnerable households.  

The Bank launched a Programmatic Poverty Assessment for Vietnam in FY11, working in collaboration with 
country partners and building on a strong and ongoing p rogram of technical assistance and capacity building for 
data collection and poverty analysis. The Programmatic Poverty Assessment aims to stimulate debate and new 
thinking in Vietnam on a second generation of poverty issues more relevant for Vietnam‟s eme rging middle 
income economy and rapidly changing social and cultural environment. The findings of the assessment will 
inform  the development of the Bank‟s future program. 

The Bank‟s operational program in Vietnam will retain a strong focus on helping Viet nam address its remaining 
and new poverty challenges as a middle income country. First, there will be several interventions with a direct 
poverty reduction objective. Second, many World Bank-supported sectoral interventions will be targeted to the 
poor and near-poor and to remote regions and regions with high ethnic minority poverty.  For example, regional 
health projects will continue to finance subsidized access to health insurance for the near -poor and thus address 
one of the major shocks that risk pushing vulnerable households back into poverty.  Education interventions 
supporting full-day schooling or early childhood education and school readiness will be targeted to poorer 
regions, typically with high ethnic minority population shares, and attempt to p rovide opportunities for the next 
generation to escape poverty.  Equally, rural and urban infrastructure interventions will focus on poor 
communities and neighborhoods and aim to help provide access to basic services and markets for the poor and 
disadvantaged.

The IFC’s program for promoting inclusive economic growth is aligned with the 
opportunity pillar.  Investment and advisory engagements will focus on: (i) supporting the development 
of a viable commercial microfinance industry to improve access to finance for Vietnam‟s base of the 
pyramid and rural population; and (ii) increasing opportunities for the base of the pyramid to participate 
in Vietnam‟s growth by supporting investments with supply chains linkages into rural economies and by 
increasing private sector-oriented education.

D. IMPLEMENTING THE FY12-FY16 CPS 

Implementation Challenges 

75. 
The main challenge for Vietnam program implementation is to achieve results faster.  This 
has become more pronounced with the recent growth in the program.  For the IFC, one of the main 
challenges to implementation is the fact that private sector in Vietnam is still relatively small and 
underdeveloped. Considerable capacity building is required in areas of corporate governance, capital 
efficiency, and professionalization of management. IFC is addressing this by seeking to engage with 
leading private sector groups and entrepreneurs to help them tackle these constraints and set standards for 
Vietnam‟s emerging private sector.  For the Bank, while the quality of portfolio implementation continues 
to be satisfactory as evidenced by the review of Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) by the World 
Bank‟s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG),20 the country would benefit significantly if implementation 
of its investment program were accelerated and development objectives achieved at a much faster pace.  
Government has renewed its efforts by: (a) revising its ODA implementation regulations, and (b) working 
even more closely with development partners to sharpen the focus of ODA.  Newer approaches to 
operations, such as results-based and output-based disbursement, are being discussed.  Vietnam‟s 
National Target Programs (in place for the past several years to reduce poverty and improve the quality of 
basic services such as rural water supply, education, and health) may be useful vehicles for these new 
approaches.  During the CPS period, the Bank and Government will work to assess underlying fiduciary 
systems capacity and to diversify lending instruments for faster development impact.   

76. 
Capacity at sub-national levels is weak across a range of skills.  These include technical, 
project management, and fiduciary skills (procurement and financial management – see Box 7). There is 
also a lack of depth of quality suppliers and service providers.  For the Bank‟s portfolio, these capacity 
constraints are evident in procurement delays, quality of project management oversight, weaknesses in 
financial management (reporting and internal controls) and safeguards, and civil works contract 
administration.     

Box 7: Ensuring Fiduciary and Institutional Development 

The use of country systems is a key indicator of the Paris Declaration as adopted in Vietnam through the Hanoi 
Core Statement (HCS).  Currently around 58 percent of Bank funds are disbursed through the government 
public financial management (PFM) systems, exceeding the HCS target of 50 percent.  This is largely due to 
financing via the Bank‟s development policy lending which is in the form of direct budget support and fully 
relies on the country PFM systems.    

Most PMUs are formally integrated into the country system in that they are managed by a senior government 
official accountable to the responsible line agency, comprised of seconded, functional department staff, and 
primarily subject to Vietnamese laws on public investment management . While almost all Bank-financed 
investment projects are off-budget, they are reported to the national legislature, and elements of the government 
system – such as budget execution procedures for counterpart funds, expenditure verification by State Treasury, 
government accounting classifications, controls and “cost norms,” and interim reporting using the Aligned 
Monitoring Tool – are employed whenever feasible.  In addition, because the World Bank projects are funded 
outside the country‟s treasury system, Bank resources are consistently tracked using designated or special 
accounts.  Separate annual financial statements are required and are subject to audit by independent audit firms.  

The Bank aims to support strengthening of country fiduciary systems and increase their use.  Program-based 
and results-based operations are being discussed with Government.  Efforts will also be made to engage the 
State Audit of Vietnam as auditor, particularly in cases where project design or procurement is not complex. 

20 All of the 35 ICRs of Vietnam operations reviewed by IEG have been rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory for 
development outcome, with zero disconnect vis-à-vis the final ISRs.  This is the strongest evaluation record of any IDA 
borrower. 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
77. 
During the CPS period, the Bank will continue to work jointly with MPI and other donors 
to address systemic ODA implementation issues.  This work will include: (i) support for revision of 
Decree 131, adopted in 2006 as the main legal framework for management of ODA in Vietnam; (ii) 
continued implementation of the Six Banks‟ 12-point Joint Action Plan; (iii) a study of options for 
streamlining project management unit (PMU) arrangements; and (iv) continued analytical work and 
support for the development of national fiduciary and safeguards capacities. This support will include (i) 
PFM capacity building, including the ongoing Bank-financed PFM operation and the related multi-donor 
TF, IDF grants, and with the planned introduction of results-based and output-based financing; and (ii) 
procurement capacity building, including through continued policy dialogue with relevant government 
authorities and the Six Banks, ongoing and planned IDF grants, TA for development of bidders‟ protest 
mechanisms, and governance and anti-corruption (GAC) action plans for high-risk projects. 

78. 
The Bank is also undertaking analyses to learn from well-performing provinces and sectors.  
Provincial governments are now charged with more responsibility in managing investment operations.  
Despite limited capacity, some provinces manage the portfolio better than their peers.   A recent initiative 
to focus the portfolio review at the provincial level has produced a number of lessons that will be shared 
with other provinces, and additional provincial-level portfolio reviews will be conducted.   The portfolio‟s 
performance also differs by sector, with some sectors having a good record of faster and quality results.  
Lessons are now being studied and will also be applied to improve the overall portfolio.   

Box 8: Fiduciary Risks 

As noted in the CPS Completion Report (Annex 2) and also discussed in Annex 16, Vietnam has made good 
progress in establishing a sound public financial management (PFM) system and is committed to addressing the 
remaining PFM reform agenda.  The level of project financial management performance across the Bank‟s 
investment lending portfolio exhibits some weaknesses, particularly in decentralized and geographically 
dispersed projects.  Lack of coordination between project management units and relevant government agencies 
contributes to implementation delays, and follow-up of audit issues can be slow.  Partly this reflects the fact 
that Vietnam‟s public procurement legal framework falls short of internationally accepted standards and 
acknowledged good practices.  In addition, many implementing agencies still lack the necessary capacity.  A 
number of issues have been noted, including dominance of dependent SOEs in the market, frequent occurrences 
of conflict of interest, weak contract management, collusion, and local authorities' insistence on following 
government procurement procedures or implementing "dual" procedures under Bank-financed projects.  This 
situation leads to procurement delays, irregularities, and non -compliance.   

During the CPS period, the Bank will continue to support progress on the PFM and procurement reform 
agenda, build institutional capacity, and improve aid effectiveness.   Ongoing capacity building in financial 
management and procurement will be conducted for government agencies, project staff, and audit firms to 
reinforce the Bank‟s requirements and to address cross-cutting issues identified during Bank prior and post 
reviews and audits.  Bank risk-based and joint fiduciary supervisions will continue to be conducted and 
measures incorporated in project arrangements to mitigate fiduciary risks. 

79. 
At the project level, MPI and the Bank are giving priority to improving projects’ readiness 
for implementation, accelerating their preparation, and managing the existing portfolio proactively.  
Readiness, in terms of detailed design, procurement and PMU arrangements, is being jointly assessed 
through systematic reviews of the lending pipeline.  Implementation of the Bank-financed Project 
Preparation TA Facility needs to be improved to make financing for project preparation available in a 
timely manner.  Proactive management of the existing portfolio includes (i) major restructuring and 
partial cancellation, not necessarily limited to problem projects, with the aim of faster implementation and 
therefore development impact; (ii) a high-level review meeting between the Bank and Government semi-
annually, with the Prime Minister‟s Office directing the agreed follow-up actions; (iii) provincial portfolio 
reviews in a selected number of provinces; (iv) sectoral portfolio reviews with line ministries; and (v) a 
realistic assessment of the implementation progress , downgrading of project ratings in Implementation

if needed to improve implementation.  

IDA, IBRD, and IFC Resources  

80. 
An indicative IDA 16 allocation21 of about SDR 2.8 billion22 (equivalent to US$4.2 billion) 
would be available to support Vietnam’s economic and social development in FY12-FY14.  This 
would be the largest IDA allocation to Vietnam of any IDA Replenishment, reflecting Vietnam‟s strong 
performance as well as the increase in overall IDA resources mobilized for IDA 16 compared with IDA 
15.  Vietnam could also receive additional IDA resources through its participation in IDA regional 
projects.  The share of DPOs in the FY12-FY14 IDA program is currently estimated at about 25 percent 
and could rise if policy reform momentum increases.   

81. 
Proposed FY12-FY14 IBRD commitments total US$770 million, of which around US$280 
million is planned for two DPOs, and the balance for SILs.  Most of these resources would likely 
support infrastructure development.  FY15-FY16 IBRD commitments are anticipated to be in the range of 
US$300 million to US$550 million for SILs, and an additional $100 million to US$150 million for DPOs.  
Actual commitment volumes in the FY13-FY16 period are indicative only and will be determined 
annually, depending on how government demand and macroeconomic policy and performance evolve in 
the course of the CPS period, and on IBRD‟s lending capacity and demand from other borrowers.  While 
the current preference of the Ministry of Finance is to allocate IBRD resources to revenue-generating 
sectors, this is expected to change over the medium and longer term to allow Vietnam to base its funding 
and expenditure decisions on economic rather than financial rates of return.  To facilitate Vietnam‟s 
transition to IBRD, the Bank‟s Treasury will be providing several types of training to government 
officials early in the CPS period.  An indicative IDA and IBRD lending program for FY12-FY14 is 
shown in Annex 5.   

82. 
In FY11, IFC’s commitments in Vietnam reached US$ 700 million and mobilization reached 
more than US$200 million.  It is expected that IFC‟s portfolio for both investment and advisory services 
will continue to increase throughout the CPS period.  

83. 
Infrastructure will likely continue to account for the largest share of Bank lending 
(especially IBRD), given the vast infrastructure needs for supporting Vietnam’s rapid growth.  The 
IFC also expects infrastructure to become an increasingly big part of its portfolio as the private sector 
plays a more important role in building and financing infrastructure.  In addition to infrastructure, the IDA 
program will also support Vietnam‟s unfinished structural reform agenda, human development, natural 
resource management, and measures to address climate change.  FY15-FY16 lending plans will be 
elaborated in the CPS Progress Report in mid-FY14. 

Monitoring CPS Implementation 

84. 
The results framework of this CPS will serve as a management tool for the Bank’s Vietnam 
Country Team.  Its design is streamlined to make it a useful monitoring tool.  Progress towards 
achievement of the CPS outcomes will be monitored annually.  The review will be facilitated by the 
Country Portfolio and Results Monitoring Tool (CPRT), a web-based system for monitoring progress 

21 For IDA16 allocations, only FY12 allocation is firm, and allocations in FY13 -14 are indicative and can change depending on  
total IDA resources available in FY13 and 14, the IDA resource allocation process, and exchange rate changes between the SDR 
and the dollar.

toward CPS outcomes.  The CPRT is populated with data from ISRs and the Bank‟s existing information 
systems, and can therefore provide real-time links between the lending portfolio performance and AAA to 
progress toward CPS outcomes.  For the data forming the basis of these progress reviews to be current, 
the Country Team will ensure timely updates of ISR results indicators. 

Trust Fund Program and Strategy  

85. 
Trust Funds are a very important financing source for the Bank’s country program in 
Vietnam. A significant part of trust fund resources are used to support Bank investment projects and 
policy operations through co-financing, project preparation, and background analytical work (see Annex 
17). Trust funds also play an important role in knowledge transfers to Vietnam by supporting joint 
analytical work with Vietnamese research institutions and think tanks, capacity building, and training 
activities.  Trust funds also help the country pilot innovative ideas such as the JSDF Trust Fund on Early 
Childhood Care and Development, and provide emergency support such as for Avian Influenza. TFs can 
thus help to leverage Bank resources further and are used as a unique platform for donors to provide joint 
assistance, e.g., the PRSC series.  

86. 
The sources of trust funds are expected to change as Vietnam develops, and donors shift 
their attention to newer areas of support or start to scale down in Vietnam.  Some donors have 
recently expressed their intention to shift their focus to emerging issues such as climate change, while 
others are scaling down or exiting Vietnam over the next several years.  Development partners and the 
Bank are carefully reviewing the impacts of such a shift for Vietnam's SEDP through the work of 
developing the new ODA Strategic Framework.  At the same time, the shift calls for even stronger 
attention to the effectiveness of aid.  To this effect, the Aid Effectiveness Forum and other partnership 
groups have been working closely with the Ministry of Planning and Investment to intensify the synergy 
among the development partners' programs. 

87. 
Implementation of the Vietnam trust fund portfolio has been successful, but some 
improvements are needed.  These include more strategic alignment and realistic assessment of the time 
needed for implementation and achievement of results.  Selection criteria have been developed and will 
be applied to TFs more systematically by the Bank‟s country team, and TFs will be included in portfolio 
performance reviews.  Vietnam is central to the regional efforts to improve the way mobilize and utilize 
TFs. 

E. DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS AND AID EFFECTIVENESS 

88. 
Vietnam is not an aid dependent country – in 2010, ODA accounted for less than 5 percent 
of the country’s gross national income (GNI) (see Annex 3) – but there is no question that the 
country has used ODA effectively in support of its development.  With Vietnam‟s new status as a 
lower middle income country, several development partners have announced plans to scale down their 
activities or exit the country within the next 3-5 years.  Other partners have indicated that they will 
gradually transform their relations with Vietnam to focus more on trade and commercial activities, 
including FDI from private companies originating in donor countries.  This CPS period will therefore 
witness a transformation of Vietnam‟s ODA landscape to a smaller number of traditional development 
partners, and less grant and highly concessional resources.  The Bank will work with Government to 
ensure that this transition is smooth and where appropriate, offer co-financing opportunities for partners 
who may find this useful as they reduce their field presence.   The Bank will also begin planning for 
continuing important parts of its program for which donor funding might end during the CPS period.    

89. 
The planned exit of several development partners does not diminish the importance of 
continuing to 
improve coordination among partners and strengthen harmonization with 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Government programs, approaches, and procedures.  Vietnam has made significant progress in 
coordination and harmonization, as the first country to localize the Paris Declaration in 2005 resulting in 
the Hanoi Core Statement.  A recent evaluation of the Hanoi Core Statement identifies some of the 
reasons for success, including strong national ownership, impressive poverty reduction records (giving 
development partners the confidence that their money is well spent), absence of aid dependency (making 
donor conditionalities ineffective) and a limited timeframe for ODA (making the Government eager to 
spend the resources well).  As the timeframe for both the Paris Declaration and the Hanoi Core Statement 
draw to a close, the Bank is supporting the Government in the development of the next round of Aid 
Effectiveness initiatives. 

90. 
Vietnam’s apex partnership forum is the Consultative Group (CG).  The Bank and 
Government co-host the annual CG Meeting (in Hanoi) and mid-year CG (in a province).  Nearly all 
multilateral and bilateral donors participate as do international NGOs.  Development partners are 
discussing with Government how to transform the CG from a resource mobilization forum to a forum for 
more effective high level policy dialogue.  In conjunction with the CG, the Government and donors also 
co-host the Aid Effectiveness Forum, the Vietnam Business Forum, and the Anti-Corruption Dialogue.  
The Vietnam Business Forum, co-chaired by the Government and IFC, will continue to be an important 
platform for dialogue between the Government and the private sector on private sector development and 
regulatory reform issues.  It is also an important forum for development of Vietnam‟s local chambers of 
commerce and business associations.  After several years of IFC funding, this forum will transition to one 
led and funded by private sector participants.  This transition is expected to be completed by January 
2012. 

91. 
The Bank is also actively involved in a number of other donor/government coordination 
fora in Vietnam.  These include the Aid Effectiveness Forum, the majority of Vietnam‟s 18 currently 
active Sectoral and International Partnership Groups, and the Six Banks Group (See Annex 18).  The 
PRSC series has also continued to serve as an important vehicle for both policy dialogue and donor 
coordination.  As the PRSC series comes to an end, the Bank is committed to making the successor 
operations take on a strong role in donor coordination around policy reform in the next CPS period.  A 
special effort will be made to strengthen coordination and partnership with other large development 
partners in Vietnam, notably the ADB and JICA.  This will be done through regular consultations and 
exchange of information on strategy and programming and by inviting ADB and JICA to provide inputs 
and comments at various stages in preparation of projects in areas where they are actively engaged.  The 
Bank will ensure that in joint areas of activity with ADB and JICA, and indeed with other development 
partners, the Bank‟s value addition is clearly established and will seek to coordinate messages to 
Government on related policy issues. The Bank will also continue its close collaboration with the UN in 
shared engagement areas and through joint support for capacity building.      

92. 
Government is taking two initiatives to improve aid effectiveness and harmonization.  One 
is the development of a new ODA Strategic Framework (OSF) for 2011-2015.  The OSF is aimed at 
laying out the Government‟s policies and guidelines for the mobilization, management, and utilization of 
ODA and less concessional loans in the context of the country‟s newly attained MIC status .  The OSF is 
expected to be approved by the Prime Minister in November 2011.  The other initiative is the ongoing 
revision of Decree 131 on management and utilization of ODA, led by MPI.  The Bank is actively 
supporting this process through provision of technical assistance.   

93. 
The World Bank continues to have a fruitful and open relationship with civil society.  
Beside the regular dialogues and consultations with CSOs on Bank policies and projects, and engagement 
with CSOs on project implementation, The Bank has been providing financial and technical resources, 
including the Vietnam Innovation Day and the Civil Society Fund, to CSOs to promote innovation at 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
grassroots level. The Bank will find opportunities to facilitate stronger participation of civil society in 
various mechanisms for dialogue between development partners and Government.    

V. 

RISKS 

Slowdown in the Global Economy 

94. 
Since its accession to the World Trade Organization in 2007, Vietnam has become highly 
exposed to regional and global economic shocks.  It is highly integrated with the rest of the world, with 
international trade constituting nearly 160 percent of its GDP and foreign direct investment and 
remittances together adding up to as much as 20 percent of GDP.  A global recession or a period of 
prolonged growth slowdown could have a dramatic impact on Vietnam‟s exports and industrial output, as 
was demonstrated during the 2009 global economic crisis.   

95. 
Unlike in 2009, when the Government responded with a large and timely stimulus package 
to stave off an economic crisis, the fiscal headroom is now limited.  Therefore, if such a scenario were 
to materialize, it could lead to a slowdown in implementation of the CPS program for several reasons, 
including a shortage of counterpart funds resulting in diversion of Government funds from investment 
operations in the CPS program aimed at supporting long-term growth.  Since the factors driving the risk 
of contagion are external and on a global scale, risk management measures include continued dialogue 
with Government agencies aimed at building better buffers against global shocks through improved 
domestic policy and economic management (e.g., increased foreign exchange reserves and more fiscal 
space to be able to finance a stimulus if needed), strengthened debt management capacity (a Debt 
Management Performance Assessment report for Vietnam is under preparation), and improved public 
financial management practices (a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment is 
also underway).  

Heightened Macroeconomic Instability 

96. 
During the past five years Vietnam has been experiencing recurring episodes of 
macroeconomic instability, fueled by external shocks and rooted in structural distortions in the 
economy.  Recent growth has been driven by factor accumulation financed by easy credit generating 
inefficiencies of investments, highly leveraged SOEs, doubtful portfolio quality in the banking sector, and 
rising risks of financial sector instability.  With the country in a political transition during the past 12 
months, Government initially found it difficult to undertake tough measures to stabilize the economy, 
such as cutting back on public investments or keeping real interest rates positive, as such measures would 
have adversely affected the bottom line of the corporate sector and increased the non-performing loans of 
the banks.  As a result, there was a significant build-up of contingent liabilities in the system.  However, 
this risk has eased following the completion of the political transition and appointment of a new 
administration that is keen to address many of the outstanding structural problems.    

97. 
Addressing these structural problems will take time, and continued macroeconomic 
instability is therefore a possibility during the next CPS period.  Continued high inflation would 
increase Bank-financed project costs and therefore also the need for additional financing operations to 
ensure that project development objectives can be met.  This would divert IDA resources from planned 
operations and put some program objectives at risk.  In addition, macroeconomic instability could 
compromise the impact of poverty reduction efforts under the CPS program.  The FSAP planned for 2012 
will help identify financial sector vulnerabilities and structural weaknesses more comprehensively and 
can form the basis of a detailed reform program to make the financial sector more resilient in the long

98. 
Dialogue with Government, in close collaboration with the IMF, will be stepped up during 
the next CPS period.  Regular monitoring and analysis of macroeconomic and financial indicators, 
including debt sustainability analysis and encouragement for greater accountability and transparency in 
macroeconomic and financial management, will remain a core part of the Bank‟s engagement.  There will 
also be ongoing support to Government to address medium-term structural distortions in the economy 
through investment and development policy lending, and analytical and advisory services.  At the request 
of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank is preparing a Debt Management Performance Assessment report 
and a Reform Plan Mission is scheduled in December 2011.  An FSAP planned for 2012 will help 
identify financial sector vulnerabilities as a basis for further World Bank Group support.  

Implementation Risks 

99. 
Timely development impact of the Bank’s portfolio is at risk mainly due to the slow 
implementation of investment operations.  As discussed above, the Bank is working closely with 
Government to improve the ODA management system, strengthen the procurement legal framework as 
well as implementation capacity, and address project-level issues jointly with the Ministry of Planning 
and Investment on a systematic basis.     

100. A relatively good legal framework on anti-corruption is in place, but implementation needs 
to be strengthened.  Conflicts of interest are widespread, and oversight institutions such as the Judiciary, 
National Assembly, and State Audit are not fully independent from the Executive.  During the CPS 
period, the Bank will continue a multi-pronged approach to managing this systemic risk to the CPS 
program.  This approach will include:  (i) continued technical assistance to State Audit, the Government 
Inspectorate, and the National Assembly to strengthen assurance and oversight; (ii) policy dialogue on 
measures to improve transparency in public administration, reduce risk of corruption, and improve 
systems of prevention and detection of collusive and corruptive practices; and (iii) internal audit capacity 
building in the Finance Ministry‟s Inspectorate, as well as other ministries and agencies, with a focus on 
risk-based audits and effective implementation of audit recommendations. 

101. A specific risk to implementation of the Bank’s portfolio is project-level corruption, given 
the fiduciary capacity constraints and systemic corruption risks discussed above.  In addition to 
fiduciary mitigation measures (see Box 8 above), the country team will ensure that project governance 
and anti-corruption plans are credible and implemented fully.  Progress in implementation of these plans 
will be monitored and measures agreed to address any gaps.  Internal audit functions and capacity 
building will continue to be incorporated in all projects when feasible.  Efforts to strengthen institutional 
governance and systematically take advantage of opportunities to enhance transparency, accountability 
and citizens‟ participation in projects should also help reduce corruption risks.  The Bank will prepare 
sector-specific governance assessments to better understand the key challenges affecting sector efficiency 
and inform project design.  These measures will become more critical as the Bank moves to design 
projects with greater reliance on country systems. 

102. A CPS Progress Report will be prepared in mid-FY14, as a mid-term review of CPS 
implementation.  It will assess progress to date toward achievement of CPS outcomes as gauged by 
indicators and milestones in the CPS results framework, and incorporate adjustments as needed to the 
strategy and program in light of changed circumstances, including (but not limited to) a slowdown in the 
global economy, heightened macroeconomic instability, and implementation issues.

Luis Alvaro Sanchez, Consultant

Under the guidance of:  Myla Taylor Williams, Country Program Coordinator, EACVQ

With inputs from members of the Vietnam Country Team 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

During the 2007-2011 CPS period, Vietnam attained lower middle-income status, continued to 
reduce poverty, and advanced institutional reform in line with the strategic objectives set out in 
Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010.  The country became IBRD eligible in 
2007 and received its first IBRD loan in 2009.  By the end of the CPS period, three key challenges have 
emerged:  (i) the sustainability of growth in the face of increased vulnerability to macroeconomic instability and 
adverse climatic shocks; (ii) concerns about its quality of growth in the face of unreliable infrastructure, and (iii) 
a slowdown in poverty reduction, particularly in remote ethnic minority communities. 

The Country Team rates aggregate progress toward achieving CPS outcomes as moderately 
satisfactory.  Across the broad range of engagement areas, the CPS program achieved results in line with 
expectations, without reversals or deficiencies.  However, program delivery fell somewhat short of the 
ambitious and broad institutional transformation goals set out in the CPS.  With hindsight, the expectations for 
institutional transformation did not take the constraints of the political economy and less favorable external 
environment of the country fully into account.  One aspect of the reform agenda, the share o f SOEs in GDP, has 
indeed declined during the CPS period.  Nonetheless, the broader transformation of the role of the State in the 
economy from producer to regulator (the overall objective of the CPS) has not been completed.  The reasons for 
this are complex and relate to factors of ideology, political economy, and the government‟s concept of a socialist 
market economy, which reserves considerable powers of leadership and intervention for the state.  However, a 
combination of analytical work, technical assistance and policy dialogue has set the basis, albeit with some 
delay, for delivering second generation institutional reform in the next CPS, but priority areas will need to be 
selected with care.   

The Country Team rates World Bank Group performance as satisfactory.  The WBG program grew in 
scope and size, aided by the greater availability of IDA and IBRD resources.  The Bank responded promptly and 
effectively to unexpected events, such as the food and global financial crises, and is responding to emerging 
concerns such as climate change.  Access to IBRD resources financed budget support in 2009 and 2010 that 
helped the authorities soften the impact of the external crisis.  IFC engagement maintained a strategic focus on 
the quality of the business environment and finance, while investments more than tripled towards the end of the 
period. Innovative components were introduced in the design of several projects, thereby setting the foundation 
for greater future impact.  Delivery improved with a shorter lag between Board approval and effectiveness, but 
slow implementation (reflected in low disbursement ratios and widespread extensions of project closing dates) 
remains an issue.  The Bank continues to be one of Vietnam‟s key development partners delivering results 
across a broad range of engagement areas in collaboration with others.

1. 

DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES 

2. 
The 2007-2011 CPS was implemented during a period of continued economic growth despite 
various external shocks, including the global financial crisis, enormous volatility in commodity prices, 
and several damaging typhoons.  In 2009, Vietnam reached a per capita income of USD1,010 (World Bank 
Atlas methodology), thereby surpassing the USD 1000 per capita target set for 2010 in the SEDP , and crossing 
the Bank‟s threshold for (lower) middle income country status.  

3. 
Vietnam’s economy grew at an average of 6.7 percent per annum in real terms over the 2007-2010 
period.  The 2008 global crisis hit Vietnam when the economy had stabilized after a period of overheating in 
2007, resulting from massive capital inflows.  Facing a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments 
and expecting sluggish external demand for exports in the wake of the global crisis, the government shifted 
policies toward supporting growth.  Monetary policy was loosened and a sizable fiscal package (5 percent of 
GDP) was executed.  As a result, Vietnam‟s real GDP grew by 5.3 percent in 2009, one of the better 
performances in developing Asia, but lower than Vietnam‟s growth rate of 6.3 percent in 2008, and also its 
lowest since 2000.  Robust growth in manufacturing supported by resilient external demand for Vietnam‟s 
exports also helped support growth in 2009.  By 2010, growth had recovered to 6.8 percent, partly on the back 
of a commodity price surge, strong export performance, and continued loosening of monetary policies during 
the last quarter of 2010.  

4. 
Indicators of Vietnam’s ability to create an enabling business environment have improved.  
According to the 2011 Doing Business Database, Vietnam was the fastest reformer in South East Asia from 
2005 to 2010, ranked 78 of 183 economies in 201123.  Nevertheless, Vietnam is in one of the most competitive 
regions in the world and ranks lower than most of its neighbors.  Its improved ranking also masks great variation 
across different aspects of the business environment.  For example, Vietnam scores very well on access to credit 
and contract enforcement, but very poorly on protecting investors and collecting taxes , and implementation of 
reform is slow.  Issues such as corruption, red tape, and lack of transparency are still high on the list of 
investors‟ concerns.  Despite some signs of modernization and an emerging trend of urbanization, structural 
transformation of the economy has not been profound.  Vietnam has continued to rely on exports of agricultural, 
mineral and other commodities and of light manufactured goods featuring low value addition and use of low 
skilled workers.  

5. 
Vietnam’s integration into the global economy deepened, but there are concerns about the quality 
of growth and efficiency of public investment.  Exports expanded briskly from $47.6 billion in 2007 to $71.6 
billion in 2010.  An increase in FDI helped the country‟s integration into the regional and the global economy.  
Food and agricultural products continue to be major drivers of exports.  Yet, many of Vietnam‟s export products 
are sold at lower prices than those of major competitors due to low or uneven quality and the virtual absence of 
recognized brands or geographical indicators. This has constrained translation of Vietnam‟s enormous 
agricultural export growth into a significant increase in wealth among the majority of farmers.  Furthermore, in 
some cases (e.g., aquatic products) this export expansion has been accompanied by insufficient attention to 
adverse environmental impacts.  In addition, growth has been underpinned by high levels of public and private 
investment (42 percent of GDP in 2010, of which 16 percent is public and 26 percent private), and the high 
Incremental Capital Output Ratios are raising concerns about the effectiveness of public investment, in 
particular.  

23 The 2010 World Competitiveness Report ranks Vietnam above many other countries with higher per capita incomes.  The 2009 IFC 
Enterprise Survey positions Vietnam well with comparator countries in the world.

6. 
The positive trend in reducing poverty continued, even if the pace slowed.  Vietnam is widely 
acknowledged for its high and sustained poverty reduction.  Poverty fell from 58.1 percent of the population in 
1993, to 28.9 percent in 2002, and to only 14.5 percent by 2008.  Early estimates from the 2010 Vietnam 
Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) suggest that poverty is continuing to fall, albeit at a slower rate 
than the first half of the 2000s.  It is increasingly concentrated in remote rural areas and among certain social 
groups (especially ethnic minority populations).  The slower pace of poverty reduction reflects the increasing 
challenges of reaching core poverty groups largely disconnected from the economy and its sources of growth.  
There are growing concerns about poverty and, in particular, vulnerability in Vietnam‟s cities and peri-urban 
areas due to a rising urban population (including a heavy influx of migrant workers), increasing demand for 
urban services, and a continuing rise in the cost of living.  Urban issues are emerging as one of the priority 
concerns for the authorities.  

7. 
Awareness of environmental and climate-related risks has increased.  The basic institutional and 
legal framework for environmental protection has been laid out, part ly through the Amended Law on 
Environmental Protection, effective in 2006, and the National Environmental Protection Strategy up to 2010 and 
related vision for 2020.  In addition, the Government adopted its National Target Program to Respond to 
Climate Change in December of 2008.  Various sector strategies have addressed environmental or climate 
change concerns such as those related to water, natural disaster management, and energy.  This institutional 
strengthening sets a more solid basis for addressing the mounting environmental vulnerabilities that include 
continued degradation of natural resources, the impact of pollution on human health, and weak monitoring 
systems and enforcement of rules.  However, despite the growing awareness of environmental issues, it remains 
to be seen whether the legal and regulatory changes will be effectively implemented. 

8. 
Macroeconomic volatility has emerged as a major concern.  The direction of macroeconomic policy 
has undergone various adjustments over the CPS period.  The Government initially aimed at stabilizing the 
economy as inflation peaked at 20 percent in 2008 (with food prices increasing by 28 percent that year).  As the 
global financial crisis hit, the focus turned to accommodation in early 2009, switched again but briefly to 
stabilization at the end of 2009, reversing to accommodation again by the middle of 2010, driven by political 
transition in 2010-2011.  Inflationary pressures followed the inflow of external resources that came in after the 
WTO accession and put pressure on the country‟s absorptive capacity.  In addition, the food crisis and the 
global financial crisis required countervailing policies which, while successful in meeting short-term objectives, 
induced volatility in the macroeconomic environment.  In addition, while the government has avoided major 
crises in the difficult environment during the past few years, the instability revealed weaknesses in the fiscal 
strength of the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector, most clearly illustrated by the recent problems of 
Vinashin, the shipbuilding economic group.  The country‟s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch and Moody‟s 
as well as S&P in 2010.  The immediate priority for the country is to address the risks to macroeconomic 
stability and, in doing so, re-establish the confidence of the markets and build buffers that may cushion the 
impact of future adverse shocks.  The Government recognizes this and has taken an important step in this 
direction by adopting Resolution 11, which lays out a plan to tackle the recent macro -economic instability and 
also address some of the underlying drivers of recurring instability.  The measures adopted under the Resolution 
11 have started to show results towards regaining Vietnam‟s macroeconomic stability, but issues remain in 
relation to the investment budget, reforms of the state-owned enterprises and measures on better communication 
with the market.  Therefore, initial success notwithstanding, there are reasons to remain vigilant and avoid 
premature withdrawal of the stabilization measures.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

9. 
The commitments made in the CPS and related results matrix - as amended by the CPS Progress 
Report in 2009 - form the basis for assessing the contribution of the CPS program to the achievement of 
Vietnam’s development objectives.  Appendix 1 takes detailed stock of the achievement of results and 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
identifies the corresponding delivery instruments and lessons learned for each outcome area.  The main findings 
from this stocktaking are discussed below.  Details are presented in Appendix 1. 

A. Pillar 1: Improving the Business Environment 

10. 
The CPS period saw a number of improvements in the business environment.  A simplification of 
rules for businesses fostered a rapid increase in small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  Furthermore, the share 
of the SOE sector in the economy declined marginally with the equitization24 of close to 1,000 public 
enterprises.  IFC advisory services, with the support of a multi-donor Trust Fund, worked with the authorities 
on promoting business procedure simplification.  The Bank focused on simplifying procedures and improving 
compliance in tax and customs that led to greater client satisfaction, as shown in recent surveys.  In addition, 
innovation is beginning to receive greater attention as part of a strategy for greater involvement in private sector 
development, broadening its scope beyond a focus on Doing Business indicators.  

11. 
However, the governance of SOEs remains a concern for the quality of the business environment.  
The State Capital Investment Corporation created to enhance the governance of the remaining public enterprises 
does not cover the large economic groups, whose increasing importance is raising concerns about an uneven 
playing field for the state and private corporate sectors and concerns about risks to fiscal and financial 
sustainability.  Improving the governance of SOEs has been a fixture of the PRSC dialogue; the slow progress 
reflects the government‟s policy stance that the large economic groups are important vehicles for competing in a 
WTO environment.  

12. 
The CPS scaled up engagement in higher education and human capital development as part of the 
effort to support greater competitiveness.  The first operation in the Higher Education DPO series supported 
the development and implementation of an adequate institutional framework for improved higher education, 
which the Second Higher Education DPO and the New Model Universities Project will support further.  The IFC 
has also been actively involved in human capital development through its advisory work, including through 
raising the capacity of trainers and supervisors in garment and corporate governance activities and through 
financial services.   

13. 
The program delivered solid results in the financial sector within the limits imposed by a slow -
moving institutional agenda.  The 2010 revisions of the laws on Credit Institutions and on the State Bank 
should allow Vietnam to address concerns about the strength and sustainability of the financial sector.  
Preparation of these laws was aided by technical assistance (IDF grant and FIRST Initiative) and analytical work 
that also supported changes in regulations on loan classification and provision, prudential ratios for the safer 
operation of commercial banks, and disclosure and supervision. Although these laws came later than expected, 
efforts are making headway at transforming the way SBV, the Credit Information Center and Deposit Insurance 
of Vietnam conduct their core functions.  In addition, progress in improving the inter-bank payment system has 
provided a technical and institutional platform for fast, timely and safer clearance and settlement of financial 
transactions among banks and between regions.  The IFC made good progress on promoting moveable asset 
collateral registries to allow micro-borrowers and SMEs to post moveable assets as collateral. In addition, they 
provided support to improve the institutional framework for access to finance for SMEs and micro -borrowers.  
Nevertheless, as the owner of five large financial groups, the state remains a dominant player in finance, and 
efforts to improve the governance of large economic groups would benefit the stability of the financial sector.  A 
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was not carried out as intended during the CPS period, but the 
Government has now agreed to undertake an FSAP.

14. 
IFC increased its commitments in Vietnam from USD62 million in FY07 to over USD1 billion in 
FY11, including their asset management business.  Trade finance over the five-year period totaled USD970 
million. It implemented a counter-cyclical strategy that helped clients withstand the market volatility, and its 
active involvement in the financial sector is contributing to improving governance.  As a result of Vietnam‟s 
financial crisis in 2007 and the global crisis and economic downturn that followed in 2008, othe r lenders and 
financiers withdrew from Vietnam, investment slowed, exports declined, and the government shifted to 
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.  IFC launched the Global Trade Finance program in Vietnam, 
providing guarantees to banks for trade related deals on a per-transaction basis, and access to trade finance 
through an extensive global network of bank partners.  Focused mainly on the top tier banks, the program has 
been an important source of long-term liquidity, with over USD500 million lent to SMEs over the past three 
years.  The IFC has also introduced the sector to new financial products in nascent or underserved markets, such 
as SME and energy efficiency financing.  As the banking sector sought to strengthen its capital base in 2009 and 
2010, the IFC engaged top-tier banks to place equity and long-term capital, and supported the transition of the 
sector to more market-oriented decision-making and governance practices.  The IFC complemented investment 
activities by scaling up advisory services delivered to the financial sector, with a focus on risk mitigation, 
financial infrastructure sustainability, and support to banks to standardize the short -term loan process as they 
shifted away from longer-term lending.  IFC established the Corporate Governance project in 2008, which aims 
to improve financial performance (reduced costs of capital, higher valuations, and/or improved loan terms), and 
operational efficiency (improved operations and/or clearer roles) by promoting better corporate governance 
practices among companies in Vietnam.  In 2010, IFC launched an energy efficiency financing program proving 
capital, and advisory services to help banks develop new lending products.  

15. 
The CPS contributed to agricultural and rural development through excellent results in 
increasing access to credit, especially for women25, and improvements in the efficiency and transparency 
of the land administration system.  In agriculture, the Bank‟s efforts are now increasingly focusing on 
increased efficiency, sustainability and value addition in agricultural supply chains. 

16. 
Vietnam has increased generation capacity and reliability while taking the first steps towards 
broader sector reform supported by the Bank group’s financial as well as advisory engagement .  
Investments in transmission and distribution have helped expand the electricity network and its reliability 
through reduced technical losses, which jointly with tariff realignment have improved the financial soundness of 
the main public sector energy holding company (EVN) and enabled it to expand capacity, nearly reaching the 
goal of doubling capacity.  In addition, a process of improving the institutional foundation in energy has been 
initiated, with the separation of the transmission, distribution and generation assets and the creation of a dispatch 
center.  This achievement should help deliver reliable and cost-efficient electricity over the long term.26 

17. 
Increased Bank support in the transport sector has financed investments, quality improvements, 
and institutional innovation to improve governance.  The program has progressed well on the development 
objectives in the Road Network Improvement Project on improving the road network, as well as on addressing 
challenges in implementation of agreements under the Resettlement Action Plan.  The Bank has furthermore 
responded positively to the Government‟s request to provide complementary financing for broadening Highway 
I, the main corridor linking South and North. Dialogue and technical assistance under the Road Safety Project 
are contributing to a lower incidence of traffic accidents. Investments to upgrade multimodal transportation 
along the two main river deltas (the Mekong River and the Red River) are on track to expand the length of the 
waterways and the highways. Sector work and policy dialogue have supported several initiatives geared towards 
(a) sustainable financing, including work to assist the Ministry of Transport with drafting a decree to establish a 

25 The assistance has been delivered by the Rural Finance II and now Rural Finance III. 
26 The Bank supported the development of this institutional agenda through the PRSC series and recently through the first Power Sector 
Development DPL.

Road Maintenance Fund, (b) assistance to develop an expressway network in Vietnam, setting out guidance on 
key financing, regulatory and institutional issues for the organization of the expressway sector in Vietnam, and 
(c) a study on Urban Transportation Investment in Medium-sized Cities in Vietnam, which prepared a strategic 
framework for small and medium-sized cities in Vietnam to support the development of sustainable urban 
transportation infrastructure.  Lastly, improving sector governance is receiving increased attention, and to reduce 
risks of malfeasance the Bank has introduced the use of Technical Audits and Governance, Transparency and 
Anti-corruption Plans (GTAP) on all transport projects. 

18. 
Gaps in provision of water and sanitation services are being reduced in urban areas.  Access to 
potable water as well as the number of households with septic tanks stand around 75 percent (up from 58 
percent in 2006) in urban centers in 2009. I n the big cities, over 90 percent of the population has access to 
potable water.  In addition, there was good progress, supported by the Bank, in developing the legal and 
regulatory framework for: (i) water supply, by moving  towards a commercial orientation, and (ii) sanitation, 
through introducing the „polluter pays‟ principle as well as cost recovery.  Analytical work on urban issues has 
been taking stock of the rising urban challenges that affect the quality of life as well as competitiveness in line 
with the emerging Government priority on urban development.  

19. 
The reliability and adequacy of infrastructure remain a concern, despite recent gains.  The 
reliability of energy, the quality of water, the reliability and efficiency of transport networks, and the demand -
responsiveness and effectiveness of public agricultural support services are often ranked as some of the main 
constraints to competiveness and quality of life.  The full amount of resources needed to close these gaps far 
exceeds what is available from the public sector, so participation of the private sector rema ins an important 
component of any strategy that seeks greater efficiency of investments and resource mobilization.  However, the 
progress towards the stated CPS objective to involve the private sector in financing and management of new 
infrastructure has been limited to pilot initiatives.  Both the World Bank and the IFC have been preparing to play 
active roles in engaging the private sector in infrastructure through public-private partnerships.  IFC has invested 
in two port projects as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and has also been advising on the Nghi Son 2 power 
plant PPP, all of which have been successful examples of private sector participation in infrastructure and go 
beyond pilot projects.  However, work is still needed in terms of convincing the government to recognize these 
as models for further PPP development. 

B. Pillar 2:  Strengthening Social Inclusion 

20. 
Rural areas are more connected to markets and services, and rural populations are on average 
closer to roads  and have greater access to electricity.  The percentage of the rural population with access to 
safe water has also increased (from 62 percent in 2005 to 83 percent in 2011).  The CPS contribution came 
through a series of operations that maintained continuity with the previous CPS.  Some of the operations are 
exemplary and innovative, such as the Rural Energy series, which IEG considers a source of valuable lessons for 
other countries.  The Community Driven Development (CDD) approach used with the poorest communities has 
proven an effective instrument for outreach, as seen e.g. through the recently completed Community Based 
Rural Infrastructure Project.  The Red River Delta Rural Water Supply project, which has increased access to 
water supply, introduced cost recovery and sustainable delivery models for rural water supply as well as 
microfinance for sanitation. 

21. 
Coverage of affordable quality health care services and primary education has continued to 
increase in both rural and urban areas.  The CPS program contributed to major progress towards full-day 
schooling. Uniform performance standards for teachers are in place, building on efforts under the previous CPS.  
National tests show improvements in the performance of primary students and tuition in secondary and tertiary 
education is being introduced to better reflect market conditions and enhance policies to protect the poor.  While 
retaining its focus on improving quality, work in education is expanding to cover primary education for disabled 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
children and pre-school education.  Analytical work contributed to the government‟s 2020 education strategy.  
The major concern lies with the governance of the education system and informal practices that require parents 
to make additional contributions to school and teachers.  On health, the Bank supported the authorities in 
drawing operational and policy lessons.  This led to a revised Health Strategy by law in 2008. All citizens are 
now eligible for health insurance coverage, with the national budget supporting the participation of the poor and 
the informal sector.  In addition, the law establishes a framework for national standards and a unified licensing 
system for health care practitioners.  Effective coverage of health insurance, including for the poor and the near-
poor increased from 43.8 percent in 2008 to an unofficial estimate of 62 percent today.  Additional Bank 
contributions have centered on improving health services and enhancing access to and quality of these services 
as well as supporting regional blood transfusion centers and safe practices in relation to HIV/AIDS.   

22. 
Ethnic minorities in rural areas are more integrated into development processes, but big 
challenges remain.  The Bank and several development partners have supported the government‟s priority of 
empowering ethnic minorities first through self-standing operations and more recently through a collective DPO 
series (the P-135), which supports a Government program in providing basic infrastructure to poor communities 
by bringing improvements to different aspects of the planning and implementation of the program.  Reviews of 
the first Northern Mountain Poverty Reduction Project identified the sustainability of the communal investments 
as a risk and therefore the P-135 also emphasized the need to finance maintenance in order to achieve 
sustainability.  Less progress was achieved under the program‟s livelihoods support activities.  The Government 
has recently designed the scope and institutional responsibilities under a new National Target Program on 
Poverty Reduction. It is anticipated that many of the reforms adopted under P-135 will be carried over in the 
implementation of the new program.  While continued refinements in the approach to infrastructure planning, 
development and maintenance are anticipated, questions remain as to the best approaches to broaden livelihood 
opportunities available to ethnic minority communities.  

23. 
Increased attention was given to the development of a comprehensive social protection system.  
Building on the 2008 Vietnam Development Report (VDR) on Social Protection and a policy note assessing 
Vietnam's social safety net in 2010, the Bank and the Government of Vietnam deepened their policy dialogue on 
strengthening both the pension and social assistance systems.  On pensions, the Bank has been providing 
technical assistance for planned revisions to the Social Insurance Law, including on (a) extending pension 
coverage to the informal sector; (b) enhancing the fiscal sustainability of the pension system and the 
administrative capacity and fund management practices of Vietnam Social Security (VSS); and (c) introducing a 
unified beneficiary identification number for VSS programs. Moreover , the Bank and VSS have been exploring 
options for supporting administrative reforms in VSS, though a final decision has not been reached.  On social 
assistance, policy dialogue has been initiated on strengthening the social safety net through the possible 
introduction of a cash transfer program to address chronic poverty and help the poor and vulnerable better 
respond to shocks. 

24. 
Vietnam has made good progress in addressing gender disparities. Less progress has been made 
in mainstreaming gender into the Bank program.  A gender equality law is in place and under the PRSC 
series, efforts were made at unifying the legal framework on gender.  The country ranks relatively well on 
gender issues, with major progress being made over the last decade.  Nevertheless, gender gaps remain in 
relation to the forced retirement age as well as employment and wage levels, especially in the informal 
economy.   

53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  Pillar 3: Strengthening Natural Resource and Environmental Management27 

25. 
The Bank has worked with the Government on a wide range of analytical work that raised the 
awareness of the nature and scope of environmental challenges and the capacity to meet them.  The 2011 
VDR focuses on managing natural resources and a country-specific climate change strategy for the Bank has 
been produced.  These two products and related work form a basis from which to provide greater coherence to 
ongoing and forthcoming activities on a wide range of concerns from forestry to water management, land 
degradation, natural risk prevention, rising urban pollution and global warming.  The Bank has been scaling up 
support in this area through investment and technical assistance.  

26. 
Progress in sustaining and managing natural resources (especially forest and water) includes an 
improved institutional setting and achievement of targeted objectives on the ground.  The direct support on 
forestry is helping form smallholder plantations that meet international standards for sustainable forestry, but 
little data is available on progress in the forestry sector.  Through the PRSC series, the CPS has supported the 
development of linkages between the protective and economic functions of forests as well as developing 
guidelines for forest development. In addition, it has helped clarify the responsibilities for integrated rural basin 
management and the issuance of guidelines for the efficient use of water resources.  Support for water resource 
management has been included in a range of Bank operations.  Less progress has been made in the overall 
protection of critical natural habitats, but a range of small GEF-financed projects contributed to protection of 
selected key protected areas.  The Bank furthermore provided TA to the Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environment (MONRE) to support their development of a nationa l strategy on Climate Change, currently in 
draft form. 

27. 
Ambitious programs for redressing the gaps in the management of household sanitation (and less 
so industrial pollution) as well as for renewable energy are underway .  The CPS program has been actively 
involved in addressing the gaps in household sanitation with good progress on (a) the legal and regulatory 
framework and (b) increasing coverage, considering the low base from which the work started.  A lending 
program is in place to meet remaining challenges. In addition, initiatives on industrial pollution included a rich 
program of analytical work carried out jointly with the Government and preparation of an IDA credit on 
industrial pollution (planned for FY13).  Industrial wastewater treatment still needs significant attention, as less 
than 30 percent of the wastewater from industrial parks is treated in centralized facilities.  Progress toward a 
lower-intensity carbon economy was made through investments in energy demand side management and 
renewable energy development.  Achievements thus far include removing barriers to small scale (up to 30MW) 
renewable energy development, the issuance of a standardized “no negotiations” Power Purchase Agreement 
(PPA) and an avoided-cost tariff formula for small renewable projects to connect to the grid. The target of 
200MW renewable capacity has been met (doubled) by the end of the CPS period.  

28. 

During the CPS, both the Government and the Bank increased attention to climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, thus forming the basis for a fuller agenda in the next CPS.  The Vietnam 
Program recently developed a Climate Change Strategy, which reports on the Bank‟s involvement in a range of 
investments and analytical work on adaptation and mitigation during the CPS period. Attention to innovation 
and partnerships has been a key feature of Bank engagement.  Efforts under the Montreal Protocol Project 
supported the government in phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) through promoting the use of non -ozone 
depleting substances.  In April 2011, the Vietnam Government, through the Bank‟s support, also obtained the 

27 Initially the CPS focused on two result clusters: (a) “Better sustaining and managing natu ral resources” and (b) “Improved 
management effectiveness of household and industrial pollution .”  The CPS Progress Report from 2009 added a third results cluster on 
“Improved climate change adaptation and mitigation.”

Montreal Protocol Multilateral Funds in phasing out hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).  A Clean Technology 
Fund (CTF) was approved and an innovative carbon finance program launched.   

D. Pillar 4: Improving Governance 

29. 
The CPS program built on an ongoing agenda of: (a) improving public financial management 
(PFM),  (b) more participatory approaches as a way of modernizing planning towards development 
objectives, and (c) lowering corruption in key services.  Towards the end of the CPS period, the attention to 
sector governance was broadening the scope of the engagement, following a more thematic approach. The 2010 
VDR on Modern Institutions examined (a) the process of devolution of power to lower levels of government and 
(b) and the changing accountability system.  The 2010 VDR confirms the significant progress that Vietnam has 
made in governance over the long haul, but notes disconnects between devolution and accountability that have 
opened a wedge, which is creating opportunities for corruption.  

30. 
Good progress has been made on the public financial management agenda.  Some of the 
achievements include piloting an Integrated Chart of Accounts in central ministries and over half the provinces 
and publishing budget execution information in a timely manner.  Contributors to the achievements are the 
Financial Management Project, a multi-donor Trust Fund on Public Financial Management, and the PRSC 
series.  Existing evaluations of long-term progress in the area of PFM and budget processes have been positive , 
as can be seen in the IEG review of the first eight PRSC operations, the recently concluded Country Financial 
Accountability Assessment (CFAA)/Country Procurement Assessment Report, and the 2010 VDR28.  However, 
gaps are likely to remain at the level of medium term planning, procurement, internal audit, reporting and the 
modernization of fiscal practices at the provincial and communal levels.  The government is conducting a PEFA 
self-assessment to support the current agenda, identify gaps, lay out the work ahead and contribute to the 
preparation of the new State Budget Law.  The Bank is providing the necessary guidance and quality assurance 
support to the government during the process.  

31. 
During the 2009 global crisis, the CPS scaled up efforts to improve the institutional set-up for 
selecting and implementing public investment.  The policy content of the Public Investment Reform (PIR) 
DPO to help the country mitigate the impact of the global crisis focused on improving the institutional basis for 
public investment, thus responding to a recurrent concern of the authorities and the development community 
regarding the effectiveness of public investment.  The PIR has successfully supported legislative amendments 
(Land, Procurement Law, Investment Law, Construction Law and Enterprise Law) to overhaul the fragmented 
and overlapping regulatory framework, although there is still uncertainty regarding the possible approval of the 
Law on Public Investment linked to the second DPO operation.  In addition, the Project Preparation Technical 
Assistance Facility Project has been put in place to support efforts to ensure readiness for implementation and 
quality of such investment.  Neither the PIR nor the Project Preparation Project was considered in the initial 
CPS design but provide good examples of the readiness of the program to address emerging challenges.   

32. 
Pilot efforts at introducing participatory planning and execution have been successful.  Vietnam‟s 
forceful decentralization drive has transferred considerable power to local authorities in the management and use 
of public resources.  In this context, the CPS program supported more participatory approaches to planning and 
execution with success, through several CDD operations and the P-135 DPO.  With hindsight, however, the 
World Bank could have engaged more forcefully with the decentralizat ion process in terms of increasing 
capacity and strengthening accountability, a weakness noted in the 2010 VDR on Modern Institutions.  The lack 
of good quality data in support of planning, monitoring and evaluation remains an additional weak point. 

28Like in many other countries, the Vietnam process of pushing for reforms through the PFM program has been lengthy, but the program 
has nevertheless been viewed as delivering substantial improvements over the long haul. 

55 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
33. 
Understanding of the scope of administrative corruption increased, but the impact of anti-
corruption measures is somewhat unclear.   The 2010 VDR on Modern Institutions finds that administrative 
corruption is substantial as indicated by surveys.  However, overall corruption is assessed by respondents as 
having remained at the same level or decreased slightly, with some indicators improving and others 
deteriorating.  Thus, the emphasis on reducing administrative corruption is on the right track, as in the customs 
and tax projects as has been mentioned under pillar 129.  Issues such as asset declaration, undertaking 
compliance audits for public procurement, and overall support for selected aspects of the Government‟s Anti -
Corruption Strategy received attention through the PRSC and progress has been made, although the lack of a 
supporting monitoring system to track the impact of the implementation to some exten t impairs assessment of 
the effectiveness of these efforts.  The pace of implementation of the Law on Corruption Prevention and Control 
has been slow. 

III.  BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE  

A. Design  

34. 
The SEDP 2006-2010 laid out a path of transition towards a socialist market economy and 
foresaw Vietnam reaching middle-income country status by 2010.  The WBG anchored the 2007-2011 CPS 
on the SEDP, a strategy it judged satisfactory in facing the challenges of continued growth and poverty 
reduction30.  The 2007 VDR, Aiming High, laid out the analytical underpinnings of the CPS strategy.  The CPS 
maintained the focus of the previous CAS on: (a) improving the business environment, (b) social service 
delivery, and (c) governance.  It added the need to address environment challenges as a fourth pillar, thus 
aligning with the four pillars of the SEDP.  The commitment to improving the CPS program performance 
emphasized: (a) higher disbursement ratios, (b) shorter preparation and effectiveness lags, and (c) timely 
delivery of results by reducing project extensions.  The design of the results framework took into account the 
lessons learned from the Completion Report of the FY01-F06 CAS, linking the results more tightly with the 
interventions.  The FY07-FY11 CPS had a carry-over program of 37 operations under implementation. The 
PRSC series remained the main instrument of policy dialogue31.  It is assessed that the design of the CPS, 
including the alignment with the four pillars used in the SEDP worked relatively well.  However, the CPS 
design could have benefitted from having the selectivity criteria set much more tightly.  Nonetheless, the CPS 
was implemented during a period of rapidly growing engagement, and accommodating certain emerging needs 
was essential in supporting the country.   

B.  Implementation     

35. 
Commitments exceeded expectations under the CPS, driven by larger IDA allocations and access 
to IBRD financing.  The Bank committed a total of USD4,471 million with annual commitments increasing 
from USD710 million in FY07 to USD2,348 million in FY11, of which around USD1,068 million came from 
IBRD funding.  As of the end of FY11, USD5,518 million of IDA resources had been committed for 
disbursement. IFC commitments totaled USD1,800 million over the 5 year period, including commitments 
through their asset management business.  

29 The Customs Project was cancelled in FY11 before completion, for reasons shown under Outcome 1.1 in Appendix 1, which also 
includes lessons learned in relation to the cancellation . 
30 The IMF-World Bank Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), discussed by the Board on December 5, 2006. 
31 The SEDP 2006-2010 made direct and clear statements regarding the regional development orientation of the plan.  To a considerable 
extent these orientations have been driving the demand for assistance from the Bank and other development partners. With hindsight, the 
CPS could have paid more explicit attention to these orientations.  

56 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
                                                 
 
36. 
Alignment of the CPS program with national priorities has been an important driver of results.  
With a focus on infrastructure and regional/local interventions, the CPS program successfully reflects the 
Government‟s political priority to seek expansion of services and opportunities across the national territory.  In 
fact, by the end of FY11, 80 percent of the portfolio by sectors was concentrated in energy (22 percent), 
transport (23 percent), urban (21 percent) and rural development (14 percent).  In addition, a good share of the 
CPS program is targeted towards provincial and local levels, with a focus on poverty.  Historically, alignment 
with national priorities has contributed to Vietnam‟s good performance, as seen by the fact that all Bank projec ts 
completed in Vietnam have been rated as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory (See Appendix 4).  Looking 
only at this CPS period, the program exhibits a similar performance up to now: of 18 Bank operations completed 
between 2006 and 2010, 12 were rated as satisfactory and 6 as moderately satisfactory.  Alignment of IFC's 
program has fitted and supported how the private sector has developed - focusing on financial institutions - both 
building their capital bases and also taking them into new product areas (SME financing, housing lending, 
energy efficiency lending) and developing the institutional infrastructure required to improve access to finance.  
Later in the five-year period, IFC responded to the global financial crisis by rolling out its Global Trade Finance 
Program, providing USD970 million of liquidity to Vietnam's exporters as other financial institutions withdrew. 

37. 
The program has seen an increase in the stock of commitments and some improvements in 
delivery.  The Bank disbursed USD4,695 million during the CPS period, going from USD475 million in FY07 
to USD1,170 in FY11.  There has been some increase in disbursement rates of SILs from 12.7 percent in FY07, 
although the FY10 disbursement ratio of 18.8 percent could not be sustained in FY11, which ended with a 
disbursement rate of 14.9 percent.  Funds disbursed under SILs increased from USD374 million in FY07 to 
USD653 million in FY11.  The program has seen a rising stock of commitments and a larger share of budget 
support operations. While the slight increase in the disbursement ratio is due in part to the greater maturity of the 
projects under implementation, the Country Team has also focused more attention on the Bank‟s portfolio, 
including through joint high level reviews of problematic and at-risk projects. Furthermore, an Action Plan was 
developed in the realm of the Six Banks Group as a result of the Joint Portfolio Performance Review32, which 
focuses on reducing common impediments or barriers to implementation, but it is not yet clear to what extend 
this has had a significant impact on implementation.  The time lag between loan approvals and effectiveness was 
reduced from 7.6 months in FY07 to 2.6 months in FY11.  However, the average lag/delay of 2 years in 
implementing projects identified in the 2007 Portfolio Review remains the same.  The number of extended 
projects went from 4 projects in FY07 to 9 projects in FY11. Some of the extensions have provided additional 
financing to cover cost increases, especially as a result of high inflation in 2009.  However, implementation is 
still delayed by inadequate readiness for implementation at the point of effectiveness as well as by problematic 
procurement practices.  IFC's portfolio performed well during the financial crisis, with restructurings assoc iated 
with project-specific issues rather than macroeconomic conditions.  

38. 
Greater attention to upstream design and innovation is planting seeds for enhanced effectiveness 
and impact.  On the Bank side, the design of the P-135 DPO as a budget support operation was path-breaking 
by linking disbursements to institutional changes needed to improve delivery of this national program rather 
than disbursing against program expenditures.  The Project Preparation Technical Assistance Facility Project is 
another example of focusing on design to facilitate implementation.  The shift towards sector DPO programs has 
been accompanied by institutional deepening.  On the IFC side, an emphasis on aligning strategy and project 
design between IFC's investment and advisory business has paid off.  Much of the work IFC has done to 
develop the public goods of institutional infrastructure and a framework for private sector development (the

nine-point action plan was developed to improve the effectiveness of ODA project implementation, and endorsed under a Prime Minister 
Decision in July 2008.  The Sixth JPPR was finalized in November 2009. Implementation progress, jointly monitored under the 
leadership of MPI, has been uneven to date, with progress on procurement unremarkable. The last Country Program Portfolio Review 
(CPPR) was undertaken in FY08.

Vietnam Business Forum, the Vietnam Bond Market Association, the Bank Training Center, various regulatory 
and tax reform projects, and the Vietnam Corporate Governance Forum) has provided IFC with credibility and 
presence as a partner for both the private sector and government in Vietnam's economic development.  
Furthermore, IFC's ability to combine investment capital and advisory services at the investment level has 
allowed IFC to develop game-changing interactions such as IFC's investment in Vietinbank, the first major 
equitization to be completed after the global financial crisis , and the development of the energy efficiency 
lending market.   

39. 
The WBG program has been responding to unforeseen circumstances and emerging challenges. 
The Bank provided timely support to Vietnam to address the impact of the 2008/2009 global financial crisis .  In 
the absence of an IMF program, the Bank was a key interlocutor on policy issues, including fiscal policy.  
Additional funding from IBRD sources allowed the government to take an anti-cyclical fiscal stance.  The 
program is now responding to emerging risks such as increased macro-economic volatility through intense 
policy dialogue and analytical work.  For IFC, the financial crisis also allowed the institution to play a counter-
cyclical role, providing funding and advice at a time when global financial institutions were reducing their 
exposure to Vietnam.  IFC was able to roll out new products that unexpectedly met huge demand , such as the 
Global Trade Finance Program, which is expected to lead to the development of other short -term lending 
products to increase access to finance for rural and agricultural borrowers.  IFC's decentralization, placing 
decision-making  and execution capacity closer to the client and giving client relationship managers a greater 
role and voice in developing and executing business has been key in IFC understanding its countercyclical role 
and building its program in Vietnam and identifying the right partners to engage with during a time of financial 
crisis. 

40. 
The Bank program expanded and broadened its coverage.  While it was to respond to the emerging 
needs, the expansion is of concern as well.  The number of operations in place increased from 39 by the end of 
FY06 to 50 by the end of FY11, and the average size of the new loans has expanded partly due to the increased 
use of DPOs33.  The administrative cost of a growing portfolio and lending pipeline is putting pressure on other 
parts of the program, notably AAA.   

41. 
As intended in the CPS, the PRSC series was the main instrument for policy dialogue between the 
Government, the Bank and other members of the development community.  The PRSC maintained a 
flexible approach within the range of CPS areas of engagement, with the emphasis on supporting the policy 
reform process while nurturing strategic breakthroughs. When breakthroughs occurred, deepening of the policy 
reforms shifted to budget support operations such as in higher education, energy, and public investment 34.  An 
IEG evaluation found the contribution of the first eight PRSC operations to development outcomes as well as to 
the Bank performance satisfactory. In addition, the PRSC series brought together a large group of development 
partners (varying from 3 to 11) who contributed 43 percent of total resources of PRSCs 1-9.  The PRSC series 
overall has received favorable reviews, but towards the end of the series it has been raised whether the 
operations focused too much on „process‟ and too little on „action‟, a point that should be considered when 
designing the new policy lending series to take the place of the PRSC.  

42. 
The CPS continued the practice of producing a yearly flagship publication, the Vietnam 
Development Report (VDR) jointly with other members of the donor community.  The Bank delivered a 
strong AAA program despite budget pressure.  The VDRs are appreciated by the government and development 
partners.35  Although nominally the production of these reports absorbs a small amount of resources, a good 

33 The average size of SILs also increased considerably, from USD130 million in FY07 to USD271 million in FY11 (excluding AF).

share of the other Economic and Sector Work (ESW) feeds into these reports.  Arguably, in the process, 
traditional ESW such as public expenditure reviews and sector analysis to inform on key priorities such as 
competitiveness (agriculture, technology), volatility, structural transformation, and fiscal and financial 
sustainability has declined.  The shift to programmatic AAA announced by the CPS Progress Report has been 
initiated with support for major pieces of work, including on urbanization, poverty, and food security.  

IV.  KEY LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

43. 
The Vietnam program continued its strong record of development impact across a broad range of 
areas, with 32 completed projects for which all available development outcome ratings were either 
Satisfactory (S) or Moderately Satisfactory (MS) (See Appendix 4).  The World Bank Group‟s partnership 
with the authorities and the development community is strong.  As Vietnam has become a lower middle income 
country and is seeking to become a modern industrialized economy, new challenges are emerging that call for 
the WBG to adjust its business model.  Innovations in delivery practices combined with a continued strong 
partnership with the authorities should allow for a gradual readjustment of the program.   

44. 
The WBG needs to respond to the emerging vulnerabilities and challenges in Vietnam with 
adequate policy and technical support as well as financial resources.  The WBG has already begun to 
address macroeconomic, environment, climate change and urban vulnerabilities jointly with the nationa l goal of 
increasing the sophistication of the economy through AAA and some operations.  To strengthen the response, 
the WBG must close the gaps that remain from the past CPS (SOE corporate governance, private sector 
development, etc.). 

45. 
The WBG should maintain a demand-driven focus within a framework of selectivity that 
prioritizes those areas where the WBG can contribute the most to meeting current challenges for 
Vietnam.  As noted, alignment with national priorities has helped the quality of program implementation.  At 
the same time, the potential areas of new engagement have been increasing and the tendency is for a further 
expansion to new areas.  The WBG needs to carefully select what it supports and how to achieve the best results, 
including by continuing to support the “unfinished” agenda in relation to poverty reduction and provision of 
basic social services and infrastructure to the most disadvantaged. 

46. 
The principles guiding selectivity need to be tightened to avoid diffusing the Bank’s program too 
thinly.  A selectivity strategy could focus, for instance, on transferring mature programs to the budget, with the 
Bank supporting well designed new areas of engagement with clear exit strategies for capacity building.  Certain 
criteria should be met for an operation to be added to the Bank‟s Vietnam program. 

47. 
Attention to implementation should be complemented with greater attention to program and 
project design. Downstream attention to implementation has yielded results, and efforts shou ld continue.  
However, they should be complemented by greater attention to design and selection of instruments.  Such efforts 
have already been initiated and the Country Team will continue its focus on improving design and exploring 
alternative delivery approaches that accelerate the delivery of intended results.  

48. 
Commitments on institutional reform should be credible while still pushing to move the agenda 
forward.  The CPS committed its support to a major institutional transformation of the country as the basis for 
delivering and sustaining middle income status.  The institutional attainments, while notable, fell short of 
expectations, in part because of the breadth of the agenda.  The coming strategy should take a more realistic and 
strategic view of the targets for institutional reform, identifying to the extent possible such targets in dialogue 
with government.  Rather than making unilateral commitments that lack credible backing from the counterpart, 
the WBG should maintain and strengthen an advocacy dialogue through AAA and other instruments that inform 

59 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the authorities and the country about institutional options.  The outcome of this dialogue can then be introduced 
into the program gradually as agreements are reached. 

49. 
One of the lessons coming out of the PRSC series (the later operations) and the recent PIR 
operations is that strong Government ownership of the reform program is even more important as 
Vietnam undertakes second generation reforms which are more complex and tend to take longer.  
Engagement areas for policy reforms should be chosen more selectively as there are limited resources to tackle 
increasingly complex challenges.  Adequate time should be invested to build a strong dialogue underpinned by 
solid analytical work with the aim of strengthening Government ownership of reforms. 

50. 
Attention should be given to decentralization issues, including the emerging challenges of urban 
development.  According to the 2010 VDR on Modern Institutions, the transfer of fiscal resources and 
implementation power has created a wedge between control and accountability at the local level, which can 
affect effectiveness and open opportunities for corruption. At the same time, a large portion of the investment 
program of the Bank is implemented at the local level in line with Central Government preferences, while the 
urban development challenges are mounting.  The new CPS could evaluate possibilities for supporting capacity 
building at the local level, beginning perhaps with a needs assessment that takes stock of the status and impact 
of the decentralization experience and the performance of the Bank program on the ground.  It may also seek to 
contribute to addressing the wedge between the allocation of responsibilities and the structure of accountability 
at the local level. 

51. 
IFC and the Bank should focus on developing sector-specific strategies that combine the strengths 
of both institutions.  This is increasingly important as Vietnam looks to address the infrastructure gap, the 
impact of growth and industrialization on the environment and looks to integrate the rural economy and 
populations into Vietnam's economic growth.  For example, in infrastructure, the two organizations br ing more 
to the table combined than any other development finance institution.   

52. 
The results framework could be used more regularly as a tool for setting strategic priorities and 
monitoring accountability.  While the CPS results framework was more aligned with the program than the 
previous CAS framework, it was broad and extensive, but, most importantly did not take account of the 
likelihood of delivery or monitoring and information requirements.  The lack of periodic reviews, in the context 
of recurrent monitoring, disconnected the results framework from the program and discouraged ownership from 
the team.  A results framework must, to the extent possible, allow the tracking of progress in program delivery, 
and eventually evaluation.  Initially, the results framework must be grounded on those elements of the program 
that are mature and likely to be delivered.  The results framework can be updated periodically to reflect the 
evolution of the program.  Updating is most relevant when strategies cover a longer period of time, which is the 
case of Vietnam.  Lastly, the results approach should be consistent across instruments, and not only be applied 
in the CPS.

Status: Partially Achieved  

Justification for Status: 
the achievements 
include 
continued equitization, enactment of the Enterprise Law, 
strengthening of tertiary education institutions and higher 
levels of credit channeled to agriculture. With the number 
of higher education graduates rapidly increasing, the 
focus of the Bank program has been on improving the 
quality of 
tertiary education and building on 
the 
achievements and 
lessons 
learned from completed 
operations. 

However, 
the privatization of 
large 
state-owned 
enterprises is behind schedule, Vietnam is not yet fully 
recognized as a market economy and a comprehensive 
competitiveness agenda has yet to be fully articulated.

Support for strengthening the business environment 
was highly relevant, particularly in the post-WTO 
accession world. Reports are that the quality of the 
business environment improved, with a partial 
support from the CPS program. With h indsight, 
accession to WTO contributed to a higher volatility 
of the economy, given the limited capacity of the 
economy to absorb capital inflows. In addition, the 
creation of 
the Large Economic Groups 
to 
strengthen the competitive position of the country is 
in fact creating an uneven playing field between 
public and private actors. These events emerged 
after the design of the CPS, and the PRSC series 
has taken the issues on board, albeit only towards 
the end of the CPS period. These events show the 
need for a partnership strategy to be flexible enough 
to react promptly to emerging circumstances that 
may 
impair 
the sustainability of 
the macro-
economic environment, the quality of the business 
environment and the CPS program itself.  

The state remains a dominant player in finance, as 
the owner of five large financial groups; two of 
which have been equitized, but none of which have 
strategic international partners. The link between 
the public banks and the large economic groups has 
heightened concerns, given that the international 
crisis has evidenced cracks in the balance sheets of 
some of the large economic groups, the extent of 
which has yet to be fully determined and disclosed. 
Therefore efforts to tighten the governance of large 
economic groups would increase the stability of the 
financial sector

good implementation progress.  Results achieved 
against 
institutional development performance 
indicators have been extremely positive. 
 A 
significant portion of 
the 
technical assistance 
included in the project design has been delivered to 
good effect.  Importantly, a comprehensive analysis 
and reengineering of business processes based on 
the implementation of globally agreed standards has 
been completed and draft bidding documents for the 
procurement of the VCIS prepared.  Initial progress 
in operational modernization was strengthened by a 
completed legal assessment and project activities 
focused on organizational 
restructuring and 
strengthening.  The preparation of a comprehensive 
training strategy was completed and is being used 
already.  

However, around the time of the Mid Term Review 
key counterparts became concerned about the 
possibility 
that procurement 
could not be  
completed and achieve full implementation process 
for the VCIS within an allowable extension of the 
closing date and began exploring alternative options 
that could accelerate VCIS implementation and 
increase long term sustainability. 
 The GDVC 
informally advised that it was considering a number 
of options including the possibility of directly 
acquiring a suitable operational VCIS from a 
neighboring country as part of a possible bilateral 
cooperation arrangement.  The Mid-Term Review 
mission advised 
the GDVC 
that 
the Bank‟s 
procurement rules would not allow the IDA credit 
to be used to support direct contracting of a major 
IT system such as the VCIS.  The mission also 
stressed that experience elsewhere suggested such 
an approach might take considerable time to 
finalize and could incur a number of other risks that 
might 
ultimately 
delay 
implementation 
significantly. Given the above context, and based 
on a review of various project restructuring options 
with key counterparts, the Mid-Term Review 
mission recommended that counterparts consider 
either continuing implementation through extending 
the project by another 3-5 years to ensure sufficient 
time 
for 
full and effective deployment or 
terminating the project as implemented to date.  On

1.2. Financial system more

stable 
and 
responsive to the needs of 
business and households  

Status: Partially Achieved  

Justification for Status: 
Key achievements 
include passage of fundamental 
legislation on the Central Bank and credit institutions, 
partial 
equitization of 
state owned banks 
and 
modernization of the banking payments infrastructure. 
Financial deepening has also improved with fast growth 
in credit over the past few years. However, the laws were 
approved with a delay and hence some of the follow-up 
actions could not be undertaken within the CPS period. 
Also there is concern about the health of the banking 
system given the very rapid credit growth equality of data

behalf of the Borrower, notified the Bank of its 
intention to terminate the project and the remaining 
credit was cancelled. The termination occurred 
before the due credit closing date thus allowing the 
cancelled funds to revert to the Vietnam IDA 
program. 

Among number of lessons learned (to be discussed 
in more detail in the ICR) is the need for additional 
attention 
to project ownership and 
leadership 
performance by the beneficiary, and the overly 
optimistic disbursement schedule developed during 
project approval. The initial 5-year implementation 
plan with relatively linear disbursement schedule 
clearly proved to be overly optimistic, given the 
borrowers limited experience, the need for a two 
stage procurement process and 
the need 
to 
undertake complex business process reengineering 
prior to developing detailed bidding documents for 
the major ICT procurement.  These problems could 
have been 
identified sooner and preventive 
measures taken including increased supervision 
frequency and intensity and the timing of the 
delayed Mid-Term Review being conducted closer 
to the initial schedule. Some project management 
pro-activeness was, however, constrained by lack of 
adequate budget to manage such a high risk project. 
 Increased attention to the cumulative impact of 
procurement delays may have allowed the project to 
be identified and included in the problem portfolio 
earlier and therefore drawn additional management 
attention to the status of the project. 

The pace of implementation of the strategy has 
been slow, showing that the CPS seems to have 
overestimated the progress that could have been 
made. A similar observation was made regarding 
the previous CPS. The recommendation is to 
develop more realistic expectations of what can be 
accomplished during the CPS period and to focus 
attention on a few key priorities.

Note: There is no reliable statistics regarding the share of

Infrastructure Financing 
in Vietnam produced 
in 
December 2008 noted that there is limited private sector 
participation in infrastructure and Vietnam has yet to 
establish a comprehensive institutional framework that

1.3. More Efficient and 
Reliable 
Provision 
of 
Infrastructure Services  

Status: Achieved  

Justification for Status: Major progress has been made 
in the institutional transformation of the energy sector, 
while at the same time increasing capacity and financial 
sustainability. The agenda on transport has supported 
building the basic core network in the country and is on 
track; although more work is needed in terms of solid 
logistics. Availability of water in urban areas has 
increased, with over 90 percent coverage in large urban 
centers. 
 Although infrastructure has kept up with 
demand, it remains a major constraint to con tinued 
economic growth, and the participation of the private 
sector in construction, management and finance was 
below the original expectations set under the CPS.

The institutional breakthrough in the energy sector 
was followed by a sector specific DPO to firm up 
the achievements. The dialogue around the PRSC 
provided the entry point. The lesson would seem to 
be that the DPL follows rather than leads policy 
reform. Hence the relevance of up-fronting policy 
dialogue supported by quality AAA in those areas 
that constrain growth and quality of life outcomes.  

Considerable attention has been given to urban 
development through a wide range of operations on 
water, sanitation, transport and environment; an 
emerging trend upon which to build greater synergy 
across urban interventions is seeking to improve the 
strategic and management capacity of urban centers 
(e.g. Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project and Danang 
Priority Infrastructure Investment Project).

insufficient investment and delay in land clearance and

to 
investment shortage and construction delay (EVN

 EVN‟s financial performance has improved compared 
during 
the CPS period but 
is still somewhat 
unsatisfactory. The company still makes net losses, 
although significantly less than a few years ago. The 
GoV has recently updated and increased electricity 
tariff every year as required in PM Decision 21 (2009), 
however generation costs also increased significantly

supported and that has facilitated access to health 
insurance now estimated to cover 62 percent of the 
population (above the 55 percent target). However, 
missing data on key health indicators and health insurance 
coverage makes it difficult to conclude with certainty 
whether the outcome has been fully achieved. The road

 Effective criteria for poverty targeting, 
both for men and women, under new 
Program 135 agreed by 2008 

 Criteria for budget allocation were set up at every 
P135-2 province guiding allocation to be more pro-
poor. Output was fully achieved. 

 Effective and comprehensive M&E system 
for Program 135 in place. 

Control over public expenditure resources 
decentralized to communes 

 100% of Zone 3 communes and poorest 
villages in Zone 2 communes act as 
investment owners in Program 135 – 
Phase 2:  
Baseline (2005): 15% 
Target (2010): 100% 

Increase in forestland allocated to ethnic 
minorities 

 Share of ethnic minority households to 
which forest land allocated: 
Baseline (2004):  38.5% 
Target (2011) :  75% 

 M&E system for P135-2 was designed and installed, 
streamlining underway. P135-2 was the first national 
program that has an M&E system in place though not 
all provinces have been able to run it due to technical 
issues. Thus, this output was partially achieved

While 
the program has 
indeed 
focused on 
improving policies and infrastructure to address the 
needs of urban poor and thereby indirectly migrants 
in urban areas, the program has not tracked possible 
improvements in access to services specifically for 
migrants. Thus, for purposes of results measuring, it 
would have been advisable to not include migrants 
specifically in the outcome. However, the focus of 
this outcome area on urban poor reflects the current 
priorities of the government well and might be an 
area which the government would like to see scaled 
up in the next CPS period.

PILLAR III: MORE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, AND REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL 
DEGRADATION 
3.1. Better sustaining and 
managing natural resources  

Status: Partially achieved  

Justification for Status: There has been significant 
progress under the Land Administration Project, which 
has made it easier for people to access land titles. There 
has furthermore been improvement in terms of combining 
forest protection with sustained livelihood and poverty 
reduction; less progress however has been seen in relation 
to the protection of critical natural habitats.  Also there are 
concerns about the transparency in the allocation of land 
titles.

households and local business is slow and lacks

allocated to households increased from 27% in 2006 
to 28-29% in 2008 (23,000 ha under FSDP for the 
plantation of 22788 ha of forest as of Dec 2008). 
However, 
this percentage remains very 
low 
in   
Central Highlands, i.e. 2.5% and 3%.  

 31 provincial land registration offices established, 
equivalent to 49% of all provinces. However, the 
development of a database and the purchase of 
equipment have not yet been concluded. No District 
Land Registration Offices are operational, but are 
pending the users‟ service training and „down and up‟ 
links. 196 commune 
level access points are 
operational, equipped with computers and other office 
equipment, but without up-link and staff training 
(2011)  

 It is estimated the percentage doubled in 2008 from 
16% in 2004 (15% for agricultural land and 18% for 
resident 
land). However, 
the 
indicator was not 
included in the 2010 VHLSS and therefore no new 
data is available 

 The 
number 
of River Basin Management 
Organizations increased from 3 in 2006 to 4 at present. 
However, as was the case at time of the Progress 
Report, in general they still operate ineffectively if at 
all.

Justification for Status: The CPS program has made 
good progress on the legal and regulatory framework and 
cost recovery in the area of household sanitation as well 
as some progress on increasing the coverage rates, 
considering the low base from which the work started.   In 
addition, analytical work on industrial pollution was

treatment and solid waste collection 
services increased 

indicators were not met in this area and less than 30 
percent of the wastewater from industrial parks is treated 
in centralized facilities. Progress toward a lower-intensity 
carbon economy was made through investments in energy 
demand 
side management and 
renewable energy 
development. In renewable energy, targets were surpassed 
for several indicators.  

Details on progress made under each outcome 
indicator: 

 Less than 10% of urban wastewater flows subject to at 
least primary treatment (2011) 

 In general the solid waste tariffs are in better shape 
with the cost recovery around 60-80%. For the waste 
water sector, it is necessary to distinguish between the 
environmental protection charge (up to 10% of water 
bill, defined by Decree 67, not fully applied) and the 
waste water fee (based on a full cost recovery 
approach as defined in Decree 88, applied in some 
cities with as-built waste water facilities). It is noted 
that the cost recovery in waste water is less than 10%

 By the end of 2009, the T&D losses stood at 9.6%. 
However, 
in 2010, power T&D 
losses slightly 
increased to 10.25% against the target of 10% . Some 
distribution corporations did not meet the targets 
because they are taking over low voltage distribution 
networks from poor performing local distribution units. 
(EVN statistics, 2011) 

 About 400 MW increment of renewable energy 
contributing to grid from 2005 to 2010, exceeding the 
target. During 2009-2010 only, 250 MW of grid 
connected renewable energy generation was added to 
the system during 2009-2010 and 400 MW are under 
construction. (EVN and MOIT statistics, 2011)

Status: Partially Achieved  

Justification for Status: This outcome was only 
introduced at the time of the Progress Report in late 2009 
and therefore there has been limited time to achieve the 
goals. The progress in terms of sectoral and provincial 
climate change adaptation strategies is uneven. Studies on 
climate change have been completed and the Bank has 
supported the development of a first draft of a government 
strategy on Climate Change at the very end of the CPS 
period. The Government has developed a National Target 
Program to address climate change concerns. The Bank 
has also scaled up engagement in climate change 
(including the development of a climate change strategy) 
and is preparing a DLP series with the first operation 
planned for early FY12. Progress has furthermore been 
made in energy (including in alternative energy and loss 
reductions).

Details on progress made under each outcome 
indicator: 

 Government capacity has improved but only some 
sectors and provinces have developed climate change 
adaptation 
strategies. The Bank 
supported 
the 
development of the first draft of a national climate 
change strategy at the very end of the CPS period. 
However, the Government is still slow to take action in 
various key policy areas. This will be addressed under 
forthcoming World Bank Climate Change DPO. 

 Analyses on the economic costs of adaptation were 
undertaken in a number of sectors, with Bank support, 
and were completed by 2011

4.1 Improved effectiveness 
of

Justification 
for Status: The Public Financial

anticipated key outcomes, but with a 
lag despite 
considerable supporting technical assistance. From a long-
term perspective implementation of the PFM agenda has 
made substantive progress.

The progress of the PFM reform agenda has been 
positive but the pace extremely gradual so that even 
though the bulk of the goals on the PFM agenda is 
expected to be met over the long-haul, some of the 
narrower goals set under the CPS will be not be met 
until on during the next CPS. The progress expected 
within the coming period can hopefully help 
advance the use-of-country-systems agenda, where 
progress has been 
limited. Support 
for 
the 
implementation of the anti-corruption agenda has 
been weaker, limited to tracking actions under the 
PRSC. Elements to access their impact are not 
available. The 201o Moderns Institutions VDR took 
a long view of the institutional development and 
identified weak points providing an effective 
platform for dialogue in the country on institutions 
and governance issues.

Status And Evaluation Summary 

Lending and non-lending Activities  that 
contributed to the outcome 

Lessons and suggestions for the new CPS 

Vietnam has fielded and is implementing a very 
ambitious decentralization strategy. The CPS could 
have supported these efforts more as part of a 
strategy to modernize planning, given the role of 
the local authorities in delivering outcomes.  

 e-Procurement Bulletin established and well known in 
the industry, with mandatory posting of procurement 
plans, bidding opportunities and contract award 
information. e-Procurement Bulletin had been updated 
to the daily Public Procurement Review Newspaper 
available both online and in hard copies. 

 Business-related e-services have become operational at 
varying degree in some ministries (Ministry of Industry 
and Trade, MOF, etc) and localities (HCMC, Danang, 
Haiphong, etc) and are being piloted 
in other 
ministries/provinces.  MPI/PPA has been piloting a 
national e-Tendering system with the participation of 
several large domestic corporations (e.g. VNPT, EVN, 
etc) 

Status: Partially achieved  

Justification for Status: It is assessed that this status is 
partially achieved based on the delivery of P-135 where 
local participation is a key element and partial progress on 
the Hanoi Core Statement. As one of the first countries to 
localize the Paris Declaration, Vietnam showed great will 
to modernize planning and aid effectiveness. There has 
been progress in improving aid effectiveness since 2005, 
but some development partners had expected more 
results. Remaining challenges include the lack of capacity 
for strategic policy making and planning at sub-national 
level and a lack of clarity on what exactly is needed to 
change current aid practices.

4.3. Reduced incidence of 
corruption in key services  

Status: Partially Achieved  

Justification 
for Status: Given 
the presence of 
administrative corruption, the work on tax and customs 
procedures simplification has been highly relevant. 
However, the Customs Project has been cancelled because 
of severe complications (See Lessons learned under 
Outcome 1.1) Progress has been made in highlighting the 
relevance of external control, and targets were reached in 
terms of asset declarations for individuals and firms. 
However, progress on 
transparency of government 
financial information and auditing has been limited. The 
PCI indicators on bribe paying among firms show some 
signs of improvement, but methodology and indicators 

87 

While this outcome area is extremely important for 
the country to address, it is a rather difficult one to 
measure progress in as well as to attribute the 
Bank‟s contribution. It 
is worth 
taking 
into 
consideration when designing the results framework 
for the coming CPS. It is furthermore recommended 
that the next CPS will not limit the concept of 
governance to PFM, financial transparency and 
unofficial payments in tax and customs. Rather, the 
definition of governance should be broadened to 
include 
transparency, 
accountability 
and 
information and be treated as truly cross-cutting 
rather than having a separate section in the results 
framework.

90 percent continue to lower secondary education, (no 
significant differences between regions or between urban 
and rural areas. 

Progress 
Girls now represent 48.2 percent of students enrolled at 
primary level, 48.1 percent at lower secondary level, and 
49.1 percent at upper secondary level. 
Progress 
Reduced by 58 percent between 1990 and 2009 (down 
from 58 to 24.4 per 1000). The infant mortality rate was 
reduced from 44.4 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 16 in 
2009.

Halt and begin to reverse the incidence 
of malaria and other major diseases by 
2015 

Progress 
Despite progress in some areas and great efforts by the 
Government to address HIV over the past ten years, the 
HIV prevalence rate continues to increase. The HIV 
prevalence rate is estimated at 0.28  percent for all age 
groups in 2010.  
Impressive progress on prevention and control of malaria 
shows that Viet Nam has already achieved the MDG 
target on malaria control. Viet Nam is also acknowledged 
to have done a good job in controlling other epidemics 
such as SARS, H5N1 and H1N1. 
Progress 
Viet Nam has shown strong commitment to environmental 
concerns at the international and policy level, and 
significant achievements have been made in relation to 
MDG 7. For example, forest coverage has increased from 
27.8 percent in 1990 to about 40 percent in 2010. 
Today, about 83 percent of the rural population has access 
to safe water, up from 30 percent in 1990. On sanitation, 
less progress - overall poor conditions and lack of 
hygiene. For 
instance, only 18 
 percent of rural 
households, 12  percent of rural schools and 37  percent of 
commune health stations have hygienic latrines which 
meet the Ministry of Health standards

ANNEX 9: GENDER IN VIETNAM 

As noted in chapter I, Vietnam has made substantial progress on gender equality. Health 
outcomes have improved dramatically. Infant mortality dropped from 44 percent in 1990 to only 16 
percent in 2009, with no differences between boy and girl infants. The decrease in maternal mortality is 
equally impressive, falling from 233 to 69 deaths per 100,000 live births from 1990 to 2009.  Similar 
success has been achieved in school enrolment, where the gender gap has been eliminated, and has 
actually reversed slightly for tertiary education.  There are still gaps in employment and wages, but they 
have lessened, and overall no difference exists in male and female poverty rates.  Compared to other 
countries in the region, Vietnam has a high rate of women in the National Assembly of about 27 percent. 

Nevertheless, important challenges related to gender remain across sectors.  These 
challenges – in the areas of health, education, employment, and participation – are in some cases more 
subtle but that does not mean they are not profound.  Moreover, they cannot be addressed simply by 
relying upon a continuation of Vietnam‟s recent impressive economic growth. 

These challenges include: 

 Poverty - Older women, especially in rural areas, are overrepresented among the poor.  The major 
gender difference in regards to poverty has to do with widows, who are both poorer and more 
numerous than widowers.  This points to one key difference between men and women, namely power 
over assets.  For example, even though a 2003 Land Law began a successful effort to include women 
on LTCs, as of 2008 the majority of LTCs still do not include the woman‟s name.  And while women 
do have avenues for obtaining credit, access to larger funds often requires the kind of collateral that 
LTCs can provide. 

 Education - Gender education gaps still exists among certain ethnic minority groups, and among the 
majority Kinh population there is actually a small reverse gender gap. Also, there is a significant 
degree of segregation of men and women in their fields of study, which is connected to significant 
segregation in terms of occupation and industry of employment, as well.  Another concern is that 
educational materials still promote gender stereotypes.   

 Health - Women still have less health insurance coverage than men, and they also continue to be 
victims of gender based violence.  Over 30 percent have experienced physical abuse, and over 50 
percent emotional abuse. Another major concern is the rise in sex ratio at birth (SRB) from 106 male 
births for every 100 female births in 1999 (the approximate biological norm) to 111 in 2006. SRBs 
are highest for higher income groups with better access to sonograms and sex selected abortions.  For 
higher parity births among the richest quintile, the SRB is 133.1.  So this situation -- which is 
associated with increased trafficking and violence -- might worsen with economic development.  In 
terms of men‟s health, males have much higher rates of HIV and AIDS, smoking, and drinking. 

 Employment - Women‟s wages are now about 75 percent of men‟s according to the 2009 Labor 
Force Survey, and women are still highly segregated by both industry and occupation. Women are 
also in more vulnerable jobs, for example, own-account work and unpaid family labor.  In fact, during 
the recent economic crisis, women disproportionately left wage employment for more vulnerable 
jobs. Women also receive less vocational training, and undertake a disproportionate amount of unpaid 
work, which is seen as a barrier not only to employment, but also to civic participation.    

 Lower wages, a bigger gender wage gap, and far worse working conditions prevail in small informal 
family-run enterprises and among casual labor.  Particularly disadvantaged are migrant women, 
widows, older women, ethnic minorities, and women with disabilities. Many of these women are 
landless or lost their land to industrial parks and urbanization. These are the women who are least 

111 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
able to access the opportunities generated by Vietnam‟s integration into the informal economy.  Many 
are also unable to take advantage of targeted training or employment schemes intended for the poor.  

 Participation –There are still signs that women do not have an equal voice in the public sphere – for 
example, low rates of representation in party committees.  But, women‟s ability to participate in 
public decision-making processes goes beyond the formal political and policy domain.  The 
Grassroots Democracy Decree (Decree 79) was intended to provide a framework to promote 
democratic participation at the local level and to emphasize decentralizing decision-making within 
development programs to achieve a closer fit between needs and design.   In fact, involving women in 
development projects and programs has provided a widely used route to increasing their participation 
in public life.  Still, participatory poverty monitoring points out that many of the barriers that women 
face higher up in the public sector are also encountered at the grassroots level.   

Even with all these challenges, it is important to acknowledge Vietnam’s efforts in regards 
to gender equality. Vietnam has recently enacted laws on gender equality and against domestic violence, 
and this year adopted a national strategy on gender equality.  The successes in the areas of health, 
education, employment, and participation are significant, and should be used as a platform to expand 
gender equality even further by addressing the more complicated issues that remain.   

Vietnam’s transition to a middle income country would be assisted by a flexible and trained 
citizenry that could contribute to the economy and civic life of the nation in the most efficient way 
possible.  To that end, the World Bank plans to: 

- Support the Government of Vietnam in improving the implementation of the Law on 
Gender Equality and the National Strategy on Gender Equality in part by building gender 
awareness and capacity within relevant ministries, by devoting appropriate resources, and by 
working to build systems of accountability. 

- Support the development of a gender data system by building on the recent development of 
the National Gender Statistical Indicator System. 

- Apply a gender lens to Bank projects to take advantage of opportunities to improve project 
design and implementation by incorporating the voices, talents, and concerns of both women and 
men. 

- Close the knowledge gap through quantitative and qualitative data on gender issues.  This 
includes research on cultures and norm and assessing the value of unpaid work in the home.

ANNEX 14: VIETNAM COUNTRY SURVEY 
(May-June 2010) 

Methodology 

In May-June 2010, 725 stakeholders of the World Bank in Vietnam were invited to provide 
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey, the first 
one in Vietnam since FY06.  A total of 335 stakeholders participated in the survey (a 46 percent 
response rate).  The majority of respondents (71 percent) were from Hanoi.  More than half (56 percent) 
were from government.  Other respondents were more fragmented:  academia (10 percent), bilateral or 
multilateral agencies (8 percent), NGOs (6 percent), media (6 percent), private sector (2 percent), and 
National Assembly Delegates (1 percent). 

The survey used a mail-in questionnaire in which respondents were asked to indicate their 
overall attitudes toward the Bank, the importance of specific areas of the Bank’s work, and the 
Bank’s effectiveness in those areas.  They were also asked to indicate their level of agreement with a 
series of statements about the way the World Bank does business.  Respondents were also asked about 
general issues facing Vietnam, the Bank‟s future role, and the Bank‟s communication and outreach.  The 
questionnaire was broken into seven sections:   

1. Background Information:  The first section asked respondents for their current position, 
specialization, familiarity, and geographic location. 

2. General Issues facing Vietnam:  Respondents were asked to indicate what they thought were the 
most important development priorities and to rate their optimism for the next generation in 
Vietnam. 

3. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank:  Respondents were asked to rate the Bank‟s overall 
effectiveness, their agreement with various statements regarding the Bank‟s programs, poverty 
mission, relationships, and collaborations in Vietnam. Respondents were also asked to indicate 
what they felt were the Bank‟s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work and with 
which groups the Bank should work more.   

4. The Work of the World Bank:  Respondents were asked to rate their level of importance and the 
Bank‟s level of effectiveness across seventeen areas in which the Bank was involved, such as 
helping to reduce poverty and helping to bring about economic growth.  

5. The Way the World Bank does Business:  Respondents were asked to rate the Bank‟s level of 
effectiveness in the way it does business, including the Bank‟s knowledge, personal relationships, 
collaborations, and poverty mission. 

6. Communication and Outreach:  Respondents were asked to indicate where they get information 
about development issues in Vietnam. 

7. The Future of the World Bank in Vietnam:  Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which 
the Bank will play a significant role in Vietnam‟s development and to indicate what the Bank 
could do to make itself of greater value in Vietnam.

Findings 

(i) 

Priorities for Vietnam and Bank Support 

Respondents indicated that governance was the most important development priority for 
Vietnam.  It was rated as the most or second most important priority for Vietnam by 47 percent of 
respondents, a significantly larger share than for other priorities.  Those with the highest ratings after 
governance were economic growth (27 percent), infrastructure (21 percent), reducing corruption (17 
percent), and improving the effectiveness of the law and justice system (also 17 percent).   

As for priorities for Bank support in Vietnam, respondents gave the highest mean rating to 
helping reduce poverty (8.4 on a 10-point scale with 1 being not at all and 10 being very important).  
This was followed by encouraging greater transparency in governance (8.1), ensuring that attention is 
paid to the environmental impact of Bank supported programs and strategies (8.1), helping to strengthen 
infrastructure development (8.1), helping to lay the foundation to integrate Vietnam into the global 
economy (8.0), help Vietnam adapt to/avert risk of climate change (8.0), helping to bring about economic 
growth (8.0), and safeguarding against corruption in Bank-funded projects with its procurement rules 
(7.9). 

The survey data indicate a gap between the relative perceived importance of development 
priorities for Vietnam and priorities for Bank support in Vietnam in three areas:  poverty 
reduction, economic growth, and climate change.  Poverty reduction is rated the most important out of 
17 areas for the Bank to be involved in, but seventh out of 20 in its importance for Vietnam.  Economic 
growth is the reverse:  fifth out of 17 areas for the Bank to be involved in, but second among 20 areas 
important for Vietnam.  One could infer from this that respondents know the Bank's mission is poverty 
reduction, and while they feel economic growth will continue to reduce poverty in Vietnam, and/or keep 
it from reversing its downward trend, they look to the Bank to help address the needs of the long-term 
poor who are less able to access the benefits of growth.  Climate change is ranked fourth in importance 
out of 17 areas for the Bank to be involved in, but eleventh out of 20 in its importance for Vietnam.  A 
possible interpretation is that climate change is considered a longer term issue that Government cannot 
tackle on its own, and the donor community, including the Bank, should therefore take the lead.   

(ii) 

The Bank’s Effectiveness 

Across all respondents, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Vietnam received a mean rating 
of 7.7 (the same as in the FY06 survey), with 1 being very unfavorable and 10 being very favorable.  
Respondents from government, academia, media, other organizations, and NGOs had significantly higher 
ratings for the Bank‟s overall effectiveness in Vietnam than respondents from bilateral or multilateral 
agencies and private sector.  Respondents saw the Bank as most effective in helping to reduce poverty, 
integrate Vietnam into the global economy, strengthening infrastructure development, and paying 
attention to the environmental impact of Bank programs, with all of these areas receiving mean ratings of 
7.4 on the 10-point scale.   

Interestingly, respondents rated the Bank’s effectiveness in a given area on average below 
the area’s importance, which indicates the Bank needs to enhance even further its impact in 
priority areas.  These "effectiveness gaps" are widest for the following work areas of the Bank, in 
descending order (i.e., the first work area in the list has the widest gap): 

 helping to strengthen the education sector 
 helping to strengthen the health sector 
 
encouraging greater transparency in governance 

121 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 helping to strengthen the private sector 
 helping Vietnam adapt to/avert risk of climate change 
 
safeguarding against corruption in projects/programs that the Bank funds with its procurement 
rules 
 helping to strengthen the regulatory framework 
 helping to reduce poverty 

(iii) 

The Bank’s Value Added 

Respondents indicated that the Bank’s greatest value to Vietnam was its financial resources 
(56 percent ranked this the Bank’s greatest or second greatest value), followed by knowledge (45 
percent), implementation capacity (34 percent), and technical advice (31 percent).  But if one 
considers the Bank‟s knowledge (studies and analyses), technical advice, and ability to build 
implementation capacity as various aspects of the “Knowledge Bank,” then their combined scores 
significantly exceed that of financial resources as the Bank‟s greatest added value, and in fact exceed 50 
percent.  And if votes for greatest and second greatest value are combined, the “Knowledge Bank" 
received nearly twice as many votes as financial resources.   

This indicates it will be very important that the Bank bring cutt ing edge skills and provide 
global knowledge to its engagement in Vietnam.  The competitiveness of the Bank‟s financing terms 
will no doubt also be important, especially as IBRD accounts for a growing share of Vietnam's new 
commitments and as IDA 16 terms become less favorable for blend countries. 

(iv) 

The Bank’s Weaknesses and Collaboration with Stakeholders 

Areas deemed to be the Bank's greatest weaknesses all had to do with inflexibility.  Listed in 
descending order of respondents‟ votes, these weaknesses are:  imposing technocratic solutions without 
regard to political realities, not exploring alternative policy options, failing to adapt global knowledge to 
local conditions, and being too bureaucratic in its operational policies and procedures were also 
considered to be weaknesses of the Bank.   

Over half of all respondents indicated that the Bank should work more with others in 
Vietnam, in addition to partnership with the national government.  Specifically, the Bank should 
work more with beneficiaries (59 percent of respondents), the donor community (40 percent), the private 
sector (35 percent), NGOs (23 percent), and the National Assembly (22 percent).

ANNEX 15: STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS 

Stakeholder consultations on the CPS FY12-FY16 are being held at three stages aligned 
with key milestones in CPS preparation:  before drafting, at the Concept stage and at the 
Corporate Review stage.  The consultations have been aimed at:  (i) enhancing broad ownership of the 
CPS; (ii) engaging with stakeholders in line with the principles of the Paris Declaration and Hanoi Core 
Statement; and (iii) benefiting from the insights of a broad group of stakeholders with knowledge and 
understanding of the country context.  The consultation process for the CPS FY12-FY16 started with a 
round of consultations before the drafting process was initiated.  The main participants have been the 
Government, where participants are from central government (Government‟s Core CPS Team with 
members from SBV, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Office of Government (OOG), and MPI, line 
ministries and other counterpart agencies), local government, and the National Assembly; civil society, 
where participants include international NGOs/local NGOs and CSOs, academia, ethnic minority groups, 
disability groups, women‟s groups, media, international and local private sector; and Development 
Partners, including multilateral and bilateral donors. 

Consultation Round 1:  Visioning Workshop, January 2011 

A CPS visioning consultation workshop was held with stakeholders in January 2011 .  The 
workshop was designed to engage the diverse group of stakeholders in discussions of key priority areas 
for the World Bank in a proactive and interactive manner. Participants identified and discussed what they 
thought the Bank‟s five key priority areas should be during the next five years and their rationale: 

 Macro-economic Development:  Many participants mentioned the important role of the Bank in 
supporting the Government‟s efforts to secure macroeconomic stability. The Bank is seen as an 
important advisor and provider of independent analytical research and forecasts (conducted when 
possible in cooperation with relevant research institutions).  Particular issues for the Bank to focus on 
included advice on a new economic model, reform of the SOE sector, and re-organizing the economic 
information/data system.  

 Infrastructure:  Practically all participants agreed that infrastructure development should remain a top 
priority for the Bank. Within the area of infrastructure, focus was mostly on transport (urban transport, 
rural roads, and expressways were mentioned), but energy was also highlighted as very important.  

 Strengthening Human Resources: As a new middle income country, Vietnam is in need of human 
resources of high quality to intensify the socio-economic development efforts.  Three areas were 
specifically highlighted as important for the Bank to support in relation to human resources: higher 
education,  vocational training and capacity building 

 Climate change and natural disaster prevention The Bank can provide relevant international 
experience and lessons and help Vietnam with the development of strategies and actions for prevention 
of and dealing with natural disasters as well as approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation. 

 Governance and Anti-Corruption:  Practically all non-governmental participants saw governance and 
anti-corruption as a crucial area for the Bank to support. Corruption is seen as a major impediment to 
development. Government participants did not mention the issue of corruption, but several did 
nevertheless underline the need for a strengthening of institutions and the importance of the World 
Bank supporting the Government in this area.  

The Bank sought feedback on its perceived areas of comparative advantage . Some of the 
areas mentioned were: (i) the level of resources the Bank brings to the table – e.g., for financing large 
scale infrastructure, (ii) its global and regional perspective, (iii) its close and productive relationship with 

123 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Government, and (iv) its ability to take a leading role in donor coordination due to its staff size, broad 
engagement across many sectors, and close relationship with the Government.  

Participants also discussed and exchanged ideas on what areas the Bank should approach 
differently in the future:  

 Sustainability and quality of growth:  With the new MIC status, both the Government and the Bank 
will need to focus more on building increased sustainability and increasing the quality of growth.  

 Country ownership/systems and financing modalities:  A number of government participants felt the 
Bank should promote more country ownership by moving towards the use of country systems, 
especially on procurement, as the slow rate of disbursement of Bank projects is seen as the greatest 
source of frustration in relation to their cooperation with the World Bank. Interestingly though, several 
of the non-government participants encouraged the World Bank to promote a more efficient and 
transparent use of public resources and cautioned the Bank against relying too much on country 
systems.  

 Improvement of Program Management Capacity and Aid Effectiveness: With other donors slowly 
phasing out, many participants found that the Bank should play a more active role both in supporting 
improvement of program management capacity on the Government side and in taking forward the aid 
effectiveness and donor coordination agenda.  

 More independence in policy advice:  While the close relationship between the World Bank and the 
Government of Vietnam was mentioned as one of the Bank‟s comparative advantages, some 
participants also felt that the new development context of Vietnam requires the Bank to adopt a more 
independent voice with the Government in policy advice, debate and research.  

The workshop demonstrated quite different perspectives between government, donor, and 
non-government participants. While in general Government emphasizes the importance of the Bank as 
a source of infrastructure financing, other groups look to the Bank as a development institution.  Within 
Government, different agencies also expressed different needs - some ministries put heavy emphasis on 
large infrastructure while other agencies would like to see more DPOs/budget support.  Nearly all non-
Government representatives emphasized the 'knowledge' bank aspects and the importance of the bank as a 
critical, independent reviewer and adviser on economic and other policies.  While some (mostly 
Government) emphasized the need for more infrastructure, others (non-government) emphasized issues 
with the quality and maintenance of infrastructure and how it is prioritized and financed.  All agreed on 
the importance of improving human capital, but there was a difference in views as to whether emphasis 
should be put on higher education vs. vocational training.  With respect to higher education, the 
importance of governance and accountability issues rather than bricks and mortar was emphasized by 
some.  Several non-government representatives noted that the efficiency of the state sector is a major 
challenge although the appropriate role for the World Bank in supporting this is less clear.  Some non -
government participants noted that the current Bank portfolio was perhaps spread out a bit too thinly.

Consultation Round 2:  Three Sessions on CPS Concept Paper, June 2011  

On June 6th, 2011, The World Bank hosted three separate rounds of consultations with the WBG‟s most 
important stakeholders in Vietnam on the CPS Concept Paper43 and its proposed strategic directions.  
Below are the main points from each session. 

Government of Vietnam 

SEDP and SEDS 
 The connection to the SEDP and SEDS was not as visible in the CPS Concept Note as the government 
would like to see, and they hoped to see further alignment with the Plan and Strategy moving forward. 
It was, however, appreciated that all three break-through areas of the SEDP and SEDS (infrastructure, 
human resources/skills development, and improving market institutions) were reflected clearly in the 
CPS – mainly through the first pillar on competitiveness, but this should be noted more clearly in the 
strategy.  

Comparative Advantages and Division of Labor 
 Government (MPI) underlined the importance of the Bank (as well as other donors) clarifying their 
comparative advantages. This will help facilitate division of labor among donors and in relation to the 
Government‟s own programs. Government flagged the need to take a fresh look at aid modalities and 
said they would be interested in how the Bank sees various new options. The new ODA Strategic 
Framework is an important step in terms of coordination, and the importance of ensuring a high level 
of alignment between the two documents was underlined.  

Background Diagnostics  
 It was also noted that it would be useful with more analysis of the regional and global context and 
what this context means for Vietnam. Government also encouraged the Bank to be more frank when 
assessing the weaknesses of government policies and the reasons behind and added that this would be 
the most useful way for Vietnam to learn as the country moves forward.  The area flagged as the most 
important to include was more analysis on the risks for Vietnam in terms of falling into the so-called 
middle income trap and possible tools for Vietnam to avoid it. The World Bank Group‟s global 
experience makes it highly relevant in advising the government on this theme.  

Implications of MIC Status 
 The Vice-Minister raised the questions of whether Vietnam is truly ready to act as a MIC and whether 
the WB is ready to support Vietnam as a MIC and not the Low Income Country it was in the past.  The 
new roles of both Vietnam and the WB were discussed:  roles that demand the Government gradually 
take on a more active leadership and the Bank slowly start to move away from being primarily a 
source of money and to being more valued for its knowledge products, ideas, and policy advice.    

Views on Overall CPS Framework  
 Overall, most government representatives expressed satisfaction with the Concept Note and the 
proposed strategic directions. However, several participants noted that while the objective of 
“enhancing the quality of growth” was capturing an important aspect, it was missing the notion of 
sustainability of growth and that sustainability should not be seen as only pertaining to the 
environment but rather be included in the overall objective. MPI and others noted that the term 

43 One session with Government (including representatives from MPI, OOG, SBV and MOF as well as from line ministries and 
the National Assembly), one session with local civil society (including NGOs, media and the private sector) and one session with 
development partners (including bilateral and multilateral donors and international NGOs).  

125 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
 
“equality of opportunity” was not appropriate and suggested “social inclusion” instead (as was used in 
the previous CPS and SEDP). In addition, it was noted that it is more important to address access to 
basic services in remote areas and for vulnerable groups than to focus on economic inequality.   

 While some participants welcomed the idea of having a pillar that addresses resilience to shocks and 
how to manage risks, others felt it was difficult to understand the idea behind the fourth pillar and that 
it would be better not to separate climate change mitigation and adaptation into two different pillars. 
The same was mentioned for social protection, which some participants preferred to have in just one 
pillar.44  Participants agreed governance and anti-corruption are a very important issue and that having 
it as a cross-cutting theme was a good idea.  

IBRD and IDA 
 Government thought it would be useful to have a road map of the transition from IDA to IBRD and to 
have more firm information about the timeline for decreasing IDA volumes.   

Private and Public  
 Many participants raised the issue of PPPs and what role this will play in Vietnam in the future. This 
was an area where the need for both World Bank and IFC support was highlighted and especially 
transport, energy and health were flagged as possible sectors for PPPs.  As Vietnam moves forward, a 
clearer definition of government‟s role versus that of the private sector will be needed. In relation to 
transport (but relevant for all other sectors as well), it was flagged that the need for resources are huge 
and as both the national budget and aid flows only cover a small portion of those investment needs, it 
is extremely important to improve the efficiency of both public and private investments. 

Project Design and Procedures 
 Several line ministries raised the problems related to WB procedures and difficult project designs. It 
was discussed how to bring down preparation time and whether procedures could be simplified and 
more could be left to the country itself rather than having to be done by Bank staff or expensive 
international consultants. 

Dispersion 
 The session included discussions about whether the WB program is too dispersed and would benefit 
from more selectivity, or whether it is rather an asset for the Bank to be active in all sector s and thus 
that selectivity is not something the WB should strive for at this point. It was underlined that it was 
important to make sure that a greater selectivity would not happen at the expense of promoting social 
inclusion and protection of the most poor and vulnerable groups. It was also mentioned that perhaps it 
would be better to aim at reducing dispersion through a stronger regional focus rather than through 
thematic selectivity.  

 A few participants requested an increased support to National Target Programs and noted that an 
analysis of comparative advantages among donors in relation to the NTPs would be useful. Some 
participants felt it would be more useful to discuss how best to approach the question of division of 
labor rather than focusing on whether the Bank is too dispersed or not.  

44 As a result of the feedback, the Bank team subsequently decided to make resilience a cross-cutting theme rather than a free-
standing pillar. 

126 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
Local Civil Society 

Oversight Mechanism and Bigger Role for Civil Society 
 One of the points that came out strongly was the idea of creating an oversight mechanism for civil 
society to monitor and supervise both government agencies and the private sector to help in the battle 
against inefficient use of public funds, poor service delivery and corruption in both the public and 
private sector. It was also noted that such an oversight mechanism would be extremely impo rtant in 
relation to fighting pollution and natural recourse degradation, and that domestic and international 
enterprises should be monitored to ensure greater environmental sustainability in the future. In general, 
the importance of broadening the participation of civil society to be part of discussions and debates 
about the future path of the country and how to tackle challenges ahead was underlined by many 
participants. The Bank was encouraged to promote a more active role for civil society in the future aid 
architecture (e.g., involving NGOs more in project design, as well as implementation and evaluation). 

Governance and Anti-Corruption 
 Many organizations mentioned the need for strengthening governance issues in both the public and 
private sector. Efficient use of funds, transparency, social accountability and access to information 
were mentioned as important issues. There was general concern about the systemic, inherent nature of 
corruption which was perceived as being widespread at all levels. The World Bank Group was 
encouraged to come out with a stronger position in the CPS on governance and anti -corruption and to 
be more concrete about the Bank‟s plans to address them.  

Environment and Natural Resources 
 Environmental and natural resource degradation was flagged by almost all organizations as one of the 
most serious issues facing Vietnam. While it was appreciated that the CPS Concept Note proposes a 
separate pillar for addressing environmental and natural resource concerns, it was felt that 
international donors could do more to promote this area and should scale up their activities in this 
field.  The focus should be on improving governance in relation to managing natural resources and 
possibly to create a civil society oversight mechanism.  

Bank More Critical 
 It was mentioned that the Government and its achievements are praised a lot in the Concept Paper and 
while it was recognized that this was merited to some extend as well as necessary in some respects, it 
was also underlined that it is increasingly important for the Bank to be more critical of the 
Government in some areas, in the context of an equal and more mature relationship between 
Government and the Bank. 

Views on Overall CPS Framework  
 Most participants agreed that the overall framework suggested - including the four proposed pillars 
and overarching objective - seemed appropriate. It was however noted that the interesting part is how 
the pillars are implemented and what more concretely will be “filled into” each, which has not yet 
been clearly defined at this concept stage. While the Bank was commended for making governance a 
cross-cutting theme, it was not clear enough how the Bank would tackle governance issues.  It was 
also difficult to see which areas are being scaled down, which areas are new for the Bank, and what 
are the Bank‟s comparative advantages.  

Private Sector 
 Several participants highlighted the need for more support on PPPs in various sectors. It was noted that 
the WBG could be clearer in how it envisions addressing the private sector. While some participants 
promoted a more prominent role for the private sector in Vietnam because of its capacity to create 
employment and innovation, others cautioned against focusing blindly on private sector development 

127 

 
 
 
as a solution to everything. The importance of promoting better governance of SOEs was furthermore 
highlighted.  

Development Partners 

Infrastructure 
 It was mentioned that infrastructure is still posing a huge challenge for Vietnam and that the Bank as 
one of the largest donors and providers of credits has an important role to play in supporting the 
government in building proper infrastructure and services. One of the key challenges lies in the 
balance between infrastructure “hardware” and “software” – and while the hardware is important, the 
software such as for example road maintenance, infrastructure sustainability, power sector reform, etc, 
should not be neglected. 

Environment and Natural Resources 
 Many participants stressed the importance of breaking the current trend of extensive exploitation of the 
environment and natural resources and it is necessary to see donors like the Bank move more from talk 
to concrete action.  

Comparative Advantages and Division of Labor 
 Many donors raised the need for the Bank (as well as other donors) to be clearer about their 
comparative advantages and division of labor.  This includes looking into whether donors could join 
efforts in various areas in order to reduce the number of PDOs, PMUs, and have common supervision 
missions.   
 With Vietnam having reached MIC status, some donors are starting to phase out and/or leave the 
country.  Remaining donors will need to take into consideration any possible gaps that arise as a result 
of other donors leaving.  

Views on Overall CPS Framework  
 Most participants found that the proposed overall framework seemed broadly appropriate but that the 
interesting part would be to see how the Bank more concretely shapes the program within the four 
pillars. Several donors mentioned that the terminology used by the WB as well as the visions and 
objectives are closely related to their own, which should hopefully facilitate collaboration.  Several 
donors expressed their appreciation of a pillar dedicated to equal opportunity. One participant raised 
the importance of making sure that poverty reduction is at the core of everything the Bank does and 
therefore an integral part of all four pillars, thus cautioning against limiting poverty reduction to just 
being a subtheme of pillar 3. The related issue of rising inequality was flagged as a very important 
issue to address as well.  Participants welcomed the idea of focusing a pillar on managing risks and 
building resilience, but concerns were raised as to how to ensure that the most poor and vulnerable 
groups are reached under this pillar as well as under pillar 2.  

 Several participants commended the Bank for making governance a cross-cutting theme but noted that 
governance should come out more strongly in the document.  Transparency was mentioned as one of 
the key elements and a concrete entry point to address governance issues. In addition, gender should 
come out more strongly in the strategy, preferably as a cross-cutting theme.  Some of the recent work 
undertaken by the Bank in cooperation with other donors in relation to the Gender Assessment is very 
good and should be shown more directly. 

Civil Society 
 It would be important to include civil society and flag its important role in development in the 
strategy. It was noted that during the current WB Country Director‟s tenure, cooperation with CSOs 
has increased, but the international NGOs would like to see this cooperation deepen further. It was 

128 

 
 
furthermore raised that there should be a mechanism for more direct civil society involvement or 
monitoring in all phases of new operations in order to ensure greater sustainability.  

Policy Dialogue 
 Several donors raised the question of how to strengthen policy dialogue with the government. While 
good progress was made with the PRSC, there is room for further improvement. Donors were looking 
forward to learning more about the Bank‟s plans for the EMCC series of DPOs, to see what strategic 
opportunities it opens for them to engage in specific policy areas together with the Bank.  

Consultation Round 3: Three sessions on Draft CPS, October 2011 

On October 5th and 6th, 2011, the World Bank hosted the last of round CPS consultations. Like with the 
second round, three separate sessions were held with the most important stakeholders – this time on the 
draft CPS that was also shared for the internal WBG Corporate Review. In general, there was broad 
support for the draft CPS and the proposed framework and principles of engagement from all three 
groups. The following is a summary of the points raised:   

Government 

Government Priorities 
 Government underlined the importance of avoiding fragmentation. Support shou ld especially be 
directed towards support for the SEDS/SEDP breakthrough areas and look at a few transformative 
interventions. Infrastructure needs are most pertinent for Vietnam as a MIC, especially transport. The 
WBG should direct a lot of resources to that.   
 Government would like to see an increase in the estimated IDA and IBRD resources, as financing 
needs are large. 
 Government and especially SBV expressed keen interest in getting guidance through analytical work 
and policy advice on how to avoid the so-called middle income trap and would like to see that 
included more in the WB program for the new CPS period. 
 The balance between different instruments was discussed and it was raised that DPOs makes it 
difficult for the Bank to see and assess the direct impact of the money allocated, which is one of the 
advantages of investment loan. 
 The importance of strong donor coordination and division of labor was underlined – especially 
between the three largest donors in Vietnam: ADB, JICA and the WBG. 
 The need for both Government and the WBG to address the bottle necks in human development was 
underlined and new initiatives outlined in the CPS in that area were appreciated. It was questioned 
why the WB does not support vocational training. 
 The WB was commended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) for being 
strong on policy advice, reforms, legal support, etc. and would like specific support in preparing for a 
number of laws/bills coming up in the coming time within MARD‟s areas of responsibility. They 
would furthermore like to see the areas of food security policy and agricultural competitiveness scaled 
up further.  The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) also expressed interest in 
more support on pollution control. 

Framework 
 The pillar framework was seen as well-aligned with both the SEDS and SEDP. 
 MARD underlined the importance that agriculture plays in terms of strengthening the Country‟s 
competitiveness and would like to see it come out stronger in Pillar 1.  

129 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 The General Inspectorate welcomed the emphasis in the CPS on Governance and found that the right 
issues had been raised. However, they requested the WBG to be more specific about what the 
mainstreaming really means in terms of actual actions. 
 MPI was interested in knowing whether all three pillars are seen by the WBG as equally important or 
if one is prioritized over others.  
 MPI suggested that in order to make sure that government agencies have the capacity to address 
governance, reform issues and institutional capacity improvements; it would be useful for the Bank to 
commit an amount of money every year that is earmarked for capacity building and strengthening of 
governance, etc., within Government agencies.  

Development Partners 

Diagnostics 
 It was raised that the first chapter of the draft CPS was missing the political context (and while it was 
recognized that there is a limit as to how much the WBG can go into this, a bit more analysis of the 
political situation would be appreciated). This could focus on the pace of reforms as well as the 
sometimes limited space for dialogue.  The same was raised for the risk section – here the Bank 
suggests more dialogue with Government as the main mitigation measure, but what if that does not 
help?  

Comparative advantages/Division of Labor 
 It was pointed out that more analysis of how the strategy will facilitate the gradual phasing out of other 
donors  would be useful (e.g., in water and sanitation and agricultural/rural development). In addition, 
more TA in PFM would make the phasing out less abrupt/damaging.  
 There were a number of questions and comments about comparative advantages. The Bank was asked 
how it identified its own comparative advantages (as this was also a difficult exercise for other 
donors). There were also questions about whether the WBG has explicit agreements with other 
development partners on division of labor – e.g. in terms of specific sectors and/or geographical areas? 
In relation to this, it was agreed that the WB should meet urgently with both the UN and with ADB 
and JICA to discuss division of labor, and how to avoid overlaps and exploit synergies. 
 On a related note, it was pointed out that it would be interesting with a more explicit discussion 
throughout document and especially under each of the pillars on what the WBG can add in the 
different engagement areas – not just in terms technical support, but also policy advice.  
 It was noted that it is not clear in the document how the WBG sees the role of elected representatives 
of civil society, the National Assembly, etc. 

Principles of Engagement 
 It was pointed out that while the Principles of Engagement of the draft CPS say that the WB will be 
more selective moving forward, it is actually hard to see this selectivity in the description of the 
program 
 In relation to the above point, the Bank was also asked for what criteria it uses to select to engage in 
(or disengage from) a certain sector – of course this would presumably be based on comparative 
advantages, but are there other criteria? For example, the WB was asked whether it uses the progress 
(or lack thereof) on the MDGs as a criteria for engagement/exit?  
 The WB was asked to nuance the statement that it will consolidate and move towards larger projects, 
as it was pointed out that large projects is no guarantee of a more efficient and effective 
implementation.  
 A point was made regarding how to build in incentives and disincentives in project implementation; 
i.e., deliberately moving funds from provinces that do poorly to better performing provinces. It was 
noted that this is already being done to some extent, so the Bank should: a) be more explicit about this 

130 

 
 
 
 
 
 
approach in the document, and b) apply it more consistently and openly in the future and think more 
about how to how to support good performers.  This also links to new results-based approaches. 
 It was noted that the Bank on previous occasions has mentioned that it would aim at having more 
DPOs in the future, yet the draft CPS goes more into describing support for NTPs, Additional 
Financing of existing projects, etc., and does not go much into describing concrete examples of 
possible future DPOs. Thus, the storyline is not clear on where the Bank will do what and why in 
terms of instruments.  

Framework 
 It was noted that it would be interesting with more information about how the WBG will support 
Vietnam in terms of positioning itself in the region, e.g., as part of ASEAN, etc. This is especially 
relevant in relation to the competitiveness pillar but would be useful throughout the document. 
 Outcome 1.1 aims at “Improved Economic Management and Business Environment”. The WBG was 
asked how it will actually make this happen with all the continuing difficulties and lack of progress on 
SOEs and in the financial sector – is this outcome too optimistic?  
 The Bank was requested to make it clearer why resilience is cross-cutting – what does it mean to have 
resilience as a cross-cutting theme, as it is applied in a different way in each pillar. Governance is 
more straight-forward as a cross-cutting theme as it will be applied more uniformly across the pillars  
 The strong focus on governance was welcomed, but it was noted that it was not completely clear how 
the WBG will mainstream governance more concretely - how will it be applied in practice?  
 It was furthermore raised that gender seemed somewhat misplaced under opportunity pillar as it cuts 
across all 3 pillars. 

Implementing the CPS 
 There were a number of comments addressing the issue of implementing the CPS and the resources 
available for this implementation. A clarification of why Vietnam has the highest IDA allocation ever 
for the next 3 years was requested, since Vietnam is now a MIC and it would be more logical for IDA 
resources to decrease. In relation to this, it was also noted that it could be seen as paradoxical that 
Vietnam has such a high allocation of IDA at the same time as the draft CPS notes that USD 5.8 
billion are undisbursed and implementation is slow. This makes the story line a bit weak. It seems that 
less IDA would be easier, give more incentive for selectivity as well as for more speedy disbursement, 
and it would mean less undisbursed future resources. The WB was asked whether it should not 
consider telling the Government that IDA allocation does not have to be used fully (especially if 
implementation does not improve?)  Finally, there was also interest in seeing more information about 
where the WBG is heading with regards to IBRD, IDA and IFC funds in the medium (and if possible, 
longer) term.  

Civil Society 

Role of civil society 
 Some frustration was expressed about the position and role of civil society in Vietnam by civil society 
representatives.  
 In relation to the above, some participants also felt that the draft CPS did include enough on the role of 
civil society – in Vietnamese society as a whole and in implementing the CPS – civil society 
organizations should have more important role in preparation, implementation and M&E of projects.  
 It was noted that while it is positive that there is now more of a focus on national ownership in the 
debate about aid and development, national ownership should not be defined narrowly as only 
meaning government ownership but should also be referring to citizen ownership.  
 In addition, the Bank was requested to be more vocal in general (and more explicit in the CPS) about 
the important role it can play as an advocate for a bigger space for civil society – the Bank should use 
its position to push for more space and dialogue for civil society.  

131 

 
 
 
 
 
Diagnostics & Framework 
 The Bank was commended for being more frank on various issues, such as governance and the macro -
economic situation than previous CPS‟s. 
 Some concerns were raised about debt sustainability and whether this should be flagged more in the 
CPS as a potential risk. It was also noted that the Bank might want to mention in the CPS that 
economic instability could have some impact on social situation, which emphasizes the need to 
urgently address issues such as rising inflation, corruption, etc., in order to avoid a decrease in public 
trust.  
 Additional questions were raised to the WBG, such as: (i) whether it would be useful to include low 
case-high case scenarios in the CPS for the macroeconomic situation, (ii) whether the Bank should 
have a specific strategy for Mekong Region (like ADB), and whether the Bank is addressing poverty 
among ethnic minorities enough and in the right way in the CPS.  Cash transfers might help, but other 
barriers are just as important for ethnic minorities (language, prejudice, self perceptions, learning 
outcomes and motivation in education, etc.).

ANNEX 16: PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN VIETNAM 

Overview  

Over the past decade, Vietnam has made strides in establishing a sound public financial 
management system.  With the adoption of the first organic budget law in 1996 and its revision in 2002, 
a legal framework for public resource management has been put in place.  A centralized treasury system 
is being set up with branches extending from the center to all provinces and districts to provide basic 
essential financial services to all government agencies.  Steady progress has been achieved in making the 
budget more predictable and pro-poor, and the budgeting process more transparent and participatory.  
Substantial efforts have also been made in recent years to improve transparency in the use of public 
resources through disclosure of information on detailed government spending as well as expenditure 
policies, regulations and procedures.   

There is strong ownership in the Vietnamese Government of the PFM reform agenda.  MOF 
is currently engaged, as are other Ministries, in developing a reform strategy for 2011-2020. The strategy 
aims at (i) maintenance of stability of public finances within the broader economy; (ii) improved 
effectiveness of public sector expenditure in achieving policy and service delivery; (iii) development of 
effective influence by government over key finance markets; and (iv) effective and efficient resource 
mobilization to finance public expenditures. Support to the implementation of reforms is coordinated 
through the PFM partnership group which overarches the activities of government, donors, and working 
groups, meeting half yearly to discuss progress. There is ongoing effort among donors to directly align 
their support with the mainstreaming government‟s strategies and plans.   

PFM remains in the center of Public Sector reforms. Other focus areas are organizational 
restructuring, pay and employment reform, and institutional development.  The PFM reforms hinge on 
seven priorities: budget management, revenue management, debt management , SOE fiscal risk 
management, financial market supervision and government bond market development, public asset 
management, and price management.   

The overall conclusion of the latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA 
2007) stated that PFM arrangements and their implementation and performance pose a moderate 
risk that funds will not be properly controlled or used for intended purposes.  The CFAA proposed a 
set of recommendations to help the government design and continue implementing reforms and capacity 
building programs to modernize and strengthen PFM and enhance transparency and accountability 
arrangements in support of sound economic management and improved governance. 

Even though a series of analytical work, such as Public Expenditure Review (PER) or 
CFAA, have been undertaken every three to four years, progress and impact of the PFM reforms 
and development initiatives can only be measured by establishing an official monitoring 
framework, and baseline performance measures. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability 
(PEFA) measurement framework provides a recognized measurement of the performance of the public 
financial management of government.  Similarly, the Debt Management Performance Assessment 
(DeMPA), adapted from the PEFA framework, but is focused on debt management issues, would provide 
a baseline assessment of debt management capacity. Although the government has agreed in principle to 
introducing these measurement frameworks through pilot self-assessment process in 2011 (PEFA) and 
2012 (DeMPA), no firm decision on detailed timeframe and commitment of resources have been made.  
Within the MOF, the number of technically-qualified and experienced managerial staff needs to be 
increased to meet the reform challenges of the Ministry. Support is needed for Capacity building across 
sectors and sub-national government to implement decentralized PFM reforms. 

133 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recent Developments and the Way Ahead 

PFM legal and institutional framework. The CFAA reported that since 2004, implementation 
of the 2002 State Budget Law and the 2005 Accounting Law has progressed and a State Audit Law has 
been enacted. However, it also noted that some confusion and overlap in budget responsibilities remain in 
the budgeting system which is limiting the participation of sectors in resource planning, budgeting and 
budget management and confuses accountabilities between the national and sub-national levels.  
Furthermore with the redevelopment of the government accounting systems and regimes, the Accounting 
Law is no longer adequate and needs revision, and the basis for accounting needs to be better defined, 
however there is no clear plan at that this time to revise the Accounting Law. The State Budget Law will 
be revised and re-submitted to the National Assembly in 2012, expectedly including a number of critical 
changes to state administration in Vietnam such as enhanced decentralization to sub-national government 
and adjusted fiscal authority of central vis-à-vis sub-national tiers of government in budget approval. 

PFM information systems. The Treasury and Budgetary Management Information System 
(TABMIS) will progressively address difficulties in monitoring a fully-consolidated budget as well as the 
fiscal position.  TABMIS has been developed since 2007, piloted in 2009, and recently rolled-out to MOF 
and treasuries and financial agencies in 35 out of 63 provinces.  Fifteen largest spending line -ministries 
are getting ready to use TABMIS to conduct budget allocations for 2011. It is expected that the system 
will become fully operational in 2012 upon its nationwide roll-out.  TABMIS will provide the capability 
to record and control commitments, improve cash management and arrears management, and strengthen 
expenditure management and controls. There are initial staged plans for TABMIS consolidation and 
expansion, in both terms of both functionality and coverage, towards the Integrated/Government Financial 
Management Information System (IFMIS).  

Public accounting regulations.  In parallel with TABMIS project, a unified Treasury and 
Budgetary Chart of Accounts has been developed to provide consistency of classification of revenues and 
expenditures in budgeting, accounting and reporting with expenditures classified on an administrative, 
economic and functional basis. This will facilitate accurate and timely financial reporting, and the flow of 
budgetary information between government ministries provinces and the public. For future TABMIS 
expansion, development of a unified and uniform chart of accounts for the public sector (including the 
Spending Units) is now envisaged.  A staged roadmap for adoption of the International Public Sector 
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) is also being developed to align government accounting regimes and 
practices with international standards. 

Budget development and execution. Vietnam‟s budget coverage is reasonably comprehensive 
but still incomplete compared to international practices. Budget gaps arise from the lack of clarity in the 
state budget coverage of user fees and charges of many service delivery units, lack of integration o r 
disclosure of the financial positions of public financial funds, untimely and sometimes inadequate 
incorporation of donor financing, and off-budget government bonds. Budget execution variations arise 
from such practices as revenue underestimation particularly for crude oil revenues, keeping the state 
accounts open after year end with post year expenditures recorded against previous year unused budgets, 
and over implementing construction and development plans. Separate preparation of the recurrent and 
capital investment budgets hampers effective management of resources and the composition of public 
expenditure remains unbalanced. 

Public expenditure is planned annually and also for medium-term over five year periods but the 
linkage between the two remains weak. The ongoing revision of the State Budget Law introduces 
Medium-Term Fiscal and Expenditure Framework, to be mainstreamed in the annual budget cycle. There 
are also initial discussions on reforming budget planning toward output- and program-based budget 
elaboration. 

134 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Off-budget-balance expenditures, i.e., expenditures not counted in the calculation of the budget 
deficit, include government bonds issued to finance infrastructure projects and education facilities, 
recapitalization of entities such as the Vietnam Development Bank or the Vietnam Social Policy Bank, 
and borrowings by sub-national governments and their affiliated entities such as local development funds.  
However, these so-called off-budget expenditures in Vietnam can be considered on-budget in several 
respects. They are included in the budget that is reviewed and approved by the National Assembly, and 
their execution was done through the Treasury and subject to the same disclosures and scrutiny as 
standard budget expenditures.  There are attempts under the ongoing revision of the State Budget Law to 
adjust budget structure and coverage to be more in line with the international norms.   

Contingent liabilities might be arising from these “off-budget-balance expenditures” and other 
implicit sources. A systemic definition and a reliable estimate of such contingent liabilities are not 
available, which limits the government‟s ability to manage such risks properly. More broadly, as Vietnam 
is reaching middle-income status, it will need to engage more long-term finance from both domestic and 
external sources.  Under the recently improved debt management, initial attention from the government 
on risk management and monitoring of contingent liabilities has been observed. Given the recent default 
of one of the largest state owned Economic Groups (Vinashin), MOF is planning to strengthen monitoring 
of fiscal risks from the SOEs.  However, although considered as the country‟s lead agency for national 
and public debt management, MOF has not yet prepared an inventory of government contingent liabilities 
from various sources, due to lack of necessary legal framework, poor data availability and limited 
assessment capacity.  

Revenue administration.  Customs controls are still considered low in productivity, inconsistent 
and vulnerable to corruption.  The Customs administration will need to change significantly, shifting its 
mindset from a culture of domestic protection and control of all transactions to one that facilitates foreign 
trade and promotes private sector development.  The tax administration is also characterized by low 
compliance and vulnerability towards corruption.  Five areas of tax administration have been identified as 
in need of special attention: (1) the fragmentation of the legal framework related to tax administration;  
(2) the absence of effective coordination and information-sharing between the tax administration and 
other government agencies; (3) taxpayers‟ lack of knowledge about the tax laws and compliance 
procedures; (4) inadequate professional skills and training of tax administration; and (5) information 
technology system which is lagging behind the requirements of a modern tax administration.  In addition, 
tax laws and policies will need further reforms to broaden the tax base, and to reduce the number of rates 
and exemptions. Reforms in the management of revenue are progressing with clearer allocation rules and 
decentralized responsibilities; however classification of revenue in line with international standards needs 
to be introduced, and enhanced consultation on revenue targets is needed to improve the quality of 
revenue budgets. 

Public debt management has improved both in terms of legal framework and institutional 
arrangements. The Debt Management Department was established in May 2009 with the role of a modern 
debt management office under the MOF.  Although not all of the tasks relating to public debt 
management have been consolidated to this Department, the organizational structure of the department is 
similar to the debt management office according to international practices, with 6 divisions functioning as 
front office, one division performing the middle office functions, and one division performing the back 
office functions.  Meanwhile, the first-ever Law on public debt management was approved by the 
National Assembly in June 2009 and came into effect in 2010. The Law introduced substantial reforms in 
managing and monitoring comprehensively public debt and government commitments (including 
domestic sub-national debts and on-lending), and addressing many weaknesses in the public debt 
management in Vietnam. A series of guiding decrees were adopted in 2010 to facilitate the 
implementation of the law. Special attention is now paid to strengthening risk management and 
developing forward-looking debt management strategy and program.  

135 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial market supervision and the government bond market. At present, many agencies 
participate in financial market supervision, leading to overlapping responsibilities and ineffective 
management and supervision.  There is a need to consolidate market supervision functions into a single 
agency and to separate state management and supervision functions.  Vietnam‟s government bond market 
is still small scale, low liquidity, and the maturity structure is skewed toward short-term.  The number of 
market participants is relatively small and supporting infrastructure, such as depository, clearing and 
information systems, is yet to be developed.  Therefore, considerable efforts are required to develop a 
full-fledged government bond market and coordinate it with development of related markets such as 
capital, security and real estate. A bond market development roadmap is being prepared towards these 
visions. 

The government’s PFM reform program highlights that state assets budget resources and 
human resources need to be managed in an integrated way for efficient and effective service 
delivery, and reforms are being gradually introduced. The legal framework and market principles in 
asset management were recently adopted under the Law on State Asset Management.  The requirements 
for management reporting systems are being defined, but reform in this area has been slow. Initially, 
attention is needed for developing consistent and comprehensive asset accounting and asset management 
policies in line with international standards and practices.  Further study will be carried out in 2011 to 
determine the most appropriate solutions to address the government‟s accounting and asset management 
requirements. 

Independent scrutiny of PFM has significantly increased, with external oversight of 
budgetary affairs by the National Assembly and the recently independent State Audit of Vietnam 
(SAV).  The functional committees and deputies of the National Assembly, and the local People‟s 
Committees have been given greater prominence in examining, decision-making and oversight of the state 
budget. There is steady expansion of external audit coverage and quality, and legislative oversight.  
Encouragingly, the SAV audit report was made public for the first time in 2006, and regularly since, 
triggering serious debates where are broadcasted live on the usage of state budgets.  However, the 
capacity of these institutions, especially the SAV, is limiting the coverage and scope of audits.  It is 
difficult for the SAV to manage the increasing workload including compulsory audit for 100 percent of 
SOEs, and to consider the move towards performance audit. Significantly, the SAV has recently approved 
an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to 2020 (with accompanying implementation plan to 2015) 
aimed at upgrading its capacity across the key areas of organizational and legal framework, human 
resources, audit planning and methodologies (including performance audit), information technology, and 
external relations. 

The country’s public financial management system has a range of internal oversight 
mechanisms. In the past, the focus was on inspection rather than systematic review to provide regular and 
timely feedback to the management on the use of public resources.   Internal auditing is an important 
element of a sound public financial management system, which helps increase effectiveness, efficiency 
and financial control.  This issue becomes even more important if the government intends to decentralize 
further to the local levels.  The legal and institutional frameworks for the organization and operation of 
internal audit are being developed. Although implementation will be challenging, this has been a very 
encouraging step towards establishing a sound internal audit system in Vietnam in the coming years.  

Vietnam has increased its level of fiscal transparency. Budget plans and budget execution 
accounts are being made available publicly, and there is increasing compliance with reporting regulations. 
However there is still room for improvement, particularly in relation to consistency in quality of reports 
and their timeliness.  The draft budget plan should be disclosed before National Assembly‟s approval. To 
enhance the quality of financial reporting, consistency between budget and accounting classifications 

136 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needs to be maintained. The number of budget execution reports needs to be rationalized.  Content and 
presentation of financial information needs to be improved in line with existing government regulations in 
the publicly available budget execution reports to make them more informative.  Enabled by TABMIS, 
MOF has committed to, by 2013, publish monthly and more disaggregated budget execution reports on 
MOF website 15 days after month end, as opposed to the current practice of publicize quarterly and 
aggregated report 45 days after quarter end. In addition, the government is establishing a State 
Accounting General function, and working toward producing and issuing annual financial statements, 
including cash and asset information, in line with international practices.  The annual final accounts need 
to be issued faster than the current 18 months, e.g. 9 months, after year end to enhance their relevance to 
the discussions on the budget of the subsequent year. 

Good progress has been made in establishing legislation and the environment for greater 
financial accountability and transparency of financial information. Regulations on financial 
disclosures of the State Budget Law, Accounting Law and State Audit Law have been issued increasing 
the scope and range of required disclosures by entities at all levels of government. Information is being 
made available on public accessible websites. However, implementation remains the challenge. To further 
increase transparency, the content of budget documentation and the final accounts could be enhanced by 
including analysis, explanations and information in line with international practices.  Disclosure of 
financial information, particularly spending at unit level should be actively monitored to ensure 
compliance with the enhanced disclosure requirements. Published financial reports should be timely, and 
a calendar for disclosures issued publicly.

ANNEX 17: OVERVIEW OF MAIN TRUST FUNDS 

 Vietnam is one of the biggest users of Trust Funds (TFs) in the World Bank. During FY07-
FY11, the total amount committed through TFs in Vietnam reached  US$726 million, including almost 
US$700 million for project related activities (project preparation, cofinancing, GEFs, JSDF, and TA for 
projects), US$15 million for non-lending TA, US$4.7 million for Institutional Development Fund (IDF) 
activities, and US$2.3 million for Economic and Sector Work.  In FY10, the Vietnam Program reached 
US$100 million in Trust Fund disbursements, ranking 7th in the Bank after Afghanistan, West Bank and 
Gaza, Ethiopia, China, Indonesia, and Sudan in terms of TF disbursements.  In FY11, committed and 
disbursed amounts from Trust Funds reached US$296 million, and US$170 million, respectively, in 
Vietnam.

Trust Funds are used effectively in support of the Government’s development agenda 
through the Bank’s Country Program.  The instrument is also used as a platform for development 
partners to work together to achieve common goals.  Trust Fund resources are used to support Bank 
investment lending as well as policy operations.  A noteworthy example has been the joint financing of 
the PRSC series.  For PRSCs 1 - 10, more than 14 development partners in Vietnam have joined forces to 
support the Government‟s efforts to improve public management, financial sector strengthening, poverty 
reduction policy measures, etc.  The total financing mobilized through PRSCs 1-9 has amounted to 
US$1.219 billion from Development Partners combined with US$1.475 billion from the Bank side, for a 
total of US$2.694 billion. In addition to the resources that TFs have brought to the country, the joint 
financing mechanism has also provided a platform for the Government and Development Partners to 
discuss critical policy issues.   Trust Funds also support the Government in strengthening their fiduciary 
capacity.  IDFs have among other things been used for public financial management regulatory work, 
supporting the public procurement framework and strengthening internal audit, some of the key areas of 
concern for both Development Partners and the Bank. In addition, IDFs have provided a platform for joint 
work between the Bank and other donors (such as the working groups under the Six Bank Initiative). 
Trust Funds have furthermore provided emergency support for Avian Influenza, and piloting of new 
approaches for helping disadvantaged children learn better to name just a few examples.  

During the CPS period, the use of trust funds will shift in accordance with the new ODA 
Strategic Framework being developed by Government.  With Vietnam having recently become a 
middle income country and with several donors presenting exit plans for their aid programs or shifting 
their focus from more traditional engagement areas to emerging issues such as climate change and 
governance, the Government has intensified efforts to utilize its ODA resources more effectively.  Trust 

138 

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
fund availability to the Government through the World Bank will also be affected by this shift.  In the 
context of discussions around the new ODA Strategic Framework, the World Bank is working with other 
development partners on how to sharpen Trust Fund mobilization for the country in this changing aid 
environment and ensure that Trust Funds continue to be available to support Vietnam.    

Key Active Trust Funds in Vietnam 

Mekong Delta Transport Infrastructure Development Project (US$34.7 million):  This Australia-
financed TF co-finances the Mekong Delta Transport Infrastructure Development Project. The project 
development objective is to assist the recipient in relieving key bottlenecks of the main transport corridors 
in the Mekong Delta region and improving access of the poor to those corridors. The grant finances Part 
C of the project – connecting the Poor to the Supply Corridors. 

Third Rural Transport Project (US$39.7 million for two grants): These TFs funded by DFID co-
finance the Third Rural Transport Project. The objective of the project is to assist Vietnam in improving 
the access (including reducing the costs of access) of rural communities to markets, non-farm economic 
opportunities and social services.  

HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (US$27.7 million): This DFID-financed TF co-finances the HIV/AIDS 
Prevention Project which is to assist the recipient in establishing and maintaining national, provincial and 
local policies and capacity to design, implement and evaluate information and service delivery programs 
designed to halt the transmission of HIV/AIDS among vulnerable populations and between vulnerable 
populations and the general population, thereby assisting the recipient in the implementation of its 
National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. 

Vietnam Health Care Support to the Poor of the Northern Uplands and Central Highlands 
(US$16.2 million). The objective of this TF financed by the European Commission is to increase 
coverage of essential health services particularly at the commune level, and to improve health service 
planning, particularly at the district level in the project Provinces. 

Governance and Poverty Policy Analysis and Advice Program (US$7.3 million). This DFID-financed 
TF supports the Bank in advising the clients on evidence-based policy making and implementation. 
Through the enhanced WB activities and support, the Vietnamese government's social inclusion and 
governance agenda are expected to be further promoted. GAPAP has four goals: (a) Strengthened Bank 
interaction and advice in a range of Vietnamese institutions for data collection, analysis and monitoring of 
critical governance and poverty challenges over the next 5 years; (b) Well informed policy analyses for 
discussions with clients on governance and poverty; (c) Critical inputs to the Government on improving 
transparency, accountability and social inclusion.  This includes advice to the Government on 
performance monitoring; and (d) Broadened and strengthened dialogue through PRSCs 7 - 10 on 
governance and results. 

Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF) to support Public Financial Management Modernization in 
Vietnam (US$7.1 million): This MDTF is financed by six donors: AusAID, the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA), the Danish International Development Agency , the EC, the Netherlands 
Development Organization, and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. The TF helps 
strengthen the recipient‟s capacity to implement selected reforms and in managing a technical assistance 
program. It also helps conducting analytical and diagnostic works in the seven key areas, including 
budget management, budget revenue management, debt management, financial market supervision and 
bond market development, corporate finance management, public asset management, and price control.

ANNEX 18: THE BANK’S DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS IN VIETNAM 

In addition to the semi-annual Consultative Group meetings and related events, the Bank 
actively participates in the Aid Effectiveness Forum (AEF).45  This is an important vehicle for making 
aid more predictable, coordinated, and effective.  Partners now include the National Assembly Office, 
Sectoral Partnership Groups, International Support Groups, mass organizations and professional 
associations, international NGOs, and other development actors.  The AEF has two main objectives:  (i) 
achieving the commitments and targets set out in Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness; and (ii) 
contributing to the development of new aid partnerships.   

The Bank continues to be engaged with Vietnam’s 18 currently active Sectoral and 
International Partnership Groups.  Their effectiveness and engagement vary, as do their contributions 
to the formulation and implementation of sectoral development strategies and plans.  There is a general 
sense that the groups could be made more efficient and effective, and AEF has initiated a comprehensive 
mapping exercise in order to demonstrate how they function and what impact they have. While the Bank 
will not be highly active in all the Partnership Groups, it will take a more active role in selected groups in 
the new CPS period and contribute to making these Partnership fora more relevant and meaningful. 

There has been considerable progress in coordination and streamlining of procedures 
within the “Six Banks Group” in Vietnam.  This partner group consists of the Bank, ADB, JICA, 
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), Agence Française de Développement (AFD), and the Export-
Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM).46  The Six Banks Group has been actively engaged in the recent multi -
country evaluation of the Paris Declaration/Hanoi Core Statement.  Its members are also co -chairing the 
AEF‟s thematic groups on public procurement (ADB), financial management (the Bank), social impact 
assessment (ADB), and environmental impact assessment (the Bank).  The Six Banks Group has been 
working with Government on several key areas such as drafting the forthcoming Public Investment Law 
(a key element of the Public Investment Reform Program supported by the Bank); reforming 
administrative cost norms; strengthening the public-private partnership framework, country systems in 
public procurement, financial management, and social and environmental impact assessments; and 
reviewing the structure of Vietnam‟s PMUs.  A number of analyses on the use of ODA and less 
concessional financing in the transition period have been conducted with support from the Bank, ADB, 
and JICA. The Bank furthermore participates in a Joint Portfolio Performance Review (JPPR) with the 
Six Banks Group and Government every two years and is currently preparing for the next JPPR scheduled 
for late 2011.   

The PRSC has been an extremely important long standing platform for partnerships for the 
Bank. With its ten consecutive budget support operations, the PRSC was the vehicle for an 
unprecedented partnership involving 14 development partners and more than 15 ministries and agencies. 
The series supported wide ranging reforms and was rated highly on policy dialogue and impact by 
independent evaluations. It mobilized around US$ 1,500 million from the World Bank and around US$ 
1,100 from development partners.  

While addressing some of the weaknesses of especially the later rounds of the PRSC, the 
Bank will seek to build on the success of the series and replicate the main idea in the successor 
operation, the EMCC. The EMCC will focus on macroeconomic stability and supporting institutions 
that promote the business environment and public sector governance.  While the focus of this new 

45 The AEF, formed in 2010, succeeded the Partnership Group on Aid Effectiveness. 
46 JICA and The World Bank represent the Six Banks Group in the AEF‟s Executive Committee.

platform will therefore not be as broad as the PRSC series, the Bank hopes that it will continue to be a 
vehicle for successful partnerships. 

The Bank has a number of very important bilateral partnerships. One of our most important 
bilateral partners in Vietnam is DFID, who the Bank collaborates with across several operations in the 
areas of HIV/AIDS, rural transport; poverty, governance, gender and most recently CC (see Annex 20). 
Also worth mentioning is an increasingly important and broad partnership with Australia in the fields of 
infrastructure and economic reform (Annex 20).  The Bank will seek ways to explore more such strategic 
partnerships moving forward. 

Vietnam’s recent status as MIC means that some bilateral donors are starting to phase out . 
While this will also lead to a gradual phasing out of some of the Bank‟s current partners, at the same time, 
it will open up for possibilities for more “silent” partnerships with some of the development partners, who 
will be scaling down their physical presence in Vietnam some time ahead of terminating their financial 
presence in the country. The Bank needs to explore the possibility for such mutually beneficial 
partnerships in coming years.  

Many of bilateral donors as well as a number of international NGOs are engaged in a 
variety of innovative and interesting small operations in Vietnam. The Bank will seek ways to use 
these operations as “incubators” for ideas and innovations and learning. The Bank is thus interested in 
building new partnerships with some of these donors and NGOs to scale up successful small operations 
that use innovative approaches and ideas in the Bank‟s own program.

ANNEX 20: STATISTICAL CAPACITY AND M&E SYSTEMS 

Vietnam’s monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was developed during the years of the 
centrally planned economy and inherited the typical characteristics of this economic model.  It 
emphasizes inputs and outputs.  At the core of the system is a set of cost and technical norms that are 
developed by the Ministry of Finance and line ministries.  The norms are reviewed and updated regularly 
by the relevant agencies through a time-consuming process.  As a result, these norms are often out of date 
due to rapid changes in technology and volatility of prices in a market economy.   

Another salient feature of Vietnam’s M&E system is its focus on responsibilities of 
individual agencies, with little attention paid to inter-agency issues.  M&E is commonly carried out 
by regular administrative reports and short inspection visits, both of which tend to emphasize issues 
within a given agency‟s administrative borders.  Strategically important inter-agency issues are 
commonly dealt with by inter-ministerial committees, which merely play a coordinating role with limited 
influence on resource allocation and use.  As a result, the majority of development outcomes which 
commonly go beyond a given agency‟s boundaries are either not the main objective of the M&E, or their 
monitored progress does not inform policy actions for strategic coherence.   

Support for planning reform has been a priority of the Bank policy dialogue, especially with 
the formulation and implementation of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Strategy (CPRGS) since 2001.  It has also been a high priority for other donors over the past ten years.    
The Bank coordinated donors‟ support in the formulation of the SEDP 2006-10 and provided direct TA, 
including a series of trainings for MPI, line ministries, and selected provinces; and participation in MPI‟s 
drafting team for the M&E framework.   ADB and the UNDP also provided resources.   

Vietnam has taken a number of steps to strengthen use of M&E information and to move 
towards the use of results-based approaches to planning.  The country‟s 2006-2010 SEDP sought to 
establish a comprehensive set of indicators within a logical framework. The results -based approach was 
also piloted in a number of provinces and line ministries.  It introduces the use of outcome indicators 
derived from the MDGs as well as from the country-specific Vietnam Development Goals outlined in 
Vietnam‟s CPRGS.  These indicators are not widely used due to the absence of an official mandate as 
well as in some cases limited quality and availability of data.  The regulatory foundation for the reform of 
the M&E system was introduced with the issuance of the Investment M&E Decree in 2009 and its 
implementation Circulars in 2010.  In addition, the Ministry of Planning and Investment is preparing a 
Planning Decree which is expected to institutionalize many aspects of a results-based M&E system. 
However, the M&E framework is actually not being used for monitoring SEDP performance, as the 
framework was seen by some ministries as a result of technical donor assistance that was only 
institutionalized by MPI but lacked the legal status or authority to guide other ministries or provinces. 
Donors have mainly relied on the PRSC matrix  

Three major lessons can be drawn from the previous initiative on strengthening the M&E 
framework for SEDP: i) There is a need to support statistical capacity beyond the National Statistical 
Indicators System (NSIS); ii) M&E strengthening support should be selective and focused on ensuring 
that gradual institutional capacity is developed and integrated into the government operation process; and 
iii) It is important to ensure involvement of a wide range of stakeholders in the process. 

On the first point, in order to strengthen statistical capacity for the M&E system in 
Vietnam it is necessary to provide support beyond just NSIS/General Statistics Office (GSO) to also 
include line ministries and, when possible, provincial agencies. Three main sources of information 
have been identified for a strengthened M&E system: (i) information produced by GSO as part of the 
NSIS; (ii) information produced from reporting systems by line ministries and provincial agencies; and 

146 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(iii) additional information to be obtained by supplementary surveys.  Vietnam has put considerable effort 
into developing a strong statistical agency for household surveys and censuses to inform its national 
statistical indicator system.  But it has faced challenges in relation to timely release of data and adequate 
dissemination and transparency.  Also, at times there has been a disconnect between user needs and data 
production. Regular nationwide data for a number of important areas such as environmental management 
and governance are yet to be collected.  There is also significant room for quality improvement of data 
collected by line ministries and provincial agencies, given the existence of different methodologies and 
definitions of various indicators. 

Vietnam has recently drawn up the Vietnam Statistical Development Strategy (VSDS) .  
While the strategy is being used to draw up action plans that will hopefully serve as a guide to donors 
wishing to support the development of the national data system, the VSDS concentrates mostly on GSO, 
and not on the line ministries‟ administrative data. The future support on statistical capacity should thus 
be directed towards supporting better coordination between government agencies (including line 
ministries and provinces), and especially between GSO and the rest of the agencies in sharing and making 
data available in a timely manner (including budget information and survey raw data). This needs to be 
supported both by the government‟s legal framework (on sharing information and making raw data 
available for analytical work to support policy formulation) and by continued support from donors 
(supporting both GSO and other government agencies).  

As noted above, the second lesson focuses on the need for M&E strengthening to be selective 
and focused to ensure gradual institutional capacity being developed and integrated into the 
government operation process.  The country‟s planning system should become more strategic, with a 
clearer vision of how government can achieve its objectives, as well as focusing on a smaller number of 
high-level indicators. The selectiveness could be done in several ways (at sectoral level, in a few selected 
key programs/projects, etc.). The focus should be on improving the quality of monitoring and reporting, 
and to eventually incorporate a strengthening of evaluation capacity, when the M&E information 
produced would be sufficient to support evaluations. Good M&E work from donor-funded projects could 
also be scaled up to sectoral projects/programs that are government funded. 

The final lesson is that increased dialogue among the stakeholders is key to converging 
demand and supply sides.    The Ministry of Finance is an important example of this. MOF currently 
focuses on building capacity for its core fiscal policy management functions and is not an advocate for 
using strengthened results-based M&E in its decisions and processes.  However, MOF‟s utilization of 
M&E information would greatly strengthen M&E efforts within the country.  Therefore, other M&E 
champions and key stakeholders should engage MOF and address the need for the agency to assess the 
performance of public spending and utilize M&E information in allocating fiscal resources.  There is also 
a need for improved coordination between GSO and MOLISA on poverty monitoring and targeting. 
Similarly, engagement by other important key stakeholders, including overseers/ legislators (MOF, MPI, 
the National Assembly, the State Audit, etc), and civil society is also important to the process. 

Bank support has continued during formulation of the SEDP 2011-15, albeit with reduced 
scope compared to support provided for the SEDP 2006-2010 M&E Framework.  Support focused 
on development of results-based M&E, assessment of the implementation of the SEDP 2006-2010 using 
its M&E framework, and drafting of the Planning Decree.  The Bank has also supported the development 
of the VSDS via a grant from the Trust Fund on Statistical Capacity Building – in addition to 
programmatic support on the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey, the Labor Force Survey, and 
other data instruments.  The Bank also currently serves on the Technical Advisory Board to the VSDS.   
The Bank will continue to include impact evaluation as part of project design, in order to help mainstream 
capacity building for M&E and demand and meaningful applications for national statistical systems , 
learning from the lessons drawn from previous experiences to improve future interventions.

ANNEX 21: COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS 

The country financing parameters for Vietnam set out below have been approved by the Regional Vice 
President, East Asia and Pacific, and are being posted on the Bank‟s internal website. 

Item 

Parameter 

Remarks/Explanation 

Cost sharing. Limit on the proportion of 
individual project costs that the Bank may 
finance 

100 percent 

In Vietnam, 
this policy 
is being 
applied in a targeted fashion, focusing 
primarily on interventions in social 
sectors, 
poorer 
provinces, 
and 
decentralized 
projects. 
The 
Government will continue to finance 
its share as deemed necessary. 

Recurrent cost financing. Any limits that 
would apply to the overall amount of 
recurrent expenditures that the Bank may 
finance. 

NONE 

In Vietnam, financing of recurrent 
costs continues to be on a highly 
selective basis and within a sound and 
sustainable fiscal framework. 

Yes 

Local cost financing. Are the requirements 
for Bank financing of local expenditures 
met, namely that: (i) financing requirements 
for the country‟s development program 
would exceed the public sector‟s own 
resource (e.g., from taxation and other 
revenues) 
and 
expected 
domestic 
borrowing; and (ii) the financing of foreign 
expenditures alone would not enable the 
Bank to assist in the financing of individual 
projects 

Taxes and duties. Are there any taxes and 
duties that the Bank would not finance? 

NONE 

None of the taxes and duties in 
Vietnam is judged to be excessive.
