EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Recent Economic Developments.  Uzbekistan has enjoyed robust gross domestic product 
(GDP) growth since the mid-2000s—averaging 8 percent annually according to official data―due 
mainly to three factors: first, favorable terms of trade, in particular the continued high world market 
prices of the country‘s key export commodities—copper, gold, natural gas and, since 2010, cotton; 
second, the government‘s macro-economic management, including its end-2008 stimulus; and third, 
limited exposure to international financial markets, which shielded it from contagion effects. 

ii. 
Economic Prospects.  Overall growth is projected to continue around 7-8 percent annually 
during 2011-14, supported by net exports and a large capital investment program.  World prices for 
Uzbekistan‘s principal exports are currently projected to remain favorable at least through the first 
half of the FY12-15 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) period.  The impact of recent increases in 
global food and energy prices is expected to be limited because of Uzbekistan‘s policy of self-
sufficiency in both food grains and energy.  Given the authorities‘ plans to finance up to two-thirds of 
their investment program from external sources, including loans, external debt is expected to increase 
gradually.   

iii. 
Development Challenges and Opportunities.  The authorities‘ vision is for Uzbekistan to 
become an industrialized, high middle-income country by mid-century.  Critical elements for such a 
transformation include: (a) increasing the economy‘s efficiency and competitiveness and reducing its 
dependency on a few commodity exports; (b) strengthening the financial sector to support private 
entrepreneurial activity; (c) diversifying production towards higher value-added activities where 
comparative advantage can be demonstrated; (d) creating jobs for the rapidly growing population of 
young educated people; and (e) improving governance, including access to information on 
government policies and their outcomes.   

iv. 
Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy. The authorities‘ approach toward 
achieving these goals is to continue the gradual transition to a more market -oriented economy, to 
ensure equitable distribution of growth between regions, and to maintain infrastructure and social 
services.  Their medium-term growth and development strategy is reflected in a five-year Industrial 
Modernization and Infrastructure Development Program (2011-15) and in recently issued presidential 
decrees.  These documents embody four cross-cutting development policy goals and priorities:  

 
 

 
 

to increase the efficiency of infrastructure, especially of energy, transport, and irrigation;  
to enhance the competitiveness of specific industries, such as agro-processing, 
petrochemicals, and textiles;  
to diversify the economy and thereby reduce its reliance on commodity exports; and 
to improve access to and the quality and outcomes of education, health and other social 
services.  

v. 
Bank Group Strategy.  The strategy‘s principal goal is to support implementation of these 
four development policy objectives and priorities.  It will continue with the two-track approach 
employed under the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)—namely full or limited 
engagement, depending on the extent of agreement with the authorities on the direction of reforms in 
the policy areas or sectors concerned.  In practice, this means that CPS support for increasing the 
efficiency of infrastructure  and for human development and social inclusion—where government 
and Bank Group views broadly converge—will broaden and deepen the operational involvement and 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
related policy dialogue already in place from the previous CAS.  Conversely, support for the 
government‘s industrial competitiveness and economic diversification agenda , where government 
and Bank Group perspectives differ, will be limited initially to analytical and advisory services.  
Overall, the CPS‘s framework and the program outlined below reflect the refo rm priorities that 
emerged from last year‘s dialogue with the authorities on the outcome of the 2009 country 
performance institutional assessment (CPIA).  They are also broadly aligned with the Europe and 
Central Asia (ECA) region‘s three strategic pillars of competitiveness, inclusion, and climate change. 

vi. 
Bank Group Program.  The provisional lending program comprises fifteen operations over 
the four years FY12-15, of which eleven will support reforms and investments for achieving 
sustainable growth, including more efficient energy use and diversification of exports.  The total 
financial envelope will be about $1.3 billion, i.e. commitments averaging about $325 million 
annually.  Besides new lending, the existing portfolio of investment projects will support the 
infrastructure efficiency and social inclusion elements of the government‘s strategy.  Proposed 
analytical and advisory services will cover all four elements of the government‘s growth and 
development strategy.  In addition, , the provisional list of analytical and advisory services includes a 
proposed joint strategy report ―Uzbekistan Vision 2030‖.  This would lay out roadmaps to facilitate 
implementation of the authorities‘ industrial development, competitiveness and diversification 
agenda.   

vii. 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Program.  IFC will maintain its focus on private 
sector development through a combined investment and advisory approach.  It will seek opportunities 
in the following priority areas: (a) direct investments in the real sectors, such as general 
manufacturing, services, and agribusiness; (b) strengthening access to finance for private sector 
through banks, especially by strengthening privately owned banks; and (c) encouraging private sector 
participation in infrastructure. 

viii. Risks.  While the country‘s economic, political and social environment is currently stable, 
CPS implementation could be affected by a combination of risk factors.  Regionally, these include 
deteriorating security conditions due to the situation in Afghanistan, and increasing tensions between 
Uzbekistan and its neighbors over regional issues—especially the management and use of trans-
boundary energy and water resources.  Domestically, they include the economy‘s vulnerability to 
possible external shocks affecting commodity prices and the anticipated inflow of foreign direct 
investment (FDI) and external loans to finance the large public investment program.  The three main 
risks to CPS implementation are: (a) the significant political commitment required to confron t 
bottlenecks currently blocking the efficient functioning of the economy and private sector 
development; (b) the lack of reliable data and related effectiveness of Bank Group policy advice; and 
(c) implementation delays and the potential for mis-procurement as a result of the authorities‘ 
contract expertise and price verification process.  The program includes measures designed to 
manage or mitigate these risks.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The FY12-15 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds upon the experience of the 
previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which ended on June 30, 2011.  The FY08-11 
CAS, reflecting increased engagement following the FY06-07 Interim Strategy Note (ISN), adopted a 
two-track approach.  This was defined as: full engagement, comprising both lending and analytical 
and advisory services in policy areas and sectors of common agreement on the path and pace of 
reform; and limited engagement, comprising only analytical and advisory services in areas where 
there was no, or incomplete consensus.  It anticipated IDA15 financing in the range $375-450 million 
for FY08-FY11, with non-lending activities focused on key sector and thematic areas proposed by 
the government. Eight operations totaling $533 million were approved during the period, including a 
$110 million IBRD loan for energy in FY11—the largest sector investment loan to Uzbekistan to 
date. While this outcome exceeded expectations in mid-2008, it remains modest both in absolute 
terms and relative to the size of Uzbekistan‘s economy and population as well as the country‘s 
regional role and importance.1   

2. 
Continuing the two track approach, the CPS proposes a program linked to the 
efficiency, competitiveness, diversification, and social equity elements of the government’s 
medium-term growth and development strategy.  Thus, support for increasing the efficiency of 
infrastructure and for improving access to social services and its outcomes, where government and 
Bank Group views broadly converge, will combine new lending, within a $1.3 billion IBRD/IDA 
envelope, with related analytical and advisory services, technical assistance, and implementation of 
10 operations currently underway.  Conversely, support for the government‘s competitiveness and 
economic diversification agenda—where government and Bank Group perspectives differ—will be 
limited initially to policy dialogue and possibly technical assistance.  IFC will maintain its focus on 
private sector development through a combined investment and advisory approach.   

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

3. 
Uzbekistan 
is a 
lower middle-income, resource rich, doubly-landlocked country, 
strategically located in the heart of Central Asia.   Its population of about 28.2 million (mid-2010), 
about half of whom live in urban areas, accounts for about forty percent of Central Asia‘s total.  It is the 
world‘s   sixth largest cotton producer 2 and fourth largest raw cotton exporter 3 . Other important 
commodities include natural gas, gold, copper and uranium .  As the only country bordering five other 
Central Asian states including Afghanistan, Uzbekistan‘s economic and social development is 
important not only for its own young and rapidly growing population, but also for the management of 
the region‘s energy, water, and trade as well as for its political stability and security. 

1  Uzbekistan did not fully utilize its IDA allocation in the past. Bank/IDA lending during the 14 years (FY94-07) preceding the previous CAS 
totaled $654.1 million—an annual average of  $47 million or less than $2 per capita—of which $599.1 million was committed between FY94-
03 and $55 million between  FY04-07.

A. Political and Regional Context 

4. 
Uzbekistan’s government and public administration have undergone important 
reforms, especially since the mid-2000s, but continue to be highly centralized.  The influence and 
executive powers wielded by the Presidency and the Cabinet of Ministers (COM)—through 
numerous, sometimes internal, decrees and resolutions—are far reaching; and there appears little 
room for individual ministries or agencies to take even minor decisions or initiatives. Public 
accountability therefore remains weak and voice and participation in economic and social policy 
dialogue is limited.   

5. 
Governance and transparency remain major challenges.  The limited availability of key 
economic, financial, and social data , including consumer price indices (CPI), national accounts, and 
fiscal accounts4, significantly hampers the relevance, timeliness, and value of economic analysis and 
policy advice—both macro and sector-specific. It also undermines Uzbekistan‘s compliance with 
international standards and obligations and indirectly impedes FDI.  The authorities recently 
indicated readiness to provide data for publication in the International Monetary Fund‘s (IMF‘s) 
International Finance Statistics (IFS) and undertook to improve national accounts statistics, but 
progress in implementing these commitments remains slow (cf. Box 1 in the next page).5  They have 
also improved public access to official information and data, including on-line through the State 
Statistics Committee‘s (SSC) website.  Despite these advances, however, data availability remains 
selective.   

6. 
Internationally, Uzbekistan’s relations with key bilateral development and trade 
partners—the European Union, Japan, Russia, the United States and, more recently, China—
have continued to improve.  On the other hand, its interactions with Central Asian neighbors remain 
weighed down by concerns over the management of the region‘s shared energy and water 
resources—exemplified by Uzbekistan‘s opposition to the construction of two large hydropower 
projects in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan that could affect the flow of water it requires for 
irrigation.  Given upstream and downstream countries‘ differing interests as far as energy and water 
are concerned, regional cooperation in these two crucial areas—beyond the minimal bureaucratic and 
technical coordination needed to ensure effective functioning of their integrated infrastructure—is 
likely to remain difficult in the near term. 

B. 

Poverty Profile and Trends 

7. 
Poverty has declined in recent years, due to rapid economic growth, government 
investments, and increased remittances from abroad.  According to official data, poverty as 
measured by a national food-based norm of 2,100 kilo-calories per person per day declined from 27.5 
percent of the population in 2001 to 19.5 percent in 2010 .  Rapid GDP growth, regular increases in 
public sector salaries, and increased remittances mainly from Russia (which peaked at an estimated 7 
percent of GDP in 2008) were the main contributing factors.  Although recent trends imply an 
accelerated decline in poverty since 2005, especially in rural areas, the elasticity of poverty reduction 
to GDP growth remains relatively low.  Explanations include: the low productivity of agriculture 
which still employs one third of the population, but is subject to numerous implicit taxes; the high 
level of informality in the labor market; and the high and growing dependency within households 

4 Uzbekistan provides CPI data, but not in accordance with the generally accepted methodology required under Article VIII, Sect ion 5 of the 
IMF‘s Articles of Agreement.

(i.e. the small number of working adults relative to total household members) and regional 
divergences (i.e. richer regions growing faster). 

Box 1:  Data Availability and Transparency 

     The limited availability and poor quality of key economic, financial, and social data impedes a detailed, realistic 
assessment of the country‘s macroeconomic policies and structural reform performance. During the previous CAS, 
the authorities have made efforts to improve data quality and transparency and this Box summarizes progress 
achieved and challenges remaining in this important area.  

     The main effort to improve access to information on public policies has been through the introduction of 
government-run websites.  A wide range of economic statistics is now available on-line on the State Statistics 
Committee‘s (SSC) website.  However, these data are often not aligned with international data dissemination 
standards.  Specifically, until 2010, economic data had not been reported to any of the internationally recognized 
databases. Tangible progress was made in 2010 when the government published Financial Soundness Indicators on 
the International Monetary Fund‘s (IMF) website.  

     The Bank and the IMF, together with other development partners, have launched a series of initiatives to assist 
the authorities in improving national statistics. Starting 2008, the IMF placed several long -term resident advisors in 
the SSC to provide technical assistance in improving the quality of balance of payments data, restructuring of the  
national accounts data collection system, revising the CPI methodology, and aligning the public financial reporting 
system with international standards. IMF technical assistance has also contributed to the improved quality of fiscal 
and monetary accounts and balance of payments.  A financial statistics dataset is well advanced in terms of 
compliance with international standards and readiness for disclosure to the IMF.  Reconciliation between fiscal and 
monetary data has been streamlined.   

     In addition, the UNICEF and the Bank Group have been providing assistance to improve sampling and data 
collection practices and data analysis methodologies of household surveys, in particular for the 2011 Multi Cluster 
Indicators Survey (MICS)―a large household-level survey covering 20,000 households. It aims to facilitate 
verification of poverty-related statistics.   

In order to move public disclosure forward, the Bank Group engaged with the government on data transparency 
issues under the broader CPIA policy dialogue, linking data transparency with improvement in the overall 
governance environment.  Partly as a result of these efforts, and those of the IMF an April 4, 2011 COM Resolution 
(# 2629) authorized initiation of preparatory work to publish economic data in the IMF‘s databases.  Subject to the 
IMF‘s own procedures and timetables, the first publication is expected by early-2012. Nevertheless, actual progress 
towards improved data transparency remains slow.     

8. 
In 2010, Uzbekistan ranked 102 out of 169 countries on the UNDP’s Human 
Development Index (HDI).  Its score of 0.617 in the HDI‘s ‗medium human development‘ group of 
42 countries, is below the ECA region‘s average of 0.717, but has improved from 0.588 in 2005.  
Uzbekistan has reached its United Nations‘ Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for maternal 
mortality and is on track for child (under five) mortality and reversing the spread of tuberculosis.  Its 
MDG target for improving the quality of primary and basic secondary education while main taining 
universal access is expected to be met.  Reversing and halting the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015 , 
however, is unlikely, and halving poverty—from 27.5 percent in 2001 to 14 percent in 2015—will 
require maintaining high growth rates.  A 2011 government COM resolution ―On additional 
measures for implementing the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in Uzbekis tan‖ 
outlines tasks, measures, outcomes and responsible ministries for each MDG for the period 2011 -15.    

9. 
Uzbekistan’s national targets for gender equality and women’s empowerment are on 
track.  It achieved gender equality in primary and general basic secondary and secondary vocational 
education in 2005 and is expected to improve gender balance in higher education by 2015.  An 

3 

 
 
 
overview of opportunities and outcomes for women, using the upcoming 2012 World Development 
Report‘s (WDR) three-dimensional analytical framework, is summarized in Box 2 below. 

Box 2: Gender in Uzbekistan 

     Endowments: Gender differences at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the education system are 
small, but the educational attainment of employed women is on average higher than employed men.  Access to 
prenatal and family planning services is high, with virtually all births attended by that of skilled health staff and 
97 percent occurring in a health facility.  According to official data, infant mortality is 11/100,000 births, but 
according to field surveys it may be three times higher.  Importantly, there is no gender imbalance at birth.  
Contraceptive prevalence is about 65%. The total fertility rate has roughly halved since the early 1990s, from 4 
to 2 live births per woman.  Women‘s life expectancy exceeds that of men by 4 years.  

     Access to economic opportunities: According to official data, 95 percent of both men and women of 
working age were employed in 2010, although according to survey data female employment is only 50 percent.  
Women account for about 45 percent of the labor force and over 65 p ercent of health and education system 
employees.  They are under-represented in agriculture, construction, industry, and services, and only 25% of 
female entrepreneurs received credit in 2007.  There is also evidence that women are benefiting less than men 
from the restructuring of shirkats into private farms: in 2007, only 7.2 percent of private farmers were women, 
according to Women‘s Committee statistics. 

     Agency: Uzbekistan‘s Constitution and Family Code provide for equal rights and responsibilitie s for men 
and women.  The State Committee for Women‘s Affairs—an officially registered non-governmental 
organization (NGO) comprising a nation-wide network of almost 80,000 primary organizations—coordinates 
and promotes women‘s activities.  Its chairwoman is a Deputy Prime Minister.  There is provision for 
mandatory nomination of female deputies for all administrative bodies at regional, district and township levels 
dealing with women‘s issues.  As a result, nearly 400 women participate in decision -making at various levels of 
government, at the same time acting as head of the local branch of the State Committee for Women‘s Affairs.  
This structure extends down to the community level, where 10,000 women‘s adviser positions have been 
created. It was recently expanded to include full-time positions of Deputy Rectors in charge of women‘s issues 
at all higher education institutions. 

     In terms of the political process, women remain underrepresented and, to address this issue, political parties 
set a quota of 30% for female candidates in elections.  As a result, the number of women deputies in the 
national bi-cameral legislature increased from 9 percent to 17 percent in 2005.  The Speaker of the Legislative 
Chamber (lower house) and the Vice-President of the Senate (upper house) are both women.  Uzbekistan 
ratified the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1996.  
More recently, the government has evidenced increasing commitment to efforts to combat human trafficking.  

C. Recent Economic Developments  

10. 
Uzbekistan has enjoyed robust GDP growth since the mid-2000s—averaging 8 percent 
annually according to official data.  Its economy withstood the 2008-09 global financial crisis 
relatively well.  Three factors explain these positive outcomes: first, favorable terms of trade, in 
particular continued high world market prices for the country‘s key commodities—copper, gold, 
natural gas and, since 2010 cotton; second, the government‘s macro-economic management, 
including its end-2008 stimulus equivalent to 4 percent of GDP, financed partly by the Fund for 
Reconstruction and Development (FRD)—a sovereign wealth fund established in 2006 to collect 
windfall gains from commodity-based revenues; and third, the country‘s limited exposure to world 
financial markets, which largely shielded it from contagion effects.  Nevertheless, remittance inflows

fell by an estimated 30 percent in 2009, which most likely impacted the poorest, most vulnerable 
groups. 

11. 
The 2010 consolidated balance, including FRD resources totaling $4.9 billion, posted a 
surplus equivalent to 2.2 percent of GDP.  This enabled the government to continue its 
interventionist economic policies, including support for import substitution and export promotion.  
Specific measures included budget subsidies, tax holidays, preferential access to credit and foreign 
exchange, as well as duty-free imports of capital goods for enterprises in government-determined 
priority industries. The authorities intend to maintain these policies over the medium term, including 
a fiscal stance aimed at accumulating considerable FRD resources ($10 billion by 2014). 

12. 
Uzbekistan has enjoyed large current account surpluses since 2004, owing to continued 
high prices for its commodity exports, remittances, and the authorities’ export promotion 
efforts.  These surpluses, together with foreign exchange restrictions and net savings as a result of 
the government‘s tight fiscal policy, enabled the central bank to accelerate the accumulation of 
reserves, which had increased to $14.6 billion by 2010—equivalent to over 12.5 months of recorded 
imports, or 38 percent of GDP.  Meanwhile, the authorities‘ zero net borrowing policy improved the 
country‘s debt indicators.  External debt, 70 percent of which is public or publicly guaranteed, 
declined from 64 percent of GDP in 2001 to 15 percent of GDP in 2010, by which date the debt 
service to exports ratio had fallen to about 7 percent.  

13. 
The spread between the official and (curb) market exchange rates in Uzbekistan 
remains considerable reflecting the existing restrictions in the availability of foreign exchange 
and trade.  When export receipts declined in 2008, a spread between the official and curb market 
exchange rates re-emerged, averaging up to 40 percent during 2009-11 (cf. Figure 1 below).  
Although this may not jeopardize overall macroeconomic stability as long as strong internal and 
external surpluses continue, the central bank would decide when to exit from its exchange rate anchor 
if the balance of payments were to weaken.  In this context, the existing level of reserves seems more 
than enough to satisfy the incremental demand for foreign exchange that would arise if current 
restrictions were removed.  A more serious concern is the additional burden the wide spread imposes 
on private businesses that do not have preferential access to foreign exchange , increasing the cost of 
their imports and fueling imported inflation.  It also inflicts an additional de facto tax on cotton and 
wheat producers under the state order or procurement system because government purchases of 
cotton and wheat are valued at the official exchange rate.

Figure 2:  Official inflation data, 1998-2010 

14. 
 Although the reported inflation 
has shown a secular decline, price 
pressures 
remain. 
Prudent 
macroeconomic management, 
selective 
price controls, and the soum‘s de facto peg 
to the US dollar all helped to lower inflation 
which, according to official data, fell from 
double digits through the early 2000s to less 
than 10 percent during 2004-10.  According 
to the State Statistics Committee (SSC), the 
CPI increased 7.2 percent year on year in 
2010 (cf. Figure 2).  Unlike in other 
countries in Europe and Central Asia, 
imported food price inflation is not a major 
risk because Uzbekistan is essentially self-
sufficient in key foodstuffs. However, high 
foreign exchange inflows combined with a 
policy of nominal depreciation of the soum, high credit growth under the government programs, large 
increases in public-sector wages and social benefits, and the recent wide spread between the official and 
market exchange rates, are together creating inflationary pressures.  Retail trade data indicate that actual 
inflation may be as high as 15 percent annually, twice the officially reported rate and similar to the 
International Monetary Fund‘s alternative CPI estimate.

D. Economic Prospects  

15. 
Overall growth is projected by the authorities to continue around 7-8 per cent annually 
during the strategy period, supported by commodity exports, domestic demand and 
investment.  The government has embarked upon a $47.3 billion, five-year (2011-15) Industrial 
Modernization and Infrastructure Development Program; of which almost $26 billion, or about 60 
percent is allocated to investments in oil and gas; over $5 billion, or about 11 percent to electricity; 
$2.6 billion, or roughly 6 percent each to chemicals and metallurgy; and the remaining 16 percent to 
construction materials, machine-building, textiles, transport, and other industries.  The program, 
comprising 519 large investment projects, aims to increase industry‘s share of GDP from 24 percent 
in 2010 to 28 percent in 2015. Sources of financing have already been identified for about $30 
billion, or 64 percent of the program, over two-thirds of which is expected to be funded by a 
combination of external loans and foreign direct investment (FDI), 25 percent by domestic 
investment and borrowing, and about 7 percent by the FRD.  In this connection, external financing 
has already been secured for large projects in chemicals, hydrocarbons, and textiles—from China, 
India, Korea, Russia and Turkey—and about 23 percent of the program‘s projects are under 
implementation.  While the program will not raise budget expenditures directly, it might increase 
public and publicly guaranteed external debt significantly, depending upon how much FDI can be 
mobilized.  

16. 
Trends in commodity prices will be an important determinant of economic outcomes 
and performance in the short- and medium-term.  Gold prices increased by about 26 percent on 
average in 2010, and are forecasted to increase by a further 16 percent in 2011, before trending down 
in 2012.6  Likewise, cotton prices are expected to remain much higher in 2011 -12 than in 2005-09.  
The price of natural gas exported to Russia, after increasing by two thirds  during 2008-09, is also 
projected to remain around its current level.  Moreover, Uzbekistan will soon start selling natural gas

to China, thus diversifying its export market. As for imports, the impact of recently increasing world 
food and energy prices is expected to be limited because Uzbekistan is essentially self-sufficient in 
both food grains and energy.

17. 
External debt is projected to increase gradually during the next few years.  The 
authorities‘ conservative foreign borrowing policy and favorable credit ratings provide ample room 
for additional borrowing in the medium term.7  Given their plans to finance the public investment 
program with foreign loans, external debt is expected to increase gradua lly from about 15 percent of 
GDP in 2010 to about 18 percent of GDP in 20158.  Domestic public debt is small.  Total domestic 
debt, including transactions between government accounts and the monetary sector, remains negative 
due to the accumulation of large fiscal savings at the central bank.  Existing external public and 
publicly guaranteed debt is being serviced fully and there are currently no arrears.   

E. Development Challenges and Opportunities 

18. 
To become a high middle-income country, Uzbekistan needs to continue to industrialize 
and expand domestic demand.  As other middle income economies in Asia and Eastern Europe 
start experiencing increases in relative factor prices, their industrial structure will shift from lower-
end labor-intensive manufacturing to higher value-adding manufacturing and associated knowledge 

7 Cf. ADB and IBRD positive creditworthiness assessments and the EIU‘s ―B‖ credit rating, which is comparable to Croatia, Indonesia and the 
Philippines. 
8 Both the IMF and the WB teams estimate that Uzbekistan debt at around 15 percent of GDP in 2010. However debt figures may be revised 
based on the GOU‘s recent official submission of debt statistics to DECDG for Global Development Finance report. According to this 
submission, Uzbekistan‘s external debt was estimated at around 19.6 percent of GDP in 2010.

services.  When the lower-end industries start migrating out of these countries, Uzbekistan may be 
able to capture a substantial share , thanks to its cheap and abundant labor, relatively high skilled 
work force, low cost utilities and infrastructure and relatively large domestic market.  Also, as one of 
the largest food producers in the region, some segments of its agriculture sector have potential to 
bring high growth and greater value added to the economy.  

19. 
Critical elements for the transformation are to 
increase the efficiency and 
competitiveness of its economy.  One of the critical issues for Uzbekistan‘s industrialization vision 
is to ensure that the country offers competitive factor prices, adequate services, and a hospitable 
investment climate.  Sound infrastructure to support agglomeration and cluster development of 
manufacturing industries could also help reduce external costs such as supply logistics and market 
accessibility to firms.  While existing labor costs and utility prices are competitive , Uzbekistan is one 
of the most energy inefficient countries in ECA: its consumption of energy per unit of GDP is three 
times the ECA average and of electricity per capita four times the CIS average.  While its transport 
infrastructure is adequately maintained, it still takes 93 days on average to import goods, due not only 
to its doubly-landlocked geography but also to outdated customs procedures and related governance 
issues.  As a result, Uzbekistan ranked 107 out of 155 countries for the customs-related sub-
component of the Bank Group‘s Logistics Performance Index (LPI).  Its tariff rates are high and there 
are other tariff-equivalent measures as well.  All these barriers make Uzbekistan‘s current trade 
regime one of the most restrictive in the ECA region .  However, the most recent (2009-10) Business 
Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) data indicates a gradually improving 
trend. 

20. 
Uzbekistan also needs a stronger financial sector so that it can support entrepreneurial 
activity.  Although financial intermediation measured by broad money to GDP has doubled—from 
10 percent in 2003 to 20 percent in 2010—it remains low for a country at this income level.  The 
authorities recently increased the capital of the largest banks to strengthen the long -term resource 
base for investment and to mitigate the consequences of the global economic and financial recession.  
However, significant amounts of national savings, public and private, are not channeled for economic 
development, due to weak financial intermediation.  Financing for private agricultural enterprises has 
also been limited, evidence of which includes the immediate oversubscription of agricultural credits 
by private farmers offered by a Bank-financed credit program. 

21. 
Diversification of sources of growth based on private demand is key.  Uzbekistan needs 
more private sector entrepreneurs. Its large firms are mainly state-owned enterprises even in non-
strategic, non-mining sectors. Their performance and accountability receive little public scrutiny; 
they remain major sources of inefficiency and rent-seeking; and they have stifled transfer of new 
technologies and innovation.  Uzbekistan has yet to see large-scale entry of new private enterprises or 
investment.  The share of small and medium-sized enterprises in GDP is officially estimated at about 
53 percent in 2010—up from an estimated 45 percent during the last decade; and its FDI stock per 
capita of $131 (2009)—one of the lowest within the CIS—is much less than the $1,023-$1,780 of the 
Caucasus countries, Russia, and Ukraine. In addition, small- and medium-sized private enterprises 
are not only agents of economic growth, but also of employment generation.   

22. 
Diversification of production towards higher value-added activities and sub-sectors is 
also important.  Compared to cotton, where state control over cropping patterns as well as input 
supply and output procurement remains substantial, horticulture can help private farmers move up the 
value chain and earn higher profit margins—in particular, in processing and exports.  In textiles, 
garment production adds much higher value than yarn and textiles and requires advanced skills for 
marketing and sales. It also creates a greater number of jobs as well as a wider spectrum of 

9 

 
 
   
 
 
professional opportunities. Similarly, Uzbekistan‘s natural gas resources could be monetized by 
transforming them into petro-chemicals.  

23. 
Uzbekistan’s social services—primary and secondary education, and primary health 
care—are well maintained.  According to government statistics, over 65 percent of public budgets 
are allocated to social services and are in line with international standards on a per capita basis.  
Uzbekistan‘s long-standing National Education Program has resulted in a satisfactory physical 
infrastructure, broad provisions of learning materials and equipment , a 100 percent primary 
enrollment ratio, and 99 per cent adult literacy.  Life expectancy at birth was 68 years in 2009, close 
to the world average and that of other regional CIS countries.  However, inter -regional differences 
are one of the remaining challenges. 

24. 
The growing population of young educated people will need employment.  Between 
2004-09, the working age population is estimated to have grown from 14.6 million to 16.8 million, 
while actual employment during the same period increased only from 9.9 million to 11.3 million (68 
percent and 67 percent of the working age population respectively).  Those who could not find 
employment at home, many from rural communities, migrated to find employment abroad. The 
number of Uzbek migrants in Russia and Kazakhstan is currently estimated at about 2 million, or 
about 12 percent of the country‘s working age population. While remittances, estimated at about $1.8 
billion or 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010, help low income families maintain a m inimal standard of 
living, more jobs need to be created within the country.  In addition, structural changes in th e 
economy will bring about changes in the nature of the skills development required in vocational and 
higher education.  

25. 
Improving governance will help enhance the effectiveness of industrial development. 
The authorities‘ large scale medium-term program for industrial modernization and associated 
infrastructure development relies predominantly on state-owned enterprises (SOEs).  The success of 
their SOE reform strategy will depend on SOEs‘ capacity for continuous change, leading to greater 
efficiency through the adoption of new technology, cooperation with foreign investors, and 
production of competitive products or public accountability for services.  To achieve this objective, 
much stronger and more transparent governance and accountability structures are needed.  

26. 
A final related challenge is the need to improve access to information on government 
policies and their outcomes, as well as on the living standards of the population.  Despite the 
existence of several formal institutions, public accountabil ity remains in practice limited.  Reasons 
for this include: the de facto dependence of the legislative and judicial branches of government on the 
executive; a  nascent mass media that remains essentially government controlled; a still nascent civil 
society. Moreover, the limited access and poor quality of key economic, financial, and social data 
impedes a detailed, realistic assessment of the country‘s economic policies and performance.  While 
the government has recently taken initial steps towards improving data transparency and information 
sharing (cf. Box 1), substantial improvements in the quality of national economic statistics and the 
dissemination of economic data through internationally recognized channels remain a high priority.  

F.  Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy  

27. 
Uzbekistan’s strategic long-term development goal is to become an industrialized, high 
middle-income country by mid-century.  The authorities‘ approach toward achieving this goal is to 
continue the gradual transition to a more market-oriented economy, to mitigate the potential negative 
consequences of external shocks, to ensure equitable distribution of growth across regions, and to 
maintain infrastructure and social services at an adequate level. Their long-term strategic 
development goal is clearly ambitious: it implies inter alia that the economy will need to grow at an 

10 

 
 
annual average rate of 8 percent for the next 20-30 years, with GDP per capita reaching about $6,500 
by 2030 and over $13,000 by 2040.  According to the 2008 Growth and Development study, only 13 
countries have been able to sustain this high level of growth for such an extended period. 9  The same 
study also emphasizes that the transformation of a low income economy to a middle or high income 
one requires significant structural changes.  

28. 
Against this background, the authorities’ medium-term growth and development 
strategy is reflected inter alia in: (a) the $47.3 billion, five-year Industrial Modernization and 
Infrastructure Development Program (2011-15); and (b) four recently issued presidential 
decrees.  The latter cover the financial sector, industrial development, infrastructure, transport and 
communications, and economic reforms.  These documents, together with President Karimov‘s 
statement at a government meeting to discuss 2010 outcomes and 2011 priorities, embody the 
following four cross-cutting development policy goals and priorities:  

 

 

 

 

to increase the efficiency of infrastructure, especially of energy, transport, and irrigation;  

to enhance the competitiveness of targeted, strategic industries, such as agro -processing, 
petrochemicals, and textiles;  

to diversify the economy, in particular to reduce its reliance on commodity exports; and 

to improve access to and the quality and outcomes of education, health and other social 
services, so that the benefits of overall growth are shared equitably by the entire 
population.  

29. 
These goals and priorities are important prerequisites for continuing and sustaining 
longer-term growth.  Their achievement, however, will ultimately depend on greater progress 
towards reducing the structural distortions inherent in Uzbekistan‘s gradualist, state -led development 
model and strategy.  As noted in the preceding analysis of the country‘s development challenges and 
opportunities (paras.18-26), these include the issues discussed in the following paragraphs. 

30. 
Industrial Development.  The authorities have identified several strategic industries as 
priority candidates for industrial development and they plan to provide large scale financing.  While 
certain industries are competitive, e.g. petrochemicals and higher-value added agro-processing, the 
comparative advantage of several others is less clear.  More detailed assessments of these industries 
may be needed to ensure that Uzbekistan‘s true comparative advantages are realized, given the 
rapidly changing global economy.   

31. 
Trade regime.  As part of the diversification agenda, various measures are planned to 
encourage exports by small and medium-sized enterprises—such as the establishment of an export 
promotion agency and the adoption of international quality standards.  The authorities have plans to 
gradually liberalize the trade regime—and to reduce transaction costs by streamlining customs 
procedures and reducing customs duties. But currently its trade regime remains one of the most 
restrictive in the ECA region 

32. 
Private sector.  As part of their competitiveness agenda, the authorities recognize the need to 
expand the private sector inter alia through protecting private property, reducing government 
controls, and minimizing the costs of doing business.  However, there is still no clear implementation

plan for enhancing the private sector‘s role in the economy.  In the absence of such a strategy and of 
much greater private sector development—including in agriculture, where liberalization of the state 
procurement system for cotton could increase incomes and unleash new opportunities for 
productivity growth in the rural economy—the authorities‘ competitiveness and diversification goals 
may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.    

33. 
Financial sector.  The authorities plan to implement various measures designed to further 
enhance the banking system and develop non-bank financial institutions.  However, restrictions on 
access to foreign exchange and to local currency in cash remain major obstacles in Uzbekistan‘s 
business environment and investment climate.  Until these constraints have been mitigated or 
removed, it may be difficult to attract the levels of investment required for the financing of the 
government‘s $47.3 billion industrial modernization and infrastructure improvement program, two 
thirds of which is supposed to be financed by foreign loans and foreign direct investment.   

34. 
Social equity and inclusion.  In health, the government‘s plans focus on achieving the 
MDGs and envision improvements in primary, emergency and specialized health care, preventive 
health measures, and a gradual transition to output-based financing.  In education, the objective is to 
maintain high literacy rates, move to 12 years of mandatory free education, and improve the quality 
of primary, secondary and tertiary education (e.g. a new higher education development program that 
envisions improving laboratory equipment, curricula, and professors‘ salaries), while maintaining 
universal access to basic education.  The authorities also envisage creation of millions of new jobs in 
small enterprises, mainly in rural areas, and in home -based businesses through labor contracting and 
improved provision of infrastructure and services.  They also highlight the importance of refocusing 
social assistance so that it targets the poor, but provide few details as to how this will be done. 

35. 
Governance and transparency. The authorities have issued decrees and made major 
statements which lay down principles for promoting the development of non-governmental 
organizations and assisting in the growth of the media.  However, these documents provide few 
details about how goals such as reducing legal restrictions on information disclosure are to be 
achieved. 

III. BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. Lessons Learned from previous CAS and Stakeholder Feedback 

36. 
The FY08-11 CAS Completion Report rated CAS program results and Bank Group 
performance as moderately satisfactory. 10  This outcome mirrored the country‘s moderately 
satisfactory progress towards its development goals.  Relatively strong performing areas included 
macroeconomic management, education, health, water supply and sanitat ion.  Relatively weak 
performing areas included agriculture, governance, transparency and financial and private sector 
development.  While the number of operations approved was in line with expectations in mid -2008, 
the total $533 million committed by end-FY11 was significantly higher.  This was partly because 
Uzbekistan utilized more of its IDA allocation than expected and partly due to the resumption of 
limited IBRD lending in FY11 as well as the addition of two new energy operations.  Analytical and 
advisory as well as technical assistance activities were implemented largely as planned, e xcept for 
poverty analysis and the private sector.  Portfolio performance remained moderately satisfactory.

37. 
IFC focused on strengthening the private sector through several advisory projects.  
These facilitated technical improvements in the business environment, supported financial sector 
development, and promoted private sector participation in infrastructure .  In addition, IFC invested 
$8 million in two financial sector projects, including a first equity investment in one of the country‘s 
few privately-owned banks.   

38. 
The FY08-11 CAS incorporated several lessons learned from the preceding interim 
strategy (ISN) and more broadly from the Bank Group’s experience in Uzbekistan since the 
early 2000s.  These included the following:  (a) despite the slow pace of structural reforms and 
diverging views of the Bank and the government in several areas, a solid engagement through 
investment projects can create effective entry points for policy dialogue; (b) IFC‘s long-standing and 
constructive relationship with the government through advisory projects has not yet translated into 
significantly increased direct investments, due to the difficult business environment and the 
government‘s active engagement in private sector operations; and (c) given the country‘s limited 
capacity for project implementation, renewed attention needs to be paid to generic issues, such as the 
country‘s public procurement process and project management. 

39. 
The outcomes recorded in the Completion Report have validated the accuracy and 
relevance of these lessons learned—especially as they relate to investment projects as entry points 
for encouraging structural reforms in some sectors where ESW engagement alone might be 
ineffective.  Given their systemic nature, they have continued to inform the design and content of the 
FY12-15 CPS.   In addition, four more detailed lessons emerge from experience since mid-2008:  
 
the quality, relevance, timeliness, and value of the Bank‘s economic analysis and policy 
advice—both macro and sector-specific—remain constrained by the limited availability 
and poor quality of official economic, financial and social data;  

 

 

 

the Bank‘s project cycle and the government‘s internal process for approving 
investment projects are still not well aligned, causing significant delays in credit or loan 
signing and effectiveness and thus in initial project implementation ; 

the failure to address fundamental policy differences during project design leads to poor 
portfolio performance. The credit for Energy Efficiency for Industrial Enterprises, 
approved in mid-2010 but which only became effective more than one year later, is the 
most recent example; and 

the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment and Trade‘s (MFRIT) 
procedures for contract expertise need to be streamlined.  In particular, its often 
protracted process for ‗price verification‘ of contracts awarded following competitive 
bidding continues to complicate and delay the procurement process and, ultimately, 
project implementation.   

Early government action to address and resolve these issues will be an important prerequisite for 
effective and efficient implementation of this CPS. 

40. 
Stakeholder consultations at the national and local level in March 2011 offered several 
important insights for the design and preparation of this CPS .  Consultations were held with 
central and local government officials as well as with representatives of the private sector and civil 
society (including women‘s groups).  Specific events included: meetings with key Ministers, both 
one-on-one and in groups; and meetings with local government officials and civil society groups and 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the private sector in the city of Tashkent and in the regions of Bukhara, Fergana, Kashkadarya, 
Navoi, and Samarkand and Karakalpakstan.  These consultations validated the importance of the goal 
of achieving growth with equity in Uzbekistan and provided support for the CPS four strategic 
objectives.  Not surprisingly, support for the competitiveness and diversification agenda was 
strongest among the private sector and local government officials , while support for increasing the 
efficiency of infrastructure, improving access to social services, and the CPS governance and 
transparency objectives was strongest among representatives of civil society.  Consultations at the 
sub-national level proved useful in providing an appreciation of the scope for tackling inter-regional 
disparities. 

B. Proposed Bank Group Strategy 

41. 
The CPS’ principal goal is to support implementation of the efficiency, competitiveness, 
diversification, and social equity elements of the government’s medium-term development 
strategy.  It will continue with the two-track approach employed under the previous CAS, i.e. full or 
limited engagement, depending on results achieved. In practice, CPS support for the result areas, 
where government and Bank Group views on sector-specific reforms and strategy broadly converge, 
will broaden and deepen the operational involvement and related policy dialogue already in place 
from the previous CAS. These programs, comprising full engagement, will thus maintain a high 
degree of continuity with the previous CAS. They include: (a) increasing the efficiency of 
infrastructure (energy, drainage, irrigation and water management, and, potentially, transport); and 
(b) human development and social inclusion (education, gender, health, poverty, and municipal 
services). Conversely, support for the government‘s industrial competitiveness and economic 
diversification agenda, where government and Bank Group perspectives differ, will be limited 
initially to analytical and advisory services and possibly technical assistance. Effective fulfillments of 
these agenda areas will require structural reforms related to trade, the financial sector, and the 
business regulatory environment as well as public sector management and institutions.  Whether or 
not these limited activities lead to more comprehensive, full engagement will depend upon the Bank 
assessment of government intentions and progress in the reform areas concerned.  Overall, the CPS‘ 
framework and the program outlined below reflect the reform priorities that emerged from last year‘s 
dialogue with the authorities on the outcome of Uzbekistan‘s 2009 country performance institutional 
assessment (CPIA).  They are also broadly aligned with the ECA region‘s three strategic pillars of 
competitiveness, inclusion, and climate change . 

42. 
A recently completed creditworthiness assessment reaffirmed Uzbekistan’s eligibility 
for IBRD lending.  However, since its GNI per capita income exceeded the IDA operational cutoff 
for the first time only in 2010, Uzbekistan will retain its access to IDA resources for the entire FY12-
15 CPS period, with no explicit timetable for graduation.  The creditworthiness assessment also 
recommended that the CPS focus on: (a) improved data transparency and reliability to enable the 
monitoring of credit risk; (b) measures to improve the business environment; and (c) reforms 
necessary to sustain high growth rates and diversify the economy away from a declining stocks of 
primary commodities. 

43. 
The focus on investment lending and its emphasis on improving the business 
environment and on data transparency is consistent with the creditworthiness assessment’s 
recommendations.  Planned lending is directed primarily towards investments and related reforms 
designed to increase the efficiency of infrastructure, to diversify the economy, especially agriculture, 
and to promote social inclusion and human capital development—all necessary conditions to sustain 
high rates of sustainable growth.  Likewise, non-lending activities will focus on measures to improve 
the business environment and investment climate, to promote private sector development, and to 

14 

 
 
 
strengthen institutions for competitiveness, including continued progress in public information 
disclosure and data transparency.  

44. 
The provisional IBRD/IDA lending program comprises sixteen operations over the four 
years FY12-15.  Eleven would support reforms and investments for achieving sustainable growth 
and reducing reliance on primary commodities directly, including more efficient energy use and 
diversification of exports.  The total financial envelope with be $1,350 million11, comprising $710 
million IBRD and $640 million IDA, of which $540 million is the amount available to Uzbekistan 
during FY12-14 under IDA-16.12  Although much larger than the original IDA-only allocation in the 
previous CAS, this IBRD/IDA $325 million annual average would be in line with the actual outcome 
in FY11.  Two operations—for Advanced Electricity Metering and Alat-Karakul Water Supply—are 
at an advanced stage of preparation for delivery in FY12.   

45. 
Besides new lending, the existing, recently expanded portfolio of investment projects 
will support the infrastructure efficiency and social equity elements of the government’s 
strategy.  Six of ten investment projects totaling $433 million, or 68 percent of the current $634.7 
million portfolio, were approved during the last two years (FY10-11), including four for education, 
health, and municipal services.  Given the ir significance in terms of direct support for 
implementation of sector-specific reforms in these areas, management and supervision of these 
operations will be an important component of the program, especially during the first two years. 

46. 
Proposed analytical and advisory engagement would cover all four elements of the 
government’s growth and development strategy.  Thus, in addition to project-related analytical 
and advisory services and technical assistance in the infrastructure efficiency and human 
development result areas, the provisional summary of analytical and advisory services includes a 
proposed joint strategy report—―Uzbekistan Vision 2030‖—that would lay out roadmaps to achieve 
selected key development goals. These goals include industrial development, the competitiveness and 
diversification agenda, as well as a series of policy notes designed to address comparative advantage 
and structural reform issues in specific industries selected by the government.  In line with other 
similar ongoing exercises, such as ―China Vision 2030‖ , particular attention will be paid to 
collaborative or joint analytical work with relevant Uzbek think tanks, with an emphasis—in addition 
to the planned vision report—on providing ‗just in time‘ policy advice and technical assistance to 
maximize the impact of analytical and advisory program.   

47. 
Building upon the positive results achieved during the previous CAS, sector policy 
dialogue will address strategic issues and provide deeper analytical underpinning for planned 
lending operations.  For the efficiency agenda, a water utility note will addre ss sector-wide 
effectiveness and institutional issues, based on the preliminary findings of a recently completed 
fiduciary review, and provide the policy framework for proposed water supply and sanitation 
investment lending.  In addition, a planned energy sector strategy review will analyze efficiency 
issues in a holistic manner as background for preparation of a proposed downstream electricity 
distribution project.  As regards the diversification agenda, a horticultural sector study will explore 
practical options for developing higher value-added agriculture activities as the basis for preparation 

11 Overall lending amounts will depend on the IBRD's lending capacity and demand by other borrowers as well as   Government demand and 
performance in the course of the CPS period. 
12 Depending upon its continued IDA eligibility, Uzbekistan‘s IDA-17 allocation is expected to be at least as much as under IDA-16, subject 
however to the total IDA resources available, the country‘s CPIA rating, the total number of IDA-eligible countries, the performance and 
assistance terms of these other IDA-eligible countries, and the terms of IDA‘s assistance, which are determined annually and based on the risk 
of debt distress.  IDA allocations are denominated in SDRs, with the US dollar equivalent dependent on the prevailing exchang e rate.

of a horticultural operation.  A series of technical engagements in the financial and private 
sectors―innovation, quality infrastructure, information and communications technology, mortgage 
finance, and new business registration―have resulted in a proposed program of private sector 
development policy notes and a proposed credit access operation.  However, the pace and scope of 
these analytical and advisory services will ultimately be determined by the government‘s own 
agenda, priorities, and political will. 

48. 
Uzbekistan is a relatively small recipient of Bank Group-managed trust funds, with a 
$3.8 million portfolio and disbursements averaging about $800,000 annually.  Well integrated 
into the country program, trust fund financing has proven especially instrumental in:  (a) expanding 
the Bank Group‘s ability to provide advisory services; and (b) piloting activities for eventual 
mainstreaming (e.g. the Karakalpakstan silk development pilot, global partnership on output-based 
aid, and energy efficiency strategy for manufacturing).  Additional trust fund resources for similar 
advisory services and pilot activities will be sought during the CPS period, although the main focus 
will be on implementation of the nine existing activities. 

49. 
The strategy is consistent with regional strategies and programs for Central Asia.  The 
Bank Group contributes to the sound management of water resources for both irrigation and power 
generation in Central Asia at the regional and country levels.  As part of its regional approach, the 
Bank has initiated a comprehensive Central Asia Energy-Water Development Program (CAEWDP), 
which aims to improve diagnostic and analytical tools to help the countries in the region manage their 
water and energy resources, strengthen regional institutions, and stimulate investments, in 
coordination with other development partners.  It includes assessments of Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-
Pakistan regional electricity trade and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) 
funded work on a Regional Energy Markets Assistance Program.  The Bank also works together with 
German International Cooperation (GIZ) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
(UNECE) on institutional strengthening of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS).   

50. 
IFC will maintain its focus on private sector development through a combined 
investment and advisory approach.  It will seek opportunities in the following priority areas: (a) 
direct investments in the real sectors, such as general manufacturing, services, and agribusiness; (b) 
strengthening privately owned banks; and (c) encouraging public -private partnerships, especially in 
infrastructure.  Through financial sector intermediaries, IFC will provide credit lines for small and 
medium sized enterprises to support job creation and diversification of the economy and will try to 
extend trade finance lines, a relatively new product, to facilitate private sector trade flows.  On-
lending by banks to SMEs will be enhanced by the financial infrastructure advisory project to further 
develop credit information sharing systems and facilitate the introduction of risk management 
certification as well as develop modern collateral registry jointly with the World Bank. Real sector 
investments may include projects with international joint ventures, especially in export -oriented 
projects, as well as projects that introduce modern technologies and increase domestic value -added.  
Infrastructure advisory work will continue. 

C. Expected Results and Program of Lending and Analytical and Advisory Activities 

Result Area 1:  Increasing the efficiency of infrastructure 

51. 
Activities in this result area will support sustainable growth through increased 
efficiency of energy, transport, and water resources management—in line with the 2010 
Presidential Decree (1446) on Acceleration of Development in Infrastructure, Transport and 

16 

 
    
 
 
 
Communications Construction. In addition to completion of three ongoing operations—Enterprise 
Energy Efficiency phase I, Talimarjan Transmission, and Ferghana Valley Water Resources 
Management-Phase 1—the Bank plans to initiate new lending and associated analytical activities in 
electricity metering and distribution, in transport, and in water resources management.  IFC‘s PPP 
work in infrastructure would also contribute to these government objectives. 

1.1 Sustainable infrastructure development 

52. 
Despite being one of only two double landlocked countries in the world, Uzbekistan’s 
strategic location between Asia and Europe makes it a key transit point for Central Asia.  The 
transport sector‘s performance and contribution to the government ‘s efficiency, competitiveness and 
diversification agenda is therefore an important component of its medium -term development strategy.  
Using international standards and practices, the government has initiated a series of measures aimed 
at improving the efficiency of transport operations and services while reducing costs and 
environmental footprint.  Bank engagement—a proposed transport assessment (FY12-13) followed 
by a potential transport lending operation (FY15)—will be targeted towards improving the country‘s 
links with the global market place, increasing the efficiency of various transport modes, preserving 
the value of existing assets, and upgrading civil works and construction management practices to 
international standards.  These activities will also address the transport system‘s environmental 
footprint and safety dimensions and, through seminars and the proposed transport assessment, 
knowledge sharing about international good practice. 

1.2  

Improving water resources management and climate change preparedness 

53. 
Activities in this area will continue to focus on development of sustainable water 
management systems for irrigation and addressing associated land quality and drainage 
problems.  With more than 85 percent of Uzbekistan‘s cropland dependent upon irrigation, in turn 
comprising about 10 percent the country‘s total land area, the availability of water and its efficient 
and sustainable use is arguably one of the country‘s most important development challenges.  Bank 
support to upgrade and improve the efficiency of the irrigation and drainage network in selected 
districts will continue through two ongoing projects—Rural Enterprise Support Project (RESP) II 
and Ferghana Valley Water Resource Management-Phase I—and in FY13 a proposed South 
Karakalpakstan Drainage Project in northwest Uzbekistan, one of the country‘s poorest regions.   

54. 
At the regional level, activities will continue to support ongoing Bank Group regional 
initiatives, such as the Central Asia Energy-Water Development Program (CAREC), CAREC‘s 
Energy Sector Coordinating Committee work program13, and the International Fund for Saving the 
Aral Sea (IFAS).  These activities include the following:  (a) an ongoing Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-
Pakistan (UAP) electricity supply and trade study to assess the potential for regional electricity trade 
and, more broadly, regional integration of electricity markets in Central and South Asia; (b) 
strengthening mathematical modeling of water management in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river 
basins under the ongoing CAREC work program; (c) strengthening Central Asia‘s weather, water, 
and climate services through the recently approved Central Asia Hydrometeorology Modernization 
Project (CAHMP); and (d) technical assistance and capacity building in water and energy resources 
management. Under these programs, opportunities exist to leverage Uzbekistan objectives and 
regional funding for both energy and transport infrastructure and water resources management. 

13 As approved at the November 2009 CAREC Ministerial Meeting. 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
Result Area 2: Enhancing the economy’s competitiveness 

55. 
Activities in this result area aim to support government priorities for enhancing the 
economy’s competitiveness.  Since this will require significant reforms to reduce the structural 
distortions inherent in the government‘s development strategy, broadening and deepening the policy 
dialogue with the authorities will not only be a significant challenge, but also a prerequisite for 
meaningful CPS engagement in this area.  Thus, unlike Result Area 1, where existing and planned 
investment lending accounts for a large share of targeted outcomes, analytical and advisory activities 
will be the main instruments for Bank engagement.  Two areas are envisaged: (a) strengthening 
institutions and macroeconomic environment; and (b) enhancing the competitiveness of strategic 
industries and promoting exports. 

2.1 Strengthening institutions and macroeconomic environment  

56. 
The key instrument for the competitiveness agenda would be a joint strategy report 
“Uzbek Vision 2030”.  This will be carried out early in the CPS period at the request of the 
government.  The report will analyze the potential sources of high and sustained growth that could be 
exploited as it moves towards a more competitive, diversified economy.  Policy recommendations 
will aim to maximize the potential of the economy to maintain real GDP growth and generate more 
jobs, focusing on macroeconomic management, international trade policy, th e business environment 
and enterprise reform, and labor market policies. The report will be supported by regular 
macroeconomic policy dialogue, in conjunction with the IMF. 

2.2 Enhancing the competitiveness of strategic industries and promoting exports 

57. 
The government plans to promote export-oriented strategic industries as defined in the 
Presidential Decree (1442) on "Priorities for Industrial Development, 2011-2015‖. Although views 
between the Bank and the Government differ on how to reach this important objective, the Bank will 
develop a series of policy notes on the competitiveness or otherwise of selected industries, designed 
to provide the government and other stakeholders with a diagnostic analysis, including the constraints 
impacting a particular industry‘s competitiveness and suggest a roadmap for policy actions.  IFC will 
seek to promote selected export-oriented industries by partnering with foreign investors planning to 
set up joint ventures in Uzbekistan. 

58. 
Uzbekistan has made export diversification—particularly into production of higher 
quality goods—and technological upgrading a main priority of its development strategy.  
Upgrading the national quality infrastructure, which includes standardization, accreditation, 
certification and metrology, is a central part of this strategy.  A modern and internationally 
harmonized national quality infrastructure (NQI) will give Uzbek firms the tools to surmount existing 
barriers to quality production and exports, and benefit from foreign technolog ies embedded in 
standards and in modern testing, measurement and certification procedures.  In FY12, the Bank will 
continue to work closely with Uzstandard and relevant ministries to identify areas for technical 
assistance. It would eventually lead to greater contributions by the private sector to the export 
diversification while existing state-owned enterprises will continue to make a fair share of 
contributions until the private sector in the country develops to a larger extent. 

59. 
The CPS will also provide support for initiatives by the Ministry of Economy (MOE) 
and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment and Trade (MFERIT) to promote 
exports.  Proposed technical assistance will support the development of policies and programs 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
designed to promote an export-oriented economy, taking into account the lessons of international 
experience from Eastern Europe, East Asia and elsewhere.  Specific areas will include the design and 
scaling-up of financial instruments to promote exports (trade finance, guarantees, credit lines for 
SMEs), carrying out an export process mapping to reduce the number, time and costs of export 
procedures, and contributing to the planned development and implementation of a ―one-stop-shop‖.  
IFC‘s direct lending to the real sector as well as on-lending to SMEs and trade finance lines through 
the financial intermediaries will also contribute to these objectives.   

Result Area 3: Diversifying the economy 

60. 
In support of the government’s objective to diversify the country’s sources of growth, 
the CPS will help provide a comprehensive platform of assistance to support enterprise reform 
and modernization.  Targeted areas of support include: business environment reforms; accelerating 
innovation and ICT development; and upgrading of the country‘s national quality infrastructure.  In 
addition, the CPS will support selected value chains in agriculture and livestock by continuing to 
provide financing opportunities with particular focus on non-cotton related activities. In addition, it 
will support the formulation of a horticultural strategy (FY13), paving the way for a possible 
horticultural project (FY14). 

3.1  

Strengthening the foundations for private sector-led diversification 

61. 
The Bank Group will continue policy dialogue on private sector development, the 
business environment and the investment climate .  Through an investment climate reform 
advisory task, the Bank will assist in further developing an institutional and regulatory framework 
conducive to encouraging private sector-led diversification.  The strategy objective is to develop a 
strategic engagement that can offer concrete recommendations and assistance for reforms that are 
implementable and that ultimately result in an improved business environment.  In addition, the Bank 
Group will support private sector development in rural areas by scal ing up activities under the 
ongoing RESP II.  Following completion of its long-standing broad-based investment climate and 
business environment advisory work, IFC will contribute to private-sector led diversification through 
new forms of advisory projects more narrowly focused on the PPP agenda and financial 
infrastructure, as well as through possible direct investments in priority sectors. 

62. 
Given the government's intent to attract increased FDI, and while the availability of 
political risk insurance for investments into Uzbekistan is still limited, there is a demand for 
MIGA's products. Sectors potentially suitable for expanded MIGA engagement in the course of 
CPS implementation are energy (oil and gas production and transportation) as well as foreign 
investment in health sector PPPs. 

63. 
Uzbekistan’s banks continue to face challenges in meeting the needs of small and 
medium-sized enterprises. In addition to the ongoing RESP-II, which improves access to credit by 
small- and medium-sized agricultural enterprises, the Bank plans to prepare a possible microfinance 
operation towards the end of the CPS period.  To support reforms in the area of financial access, the 
CPS will also provide targeted technical assistance to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) to help 
improve a secured transaction system and increase the efficiency of credit information sharing in 
accordance with international good practices.  IFC will continue supporting the privately-owned 
segment of the banking sector with targeted lending for SMEs and explore opportunities for 
providing trade finance to private companies.   

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2  Diversifying agriculture 

64. 
Agriculture is the sector where efforts to diversify output and exports could produce 
results in the medium-term.  Agriculture accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, 15 percent of 
export revenues, and still over one-third of employment.  CPS interventions will focus on two key 
challenges: (a) diversifying agriculture away from cotton and wheat into other high value crops such 
as fruit and vegetables, as well as livestock; and (b) intensifying agricultural yields and productivity.  
These will be supported by additional financing for the credit-line component of RESP II, with a 
focus on crops other than cotton, as well as analytical and advisory activities to develop a horticulture 
strategy that would pave the way for preparation of a horticulture project.  These activities will also 
help further develop Uzbekistan‘s domestic market and encourage a gradual shift from the cotton 
state order system and public intervention towards a more liberal and diversified agricultural sector.  

Result Area 4: Improving access to, and outcomes of social services 

65. 
This result area will support the government’s objective to reduce regional and rural-
urban inequities through promoting social inclusion and human capital development.  To this 
end, the Bank would initially address the following government requests through recently approved 
lending (under the previous CAS) and studies:  (a) improving the quality, and equitable access to 
early childhood education and basic education services; (b) providing more accessible quality and 
sustainable health services, especially in the rural areas, (c) continuing to improve the coverage and 
sustainability of potable water supply and sanitation services, and (d) improving the social protection 
system, especially the targeting of assistance to the most vulnerable groups . 

4.1  
Strengthening the quality of health and education and improving access to early 
childhood development 

66. 
CPS support for health will comprise a combination of investment operations, technical 
assistance, and related analytical and advisory services to extend and deepen ongoing reforms.  
Thus, CPS activities will focus on secondary care, medical education, drug policies and 
implementation of a multi-sectoral public health strategy.  Technical assistance and analytical work 
on the role of the private sector and output-based financing will continue throughout the CPS period.   

67. 
CPS support for education will continue improvements in the quality of basic education 
and tackle access to and the demand for pre-school education.  The ongoing second Basic 
Education Project supports efforts to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning through: (a) 
targeted interventions in selected general secondary education schools and preschools in rural poor 
areas; (b) development of institutional capacity to assess student learning; and (c) adoption of 
predictable and transparent school budgets nation-wide.  Pre-school coverage is only 16-20 percent 
and parenting programs are negligible.  Through a proposed Early Childhood Education project, the 
CPS will include more flexible provision of preschools to increase enrollment, address parental 
perceptions of the importance of preschool education especially in rural areas, and carry out 
interventions that would increase the demand for pre-schooling. 

4.2  Water Supply and Sanitation 

68. 
Rehabilitating and expanding the country’s water supply and sanitation infrastructure 
remains a top government priority.  In addition to the utilities‘ substantial investment and capacity 
needs in both urban and rural areas, a major challenge is to optimize their roles and capacities for 
developing and implementing a more effective and sustainable water strategy.  This entails matching 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
financing mechanisms to sector priorities and strengthening its regulation and governance towards 
achieving higher efficiency and sustainability of public expenditure, while leveraging better 
management and performance of operators.  CPS support will include ongoing work designed to 
strengthen water sector governance and capacity. This will include studies on financial and 
institutional aspects of water supply and sanitation and integrated management of water resources.  It 
will also include lending for water supply (Alat-Karakul) and sewerage (Karakalpakstan)—with the 
latter to be integrated into two larger programmatic operations (Water & Sanitation Sector 
Investment Projects 1 & 2) that would establish rules of project engagement, give the government 
greater planning flexibility, and, at the same time, create accountability for quality of feasibility 
studies, project design, preparation, and outcomes. The indicative program also involves technical 
assistance for institutional capacity building and identification of potential sector reforms. 

69. 
CPS support is also envisaged for integrated urban development projects in major 
cities.  Municipalities suffer from a backlog of infrastructure investments, weaknesses in service 
provision, and inadequate or non-existent town development plans or strategies.  Diversifying from 
the exclusive focus on water supply and sanitation, these integrated projects will address various 
municipal investment needs, including solid waste management, infrastructure including roads, 
public heating, information and communications technology (ICT), electricity, community-based 
heritage protection and tourism promotion.  A first project is tentatively planned for FY15.  The CPS 
also provides for a municipal services sector review. 

4.3  

Promoting social inclusion 

70. 
Uzbekistan’s mahallah (community-based) social protection system is designed to 
benefit poor families.  Over the years, however, targeting efficiency has weakened due to different 
patterns of economic development, such as the increasing role of informal sector earnings and 
remittances, and the delegation of additional responsibilities to the mahalla administration.  Building 
on the achievements of the existing system, the Bank Group will help address these emerging 
challenges by introducing efficiency enhancing innovations (e.g. an electronic registry of 
beneficiaries, and proxy-means based identification criteria.).  These activities will support evolving 
reforms aimed at effective implementation and results monitoring of these and other social protection 
policies and programs, as well as the management of the system as a whole.  They will also allow for 
up-to-date information on the ability of the existing social protection system to identify and target the 
poor and for quick remedial interventions.  Meanwhile, the Civil Society Development Fund 
managed by the Bank Group‘s Country Office in Tashkent awards 7-9 small grants annually for 
social empowerment and inclusion projects implemented by civil society organizations. 

Cross Cutting Result Area: Governance 

71. 
Given the country’s challenging governance and transparency environment, the CPS 
will broaden and deepen the focus on these two areas started under the last CAS.  First, it will 
continue support for development of Uzbekistan‘s public finance management system, based on 
international best practice and public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA)-type 
benchmarks. 
 Specifically, following the recently completed Country Integrated Fiduciary 
Assessment (CIFA), a full PEFA assessment will be undertaken in FY12.  Second, building upon the 
2009 governance assessment of primary health care services and the operational work under ongoing 
water supply and sewerage operations, the CPS will include activities designed to improve the 
governance, management, and performance of sector and project institutions, especially in water 
supply and sewerage and energy.  Third, the CPS will continue policy dialogue and technical 
assistance aimed at improving public access to, and the quality of basic economic, financial, and 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
  
social data.  In this context, a recently approved $40,000 project financed under the ‗Demand for 
Good Governance‘ window of the Development Grant Facility (DGF) aims to improve public 
oversight of government- as well as Bank Group- financed projects in Uzbekistan through creation of 
a countrywide monitoring and evaluation network of civil society organizations (CSOs).  
Benchmarks for progress in data transparency include: improved accounting and reporting systems; 
increased financial data disclosure; an operating external audit function, with adequate human 
capacity and using international standards; and improved internal controls and effective internal audit 
functions across key budget organizations. 

D. 

Implementing the Country Partnership Strategy 

72. 
Inherent in the two-track, full or limited engagement approach successfully employed 
under the previous CAS is the continued need for flexibility in both program design and 
implementation.  There are two main reasons for this.  First, although Uzbekistan has weathered the 
global recession better than most countries, the still uncertain pace and scope of the global 
economy‘s recovery may impact its key commodity exports and thus its medium -term growth 
prospects.  Second, while the authorities appear committed to the goals of their competitiveness and 
diversification agenda, whether there is commensurate political will for the difficult structural 
reforms required remains unclear.  Thus, the lending program outlined above, in Annexes 3 and 4 
and B3, and the summary of non-lending services listed in Annex B4, are both illustrative and subject 
to potentially significant change, especially in the second half of the period (FY14-15).   

73. 
Thus, the CPS program will be reviewed annually and adapted as may be needed to 
ensure its continued consistency with the authorities’ medium-term development strategy.  A 
CPS Progress Report in FY14 will assess the CPS‘ strategic direction, based on results agreed with 
the government and reflected in the results matrix.  Meanwhile, in addition to routine implementation 
support and supervision of individual operations, the annual country portfolio performance review 
(CPPR) process will be resumed, focusing jointly with the government on ongoing or emerging 
systemic issues.  Mid-term reviews of project implementation will assess any needs for restructuring 
to align project development objectives with ongoing CPS priorities, to enhance linkages to 
analytical and advisory services, and to implement monitoring and evaluation systems to monitor 
outcomes.  Most attention will be given to the six relatively new operations that are likely to have the 
greatest impact on the strategy outcomes.  

74. 
Given the recent and anticipated increase in the size of the portfolio, implementation 
support will be enhanced, in particular for procurement management.  As noted earlier, 
dialogue is already underway with the authorities with the aim to streamline MFERIT‘s contract 
expertise process.   If contract registration is not completed within an internationally accepted period, 
the Bank will apply its new (January 2011) Guidelines for Procurement and declare mis-
procurement, as appropriate.  In addition, procurement staff in the Bank Group‘s Coun try Office in 
Tashkent is being strengthened.  Meanwhile, the authorities, specifically the COM, have already 
established enhanced monitoring procedures for implementation of Bank Group-financed projects.     

75. 
The CPS program is consistent with the Bank’s Gender Strategy and Gender Action 
Plan (GAP) and seeks to promote analysis and ultimately operational activities focusing on 
women’s economic empowerment.  The GAP also emphasizes the demand side of the gender 
equation by promoting closer operational collaboration with clients as well as expanding their 
capacity to design, implement and monitor gender-sensitive policies and programs.  The CPS will 
address gender issues through existing and proposed new operations, capacity building, and by 

22 

 
 
 
 
including gender-disaggregated data in project monitoring and evaluation systems.  Box 3 below 
outlines the five main activities that make up the gender strategy. 

Box 3:  CPS Gender Strategy 
 Project interventions—For new projects, a gender expert will develop project-specific interventions, if 
analysis during social assessment indicates that the project is suitable for addressing gender issues.  For 
ongoing projects, incremental interventions designed to strengthen their gender focus will include the 
following: 
o RESP-II will include additional focus on female farmers‘ participation in project -sponsored 
trainings (if necessary, by means of a quota); 
o RESP-II, Drainage, and Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management will seek to involve 
more women in the WUA decision-making process; 
o Basic Education—the teachers‘ training component will include additional efforts to promote 
gender sensitivity; 
o Talimarjan Transmission—based on an ADB-sponsored gender assessment and plan of action, the 
project will include gender-specific activities. 
 Capacity building—to help improve Bank staff and government officials‘ understanding of and sensitivity 
to gender issues, team members of the 2011 ECA Gender Assessment and 2012 WDR on Gender Equality 
and Development will be invited to make presentations in the Country Office in Tashkent. In addition, 
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff will be encouraged to arrange training in gender issues by gender 
experts. 
 CPS Progress Report—the FY14 CPS mid-term review and Progress Report will seek to provide gender -
disaggregated data on all relevant ongoing and proposed operations. 
 CPS Monitoring & Evaluation—during implementation, a simple CPS monitoring and evaluation system 
will be developed to capture and analyze the gender impact of Bank Group activities. 
 Development partner coordination—during CPS implementation, the Bank Group will seek to 
coordinate and ultimately main-stream its gender-related activities with other development partners, 
especially the ADB, UNDP and UNICEF. 

E. Partnerships and Donor Coordination  

76. 
Overall, official development assistance (ODA) to Uzbekistan, never very large, remains 
limited.  Except for ADB, the multilateral institutions‘ exposure (including that of the Bank Group) 
is very modest and there are only a few bilateral and even fewer non-governmental agencies engaged, 
mainly in technical assistance.  Consequently, conventional donor or development partner 
coordination and the Bank‘s role are not major issues and, except for the United Nations Country 
Team coordinated by UNDP in which the Bank participates, there is no formal donor -government 
coordinating body or framework.  Annex 4 summarizes key development partner activities by sector 
and thematic area. 

77. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan’s outreach to new and re-emerging development and trade 
partners in recent years has produced results.  For example, investments in industry and 
infrastructure by China, Korea, and Russia among others have become important factors in the 
government‘s growth and development strategy.  Moreover, the effectiveness and especially the 
fiscal impact of these investments in terms of medium- and longer-term operating and maintenance 
costs will need increasingly to be taken into account.  In this latter connection, the Bank continues to 
work closely with the IMF on issues related to macroeconomic stability and economic management.  
At the same time, the IMF continues to provide technical assistance on improving the quality of 
national statistics and data transparency.   

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
F. Monitoring and Evaluation   

78. 
Expected outcomes of the CPS are expressed in the attached results framework 
attached at Annex 1.  Based on discussions with the government and consultations with other 
stakeholders, it is organized around the CPS‘ four strategic objectives as well as the governance 
cross-cutting thematic result area.  These objectives are then disaggregated into fourteen specific 
outcomes that the Bank Group expects to influence through the CPS as well as a larger se t of 
intermediate outcomes or milestones that will be used to track progress periodically.  The framework 
also identifies the CPS lending, advisory and analytical, and technical assistance interventions that 
are intended to contribute towards the achievement of CPS outcomes.  

79. While the results framework is designed to monitor progress and mea sure outcomes, its 
application is intended to be flexible .  It provides an initial sense of strategic direction for Bank 
Group assistance, but should be thought of as being open for change if evolving government 
priorities or external developments so warrant.  Similarly, the mapping of planned financial and 
analytical activities by strategic theme (Annex 4) is intended to be flexible, especially for the outer 
years.  For example, the detailed scope of activities related to the planned joint strategy report and 
ongoing poverty monitoring will be determined annually in consultation with the government. 
Overall monitoring will be annual: for macroeconomic and related outcomes, data will be obtained 
from the key economic ministries; for sectoral outcomes, through project supervision missions.  
These data will feed into a CPS Progress Report scheduled for FY14 and a CPS Completion Report 
scheduled for FY15. 

IV. MANAGING RISKS 

80. 
The CPS entails risks to its implementation which will need to be mitigated and/or 
carefully managed.  Consistent with past experience, the proposed approach, based on proactive risk 
management, includes three elements: warning signals—to detect problems at the earliest possible 
stage; initial responses—to mitigate their immediate impact; and risk reduction measures—to 
gradually reduce their likelihood and potential impact over time. 

A. Country Risks 

81. While the country’s economic, political and social environment is currently stable, CPS 
implementation could be affected by a combination of factors.  Regionally, these include 
possibly: deteriorating security conditions due to the situation in Afghanistan , and increasing tensions 
between Uzbekistan and its neighbors over regional issues—especially the management and use of 
trans-boundary energy and water resources. Several Bank Group activities, especially its Central Asia 
Energy and Water Development Program (CAEWDP), as well as focused efforts on transparency and 
sharing of information about the ongoing assessment studies for the proposed Rogun hydropower 
project, are intended to help mitigate this risk. Domestically, they include possible economic and 
social instability due inter alia to continued levels of inequality—already a stated government 
concern—exacerbated by weak public accountability and by civil society‘s limited participation in 
economic and social policy dialogue. These domestic risks will be monitored continuously, as well as 
in the context of the next nation-wide elections.  Since these risks are in areas beyond the Bank 
Group‘s mandate, staff will liaise with key bilateral agencies as well as the UN Specialized Agencies 
to monitor political and security developments, and to assess their possible impact.  The initial 
response to any country-wide deterioration of stability would be incremental, targeted scaling-down 

24 

 
 
 
of activities.  The initial response to any localized deterioration would be suspension of activities in 
that locality.  

B. External Shocks 

82. 
Although Uzbekistan’s economy proved more resilient than most others during the 
2008-09 global recession, it remains vulnerable to external shocks affecting commodity prices 
and remittances.  The Bank Group will therefore continue to monitor regional economic 
developments and, in the event of adverse events, be prepared to adjust the scope and focus of the 
program as needed.  In addition, the government‘s agenda to increase competitiveness and promote 
increased productivity and diversification—as well as CPS program support in these areas—
addresses this risk. The Bank Group will also monitor the country‘s vulnerability to national 
disasters, given its location in a relatively high risk area according to recent assessments. 

C. Risks to World Bank Group 

83. 
The main risk to CPS implementation is the significant political commitment required 
to confront bottlenecks currently blocking the efficient functioning of the economy and private 
sector development.  If this risk materialized, it would have negative implications for planned CPS 
outcomes in these areas, including IFC‘s ability to carry out direct investment in the private sector 
and, more generally, for planned CPS outcomes in these areas.  In addition to working closely with 
other development partners and stakeholders to continuously assess policy reforms supported under 
specific projects, the Bank Group will also closely monitor CPS implementation.  In case of adverse 
developments in overall policies, projects, or reforms, the Bank will adjust its engagement, for 
example by placing more emphasis on non-lending services in areas where reforms may have stalled.  
These mitigation measures could include the provision of hands-on support to address capacity issues 
through (e.g.) technical assistance, if requested, as well as maintaining policy dialogue with the 
authorities. 

84. 
A second risk relates to the lack of detailed and reliable economic , financial and social 
data. This impedes the assessment of economic performance and social outcomes, hinders the 
preparation of economic projections, and undermines the credibility, relevance, and timeliness of 
Bank Group policy advice.  Specifically, the proposed Uzbekistan Vision 2030 exercise as well as 
the analytical work needed to underpin the lending program will not be possible without better access 
to standard economic datasets (e.g. disaggregated national accounts, fiscal and monetary accounts, 
investments, etc.), improved information about government policies, and raw data on living standards 
(e.g. poverty, household budget surveys).  In partnership with other development partners and 
particularly with the IMF, Bank Group staff will continue to work with the authorities on 
strengthening statistical institutions and on information disclosure , including on publication of data in 
the GFS and IFS in line with the government‘s commitments.  Specifically, they will closely monitor 
implementation of COM Resolution 2629 of April 4, 2011, which authorized the initiation of 
preparatory work to publish economic data in the IMF‘s databases (cf. Box 1).  

85. 
A third fiduciary and governance risk relates to implementation delays and the use of 
Bank Group resources.  This includes the potential for mis-procurement as a result of the 
authorities‘ price verification process.  The Bank Group will continue to closely monitor fiduciary 
aspects of project implementation through regular reviews and external audits.  It will also keep track 
of delays due to the authorities‘ project expertise and price verification system.  Its response in the 
event of continuing systemic delays in procurement will be to adjust the scope of its assistance 
program until a resolution is reached.  As for risk reduction, the Bank Group will continue its support 

25 

 
 
 
for government efforts to improve governance and, in particular, to strengthen procurement and 
financial management capacity under the CPS‘ second result area.   Dialogue between MFERIT, the 
Ministry of Economy, and the Bank will be maintained on the issue of project expertise price 
verification. In addition, the CPS will continue to identify and support demand-side governance 
interventions (as part of the proposed lending activities) to promote accountability to citizens.

Executive Summary 

Background  

i. 

The FY08-11 CAS marked the return to a standard assistance framework for Uzbekistan 
following the FY06-07 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) which, owing to concerns about development 
effectiveness and the country‘s governance, focused on technical assistance and minimal IDA lending for 
global public goods and social services.  Reflecting slowly improving Bank-client relations and the need 
to calibrate different levels of activity to different degrees of government commitment, the CAS adopted a 
flexible, two-track approach, defined as: full engagement, i.e. lending, analytical and advisory services, 
and technical assistance, in policy areas and/or sectors of common agreement ; and limited engagement, 
i.e. analytical and advisory services and/or technical assistance in areas where there was no, or incomplete 
consensus.  The IDA15 allocation was expected to be about $375-450 million over the three years FY09-
11, similar to the allocation under IDA14 but significantly higher than the total $55 mil lion actually 
committed between FY04-07.   

ii. 

Uzbekistan‘s economy withstood the global crisis relatively well—thanks to continued high 
demand for, and the prices of the country‘s commodity exports, the government‘s end-2008 fiscal 
stimulus, equivalent to 4 percent of GDP, and the financial sector‘s limited exposure to world markets—
and the CAS program was thus little affected.  While the number of operations approved was in line with 
expectations in mid-2008, the total $533 million committed by end-FY11 was significantly higher.  This 
was partly due to the addition of two new energy operations late in the period.  The program of analytical 
and advisory activities and technical assistance was implemented largely as planned 

CAS Program Performance 

iii. 
The Completion Report rates the achievements of outcomes foreseen in the CAS as moderately 
satisfactory.  First, compared to the mid-2000s, the quality and scope of the Bank‘s dialogue and 
interaction with the government on macro-related policies (except for poverty) has demonstrably 
improved.  Moreover, a substantial program of continuing analytical and advisory activities—including a 
planned country economic memorandum focused on competitiveness issues—is in place for the next two 
years.  On the other hand, the Bank‘s influence and role in Uzbekistan remain limited, the bar was set 
deliberately low, and the authorities‘ ostensibly renewed confidence in Bank economic analysis and 
policy advice has not yet translated into better access to key economic, financ ial and social data—nor 
more generally to improved governance and transparency.  Second, although IFC‘s advisory services 
contributed to several regulatory improvements in the business environment, they could not be expected 
to overcome long-standing systemic constraints to private sector development.  Third, the program 
achieved significant results on the ground in rural development and improved water resource 
management, but had little apparent influence on broader agricultural policy reforms or on poverty and 
regional disparity reduction goals.  The human development program, on the other hand, in addition to 
project-specific results, also contributed to and supported implementation of small -scale, but important 
pragmatic reforms in education, health, and water supply and sanitation.

iv. 
CAS Design.  Overall, the CAS was relevant and well aligned with the country‘s stated 
development priorities, although the links between broad-based strategic country goals and CAS-specific 
outcomes were sometimes tenuous or unclear.  CAS outcomes, eschewing controversial or sensitive 
policies or reforms, were realistic—in fact, based largely on already agreed project-specific objectives, 
most were relatively undemanding and clearly intended to ensure achievement.  The quality of the results 
framework, however, was uneven, inconsistent, and unclear in several areas.  The CAS identified five 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
critical risks to implementation, of which three—fiduciary, development effectiveness, and regional 
cooperation—are ongoing and likely to continue into the next FY12-15 CAS and beyond.   

v. 
CAS Implementation.  The flexible, dual track approach worked well, resulting inter alia in an 
almost doubling of the active portfolio—from six projects totaling $266 million in FY08 to ten projects 
totaling $633 million by end-FY11.  Development impact, however, was modest, owing partly to the 
intentionally limited policy content of lending operations, partly to the client‘s avoidance of sensitive 
areas for collaborative economic and sector work (e.g. agriculture, governance, poverty), and partly to the 
gradual pace and narrow scope of Uzbekistan‘s structural reforms process.  Moreover, despite the 
improved dialogue and closer relations, several long-standing operational and portfolio issues remain 
unresolved, such as procurement, especially contract registration, implementation delays, and project 
management.  

vi. 
 Against this background, including the CAS‘ relatively modest, undemanding goals, the 
Completion Report rates the Bank‘s performance in terms of both design and implementation as 
moderately satisfactory.  

II. 

Progress towards Uzbekistan’s Development Goals 

1. 
Uzbekistan’s overall macroeconomic results for the FY08-11 CAS period were broadly in 
line with the goals established in its first Welfare Improvement Strategy (WIS), 2007-10.  With GDP 
growth exceeding 8percent in both 2009 and 2010 according to official data, its economy withstood the 
global economic crisis relatively well, the main impact being weaker demand for the country‘s 
manufactured exports and a marked decline in migrant workers‘ remittances—about 30 percent lower 
than their 2008 peak, when they were equivalent to 7 percent of GDP.  Three factors together explain this 
outcome: first, the continued high world demand for, and prices of copper, cotton, gas, and gold, 
Uzbekistan‘s principal commodity exports, which account for 80 percent of the total; second, the 
government‘s end-2008 fiscal stimulus, equivalent to 4 percent of GDP, that included tax exemptions and 
reductions, increases in public sector wages, support to agriculture, commercial banks, and state -owned 
enterprises, and loans from the Fund for Reconstruction and Development (FRD); and third, the 
economy‘s limited exposure to international financial markets.  In addition, prudent economic 
management before, during, and after the global downturn helped maintain growth and stability.  On the 
other hand, progress towards reducing the structural distortions inherent in Uzbekistan‘s gradualist state-
led development strategy—e.g. the restrictive trade régime, self-sufficiency, the underdeveloped financial 
sector, the difficult business environment, was limited.  Moreover, despite some advances, governance, 
public accountability, and transparency remain major concerns as well.   

2. 
Progress towards the other country development goals supported by the CAS varied.  In 
particular, results for the main themes underlying the CAS program—private sector development, 
increased rural incomes, strengthened human development, and improved environmental and disaster risk 
management—were mixed and often unclear, owing at least partly to insufficient or poor quality data.  
Regarding private sector development, for example, while the authorities report an increase in the share of 
small- and medium-sized enterprises in GDP, from 42 percent in 2006 to 52 percent in 2010, there are no 
official data to indicate whether the broader private sector/GDP ratio improved proportionately 1 .  
Moreover, some private sector development indicators turned negative: for example, Uzbekistan‘s 
relative country ranking in Doing Business fell during the period―from 138/181 in 2009 to 150/183 in 
both 2010 and 2011—and its poor investment climate, specifically access to foreign exchange as well as 
local currency in cash, remains a major challenge2.  Thus, even though the government expects to finance 

1   According to Uzbekistan statistical conventions, the private sector and small- and medium-sized enterprises are synonymous.  The private 
sector includes enterprises with less than majority private equity ownership.   
2   Uzbekistan‘s absolute country-specific score, however, indicates modest progress over time—cf. paragraph 14 below. 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
up to two-thirds  of its $47.3 billion, five-year (2011-15) industrial modernization and infrastructure 
development program with foreign direct investment and/or external loans, there is scant evidence of any 
real improvement in the country‘s overall business environment since 2008.    

3. 
As for increased rural incomes and strengthened human development, project-specific 
indicators suggest continued progress in the delivery of essential social services—education, health, 
and water supply and sanitation.  However, there are no up-to-date reliable data available to verify the 
officially reported declines in poverty, nor to show, for example, whether improved agricultural yields, 
especially of cotton and wheat, are translating into increased farmers‘ incomes.  Likewise, it is unclear 
whether the better access to safe water and the reductions in infant and maternal mortality recorded in 
IDA-financed project districts are being replicated elsewhere in the country.  In fact, given the still slow 
pace of reform in agriculture—with the ‗state order‘ for cotton at below market prices still firmly in 
place—and also in the public education and health systems, especially in rural areas, there is anecdotal 
evidence that unemployment and living standards have changed little during the period.   

III. 

Highlights of CAS Program Performance 

4. 
The overall purpose of the CAS was to support implementation of Uzbekistan’s first WIS, 
2007-10.  The WIS, a comprehensive medium-term development framework, sought to maintain high 
rates of GDP growth and, in particular, to improve living standards, create a more competitive, 
diversified, and modern economy, enhance access to and the quality of public services, and reduce inter-
regional disparities.  Linked to these country objectives, the CAS‘ framework comprised four pillars: (a) 
an enabling environment for shared growth; (b) increased economic and income opportunities in rural 
areas; (c) strengthened human development and social protection through better service delivery; and (d) 
environmental and disaster risk management, and global goods provision.   

5. 
This Completion Report compares results achieved with the outcomes foreseen in the CAS, 
as updated or revised in the FY10 CAS Progress Report (CASPR)3.  It is based inter alia on: portfolio 
implementation performance reports; the last two Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and 
aide memoires of each active project and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) of two projects that 
closed during the CAS period; interviews with selected client counterparts; and self-assessments by the 
country team.  Its initial findings informed the preparation of the FY12-15 Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS). 

Pillar 1:  Enabling Environment for Shared Growth 

6. 
The first pillar envisaged two broad areas of engagement, with outcomes linked to the country‘s 
overall growth, poverty reduction, and macroeconomic management goals, namely: (a) institutional 
support for WIS implementation, including promoting good governance; and (b) private sector 
development, business environment and investment climate.  Activities in these areas were facilitated by a 
mix of advisory and analytical services, policy dialogue, and technical assistance. 

7. 
CAS support for WIS implementation focused on six pre-selected clusters of activity: (a) 
macroeconomic policy formulation; (b) poverty analysis; (c) monitoring and evaluation; (d) public 
financial management reform; (e) budget transparency; and (f) governance.  According to the country 
team‘s self-assessment, outcomes for macroeconomic policy formulation, budget transparency, and 
governance were achieved and those for monitoring and evaluation and for public financial management

were partly achieved.  There was little progress as regards poverty analysis, however.  These results are 
discussed in more detail below. 

8. 
Macroeconomic policy formulation.  In addition to regular advice to decision makers, technical 
assistance was provided to the Ministry of Economy (MOE), the Institute for Macroeconomic Research 
(IFMR), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to strengthen these institutions‘ analytical and forecasting 
capacity through the use of new economic tools.  Specific outputs included: an external debt management 
manual; an assessment of budget revenues; a review of the State Tax Committee‘s organizational 
structure; a guide for the publication of key economic data; a methodology for assessing the impact of 
external shocks such as the recent global crisis on Uzbekistan‘s economy, using a computable general 
equilibrium model (CGE) model, as well as mitigation measures and related policy dialogue; a survey of 
research and development institutions to assess the constraints to their upgrading and modernization; a 
methodology for assessing innovation potential in specific industrial sectors; and workshops and 
roundtables for preparation of a national strategy for innovation-based development. 

9. 
Budget transparency.  The increased frequency and expanded scope of MOF reporting during the 
period contributed to enhanced budget transparency and, indirectly, improved public finance 
management.  Two specific results were achieved: (a) monthly and quarterly reports are now reconciled 
using the unified budget classification, allowing for comparison of approved and actual budgets; and (b) 
all extra-budgetary funds, except the Fund for Reconstruction and Development (FRD), are now 
incorporated into the treasury system.  The treasury in turn introduced the new GFSM 2001-based budget 
classification for the 2011 budget cycle, albeit not yet in terms of published budget data. 

10. 
Governance.  Dialogue on governance and anti-corruption was initiated in the context of several 
anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing activities undertaken jointly with the UNODC.  It 
was later broadened to include data transparency, banking system reforms and, more recently, industrial 
policies.  Specific outcomes included: Uzbekistan‘s signature of the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption in August 2008; Uzbekistan‘s ratification of the OECD Istanbul Action Plan in March 2010; 
and the creation of a national anti-corruption strategy working group tasked with developing an action 
plan and assessing—jointly with OECD—the country‘s institutional capacity for combating corruption.  
Meanwhile, an assessment of the accountability, efficiency, and transparency of primary health care 
services was completed in mid-2009 as planned. 

11. Monitoring and evaluation.  A WIS monitoring and evaluation framework was developed and 
partially implemented, specifically the provision of hardware, software, and MoE staff training, including 
a September, 2008 study tour to Vietnam.  In addition, a database of over 170 improved education and 
health indicators was prepared and integrated into the framework, financed by a small IDF grant to the 
MOE and the Ministries of Education and Health.  However, the monitoring and evaluation unit is not yet 
formally incorporated into the MOE, nor is the framework integrated into other core ministries.  
Moreover, monitoring and evaluation units at the regional and district levels also need further capacity 
building.   

12. 
Public financial management reform.  Agreement was reached on a joint PEFA assessment that 
will be used to benchmark Uzbekistan‘s public finance management (PFM) system.  Meanwhile, 
technical assistance was provided to support continued implementation of the MOF‘s treasury reform in 
two phases with the following outputs:  (a) a draft instruction establishing the accounting framework and 
a draft unified chart of accounts consistent with international public sector accounting standards and 
aligned with the new GFSM 2001-based budget classification; and (b) an accounting framework for 
budget organizations, as well as the training of 50 staff. 

13. 
Poverty analysis.  There was no change in the authorities‘ policy regarding access to primary 
household budget survey data.  Therefore, technical assistance for the newly established Institute for 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Social Research focused on providing analytical support, knowledge sharing, and the organization of 
twinning arrangements between WIS working groups and overseas research institutes .  Meanwhile, 
although a multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) covering 20,000 households was formally launched 
in 2010, with UNICEF support, it will not be completed until September, 2011.  Analysis of the results of 
this MICS is expected to provide some indication of trends in poverty-related outcomes.  

14. 
CAS support for private sector development, business environment, and the investment 
climate was provided almost entirely by IFC.  Advisory services, comprising four projects totaling 
almost $4.5 million (including Central Asia and Azerbaijan regional projects), promoted improvements in 
the business environment and financial sector.  IFC‘s long-standing investment climate advisory project 
assessed the impact of proposed regulations affecting businesses and simplifying tax administration.  In 
addition to advisory work on leasing and housing finance, a recently launched regional financial markets 
infrastructure advisory project focuses on the further development of credit information sharing systems 
and formal risk management education and certification. 

15. 
IFC’s private sector development work comprised analytical and advisory services in five 
areas: (a) improved business environment (as measured by Doing Business); (b) public-private 
partnerships (PPPs); (c) leasing and housing finance; (d) tax administration; and (e) credit information 
sharing.  According to the IFC team‘s self assessment, outcomes for leasing and housing finance and for 
improved business environment were achieved; and those for tax administration, credit information 
sharing, and PPPs were partly achieved.  Regarding the business environment, although Uzbekistan‘s 
relative country ranking in Doing Business fell during the period, an alternative so-called ‗change score‘ 
that measures country-specific progress in absolute terms points to modest technical improvements over 
the past five years.  These include: a 25 percent reduction in building permit fees; a new, simplified tax 
code, and reduced tax rates; a 30 percent reduction in mandatory business inspections; and, adoption of a 
regulation for cameral (off-site) control of businesses.  Despite these positive results, the two main 
obstacles to an improved business environment and investment climate―limited access to foreign 
exchange as well as cash local currency―remain essentially unchanged since 2008 .  As for PPPs, 
between October 2009-2011, the Ministry of Health worked with IFC under a financial advisory services 
agreement for a proposed partnership involving medical diagnostic centers; in the end the Ministry of 
Health decided not to pursue this PPP scheme until a more complete health care reform is implemented.  
In addition, memoranda of understanding have recently been signed with Uzkommunkhizmat (UzK), the 
national utilities agency, and with the city of Tashkent for pilot partnerships in utilities and solid waste 
management respectively.  In IFC‘s view, prospects for completing this PPP agenda are good, albeit not 
during the current CAS. 

16. 
IFC invested $8 million in two financial sector projects during the period.  This modest 
outcome, although an increase over the preceding (ISN) period, reflected the constraints affecting the 
country‘s private sector.  A $3 million credit line to Uzbek Leasing is financing medium-term leases for 
industrial equipment and machinery for small- and medium enterprises (SMEs).  A $5 million debt and 
equity financing to Hamkorbank, one of the country‘s few private banks, is accompanied by advisory 
services to strengthen management information systems (MIS), human resources, risk management and 
corporate governance practices.  IFC portfolio clients in the financial sector provided almost 40,000 loans 
to small and medium-sized enterprises during 2008-2009 and held outstanding MSME portfolios of over 
$500 million at end-2009.  Nonetheless, the country‘s relatively low private sector/GDP ratio, the small 
amount of private foreign direct investment, and IFC‘s own modest portfolio are together evidence that 
Uzbekistan‘s business environment and investment climate still require significant improvement. 

Pillar 2:  Increasing Economic and Income Opportunities in Rural Areas  

17. 
To support government efforts aimed at increasing economic and income opportunities in rural 
areas, reducing poverty, and lessening regional disparities—and consistent with the WIS‘ focus on rural 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
development and improved water resource management—the CAS relied on four ongoing operations: two 
Rural Enterprise Support Projects (RESP)—I & II, the Drainage, Irrigation & Wetlands Improvement 
Project, and the Fergana Valley Water Resources Management Project.  Together, these were expected to 
produce three related outcomes: (a) increased yields of corn, cotton, wheat, fruits and vegetables; (b) 
enhanced farmers‘ access to credit and other financial services in seven provinces; and (c) strengthened 
capacity of water users‘ associations. 

18. 
Based on recent ISRs and the ICR for RESP-I, all four projects‘ contributed directly or indirectly 
to achievement of these outcomes.  For example, the Drainage, Irrigation & Wetlands Improvement 
Project enhanced the quality and potential productivity of 100,000 ha of land by investment in improved 
drainage and irrigation facilities.  Likewise, in RESP-I districts, cotton and wheat yields increased on 
average by 15 percent and 27 percent respectively;  farmers‘ access to credit and other financial services 
expanded significantly; and the capacity and viability of water users‘ associations, based on 
hydrographical rather than administrative boundaries, is now stronger.  Whether these higher yields 
translated into increased rural incomes, however, is less clear: the ICR asserts that they helped reduce 
poverty, but offers no evidence.  Although cotton farmers in RESP-I districts were allowed to sell their 
‗above quota‘ output outside the national ‗state order‘ system—an opportunity explicitly designed to help 
increase their incomes significantly—the delay in issuing the enabling decree, the practical obstacles to 
‗above quota‘ sales (virtually all cotton ginneries remain government-owned or controlled), and the small 
scale of the pilot scheme together meant that its results were inconclusive.  At the same time, analyses of 
projects in other (non-RESP) districts suggest that farmers‘ incomes remain constrained by the long-
standing systemic barriers to technological change and agricultural reform, such as continuing 
governmental controls over cropping patterns and the supply of inputs such as fertilizers and seeds, as 
well as other policies and practices that stifle innovation and risk taking.  Thus, although CAS outcomes , 
actual and prospective, contributed to achievement of two of this pillar‘s three country goals—increased 
agricultural productivity and enhanced sustainability of irrigation and land improvement—their influence 
on farmers‘ incomes and, more broadly, their impact on poverty reduction in rural areas are uncertain.  
Finally, a water sector investment planning study that defined a methodology for prioritizing individual 
irrigation and drainage investment projects was completed in mid-2009 as planned. 

Pillar 3:  Strengthening Human Development & Social Protection 

19. 
To strengthen human development and social protection, the CAS targeted three broadly-defined 
sub-sectoral outcomes: (a) increased provision of safe water and sanitation; (b) improved health indices, 
specifically for infant and maternal mortality; and (c) enhanced basic education and learning, measured by 
the adoption of quality enhancing techniques, materials, and participatory practices.  It supported 
government efforts in these three areas through five ongoing projects, two of which were completed 
during the period, as well as three new operations, supplemented by focused analytical and advisory 
services. 

20. 
Improved Provision of Safe Water and Sanitation.  CAS outcomes for increased provision of 
safe water and sanitation―measured by improved supply reliability, enhanced water quality, energy 
efficiency, cost recovery, and customer satisfaction under the now completed Bukhara and Samarkand 
Water Supply Project―were fully achieved.  However, institutional development efforts to strengthen the 
two water utilities through a performance-based service contract with an international operator failed, 
with the ICR rating both project development objectives and Bank and borrower performance moderately 
unsatisfactory.  Nevertheless, experience gained under this project helped inform a less ambitious design 
for the Bukhara and Samarkand Sewerage Project approved in FY10.  Moreover, a Municipal Services 
Sector Study and a Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy Note helped sustain policy dialogue on 
investment and policy reform priorities and support preparation of three new projects (Syr Darya Water 
Supply, Alat-Karkul Water Supply, and Karakalpakstan Sewerage), of which one (Syr Darya Water 
Supply) was approved in late-FY11.   

47 

 
 
 
 
  
   
 
21. 
Improved Health Indices.  Since the mid-1990s, reforms in Uzbekistan‘s public health system 
have focused on restructuring primary health care—specifically training of general practitioners, 
upgrading of rural clinics‘ infrastructure and equipment, and expansion in the scope of services 
provided—and establishing an emergency care network.  These changes and other structural and health 
financing reforms supported by the 2nd Health Project, now nearing completion, have resulted in 
increased utilization of services and improved patients‘ satisfaction.  They have also encouraged health 
system efficiency, as patients shift to lower-cost, outpatient services, and helped re-orient facilities 
towards local needs and improved accountability.  The recently approved and much larger 3rd Health 
System Improvement Project will provide support for district hospital services improvement, primary 
health care development, and the quality of secondary health care, for ongoing health financing and 
management reforms, and for institutional strengthening for non-communicable diseases prevention and 
control.  Meanwhile, although an intended CAS result—to increase the proportion of pregnant women 
receiving antenatal care during the first trimester—was not achieved, neither this result nor the planned 
CAS outcome—to reduce infant and maternal mortality further—were a particular focus of the CAS 
program, which was obviously concentrated more broadly on human and physical infrastructure 
investments, health financing and management reforms, and institutional development.  Progress in these 
areas under the 2nd Health Project and as reflected in the ambitious scope of the 3rd Health System 
Improvement Project was evidently satisfactory.   

22. 
Improved Basic Education and Learning.  In 2007, Uzbekistan spent 7.5 of its GDP and 25 
percent of its budget on education—well above the OECD average—with resources until 2004 
concentrated mainly on measures to upgrade secondary vocational education.  Since then, there has been a 
shift in focus to general education, specifically the School Education Development Program, 2004-09, 
which—coterminous with the Basic Education Project (BEP)-Phase 1—has supported rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of about 8,500 schools, provision of furniture, science and technology equipment and other 
learning resources, including teacher training, and increased teacher salaries.  This focus on improved 
human and physical resources and the quality of education, as well as financing and structural reforms, 
produced positive changes in line with intended CAS results and outcomes.  For example, per capita 
financing was introduced nationwide in 2010; standardized assessments of student learning for 4 th and 8th 
graders have been implemented nationwide; and 85 percent of BEP-Phase 1 project schools now have 
functioning school boards—the target for 2011.  Meanwhile, BEP-Phase 2, approved in June 2009, builds 
upon and extends the capacity created under BEP-1.  It also combines targeted interventions to poor, rural 
schools with interventions designed to encourage broader, systemic education reform.  CAS outcomes for 
improved basic education and learning were thus achieved. 

Pillar 4:  Managing Environmental and Disaster Risks and Global Goods Provision 

23. 

The fourth pillar originally provided for a variety of analytical, advisory, and technical assistance 
activities in five areas: weather forecasting, adaptation to climate change, renewable energy, carbon 
finance, and communicable diseases.  During the FY10 CASPR process, these were reduced to three: 
improved energy efficiency; reduced greenhouse gas emissions; and improved environmental and disaster 
risk management.  At the same time, an energy efficiency project was added to the program. 

24. 
Improved Energy Efficiency.  Having declared the need to improve the energy efficiency of 
industrial enterprises as one of its key priorities, the government requested urgent IDA assistance for a 
pilot project support implementation of the necessary policy measures and, in particular, to finance 
investments in energy savings equipment and technology through three commercial banks.  Thus, a $25 
million Energy Efficiency for Industrial Enterprises operation—the first WBG operational commitment in 
Uzbekistan‘s energy sector—was added to the CAS program and approved in mid-2010, although one 
year later (mid-2011) it has still not yet been signed.  If this pilot is successful, it is planned to develop a 
more ambitious operation, with a much larger credit line and the addition of more financial 
intermediaries. 

48 

 
 
  
 
 
 
25. 

Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions.  Dialogue on Uzbekistan‘s participation in the Global Gas 
Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) and Carbon Financing Mechanisms continues .  Uzbekneftegaz, the 
national oil and gas company, confirmed its participation in the GGFR Partnership for 2010-12, aiming to 
reduce gas flaring from its oil production.  A possible Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Gas Flare 
Reduction Project under the Kyoto Protocol is also under preparation. 

26. 
Improved Environmental and Disaster Risk Management.  An energy sector vulnerability to 
climate change study has been initiated.  A regional workshop took place in 2009 to launch regional 
disaster risk management (DRM) reports and to initiate the recently approved Central Asia regional 
hydro-meteorological program.  Technical capacity was built in inventorying obsolete pesticide-
contaminated burial sites; inventories and risk assessments were carried out; and recommendations for 
remediation were prepared for two priority burial sites.  Finally, at the regional level, an independent 
assessment of the regional impact of Vakhsh River Basin development was initiated. 

CAS Program Results Rating 

27. 
The Completion Report rates the achievements of outcomes foreseen in the CAS as 
moderately satisfactory.  First, compared to the mid-2000s, the quality and scope of the Bank‘s dialogue 
and interaction with the government on macro-related policies (except for poverty) has demonstrably 
improved.  Moreover, a substantial program of continuing analytical and advisory activities—including a 
planned country economic memorandum focused on competitiveness issues—is in place for the next two 
years.  On the other hand, the Bank‘s influence and role in Uzbekistan remain limited, the bar was set 
deliberately low, and the authorities‘ ostensibly renewed confidence in Bank economic analysis and 
policy advice has not yet translated to better access to key economic, financial and social data—nor more 
generally to improved governance and transparency.  Second, although IFC‘s advisory services 
contributed to several technical improvements in the business environment, it could not be expected to 
overcome the country‘s systemic constraints to private sector development.  Third, the program achieved 
significant results on the ground in rural development and improved water resource management, but had 
little obvious influence on broader agricultural policy reforms or on poverty and regional disparity 
reduction goals.  The human development program, on the other hand, in addition to project -specific 
results, also contributed to and supported implementation of small-scale, but important pragmatic reforms 
in education, health, and water supply and sanitation.   

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

28. 
Reflecting slowly improving Bank-client relations and the need to calibrate different levels 
of engagement to different degrees of government commitment, the CAS adopted a flexible, two -
track approach.  This was defined as: (a) full engagement, i.e. lending, analytical and advisory services, 
and technical assistance, in policy areas and/or sectors of common agreement exemplified by strong 
government commitment and a successful Bank track record; and (b) limited engagement, i.e. analytical 
and advisory services and/or technical assistance in areas where there was no, or incomplete consensus on 
goals and where a road map of policies, programs, and sequencing remained to be agreed.   

29. 
The IDA15 financial envelope was expected to be in the range $375-450 million over the three 
years FY09-11, similar to the allocation under IDA14 but significantly higher than the total $55 million 
actually committed between FY04-07.  Lending was to focus on investments in: (a) public services 
affecting rural and urban populations directly that supported implementation of sector-specific reforms; 
and (b) activities that reinforced Uzbekistan‘s contribution to the global goods and climate change agenda 
and the promotion of regional cooperation.  At the government‘s request, two significant adjustments 
were made at the time of the FY10 CAS Progress Report: the addition of three new operations in energy; 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and, the resumption of IBRD lending up to $250 million for two of these three operations .  Non-lending 
activities were to focus on key sector and thematic areas. 

30. 
Eight operations totaling $533 million were approved during the period.  Water supply and 
sewerage $143 million) and energy ($135 million) together accounted for 52 percent of the total, followed 
by agriculture and water resources management ($134 million, or 25 percent) and education and health 
($121 million, or 23 percent).  In terms of thematic priorities, strengthening human development and 
social protection received half of total commitments, with four operations totaling $264 million.  
Meanwhile, two operations totaling $134 million supported increasing economic opportunities in rural 
areas and two totaling $135 million the energy efficiency element of the environmental and disaster risk 
management and global goods provision pillar.  Thus, CAS outcomes in terms of number of operations 
were broadly in line with expectations in mid-2008, but significantly exceeded in terms of amounts 
committed, with lending of $291 million in FY11—by far the largest to Uzbekistan in any single year.4  
This was partly due to the addition of two new energy operations in FY10-11, including the $110 million 
IBRD loan for Talimarjan Transmission—the largest sector investment loan to Uzbekistan to date.  Table 
2—Planned Lending and Actual Deliveries, FY08-11—compares originally planned and actual lending. 

CAS Design and Relevance 

31. 
Overall, the CAS was relevant and well aligned with the country’s stated development 
priorities—although 
the 
links between broad-based strategic country goals and CAS-specific 
programmatic outcomes was sometimes tenuous or unclear.  However, the flexible, two-track approach 
was effective in helping ensure client commitment and ownership and facilitated program adjustment 
during implementation as intended.  Planned outcomes, eschewing controversial or sensitive policies or 
reforms, were realistic—in fact, given that some were based on already agreed project-specific results, 
they were relatively undemanding and clearly intended to ensure achievement.  In the circumstances, the 
fact that some were not, or only partly achieved is disappointing.  The quality of the results framework 
was uneven, inconsistent, and unclear in several areas.  Five critical risks to CAS implementation were 
correctly identified, of which three—fiduciary, development effectiveness, and regional cooperation— are 
ongoing and likely to continue into the next FY12-15 CAS and beyond. 

32. 
Operationally, the dual track approach worked well, resulting in an almost doubling of the 
active portfolio during the period—from six projects totaling $266 million in FY08 to ten projects 
totaling $633 million by end-FY11.  Policy impact, however, appears modest—owing partly to the 
intentionally limited policy content of lending operations, partly to the client‘s avoidance of sensitive 
areas for collaborative AAA (such as agriculture, governance, poverty), and partly to the gradual pace and 
narrow scope of Uzbekistan‘s structural reforms process.  Moreover, despite the improved dialogue and 
closer Bank/IDA relations, key long-standing issues remain unresolved—e.g. data access, quality, and 
transparency; procurement (including contract registration); implementation delays; and project 
management.  

33. 
Design of new projects/programs.  RESP II and three new water supply and/or sewerage 
operations took into account lessons learned from preceding ICRs (RESP-I and WSSP), especially 
institutional development experience.  Moreover, the potential for more programmatic approaches to 
(e.g.) future water supply and health operations, as well as education (ongoing), is under considera tion.  
At the same time, the Bank‘s project cycle and the government‘s investment approval processes are still 
not well aligned, leading to long delays in signing, effectiveness, and initial implementation.  Similarly, 
procurement remains subject 
to significant delays, partly due 
to 
the government‘s contract 
registration/price verification procedures, which also contravene Bank Procurement Guidelines.  The 

4  Bank/IDA lending during the preceding 14 years (FY94-07) totaled $654.1 million, i.e. an annual average of $47 million, of which $599.1 
million was committed between FY94-03 and $55 million between FY04-07.

rapid increase in portfolio size and complexity during the period make resolution of these two long-
standing generic issues even more urgent. 

34. 
Relevance, quality, and dissemination of knowledge-based activities.  Given the satisfactory 
outcome of analytical and advisory services and technical assistance under the first growth pillar (except 
for poverty analysis),  knowledge-based activities were evidently highly relevant, of appropriate quality, 
and timely (e.g. just-in-time notes)—and driven by client demand.  Linking these activities explicitly to 
the implementation of public investments (e.g. water supply and sanitation, health) or the resolution of 
particular policy reform issues (e.g. public financial management, private sector development)—as 
requested by client—ensured ownership and impact.  However, access to, and the quality of key 
economic, financial, and social data remain problematical—despite apparent progress stemming from the 
2010 CPIA process and the authorities‘ recently indicated readiness to provide data for publication in the 
IMF‘s International Finance Statistics (IFS)—and progress towards broadening the governance and 
transparency agenda and dialogue was limited.  On the other hand, a priori agreement on the purpose and 
scope of planned knowledge-based activities guaranteed their relevance in terms of client interest.   

35. 
Responsiveness to changing country circumstances, priorities and demands.   The flexibility 
built into the CAS design was in the event fully exploited during the FY10 mid-term progress review 
(CASPR) process.  At the government‘s urgent request, three new energy operations were added to the 
program and, with CFRCR‘s agreement, limited lending of up to $250 million on IBRD terms was 
approved.  The results matrix was also revised and updated. 

36. 
Effectiveness of overall donor assistances.  Overall, official development assistance (ODA) to 
Uzbekistan, never very large, remains limited.  Except for the ADB, the multilaterals‘ exposure (including 
that of the Bank) is very modest and there are only a few bilateral or non-governmental agencies engaged, 
mainly in technical assistance.  Consequently, conventional aid coordination and the Bank‘s role are not a 
major issue.  On the other hand, the growing impact of emerging new partners such as China, Iran, Korea, 
and Russia—especially the effectiveness and fiscal impact of their burgeoning investments in industry 
and infrastructure—will need increasingly to be monitored and taken into account.  In this connection, it 
is unclear to what extent the aid efficiency and effectiveness agenda prescribed by the 2005 Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and, more recently, the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action is being 
addressed by the small donor community in Tashkent, including by the Bank. 

37. 
Effectiveness of dialogue and business relations with authorities.  Compared to fraught Bank-
client relations earlier in the 2000s, especially during the FY05-07 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) period, the 
policy dialogue and business dealings have improved steadily since 2007-08, one obvious measure of 
which is the CAS‘ overall moderately satisfactory outcome.  However, CAS indicators and goals were 
modest by design and, despite the enhanced dialogue and relations, several long-standing generic issues—
ultimately impeding the effectiveness of Bank Group assistance—remain unresolved.  Moreover, despite 
best efforts, dialogue on regional issues, especially energy and water, remains difficult and ineffective. 

38. 
Effectiveness of risk mitigation.  Despite progress in mitigating some fiduciary risks—e.g. the 
ongoing public financial management technical assistance activities—procurement and other risks to 
development impact remain high and are likely to continue.  On the other hand, the authorities‘ proactive 
efforts towards end-2008 to mitigate the consequences of the global financial crisis—and the Bank‘s 
intellectual support to the related macroeconomic policy dialogue—were evidently effective.  Risks to 
regional cooperation remain, however, especially those relating to energy and water resources which may 
have indeed worsened.  The proposed Central Asia Energy-Water Development Program (CAEWDP) is 
designed to manage and mitigate, if not reduce these longer-term risks.

World Bank Group Performance Rating 

39. 
Taking into account the CAS’ relatively undemanding objectives, the Completion Report 
rates Bank Group performance as moderately satisfactory.  This outcome mirrors the country‘s 
moderately satisfactory progress towards its development goals.  Relatively strong performing areas 
included macroeconomic management, education, health, water supply and sanitation.  Relatively weak 
performing areas included agriculture, governance, transparency and financial and private sector 
development.  Eight operations totaling $533 million were approved during the period, of which three 
totaling $291 million (55 percent) in FY11 alone—by far the largest annual commitment to date.  Except 
for poverty analysis and the private sector, analytical and advisory activities by the Bank were 
implemented largely as planned.  Portfolio performance remained moderately satisfactory.  These 
outcomes, including the resumption of limited IBRD lending in FY11, evidently validated the efficacy of 
the CAS‘ two-track approach. 

V. 

KEY LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS 

40. 
The FY08-11 CAS was prepared against the background of gradually improving relations, 
following the transitional assistance framework under FY06-07 ISN which had effectively limited the 
program to technical assistance and minimal lending for global goods and social services .  During this 
period of virtual hiatus but also of reflection on the Bank Group‘s experience in Uzbekistan since the 
early 2000s—including the ineffective FY02-04 CAS—several systemic conclusions were drawn.  They 
included the following: (a) that policy dialogue is effective only when demand-driven, specific, and 
clearly articulated—a finding that applies in many countries, but especially so in Uzbekistan; (b) that 
despite the challenging, often problematical policy environment, positive outcomes are still possible with 
appropriately designed, client-driven activities; (c) that investment projects are in general more effective 
‗entry points‘ for policy dialogue and, ultimately, for encouraging reform than separate analytical and 
advisory activities or technical assistance; and (d) that to address the country‘s limited capacity for project 
implementation, renewed and systematic attention needs to be paid to several generic issues, such as the 
country‘s public procurement process and project management. 

41. 
These conclusions informed the design and scope of the FY08-11 CAS and the outcomes 
recorded in this Completion Report—especially those relating to the first and third pillars—have clearly 
validated their accuracy and relevance.  Looking ahead, three additional issues emerge from experience 
since mid-2008: (a) that the Bank‘s project cycle and the government‘s process for approving investment 
projects are still not well aligned, causing significant delays in signing, effectiveness, and initial project 
implementation—the Energy Efficiency for Industrial Enterprises operation being the most recent 
example; and (b) that the long-standing ‗price verification‘ process of the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and International Trade—not a legal, but a compliance and transparency issue—requires early 
resolution, especially given the planned expansion in Bank/IDA lending during the next few years; and 
(c) that the relevance, timeliness, and value of the Bank‘s economic analysis and policy advice—both 
macro and sector-specific—remains constrained by the limited availability and poor quality of 
Uzbekistan‘s key economic, financial and social data.  Action to address these three issues will be an 
important prerequisite for effective and efficient implementation of the next FY12-15 CPS.
