EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Brazil has made remarkable economic and social progress in the last decade and is 
on a path of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. It has raised 22 million 
people out of poverty since 2003 and built a stable economy, which was able to overcome the 
2008/9 global economic crisis successfully. It is the only major middle income country to have 
combined economic growth with reduced inequality. Brazil is making progress toward 
environmental sustainability and deforestation in the Amazon is on a downward trend. Child 
health outcomes have improved, and access to basic education is now almost universal. Brazil is 
likely to meet almost all MDGs ahead of 2015. It has also become an important voice in the 
international development debate, and is sharing its wealth of innovative experiences with the 
world.  

ii. 
Brazil now faces the challenge of reaching a higher development level, which 
requires even more innovative, integrated and knowledge-intensive approaches. A key 
challenge is to accelerate economic growth and further strengthen resilience to international 
shocks. This requires significant increases in savings and investment, reduction of infrastructure 
gaps, enhancing private sector productivity, and improving human capital. A second challenge is 
to further reduce inequality and offer human development opportunities to all, especially women. 
Despite its recent progress, Brazil remains among the 10 most unequal countries in the world. A 
third challenge is to further enhance the environmental sustainability and resilience of Brazil‘s 
development including by further enhancing biodiversity conservation, as well as natural 
resources and disaster risk management. 

iii. 
In line with these challenges, and carrying forward the work of the Lula 
Administration, President Dilma Rousseff has set ambitious social and economic targets in 
coordination with sub-national governments. The Government of Brazil (GoB) aims to 
significantly increase Brazil‘s growth potential above the current 4% to 4.5% through increased 
investments, higher public savings, and by maintaining fiscal discipline. The ongoing Growth 
Acceleration Programs (PAC I and II) infrastructure strategies will invest R$1.4 trillion between 
2007 and 2014. Part of this will be used for the world‘s largest slum upgrading and low-income 
housing program, involving 2 million new houses. The government‘s flagship social program, a 
pledge to eradicate extreme poverty, seeks to benefit 16 million people by 2014. Brazil‘s 
commitment to environmental sustainability is illustrated by ambitious and unilaterally adopted 
targets to reduce GHG emissions by about 38% by 2020. 

iv. 
Likewise, the CPS for 2012-2015 will build on, and deepen, the last Country 
Strategy. The World Bank Group has been a valued partner for Brazil, providing integrated and 
often multi-sector development solutions tailored to its needs. The GoB‘s demand for a 
continued strong partnership with the WBG is evidenced by its recent pre-payment of IBRD 
loans, aimed at opening space for sub-national lending. The Bank has also benefited greatly from 
Brazil‘s unique demands, which required the WBG to adapt and learn. Innovation and 
knowledge have been the central elements of this relationship, with strong flows of knowledge 
transfers to, from, and within Brazil, supported by a large impact evaluation program. The FY12-
15 CPS seeks to take these achievements further by maintaining the focus on knowledge 
generation and transfer, with greater emphasis on inclusiveness in line with President Rousseff‘s 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
goal of eradicating extreme poverty. In this context, the Bank and IFC will expand their support 
for the Northeast, Brazil‘s poorest region, and for sustainable development in the Amazon, the 
Cerrado, and other fragile ecosystems.  

v. 
Brazil’s priorities for its partnership with the WBG are focused on second-
generation development problems that require innovative solutions, in terms of improving 
national policy frameworks and finding new ways to implement programs with sub-
national governments and at the firm level. The WBG will help address these challenges, and 
help achieve the overarching goal of higher rates of inclusive and sustainable growth by focusing 
on four strategic objectives: (i) increase the efficiency of public and private investments; (ii) 
improve the quality and expand the provision of public services for low income households; (iii) 
promote regional economic development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure 
investments, and support for the private sector in frontier areas; and (iv) further improve 
sustainable natural resource management and enhance climatic resilience while contributing to 
local economic development and helping to meet rising global food demand. Brazil is looking to 
the Bank as a partner in the dissemination of the country knowledge and development 
experiences to other countries.  

vi. 
To respond to Brazil’s broad spectrum of demands, the WBG must be flexible and 
agile in adapting products and delivery mechanisms. In principle, at the Federal level, 
Brazil‘s demand is concentrated in knowledge and strategy development services, using a 
combination of AAA and knowledge-intensive lending, but also leaving room for other financial 
solutions as needed. The Federal Government is also interested in the Bank‘s support to sub-
national Governments as a way of enhancing the implementation of national policies, ranging 
from the fiscal responsibility framework to strategic social and infrastructure investment 
programs. Sub-national governments demand integrated multi-sector development solutions, 
combining technical and financial support and using tailored instruments. The private sector 
seeks highly customized financing packages to help meet unique business and growth objectives. 

vii. 
The CPS identifies an indicative IBRD lending program in the order of US$5.8 
billion for FY12-13. While this is in line with annual lending in FY08-11, it is equivalent to 
about 0.3% of total public expenditures. IFC's own-account investment program is forecast at 
about US$1.0 billion annually in FY12-13, a minute fraction of total private sector investment. 
Thus, if the WBG is to have a significant impact in Brazil, this cannot be derived exclusively 
from the size of its financial contributions, which are bound to be small with respect to the 
country‘s own resources. Rather, the WBG must seek to have a development impact in Brazil 
through the knowledge contributions that it will embed in its various activities. In particular, the 
Bank Group will deploy its resources according to the following principles. Flexibility: 
Adjusting areas of engagement and instruments to better respond to the country‘s evolving 
needs. Selectivity: Focusing on areas where Brazil faces second-generation development 
challenges and can benefit most from the Group‘s knowledge and experience. Innovation: 
Supporting innovative investments and policy reforms that can be replicated locally and 
internationally, and offering innovative services and instruments (e.g. result-based and multi-
sector loans, partial credit risk and other guarantees). Leveraging: Increasing the use of leveraged 
resources from government, the private sector and other development partners, to maximize 
development impacts. 

ii 

 
 
 
 
viii. 
IFC will continue responding to the needs of a rapidly-evolving private sector with a 
suite of competitive financial and advisory products. In FY11, Brazil had IFC‘s largest single 
country new business and mobilization program in the world.  While IFC does not expect to 
increase business volumes significantly, the nature of its involvement is changing toward (i) a 
greater focus on smaller, more difficult investments in poorer, frontier regions such as the 
Northeast and North; (ii) supporting innovation and competitiveness, promoting South-South 
knowledge transfers and encouraging access to new markets and products, and (iii) increasing 
IFC's advisory support to sub-national Governments for PPPs in infrastructure, social sectors, 
and the environment. 

ix. 
Macroeconomic risks are derived from the possibility of a significant worsening of 
the global economic outlook. While this could lead to a deceleration in economic growth, the 
risk of further negative impacts on the Brazilian economy are mitigated by the country‘s large 
external reserves, the solidity of its financial system and the strength of its domestic demand. 
The authorities also face the challenge of dealing with internal inflationary pressures while at the 
same time attempting to minimize the negative impact of external shocks. The risk that this 
situation may lead to deterioration in both growth and inflation prospects is mitigated by the fact 
that Brazil‘s fiscal policy stance has already become less expansionary. Moreover, the authorities 
have announced further increases in public sector savings to improve the balance between fiscal 
and monetary policy instruments in the control of domestic demand.   

x. 
Bank-related risks to the CPS come from the prevailing constraints in the Bank’s 
capacity to lend to Brazil, the relatively small size of the Bank program with respect to the 
Brazilian economy, and the relatively high complexity of multi-sector Bank projects. The 
SBL framework currently limits the Bank‘s net exposure to Brazil to US$16.5 billion. While 
there is a risk that this constraint affects the WBG‘s ability to fully implement the proposed 
program, the recognition of the mutual benefits that the partnership between the WBG and Brazil 
entails creates strong motivations for the parties involved to seek options to address it. The CPS 
is also subject to the risk of the WBG not being able to achieve a significant impact in Brazil, 
due to the small size of its program relative to that of Brazil‘s economy. This risk will be 
mitigated by the CPS‘s explicit recognition that the WBG‘s potential impact in Brazil cannot be 
derived exclusively from its financial contributions. The WBG will leverage its limited resources 
by focusing on knowledge-intensive activities aimed at supporting innovative interventions that, 
scaled-up, can provide benefits that could far exceed the direct impact of the original WBG 
projects. Finally, there are operational risks associated with the inherent complexity of the Bank 
projects that involve multiple implementing agencies across different sectors. These risks will be 
jointly and proactively assessed by the WBG and the GoB during project preparation. They will 
be mitigated through the design of appropriate implementation frameworks, the provision of 
training and other capacity building activities, and the increased use of country systems.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The previous CPS for Brazil covers the period from May 2008 to June 2011. The 
Board of Executive Directors discussed the FY08-11 CPS for Brazil on May 1st, 2008 (Report 
No. 42677-BR). The CPS was organized around four main areas of engagement: strengthening 
the macroeconomic and governance foundations of growth; increasing equity; boosting 
competitiveness; and improving environmental sustainability. As argued in the CPS Progress and 
Completion Reports, the WBG Bank‘s programs and activities have made significant 
contributions to Brazil‘s progress in those four areas. 

2. 
Preparation of the Brazil CPS for FY12-15 coincided with the first semester in office 
of President Dilma Rousseff and all State governors. Consultations for the CPS were carried 
out while the new authorities were developing four-year investment plans (PPAs). This allowed 
the WBG to align its strategies with those of newly elected authorities, ensuring that integration, 
innovation and knowledge could have the greatest impact. 

3. 
The proposed CPS is aligned with LCR and IFC regional strategies and with the 
WBG’s strategic framework for middle income countries (MICs). The LCR and IFC 
strategies focus on creating opportunities for poverty and inequality reduction by targeting the 
poor and vulnerable, supporting growth and employment, strengthening governance, promoting 
global collective action, stimulating private sector innovation and competitiveness, and 
addressing climate change. The CPS is consistent with the Bank Group‘s approach to MICs, 
which calls IBRD and IFC to be responsive, flexible, and innovative. It requires them to work 
with MICs as they take on an increasingly important role in a range of global issues, including 
climate change.  

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

Social, Political and Economic Context 

4. 
Brazil is the largest country in area and population in Latin America and the 
Caribbean. It is an upper middle income country, with a GDP per capita of US$8,327 and a 
population of 191 million in 2010. Brazil has immense natural resources and a strong industrial 
base, but still suffers from a wide gap between rich and poor. Innovative social programs and 
more inclusive growth are gradually reducing inequality. Reforms in the 1990s and sound 
macroeconomic and social policies have led to an extended period of political and economic 
stability, growth and social gains. 

5. 
Brazil has a highly decentralized Federal system. Sub-national governments account 
for over 50% of public sector expenditures and are the main providers of education, health 
care, infrastructure and public security. Well-defined arrangements determine the allocation 
of taxation powers, expenditure responsibilities and transfer mechanisms among the three levels 
of government (Federal, State and Municipal). State and Municipal tax revenues are 
complemented by a system of intergovernmental transfers financed mainly through revenue-
sharing rules laid down in the Constitution. The automatic and formula-based nature of these 
rules guarantees transparency and autonomy, keeping political interference at bay.  

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. 
Brazil held general elections in October 2010 for president, State governors and 
Congress. The elections ratified Brazil‘s economic model and a policy strategy based on primary 
surpluses, inflation targets, and floating exchange rate. President Dilma Rousseff held key 
ministerial posts under President Lula da Silva, and vowed to continue his development 
priorities, focused on achieving Brazil‘s growth potential and deepening social gains. In 
particular, President Rousseff has announced a primary surplus target of R$117.89 billion for 
2011, which was equivalent to 3.1% of GDP at the time it was set, and the goal of further 
reducing government debt, allowing interest rates to fall while keeping inflation under control. 
The Government‘s coalition has a comfortable majority in Congress. 

7. 
Brazil has been reaping the growth benefits of more than a decade of sound macro 
policies and a favorable external environment. During 2004-2010, annual GDP growth 
averaged 4.4%, compared to 1.9% in the previous seven years. A similar increase has been 
observed in Brazil‘s potential growth rate. This was the result of sound domestic policies and 
favorable external conditions. After several bouts of hyperinflation during the 1980s and early 
1990s, the 1994 Real Plan reduced inflation from 2.287% to an average of 45% in 1995-96. 
During the past decade, stabilization efforts were grounded in an inflation targeting regime, 
together with a consistent emphasis on fiscal discipline and a flexible exchange rate. As a result 
of these efforts, inflation was reduced to an average of 6.4% in 1997-2010. 

8. 
Fiscal discipline has been consistently pursued at the Federal and sub-national 
levels, under the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). Additional controls on sub-national fiscal 
performance were introduced in debt renegotiation contracts signed by the Federal government 
with the States in 1997, and with some of the largest municipalities in 2001. Passed in 2000, the 
FRL established limits for personnel expenditures and indebtedness at all levels of government, 
only allowed new permanent spending mandates if they were based on permanent revenue 
increases, and forbade debt refinancing between different levels of government. Strong 
government balances at the Federal and sub-national levels reduced the net public sector debt-to-
GDP ratio from 57% in 2002 to 38.5% in 2008 (from 18% to 13% of GDP in the case of sub-
nationals). Although counter-cyclical fiscal measures adopted during the 2008-2009 global 
financial crisis raised the net debt ratio to 42.8% in 2009, it declined to 39.7% in June 2011. The 
government also increased its debt maturity and the share of fixed-rate and local currency 
denominated bonds, significantly reducing exchange and interest rate risks. Credit rating 
agencies granted Brazil an investment grade in April 2008 and issued further upgrades in 2011. 

9. 
Growth has benefited from a favorable external environment, which contributed to 
a rapid rise in exports and international reserves. Thanks to a strong export performance 
following the 2001 global economic slowdown and prior to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, 
Brazil was able to generate sizable trade surpluses for most of the past decade – on average 
US$32.5 billion per year in 2002-2008. During this period the country was able to accumulate 
large international reserves – US$206 billion by the end of 2008 compared to US$37 billion in 
2002.  

10. While exports benefited from large increases in international commodity prices, 
exports of services and manufacturing goods grew strongly. Brazil‘s terms of trade increased 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
by a modest 12% during 2002-2008, compared to an increase of more than 200% in international 
commodity prices. Accounting for 45% of total Brazilian exports in 2002-2008, manufacturing 
exports grew by 41% in volume, compared to 36% for commodities.1 Brazil also diversified its 
export markets, with large increases in trade with Mercosul, the Asia-Pacific region (especially 
China), and the European Union.   

11. 
Steady credit growth also contributed to Brazil’s performance. Starting in the late 
1990s, Brazil successfully restructured, strengthened, and modernized its financial system 
following the Real Plan. Between 1995 and 2008 the GoB instituted a rigorous regulatory and 
supervisory framework, created a deposit insurance mechanism, modernized payment and 
settlement systems, and passed new bankruptcy and home loan legislation. It also issued 
regulations allowing salaries and transfers to be used as collateral for consumer loans. Credit 
expanded from 26% of GDP in 2002 to 47.3% in July 2011 without compromising the Banking 
system‘s solvency. 

Recent Economic Developments 

12. 
Brazil’s relative resilience during the global financial crisis reflected its good 
macroeconomic management and the solidity of its financial system. Following the global 
economic crisis in September 2008, Brazil suffered a sudden reduction in external and domestic 
credit, and a sharp currency depreciation. Rapidly falling external demand and an acute decline 
in investment led to a 4.2% contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008, and a 2% 
contraction in the first quarter of 2009. The recession, however, lasted only two quarters. Prompt 
response by the authorities avoided a credit crunch, and mitigated the impact of the global 
financial crisis on the Brazilian economy, which recovered rapidly. After experiencing almost 
zero growth in 2009, Brazil grew at 7.5% in 2010. 

13. 
The authorities’ response to the global crisis combined injection of liquidity into the 
banking system, a reduction in interest rates, and fiscal and quasi-fiscal stimuli. The 
credibility built over the previous decade allowed the Government to adopt expansionary fiscal 
and monetary policies. The non-financial public sector primary surplus fell from 3.4% of GDP in 
2008 to 2.0% in 2009, due mainly to automatic stabilizers, as well as tax reductions for selected 
consumer goods and public investment growth. The Central Bank cut its policy rate by 500 basis 
points, reduced reserve requirements, and encouraged larger banks to support smaller through 
loan portfolio sales. Credit markets recovered quickly. 

14. 
During the past two years, growth has been driven by domestic demand, fueled by 
expansionary fiscal policies and rapid credit growth. Household consumption contributed 
with 4.4 percentage points of the 7.5% growth registered in 2010. Investments grew by a robust 
21.9%. Fiscal policy was appropriately countercyclical in 2009. It remained expansionist in 
2010, driven by strong rigidities in current expenditures, the political cycle (2010 was an election 
year), and difficulty in reversing the 2009 countercyclical measures. Treasury funding of 
BNDES, expanded from R$1.8 billion in 2007, to R$100 billion in 2009 and R$80 billion in 
2010. Overall, lending by public banks grew 105% between August 2008 and July 2011, 
compared to 53% for private banks.

The strength of domestic demand has contributed to a widening of the current 
account deficit, which reached 2.3% of GDP in 2010 (compared to 1.5% in 2009). Going 
forward, the current account deficit is expected to expand gradually to 3.5% of GDP by 2015 
(Table 1). Foreign direct investments are expected to remain strong and help finance the majority 
of the current account deficit. In addition, at least in the short term, foreign portfolio investments 
are also expected to remain very strong. Driven mainly by high real domestic interest rates at a 
time of exceptionally low interest rates internationally, these inflows have put strong upward 
pressure on the Real and prompted the authorities to increase from 2 to 6% the taxation of 
financial transactions of foreign fixed income investments.

16. 
The upward pressure on the Real, together with widening current account deficits 
and growing private sector indebtedness create difficult economic policy trade-offs. The 
Central Bank has rapidly accumulated international reserves, reaching US$346.1 billion in July 
2011 (from US$238.5 billion in December 2009). However, this has been accompanied by an 
increase in broadly defined gross external debt – including intercompany loans and nonresident 
holdings of domestic fixed income instruments – from about US$373.4 billion at the end of 2009 
to US$538.8 billion in July 2011. In particular, the private sector‘s gross external debt increased

by 63% between December 2009 and July 2011 (116% in the case of Banks), reaching US$340.9 
billion ($137.3 billion for Banks). Going forward, the pattern of capital flows that is financing 
the growing current account deficit and the continued build-up of reserves may lead to further 
increases in gross indebtedness. The Central Bank has stepped up its monitoring of prudential 
and macro-prudential risks associated with potential currency mismatches by financial and non-
financial companies, by increasing reporting requirements on foreign borrowing by non-financial 
corporations. It has also taken measures to mitigate those risks by tightening regulations on 
banks‘ net open positions, and tightening capital requirements to curtail credit growth. These 
measures are being combined with efforts to use monetary and fiscal policy instruments to 
control growth in domestic demand, which should indirectly help lower the upward pressure on 
the exchange rate (through lower portfolio inflows) and the current account deficit. 

17. 
To address risks of overheating, the Central Bank has first adopted a 
contractionary monetary policy stance but recently eased it in response to a considerable 
worsening of the global economic outlook. Inflation, as measured by IBGE (IPCA), closed 
2010 at 5.9%, and reached almost 6.9% in the year to July 2011, thus surpassing the upper limit 
of the inflation target (6.5%). Labor market conditions have tightened, with record levels of job 
creation and historically low unemployment (6% in July 2011). To control inflation, the Central 
Bank increased the policy rate by 375 basis points, starting in April 2010, to 12.5% in June 2011. 
However, on August 31st 2011, in response to a perceived deterioration in the outlook for global 
growth and the assessment that this will have a disinflationary bias going forward, the Central 
Bank reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points to 12%. 

18. 
The Central Bank has also taken macro-prudential measures to contain rapid credit 
growth. While credit has already started decelerating, early stage delinquency indicators 
(overdue loans between 15 and 90 days) have gradually risen in the last year, mainly in the 
consumer segment (6.3% in July 2011 up from 5.3% in December 2010). While this 
development portends higher non performing loan (NPL) ratios in the upcoming months, the 
banking system appears well prepared to absorb a worsening of the credit portfolio. The system-
wide solvency ratio is currently estimated at around 17%. Indeed, banks have managed to 
organically grow their capital base through the capitalization of robust profits. Furthermore, 
supervisors are phasing in tightened capital requirements in anticipation of Basel III. Similarly, 
while housing loans have grown very strongly (49% in the year to July 2011), they still represent 
only 10% of total private sector credit. Moreover, the risk of an ―asset bubble‖ developing in 
Brazil‘s real estate markets is mitigated by high real interest rates.  

19. 
Fiscal policy has also generated strong results in early 2011. Between January and 
July 2011 the cumulative primary surplus stood at R$92 billion, which is equivalent to 78% of 
the 2011 target of R$117.9 billion. Despite the budget cuts of R$50 billion announced in 
February 2011, fiscal performance has relied more on revenue strength than on lasting restraint 
in noninvestment spending. The GoB has recently announced its intent of implementing further 
cuts in current expenditures, which should contribute to a better balance in the control of 
domestic demand between fiscal and monetary policy instruments, and thus help address the 
challenges created by the large portfolio inflows attracted by Brazil‘s high real interest rates. 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
20. 
The medium term macro outlook points to an annual GDP growth range of 4% to 
4.5%. In the short term, after a slowdown in economic activity in response to the initial 
tightening of monetary policy and worsening external conditions, growth could be further 
depressed by a further reduction in external demand, lower foreign investment flows, tighter 
international credit conditions and a deterioration of consumer and business confidence. In the 
medium term, growth is likely to be driven by strong domestic aggregate demand. Investment 
growth, in particular, will be spurred by the development of new offshore oil fields and the 
preparations for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. 

Poverty Trends 

21. 
In recent years Brazil has achieved very rapid social progress. Figure 1 shows that 
growth in per capita income was several times faster among the poorest than among the richest 
segments of the population. This was the case both for labor income and for non-labor income 
(e.g. from social programs), with the latter accounting for 42% of total income growth among the 
poorest 30%, compared to 29% among the richest 30%. As a result, between 2003 and 2009 
poverty fell by 40% and extreme poverty by 52%. More than 22 million Brazilians emerged from 
poverty during that period and almost 13 million rose above extreme poverty. Rapid social 
progress was also observed in the areas of health and education. Malnutrition among children 
under five has been more than halved since the 1990s. Survival rates in that age group and the 
fraction of children with adequate weight for their age have both reached 98%. Almost all 
children are currently enrolled in school – 98% for those aged 7 to 14, and access to electricity is 
almost universal. Moreover, gender-related differences in education outcomes have been 
basically eliminated and, in fact, a gap favoring girls now exists in secondary and tertiary 
enrollment.2

Note: Annual rates. Source: own calculations using PNAD (2001, 2009). 
22. 
Economic growth explains about one half of the large reduction in poverty recently 
observed in Brazil. The remaining 50% is the result of a decline in inequality, which can be 
decomposed in three main factors: growth in labor income (45% of the fall in inequality), 
increased government transfers (45%), and reduced dependency rates (10%). Inequality is likely 
to be further reduced by the rapid aging process, and as new and improved social protection

continue to earn lower wages than men with similar observable characteristics. See Annex 6.

programs come in. However, the largest potential sources of further poverty reduction are likely 
to be higher rates of aggregate growth and an increase in the productivity and salaries of workers 
at the bottom of the income distribution. 

Brazil’s Development Challenges: Accelerating Growth 

23. 
Significant increases in public and private investments will be needed to address 
existing infrastructure bottlenecks. Brazil has had relatively low investment rates, with direct 
negative impacts on the economy‘s potential growth rate. Aggregate fixed capital accumulation 
averaged 16.7% of GDP during 2000-2009 and reached 18.4% GDP in 2010. Brazil‘s public 
sector investments have amounted to about 3% of GDP during recent years (3.3% in 2010).3 
Investments in infrastructure, in particular, have been falling over the past two decades as a share 
of GDP, affecting the competitiveness of Brazilian firms. Total investments (public and private) 
in electric power, land transportation, telecommunications, and water and sanitation fell from 
5.1% of GDP in the early 1980s to 2.1% of GDP in 2001-06.4 Private sector investment rates are 
also relatively low, especially in comparison to faster-growing Asian economies.  

24. 
A complementary challenge is that of increasing domestic savings in order to 
finance the country’s large investment needs. The Growth Acceleration Plan (PAC), started in 
2007, intends to increase Brazil‘s aggregate investment rate to 22% of GDP in 2014.5 Although 
external savings could help increase investment, maximizing domestic savings would better 
sustain long-term growth. Brazil‘s domestic saving rate is relatively low by international 
standards. It averaged 16.2% of GDP between 2000 and 2009, based mainly on private savings; 
public savings were negative or close to zero during this period.6  

25. 
Restraining growth in current expenditures and enhancing public sector efficiency 
will be key for increasing domestic public savings. Increasing public savings while creating 
incentives for the expansion of private savings is one of the most important challenges faced by 
the GoB. Considering that Brazil already has a high ratio of taxes to GDP (about 35%), 
responding to this challenge without compromising increases in public investments calls for 
slower current public expenditures growth and increased effectiveness and cost-efficiency of 
government programs. The GoB has announced as one of its main priorities the modernization of 
public sector management to ―do more with less‖. The Government has also announced its intent 
to limit growth in current expenditures below the rate of GDP growth. In addition, the GoB is 
exploring measures to increase domestic private savings, including through the development of 
housing and long-term finance markets.  

26. 
Increasing potential growth will also require significant increases in labor and total 
factor productivity (TFP). During the second half of the twentieth century, Brazil‘s output per 
worker grew at an annual rate of 2.1%. Traditional aggregate growth accounting suggests that 
total factor productivity growth averaged 0.6% during this 50-year period, accounting for about 

3 In comparison, China, India and the Russian Federation had investment rates of respectively 39.1, 28.4% and 
19.1% of GDP during 2000-2009.  
4 In comparison, during the same period Chile increased its investments in those sectors from 3.4 to 5.2% of GDP. 
5 Planned investments under PAC totaled R$504 billion in 2007-2010 and R$955 billion in 2011-2014. 
6 Over the same period, China, India and the Russian Federation had domestic savings of 30 to 47% of GDP.

20% of labor productivity growth.7 More recently, TFP growth has accelerated, reaching 1.1% 
per year during 2002-2008.8 This is equivalent to the rate of output per worker growth in the U.S. 
during the previous three decades. Thus, while Brazil appears to be accompanying the rate of 
global technological change, the aggregate efficiency of the economy would have to grow at an 
even faster rate to help reduce the country‘s income gap with more advanced economies.  

27. 
The GoB has expressed its intention to revamp its productive development policy, 
with a renewed focus on stimulating private investments and exports while promoting 
innovation and productivity growth. Brazil‘s approach for accelerating productivity growth 
implicitly distinguishes between, first, promoting innovation among the group of leading, world-
class Brazilian firms and, second, reducing the productivity gap between those leading firms and 
the large number of small and medium enterprises that make up the rest of the economy and 
exhibit much lower levels of productivity. Some of the recent measures announced by the GoB 
in this regard include reductions in payroll taxes for selected labor and technology intensive 
industries, tax benefits for capital expenditures and exports, and further increases in public 
financing of research and development activities.  

28. 
Complementary improvements in the quantity and quality of human capital are key 
for increasing labor productivity. The massive expansion of schooling in Brazil over the past 
15 years has had dramatic effects on the labor force.9 In 1993, close to 70% of the labor force 
had not completed secondary school. Today that number is 40%. The biggest change is not 
access to primary school, but the much higher share of children who stay in school through 
secondary education. For the basic education system, the overriding implication is the urgency of 
raising student learning, especially among poor children. 

29. 
Brazil’s rapid demographic transition creates social and economic challenges and 
opportunities. Brazil is currently in the so-called demographic bonus period of its demographic 
transition, exhibiting a falling ratio of dependents to working-age population. This situation, 
however, will be reverted starting in 2020. On one hand, this will allow for the share of GDP 
devoted to education to gradually decline without reducing investment levels per student. The 
challenge is to take advantage of this opportunity for improving the effectiveness of the 
education system, so as to raise the productivity of the next generation. On the other hand, health 
care and social security expenditures are likely to increase substantially, driven mainly by the 
growing population share of the elderly. While the 1999 and 2003 pension reforms more than 
halved the projected costs of pension expenditures, these are expected to more than double to 
22.4% of GDP by 2050.10 

Making Growth more Inclusive and Environmentally Sustainable 

30. 
President Dilma Rousseff has announced her intention to eradicate extreme poverty 
and focus on improving opportunities for vulnerable populations. To that end, the GoB has 
announced the multi-sector ―Brasil sem Miséria‖ program (BSM), which targets the 16.2 million

people that still live in extreme poverty in Brazil – i.e. with less than R$70 per capita per month 
(about US$1.5 per day). This implies a strong focus on the Northeast, where 59% of the extreme 
poor are located – another 21% live in the South and Southeast and 20% in North and Central 
regions. The BSM program is comprised of three main pillars: income transfers, productive 
inclusion and access to public services. The Government intends to expand the coverage of its 
main social programs to better reach the most vulnerable populations, and step-up efforts to 
improve the income generation capacity of the poor. 

31. 
Further reducing poverty and income inequality in a context of sustainable 
development is among Brazil’s most important development challenges. Despite Brazil‘s 
important social accomplishments, the living standards of tens of millions of Brazilians remain 
very far from OECD averages. Brazil remains among the 10 most unequal countries in the world 
and most of the poor still lack access to quality public services. More than 41 million Brazilians 
still live with less than US$3.5 dollars per day – equivalent to the official average poverty line – 
and life expectancy at birth remains relatively low (72.3 years in Brazil, compared to 75.2 in 
Argentina and 78.5 in Chile). Regional inequality also remains very high. North and North-East 
regions trail national average incomes by approximately 30 to 40% and exhibit much lower life 
expectancy.11  

32. 
Large challenges also remain in terms of providing better opportunities for children 
of all backgrounds to pursue a productive and dignified life. In particular, personal 
circumstances for which an individual cannot be held accountable—like race, gender, where they 
were raised or socioeconomic status— still considerably affect the probability of accessing basic 
services that are necessary to succeed in life, like education, health care, adequate nutrition or 
clean water.12 Access to reliable water supply and sanitation services is particularly low among 
rural and peri-urban populations, which could impede Brazil from meeting the Millennium 
Development Goals in this specific area. 

33. 
Brazil also faces important challenges in order to implement its low carbon 
development strategy. The country has already been making very important contributions to 
global climate change mitigation and, under its National Policy for Climate Change, it has 
adopted a unilateral goal of reducing greenhouse emissions by 36 to 39% by 2020.13 Brazil 
continues to have one of the ―cleanest‖ energy matrices in the world and is implementing new 
programs to finance renewable energy production and energy efficiency projects. Brazil also 
continues to implement its national policy for prevention and control of deforestation in the 
Amazon and is expanding this initiative to other biomes, such as the Cerrado and the Caatinga.14 

11 For example, life expectancy is below 69 years in Alagoas compared to almost 74 years in Santa Catarina. Income 
comparisons do not take into account differences in purchasing power parity and may thus be over-estimated in real 
terms. 
12 Socioeconomic status, in particular, plays a large role in the probability of accessing education, housing, and 
health services; rural-urban location is one of the main sources of exclusion in accessing housing services. Molinas 
Vega and Paes de Barros (2011), Human Opportunities for Children in Brazil: an Assessment with the Human 
Opportunity Index. 
13 This target is set with respect to a business as usual scenario, using projections from 2005. 
14The Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon (PPCDAm, 2004) and the Action Plan 
for Prevention and Control of Deforestation and Forest Fires in the Cerrado (PPCerrado, 2010) are instruments of 
Brazil's National Policy for Climate Change. A similar plan for the Caatinga biome is being designed.

The coverage of Brazil‘s protected areas has increased from 9% (790,000 km2) of the national 
territory in 2007 to 14% (1,200,000 km2) in 2010.15 Amazon deforestation has been cut by 66% 
since 2005.16  

34. 
Increasing Brazil’s resilience to climatic shocks is an important GoB priority. The 
country faces the challenge of enhancing its institutional capabilities and protecting its 
population and infrastructure from the anticipated impacts of climate change. Negative effects 
include prolonged droughts, reduced potential for agriculture production, and increased 
evaporation from lakes, dams, and reservoirs. Moreover, long periods without rain will be 
punctuated by brief torrential downpours resulting in floods. Some of these effects are already 
evident in the increased recurrence of flooding and droughts that have caused significant social 
and economic impacts in Brazil.17 Dealing with increasingly frequent extreme weather events 
will require a systematic and coordinated approach to disaster risk management (DRM). 

35. Global demand for foodstuffs, particularly grains, presents Brazil with historical 
opportunities and challenges. Meeting rising demand from markets in East and South Asia 
offers the country a unique opportunity to increase agricultural output and productivity. Output is 
already at record levels. The 2011 grain harvest will reach 158.8 million tons, 6.2% more than in 
2010. This has been achieved mostly by rising yields, but in part by an expansion of 25,000 ha of 
cultivated area in the Amazon region, which creates new challenges in terms of mitigating 
growth-related environmental threats.18  

III. BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR BRAZIL 

A. Lessons learned from the previous CPS and stakeholder feedback 

Lessons from the FY08-11 CPS Completion Report 

36. 
The Completion Report (CR) finds a strong delivery of outcomes under the FY08-
FY11 CPS. The CPS delivery of results built on previous support to policy reforms in the 1990s 
and early 2000s. Some of the areas in which the CPS helped Brazil achieve superior outcomes 
include improved fiscal and results-based management practices at the sub-national level, as well 
as enhanced health, education and social protection systems. Moreover, the WBG helped 
increase access to finance and housing by low income households, as well as shift the 

15 Ministry of Environment, 2011, Fourth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
16 Deforestation in the Amazon, according to INPE-PRODES, covered 6,451 km2 in 2010, compared to 19,014 km2 
in 2005. While there have been annual oscillations driven by weather and economic conditions (e.g. deforestation 
tends to increase in years with low precipitation and high levels of economic activity), a clear negative trend can be 
observed since 2004: on average, 24,940 km2 were deforested per year in 2002-04, 14,980 km2 in 2005-2007 and 
8,940 in 2008-2010.  
17 For example, in 2009, 1081 Brazilian municipalities experienced emergencies, mostly due to water shortages, 
particularly in the already water-scarce Northeast, but also several municipalities suffered extreme floods and 
landslides. This number increased to 1916 municipalities in 2010, and to 880 municipalities in the first half of 2011. 
18 Rising yields have been the dominant factor. Between 1978 and 2011, the cultivated area has increased 35% and 
the grain production raised 245.4%. Additionally, the Government has created incentives to recover degraded areas 
instead of expanding the agricultural frontier. Examples include the ABC program (Agricultura de Baixo Carbono - 
Low Carbon Agriculture program), Proflora, FCO Pronatureza, among other programs.

competitiveness agenda to the regions, mainstream climate change concerns and obtain tangible 
positive environmental outcomes while promoting sustainable development in the Amazon. 

37. 
The CR also finds the performance of the World Bank Group to be satisfactory. The 
CR considers the CPS design well aligned with the program of the second Lula administration 
and finds that the Government and the WBG succeeded in increasingly emphasizing knowledge 
intensive activities, sub-national lending and improved program performance. Despite having 
increased, Bank lending remained limited relative to the size of Brazil: in 2011 it was equivalent 
to 0.3% of total public expenditures. This size constraint limited the potential for the Bank to 
have a large direct development impact through its projects in Brazil. A conscious decision was 
thus made to maximize the Bank‘s catalytic and tactical role, by strongly emphasizing support to 
innovative interventions that, scaled-up, would provide benefits that could far exceed the direct 
impact of the original projects.  

38. 
Bank interventions focused on knowledge creation, not just knowledge transfer. In 
practice, this meant, on one hand, that the Bank‘s AAA program focused on partnering with 
leading local researchers to produce high quality country studies aimed at making substantive 
contributions to national policy debates. On the other hand, the Bank aggressively incorporated 
knowledge in its lending activities, focusing on ―how‖ rather than ―what‖ and often exploring 
new instruments to deliver improved results, including multi-sector result-focused operations 
(Box 1). These innovations in lending are having an impact in program design throughout the 
Bank (e.g. through the new policy for Municipal DPLs and the proposal for new Result-Based 
Lending instruments).  

Box 1: Sub-national Multi-Sector Operations for Complex Development Solutions 

Most recent operations supporting sub-national governments in Brazil have been multi-sector, 
aimed at addressing complex and multidimensional development challenges. Supporting these 
endeavors calls for concerted and well-articulated efforts in multiple areas and at all levels of 
government (Federal, State and Municipal). Multi-sector operations have also developed in 
response to Brazil‘s – and the Bank‘s – increased focus on results and outcomes. This calls for 
improved transparency and accountability across sectors as well as more robust overall 
governance frameworks. Working with several ministries, departments and agencies in the 
same operation allows the Bank to help strengthen the country‘s own fiduciary systems and 
public sector management frameworks more efficiently as well as building synergy across 
policies and programs. 

A few examples illustrate the advantages of multi-sector operations. In the State of Acre, the 
Social and Economic Inclusion project is using a territorial (spatial) approach to support the 
Government‘s efforts to promote social and economic inclusion of the most disadvantaged 
populations in both urban and isolated rural areas, covering interventions in health, education, 
natural resource management and agriculture. In Rio de Janeiro, the Fiscal Sustainability, 
Human Development and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan supported the 
Government in strengthening its policies and programs to improve fiscal management, 
competitiveness and delivery of health and education services. In Bahia, the Integrated Water 
and Health Management Project uses an innovative approach to reduce child mortality by 
increasing access to clean water, sanitation and basic health care in a coordinated manner.  

11 

 
 
 
 
39. 
Total IBRD lending under the CPS reached US$11.5 billion (in FY08-11), or about 
US$2.9 billion per year on average. This represents a sharp increase with respect to the 
previous CPS period (FY04-07), in which annual lending averaged US$1.2 billion. IFC also 
sharply expanded its activities in Brazil during the past CPS period. Commitments rose to 
US$4.0 billion in FY08-FY11, from US$1.48 billion in the previous four years. The 
Corporation‘s investment portfolio in Brazil now stands at US$2.18 billion, making it IFC‘s 
second largest global partner. Coordination between the IFC and the Bank around common 
strategic goals was strengthened, with the IFC program focused around strategic objectives and 
complementing financing with strategic advice. 

40. 
Three fourths of total commitments went to States and Municipalities. Still, the Bank 
retained a strong partnership with the Federal Government both directly and through its work at 
the sub-national level, often acting as an agent of the Federal Government in its efforts to 
improve sub-national fiscal sustainability and improve implementation of national policies. 
Special attention was given to strengthening project monitoring and impact evaluation (Box 2), 
to support the GoB‘s increasing focus on results and inform fine-tuning of policy frameworks.  

41. 
Program performance improved considerably. Halving the period between Concept 
Note discussion and project effectiveness enabled the Bank team to respond promptly to client 
requests. Further increases in the Bank‘s efficiency and responsiveness were achieved through 
the gradual adoption of country systems in selected States. Most Bank projects were evaluated 
by IEG as having satisfactory or better outcomes. 

42. 
Despite past successes, the CR finds room for improving the approach for working 
with all levels of government to achieve national outcomes. While Bank-supported projects in 
Brazil are having demonstration effects within and outside the country, the CR finds it advisable 
to strengthen the partnerships through (a) more systematic transmission of lessons, experience 
and learning within Brazil, either horizontally or working through the Federal level, (b) 
refocusing attention to supporting the fine tuning of national policy platforms building on the 
lessons learned at the State level, and (c) further supporting Brazil‘s role as leader in the South -
South dialogue by sharing the country‘s innovative development approaches with the rest of the 
world. The CR also identifies areas where major gaps remain to further increase the impact of 
the WGB engagement. These include the work on improving public sector efficiency and 
effectiveness at the Federal level, advancing the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) at all 
levels of government, further supporting efforts to enhance private sector productivity and 
competitiveness, and increasing support for Gender development. 

Findings from Recent IEG Evaluations 

43. 
IEG found the Bank’s strategy for State-level engagement in Brazil to be successful 
and identified areas for further improvement. In a January 2010 evaluation that also included 
three other large federated countries (Russia, India and Nigeria), IEG found that the Bank‘s 
engagement with high-performing states in Brazil has clearly helped strengthen in-State capacity 
and encouraged State-to-State knowledge transfers. IEG concurred with the Bank‘s strong focus 
on improving public sector management at the State level, as an entry point for broader multi-
sector engagements. Finally, IEG considers the Brazil Team‘s innovative approach embedded in 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
multi-sector SWAps to be a successful case with potential for generating knowledge spillovers to 
other member countries. Still, IEG recommended that going forward the Bank should, first, give 
more weight to the needs of the poorest states. Second, the evaluation suggests widening the 
scope and increasing the amount of analytical work at the State level. 

Box 2: Impact Evaluation - An Integral Part of the Knowledge and Innovation Agenda 

Impact evaluations (IEs) are a key component of Bank activities in Brazil, helping assess the 
effectiveness of innovative policies and programs and fine-tune them to increase their 
development impact. There are 20 ongoing Bank-supported IEs in Brazil, the largest number 
Bank-wide. To systematize and mainstream these efforts, the country team has created a multi-
sector Monitoring and Evaluation Group which leads the various IE programs. 

Management Capital, Financial Literacy and Formalization of Firms. The Bank is testing the 
impact of a large scale pilot financial literacy program on knowledge and intertemporal 
decision making of high school students and their parents. In Minas Gerais, the Bank is 
working with the Secretary of Planning to understand how an unprecedented simplification of 
registration procedures and the establishment of 29 one-stop shops are relaxing the constraints 
to formalization of small firms. Finally the Bank and the Ministry of Trade and Industry are 
starting to assess a policy to increase managerial knowledge in Brazilian firms. 

Agricultural Productivity, Smallholder Access 
to Markets and Natural Resources 
Management. A cluster of Bank projects are being evaluated to understand how the provision 
of technical assistance, extension services and financial resources help rural producer 
organizations and farmers be more productive and have better access to markets. On the 
natural resource management side, pilot payments for environmental services (PES) programs 
aimed at improving water quality by providing pecuniary payments to farmers in upstream 
basins are being evaluated in the states of São Paulo and Espírito Santo. These evaluations will 
inform the design of new PES programs. 

Teacher Performance and Early Childhood Development (ECD). The Bank is helping evaluate 
innovative "pay for performance" programs that link teacher bonuses to student learning 
outcomes in Pernambuco and in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the public 
delivery of creche care in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro.  The IE in Pernambuco has 
demonstrated that schools with more ambitious targets achieved more progress and that 
teachers who spent more time on instruction were much more likely to achieve the bonus.  The 
ECD program shows significant impacts on mothers‘ labor force participation; the evaluation 
will also measure the effects of the program on children‘s cognitive development.   

Social Protection and Poverty Eradication. As part of its support to the Bolsa Família 
conditional cash transfer program, the Bank has renewed its commitment to enhancing and 
consolidating the Government‘s capacity to monitor and evaluate social programs. At the 
GoB‘s request, the Bank will support the evaluation of the new Brasil sem Miséria program, 
which aims at reaching the 16 million people who remain in extreme poverty in the country. 

Stakeholder Consultations 

44. 
The IBRD and IFC country teams undertook consultations for the preparation of 
the CPS with numerous Federal, State and Municipal clients, the private sector and civil 
society, comprising approximately 100 direct 
interlocutors, 
including seven State 

13 

 
 
Governors. As the Bank program is increasingly at the sub-national level, consultations had a 
particular focus on State and Municipal clients and stakeholders. In all, the sub-national 
consultations represented all five regions of the country, accounting for over 70% of Brazilian 
GDP and 65% of the country‘s population. 

45. 
The consultations suggest that the WBG development support is very valued by 
most interlocutors. As detailed in Annex 1, counterparts see the WBG as a leading development 
institution and a key partner for Federal and sub-national governments. The Federal Government 
acknowledged the Bank‘s partnership and flexibility in shifting its focus to the sub-national 
governments during the previous CPS period, in response to Brazil‘s changing development 
outlook and in coordination with Government priorities – especially support to the Fiscal 
Responsibility Law framework. The government also highlighted the value of both knowledge 
and financial contributions to priority programs and requested that this joint focus be maintained 
for the new CPS. The WBG was requested to maintain a flexible approach in the new CPS, 
increase its use of country systems and reduce internal bureaucratic obstacles, especially when 
working with sub-national entities and in multi-sector operations.  

46. Many sub-national governments noted that the CPS is in close alignment and 
complements their own multi-annual programs, and will thus be an important help to 
achieve planned long-term results. They described the World Bank Group‘s involvement as 
essential for increasing fiscal space for investment, raising public management standards, 
developing multi-sector development strategies and building capacity in the poorest States. The 
WBG‘s support for innovation and path-setting development solutions was highly appreciated, 
but sub-national Governments highlight that the Bank‘s financial support remains a central part 
of the partnership. Civil society organizations and the private sector called on the Group to 
expand its policy to include more partners and voices in its operations from the beginning, 
providing inputs on program development and priority setting. Organizations also asked the 
WBG to help foster greater general transparency and inclusion from its government counterparts. 
CSOs acknowledged the Group‘s importance as a partner for social and environmental 
sustainability especially as Brazil steps up infrastructure investments in sensitive biomes, and 
called on the Group to support sustainable development capacity building and social control 
initiatives by local governments. Private sector representatives asked that the Bank address 
looming bottlenecks for Brazilian growth in education quality, job training and infrastructure, 
especially in lagging regions. 

B. Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy 

World Bank Partnership Strategy Overview 

47. 
The Government Program of President Dilma Rousseff provides the framework for 
the WBG’s CPS for Brazil. Building on the achievements of the past decade, President 
Rousseff intends to eradicate extreme poverty during her term, significantly increase Brazil‘s 
investment rate while maintaining macroeconomic stability, and further enhance Brazil‘s role in 
global policy debates. These are complex, second-generation challenges that require innovative 
and knowledge-intensive approaches. Likewise, building capacity for monitoring and evaluation 
and assessing development impacts will remain central to Brazil‘s goals and the Bank‘s support. 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
During the CPS period, the WBG will work in close coordination with the Federal and sub-
national governments and the private sector to contribute to the GoB‘s goal of achieving higher 
rates of inclusive and sustainable growth through four strategic objectives: 

a. Increase the efficiency of public and private investments, thus boosting growth capacity 
with job and income generation, especially in Brazil‘s poorer regions, with a special 
emphasis in the Northeast. Brazil has a huge potential, held back by intricate institutional 
challenges, not the least its highly decentralized structure. 
b. Improve the quality of public services for low income households, and expand their 
provision through public and private channels. Strengthening social protection and 
improving access to quality education, health and housing have proven to be major 
instruments for promoting Brazil‘s social and economic development by means of enhancing 
equity and expanding opportunities. Given President Rousseff‘s goal of eradicating extreme 
poverty, they are key aspects of the proposed CPS, together with an increased Gender focus. 
c. Promote regional economic development through 
improved policies, strategic 
infrastructure investments, and support for private sector actors in frontier regions. As 
the country prepares to reach a new growth and development level, special effort must be 
made to reduce regional inequalities, avoiding a drag down effect and closing the social and 
economic gap with the rest of the country. The WBG will place a renewed emphasis in 
supporting the Northeastern region. 
d. Further improve the sustainable management of natural resources and enhance 
resilience to climatic shocks while maximizing contributions to local economic 
development, and helping to meet rising global food demand. Brazil has made advances 
in managing the environmental effects of growth, but now needs to focus on long-term 
solutions to further capitalize on its natural resource assets in a sustainable way. Brazil also 
realizes the need to reduce the vulnerability of its territory (including coastal zones) to 
climate change (e.g. the growing risk of extreme climate events such as droughts and floods). 

48. 
The World Bank Group Program. The CPS identifies an IBRD lending program in the 
order of US$5.8 billion over FY12-13 (Table 2).19 Annual lending in FY12-13 would be in line 
with that observed under the FY08-11 CPS. It is worth noting that the proposed lending plan is 
indicative as IBRD‘s capacity to lend can change over time and, moreover, the approval of any 
project depends on the borrower‘s financial capacity, as assessed by Brazil‘s National Secretary 
of the Treasury, as well as on its compliance with other Federal Government requirements (as 
assessed by COFIEX). Moreover, the implementation of this plan depends on IBRD‘s Brazil 
exposure remaining under the current limit of US$16.5 billion as set out in the Single Borrower 
Limit (SBL) framework (see Annex 2). In FY11, Brazil had the largest single country new 
business program in the world for IFC. While IFC does not expect to increase investment 
volumes significantly, the nature of its involvement is changing toward (i) greater focus on 
smaller, more complex investments in poorer, frontier regions such as the Northeast and 
Amazon; (ii) helping innovative companies access new markets and develop new products, and 
to promote competition and South-South knowledge transfers, and (iii) increasing IFC's advisory 
support to sub-national Governments for developing PPPs in infrastructure, social sectors, and 
the environment. 

19 The projects listed in Table 2 are presented for indicative purposes only. Project size and contents are subject to 
review and approval by the WBG and the Federal Government.

Strategic Objectives and Result Areas 

49. 
The WBG program will comprise 14 core results areas across four strategic 
objectives within a framework of flexibility and adaptability. The goal is for the Bank to 
contribute to Brazil‘s aim of faster, more inclusive and more environmentally sustainable 
growth, with macroeconomic stability (Figure 2). The anticipated outcomes of this program 
presented below are the result of both ongoing activities and the new ones proposed in this CPS 
at the national, state, municipal, and private sector levels. The WBG group understands that the 
achievement of those outcomes depends to a large extent on the consolidation of a solid basis of 
managerial capabilities within the government. To foster this consolidation and to support the 
development of new management tools, mostly those related to risk management and the 
establishment of sound internal controls, the WBG aims to execute the 2012-2015 CPS in each 
one of the areas and strategic objectives with a special attention to the inclusion of components, 
products and activities aimed at addressing the Government‘s institutional development needs. 

Figure 2: Brazil FY12-15 CPS Strategic Objectives and Results Areas 

Objective 1: Increasing the Efficiency of Public and Private Investments 

50. 
Raising aggregate investment is a key GoB priority. During the last decade, Brazil has 
been able to consolidate fiscal discipline at the Federal and sub-national levels while 
accommodating increasing legally mandated social expenditures – e.g. in health, education and 
social security – and achieving significant social gains. Even though the GoB does not intend to

abandon this approach, one of its key priorities is to accelerate growth by significantly increasing 
both the quantity and the quality of public and private investments. To that end, one important 
challenge is that of expanding the volume and predictability of budgetary resources available for 
financing public investment without compromising fiscal sustainability or crowding out private 
investments. The Bank Group will support Brazil‘s efforts in this regard, by working mainly with 
selected sub-national Governments that are implementing innovative approaches for improving 
fiscal and public sector management with a view to increasing the ―fiscal space‖ for public 
investment and enhancing the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of Government programs. The 
approach will consist of supporting policy and institutional innovations at the State and 
Municipal levels that can be scaled up and which can generate demonstration effects at all levels 
of Government.  

Improving fiscal and public sector management 

51. 
Sub-national Governments have made important contributions to the improvement 
of Brazil’s fiscal position. The Bank has supported these efforts by helping selected states 
comply with the country‘s fiscal responsibility framework, expand fiscal space for increasing 
public investment and improve the delivery of basic social services. Going forward, further 
support will be provided to help the GoB consolidate, disseminate and deepen this first 
generation of fiscal and public sector management reforms. The Bank will use investment and 
development policy loans to support institutional changes and policy reforms (e.g. in Alagoas, 
Bahia, Pernambuco, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte in the Northeast, Tocantins in the Central 
region, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast, and Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in 
the South).  

52. 
Improved financial and broader public sector management is fundamental for 
efficient and transparent management of public resources in Brazil. As fiscal sustainability 
is being achieved, the focus of partners is increasingly on efficient administrative systems which 
allow resources to be allocated in a transparent and rule based framework, where managerial 
discretion is supported by accountability mechanisms. Greater transparency and accountability 
reduce the opportunities for corruption; well-managed public financial management systems with 
credible budgets reduce the need for ad hoc decisions and the opportunities for fraudulent 
practices. Finally, the ability to allocate resources according to priorities increases the legitimacy 
of government, and helps to increase tax compliance. Thus the Bank will focus on contributing 
to the following objectives: 

 Further improving public investment management by helping develop capacity to 
screen, select and appraise projects, as well as by enhancing the processes used to review 
project adjustments during implementation and perform final ex-post evaluations.  
 Improving tax administration by reducing the cost of tax compliance and enhancing tax 
enforcement, including by means of strengthening management and controls, redoubling 
overdue tax collection efforts, and updating taxpayer cadastres and property values.  
 Increasing the quality of personnel expenditures, by enhancing payroll management 
controls and by attracting and retaining staff with the right skills, including through 
support for the modernization of career structures and the increased use of strategic 
workforce planning. 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 Promoting a more analytical and strategic approach to procurement and a more 
efficient government supply chain management, 
including 
through standardized 
specifications and increased data analysis for procurement planning and policy-making, with 
a view to increasing value for money and transparency in government purchases, as well as 
by improving the management of inventories and integration of warehouses.20 
 Strengthening internal control functions so as to increase efficiency and accountability 
for resources, by helping develop modern and efficient internal controls which increasingly 
shift the focus from traditional compliance auditing to improving the quality of internal 
controls systems, with a view to promoting administrative efficiency and a culture of 
effective, transparent and accountable administration.  
 Enhancing fiscal consolidation by increasing the performance orientation of fiscal 
management, 
including 
through spending 
reviews, encompassing 
tax and other 
expenditures, and measures to rationalize tax rates and fiscal incentives. The ultimate 
objective would be that most policy decisions have ex-ante and ex-post reviews, to ensure 
both efficiency and efficacy in achieving their objectives.   
 Gradually shifting the focus of fiscal management from short to medium term issues by 
helping develop institutions and processes which allow policy makers to better take into 
account the future implications of current policy decisions. This will involve developing 
frameworks for the costing of new policy initiatives and major investment projects, to 
increase the transparency and coherence of expenditure decisions, and the efficiency of 
investments. 
 Integrating the management of debt and fiscal risks with fiscal policy, to minimize 
obligations and ensure that contingent liabilities are transparent and adequately 
provided for within the budgetary process. This would include the development of formal 
debt sustainability analyses and debt management strategies, which would be key inputs into 
the determination of medium budgetary expenditure envelopes. 
 Enhancing participatory mechanisms to incorporate citizen and regional perspectives 
in the policy making process, including through informed public debates aimed at 
identifying local problems and feasible solutions, helping determine priorities, building 
consensus, and strengthening accountability mechanisms between government and citizens.  
 Improving access to justice, judicial transparency and accountability, and enhancing 
geographic equality and equity in the offering of justice services, including through 
cooperation agreements signed with the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (Superior 
Tribunal de Justiça) and the National Justice Council (Conselho Nacional de Justiça). 
 Promoting the systematic use of performance information throughout the planning, 
budgeting and policy cycle, and the adoption of modern performance management 
techniques. The Bank will support efforts to better align strategic policy priorities with 
budgetary allocations, increase the focus on the results delivered with the resources provided, 
and emphasize individual and organizational responsibility and accountability for results. 

Enhancing Private Sector Development  

53. 
Although Brazil’s growth has been strong, the country still faces many challenges in 
increasing private 
sector 
investment, as well as enhancing productivity and 

20 See Blancas et al. (2011), Do Procurement Rules Impact Infrastructure Investment Efficiency? 

20 

 
 
 
                                                            
competitiveness, which will be key for accelerating growth.  The Bank Group can assist 
Brazil in the enhancement of private sector development through: 

 Expanding IFC financing for companies developing new products and processes, so as 
to enhance private sector innovation, competitiveness, and productivity growth, including by 
extending market linkages, financing acquisitions, and supporting cross-border investments.  
 Increasing IFC’s role in diffusing global best practices among its client companies in 
Brazil, by deploying industry specialists, supporting advisory work, and fostering greater 
knowledge-sharing between local companies and research universities. 
 Generating analytical work on the drivers of productivity growth and the impact of 
selected Government programs, mainly at sub-national level, as well as disseminating 
international experience on innovation policy.  
 Identifying sector-specific strategies for increasing real sector productivity, with a focus 
on SMEs, including by strengthening value-chain linkages in selected sectors.  
 Helping strengthen 
institutional and regulatory frameworks for public-private 
partnerships, using IFC‘s advisory services facility as well as the Bank‘s lending operations 
and fee-based services, and with a view to improve Government capacity to structure 
feasible, bankable transactions, better design and monitor PPP and concession contracts and 
reduce regulatory risks. 
 Identifying options for expanding long-term corporate and SME financing, by using the 
Bank‘s AAA agenda, including FSAP to be produced in FY12, and through IFC support for 
second-tier banks that focus on SMEs. 
 Assisting the GoB’s efforts to further promote financial inclusion, by providing technical 
assistance to regulatory agencies conducting policy evaluation work, helping incorporate 
financial inclusion in social protection programs, and providing IFC financing to specialist 
banks, non-banks, and insurance carriers that focus on MSMEs, low-income communities, 
and underserved peri-urban and frontier regions.  
 Providing technical assistance and advisory services to support policies that remove 
microeconomic barriers to firms’ entry, competition and exit, including at the sub-
national level.   

Objective 2: Improving the provision of public services for low income households 

54. 
The GoB’s goal of eradicating extreme poverty calls for coordinated interventions 
across multiple sectors and at all levels of Government. The ambitious ―Brasil sem Miséria‖ 
program (BSM) focuses, on one hand, on expanding the coverage of social programs to reach the 
country‘s most vulnerable populations. To that end, the GoB will devote renewed efforts, at the 
three levels of Government, to identify, map and actively engage with those currently excluded, 
by linking them to the supply of various social services, depending on their specific needs. The 
GoB will also further strengthen the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer program, the 
world‘s largest and one of the best regarded in terms of coverage and targeting.  

55. On the other hand, the GoB is placing a strong emphasis on providing opportunities 
for all Brazilian to have dignified and productive lives. This requires going beyond ensuring 
access to minimum levels of income and basic services. It implies focusing on further improving 
the human capital, income generation capacity and living conditions of low income populations. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
Thus, while the BSM program will be coordinated by the Ministry of Social Development 
(MDS), it will be implemented by a much wider set of entities at all levels of Government. At the 
Federal level, BSM will involve the Ministries of Agriculture, Cities, Education, Health and 
Labor, among others. The Bank Group will support Brazil in its efforts to meet its various very 
ambitious social goals by focusing on helping strengthen the country‘s social protection system, 
improve the coverage and quality of education and health services, and expand access to 
affordable housing by the poor. The WBG will also devote increasing attention to supporting 
efforts to promote gender inclusion. 

56. 
As in other areas of engagement, given the limited size of Bank resources in 
comparison with the GoB’s own budget, its role in this strategic area will be mainly 
catalytic. The focus will be, on one hand, on providing selective knowledge intensive 
contributions for the design of national policies. On the other hand, the Bank will support 
implementation of those policies by selected sub-national partners, often in the context of multi-
sector projects. In this regard, the Bank will seek to improve policy coordination within and 
across levels of Government and generate best practices whose replication can produce spillover 
effects beyond the original Bank-supported projects.  

Consolidating and strengthening social protection 

57. 
Bolsa Família is at the core of the GoB’s social protection strategy. Created by fusing 
together several pre-existing income support programs, it now reaches about 12 million 
beneficiary families (48 million people, about 25% of the population) with a budget that amounts 
to about 0.4% of Brazil‘s GDP. A series of studies have confirmed its strong targeting outcomes 
and significant impact on poverty, including contributing to 20% of the overall reduction of 
poverty and inequality since 2001. Going forward, however, the GoB aims at reaching an 
additional 800,000 eligible families by 2013. Moreover, thanks to an increase in the cap for 
variable benefits – from 3 to 5 children up to 15 years – the GoB plans to incorporate 1.3 million 
new children in the program.  

58. 
Sub-national governments play an important role in the implementation of social 
protection programs. Municipalities are tasked with identifying eligible households, processing 
beneficiary applications and monitoring beneficiaries‘ compliance with co-responsibilities in 
health and education. Especially in poor regions, State Governments also play a key role by 
providing complementary social services and helping build the capacity of Municipalities to 
perform their respective functions. The Bank Group can help Brazil in its efforts to strengthen 
national social protection policies and improve the coordination with sub-national levels of 
Government through:  

 Generating analytical work on poverty dynamics, including Gender-related issues, in 
partnership with MDS with a view to produce relevant inputs for fine-tuning the design of 
poverty reduction programs.  
 Partnering with national and sub-national governments in the monitoring and 
evaluation of selected components of Brasil sem Miséria, including Bolsa Família but also 
programs aimed at improving labor income opportunities for extremely poor families in rural 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
and urban areas – e.g. by enhancing worker skills and small farmer productivity – as well as 
programs geared towards increasing women‘s economic empowerment. 
 Helping MDS further strengthen Bolsa Família, including by improving its beneficiary 
identification system (Cadastro Único) and the program‘s governance (e.g. with actions on 
payments systems and Municipal co-responsibilities).  
 Supporting selected sub-national governments in the implementation of BSM, especially 
in poor regions of the country (e.g. in the states of Alagoas and Bahia).  

Improving the quality of education, especially for the poor 

59. Having achieved large improvements in access to basic education, the GoB is 
focusing on raising student learning, enhancing the vocational and technical education 
system, and increasing participation of the poor in tertiary education. Despite sustained 
progress in raising learning performance in basic education during the last decade, attainment is 
still far from the average learning levels, secondary education completion rates, and student flow 
efficiency of OECD and other middle-income countries. To address the challenge of raising 
student learning outcomes among low income households, the GoB is combining preventive and 
remedial interventions. Among the former, one important priority has been expanding early 
childhood education (ECD) services for low-income families (creche and pre-school), to avoid 
the development of potentially chronic cognitive deficits. Remedial interventions include 
tutoring and accelerated learning programs. To help meet the growing private sector demand for 
workers with strong analytical skills and improve the labor market insertion of the poor, the GoB 
is also significantly expanding the availability of vocational and technical education. It is also 
expanding financial support to enable high-performing students from low-income families to 
attend private and public universities, through grants and quotas. The Bank Group can support 
Brazil in this area by: 

 Continuing to expand IFC financing for private sector post-secondary institutions 
focused on low- and middle-income students, either through direct financing of colleges, 
or by backing providers of student loans. IFC‘s investments are also aimed at accelerating 
consolidation in a fragmented system, to raise standards, lower costs, and extend these 
colleges‘ networks to smaller cities in the interior.  
 Partnering with the Ministry of Education (MEC) in strengthening Brazil’s ECD 
policies, by focusing on critical normative and oversight functions (e.g. curriculum 
guidelines, teacher and facility standards).  
 Supporting selected large municipalities in the design, implementation and impact 
evaluation of pilot ECD programs targeted to low income households, focusing on 
innovative approaches with major potential demonstration effects (e.g. in Recife and Rio de 
Janeiro).  
 Partnering with MEC and selected sub-national Governments, respectively through 
AAA and implementation support, in tackling key issues of education quality, that are 
not fully addressed by current policies. These include approaches to improve teacher quality, 
repetition rates, age-grade distortions, and secondary education quality.  
 Producing analytical work focused on generating options for improving the quality and 
efficiency of the vocational and technical education system.  

23 

 
 
 
 
 
Improving access to health care for low income households 

60. 
Despite significant progress during the past 20 years, insufficient coverage of health 
promotion, prevention and treatment among the poorest groups remains a challenge. While 
Brazil has a good track record of reaching the poor with primary health care services through the 
Family Health Program (PSF) established in 1994, 35% of individuals with per capita income 
less than one fourth of the minimum wage still lack coverage. Moreover, coordination of care 
across clinical and organizational settings is still limited, which has a particularly deleterious 
effect on the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. To address these challenges, the 
Ministry of Health, in coordination with sub-national governments, is undertaking significant 
efforts to increase PSF coverage and health promotion and prevention for the most vulnerable 
groups. Together with States and Municipalities, the Ministry is also working to develop regional 
integrated health care networks that encompass public health, primary health care and medium 
and high complexity care facilities (hospitals). Finally, the GoB is working to promote 
improvements in hospital management with a view to improving the efficiency of the Unified 
Health System (SUS).  

61. 
The GoB is also seeking to sustain efforts to tackle HIV/AIDS. In the past decade, 
while the incidence of AIDS has declined in the Southeast region of Brazil (from about 25 to 20 
per 100,000), it has increased substantially in all other regions, particularly in the North (from 
about 7 to 20 per 100,000) and in the Northeast (from about 6 to 14 per 100,000). The 
government is currently developing and implementing prevention programs that are appropriate 
given the changing epidemic, while also seeking to ensure care and treatment for infected 
individuals. The Bank Group is well placed to support the GoB‘s efforts in the area of access to 
health care through: 

 Helping improve quality assurance mechanisms for the PSF and conduct evaluations of 
the impact of basic health programs on health status, in partnership with the Federal and 
selected sub-national Governments, and including women‘s health issues.  
 Developing mechanisms and incentives to improve access to the PSF among vulnerable 
groups – e.g. indigenous populations and quilombolas. 
 Identifying options to strengthen linkages between public health, primary health care 
and more complex levels of care, especially by developing processes of referral between the 
PSF and medium and high complexity health facilities. 
 Supporting improvements in emergency care by selected sub-national Governments and 
helping improve its integration with the PSF. 
 Supporting increased access and utilization of HIV/AIDS and STD prevention, care and 
treatment by Groups Most at Risk, and to strengthened decentralized implementation, 
governance, and results-based management of the national HIV/AIDS and STD program. 
 Expanding health-oriented PPPs and IFC investments in providers of diagnostic and 
health services designed to serve poor and middle-income groups. 
 Generating strategic analytic work on broader health financing and health system 
reform issues, building on the Bank‘s operational engagement at the Federal and local 
levels.   

24 

 
 
 
   
 
Expanding affordable housing and improving living conditions for low-income and 
vulnerable groups  

62. 
In 2000, over 12 million people or 3.2 million households lived in precarious housing 
within slums (favelas) in Brazil. The country‘s housing deficit is estimated to be 7 million units 
today and new demand is forecast to reach 23 million units by 2023. About 80% of households 
living in precarious conditions and one third of the housing deficit are concentrated in Brazil‘s 
11 largest metropolitan areas. Addressing these challenges is a top GoB priority. During 2011-
2014 the Federal Government plans to invest US$19 billion in PAC Favelas, the world‘s largest 
slum upgrading program, and almost US$45 billion in the Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV) 
program of housing subsidies for low and middle income households. Through MCMV‘s Phase 
II, the GoB aims at delivering 2 million new housing units for low income households by 2014, 
through a combination of upfront household subsidies, loan repayment guarantees, tax incentives 
for developers and reduction in insurance costs. In addition, the GoB is deploying multiple 
initiatives to increase its outreach to vulnerable populations and improve their living conditions. 
The Government is scaling up successful initiatives to prevent crime and violence and enhance 
service delivery and socio-economic inclusion with a focus on favela dwellers. It is also further 
emphasizing protection and promotion of indigenous peoples and lands, increasingly targeting 
other vulnerable populations (e.g. 
the rural 
landless, Afro-Brazilians and quilombola 
communities) in rural development and other social programs, and strengthening social 
development and safeguards within PAC. The Bank Group can support Brazil in this area by: 

 Identifying options for expanding access to capital markets as a funding source for 
housing loans and improve the effectiveness of housing subsidies, through technical 
assistance to the Federal Government. 
 Building up IFC’s portfolio of low-income housing projects, by providing longer-term 
financing for developers and construction companies.  
 Helping selected sub-national Governments use urban development regulatory 
instruments in a more effective way, so as to improve the functioning of housing and 
land markets, for instance through special zoning procedures for social housing (―ZEIS‖) 
and the provision of land, infrastructure and/or other incentives to enable PPPs in the 
provision of low-income housing. 
 Supporting greater integration and coordination between complementary urban 
development policies in the areas of land use, housing, transport and disaster risk 
management, in partnership with selected State and Municipal Governments.  
 Helping increase the sustainability of slum upgrading investments and consolidate the 
achievements of crime and violence prevention initiatives, including gender-based-
violence, by strengthening policies and implementation capacity for integrated social 
development work within the corresponding national and sub-national programs. 
 Helping revitalize economic activity in the favelas through IFC engagements with a 
network of social entrepreneurs to make impact investments in a sustainable manner in 
these neighborhoods.  IFC will support commercially viable projects as they emerge, both 
to demonstrate and replicate their success. 
 Strengthening involuntary resettlement policies and directives in federally funded 
housing and urban projects, to ensure that infrastructure and urban development programs 
do not leave some community members worse off. 

25 

 
 
 
 Testing new approaches for removing barriers for the socio-economic inclusion of 
extremely poor and vulnerable communities, including through JSDF grants to support 
quilombolas and waste picker communities, and non-lending technical assistance for the 
entity in charge of indigenous policies.  

Objective 3: Promoting regional economic development  

63. 
There are very large differences in levels of economic development across the 
regions of Brazil. Per capita household income in the North and Northeast are respectively 70% 
and 64% of the national average. There are also significant regional inequalities within the richer 
states of Brazil‘s South and Southeast. This can be exemplified by the much lower levels of 
income and opportunities found in some rural areas of northern Minas Gerais or central Paraná, 
and in the periphery of Brazil‘s large metropolitan regions, including São Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro.  

64. 
To address the challenge of promoting regional economic development (RED), the 
GoB is adopting a two-pronged strategy. On one hand, Federal and State Governments are 
using a territorial approach to improve coordination in the planning and implementation of social 
programs targeted at the poorest rural areas of the country. On the other hand, the GoB is 
deploying public infrastructure investment programs to increase access to basic services in 
lagging regions. The goal is to improve living conditions in lagging and remote areas but also to 
use public infrastructure investments to generate additional economic opportunities (e.g. through 
the attraction of private investments as well as increased productivity and access to markets). 
The Bank Group will seek to contribute to the GoB‘s efforts to promote regional economic 
development by supporting improvements in policy coordination at the territorial level, as well 
as the deployment of targeted infrastructure investment in the areas of basic sanitation, transport 
and energy. In this regard, the Bank will prioritize development projects aimed at supporting the 
Northeastern region of Brazil (Box 3). IFC efforts in private infrastructure will focus on 
mitigating transportation and logistics bottlenecks, improving the efficiency and usage of water, 
and support for smaller, renewable energy projects such as wind farms in the Northeast. 

Improving policy coordination at the territorial level 

65. 
Brazil’s territorial approach has proven effective in channeling the coordinated 
planning and implementation of Federal and State programs, with perceived efficiency and 
effectiveness gains obtained through their joint interaction. In particular, the Territórios da 
Cidadania program, launched in 2008, delineated 120 territorial units across Brazil covering 
1,851 municipalities (out of 5,565 in all of Brazil) with populations of less than 50,000 
inhabitants, and allocated R$65 billion to promote regional economic development through 
coordinated interventions in those areas. Similar approaches are being used to promote the 
development of economic clusters in urban areas (Arranjos Produtivos Locais) as well as to 
improve employment opportunities and the coordination of service delivery in a demand-driven 
approach in high poverty areas of large metropolitan regions (e.g. in Rio de Janeiro‘s favelas 
through the UPP Social program). The Bank Group can support these efforts through: 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Help selected State Governments design and implement innovative sustainable rural 
development programs with a territorially integrated approach, including in the North 
(Acre), Northeast (Ceará, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte) and South (Paraná, Santa 
Catarina). These programs will emphasize rural productive inclusion through increased 
family farm productivity and market access. They will also attempt to integrate rural poverty 
reduction and improved natural resource management objectives. 
 Support improved incentives and capacity building activities at the State level to 
promote cluster development in urban areas. 

Box 3: A renewed partnership with the Northeast, Brazil's poorest region 

The Brazilian Northeast (NE) comprises nine states covering 1.6 million sq. km (size of 
Germany, France and Italy combined). With approximately 55 million people, it represents 
29% of Brazil‘s population but only about 14% of its GDP. More than two thirds of Brazil‘s 
rural poor live in the Northeast, mostly in semi-arid zones with poor soils. Education 
performance is poor, with an average of only 5 years of formal schooling and 22% illiteracy 
rates. The region‘s seaboard is prone to flooding, while the interior suffers from droughts. 

In line with the Government‘s national program to eradicate extreme poverty , approximately 
US$ 2.5 billion in Bank loans are envisaged in the Northeast for FY 12 and FY13. IFC also 
plans to double its Northeast program in FY12, in line with its strategic focus on frontier 
regions. IFC has a portfolio of US$280 million and 28 projects in the Northeast. This represents 
13% of the Corporation‘s non-trade finance portfolio.  

The new WBG engagement will capitalize on the region‘s recent growth - which is above 
national averages - and a shared political drive across the states for economic inclusion and job 
creation, especially in the semi-arid interior. Among the top concerns are water infrastructure 
and management, rural economic inclusion, improving the quality of public services, especially 
education and health, and Gender development.  

Given the NE‘s historical development gaps, the Bank has long been a partner to the region, 
and the new CPS will redouble this focus. Starting in 1993, the Bank built an extensive 
program of Community Driven Rural Development, resulting in over 50,000 community 
investments for 11 million beneficiaries. The new CPS will leverage these earlier operations 
and the social capital they forged toward a new generation of projects that will help raise 
agricultural productivity, increase the efficient use of scarce water, and promote climate change 
resilience. Bank support will also encompass the areas of public sector management, private 
sector development, infrastructure and environmental management.  

With IFC, the Bank will continue encouraging investment in anchor enterprises and pre-export 
finance and facilitating contacts between buyers and producers. IFC will also make increasing 
use of its advisory services and public-private project (PPP) facility with BNDES, including for 
supporting public-private partnerships. In addition, the WBG will pay enhanced attention to 
improving gender and youth inclusion.  

Expanding access to improved basic sanitation 

66. 
Although water supply coverage in Brazil has been steadily increasing, more than 
15% of the population still lacks access to clean water (67% in rural areas) and almost 

27 

 
 
 
 
28% does not have access to wastewater collection (74% in rural areas). Access to solid 
waste collection is higher, reaching 88% of the population. However, 43% of collected solid 
waste is improperly disposed in dumpsites and only about 35% of wastewater is treated. To 
address these challenges, the GoB has launched an ambitious program, Água para Todos, aimed 
at ultimately universalizing access to clean water and sewage services. Similarly, in the wake of 
2010 legislation, the Government has significantly strengthened the legal and regulatory 
framework for the solid waste sector, setting clear responsibilities and ambitious targets for 
governments, consumers and companies. Budgeted investments by the Federal Government in 
the area of basic sanitation reach almost US$22 billion for 2011-2014. This includes US$8.1 
billion for improving access to clean water and US$13.8 for expanding sewage collection and 
treatment, and improving solid waste disposal. The Bank Group can support Brazil in this area 
through: 

 Supporting the strengthening of Government capacity to perform regulatory and 
policymaking functions, including investment planning and monitoring. To this end, the 
Bank will engage with the Federal Government by means of the InterÁguas Project, which 
involves the Ministries of Environment, Cities and National Integration and seeks to promote 
inter-institutional synergies and coordination. Through this project, the Bank will also 
support improved coordination with sub-national Governments, to be complemented with 
direct engagements with selected states (e.g. Bahia, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Pernambuco, Rio 
Grande do Norte, Sergipe and São Paulo). 
 Helping develop an integrated approach to water resources management and water 
supply and sanitation (IWRM-WSS), involving actions in the areas of basin management, 
urban development and upgrading, housing, disaster risk management (as most disaster risks 
in Brazil are flood-related), and poverty alleviation. 
 Helping develop targeted results-based water subsidies aimed at improving sustainable 
access to safe water among the poor, especially in underserved areas. 
 Supporting efficiency improvements and promoting the use of innovative technologies 
and service delivery models, through Bank support and IFC financing for sub-national 
utilities and private sector companies, mobilizing funds from participating investors, and 
technical assistance for PPP projects. 
 Helping the Federal Government deploy an innovative and integrated approach to 
support municipalities in implementing and enforcing the Solid Waste Law, including 
through public consortia and the use of Carbon Finance and a financial intermediation 
program with Caixa Econômica Federal. 
 Supporting private investments in the sanitary disposal of solid waste through IFC 
financing and PPP mandates, e.g. for companies engaged in operating public landfills and 
generating power with landfill gas emissions. 

Improving transport infrastructure and management 

67. 
Currently, logistics costs represent about 15 to 18% of GDP, nearly twice the 9% 
average cost in OECD countries. Improving transport and logistics supply chains is therefore 
critical both to increase export competitiveness and to promote economic development in lagging 
regions. At the same time, transport is the fastest growing source of GHG emissions, and an 
important source of local pollutants and other negative externalities. In urban areas, in particular, 

28 

 
 
 
 
increased motorization and insufficient high-quality public transport are contributing to ever-
increasing congestion and accidents, as well as reducing city competitiveness. Similarly, intercity 
passenger transport suffers from congested infrastructures and scarce and unreliable accessibility 
to remote areas of the country. To address these various challenges, the GoB has recently 
updated its National Plan for Logistics and Transport (PNLT), which has among its main 
objectives contributing to improving the efficiency of productive sectors, helping reduce regional 
inequality and progressively rebalancing Brazil‘s transport matrix. Within this framework, 
several States are developing State transport and logistics plans, and undertaking initiatives to 
improve urban mobility and tackle intercity transport issues. Sub-national investments are been 
backed by large Federal programs under PAC, which has budgeted US$80.3 billion for the 
transport sector in 2011-2014, including US$15 billion for urban areas. The Bank Group can 
support Brazil in this area by: 

 Helping improve management in the transport sector, by supporting mainstreamed and 
integrated transport and logistics initiatives at the Federal and State levels, with a focus 
on expanding governance, overall efficiency and greener transport.  
 Providing technical assistance for the development of priority multi-modal transport 
corridors, such as the São Francisco corridor encompassing several Northeast States and 
including highway, railway and waterway transportation. 
 Further expanding IFC investments and technical assistance in transport infrastructure 
projects, including in rail, airport and port projects and through support for PPPs in 
highways and airports.   
 Supporting enhancements in urban transport governance, focusing on integrating 
transport in the broader context of city planning for equitable and sustainable development. 
 Supporting the development of affordable and sustainable rural transport solutions. 

Increasing the supply of clean and efficient energy services 

68. 
Thanks to the large share of hydro power and biomass in electricity generation, and to the 
use of ethanol in passenger vehicles, 47% of Brazil‘s energy comes from renewable sources. As 
per the Government‘s Ten Year Energy Plan (PDE-2019), Brazil will continue exploring options 
for further increasing the participation of renewable sources in its energy matrix – both in the 
power and the transportation sectors – as well as for enhancing demand side energy efficiency in 
industrial and residential sectors. The Bank Group can support the country‘s efforts by: 

 Helping strengthen Brazil’s policy and regulatory framework for the energy sector, 
with a view to promote the supply of cost-effective and sustainable energy to meet the 
evolution of demand in the medium and long-term, by supporting the development and 
implementation of various sector and sub-sector plans and improving regulators‘ capacity to 
monitor and control the power sector. 
 Financing investments in research and development (R&D) of cutting edge technologies 
to transport efficiently and reliably large blocks of energy across continent-wide 
distances. 
 Supporting energy diversification by providing IFC financing for gas-fired plants, wind 
projects, selected ethanol producers, and the development of new second generation 
biofuel feedstock such as wood fiber.  

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 Helping increase energy efficiency by improving the operational, commercial, and 
financial performance of six distribution companies in the North and Northeast, and 
through IFC advisory work and investments in financial institutions, industry and 
housing projects.  

Objective 4: Improving sustainable natural resource management and climate resilience 

69. 
Brazil is among the countries with the world’s largest endowments of water, arable 
land and mineral resources. The country is also the repository of an immense quantity of 
biodiversity content and it has among the world‘s biggest stocks of forest carbon. Managing 
these resources in a sustainable way, combining conservation with the promotion of local and 
regional economic development implies significant policy and institutional challenges. Through 
its Amazon Initiative, the Bank Group has been taking important steps in this direction (Box 4), 
generating results that now merit the mainstreaming of the approach in other regions of Brazil – 
e.g. in the sensitive Cerrado savannah region of Central Brazil.  

Box 4: The Amazon: Conservation with development and opportunities 

The Amazon, the world‘s biggest rainforest and home to an estimated 25% of the globe‘s 
biodiversity is also where twenty-four million Brazilians live. This population needs 
opportunities and services, but in an environmentally sensitive context. Responding to demands 
from Federal and local governments, the FY08-11 CPS developed an Amazon Framework, 
widely discussed with government, academia, private sector and civil society. Under the 
Framework, 
the WBG program has adopted a multipronged approach, emphasizing 
conservation, sustainable natural resource management, land tenure regulation and low impact 
agriculture, as well as a strong focus on public policies for improved environmental 
management and licensing, and improved access to basic services and employment 
opportunities for the local population.  

Some examples of the results achieved include the establishment by main national retailers of 
landmark sustainable production chains requirements for beef and soy from the region and, in 
the State of Acre, the creation of more than 120,000 school openings, expanded family health 
services to 75% of rural families, and a 30% increase in sustainable production from 
cooperatives and farmer associations. The Amazon Framework also informed the Sustainable 
Environmental Management DPL, which helped improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 
Brazil‘s environmental management system, including controlling deforestation in the Amazon, 
and further integrate principles of environmentally sustainable development in natural resource 
management and conservation in Brazil‘s National Development Bank (BNDES). Several GEF 
projects have also been implemented under the Framework, including the second phase of the 
Amazon Region Protected Areas Project, which will consolidate a system of protected areas 
totaling over 50 million hectares, an area the size of France. 

70. 
The increasing evidence on the potential impacts of climate change further 
complicates the challenges associated with natural resource management. On one hand, 
Brazil‘s strong leadership in the global efforts to mitigate climate change call for an additional 
focus of public policies on facilitating carbon sequestration and the adoption of agricultural 
technologies with a lower intensity in GHG emissions. On the other hand, effectively adapting to 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the various impacts of climate change calls for putting an additional focus on enhancing the 
resilience of economic activities and infrastructure investments to increasingly frequent extreme 
weather events. The Bank Group can contribute to Brazil‘s efforts to tackle these various 
challenges by supporting further improvements in water resource management, helping increase 
the sustainability of agriculture, supporting the strengthening of environmental management and 
helping the GoB deploy more effective tools to manage natural disaster risks. 

Strengthening Integrated Water Resources Management 

71. 
Ensuring a sustainable use of water resources in the long run is a top priority of the 
Brazilian Government. The country is endowed with 19% of the freshwater resources of the 
world. Improving the management of these resources, with an emphasis on their multipurpose 
and sustainable use is an increasingly important policy objective for the GoB, particularly in the 
arid Northeast states where water is scarce. Thus, over the past 15 years, Brazil has made 
considerable efforts to strengthen the water sector‘s legal and institutional framework to promote 
the integrated management of water resources. The GoB has a two-pronged strategy to deepen 
this policy agenda by combining further institutional strengthening actions at all levels of 
government with large investments in water infrastructure and the provision of basic services. To 
this end, the GoB plans to use both public resources ($7.5 billion at the Federal level alone, for 
2011-2014) and partnerships with the private sector, especially in the area of irrigation. Brazil 
has large untapped irrigation potential, since it has the land and water resources to irrigate about 
30 million ha of arable land (outside the protected areas); currently only 13% of this capacity is 
being used. The Bank Group is well placed to support Brazil in these endeavors by means of: 

 Helping strengthen institutional capacity for improving water resource planning at the 
Federal and sub-national levels, especially in the Northeast (e.g. Bahia, Ceará, 
Pernambuco and Sergipe), to improve Government capacity to make a sound selection of 
investment alternatives, optimize the use of scarce resources and further support the GoB‘s 
multipurpose strategy. 
 Supporting the implementation of modern water resources management tools, such as 
basin plans, water charges, output-based subsidies and performance-based incentives, and 
including through IFC investments and PPP projects.  
 Helping the GoB in its efforts to better coordinate its various programs in the water 
sector, including at the Federal and State levels, and involving the Ministries of 
Integration, Cities and Environment, the National Water Agency (ANA), and State Water 
Secretariats. 
 Supporting the development of innovative long-term irrigation approaches on a 
sustainable basis in partnership with the private sector, using Bank and IFC investment 
and advisory services and focusing on the semi-arid areas of Brazil. 

Expanding sustainable agriculture 

72. 
The GoB has announced the Low Carbon Agriculture program,21 aimed at 
improving environmental sustainability in the agriculture and livestock sectors. These 

21 ―Agricultura de Baixo Carbono‖ (ABC). 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
sectors play a very important role in the Brazilian economy: agriculture and associated 
processing industries account for over 25% of GDP, about 40% of exports and more than 17 
million jobs. Brazil is also responding to increasingly stringent sustainability requirements in 
developed country markets. Furthermore, Brazil is already a major exporter of staple foodstuffs 
but needs to increase output to help meet growing world food demand. The government also 
understands that enhancing sustainable agriculture can protect Brazil‘s rich biodiversity and help 
achieve its ambitious GHG emissions targets. The Bank Group can support the GoB‘s efforts in 
this area through: 

 Supporting the adjustment of extension services and the leveraging of financing 
mechanisms to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon agriculture and livestock 
production, including scaling-up zero tillage agriculture and further combining increased 
livestock productivity with enhanced forest protection. 
 Supporting the mapping of degraded areas across all Brazilian biomes and helping 
develop financial incentives to promote their rehabilitation, including for use in 
agricultural, forestry, ranching conservation, and environmental services. 
 Using IFC’s agribusiness investments and advisory services to expand farm output on a 
sustainable basis. Additional IFC initiatives include dissemination of sustainable beef and 
soy production standards, improved traceability of Amazon cattle herds, and improved 
environmental permitting procedures. IFC is also working through banks and suppliers to 
broaden access to finance, inputs, and insurance for small and medium-sized farms. 
 Supporting increased sustainability of agricultural production and forestry in the 
Cerrado, including through IFC investments as well as GEF and Carbon financing projects 
that are enabling local communities, civil society and the private sector to participate actively 
in policy formulation and implementation.  
 Helping develop options for increasing agricultural resilience to climate change, by 
generating analytical work to inform policy making and working with selected states and 
organized rural producers to support the adoption of climate-smart practices and 
technologies.  
 Helping develop sustainable forest management through IFC advisory services, and 
Bank support for enhancing the corresponding policy and regulatory framework. 

Improving environmental management, biodiversity conservation and climate change 
mitigation 

73. 
Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Brazil’s environmental management 
system is a key GoB priority. Indeed, progress in this front is paramount if Brazil is to face, in 
an environmentally sustainable way, the challenges that economic growth imposes in terms of 
greater natural resource use and growing infrastructure investments. In addition, further 
improving environmental policies and institutions is a necessary step for helping mitigate climate 
change and to enhancing the resilience of Brazil‘s natural and physical capital to its various 
impacts. The complexity of these challenges is particularly high in the case of Brazil, due to the 
country‘s continental dimensions, the decentralized nature of its environmental management 
framework, and the fact that a number of states and most small municipalities still lack the 
capacity to take over some of their respective regulatory functions. The Bank Group and the GoB 

32 

 
 
 
 
have long partnered to strengthen environmental management at the three levels of Government. 
Going forward, the Bank Group can support Brazil in this area through: 

 Helping identify options for institutional reform aimed at further clarifying the roles 
and responsibilities of the three tiers of government in environmental management. 
 Supporting efforts by the Federal and selected sub-national Governments to further 
strengthen and integrate their environmental management systems, including at the 
metropolitan level, and ensure environmental compliance in rural areas, including 
through the implementation of Rural Environmental Registries, and other mechanisms which 
monitor compliance in the forest, agricultural and livestock productive chains. 
 Helping improve the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental licensing and 
monitoring systems, including by means of more transparent and user-friendly tools to 
speed up the licensing approval process and social participation and control , as well as the 
adoption of new environmental assessment instruments. 
 Assisting GoB efforts to further develop Brazil’s national system of protected areas, 
with an increased focus on reducing emissions from deforestation and land degradation 
(REDD) and environmental compensation mechanisms. 
 Supporting the use of the Ecological Economic Zoning (EEZ) land use planning tool, 
including in – but not restricted to – the context of rural development programs, using the 
approach employed in the nine Amazon States under the PPG-7 Program, but also promoting 
the integration between territorial and coastal zoning. 
 Helping the Federal government and the private sector to implement Brazil’s National 
Climate Change Plan, including through developing programs and financial mechanisms to 
promote sustainable land use, decrease deforestation, and increase energy efficiency and 
renewable energy. 
 Supporting efforts to develop and implement strategies for promoting low carbon 
growth and climate change mitigation action plans at the city level, via policy advice, 
technical assistance, and selected investments in innovative interventions to pursue greater 
integration of urban transport, land use planning and housing, promote green urban transport, 
and improve planning and investment coordination at the metropolitan region level. 

Increasing the effectiveness of disaster risk management 

74. 
The GoB has recently initiated the development of a comprehensive national 
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) program. While Brazil has traditionally focused on post-
disaster response, namely through the civil defense system, recent events have prompted Federal 
and State Governments to take a more proactive role in addressing the problem. In particular, the 
floods and landslides in Rio and the Northeast in 2010 and 2011, as well as the evidence on the 
potential future increase in their frequency and severity as a result of climate change, have led to 
an increased focus on reducing the country‘s vulnerability to adverse natural events. Responding 
to this challenge will require implementing a comprehensive and effective disaster prevention 
and mitigation system. While there are isolated Disaster Risk Management (DRM) initiatives – 
e.g. at the Ministry of Cities, focusing on reducing landslide risks – an effective disaster 
prevention and mitigation system will require the scaling up of such interventions, their 
extension to other hazards and achieving additional coordination across agencies and levels of 
government. The Bank Group can support the GoB‘s efforts in this area through: 

33 

 
 
 
 
 Supporting the Federal government in its efforts to build capacity at the State and 
Municipal level for outlining local strategies for reducing natural disaster risks, 
including landslides, floods and strong wind hazards. 
 Helping strengthen the preparedness of civil defense systems to cope with natural 
disasters and the coordination of post disaster response, including through the preparation 
of comprehensive contingency plans. 
 Providing financial and technical support to the Federal and selected sub-national 
Governments to revamp Brazil’s forecasting and early warning system, under the 
leadership of the Ministry of Science and Technology, and including through the improved 
networking of existing systems. 
 Supporting efforts to better map and identify risk areas incorporating vulnerability and 
susceptibility aspects, and focusing on building local probabilistic risk modeling capacity. 
 Deploying IFC’s insurance and risk management products in Brazil, with an emphasis 
on medium-sized agribusiness, to strengthen their ability to manage and recover from 
events such as droughts or flooding. 

C. Implementing the FY12-15 Partnership Strategy 

Managing the Program 

75. 
The WBG will organize its program in Brazil along the lines of its four strategic 
objectives, engaging with all government levels, private sector and civil society. For each 
strategic objective, the Bank Group will implement an integrated program of AAA, lending, trust 
funds and partnership activities. The deployment of Bank resources will be based on the 
principles of flexibility, selectivity, innovation, and leveraging. Flexibility. The Bank Group will 
adjust its resources across instruments and areas of engagement in order to better respond to the 
country‘s evolving needs. Selectivity. The WBG will progressively disengage from areas where 
partners in Brazil have sufficient knowledge and capacity, and where the potential benefits 
derived from the Bank‘s global experience are of less significance, while concentrating on those 
areas where partners can benefit most from the Group‘s global knowledge and experience. 
Innovation. The WBG will focus on supporting innovative investments and policy reforms 
whose impact can be enhanced through replication across regions within Brazil and abroad. The 
WBG will make an increasing use of innovative financial services, including new result-based 
and multi-sector lending instruments, as well as partial credit risk and other guarantees. 
Leveraging. The Bank Group will increasingly rely on leveraging resources from government, 
the private sector and other development partners, to maximize development impact. In addition, 
the WBG and the GoB will develop activities geared to improve efficiency in the planning and 
execution of projects, including an enhanced dialogue on possibilities for furthering the use of 
country systems. Also, to the extent that synergies warrant the development of multi-sector 
projects, attention will be given to ensure that project administrative efficiency is not affected by 
the participation of multiple implementation agencies. 

Loan Portfolio and Pipeline Management 

76. 
Total Bank current exposure to Brazil amounts to the equivalent of US$10.4 billion, 
with disbursements amounting to US$3.1 billion in FY11.  During the current CPS period the 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Government of Brazil made two prepayments on its Bank debt. The first prepayment of about 
US$866 million was done in December 2009 and the second of about 3.1 billion in June 2011. 
More recently, President Rousseff approved an additional prepayment in an approximate amount 
of $2.7 billion and the corresponding formal request was received by the Bank on September 30, 
2011. With this third prepayment, the indicative lending program presented in the CPS for FY12-
13 is fully consistent with the SBL framework. Additionally, in the context of the national CPS 
consultation process, the GoB has expressed its intention to request the expansion of the SBL for 
Brazil.  

77. 
Portfolio performance has been highly satisfactory. The active portfolio consists of 49 
IBRD loans and 9 GEF projects ($76.7 million), for a total commitment of US$9.5 billion, of 
which US$5.2 billion is undisbursed. The Bank Group also manages a portfolio of about 55 trust 
fund grants for a total of US$132 million, with FY11 disbursements of US$13 million. The 
disbursement ratio of the portfolio – a key indicator of overall portfolio performance – was 
32.0% by end-FY11, above the LCR average of 31.0% and of the Bank of 21.7%, for the same 
period.  About 90% of projects in the portfolio are rated in the satisfactory range both for 
Implementation Progress and achievement of Development Objectives. Commitments at risk 
(including GEF) represent 9.7% of the portfolio and amount to US$919.7 million. IFC's 
committed balance stood at US$2.67 billion at the end of FY11, of which US$2.24 billion had 
been disbursed, making Brazil the Corporation‘s second largest partner country. The portfolio 
consisted of 72 active client companies and was performing soundly. 

78. 
The last Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) report (June 2002) 
concluded that the Brazilian system of public financial management provides reliable 
information, that adequate systems exist to manage and track the receipt and use of funds at 
national level, and that there is a high level of fiscal transparency, both of which would support 
any program of adjustment lending.  The risk to both Bank and country funds was considered as 
low.  Annual working updates of these indicators since have consistently confirmed this rating. 
The last Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) report 
(December 2009) identified the following areas related to strengthening the credibility and 
predictability of the annual budget process for additional focus: (i) improving the credibility of 
budget revenue forecasts and tax policy, both from a technical perspective and in terms of 
generating a policy/political consensus; (ii) managing the growing overhang of expenditure 
commitments (Restos a Pagar) and the high level of in-year budget amendments is a 
considerable problem for planning and budget management; and, (iii) the predictability and 
impact of cash management for expenditure management. Annual working updates have 
confirmed these areas for further improvement, but have also noted continued progress. 

79. 
Reviews of the sub-national PFM environment, 
including through PEFA 
assessments in selected states, reveal a number of strengths but also areas for additional 
improvement. The former include a robust legal framework that helps to promote uniformity in 
PFM practices. There is a good degree of orderliness and participation in the annual budget 
process, and internal controls are generally strong as a result of inbuilt controls in the 
information systems. However, some states lag behind in implementing PFM reforms, and 
remaining challenges include a lack of capacity, weak controls in some areas such as payroll, 
irregular performance of debt sustainability analyses and outdated information systems. External 

35 

 
 
 
 
audit agencies regularly highlight instances of weak accounting practices. In addition, there are 
weaknesses in the multiyear perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting, 
and there is a need to strengthen linkages between medium to long-term sector strategies and the 
annual budgeting process. Many states have only recently established an internal audit unit with 
a higher level of autonomy that existed before, and are still in the process of reinforcing it with 
the requisite capacity and instruments. 

80. 
The country financial management inherent risk is low and so is the control risk at 
the entities implementing Bank projects. Financial management arrangements and internal 
controls maintained by project implementing agencies for Bank financed projects have been 
adequate to ensure that funds have been used for their intended purposes. All the projects run by 
the Federal government have been audited by the Office of the Comptroller General (CGU), and 
those at the State and Municipal levels have been audited either by State Courts of Accounts 
(TCEs) or private sector auditors considered acceptable to the Bank. The Bank has been 
undertaking efforts to support the strengthening of the capacity of these TCEs to fulfill their 
mandate. There are no overdue audits regarding the projects (credits and grants) or continuing 
entities. The FM staff involved in Bank projects is sufficiently experienced and skilled. Out of 58 
active projects, 56 have moderately satisfactory or higher FM rating. Overall, there are no major 
fiduciary risks likely to affect the implementation of the proposed CPS program. 

81. 
Innovations and strengthening of procurement practices are expected to further 
improve portfolio implementation. The expected increased use of country systems in new 
operations and the continued evolution of client procurement capacity and practices are expected 
to underpin further portfolio implementation improvements. Examples of procurement systems 
―best practices‖, like the case of the State of Minas Gerais, have become a reference not only for 
the Bank‘s work across Brazil, but also in other parts of the world, and have provided significant 
inputs and lessons for the further development of Bank operational instruments. 

Knowledge Agenda  

82. 
During the last CPS period, it became clear that the Bank's comparative advantage lies in 
the quality of the services and technical advice it provides, more than in the volume of lending it 
can offer, or the interest rates it charges. The reputation for technical excellence and unbiased 
advice is what makes the Bank a trusted partner of the Federal government in dealing with sub-
national entities or in helping address path-setting challenges. Such a reputation is the result of a 
long standing commitment in investing to ―global‖ knowledge, partnering with local scholars 
and experts and bringing the best of Brazil to the Bank and the best of the Bank to Brazil. 

Fostering Partnerships 

83. 
South-South Cooperation (S-SC). Brazil has several public, CSO, private and academic 
centers of excellence in a large number of fields, capable of making significant S-SC 
contributions. The Government of Brazil has gradually expanded and broadened its S-SC efforts, 
with a special focus on Latin America and Africa, based on a viewpoint of solidarity and 
partnership. Given Brazil‘s growing international role, the country also seeks more participation 
and responsibility in international cooperation. The WBG can support Brazil in its efforts to 

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expand S-SC collaboration in the areas of sustainable agriculture, social protection, public 
financial management, health, renewable energy, and governance among others. Under the new 
CPS, the WBG will: (i) support the further development of S-SC from Brazil, jointly developing 
with the Brazilian Government triangular partnerships that articulate Brazilian South-South 
cooperation initiatives with WBG-led multinational, regional and bi-national initiatives; (ii) 
provide technical cooperation to the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC/MRE) in its process of 
institutional strengthening; (iii) support sector-specific S-SC knowledge exchanges and 
operational initiatives; (iv) pilot an innovative ―cross-regional‖ technical S-SC project with 
African countries; and (v) provide IFC financing for investments by Brazilian companies in other 
developing countries. All S-SC initiatives which are based on or include technical cooperation 
components shall be conceived, negotiated and approved through the Brazilian Cooperation 
Agency (ABC/MRE). 

Mainstreaming Gender 

84. While the condition of women in Brazil is considerably more advanced than in other 
developing nations, important issues such as economic empowerment, women‘s health and 
domestic violence still need to be improved, especially in some parts of the country (Annex 3).22 
The WBG will build upon the lessons of the WDR and focus on supporting evidence-based 
Government policies aimed at reducing gender gaps in access to quality health and education 
services, closing differences in economic opportunities between women and men, enhancing 
women's voice in society and helping limit the reproduction of gender differences across 
generations. The Bank will support these initiatives through analytical work in partnership with 
local think tanks, efforts to build the capacity of Government agencies responsible for Gender 
policies in both the Executive and the Legislative branches, and by means of including gender 
activities and components in investment and policy based loans – e.g. in the areas of health, 
education and social protection, in the proposed operations for Alagoas, Bahia, Belo Horizonte, 
Paraná and Pernambuco. The newly established Procuradoria Especial da Mulher at the Federal 
Congress, in particular, is receiving institutional development support to enhance its legislative 
capacity, and, together with the Women‘s Affairs Secretariat constitutes a key partner for the 
Bank‘s support on gender issues under the CPS.23 The Bank is also working on strengthening the 
capacity of similar agencies at the State and Municipal levels. In addition, in collaboration with 
DIME and the Gender Network, a program has been put in place to introduce the economics of 
gender in the design of agriculture projects in Brazil. Impact evaluation of those interventions 
will be an essential tool to mainstream gender activities in our agriculture portfolio. 

IV. MANAGING RISKS 

85. 
The proposed Country Strategy is subject to external macroeconomic risks. First, in 
the event of a significant worsening of the global economic outlook, Brazil could be affected 
through a reduction in demand for Brazilian exports, reduced access to external financing, and 

22 For example, a WHO multi-country study on violence against women shows that 29% of women with partners 
experience physical or sexual violence in Sao Paulo; the comparable figure for Pernambuco is 37%. 
23 The Procuradoria Especial da Mulher was created in 2009 with the objective of promoting gender equality 
through its legislative work, including the innovative Lei Maria da Penha (against domestic violence). The 
Women‘s Affairs Secretariat in the Executive branch was created by President Lula in 2003 with Ministerial status. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
deterioration in consumer and business confidence. While this scenario could be associated with 
a deceleration in economic growth, the risk of further negative impacts on the Brazilian economy 
are mitigated by the country‘s large external reserves, the solidity of its financial system and the 
strength of its domestic demand. In particular, there are risks associated with the level of total 
broadly defined gross external indebtedness – $538.8 billion in July 2011, including 
intercompany loans (US$108.6 billion) and nonresident holdings of domestic fixed income 
instruments (US$133.1 billion) – which could raise concerns about potential debt rollover risks if 
portfolio debt and other investment inflows were to moderate going forward. Nonetheless, this 
risk is mitigated by the fact that only a minority of the corresponding debts have short term 
maturities, by the large amount of international reserves held by Brazil (US$346.1 billion) and 
by its flexible exchange rate regime, which would automatically counter any significant 
outflows. A related macro risk is the possible emergence of currency mismatches associated with 
rapid growth in private sector gross external indebtedness (63% between December 2009 and 
July 2011). The Central Bank is aware of this risk and is addressing it through stepped up 
monitoring of private foreign borrowing and the tightening of regulations on Banks‘ capital 
requirements and net open positions.  

86. 
The authorities also face the challenge of dealing with internal inflationary 
pressures while at the same time attempting to minimize the negative impact of external 
shocks. The risk that this situation may lead to deterioration in both growth and inflation 
prospects is mitigated by the fact that Brazil‘s fiscal policy stance has already become less 
expansionary, which should help achieve a better balance in the control of domestic demand 
between fiscal and monetary policy instruments. Although there is a risk of the Government not 
meeting its fiscal targets, this is mitigated by the fact that the Federal Government has over-
delivered relative to its 2011 primary surplus target, as well as by its decision to further increase 
this target, and its announced intention of further restraining non-investment expenditures in 
2012. The WBG will assist the Government in the management of fiscal and other macro 
vulnerabilities through its policy dialogue and AAA program. 

87. 
Ensuring a significant impact in a country of continental dimensions. The CPS is 
also subject to Bank-related risks. First, the proposed CPS is subject to the risk of the WBG not 
being able to achieve a significant impact in Brazil, due to the small size of its lending, 
investment and AAA program relative to the overall size of Brazil‘s economy. This risk will be 
mitigated, first, by explicitly recognizing that the WBG‘s role in Brazil is necessarily limited, 
catalytic and tactical. If the WBG is to have a significant impact in Brazil, this cannot be derived 
exclusively from the size of its financial contributions. Rather, the WBG will seek to have a 
development impact in Brazil through the knowledge contributions that it will embed in its 
various activities. In particular, the WBG will leverage its limited resources by focusing on 
knowledge-intensive activities aimed at supporting innovative interventions that, scaled-up, can 
provide benefits that could far exceed the direct impact of the original WBG projects. Second, 
there is a risk of the Bank not being able to implement the proposed program due to a constraint 
in its capacity to lend to Brazil. The SBL framework currently limits the Bank‘s exposure to 
Brazil at US$16.5 billion. This risk is mitigated by the strength of the partnership between Brazil 
and the WBG. In particular, the recognition of the mutual benefits that this partnership entails, 
including indirect benefits for other member countries through knowledge transfers and S-SC, 
creates strong motivations for the multiples parties involved to seek options to address this 

38 

 
 
 
constraint. Third, there are operational risks associated with the inherent complexity of the Bank 
projects that involve multiple implementing agencies, often across different sectors, Ministries 
and/or Secretariats. These risks, which could affect the timely delivery of projects‘ expected 
outputs and outcomes, will be jointly and proactively assessed by the WBG and the GoB during 
project preparation. They will be mitigated through the design of appropriate implementation 
frameworks, the provision of training and other capacity building activities and the increased use 
of country systems.

CPS Annex 1: CPS Consultation 

The Brazil IBRD and IFC country teams undertook consultations for the preparation of this CPS 
with numerous Federal, State and Municipal clients, the private sector and civil society, 
comprising approximately 100 direct interlocutors, including seven State Governors. As the 
Bank program is increasingly at the sub-national level, consultations had a particular focus on 
State and Municipal clients and stakeholders. In all, the sub-national consultations represented all 
five regions of the country, accounting for over 70% of Brazilian GDP and 65% of the country‘s 
population. The meetings took place from March to August 2011, and especially between August 
15 and 25, in the cities of Belo Horizonte/MG, Brasília/DF, Porto Alegre/RS, Recife/PE, Rio 
Branco/AC, Rio de Janeiro/RJ, Salvador/BA and São Paulo/SP. The CPS also benefited from 
comments from Internet users and a survey of more than 70 policy makers and opinion setters, 
including civil society, media, academia, private sector and government. 

The consultations suggest that the WBG development support is very valued by most 
interlocutors. Counterparts see the WBG as a leading development institution and a key partner 
for Federal and sub-national governments. The Federal Government acknowledged the Bank‘s 
partnership and flexibility in shifting its focus to the sub-national governments during the 
previous CPS period, in response to Brazil‘s changing development outlook and in coordination 
with Government priorities – especially support to the Fiscal Responsibility Law framework. 
The government also highlighted the value of both knowledge and financial contributions to 
priority programs and requested that this joint focus be maintained for the new CPS. Examples 
include technical and financial support for the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer program, 
support for the design of selected components of the PAC public investment program (e.g. in the 
areas of low-income housing finance and renewable energy), and contributions for the 
development of Brazil‘s strategy for mitigating climate change and improving disaster risk 
management. The WBG was requested to maintain a flexible approach in the new CPS, increase 
its use of country systems and reduce internal bureaucratic obstacles, especially when working 
with sub-national entities and in multi-sector operations.  

Many sub-national governments noted that the CPS is in close accord and complements their 
own multi annual programs, and will thus be an important help to achieve planned long-term 
results. They described the World Bank Group‘s involvement as essential for increasing fiscal 
space 
for 
investment, 
raising public management standards, developing multi-sector 
development strategies and building capacity in the poorest States. The Group‘s support for 
innovation and path-setting development solutions was highly appreciated, but sub-nationals 
highlight that the Bank‘s financial support remains a central part of the partnership, and that 
since challenges vary greatly from State to State the Group must adapt its support accordingly – 
from highly sophisticated to more basic investments. The Group‘s assistance in helping to create 
solid public private partnership frameworks as well as promoting socially and environmentally 
sustainable development strategies in the Amazon and other regions was valued, as was its role 
in helping ensure continuity of projects across administrations. 

Civil society organizations and the private sector called on the Group to expand its policy to 
include more partners and voices in its operations from the beginning, providing inputs on 
program development and priority setting. Organizations also asked the WBG to help foster 
greater general 
transparency and 
inclusion from 
its government counterparts. CSOs 

55 

 
 
 
 
acknowledged the Group‘s importance as a partner for social and environmental sustainability 
especially as Brazil steps up infrastructure investments in sensitive biomes, and called on the 
Group to support sustainable development capacity building and social control initiatives by 
local governments.  Civil society also asked the Group to seek to balance the drive to increase 
private sector participation in public investments with stronger support for increasing the State‘s 
capacity to finance and execute its mandated services.  Private sector representatives asked that 
the Bank address looming bottlenecks for Brazilian growth in education quality, job training and 
infrastructure, especially in lagging regions. 

In addition to meetings, a survey of 70 Brazilian clients and decision makers from government 
(Federal, State and Municipal), private sector, civil society and academia, revealed that 91% of 
respondents considered the partnership between the World Bank and Brazil to be ―very good‖ or 
―good‖. The largest percentage (21%) among the negative aspects was related to the perception 
that ―the Bank only supports projects of its own interest.‖ According to respondents, the Bank‘s 
three main contributions in Brazil were that it ―brings new procedures and knowledge‖ (26%); 
―supports development‖ (17%) and ―stimulates economic growth‖ (11%). When asked about the 
areas in which the Bank should have a more active role in Brazil, the top response was 
―education and health‖, followed by ―fighting poverty‖ and ―support to infrastructure‖. 

A summary of the comments received during the CPS consultation meetings follows, divided by 
strategic area. The comments are not in any particular order of importance and should not be 
interpreted as a comprehensive or official representation of any groups or views. 

Objective 1: Increase efficiency of public and private investments 

 Despite the value of innovation, several states pointed out that support for basic 
investments such as transport and education infrastructure was often just as important in 
terms of development impact, especially when access to other resources is too expensive 
or not practical (RS, SP).  The Bank should help states ensure that basic needs are met 
before innovation becomes a criterion. In the Northeast, support for infrastructure that 
promoter production and inclusion is need as an area where that Bank could expand its 
work, especially in the context of the World Cup, that requires numerous complementary 
investments that should have long-term development impacts. Sub-national governments 
in the region also call for continued support for rural development with stronger market 
integration and disaster risk prevention investments. 

 Although some of the consulted states have higher than average development indicators 
for Brazil, a few of these have been experiencing declining trends for lack of investment 
capacity and fiscal constraints, or contain significant pockets of poverty and inequality 
within the State. Rio Grande do Sul, for example, suffers from a long period of lack of 
investment and harbors extreme regional disparities within it, with very poor areas that 
lag behind in terms of human development indicators. Likewise, São Paulo, Minas Gerais 
and Rio de Janeiro have the absolute majority of urban poor in the country. These 
governments suggest that the Group maintain support for their anti poverty efforts 
that will add significantly to the country‘s progress.  More developed states suffer from 
lack of resources for this because they are seen as homogeneously developed, while great 

56 

 
 
 
 
 
 
inequalities remain. The WBG‘s support in dealing with these inequalities will add to the 
country‘s broader efforts against poverty. 

 The Bank‘s support in public sector management is key to improve effectiveness of 
investments now that fiscal situation is improving in many states, which face the 
challenge to invest.  

 The strengthening of public sector management capacity is unanimously mentioned 
by states as an important area of contribution that the new CPS should continue and 
strengthen.  In particular, the areas of projects planning and development, policy quality, 
expenditure control and monitoring and evaluation of investments and implementation 
are cited as key. Specifically, several states requested that the Bank help them 
professionalize permanent public sector management through well-defined careers, 
protected from political interference. This would need to go much beyond mere capacity 
building, creating a management culture. Management for result is seen by many states 
and municipalities as the way to go, but some feel that they still lack the technical and 
institutional capacity to step into such a program, and that the CPS should be clearer in its 
intended assistance to governments that wish to adopt this methodology, including in 
capacity building and culture shifts among high-level staff. 

 Sub-national governments asked the Bank to contribute to fine-tune Brazil’s control 
and oversight framework, which is seen by some states as sometimes representing a 
bottleneck to investment, with excessive regulation that are often redundant and 
inefficient. The Bank could help achieve systems that preserve the procedural and 
governance safeguards with less cost and more transparency, for greater development 
impact. In particular, some states believe that control structures have developed the 
institutional framework in terms of staffing and capacity, but not the strategic outlook for 
more effective oversight. 

 While the focus on fostering increased investment capacity in Brazil is endorsed by all 
government and private sector counterparts, several different priorities to achieve this are 
mentioned. Some states believe that reducing the risk associated with public 
investment should be the focus of the Bank’s support, mirroring efforts to reduce 
barriers to private sector investment. These include more intelligent control structures, 
support for improved procurement and contracting legislation and better personnel 
management by governments. Expanded efforts to help Brazil build a private sector long-
term capital market as an alternative to the highly centralized system currently in place 
were also mentioned by both the public and private sector as important areas of focus for 
the Bank and IFC in the next few years. The private sector suggested that Bank financing 
could be used to do the high social impact and low financial return investments that the 
Government is not doing. Finally, the Group should acknowledge that investment rates 
cannot be a simple target, but that in some states and municipalities current expenditures 
are also a good reflection of the effectiveness and quality of services. Examples include 
education and health – some governments do not need major investments, but rather 
quality improvements and upkeep. 

57 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the other hand, private sector pointed out that public and private investments are not 
coordinated, especially at the sub-national level, and that Group support to better 
planning capacity of these investments could be a major contribution to investment 
effectiveness.  This is especially true in a context of strong foreign direct investment 
influx. The ―fiscal war‖ among states competing for investments is a clear example of the 
deleterious effects of this lack of coordination, especially in the Northeast, according to 
private sector interlocutors. The Bank‘s convening power and seal of approval could help 
achieve a turning point in the area. Additionally, the investment climate in the country 
remains difficult and improvements could release many intentions to invest that are 
currently held back. 

 The CPS could increase it focus on public-private partnerships (PPPs) as an efficient 
alternative to direct public investments. The Bank could help develop the technical 
framework for these instruments in the Federal Government. The IFC and Bank should 
engage more closely to promote this. Specifically, government requested more Group 
attention to strengthening experience such as public interest civil society organizations 
(OSCIPs) and social health organizations (OSs). 

 Some civil society organizations are skeptical about the need to push for more 
investments, especially using private sector instruments such as PPPs.  According to 
them, the push should be on reducing interest payments on the debt stock and freeing 
more public resources for social services. 

 CSO organizations also called the Group to help improve governance in the private 
sector, to help increase investments in a socially and environmentally sustainable 
manner. A particular focus on helping guarantee labor quality in major investments in 
Brazil‘s frontier states was mentioned. 

 After years of underinvestment in several states, increasing public sector management 
and especially project development capacity is seen as key to rekindle investment 
capacity and reduce public sector investment risk. This includes monitoring and 
evaluation and computerized expenditure control systems. Several states are 
implementing pilot projects and seek Bank support to expand/improve. Bank Group 
support in such areas is also seen as likely to bolster State attractiveness to private sector 
investment and even provide seal of approval for increased Federal resources, including 
in the areas where the Bank is not directly involved. 

 Some states in which the Bank has played an important role to help achieve fiscal 
sustainability now ask that the World Bank to support investment, jointly generating 
knowledge and practical experiences from implementation and strengthening the 
State’s capacity to manage its own investment plans. States believe that the Bank can 
act as a catalyst to unleash and coordinate much pent up knowledge. 

58 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objective 2: Improve quality and expand provision of public services for low income 
households 

 According to some government interlocutors, the Bank should help Brazil shift from its 
focus on services and assistance for its older population to a more balanced scenario in 
which youth receive more opportunities. 

 Regional inequalities and other development gaps need to be addressed from an equal 
opportunities perspective as opposed to equal results. 

 

Instead of additional support for social protection-type projects such as the Brasil sem 
Miséria, some interlocutors in the sub-national level asked the Bank to re engage more 
strongly in education quality as a way to make the country‘s growth more 
Economically and socially sustainable. The Bank‘s efforts to support financial education 
in Brazil were mentioned as an area for possible expansion. 

 The private sector also called for increased Bank support to education, perceived to be 
one of Brazil´s major development bottlenecks, together with infrastructure. 
According to some private sector analysts, Brazil‘s unique asset of a strong domestic 
market, which has driven growth and crisis resilience up to now, could be jeopardized if 
education investments are lacking and the needed human capital is not developed. There 
is a general perception in the consulted private sector that the quality of Brazilian 
education expenditures is low and inadequate to address this concern. 

 Governments in the Northeast and Southeast asked the Group consider stepping into 
security investments, which represents one of the top development bottlenecks in 
several states. While acknowledging the Group‘s provisions against some types of 
investment in the area, governments argue that a decisive posture from the Group could 
be seminal for a new push in reducing crime and violence and its toll on social and 
economic development, especially in the Northeast. The Bank‘s engagement in education 
and disaster risk management is mentioned as examples of how a push by the institution 
helped take the national debate to a new level and achieve results. 

 Gender was mentioned by several sub-national governments as an area where 
investments are being done but that could benefit from the Group’s partnership. In 
particular, the link to security investments was seen as a possible major entry door for 
more integrated work in the area. 

Objective 3: Promote regional economic development through strategic investment and 
policies 

 The private sector suggested the development by the Bank of a “better life” index for 
Brazil, which could be used for setting public development targets and the Bank‘s own 
investment priorities.  This could include indicators on crime, pollution, traffic, etc. and 
be done together with the Brazilian Bureau of Statistics (IBGE).  This could include 
national and sub-national indexes. 

59 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The CPS‘s focus on promoting South-South cooperation is endorsed by most 
interlocutors, from government to civil society, but most mention that although 
knowledge is available the support structures and financing to ensure the optimal 
effectiveness of these exchanges are not yet in place. The Federal Government asked that 
the Bank‘s support in the area be done in close cooperation with Brazil‘s International 
Development Agency (ABC), and that the work also include increasing the agency‘s 
management capacity. Some states pointed out that the Bank could also help promote 
more ―domestic‖ South-South exchanges, in which states that have developed solutions 
could share them with others and learn from other areas. Some areas mentioned were 
security issues, public sector management and results management and community 
driven development technologies. 

Objective 4: Improve sustainable natural resource management and climate resilience 

 Government and CSOs from the Amazon asked that the Group’s strategy for the region 
should consider the longer maturation period for investment in this context and also 
focus on endogenous solutions and production chains, seeking to improve the quality of 
private sector engagement in sustainability. 

 Civil Society called for a clearer definition of the Group’s work in the Amazon and 
other sensitive biomes in the CPS, especially regarding major infrastructure investments 
planned by the Government in the regions.  

 CSOs suggested that the CPS should help promote sustainable production chains 
sensitive biomes, especially the Amazon, and in the country‘s poorest regions, through 
heavy emphasis on innovation and the reduction of their macro risks. The focus could be 
on ―short circuit‖ production and consumption chains, involving microfinancing, for their 
increased social and environmental sustainability.  

 The CPS should place a stronger emphasis on improving and coordinating national and 
sub-national climate change policies, as well as how the private sector interacts with 
them.  The Group‘s support to structuring a national carbon trading market would be 
important, as would support to help redefine the relation between Brazil‘s private sector 
and biodiversity concerns. CSOs believe that businesses do not fully understand the 
sustainable use of these resources and that IFC and the Bank can develop pilot cases to 
guide the market. 

 Environmental NGOs were concerned that the Bank was perceived as backtracking on 
advances in safeguard promotion, and doing DPL loans intentionally to skirt them.  
The consultation process of the CPS and of the DPLs in question needs to be improved to 
bring CSO contributions onboard and improve the operations. CSOs count on the Group 
as partners but need access, participation and transparency.  In addition, they call on the 
Bank to help the dialogue with the government. 

60 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
World Bank Group Country Engagement 

 The Federal Government and most developed states pointed out that financing continues 
to be an important part of the Bank’s support, in addition to knowledge, and that the 
Bank should not stress one to the detriment of the other. This is because these states often 
have great internal development inequality and face management and financial 
difficulties to do the needed investments. The less developed states also stress that there 
are basic necessities such as schools, health infrastructure and transport that come before 
any need to be innovative. In particular, the Amazon region still suffers from huge 
coverage gaps in services such as education, health, electricity and sanitation, first 
generation problems that take precedence over quality of services. 

 The Group is called to recognize that Brazil and even the states and regions are not 
homogeneous and that the CPS should be flexible enough to be able to support these 
very different realities through customized interventions – for example helping 
develop a sustainable forest low carbon economy in the North of the country, integrating 
some of Brazil‘s most isolated municipalities. Governments in environmentally sensitive 
biomes are challenged to seek development in more sustainable manners, in a way 
creating a handicap for their efforts and making the result horizon longer. The region‘s 
development model is very different from the rest of the country‘s and thus needs special 
treatment from the Group, which should acknowledge this and support their efforts 
though facilitated access to resources and increased technical support to existing good 
programs. 

 The World Bank Group should use its opinion setting capacity to confront Federal 
policy makers and the country’s elite with many of the contradictions and 
unsustainability of the current policies, opening the debate on issues such as budget 
earmarking, higher education subsidies, social security and governance. In particular, the 
Bank could have a key role in helping the country rebalance its system of constitutionally 
mandated budget earmarking, that result in much waste and inefficiency in areas such as 
health and education. 

 For the Federal government, the Bank should work on reducing the bureaucracy and 
overhead associated with its financing, as this is a major consideration for the decision 
to contract it or not, especially at the sub-national levels. This is especially true for 
multisector projects, which are more complex in terms of coordination both from the 
Bank and national agency sides. More developed states and municipalities feel that the 
cost of doing business with the Bank is increasing vis à vis its benefits, given the 
additional layers of bureaucracy. Some suggest that the Bank should consider longer 
investment horizons, committing open resources to a broader program and thus helping 
the client plan and achieve better-integrated programs. The Federal Government suggests 
that the CPS use national policies and programs as the baseline for alignment of sub-
national interventions, thus boosting system efficiency and effectiveness. 

 The Federal Government, States and Municipalities were unanimous in the call for 
increased use of country systems by the Bank, especially in procurement, financial 

61 

 
 
 
 
 
 
management (SIAFI) and in social and environmental safeguards, deemed as thorough as 
the Bank‘s. Clients argue that the imposition of Bank rules saps implementation capacity, 
most importantly in the states that have the lowest preexisting capacity, and brings little 
development impact per se. The Group should recognize the good work and 
achievements of some of its clients and offer them more streamlined instruments such as 
DPLs and the proposed P4Rs, which do not duplicate overhead structures. In the case of 
states and municipalities with weaker institutional capacity, these instruments are just as 
effective to promote improvements via the conditionality clauses. Some states asked the 
Bank to consider developing new guarantee structures to multiply its leveraging of 
resources while addressing capital constraints. 

 At the Municipal level, civil society organizations suggest the Bank should consider 
promoting consortia of cities, especially to help develop water and sanitation and solid 
waste management programs. The Bank‘s could help devise, in partnership with civil 
society, the social engineering needed to support these consortia and thus promote third 
party investments. 

 Bank support in finding ways to coordinate and harmonize sub-national government 
program implementation across different secretariats and implementing agencies is also 
a request of several State governments. According to clients, this is especially important 
in cases where improved fiscal conditions point to the prospect of increased investment 
capacity and Federal. Bank presence would ensure a strong technical base, quality and 
greater knowledge generation from partnership operations. 

 Many states believe that the Bank should explicitly use its partnership as a conduit to 
help enable third party investments from the Federal government, BNDES and the 
private sector. The Group could improve its support to Brazil is in investment 
benchmarking and bringing in the international experience needed to put programs, both 
public and private, in perspective. 

 Civil society suggests that, given the Bank‘s relative size in Brazil, the Group should 
consider a new type of contract, with more partners.  The Protocolo Verde experience 
could serve as a model for this. The new mode would ensure more impact and legitimacy 
for the Group.  Some CSOs mentioned that the CPS still differentiates development 
actors artificially, and that the Group‘s vision should change to reflect that the productive 
sector is not restricted to the private sector.  Civil society and social movements are also 
major economic forces for development, creating social capital especially in the Amazon, 
where these groups develop programs and technical background for sustainable 
productive activities.  The Group could offer additional instruments to integrate CSOs in 
projects from the onset, including process and policy discussions, and more broadly to 
support independent work by civil society. According to several CSOs, this direct 
interaction and partnership with the civil society could also insure states and programs 
against the undoing of achievements after political shifts, creating a latent capacity to 
protect the gains through stronger social controls. To achieve some of these goals, it was 
suggested that Group programs include a set percentage of resources for CSO 
strengthening, similar to what the Brazilian Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) does; 

62 

 
 
 
 
 
that 
the Group seek a more direct 
line of dialogue with CSOs and 
the 
beneficiaries/stakeholders of projects and that it include ex-ante stakeholder consultation 
requirements for many of its financings. On this issue, a representative of indigenous 
peoples in Acre said, ―agencies which finance projects are thinking for us and not with 
us.‖ A second traditional population‘s representative acknowledges the need to improve 
living standards in their Amazon areas, but if this is to be done respecting their life styles, 
the Government and the Group must hear them first. 

 States across Brazil, from Rio Grande do Sul to Acre, requested that the Bank support 
their efforts to increase transparency and social participation and control over the 
budgeting and planning process.  In particular, the Bank is asked to help implement or 
improve participatory budget processes, and 
increasing 
transparency 
in public 
expenditures. This request was also made by civil society and the private sector, which 
see it as a promising avenue to increase effectiveness of public investments and 
contribute to poverty reduction. 

 Some civil society interlocutors believe that the CPS reflects an out-of-date focus on 
reduction of current expenditures as a means to increase investment capacity. This is 
especially visible in the push for more PPPs. CSOs called on the Bank to reflect in the 
CPS that the State remains the key provider of public services and that many of these 
services cannot and should not be outsourced to private concerns. In the same vein, CSOs 
called for greater social participation and control at the sub-national level, and called on 
the Bank to help evaluate impacts of the existing and proposed mechanisms. 

Mirroring the public sector‘s call for less bureaucracy in Bank operations, the private sector also 
reported difficulties working directly with the Group, and called for simplified procedures.

CPS Annex 2: Leveraging IBRD Lending Capacity in Brazil24 

The main purpose of this Annex is to present financing options that could potentially offer 
additional means of leveraging IBRD funds available to the Brazil Country program. The 
prudential Single Borrower Limit framework is likely to be a constraint on IBRD‘s ability to 
respond in full to the government‘s request for IBRD lending and the Annex discusses potential 
measures that could be taken to keep net exposure to Brazil within the current US$16.5 billion 
limit approved by the Board. IBRD continues to explore new ways to meet clients‘ financing 
needs, while ensuring that its exposure remains within stipulated limits, by leveraging World 
Bank Group synergies and partnerships with bilateral donors, multilateral agencies, and the 
private sector. The Annex will highlight a number of these options: 

1. 
Prepayments.  A borrowing country can prepay existing IBRD loans to free up 
additional room under the exposure limit. It also enables the government to redeploy guarantees 
(if prepaid loans have a government guarantee) to other projects without increasing contingent 
liabilities. 

Total financial cost/benefit to the borrower depends on the sum of the following: 

• 
Prepayment premium (not likely to be any for Variable Spread Loans which were 
contracted approx. five or more years ago, as the contractual spread was lower at that time than it 
is today for new IBRD Variable Spread Loans; this is provided there have not been any swaps in 
conjunction with these loans) 

• 

• 

Difference between the spread of the prepaid loan and the new loan  

Difference in the maturity premium of the prepaid loan and the new loan 

Since 2009, Brazil has exercised the prepayment option twice. In December 2009, after 
reviewing and analyzing the Federal Government’s portfolio with the IBRD, the STN opted to 
make a prepayment of around 866 million dollars where 9 loans were prepaid (2 currency pool 
loans, 4 variable spread loans, one fixed single currency loan, and 2 fixed spread loans). In June 
2011 Brazil made a second prepayment of 3.1 billion dollars to further reduce their exposure 
and allow for additional lending to sub-nationals. Of the amount prepaid, 2.05 billion dollars 
were meant to fully prepay 10 converted currency pool loans, 5 variable spread loans and 6 
fixed spread loans. The remaining 1.05 billon dollars were destined to partially prepay other 6 
fixed spread loans. In total 28 loans were prepaid. 

As of June 30th 2011, the disbursed outstanding balance of Brazil’s portfolio with the IBRD is of 
10.4 billion dollars25. Out of which 3.6 billion dollars are loans to the Federal Government and, 
therefore, the STN could choose to make additional prepayments to further reduce their exposure 
with the IBRD and create scope for new lending under the CPS. 

24 The GoB has not yet analyzed in detail the options included in this Annex. The GoB has thus no obligation or 
commitment as to their implementation. 
25 The Undisbursed balance of Brazil‘s Portfolio as of June 30th 2011 is 5.2 billion dollars. The undisbursed balance 
of loans with the Federal Government is 1.2 billion dollars. 

64 

 
                                                            
2. 
IBRD Special Private Placement Bonds. Highly creditworthy borrowers with large 
reserves have the potential option (depending on Board approval) of purchasing IBRD Special 
Private Placement Bonds (SPPB) to maintain their net exposure within the Single Borrower 
Limit (SBL)26.  This enables governments that are at, or approaching, their limit to borrow on 
IBRD terms above it. The exact amount and timing of the bond purchase would depend on an 
annual exposure projection made by the Bank‘s Credit Department which would take into 
consideration the country‘s demand for IBRD financing during the fiscal year; the pace of 
project delivery; exchange rate fluctuations; disbursements; regular amortization; and possible 
prepayments. The combined volume of lending under the SPPB framework and the country‘s 
regular access would have to remain below the Equitable Access Limit27. 

Discussions on this option were started in April of 2011 with the Brazilian National Treasury 
and the Central Bank and are expected to continue during FY12.  

3. 

Guarantees.  IBRD provides for 3 types of guarantees outlined below28.  

Guarantee operations catalyze private financing in infrastructure, provide access to capital 
markets, facilitate privatizations and public private partnerships (PPPs), reduce government risk 
exposure by passing commercial risk to the private sector, improve the impact of private sector 
participation on tariffs, and encourage co financing. Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs), Partial 
Credit Guarantees (PCGs) and Policy Based Guarantees (PBGs) catalyze private sector 
financing. While PRGs cover political risks, PCGs and PBGs mitigate the credit risk of a 
government or sub-sovereign entity, thereby boosting market confidence and facilitating a 
government‘s or sub-sovereign‘s access to the debt and capital markets. IBRD‘s participation as 
guarantor also helps countries secure more favorable terms such as lower interest costs and 
longer maturities. 

IBRD Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs) cover private lenders or debt investors against the risk of 
a government (or government-owned entity) failing to perform its contractual obligations with 
respect to a private-sector project. Payment is only made, therefore, if the debt service default is 
caused by the government‘s failure to honor the terms of the contract to which it is a party. Such 
sovereign contractual obligations vary depending on project, sector, and country circumstances. 
They could include, but are not limited to, contractual payment obligations (periodic and/or 
termination payments), contractual performance of public counterparties (e.g., electricity off-take 
by a public utility or fuel supply by a SOE for a private power generation project), change of 
law, regulatory actions (such as the setting of electricity tariffs) and ‗traditional‘ political risks 
(currency inconvertibility/non-transferability, expropriation, civil war and civil disturbance).  
However, the Bank seeks to limit coverage to what is necessary to mobilize private financing for 
the project and to ensure a fair allocation of risks between government, lenders, and project 
sponsors. PRGs typically cover outstanding principal and accrued interest of a debt tranche in 
full. PRGs benefit project lenders, or can be structured to benefit the project company. PRGs 
may be offered in local currency on a case-by-case basis.  

26 The Single Borrower Limit (SBL) is a World Bank Board-approved limit applicable to highly creditworthy 
countries.   
27 The Equitable Access Limit is set at 10% of the Bank‘s Statutory Lending Limit (i.e., the Bank‘s total subscribed 
capital, reserves and surplus). 
28The value of the guarantees themselves counts as exposure and hence is counted against the SBL. 

65 

 
                                                            
IBRD Partial Credit Guarantees (PCGs) cover private lenders against default on a specific 
portion of debt (loans or bonds), normally for a public investment project, regardless of the cause 
of default. Guarantee structure and coverage can be determined flexibly on a case-by-case basis 
at the level required by a specific debt instrument and the market, as long as the commercial 
lenders share the credit risk of the borrower in a meaningful manner, and allow the extension of 
debt maturity and/or lower interest rate costs. PCGs have typically covered later date payments, 
but other structures are possible. PCGs allow the government and public sector borrowers to 
achieve extended maturities, lower interest rate costs, higher amounts of commercial debt, and/or 
access to different markets. PCGs may be offered along with an IBRD loan to the same borrower 
for the same project, or on a stand-alone basis. PCGs may be offered in local currency on a case-
by-case basis. 

IBRD Policy-Based Guarantees (PBGs) extend the World Bank's partial credit guarantee 
instrument beyond  financing of investment projects to countries‘ access to private foreign 
financing. Like the Bank‘s development policy loans (DPLs), PBGs help a borrower address 
actual or anticipated development financing requirements and support the government‘s program 
of policy and institutional actions. They can also help governments gain access to credit from 
other financial institutions: in the case of Brazil, the PBGs could help clients at the sub-national 
level obtain loans from local private banks or foreign financial institutions at lower rates and/or 
with longer maturities. PBGs share requirements of DPLs. 

4. 
Credit enhancement with Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligations 
guarantee coverage.  The Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligations (NHSFO) 
guarantee can provide credit enhancements to facilitate primary (up-front) syndication from 
private sector lenders/investors for new loans (net of IBRD financing for a project),  or facilitate 
the replacement of the undisbursed balance of IBRD loans with private sector funding. The 
NHSFO coverage is offered by another World Bank group entity, the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and protects a lender or investor against losses resulting from a 
government‘s failure to make a payment under an unconditional financial payment obligation or 
guarantee.  

Guarantee coverage provided by MIGA is not carried in IBRD‘s books, and therefore, does not 
count towards IBRD exposure t, offering countries the opportunity to raise additional financing 
beyond that which the IBRD balance sheet can support.  

The guarantee provides an additional degree of comfort to private lenders and investors, 
encouraging them to offer lower pricing and improved terms to borrowers with a better risk 
profile.  The borrowing country benefits by maximizing the use of its headroom with IBRD, 
raising incremental financing, and drawing on the complementary strengths of the World Bank 
Group 

5. 
Sale of IBRD Loans. IBRD can act as a syndicate and/or sell part of the borrower‘s 
existing IBRD loans to potential investors, without transferring its preferred creditor status. This 
reduces IBRD‘s exposure to the country and creates space in the portfolio equivalent to the 
amount sold, allowing the country to access an equivalent amount of additional financing from 
IBRD.  If Brazil chooses to use this option, the payments on the portion sold would be made 
directly to the investor. 

66 

 
6. 
 “Back-ended” repayment of IBRD principal.  IBRD loans can be structured to reduce 
the financial risk to the private sector on projects co-financed with IBRD.  For example, IBRD 
loans can feature ―back-ended‖ principal repayments, due after commercial loans have been 
mostly paid back. This allows the borrower to raise additional financing from the private sector. 
The improved risk profile (through the increase in the debt service coverage) allows the borrower 
to receive better terms from the commercial lender. Rising additional financing externally frees 
up IBRD funding for other projects. As an example, the charts below show the debt service for 
IBRD, commercial banks, and IBRD + commercial banks combined with project cash flow.   

   Chart 1– IBRD debt service                                        Chart 2 – Commercial Banks 

Chart 3 – Project debt service and cash flow generation 

7. 
 Using the flexibility available with IBRD loan terms. The IBRD Flexible Loan allows 
borrowers to customize the repayment terms (i.e. grace period, repayment period and 
amortization profile) to meet debt management or project needs – e.g. relatively short maturities 
can be used to encourage loan turnover. Final maturity can be up to 30 years including grace 
period, as long as the weighted average maturity does not exceed 18 years. Brazil should 
continue utilizing this flexibility and choose repayment terms that are more appropriate to 
smooth out debt service profiles. This flexibility could also be used in investment operations by 
tailoring the repayment schedule to match the project‘s expected cash flow or the expected life of 
the investment. This rationalization of the use of the IBRD repayment flexibility as described 
here could have an effect on IBRD‘s exposure and ability to lend to Brazil, but this effect is 
likely to materialize over the longer term.

One of the flexibilities offered by the Bank is the choice between two types of repayment 
schedules, commitment-linked, and disbursement linked. By choosing a disbursement-linked 
repayment schedule each disbursement may be compared with a sub-loan (tranche), with its own 
grace period and final maturity. One can structure the disbursements so that at any given point in 
time during the life of the loan IBRD‘s net credit exposure due to this loan is less than the 
committed loan amount (because as a new tranche disburses prior one(s) are already being repaid 
(amortized)). Other flexibilities offered are the amortization profiles, the Borrowers can choose 
among a bullet, level, annuity and customized repayments. The bank also offers different 
currencies and embedded hedging products for risk management.

CPS Annex 3: Status of Gender Issues in Brazil 

Summary:  

Over the last decades, Brazil has experienced significant improvements along several dimensions 
of gender equality. For instance, education levels for women have increased to the point that, on 
average, women now have more schooling than men do. An inverse gender gap in education can 
be observed in secondary (1.11) and tertiary education (1.29) in 2008. The increase in female 
tertiary education is particularly notable: In 1970 the female to male ratio in tertiary education 
was only 0.6. And although men still predominate in the labor market, women's participation has 
steadily increased over the last two decades to the point that Brazil´s female labor force 
participation rate is higher than for almost all other countries in the region. Besides that, women's 
access to and use of contraceptives has increased which, in addition to the fact that there has 
been an increase in the level of women participation in public life, has resulted in  a sharp drop in 
the fertility rate from 5 births per women in 1970 to 1.94 in 2009. Women´s health indicators 
have improved likewise and are now far better than the average for the region. For instance, the 
maternal mortality ratio (per 100.000 live births) has been reduced from 79 (2000) to 58 (2009) 
and is considerably lower than the regional average of 86 (2009). Skilled birth attendance (97% 
in 2006) and prenatal care (96.7 % in 2007) have improved likewise and show better levels than 
the regional average.  

However, while Brazil has witnessed many advances related to gender equality, a number of 
issues affecting men's and women's welfare remain, especially in particular parts of the country. 
Quantitative and qualitative information indicates that violence among young adult males and 
gender based violence continue to be a serious problem. Data from a WHO multi-country study 
on violence against women show that in Brazil 27% have experienced physical violence by their 
intimate partner at least once in their lives, 10% have experienced sexual violence, and 29% have 
experienced physical or sexual violence or both29. Men are the primary victims of homicides, 
whereas both men´s and women´s homicide rates have increased30. In terms of women´s 
economic opportunities, Brazil continues to register one of the widest gender wage gaps in Latin 
America and the Caribbean - women earn 29% less than men. Black women are the most 
disadvantaged of all groups31. Given the higher educational levels, women´s lower salaries mean 
lower returns to education for them if compared to men. Finally, women´s political participation 
and representation is still very weak in Brazil and has changed little over the last decades. In 
2009, women only held 9% of the seats in the national parliament. 

It has to be mentioned that inequality continues to be a serious problem in Brazil. Thus, when 
analyzing gender issues in Brazil, other factors such as class, race and location have to be 
considered as well. In a country with high Afro-descendant populations (and indigenous 
populations) as in Brazil, gender equality is linked to strategies to reduce social barriers and 
promote racial equality.

Gender equality is at the center of the development agenda in Brazil. The new administration of 
President Rousseff is putting strong emphasis on reducing women‘s vulnerability and on 
promoting gender equality as an engine for sustained economic growth. 

Proposed Engagement Approach 

The CPS will expand the World Bank‘s ongoing analytical and operational activities in the area. 
Key efforts will be focused on assisting Federal, State and Municipal agencies responsible for 
gender issues to increase research and analytical work and inform well targeted gender policies 
and investments.  

The Secretaria de Políticas para as Mulheres (Women‘s Affairs Secretariat) is a key entry 
partner for the World Bank‘s efforts in the area of gender work. Specific technical support to the 
Secretaria would be provided on their gender policy information and monitoring system. In 
addition to that, knowledge exchange and sharing best practices would be another field of 
cooperation between the Bank and that institution. As regards analytical work an ESW has been 
planned on women‘s economic empowerment in Brazil. Moreover, State and Municipal level 
agencies would be engaged through DPLs or SWAP operations at the state level. 

A recent step in terms of improvement of gender equality in Brazil was the creation at the 
National Congress of the Procuradoria Especial da Mulher (Public Defender on Women‘s 
Rights Affairs) in 2009. It is an institution that represents and fights for women´s rights in Brazil. 
It receives and forwards to the appropriate bodies and institutions claims and demands from the 
Brazilian people on gender issues. It also develops legislation and promotes the discussion of 
public policies aimed at guaranteeing the rights of women in Brazil. The Bank plans to 
implement an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) with this institution. The IDF will help 
strengthening the Procuradoria‘s institutional capacity on three fronts: basic operational capacity, 
analytical capacity, and their capacity to monitor implementation of Brazil's advanced legislation 
promoting gender equality.  

The proposed gender work program under the CPS is currently under active preparation and 
discussion within the Country Management and Sector Units as well as with clients and other 
stakeholders, and as such it has not yet been possible to define gender specific parameters for the 
CPS Results Matrix. The definition of operation- and/or activity-specific gender targets and 
monitoring indicators will be completed as integral part of their respective preparation processes.  

Portfolio Review 

A consistent incorporation of gender issues into the World Bank‘s work has proved to increase 
developmental benefits. Thus, besides high impact gender specific initiatives at the State and 
Municipal level through existing or new operations, the World Bank will further explore and 
support ways to mainstream gender issues within its operational work.  

Certain World Bank operations should be treated as priority when it comes to improving gender 
mainstreaming in the Bank‘s portfolio in Brazil. Here, the increased number of gender focused 
interventions, concrete activities aiming to enhance gender equality or the inclusion of gender-
specific indicators will continue to strengthen the Bank‘s role in helping Brazil address gender 
disparities and inequalities that are barriers to women‘s development and inclusion.  

70 

 
 
 
Gender mainstreaming in existing operations: 

Presented below is a list of existing projects where gender specific interventions can be 
incorporated and are being discussed within the Country Management and Sector Units:  

- P088966: BR Municipal APL: Teresina Enhancing Municipal Governance and Quality of 
Life Project –Interventions under the social and economic development component. 
- P094315: BR Municipal APL: Sao Luis Enhancing Municipal Governance and Quality of 
Life Project - Activities under the component of income generating activities and gender 
specific indicators. 
- P099369: Ceará Regional Economic Development: Cidades do Ceará – Interventions to 
promote women's SMEs and complementing activities under SWAp III. 
- P101508: Rio de Janeiro Sustainable Rural Development Project – Inclusion of specific 
gender indicators as for instance in the BR Paraiba 2nd Rural Poverty Reduction Project. 
- P104995: Santos Municipality - Interventions to train women on sectors identified in 
PAD, or female owned SMEs to promote local economic development. 
- P106208: Pernambuco Education Results and accountability – Include gender specific 
components or gender specific indicators given that recent data on school attendance 
show that, on average, boys are 20% more likely to drop out of school than girls (Instituto 
Unibanco, 2010). 
- P108443: São Paulo Sustainable Rural Development and Access to Markets – Include 
gender specific indicators in results framework and monitoring. 
- P122391: Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Urban and Housing Development – Consider 
gender specific indicators, especially on GBV. 
- P106765: Ceará Inclusive Growth already committed to incorporate a gender component. 
Preliminary work for gender component will be conducted during FY12. 

Gender mainstreaming in new operations: 

With regards to new operations the Bank has already committed to including gender specific 
activities and monitoring indicators into the following projects: 

- P126351: Bahia Inclusion and Economic Development DPL 
- P106753: Expanding Opportunities, Enhancing Equity in the State of Pernambuco 
Development Policy Loan 
In addition to that, priority would be given to the incorporation of a gender approach in the 
following projects: 

- P126372 Recife Swap Education and Public Management 
- P126452 Rio Grande do Norte: Regional Development and Governance 

Background 

The Secretaria de Políticas para as Mulheres was created in 2003 to directly and immediately 
advise the President in the formulation, coordination and articulation of policies for women, 
absorbing the Secretariat for Women's Rights under the Ministry of Justice, which was created in 
2002. The Secretaria de Políticas para as Mulheres (National Secretariat for Women‘s Policies) 
is in charge of developing and implementing cross-cutting initiatives with different levels of 
government in order to mainstream women‘s issues in the public policy realm, which represents 

71 

 
 
 
a milestone in the fight for gender equality issues. The creation of executive agencies in charge 
of women affairs policies has been a significant development, although they are still in small 
number when compared to the country‘s 5565 municipalities and 27 states (including Distrito 
Federal). Thus, sub-national levels have begun to act more explicitly in the implementation of 
gender policies. Moreover, it is important to highlight that there has been an important change in 
the Brazilian legislation regarding violence against women. Law 11340, known as the Maria da 
Penha Law, was passed in 2006. This legal instrument aims at protecting women and combating 
impunity for violence against women. It has expanded the demand for changes in the national 
judiciary system, security agencies and those responsible for implementing the law. In 2009, the 
House of Representatives created a special Office in charge of Women Affairs (the Procuradoria 
da Mulher), to receive claims and demands from the Brazilian people and forward them to the 
appropriate bodies and institutions, as well as to develop and approve relevant legislation and 
promote the discussion of public policies to guarantee the rights of women in Brazil. 

Over the last decades, Brazil has experienced significant improvements along several dimensions 
of gender equality: Women's access to and use of contraceptives has increased, resulting in a 
sharp drop in the fertility rate from 5 births per women in 1970 to 1.83 in 2009. Women´s health 
indicators have improved likewise and are now far better than the average for the region. Besides 
that education levels for women have increased to the point that, on average, women now have 
more schooling than men do and an inverse gender gap in education can be observed. Policies 
and institutions have experienced deep changes concurrently. And although men still 
predominate in the labor market, women's participation has steadily increased over the last two 
decades to the point that Brazil´s female labor force participation rate is higher than for almost 
all other countries in the region. 

However, while Brazil has witnessed many advances related to gender, a number of issues 
affecting men's and women's welfare remain: Quantitative and qualitative information indicates 
that violence among young adult males, male violence against women and sexual violence 
against boys and girls continues to be high. Men are the primary victims of homicides, whereas 
both men´s and women´s homicide rates have increased. In terms of women´s economic 
opportunities, Brazil continues to register one of the widest gender wage gaps in Latin America 
and the Caribbean - women earn 29% less than men. Black women are the most disadvantaged 
of all groups. Given the higher educational levels, women´s lower salaries mean lower returns to 
education for them if compared to men. With regards to gender and youths, males are more 
likely to drop out of school, enter the workforce early, engage in violent behavior, and use 
substances. Dropping out of school and early employment may be connected, as young males are 
much more likely to hold a paying job than females32. And finally, Brazilian women continue to 
be highly underrepresented in the political decision-making process. 

Demography/ Poverty/ Social Inequality 

 As in other Latin-American countries, in Brazil the fertility rate decreased remarkably 
during recent decades to 1.94 in 2009.

 

 Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world, with the top quintile holding an 
income share 33 times larger than the share of the bottom quintile. Thus, when analyzing 
gender issues in Brazil, other factors such as class, race and location have to be 
considered as well. In a country with high Afro-descendant populations (and indigenous 
populations) as in Brazil, gender equality is linked to strategies to reduce social barriers 
and promote racial equality. 
Inequality remains a major challenge, encompassing issues of race, location, gender, 
education and labor. For example, white Brazilian men have 2.5 years more of schooling 
on average than black Brazilian men, and this gap is constant throughout different age 
cohorts. 
Inequalities between men and women in the poorest groups can be represented by the 
higher concentration of women-headed households, in food insecurity situation: 39,2% of 
those families are in the North portion of the country and 9% in the Northeast. Besides 
that, the high rate of women employed in informal jobs, which are not protected by the 
social security system and in activities for self-subsistence and unpaid activities reinforce 
the vulnerability of women. 
 Ethnicity does seem to have a stronger correlation with the poverty status of an individual 
than gender33. The incidence of poverty is the highest among individuals residing in 
households where the head is an indigenous person (with a headcount of 38.3%), 
followed by those who reside in households where the head is Parda (30.8%) and then 
black (26.5%). More than half of the poor (58.3%) are Pardos even though individuals 
from Pardo-headed households are only 40.7% of the Brazilian population34.  
In the realm of the Ministry of Social Development the Program Bolsa Família, whose 
benefit is granted preferentially to women, has had significant impact on the conditions of 
life of the beneficiaries and their families, especially in the sphere of survival. A gender 
audit of that CCT found that women‗s domestic status increased because the income 
received was regular, compared with other household members whose jobs and wages are 
uncertain35. According to that audit, urban women emphasized greater ability to make 
choices and decisions, whereas rural women reported improved status due to their ability 
to make household financial contributions and enhanced awareness of Brazilian 
citizenship36.

Legal and institutional framework 

A substantive approach to gender equality requires legislative frameworks to be restructured 
in order to ensure that constitutional commitments are reflected in national legislation. 

33 Analysis of data from the Northeast shows that male- and female-headed households differ only marginally in the 
extent to which they are likely to be poor.

35 Suarez et al., 2006. 
36 ―On the other hand, some argue that conditional cash transfers reinforce gender stereotypes. Many programs 
assume that women are available to carry out the care-related obligations associated with conditional transfers 
without consideration of their breadwinning responsibilities or need for paid work, and to the neglect of any 
recognition of fathering responsibilities. Some Brazilian experts have commented that Bolsa Família utilises the 
´‖culture of mothering‗‖ without necessarily supporting the personal progress of women as active citizens‖ (SRC, 
2008).

 

 Brazil has ratified CEDAW37 and also has signed the Optional Protocol (2001) and 
ratified (2002).  
In Brazil, the legal framework concerning CEDAW, in particular the recommendation of 
the CEDAW Committee to consecrate and guarantee in law the principle of equality 
between men and women, forms part of the Federal Constitution of 1988. The 
Constitution, especially in its article 5, emphasizes that women and men have the same 
rights and obligations, that is, they are equal before the supreme law of the country.  
The Brazilian legal system has sought to harmonize legislation to assure the compliance with 
this constitutional principle: 

 The new Brazilian Civil Code (2003) embraces the constitutional principle of equality 
between women and men, and incorporates equality in marital rights and duties (article 
226 § 5). The new Code revokes articles that, despite being obsolete and not applicable 
since a long time, continued to be part of the legislation. This is the case of the article that 
allowed man to require the woman to prove her virginity for the event of marriage, in 
order to not be rejected and returned to her family with an annulment of the marriage. All 
the articles where the ages of women and men were different have been repaired and 
made equal, establishing, thus, a balance between the sexes.  
 The new Penal Code (2005) revokes articles of moralistic and discriminatory tenor, such 
as that which contemplated the crime of adultery (Art. 240) or that which encouraged 
impunity, such as paragraphs VII and VIII of Art. 107, which extinguished the 
punishability of crimes against custom (rape and other sexual crimes) in the case of 
marriage by the agent with the victim or by the victim with third parties38. 
 The Brazilian Family Code provides a moderate degree of protection for women in 
regard to family matters. The minimum legal age for marriage is 16 years for both 
women and men, on the condition of obtaining authorization from the parents or a legal 
representative. However, the incidence of early marriage remains quite high in Brazil: A 
2004 United Nations report estimated that 17 per cent of girls between 15 and 19 years of 
age were married, divorced or widowed. 
While many governments voice a commitment to gender equality, Brazil has made significant 
progress in integrating gender equality into the broader policymaking agenda.  

 

In 2003, the Secretariat for Polices for Women was created, under the Presidency of the 
Republic. It functions like a Ministry, advising the Presidency and coordinating with 
governmental bodies at the Federal, State and Municipal levels on issues of gender 
equality. The Secretariat for Policies for Women is charged with mainstreaming gender 
and, along with several partners, outlining the nation‘s course for improving gender 
equality within National Plans for Policies for Women. Since the establishment of the 
Secretariat, two National Plans for Policies for Women have been implemented.  
 The Second National Plan for Women outlines nearly 400 policies over eleven 
programmatic axes to be executed during 2008-2011 with the support of twenty-two 
Federal agencies.  
Goals for the current Plan include:  
 Increase the number of children aged 0-6 in publicly-funded or -supported day-
care or pre-school institutions by 12%

Strengthening Family-Based Agriculture (PRONAF) between 2008-2011  
 Increase women‘s participation in PRONAF to 35%  

Education 

 Brazil has made significant progress in terms of education: Not only do boys and girls 
have more years of education, but also have girls caught up with boys – a gap in favor of 
girls in secondary (1.11) and tertiary education (1.29) can be observed in 2008. The 
increase in female tertiary education is particularly notable: In 1970 the female to male 
ratio in tertiary education was only 0.6.  
 However, it is important to highlight that there is still a gender-based segmentation when 
it comes to analyzing undergraduate enrollment, which highly impacts the most valued 
careers in terms of wage. According to the Ministry of Education, in 2007, undergraduate 
courses that showed a higher female enrollment rate were: social services (91%) and 
pedagogy (90%). And the ones that showed the lowest female enrollment rate were: 
computer science (16%) and engineering in general (17%). 
 There are ethnic differences in terms of education outcomes. The establishment of 
curriculum guidelines on the history of Africa and Afro-Brazilian culture, provided in 
Law 10639/2003, and the implementation of PROUNI (the ―University for All‖ 
Program), which provides for affirmative action programs for students from public 
schools, blacks and indigenous peoples, has been a considerable step taken by the 
Brazilian government to deal with that problem. Federal and State universities have 
adopted quotas for black and indigenous women and men. Not to mention the quality of 
public schooling which continues to be an issue of concern in Brazil. At the same time, 
teaching of gender issues is still not in place in schools.  

Labor 

 The female labor force participation rate rose from 41.2% in 1990 to 64.3% in 2009. 
Interestingly, studies have shown that the increase was driven mainly by married 
women39 and women with children, including small children40. As a result of these 
impressive gains, women in Brazil participate in the labor market at higher rates than 
most Latin American countries at comparable levels of income.  
 However the quality of Brazilian women’s participation in the labor force remains an 
issue. Gender wage gaps remain high in Brazil when compared to regional standards41. 
Although the gap has been closing over the last decade, female earnings are still 29% 
lower than male earnings. When controlling for education, age, and hours worked, female

earnings are about 34% less than male earnings42. The gap prevails even when education 
and hours worked are taken into account, and indeed increases with more years of 
education. Factors outside the labor market, such as marriage, children or work 
interruptions, but also the fact that women are concentrated in specific segments of the 
labor market may explain part of this gap. 
 Furthermore, informal employment is significantly more common among women 
compared to men. 53.1% of women are engaged in informal work as opposed to 46.2% 
for men43.  
 Unemployment rates are higher for women (adults: female 9.6 % vs. male 5.1% in 2008), 
in particular young women: 20.5% in comparison to 11.9% for males (ages 15-24) in 
200844. 
 Almost three fourths of the Brazilian female labor force are concentrated in five sectors: 
domestic work (17%), trade and repair (16.8%), education, health and social service 
(16.7%), manufacturing (12.4%) and agriculture (12.2%). The following graph shows 
occupational segregation: 

 Domestic work is an important source of female employment. According to the latest data 
released by the IBGE Survey Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), the 
domestic work accounted 17% of total female occupation in 2009, which corresponds to 
6.7 million women, with two-thirds of them earning less than the minimum wage. One in 
every four domestic workers is between 10 and 17 years old45. However, under the 
Second National Plan for Women, Brazil´s government aims to increase the social 
security coverage of domestic workers by 30%. 
It seems that gender stereotypes have a strong impact on women‘s economic 
opportunities46: Business training offered to women is often gender-biased, particularly in 
rural areas: Women are given courses on traditional roles such as cooking and sewing.

This shuts out many Brazilian women from the opportunity to work in higher growth 
sectors or to use cutting-edge technology. 
 The Women’s Economic Opportunity Index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative 
scoring model, constructed from 26 indicators, that measures specific attributes of the 
environment for women employees and entrepreneurs in 113 economies. Five category 
scores are calculated from the unweighted mean of underlying indicators and scaled from 
0-100, where 100=most favorable. These categories are: Labor policy and practice 
(which comprises two sub-categories: Labor policy and Labor practice); Access to 
finance; Education and training; Women‘s legal and social status; and the General 
business environment. Each category or sub-category features either four or five 
underlying indicators. Excluding Canada and the US, Brazil edges Chile and Mexico for 
the best score in the Americas.

Not specified 

Women and agriculture/ rural women 

 Officially, Brazilian women have the same ownership rights as men, but inequalities 
persist. Access to land is legally guaranteed to women and land can therefore be granted 
to a man or a woman, irrespective of marital status.  
 However, almost all the beneficiaries of the 1996 land reform were men; women were 
considered to be their husbands‘ dependents. As a reaction to that, the Ministry of 
Agrarian Reform introduced a quota system that attributes one-third of the funds for 
financing agrarian reform to women49. Nonetheless In 2007, women beneficiaries of 
agrarian reform accounted for 55.8% of total beneficiaries (SIPRI - INCRA).  
 By law, Brazilian women have access to bank loans, but those in rural areas have more 
difficulty exercising this right. In response, the government recently introduced a quota 
system in rural development financing programs. Many official documents in the banking 
and credit sector are still gender-biased, with masculine pronouns throughout. Loans are 
often granted to the head of the household, which effectively limits married women‘s 
access to bank loans. 

Health 

 General health indicators in Brazil have remarkably improved over the last decades – this 
is also true for gender-specific health indicators. For instance, the maternal mortality ratio 
(per 100.000 live births) has been reduced from 79 (2000) to 58 (2009) and is 
considerably lower than the regional average of 86 (2009). Other gender-specific health 
indicators, such as skilled birth attendance and prenatal care have improved likewise and 
show better levels than the regional average (Annex I).

 The increase of AIDS cases among women must be observed. In June 2006, 67.2% of the 
total happened among men and 32.8% among women. In 2003, the incidence of AIDS 
was 25.4 and 16.1 by 100.000 people for men and women, respectively. Such numbers 
show that the ratio between the rates of contamination of both sexes has been decreasing. 
 About one third of all people living with HIV in Central and South America live in 
populous Brazil, where early and ongoing HIV prevention and treatment efforts have 
contained the epidemic. The adult HIV prevalence in Brazil has remained well under 1% 
for at least the past decade.  
 According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of teenage pregnancy has 
fallen about 22% during the second half of the last decade. Between 2000 and 2009, it 
fell about 34.6%.50 During the last 2 years 871.2 Million condoms were distributed 
among the whole population. People can access them freely at the public health stations. 
The most remarkable reduction in teenage pregnancy has been achieved in the poor 
Northeast Region (26%).  

Violence 

 Violence against women is common and represents a widespread social problem. Data 
from a WHO multi-country study on violence against women show that in Brazil 27% 
have experienced physical violence by their intimate partner at least once in their lives, 
10% have experienced sexual violence, and 29% have experienced physical or sexual 
violence or both51. Furthermore, 43.1% of cases of physical aggression against women 
were committed in their own residence. 
 Levels of deadly violence against women have steadily increased since 1980. However, 
in the Northeast Brazil the female homicide rate increased markedly since 2003, far more 
than the average for the rest of the country.  
 To combat specifically domestic violence in Brazil, the Maria da Penha Law was passed 
in 2006 and represents one of the most advanced examples of domestic violence 
legislation. It is mentioned as exceptional ―significant legal advance at the national level‖ 
in UN´s Progress of the World´s Women 2010. It creates multiple mechanisms, including 
specialized tribunals and psychosocial assistance for victims. In August 2007, the 
President of Brazil announced US$590 million to implement the Maria da Penha Law on 
violence against women. The budgetary pledge is a leading example of a substantial 
allocation for implementation of legislation52.  
 Besides that, the Ministry of Justice of Brazil has introduced compulsory educational 
curricula on violence against women for police trainees in actions promoted by the 
Ministry. 

 Homicide rates are particularly high amongst male youths. In 2002, youth homicides 
represented 38.7% of all homicides in Brazil53, with some states having rates as high as

40%, even though young people constituted only 19% of the total population. Young 
women‘s homicide rates are one-tenth those of young men, but they still have higher 
homicide rates than females of all ages. Death by homicide is much more common 
among Afro-Brazilians, who have a higher incidence of poverty, than white victims in 
Brazil. Approximately 102 deaths per 100,000 young Afro-Brazilians are due to 
homicide, compared with 39.2 deaths per 100,000 among young white Brazilians. The 
difference by race is much larger among young people than among adults54. 

Political representation 

 Women´s political participation and representation is still very weak in Brazil and has 
changed little over the last decades. The table below shows different levels of decision-
making and compares Brazil´s rates with Costa Rica55:

In the last decade, affirmative action policies have been expanded, especially in 
education, but also with initiatives in the labor world. The legislation provides, since 
1990, disabled people hiring incentives mechanisms; the use of such mechanisms has 
expanded in the last years. President Cardoso instituted a National Program for 
Affirmative Action in 2002. Its primary method of action used quotas. The quota policy 
has been extended under the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The GoB is 
seeking to increase the number of women, Afro-Brazilians and disabled people in 
different areas of society. Quotas have been approved in many public universities 
specifically for the placement of Afro-Brazilians.

Brazil has made significant progress in terms of labor law/regulations in favor of gender 
equality.  Also, the country has introduced several mechanisms in order to conceal women´s 
reproductive role with employment. The regulations can be grouped as follows: 

Regulations regarding the period of pregnancy, birth-giving and lactation:  

 Government mandates paid maternity leave for women employees. The minimum length 
of paid maternity leave is 120 calendar-days. 100% wages is paid by the government 
during maternity leave. (Decreto-Lei No. 5.452 (Art. 172) Temporary Constitutional 
Provisions Act (Art. 10)) 
 The mandatory minimum length of paternity leave is 5 calendar days. (Temporary 
Constitutional Provisions Act (Art. 10). Paternity leave is paid (source of cash benefits 
unavailable in Gender and Law Library)) 
 Lactancy is allowed 2 times per day for 30 min. each until the baby completes 6 months. 
Equality before the law: 

 Women and men have equal capacity by law. (Constitution (Art. 5) and Civil Code (Arts. 
1511 and 1567) 
 Married men and married women have equal capacity by law. (Statute of Married 
Women) 
 Women and men have equal ownership rights over moveable and immoveable property. 
(Constitution (Arts. 5 and 189) and (Civil Code)) 
 Women and men have equal inheritance rights over moveable and immovable property. 
(Civil Code (Book V)) 
Anti-discrimination: 

 The exam of pregnancy is forbidden to ask for by the employer when hiring a female 
employee. (Lei Nº 9.799, 26 de maio de 1999.) 
 Women can work the same night hours as men, they can work in all industries. (Labor 
Code). 
 Pregnant and nursing mothers can work the same hours and in the same industries as men 
and other women. (Labor Code)

 Arbitrary dismissal or dismissal without just cause is prohibited for a pregnant employee, 
from the date the pregnancy is confirmed to five months after delivery. (Brazil 
Temporary Constitutional Provisions Act (Art. 10)) 
Others: 

 Even though part-time work was permitted, its legal status was only established in 
December of 1998, with a legal instrument called ―Medida Provisória‖. With this 
mechanism, the executive modified the labor legislation and considered to be a part-time 
job those activities whose total duration does not exceed 25 hours per week. In addition, 
the new law states that the salary to be paid to workers under the part-time agreement will 
be proportional to the time worked relative to full-time workers who have the same 
functions. In August 2001, this ―Medida Provisória‖ has reedited but with no changes in 
the definitions of part-time contracts60.

 
Underutilized systems for 
performance management (program

 
Large budget rigidities (e.g. 
revenue earmarking and mandatory

Significant budget changes at 
approval and during the fiscal year 
weaken link with policy, reduce 
predictability and compromises

of Bolsa Família in the municipalities and provide incentives to the municipalities who are performing satisfactorily.  The index combines four measures of 
institutional and program management performance. On the basis of this index, MDS transfers funds to municipalities for the management of the program. 
Through these incentives, MDS intends to support the improvement in the quality of the Bolsa Família management at the local level and to help municipalities 
perform the actions that are under their responsibilities.

progress since 2000 in raising learning 
performance. Despite the progress, 
Brazil is still quite far from the 
average learning levels, secondary 
education completion rates, and 
student flow efficiency of OECD and 
other middle-income countries, and 
there is no room for complacency. 

Brazil‘s 20% higher education 
participation rate is one of the lowest 
in LAC and is grossly inadequate to 
support the country‘s ambitions as a 
fast-growing, globally competitive 
economy.  

The ―S‖ system of publicly funded but 
industry-managed vocational training 
for primary school graduates serves a 
relatively small population 
(overwhelmingly from the top income 
quintiles), has high unit costs and is 
not always able to place graduates in 
good jobs. There is also inadequate 
coordination between the ―S‖ system 
and the formal education system.

large proportion of the poor are not yet 
covered by the PSF, especially those 
located in rural areas or in the

integrated health care networks 

Despite the high and increasing 
incidence of chronic diseases, which 
are best prevented and treated through 
integrated and continuous treatment 
arrangements across different levels of 
care and different types of providers, 
the health system is organized mostly 
to provide acute care through stand-
alone, specialized facilities. Network 
arrangements, in which different 
providers work together to manage 
and provide health care, are rare. 

The HIV/AIDS epidemic is 
concentrated in group most at risk, 
including men who have sex with 
men, sex workers, injecting drug 
users, and prisoners. Given the 
evolving epidemic, effective 
implementation of responses tailored 
for different risk groups and regions of 
the country are needed.

Results area 2.4: Expanded access to affordable housing for low-income groups  

Brazil has a significant housing deficit 
of 7 million units, and the new 
demand is forecast to reach 23 million 
units by 2023. This is estimated to 
require investments of R$3 trillion 
(about US$1.9 trillion) 

Goals of MCMV 2 entail promoting 
improvements in housing supply. One 
challenge is to provide a range of 
housing solutions that encompass new 
construction (through MCMV), but 
also purchase of existing units on the 
market, slum upgrading, rental units, 
and incremental construction through 
sites-and-services solutions. Another 
challenge is to expand access to 
housing finance especially for low-
income groups (mortgage debt 
outstanding was less than 5% of GDP 
in 2010).

Results area 4.4 More effective disaster risk management 

Disaster Risk Management (DRM) has 
not been a top priority because for 
several decades Brazil had not 
witnessed major catastrophic events, 
but this changed after the floods and 
landslides in Rio in 2010 and 2011, 
prompting the Government to take a 
more proactive role in addressing the 
problem. 

There are large discrepancies in the 
preparedness of different States and 
municipalities. Few institutions are 
involved in the preparation of 
contingency planning as has been 
attested in recent disasters. 

Despite the efforts of some States to 
develop forecasting and early warning 
systems, their level of resolution has 
not been sufficiently precise.

CPS Annex 5: Brazil Country Partnership Strategy FY08-F11 

COMPLETION REPORT  

I. 

Executive Summary  

The FY08-FY11 CPS supported the implementation of key priorities of the second Lula 
Administration in (a) competitiveness (b) equity, (c) environment and (d) public sector 
management. Lending increased to reach around US$11.5 billion (in FY08-11), more than 
doubling the initial forecasts. Eighty% of total commitments during the CPS period went to sub-
national governments in multi-sectors operations that sought to foster improved fiscal outcomes, 
better public sector practices and service delivery. During this CPS, Brazil became IFC‘s largest 
new business global partner. Loans and investments, even if large, pale in comparison with the 
government program.  Therefore the WBG moved to emphasize a strong demand driven 
approach with emphasis on the delivery of knowledge intensive products and innovation. The 
CPS built on the strong program that it received from the previous strategy, emphasis on policy 
operations and AAA to deliver results. At the same time, the IFC has been moving to increasing 
playing a role of strategic advisor. Coordination between the IFC and the Bank around common 
strategic goals has strengthened.  

The CPS has supported the authorities in scaling up efforts to take a global leader role in 
environment to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change The Bank has supported the 
government in successful efforts to address the fiscal challenges of the weaker states and in 
introducing modern public administration practices. The WGB have been engaging increasingly 
more with states to develop the competitive agenda. The contribution of results towards an 
equitable Brazil remained strong as in the previous CPS. The CPS AAA program focused on 
―how‖ rather than ―what‖ and did so by incorporating knowledge in lending. Innovations in 
lending are having an impact in program design throughout the Bank (e.g. through the new 
policies for Municipal DPLs and new design proposals such as P4Rs). The Completion Report 
rates both the Program and Bank performance as satisfactory.  

II. 

Progress towards Long-term Development Outcomes 

During this CPS period, Brazil continued to consolidate its position as a major regional and 
global player while reducing social and environmental risks. Increased macroeconomic 
stability reflected in lower inflation, deepening of credit markets, and sustainable public debt 
management provided a platform for economic expansion and gained the country investment 
grade in April 2008. Brazil‘s economy grew an average 4% during the CPS period (2008-2010) 
despite the global crisis hitting the country hard in the last quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 
2009, with a cumulative contraction of 6.0% during this period.  The authorities‘ timely policy 
response contained the negative effects of the global crisis and laid the groundwork for the 
recovery, which limited the contraction in 2009 to 0.6% of GDP and led to a rate of economic 
growth of 7.5% in 2010.  Macroeconomic resilience was due both to the strength of the financial 

125 

 
 
 
 
 
system and the combination of fiscal responsibility, exchange rate flexibility, and a credible 
commitment to inflation targeting—the pillars of the successful macroeconomic strategy that 
Brazil has pursued over the last decade. During the crisis, as the supply of new credit from 
private banks to the economy fell significantly, the expansion of credit by public banks played a 
critical role in preventing a potentially large output loss.  

Brazil has grown rapidly, but the gap with the advanced economies remains. During the 
second half of the twentieth century, Brazil‘s output per worker grew at an annual rate of 2.1%. 
Traditional aggregate growth accounting exercises suggest that total factor productivity growth 
averaged 0.6% during this 50-year period.1 The evidence for the more recent period suggests that 
aggregate TFP growth has accelerated, reaching 1.1% per year during 2002-2008, or about the 
rate of growth of output per worker in the U.S. economy during the previous three decades. 
Thus, while Brazil appears to be accompanying the rate of global technological change, the 
aggregate efficiency of the Brazilian economy would have to grow at an even faster rate in order 
to contribute to reducing the country‘s relative income gap with respect to the more advanced 
economies.  

A fairly high and rigid level of public expenditure continues to limit Brazil’s efforts to 
sustain a higher economic growth path. With public expenditure close to 40% of GDP and a 
system of rigid entitlements and expenditures, the margin for public investment— 2.6% of GDP 
in 2010— is insufficient, under the current institutional arrangements, to close the major 
infrastructure gaps, which to some observers remain a major constrain to a higher rate of 
economic growth. Brazil also needs increasing the rate of private investment and overall factor 
productivity growth to sustain faster increases in income.  

Brazil is on the way to meet all its MDGs.  
 First, over the last decade, poverty reduction has been substantial with incidence dropping 
from 36% in 2003 to 21.4% in 2009, extreme poverty dropping from 15 % to 7% during the 
same period (using official national methodologies). While economic growth has been a 
driver of poverty reduction (around 50%), other factors include (a) the income of the poorest 
has grown faster than that of the average population, and (b) social protection programs have 
contributed around 25% to the reduction. With inequality decreasing during the same period 
(6 point drop in the Gini Coefficient), Brazil posts a clear achievement of pro-poor growth.   
 Second, Brazil has experienced rapid improvements in education outcomes over the last 
decade: (a) the average years of schooling has gone up from 5.6 to 7.2: (b) the primary 
completion rate went from 40% to 72%; (c) the growth in the secondary enrollment is the 
fastest in Latin America, as have been the improvements in PISA learning outcomes; and (d) 
early childhood education is expanding fast. A culture of assessment of educational 
outcomes has taken root in the country.   
 Third, life expectancy has gradually increased and infant mortality has decreased sharply: 
mortality rates from vaccination-preventable diseases in children are negligible and diarrheal 
deceases cause less than 7% of all deaths among children five years of age. The number of 
new HIV/AIDS cases has leveled off, but is still high for the Latin America region. The 
prevalence of malnutrition among children younger than five years has been more than 
halved since the 1990s; 98% of children under five have an adequate weight. However, 

126 

 
 
maternal mortality rates have shown slower progress and remain high for a high middle 
income country at 58 per 100,000 live births (it was 120 in 1990).  
 Fourth, Brazil has expanded water services rapidly during this period as a result of the 
government‘s Accelerated Growth Program (PAC) initiative to finance infrastructure 
investments, including water and sanitation.  The population with access to potable water 
increased by 8 million people since 2007 to reach 169.9 million in 2009. Similarly, 108.8 
million people had access to sanitation services in 2009 compared to 101 million in 2007.  

The commitment to a Green Brazil has increasingly emerged as a top national priority and 
is an area where the country seeks global leadership. During this period, Brazil began 
reversing the trends of environmental deterioration and consolidated a strategy to prepare for the 
impact of climate change and to reduce carbon emissions. In December 2008, the Federal 
Government launched the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2009-Law.) The plan 
calls for a 70% decrease in the rate of deforestation by 2017. In addition, Brazil announced a 
"voluntary commitment" to reduce CO2 emissions by between 36.1 and 38.9% in the next ten 
years. Brazil is one of the most pro-active countries in the region in pursuing Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and third only to China and India in the world. There 
are at least 255 ongoing CDM projects that account for about 7% of total certified CDM 
emission reductions.  

   III. Program Performance 

The Program Performance Evaluation reports on CPS program as revised by the Progress Report. 
In the demand driven framework characteristic of large upper-middle income countries, the 
World Bank Group in Brazil has accompanied the authorities in the implementation of national 
policies in those areas where its advice and financial contribution were sought. Therefore, in the 
true sense of a partnership, the attribution of results is shared, with the understanding that the 
authorities lead in design and implementation, while the Bank seeks to provide value added 
through knowledge products, often in the lending operations. Because the Bank‘s financial 
support pales in comparison to Brazil‘s level of public expenditure and investment across all 
areas of engagement, the CPS program relied for impact on the development of innovative 
approaches to policy design and implementation, and focused on improving (a) institutional 
design, (b) the efficiency in the use of public funds and (c) the leveraging of development 
actions.  

Equitable Brazil 

The CPS made important contribution towards a more equitable Brazil building on the 
satisfactory performance under the previous strategy. A strong on-going program and the 
policy continuity between the first and second Lula administrations helped delivery of results as 
did the innovations in instruments and approaches that were imbedded in the various operations.  
AAA complemented the lending program and helped the government in evaluating policy 
options. The CPS contributed as well to a broader and a more transparent discussion of social 
outcomes nationwide.2  

127 

 
 
 
 
Education 

The CPS contributed to the delivery of positive education outcomes in line with the 
priorities of government for the sector, which focused on (a) releasing the financing constrain 
for the poor (access), (b) improving quality and (c) monitoring performance. The Bolsa Família 
Program (BFP) has been an important instrument in expanding access to education for the poor; 
86% of the children covered by the program, most of them from poor households, were attending 
school in 2011. BFP impact on secondary education has been even higher with 80% of 
beneficiaries attending school compared with 72% for non-beneficiaries. In addition, regarding 
access, the Bank has supported the design and implementation of early childhood development 
policies with a focus on: i) developing critical normative and oversight functions (definition of 
ECD curriculum guidelines, teacher standards, facility standards) and ii) working with selected 
municipalities in implementing innovative programs with potential demonstration effects.3 The 
IFC, in turn, has supported adult education as a way to increase incomes (graduates with 
technical and professional qualifications can double or triple incomes) and improve productivity 
at firm level. The number of adult students enrolled by IFC clients increased from 85,000 at the 
end of CY 2007 to 763,764 in December 2009. In CY 2009, half of these students were women.4 

The quality of education in Brazil is improving and greater attention is paid to monitoring 
results. The quality of education index, IDEB, for early primary improved from 3.8 in 2005 to 
4.2 in 2007 to 4.6 in 2009. The secondary IDEB has also improved from 3.4 in 2005 to 3.6 in 
2009. The IDEB is measured every two years and hence no more recent information is available; 
however, complementary information confirms the progress. PISA results show that Brazil has 
achieved significant, sustained progress since 2000 in raising learning performance, particularly 
in math, posting the fastest improvement in the Latin America.  Brazil‘s 52 score point increase 
in math from 2000-2009 was one of the largest on record and Brazil‘s average score across the 
three disciplines tested (reading, math and science) rose 33 points over the decade, from 368 to 
401. This represents the third largest improvement of any country over the period, after 
Luxembourg (38 point increase) and Chile (37 point increase). The Bank has contributed to 
quality enhancement in education through its AAA program by engaging on key issues of 
education quality that are not fully addressed by current policies – especially a) teacher quality, 
b) repetition rates and age-grade distortion, which remains the highest in Latin America, by far; 
and c) secondary education quality. The AAA has enhanced the Ministry‘s capacity to support 
rigorous evaluation of promising reforms and programs at the State and Municipal levels, so as 
to support the spread of evidence-based policies. 5  

Health  

The Bank supported efforts at expanding universal health insurance (SUS) created in 1998 
and improving health services and outcomes overall. SUS coverage has increased from 46.3% 
in 2007 to 52.7% in 2010.  Private insurance covers an additional 25 % of the population and 
26%% accesses SUS on a discretionary basis. Bank operations with the Federal and regional 
governments have supported achievement of this and other health objectives. The focus of the 
Family Extension APL series, with the Federal government, has been the nationwide 
implementation of the primary health care system, which includes increasing SUS coverage. The 
highly satisfactory rating of the first operation of the series (Family Extension Project—APL I) 
highlighted the achievement of results and the quality of the design.6 The Bank also contributed 
to reducing mortality and morbidity from communicable deceases nationwide through VIGISUS 

128 

 
II‘s, rated as satisfactory on results. 7 The BFP has contributed to lower chronic malnutrition by 
providing health and nutrition benefits to 10 million pre-school children and their mothers. As a 
global leader and innovator in the fight against HIV/AIDS, Brazil posts major gains both in 
incidence and treatment; the contribution to these achievements of the recently completed 
HIV/AIDS project was rated as satisfactory. 8 The Bank is supporting the implementation of the 
2006 Health Covenants initiative which grants states greater flexibility in managing health care 
by creating regional centers that encourage the formation of networks of health delivery 
institutions and set the stage for results-based management. The Bank contribution to this effort 
is coming 
though 
the Health Network Formation and Quality Improvement Project 
(QUALISUS-REDE) APL/SWAP that is focused on regions with a minimal level of Family 
Health Care coverage and functional surveillance systems indicators to support the transition to 
integrated regional health care networks with medium complexity.  

Complementary support for achieving health objectives is being provided to states either 
through direct lending or inclusion of health components in multi-sector SWAP/APL 
operations. These activities have included improvements in emergency care and health 
regulation as well as integration of the flow of patients among different levels of health care 
through several State operations (Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Acre). The experience in 
Bahia9 illustrates how the State-focused approach complements the Federal efforts and provides 
lessons of national benefit. In the first phase of an APL, the project contributed towards the 
statewide extension of the family-care primary health system, paralleling national efforts. The 
persistent high neonatal and maternal mortality levels in the State motivated a deep stock-taking 
that has zeroed in on the link between the availability of potable water as a key driver of health 
improvements. Thus, follow-up operation Bahia Integrated Health and Water Management 
Project (which was approved on November 2, 2010) focuses attention to health and water to 
improve health outcomes at the State level. IFC has contributed to Brazil‘s health goals through a 
number of investments and advisory engagements. For instance, it made a US$30.4 million 
investment in Rede d‘Or, a healthcare company that targets middle- and low-income patients; it 
signed a PPP mandate with the State of Bahia to manage concession of a hospital serving poor 
communities in Salvador.   

Water and Sanitation  

Access to clean water and sanitation increased. According to official statistics the percentage 
of households with access to clean water increased to 84.4% in 2009 from 83.2% in 2007. The 
increase in sanitation was from 51.1% to 52.5% during the same period.  The contribution of the 
Bank in water built on a long-standing engagement at both the Federal and State levels 10 that has 
been focusing on bulk water supply and access in both rural and urban areas, as well as programs 
for better efficiency and corporate governance. The efforts on the later point have gone into the 
expansion of the WSS Information System (SNIS)11 that provides open and detailed local-level 
information on the status of water and sanitation services. This information is helping formulate 
and implement national policies and programs, including innovative subsidy schemes focusing 
on the poor using an output-based approach. The number of municipalities reporting to SNIS 
increased from 270 at the beginning of the CPS period to 2,500 now.  The Bank‘s contribution to 
better sanitation results focused on: (i) increasing access to wastewater collection and treatment 
services at the State and Municipal levels; (ii) promoting an integrated approach to water 

129 

 
 
resources management and water supply and sanitation (IWRM-WSS); and (iii) integrating 
IWRM-WSS and urban upgrading activities as an effective way to control water resources 
pollution.  In addition, the recently completed Low Income Sanitation Technical Assistance 
Project (PROSANEAR) focused on the urban poor, providing technical assistance and financing 
a stock of sub-projects in over 30 municipalities while incorporating participatory methods in the 
preparation of WSS and urban upgrading projects. 12 IFC has also begun investing in water 
companies, making US$84.3 million in loans to three companies in 2010. For example, the State 
water company of Santa Catarina used a US$23 million-equivalent IFC local currency loan to 
buy and install water meters, update customer databases, and automate its production and 
distribution systems. The company is using the investment to increase revenues, cut water losses, 
and improve energy efficiency.   

Regional disparities  

The ratio of per capita household income in the Northeast to the national average has been 
increasing, going from 59.6%% in 2007 to 64% in 2009 driven by the overall expansion of 
the regional and systematic and consistent government targeted policies the WBG has 
supported. The Bank has been supporting two interrelated government initiatives that have been 
operating in the Northeast to help improve income opportunities. These are the Poverty 
Reduction Program (PCPR) and the complementary Land Reform Program, Crédito Fundiário. 
A recent review estimates that multiple World Bank operations in support of the PCPR have 
directly benefited approximately 11 million people by assisting communities meet priority 
infrastructure needs, and by helping develop governance structures that build social capital.13 
Impact surveys have found that these interventions are well targeted (75% of beneficiaries are 
extremely poor), that efforts to include women, minorities and indigenous populations have 
yielded positive results, and that sustainability and satisfaction ratings are high. As coverage of 
basic water and electricity services increases in the rural populations of the Northeast and other 
regions, the demand of the communities has shifted to expand their economic opportunities, and 
therefore the design of the new rural development operations under the CPS has prioritized 
designs that help the communities of small farmers develop sustainable links to the market, 
domestic and abroad. 14 In support for the Crédito Fundiário reform initiative where self-selected 
groups of landless people identify un-or-under-used farms that they wish to acquire the Bank‘s 
Land-based Poverty Alleviation Project helped 48,000 families, mostly in the Northeast, obtain 
land and settle. Its ICR reports significant increases in the incomes and assets of the beneficiaries 
compared with control groups, but also a high rate of turnover among beneficiaries. 15 The IFC in 
turn financed ten operations in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil during the CPS period 
for a total of US$389 million in infrastructure, financial services, and manufacturing. 16  

Social Protection and Housing for the Poor  

The Bank has contributed to Brazil’s successful efforts to put in place an exemplary social 
protection system as well to provide opportunities of affordable housing for the poor.  Bank 
technical support for BFP has covered design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation, as 
well as financial resources, small by comparison to the overall program. BFP is now reaching 
over 12 million families (25% of the population) in all municipalities. It is well targeted and has 

130 

 
 
 
contributed to reduce poverty17 as well as increase female labor force participation. BFP is now 
the core of Brazil‘s social protection institutional framework as several other social protection 
programs have been merged into it.18  The Bank participated as well in the implementation of an 
ambitious government program that provides housing for the poor and that expanded between 
2003 and 2010 by about 400% to reach 1.2 million units. The Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV) 
program, launched in 2009 as part of measures adopted to address the impact of the global 
financial crisis, has been a key driver of this expansion, helping reach the low and middle income 
households.19 Bank support for housing came through the Housing sector Technical Assistance 
Loan (TAL) to the Ministry of Cities, which closed in December 2010, as well as its Non 
Lending TA (NLTA) to the Secretariat of Economic Policy under the Ministry of Finance 
focused on the sustainability of the MCMV initiative through private sector involvement in low-
income housing market with attention to the identification of opportunities to expand access to 
capital markets and land. 20 The Bank has also been supporting Brazil‘s slum upgrading program, 
the largest in the world. The MCMV program is naturally dependent on private sector home 
builders to deliver units needed to fill the housing gap. The IFC has developed a program in 
Brazil to target homebuilders and developers. So far, it has signed one transaction with 
Brookfield Incorporações for US$47 million to finance construction of low income housing 
developments in major cities.  

Sustainable Brazil 

The CPS contributed to the delivery of environmental outcomes and to the consolidation of 
the environment agenda in Brazil to face the challenge of climate change. Reduced levels of 
deforestation, larger areas under protection and expansion of areas under sustainable 
development that combined attention to economic activity, preservation and biodiversity have 
been achieved. In addition, the CPS period also saw a consolidation of the environment program 
with the government committed to lead in the climate change agenda and the WBG supporting 
with lending and AAA and active IFC engagement. A strong AAA agenda and the 2009 SEM 
DPL have been supporting the mitigation side of developing and implementing Brazil‘s National 
Climate Change Action Plan. Moreover, the Bank has used GEF projects to support development 
of projects under the Clean Development Mechanism. On the adaptation side, the strategy 
supported increased resilience of potable water supply systems, enhanced monitoring and alert 
systems for extreme climate events, investments in preventive infrastructure.21  Both the Bank 
and the IFC have been active supporters of the Amazon and Cerrado initiatives, with the IFC 
shifted its approach from an emphasis on investments to an advisory-led strategy.  CPS has also 
contributed to the mainstreaming of environment practices throughout government and with 
special attention to financial institutions and investments. 

Active and timely AAA has elucidated policy options that situate Brazil at the forefront of 
the environment agenda without sacrificing its growth prospects. The ―Low Carbon 
Emissions Scenarios in Brazil‖, launched in 2010, produced a reference scenario by anticipating 
the future evolution of Brazil‘s GHG emissions. This study identifies and quantifies actions that 
could be taken to mitigate emissions and increase carbon uptake, assesses the costs of 
implementing low carbon actions, identifies potential implementation barriers, and explores 
measures to overcome them. Based on all these inputs, the study builds a low carbon scenario 
that meets development expectations and estimates the macroeconomic effects and additional 
financing needs of shifting from the reference scenario to a lower carbon pathway. The findings 

131 

 
confirm the adequacy of the current strategy that early-on focuses on halting deforestation and 
then, as emissions form deforestation stabilize, addresses the growing challenge of emissions 
from energy, transport, and waste management sectors. More than 30 recognized Brazilian 
experts participated directly in the elaboration of this study and dozens more were consulted, 
including government representatives, so as to integrate the best available knowledge and avoid 
duplication of efforts22 

The annual rate of deforestation in Brazil is decreasing anchored on an aggressive program 
of increasing protected areas.  The CPS program contributed to reduce deforestation, improve 
land management practices, and preserve biodiversity through operations at the Federal and sub-
national levels. Concrete achievements on the ground include, in 2009, a reduction in the rate of 
deforestation to 740,000 hectares, equivalent to a fall of 53% from the 1.48 million hectare 
average annual level of the base period of 2005-2007. Given the large share of emissions 
accounted for by deforestation (over 40% of Brazil‘s total in 2008), this reduction is an early, 
important step towards meeting the NCCAP‘s overall target for  national emissions reduction---
Brazil‘s voluntary commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by between 36.1 and 38.9% in the next 
ten years. This positive result has been achieved through tighter enforcement and a rapid 
expansion in the protected areas under the leadership of ARPA (Amazon Region Protected Areas 
Program), supported by a domestically managed Environmental Endowment Fund23,  GEF/IBRD 
TA and financing from several other multilateral sources.  Protected areas, including those of 
strict preservation and those of sustainable use, stand at 120 million ha (2010), while they stood 
at 79 million in 2007.   

The areas under sustainable forest management have expanded to reach 3.3 million ha of 
public/private lands, an increase over 2.7 million in 2007. BNDES has played a key role in 
this and other aspects of the environment agenda, with IBRD support under the SEM DPL series. 
In particular, BNDES has led efforts to introduce sustainable Natural Forest Management of 
private and public areas through improved and expanded programs that include concessional 
loans for small farmers to establish forest plantations and for the restoration of deforested areas 
in private lands. In this context, BNDES recently launched agro-ecological zoning regulations 
banning from eligibility any new plantations in the Amazon and Pantanal regions and enforcing 
compliance with environment regulations along the productive chains in areas such as sugar-
alcohol, livestock and soy. Complementary efforts under the program have been strengthening 
the linkage between sustainable agricultural practices, land improvement (reducing land 
deterioration), and poverty reduction.24  The IFC has been an active player in the implementation 
of this agenda by engaging the private sector in addressing the environmental and social 
difficulties associated with cattle ranching and beef processing in the Amazon. 25 

In addition, the CPS expanded its attention to biodiversity. The growing biodiversity agenda 
built on previous efforts such as the Brazil National Biodiversity (PROBIO), rated as 
satisfactory, and serving as a model for numerous other biodiversity projects in Brazil. The 
Integrated Management of Aquatic Resources in the Amazon (AquaBio) is supporting the 
mainstreaming of a multi-stakeholder, integrated management approach to the conservation and 
sustainable use of freshwater biodiversity in public policies and programs in the Brazilian 
Amazon River Basin. 26  

132 

 
 
A drive to produce more energy from renewable resources and/or save energy from 
efficiency projects has been launched with success. BNDES favorable financing for renewable 
energy over fossil fuel based projects, through a credit line for renewable energy projects, has 
increased the number of renewable energy operations from 16 in 2006 to 75 in 2009. Currently, 
BNDES has a pipeline of 20 wind projects distributed in over 90 wind farms with total installed 
capacity of 2,400 MW. The small hydro (<30 MW) pipeline includes 23 projects, totaling an 
additional 2,450 MW of new installed capacity. Overall, this expansion of the portfolio 
represents incremental renewable energy generation capacity of 165,000 TJ/year (almost three 
times the level of the outcome indicator target for this area under the SEM DPL Program). In 
addition, BNDES is promoting energy efficiency by requiring high standards of energy 
efficiency for new equipment financed from funds provided by BNDES.  IFC also signed loans 
with five Brazilian companies to finance renewable energy, energy-efficiency, and cleaner-
production projects for a total US$143 million. 27 

Improved effectiveness of environmental/social management system 
in 
financial 
institutions: Effectiveness of environmental/ social management systems in financial institutions 
has improved: BNDES has committed to mainstreaming social, regional, and environmental 
sustainability criteria in all its operations. In November 2010, BNDES adopted Resolution 
2023/10 ―Social and Environmental Responsibility and Governance‖ (the SERG) that 
strengthens the links among BNDES social, environmental, and corporate responsibility policies. 
The Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) governing BNDES presents an updated screening 
process regarding the social and environmental requirements, binding for all operations.  

The per-capita income of the northern region is closing the gap with the national average 
driven by rapid economic expansion of the economic base, especially in agriculture. 28 The 
focus of the Bank support in the northern region has been regional development and poverty 
reduction as well as the aggressive implementation of the environment agenda, whose positive 
results are reported below. 29 Through the development of new multi-sector investment loans at 
the State level, the Bank is supporting improvements in access to basic services in remote areas, 
helping increase agricultural returns, improving the management of protected areas and the 
environmental and social impacts of infrastructure investments, and helping develop payments 
for environmental services and incentives for sustainable forestry.30 The Bank has also 
collaborated with the IFC on the IFC Brazilian Amazon Initiative, specifically on Forestry 
projects and in the Pará Rural and PROACRE projects. 

Competitive Brazil 

The WBG support for competitiveness grew in strength, became more strategic and shifted 
towards a greater engagement with the regions and municipalities through components of multi-
sector operations covering a wide range of competitiveness issues. IFC strategy has been to play 
a critical role in improving the country‘s competitiveness by strengthening SMEs, improving 
their access to finance, integrating them into corporate supply chains, upgrading infrastructure, 
and improving Brazil‘s investment climate.  

The IBRD and IFC coordinated their work on the business climate at the regional level 
with positive results.  The IFC technical assistance facility is working with several cities to 
reduce the time needed to open new businesses with positive results as shown by the 
corresponding Doing Business indicator (measured in the city of São Paulo), which has been 

133 

 
reduced from 152 to 120 days. Business climate results are also part of a growing regional 
development agenda 
that has built on a path-breaking operation--- ―Partnership for 
Development‖ DPL with the State of Minas Gerais-- rated as highly satisfactory on outcomes 
that included improvements in the investment climate. The follow-up SWAP with Minas Gerais 
continues the PSD agenda with a focus on PPPs (jointly with IFC), further advancing regulatory 
streamlining, scaled-up support for MSM enterprises and a focus on innovation. A like-wise 
path-breaking operation in content and design has been the Ceará Inclusive Growth Project 
SWAP I, rated as satisfactory. A follow-up SWAP in Ceará is developing the original agenda 
and a Regional Development project is piloting innovative approaches in PSD development in 
targeted regions within Ceará State.  Other operations, such as the Rio de Janeiro State, are also 
working PSD 
issues. The regional/Municipal focus 
is beginning 
to deliver concrete 
improvements in the business environments. Thus, for instance, the number of days needed to 
open a business has been halved from 63 in 2008 to 31 in 2011 under the Rio de Janeiro Fiscal 
Sustainability, Human Development and Competitiveness DPL. The PSD AAA is shifting 
towards developing a better understanding of the innovation opportunities in the country. In 
Minas and Ceará the Bank has supported respectively the modernization of State science and 
technology policies, and efforts to expand ―digital inclusion‖ through the deployment of 
broadband internet networks. 31 At the Federal level, a study on Knowledge, Innovation and 
Competitiveness was disseminated in partnership with the national federation of industry 
associations (CNI). 

The CPS program continued its support for significant improvements in logistics and 
transportation services. The Logistics Performance Survey (LPS) reports that Brazil‘s ranking 
has improved by going from 61 in 2007 to 41 in 2010--a ranking higher than that of the average 
for Upper Middle Countries and of the Latin America region. The ICR for the DPL 
(Programmatic Sustainable and Equitable Growth Loan) series notes substantial contributions to 
improving custom effectiveness, reducing port costs and delays as well as transport costs on 
Federal roads networks, with a more modest contribution was made to fostering multimodal 
transport.32 In addition, IFC provided a US$679 million financing package to enable port 
operator Brasil Terminal Portuário to develop a new container terminal in the port of Santos, 
expanding capacity at Brazil‘s busiest port. Additional support on logistics came through the 
transportation agenda and, more recently, the work on urban development .33 The contribution of 
the WBG‘s work on transport at the Federal level has been the widespread use of result based 
approaches and private sector participation in infrastructure maintenance and development.34 At 
the sub-national level, Bank has been working with cities (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and 
regions, building on previous work that supported the institutional decentralization of the 
transportation sector. While the impact of these interventions has remained fairly localized, a 
new breed of interventions is being developed – exemplified by the Rio de Janeiro Housing DPL 
– which seek to integrate transport with land use planning and housing and environmental 
policies, with a view to fostering, first, sustainable and equitable urban mobility and green city 
development and, second, improved accessibility to facilities and services, especially for low 
income populations.   

Bank support has contributed to strengthening the financial sector.  Credit to the private 
sector has grown rapidly reflecting a process of financial deepening, with the credit-to-GDP ratio 
rising from 24% of GDP in 2004 to 46% of GDP in 2010. This deepening has taken place in the 
context of a strong regulatory framework to which the Bank has contributed through several 

134 

 
technical assistance operations, such as the Finance Technical Assistance Loan, completed at the 
beginning of this CPS, whose ICR notes Bank contributions to sound regulation and systemic 
risk control, mobilization of long-term resources in the insurance sector and improvement in 
access to financial services by the MSM sector and the poor. 35  A well-regulated and provisioned 
sector fared well during the crisis. Additionally during this CPS, the Bank is implementing 
NLTA activities aimed at supporting efforts by the GoB to promote the development of private 
long-term financing and increase access to finance by SMEs. The Financial Sector Assessment 
Program (FSAP) to be produced in FY12 would also help with stocktaking and charting the route 
ahead, as there is consensus that further development of capital markets and the non-banking 
financial sector is fundamental to mobilizing the resources needed to ratchet-up the pace of 
investment. 36 

The CPS program is contributing to a better access to credit by the poor and lending to 
SMEs. The 2011 Doing Business reports improvements in access to finance as measured by 
increases in the coverage of public and private credit registries (See results Table 1 Appendix.)  
The Bank AAA program (e.g. on the impact evaluation of financial literacy programs) and the 
Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) support for regulatory reforms has fostered 
increased access to credit among low-income households. Salaries and government transfers can 
now be used as collateral for consumer loans and public and private banks have developed 
products targeted at low-income clients.37 IFC has begun funding microfinance lenders in Brazil, 
and the number of microfinance loans made by investees has risen from 870,800 in CY 2007 to 
1.32 million in CY 2010.  The dollar volume of these loans increased from US$395 million to 
$3.46 billion. IFC activity in this area is especially important given that microfinance lending, 
and the availability of other financial products for the poor, remains relatively underdeveloped in 
Brazil.  

The IFC delivered on its commitment to work with second-tier companies. IFC took the 
strategic decision, set out in the 2008 CPS, to increase support for smaller players.  IFC has used 
a blend of equity investments, senior and subordinated debt, and trade finance facilities to 
channel resources through second-tier banks to small and medium businesses. IFC was also able 
to reduce the weight of financial institutions in its commitment volumes, cutting them to 57% of 
own-account and mobilizations, from over 70% in FY 2008. Nonetheless, IFC commitments and 
mobilization to banks remained substantially unchanged between FY 2008-FY 2011 at US$1.2 
billion. A large part of financing for banks consisted of trade finance guarantees, self-liquidating 
and short-term transactions, that are inherently low-risk. This enabled banks to increase lending 
to small and medium enterprises that make up the bulk of Brazil‘s private sector. For example, 
the number of SME loans made by IFC client banks rose from 43,223 in CY 2007 to over 
265,752 in CY 2010. In dollar terms, their lending went from $7.63 billion in CY2007 to $27.8 
billion in CY 2010. In comparison, State-owned Banco do Brasil, lent about US$10 billion to 
SMEs in 2007, and US$32 billion in 2010.   

A broad agenda to improve the fiscal capacity and competitiveness of cities has included 
addressing the challenge of environmentally sustainable waste management. The original 
CPS document pointed as an objective to helping increase the management capacity of states and 
municipalities through selected operations. The Progress report focused on the capacity to 
redress the waste management gap that threatens the quality of life especially in urban 
environments.38 In this regard, the Bank provided background material for the drafting of 

135 

 
National Solid Waste Law (2010) that improved the legal and regulatory framework. The 2009 
environment DPL is supporting BNDES in requiring all waste management projects to comply 
with the Brazilian environmental licensing system that is one of the most developed in the 
world.39 A recently approved project (2010) is intended to support private/public investments in 
solid waste management through Caixa Econômica Federal and links such investments to 
additional resources from carbon financing.  This project is not yet effective and the bulk of its 
contribution will come in the next CPSW. Additional attention is being placed on solid waste 
management though Municipal projects (Brasilia, Ceará, Rio Grande do Sul.) The Bank has also 
supported the integration of social inclusion programs into Municipal waste management 
strategies through a JSDF grant for social inclusion of waste pickers. Finally, through the 
wholesale Carbon Finance project the Bank has supported the private and public sector 
participation in the carbon market, primarily focusing on the destruction of landfill gas.  

The World Bank Group has been supporting the involvement of the private sector through 
PPP in the building in infrastructure. IFC has increased its financial commitments and 
advisory engagements in infrastructure, becoming IFC‘s second most important area of activity 
in Brazil, after financial services. IFC has concentrated on the transport infrastructure sector, a 
critical bottleneck. Infrastructure commitments (including mobilization) jumped 177% to $718 
million during the CPS period, while the value of advisory service‘s PPP business line projects 
doubled to $6.8 million. These included the first PPP concession for a Federal highway and work 
on the complex Pontal irrigation system in Northeastern Brazil. IFC financed two private port 
terminals in Salvador and Santos. Another area of growing PPP activity is the construction of 
irrigation infrastructure. 40 

Macro Fundamentals 

The Bank has been an active supporter of the implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility 
Framework, a fundamental priority of the authorities. The Fiscal and Financial Management 
Technical Assistance Loan41, completed early in this CPS, contributed to improving primary 
balances at the sub-national levels of government as well as achievements on debt management 
and debt profile, with Brazil gaining investment grade status in 2008. Despite these gains, some 
states continued to lag with weak fiscal positions and poor service delivery indicators. During 
this CPS, the Bank moved to work with the laggard states, playing the role of a third-party 
broker in an attempt to help diffuse principal-agent difficulties between the Federal government 
and the states. The CPS, moreover, has helped advance administrative and parametric reforms of 
pensions systems at the State level. Quite importantly, the CPS confirmed an emerging shift from 
the narrow focus on Public Financial Management to the broader view of Public Sector 
Management. Analytical work on the fiscal challenges42 remains relevant and can serve to 
ground policy dialogue in the next strategy.  

The CPS program is contributing to the improvement of the fiscal stance at the sub-
national level of government. Bank‘s work with states facing fiscal difficulties tailored the 
operations to fit the local challenges. In Rio Grande do Sul the focus has been on helping the 
State reduce its high level of debt.43  The operation with Alagoas is seeking to redress the 
traditional poor fiscal management and weak policy and implementation capacity that had been 
at the core of the low relative performance in social and competitiveness indicators. Both of 
these operations are contributing to a turnaround in the states‘ fiscal situation, thus allowing 
them to comply with fiscal targets set by the Federal government.44 A similar turnaround was 

136 

 
achieved by the State of Minas Gerais, which at the time of the first operation with the Bank –a 
DPL in support of the State government‘s ―management shock‖ – was entering into compliance 
agreements with the fiscal targets agreed with the Federal government. Measuring progress as set 
by the Progress Report, it is found that the average ratio of non-financial investments to net 
current revenues in the states where the Bank has been involved increased from 7.16% in 
12/31/07 to 16.1 % in 12/31/10 and that the average ratio of consolidated debt to net current 
revenues (executive branch) dropped from 145.33% in 12/31/07 to 126.67% in 12/31/10. These 
improvements compared favorably with improvements in other states. Quite the contrary was the 
case before 2007 when the decline in the average of consolidated debt to net current revenue on 
all other states was larger than in the states the Bank is supporting fiscal programs (roughly 50% 
against 10% between 2000 and 2007.)  

Progress in advancing pension administrative reform is making headway, especially at the 
State level.  The pension reforms of 1999 and 2003 more than halved projected increases in 
pension costs, still the latter are expected to more than double to 22.4% of GDP by 2050. As a 
result, even under more optimistic scenarios, increases in pension expenditures are likely to 
dominate the fiscal outlook for Brazil. With comprehensive reform at the Federal level remaining 
a challenge, recent efforts have gone into institutional improvements and transparency at all 
levels of government. The Municipal Pension TAL, completed in late 2009, contributed to 
strengthening the Ministry of Social Security and Social Assistance (MPS) and the Secretariat 
for Social Security (SPS) and generally, Municipal pension management was strengthened. 45 
Now, Bank pension support is focusing on helping the Government upgrade the State pension 
management (RPPS system for civil servants) seeking to reduce unwarranted pension claims, 
improving financial sustainability, etc. In this context, the cadastre upgrade program, now under-
implementation, seeks to eliminate unwarranted beneficiary payments in all State government 
branches. Over 340,000 public servants are being checked (recadastrados), which exceeds the 
target set by the Progress Report. However, only 17 rather than 24 states are being covered as 
increasing costs (from revaluation and inflation) has meant that some states which requested the 
service could not be covered for financial reasons.  In addition, the Bank is supporting audits to 
eliminate unwarranted beneficiary payments in AL and Rio de Janeiro, as well as administrative, 
actuarial and structural reforms on these State`s pension system. This corresponds to 19 states 
advancing on those issues with Bank support.  

The Bank has been supporting the states in moving towards a broader Public Sector 
Management focus based on results. During the previous CPS, operations in Minas Gerais and 
Ceará introduced a PSM approach where public decisions incorporated assessments of impact 
and results thus creating a reinforcing feed-back loop. The positive evaluation of the PSM 
agenda as per the ICR of the first Minas DPL and the ICR for the first Ceará Inclusive and 
Growth SWAP---achievement of development outcomes rated as highly satisfactory for the first 
operation and satisfactory for the second---led to a nationwide expansion of the approach.  First, 
the CPS maintained the agenda in these two states with the 2nd Minas Gerais Development 
Partnership SWAp (2008) and the Ceará Inclusive Growth (SWAp II) (2009) to perfect the 
approach.  Other states and municipalities are following suit. In Rio de Janeiro, the Fiscal 
Consolidation for Efficiency and Growth Development Policy Loan Program supports public 
sector management improvements to deliver innovative programs in health, education, and 
private sector development in poor areas. The Rio State DPL (2010) supported measures aimed 
at improving the management of oil revenues and at enhancing the quality of the health and 

137 

 
education provided by the State government. Both the DPL to the city and that to the State of Rio 
de Janeiro are being complemented by follow-up technical assistance (TA) projects that share the 
same goals but operate through capacity building activities to improve policy implementation.46 
Thus, performance interventions such as results-based management, performance agreements 
and monitoring and evaluation systems, gained importance in Brazil. Currently, 8 states (MG, 
CE, RS, DF, PE, AC, AL, BA) and the municipalities of Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, São Paulo, 
Recife, Rio de Janeiro, amongst others are implementing the approach.  The Bank is responding 
to these demands either through new operations currently under preparation or targeted visits. 
The achievements in Minas Gerais have informed the South-South dialogue, with the interest in 
the approach extending to the Bank itself, which has used some of the elements of the Minas 
PSM model and the related SWAP operation as a key precedent for the design of the new P4R 
instrument.  

Program Delivery is rated satisfactory.   

The contribution of the CPS to results in the area of equitable Brazil remained strong as it has 
been under the previous CPS. Highlights include the work done for the BOLSA program that 
included assistance in design and evaluation. BOLSA has had an impact not only on poverty 
reduction but on health, education and access to finance. The analytical work in education has 
contributed to the design of programs that increase quality and improve access. The contribution 
in health includes not only expanding coverage of the public insurance system but working on 
efficiency with the Federal and regional government. The WBG has also made contributions to 
the environment. Analytical work has informed the government‘s strategic choices and 
commitments as, projects, have helped deliver strong results in reducing deforestation, 
introducing sustainable economic practices, and mainstreaming environmental concerns. The 
program has also played a role in improving the fiscal stance of states that were lagging in 
performance. The emphasis on Public Sector Management, with emphasis on improving the link 
between decision and results, is expanding in Brazil and finding an echo abroad.  The 
competitiveness agenda has shifted to regions, launching a positive trend that is gaining force 
throughout the country. The IFC and the Bank have supported increased access to finance and 
housing by the poor. The IFC substantially increased its financing for second tier banks and 
companies, and in frontier regions of the country.  

IV. Bank Performance 

Design and Relevance 

The CPS design benefited from taking a hard look at the status of the program in Brazil, which 
was dispersed and in some cases lacked strategic focus. The design committed (a) shorter 
preparation times; (b) larger share of lending going to sub-national levels around clearly defined 
and owned programmatic agendas, and (c) moving from plain vanilla to ―knowledge intensive‖ 
cutting edge products.  In launching this shift, the CPS built on emerging trends during the 
previous CPS (i.e. results-based SWAP, State lending.) The IFC in turn committed to a more 
strategic engagement with a tighter alignment with the IBRD and aiming for a program, with 
global spillovers.  Under a flexible approach, the CPS committed to the operations in the pipeline 
for the following two years and set rules of engagement, labeled ―principled opportunism‖, that 
signaled the broad areas of potential engagement based on the Bank‘s competitive advantage and 

138 

 
demand from the clients but left open the specific areas of work to be determined on subsequent 
dialogue and results.   

The shift in strategy was aligned and driven by country level priorities as well. First, the program 
maintained the broad objectives set by the government‘s strategy, which exhibited significant 
continuity with that of the first Lula Administration. Second, the CPS was aligned with the 
Federal and sub-national governments‘ efforts at addressing challenges in the implementation of 
the fiscal responsibility act. Third, the CPS sought to contribute towards the implementation of 
national policies by working with the sub-national levels of government, which have the 
constitutional responsibility for implementation.  This degree of strategic alignment was tighter 
than the customary focus on broad development objectives because the strong emphasis on 
implementation. The CPS sharply simplified the results framework in response to the experience 
under the previous CPS. The progress report further sharpened it, by increasing the 
quantification of targets. This said, however, the highly selective nature of the results framework 
did not properly account for the breath of the program and often relied on higher development 
outcomes where the contribution of the program is more difficult to ascertain.    

Program Implementation  

The partners delivered the strategic turnaround that the CPS had promised.  The CPS did 
shift lending to the sub-national levels of government, moved the program towards more 
knowledge intensive operations and improved project delivery. IFC‘s role in Brazil was also 
transformed both in the volume of its investments and in the nature of its involvement in the 
country, as Brazil became a critical partner, by virtue of its size, the sophistication of its private 
sector, and the unique challenges faced by a fast-growing upper middle income country.  

Project Preparation lags have been reduced.  The average time elapsing between the Concept 
Note and the signing of an operation was reduced from 30 (previous to the CPS) to 11 months 
now. Changes also took place in the size of the projects. The size of the smallest project 
increased, as compared to the previous CAS, from 4 to 20.8 million, while the average and 
median size of projects went from (131, 45) million to (266.9, 54.4) million respectively. 
Shortening the time lag by half between Concept Note discussion and project effectiveness has 
enabled the Bank team to respond promptly to client‘s requests.  

Implementation 
indicators have remained stable. The number of projects under 
implementation increased from 53 in 2008 to 57 in 2011. The average age of the project dropped 
though from 4 years to 2.8 and even so the disbursement rate remains above 30%. The number of 
problem projects decreased marginally from 17% to 15.8%. However, project extension practices 
remain an issue. Of the projects completed during the CPS period the majority were extended to 
support program implementation. Over the last five years IEG has evaluated 28 projects of which 
4 have been found unsatisfactory in reaching development outcomes. Efforts to further increase 
implementation have focused on the gradual adoption of country systems in selected States.  

Commitments and disbursements increased while shifting towards the lower levels of 
government.  During this CPS period, Bank commitments reached over 11 billion US dollars, 
which is well above the amount under the previous CPS. The increase in commitments was 
driven by (a) the growing demand for technical know-how and financial resources by the sub-
national governments at the State level and (b) additional resources that were borrowed during 

139 

 
the crisis.  Commitments to sub-national levels of government increased in line with expectations 
from 35% in the previous strategy to 78% on average in this strategy and (87%) in 2011. Despite 
this, the dialogue with the Federal Government remained strong. The main recipients of 
operations and resources at the sub-national level have been the states in the South-East, a result 
in part of the demand driven approach. These states, because of their higher income and size as 
well as their interest and commitment to institutional transformation strategies have increasingly 
turned to the Bank for finance and knowledge using their available borrowing capacity. In the 
second half of the CPS period, however, the Bank has increasingly shifted its operations to the 
North and Northeast regions. Lastly, Fee for Services has been increasing its importance as a 
modality of engagement. They include support to the Federal government on the development of 
PPPs for irrigation (Ministry of National Integration) and support for capacity building in the 
Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, also on PPPs. 

The composition of the new operations shifted to multi-sector operations using both 
investment and policy based loans. Innovations in instruments continued under this CPS 
building on the lessons learned from the use of result-oriented investment loans using the sector-
wide approach (SWAPs). The results-based SWAp is suitable to induce institutional change that 
impacts the effectiveness of public expenditure and the overall quality of public sector 
management. The focus on public sector management has provided a central vertebra around 
which to organize tailored multi-pillar operations that address specific local challenges, while 
addressing sustainability issues that had emerged during the review of previous regionally-
focused operations. In addition, these approaches are being used to exploit complementarities, 
such as in the recently approved Water-Health Bahia SWAP. While during the previous CPS 
only two such SWAP operations had been approved, eleven have been put into place during this 
CPS.  

Innovation has also taken place in the context of working together with a large Federal 
State. Delivery at the sub-national level developed a way to address the challenges that emerge 
when implementing strategies in a large Federal State and that include: (a) coordination between 
the Federal and the State level, (b) the selection of states where to operate, and (c) the scaling up 
of impact nationwide.47 In Brazil, the articulation is taking place in the context of (a) the 
implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Law and (b) the implementation of sector policies, in 
some cases introducing results-based elements into the mechanisms used by the Federal 
Government to transfer resources to the local levels. Whenever possible, the Bank sought to 
capitalize and promote vertical alignment of policies and operations across the various spheres of 
government.  A good example of this is the work with the State and the Municipality of Rio de 
Janeiro on a number of mutually complementary programs aimed at sub-national fiscal 
consolidation and the improvement of social service delivery, especially for low income 
households, and in consonance with Federal policies. During this CPS, the strategy relied on 
principles of ―demand-driven‖ and ―principled opportunism‖ thus emphasizing self-selection. 
Broader impact relies on example and emulation, which is happening as new states seek Bank 
engagement for institutional transformation, thus contributing to the dissemination of good 
practices. 48 The latter has also been spurred through regular national forums where State 
authorities share experiences. In addition, there is learning upwards as has been the case in the 
area of Public Sector Management, where the practices developed at the State level are filtering 
up to the national government. 

140 

 
The CPS was not only aligned with the broad strategy of government which maintained 
continuity with the first period of the Lula administration, but also with emerging 
priorities of the Federal and the sub-national levels of government.  First, the Bank has been 
playing the role of a (arbiter) third-party to diffuse the principal-agent problems that had plagued 
previous efforts at improving the fiscal sustainability of some states.  Second, the Bank has been 
assisting in the implementation of national policies through a design/learning approach where 
lessons are shared across as well as feed into the fine-tuning of the Federal design. The flexible 
stance adopted by the CPS is particularly suited to a learning approach. The emphasis on 
management by results has the potential to help improve the overall effectiveness of public 
expenditure and reduce the fiscal pressure of delivering the social agenda thus opening fiscal 
space for infrastructure.  

IFC has changed its role in Brazil as the strength and sophistication of its private sector, 
and the unique challenges faced by a fast-growing upper middle income country.  Volumes 
of financial commitment rose from US$1.09 billion in FY 2008 to $1.11 billion in FY 2011, with 
annual commitments to clients in Brazil now larger than in any other country. IFC‘s activities 
became more focused, by concentrating on a few strategic aims to further reinforce the World 
Bank Group‘s engagement with the country.49 IFC has also narrowed the focus of its advisory 
services work in Brazil. While the number of ongoing engagements has remained roughly 
steady, at about 7-10 per year, the total value of projects has risen by 76% to $11.06 million per 
year. Furthermore, the advisory portfolio of PPP, Sustainable Business, and Investment Climate 
projects has shifted to greater emphasis on PPP work. The value of PPP projects has doubled to 
[$6.8] million in FY 2011 or almost two-thirds of IFC‘s advisory spend in Brazil, and accounted 
for three out of seven ongoing projects in FY 2011.  

The Bank supported Brazil during the crisis in various ways. The preventive support to help 
shield the country during the 2008-2009 global crisis did not focus on macroeconomic 
management, as the country maneuvered the impact of the crisis successfully, while maintaining 
its investment credit rating. Instead, the CPS partners used the opportunity to highlight the 
renewed commitment and acknowledge the institutional advances in addressing the primacy of 
the environmental challenge, showing mastery of the situation by advancing a priority concern 
even during a crisis. As has been noted, fiscal support was provided to selected states that were 
affected by the crisis. Regarding the potential social impact of the crisis, the government 
maintained in place its social programs—Bolsa Família, as well as carried an anti-cyclical fiscal 
policy that favored income generation. 

The IFC likewise adapted its program to respond to the impact of the global crisis. The IFC 
adapted, first by playing a counter-cyclical role through an increase in its volume of trade finance 
lines to support small but fundamentally strong financial institutions and their SME client bases. 
Then, as the economy recovered, the Corporation boosted its lending and equity operations, and 
sharply increased mobilization from participating investors. As a result, IFC has been able to 
achieve substantial development impacts while carefully husbanding its resources. Of the nearly 
US$2 billion committed to Brazil in FY 2011, about half consisted of financing for IFC‘s 
account. This compares with a 66% own-account share (of a lower commitment volume) in FY 
2008.   

South-South Cooperation: The innovational environment that has emerged in Brazil has set the 
basis for Brazil to emerge as a leader of South-South, and some cases, South-North Cooperation. 

141 

 
The Bank has assisted this process in various ways: as a facilitator and convener for Brazil‘s 
efforts in areas such as tropical agriculture, judicial reform, health and rural development; but 
also as a conduit for knowledge generated in Brazil through operations that can be adapted and 
implemented with Bank support – this included disseminating Brazil‘s experience in CCTs 
(Bolsa Família), the Aids program and fiscal management in a Federal context, among others.  
The first role, of facilitator was done mainly in Brazil‘s work with Africa, in line with Brazil‘s 
strategic priorities, while the second has a global dimension. 

A flexible approach represents a challenge for the design of an adequate Results 
Framework.  The CPS simplified the results framework, following on the recommendations of 
the Completion report, while leaving open the areas the potential engagement in an operational 
appendix to the CPS document. This open stance was compatible with a flexible approach, as 
was the goal of the CPS, but arguably lacked concreteness. The CPS Progress Report brought 
more concreteness into the results framework but retained the simplified version, which arguably 
focused primarily on the Federal Program. Hence, result framework did not fully capture the 
breath of the program, especially at the sub-national level. That said, the Progress Report did 
present aggregate results at the sub-national level on fiscal and pension issues.  

Rating Bank Performance: Satisfactory.  Delivery on the main commitments taken was good. 
As, noted the lending shifted to the states and operation design has made considerable progress 
in moving from ―plain vanilla‖ to knowledge intensive products. Work at the regional level is 
becoming increasingly multi-sector with a core focus on better public sector management and 
better fiscal outcomes. The AAA products have informed key government initiatives in 
environment, health, education, social protection, access to finance and competitiveness. The 
CPS emphasized demand and engaged with states that called for support. This meant working at 
first with more developed states, but the lessons from these interventions are flowing to the 
poorer states.  The IFC focused its program around three strategic objectives: reducing poverty 
and inequality, improving competitiveness, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This 
approach, combined with positive market conditions, enabled IFC to increase its investments in 
Brazil by 70% over the previous CPS period, making it one of the Corporation‘s largest partner 
countries. The IFC has increasingly complemented financing with mobilization and strategic 
advice. In addition, the Bank has supported the successful efforts of the Brazilian authorities to 
lead South-South collaboration efforts, including by helping organize visits to Brazil by a large 
number of foreign delegations.  

V. Lessons Learned/Recommendations  

The Completion Report highlights the following findings which are relevant for the design 
of the new strategy. 

 Preserve and perfect the approach of working both with the Federal government 
and the states to achieve national outcomes. Demand-driven and ―principled 
opportunism‖ in Brazil have delivered a solid and well-structured portfolio at the sub-
national level, with interventions that are having demonstration effects as (a) other states 
(and countries) seek to engage in similar programs with the Bank or (b) learning is taking 
place through cross-support networks that have emerged.  Moving forward, it seems 

142 

 
 
advisable to strengthen the partnerships through (a) more systematic transmission of 
lessons, experience and learning either horizontally or working through the Federal level 
(for instance, structure of incentives in fiscal relations, incentives to coordinate 
implementation of sector policy—see water, health, education, etc.), and (b) refocusing 
attention to supporting the fine tuning of national policy platforms building on the lessons 
learned at the State level.  
 Maintain as preferred option of engagement innovation through product design and 
complementary AAA focused on “how” rather than “what”. A lesson that emerges is 
that the approach in Brazil worked well because the interventions and the operations 
focused on knowledge creation, not just knowledge transfer. With hindsight, it seems 
clear that partnering with a sophisticated upper middle-income country provides a fertile 
ground for innovation—knowledge creation. Hence, the relevance of innovative AAA as 
it has taken place in education and environment and the increasing attention given to 
evaluation as in the Bolsa Program. The task for the Bank is put into place the 
rules/environment that foster innovation, while lifting constrains that suffocates it.  
 Maintain continuity and persistence across strategies to assure attainment of long-
term goals. The implementation of this CPS shows (as several ICR documents point out) 
that delivering results is a sequential and cumulative process that has to be framed within 
a long-term learning perspective. Delivering results during this CPS built on previous 
efforts at implementing policy initiatives of the late 1990s or early 2000. The process 
combined analytical work to aid design, and increasingly monitoring and evaluation to 
inform fine-tuning of policy frameworks. Quite importantly in Brazil, a Federal country 
where large share of responsibilities have been devolved, these processes include learning 
and experimentation at all levels of government. In this context, the role of the Bank as 
an accompanying partner that provides knowledge and helps design the learning process 
can be quite productive.  
 Support further Brazil’s role as leader in the South-South dialogue. Brazil focus on 
innovation has led to the development of approaches across a broad range of areas that 
that is relevant in the rest of the world. The WBG should strengthen its support to 
Brazil‘s efforts to share that knowledge with the rest of the world.  
 Going forward focus the partnership in areas where major gaps remains to further 
strengthen the relevance of WGB engagement.  The work that has began at the State 
level on improving the effectiveness of the public sector must be rolled out and 
strengthened to contribute results at the national level. Filling in infrastructure gaps 
requires building fiscal space and also advancing PPP practices. Conditions must be put 
in place for the private sector to generate and adapt innovative practices that increase 
productivity as the basis of sustained increases in income. Further cross-cutting 
interventions to support Gender development would also be desirable. 
 Develop a result framework that captures the best the contribution of the program. 
This CPS, especially the progress Report made an effort to capture quantitative indicators 
and to be selective. The result, in some cases, was results that were too high in the results 
chain where the impact of the program depends on many other factors. The next CPS 
should make an effort to develop indicators that capture more directly the impact of the 
program.

1 See Gomes, Pessoa and Velloso (2003). 
2 HD Technical Assistance Project completed 12/31/2009 and rated as moderately satisfactory for development outcomes.   
3 Currently Bank is collaborating with 2 municipalities to rigorously evaluate promising programs: the Rio de Janeiro municipal ity‘s 
Primeira Infância Completa program, targeted to families eligible for the Bolsa Família and Bolsa carioca, and Recife municipality‘s 
new ECD program.   
4 IFC made two investments in the education sector during the CPS period, committing a US$28.7 million A Loan to Anhanguera 
Educacional and taking US$6.7 million in equity in Ideal Invest, a student loan company. This enabled IFC to support the expansion 
of adult education opportunities, mainly technical and vocational classes, for middle- and low-income students.  
5 Bank‘s AAA has contributed to (a) a transparent national dialogue on education results and performance and (b) to the design of 
instruments to create incentives to strengthen education institutions for better results at all levels. In addition, through sub-national 
operations the Bank has provided direct support to states and select municipalities for education reforms to improve teacher quality, 
reduce repetition, and raise secondary education quality. Moreover, in FY10, an analytical program was started in partnership with the 
Federal and selected State and Municipal Governments to help design and evaluate policies and programs related to different 
dimensions of the quality of education production process and early child development.   
6 The initial operation was the First Family Health Extension Program - PROESF I (approved on March 14, 2002); the follow up 
operation is the Second Family Health Extension Program - PROESF II (which was approved on April 25, 2008). 
7 VIGISUS ICR (completed 12/31/2009) and rated as satisfactory for development outcomes, with low to negligible risks.  
8 See ICR for HIV/AIDS (2010). 
9 ICR Bahia Health System Reform Project APL, completed 8/31/2009.  
10 At the Federal level, the Bank has worked with the Ministries of Environment, Cities and National Integration, and the national 
water regulatory agency, ANA. It has also worked with several States, especially in the Northeast, such as Pernambuco, Sergipe and 
Rio Grande do Norte, as well as Espírito Santo and São Paulo among others. 
11 At the Federal level, the recently closed PROÁGUA (Federal Resource Water Management Project) promoted participatory 
management, and provision of reliable and sustainable access to water in priority basins of the Northeast. The Water Sector 
Modernization Project (PMSS), the second of an APL series, focused on improving the regulatory environment for water and 
sanitation services and posted as major accomplishments the support for (a) the Consortia Law, which sets rules for horizontal 
cooperation in undertaking and managing water and sanitation projects across sub-nation entities and (b) the National Law on 
Guidelines for Basic Sanitation.  The Bank is also supporting complementary efforts to deploy integrated urban water management 
approaches (IUWM), based on coordination of urban water management with urban planning and basin management. IUWM is a 
flexible, participatory and iterative process which integrates different levels of government, and the elements of the urban water cycle 
(water supply, sanitation, storm water management, waste management) with both the city‘s urban development and the surrounding 
basin‘s management to maximize economic, social and environmental benefits in an equitable manner.  Under the Sergipe Water 
Project, the Bank is developing a pilot IUWM case in the Metropolitan Region of Aracaju, which is also the subject of analytical work 
at the regional level. 
12 PROSANEAR was completed during the previous CPS (completion date 12/15/2007), but the impact extended into this CPS period. 
The achievement of development outcomes was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.  
13 These operations include: Rio Grande do Norte (RGN)  Rural Poverty Reduction (2002); Maranhão Integrated Rural Development 
(2004); APL1-Para Integrated Rural development (2006); Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction Project (2001); Ceará Inclusive Growth 
(SWAp I) (2006); Ceará Inclusive Growth (SWAp II) (2009); Ceará Regional Development (2009); Ceará Integrated Water Resource 
Management (2000); Sergipe State Integrated Project: Rural Poverty (2009); Bahia State integrated poverty reduction (2006); P iauí 
Rural Poverty Reduction (2001); Pernambuco Rural Poverty Development (2001); Bahia Poor areas Integrated Development (2006); 
and Recife Urban Upgrading (2003). Projects focused on rural poverty in other regions include:  MG Rural Poverty Reduction (2006); 
Santa Catarina Natural and Poverty Reduction (2002) 
14 Examples of these operations are: RJ Sustainable Rural Development (2010); SP Sust Rural Dev & Access to Markets (2010); 
15 Land-based Poverty Alleviation Project, closing 12/31/2008 2008, and rated moderately satisfactory, mainly due to delays in 
implementation.  
16 An example of this is IFC‘s US$25 million A Loan to food processing company Bauducco SA, to support a new plant in the 
Northeast. In addition to creating 260 jobs in the State of Alagoas, the project integrated about 1,800 SMEs into its supply chain, and 
incorporated energy efficient processes and equipment. 
17 Paes de Barros, R., and M. Carvalho (2009). 
18 ICR BOLSA (2010) rated achievement of development outcomes as satisfactory, with low or negligible risk. 
19 By 2010 53% of the units receiving financing were for families with incomes below 10 minimum wages, as a result of measures 
introduced during the crisis. The MCMV program is mainly implemented by the Government-owned Caixa Econômica Federal, which 
encompasses about 100% of subsidy linked loans (through FGTS funds) and the largest market share of all mortgage operations in 
Brazil.

20 The supporting role of the Bank in housing came through Housing sector Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) to the Ministry of 
Cities, which closed in December 2010, as well as its Non Lending TA (NLTA) to the Secretariat of Economic Policy under the 
Ministry of Finance. The focus of the assistance has been the sustainability of the MCMV initiative through private sector 
involvement in low-income housing market with attention to the identification of opportunities to expand access to capital markets and 
land. The current NLTA scope is to enable the Government to identify opportunities to expand access to capital markets as a funding 
source for housing loans. This work on expanding access to housing finance is closely linked with TA on supply side issues (including 
the functioning of housing and land markets), subsidies, and sector monitoring and evaluation. The Bank is also providing support to 
the State Government of Rio under the Metropolitan Urban and Housing DPL to strengthen the policy and regulatory framework for 
the State‘s low-income housing fund FEHIS. An important regulatory instrument is the ―ZEIS‖, a Special Zoning procedure for social 
housing, which has been introduced in 60% of the new plans, and which represents an important tool to enable access to affordable 
land for the poor in the cities. Under the Rio Metropolitan Urban and Housing DPL and associated TAL, the Bank has also provided 
support to integrated housing, land use, transport and disaster risk management policies as well as TA to integrate and harmonize 
sectoral master plans for land use, housing and transport at the metropolitan region level. 
21 The Sustainable Environmental Management (SEM) DPL has played a major role in the consolidation of the sustainable 
development agenda. This operation that was approved and disbursed as part of the support the Bank provided to Brazil during the 
global crisis in 2009 consolidating on-going project work and building on previous experience such as Environment PRL series, 
during the previous CPS. Through this operation, the Bank is supporting the GoB‘s efforts to increase the transparency of the 
environmental licensing process, enhance the implementation of mandated Brazilian environmental and social management 
procedures, and increase the effectiveness of environmental and social management systems in BNDES and other financial 
institutions. The Bank is also using investment projects to support institutional capacity building for decentralized environmental 
management as well as for addressing safeguards issues more generally. In addition, the Bank has mobilized bilateral and mult ilateral 
grant funds (e.g. from the GEF) in support of conservation and natural resource management initiatives. Trust fund and IFC resources 
have leveraged the impact of Bank investment loans at the State and Federal level, and that of the SEM DPL with BNDES.   
22 The study establishes a reference scenario by anticipating the future evolution of Brazil‘s GHG emissions, it identifies and 
quantifies actions that could be taken to mitigate emissions and increase carbon uptake, it assesses the costs of implementing low 
carbon actions, identifies potential implementation barriers, and explores measures to overcome them. Based on all these inputs, the 
study builds a low carbon scenario that meets development expectations and it analyzes the macroeconomic effects and additional 
financing needs of shifting from the reference scenario to a lower carbon pathway. The study yielded a number of actionable policy 
recommendations. In addition, over the last five years the Bank in collaboration with the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) has 
supported Brazil‘s programs aimed at better understanding the causes and impacts of land degradation and developing alternatives that 
can be scaled up. The INPE digital map of the Amazon (whose production has been supported by a PPG7 grant), for example, 
indicates the location of the degraded areas in the Amazon and indicates its level of degradation.  The AES –Tiete CDM, the 
Microbacias, and the Mata Ciliar projects provide a blueprint for restoration of Areas of Permanent Preservation (APPs), while the 
Plantar CDM project is a promising initiative for sustainable forestry in degraded areas. 
23 This Fund is financed partially from royalties from oil.  
24 An example is the recently completed Santa Catarina Natural and Poverty Reduction.  
25 The first major project, in 2007, was a US$90 million loan package that helped beef producer Bertin expand and modernize its 
existing facilities, including one acquired in 2005 in the Amazon region. However, the project was terminated in May 2009 by mutual 
agreement in recognition of the project‘s management and operational complexities. Nonetheless, IFC and Bertin were able to 
advance the sustainability agenda in the beef sector in Brazil through a number of initiatives. They worked to develop and implement 
a Cattle Purchasing Procedure, the first of its kind, to address key social and environmental concerns associated with the industry. At 
its peak in 2008, the Bertin project reached over 15,000 farmers that provided livestock for Bertin slaughterhouses in and around the 
Amazon region. IFC also provided advisory support to pilot a project with Bertin‘s cattle suppliers on better production practices to 
promote more efficient use of pasture land and reduce the pressure on critical forest resources. IFC played a leadership role in setting 
up the Sustainable Beef Working Group – the industry‘s only multi stakeholder forum to develop and promote sustainable practices. 
The Group consists of Brazil‘s major beef processors, large purchasers of beef, financiers, and NGOs. Other projects initiated under 
the Amazon Initiative include a key role in the Round Table on Responsible Soy that brings together market participants and 
stakeholders. IFC also supports Aliança da Terra, an NGO, to expand sustainable land management by improving indicators, 
monitoring systems, and developing a transparent database for supply chain use and a carbon monitoring system. The project began in 
2009 and its main objective is to increase the area of land in the Amazon enrolled under sustainable management by 2 million 
hectares. 
26 Other relevant projects of this agenda include (a) the recently completed Paraná bio-diversity completed January 2009 with 
substantial contribution to protected areas  and bio-diversity; (b) the likewise recently completed Amazon Region Protected Areas; (c) 
Goiás—Regional Development; (d) the Environmental Sustainability Agenda Technical Assistance Project; etc. Efforts to mainstream 
environment concerns in other sectors include a GEF financed project on transport and air quality focused on reducing the rap id 
increase in carbon emissions from urban transport in Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and São Paulo, through less energy intensive transport 
modes and the implementation of policies and regulatory frameworks that foster the development of sustainable transport systems

27 While relatively small, these projects represented major advances in their respective fields that have enable further progress by 
investees. For instance, a US$24.4 million A Loan to Estre Ambiental, a waste treatment and energy company, in 2009 enabled the 
client to develop new sanitary landfills and deployment of LFG collection and combustion systems. At the time, a mid -sized company 
such as Estre operating in an unconventional field faced greater difficulty than usual in accessing long-term finance. As well as 
improving its capital structure, IFC also strengthened Estre‘s corporate governance to improve its creditworthiness when mark ets 
stabilized, and demonstrated to the markets the viability and attractiveness of private sector engagement.  
28 The CPS proposed a more strategic involvement in the Amazon region, which has the largest share of rainforest in the planet, is the 
repository of probably the world‘s largest biodiversity content, and contains carbon stocks of around 70 billion tons.  The Cerrado, 
covering 25% of the area of Brazil, is a unique type of tropical savanna which harbors over 12.000 species of plants and a couple of 
thousands of species of animals; its biome is under heavy stress from expanding commercial agriculture. The Sustainable Cerr ado 
Initiative is bringing an innovative approach to the conservation and sustainable use of its biome, enabling local communities, civil 
society and the private sector to participate actively in policy formulation and implementation. Four GEF projects are committed to 
help increasing the mosaic of legally protected areas of unique biodiversity, bringing in medium, large and small farmers, and local 
communities around a more sustainable use of the biome's natural resources; and, monitoring the biome‘s status by creating a public 
database containing current geophysical, social and environmental information. As part of these efforts, the Rural Environment 
Cadastre technical Assistance Project is piloting self-registration of public and private lands in a cadastre; these experiences will then 
feed into a broader effort to register all lands in environment sensitive areas, helping track the conservation efforts.

31 A large urban portfolio and regional portfolio is emerging with various degrees of PSD emphasis. From an earlier vintage, one 
series includes five operations in Rio Grande do Sul Municipal Development Project and eight under the Brazil Municipal Lending 
Project (BMPL) APL. A newer vintage of PSD is being including as a critical pillar of all SWAP and DPL operations.  
32 See ICR to Second Programmatic Sustainable and Equitable Growth Loan completed 6/30/2008 and rated moderately satisfactory. 
The CPS outcome focused on reducing the times to import and export as per the Doing Business Database.  This numbers indeed 
improved as seen in Appendix 1, but as the third DPL operation the series intended to support achievement of the objective wa s 
cancelled under this operation, but continued through the Sustainable and Equitable Growth Technical Assistance Project whose ICR 
has been completed in March, 2011.  
33 The TAL that accompanied the DPL series, however, continued supporting the implementation of a number of Bank supported 
policy reforms, including in the transport sector. See the draft ICR for the Brazil Sustainable and Equitable Growth Technica l 
Assistance Project (P083533). 
34 The financial contribution in transportation is small given that Brazil is carrying one of the largest transportation programs in the 
world.

36 In addition, ongoing AAA work to respond to a GoB‘s request for technical support in the development of policy measures to 
support the development of long-term and SME financing, in light of similar international experiences. While Brazil has one of the 
largest and most sophisticated financial systems among emerging market countries, the tenure of funding – other than that supplied by 
the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) – is still fairly short-term (in general at most two years in the case 
of private Banks). A key challenge then is how to increase the supply of longer term products to more adequately match the funding 
needs of investors. A range of reasons have been advanced to explain the lack of development of a vibrant long-term market for 
private sector financing, including high short term real interest rates that do not create much incentives for maturity risk taking, the 
pricing of credit by BNDES substantially below the SELIC policy rate, high issuance costs for corporate debentures, and widespread 
use of the interest rate on overnight uncollateralized interbank market transactions as a benchmark for fund managers even when 
investing in longer-term instruments. 
37 These products include simplified checking and savings accounts (e.g. for recipients of CCTs), they have expanded their branch 
networks and deployed innovative efforts to develop branchless banking, microfinance, and links between access to Bolsa-Família 
and the provision of financial services.   
38 Some 57 million tons of Municipal solid waste were produced in Brazil in 2009, with average per capita generation rates in 
metropolitan areas reached 1.2 kg per day, equivalent to the rates found in OECD countries. Of the total volume produced, about 7 
million tons (12%) were not collected, and 22 million tons (43%) were improperly disposed in dumpsites. Only around 39% of the 
country‘s 5,564 municipalities, the constitutionally responsible agents, adequately dispose of their waste (sanitary landfills) . Wide 
variations in collection and disposal rates are observed amongst the various regions of the country. 
39 In addition, BNDES is extending special financing conditions for water management in the less developed North and Northeast 
regions of the country. 
40 Brazil is presently irrigating 4.0 million ha that produce 31% of the total value of crop production with less than 10% of the cropped 
area in the country. Brazil has the land and water resources to irrigate 30 million ha. To take advantage of this opportunity, however, it 
is paramount to attract the private sector as a partner in this endeavor. In this regard, the PPP Framework that the Bank has helped 
develop has already successfully allowed for the bidding of the Pontal irrigation project in September 2010. More recently, Bank 
support in this area has focused on the optimal utilization of irrigation projects that have been performing below their potential, and in

the development of new projects such as Baxio de Irece. The Bank is supporting the Ministry of Integration to decide on the most 
adequate PPP model, and is finalizing the necessary studies and negotiations with the relevant authorities to bid the projects and 
follow up on their implementation. This work has attracted the attention of other Latin American and African countries which are 
interested in implementing a new strategy based on the PPP model developed in Brazil.  
41 See ICR to Fiscal and Financial Management Technical Assistance Loan, completed 12/31/08 and rated as moderately satisfactory 
for development outcomes. During this CPS the Bank did not extend a new operation to the Federal Government, but it maintained the 
partnership through technical assistance aimed at filling gaps on the implementation of the SIAFI, pluri-annual budgets, and results 
based management. The Inter-American Development Bank is providing complementary support. A Programmatic Fiscal Reform 
Loan (PFRSAL1 and 2), social security reform issues included, was completed in June 2006.

48 An example, during this CPS, has been the piloting of environment initiatives (forest management) that are having a broad impact. 
In addition, working with key leaders with extensive network helps mainstreaming initiatives as has the partnership between the Bank 
and BNDES on the environment. 
49 IFC has taken an increasingly strategic approach to its activities in Brazil, both for its investment and advisory operations. Its 
strategy during the CPS period was driven by Brazil‘s key development challenges and aims, and was closely aligned with IBRD‘s 
three overarching objectives. IFC focused first, on alleviating poverty and income inequality by providing greater access to basic 
services, expanding microfinance, supporting low income markets and focusing on frontier regions of the country (North and 
Northeast). Second, it focused on promoting sustainable development in the Brazilian Amazon and through support for renewable 
energy projects, clean technologies, and energy efficiency. And finally, it focused on improving the competitiveness of Brazil‘s 
private sector by strengthening small and medium enterprises, improving their access to finance, integrating small producers into 
supply chains, and improving the business environment and quality of infrastructure.
