EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. Ukraine is emerging from the 2009 economic and financial crisis with serious structural 
weaknesses left unaddressed.  Fiscal imbalances remain significant and large social transfers, 
inefficient public services and significant quasi-fiscal subsidies threaten sustainability.  The financial 
sector is fragile and the business climate ranks persistently at the bottom in the region.  Despite export 
led recovery over the past two years, output is still below pre-crisis levels and the economy remains 
vulnerable to volatile commodity prices and dependent on foreign financing.  The public sector is large, 
but the quality of many public services has been deteriorating.  Surveys conducted on the eve of 
Ukraine‚Äòs 20th anniversary of independence and recent social protests reveal widespread discontent 
with the economic situation and with poor public governance1. The gap between public expectations 
and economic reality masks some underlying strengths and achievements such as progress in poverty 
reduction over the past decade, relatively good medium-term growth prospects and by regional 
standards low levels of public debt.  

2. 
In the face of well-identified social and economic development challenges, successive 
Ukrainian governments have struggled with reform implementation.  Since independence in 1991, 
progress in economic and social reforms has lagged behind targets and social aspirations. Behind many 
implementation difficulties lie fundamental challenges of economic and political governance .  
Corruption and state capture have been pervasive and are broadly recognized as a major development 
constraint.  Ukraine has always had low rankings on critical aspects of governance and in some areas 
Ukraine‚Äòs scores have deteriorated since 2006.  Despite progress in negotiating a Deep and 
Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the European Union (EU), concerns over 
Ukraine‚Äòs commitment to European political values may yet set back the integration momentum. 

3. Over the past decade, Ukraine‚Äôs authorities have shied away from addressing the challenges 
of state capture and corruption, and public trust in the state has been undermined.  This in turn 
has created public resistance to necessary but painful reforms of social transfers and public services .  
Consecutive governments have thus opted for short-term fiscal handouts, which have diminished the 
fiscal space needed for public investment and weakened the focus on strategic priorities.  Lack of a 
level playing field and persistent fiscal pressures have limited private entry and, in consequence, 
investment and productivity growth has been slow by regional standards.  Without renewed trust, the 
government continues to struggle. Without reform, public sector performance continues to disappoint.  
World Bank Group analytical work and many public voices in Ukraine indicate that weaknesses in 
public governance are rooted in the lack of constructive relations between the authorities and civil 
society and business.  

4. 
President Yanukovych came to power with the mandate of introducing more effective 
economic management, in a country characterized by deep political divisions and public 
disappointment about past economic and social outcomes. In response, the Economic Reform 
Program of President for 2010-2014 not only sets out an ambitious reform agenda but also puts 
emphasis on improving implementation by strengthening institutions, imposing discipline on the 
bureaucracy, and reining in corruption. The President has confirmed the country‚Äòs European orientation 
which ‚Äì among others ‚Äì would help to strengthen implementation mechanisms and governance 
standards. Results of the Program so far have been mixed in the face of strong vested interests and 
growing public reform fatigue. There is growing understanding in the government that increasingly 
complex reforms in sensitive social areas such as pensions, healthcare, or municipal services cannot be 
effective without public engagement, particularly at the local level, in monitoring and implementation. 
Ukraine needs a shift in the governance paradigm ‚Äì moving away from a system dominated by the state 
to a system inviting participation by a broad array of social stakeholders. This new participatory model

opinion polls published by Ukrainian research institutes such as the Razumkov Center, the Gorshenin Institute, or 
the Institute of Sociology.

of social relations has already started to emerge in few cities with constructive cooperation between 
elected mayors and civil society and business organizations. 

5. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012-16 aims to assist Ukraine in overcoming 
implementation bottlenecks identified in the Presidential Program and thus help to make 
progress in the declared ambitious reform and EU integration agenda. It will support efforts of the 
authorities to improve relations with civil society and business; to turn social distrust into support for 
reform and make government both more accountable and more effective. The willingness and 
determination of the authorities at all levels will be critical to success in the ambitious reform agenda . 
The World Bank Group will adjust its policy dialogue, lending, investment, and technical assistance 
respectively to respond to the government‚Äòs demonstrated commitment. Support of donors in building 
the capacity of CSOs will continue to be very important. 

6. 
 The Bank's support is organized around two pillars, both emphasizing the importance of 
improved governance for sustained socio-economic progress in Ukraine.  Pillar I supports deepened  
relations between government and citizens, focused on improving public services, sustainability and 
efficiency of public finances, and a more transparent and accountable use of public resources.  Pillar II 
supports more productive cooperation between government and business by focusing on growth, 
competitiveness and job creation, improvements in the business climate, the promotion of domestic 
investment and foreign direct investments (FDI) to achieve productivity improvements , and channeling 
public investment into critical public infrastructure. 

7. Areas of engagement will continue to be defined selectively and flexibly with a focus on 
quality and development effectiveness.  Lending constraints on the Bank side, as well as lessons 
learned regarding the importance of building a track-record of implementation, are likely to limit the 
number of new investment lending operations to a maximum of two per annum. A key continuing focus 
of the CPS will be improving portfolio quality, including increased disbursements in the existing 
investment portfolio and strengthening institutional implementation capacity on the client side . The 
CPS does not specify a detailed lending program beyond FY14, given past experience and the need to 
adapt nimbly to changing country circumstances and priorities.  The results matrix reflects primarily the 
impact of activities launched until end FY14, given the considerable lead time needed in Ukraine to see 
concrete results on the ground. 

8. 
The Bank's assistance to Ukraine in the new CPS will be calibrated to match the scope and 
instruments of support to the strength of the authorities' commitment, capacity and track-record 
in key areas of potential engagement.  Specifically, investment loans will be offered where 
governance risks are manageable, where a track record of implementation has been established and 
capacity has been built and where there is broad consensus on the general policy framework. Analytical 
and advisory services will be offered to help strengthen reform consensus and build capacity. 
Development policy lending will be contingent on demonstrated progress in tackling key governance 
weaknesses and thereby on evident commitment and leadership in overcoming vested interests to carry 
out a coherent reform and development strategy.  

9. 
The investment lending program for the first two years of the CPS envisages base level 
support in the range of USD 500 million per annum.  The current investment lending pipeline for 
FY13 includes a follow up to the existing Roads and Safety Improvement project and an additional 
financing to the State Statistical System Development project.  In FY14, indicative lending includes an 
operation to support scaling up targeted social assistance, a second Urban Infrastructure project and a 
Gas Sector Efficiency and Modernization project. Financing amounts are still indicative and the total 
lending envelope may change based on the government‚Äòs demand and the Bank‚Äòs lending capacity. In 
FY15-16, additional investment lending may be envisaged in the following areas: (i) transport and trade 
facilitation, (ii) energy efficiency and energy security, (iii) municipal services and governance, (iv) 
health services and financing, (v) private sector development and access to financing. 

v 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. The calibrated engagement strategy leaves scope for an upward revision of lending amounts 
through the addition of DPLs should reforms accelerate and consistent progress on governance 
be made. The Second Programmatic Financial Rehabilitation Development Policy Loan could be 
delivered quickly and a new cross-sectoral DPL series (building on the earlier DPL I-III series) 
supporting improved economic governance and competitiveness could be launched in FY13-15 subject 
to the government's request for IBRD resources, Ukraine's performance, IBRD's financial capacity, 
demand from other borrowers, and global economic developments. 

11. 
IFC will contribute to the CPS outcomes under the second pillar through combined 
investment and advisory operations for the development of the private sector. IFC strategy in 
Ukraine will continue to support: (i) banking sector stabilization and targeted finance, (ii) agribusiness, 
and (iii) infrastructure, accompanied by two cross-cutting themes of improving business environment 
and promoting energy efficiency. 

12. All areas of engagement in the CPS will build on strong diagnostic work and technical 
assistance, with a focus on building greater consensus in society regarding policies and processes 
to tackle key structural challenges.  Key focus areas for analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) 
engagement will be (i) the investment climate, including advice in key policy areas such as agriculture, 
land, business regulations, (ii) fiscal, tax and PFM, (iii) energy efficiency and governance (including 
gas sector modernization), (iv) financial sector stability and development, (v) municipal governance and 
service delivery, (vi) social reforms (targeted social assistance and pension reform) and (vii) health 
sector reforms.  Partnerships in policy dialogue and AAA with the European Commission (EC), the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID), 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and other bilateral donors will continue 
and be expanded where possible. 

13. The CPS will benefit from more focused risk management and implementation support.  
The new approach is three pronged: (i) greater attention to implementation readiness by incorporating 
the lessons of the CPS Completion Report (CR) ("readiness filter"), (i i) greater attention to governance 
and anti-corruption (GAC) risks and opportunities through upstream diagnostic work and broader 
consultations and consensus building to mitigate political economy risks, and (iii) development of 
selected pilot initiatives to bring in non-state actors as partners, to be reviewed and scaled up at mid-
stream.  These initiatives extend work already begun under the previous CPS but this CPS brings 
implementation and GAC risks to the forefront of the World Bank Group (WBG) engagement in 
Ukraine. 

14. Risks to the objectives of the CPS remain high due to historically disappointing 
implementation of reforms, a mixed track-record of the existing portfolio. The proposed calibrated 
assistance program allows the Bank to respond to the strength of the government‚Äòs reform commitment. 
The governance and readiness filters and the emphasis on consensus building and consultation with a 
broad array of stakeholders should help mitigate implementation risks, while a strong analytical and 
advisory program in macroeconomic and financial sector policies as well as close coordination with 
other development partners will provide a basis to react quickly to external shocks.  

15. A key macroeconomic risk is related to access to external financing.  The existing Stand-by 
Arrangement with the IMF is at risk to be discontinued and rollover risks are exacerbated by large debt 
service repayments falling due in 2012, including to the Fund.  Sustaining progress in critical areas such 
as fiscal consolidation is predicated on politically difficult reforms such as energy tariff increases for 
households and utilities and addressing structural problems in the gas sector will severely test the 
government's resolve, especially ahead of parliamentary elections in 2012. Ukraine depends critically 
on growth in the EU for export prospects.  The exposure to European banks is high and Europe‚Äòs 
banking crisis or banks deleveraging could cause financial instability in Ukraine.  These risks cannot be 
mitigated by the Bank; however, experience during the 2008-09 crisis also suggests that the authorities 
can and do act quickly at times of crisis to regain access to financing.

I. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Introduction 

16. Ukraine‚Äôs economy remains vulnerable and many spheres of economic and social activity 
are in need of fundamental reforms.  Over the last 20 years there has been no shortage of strategic 
visions and government programs to realize Ukraine‚Äòs vast economic potential. 
 However, 
implementation of these programs has been disappointing and performance has remained below 
expectations. 

17. Three main factors account for Ukraine‚Äôs mixed reform implementation: inherited 
industrial assets and natural wealth which limited the incentives for reform, the gradual erosion 
of public trust in the government and in most of public institutions, and the lack of a strong 
external anchor to drive the reform process.  Ukraine inherited capacity in metallurgy and chemicals, 
revenues collected from the transit of energy resources from Russia to Europe, and abundant resources 
of fertile land have created economic rents which allowed Ukraine to muddle through without deep 
reforms.  The concentration of these rents in the hands of few privileged domestic entrepreneurs has 
bred widespread state capture and contributed to the erosion of social trust. 

18. Lack of trust in the state has consistently undermined public support for economic reform.  
The transition recession of the early 1990s has left deep scars.  The outcome of the early transition 
years was the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few and the erosion of social security and 
public service standards.  The failure of early reform efforts to deliver tangible improvements and the 
failure of government to stem state capture and corruption have sapped public support for reform and 
prompted successive administrations to opt for short-term fiscal hand-outs instead.  Unlike in non-CIS 
transition economies, Ukraine failed to benefit from the strong anchor of an EU membership 
perspective which might have provided a focal point for reform efforts.  

19. Ukraine‚Äôs traditional engines of growth are running out of steam and economic risks are 
significant.  Without the attraction of FDI and the encouragement of domestic investment and 
entrepreneurship, Ukraine risks repeating previous boom and bust cycles without significantly catching 
up with its western neighbors.  Internationally, Ukraine risks being overtaken in its traditional markets 
by competitors in Asia. The current volatile international economic environment only exacerbates these 
risks.  

20. President Yanukovych‚Äôs declared commitment towards European integration and the 
reform roadmap laid out in his 2010-14 Presidential Reform Program present an opportunity to 
address Ukraine‚Äôs structural economic weaknesses, if combined with concerted efforts to improve 
governance.  Ukraine stands at an important juncture of an Association Agreement with the European 
Union, including a DCFTA which would provide an anchor for economic reforms.  Some important 
steps have been taken in setting a legislative framework for anti-corruption, responding in part to 
recommendations of international organizations including the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) and the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).  There is growing 
understanding among the country‚Äòs leadership that without a more constructive dialogue with civil 
society and business, ambitious development goals will not be achieved.  Heightened risks in global 
financial markets lend additional urgency to Ukraine‚Äòs comprehensive reform agenda. 

21. The CPS 12-16 will focus on assisting the government to address bottlenecks to the 
implementation of the 2010-14 Presidential Program.  The Program provides a foundation for 
reinvigorating reform efforts; however, to be successful, the lessons of past disappointments need to be 
taken into account.  Instruments and levels of financial assistance to the Program provided by this CPS 
will be calibrated to allow the Bank to target support where commitment is strongest and a positive 
track-record has been established, and to increase support in response to clear signals that the 
authorities are beginning to tackle governance weaknesses. This CPS envisages significantly scaled up 
activities to engage with civil society and other stakeholders to promote the case for reform.

B. Social and Political Context 

22. After almost 2 years in power, President Yanukovych and the coalition government formed 
in the wake of his presidential victory face significant economic and political challenges.  Despite 
rapid progress in consolidating power and overcoming the divisions and paralysis that characterized 
relations between the previous President and the then Prime Minister, early reform momentum has been 
seriously weakened and public resistance against unpopular measures to bring sustainability to public 
finances, such as pension reform, utility price increases, or the reform of social privileges runs high.   

23. 
In foreign policy, the authorities have sought to balance relations with both East and West, 
but tensions with both sides remain.  Under the Yanukovych Presidency, Ukraine has improved 
relations with Russia without however abandoning the priority of European integration.  The country 
has completed technical negotiations on a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) and an 
Association Agreement with the European Union.  However, high profile criminal cases brought 
against opposition leaders have raised concerns in Europe and in the USA, and may stall the progress 
towards the Association Agreement. Ukraine has signed a new Free Trade Agreement with the 
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, but has declared that it does not envisage 
joining the Common Economic Space with Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.  

24. Ukraine‚Äôs civil society is vocal and strong.  In 2010, there were about 4,000 active Civil Society 
Organizations (CSOs), with some 40 percent having permanent staff of 3 and more.  They covered a 
broad range of issues of civic education, human rights protection, social issues, politics, public 
governance and economy; youth and children and regional development.  As only 10 percent of CSOs 
have an annual budget of more than USD 50,000, CSOs leverage their position by joint activities - 
some 70 percent are members of coalitions or networks.  The capacity of the Ukrainian CSOs for 
advocacy and lobbying was ranked above world average by United Consumer Advocacy Network 
(UCAN).  The vitality of Ukraine‚Äòs civil society presents a potential opportunity for the government to 
rebuild public support by inviting civil society to a dialogue over economic and social priorities and to 
monitor the outcome of policies.  However, for this opportunity to become reality, CSOs will need 
support to improve their capacity for evidence based policy analysis and for monitoring the outcomes of 
government reform measures. Support of donors in building the capacity of CSOs will continue to be 
very important. 

C. The Economic Context 

i. Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook 

25. Ukraine‚Äôs economy returned to growth in 2010-2011, but the recovery remains fragile.  
After a 14.8 percent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decline in 2009, the economy grew 4.2 percent in 
2010, and posted 6.6 percent growth in the third quarter of 2011.  Domestic demand has played an 
increasing role in driving growth in 2010 and 2011, in contrast with 2009.  Industrial production has 
also recovered but with volatile growth rates, highlighting the dependence on few commodity prices 
such as steel (See Figure 1). 

26. 
 Improved external debt roll-over rates have financed the widening current account deficit, 
but FDI remains subdued.  The current account deficit deteriorated in the second half of 2010, leading 
to a USD 2.9 billion (2.1 percent of GDP) deficit for the year.  This trend has continued into 2011.  
Rising domestic demand has driven up import growth, while exports have been depressed with the 
introduction of export quotas on grain in the fall of 2010 (and other policy interventions in the 
agriculture sector).  External private debt roll-over rates improved to 109 percent in 2010, supporting 
net inflows in the capital account.  Net FDI inflows amounted to 4.2 percent GDP in 2010. FDI flows 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remain low compared to the pre-crisis level, partly due to governance concerns and the poor investment 
climate. 

27. Monetary policy has been anchored in exchange rate stability with lesser but growing 
attention to inflation.  Although amendments to the law on the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) 
(adopted in mid-2010) shifted the focus of policy towards price stability as the primary objective ,   
however, the NBU de facto continues to aim for exchange rate stability as an anchor of macroeconomic 
stability, trying to avoid excessive fluctuations.  Since August 2011, the NBU has lost around USD 5.8 
billion in reserves to defend the current exchange rate and monetary conditions have significantly 
tightened. Inflation has declined significantly in 2011 and is forecast to end the year below 6 percent.   

28. Fiscal policy has been concentrated on the gradual reduction of the deficit, but structural 
measures to secure sustainability remain incomplete.  The new IMF supported program (approved in 
July 2010) set the general government deficit for 2010 at 5.5 percent of GDP and 3.5 percent in 2011.  
In addition, the State Owned Oil and Gas Enterprise Naftogaz was expected to run a 1 percent of GDP 
deficit in 2010 and balance its finances in 2011.  The target for 2010 was missed, chiefly on the account 
of a larger deficit in Naftogaz.  Steady tariff increases in gas and heating are needed to entrench fiscal 
consolidation.  The implementation of pension reform approved in September 2011 is essential to 
restore sustainability to the system, safeguard the security of future pensioners and thereby strengthen 
incentives to contribute.  These reforms, together with other measures on the expenditure side are 
critical to stabilize public debt (currently above 41 percent of GDP).   

29. Ukraine made progress in restoring financial sector stability during the global financial 
crisis; though in the face of external volatility the financial system needs to become more resilient 
to potential future shocks.   After significant deposit outflows during October 2008 ‚Äì March 2009, the 
situation has stabilized, banks have been recapitalized, and deposits have returned to the system. The 
banks‚Äò non-performing loans (NPLs) remain high at around 40 percent, with few policy measures so far 
taken to address them. Low client demand and high risk aversion are limiting lending growth and NPLs 
depress bank earnings.  Volatility in international financial markets and pressures for increased 
deleveraging among European banks, which hold around one third of Ukraine‚Äòs banking system assets, 
raise new risks given significant outstanding external liabilities and the reliance of the balance of 
payments on sustained roll-over rates.  Commercial banks taken over by the state remain unresolved.  
All these risks call for a comprehensive program of strengthening crisis resilience and laying the 
foundations for a return to sustained private sector credit expansion. A framework was established for 
recapitalization of systemic problem banks and for least-cost resolution of non-systemic problem banks.  
The Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) was strengthened in 2009 and steps were taken to turn the DGF 
into a problem bank resolution agency.

30. The Bank‚Äôs base case forecast calls for a continued but fragile and not free of risks 
recovery. Assuming that conditions in the Eurozone do not deteriorate beyond moderate expectations, 
GDP growth is expected to be 2.5 percent in 2012. Growth rates would be around 4 to 5 percent over 
the medium term, below Ukraine‚Äòs potential given serious GDP decline in 2009.  Assuming that the 
IMF program carries on (which is not certain at the moment), financing for the widening current 
account deficit would be secured and progress on fiscal consolidation would be achieved through the 
implementation of pension reform, utility tariff increases, and additional measures (although such 
measures are politically difficult and can be challenging to implement).  Inflation would come down 
gradually, with energy and municipal tariff increases creating upward pressure in 2012.

31. A combination of external and domestic factors poses significant downside risks to 
Ukraine‚Äôs economic outlook.  The increased uncertainty in international financial markets has resulted 
in a lower appetite for risk, and investors have opted to reduce their exposure to several emerging 
markets, including Ukraine.  As Figure 2 shows, Ukrainian sovereign bond spreads have almost 
doubled over August-October 2011, reaching 970 basis points.  While this remains significantly below 
historical highs of 2009, the costs of rolling-over both public and private external debt are now non-
negligible. Ukraine‚Äòs public sector, banks and corporations faced about USD 50 billion (almost 30 
percent of estimated GDP) of external debt repayment in 2012.  In 2012, the Government has to repay 
USD 8.2 billion (4.5 percent of GDP) in domestic and external debt.  Public sector financing 
requirements thus make prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to retain official 
financing support and improve investor confidence especially critical.  However, parliamentary 
elections scheduled for October 2012, may relax the required spending restraints and undermine the 
efforts.

ii. Business Environment and Competitiveness  

32. 
Improvement in Ukraine‚Äôs medium-term growth prospects requires substantial private 
investment to modernize industrial facilities, increase energy efficiency and improve agricultural 
yields.  Ukraine has significant unexploited efficiency reserves in the real sector, but without significant 
complementary private investment and public spending to improve transport, energy and municipal 
infrastructure, these reserves cannot be tapped.  Lack of competitive pressures and a poor investment 
climate have tilted private sector incentives against investing in the official real sector, and instead 
sponsored a burgeoning shadow economy. Constraints in the business environment have also limited 
opportunities for Ukraine to better exploit its scientific and research potential.

33. While some progress has been made 
on regulatory issues, barriers to successful 
business remain high.  Ukraine has been 
trapped 
in 
a 
self-perpetuating 
low 
equilibrium of high entry barriers, 
low 
competition, 
limited 
incentives 
for 
technology 
adoption, 
low 
export 
diversification 
and 
sophistication, high 
vulnerability 
to commodity prices, and 
incumbent fears of reduced rents if entry 
barriers were reduced. 
 Heavy handed 
administrative practices hinder market 
contestability 
and 
competition, 
create 
corruption opportunities and ultimately 
generate losses to the economy.  Regulatory 
barriers affect mainly small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) and foreign entry (FDI). 
Ukraine has a very low number of new 
entries of firms compared to other emerging 
economies, which considerably reduces the 
potential of productivity gains and economic 
diversification, and job creation. 

Box 1. SMEs: Barriers to Entry and Exit and Lack of 
Competition  

Ukraine ranks 152th out of 183 countries on the ease of 
doing business (Doing Business 2012 Survey) ‚Äì and 
worsened its position from 149 th in the previous year 
ranking. Reforms to entry regulations, the tax system and to 
construction permits undertaken during the first half of 2011 
came too late to affect the 2012 rankings. 

On registering property (rank 166 th), trading across the 
borders (140th), construction permits (180 th), getting 
electricity (169th), resolving insolvency (156th) and paying 
taxes (181th) Ukraine trails at the very bottom of the global 
economy.  

To start a business it takes 9 procedures and 24 days; to 
close a business, owners have to go through a long, 
cumbersome, and costly process - it takes almost 3 years to 
close a business in Ukraine.  

Ukraine ranking worsened on trading across the borders in 
the face of new customs inspection requirements.  It takes 
about a month to cross the border while for Ukraine‚Äòs 
western neighbors it takes about two weeks.  

34. FDI has been lackluster; moreover, FDI has been concentrated on thin capitalization 
schemes of existing businesses often recycling domestic capital via tax havens (Figure 3).  
Transformational FDI in the real sector that would bring technology, enable modernization and foster 
diversification - central to the economic development strategy of the country ‚Äì has been insignificant. 

Figure 3. FDI amounts and ‚Äúquality‚Äù continue a downward trend 

35. The share of the shadow economy in Ukraine is one of the highest in the world.  According 
to national statistics, in 2010, 4.7 million people in Ukraine between the ages of 15-70 worked in the 
informal sector, equivalent to about 23 percent of total employment. International comparative studies 
put the shadow economy at 55 percent of GDP (average over 1999-2007), or 145th the largest out of 151 
countries for which estimates have been produced.2 Informality is concentrated in rural areas, partly 
because of the prevalence of informality in the agricultural sector. It is also most common among the

Research Working Paper 5356.

low-skilled workers, those aged 60-70 years and slightly more prevalent among men than women. 
Increasing formalization is important for Ukraine‚Äòs development even though its fiscal impact is likely 
to be limited initially (perennial difficulty to tax under-reported wages and profits), as it would bring 
other important benefits, such as increased productivity, greater investment in human capital and more 
innovation. 

36. Ukraine has tremendous agricultural resources which can become a potential new engine of 
growth through high value-added food production chains.  However, the sector has been plagued by 
inconsistent government policy, intervening in domestic and export markets to benefit selected 
businesses, and by the failure of contract enforcement which has significantly increased financing cos ts 
and cut-off most middle sized farms from any bank credit. Ukraine has gone through a cycle of export 
restrictions and their subsequent abolition. In particular, during 2010-11 Ukraine implemented export 
restrictions not justified by shortages of grain in the local market.  These restrictions (mostly revoked 
by now) caused significant losses to exporters and undermined the trust of investors, potentially causing 
longer term damage in terms of forgone investment opportunities in grain handling and storage, 
logistics, but also upstream farming. Consistent and credible policy signals are thus needed for the 
country to capitalize on its agro-potential.  Agricultural land, while formally privatized in the early 
2000s, remains non-tradable; while a lease market has developed, land is undervalued and hence 
incentives for investments in higher land productivity are low (in recent years the sector has seen 
increased investments by large agro-holdings). The authorities plan to lift the moratorium on land sale 
to attract investment, but there are justified concerns that the general unpreparedness of the land market 
could result in underpricing and large sways of fertile land ending up in the hands of well -connected 
insiders.  

37. The Ukrainian economy generates far more transport volumes relative to its GDP than any 
other country in Europe due to the role of agriculture and heavy industry.  The transport system 
has substantial potential to improve aggregate productivity and regional competitiveness but requires 
significant investments in roads and railways.  Bank estimates that Ukraine should spend around 1.5 
percent of GDP on road maintenance alone, and investment needs are at around USD 5 billion over 10 
years.  Ukraine‚Äòs current spending is a fraction of this amount , and poor conditions of Ukraine‚Äòs 
intercity roads are an important cost factor. Ukraine‚Äòs relatively efficient railway transport system also 
needs large investments in track renewal, track capacity increases, electrification, rolling stock 
replacement and terminals. These investments would contribute to increased competitiveness of 
Ukraine‚Äòs heavy industries and agricultural exports, and limit a shift of rail cargo and passenger 
transport to road transport with benefits of lower carbon emissions.3 

38. Ukraine 
is among the most 
energy-intensive economies 
in the 
world (Figure 4).  The primary energy 
supply in Ukraine is dominated by fossil 
fuels: natural gas (39 percent), coal (30 
percent) and oil (10 percent).  About 70 
percent of 
the 
total natural gas 
consumed is imported from Russia.  
Industrial inefficiencies are significant, 
the efficiency of communal district 
heating is estimated to be about five 
times below that in Western Europe due 
to lack of investments, metering, and 
limited price signals.4

Memorandum (2010) for an analysis of the impact of infrastructure deficits on growth.

D. Public Governance and Corruption 

39. Corruption and state capture are broadly recognized as a major development constraint.  
Ukraine has had persistently low rankings on critical aspects of governance.  A range of indicators, such 
as the Index of Economic Freedom of the Heritage Foundation and the Corruption Perception Index of 
Transparency International reveal a further deterioration in the past three years.  The World Bank 
Institute‚Äòs (WBI‚Äòs) Governance Indicators show a largely inconsistent pattern since the mid -1990s, but 
with Ukraine ranked below the 50th percentile globally on all six dimensions (Figure 5).

Ukraine‚Äòs national savings rates have improved in recent years. Yet, clearly, there is much room for further 
improvement.

40. The sources of weak governance are complex.  Ukraine shares weak governance with many 
former Soviet Republics, suggesting that historical legacies play an important role, such as the 
emergence of oligarchs who have sponsored political parties and often exercise strong influence over 
government officials and institutions.  Civil society, while strong, has not yet become a force to 
influence politicians and decision makers to act in the public interest. Social collective action is often 
hampered by the juxtaposition of unrealistically high expectations of what the state should deliver 
against low confidence in its ability to do so. A weak judicial system has provides limited options for 
legal redress. 

41. Vulnerabilities to corruption are found along two main value chains.  The first chain runs 
along the management of public resources, with key weaknesses in areas such as public procurement, 
the management of state-owned enterprises, non-transparent quasi-fiscal flows in the energy sector, and 
public investment planning and execution.  The second chain links the state to business and citizens, 
where corruption is prevalent in the provision of public services, in tax administration , customs and 
business inspection, and the creation of economic rents through government intervention.  

42. Ukraine‚Äôs procurement and financial management systems are risky but acceptable subject 
to mitigation.  The 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) ranked 
Ukraine above average for lower Middle Income Countries (MICs).  An internal Bank analysis carried 
out in preparation for the previous CPS found weaknesses in procurement and financial management 
systems, but suggested Bank lending could go ahead with due attention to risk mitigation measures.  
The Law on Public Procurement adopted in 2010 and further amended in 2011 follows European 
standards and received positive opinions from the Bank and international experts , though effective 
implementation has only started. Ukraine performs well in the area of the availability of budget 
information, as rated by the Open Budget Initiative5.  The overall conclusions for the purposes of this 
CPS remains the same (see Annex 5) but a re-evaluation of implementation risks to structural reforms 
resulting from governance weaknesses has led the Bank to halt Development Policy Lending until the 
government shows its commitment to tackle governance weaknesses.  

43. Ukraine has recently strengthened its legal framework to address corruption. The newly 
adopted anti-corruption law provides a framework for fighting corruption and a Presidential decree ‚ÄïOn 
Anticorruption Strategy in 2012-2015‚Äñ sets out a roadmap for Ukraine to implement many 
recommendations of OECD and the Council of Europe‚Äòs GRECO.  Key remaining legal weaknesses 
include the lack of rules for compulsory financial disclosure by public officials and the absence of a 
competent anti-corruption body with enforcement powers. Moreover, the DCFTA negotiations and 
associated regulatory reforms, such as the adoption of a new public procurement framework, and 
improvements in the licensing and certification system, provide the opportunity to tackle corruption 
risks in these areas.  

44. Ukraine has also taken steps to improve access to information.  The Law on Access to 
Information adopted in early 2011 follows best international practices and marks a significant step 
forward despite inconsistent implementation to date. Ukraine has committed to join the Open 
Government Partnership Initiative and launched domestic consultations to draft a National Action Plan.     

E. Poverty, Quality of Life, MDGs, Gender 

45. Ukraine has experienced a substantial reduction in poverty rates over the last decade.  In 
the pre-crisis years, the headcount index fell steadily from 47 percent in 2002 to just 8.9 percent in 2008 
using a poverty line of USD 5 (purchasing power parity), with a faster decline in urban areas. National 
indicators of relative poverty, however, show less of a decline6. The decline in absolute poverty rates 

5 http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/country-info/?country=ua 
6 Poverty assessments vary depending of the methodology chosen to measure it. When an alternative approach - 
assessment of the relative poverty ‚Äì has been used the perception of poverty (living below minimum subsistence)

was mostly driven by real wage increases but aided also by substantial government transfers.  Inequality 
has remained moderate by regional standards.  Social assistance transfers account for 2.5% of GDP 
(2009), comparable with the OECD average.  

46. Despite a significant GDP contraction in 2009, poverty increased only moderately (by 1 
percentage point).  However, the impact of the crisis on poverty has been more profound when 
measured by the number of people who would have avoided poverty were it not for the crisis ‚Äì this 
stood at 1.4 million, or 3.2 percent of the population7 (see Figure 6 a-b).  The transmission channels of 
the crisis to the population were multiple, including tightening of the labor market, decline in real 
wages, and increased household debt service costs due to the exchange rate change. The results could 
have been worse were it not for coping mechanisms that helped to contain a potentially larger negative 
impact of the crisis on poverty. For example, instead of employment shedding, a significant portion of 
private sector firms resorted to part time employment (there was little employment shedding in the 
public sector). Households tapped their savings during 2009 until employment and wages started 
picking up in 2010.  

47. Ukraine has an extensive social protection system and spends a sizeable share of GDP on 
non-contributory social assistance programs, including through income-tested programs. 
However, in terms of targeting accuracy of the overall social assistance, Ukraine does not score high 
within the group of transition economies, because a large share of the spending is channeled through 
programs with mediocre targeting accuracy. About 24 percent of the overall spending is reaching the 
poorest 10 percent of the population and only 37.4 percent of the social assistance spending goes to the 
poorest 20 percent of the population.

48. The health system is costly and outcomes are unsatisfactory. Adult death rates in Ukraine 
(particularly for males) are among the highest in the world.  Non-communicable diseases and injuries 
are the main culprits for the mortality crisis in Ukraine: cardiovascular diseases and all other non-
communicable diseases are responsible for approximately 79 percent of the total number of deaths, 
followed by injuries and poisoning with 14 percent (most of which are alcohol-related and traffic-
related injuries), and communicable, maternal, and perinatal diseases at 7 percent.  The health care 
sector is characterized by an oversized hospital sector (the third in Europe in terms of number of 

has been worsening over the last post-crisis years, and the incidence of poverty has been higher. This CPS uses the 
absolute poverty line cut-off as a better indicator of poverty during the volatile time. 
7 This estimate is obtained by using the pre-crisis trend in poverty reduction to estimate a ‚Äïwithout crisis‚Äñ scenario

49. Literacy rates and school enrollment have been traditionally high.  However, demographic 
and economic realities require deep reforms to improve the inefficient platform of education 
provision.  While there is a shortage of places in childcare facilities, Ukraine has an oversized school 
network.  The number of teachers and schools barely changed despite the severe (40 percent) decline in 
student population over the last two decades.  Efficiency indicators including the average school size 
and the student-teacher ratio (9 on average, one of the lowest in the world) have been falling sharply.  
Increasing budget allocations to education have had not resulted in improvements in the quality of 
education.  In 2007 international assessment of student learning in Math and Science for 4th- and 8th-
graders from Ukraine scored below Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 
average, and below regional comparators such as Armenia, Russia, Lithuania or Kazakhstan. Skill 
mismatch with the demand of the labor market is becoming an issue. 

50. The municipal services sector in Ukraine suffers from decades of underinvestment and poor 
maintenance adding to the worsening quality of life.  The investment backlog in water and 
wastewater utilities is substantial8 and existing low tariffs are a major limitation to the sustainability of 
utilities.  The needs for rehabilitation are exacerbated by the overall high energy consumption in water 
production and wastewater treatment - the energy use intensity in Ukraine is one of the highest in the 
region. 

8 Investment and rehabilitation needs of water supply and sanitation are USD7 billion. Water supply investments 
require 60 percent of that amount, and the remaining 40 percent is needed for the rehabilitation of sanitati on 
systems. An additional USD7 billion is needed for district heating companies and retrofitting activities on the 
demand side (World Bank Public Finance Review, 2006).

51. Ukraine‚Äôs progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been uneven.  
Ukraine has reduced absolute poverty and has made progress in achieving the targets for education, 
maternal health and child mortality.  At the same time, reducing gender inequality and meeting the 
targets on sustainable environmental development continue to be a challenge.  Importantly, HIV 
remains a critical area for improvement.  Ukraine has the highest estimated adult prevalence rate of 
HIV in Europe at 1.3 percent.  The national response to the AIDS epidemic has brought some positive 
results; mother-to-child transmission rates were reduced from 21 percent in 2002 to 6 percent in 2010.  
However, overall the scope and quality of interventions have been insufficient to reduce the spread of 
HIV. 

52. Although Ukraine took steps towards implementation of gender conscious legislation, 
problems of gender inequality are widespread in Ukrainian society and require a long-term 
solution.  Despite a tertiary education ratio of 1.19 female to male students, there is a high level of 
professional gender segregation.  In particular, women are underrepresented in political life (the 
administration and business management).  While over the past two decades women have become 
active entrepreneurs, with around one third of private businesses run by women, only a very small 
fraction of managers in large firms are women.  Ukraine is also characterized by a significant gender 
gap in income levels as well as feminization of poverty as women dominate among the vulnerable 
categories of the population (one-parent families with children and elderly living alone).  Illegal 
migration and human trafficking, as well as domestic violence, represent further risks to women.  At the 
same time, there is a huge gender gap of 10 years in the average life expectancy between women and 
men, mainly as a result of extremely high mortality among working age men (more on gender issues in 
Annex 6).

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND 
GOVERNMENT AGENDA 

THE 

A. Government Agenda  

53. President Yanukovych came to power with the mandate of introducing more effective 
economic management, in a country characterized by deep political divisions and overall 
disappointment with past economic and social outcomes. In response, the Economic Reform 
Program of President for 2010-2014, not only sets out an ambitious reform agenda but also puts 
emphasis on improving  implementation by strengthening institutions, imposing discipline on the 
bureaucracy, and reining in corruption.  The President has also confirmed the country‚Äòs European 
orientation which ‚Äì among others ‚Äì would help to strengthen implementation mechanisms and 
governance standards.   The Presidential Program for 2010-2014 ‚ÄïProsperous Society, Competitive 
Economy, and Efficient State‚Äñ adopted in June 2010 envisages sequencing reform in three stages and 
sets measurable indicators for reform outcomes throughout 2014.  The Program is built on five pillars:  

ÔÇ∑ Sustainable economic development addresses stabilization of the state budget, tax reform, financial 
sector development, and reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations;  

ÔÇ∑ 

ÔÇ∑ 

Improvement of Standards of Living covers reforms of medical care, pension system, education 
and social assistance.  

Improving business climate and attracting 
investments encompasses deregulation and 
entrepreneurship, public asset management and privatization, development of science and 
innovations, and international integration and cooperation.  

ÔÇ∑ Modernization of infrastructure and basic sectors addresses reforms of the power, coal, oil and gas 
and utilities sectors, development of transport infrastructure and agriculture and land reform. 

ÔÇ∑ Raising public administration efficiency presents reforms to improve the efficiency of government 
agencies by merging some agencies, streamlining bureaucratic processes, and rationalizing state 
employment.  

54. Results of the Program so far have been mixed which may be understood given layers of 
resistance with roots reaching to Ukraine‚Äôs Soviet past. Fiscal consolidation has started but 
underlying fiscal imbalances and inefficiencies in the allocation of government spending have not been 
fully tackled. Pension reform marks a significant step forward, health sector reforms have been 
launched and the government is committed to improve targeting of social transfers. These efforts have 
not so far been followed by improvements in the quality of public services. Despite significant 
deregulation efforts, the investment climate remains poor, the security of property rights has been 
undermined by cases of forced change of ownership and corruption in the judicial system, and ‚Äì in 
result - foreign investors remain lukewarm to Ukraine (the significant part of FDI is in fact the local 
capital circulated through offshore accounts). The backlog of investments in public infrastructure is 
significant, the regulatory and tariff policies inadequate to attract private investment despite some initial 
pilot public private partnerships and strategic prioritization and cost management in public capital 
spending is poor. The authorities have advanced privatization in the power sector, and sold the state 
fixed line monopoly Ukrtelecom but the transparency of these transactions has been disputed. The 
ambitious administrative reform launched in late 2010 has not yet brought the desired increases in 
administrative efficiency. A self-evaluation of the government‚Äòs implementation of the reform program 
conducted in the Fall of 2011 showed only around 50 percent of the targets for the first 18 months had 
been achieved. 

55. There is growing understanding in the government that increasingly complex and socially 
sensitive reforms cannot be effective without public engagement, particularly at the local level, in 
their design, monitoring and implementation. Improvements in the business climate require dialogue 
with entrepreneurs about the binding constraints to investment and regular feedback to ensure central 
deregulation efforts are matched by changes in the behavior and practices of state agencies on the 

13 

 
 
 
ground. Ukraine needs a shift in the governance paradigm ‚Äì moving away from the system dominated 
by the state to a system inviting participation by a broad array of stakeholders.  This new model of 
relations already started to emerge in a few cities with constructive cooperation between elected mayors 
and civil society and business organizations. 

B. Mid-Term Challenges and Opportunities 

56. As the Presidential Reform Program rightly highlights, a multitude of structural and social 
challenges will need to be addressed to deliver sustained and shared growth at rates 
commensurate with Ukraine‚Äôs economic potential.  Over the medium-term the most pressing  
challenges for structural reforms include: 
ÔÇ∑ 
creating a transparent and even playing field for SMEs and FDI by reducing and simplifying entry 
and exit regulations, abstaining from distortive interventions (such as in agriculture) and by 
lowering costs and time burden related to permits and inspections;  
ÔÇ∑ broadening the tax base and improving the efficiency of tax management to reduce the obstacles of 
doing business (particularly for SMEs), reducing informality in the economy, but also creating 
more stable fiscal revenues;  
implementing reform of pensions and other social transfers to reduce currently unsustainable 
budgetary social costs, improve fairness and transparency, and to better target social assistance;  
securing financial and technical viability  of  public services to improve  their availability and 
quality;  
implementing energy sector reforms including phasing out the deficit of Naftogaz and improving 
transparency in the energy sector;  
improving the public financial management system, including implementing a transparent public 
procurement, strengthening corporate governance in state-owned enterprises, and modernizing the 
system of capital budgeting more generally; 
safeguarding the soundness of the banking sector, rationalizing the state‚Äòs role and direct 
ownership in the financial system, including exiting of state ownership from commercial banks.  

ÔÇ∑ 

ÔÇ∑ 

ÔÇ∑ 

ÔÇ∑ 

ÔÇ∑ 

57. These reforms cannot succeed without progress in reducing corruption and improving 
public governance.  However, the reverse is also true - slow or no progress on the above reforms 
would protect rents resulting from economic distortions and further entrench interests vested in the 
status quo.  This vicious circle has to be addressed from both sides: on the one hand, better regulations 
and more transparent institutions should reduce opportunities for corruption; on the other hand, even-
handedness and strong sanctions in high profile corruption cases (irrespective of political affiliations) 
should send a clear signal that regulations and institutions are to be treated seriously.  

58. The planned Association Agreement and DCFTA with the EU could provide an important 
anchor for many of the reforms listed above.  Indeed, agreement with the EU itself could send a 
strong signal to foreign and domestic investors.  The regular public monitoring of compliance with the 
commitments made in the Association Agreement and the existence of a sanctioning mechanism in the 
DCFTA would support implementation of reforms.  This would present Ukraine with an opportunity to 
break the cycle of poor governance and lagging reforms.   

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
C. Long-Term Challenges and Opportunities 

59. Ukraine 
faces 
worrisome 
demographic trends.  Ukraine has one of 
the lowest birth rates in the world (10.8 
live births/1,000 population (2010), which, 
together with high mortality rates (15.2 
deaths/1,000 population) and emigration, 
result in a rapid decline of the population. 
A combination of socio-economic factors, 
including uncertainty and labor market 
conditions, account for the low birth rates. 
A shrinking and graying population and the 
erosion of Ukraine‚Äòs human capital due to 
low quality health and education services 
pose significant risks to Ukraine‚Äòs long-
term development outlook. 
 These 
fundamental challenges cannot be resolved 
within the timeframe of this CPS but 
structural development challenges have to 
be addressed without delay, in particular 
broadening the tax base by improving the 
business environment, right-sizing social 
transfers and improving the efficiency of 
the public sector. Failure or delay would 
cause unsustainable public debt and 
increasing macroeconomic vulnerabilities 
as the population ages (Box 2). 

Box 2. Sustainability of pension system 

At 17.5 percent in 2010, Ukraine has the highest share of 
pension spending in GDP in the world,. Ukraine also has one 
of the highest total contribution rates to the pension system 
in Europe at 35 percent of gross salaries. The total rate of 
contribution to all 4 social insurance funds is above 
41percent.   

The pension fund ran a broad deficit (including transfers 
from the state budget to finance special pension programs ) 
of almost 7 percent of GDP in 2010. Yet, because there are 
13.7 million pensioners, the pension received by a large 
portion of pensioners is low and is being eroded by inflation. 
All this is compounded by a worsening demographic profile 
and large deficits in the system. It is predicted that in 10 
years there will be 1 pensioner for every contributor to the 
system and this ratio will worsen sharply thereafter.   

The government embarked on reforms to the pay-as-you-go 
public pension system in 2011 by gradually raising the 
retirement age and tightening eligibility criteria. These steps 
will help redress financial 
imbalances but additional 
measures will be needed to ensure adequate pension levels 
and affordable contribution rates. Pension reform is not only 
a matter of concern for fiscal sustainability but also for costs 
for business competitiveness and intergenerational fairness. 
It is a challenge Ukraine shares with many other countries in 
Europe. 

60. At the same time, Ukraine has big long-term potential resulting from its strategic location, 
its abundant food production capacity, sophisticated industrial tradition, and hard-working 
entrepreneurial people.   For these advantages to be unleashed Ukraine has to improve its image as an 
investment friendly country with a light regulatory touch, unquestionable property rights, and 
corruption under control.   

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. Lessons Learned during 2008-2011 CPS 

61. The FY08-11 CPS Completion Report (CPS CR, Annex 1) acknowledges the relevance of 
Bank assistance.  This CPS spanned the global economic and financial crisis and important political 
changes in Ukraine which had affected the coherence of economic policy making and the performance 
of the economy and therefore the implementation of the CPS.  The FY08-11 CPS reflected high 
implementation risks, including problems in investment portfolio performance, the uncertain political 
context and weak governance. The CPS was based on modest expectations regarding the pace of 
reform, including in public sector governance, recognizing that the political context and institutional 
weaknesses were not conducive for the government to take on ‚Äïbig ticket‚Äñ items.  The Bank program 
called for selectivity, with a shift of investment lending towards infrastructure projects, continuation of 
DPLs as a tool to advance reforms and a sizable AAA program informing policy dialogue.  At the same 
time, implementation risks, although appropriately identified, were underestimated and the capacity of 
the government to respond likely overestimated.  In particular, the analysis of implementation risks did 
not go deep enough, focusing on selectivity but missing flaws in design and implementation readiness. 

62. The CPS CR rates the previous CPS as moderately unsatisfactory, reflecting the failure to 
achieve planned outcomes due to a delay in fiscal and structural reforms while recognizing the 
15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
timely and effective support offered during the financial crisis.  The Bank‚Äòs crisis response through 
DPLs as part of an international package, coordinated closely with the IMF, the EC and EBRD, helped 
restore confidence and prevent a run on the banking system.  The crisis did, however, set back the 
reform momentum in critical areas such as reducing quasi-fiscal deficits in the energy sector, moving 
forward with pension reform and improving the business climate.  The CPS CR commends the 
authorities and the Bank for the active and detailed work done to improve the implementation of the 
investment portfolio, which achieved some progress towards the end of the CPS period. Nonetheless, 
Ukraine‚Äòs performance remains below the Bank‚Äòs average.  The CPS CR also points to weaknesses in 
the results framework of the FY08-11 CPS, in particular regarding the choice of higher order objectives 
and the overly optimistic timeframe chosen for several key outcome indicators. 

63. The proposed CPS takes into account many of CPS Completion Report recommendations.  
The following key lessons have influenced the design of the CPS: 
ÔÇ∑ Greater attention will be given to implementation risks affecting portfolio performance. 
Interventions will be simple, targeted, and mindful of capacity constraints.  Greater attention to 
project readiness will be given during preparation as inadequate preparation of technical 
specifications and procurement packages is one of the reasons behind significant disbursement 
delays.  Repeater operations and supplemental financing for successful projects will be utilized 
more. 

ÔÇ∑ Risks posed by volatile politics, governance weaknesses, and inconsistencies in policy 
implementation will be mitigated through upfront diagnostic governance assessments and greater 
consensus building around an agreed roadmap for change in each sector as well as through 
greater flexibility to exit when policies shift.  Selectivity at the sectoral level would help support 
reform champions and mitigate governance risks. 

ÔÇ∑ Activities supporting the demand for good governance will be scaled up and integrated with the 
Bank‚Äòs financing and AAA by making greater efforts to involve CSOs in the design and 
monitoring of policies and investments supported by the Bank.  Previous demand side governance 
work mainly relied on advocacy and was insufficiently linked with core Bank operations.  

B. CPS Principles  

64. 
In response to implementation risks and in recognition of lessons learned during the 
previous CPS, the Bank proposes a calibrated approach to financial assistance.  Financing and the 
range of instruments would increase when reforms accelerate and governance improves and the client is 
ready to absorb financing and knowledge, but financial exposure would be kept modest if reforms stall: 

ÔÇ∑ The Bank will offer investment lending to address basic infrastructure needs in the sectors 
with established track records of cooperation.  This includes road construction, state statistics, 
the power sector, municipal utilities and social protection. Investment lending would require 
implementation capacity to be in place (as Board and/or effectiveness conditions) and broad 
agreement on the policy framework in the sector. 
ÔÇ∑ The Bank will offer analytical and advisory services to help create consensus in important 
but controversial reform areas and to build capacity. The AAA program will be key to the 
Bank‚Äòs engagement and prepare the ground for possible financial support. 
ÔÇ∑ Ukraine needs to deepen structural reforms in many areas, including the business climate, 
financial sector regulation, the energy sector, public finance management and fiscal and 
tax policy. The calibrated engagement strategy leaves scope for an upward revision of lending 
amounts through the addition of DPLs which would support reform efforts in these areas. The 
Second Programmatic Financial Rehabilitation Development Policy Loan could be delivered 
quickly and a new cross-sectoral DPL series supporting improved governance (a pre-condition 
to DPLs) and economic competitiveness and building on the early DPL I-III series could be 
launched in FY13-15 subject to the government's request for IBRD resources, Ukraine's 
performance, IBRD's financial capacity, demand from other borrowers, and global economic 
developments. 

16 

 
 
 
 
ÔÇ∑  Inconsistent implementation of past reforms and significant governance problems create 
unacceptable risks for the Bank to provide direct budget support.  The authorities are aware of 
the need for more consistency and have committed themselves to a program of addressing some 
of the most prominent governance concerns: public procurement, VAT refunds, transparency in 
the energy sector, business regulation and red tape, and government investments into failed 
financial institutions.  The government and the Bank will jointly evaluate progress in these areas 
to determine whether DPL lending can be resumed. 

65. The Program, irrespective of its size and lending instruments, will be built on the 
foundations of sound diagnostics.  AAA will be focused on deepening the Bank‚Äòs knowledge of and 
the dialogue with the authorities on key issues affecting development effectiveness in the Bank‚Äòs 
current and planned future portfolio of investment activities.  Core diagnostics in fiscal policy, PFM, 
financial stability and growth will continue. AAA in new areas, where the Bank currently does not have 
or does not plan interventions in the foreseeable future, would be limited.  This implies a more narrow 
scope for advocacy work outside core areas in the Bank program and reflects increasing resource 
constraints.  The potential for reimbursable technical assistance is low at present, but opportunities will 
be actively explored, including making better use of synergies with other donor programs such as EC 
technical assistance.  

C. CPS Pillars and Expected Results 

66. The core objective of this CPS is to help the government overcome implementation 
bottlenecks that have affected successive reform programs. A premise of this CPS is that this will 
require not just work on the content of reforms but also on building more constructive and trustful 
relations between the state, citizens and business. Work would proceed along two main axes: (i) in the 
area of relations between government and citizens, efforts would focus on improving the quality of 
public services, strengthening accountability to service users, cost recovery and financial transparency 
and targeted assistance to the poor and vulnerable; and (ii) in the area of relations between government 
and business, attention will be directed towards the creation of new jobs in the private sector, the 
attraction of FDI and private domestic investment to improve productivity and international 
competitiveness, the creation of transparent and stable rules of the game, and complementary public 
investments in physical infrastructure.  Consequently, Bank supported activities in this CPS are 
organized along two main pillars: (i) support for ‚Äñbuilding relations with citizens‚Äñ and (ii) support 
for‚Äñbuilding relations with business‚Äñ. 

67. The importance of building social trust and stakeholders‚Äô participation to govern effectively 
is increasingly recognized by the country‚Äôs leadership, even if not yet fully embraced at all levels 
of the administration. On the one hand, examples of municipalities where popular mayors build 
effective coalitions with civil society and business organizations are becoming known across the 
country and, on the other hand, reforms with potential benefits for people over the medium term are 
contested because of mistrust and a lack of public participation in their preparation. This CPS draws the 
attention of policy makers to the increasingly binding constraints imposed by the lack of social trust in 
state institutions for the realization of a medium-term reform program.  The design of this CPS supports 
the need for a new approach to policy design and implementation to depart from the muddle through 
strategy of the first two decades of independence. 

68. There is a strong complementarity between steps to increase Ukraine‚Äôs economic potential 
covered under the second pillar and improvements in the social outcomes covered under the first 
pillar.  Embracing the benefits of international openness and competition will require better public 
services and safety nets to protect the vulnerable and those likely to lose from the resulting structural 
changes, at least in the short term.  At the same time, improvements in the business climate are also 
critical to nurture the development of a middle class with a strong stake in a lighter, more effective and 
less intervening state.  Private businesses and citizens wishing to benefit from European and 
international integration are the key stakeholders for successful reform in Ukraine.  This CPS offers 

17 

 
 
 
 
support to the authorities and members of the civil society for collaboration necessary to realize 
Ukraine‚Äòs aspirations.   

69. The expected outcomes of the CPS reflect the calibrated assistance model .  The CPS results 
framework reflects outcomes achievable under the base case.  It provides an accountability framework 
for the existing investment lending portfolio, lending in the pipeline for FY13 and ongoing AAA.  The 
CPS includes AAA program geared towards helping the authorities address the backlog of structural 
reforms and improve governance, where progress is dependent on the authorities‚Äò commitment and 
ability to deliver. Since this would be clear only if the Bank were to return to DPL lending under a high 
case, the results framework would need to be revisited in such a case.   

70. 
IFC will contribute to the CPS outcomes under the second pillar through combined 
investment and advisory operations for the development of the private sector. IFC strategy in 
Ukraine will continue to support: (i) banking sector stabilization and targeted finance, (ii) agribusiness, 
and (iii) infrastructure, accompanied by two cross-cutting themes of improving business environment 
and promoting energy efficiency.  Financial sector stabilization in the aftermath of 2008 crisis and in 
the deteriorating environment due to the Eurozone debt crisis will entail an expansion of the Global 
Trade Finance Program to facilitate trade and possible capital and liquidity support of selected banks. 
The investment and advisory work on distressed assets and non-performing loans will continue. In the 
longer term, IFC will provide targeted financing through banks for SMEs, energy efficiency and the 
agribusiness sector. In addition, agribusiness development, which constitutes the core part of IFC‚Äòs 
strategy in Ukraine, will be supported throughout the supply chain to address the main bottlenecks to 
the sector‚Äòs growth and to generate broad sectoral impact. In its agribusiness investments, IFC will 
place emphasis on projects with individual companies to maximize impact through demonstration 
effect. Investments in agribusiness will be accompanied by advisory work to improve investment 
climate for agribusiness, bring food safety standards to international level, and develop agri -finance and 
agri-insurance. IFC‚Äòs investment climate advisory will also support implementation of the recently 
enacted permits and licenses legislation, adoption of legislation on certification and standardization, as 
well as institutional reform in the area of technical regulations. In the infrastructure sector, IFC is 
considering renewable energy projects and exploring opportunities in waste, transport, and IT services 
as well as trying to promote Transaction Advisory work to support structuring PPP transactions and 
developing proper transparent mechanisms of attracting private sector financing. IFC is aiming to 
improve Ukraine‚Äòs energy efficiency in a cross-cutting investment effort, complemented by advisory 
services on Cleaner Production, Residential Energy Efficiency, and Sustainable Energy Finance. 

71. 
In the context of deteriorating investment climate in Ukraine, IFC intends to adopt a more 
cautious stance in selecting prospective clients and estimating the amount of financing it will be 
able to provide. Historically, IFC‚Äòs levels of investment have consistently fallen short of what would 
have been expected based on the market potential. Efforts to increase investments were impeded by 
slow progress of key reforms, administrative market interventions (such as grain quotas and their non-
transparent allocation, export duties and selective domestic price interventions, and legislative 
proposals that would create an uneven playing field in the grain market) and by governance concerns 
that required IFC to exercise greater selectivity in choosing clients. IFC is ready to invest in Ukraine 
and would like to increase its annual commitments to approximately USD 400 million. However, this 
would only be possible if (i) reforms to improve investment climate remain on track; (ii) IFC can find 
clients that meet its reporting and transparency standards; (iii) IFC can provide local currency financing 
in Ukraine; and (iv) public procurement legislation is amended to allow IFC to provide sub -national 
financing. Barring these changes, IFC‚Äòs investments are likely to stay at the historical levels of USD 
200-300 million per year.   

i. 
Pillar 1: Improving public services and public finances:  support to building relations with 
citizens 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
72. 
 Work under the first pillar would demonstrate how open dialogue in reform formulation, 
accountability in implementation of policies, and transparency in the monitoring of their impact 
can yield better development results.  The Bank‚Äòs efforts will be targeted at achieving improvements 
in three main areas: (i) fiscally responsible and sustainable budget revenues and expenditures; (ii) 
service delivery efficiency in health and education, and targeted social assistance ( iii) provision of 
municipal services (water, sanitation, heating).  The WBG will finance investments in public sector 
infrastructure, work on setting up improved monitoring mechanisms and strengthening governance of 
public service providers, while supporting intensified dialogue between the government and civil 
society in key policy areas such as pension reform, health care reform, district heating and public 
procurement. 

Result Area 1: Improved governance of public finances 

73. Outcome 1: Strengthened operational efficiency and 
transparency of PFM. 
 Despite 
improvements in PFM systems over last decade, some persistent weaknesses need to be addressed.  
They include the weak link between policy objectives and budget allocations and the lack of integrated 
expenditure and revenue data and analysis for timely decision making.  The PFM project under 
implementation will help address these problems by: (i) helping to elaborate an operational medium-
term budget framework, and (ii) establishing an integrated management and information platform to 
improve data access to decision makers with an expected 20 percent reduction in time required to obtain 
information for managerial decisions. 

74. 
 Outcome 2: Increased transparency in public procurement (PP).  Given that around 80 percent of 
the budget is comprised of wages and transfers to the population, most governance concerns are focused 
on the public procurement system, which covers around 12-15 percent of public spending in a given 
year.  Policy dialogue will build on the progress already made.  After the significant progress achieved 
in 2010-11, the focus will be on completing some final pieces of the legal and regulatory framework (in 
partnership with the EC) and building a public performance monitoring platform.  Through public data 
and information on public purchases, the monitoring platform will enable civil society to monitor the 
performance of public procurement and hold officials accountable.  Over time, this would help to 
improve competition and transparency in the PP system. 

75. Outcome 3: Improved efficiency of capital expenditures.  According to 2011 PEFA, capital 
budgeting practices remains one of the weakest PFM areas.  Capital expenditures represent around 5 
percent of the budget in a given year.  The Bank‚Äòs advice on fiscal policy has been to create fiscal space 
for needed infrastructure investments to support private sector growth (doing so while maintaining a 
prudent stance on the deficit and gradually reducing the size of the general budget). But to make this 
policy efficient, the process of capital budgeting needs to be improved.  Currently, investment planning 
is detached from national strategic planning, project evaluation and selection processes are weak (or ad 
hoc in many cases), multi-year investments and implementation costs are not always factored in the 
budget, and asset management and maintenance require significant improvements.  Building on 
previous analytical work and technical assistance the Bank will continue to support the improvements 
of capital budgeting and help to enlarge the share of investment projects that go through an enhanced 
process of evaluation and selection. 

76. Outcome 4: Improved governance in the energy sector.  The Bank, through the EC-funded trust 
fund, will assist Naftogaz in preparation and implementation of modernization projects in the gas transit 
system; assist the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industries with gas market reforms and adoption of an 
Action Plan for Naftogaz restructuring and an update of Energy Strategy until 2030. Through a joint 
work with IMF, EBRD, European Investment Bank (EIB), and with the EC supporting policy measures, 
the Bank will continue to advocate for energy sector reforms.  In particular, the donors expect Ukraine 
to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and to reduce the price distortions in the 
gas, electricity and heating sectors (the Government has expressed its commitment to join EITI though 
the progress is slow).   

19 

 
 
 
 
 
77. Outcome 5: Implemented Pension Reform Law and sustainability of the Pension Fund improved.  
Dialogue on pension reform will continue to be focused on the fiscal sustainability of the pension 
system.   Following policy dialogue between the Bank, the IMF and the authorities, in September 2011, 
a key pension reform law was enacted, that increases the retirement age for women and extends the 
contribution period.  The Bank will continue its policy dialogue throughout the implementation period 
of this Law and will advise on measures needed to secure long-term sustainability of the pension 
system. 

Result Area 2: Improved efficiency of social expenditures 

78. Outcome 6: Improved efficiency of spending in health and education.  While the health and 
education systems absorb a significant share of total government resources the efficiency and quality of 
services have been declining.  To improve the government efficiency in public spending, both in health 
and education, the Bank will assist in building the analytical capacity for managing public expenditures 
using the BOOST tool.  In the health sector the Bank will support the pilot phase of the renewed reform 
in three oblasts and Kyiv, with potential for the Bank project in the second half of the CPS.  Results at 
the pilot level will be measured by reduction in the length of stay in hospital, increase in the number of 
cases treated at the primary care and outpatient level, reduction of unnecessary hospital admissions, 
reductions in informal payments, and reductions in the number of hospital beds.  

79. Outcome 7: Improved efficiency and equity of social safety net .  The Bank will build on the 
existing Social Assistance Systems Modernization Project aimed at improving targeting of the social 
protection programs and better protection of the poor.  The project has helped to build new models for 
local welfare offices by increasing efficiency of the social assistance administration.  Improvements in 
the targeting accuracy of social assistance, revised eligibility criteria of means tested programs and the 
rationalization of multiple social benefits programs have yet to materialize and will continue to be a 
focus of the CPS.  In particular, a new means-testing instrument, developed under the Project to 
improve overall social assistance targeting, is slated for introduction in 2012. The Bank has launched 
preliminary work on a new lending operation to scale up social assistance programs. 

Result Area 3: Improved efficiency, quality and governance of municipal infrastructure services 

80. Outcome 8: Improved energy efficiency of targeted municipal water utilities .  The main 
challenges in the water supply and sanitation are associated with cost recovery tariffs too low to cover 
operation and maintenance costs and undertake investments.  The Urban Infrastructure Project (UIP) 
supports two of the government‚Äòs priorities: (i) energy efficiency; and (ii) quality of the urban water 
supply and wastewater services. In particular, energy efficiency investments in fifteen utilities under the 
UIP are expected to reduce the total energy consumption of participating utilities by 15 percent. The 
planned Gas Sector Efficiency and Modernization project and the Energy Efficiency project will 
improve energy efficiency of district heating companies.  

81. Outcome 9: Increased transparency and accountability of municipal service provision .  Quality 
and responsiveness of municipal services, including water and sanitation and district heating, are 
particularly vulnerable to lack of transparency and accountability of service providers.  Strengthening 
the demand for good governance at the municipal level is a promising platform for strengthening 
transparency and responsiveness across a range of services.  Bank will examine the framework for 
improved governance in the water and sanitation sector through assessing entry points and developing a 
road map for improved governance.  The Bank will advise on implementation of a sector information 
system based on benchmarked performance indicators. The Bank will also assist in building the 
capacity of the newly created communal service regulator. 

ii. 
Pillar 2: Improving policy effectiveness and economic competitiveness: support to building 
relations with businesses 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
  
82. 
 Improvement in the business climate is the key to unlocking Ukraine‚Äôs economic potential 
and achieving greater competitiveness. 
 This pillar will support 
implementation of 
the 
recommendations of analytical and diagnostic work undertaken during the previous CPS.  The expected 
outcomes will focus on (1) friendliness, sustainability and predictability of the business environment, 
for both domestic and foreign investors, (2) improving infrastructure to reduce the cost of doing 
business, and (3) comprehensive reform of the agricultural sector to allow Ukraine to benefit from high 
international demand for food and agricultural commodities. The authorities have further requested 
assistance in better utilizing Ukraine‚Äòs innovation and industrial potential, embodied in a strong 
scientific and machine building tradition and growing potential in the outsourcing of digital services. 
While important, the Bank‚Äòs assistance in this pillar will focus first on tackling first order constraints in 
the business climate and the scope for broadening support to other areas will be reviewed at mid -term. 

Result Area 4: Improving business regulatory environment for a more competitive and diversified 
economy 

83. Outcome 10: Reduced regulatory burden on enterprises.  Despite progress in reducing the burden 
of the regulatory framework, barriers to business entry, operation and exit remain high.  Ukraine ranks 
152th out of 183 countries on the ease of starting a new business (2012 Doing Business Survey).  IFC 
will support implementation of the recently enacted permits and licenses legislation (prepared in the 
previous CPS under the WBG advice), adoption of legislation on certification and standardization as 
well as technical assistance to advance institutional reform in the area of technical regulations.  The 
Government has expressed interest in engaging Indicator-Based Reform Advisory unit of the WBG to 
focus its efforts on improving investment climate through the use of regular SME surveys to measure 
reform effectiveness and improve accountability. The shift to sampling in statistical surveys rolled out 
nation-wide as part of the Additional Financing provided for the State Statistics Development Project 
would reduce compliance costs for companies and improve the timeliness of key national business 
statistics. 

84. Outcome 11: Reduced tax compliance costs.  Improving tax administration is critical given the 
burden of costs of compliance and tax inspections.  The Bank will continue its engagement through the 
ongoing State Tax Service Modernization Project (STSMP). Under this project the Bank supports 
implementation of the Government‚Äòs tax service modernization program aimed at improving efficiency 
of tax administration and fostering voluntary compliance. It includes improved taxpayers‚Äò access to 
information with the establishment of a centralized Call Center by the State Tax Service (STS) and the 
expansion of e-filing.    The implementation of the Tax Block and Document Management systems will 
be a milestone and will allow the STS to operate a modern IT platform, centralize operations and 
considerably reduce the number of tax inspections.  The Bank will also continue policy dialogue on 
improving VAT refunds administration.  The introduction of automated VAT refunds and an electronic 
register of VAT invoices that simplifies the process of verifying tax liabilities and tax credit claims as 
well as identifying potential tax avoidance schemes became important improvement in tax 
administration.  These developments, if properly implemented, should decrease the compliance costs 
for taxpayers and reduce the workload for tax inspectors.  

85. Outcome 12: Increased access to medium and long-term finance for export.  While traditional 
export industries have reasonable access to medium and long-term financing, access is still limited for 
smaller exporting firms.  The Second Export Development Project (EDP-2) credit line, strengthened in 
FY12 with additional financing, will continue to support export growth and diversification through 
provision of long-term investment and working capital loans to a diverse pool of established and new 
exporters.  The credit line, channeled through Ukrexim Bank to eligible exporters directly or through 
other participating banks, will result in new incremental exports, a more stable source of funding, new 
export sectors and wider export geography.  It will also contribute to better credit assessment skills in 
participating banks and to the financial and institutional strength of Ukrexim Bank.  

86. Outcome 13: Increased stability of the financial system.  The financial system in Ukraine is still 
dominated by an insufficiently regulated and supervised banking sector.  The WBG will continue 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
providing technical assistance and advisory services (potentially supported with policy lending as part 
of the calibrated 2012-2015 CPS approach).  Areas of collaboration will include macro and micro-
prudential and market conduct regulation and supervision (including consolidated supervision, Basel 3, 
consumer protection, regulatory architecture), crisis preparedness and resolution (including 
development of the DGF as the bank resolution agency), defining the role of the state in the financial 
sector and supporting the state‚Äòs exit from recapitalized banks, and achieving a better balanced mix of 
funding for the economy from the banking sector as well as the capital markets .  Given heightened 
international market risks, the continued focus will be on banking sector stability and enhancing system 
preparedness for response to crisis if needed.  IFC‚Äòs Financial Markets Crisis Management Project will 
continue to work on the establishment of an operating distressed asset market and on improving the risk 
management in the financial sector. 

Result Area 5: Improving infrastructure for business activities 

87. Outcomes 14: Improved energy efficiency in the public and private sectors.  The Energy 
Efficiency project will address energy efficiency through Ukrexim Bank‚Äòs credit lines for improving 
energy efficiency in the industrial enterprises and municipalities.  Depending on progress in sectoral 
reforms, the Bank may consider, together with the EBRD and EIB, financing a Gas Sector Efficiency 
and Modernization project, which would target efficiency improvements of the gas transport network, 
in particular, through network and compressor rehabilitation, or reducing gas consumption by 
households through the installation of building-level meters and building-level substations combined 
with consumption-based billing.  IFC will contribute to this outcome through the Cleaner Production 
Advisory Project, the Sustainable Energy Finance Project, and the Residential Energy Efficiency 
Project, as well as direct real sector investments and targeted credit lines for energy efficiency 
improvements through financial intermediaries. 

88. Outcome 15: Improved performance of power sector.  The Bank has been addressing the 
problems of aging assets, outdated technologies, below cost-recovery pricing for households, and non-
payments from district heating companies by supporting the implementation of the governmental 
Energy Sector Reform and Development Program.  The Bank‚Äòs Hydropower Rehabilitation Project has 
assisted to increase regulatory capacity, efficiency and safety of hydroelectric plants, identification of  
long-term development priorities in the energy sector, and development of a new model of the 
wholesale electricity market.  The Power Transmission Project, launched in FY09, aims to improve 
reliability and quality of power supply through the rehabilitation of transmission substations and 
strengthening of the power transmission network.  The project also improves institutional capacity and 
technical capabilities of transmission system operator, UkrEnergo, to assure secure and reliable 
operation of the high voltage power grid, and contribute to the opening of the electricity market. A 
follow-on project (PTP2) is envisaged. 

89. Outcome 16: Improved road connectivity and safety.  The Bank will continue to support 
connectivity to key markets through investments in modernization of road networks and improving road 
safety.  The Roads and Safety Improvement Project finances rehabilitation to European standards of 
126 km section of the important transport artery Kyiv-Kharkiv.  The Project also supports elimination 
of high-risk ‚Äïaccident black-spots‚Äñ throughout the Ukraine‚Äòs road network, and provides technical 
assistance to the Road Agency to strengthen its capacity in road management and maintenance.  The 
Second Road and Safety Improvement Project to upgrade the next section of the Kyiv-Kharkiv road 
(from Lubny to Poltava) and improve road safety is under preparation. If requested, the Bank could 
consider supporting this important sector through additional road modernization projects.   

90. Outcome 17:  Private participation in the transport sector. IFC‚Äòs Public-private Partnership (PPP) 
Transaction Advisory Services will focus on the transport sector and municipal services aiming to bring 
to financial closure at least one pilot PPP project in transport applying best international practices. 

Result Area 6: Improving productivity and competitiveness in agriculture  

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
91. Outcome 18: Increased efficiency of cadastral registration.  Establishment of a legal framework 
for secure land ownership and development of an efficient registration system are important 
prerequisites for ensuring free and transparent land market in Ukraine .  The Rural Land Titling and 
Cadastre Project is supporting the Government in delivering improved services to land-owners and 
ensuring establishment of an efficient land cadastre system.  With the Bank‚Äòs assistance, the electronic 
Land Cadastre has been established and the computerized cadastral information system will be 
gradually rolled out into oblasts and regional offices in 2012.  The Bank also supports a public 
awareness campaign to inform small land holders of their rights to individual title, as well as their land 
use rights and obligations.  To advise the Government in improving the evidence base for guiding well-
governed and efficient land market development the Bank will assist Ukraine in developing a Land 
Governance Assessment Framework in 2012. The Bank‚Äòs regional activities to improve the legal and 
regulatory framework for governance in the forestry sector will also continue. 

92. Outcome 19: Reducing the cost of compliance for agribusinesses through alignment of 
regulations in agriculture with international best practice. IFC‚Äòs Investment Climate for Agribusiness 
project will aim to improve the business environment in the agriculture sector by developing transparent 
and consistent regulations, which should create more attractive investment climate.  Specific focus 
areas will include streamlining regulations for i) post-harvest handling and storage investments, ii) food 
safety, iii) agricultural input markets, and iv) resource efficiency in agribusiness, each contributing to 
the reduction in cost of compliance for business.  Parts of this work will be carried out in close 
cooperation with the ongoing IFC‚Äòs Food Safety project, which introduces Hazard Analysis and Critical 
Control Point (HACCP) at the company level, trains private and public sector operators in HACCP 
requirements, and raises awareness of food safety issues with the broader population.  Both projects 
will jointly develop proposals on new legal acts to improve food safety -  the Investment Climate 
project will ensure regulatory quality and friendliness of new regulations to business, while the Food 
Safety project will ensure that new regulations are efficient for food safety and comply with best 
international practice. 

93. Outcome 20: Development of agri-insurance and access to agri-finance for IFC clients.  IFC‚Äòs 
Agri-Insurance Development and Agri-Finance Projects will target this outcome by aiming to support 
farmers in adopting agri-insurance as a risk management tool, facilitate increased value of agri-
insurance as a means to access finance, and improve access to finance for farmers through financial 
institutions in Ukraine.  These projects are expected to facilitate increased investment in agribusiness, 
alongside IFC‚Äòs own direct investments in the sector as well as targeted credit line through financial 
intermediaries. 

IV. 

IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY 

A. Proposed Lending and Knowledge Program  

94. 
Implementation of the current portfolio will be critical to achieving CPS outcomes.  The 
current investment lending portfolio includes eleven operations for a total amount of USD 1.8 billion of 
which 67 percent is undisbursed.  About half of the projects in the active portfolio are over 6 years old 
and have been carried over from the FY04-07 CAS.  Portfolio performance has been improving, as a 
result of joint efforts by the Bank and Ukrainian counterparts.  At present, no IBRD operation is rated 
as unsatisfactory and disbursement rates on investment loans, while still low, have risen to 15 percent in 
FY11, up from 7.4 percent on average during the previous CPS period.  The time for new loans to 
become effective dropped from an average of 15 months in FY07 to 9 months in FY08 and 4.5 months 
in FY09-10.  

95. The challenge of the CPS will be to sustain improvements in implementation of ongoing and 
new projects.  Despite restructurings and intensive portfolio management since 2007 the portfolio is 
still suffering from delayed implementation.  These portfolio problems, mostly related to design and 
procurement management flaws and repeated changes in policy direction, with many old ‚Äïlegacy‚Äñ 
projects in the portfolio, are not likely to be resolved quickly.  Also, the previous CPS underestimated 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
the impact of implementation delays and was too optimistic in terms of results.  In order to address 
these issues, a detailed assessment of implementation readiness will be a core element of project 
preparation under the new FY12-16 CPS.  The Bank will also more aggressively restructure poorly 
performing projects.   

96. The lending program for FY13-14 envisages base level support of about USD 500 million 
per annum in investment loans.  Additional Financing to the current Second Export Development 
project (USD 150 million), approved in August 2011, is the only FY12 lending deliverable. New 
lending has been identified for the next two years of the CPS.  The CPS Progress Report will propose 
lending in the outer years based on the evolution of country priorities, the WBG‚Äòs value-added, and 
progress in the implementation of reforms and in addressing governance concerns. The investment 
lending pipeline for FY13-14 (Table 3) scales up support to counterparts with established capacity and 
a proven implementation track record. It includes a repeater Roads and Safety Improvement operation, 
additional financing to the State Statistical System Development project (both in FY13) and a second 
Urban Infrastructure project (FY14).  In addition, a new operation (FY14) to support the scaling up of 
targeted social assistance programs is envisaged.  Depending on progress against a roadmap of sector 
reforms agreed between the government, the EC, and the IFIs, a Gas Sector Efficiency and 
Modernization project may be delivered in FY14.  In FY15-16, additional investment lending may be 
considered in the following areas: (i) transport and trade facilitation, (ii) energy efficiency and security, 
(iii) municipal services and governance, (iv) health services and financing, and (v) private sector 
development and competitiveness, and access to financing. IFC may increase its annual commitments 
to approximately USD 400 million if investment climate and the legislative environment improve. In 
the absence of these changes, IFC‚Äòs investments are likely to stay at the historical levels of USD 200 -
300 million per year.

97. The Bank program will build on strong diagnostic work and knowledge transfer, with a 
focus on building a more participatory approach regarding policies and actions to tackle key 
structural challenges (Table 4).  Focus for AAA engagement will be on advice in key policy areas 
such as fiscal, tax, and PFM; agriculture, land and business regulations, SOEs governance.  A number 
of TA activities will continue from the previous CPS to support the dialogue in sectors and build the 
basis for possible new lending and will include the financial sector, energy efficiency and governance 
(district heating and/or gas sector modernization), and social reforms (social assistance and health care).  
Several TA activities will support dialogue at the municipal level, in particular on issues of municipal 
governance and service delivery and barriers to municipal finance. 

98. The contribution of Trust Funds to the CPS outcomes and their role in leveraging the 
World Bank resources are expected to increase.  Efforts to better integrate trust funds into the core 
Bank program and ensure their alignment with country priorities supported by the CPS will continue.  
Trust fund activities will support a number of priorities under both CPS pillars, including PFM (capital 
budgeting, PPPs, quasi-fiscal activities and their reporting, public procurement and service delivery), 
24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
municipal services, health sector reforms, energy and road infrastructure. Noting that trust funds 
disburse in Ukraine much faster than investment financing, the country team will seek any lessons that 
might be applied to IBRD investment lending.

B. Monitoring and Evaluation 

99. The results matrix will be expanded in the CPS Progress Report.  The results matrix reflects 
the current portfolio and lending operations proposed in the next two years.  The CPS Progress Report 
will expand the results framework to reflect Bank activities in the outer years of the CPS. 

100. The Bank will strengthen its results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to assess how 
Bank activities are contributing to results on the ground.  The results matrix reflects long term 
government development goals in areas where the Bank is engaged .  However, as the CPS Completion 
Report indicated, establishing direct attribution between the Bank program and higher level results was 
difficult in the previous CPS.  Moreover, not all projects monitored results-based indicators, which in 
turn led to difficulties in assessment and in making mid-course corrections.  This CPS will keep Bank-
influenced outcomes attributable, realistic, and monitorable.  

C. Managing Program Implementation 

101. The CPS FY12-16 addresses implementation risk using three complementary and mutually 
reinforcing elements.  First, the CPS will benefit from greater attention to quality at entry and a more 
focused implementation support model, incorporating the lessons from the CPS Completion Report and 
the ECA Disbursement Review.  Second, the revised and strengthened approach to manage GAC 
related risks will help achieve more sustainable development outcomes in areas where the Bank decides 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to intervene.  Lastly, the Bank will continue leveraging support for reforms through strategic 
partnerships. 

i. 

Readiness for Implementation  

102. Ramped up portfolio monitoring through regular Country Portfolio Performance Review 
(CPPRs) and project by project action plans will continue.  The Government and the Bank have 
started to address jointly some of the implementation bottlenecks 
through more hands-on 
implementation support combined with stronger discipline and the proactive use of restructuring, 
cancellations or suspensions in case of poor performance.  Increased disbursement rates and a reduced 
number of problem projects have been the result.  These efforts will be sustained. 

103. To remedy systemic portfolio performance problems, such as poor design, inadequate 
preparation and excessive complexity, the CPS introduces an ‚Äúimplementation‚Äô filter.  The filter 
will address procurement readiness and realism, fiduciary and implementation arrangements.  It will be 
initiated at the concept stage and will continue to be applied during project preparation and before any 
new project is submitted for Board presentation. The filter will be also applied to trust fund financed 
activities and substantial knowledge products. 

104. New activities will build on successful projects, working with agencies with experience and 
implementation capacity.  Preference will be given to repeater operations and supplemental financing 
‚Äì continuation of work with agencies where project ownership is the strongest, implementation capacity 
has been created, and fiduciary arrangements tasked.  In case of new counterparts, capacity to manage 
procurement processes and contract implementation will be assessed and implementation and 
disbursement schedules will be tailored to be consistent with the build-up of such capacity. The Bank 
will also assist project implementation units and final beneficiaries through training activities to build 
their capacity in project management, monitoring and evaluation. 

105. A new procurement planning and monitoring tool SEPA will be launched to facilitate 
improved procurement planning and implementation of the World Bank funded projects.  This 
web-based procurement management system will provide public access to all the information related to 
the contracts for the projects financed by the World Bank, allowing not only to increase efficiency but 
also promoting transparency, accountability and compliance in delivery of the Bank program.   

ii. Approach to Governance and Anti-Corruption 

106. The Bank will follow an integrated approach to address governance and corruption related 
risks in achieving development results in Ukraine, including: 

‚Ä¢ A focus on the ‚Äïcorruption value chains‚Äñ  to identify areas where reforms could have the 
biggest impact to reduce corruption; 
‚Ä¢ Continued focus on supply side interventions to reduce policy distortions, strengthen country 
systems (in particular PFM, procurement), and build capacity; 
‚Ä¢ Scaled up engagement on the demand side to build consensus for critical reforms by working 
more closely with CSOs, think tanks, academia; and to promote information systems for 
greater accountability and  transparency;  
‚Ä¢ More upfront diagnostic work to identify GAC risks, potential entry points and to better 
understand the political economic factor which influence performance and results  of Bank 
supported measures and activities.  

107. Operationally, the CPS proposes to use a GAC filter for every lending operation, trust 
funds, and AAA engagement to examine both GAC related implementation risks and the 
potential to positively influence country GAC outcomes.  The filter will be applied at three stages: (i) 
pre-concept, (ii) design, and (iii) implementation.  The purpose of the filter is to ensure GAC issues are 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
given appropriate attention, risks are identified and mitigation measures discussed early on, as well as 
opportunities to improve Ukraine‚Äòs governance record.  The filter is not intended to add another layer to 
the internal review process, but rather as a guide to management and teams about the kinds of issues 
that should be given particular attention.  The filter thus can be seen as an adaptation of the Operational 
Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) to Ukraine‚Äòs circumstances.  

108. GAC Filter: Pre-Concept Stage.  At this stage, before WBG resources are committed, GAC 
risks and benefits of proposed operations will be identified and discussed, using a set of guiding 
questions summarized in Table 5.  This stage will focus on the most salient risks and opportunities, as 
well as a recommended course of action; for example, additional GAC or political economy 
diagnostics, demand-side initiatives, and other design features could be advised.  In some cases, it may 
be recommended not to pursue the proposed activity further.

supports? 

2. How a project is going to include cooperation with CSOs? 

3. Is there an appropriate CSOs capacity to follow on GAC? 

D. Partners 
Issues 

1. What are the complementarities with the existing engagement of the development 
partners? 

2.  Is it possible to leverage support for this activity? 

109. GAC Filter: Project Design Stage.  The project documents (e.g., Concept Note (CN), Project 
Appraisal Documents (PAD)) will be reviewed against the recommendations agreed in Stage I of the 
filter.  Task teams will be requested to report back to management on how GAC issues identified have 
been addressed during review meetings (Concept Review (CR), Quality Enhancement Review (QER), 
Decision Review (DR) or Regional Operations Committee (ROC)). 

110. GAC Filter: Project Implementation Stage.  An assessment of GAC risks and how they have 
been addressed will be included in implementation documents and mid-term reviews. 

iii. Deepening Engagement with Civil Society  

111. Ukraine has a vibrant civil society that is able to self-organize and to challenge the 
authorities, though with untested ability to constructively cooperate with the government.  Strong 
civil society - if properly engaged - can be instrumental in improving governance by building bottom-
up accountability of the government, and can be a valuable partner for M&E of Bank projects.  The 
good examples of constructive relations between CSOs and authorities are emerging in some larger 
cities of Ukraine, where directly elected mayors have strong incentives to involve stakeholders for 
better results of municipal investments. 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
112. The CPS will move from intensive but ad hoc engagement to cooperation with CSOs, better 
connected to the CPS core programs.  The new approach will start by implementing a few 
"demonstrations" of successful engagement ‚Äì either through project preparation, ESW or policy/TA 
engagement - rather than imposing a new mandatory process to engage civil society in all operations.  
After two years, the results of these "demonstrations" would be reviewed and new actions and 
corrections proposed.  For the initial "demonstrations", the following initiatives are being considered: 
‚Ä¢ Municipal governance (ESW and project preparation).  In order to inform the design of the 
possible future lending operation, a review of measures to improve accountability in the water 
and sanitation sector will be held to identify a menu of demand side governance tools and 
mechanisms feasible in Ukraine.  Selected Demand for Good Governance (DGFF) mechanisms 
will be piloted in UIP partner cities. Possible instruments to be introduced to improve service 
quality would be score cards and support for housing associations, as well public access to 
performance information. A UIP-2 would incorporate demand side governance improvements in 
project design, including public hearings in partner cites on communal services, increased public 
participation among cities‚Äò selections criteria for participation in the project, and introduction of 
the feedback mechanism at local government/ local utility level. 

‚Ä¢ Public Procurement Monitoring (Policy/TA).  The Bank will work with a CSO coalition recently 
formed to monitor the transparency and efficiency of public procurement.  The Bank will develop 
and use a new procurement monitoring framework to assess procurement costs efficiency and 
transparency, following the adoption of a key framework law.  

‚Ä¢ Improving business environment (Policy/TA).  The Bank will explore opportunities to engage 
local business communities on deregulation and improvement of the business environment. CIDA 
has expressed an interest to partner in these efforts which will build on many years of successful 
IFC Advisory Services.  

‚Ä¢ Ukrainian Social Investment Fund -2 (USIF-2).  The USIF, created to support poor communities 
by investing in rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure will be considered as a mechanism to 
mobilize communities and channel money to support priority social needs. USIF would engage in 
more intensive work with civil society organizations at the local level to give local governments a 
greater role in managing local projects and to strengthen participatory methods with project 
preparation, management and maintenance. 

‚Ä¢ Portfolio Monitoring.  The CPS will pilot an annual "social auditing" of the Bank‚Äòs portfolio in 
the context of the CPPR, where interested public stakeholders would be invited to provide 
feedback on how the work could be made more effective and result-oriented.

Global lessons for public feedback for efficient reforms ‚Äì practical implications for the enhanced 
relations between the government and the civil society 

Civil Society and Accountability: How does it work? 
Civil society organizations can play an important role in providing feedback on service quality and monitor 
performance locally, as well as help define local priorities.  In addition, they are the vehicles of collective 
action by organizing beneficiaries to ask for better services and can stimulate citizens to get politically 
involved beyond the local level and rebuild trust.  The accountability role of civil society works best when 
chains of accountability are short, i.e. at the local rather than central level, which is easier when government is 
decentralized (both fiscally autonomous and locally elected).   It requires a population that is politically active 
and genuine consultations which are followed-up by concrete actions..   

Opportunities and Constraints 
Ukraine has some positive enabling conditions for fostering accountability through civil society participation.  
There is a relatively free access to information, further strengthened by the new Access to Information Law and 
relatively strong investigative media.  The new Anti-Corruption Strategy provides an opportunity to reshape 
joint surveillance.  Moreover, there is significant experience with local accountability and strong international 
links and financial support are available to civil society. 

However, there are constraints.  The government is centralized with limited local accountability. Judiciary 
reform would be key, but is an extremely complex task requiring committed country leadership.  C ivil society, 
while active, is fragmented and dependent on funding from donors.  The population has few institutionalized 
mechanisms to contribute to  better policies in a constructive way: for example, political parties do not discuss 
policy, and there are few fora for open dialogue.   

Pilots and Scaling Up 
The practice of other countries has showed that starting with pilots could send a credible signal for reform and 
demonstrate quick wins, delivering results before embarking on systemic change.  The key is to choose areas 
where government needs feedback to do better: e.g. municipal services, hea lth care, deregulation.   It is 
important to work on institutionalizing policy debate ‚Äì create discussion fora with representatives of civil 
society and business.  The pilots could include civil society monitoring initiative for the Public Procurement 
Law; information systems, report cards, and support for housing associations for municipal services; locally 
supported investments in improved services, and others. 

The pilots could then be scaled up.  This would require that the government creates policy platforms for high 
risk areas, such as public procurement, health, education, land, business climate, tax administration, where 
representatives of the government and civil society would agree on diagnostic of problems, collect information, 
and identify leading CSOs. A national coordination committee for all policy platforms should be created to 
review the overall approach, and the Anti-Corruption Strategy reviewed and revised jointly as a ‚Äïliving 
document‚Äñ.   

iv. Partnerships and Donors Coordination 

113. Significant efforts in forming strong partnerships have been made in the previous CPS.   
The Bank Group, with the IMF and other partners, provided support to stabilize the banking system and 
address underlying vulnerabilities in the crisis response.  Cooperation between the IFIs in the energy 
sector, under the aegis of the Brussels declaration, allowed donors to agree on an IFI-EC list of key 
structural reforms to enable IFI investment in the gas sector.  Joint advocacy has also been made with 
the EC on public procurement, with EBRD and the IMF on grain quotas and agricultural market 
interventions, with USAID on transparency in capital markets, and with the UN on health sector issues.  

114. Leveraging impact through strategic partnerships will continue to be a core ingredient for 
successful delivery of the World Bank Group program in the new CPS.  Partnerships on key policy 
issues, technical assistance and advice will continue with IMF, EU, EBRD, EIB, USAID, and bilateral 
donors.  It will help signal donors‚Äò willingness to engage once there is commitment to reforms on the 
government‚Äòs side.  In particular, the Bank will continue close coordination on policy matrices under 
the IMF program and EU sector budget support.  In addition to public procurement, agricultural 
policies, and energy sector, new areas for collaboration may include public sector governance, transport 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and health sectors.  The ramped up engagement in demand for good governance activities will rely 
substantially on partnerships with other donors, as the Bank‚Äòs own resources to support civil society 
directly are limited.  Opportunities resulting from a new civil society fund now under discussion in the 
Bank will be actively explored. If the Eurozone crisis deepened, cooperation across the World Bank 
Group and with other IFIs would be strengthened further in order to maximize impact. The World Bank 
Group is currently engaged in dialogue with the EBRD, EIB, and the IMF on a joint and coordinated 
response to a possible new wave of crisis. 

V. RISKS 

115. The key risk to the objectives of this CPS is that relations between the authorities and 
business and civil society do not improve.  While President Yanukovych has publicly committed his 
government to renew trust between the people and the state, and some reform initiatives such as 
pension reform were approved after long and intensive national debate, there are those within 
bureaucracy who want a less consultative style and believe that effective government requires political 
consolidation and stability.  Should the protagonists of ‚Äïmanaged democracy‚Äñ hold sway, Bank 
activities would be limited to uncontroversial projects in basic physical and social infrastructure with 
greater emphasis on advocacy in the AAA program, but development impact would be constrained by 
the lack of renewed trust between government, citizens and business.  The calibrated approach proposed 
in this CPS is a risk-mitigation tool.    

116. Vested interests and weak institutional capacity may reinforce each other and undermine 
the realization of CPS objectives even if government commitment is strong.  Increased sector 
diagnostics, including political economy analysis, and the use of stakeholder consultations during the 
preparation phase will allow the Bank to better assess this risk. Readiness filters will ensure Bank 
financing is provided only to counterparts with sufficient capacity to implement in accordance with 
Bank fiduciary requirements. Partnerships with other donors, first and foremost the European 
institutions, will be used to leverage Bank support and provide a strong anchor that will help reform 
champions overcome internal resistance. 

117. Protracted slow growth or recession in Europe would negatively affect Ukraine‚Äôs economic 
prospects.  Ukraine depends critically on growth in the EU for export prospects and as a source of 
investment.  The exposure to European banks is high in Ukraine and Europe‚Äòs banking crisis or banks 
deleveraging could cause financial instability in Ukraine.  The impact of a renewed crisis on poverty 
and social indicators in Ukraine could be severe, and would further limit fiscal space for critical 
investments, and thus make many targeted results in the CPS unachievable even if a comprehensive 
reform effort is launched.  These risks may be further compounded with inappropriate policy responses.  
The Bank has some room to provide additional support should the authorities improve policies to regain 
the confidence of their international partners as it was in case of a coordinated crisis response in 2008-
2009.  

118. A key macroeconomic risk is that the existing Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF is 
discontinued and Ukraine is cut off from external financing.  Under the front-loaded 2008 Stand-by 
Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF (SDR 11.0 billion), only two out of eight program reviews were 
completed.  Under the successor  2010 SBA (SDR 10.0 billion), only the first program review has been 
completed after the first 15 months of the 29-month program due to wavering government commitment 
to crucial policies and reforms.  The second program review has been repeatedly postponed during 
2011. Rollover risks are exacerbated by Ukraine's inability to issue domestic or external debt and large 
debt service repayments falling due in 2012, including to the Fund.  Sustaining progress in critical areas 
such as fiscal consolidation is predicated on politically difficult reforms such as energy tariff increases 
for households and utilities, and addressing structural problems in the gas sector, will severely test the 
government's resolve, especially ahead of parliamentary elections in 2012. This risk cannot be mitigated 
effectively by the Bank, however, experience during the 2008-09 crisis also suggests that the authorities 
can and do act quickly at times of crisis to regain access to official financing.    

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
119. The Bank‚Äôs leverage in addressing policy related governance risks may be limited in the 
absence of policy-based lending.  The DPL instrument was used as a vehicle to promote policy 
reforms in critical areas such as public procurement, banking, and energy sector reforms.  While the 
Bank will continue to provide advice and technical support, without accompanying financial resources 
its contribution to the dialogue on politically difficult issues with the government may be reduced.  The 
CPS will mitigate this risk by leveraging impact through strategic partnerships.  The Bank will strive to 
be a convener for joint policy initiatives to signal donors‚Äò willingness to step up their engagement once 
there is commitment to reforms on the government‚Äòs side.  To this end, the Bank, jointly with the other 
partners, has identified a list of significant and measurable policy benchmarks that would allow Ukraine 
to regain access to DPLs.  

120. Poor portfolio performance and inadequate risk management could lead to delays or failure 
to achieve the envisaged outcomes under this CPS.  The Bank will seek to mitigate this risk with the 
following actions: (i) the focus of the CPS will be first on implementing current projects, which will 
undergo regular review jointly with the government and without corrective action or restructuring in a 
reasonable time frame, poorly performing operations will be cancelled; and (ii) in considering new 
projects, the Bank will put special emphasis on a positive implementation track record within the sector 
and re-emphasize the need for projects to have fully developed technical and procurement plans, and 
safeguards arrangements in place projects must be ready to allow implementation immediately after 
Board approval.  The enhanced approach to manage GAC risks will further contribute to ensuring Bank 
activities are selected and designed with appropriate risk mitigation tools incorporated and that non -
performing activities are swiftly exited.

Summary and Conclusions 

The Bank Group, under the 2008 CPS, anticipated supporting a reform agenda, responding to the many 
challenges facing Ukraine as it lagged behind its Central European neighbors in making the transition to a 
modern market economy.  These efforts were to concentrate on two main pillars: improving Ukraine‚Äòs 
investment climate and strengthening public policies, institutions and service delivery.  Cross cutting the 
program were governance and macro-economic management. 
 The CPS acknowledged 
that 
implementation would be difficult and risks high, given the country‚Äòs chronic problems in executing 
investment operations, the uncertain political context, and the weak governance setting.  The Bank's 
program thus called for greater selectivity than in the past, with a shift in investment lending towards 
infrastructure operations, the continuation of programmatic Development Policy Loans to advance the 
reform agenda and targeted AAA to inform the policy dialogue.  In turn, IFC directed its efforts to 
promoting private sector development through a combination of advisory services and direct investments 
in the real and financial sectors. 

The Bank Group‚Äòs strategy was adjusted mid-stream in light of the global financial crisis that hit in late -
2008.  The Bank Group, along with the IMF and other partners, provided extra-ordinary support to 
stabilize the banking system, address underlying vulnerabilities, rebuild confidence, and reinforce social 
protection.  IFC complemented these efforts by providing crisis management and insolvency advisory 
services to financial institutions and corporations, helping to stimulate trade flows, and supporting its 
portfolio clients.  This support has been largely effective in helping to stabilize the economy with 
economic growth at about 4 to 5 percent per annum for 2010 and 2011.  However, the political stalemate 
of the past years as well as lack of political will to implement difficult policy actions has delayed some 
important reforms, and the crisis has further impacted the reform agenda, especially with respect to fiscal 
measures.  Pension reform and reduction of quasi-fiscal subsidies in the energy sector have been delayed 
and the final resolution of troubled banks remains outstanding.  Against the immediate crisis -related 
pressures, many other challenges facing Ukraine have not been addressed. 

The implementation of the 2008 CPS, thus, ends with two hurtles.  One is to gain consensus on the policy 
front, given the setbacks during the crisis and the ambiguous policy stance by the new administration. The 
other is to sustain and extrapolate improvements in performance of the investment portfolio, which is the 
result of four-years of hard work on the part of the Bank and the Ukrainian counterparts.  Overall, the 
program performance was moderately unsatisfactory, with insufficient progress on several major 
development issues.  In turn, the Bank Group‚Äòs performance is judged at moderately satisfactory, given 
the uneven success on the policy front, offset by continued generation of high quality AAA, 
responsiveness, demonstrable improvements to the ongoing program of investment operations, and the 
partnerships formed especially during the crisis.

Key Developments during the CPS Period 

Ukraine has long been considered a country performing below its potential, lagging behind its Central 
European neighbors and facing serious governance and institutional weaknesses.  The period of the CPS 
started with very promising developments: political transformations were underway after the ‚ÄïOrange 
Revolution‚Äñ, a clear strategy of alignment with Europe had emerged, and the economy was regaining its 
former position.  Because of strong demand for Ukraine‚Äòs traditional products, economic growth averaged 
at 7.5 percent per year from 2000 to 2007; the fiscal deficit was a low 2 percent of GDP; foreign capital 
was flowing in; and public debt stood at only 14.8 ‚Äì 12.3 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007 respectively.  
Thanks to high social spending and the buoyant economy, poverty had fallen sharply, leveling off at about 
12 percent of households as of 2007, from 46 percent in 2002.  Among other things, Ukraine was opening 
its economy and working towards becoming a member of the WTO.  The DPL program supported the 
approval of a package of legislative amendments that enabled Ukraine to become a WTO member in 
20089.  Meanwhile, close ties with Europe were being pursued under the EU‚Äòs Neighborhood Policy and 
negotiations have begun for an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade 
Agreement.  In October, 2008 Parliament passed a separate anti-crisis legislation package containing 
critical elements of the authorities‚Äò response to the financial crisis, which was also supported by 
adjustments in both the exchange rate (departing from the de-facto peg regime) and monetary policy.  In 
addition, the authorities requested an IMF supported program in late October 2008, and in November 
2008 the IMF‚Äòs board approved an SBA for SDR 11 billion (USD 16.6 billion) over two years.  However, 
due to the lack of vision and political skill to build a coalition to implement reforms by the political 
leadership, the momentum was lost and implementation of the broad reform agenda was delayed.  
Moreover, interest groups took advantage of political volatility and important reforms faced significant 
resistance with further deterioration of governance issues. 
The Impact of the Global Crisis.  Ukraine faced a severe triple crisis in late 200810, as vulnerabilities had 
built up for years along several dimensions and macro-imbalances had been accumulating.  Markets 
reacted very quickly:  by the end of 2008, Ukraine was shut out of international capital markets, suffering 
loss of reserves and bank deposits, and encountering sharp drops in fiscal revenues and exports, especially 
of steel, its major export.  Gas imports from Russia, on which Ukraine is dependent, were temporarily cut 
off in early 2009 over delays in signing a new long term import and transit agreement.  The bottom was 
reached about mid-2009, with GDP shrinking by 14.8 percent year to year, one of the most significant 
drops among developing countries.  Fortunately, these effects where short lived with the economy 
rebounding in 2010 and the negative impacts on employment and incomes contained. 

Political Developments.  Ukraine's complicated political situation continued to confound policy-making 
and efforts to translate broad consensus on reforms to concrete action.  Constitutional amendments, which 
took effect in 2006, added ambiguities with respect to the respective responsibilities of the executive, 
head of state and parliament.  As a result, the years 2007 to 2009 were characterized by a tug-of-war 
among political factions that led to a breakdown of the then governing coalition, repeated stalemates, 
blockages, reversals, and frequent changes in authorities.  Over the course of 2009, differences among the 
Presidency, the Prime Minister‚Äòs Office and the Parliament emerged on the fiscal stance and measures on 
exchange rates, tax policy, energy pricing, pensions and wages, all part of the initial stabilization program 
supported by the Bank, IMF and other donors.  Against this background, governance weaknesses and 
state capture failed to be addressed, affecting the pace of reform.  Critical issues such as land reform were 
put on the back burner.  

Policy Challenges.  The 2010 elections brought to power a consolidated political front.  Taking over in 
March 2010, the new Government articulated its priorities for 2010-2014 which form the basis for the 
Bank‚Äòs continuing dialogue with the Government and starting point for the next strategy.  While stated 
policies are in tune with the advice from the IFIs, they entail tough choices to resist politically more 
appealing but less sustainable alternatives that will hamper competition and future growth.  So far, the 
authorities have been struggling to implement unpopular reforms such as energy pricing, increasing the

age of retirement, and resolving the situation faced by troubled banks, while giving the population a stake 
in a credible medium term reform plan.  At the same time, there have been concerns about the 
deteriorating investment climate, ill-advised state interventions such as those in the grain market, and 
persistent complaints about corruption and weak rule of law. 

The CPS‚Äôs Strategic Goals 

Relevance.  The CPS‚Äòs goals were highly relevant to the challenges facing Ukraine in 2007 and even 
more so during the crisis that unfolded in late 2008.  The Bank Group‚Äòs strategy was to continue to 
advocate structural reforms, particularly those that would improve public sector institutional capacity, 
enhance investment climate and support improvements in public finances and service delivery.  Thus, the 
2008 CPS focused on two pillars‚Äîimproving competitiveness and the investment climate and public 
sector reform.  In addition, there were two crosscutting themes - macro-economic stability and public 
governance.  As pointed out in the CPS, risks remained high, given Ukraine‚Äòs evolving political 
processes, low export diversification, high energy dependence, and the pending agenda of institutional, 
governance and policy reforms to complete its transformation to a modern market based economy. 

Selectivity.  The Bank anticipated a lending program with Ukraine in the range of US$2-6 billion, with 
flexibility to adjust to country conditions, portfolio performance, and reform efforts.  To improve 
selectivity, the CPS incorporated the lessons learned from the previous CPS.  The scope of the Bank‚Äòs 
program was greatly reduced, as compared to the 2003 CPS, with investment lending shifting to large 
scale infrastructure operations, notably in transport and energy, while directing the Bank‚Äòs AAA to core 
government priorities, namely, competitiveness and energy, and to those areas high on the Bank‚Äòs list for 
advocacy, especially health, demographics, social issues and environment.  The program was to continue 
to deploy DPLs as the lending instrument of choice as under earlier CPSs, given that that instrument was 
markedly more successful in achieving the loans‚Äò development goals than investment operations and 
provided continuity in the core aspects of the reform agenda. 

Interim Progress.  The 2010 CPS Progress Report was prepared at the height of the crisis.  It reframed the 
first pillar to deal with the macro-economic implications of the crisis and outlined the additional support 
to be provided.  It also reaffirmed the Bank‚Äòs approach to dealing with governance as a cross -cutting 
theme.  New lending in FY10 and FY11 was to bring the total lending to US$4 billion over the CPS 
period, depending on the pace of reform and portfolio performance.  In response to the crisis, the already 
planned DPL III was increased to US$500 million, accelerated and approved in December 2008.  Two 
new financial sector operations were planned for a total of US$750 million, the first of which was 
approved in September 2009.  Additional financing of US$60 million was also added for the Hydropower 
Rehabilitation project to offset problems with counterpart financing.  On IFC‚Äòs side, both its strategy and 
operations were affected by the crisis, as portfolio clients required greater support, expansion projects 
were put on hold, and financing needs changed.  Thus, the crisis reduced IFC's investment volumes but 
led it to focus on narrow strategic issues and immediate private sector needs, such as resumption of trade 
flows through trade finance lines to the banks, NPL advisory work carried out jointly with IBRD, and 
provision of support for existing clients.  The product mix for IFC investments moved to more short -term 
finance and guarantees, while IFC‚Äòs advisory programs were reoriented.  Commensurately, targets in the 
CPS results matrix were revised to take into account the crisis and what was more likely realizable under 
the changed conditions.11  

Program Delivery 

As of December 2011, the Bank‚Äòs lending for Ukraine under the FY08-11 CPS amounted to US$2.3 
billion, at the low end of the original CPS envelop.  (See Annex 1.A and 1.B for details of the planned 
and actual delivery of the lending and AAA programs, respectively.)  The CPS‚Äòs reframed first Pillar‚Äî
Restoring Economic Growth and Improving Competitiveness‚Äî received a total of US$2,110 million in 

11  A number of activities and targets in the CPS could not be realized within the FY08 -11 CPS timeframe and will be carried 
over into the new CPS.  Thus, the results matrix extends beyond the current CPS period, which ends June 2011.

new IBRD lending12. Most of this was to support major infrastructure undertakings in transport and 
energy and to rehabilitate the financial sector and restore economic stability in response to the crisis (see 
Box 1).  The second Pillar‚ÄîRestoring Public Finances, Public Sector Reform and Improving Delivery of 
Public Services‚Äî received US$190 million in IBRD support for urban infrastructure services and public 
financial management, key entry points to address governance.  The total IBRD portfolio has eleven on-
going investment operations with an undisbursed balance of US$1,172.4 million as of December 2011.  
With respect to IFC, Ukraine now represents its 13th largest client (and third largest in the ECA Region 
after Russia and Turkey), with a committed portfolio of US$848 million as of the end of April 2011.  This 
constitutes a 50 percent increase in the size of portfolio since FY07.  Over the CPS period, IFC invested a 
total of US$910 million in 30 projects for its own account and raised an additional US$339 million 
through syndications.  About 40 percent of the new investments were directed to the financial sector, the 
rest to manufacturing, agribusiness and services.  In addition, IFC provided advisory services in the areas 
of business enabling environment, supply chain development, crisis response, energy efficiency, and 
corporate governance through 25 advisory projects of which 11 remain active to date. 

Program Performance 

The following addresses the contributions made by the Bank Group in realizing the strategic goals set out 
in the updated CPS.  Annex 1.C provides a detailed assessment of program outcomes and performance 
ratings. 

1. Pillar One:  Restoring Economic Growth and Improving Competitiveness. 
The overarching goal of this pillar was to induce greater economic growth and private sector investment 
thanks to an improved investment climate, reductions in the costs of doing business, and actions to restore 
confidence. 

Strategic goal 1: Improving business climate and invigorating private investment and trade. 

Agri-business was a main area of focus for the Bank Group, playing to one of Ukraine‚Äòs comparative 
advantages.  There have been modest improvements in agricultural yields and strong export response by 
the agriculture sector, particularly livestock, offset by government restrictions on grain exports.  There 
has been some limited progress on the legislative front with respect to land markets13, and this has 
reemerged on the policy agenda during the course of 2011.  The Bank-supported Rural Land Titling and 
Cadastre project is putting in place the land cadastre system needed for such reform.  As the crisis abated, 
IFC resumed its focus on agribusiness as a key sector where Ukraine has a strong comparative advantage.  
Over the course of the CPS period, IFC committed over US$300 million in nine agribusiness projects 
across the supply chain, from primary producers to food retailers.  While the volumes of investment 
remained moderate, IFC developed innovative financing mechanisms for this sector: one examp le was a 
US$70 million risk sharing facility for a key supplier of crop protection products, another was the 
provision of IFC‚Äòs first partial credit guarantee of US$11.25 million for leasing agricultural machinery by 
the country‚Äòs largest poultry producer.  Advisory projects have focused on developing agro-insurance and 
finance, improving food safety standards, developing pre -harvest financing, and strengthening supply 
chains in dairy, fruit and vegetable production.   

More generally, there has been good, albeit far from sufficient, progress in adopting structural measures 
that address constraints facing the private sector.  On the Bank‚Äòs side, reforms supported by the series of 
DPLs have helped reduce the number of business inspections and tax audits and time spent on getting 
licenses.  Tax compliance costs, according to data collected under the Bank-financed State Tax 
Administration project, have been reduced although other surveys such as BEEPS continue to point to tax 
administration as a major business cost.  Delays in VAT refunds and large costs of tax compliance remain 
key weaknesses affecting business.  IFC‚Äòs work resulted in some US$325 million in private sector 

12  The original CPS had the DPLs as supporting Pillar Two while the CPS Progress Report had them supporting Pillar One.  The 
assignment of the DPLs to Pillar One is thus arbitrary and, in practice, DPLs have supported both pillars.  
13 Draft Law of Ukraine ‚ÄïOn Land Market‚Äñ was approved by Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on June 20, 2011 and  the Law of 
Ukraine ‚ÄïOn State Land Register‚Äñ was adopted on July 7, 2011.

savings from the changes recommended by IFC‚Äòs investment climate advisory services.  A total of 33 
IFC-recommended laws and regulations have been enacted during the CPS period, focusing mainly on 
permits and licenses, technical regulations, and inspections, as well as a law on starting a company.  
Although Ukraine still remains one of the Region‚Äòs least hospitable places to do business, due to the joint 
IFC and Bank efforts the ranking in the ease of starting the business improved from 136th place in 2009 to 
112th place in 201114.  IFC‚Äòs advisory work in the area of access to finance and sustainable business has 
facilitated investments of more than US$1.4 billion over the CPS period.  Twenty companies receiving 
IFC advisory services report improved performance in areas such as productivity, operations, loan terms, 
and valuations.  IFC‚Äòs own direct investments have improved access to finance for SMEs, supporting 
modernization and higher value added production. 

Strategic goal 2: Rehabilitating the banking sector and strengthening financial markets.  

There was considerable progress in preserving the financial sector.  From the peak of the crisis in 2009, 
the situation as of December 2011 has stabilized, the run on deposits reversed, and banks have been 
recapitalized.  Lending is slowly recovering.  However, the stock market has remained volatile, and the 
bond market has remained depressed.  Around thirty banks were intervened.  The level of NPLs has been 
somewhat reduced from the peak of 41 percent but remains higher than the level anticipated under the 
CPS.  IFC‚Äòs Financial Markets Crisis Management Program provided pragmatic advice and contributed to 
new regulations by the NBU on non-performing loans (NPLs).  There has also been progress on enhanced 
shareholder disclosure and introduction of consolidated supervision, with relevant laws enacted in 2010-
1115.  Nevertheless, challenges remain for the medium-term, especially on how to deal with troubled 
assets, problem bank resolution reform, exit of the state from intervened banks, and adoption of coherent 
strategy for financial sector development and state‚Äòs role in the sector.  The share of majority state owned 
banks has not been reduced, the result of the Government‚Äòs steps to contain the crisis by recapitalizing 
banks under stress with public funds. 

Strategic Goal 3: Ensuring Energy Security and Improving Energy Efficiency.   

With respect to energy security and efficiency, there have been both setbacks and advances.  A major 
setback has been the Government‚Äòs decision not to increase gas tariffs between 2006 and 2010 apart from 
a one-time nominal increase of 50 percent in 2010.  As a result, rebalancing of tariffs, to encourage cost 
recovery from domestic users, has not been realized during this CPS period as the Government needs 
more time to ease these price increases on retail consumers.  Significant progress in the reduction of the 
quasi fiscal deficit was made until the end of 2009.  However, with higher import gas price in 2009 and 
2010 the quasi fiscal deficit increased to 2.7 percent of GDP by the end of 201016.  Greater competition in 
the electricity sector has also not been forthcoming and some anticipated operational improvements have 
been delayed in part because of slow implementation of Bank-supported investments.  This equally 
applies to gains in energy efficiency:  although energy consumption has decreased, energy intensity has 
remained stable because of the rapid contraction of the economy in 2008.  Reducing energy intensity will 
take more time as the new IBRD Energy Efficiency loan was only recently approved.  IFC has approved 
and fully disbursed its first Energy Efficiency loan before the crisis and launched three new advisory 
programs in 2010 to promote sustainable energy finance, residential energy efficiency, and cleaner 
production.  At the same time, Ukraine over the CPS period has made a commitment to ensuring energy 
security by joining the European Energy Commission, beginning to reform some of its domestic 
legislation to comply with European standards, moving to a price formula based on long-term contracts 
for gas imports from Russia, and developing a reform plan of the gas sector that could unlock financing 
from the IFIs and commercial sources for modernization. 

Strategic Goal 4: Reduce costs of trade to support export led recovery.

15  The following laws were adopted to ensure these developments: ‚ÄïOn amending certain laws of Ukraine concerning regulation of  
banking operations‚Äñ (#3024-V–Ü, became effective on 16.05.2011) and ‚ÄïOn amending certain laws of Ukraine concerning 
consolidated supervision‚Äñ (#3394-VI, adopted 19.05 2011). 
16 This estimate is based on the weighted average cost of cheap (well below import price) domestically-produced gas and imports 
from Russia. It also does not account for full potential economic costs.

The last area under the first pillar deals with reducing trade costs and spurring export led recovery.  A 
major milestone was reached during the CPS period with Ukraine becoming a member of the WTO in 
May 2008, with the enactment of critical pieces of legislation required for WTO accession supported by 
DPL 2.  This has been complemented by specific measures under the CPS and, indeed, there is evidence 
that the recovery has been export led.  IFC‚Äòs support has contributed to the resumption of trade flows, 
with US$150 million provided to local banks through the Global Trade Finance Program.  IFC‚Äòs loans to 
the agri-business sector have also helped to expand the operations of export-oriented companies, although 
trade bans on grains created serious challenges during 2010-11.  While a new PPP framework law was 
adopted, the framework remains untested and the obstacles related to procurement, the lack of suitable 
clients that meet IFC criteria, and the regulatory risks have prevented IFC from being more active in the 
infrastructure and sub-national sectors.  On inter-connectivity, there is progress under Bank supported 
operation in the transport sector, albeit slower than anticipated, but work on modernizing Ukraine‚Äòs 
railway system was dropped due to the lack of agreement on governance reforms. 

2.  Pillar Two:  Public Finances and Public Sector Reform and Improved Service Delivery 

This pillar aiming at reordering the public finances, suffered a severe set-back during the crisis as 
revenues dropped sharply, costs increased as a result of the currency devaluation, and a number of 
anticipated reforms did not materialize.  Structural measures to secure public finance sustainability 
remained incomplete.  While some progress on reducing the deficit has been achieved, deeper fiscal 
reforms need to be taken to restore sustainability to public finances. 

Strategic Goal 5: Fiscal reform to secure stability and enable a sustained recovery. 

The crisis exacerbated an already difficult situation in pension spending, as pension payments jumped to 
18 percent of GDP in 2010.  This is also the case of increasing the rate of cost recovery for gas and 
heating.  Although the Government has made efforts to increase tariffs with interim adjustments, these 
had been set back by the effects of the crisis on personal incomes and the need to ease increases on retail 
consumers.  Tax policy has improved marginally, with excise taxes raised but exemptions not reduced.   

Strategic Goal 6: Improved Efficiency in Service Delivery. 

New models for operating local welfare offices, supported by the Bank, have been put in place, with the 
processing times for social assistance applications reduced in line with CPS expectations.  However, 
improvements to targeting social assistance, means testing and rationalizing the array of benefit programs 
slipped to the next CPS period.  Expectations for improving social insurance administration were scaled 
down and the accompanying investment operation dropped.  Most of the original strategic goals for 
improvements on the quality and access of education and health service delivery have not been realized, 
as investment operations in these sectors have fallen short in yielding the desired results.  The lack of 
progress on the investment front has been offset, but only in part, by actions under DPLs to strive for 
greater efficiency in budget allocations and teacher-student ratios and by AAA to advocate for greater 
public awareness to public expenditure and service quality.  There has been a good start made in 
improving the quality of municipal services, albeit on a limited scale, under the Urban Infrastructure 
project, but the specific targets contained in the CPS on improvement to municipal services were out of 
sync with the scope and timing of the support being provided as it was too early to expect to see concrete 
results. 

Strategic Goal 7: Improved Governance and Accountability 

Improvements to governance and accountability in service delivery and public finances figured 
prominently in the CPS.  Progress was largely to be measured by Ukraine‚Äòs PEFA ratings, with particular 
goals to increase the alignment of budget allocations and national priorities, transparency, accountability, 
auditing, and tax administration.  The conclusions from the preliminary 2011 repeat PEFA assessment 
show that progress has been made across the board, as compared to 2006, although the improvements fall 
short of those anticipated under the CPS.  A new Procurement Law was passed in July 2010.  In July 
2011 amendments were passed (Law 3861), which further improved the system by introducing 
framework agreements, increasing accountability for use of non-competitive procedures, and reiterating 
requirement to pass parallel legislation governing procurement of utilities and by utility companies.  At 

37 

 
 
 
 
the same time, however, while the framework has improved, implementation remains a challenge .  In the 
education sector, there has been limited progress, with external assessments adopted and improvements to 
rural student-teacher ratios realized on a pilot basis.  In health, the modest goals set under the CPS‚Äî
increased awareness of primary health risks and capacity to deal with environmental health risks at the 
municipal level‚Äîhave likely been achieved, supported by AAA and an IDF grant, respectively. 

3.  Cross-Cutting Theme:  Governance and Anti-Corruption 

Building on the diagnostics done for the CPS, the CPS laid out a multi -faceted program for dealing with 
governance, cutting across the entire program.17  Recognizing political constraints and state capture in 
Ukraine, the CPS approached governance through selective entry points and using multiple instruments.  
The two key entry points were public financial management and municipal service delivery.  In terms of 
instruments, both investment operations and DPLs were deployed:  for example, DPLs have helped to 
reduce business inspections and audits, reform permit and licensing systems to narrow the ambit in which 
corruption can flourish and efforts to make budgets and subsidies more transparent were supported by the 
PFM and State Tax Services Modernization projects.  Furthermore, supply-side mechanisms used in 
Bank-financed operations to ensure sound fiduciary controls have been effective and ongoing operations 
do not seem to confront any new or heightened risks.  But, these gains fall short of what it would take to 
address Ukraine‚Äòs pervasive governance weaknesses.  Moreover, the Bank‚Äòs interventions have been 
mainly on the supply side: the possible scaling up of the pilot People‚Äòs Voice did not occur and the 
planned Judicial Reform operation was dropped. 

Since the CPS did not establish any singular target on governance, proxies help to gauge where Ukraine 
stands overall.  The World Bank-EBRD Survey of Business Environment and Enterprise Performance 
Survey (BEEPS)18  show that perceptions have deteriorated across most dimensions since 2005.  This 
trend was also evident in Transparency International‚Äòs Corruption Perception Index:  in 2007, Ukraine 
was ranked 118th out of 179 countries; in 2010, 134th out of 178 countries; and in 2011 152nd out of 182 
countries19.  Similarly, the World Bank‚Äòs Worldwide Governance Indicators puts Ukraine in the lower 
range of its comparators.  The results for 2010, as compared to 2008 and 2005 , show reversal on key 
governance indicators.  Taken together, these data paint a disappointing picture with respect to progress 
on governance. 

The Bank Group‚Äôs Performance 

Design of the Strategy 

The 2008 CPS reflected a thoughtful process of retrospection of what was achieved and what did not 
work during the previous CPS for 2003 to 2007.  The goals set under the current CPS were relevant to the 
challenges facing Ukraine, and by and large aligned with the Government‚Äòs core priorities, 
notwithstanding the frequent changes in leadership.  The CPS was more selective than past CPSs, 
ratcheting down expectations of what could be achieved and narrowing focus to five themes‚Äîenergy, 
trade, tax, PFM, and transport‚Äîthat constituted the common denominators in programs articulated by 
changing governments.  Areas in which there was less of a consensus as to the path for reform were to be 
addressed in a more opportunistic way via advocacy efforts, particularly AAA and other non -lending 
tools.  The CPS was also more modest than in the past, recognizing that the political context was not 
conducive for the government to take on ‚Äïbig ticket‚Äñ items.  This realistic stance was also followed during 
the crisis, with efforts geared towards stabilizing the situation, and not trying to use the crisis as an 
opportunity for far-reaching reforms.  The downside of this strategy is that now, with recovery 

17  Ukraine was one of the initial 27 countries identified as a target country to receive GAC support at the country level design ed 
to deepen the Bank‚Äòs understanding of what could be done to strengthen GAC in CASs and to identify entry points.  Diagnostic 
work for the 2007 CPS included a case study of the demand -side People‚Äòs Voice pilot project, a corruption vulnerability scan, 
and an update of the CPAR.  A How-to Guide for increasing the demand for good governance was prepared and stock-taking of 
the GAC work program carried out in FY08.  Ukraine did not benefit from further support under the Global Partnership Facility .

progressing, there is less pressure to take action and risks of a return to complacency about tackling 
Ukraine‚Äòs deeper structural challenges. 

Leading up to the crisis, IFC had been actively expanding its program, focusing on the sectors of 
comparative advantage for Ukraine such as agri-business and value-added manufacturing, as well as 
providing targeted financing through financial intermediaries. The crisis led to a contraction in IFC 
investments and reorientation toward portfolio clients, short-term finance, and crisis response advisory 
work.  More recently, longer term strategic objectives have come back into greater focus as the economy 
has stabilized. 

The ensuing results matrix closely corresponded to the strategic goals set out in the CPS and contained 
mostly observable outcomes facilitating monitoring during implementation.  The matrix suffered from 
two shortcomings, however.  The first was the lack of direct linkages between some act ions and the 
influence on higher order objectives.  This was most problematic in dealing with private sector 
development where the Bank Group may be limited to providing best practice examples and modeling the 
desired behaviors.  This was also the case in realizing improvements in health, education, and municipal 
services where support by the Bank was insufficient to have any material influence, or simply failed to 
produce the desired results as in the Quality Education and TB-HIV/AIDS projects.  The other 
shortcoming was unrealistic expectations about achieving results in a relatively short timeframe, 
particularly in the Ukrainian context, where delays in implementation of investment operations are 
chronic.  This is the case of operations in tax modernization, land titling and cadastre, energy, and urban 
infrastructure.  Moreover, there was an overly optimistic assessment of the extent to which the pressure of 
the crisis would lead the authorities to take decisive measures to resolve non-performing loans, to decide 
what to do with intervened banks, and to put the fiscal situation back on track.  These are all taking longer 
than anticipated.  

Risks‚Äîboth for implementation and macro-economic policies‚Äîwere appropriately identified in the CPS 
but, in retrospect, their potential impacts were underestimated and the capacity of the government to 
respond overestimated, as acknowledged in the CPS Progress Report.  In the case of implementation 
risks, the analysis of risks did not go deep enough, focusing on selectivity, but missing flaws in design 
and readiness that were identified subsequently.  In the case of macro-economic risks, the CPS Progress 
Report appropriately emphasized the risk of the political context and will to undertake reforms. 

Program Implementation 

The Bank Group has done well in managing a difficult program during a difficult period.  The Group has 
been responsive, working closely with partners such as the IMF and the EU most notably on responses to 
the crisis and on the energy sector, and has forged relationships and engaged across a broad array of 
actors in Ukraine.  Importantly, the Group has taken in stride the frequent changes in Ukraine‚Äòs 
leadership, adjusting accordingly.  Bank support for DPLs has been largely successful in achieving 
intended outcomes, especially in the case of the Bank Group‚Äòs crisis response as part of the international 
package of support (see Box 1).  

Box 1:  The Bank Group‚Äôs Crisis Response 

IEG‚Äòs assessment of the Bank Group‚Äòs efforts in Ukraine was positive (See ‚ÄïPhase I:  The World Bank 
Group‚Äòs Response to the Global Economic Crisis‚Äñ, IEG, 2010).  According to IEG, there were strong 
reform elements, operations were well designed and results measurable.  In addition, the focus on 
improved targeting of social protection spending was considered appropriate given Ukraine‚Äòs already 
substantial social protection spending.  Importantly, IEG‚Äòs observation that good analytical work is a 
prerequisite for a good response holds true for Ukraine.  Starting as a crosscutting theme in the 2008 
CPS, macro-economic issues came to the fore as uncertainties grew and the global financial crisis struck.  
This was reflected in several ways:  first, due diligence on the financial sector with an update of the 
FSAP in 2007-2008; second, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), launched in 2008; and, third, a 
specific macro-assessment by the IMF requested by the Bank in anticipation of possible macro -
economic difficulties.  Throughout the CPS period, the Bank continued to analyze and provide policy 
advice in areas such as financial sector, pension reform, energy sector and social programs that have 

39 

 
 
critical macro dimensions.  Besides the CEM and FSAP, AAA that contributed to realizing this goal 
include:  Improving Targeting Accuracy of Social Assistance Programs (April 2010), Ukraine; Trade 
and Transit Facilitation (May 2010); Improving Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Public Health 
and Expenditures Policy (February 2008); and Ukraine is Aging‚ÄîReforms Are Needed to Deal with the 
Consequences (June 2007).   

IFC‚Äòs crisis response strategy complemented the IBRD program.  In the financial sector, IFC worked in 
the context of the Joint IFI Initiative for Eastern European Banks.  The Global Trade Finance Program 
(GTFP) accounted for 40 percent of all IFC financial sector investments in Ukraine during the CAS 
period and helped to improve liquidity and facilitate trade flows. In the twelve months following the 
onset of the crisis in Ukraine, IFC provided US$110 million to the financial sector, of which US$90 
million was through the GTFP program.  The Financial Markets Crisis Management Program focused on 
increasing knowledge of best practices on distressed asset resolution, helped financial institutions assess 
risks and improve management of non-performing loans through in-depth diagnostics, and supported 
distressed asset market development by helping to create an appropriate regulatory base.  Most recently, 
cooperation with one of the local stock markets has begun to develop a secondary market for distressed 
assets.  In the real sector, IFC implemented its Corporate Sector Crisis Management Advisory Program, 
supported existing clients, and selectively invested in companies with viable business models, providing 
approximately US$100 million in new investments in the twelve months following the crisis.  The 
Investment Climate project worked to improve insolvency and bankruptcy procedures. 

There have also been notable improvements to the implementation of IBRD‚Äòs ongoing investment 
portfolio, reflecting concerted efforts on the part of both the Bank and Ukrainian counterparts to 
undertake joint measures and to monitor progress quarterly.  At present, no IBRD operation in Ukraine is 
rated as unsatisfactory and disbursement rates on investment loans have r isen to 15 percent as of July 
2011, up from 7.4 percent on average during the previous CPS period.  The time taken for new loans to 
become effective has dropped from an average of 32 months in FY00, to 15 months in FY07, 9 months in 
FY08 and 4.5 months in FY09-10. 

On the other hand, less could be done with some of the legacy IBRD operations dating from earlier CPSs.  
At the start of the FY08-11 CPS, 4 out of 11 operations were at risk, representing almost 50 percent of 
commitments.  Furthermore, despite restructuring and intensive attention to portfolio management since 
2007, five out of the six investment operations completed during the CPS period were rated as 
unsuccessful in meeting their development objectives.  Several of these were especially disappoin ting, 
notably the TB-HIV/AIDS and the Access to Financial Services projects.  These operations suffered from 
both design flaws (for example, combining what were originally two projects into one, choosing the 
wrong executing agency, or having too many components) and lack of ownership (for example, there was 
no consensus on the best way to treat TB).  They were also buffeted by the repeated changes in policy 
direction and leadership:  for example, the TB-HIV/AIDs project had seven ministers of health, 11 deputy 
ministers, and five project directors over ten years.  The program had more success with recently 
approved IBRD operations and those with longer lives remaining before their completion.  Much of this is 
due to intensive attention to portfolio management led by the CMU and the exhaustive learning review 
undertaken by QAG at the request of the ECA Region.  The QAG review, completed in April 2010, 
brought to light issues of readiness:  in almost all cases, there was inadequate advanced preparation of 
technical specifications and procurement packages resulting in delays of three to four years before any 
significant disbursement.  Of late, there has been notable improvement in Urban Infrastructure and Power 
Transmission projects.  The Public Financial Management and State Tax Services Modernization projects 
remain challenging, in part due to frequent changes in counterparts and in part due to wavering 
commitment by authorities to the operations‚Äò development objectives.  One operation, the Improving 
Access to Financial Services project, was under performing with demand for credit negatively affected by 
the crisis:  in response, the project was closed and the remaining funds were reallocated to the successful 
Export Development II Project.  IFC has also been successful at managing its portfolio despite the 
negative effects of the crisis.  At the peak of the crisis, loans to one client (accounting for about 20 
percent of the portfolio) required restructuring as this client was particularly affected by the decline of 
commodity prices and low global and domestic demand.  IFC has taken proactive steps to address the 

40 

 
deteriorating quality of its portfolio and the situation has since stabilized. Trust fund portfolio comprises 
altogether of 33 grants, managed by the Bank and IFC.  The disbursement ratio of the Bank Trust Fund 
portfolio, comprising fourteen grants has reached 49 per cent by the end of 2011.  This relatively high 
disbursement ratio has been inspired by several factors: i) the implementation filters were applied equally 
to TFs; ii) TFs follow simpler in-country effectiveness and disbursement procedures, given they are not 
external borrowings; iii) unlike investment projects, TFs usually do not have heavy procurements, which 
is the most common reason for delays in investment operations. 

Lessons Learned and Suggestions for the New CPS 

This self-evaluation of the Bank Group's activities over the FY08-11 period generates lessons that may be 
relevant for the next CPS as highlighted below: 

ÔÇ∑ Synergies.  After seventeen years since joining the World Bank, Ukraine is still in the midst of 
making its transition to a modern market economy with many enabling policies yet to be formulated 
and put into practice.  While the weight of policy reform is typically borne by DPLs, w ith investment 
operations helping to implement those policies and/or overcoming bottlenecks, all operations need to 
be keenly in tune with the shifting tides that characterize Ukraine‚Äòs policy agenda and political 
system.  This is most critical for transformational and institutional capacity building efforts, whether 
in public administration, social sectors, municipal services, or land reform.  Given that the policy 
formulation cycle is shorter than the project cycle, the challenge is to build bridges between the time 
the project is originally designed and the future years over which implementation takes place, 
overcoming the risk that projects may be not keeping up with ever changing policies.   

ÔÇ∑ Learning and Knowledge.  There needs to be continuous interaction and learning between policy 
makers and the Bank on core strategic goals as well as increasing awareness among the public.  Since 
Ukraine is still reforming and lacks a systematic approach, it is keen to learn and authorities perceive 
the Bank as a leader in that process.  There is a sense that this was lost during the crisis but, now that 
the worst is over, the Bank can revert to a learning mode, exposing counterparts to what has worked 
in other countries, providing the platform for debating how those approaches might be adapted, and 
moving policy advice from generalities to specifics that fit Ukraine.  This approach thus endorses the 
continuation of WBI efforts and advocacy AAA, as done under this CPS, to increase awareness and 
understanding and the use of knowledge instruments to introduce reforms, familiarize institutions, 
and establish rapport before launching new lending activity, thereby avoiding costly commitments to 
operations that are dropped (e.g. Railway Modernization project) or ultima tely fail because of a lack 
of common understandings of what needs to be done (e.g. TB-HIV/AIDs project).  The Bank‚Äòs solid 
work in outlining the path to reform in the energy sector is an example of the kind of knowledge 
needed a priori to understand the issues, build those into investment operations and/or DPLs , and 
leverage that knowledge with partners to influence boarder sector outcomes.  The challenge is to 
sustain such efforts. 

ÔÇ∑ Governance.  The achievements attained in improving governance under specific actionable areas of 
the Bank‚Äòs program have been undermined by the overall worsening corruption indicators during the 
CPS period.  This deterioration points to the need for the Bank Group to rethink its approach to 
addressing governance issues.  New approach should reinforce efforts in those areas where there has 
been progress and ought to update the underlying diagnostics and deepen sector specific and political 
economy analysis.  Further, depending on an assessment of the viable options, the new CPS may 
consider greater use of overt demand side interventions, likely using knowledge and analytical 
products in sectors where no new lending is anticipated, and/or building such interventions into 
investment operations at the municipal level. 

ÔÇ∑ Readiness and Realism.  As noted in the QAG review, problems of readiness have confounded 
investment operations for years.  In some cases, initial implementation plans were not realistic (e.g. 
Rural Land Titling and Cadastre project) or incomplete (e.g. Urban Infrastructure project).  And, even 
though considerable progress has been achieved at cutting bureaucratic processes (e.g. reducing time 
taken for effectiveness), project preparation still takes a formidable amount of time:  thus, the time 

41 

 
 
horizon of the pipeline planning ought to be longer than two years with support provided for 
preparation efforts, either through PPFs, grants, trust funds, and/or including in one project providing 
the funds to prepare a new one.  This is especially the case for operations, such as major infrastructure 
and those with complex IT components, which require considerable upfront technical design and 
specification.  It also implies getting into the nitty-gritty of the Ukrainian administrative systems, 
budgets, and roles and responsibilities, particularly in decentralized settings and with first time 
borrowers.  Such detailed understanding of local procedures had been missing at the design stage of 
several operations (e.g.-HIV/AIDS, Access to Financial Services, Equal Access to Quality Education, 
and Urban Infrastructure projects) and had to be acquired during implementation, with delay and not 
always successfully. 

ÔÇ∑ Procurement and Contract Management.  There are incidences, highlighted in the QAG review, 
that point to procurement and contract management being a particular bottleneck.  The lack of 
familiarity of Ukrainian authorities with the Bank‚Äòs rules has been exacerbated by: the lack of 
detailed technical specification (e.g. Hydropower Rehabilitation project);  the ring-fencing of projects 
that means works less amenable to ICB (e.g. smaller, dispersed works under the Road and Road 
Safety project) are let by ICB rather than NCB; and the need to deal wi th major IT contracts that are 
complicated by their nature (e.g. Hydropower Rehabilitation, State Tax Service Modernization, Land 
Titling and Cadastre, Development of State Statistical Services, and Public Financial Management 
projects).  Development of integrated information and processing systems requires not only high 
levels of ownership by clients, but good management of procurement processes, full use of the 
flexibility allowed under Bank guidelines for IT, and solid attention to design and contracting by both 
the Bank and authorities.  All procurement needs realistic advanced planning and close downstream 
management.  Procurement planning should thus involve a form of initial "triage", where by contracts 
that are on the critical path for execution and demand a high level of scrutiny by management on both 
sides, can be flagged and their progress well monitored.  There is also merit in adjusting thresholds to 
allow simple, low risk contracts let by NCB without Bank prior review.  

ÔÇ∑ Project Design.  Most IBRD investment operations in Ukraine have had implementing agencies that 
were first time borrowers with all of the risks that entails in terms of the lack of familiarity with Bank 
procedures and the need for careful and close monitoring and supervision.  Pas t errors in design 
which exacerbate this steep learning curve should be avoided and good practices, encouraged.  This 
entails steps to: 

ÔÉº Ensure that the implementing agency is correctly positioned within the overall bureaucratic 
structure to have legitimacy during implementation and to have the requisite policy and/or 
operational mandate.  Cases in hand:  Access to Financial Services and Equal Access to 
Quality Education projects (negative experience) and the Export Development II project 
(positive experience). 
ÔÉº Establish the project implementation unit so that it complements the roles and responsibilities 
of other units in the implementation agency.   Case in hand:  Equal Access Quality Education 
and State Tax Service Modernization projects (negative experience) and Export Development 
II and Social Assistance Modernization projects (positive experience). 
 Limit support to activities critical to realizing ultimate development goals, without non-
essential, albeit worthwhile, activities being added exacerbating coordination efforts.  Cases 
in hand:  Rural Land Titling and Cadastre projects (negative experience) and Social 
Assistance Modernization project (positive experience). 
ÔÉº Keep to one sector and/or agency at a time, given the limited implementation capacity.   
Cases in hand:  Urban Infrastructure and Access to Financial Services projects (negative 
experience) and Hydropower Rehabilitation, Power Transmission, Roads and Safety 
Improvements, and Social Assistance Modernization projects (positive experience). 

ÔÉº 

42 

 
ÔÉº Realize that, even with good design, things will go wrong.  Continuity and strength of project 
management and appropriate deployment of Bank in-country and HQ staff are important.  
Continued supervision on the ground combined with the on-time technical expertise has been 
a crucial element and often means in practice that the implementing agency is able to deal 
with ever changing political issues and trade-offs.  Cases in hand:  TB-HIV/AIDS project 
(negative experience) and Export Development II and Social Assistance Modernization 
projects (positive experience).

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

1.1 Improved agricultural 
competitiveness 

1.1 The outcome has been partially achieved.  Indicators of 
agricultural productivity have improved despite the crisis, but 
these gains have been partly reversed by government intervention 
in grain export markets. 

Bank Lending: 
DPL II,  DPL III 

1.1.a Increased productivity in 
selected agri-businesses 
(sales/employee, export 
performance) 

1.1.a livestock sales increased by 4% in January 2011 yoy, while 
decreased in crops; export performance increased in livestock  
(32%), livestock and crop fats (41%) in 2010, however, crop exports 
decreased by 25% due to the grain export restrictions. 

1.1.b Increased farm level 
productivity in selected supply 
chains: (i) yields, (ii) quality of 
produce and (iii) farm gate prices 

1.2 Establishing foundation for 
transparent land market operation  

Number of individual rural land 
titles issued increased from around 
6.5 million in 2006 to 7 million by 
2010. 

1.1.b(i) average crop yields have decreased by approx. 3% for 
grains, 9% for vegetables and almost no change for oil crops; fruit 
yields increased by 8%; productivity in livestock has been growing 
and was 10% higher in January 2011 yoy; (ii) there has been a 
tendency in agro-holdings and individual processing companies to 
implement EU quality standards; and (iii) farm gate prices 
increased by 15% in January 2011 yoy, in particular by 33% in crop 
and by 4% in livestock sectors. 

1.2 The outcome has been partially achieved and is likely to be 
achieved during the next CPS. 

6.81 million rural land titles have been issued out of a total of 6.9 
million. Land surveys, preparation of orthophotomaps and 
cadastral index maps are very advanced across the country and an 
electronic cadastre system is being piloted in Vynnytsya oblast.  
The electronic cadastre system across the country should be put in 
place within the time frame of the project (by June 2012).  Law on 
the Cadastre has been adopted, but all these are only part of the 
foundation required. The legal and institutional framework and 
efficient procedures for registering the transfer of legal rights 
between willing sellers and buyers are also needed to ensure the 
foundation for transparent land market operation.

period. Although progress in coverage has been less than expected 
in the CPS, it has been offset by significant savings to the private 

Corporate Sector 
Restructuring TA 

Despite the effects of the crisis on the Ukrainian economy, 
there are observable signs of progress in the agricultural 
sector, setting up the land cadastre infrastructure needed for 
rural 
land markets, and simplifying state-private sector 
interfaces.  However, this progress has taken considerably 
longer than originally anticipated and, considering Ukraine‚Äôs 
starting point, there is a long way to go with major policy 
decisions (e.g. allowing the sale of agricultural land) still to be 
taken.  

In general, DPLs have been effective 
instruments 
in 
encouraging policy reforms especially to the business climate, 
backed by intensive dialogue and empirical data, that have 
enabled the agriculture sector (as well as other sectors) 
improve their competitiveness. 
In the meantime, 
IBRD 
investment support under this pillar has been plagued by 
delays and bureaucratic complexities (also affecting operations 
under other pillars).  In the case of the Rural Land Titling and 
Cadastre project, the institutional and coordination problems 
could have been foreseen and mitigated through simpler 
design, 
adequate 
scope 
(and/or 
timeframe), 
and 
implementation readiness.  Instead, those risks were to be 
addressed by the creation of a number of Councils, Steering 
and Coordinating Committees, which proved not to be 
effective.  At the commencement of the CPS period those risks 
were 
recognized and 
the project was 
fundamentally 
restructured in 2009 in order to simplify the project design, 
scale down the PDO, reduce 
its scope and address 
implementation deficiencies. 
 The State Tax Service 
Modernization project also faced problems in dealing with 
major IT procurements and in setting up an effective PIU.     

Development of 
integrated modern 
systems of 
tax 
administration, land cadastre and public finance requires not 
only high levels of ownership by clients, but also good 
management of procurement processes by the Bank.  (Note 
that this same theme reoccurred in other projects with major

inspection. 

1.3.a Share of enterprises that 
underwent at least one inspection 
during the year decreased from 95% 
(2006) to under 60% (2010) 

1.3.b Decrease in time spent to 
obtain all permits to operate during 
one year from 60 days (2006) to less

from 60% in 2007 
1.3.d Government policy recognizes 
need to reduce implementation gap 
in business environment 

1.3.a  Last data available for 2010 show a decrease to 74%. 
(Source: ‚ÄúInvestment Climate in Ukraine as Seen By Private 
Businesses‚Äù).  Other measures point to progress in simplification in 
permit and inspection system. IFC work shows that US$325 million 
has been generated in terms of private sector savings from the 
changes recommended by IFC‚Äôs 
investment climate advisory 
services, of which i) US$284 million from inspections system 
reform, calculated as ex-post impact as of 2008; ii) US$4.6 million 
as a result of cancellation of certain types of licenses, term-less 
status of all licenses (with exception for those that defined by the 
Government), and the ‚ÄúSilence is consent‚Äù principle for permits 
obtaining (ex-ante 
impact); and 
iii) US$20.7 as a result of 
cancellation of compulsory certification for food stuff (ex-ante 
impact).   

1.3.b (By comparison with 2008, in 2010 the percentage of 
enterprises obtaining permits reduced from 54 % to 32 % (40% 
drop).  Since 2003, the average time required for obtaining all 
permits has gradually reduced from 103 calendar days to 24 
calendar days in 2010. The most significant reduction of time took 
place in recent years ‚Äì from 54 days in 2008 to just 24 days in 
2010. Source: ‚ÄúInvestment Climate in Ukraine as Seen By Private 
Businesses‚Äù, 2011).   

1.3.c Reduced to 22% (Source: ‚ÄúInvestment Climate in Ukraine as 
Seen By Private Businesses‚Äù, 2011).  

1.3.d.  This has not been achieved. There has been progress albeit 
from a low base.  The Law on Licensing was amended in 2009-2010 
that, according to IFC‚Äôs estimates, will help the private sector save 
approximately US$15 million.  Other laws improving the business 
environment have been adopted and/or amended including the 
Law on Inspections, Law On Market Surveillance, Law On General 
Safety of Products, and the Concept for Food Safety Reform.

according to taxpayer survey data, the share of legal entities that 
were subject to audits went from 23% in 2007 to 16% in 2008 and 
14% in 2009. However, other surveys show still high levels of tax 
audits. For example, IFC survey shows that 46% of all enterprises 
were inspected by tax authorities in 2010. 
1.4.b The new tax code reduces the number of payments for land 
taxes and other local taxes. The law on the single payment to all 4 
social funds will reduce the number of payments from 48 to 12.  
The results of the Doing Business survey to be issued later in 2011 
will reflect these achievements.   
1.5 The outcome has been partially achieved. 
It is too early to tell if this level can be sustained. The stock of VAT 
refunds was reduced in 2010 with the issuance of VAT bonds 
worth UAH 16.4 billion. By the fall of 2010, the stock was reduced 
to below 30% of quarterly flow of claims. The new Tax code, 
effective January 1, 2011, contains provisions of simplified refund 
procedures, although it is too early to tell how it will be 
implemented in practice.  However, VAT refunds continue to be a 
problem and ratio fluctuates from month to month.

VAT Refund claims for more than 60 
days / quarterly flow of VAT refund 
claims is reduced to below 30%. 

2.1 Banking sector rehabilitated 
and able to intermediate 
efficiently; key risks reduced; crisis 
costs to taxpayers minimized 

2.1.a Capital adequacy of the system 
is strengthened. All banks comply 
with minimum established capital 
levels; banks which do not comply 
are resolved by bank resolution 
authority. 

2.1 The outcome has been partially achieved.  The banking sector 
has stabilized and lending has slowly resumed. Rehabilitation 
efforts have proceeded satisfactorily.  Challenges remain, and 
there is much to be done for the sector to achieve desired levels of 
consolidation and efficiency. This will likely extend into the next 
CPS period. The final cost to the taxpayer is not yet known, but 
cost minimization efforts are underway.   

2.1.a The outcome has been achieved.  NBU intervened in about 
30 banks since fall 2008; 19 of them had their licenses revoked and 
were put into liquidation. A few banks remain in provisional 
administration. Under the new legal and institutional framework 
established in 2009, the Government recapitalized three systemic 
troubled banks in July 2009 and is now implementing an exit 
strategy to minimize fiscal costs.  All non-intervened banks comply 
with the minimum capital requirement.

The Bank Group‚Äôs response to the crisis was swift and effective 
and done in multiple partnerships with other IFIs. It put the 
issue of banking sector vulnerability on the table early and 
used all the tools available to respond. Nevertheless, given the 
political situation and the lack of a clear vision for the sector 
among the political leadership, the Bank and other partners 
were likely too optimistic in the time needed to move from the 
immediate crisis stage to the stage of being able to put into 
effect all of the actions needed to rehabilitate the banking 
system and to overcome underlying weaknesses 
in the 
regulatory framework.  

Although this was the first time in recent history that multiple 
teams 
from multiple 
institutions worked 
together, 
collaboration has been effective.  For the future, the central 
bank authorities indicated they would like to have more 
hands-on advice in dealing with banking crises and greater 
differentiation among partners.  According to local authorities, 
the Bank bases its advice on more general experience while 
Ukrainian partner s need specific country-tailored advice.  In 
this regard the advice from IFC on troubled assets, for 
example, was considered as appropriate, country-specific and

Status and Evaluation Summary 

August 2011, NPLs as reported by NBU using a different definition 
were 11.8% and have been on a decreasing trend. Loan loss 
provisions and subsequent infusions of new capital have been at 
satisfactory levels, however introduction of regulatory and tax 
incentives for banks to either transfer NPLs out of their books or 
resolve them rapidly have been slow and fragmented.  

2.1.c  This outcome has not been achieved.  As of October 1, 2010, 
the share of majority state-owned banks in terms of total assets 
and capital remains 
largely unchanged, at 17% and 28%, 
respectively. Notwithstanding the lack of progress in reducing the 
state‚Äôs share of the banking system, recapitalization by the 
Government was a major factor in restoring financial sector 
stability during the crisis. 
2.1.d This outcome has been partially achieved, major progress has 
been made.  A relevant law has been adopted and enacted. Once 
fully implemented, it will tighten requirements for disclosure of 
information on beneficial owners and banking group activities.  

2.1.e This outcome has been partially achieved, major progress has 
been made.  Legal changes have been introduced to make IFRS 
standards applicable to all financial institutions ‚Äì including banks ‚Äì 
from 2012. 

2.2. This outcome has been achieved in the case of the stock 
market but not the bond market. 

2.2.a This outcome has been achieved.  Stock markets recovered in 
2010.  Key market index went up by about 70%.  Capitalization of 
the stock market was around 37% of GDP (2009) at year-end 2010.  
Capitalization of Ukrainian stock market 
listed companies 
increased by 48.75% to UAH171.76 bln. in 2010.  Trading volume 
during 2010 was around 17% of GDP. 
2.2 b. This outcome has not been achieved 
Volume of new stock and bond issues reached 3.4% of GDP for the 
period of Jan-Sep 2010 (compared to 9.3% for the same period of 
2009) 

2.1.c Share of majority state-owned 
banks in the banking system‚Äôs  total

3.1 The outcome has not been achieved. The borrower reduced 
quasi fiscal deficit in gas sector in 2006 and progress continued in 
2008 and 2009 but due to high import gas prices and lack of 
further adjustment of tariffs quasi fiscal deficit increased in 2010

3.1.b The outcome has been achieved.  The share of inherited

3.2 The outcome has not been achieved.  There have been some 
signs of improvement but the target on competition has not been 
met.  More progress is likely during the next CPS. 
The power sector has continued to experience improvements in 
operational performance due to increased investments.  However, 
greater competition has lagged behind with delay in int roduction 
of the new model of WEM (the Law has not been adopted yet).  
According to the Presidential Program of Economic reforms, dated 
August 2010, gradual opening of the WEM is planned by the end 
2012 with 100% opening by the end of 2014. 

3.3 The outcome has not been achieved.  On December 15, 2010, 
Ukraine ratified the protocol of the country's accession to the 
Energy Community and the Law on the ratification of the protocol 
on Ukraine's accession to the Energy Community was signed by the 
President of Ukraine on December 28, 2010.  UHE has increased its 
capacity by about 106 MW (26 units) by the end of 2010.  UHE is 
continuing to improve dam safety and has finalized two contracts 
for automated dam safety monitoring systems.  

3.4 The outcome has been partially achieved.  The reduction in 
energy intensity of the economy was reduced by 12.7 % between 
2006 and 2009.  On the other hand, there was no reduction during 
the 2009 ‚Äì 2010 period, but an increase, in the difference between 
household, communal, and industrial tariffs for gas and electricity . 
The authorities have kept household tariffs substantially below

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

The Bank‚Äôs efforts in the Energy sector have benefitted from 
taking a sector wide view, and mapping out a comprehensive 
reform program, which has been supported by both DPLs and 
investment operations. This has also allowed the Bank to be an 
effective interlocutor along with other development partners 
in facilitating Ukraine‚Äôs integration into the European energy 
markets.  

DPLs have proved to be effective in targeting specific reforms 
in the institutional and regulatory environment, in particular, 
improving 
financial 
solvency of 
state-owned energy 
enterprises, reducing the quasi fiscal deficit in the energy 
sector, and eliminating tariff cross- subsidization.  However, 
the crisis has set back efforts on the fiscal side as the 
Government needs a more auspicious time to deal with the 
issues of gas and electricity tariffs and subsidies. Similarly, the 
opening of the electricity market to more competition has 
been set back due to the economic crisis and will take longer 
to achieve. 

On the investment side, albeit well laid out in terms of the 
energy sector strategy, initial expectations were too high:  (i) 
complex projects such as Power Transmission and Hydropower 
Rehabilitation require advanced work on detailed specification 
and planning; and (ii) there were significant delays on the Bank 
side while reviewing large procurement packages. (Note this 
has also been the case in some other projects.)

4.2 The outcome has not been achieved yet, but will likely be 
achieved during the next CPS. 

4.2.a. Riding quality along the 
Boryspil-Lybny section of the M03 
road improved  
4.2.b International Roughness Index

improved 
At least 106 black spots with highest 
accidents eliminated by 2012 

4.4. Private participation promoted

Legislative framework for PPPs 

4.2.a. and b. Works on Boryspil-Lubny section of M03 road are 
progressing well and will be completed in 2012. Results on 
improving riding quality on completed sections are excellent, with 
IRI reduced to 2 or lower. 

4.3 The outcome has not been achieved.   Contracts for road 
safety works have finally been awarded after some initial tenders 
were unsuccessful due to lack of response by bidders. The project 
was restructured and the scope of the component reduced. 

4.4 The outcome has been partially achieved. The Law on PPP was 
enacted in 2010 and the rest of the framework has been adopted 
in 2011. Two Output- and Performance-based road pilot contracts 
(prepared with WB support but funded by EBRD) are about to be 
awarded.

Moreover, frequent 
interactions with Bank staff and a

response to the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank 
was also flexible:  instead of wholesale lending through 
participating banks, Ukreximbank, was allowed to lend retail.  

On the other hand, procurement of smaller road safety work

sustainability.   
5.2 Fiscal subsides to the gas and 
heating sectors are reduced 
through higher cost recovery.  

5.2.a Higher levels of cost recovery 
are achieved on household gas and 
heating tariffs.  

5.2.b Tariff setting and collection 
mechanisms are improved. 

5.3 Tax policy is improved, 
including through the elimination 
of inefficient tax exemptions and 
revenue collection is enhanced 
through higher excise taxes.

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

AAA: 
PFR  and Fiscal TA 

5.2 The outcome has not been achieved. 
 Although the 
Government has made efforts to increase tariffs with interim 
adjustments, these have been set back by the effects of the crisis 
on personal incomes and the need to ease increases on retail 
consumers.  

5.2.a  The outcome has not been achieved.  Nominal gas tariffs for 
HH and DH increased by 50% in August 2010. However, as import 
gas prices have grown more quickly than gas tariffs to households, 
cost recovery has deteriorated.  Nominal heating tariffs increased 
in January 2011.  Power tariffs for HH increased by 30% for higher-
volume users as of February 2011 and in April 2011 and by 15% for 
all other categories of consumers. 

5.2.b  The outcome has been partially achieved. Tariff setting has 
improved while collection rates have remained stable. Legislation 
to centralize heating tariffs was enacted in 2010.  NERC has 
regulated heating tariffs until a new municipal service regulator 
was created in 2011.  Overall collection rates have remained 
broadly stable 

5.3. The outcome has been partially achieved.   
Higher excise taxes (mainly for alcohol and tobacco) were 
implemented but exemptions were not reduced. 

Strategic Goal 6: Improved Efficiency in Service Delivery 

The impact of the economic crisis on Ukraine‚Äôs fiscal position 
has made adjustments to social programs, such as pensions, 
more difficult. It has also been difficult to bring state-
determined prices for sensitive consumer items such as 
heating and gas in line with international prices.

6.1 The outcome has been achieved.  A standard model for local 
welfare offices has been developed, piloted, evaluated and formally 
approved. As of April 2011, 750 out of 757 offices throughout the 
country have introduced this new ‚Äïone-stop-shop‚Äñ service model.

6.1.a In 2010, the average time for processing applications in the 
local welfare offices was 1.4 hours. 

6.1.b In 2010, the average number of benefits processed per month 
per staff of the SA office was 370. 

6.2 This outcome has not been achieved. Despite improvements 
in the administration of social programs, no improvement in 
targeting has so far been made.  Nevertheless, authorities remain 
committed to consolidating programs, reducing duplication and 
improved targeting.  This could be carried forward to the next CPS.  

6.2 a The outcome has not been achieved. 

6.2.b The outcome has been partially achieved.  Presumptive 
incomes are being used. Modernization and integration of IT 
systems in local welfare offices are being implemented and are in 
the final stages in the majority of offices. 

6.2.c The outcome has not been achieved The issue is still being 
discussed and there are likely to be measures taken during the next 
CPS period.   

6.3 The outcome has not been achieved although limited 
progress has been made.  Performance under the Equal Access to 
Quality Education project was disappointing and its objectives not 
met.  Nevertheless, conditions to advance towards school 
optimization were created in 32 rural hub-schools in 6 pilot districts 
benefiting a total of 190 satellite project schools. 
In the healthcare sector, the dialogue on reforms has intensified and 
results are expected to materialize in the next CPS cycle. The 
hospital sector is moving towards global budgets in the pilot 
oblasts. 
6.3. a. and b.  The outcome has not been achieved.  Dialogue 
underway.  Hospital and school autonomy, with greater flexibility 
in use of financial resources, is being experimented on a pilot basis.

Lessons provided by Social Assistance Systems Modernization 
(SASM) Project demonstrate that progress can be achieved by: 
(a) timely adjustment for a better match with implementation 
capacity, following a rigorous assessment of the latter; (b) 
improved procurement preparation and processing; 
(c) 
addressing supervision gaps due to staffing changes (on both 
sides); and (d) accurate reporting and flagging of issues to 
management; 
systematic up-dating 
and monitoring of 
implementation plans on both sides. 

Moving forward, Bank and the government should be building 
on success, working with agencies with prior experience, where 
adequate capacity has been created and then scaling up 
sequentially. 

Continuity and strength of project management and appropriate 
deployment of Bank in-country and HQ staff is an important 
lesson.  The ability to combine continuous contacts from the 
TTL in the country office, with visits from HQ specialists was a 
crucial element of moving the SASM project forward.  

The results in the area of efficiency of public resources use in 
health and education demonstrate a mismatch between 
instruments and objectives.  Neither the use of DPLs or 
investment lending was sufficient to get a critical mass of 
knowledge and energy behind a reform agenda.  Before 
embarking on such a profound reform, more underlying work 
would need to have been done.  

The Equal Access for Quality Education project suffered from 
some design flaws, especially in terms of the role of the PIU.  It 
was founded on an incomplete understanding of the roles and 
responsibilities of local levels of government which have the 
authority to close or keep open schools.   

What started as a municipal service project, with ambitious 
objectives in different urban services, was defined by demand of 
the participating municipalities as an urban water and sanitation 
project. The Urban Infrastructure Project got off to a slow start.  
The Bank embarked on a lending operation without a clear 
definition of the investments to be financed and the underlying 
baseline work to be done.  Moreover, there was no clear path on 
the nature and depth of the reforms that would ultimately be 
needed. Nor were these reforms reinforced by the Bank‚Äòs policy 
dialogue.  However, targeted efforts at improving selected water

from a baseline of 8.4:1 in 2008 to 9:1 in 2010 

6.4 The outcome has not been achieved.  Progress under the 
Bank-financed Urban Infrastructure project has been slower than 
anticipated and results will depend on implementation of the 
planned investments related to 6.4.a and 6.4.b.  15 municipal water 
utilities have developed business plans to improve their operational 
efficiency and tangible progress is expected during the next CPS by 
the closing of the on-going Urban Infrastructure project. 

6.4.a. The outcome has not been achieved as the supply and 
installation of equipment to increase energy efficiency is in 
progress.  Reduction of energy efficiency levels (against 15% 
target) can only be reported after completion of installation/works, 
by the project closing date (December  31, 2012) 
6.4.b Not yet achieved, but progress is underway.  Reduction from 
28% to 25% is planned for Chernihiv.  Works are ongoing and 
results will be reported once those are completed and all goods 
installed by project closing in 2012. 

6.5 The outcome has not been achieved.  Quality of municipal 
services shall improve in selected municipalities (Chernihiv, Ivano 
Frankivsk, and Odessa) based on the ongoing physical and 
operational improvements, financed by the Urban Infrastructure 
project.  This is to be achieved in the next CPS timeframe but no 
baseline exists.

7.2 Increased transparency in the

7.2.a PEFA rating on public 
procurement improves from D+ to B  

7.1.a This rating improved from C to C+ mainly reflecting 
improved MTEF implementation. The project appraisal requirement 
is established by Law on Investment Activities, the new Budget 
Code legislated elements of MTEF that are used for 2012 budget 
proposal.  

7.2 The outcome has been partially achieved.  A strategy of 
PFMS Modernization is approved and supported by PFM project.  .   

7.2.a The PEFA rating on public procurement has improved to C+.  
Most notably, a new Procurement Law was passed in July 2010.  In 
July 2011 amendments were passed (Law 3861) which further 
improved the system by introducing framework agreements, 
increasing accountability for use of non-competitive procedures, 
and reiterating requirement to pass parallel legislation governing 
procurement of utilities and by utility companies.

The Bank‚Äòs analytical and advisory work was effective with 
some very good examples (e.g. reform of inter-governmental 
fiscal relations).  Even though the results were not always 
evident, AAA served as a form of training for Ukrainian 
counterparts.  Since Ukraine is still reforming and lacks a 
systematic approach, it is keen to learn.  Authorities perceive the 
Bank as a leader in that process and request the Bank‚Äòs help in 
thinking through how to adopt and adapt country experiences.  
This is now very ad-hoc and driven by smaller donors.

preliminary 2011 repeat PEFA assessment have not revealed any 
improvements in external audit due to inability of Supreme Audit 
Inspection to audit revenues off-budget funds and SOEs.  The 
extent of legislature follow up is low.     

7.4 The outcome has been achieved. The PEFA rating for the 
effectiveness of tax collections improved to C+ up from D+ in 
2006.  Note the discrepancy with the original outcome in the CPS 
matrix.   The main areas of improvement have been reduced tax 
arrears and introduction of risk-based audit. (Tax arrears as a share 
of total taxes has fallen from 18% (2006) to 5.7% (2010)).

As already mentioned above, one of the lessons is the 
importance of baselines to measure the results. Results should 
be formulated only in areas where baselines are available and/or 
baseline data collection should be prioritized. 

AAA used to increase awareness among the general population 
on issues, such as health and demographics, can have a broad 
impact.  The design of such studies should incorporate ways to 
measure and monitor those impacts.  

The strong ownership at the sub-national level was a key factor 
which contributed to the successful implementation of Human 
Health Risk Assessment Methodology which has been adopted 
in 4 municipalities. The lesson is that solid work using other 
than lending tools can pave the way to developmental outcomes 
at municipal level.

Large participation of energy and resource intensive GDP, and domination of fossil fuels justify ‚Äïgreen assessment‚Äñ of the Ukrainian economy.  

Table 1 presents calculation of the adjusted net savings (ANS) and their components over the period of 1994-2009 (as percentage of Gross National Income).  
Characteristically, Ukraine went through a cycle with three distinctive phases: from 1995 to 2001 very low or negative ANS, 2002-200 significant 
improvement of ANS, and 2008-2009 reversal and decrease of ANS.  

This pattern is different than in other comparable middle-income countries, were changes were less dramatic and mostly one directional (Table 2).

Ukraine cyclical pattern - different than in comparable economies - has had its causes both on the side of unadjusted savings (a traditional measure of 
economic investments increased by education expenditure treated as investment in the human capital) and adjustment factors (energy depletion, and 
environmental damages20).  ANS was negative from 1996-2000, largely as a consequence of a fall in gross savings coupled with constant year-over-year 
consumption ‚Äì and after accounting for natural resource depletion (i.e. energy) and environmental degradation. During 2002 ‚Äì 2007 Ukraine went through the 
phase of very strong growth which resulted in both higher Gross national savings and slightly lower environmental damages (as percentage of GNI but not in

marginal social cost of a metric ton of C is assumed to be $20 US in 1990, taken from Fankhauser (1994).  Translated into 2005 dollars per ton of CO 2 emitted, it would be 
approximately $6.69 per ton of additional CO 2 emissions. Estimates from the literature range from $4 to $70. Particulate damage is defined as the willingness to pay (WTP) 
to avoid mortality and morbidity attributable to particulate emissions.  It is calculated as the disability adjusted life yea rs (DALYs) lost to PM emissions times WTP.

Annex 4.  Assessment of Progress in Reducing State Capture and Corruption 

Due to high levels of state capture by well-connected businessmen, the credibility of the authorities with 
the Ukrainian public has been quite low and worsening. Even reform initiatives and public projects 
beneficial for the society are often met with distrust of the population .  According to a recent national 
survey21 92.2 percent of Ukrainians believe that corruption among government officials is a key problem 
in the country, but no more than 17 percent believe in the commitment of the government to fight 
corruption.  There is a widespread perception that instead of substantive changes, the government seems 
to adopt and publicize superficial anti-corruption measures with little impact, while actual corruption 
levels remain on the rise.  Also, citizens believe that most of the existing anti -corruption effort 
concentrates at the middle and lower levels of the government public servants, while high -level 
government officials involved in grand corruption remain untouchable.  There is a growing understanding 
in the government that the low credibility has had substantial negative consequences for effectiveness of 
the government.  To address this situation, the government has undertaken steps in three interrelated 
policy areas: (1) strengthening legal and institutional framework for the fight against corruption in line 
with the European standards; (2) implementing the law on access to public information to increase 
government transparency and give the public an anti-corruption tool to hold government officials 
accountable; and (3) creating an environment for the civil society to participate in the policy process. 

Legal and Institutional Framework for Fight Against Corruption.  A recent assessment by the 
Council of Europe22 states that as of May 2011, only 12 out of 25 GRECO recommendations were fully 
implemented.23   The new anti-corruption law entered into force on July 1, 2011.24  There are various 
weaknesses25 in the Law itself, including some obvious omissions of GRECO recommendations.  For 
example, the Law does not create a provision for an independent anti-corruption body that would 
coordinate anti-corruption policy and monitor its implementation, recommended by GRECO. 26  Standing 
alone, the Law will accomplish very little, unless it is properly implemented and accompanied by other 
anti-corruption legislation (e.g., laws on conflict of interest, ethics, financial control) and criminal justice 
reform.  On October 21, 2011 the President signed a decree promulgating the National Anti-Corruption 
Strategy (GRECO recommendation), paving the way for the development of the Action Plan for fighting 
corruption.  However, the Strategy, despite having been in the making for over a year, has not been a 
subject of the national discussion, is overly general without clear prioritization and sequencing, and the 
involvement of civil society in its development has been minimal.   

Next recommended steps to strengthen legal and institutional anti-corruption framework include:

March-May 2011 on a nationally representative sample of over 10,000 respondents . 
22 http://www.minjust.gov.ua/files/GRECO_report_20110714.zip .  A third round of GRECO assessment was made 
public at the end of October 2011 and deals primarily with recommendations regarding criminalization of corrupt 
acts and political corruption. 
23 Some of the remaining recommendations where little or no progress was found refer to key issues, such as making 
a clear-cut distinction between criminal and administrative procedures and ensuring that all corruption offences are 
treated as a rule as criminal offences; enhancing the independence of the prosecution services; improving the legal 
framework for seizures and confiscation; introducing criminal liability for legal persons for corruption offences; 
ensuring a legal framework on public procurement in line with European standards, etc. 
24 The Law on the Principles of Preventing and Fighting Corruption was adopted by Parliament on April 7, 2011 and 
entered into force on July 1, 2011, except for some asset and expenditure declaration provisions, which will enter 
into force on January 1, 2012. 
25 These include, inter alia: (1) no liability of legal persons (corporations); (2) no penalty for filing a false financial 
return; (3) no legal structure for freezing and forfeiture of all proceeds traceable to corruption. 
26 The state of discussion in the policy circles in Ukraine is currently about whether the new AC body should deal 
with the AC law enforcement (per OECD recommendation) and/or AC polic y (per GRECO recommendation).  The 
President issued a decree tasking Ministry of Justice to carry out the policy coordination and monitoring function 
temporarily, while drafting a law on an independent anti -corruption body.  However, discussions with government 
officials indicate that the most likely outcome is that Ministry of Justice will retain this function indefinitely, thus 
compromising the GRECO requirement of independence of such body from the executive.

ÔÇ∑ Adoption of  the laws on  Conflict of Interest, Ethics, and Financial Control; 
ÔÇ∑ Creation of  an anti-corruption body outside the executive branch of the government responsible 
for monitoring and coordination of anti-corruption policy;27  
ÔÇ∑ Ensuring that the Action Plan for the Anti-Corruption Strategy is developed in a participatory 
manner with all stakeholders including NGOs, creating a platform for broad consultations and 
feedback leading to a national discussion on the implementation of anti-corruption strategy. 

Implementation of the Law on Access to Public Information.   The adoption of the Law is regarded as 
an example of successful cooperation between the authorities, NGOs, media, and donors. The Law, 
modeled on international best practice,28 came into force on May 9, 2011, and its implementation so far 
has been relatively successful.  An independent NGO monitoring29  confirms that the majority of local 
government bodies have created special units that are responsible for providing information to the public. 
Government allocated staff working with documents and started posting public inquiries on the web.30  
Basic training of civil servants has been conducted and further training is planned. Ministry of Justice 
does not report significant problems with interpretation of the law by government bodies issuing 
secondary legislation.   However, there are several issues for concern: a/ the government has not yet 
adopted the procedures for creation of registers of public documents, which would reduce the number of 
misdirected or incorrectly formulated inquiries; b/ directives for publishing of the government 
information on the web have not been adopted, leading to currently high workload of answering inquiries; 
c/  citizens are not fully aware of the Law or how to use it; and finally, d/a draft law on information with 
restricted access is currently being discussed in the Parliament, causing fears that some of the 
achievements of the current Law may be rolled back. 

Next recommended steps to ensure access to public information include: 

ÔÇ∑ Strengthening provisions for passive access to information:  adopting  and implementing  regulations 
on the registers of public documents  and web-publishing of government information; 
ÔÇ∑ Together with civil society organizations, developing  an information campaign and training for 
general population on access to information; 
ÔÇ∑ Ensuring that the discussed draft law on access to restricted information does not roll back 
achievements of the current law on access to public information. 

Civil Society Environment.  The formal regulatory environment for the civil society activities remains 
unchanged since 1992.   The new draft law on civic organizations passed through the first reading in the 
Parliament and ‚Äì luckily - did not include a controversial proposal to prohibit foreign funding for NGOs, 
although it might be revisited in subsequent readings.  Presidential Administration has positioned itself as 
a leader in promoting the collaboration of the authorities with NGOs and developed a draft Strategy on 
State Policy of Development of Civil Society in Ukraine. The draft was prepared in a participatory 
manner with leading Ukrainian NGOs.  If adopted and implemented in its current form, the Strategy has a 
potential to make the relationship between the Ukrainian government and civil society more constructive 
and productive. Currently not all ministries and regional administrations are open to collaboration with 
NGOs in developing, implementing, and monitoring policies, some reportedly shunning civil society from 
any involvement in policy decisions.  Also, there are multiple reports that the government often involves 

27 The body could be accountable to either the Parliament (akin to the supreme audit institution) or the President 
(akin to the anti-monopoly committee), but should be independent of the executive that drafts and implements the 
anti-corruption policy. 
28 Ukraine ranked 9th worldwide in a recent cross-country comparison of national access to information laws by a 
Canadian watchdog group, The Centre for Law and Diplomacy.  The ranking included a global sample of 89 
countries:  http://www.rti-rating.org/results.html  
29 Ukrainian Independent Center for Political Research: http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/index.php?newlang=eng  
30 The government implementing agency, State Committee on Radio and Television Broadcasting, reports that the 
bodies of central government answered 73 percent  of inquiries received in the 3rd quarter of 2011 (out of total of 
6,302 inquiries; additional 12.7 percent were redirected to appropriate bodies. It is unclear what happened with the 
remaining 14.3 percent of the requests.)

NGOs in the policy process only pro forma, as an imitation of the truly participatory process, or replaces 
independent NGOs with government-sponsored structures.  Finally, some civil society representatives 
report that despite the positive change in their de jure regulatory environment, the de facto situation has 
worsened in the past year: they report  increase in control through various state structures, sometimes 
presented as information gathering (e.g., by tax administration, security services, etc).31   

Next recommended steps to adopt the Strategy on Civil Society Policy and develop a detailed Action Plan 
include: 
ÔÇ∑ Ensuring that the Action Plan includes concrete and fully costed steps for involving civil society 
in policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring (as envisioned by the draft Strat egy), and 
is developed in a participatory manner; 
ÔÇ∑ Ensuring that the Coordination Council on Civil Society Policy32 comprises a wide spectrum of 
analytical and advocacy NGOs selected in consultation with international organizations engaged 
in training and development of the civil society in Ukraine. 

31 All issues in this paragraph were discussed at the World Bank roundtable on regulatory environment for civil society in Ukraine, held in WB 
CO in Kyiv, Ukraine, on October 20, 2011, as well as at mission‚Äòs meetings with individual NGOs. 
32 Advisory body to the President envisioned in the draft Strategy to include minister-level government officials and civil society representatives.

Annex 5. Assessment of the Impact of PFM Strengths and Weaknesses in Ukraine 

The improvements in PFM systems in Ukraine that took place over last decade have helped to 
improve overall economic management at the aggregate level and to maintain a reasonable level of 
budget discipline in spite of a severe economic downturn and political upheaval during 2008-9.   A 
well established and transparent budget process, a strong centralized Treasury system and improving tax 
collection provided the foundations for this good performance. 

According to the 2011 PEFA Assessment, some persistent weak links in the PFM system have 
prevented improvements elsewhere from being translated into better public service delivery and 
have contributed to worsening perceptions of corruption in the public sector.  Despite the fact that 
Ukraine‚Äòs PFM system perform reasonably well compared to similar countries, several PFM weaknesses 
that continue to have negative effects on spending efficiency and contribute to poor perceptions 
(transparency and governance):  

ÔÇß 

ÔÇß 

ÔÇß weak links between policy objectives and budget allocations and poor capital budgeting practices 
that mean resources are used sub-optimally; 
a target driven approach to revenue collection, which ensures high collection ratios but at 
significant cost to business and contributing to negative external perceptions of Ukraine as a place 
to do business; 
lack of focused oversight of state owned enterprises, which represent a large part of the economy 
and have, from time to time, imposed heavy burdens on the budget in the form of tax write offs 
and recapitalizations;  
flaws in the public procurement system that have limited fair and open competition thereby 
undermining value for money; 
the narrow focus of scrutiny by State Financial Inspection on transaction processing and 
compliance and the absence of a modern internal audit function that would focus on improving 
systems; and 
limitations on the scope of work of the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine and the lack of a 
dedicated audit committee in the legislature, which limit accountability for how public funds are 
used and reduce the incentives for ministers and officials to pay attention to performance and 
efficiency.   

ÔÇß 

ÔÇß 

ÔÇß 

Ukraine has taken some steps backwards since the previous PFM assessment; limiting the scope of the 
Accounting Chamber‚Äòs work and exempting the budgets of the four social funds from legislative 
oversight. 

Perceptions of corruption in parts of the PFM system contribute to negative perceptions of Ukraine 
as place to do business.  The most recent World Bank BEEPS survey and the Global Integrity Index 
indicate that poor practices in tax collection and procurement are a particular problem for Ukraine, which 
scores well below regional averages.  The broad based Transparency International Corruption perceptions 
index also shows Ukraine on a divergent path from other Eastern European and former soviet countries 
(see Figure 1 below).

The recent changes in the budget code, the tax code and the procurement law offer good prospects 
for future improvements, but this depends on effective implementation and oversight.    

Medium term budgeting elements are present and evolving but the link between policy and budget 
continues to be missing. While the medium-term elements were present for several years including 
medium term fiscal framework, budget ceilings for line ministries, and, finally, the new version of Budget 
Code introduced the multi-year appropriations for investment nature budget programs, there are several 
important elements still missing and decisions to be made. First, the preparation of the medium term 
estimates should be linked with strategies and policies and the relevant objectives to be achieved. As for 
the decisions to be made, according to article 21 of the new code, budget requests by line ministries must 
cover not only the year for which the budget is prepared but also the following two years, and the cabinet 
of ministers must make a decision on medium-term revenue and spending forecasts one month after the 
adoption of the budget law by Parliament. What is important is to ensure that ceilings are respected going 
forward and any changes introduced in the following years should be based on clear rules and p roperly 
justified. 

The approved Public Procurement legislative framework is largely compliant with international 
practice but implementation remains a challenge. The key elements that are still required to ensure a 
transparent, efficient and competitive public procurement process in Ukraine are: (1) approving bylaws 
and regulations to make the system effective, including for utility companies and natural monopolies; (2) 
putting in place a monitoring framework to evaluate the performance of the system, including publicly 
available measurable outcomes (such as the ratio of single source procurement to total government 
procurement) to allow civil society to monitor the processes; (3) further approximation of the public 
procurement framework with EU Directives and investment in capacity building in beneficiary agencies 
to implement the new legislation. 

SOE oversight is weak and fragmented and requires considerable streamlining and strengthening. 
Absence of comprehensive registry of all SOEs operating in Ukraine poses difficulties on obtaining data 
and thus taking decisions in regards to SOE operations. Improvement in transparency and accountability 
of SOEs can be achieved by requiring publication of operating objectives, including non-commercial 
objectives, annual independent mode and revising performance measurement framework to incorporate 
standard measures and methodologies for the assessment of SOE performance.  

Internal and external audit functions are just emerging and developing performance audit function 
in additional to traditional compliance oriented control system is required. On internal audit there 
should be clear vision of development of internal control and financial management functions that guides 
changes in the roles and functions of the State Financial Inspection and internal inspectors and auditors 

72 

 
 
located in the ministries.  There is a need to strengthen the independence of the Accounting Chamber (de -
politicization of senior staff appointments, budget approval should be placed not under the MOF but 
directly under the Parliament), and the coverage of external audit should be explicitly extended to local 
budgets and revenues. The auditing methodology Accounting Chamber uses should be strengthened by 
bringing it into full compliance with the international standards.  

Changes to the PFM system should be designed to improve service delivery to Ukrainian citizens.  
Reorientation of the PFM system from an input-driven traditional mode to a result-oriented system, 
greater involvement of civil society and better evaluation and feedback mechanisms, in the form of 
modern internal and external audit and accountability for results are key steps to improve the management 
of public funds and the quality of services, while at the same time improving perceptions of governance. 

Overview of Ukraine‚Äôs PFM (Country) Systems 

Credibility, Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget 

The budget system is generally orderly and quite comprehensive and the budget framework is 
followed.  Budget classification is compliant with the IMF GFS 1986 classification (allowing for 
administrative, economic and functional classifications) and work is on-going to implement the IMF GFS 
2001.  Information included in the budget documentation is comprehensive, although regular use of 
detailed classification in reporting is desirable. Projects are presented by the code of economic 
classification.  

Ukraine has a well established budget process that allows for orderly consultations with line 
ministries and with the legislature.  The 2010 budget code which came into effect in the current 
financial year promises some further strengthening of the links between policy and the budget.  The 2010 
Budget Code brings about important   improvements, with the introduction of sector expenditure ceilings 
and a medium term perspective for long term public investment programs.  

The main weakness remains in capital budgeting practices; project evaluation is not systematic or 
fully objective and recurrent cost implications are not always factored into the budget.   

The existence of four important social insurance funds, reported separately from the main budget, 
negatively affects overall budget transparency.  A negative development in the 2011 budget code no 
longer required social insurance funds, extra-budgetary funds including special purpose vehicles (e.g., 
EURO 2012) to report on their budget to the legislature.   

Intergovernmental fiscal relations are regulated by clear formula that determines central 
government transfers to local governments, based on the principle that all local governments should be 
able to meet their statutory responsibilities to provide public services.   Over 90 percent of transfers are 
rule based, with the remainder financing investment projects or compensating for lost revenues.  This 
system appears to offer little incentive for local governments to look for efficiency gains or savings.  Use 
of the centralized treasury system by local governments aids and facilitates the timely and consistent 
reporting of local government spending. 

The main source of fiscal risks from public sector entities outside central government comes from 
the activities of state owned enterprises, which represent around 22 percent of GDP.  Local 
governments‚Äò fiscal activities by contrast are subject to more active oversight with strict controls on 
borrowing and full visibility within the Treasury system. Oversight of SOEs is generally weak and 
fragmented across ministries, although the main concentration of quasi-fiscal activities is in the energy 
sector, which accounts for around 40 percent of the SOE sector.   

Control in Budget Execution 

Ukraine‚Äôs PFM system is highly centralized with a focus on input controls.  The automated treasury 
system is applied both horizontally across all units of government and vertically at all levels and it does a 
satisfactory job in controlling expenditures and commitments.  The revenue, expenditure and treasury 
balances are known daily through the Treasury Single Account (TSA) with the central bank consolidating 

73 

 
 
most of the liquid resources of the government.  The TSA provides real-time data about available cash 
balances. Procedures for controlling loans and guarantees are in place. The internal controls for non -
salary expenditures are in place but could be strengthened further. The in troduction of commitment 
system that was put in place since the 2006 PEFA Assessment has further improved budget discipline. 
According to the reports of the State Financial Inspection (SFI) and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine 
(ACU), there are compliance failures (however minor) related to stages prior to payment execution and 
occurring mostly outside of central government. 

In-year budget monitoring is strong and budget reporting is possible in several classification 
formats and levels of details, and is possible on a near real-time basis.  Expenditure reports are 
prepared at least monthly and quarterly, and transmitted to the MOF. Consolidated government financial 
statements are prepared quarterly, and then annually. Budget execution rules are less stringent for the 
Special Fund, and the balances may be carried forward indefinitely if the actual spending is lower than 
budgeted.   Payment arrears have been low (around 1 percent), and further declining, indicating no major 
issues.  

Alignment of internal audit practices with international standards is still under development and is 
only partially effective.  The central inspection service continues to perform reasonably well and there is 
good report distribution, and some evidence of follow-up.  The work of the SFI is still primarily focused 
on control and the scope of the SFI‚Äòs work is driven to ensure compliance with budget rules rather than 
taking a systems review approach. 

The public procurement framework has improved markedly since the previous assessment and is 
now largely compliant with good international practice. The public procurement law of 2005 was 
considerably deviating from the good practice and distorting public procurement system by privatizing 
core regulatory and oversight functions. This law was abolished in 2008 and the new law was drafted in 
consultations with the European Commission and the World Bank and adopted in June 2010. The 
deficiency of the current law is related to vague definition of the rationale for use of non -competitive 
methods leading to frequent use of single source procedure. Attempts to further improve the law and 
strengthen accountability for using non-competitive procurement methods are underway and the draft 
legislation is being considered by the Parliament.  

Accounting and Reporting 

The Treasury Single Account (TSA), which was established under the first phase of PFM reforms, 
underpins the strong financial reporting and cash management practices in government.  Coverage 
of the TSA is comprehensive, and combined with the improved budget classification system, enables the 
treasury to produce good quality, timely in-year reports on budget execution and cash flows.   

Treasury practices have further improved since the 2006 PEFA assessment with the incorporation 
of commitment control and monitoring.  In addition, treasury has been able to reduce the time produce 
in-year budget reports while at the same time, through the improvements in budget classification, 
generating reports with considerably more detail than before ‚Äì reports are generated for 3 different 
classification structures (administrative, economic and functional) and for the different tiers of 
government (central government, local government).  

Accounts reconciliation is continuous through the Treasury system.  Budget reporting is generally of 
high quality, although some problems were noted with appropriate recording of the spending. One of the 
problems that were noted is that the transactions which may be in transit at the end of accounting period 
may require one to two months to make necessary adjustments. The size of adjustments post -period are 
not known, but this suggests some problems in adherence to treasury procedures.  

Information management at the level of service delivery units (e.g., schools and hospitals) can be 
improved even further.  While systems and processes are in place to facilitate the execution of budget 
expenditures at this level, the budget framework, rules and procedures (including the allocation of budgets 
across functional categories) are predicated on the traditional ex-ante control system (i.e., control of 
inputs) and the current system generally does not permit service units to determine how to allocate the 
resources they are allocated ‚Äì either budget transfers or own-generated revenue. 

74 

 
The public sector accounting reform strategy is anticipated to further improve the quality and 
comprehensiveness of government financial reporting.  However, the full impact of IPSAS Accrual 
implementation will not materialize in the immediate/short term as this reform will result in the 
introduction of a completely new and complex accounting regime for the public sector in Ukraine.   

Despite the on-going efforts, much work remains to be done to prepare line ministries and agencies 
to execute and record transactions on the basis of new accounting standards.  In addition, work is 
also needed to prepare functional units in the Treasury and Ministry of Finance so that government 
financial statements can be prepared on the basis of the new accrual standards.  The government is on 
track to develop and approve 24 new public sector accounting standards by December 2011 and the final 
7 standards will be approves in 2012; the government anticipates the full set of standards (31 standards in 
total) to come into effect as of January 2013. 

External Scrutiny and Audit 

While the Accounting Chamber (Supreme Audit Institution of Ukraine) annually conducts a 
financial audit of the government‚Äôs budget execution statement, this audit does not meet 
international standards.  This annual audit is primarily a compliance review and does not offer an audit 
opinion on the government‚Äòs financial position or financial statements and does not include report on the 
reliability of government systems to produce such statements.  The scope of the annual audit of the 
government‚Äòs budget statement is limited to expenditures.  It does not include audit of revenues, 
following a decision issued by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine in September 2010, or the activities of 
local governments or extra-budgetary funds. 

The Accounting Chamber has made some progress over the last several years in revising its 
approach to the audit of public expenditure.  The Accounting Chamber regularly executes 
performance audits (known as ‚ÄóEfficiency Audits‚Äò) as part of its annual work program.  Though the 
methodology can still benefit from further refinement to more closely align with INTOSAI standa rds, 
these audits have enhanced the oversight of public expenditure programs and the allocation of budget 
resources.  It is not clear, though, what impact this new audit approach has had in positively affecting 
government policy. 

Ukraine‚Äôs Parliament does not have a dedicated audit committee and tracking of hearings by 
parliamentary committees, and government responses to issues raised by parliament, is not 
systematic.  The Budget Committee and other (sector) committees share responsibility for reviewing 
audit reports based on the subject matter, but the reviewers were unable to obtain clear evidence of the 
extent to which audit reports were considered in detail by the relevant committees or whether officials of 
the relevant ministries participated.    

There are a number of areas (related to policy and independence, institutional development, and 
audit methodology) that could benefit from modernization.  At the time the assessment was carried 
out the head of the Accounting Chamber had completed his two-term mandate, but a new Head had not 
been appointed by the Parliament.  Although the Accounting Chamber has benefited from partnership and 
twinning programs with peer institutions, the Chamber has yet to develop a medium-to-long term 
institutional development strategy which would introduce modern training and professional development 
programs, upgrade audit methodology and techniques and so help the Chamber to bring its work fully into 
line with international standards. 

75 

 
 
Annex 6: Gender Issues33 

Legal  Framework. The fundamentals of gender equality are provided by the Constitution of Ukraine 
adopted in 1996. The principles of equal gender treatment and special protection for working women are 
provided in the Labor Code of Ukraine, which was adopted in 1971 and continues to be in force. The Law 
on Equal Rights and opportunities for Women and Men was adopted in 2005. The State Program for 
Ensuring Gender Equality in Ukrainian Society was approved by the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers 
of Ukraine in 2006.  

Political Participation. Among 450 members of Parliament there are only 33 women, a mere 7,5 percent 
of the total number of parliamentarians.  In Ukraine, the proportion of women in Parliament has not 
exceeded 8 percent since independence, and between 2002-2006 it was as low as 5 percent. This is one of 
the lowest rates in Europe where about 30 percent of parliamentarians are women. According to UNDP 
Equal Opportunities and Women‚Äòs Rights in Ukraine Program, there are almost 40 percent of women in 
village councils but no more than 10 percent in the regional authorities (oblast). Currently, there is not a 
single woman cabinet member in the Cabinet of Ministers. Ukraine is the only country in the world to 
have no women in its government.  

Education and Labor Issues.  The recent ILO study finds that despite the fact that the Ukrainian gender 
gap in employment rate is lower than the EU average and that Ukrainian women experience lower 
unemployment than men, the Ukrainian labor market is characterized by pronounced inequalities between 
men and women. Major inequalities can be witnessed in the significant gender gap in employment rates 
during the child bearing (age 24-29) and pre-retirement (over 50 years old) groups; a high gender wage 
gap; unequal sharing of regular paid work and unpaid domestic work; a high share of women in 
precarious jobs; and gender gaps in unemployment coverage, resulting in unequal unemployment benefits 
and participation in active labor market programs. The level of education of women in Ukraine is 
extraordinarily high ‚Äì considerably higher than for men. At the same time, wages of women are 75 
percent of wages of men, and women‚Äòs pensions are only 67 percent of pensions of men. 

Government Policies. Ukraine has acknowledged that gender balance is an indicator of democracy, 
human rights, as well as social and economic standards of development. It has backed the UN‚Äòs 
Millennium Development Goals and committed itself to ensuring at least a 30/70 balance in Parliament 
and in higher executive bodies by 2015. However, the progress is mixed, for example the most recently, 
administrative reform eliminated the Ministry of Family, Youth and Sports ‚Äì a central executive body 
responsible for implementation of gender policy. The Ministry has been transformed into the State 
Service of Youth and Sports which no longer deals with gender policy. As result, the prevention of 
domestic violence, human trafficking and ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women and men is 
no longer part of its portfolio.

Annex 7. CPS ‚Äì Public Consultations 

The CPS consultations were carried in two stages: starting in February 2011, consultations focused on the 
general approach and the critical elements of the proposed CPS; and the final draft was consulted in 
November 2011. Meetings were held in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Donetsk to better understand 
social and cultural diversity of Ukraine. The discussion was focused on the general directions of the 
proposed World Bank Group strategy; adequacy of the Bank evaluation of the Ukraine's economic, social 
and political context; developmental challenges and opportunities; as well as the CPS principles, pillars 
and expected results. 

CPS team met in total with about 300 representatives of NGOs, academia, professional associations, 
think-tanks, business circles, members of local self-governments, youth, and donor organizations.  Draft 
CPS along with the CPS CR was distributed in advance.  The draft CPS was also published on the Bank 
Ukraine web page and solicited public feedback and comments from individuals not participating in the 
meetings.   

Consultations with the business community in Kyiv were prepared in cooperation with the Kyiv-Mohyla 
Business School; Youth Democratic Alliance provided support in organizing consultations with the 
youth; local NGOs assisted with meetings with the civil society and businesses in Kharkiv, Ivano -
Frankivsk and Donetsk.  

During consultations in February and in the following months, the World Bank team solicited views on 
the economic and social reforms in Ukraine, public perception of the government agenda, governance and 
corruption and recommendations on how to improve the business environment and enhance the civil 
society‚Äò role in advancing reforms. Participants were in agreement that since the Independence there have 
been dozens of government programs of economic and social development; but implementation of these 
programs has been inappropriate, not meeting the country needs and the public expectations. Typically, 
there has been quite a large gap between declarations and legislation on one side, and implementation on 
the other side. Outcomes of these reforms have been not visible, in particular in improvement of people‚Äòs 
lives. Due to a high level of state capture and conflict of interests, the Ukrainian authorities have had a 
credibility problem within the Ukrainian society.  Even constructive reform initiatives have been often 
met with distrust by the population. This feedback was mostly used in formulation of the ‚ÄïCounty 
Context‚Äñ and ‚ÄïDevelopment Challenges and Opportunities and Government Agenda‚Äñ chapters of the 
CPS. 

During consultations on the draft CPS in November 2011, vast majority of stakeholders appreciated the 
very high level of analytical work behind the CPS and candid assessment of the economic, social and 
political developments in Ukraine. Consultations confirmed that slow and ineffective implementation of 
the reforms and entrenched corruption were the major challenges to bold reforms. 

Representatives of the civil society and the business community agreed with the calibrated approach to 
financial assistance proposed in the CPS. From their prospective, this could stimulate government‚Äòs 
interest in achieving tangible results of the reforms.  

Participants confirmed the Bank diagnosis that deep structural reforms cannot succeed without progress in 
reducing corruption and improving public governance, and that the vitality of Ukraine‚Äòs civil society 
presents an opportunity for the government to build public support by inviting civil society to dialogue on 
economic and social priorities and to monitor outcomes of public expenditures.  Participants highly 
appreciated placing a new social compact at the very center of the CPS. It was understood that while 
WBG would use the policy dialogue, lending, investment, and TA to strengthen constructive relations 
between the government and the civil society, the willingness and determination of the authorities would 

77 

 
be critical to the success of building the new social compact. Support of donors in building the capacity of 
CSOs will continue to be a very important factor. 

Representatives of the business community noted that removing obstacles for private business 
development was essential to creating a real middle class, increasing  Ukraine‚Äòs competitiveness and the 
sustained economic growth. However, persistent pressure on businesses from government inspection 
agencies continues despite declared measures to lighten the burden of the regulation. Participants voiced 
an opinion that Bank has a large role to play in facilitating the dialogue between the government and the 
business community in order to achieve predicted and easy-to-follow business rules and appropriate legal 
protection of businesses. At the same time, businessmen indicated that there was promising progress in 
some cities where directly elected mayors understood the importance of the constructive work with the 
civil society and business. Such cases should be supported and propagated, and be rolled-over to other 
regions. It is a practical problem of successful decentralization of responsibilities to local authorities but 
also to CSOs in such areas as education, health, and social protection. 

The participants of the consultations welcomed the Bank initiative to involve grass-root organizations in 
monitoring of implementation of the WBG supported projects and creation of opportunities for public 
procurement monitoring. 

Overall, it was a prevailing tenor of the consultations that the proposed CPS for FY12 -16 was strategic 
and realistic and made proper use of the lessons learned.
