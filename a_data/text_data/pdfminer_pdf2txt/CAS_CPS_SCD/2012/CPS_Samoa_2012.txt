COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY12 - 16 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
This Country Partnership Strategy represents the first individual country strategy prepared for 
Samoa.  The World Bank has been scaling up its assistance in the Pacific and is moving from a regional 
approach to individual country strategies, to better acknowledge country-specific challenges and priorities. 

ii. 
Samoa highlights the particular challenges facing small and remote islands states, with its 
development trajectory heavily influenced by its economic geography.  Strong policy performance since the 
mid-1990s has supported generally successful efforts to meet most MDGs while macro-economic stability 
has enabled relatively strong growth compared to other remote small island economies.  Nevertheless, 
Samoa’s small size, limited natural resources, narrowly based economy, and distance to major markets have 
imposed speed limits to growth when compared to economies of with similar income levels and policy 
performance that do not face the same constraints.  Recent exogenous shocks, including a devastating 
tsunami in 2009 and global economic volatility, highlighted the continuing vulnerability of even well 
performing small islands such as Samoa. 

iii. 
The overarching theme running through the Government’s new Samoa Development Strategy and 
the proposed Bank Group program is the importance of building resilience against shocks .  Within this 
World Bank Group engagement with Samoa will focus on supporting Government efforts to: (i) rebuild 
macro-economic resilience and encouraging inclusive growth; (ii) generate opportunities from global and 
regional integration; and (iii) strengthen resilience against natural disasters and climate change. 

iv. 
Efforts to rebuild macro-economic resilience and encourage inclusive growth will be anchored in 
a stronger and collaborative policy dialogue between the Bank, Government, and partners to accelerate 
reform.  A central element of this discussion will be to build on current efforts to enhance service deliver and 
public expenditure management.  At the same time, this strategy and the Government’s own priorities reflect 
an increasing focus on structural reform to improve competitiveness and encourage broad based growth.  In 
addition, given Samoa’s comparative advantages in tourism, IFC will focus on encouraging significant new 
investments to support 4,000 new arrivals per year across the Pacific .  In order to support broad based 
growth, targeted Bank and IFC investments are also designed to improve agricultural productivity and 
provide greater opportunities for micro and small enterprises. 

v. 
Greater economic integration with neighbors offers the best way for Samoa to overcome 
disadvantages of smallness and distance.  The Bank is committed to helping Samoa capitalize on growing 
opportunities for temporary labor migration to New Zealand, and more recently Australia.  As highlighted by 
the telecoms revolution in the region, better transport and communications links can mitigate the cost of 
distance and encourage integration; and a key focus will be to build on the success of telecoms reforms and 
encourage new private investment to improve broadband connectivity.   

vi. 
As with many small economies remote from major markets, continuing external financing flows 
are likely to be critical for Samoa to build longer-term resilience and maintain service delivery.  Given 
Samoa’s strong performance, the Bank is committed to working closely with the Government and partners to 
ensure that assistance can be provided flexibly in support of Samoa’s own efforts to rebuild macro-economic 
stability and improve service delivery.  This will be supplemented by targeted and innovative efforts to help 
Samoa improve food security and mitigate and respond to climate change and natural disasters. 

vii. 
New ways of doing business will be required if the Bank Group is to be as effective as pos sible in 
supporting Samoa.  Assistance will need to be provided flexibly, reflecting Samoa’s strong policy 
performance.  Even closer collaboration with partners will be critical.  And given Samoa’s need to rebuild 
macro-economic resilience, all options will need to be explored to encourage new private investment for 
infrastructure and to mobilize grant financing from other partners.  In this, the Bank will need to be both 
imaginative and disciplined.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY  
2012 - 2016 

I. RATIONALE FOR A COUNTRY STRATEGY FOR SAMOA 

1. 
This is the first individual Country Partnership Strategy prepared for Samoa.  Reflecting 
rapidly increasing World Bank Group engagement across the Pacific islands, individual country strategies 
are now being prepared for each client country.  Given similar issues facing many of the small Pacific 
islands, such strategies will be shaped by a common regional approach.  Individual strategies will, 
however, allow a more nuanced discussion of how broader themes in the Bank Group’s engagement 
across the Pacific can be tailored to reflect the different histories and challenges of each country.   

2. 
This strategy has been prepared in close coordination with the Government of Samoa and key 
development partners.  As well as consultations with key bilateral and multilateral partners, the 
Government of Australia and the Asian Development Bank participated with the Bank Group in joint 
programming discussions with the Government of Samoa in preparing this strategy. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT: SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

Economic Geography: The Constraints of Distance, Density, and Dispersion 

3. 
Samoa is a small and remote Pacific island country, with less than 200,000 people residing on 
two main islands, approximately 3,000 km from New Zealand, and 4 000 km from Australia .  The 
country was settled by Polynesian voyagers who arrived approximately 3,000 years ago.  Samoa is a very 
cohesive and structured society, with a strong traditional culture.  Each of Samoa’s several thousand 
extended families nominates at least one traditional high chief (“matai”) who represents them in village 
councils.  Since independence from New Zealand in 1962, Samoa has been a stable democracy.  Under 
the Constitution, executive power rests with the Prime Minister, who is elected by the legislature.  The 
right to stand for election is limited to matai, although election is by universal suffrage .  The Human 
Rights Protection Party has been in power for most of the past 30 years, most recently winning office in 
March 2011 with a five year mandate until 2016.   

4. 
Samoa illustrates many of the constraints facing even well performing small island states.  
Samoa’s country policy and institutional assessment is the highest among the Bank’s Pacific Island 
member states and among the top five of all IDA borrowing countries.  Strong policy settings for almost 
two decades have resulted in MDG outcomes and economic performance well above the average for 
comparable island countries.  Yet Samoa’s small size, limited natural resources, narrowly based economy, 
distance to major markets, and vulnerability to exogenous shocks , impose speed limits on growth and 
have led to a high degree of volatility in recent economic performance.   

5. 
Reflecting strong policy performance and service delivery capacity, Samoa is on track to meet 
key MDGs.  Full details on Samoa’s MDG performance can be found in Annex 3 (Country at a Glance) 
and Annex 4 (Selected Social and Economic Indicators): 

 Hunger is almost non-existent, with the 2008 Household Income and Expenditure Survey suggesting 
that the level of food poverty in Samoa is about 3% of households.  Nevertheless, using the national 
poverty line, the level of basic needs poverty remains persistent at about one in five households.  

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Education access in Samoa is good. The adult literacy rate is 99%.   Net primary school enrolment is 
93%, although quality of education remains a concern, with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat 
2010 MDG Tracking Report suggesting that about half of year six children assessed as at risk of poor 
outcomes in English literacy and numeracy. 

 Health indicators have improved, although with emerging issues.  Samoans are now living, on 
average, a decade longer than thirty years ago, with life expectancy at birth rising from 62 in 1980 to 
72 in 2008. Samoa has met MDGs targets for improved infant, child and maternal mortality rates, and 
almost all births are attended by skilled health professionals. Health facilities are well distributed 
throughout the country, although there are staff shortages, reflected in a recent decline in 
immunization rates.  Non-communicable and lifestyle diseases are an increasing problem, with 
particularly high levels of obesity. 

 Gender outcomes are mixed. Samoa has ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).  Equal numbers of girls and boys attend primary 
school, and girls are slightly over-represented in secondary education.  Nevertheless, women make up 
only slightly less than 40% of the paid workforce.  Women’s representation in Parliament is low, 
although about 40% of departmental CEOs are women.  The Samoa Family Health and Safety Study 
found almost half of all women had experienced some form of domestic violence. 

6. 
Since the start of reforms in the mid-1990s, Samoa’s economy has until recently shown 
reasonable growth, underpinned by a stable macro-economic environment and a business friendly 
investment climate.  Samoa’s current GDP per capita is about $2,900.  Since the early 1990s, growth has 
averaged 3% per annum, well above both Pacific and Caribbean comparators (see figure 1).  Growth has 
been accompanied by prudent fiscal policy, which has seen government debt reduced dramatically since 
peaking at over 100% of GDP in the mid-1990s.  This has been driven by tax reforms, including the 
introduction of a VAGST (value added goods & services tax) in 1994 to improve revenue and move away 
from tariffs, as well as restructuring to contain expenditures while modernizing the public service and 
improving service delivery.  An exchange rate peg to a basket of currencies has proven credible, 
anchoring inflation expectations.  Macro-economic stability has been matched by structural reform to 
encourage investment.

7. 
Recent shocks have highlighted the particular disadvantages facing even well performing small 
and remote island states such as Samoa.  The Samoan economy contracted by over 5% in 2009 as a 
result of the cumulative effects of the 2008 food and fuel price spikes, the global slowdown, and a 
devastating tsunami in September 2009.  While the coincidence of economic and natural shocks was 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
particularly unfortunate for Samoa, this illustrates many of the structural vulnerabilities confronting small 
island states – especially the particularly remote island countries of the Pacific.

8. 

The Global Economic Crisis has severely impacted small island economies such as 
Samoa, highlighting their continuing vulnerability.  Ultimately, small and remote island economies 

are likely to find it very difficult to follow the traditional path of growth moving from agricultural 
production to the export of manufactured goods and services.  The economic costs of smallness and 
distance undermine export competitiveness in the production of commonly traded manufactured goods 
and services.  Samoa’s strong growth compared to small island counterparts, for instance, remains low 
compared to lower middle income countries as a whole – despite Samoa’s better than average policy 
performance – and well below the fast growing East Asian developing countries.  The economy remains 
narrowly based and vulnerable to shocks.  Tourism receipts make up about 20% of the economy and 
almost half of all external earnings, but have been affected by the slowing global economy. Agriculture 
provides employment and a safety net for much of the population, but has been subject to recent poor 
harvests. Remittances from the large diaspora, have averaged around 24% of GDP over the last 10 years.  
A strong policy environment has allowed Samoa to make the most of regional concessionary trade 
arrangements, particularly in car parts, but slowing global demand and increasing transport costs from 
increasing fuel prices led to downsizing at the plant and the loss of over 1,000 jobs.  Samoa’s heavy 
reliance of fuel imports, which have averaged slightly less than 10% of GDP, led to inflation increasing to 
14% in 2009 as a result of fuel price spikes, despite the adoption of a bulk-purchasing program for fuel 
administered by the Government that mitigated transference of the price rise .  In addition to the direct 
impact on the economy, the increase in transport costs associated with fuel price spikes affected the cost 
of imports, which make up about 50% of GDP, and reduced Samoa’s already limited export 
competitiveness.   

9. 
A devastating tsunami in September 2009 caused tremendous human suffering and was a stark 
reminder of the vulnerability of small island states to natural disasters.  While Samoa is subject to 
regular cyclones, this was the worst disaster since Independence with 143 people killed.  Physical damage 
alone is estimated at $60 million, or over 10 % of GDP.  In addition, the tsunami significantly affected the 
key agriculture and tourism industries.  World Bank led work on Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment 
and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) suggests that the average annual cost to small islands from natural 
disasters is equivalent to approximately 3% of GDP.  And risks from natural disasters are potentially 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
increasing further, with climate change posing a major long-term threat.  Although Samoa does not face 
the same existential threat as atolls states such as Kiribati or Tuvalu, vulnerabilities are compounded by 
the fact that 70 % of Samoa’s population and infrastructure are located in low lying coastal areas.  

10. 
Samoa’s swift and effective response to the shocks has provided a foundation for the economy 
to rebound.  The authorities responded to the global recession and tsunami with expansionary monetary 
policy and a significant fiscal stimulus (equivalent to $100 million or about 15% of GDP over 4 years). 
Spending has been effectively allocated to address the immediate needs of resettlement and infrastructure 
rehabilitation as well improving safety nets, and is designed to boost economic activity and generate 
employment opportunities, while laying a foundation for expanding the productive capacity of the 
economy in the medium term.  The economy is responding to these measures, and growth of just below 
3% is estimated in FY11, although this could slow slightly in over the next few years.   

11. 
It will be vital for the Government to tighten fiscal policy as planned in order to maintain hard 
won macro-economic stability and ensure debt remains at sustainable levels.  While expansionary fiscal 
policies were an appropriate response to exogenous shocks, Samoa’s previously modest fiscal deficit 
widened to 10% of GDP in FY10 – a level that is not sustainable in the medium term.  External public 
debt is also anticipated to climb back to over 55% of GDP, and a decline in reserves has reduced long-
term resilience (see figure 3, and detailed economic indicators and projections in Annex 4).  In order to 
maintain macro-economic stability and ensure debt sustainability, the Government is committed to 
reducing the fiscal deficit to below 3.5% of GDP by FY14, by reprioritizing expenditures to give priority 
to infrastructure to resuscitate growth and eliminate non-essential spending.  Tough policy choices will be 
required if macro-economic stability is to be maintained, but this will be critical for Samoa’s long-term 
future.  Current assumptions also assume that remittances will remain at about 20% of GDP and the 
Government will continue to be able to secure grants and highly concessional financing of over $100m 
per annum.  The Government intends that new borrowing will be on concessional terms only, and any 
non-concessional borrowing, or even concessional borrowing on terms more expensive than offered by 
the multilateral development banks, would add further pressure to the overall debt situation.  Baseline 
scenarios also assume that the Samoan economy will grow at 1.5 – 2.0% per annum.  Should fiscal 
consolidation not occur as anticipated, or should there be further exogenous shocks (possible at a difficult 
time for the global economy), there would be significant risks to Samoa’s long-term resilience at a time 
when economic buffers are limited.  IMF Article IV discussions provide a forum for partners to discuss 
these issues with the Government, with the mission scheduled for April 2012.

12. 
As well as fiscal consolidation, continuing structural economic reform will also be important to 
improve competitiveness and encourage longer-term growth, despite the inevitable speed limits and 
volatility facing small island economies.  Samoa’s rank of 60th in the World Bank’s Doing Business 
survey 2012 places it among the highest among Pacific countries.  Samoa has been among the forefront of 
Pacific island countries in introducing reforms to the telecoms and airlines sectors in the mid -2000s.  Still, 
after the transformation of the Samoan economy in the 1990s and early 200s, the Doing Business ratings 
of several other island countries have over the past decade climbed relative to Samoa.  If Samoa is to 
maintain its hard won competitive advantage in terms of the quality of its regulatory and business 
environment compared to competitors, there is scope to further accelerate momentum on the remaining 
structural agenda and encourage greater economic efficiency.  This will be important given broader risks 
to global growth, which could impact remittances and tourism, on which Samoa relies heavily. 

13. More broadly, size and remoteness are likely to restrict Samoa’s global competitiveness; 
prospects for longer-term economic development in Samoa are likely to depend significantly on greater 
economic integration with neighbors, maximizing the gains from natural resources (especially 
tourism), and continued external remittance and aid flows.  Reflecting the particular constraints of small 
island economies, the Bank, with other donors and the active engagement of Pacific Islands academics 
and opinion leaders, is working at conceptualizing an adaptable framework of donors engagement in 
small and vulnerable economies, altering the traditional development paradigm linking good performance 
and sound policy to sustainable, self sustaining economic growth and human development leading to 
eventual self reliance and the phasing out of international development assistance.  A key element of this 
analysis is that perhaps the best way of overcoming disadvantages of smallness and distance is through 
integration with larger economies, providing market access, skills, ideas, cheaper import prices, and 
investment.  Samoa already has a significant expatriate population in NZ, the US, and Australia, although 
increased labor market integration, including short term employment opportunities, offers potential 
benefits for both labor sending and receiving countries.  Better transport and communications links can 
also mitigate the cost of distance and encourage integration, as can aligning and harmonizing regulatory 
rules and standards.  Similarly, pooled service delivery by the Pacific islands can help to address 
problems of cost and capacity simultaneously.  Maximizing gains from natural resources – in Samoa 
tourism and, although to a lesser extent than many other islands, fisheries – will be particularly important 
given constraints to the establishment of large scale manufacturing industry.  And, as with many rural and 
remote areas even within developed countries such as Australia or the US, continuing financial and 
technical assistance are likely to continue to be required.   

Government Development Strategy 

14. 
The key focus of the Government of Samoa’s 2012-2016 Strategy for the Development of 
Samoa (SDS) is on strengthening economic resilience and encouraging inclusive growth through 
increasing investment in the productive sectors of the economy.  The SDS will consolidate the progress 
achieved over the previous SDS period from 2008 – 12, which had a relatively strong emphasis on 
strengthening service delivery.  The new SDS draws on a review of the previous SDS led by the Ministry 
of Finance and reflects views expressed during extensive stakeholder consultations.  The Government is 
committed to encouraging private sector investment to encourage inclusive growth.  Given Samoa’s 
comparative advantages in tourism, investment in tourism infrastructure will be scaled up to promote 
Samoa as an attractive tourist destination that is supported by good infrastructure and service delivery .  
Dedicated interventions will be directed toward the agricultural sector to encourage broad-based 
participation in growth, raise domestic production to meet food security needs, and boost export capacity.  
Opportunities to transform viable agricultural products to higher value added processing for the export 
market will be given attention.  Investment will also continue in support of the social sectors in order to 
achieve a healthy Samoa and improved access to quality education and training.  Infrastructure in terms of 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
water, energy, transport, and telecommunications will continue to be supported to provide the enabling 
environment for businesses and improved service to the public.  

Donor Engagement 

15. 
Samoa, like many small island states, is heavily reliant on international development 
cooperation flows.  International assistance is growing substantially; following the 2009 tsunami, gross 
commitments in FY11 reached WST 270 million ($120m) and it is anticipated that international flows are 
likely to be maintained at approximately this level over the next few years.  Development cooperation 
flows are equivalent to about $600 per capita or 20% of GDP.  In addition, the role of church and 
community groups remains very strong, and churches tend to be a significant provider particularly of 
primary education services in Samoa, as in many other Pacific island states. 

16. 
Growing aid flows reflect not only a scaling up by traditional partners, but the emergence of 
new donors in the Pacific, including Samoa.  Key traditional bilateral partners include Australia, New 
Zealand and Japan, while multilateral partners including the IMF, ADB, the EU, the UN System, and the 
World Bank, have also had a long engagement with Samoa.  In addition, China is now playing a 
significantly greater role in the Pacific, and has emerged as one of Samoa’s largest partners.  Across the 
region, the OPEC Fund for International Development and the Gulf states are increasing investments in 
renewable energy.  Details of individual donor programs are provided in Annex 1.   

III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT 

World Bank Group Engagement across the Pacific Island Countries 

17. 
The Bank Group’s engagement with the Pacific Island countries reflects the fact that their 
development trajectories will be shaped – more than perhaps any other nations in the world – by their 
economic geography.  The Bank’s Pacific island member countries1 have a population of about 2 million 
people spread across hundreds of islands, and scattered across an area equivalent to 15 % of the globe’s 
surface.  The island states themselves have a key role in establishing a policy environment that encourages 
investment and long-term development outcomes, and Samoa is an example of the benefits of domestic 
policy reform.  At the same time, given constraints to growth, greater economic integration and more open 
labor markets in metropolitan neighbors, as well as more equitable natural resource agreements, will also 
be vital for the longer-term future of the Pacific Islands. And given their fragility and geographic isolation, 
sustained development progress will require long-term cooperation by international partners. Even where 
policy environments are strong, external assistance is likely to remain needed to support service delivery.   

18. 
The World Bank Group is in the process of scaling up its engagement with the Pacific Island 
countries as part of a renewed longer-term commitment.  Both IDA and IFC are significantly increasing 
engagement.  As well as scaling up in traditional clients like Samoa, the Bank is placing particular 
emphasis on reaching out to “non-traditional” clients.  World Bank IDA and trust fund commitments to the 
Pacific of almost $250m in the past four years have been more than in prior history, as have IFC 
commitments of almost $90m (figure 4).   

19. 
 A key priority for the Bank Group across the Pacific will be to translate the credibility and trust 
generated by a growing program into a more substantive and coordinated policy dialogue with countries 
to strengthen their own reform efforts.  The value of our engagement is not principally defined in terms 

1  Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

of the volume of lending, but rather by the extent to which the Bank can “bundle” its expertise and 
financing, collaborate with other development partners to transfer global knowledge, build capacity, and 
encourage changes that will improve the lives of Pacific Island citizens.

Translating Common Regional Themes into a Samoan Context: Strengthening Resilience 

20 
The key theme running through the Bank Group’s engagement with Samoa will be to 
strengthen resilience.  This reflects both the priorities set out in the new Samoa Development Strategy, as 
well as the Bank’s broader approach across the small and remote Pacific island countries.  Within this 
framework, key priorities for the Bank Group’s engagement with Samoa will include supporting 
Government efforts to: 

(i) Rebuild macro-economic resilience and encouraging inclusive growth; 

(ii) Generate opportunities from global and regional integration; and  

(iii) Strengthen resilience against natural disasters and climate change.   

21. 
Samoa’s access to considerable grant financing provides a useful discipline on the Bank, and 
will require the program to be highly selective.  Although the Bank has been able to make IDA grant 
financing available to the smaller Pacific islands reflecting their limited capacity for longer term debt 
sustainability, Samoa’s relatively strong performance and size means that IDA financing will be on 
concessional terms.  Particularly at a time when the Government is committed to reducing public debt , 
this will require the Bank to be highly selective in its engagement; to ensure that all activities are able to 
strengthen Samoa’s longer-term development prospects; are of very high priority for the Government; are 
areas in which the Bank can bring particular comparative advantages compared to other partners, and that 
all options are explored to mobilize private sector investment or grant financing for investments.  The 
Government has, for instance, indicated that it gives priority to mobilizing grant financing for social 
sector investments.  As a result, Bank financing for health is unlikely to continue to be required, although 
service delivery and issues such as health financing are likely to be an element in a broader policy 
dialogue among the Government and partners.  Similarly, the strategy reflects the lead role of partners 
such as the ADB and EU in the energy and water sectors respectively.

Rebuilding Economic Resilience and Encouraging Investment for Inclusive Growth 

22. 
Reflecting demand from both the Government and partners, this strategy will be anchored by 
the Bank Group playing an increasing role to support reform efforts in Samoa, with analytical work 
backed up by a multi-year series of development policy operations.  Samoa’s strong policy performance 
and needs following exogenous economic shocks and natural disasters led donors to increasingly provide 
budget support for Government operations, supplementing sectoral investments.  In 2009, donors 
including Australia, the EU, New Zealand, ADB, IMF and World Bank agreed on a coordinated policy 
matrix with the Government of Samoa as a foundation for budget support.  Planned budget support from 
the Bank will be grounded in Samoa’s policy and reform program.  The Government expects that possible 
budget support from the international community will help consolidate Samoa’s fiscal position and 
longer-term resilience.  While a detailed policy matrix will be developed during 2012 in coordination with 
the Government and partners, it is envisaged that policy actions will focus around themes such as: (i) 
fiscal consolidation and strengthened public expenditure and public financial management; (ii) improving 
service delivery; and increasingly, (iii) structural reform to strengthen competitiveness and encourage 
medium-term investment and growth. 

23. 
Continuing support to strengthening the Government’s public expenditure management will be 
vital for Samoa to enhance long-term resilience.  Especially at a time of fiscal consolidation, 
strengthened planning systems and public expenditure management will be critical to ensure efficiencies 
and maintain service delivery standards, and will remain a feature of a coordinated policy dialogue.  In 
general, the overall governance environment in Samoa is relatively strong, as evident in Samoa’s CPIA 
rating and a Transparency International corruption perceptions rating of 69 out of 183 count ries – among 
the top 6 of all IDA borrowers.  Strengthening PFM systems was a particular focus of the policy matrix 
agreed in 2009, and the Government has established a central procurement unit and developed a strategic 
plan to further strengthen internal audit.  Nevertheless, there is scope for further improvement, and the 
Government is committed to implementing recommendations of a 2010 Public Expenditure and Fiduciary 
Assessment (PEFA) as well as undertaking a review of procurement processes, with the support of the 
Bank.   

24. 
The focus of Samoa’s previous development strategy, together with the exogenous shocks 
suffered by Samoa in 2009, has meant broader policy discussions between the Government and 
partners appropriately focused in the past few years on immediate economic recovery needs, and 
protecting the most vulnerable.  A continuing focus on strengthening service delivery will be important, 
especially given emerging issues with education quality, as well as declining immunizat ion rates and 
growing prevalence of lifestyle diseases.  The Bank will continue to support Samoa’s successful efforts to 
improve social outcomes, although at the request of Government, engagement will be through analytical 
support and policy dialogue in conjunction with partners, with the Government mobilizing grant 
financing after the current health sector support program.  The Bank is working closely with NZ, as lead 
donor, and Australia to support health financing reform and to encourage behavioral change given high 
levels of lifestyle diseases in Samoa.  With support from Australia, the Bank is also scaling up analytical 
work across the Pacific on early grade reading assessments (EGRA), and Samoa will be a priority country 
for a first phase EGRA scheduled for FY13 given Samoa’s strong tradition of student assessments and in-
service teacher training.  There is scope to supplement EGRA work in Samoa with an Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) analysis.  This work will inform discussion on a future joint policy matrix.  Australia 
and New Zealand are also exploring options to increasingly encourage better health and education 
outcomes through the provision of sector budget support linked to agreements on policy actions.   

25. 
As the recovery proceeds, however, the Government is now giving greater priority to renewing 
momentum on the structural reform agenda to promote inclusive growth, and this will be a key feature 
of future policy discussions.  Samoa shows that, despite the constraints faced by small island economies 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
as a result of their economic geography, strong domestic policy settings can help to raise the speed limits 
on growth – but an outstanding reform effort remains if Samoa is to further improve economic 
competitiveness.  The government divested 21 SOEs in the early 1990s, and has improved independent 
oversight of remaining businesses.  The restructuring in 2005 of government-owned Polynesian Airlines 
into a majority privately owned joint venture with a foreign airline has helped reduce airfares to Samoa by 
around half, resulting in a significant increase in tourist arrivals, as well as removing a financial burden to 
the budget.  Nevertheless, there is a significant remaining agenda; while remaining SOEs only account for 
10% of formal employment, more could be done to further improve efficiency.  Similarly, further 
structural reform could encourage new investment.  Recent changes to the Companies Act  have reduced 
the time, cost, and complexity of registering a business, and Samoa has also significantly reduced the time 
and cost of land registration (being the top reformer in this area in the World Bank’s Doing Business 
report for 2011).  Still, getting credit remains difficult, with limited publicly available credit information, 
and insolvency resolution can be time consuming and costly.  And while land issues are sensitive and 
integral to Samoa’s traditional culture, lack of legal title to customary land, which accounts for about 80% 
of all land in Samoa, and an inability to transfer ownership, inhibits some forms of economic use, 
particularly through impeding access to finance.  The passage of legislation to allow banks to use capital 
improvements on leased customary land as collateral is a step in the right direction, although uncertainties 
with contract enforcement mean that banks remain reluctant to lend to households and business on this 
basis.  The Government anticipates articulating a policy framework during 2012 that could provide the 
basis for a coordinated policy matrix to provide a foundation for support from development partners.  The 
Bank Group, in turn, anticipates scaling up analytical support for Government efforts, in close 
coordination with key multilateral and bilateral partners.  Linked to this, IFC is assisting the Unit Trust of 
Samoa, established by the Government to encourage local investment in newly privatized entities, to 
expand its local investor base. 

26. 
As well as supporting policy reform, a key focus of this strategy is to combine the public and 
private sector instruments that the Bank can deploy to assist the country improve competitiveness and 
attract new investment.  IFC intends to significantly scale up efforts to encourage new investment in 
Samoa, with a focus on tourism.  Tourism is a particular comparative advantage for many of the Pacific 
island states, and – even despite the tsunami – remains Samoa’s fastest growing industry and major 
source of foreign exchange beside remittances.  Samoa is one of 3 focus countries – with Tonga and 
Vanuatu – for the Pacific Regional Tourism Initiative (PRTI) to be launched in 2012.  The initiative aims 
to mobilize US$15 million in new private sector funding for tourism infrastructure as well as US$30 
million in new tourism investments to support up to 4,000 new tourist arrivals across three pilot countries 
over the next three years.   

27. 
Encouraging broad participation in the formal economy will be important to ensure growth is 
inclusive and the benefits shared widely to reduce income poverty .  IFC is undertaking analytical work 
in Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu to explore options for a holistic approach to assist micro-enterprises and 
SMEs overcome key constraints growth.  Micro and SMEs themselves identify access to finance and 
access to markets as key constraints, while financial institutions have identified lack of collateral and 
information asymmetry as key limitations they face in expanding lending to SMEs.  One potential option 
could be for IFC, the Bank, and partners to work together to replicate a risk share facility that could 
encourage commercial banks to increase lending for micro and SMEs, including but not only in tourism, 
as was established in 2011 in PNG.  In order to ensure benefits of tourism investments are widely shared 
among local populations, IFC’s tourism initiative also anticipates supporting SMEs to improve supply 
chain links with larger operators, with the aim of helping 150 SMEs across the 3 target countries to 
increase revenues by a combined US$0.5 million per year. 

28. 
Reflecting the particular difficulties food price spikes caused small islands such as Samoa and 
the importance of agricultural reform to encourage broad based growth, the Government places high 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
priority on assistance from the Bank to strengthen food security and agricultural productivity .  While 
there are some examples of niche agricultural export industries in Samoa (particularly the export of nonu 
juice to China and virgin coconut oil), the agriculture sector in Samoa is dominated by small scale 
subsistence and semi-commercial farms, which provide a key safety net for many Samoans.  The Samoa 
Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Project (SACEP), financed by a combination of IDA credits 
and grant resources from the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) will help to improve food 
security by supporting greater livestock and fruit and vegetable production by subsistence and semi-
commercial farmers.  The investment will also assist small farmers to take grea ter advantage of market 
opportunities, particularly by accessing supply chains for tourism operators in Samoa, and provide 
opportunities for import substitution.  In building resilience and encouraging inclusive growth, the 
Government places priority on investment in downstream processing of agricultural products utilising the 
research results undertaken by the Scientific Research Organisation of Samoa (SROS).  

29. 
To build resilience against fuel price shocks, IFC in conjunction with ADB could explore 
opportunities to encourage new private sector investment in the generation market.  Samoa was hard hit 
by fuel price shocks, although was insulated more than some other islands by the fact that about 40% of 
energy needs are met from hydropower as well as by a well functioning by bulk fuel purchasing and 
storage systems.  Over 98% of households are connected to the grid.  ADB has historically led on energy 
sector issues, and is helping the Government to develop an integrated energy roadmap to prioritize least 
cost investments, as the World Bank is in Tonga and Vanuatu.  The Australian Government also has 
significant grant financing available to support public investment in energy.  Recent legislative changes to 
open the generation market to new independent power producers potentially offer a significant 
opportunity to encourage new private investment in infrastructure, replicating the successful experience in 
the telecoms sector.  IFC would be able to work with the Government and ADB to explore options to 
encourage new private generation investment, such as for proposed hydropower investments in Sava’ai, 
which would help to meet the ambitious investment targets set out in the Government’s National 
Infrastructure Strategic Plan, prepared with assistance from the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Centre 
(PIAC).  Samoa has also been a leader in the Pacific, with support from the Bank over more than a 
decade, in encouraging local private sector engagement to undertake road maintenance, rather than 
relying on Government implementation. 

Generating Opportunities from Greater Global and Regional Integration 

30. Making the most of international employment opportunities will be especially important for 
Samoa, and a continuing priority for Bank Group support.  Labor is one of the few viable exports for 
many small and remote island countries, and Samoa has traditionally benefitted from significant 
remittances.  Although labor mobility remains subject to significant policy barriers, New Zealand and, 
increasingly, Australia are expanding scope for temporary labor migration.  New Zealand’s Recognised 
Seasonal Employment (RSE) scheme, introduced in 2007, now provides opportunities for up to 8,000 
participants per year to work in the horticultural industry.  Approximately three quarters of participants 
tend to come from the Pacific, including an average of almost 1,000 Samoans per year.  This scheme has 
provided significant benefits for participating Pacific island countries, with studies suggesting workers 
will bring home an average of $4,400 each year (after deductions and living expenses), as well as 
experience with modern agriculture and computer literacy and English language skills.  In a “win-win”, it 
also provides considerable benefits for New Zealand, where the industry estimates RSE has helped 
increase production by as much as $150 million since its inception.  While a similar Australian Seasonal 
Worker Program (SWP) has had a slow start, it is now expanding and offers significant potential.  The 
Bank was involved in providing advice to both Australia and NZ on international best practice on 
temporary labor migration.  And the Bank remains closely engaged, with financial support from 
Australia, in providing technical and analytical advice for Pacific island countries including Samoa to 
manage their participation in such schemes.  

10 

 
 
 
 
 
31. 
The Bank Group will support efforts by Samoan workers to send back funds more cheaply and 
to establish businesses on their return.  The Bank and IFC have been working with Governments and 
private sector financial institutions to help bring down very high costs of remittances on Pacific routes.  
Although the situation is improving, with average to rates to transfer an amount of USD 200 now down 
from almost 20% to below 15% - with some significantly cheaper systems increasingly well used – 
further improvements are required to meet the 2014 CHOGM targets of 5%.  IFC is actively working with 
organizations in the Pacific to develop products and services that will help meet these targets. At the same 
time the Bank and IFC are engaged with central banks across the Pacific, including Samoa, to strengthen 
payment systems legislation.  This work will enable safer and more secure payment systems to protect 
consumers, particularly where services are provided by non banks, and will encourage initiatives such as 
new technologies and mobile money transfers.  Regional investments will be key to strengthen the 
national payments system and retail payments infrastructure, including in Samoa.  Sources of financing 
for such investments are being explored.  Once workers have returned, IFC’s Pacific micro-finance 
initiative also offers a mechanism to support a wide range of emerging entrepreneurs to open businesses.  
IFC is also working with the major Banks in Samoa to establish a new credit bureau that will facilitate 
reasonable lending to the lower two thirds of the population. In time, the credit bureau should reduce the 
cost of credit overall by lowering risks.  

32. 
The 
telecommunications revolution 
throughout 
the Pacific has provided enormous 
opportunities for people.  Samoa, in 2006, was one of the first Pacific countries to open its telecoms 
market in order to encourage competition and allow new private sector operators.  The result has been to 
dramatically lower telecoms costs and improve coverage – with mobile phone usage increasing from 
about 20% of the Samoan population to over 90% in only a few years.  Improved telecommunications has 
literally opened up the world to those previously disconnected. Connectivity allows fishermen to access 
timely price information; enables mobile financial services; better connects people to schools and health 
services, and provides entrepreneurs with better information in a timely manner.  The Bank Group has 
played a key role in securing reforms by providing extensive support through IDA to develop policy and 
strengthen regulatory agencies to oversee a liberalized market, as well as transaction advisory services for 
the sale of SamoaTel to a private investor in 2011.  Highlighting synergies across the Bank Group, IFC 
investments have played a key role in encouraging new private operators, with an IFC investment of 
$10.5m in Samoa encouraging total new investments of over $40m.   

33. 
The next key challenge in the ICT sector will be to improve broadband connectivity, to provide 
opportunities for Samoans to participate in and benefit from the global economy .  Samoa, unlike many 
of the smaller islands, has a cable connection via American Samoa to Hawaii and is not forced to rely on 
relatively expensive satellite links.  Nevertheless, the lifespan of the current reconditioned cable is 
limited, and a new cable option needs to be identified to meet the projected growth in demand for Internet 
bandwidth. In addition, further regulatory reform is likely to be required to reduce the currently high retail 
costs of internet access.  The Bank Group is working closely with Samoa to identify least cost options for 
a new international fibre-optic cable: possible routes include: (a) a connection to a possible new NZ-US 
cable currently being proposed to investors; (b) a new cable to the Southern Cross Cable Network in Fiji.   
The Bank would be prepared to work with the Government as well as partners such as IFC, ADB, and 
EIB to encourage new private investment, while ensuring that there is open and fairly-priced access to 
bandwidth for all domestic service providers.  Nevertheless, an element of concessional financing through 
the Government is likely to be required to reduce the cost of capital, and strengthen the overall business 
case.  Bilateral partners such as Australia have indicated interest in providing grant financing to support 
public participation in a PPP.  The Bank could also make IDA credits available for such an investment 
should a financing gap remain.  Given that activities with regional spillovers can be included, such 
investment can potentially draw on additional resources from the IDA Regional Program over and above 
the normal IDA financing envelope for Samoa. 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
34. 
Supporting investment and reform of economic infrastructure to support regional integration 
will be critical and is an area in which the Bank could offer assistance if needed.  Elsewhere in the 
Pacific, the Bank is supporting countries in their efforts to harmonize aviation safety standards and 
regulations with those of NZ, and to upgrade infrastructure.  The Government is currently considering 
needs for safety upgrades at Faleolo international airport, and the Bank could, if needed, offer 
concessional financing to support public investments.  As with IDA financing for regional broadband 
connectivity, the participation in the regional aviation program also has the potential to obtain some 
financing from the IDA Regional Program, in addition to Samoa’s normal allocation.  Commercialization 
of airport operations also offers potential to attract private sector finance, particularly for terminal 
upgrades.  Similarly, across the region, there are significant investment and reform needs required to 
modernize ports – a crucial element in encouraging export competitiveness – and this is also an area 
where the Bank could offer expertise and potentially regional financing on top of regular country IDA 
allocations, again in conjunction with possible grant financing from partners such as Australia. 

Building Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change 

35. 
Given vulnerabilities, targeted investments to improve Samoa’s long-term resilience to natural 
disasters and climate change will be a key focus for new Bank engagement.  The Bank has been able to 
mobilize $25 million in grant financing for Samoa through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience 
(PPCR).  Initially, grant resources will be focused on “climate proofing” the main West Coast road from 
the airport to the capital of Apia.  A second phase, anticipated in FY13, will help Samoa develop a 
national climate adaptation plan, and support 16 districts to implement high priority coastal protection 
works, in conjunction with UNDP support for Samoa’s other 25 districts.  These investments build on the 
Bank’s highly successful engagement with Samoa over more than a decade supporting transport and 
disaster mitigation and rehabilitation.  The Bank was able to move quickly, for instance, to use the 
flexibility provided by emergency response procedures, to support investments in new access roads to 
communities that had decided to relocate inland after the tsunami.  Similarly, the Bank effectively 
supported reconstruction efforts in Samoa following Cyclone Heta in 2004.  In addition, Bank assistance 
for transport sector reform in Samoa since the late 1990s has ensured an integrated asset management 
strategy and continued recurrent cost to finance necessary maintenance.  Samoa’s success in building 
local private sector capacity to undertake road maintenance was evident in the rapid and effective 
response by local contractors to clear roads and ensure access following the 2009 tsunami.  Should the 
Government wish, further IDA resources could also be made available on top of PPCR financing to assist 
with priority new transport sector investments identified as priorities in the National Infrastructure 
Strategic Plan.  The Australian Government has indicated interest in working the bank in transport. 

36. 
Innovative mechanisms to strengthen long-term resilience and to provide a quick response 
capacity following future disasters will be explored.  The Bank’s Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment 
and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) program has undertaken a major risk analysis across the region, and is 
able to provide Governments with highly detailed geospatial information in order to mitigate and manage 
disaster risks.  The Bank is now working closely with the Government of Japan to introduce risk pooling 
and insurance mechanisms that would reinforce broader mitigation efforts while at the same time 
providing a fast response facility in the event of future disasters.  Samoa is one of five Pacific island 
countries that will be part of a pilot insurance program, expected to be established in late 2012, prior to 
the next cyclone season.  IFC is also planning to explore the feasibility of developing a weather index 
insurance program for the Pacific under its Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF).  In addition, the Bank 
will explore scope to use the flexibility now available under the new IDA Immediate Response 
Mechanism (IRM) to build contingent disaster response components into current and new investments. 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Mainstreaming Gender 

37. 
Gender issues will be mainstreamed throughout the program.  As noted, gender outcomes in 
Samoa are mixed.  The current health sector support program gives priority to ensuring that high levels of 
maternal health services, particularly skilled medical practitioners at birth, are maintained .  Education 
analytical work will similarly give attention to ensuring that high levels of girls’ representation at primary 
and secondary school are maintained, and with a focus on improving education quality for both boys and 
girls.  Especially given the relatively limited participation by women in formal economic activity, 
particular attention will be paid to this issue.  In supporting subsistence households, the Samoa 
Agricultural Competitiveness Enhance Project (SACEP) will give particular attention to assisting women 
and youth; data will be collected on a gender disaggregated basis; and the investment has been designed 
with input from Women in Business Development Incorporated, which has had particular success in 
developing niche agricultural exports in Samoa.  IFC analytical work to explore options for a more 
holistic approach to assist micro-enterprises and SMEs overcome key constraints to growth will similarly 
explore the differential constraints to growth (including access to finance) faced by male and female led 
enterprises. And technical assistance provided by the Bank to help Samoa manage participation in 
temporary labor migration schemes will explore options for greater participation by women, with most 
current participants being men undertaking work in the agricultural and horticultural industries.  The UN 
system has traditionally led on gender specific interventions in Samoa, and is significantly expanding 
gender focused interventions to strengthen the position of women.  In this context, the Bank’s legal 
department will explore the scope to possibly mobilize trust funds to help address domestic violence. 

New Approaches 

38. 
In Samoa, and across the Pacific, the World Bank Group is committed to working in very close 
collaboration with partners.  This reflects the priority Pacific island leaders placed in the 2009 Cairns 
Compact to make better use of all resources available for development.  This strategy has been developed 
not just in very close coordination with partners but through joint programming discussions with the 
Government in which key bilateral and multilateral partners were integrally involved.  This commitment 
to collaboration is also highlighted in the intention of key partners to work together with the Government 
of Samoa to develop an agreed policy matrix as a foundation for potential budget support from all 
partners.  At the operational level, the Bank and ADB are now jointly co-financing investments in both 
Tonga and Kiribati, and options to do so in Samoa, particularly to support broadband connectivity, will be 
given priority.  The establishment of joint ADB – World Bank liaison offices across the Pacific, including 
Samoa, has also helped significantly to improve understanding between the two organizations as well as 
to provide a capacity for more regular engagement with the Government and implementation support for 
the program.  And flexible Australian and NZ support for the Bank’s operations in the Pacific have been 
instrumental in allowing the scale up that has occurred and potentially provide a model for collaboration. 

39. 
Although Bank Group engagement with Samoa will be highly selective, Samoa’s strong 
performance and relatively familiarity with the Bank compared to other island countries provides an 
opportunity to trial new approaches that can potentially be replicated elsewhere in the region .  Samoa’s 
strong policy performance offers opportunities to use budget support instruments to underpin reform 
efforts.  The Bank is working with the Government and partners to support a procurement assessment, 
and it is anticipated that this could help to strengthen systems that will, in turn, allow an increase in 
thresholds for national competitive bidding and prior review of contracts.  At the sectoral level, the 
availability of bilateral grants and Samoa’s macro-economic situation will impose a useful degree of 
discipline on the Bank to be both selective and innovative.   

40. 
The telecoms revolution in the Pacific has highlighted opportunities to encourage new private 
investment for critical economic infrastructure, and potentially provides a model for other sectors.  

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
More detailed consideration of options to encourage private, rather than just public, investment is likely to 
be required if the ambitious National Infrastructure Strategic Plan is to be implemented.  The Bank Group 
is committed to working with the Government and partners to explore options for PPPs.  In addition, the 
Bank could work with the authorities to explore the use of IDA guarantee to reduce the risk to the private 
sector and leverage more resources to Samoa for financing infrastructure.2 

Financing Envelope and Sources 

41. 
The Bank has had a longer and more substantive engagement with Samoa than any of our 
other Pacific clients, and this is expected to continue over the next five years.  In total, the Bank could 
potentially make US$80 – 100 million available to Samoa through IDA and trust fund resources over the 
CPS period, compared to US$140 million in commitments since Samoa joined the Bank in 1975. This 
includes an indicative 3-year IDA16 allocation of approximately US$25-30 million and a potentially 
similar amount in IDA17, subject mainly to performance and financing of the overall replenishment. 3 
There is also scope for Samoa to access additional resources from the IDA Regional Program over and 
above the country allocation, to finance qualified regional investments with cross-country spillovers, such 
as regional broadband connectivity or regional aviation safety. While the Bank has been able to make 
IDA grant financing available to many of the smaller Pacific island countries given their current debt 
distress or high risks to debt distress, Samoa is currently eligible to receive IDA on highly concessional 
credit terms4. IDA availability will continue even with Samoa’s anticipated graduation from least 
developing country status. In addition, the Bank has already secured US$30 million in new trust fund 
grant resources, including $25 million from PPCR and $5 million from GFRP, with the potential for 
further trust fund resources to be mobilized during the course of the CPS. 

42. 
The program will need to be implemented flexibly; actual resource use will depend very much 
on decisions by the Government of Samoa during the CPS period and are likely to be influenced by the 
availability of grant funds from partners and private financing for investments.  The Government has 
indicated strong interest in using approximately half of its base IDA allocation – or about $5 million per 
year – as budget support.  The Bank and the Government has also agreed on combined IDA and GFRP 
financing for the Samoa Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement investment, and broad agreements 
have been reached on the use of PPCR financing.  Decisions the use and volume of IDA resources for 
new transport, broadband connectivity, and aviation safety investments will be determined during 
implementation of the strategy.  Samoa and the Bank may modify the strategy and program in the outer 
years depending on evolving country and external developments and domestic priorities. 

2  IDA guarantee only counts 25% against a country’s IDA allocation; and guarantee can also help catalyze 
additional investment from the private sector. 
3  IDA resource allocations are based on 3-year replenishment cycles. For IDA16 (FY12-14) allocations, only the 
FY12 allocation is firm while estimates for FY13-14 are indicative only and can change depending on: (i) total 
IDA resources available in the respective fiscal year in IDA16; (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the 
terms of IDA's assistance to the country (grants or credits) in the respective fiscal year base d on its debt 
sustainability position; (iv) MDRI debt relief and the redistribution of the MDRI compensatory resources as 
applicable; (v)the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; and (vi) the number of IDA -eligible 
countries. The indicative allocations and IDA’s terms of assistances are updated annually. For IDA17 (FY15 -17), 
in addition to these factors, available IDA resource would also depend on the size of the replenishment. 
4  IDA’s terms of assistance (grant or credit) is based on a recipient country’s debt sustainability position, and thus 
these terms are updated annually based on the latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). Among IDA -only 
countries, those in debt distress or with a high risk of debt distress are eligible for IDA g rants while those with low 
risk of debt distress are eligible only for credits; and those with a moderate risk of debt distress are eligible for a 
50/50 credit/grant mix. The latest DSA in 2010 indicates that Samoa has a low risk of debt distress, and thus in 
FY12, it is eligible only for IDA credits, which has zero interest rate, a 5 -year grace period, a 40-year maturity, 
and thus a grant element of about 61%.

In addition to IDA, IFC will actively explore opportunities to encourage new private 
investment in tourism and tourism infrastructure, as well as potential private engagement in PPPs to 
support broadband connectivity, new energy generation, aviation, and solid waste collection. 

RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES 

44. 
The key risk is that further exogenous shocks will put Samoa’s hard won macro-economic 
stability at risk.  Recent history in Samoa has demonstrated that even well performing small island states 
are likely to experience significant economic volatility, with natural disasters also posing a continuing 
risk.  Samoa’s macro-economic buffers have been depleted by exogenous economic shocks and a 
devastating tsunami.  Further shocks, particularly the risk of a slowdown in Australia and New Zealand 
on which Samoa’s economy relies, could hit the economy hard at a time when resilience has already been 
weakened.  The timing and sequencing of flexible budget support arrangements will need to be calibrated 
to reflect economic circumstances. 

45. 
A reacceleration of reform momentum will be required, with fiscal consolidation critical to 
maintain debt sustainability and structural reform needed to increase the speed limits on growth.  Even 
without shocks, Samoa will need to rebuild reserves, undertake significant fiscal consolidation, and 
carefully manage debt, being particularly cautious to mobilize external financing on grant or highly 
concessional terms.  While Samoa has been a strong performer, an acceleration of reform momentum will 
be needed.  Managing the potential social implications of implementing the reforms and maintaining 
social support for the reform agenda will be key.  Mitigating and supportive factors include: (i) the strong 
degree of political continuity in Samoa, with many of the current leaders also having played a key role in 
significant reform efforts in the late 1990s and early 2000s that saw a transformation of Samoa’s 
economy; and (ii) the Government’s clear mandate following elections in 2011 which gave it a new 5 
year term. 

46. 
Strong coordination among partners will be required to ensure coordinated policy engagement 
with the Government.  As outlined above, there is a strong commitment among Samoa’s traditional 
partners to more collaborative approaches.  With changing global economic balances, greater integration 
with fast growing East Asian economies offers significant opportunities for Samoa, and greater 
collaboration on the ground with such non-traditional partners will be a key priority. 

47. 
The program will need to reflect the inevitable capacity constraints facing small island states, 
even well performing ones such as Samoa.  Historically, investments in Samoa have performed well, 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the current portfolio performing reasonably and IEG confirming ratings of satisfactory or moderately 
satisfactory on all activities exiting the portfolio in the past decade.  There is consequently greater scope 
in Samoa to selectively engage in sectors where the Bank has less of a track record, although this will 
need to be balanced with continued support in more tried and tested sectors in order that risks in the 
overall portfolio are manageable.  In contrast in even smaller countries elsewhere in the region 
investments are likely to focus very much on replicating successes that have been achieved in other 
Pacific island countries.  Nevertheless, capacity constraints are evident in sectors such as agriculture and 
health, and very close portfolio oversight will be required to maintain this record.  The establishment of a 
joint World Bank Group – ADB liaison office provides a greater level of day to day engagement with 
counterparts and implementation support, although considerable engagement of international staff will be 
required given that “on the ground” support in Samoa still remains relatively limited.  Investments will 
need to be very focused and targeted.  New approaches will also be required to address capacity issues.  
This includes efforts to “crowd in” greater private sector involvement in service delivery, as has occurred 
in the telecoms sector and road maintenance rather than solely working through government agencies and 
exploring of opportunities for regional approaches to generate efficiencies and allow for regulatory 
harmonization.

ANNEX 1 

Annex 1: Donor Coordination 

Australia is Samoa's largest partner, and assistance has significantly and steadily increased to 
approximately A$48 million (US$51 million) in FY11. The framework for Australian cooperation with 
Samoa is set out in the Samoa-Australia Partnership for Development signed by respective leaders in 
August 2008 – revised in 2011. Australia provides assistance in four priority areas: (i) governance and 
economic stability; (ii) better quality and more equitable education; (iii) improved health services; and 
(iv) improved law and justice. 

China provides approximately 40 million Yuan (US$6m) in grants to Samoa per year.  Priorities are set 
by the Government of Samoa, with a focus particularly on infrastructure, including government buildings, 
sport and hospital facilities. China also provided significant in-kind assistance to rehabilitate education 
facilities following the tsunami.  A 210 million Yuan (US$31m) loan on concessional terms was provided 
for the Samoa National Medical Centre and the Headquarters of the Samoa Ministry of Health, and 
concessional lending has also been made available to support Government communications. 

Japanese bilateral assistance has averaged almost $10m per annum, and concessional financing has been 
provided for energy sector priorities in conjunction with ADB.  Samoa is also eligible for support from 
the 6.8 billion yen (US$77.5m) Pacific Environment Community Fund (PEC Fund) that will focus on 
solar power generation and sea water desalination projects in the Pacific region. 

New Zealand’s joint commitment for development with Samoa, signed in July 2011, guides 
development cooperation programs which reached NZ$16 million (US$11.5m) in FY11.  Priorities 
under this shared vision to enhance long-term development outcomes include: (i) strengthening tourism; 
(ii) private sector development, (iii) renewable energy, (iv) agriculture; (v) basic education; (vi) 
scholarships; and improving health outcomes.   

The Asian Development Bank has had a long-term engagement in Samoa, based around an integrated 
program of analytical work and investments.  Under a broad Pacific Approach 2010-14, ADB’s 
engagement with Samoa is outlined in a Business Plan for the period 2012-14.  Concessional finance of 
$18m per year is available from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), with additional grant based 
technical assistance facilities totaling almost $2 million during this period.  ADB has been integrally 
engaged in macro-economic and structural policy dialogue, including SOE reform and the economic use 
of customary land, supported by an Economic Recovery Support Program.  Investments have been 
focused on expanding the power sector (with Japan) and sanitation and drainage in order to remove 
these constraints on growth. ADB, with Australia and NZ has also been engaged on strengthening 
education outcomes. 

The European Union’s country strategy (2008 – 2013) sets out a framework for engagement with Samoa 
under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF). The EC anticipates making approximately €31m 
(US$41m) available during this period, focused primarily on extending access and improving system 
quality in the water sector.  

The IMF has provided support to Samoa to spur recovery and reconstruction following the 2009 
tsunami. In 2009 Samoa borrowed $9m from the IMF.  Prior to this loan, Samoa made purchases from 
the IMF’s General Resources Account in 1984 and 1985.  

The United Nations system is active, with UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, UNEP, UNESCO, FAO 
and WMO implementing programs and projects.  UNDP was especially active in coordinating an 
immediate needs assessment following the tsunami.  The combined average development expenditure of 
these organizations between 2000 and 2008 was $2m per annum, although this is increasing with 
significant climate change adaptation funding.

Current assistance by individual donors is set out below, using the Government of Samoa’s budget 
framework for reporting on donor engagement by sector.

Annex 2: Samoa Results Matrix 

Priority 1: Rebuilding Economic Resilience and Encouraging Inclusive Growth 

Rebuild Macro-
Economic Resilience 

Encourage Greater 
Private Investment in 
Tourism and in 
infrastructure service 
delivery 

 2009 tsunami and exogenous 
economic shocks  led to fiscal 
deficit increasing to 10% of 
GDP in FY10 and external 
public debt increasing from 
30% of GDP to 58% in 2011  
 The Government anticipates a 
reduction in the fiscal deficit to 
below 3.5% of GDP by FY14 
(subject to no further 
exogenous shocks)  will reduce 
pressures for external debt even 
on concessional terms. 
 Samoa’s Doing Business rating 
of 60 places it among the better 
performers in the Pacific, but 
with room to improve. 
 Tourism is a key comparative 
advantage, and the Government 
is committed to encouraging an 
increase in visitor arrivals from 
baseline of 120,000 per year 
and increase in tourism receipts 
from baseline of WST 300m 
per year. 
 Tourism arrivals were hurt by 
the 2009 tsunami but are 
returning despite the global 
slowdown 
 Despite a significant program 
of reform, inefficient SOEs still 
lead to high cost of 
infrastructure service provision 

 Fiscal consolidation and 
rebuilding of reserves 
 Improved competitiveness, 
including improvements on 
Doing Business indicators 
 Strengthened public financial 
management 
 Improved efficiency and 
effectiveness of service 
delivery to strengthen health 
financing and address 
education quality
