Foreword 

This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) has been prepared together with the Government 
of the Republic of Seychelles. This strategy document has been produced at a time when 
the Government was drafting the Medium Term National Development Strategy (MTNDS) 
for Seychelles. Country-wide consultations took place between November 2011 and 
January 2012. Besides the authorities, other stakeholders consulted were the private sector 
organizations, Members of the National Assembly, and the civil society organizations. The 
Government of Seychelles and World Bank have agreed that a CPS mid-term review will 
take place in the first quarter of FY14.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
This proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) outlines the strategic direction 
for the World Bank’s program for Seychelles for FY12-15. This strategy builds upon the 
FY10-11 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) which laid out a work program to develop the analytical 
underpinnings for a full CPS for the World Bank Group (WBG). Since the ISN was successful, it 
is fitting that CPS is naturally the next level of engagement by the WBG. Drawing on this work, 
this strategy aligns with the draft Seychelles Medium-Term National Development Strategy 
2013-2017 (MTNDS), which based on a participatory approach, sets out the vision and goals for 
the country. The core aim of the MTNDS is to reduce Seychelles vulnerability and to provide the 
basis for long term sustainable development. This strategy reassesses Strategy 2017 which was 
launched in 2007. Strategy 2017 has been only partly implemented as the economic environment 
of Seychelles and that globally have changed, and Seychelles needs to adapt to the new world 
environment and thrive in it. 
2. 
External economic conditions call for accelerated reforms. In light of the uncertainties 
in the global economic environment, and especially developments in Europe to which Seychelles 
remains vulnerable given the weight of tourism in its economy and the still predominant share of 
European tourists, the Government of Seychelles has decided to accelerate structural reforms 
designed to improve public sector effectiveness, enhance competitiveness and reform its 
extensive social protection programs to better cushion the poor and vulnerable people. 
3. 
The Government’s commitment to reform is proven by its track record of the last 
three years. Through strong ownership of the reform agenda at the highest level, and leveraging 
on support from the IMF and other bilateral and multilateral partners, the Government has made 
commendable progress towards achieving macro-economic stability, emerged from a period of 
debt distress to debt sustainability with improved credit-worthiness, and successfully weathered 
the shocks of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. In 2010 and 2011, the Seychelles registered 
primary surpluses of 4.5 percent. While the reform momentum is maintained, the Government 
created the National Economic Council (NEC) chaired by the President, with members from the 
public and private sector, which has as core function to advise Government on the best economic 
policy for sustainable national growth and development.  
4. 
Macroeconomic performance is satisfactory and outlook broadly positive but 
contingent on external economic environment. The Seychelles economy rebounded 
remarkably well. It grew at 6.7 percent in 2010 and revised estimates show that real GDP growth 
rate for 2011 is at 5 percent. This achievement was underpinned by improved macroeconomic 
policies that emphasized strong fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary policies. However, for 
enduring results, the reform momentum must be maintained and binding constraints to growth 
streamlined. The economic outlook for the medium term is broadly positive, although Seychelles 
remains vulnerable to external shocks. Real GDP forecast for 2012 has been revised downward 
to 4 percent from 4.7 percent forecasted in June 2011, reflecting the anticipated impact of the 
unfolding sovereign debt and banking crisis in Europe. Given the importance of the tourism 
sector in the economy, prospects for that sector will remain central to the Seychelles’ medium-
term economic prospects. This said, the Seychelles require a stronger growth path, in order to 
consolidate its progress on debt and fiscal sustainability. Linked to that is the core aim of the 
MTNDS, that is reduce vulnerability and enhance sustainable development. Inflation increased  
from near zero in 2010 to about 5 percent in 2011, on account of higher international food and 
oil prices, but is expected to decline to about 3.5 percent for 2012 

i 

 
 
 
5. 
The reform program supported in this strategy is organized in two pillars and one 
foundation: competitiveness and employment, vulnerability and resilience, and governance and 
public sector capacity. These pillars have two key objectives in mind: reduce vulnerability and 
build long term sustainability. Analytical underpinnings for the reform program will be provided 
both by existing and programmed analytical work. Existing analytical work that has shaped 
Government’s on-going reform agenda includes Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), a Strategy 
for Strengthening Budget Management, a Public Financial Management Performance report, a 
review of Administrative Barriers to Private Sector Development and Business Environment in 
the Seychelles, and the Review of the Policy Regulatory and Administrative Environment.  
6. 
The World Bank Group’s support to Seychelles will be implemented using the three 
core instruments: partnerships, knowledge and finance. Partnership with key stakeholders (the 
Governments, the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and other members of the private sector, 
the University of Seychelles, the civil society represented by Liaison Unit of Non-Governmental 
Organizations  (LUNGOS), and other development actors like AfDB, EU, UNDP, and IFC will 
play a primary role in coordinating the implementation of the strategy. Building partnerships will 
become even more critical in supporting Seychelles in case oil extraction is found to be 
commercially viable. The Bank Group’s strategy is to partner with Seychelles in the 
implementation of the reform program in areas for which it has a comparative advantage, and 
deepen cooperation with a wider range of partners at the regional and global levels. The Bank 
Group will therefore focus on a subset of Seychelles’ development challenges, and will reinforce 
other partners’ engagement to support the Government’s priority reforms in other ways.  
7. 
The IFC and MIGA engagement might be expanded during the course of the 
strategy period. The IFC will complement the WBG’s engagement with Seychelles by 
continuing to explore demand and expand their investment primarily focused on financial sector 
(SMEs), capital market development, tourism and fisheries related projects and infrastructure 
development that will create employment opportunities. There are possibilities for both IFC and 
MIGA to explore possibilities for technical assistance in the creation of Public-Private 
Partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure projects. Although MIGA does not have any project in 
Seychelles, it stands ready to join IFC’s initiatives.  
8. 
The Bank will generate analytical work to underpin the reform program, as well as 
to help identify areas of weaknesses and binding constraints to sustainability beyond the 
medium term agenda. The reform program supported under the ISN FY10-11 was based on 
critical ESWs developed by the Bank and other partners. Those analytical pieces were focused 
on the critical needs of the on-going short-term reform agenda. While the Bank will continue to 
produce focused knowledge work to support evidence-based policy changes in the medium term 
reform program, based on the request from the Government, the Bank will also undertake ESWs 
to generate discussions and debates, and build consensus, on longer term sustainability 
constraints. This specific request from the Government is based on the fact that the country has 
limited local capacity for analytical work, and it recognizes the Bank’s role as a strategic advisor 
and honest broker. 
9. 
The main instrument to support implementation of reforms is a three-year 
programmatic series of Development Policy Operations (DPO). This programmatic series 
will consolidate and reinforce reforms achieved during the previous years, while shaping the way 
to a sustainability path. The areas of the programmatic DPO series is embedded in the strategic 
approach highlighted in this strategy for Seychelles. In the competitiveness and employment 

ii 

 
 
 
pillar, this series will support improving the business environment. The main policy reform 
centers on the private sector to become the source of economic growth. In the vulnerability and 
resilience pillar, this series will support improving efficiency of selected state owned enterprises 
(SOEs), enhance the social protection system, and consolidate fiscal discipline (budget 
management and efficiency in health spending). In the governance and public sector capacity 
foundation, this series will support the establishment of institutions to prepare for the 
development of the country’s petroleum resources, and improve transparency and accountability 
in the fisheries sector. Based on lessons learned from past DPOs, the Bank will support a 
selective and targeted program while maintaining high emphasis on design and implementation. 
The Bank will also make use of trust funded operations and reimbursable technical assistance to 
complement the DPO in supporting the reform agenda. 
10. 
This CPS is being prepared at a time when the Government awaits the finding of 
evidence of commercially viable oil reserves from the on-going exploration. Initial 
exploration data acquired in the Seychelles marine EEZ and results from drilling in the East 
Africa region have been encouraging. However, at this stage, there are no clear indications that 
oil or gas production would be economically viable or of when, if it was, exploitation may begin. 
If exploration activities are successful, the economic impact for the country would be dramatic, 
with Government revenue generated from a single development project potentially ranging from 
$500 million to $2 billion annually over a period of 10-15 years.  The country is preparing for a 
bidding process to further allocate exploration licenses in 2012 in order to increase the level of 
foreign investment in exploration operations. The Bank will monitor closely the evolution of 
exploration activity and, if warranted by results, will deepen the Bank’s engagement in 
strengthening the Seychelles’ regulatory and revenue management capacity in this area. Given 
the risk associated with such a development the Government is also very conscious of its impact 
of the environment. In parallel, the Government is in the process of commissioning a study to 
evaluate the benefits over the economic and ecological costs. 
11. 
The main risks to implementing the CPS derive from national macroeconomic 
factors, institutional capacity, societal resistance and changes in climatic conditions. 
Macroeconomic stability is vulnerable to exogenous shocks such as volatile commodity prices, 
threats of piracy, and economic shocks like the Euro Zone crisis. To mitigate risks associated 
with external shocks, the Bank will support reforms to improve public finance management, in 
particular enhance the allocative efficiency of expenditure and accelerate medium-term 
expenditure planning. In case of need, the Bank will also scale up its financial support to the 
country. Capacity is an issue at all levels of the public sector in Seychelles, which must contend 
with a serious lack of technical expertise in some areas and limited human resources owing to its 
small size. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will provide technical assistance and strengthen 
implementation capacity in areas with skills gap. The Bank also selected to be involved in a 
limited number of policy areas to ensure that the authorities are not overstretched in the 
implementation process. The reform program may be delayed, especially since the new round of 
reforms calls for significant ownership and drive needed from a range of ministries and agencies, 
unlike the first-generation reforms, driven mainly by the Ministry of Finance. Erosion of political 
support (especially for reforming state-owned enterprises) and social dissatisfaction with the 
reforms’ potential short-term impacts on social groups may also slow critical reforms. The Bank 
will use change management mechanisms, including communications strategy to address  
societal concerns. The Bank will also support in improving the social protection programs to 
ensure that the poor and vulnerable are well targeted. In the implementation process of sensitive 
iii 

 
 
 
reforms (including changes in utility tariff structure and housing finance), the Bank will adopt 
slow process built on consultations and consensus. Seychelles remains vulnerable to several 
natural hazards including floods, rising sea levels, landslides, and tsunamis, and these pose 
serious risks to the country. These risks should be mitigated by the strong commitment, 
leadership, and ownership of the Government in implementing the current reform program. The 
Government has also committed itself to improving social safety net programs properly targeted 
on the poor and vulnerable. To mitigate risks to disaster and climate change, the Bank will 
support in the development of a master plan for disaster risk management which will be build on 
the assessments of geological risks, and provide technical expertise to develop risk financing 
tools.  Finally, the Government has a strong record of comprehensive communication and 
consultation to gauge public willingness to pursue the reforms.

I 

INTRODUCTION 

12. 
The Republic of Seychelles is a service-based, highly concentrated, middle-income 
economy. Seychelles has an estimated population of 88,311 (2010) and comprises 115 tropical 
islands spread over 45,166 hectares in the Indian Ocean.1 The population inhabits 10 of the 
islands, with around 90 percent concentrated on the largest island, Mahé. The country is blessed 
with natural beauty of unique appeal, an asset that has drawn and will continue to draw a 
growing number of tourists. With a GNI per capita of US$ 9,420 (2009), Seychelles is classified 
as a high middle income country.  
13. Given its small size and insularity, Seychelles faces a number of development 
challenges. The limited land, capital, and human resources restrict its ability to benefit from 
economies of scale in production and economic diversification. Seychelles has a high 
dependence on external markets because of its small domestic market, high vulnerability to 
external factors, and has limited institutional capacity. Tourism and fisheries (fishing and fish 
processing) are the economy’s two major pillars. Seychelles enjoys an exclusive economic zone 
of almost 1.4 million square kilometers in one of the world’s major tuna fishing grounds. 
Tourism accounts for 25 percent of GDP, 25 percent of employment, and 70 percent of foreign 
exchange earnings. Tuna fishing and processing combined accounted for more than 30 percent of 
GDP in 2005 and still account for close to 5 percent of GDP, about 7 percent of jobs, and around 
35 percent of export goods, despite impacts of piracy, environmental factors and increased 
regional competition between fishing ports and processing plants. Limited backward linkages to 
the rest of the domestic economy from both sectors, however, implies that the potential for 
spillover effects remains untapped. The small manufacturing sector (8 percent of GDP) includes 
the tuna cannery, small food and beverage enterprises, and a modest construction sector that 
provides 5 percent of GDP. The artisanal fisheries and agricultural sectors are small, accounting 
for less than 3 percent of GDP combined, but of great socio-economic significance as illustrated 
by the piracy impact on the livelihood of fishing communities and on the availability and price of 
fish for the consumers. With a concentration index of 0.5, Seychelles exports remain highly 
undiversified compared to those of comparator small island economies. 
14. 
Following a sharp policy turnaround initiated in 2008, the macroeconomic situation 
has improved. The risk of debt default is reduced and economic outlook is positive. The 
Seychelles grew by 6.7 percent and 5 percent (revised estimates) in 2010 and 2011, registered a 
primary surplus of 4.5 percent, a further decline in public debt to GDP ratio to 78.5 percent, but 
increased inflation from near zero in 2010 to about 5 percent in 2011, on account of higher 
international food and oil prices. Despite global economic uncertainties, real GDP growth is 
projected to be around 4 percent in 2012. This said, the Seychelles require a stronger growth 
path, in order to consolidate its progress on debt and fiscal sustainability. Linked to that, the core 
aim of the MTNDS is to reduce Seychelles vulnerability and to provide the basis for long term 
sustainable development. 
15. 
The authorities are highly committed to addressing the critical development 
challenges to growth and sustainability. In light of the uncertainties in the global economic

environment, and especially developments in Europe to which Seychelles remains vulnerable 
given the weight of tourism in its economy and the still predominant share of European tourists, 
the Government of Seychelles has decided to accelerate structural reforms designed to improve 
public sector effectiveness and to harness private sector growth and create wealth and 
employment, while at the same time reform the social protection programs to better cushion the 
poor and vulnerable people. The reform program supported in this strategy is organized in two 
pillars and one foundation: competitiveness and employment, vulnerability and resilience, and 
governance and public sector capacity, respectively. These pillars and foundation have the 
Government’s two key objectives in mind: reduce vulnerability and build long term economic 
sustainability, and social stability.  
16. 
Consistent with the new Africa Strategy, the World Bank Group’s support to 
Seychelles will be implemented using the three core instruments: partnerships, knowledge 
and finance. The Bank will be the leading partner for reforms in those areas, in which it has 
comparative advantages, and generate and disseminate analytical work in key strategic areas to 
guide reforms. The main lending instrument supporting the reform agenda will be a 
programmatic series of Development Policy Operation (DPO), but also grants from trust funds 
and reimbursable technical assistance (RTAs).  
17. 
This CPS is being prepared at a time when the Government awaits the finding of 
evidence of commercially viable petroleum reserves. Only a small portion of its large marine 
exclusive economic zone has been evaluated through drilling. Recent exploration activity has 
been sparse and largely confined to the acquisition of seismic data in the confines of two 
petroleum license areas. However, recent discoveries in the marine shelf area between the 
Seychelles, Tanzania and Mozambique have heightened petroleum industry interest in the East 
Africa offshore region and several prominent exploration and production companies have 
enquired about licensing opportunities in recent months. In response, the Government is 
preparing for a bidding process to further allocate exploration licenses in 2012 in order to 
increase the level of foreign investment in petroleum exploration operations. Given the 
possibility of environmental risk associated with such a development, although potential for oil 
exploration is only offshore, the Government is very conscious of its impact of the environment. 
Thus the Government is in the process of commissioning a comprehensive Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) study to evaluate the benefits over the economic and ecological costs. 
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation & Enforcement (BOEMRE) of the U.S. 
Department of Interior is also engaged in this area and has plans to continue a program of 
technical assistance with the Seychelles authorities.   

II 

COUNTRY CONTEXT  

18. 
Seychelles has come a long way since the 2008 crisis, but a number of weaknesses 
and challenges remain to be addressed. Seychelles has a high per capita income, high standard 
of living, and high levels of human development and better governance indicators than many 
comparator countries. It has also been strongly pursuing reforms under the Bank and IMF 
programs and has managed to secure generous debt relief, which together with fiscal 
consolidation has led to a much better macro and debt picture than a few years ago. Nevertheless 
Seychelles has a number of weaknesses that remain to be addressed, in addition to the challenge 
of its small size, remoteness, and vulnerability to shocks. A bad track record with debt 
management and poor public finance management led to a default in 2008 and public debt 
2 

 
 
 
figures are still relatively high.  After the debt crisis reserves have recovered somewhat but 
remain low, particularly given Seychelles vulnerability to external shocks.  Below, in more 
details the following are elaborated: social context, political developments, public sector 
governance and economic developments. 

Social Context 

19. 
The Seychelles has better social indicators than comparator small countries. It has 
already achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially for education, 
health, poverty eradication, and the environment. Gross enrollment in primary and secondary 
education is high (above 100 percent). Education is free to the secondary level and subsidized at 
the tertiary level. Additionally, the state provides free access to healthcare—the Seychelles has 
better indicators of health outcomes (such as life expectancy and child mortality rates) than many 
other small island states. For instance, the country’s life expectancy at birth is 73 years, equal to 
that of Mauritius. The maternal health MDG is largely achieved. Infant mortality was at 14 per 
1,000 live births in 2010. For many years the Seychelles has recorded zero maternal mortality2; 
births attended by skilled health staff hovers between 99 and 100 percent; and proportion of 
women receiving prenatal care has consistently been over 99 percent.   
20. 
Although Seychelles has remarkably achieved most of the health MDGs, challenges 
remain. In the last three years, the Government has introduced a number of changes in the health 
sector as part of the overall economic reform program. Some of the major reforms were: (a) 
organizational restructuring with the Health Service Agency being absorbed and the functions 
merged to the Ministry of Health core functions, (b) staff downsizing through an early voluntary 
departure schemes, and (c) outsourcing of ancillary services. However, there exist no evidence 
that these reforms have resulted in cost saving, efficiency gains or quality improvement. Key 
challenges in the health sector include: (1) low coverage of some important services, (2) the 
burden of disease in Seychelles has shifted to non-communicable diseases, injuries, and mental 
health problems, (3) a noticeably inefficient sector, particularly in the size, organization and 
management of health infrastructure3, (4) long term fiscal sustainability challenges, and (5) high 
turnover rate of medical practitioners. Contraceptive use remains low4, teen pregnancy is a big 
problem5, and HIV and AIDS continue to rise. Non-communicable diseases, injuries, and mental 
health have been the main causes of death in recent years. Over the years, Seychelles has 
developed a robust network of health facilities. However, bed occupancy rate is low6. The 
constitution grants free access to primary care services, but in practice all services are provided 
free of charge, creating additional fiscal pressure. The health sector recurrent budget allocation 
has more than doubled in the last five years7. Cost of health care provision will certainly 
continue to rise, particularly because of: (a) the increase in the demand for expensive tertiary 
care treatment, including overseas treatment, from the high burden of non-communicable 
diseases; (b) the population structure, which shows an upward movement from a younger to an 

2 Since 2000 a total of four maternal deaths are registered, one maternal death in each year for 2002, 2004, 2005 and 
2008

5 32 percent of all first pregnancies occurring among the 15-19 age groups. Although medical abortions are possible 
through a medical board for very specific reasons many women still opt for illegal abortions 
6 50 percent on Mahé and even much less in Praslin and Ladigue 
7 In 2011 the health sector budget was over SR400 million including allocation for capital investment. It is the 
second highest item in the overall Government budget.

older population; and (c) being small island state, Seychelles has low economies of scale 
particularly for capital investment – unit cost of service provision will remain high. Sustaining 
the current health financing arrangement will present a major fiscal challenge in the medium to 
long term. At present over 50 percent of the medical officers (GPs), consultants and other 
specialists are provided through the bilateral cooperation program with high turnover that 
presents operational challenges in continuity of services and maintaining standard of care. 
21. 
Despite having achieved universal education, there are critical issues in that sector 
as well. Learning outcomes have been disappointing, and skill gaps are increasingly visible as 
Seychelles further modernizes its economy. Learning achievement in mathematics, as measured 
by the SACMEQ III assessment, showed that Seychelles’s students had a mean mathematics 
score well below the level reached in Mauritius.8 In learning achievements in mathematics and 
reading, boys significantly underperform girls. This said, reasons for the low performance of 
primary schools include a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate teacher training.  
Notwithstanding efforts to develop technical and vocational training institutions, the low 
percentage of professionals with technical training has led to a skill gap in some sectors, 
including tourism and construction, filled by a large number of expatriate workers. The recently 
created University of Seychelles will produce its first graduates in 2012 and will help to reduce 
the skills shortage. The authorities are cognizant of the importance of a skilled population for 
stimulating national growth and employment, and have recently implemented several policy and 
institutional changes, enacting a Higher Education Bill, giving greater management autonomy to 
schools, and taking other steps. In the medium term, the Ministry of Education will be working 
towards a renewed Education Strategic Plan, aligned with the MTNDS. 
Gender equality prevails in school enrollment and other areas. There is little or no 
difference between net primary/secondary enrollment rates for male and female children; the 
Gender Parity Index was close to 1 in 2008 (World Development Indicators).9 To mitigate the 
impact of girls drop outs from school due to the teenage pregnancy issue, the Government has 
introduced a legislation permitting girls to return to school and continue their studies after 
delivery. Seychelles society is in fact largely matriarchal, and women enjoy the same legal, 
political, economic, and social rights as men. There is no officially sanctioned discrimination in 
employment, women are well represented in business, and inheritance laws do not discriminate 
against women. The participation of women in decision making processes is quite good and 
improving (table 1). In Seychelles, rape, spousal rape, and domestic abuse are criminal offenses 
punishable by a maximum 20 years' imprisonment. The law prohibits sexual harassment. 
Seychelles ratified the SADC Gender and Development Protocol, the newest gender human 
rights treaty for the sub-region, setting legally binding targets for 2015. Seychelles has a Gender 
Secretariat which has as main objective to facilitate gender mainstreaming in all policies, 
programs and activities of the Government, private sector and civil society10. A National Gender 
Management Team (NGMT) was put in place in 2009 as a platform to bring together several 
gender related institutions to finalize a national gender policy and plan of action. Although 
constitutional guarantees for equality before the law exist, the Seychelles CEDAW state party 
report (2011) reveals that the judiciary is largely gender blind and there are no sex disaggregated

data available to effectively assess the situation. In this context, the EU is providing support to 
address these constraints under its 10th EDF for Seychelles. The Government is committed to 
promote greater attention to gender issues throughout the Program activities and place the matter 
at the centre of its development. With the financial support of the Government, the Gender 
Commission (civil society gender organization) is implementing a capacity building program to 
empower Seychellois women and youth for concrete actions gearing towards full productive 
employment. Through the project it is aimed to train some 200 people, helping them to enter the 
world of work in a prepared manner.

23. 
The Seychelles enjoys a stable political system. It is a relatively young democracy, 
independent since 1976. A year after independence, a coup d’état established a one-party 
socialist state. In December 1991, President René of the Seychelles People’s Progressive Front 
announced a shift to multiparty pluralism. The first multiparty presidential election was held in 
1993, after the adoption of a new constitution. Seven presidential elections have been held since 
then. In the last election (May 2011), the incumbent president (James Michel) was reelected for 
another five-year term with a comfortable majority (55 percent of votes). With this new mandate, 
the President has renewed Seychelles’ commitment to continuing the basic direction of structural 
reforms, consolidating the economy, boosting productivity, and encouraging innovation, while 
giving special attention to the social sector (particularly to improving health services and 
maintaining the continuity and sustainability of the housing program). Parliamentary election 
was held end September 2011 and resulted in the ruling party winning almost all seats (one seat 
went to the opposition). The main opposition party boycotted this election; principally on 
arguments of electoral reforms are needed and pressing. A new opposing team stood for the 
elections got 10.8 percent of the valid votes and one seat in Parliament. Discussions on electoral 
reforms have accelerated between the electoral Commissioner and all the political parties. New 
Parliamentary election may take place once the Electoral Commissioner concludes its report and 
the recommendations implemented. However, it is unclear when this might happen, and is not 
foreseen to take place before FY14, a time at which the CPS will be reviewed. At this stage, 
changes in the direction of overall economic policy are not foreseen. The pace of implementation 
of bold economic reforms may slow down in case if a new election is precipitated. 

Public Sector Governance 

24. 
The Seychelles has made significant progress in public sector governance, yet 
requires further strengthening to leverage and reap the benefits of recent reforms.  Since 
2008, Government has implemented a series of reforms to address public sector governance 
issues, including (i) modernizing the public sector with an improved alignment of institutions 

5 

 
 
 
with their policy/service delivery mandates; (ii) rolling back the role of Government in 
commercial activities by reducing the large number of parastatals, improving their management, 
and introducing a new wage bill together with the private sector; and (iii) redefining the 
accountability structure between arms of Government responsible for service delivery.  
25. 
Public sector management reform efforts have focused on public financial 
management, human resource management and public enterprise management. In public 
financial management, the Government has approved a public finance law, developed a revised 
financial instruction and an accounting manual. Human resource management reforms include 
the downsizing of the number of public servants to 7,500 from 10,000; the review of service and 
retention schemes and adjustments to the salary structure, the removal of non-core public service 
functions to be absorbed by private firms; and restructuring of and capacity-strengthening for 
public sector institutions. Regarding public enterprises, the Government approved a detailed 
work plan for the public enterprise monitoring division, which has been created to strengthen the 
governance of public enterprises, while managing the public sector wage bill. To accelerate 
reforms, a more strategic approach to public sector governance is needed, including a solid 
analysis of the most compelling public sector governance opportunities and challenges, from 
both the supply- and the demand-side, with a view to spur growth. On this basis, a public sector 
governance strategy needs to be designed, focusing on the selection of feasible, actionable cross-
cutting reforms in high impact areas and addressing the underlying incentive framework and 
support new forms of capacity-strengthening. 
26. 
The reforms undertaken by Government have been reflected quite positively in a 
number of governance indicators. For example, of 212 countries surveyed in 2011 for the 
World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), Seychelles ranked above the 50th 
percentile for most dimensions of governance, including political stability, Government 
effectiveness, and control of corruption. The WGI for regulatory quality remains quite low, 
however, about the 25th percentile, although it is improving. In the 2011 Corruption Perception 
Index (CPI), Seychelles ranked 50th among 178 countries, down from 49th in 2010. Seychelles 
ranks 4th in the Mo Ibrahim Governance indicators among 53 sub-Saharan African countries in 
2011, down from the 2nd position that it maintained from 2008 to 2010. The performance in 
public management remains low, with a score of 52.5 and a ranking of 35. The Seychelles’ score 
on Reporters without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index improved from 16.00 in 2009 to 18.0 
in 2010, placing it 65th out of 178.  

Economic Developments 

27. 
The Seychelles’ post-independence state-led development model, proved financially 
unsustainable, and by 2008, had to confront a debt crisis. Under the early economic model, 
the public sector owned most of the corporations and productive resources and was heavily 
involved in economic activities, funded by borrowing. The state’s welfare system was extensive, 
offering virtually free education and healthcare to all, free transport for students and the elderly, 
and a munificent social protection system, albeit with elements of discretion and political 
interference. The catalyst for the debt crisis was provided by the global shocks in 2007-08, as 
commodity prices increased rapidly, leading to depleted stocks of foreign exchange and the 
public debt reached an unsustainably high level of 140 percent of GDP. As a result Standard and 
Poor’s downgraded Seychelles credit rating from B to “selective default” in July 2008.   

6 

 
 
 
28. 
The crisis reached a high point in 2008, as a result of rising energy and food prices. 
The external deficit widened further to 20.3 percent of GDP. Foreign exchange shortages became 
the norm, a number of state-owned enterprises operated well below efficiency, and foreign 
exchange reserves fell to less than one month of imports. The country’s repayment capacity 
worsened further in late 2008, as the global economic crisis hit the tourism sector. In this 
context, GDP growth dropped sharply from 9.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to –1.3 percent in 2008. 
Unable to honor a coupon payment, the authorities sought the support of the IMF to initiate debt 
restructuring discussions with the Paris Club under the 2003 Evian approach to debt relief and 
other official and private creditors, and launch a comprehensive reform program, also with 
support of other multilateral partners. Alongside comprehensive restructuring of the public debt, 
the Government quickly moved to liberalize the exchange rate in November 2008, abandoning 
an overvalued fixed dollar exchange rate and foreign exchange controls. The economic reform 
program also focused on significant and sustained tightening of fiscal policy backed by a 
reduction in public employment, reform of the monetary policy framework, and a reduction of 
the state’s role in the economy to boost private sector development. In the event, prudent 
monetary policy managed to stabilize inflation to single digits already by the end of the first 
quarter of 2009, a level at which it has since remained.11 
29. 
Fiscal performance in 2010 and 2011 were strong, exceeding expected targets. 
Driven by exceptionally high foreign direct investment (FDI) and renewed tourism, the 
Seychelles economy rebounded strongly already by late 2009. Revenues exceeded original 
projections by 18 percent, and the primary surplus exceeded the budgeted balance by 
2 percentage points of GDP, to reach 9.4 percent of GDP. The income tax base was broadened in 
2010 with the introduction of a Personal Income Tax, which replaces social security 
contributions and removes special, sector-specific tax treatments. The fiscal space created 
allowed the Government to create a stabilization fund by the end of 2010 intended to dampen the 
effects of any sudden future increase in key commodity prices. The civil service has been right 
sized and the wage grid modernized to enhance transparency and predictability of the wage bill, 
to remove the system of extensive allowances, and to foster efficiency gains. As a result, the 
wage bill fell to 6 percent of GDP in 2010 from 10.3 percent in 2007. Fiscal prudence continued 
in 2011. Primary balance as a percentage of GDP reached 4.5 percent. Due to over-performance 
of Excise and Business Tax, revenue collections were 5 percent higher than forecasted.   
30. 
The economic outlook for the medium term is broadly positive, although Seychelles 
remains vulnerable to external shocks. Real GDP forecast for 2012 has been revised 
downward to 4 percent from 4.7 percent forecasted in June 2011, reflecting the anticipated 
impact of the unfolding sovereign debt and banking crisis in Europe. Given the importance of the 
tourism sector in the economy, prospects for that sector will remain central to the Seychelles’ 
medium-term economic prospects. Although overall tourist arrivals are expected to increase in 
2012, arrivals from Europe are likely to contract by about 4 percent. Despite a 1 percent increase 
in tourist arrivals in January 2012, arrivals from Europe decreased by 6% compared to the same 
period in 2011. The same trend is observed for the first week of February. Although it is too 
early to conclude the exact causes of this decreased in arrivals, discussions with the authorities 
and private sector tend to indicate that this may be partly due to disruption caused by 

11 Inflation shot to 60 percent immediately after the foreign exchange liberalization in 2008. 

7 

 
 
 
                                                 
discontinued activities by Air Seychelles and partly due to the uncertainties in Europe12. An 
analysis of arrivals by country of residence shows significant decreases in visitors from the main 
European markets – a reduction of 32 percent from France, reduction of 38 percent from UK and 
Italy, all of which are the main market for Seychelles tourism industry. This presents a clear risk 
to Seychelles’ public finances. The country is actively promoting its tourist sites in diversified 
markets, mainly in Asia, and increasing its tourist accommodation facilities (for example, the 
average number of beds increased by 9 percent between 2008 and 2010). Having said this, it is 
important to note that the Seychelles is becoming better placed worldwide and could benefit 
from the expected growth in global tourism.13 However, being a small open island, the 
Seychelles remains sensitive to other external factors such as threats of piracy which affects 
competitiveness by increasing production costs, though higher freight charges and insurance 
premiums14, and impacts of changes in climatic conditions which may affect the fishing sector 
considerably and well as impact on the tourism sector. 
31. 
Additional depreciation of the Seychelles rupee may render debt servicing difficult. 
While the floating exchange rate regime will help cushion external shocks, the recent changes in 
the Euro Dollar parity have been a major cause of concern in Seychelles. The Seychelles rupee 
depreciated to SR 14.3 to a US dollar by end January 2012 from SR 12.7 to a US dollar in 
November 2011. Continued depreciation is likely to put additional pressure on the import bill 
and debt servicing. For the authorities to achieve the objective of bringing public debt below 50 
percent of GDP by 2018, the fiscal consolidation path should be maintained, if not strengthened. 
The authorities realize that the country is not enjoying the same set of circumstances as during 
the 2008 financial crisis when the country attained major debt relief, and therefore the fiscal 
space to cushion the potential effects of the European crisis is limited. In this context, the 
Government has decided to intensify and accelerate reforms with a focus on spending more 
efficiently to increase resilience. To ease fiscal pressure, the authorities decided to downsize the 
loss-making national airline. To maintain the fiscal sustainability path, other major short to 
medium term structural reforms in the public sector will include increase in utility tariffs to cost 
recovery rates, restructuring state-owned housing finance company, public finance management 
reforms and improved financial governance.  
32. Medium-term policies will be geared to sustain progress on improvement in macro-
economic indicators. The fiscal policy will pursue a full return to debt sustainability aiming at 
reducing debt to GDP ratio to 50 percent by 2018. Progress in debt restructuring and 
improvements in debt management led to a more sustainable debt level. IMF’s debt sustainability 
analysis projects a long-run path toward sustainability, provided the Seychelles maintains sound 
policies and severe external shocks do not throw its debt off path.15 The current account deficit is 
expected to decline in the medium term, in line with FDI. Balance of payments estimates for 

12 At this stage the team does not have data on tourist earnings for January 2012 and forward bookings for the first 
quarter. 
13 According to a World Trade Organization forecast, international tourist arrivals are projected to increase by some 
4-5 percent in 2011 and by an average of around 4.1 percent annually until 2020, with all regions, except Europe and 
the Americas, growing faster than 5 percent annually. 
14 To fight piracy, the Government allocated US$3 million (0.7 percent of the national budget) in 2011, an increase 
of 16 percent over 2010. In view of the increasing piracy risk assessed in April 2011 for the Indian Ocean region, 
shipping lines increased the Piracy Surcharge on Indian Ocean services. For example, one company increased it 
from € 67 per twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) to € 105/TEU.

2011 show a current account deficit to 22.3 percent of GDP compared to 9.8 percent of GDP in 
2009, reflecting an expansion in imports in line with the recovery of the domestic economy, 
which was stronger than the smaller uptick in export earnings, and significant growth in FDI 
boosting imports. FDI inflows increased from a deficit of 9.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and 22.7 
percent in 2010. Going forward, the balance of payments though comfortably financed through 
FDI remains vulnerable to rising import costs and potential declines in tourist arrivals. The rate 
of inflation is estimated to be around 5 percent for 2011 on account of rising international prices 
for food and energy, but is expected to decline to about 3.5 percent for 2012. Monetary policy 
should remain cautious and keep inflation under control. Seychelles faces a persistent liquidity 
overhang and accumulated excess reserves by domestic financial institutions, reflecting in part 
higher than anticipated domestic debt servicing over 2009-10

GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS 

33. 
Since 2008 the Government has undertaken major structural reforms to secure 
macroeconomic stability and create conditions for sustainable, private sector-led growth. 
The primary reforms involved a complete shift to a liberalized foreign exchange regime (with the 
Central Bank intervening only to smooth out volatility), a significant tightening of the role and 
size of the state through sales of state assets and down-sizing of the state workforce, and public 
debt restructuring.  
34. 
The Government of Seychelles is currently drafting its new medium-term national 
development strategy (MTNDS). The core aim of the MTNDS is to reduce Seychelles 
vulnerability and to provide the basis for long term sustainable development. The overarching 
goal of Seychelles fiscal policy aims first to put public finances on a sustainable path, while 
creating the fiscal space to raise public investment and support targeted social safety nets. The 
five main goals of the MTNDS are: (i) to address development planning for vital infrastructure 
and utility needs; (ii) to develop a strong human resource base by improving basic education and 
productivity; (iii) to improve economic infrastructure through modernized ICT infrastructure 
(including greater connectivity and bandwidth); (iv) to improve food security and the business 
and investment environment by creating a transparent, predictable trading system and 
diversifying the economy (by developing the services sector); and (v) to further develop national 
statistics to improve evidence-based policy making.    
35. 
The Government is aware of the challenges and is committed to bold reforms. There 
is broad acceptance within Seychelles of the need to speed structural reforms that will support 
private sector development and to redefine the role of the Government to ensure that Seychelles 

9 

 
 
 
  
reaps long-lasting benefits from the reforms of the past three years. The reform program tries to 
strike a balance between measures necessary for sustainable growth and measures to improve the 
welfare of the poor and families in lower income brackets. It aims at further improving public 
sector efficiency, creating a more business friendly environment, and improving resilience.  
36. 
In the last two years, several measures have been implemented to improve public 
sector efficiency. These include improving public finance management by increasing discipline 
in expenditure, strengthening revenue collection, and raise the efficiency and transparency of 
public finance. The Government’s objective is to stabilize tax revenue to a lower level, consistent 
with its strategy to reduce the weight of Government in the economy, and intends to improve 
operational efficiency of state owned enterprises. Efficiency gains while reducing fiscal pressure 
may also provide opportunities for re-allocation of resources to better uses. The Government also 
intends to conduct a strategic assessment of public entities to address duplication in the delivery 
of essential public services, and in case needed, divest from nonstrategic entities that do not 
serve policy purposes. The Government intends to further improve PFM and transparency by 
introducing policy/program-based budgeting (PBB) embedded in an improved Medium-Term 
Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This will help in improving fiscal planning and accountability, 
and promote good governance in the public sector. The Government intends to address existing 
PFM weaknesses, especially those set out in PEFA 2011 that relate to weaknesses in multi-
annual budgeting planning and classification; execution of capital projects; accounting, recording 
and reporting; and Parliament oversight. To undertake more meaningful reforms, the authorities 
will focus on deepening and broadening outcome focused reforms to particularly (i) 
institutionalize the fiscal discipline, improve development of policy and performance oriented 
budget by strengthening planning at sector level, making the budget strategy paper more policy 
focused, and link capital to recurrent budget, (ii) further improve budget execution and reporting 
processes by improving effectiveness of capital commitment control and improving quality of 
financial statements, and (iii) strengthen institutions by legislating the roles of the Internal Audit 
Division and the National Audit Committee and strengthen the Financial and Public Accounts 
Committee.   
37. 
There remain significant gaps in the availability and management of public 
infrastructure. The Seychelles’ water supply capacity is unsustainable in the long term. About 
40 percent of the water supply is estimated to be lost due to pipe leakages. In the last two years, 
due to exceptionally long dry periods. Water was rationed for about five months each year (June 
to October) and, depending on the available water volume, is delivered by tankers in certain 
areas. The Government intends to invest massively in this sector to address the challenges16. 
Annual increases in demand of 6.5 percent are adding to the pressure on the limited water 
supply. As regards power, the high fuel content of energy costs is a source of efficiency and 
financial problems. Ninety percent of the primary energy supply comes from imported fuel, 
which accounts for 23 percent of total merchandise imports. Fuel price variations are not always 
passed on to the consumer, causing the Public Utility Company to depend on subsidies from the 
state. The Government intends to revise the utility tariffs upwards to the market determined cost 
recovery rates and introduce systems of indexation and adjustments. As regards to 
telecommunications, mobile penetration is high, but costs are high and bandwidth capacity 
remains limited, hampering the development of electronic transactions and services (such as e-

16 Agreements have already been reached for financial assistance with AfDB and EIB, based on the water sector 
master plan

38. 

payments) that facilitate business. The development of this infrastructure is a vital step for 
Seychelles as it moves to deepen its financial services and other service sectors. Strengthening 
the legal and institutional environment for the telecommunications sector and supporting 
regional investment projects could reduce telecommunications costs and enhance ICT capacity. 
The submarine cable that is being laid will connect Seychelles more efficiently to the global 
telecommunications network through Dar-es-Salaam and enable it to move away from the 
current restrictive satellite-based technology.  
The Government is keen on improving its social protection system. The current 
system of welfare assistance absorbs considerable staff resources, program monitoring is 
rudimentary and requirements beneficiaries to seek employment are not strictly enforced. The 
assistance could benefit from efforts to strengthen evidenced-based policy making. The 
authorities plan to introduce activation measures for beneficiaries of welfare assistance to reduce 
welfare dependency and work disincentives. Clear and measurable performance indicators are 
needed for all programs and corporate functions.  The authorities also plan to upgrade to enhance 
program efficiency and support better monitoring and evaluation. The objective would be to 
develop an MIS that provides more user friendly access to the range of modules required by a 
cash transfer system (e.g., application, targeting, enrollment, verification, payment, compliance, 
recertification, household changes, appeals, referrals). The Government also aims to streamline 
and tighten disability benefits, and reduce incentives to remain disabled. The objective is to 
ensure that most of the beneficiaries of disability benefits remain employed or return to work as 
soon as possible. For children with disabilities, the Government wants to ensure educational 
inclusion to enable their labor force participation in adulthood. In view of the recent impact of 
piracy on local fishers, given that they are not going too far at sea for catch and some of them 
have relocate fishing activities to areas that are less productive and are turning over-exploited 
due to the activity concentration, the Government intends to introduce an emergency assistance 
scheme. The Government also intends to professionalize, give responsibility and make 
accountable the fishers in the sector management and the social welfare system. Government 
also intends to tackle the fiscal risks that Seychelles Pension Fund poses. The fund is partially 
funded, defined benefit system offering approximately a 50 percent replacement rate which is 
clearly not sustainable and accumulating significant uncovered liabilities that would require 
Government transfers in the near future. Government also plans to address the very high 
administrative expenses that the fund incurs - 20 percent of contributions. 
39. 
The Government places special attention on the youth to better prepare them for 
the labor market.  As such, an Apprenticeship Scheme is in place to develop young people with 
required skills and qualifications to join the labor market. Apprentices are placed in organization 
where they receive on the job training for specific period during which they attend the 
polytechnic or any institution center or any institution center for the theoretical input of one day 
per week and three to four weeks full time during school holidays. A strict monitoring system is 
maintained by the organization centre of skills Development and the Polytechnic. A Youth 
Training Scheme is also in place. This scheme aims at training unskilled young school leavers, 
mainly girls. Trainings under this scheme are district based, aimed at youth who are identified as 
having the potential and are interested in acquiring skills in sewing/craft work and others related 
activities in view to start their own business. Also students studying at polytechnic schools are 
entitled to bursaries, contingent on household’s income. Finally an on-the-job training scheme 
(called Refund Fiscal Incentive) is in place whereby the Government and the employer share the 

11 

 
 
 
wage bill on a 40/60 percent basis. Arrangement is made by the authorities to place a candidate 
in a workplace for a definite period time, not exceeding one year.  
40. 
Emphasis on education, besides skills development, remains the highest priority of 
the Government. To meet the human resources requirements of the economy, Seychelles 
promotes vocational, managerial and service skills, and since 2008, Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) and tertiary education have been much emphasized. The National 
Education and Training Strategy Committee 2008 (NETSC) made recommendations to 
“transform” the education and training system.  Several of the recommendations have been 
successfully implemented, but due to capacity constraints and lack of planning culture as well as 
mobility of leadership, some of the recommendations remain to be implemented.  A number of 
reforms are being implemented in the education sector with the support of UNESCO and the EU.  
The authorities’ aim to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the Educational Planning, Policy 
and Management Processes, set up an Education Information Management System (EMIS), 
develop a medium to long term education sector strategy, and put further emphasis on 
development from early childhood, while at the same time addressing challenges in the education 
sector mentioned in the section ‘social context’ of this document.  
41. 
Fiscal risk management strategies will be put in place, given high and increasing 
vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Rising commodity prices, especially food and fuel, carry 
high risks for Seychelles, which almost entirely depends on imports of these products. This 
exposure is exacerbated by natural risks, as well as threats of piracy. In particular, weather 
variability strongly impacts tuna catches and the near-term economic contribution of the tuna 
industry. Because shocks affect households as well as, directly or indirectly, fiscal accounts, the 
Government wants to improve fiscal risk assessment in the face of different types of risk. To 
insure against short-term price upswings, market-based approaches (such as hedging) will be 
considered for some commodities. The Government also plans to develop a Master Plan for 
Disaster Risk Management which will integrate all the existing contingency plans and build on 
the planned geological risk assessment at the national level, and planned community 
preparedness plans, to strengthen its capacity to respond to adverse natural events in a fiscally 
sustainable manner. Seychelles could enhance its ability to cope with increased climatic 
variability through mechanisms like early warning systems and better coordination with other 
agencies, such as metrological center. Social safety nets could be tied to early warning systems 
and scaled up when needed. 
42. 
The centerpiece of the effort to improve competitiveness is to make the regulatory 
framework more transparent and less burdensome. The Seychelles is ranked at 103 out of 
183 countries in the Doing Business 2012 indicators, up from 109 in 2011. A range of 
administrative procedures will be revised. A review of procedures for issuing Gainful 
Occupational Permits (GOP) should streamline approval for foreign workers by setting out 
transparent guidelines and criteria; customs clearance procedures will be improved through the 
introduction of risk management and post-clearance audit procedures; procedures for registering 
a business will also be streamlined, and a new bankruptcy regime will ease the exit of 
unsustainable businesses. A credit information bureau will be created to improve credit 
information. Reforms in the judiciary will be undertaken and particularly specialized commercial 
court will be set up and court rules and procedure reviewed to shorten the lengthy process for 
resolving disputes in commercial cases.  

12 

 
 
 
43. 
A vibrant private sector relies on a developed and transparent financial market. To 
further develop the financial system, the Government intends to establish a Credit Information 
System (CIS), set up a commercial court, establish Seychelles Stock Exchange, further develop 
mortgage finance, strengthen the insurance regulatory framework, and improve the infrastructure 
to introduce Electronic Clearing House and Electronic Funds Transfer and Real Time Gross 
Settlement system. The introduction of the CIS will help in creating a more efficient risk-pricing 
mechanism for financial products, and the establishment of the court is expected to reduce the 
significant backlog of commercial cases due to capacity constraints and speed up resolutions of 
financial disputes. Both the CIS and the Commercial Court complement the Government’s 
efforts in improving the overall business climate. With the objective of reducing the role of the 
state in commercial activities and facilitate financial sector development, the Government 
intends to redefine the role of the Housing Finance Corporation (HFC) such that commercial 
banks will be called upon to play a prominent role in housing finance and mortgage products. 
Regulations of new financial products (leasing, hire purchase, Islamic banking) will be 
introduced that should help deepen capital markets, and the efficiency of the insurance sector 
will be improved. 
44. 
Further improvements in the public sector would benefit from addressing some 
underlying governance challenges. Given the weak opposition in parliament, and weaknesses 
in the judiciary to hold the state accountable, there is a need to strengthen checks and balances to 
fully leverage the potential of on-going and planned reforms. Beyond reforms on PFM, human 
resource management and state-owned enterprises, there is a need to strengthen an integrated 
strategy and package of reforms on the supply-and demand-side. On the supply-side, the 
Government intends to further strengthen the justice sector by improving management systems, 
such as e-justice systems, linked to the overall e-Government systems to enable the justice sector 
to fulfill its oversight mandate. The Government’s commitment to fighting corruption and 
building a more independent judiciary has been publicly iterated, and the Government is 
committed to the design and implementation of a strategy and concrete policy measures. On the 
demand side of governance, civil society is broad and diverse and contributes to design and 
implementation of Government programs. Government intends to further deepen its partnership 
with civil society so that the latter can play an enhanced role in promoting accountability and 
transparency. Civil society, including the media benefit from freedom of expression, although 
citizen would benefit from being further involved in the formulation of public policy, and 
independent observers of 
the presidential and parliamentary elections have provided 
recommendations for improvements in looser control of private media. The Government intends 
to study further the recommendations and take necessary actions. 
45. 
In case further exploration confirms viable oil extraction and the Government 
decides to start production, it has expressed commitment to good governance and 
transparency. The Government has expressed intention to adopt a best practice petroleum 
revenue management law which will set a high standard for control on petroleum revenues and 
which will focus on creating mechanisms to promote transparency in the management of oil 
revenue. The Government has also indicated its willingness to increase transparency and 
accountability by implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process. 
The Government also recognizes the need to establish strong institutions, with the necessary 
capacity to ensure that the petroleum sector is successfully managed. As there is neither a fully 
functional petroleum regulatory authority, nor a fully developed system of regulations that would 
apply to petroleum operations, this will require a significant program of capacity building 
13 

 
 
 
assistance. To mitigate the risk of Dutch disease and unstable budgetary pattern and economic 
performance, the Government is considering the eventual establishment of a petroleum wealth 
fund. However, the nature of the fund and how to integrate it with the overall fiscal policy and 
institutional framework is still at an early stage of discussion. Since Seychelles is largely a 
tourism-based economy, the authorities are concerned with the potential impact that oil 
production may have on the environment, and would have in place legislations in relation to 
environmental assessments associated with oil related activities so as to maintain high 
international standards of environmental practices.   

IV 

THE WORLD BANK PROGRAM AND THE DONOR COMMUNITY  

46. 
The last Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Seychelles covered FY10-11. The ISN 
defined the Bank’s reengagement and partnership with the Republic of Seychelles after a 17-year 
hiatus and aimed to generate a robust policy dialogue. The ISN focused on three key objectives: 
(i) supporting the economic stabilization program; (ii) removing constraints to private sector 
development; and (iii) addressing the challenge of climate change and natural disaster risk 
management. The ISN set out the planned lending and non-lending activities and its intended 
results for FY10-11. The ISN was successfully implemented with the support of the Bank. 
47. 
The ISN objectives were supported with a mix of demand-driven advisory activities, 
analytical work, and financing. Bank operations included grants, lending, and fee-based 
advisory services. The lending program included two DPOs amounting to US$18 million. The 
first DPO aimed at helping Seychelles establish a stable and sustainable fiscal stance through 
fiscal adjustment underpinned by public administration and civil service reform and a reduction 
of the state’s role in commercial activities. The operation also supported establishment of a 
targeted social safety net. The second DPO supported reforms to improve public sector 
effectiveness and the business environment. The Bank provided financing of about US$4.5 
million through four Trust Fund grants. Two of the four projects remain active (see Box 1).  

Box 1: Seychelles Trust Fund Projects 
National Disaster Preparedness and Response Project (P111474) [Grant amount: US$ 900,000]. This project to 
build capacity for disaster preparedness and response in Seychelles involves several components: capacity building, 
early warning systems, emergency planning, and national and community disaster preparedness. The project closed 
on November 30, 2011. Disbursement by the closing date was US$ 430,481.  
Transport Infrastructure Project (P106471) [Grant amount: US$ 1,960,000]. This project financed the repair of 
one of three artisanal fishing quays damaged by the December 2004 tsunami with a view to helping boat-owners, 
fishers, and traders to improve livelihoods constrained by the tsunami. It also improved the sanitary conditions and 
marketability of fisheries products. The project closed on June 30, 2011.  
Public Administration Reform and Fiscal Impact Capacity Building Project (P112358) [Grant amount: US$ 
425,800]. This project enhances the capacity of the Government of Seychelles to effectively manage the 
implementation of the Public Sector Reform Program. The closing date for the project is September 25, 2013. 
Disbursement as at November 10, 2011 was nil.   Contract to a supplier who will deliver all project activities has 
been negotiated and is in the process of being finalized. 
Building Statistical Capacity Project (P116997) [Grant amount: US$ 376,200]. This project aims to improve the 
organizational structure of the National Statistics Bureau and build its capacity to develop and produce new 
economic data series as part of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics. The project consists of three 
parts: addressing deficiencies in key macroeconomic data, improving social statistics, and strengthening institutional 
capacity. The closing date for the project is November 30, 2012. Disbursement as at November 10, 2011 was 
200,000.

Provision for technical assistance in areas identified by the Government has been 
provided under a Reimbursable Agreement for Advisory Services framework. This 
framework is still active. Assistance fell under three broad areas: social protection, public 
enterprise, and health financing. In social protection, the Bank supported Government efforts to 
improve efficiency in service delivery and advises on policy options with respect to enhancing 
the targeting system. In health financing, the Bank was involved in building capacity for 
National Health Accounts and will support the Government in revising and costing its medium 
term health strategy. In the public enterprise area, the Bank supported drafting of the Board 
Appointment and Remuneration Policies and will support a capacity building exercise to 
improve monitoring and evaluation by public enterprises (PEs) and the Public Enterprise 
Management Division (PEMD).   
49. 
IFC reengaged with the Republic of Seychelles in 2010. In 2010, IFC made a 
commitment for a US$20 million senior loan in a hotel project. Due to issues associated with the 
lease of the land IFC disbursement did not taken place. IFC and the Government of Seychelles 
(GoS) were engaged in discussions related to the privatization model to be adopted for two 
majority-owned Government banks, Seychelles Savings Bank (SSB) and Nouvobanq. In both 
cases, IFC advised on a three -steps approach: (i) divesting a substantial minority to clients and 
private institutional investors (ii) inviting a strategic partner to acquire a majority stake (iii) issue 
new shares to shore up capital base, where strategic partner will retain majority stake. In the case 
of SSB, a substantial minority has been sold to the clients of the bank and the public but progress 
has been halted. In the case of Nouvobanq, GoS informed IFC that it will need to re-think the 
approach for introducing a strategic partner. The In November 2011, GoS and IFC have signed 
an Energy Efficient and Clean Production (EE/CP) Service Agreement. Under this agreement, 
IFC will undertake to carry out a study to recommend the renewable energy technology best 
suited both in terms of technical and financial viability for households, SMEs and unincorporated 
business entities. IFC will also have discussions with commercial banks to find and propose the 
appropriate lending mechanism to encourage them to lend to households, small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs), and unincorporated businesses to invest in EE/CP goods, appliances, and 
equipment. Banks will also be offered technical advisory support to adopt the methodology and 
process best suited for the targeted borrowers. IFC is also supporting the Central Bank in 
reviewing the new leasing legislation which is currently under preparation. IFC’s engagement in 
Seychelles also aims to bring about capital market reforms and promote private sector 
development by improving the country’s investment climate by simplifying administrative 
processes, reducing the cost of doing business, and further attracting FDI. IFC's Advisory 
Services and the Bank are jointly working with the Government to address critical components 
of the Doing Business Surveys. Currently the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA) has no active projects in Seychelles. 
The Bank’s program has been coordinated closely with the IMF since 2008. A Joint 
Management Action Plan ensures complementarity in Bank and IMF activities. The IMF has 
supported the authorities’ efforts to fundamentally reform the economy and address severe 
internal and external macroeconomic imbalances, initially with a Stand-By Arrangement for 200 
percent of quota approved on November 14, 2008. That arrangement was followed by a three-
year program under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for 225 percent of quota (about US$31 
million), approved on December 18, 2009. Building on the success of the Stand-By 
Arrangement, the EFF-supported program aims at consolidating macroeconomic stability and 
addressing deep-rooted structural imbalances over the medium term, by strengthening public 
15 

50. 

 
 
 
financial management, institutionalizing higher governance standards, rationalizing the public 
sector, reforming taxation, bolstering the financial system, and improving the business 
environment. The fourth review of the program was completed in January 2012, and the program 
remained on track. The EFF program will come to an end in December 2012. The Government 
has expressed interest in maintaining a close relationship with the Fund post EFF expiry, 
probably through a precautionary arrangement, but formal discussions has not yet started 
between the authorities and the Fund. The Bank and IMF teams have maintained a close 
cooperation throughout.    
51. 
Seychelles’ multilateral and bilateral donors provide support to a wide range of areas 
(see Annex 2). Together with the Bank Group, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the 
European Union (EU), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) are the most active 
multilateral partners in Seychelles. The first formal donor coordination meeting lead by the 
Government was held in October 2011 when the Government presented to all donors the MTNDS. 
The donor community tries, to the extent possible, to meet at least twice a year in Seychelles 
during the Fund’s EFF review missions. This provides the opportunity to coordinate activities of 
the various donors. The EU and UNDP covers Seychelles from the Office based in Mauritius and 
the Bank’s office in Mauritius facilitate further dialogues among these institutions. Multilateral 
institutions have played a key role in supporting Seychelles’ reforms since the 2008 crisis, with 
programs in the areas of economic policy, fiscal reform, public finance management, institutional 
development, social protection, and infrastructure development. Going forward, the AfDB will 
support Seychelles to enhance the environment for private sector activity and investment, as well 
as to improve the competitiveness of the country through investment lending programs 
(submarine cable, water supply and sanitation, mariculture development, line of credit for SMEs, 
institutional support project), and non-lending technical assistance (infrastructure action plan, PPP 
framework, human resource development strategy and statistical capacity program). The UNDP’s 
medium term engagement is anchored in the on-going macro- economic reform program and will 
help develop and strengthen national capacities of institutions and individuals in the public sector 
and civil society to promote good governance, environmental protection, energy efficiency, water 
resources management, climate change adaptation and poverty alleviation.  The European Union 
is providing support to Seychelles on regional integration, trade facilitation, and corporate 
governance and to mitigate the risks of piracy attacks, in the context of its regional program. 
Specific to Seychelles, the EU has an education budget support operation to help in the 
preparation and the implementation of the Education Medium Term Strategy (with a focus on 
both basic and post-basic education up to the secondary level) in order to improve the alignment 
between the country's training and manpower needs in an evolving national, regional and 
international environment. Bilateral cooperation with Abu Dhabi, China, Kuwait, France, and 
India has led to advances in various areas, including the fight against piracy, efforts to combat 
HIV/AIDS and drug abuse, improvements in health, building institutional capacity, assisting the 
fisheries sector, and supporting improvements in critical infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, 
the airport, and road networks. The United States Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management, Regulation & Enforcement (BOEMRE) has also engaged and plans to 
continue a program of technical assistance to Seychelles authorities, particularly with respect to 
their environmental and petroleum operation monitoring responsibilities.

V  WORLD BANK PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A 

Lessons from ISN 

52. 
The Bank’s engagement as outlined in the FY10-11 ISN was fully relevant in 
supporting the country’s program of reforms in the last two years. The engagement during 
the ISN period has been successful. The main instrument for Bank’s engagement was two stand 
alone single tranche DPOs. Both the DPOs have been rated satisfactory in their completion 
reports. The areas of reforms supported by these operations are highlighted in table 3 below. The 
medium term second generation reform agenda for the Government is clear. Building on the 
reforms already implemented, the Government’s agenda going forward further deepens and 
broadens areas of reforms.  
53. 
Engagement during the ISN provides important lessons that have informed the 
preparation of the proposed strategy. These include the need to ensure: (i) alignment with 
Government priorities; (ii) strong coordination with development partners; (iii) appropriate 
timing and flexibility; and (iv) a realistic assessment of implementation capacity.

54. 
Alignment of the Bank’s assistance to the Government’s medium-term priorities 
proved effective. The Government was clear in the direction, objectives and priorities of its 
medium-term reform program, which was guided by upstream policy dialogue with the IMF, 
Bank, and other development partners, and underpinned by analytical works. Leadership and 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
political commitment have been critical factors in the successful implementation of reforms.  
Momentum of reform remained strong during the ISN period. Learning from this lesson, the 
proposed CPS is aligned to the Medium Term National Development Strategy of the country, 
which sets clear direction on the objectives of the Government in the medium term.  
55. Knowledge products and technical assistance to guide the reform agenda proved 
crucial. Given limited capacity on the Government’s side to undertake economic and sector 
work (ESW), the IMF, Bank, and other development partners supported the Government through 
analytical inputs that helped define and sequence the reform agenda. The Bank’s ESW was 
considered to be of high quality and has informed policy changes. Some of the economic and 
sector studies were produced jointly by the Government and development partners, which helped 
build capacity within ministries and agencies for critical analysis, for benchmarking in relation to 
practices in other countries, and for defining their own weaknesses. The Government sees 
enormous value addition in building local capacity to undertake ESW on its own, going forward. 
Reforms have been the most successful in areas of continuous engagement, and thorough TA and 
ESWs by partners – for example in budget management where the PEFA rating improved from a 
D to an A. During the implementation of the program outlined in this CPS, the Bank will 
emphasize on capacity building, knowledge sharing (S-S cooperation and peer leaning events), 
technical assistance to close skills gap, and joint production and dissemination of AAAs.   
56. 
Donor coordination and flexibility reduce administrative costs to the Government. 
Donor coordination helped harmonize policy dialogue and support to the Government, and 
proved essential to avoid duplication of assistance. The Bank’s flexible approach has also added 
to the considerable progress made. It is expected that donor coordination will be further 
strengthened in this new strategy to ensure continued success.  The Bank will explore 
possibilities for joint analytical works. The Bank and the AfDB has agreed to try and conduct the 
Mid-term review of their respective CPS together. This strategy has been produced in close 
collaboration with the IMF, and these two institutions will continue to work closely to support 
the Seychelles. 
57. 
Close supervision and knowledge of Bank rules helps to smooth implementation. 
After the Bank’s extended period of disengagement from Seychelles, knowledge of Bank 
procedures was limited to the authorities, which combined with the limited local capacity, at first 
constrained the pace of implementation. Capacity at all levels is an issue in the country, and the 
Bank should realistically assess implementation capacity to be effective. The Bank plans to make 
use of its missions in the country to conduct seminars which may build capacity to better 
understand and implement Bank’s FM and procurement rules.  

B 

A Strategic Approach 

58. 
Seychelles has demonstrated that it is committed to addressing the challenges it now 
faces. The authorities, at the highest level, are dedicated to implement the second-generation 
reforms needed to attain a sustainable high-growth path and increase the welfare of the country’s 
population. To make this possible and building on the momentum of reforms undertaken to date, 
the Government wants to create an environment of solid institutions and a supportive regulatory 
framework for business, with the support of the Fund, the Bank and other multilateral 
development partners. Yet, going forward, some reforms, especially those towards improving 
efficiency in public enterprises should be expected to be politically sensitive and test the 
Government’s resolve. Moreover, while the first phase of reforms, focused on exiting from 

18 

 
 
 
imbalances and imparting a new strategic direction, was driven mostly by the Ministry of 
Finance, there is now a need to broaden ownership to the Government at large. 
59. 
The Government highly values the support it has received from the Bank during the 
ISN period, and has requested continued support for moving forward. Over the past three 
years of engagement, the Bank has built a very good relationship with the Government, both at 
the technical and policy-making level. As Seychelles embarks on bolder reforms in critical areas 
in which the Bank has a comparative advantage as a knowledge institution, the Government has 
requested the Bank’s continued assistance. Building on this strong relationship, the Bank’s 
strategic approach will be structured around the two pillars and foundation of its Africa Strategy, 
a strategic approach that resonates particularly well at the current juncture of economic direction 
in the Seychelles—the two pillars being (i) Competitiveness and Employment, and (ii) 
Vulnerability and Resilience—and the one foundation being Governance and Public Sector 
Capacity.  
60. 
The Bank’s engagement is selective and complements other partner’s support. The 
Bank’s strategic approach takes into account the Government’s medium term reform program 
and the areas of engagement by other partners. As such, the number of areas that the Bank covers 
is limited. In areas where other donors are taking the lead, the Bank will step in as a partner as 
and when required. In areas where the Bank has comparative advantages, it will take the lead in 
assisting the Government to implement the reforms. The same selectivity filter has been used in 
deciding about Bank-led AAAs. In what follows, the areas of engagement are highlighted in 
some more details. The complementarities between Bank’s engagement and other partners’ 
engagement are also pointed out.  

Competitiveness and Employment Pillar 

61. 
The investment climate needs to be strengthened to harness private sector growth. 
The private sector has led economic growth in Seychelles. It employs 70 percent of the labor 
force. The two strategic sectors are tourism and fisheries, which accounted for about 20 percent 
of GDP in 2004, now account for 30 percent of GDP and employ 32 percent of the labor force. 
Even so, a number of factors constrain private sector growth and limit its potential to generate 
employment, create wealth, and reduce poverty. To ensure sustainable private sector led growth, 
the (i) infrastructure bottlenecks, (ii) still poor business environment and (iii) inadequate 
domestic human resources and limited technical skills need to be addressed in an accelerated 
manner:  
62. 
Bottlenecks in infrastructure remain critical constraints for the country. In the ICT 
sector, the AfDB is supporting the Government to improve its infrastructure with the objective of 
reducing telecommunication costs and increase bandwidth capacity. The Government is 
currently laying a submarine cable to connect to the world cheaper and quicker. In the utilities 
sector, crucial policy measures and institutional reforms are needed to address inefficiencies. 
These include improved utility management, greater cost recovery, and better asset management. 
In the water sector, the Government has developed a water sector development plan and the 
AfDB and the EIB are supporting the Government to implement this development plan. The 
Government is also discussing with other bilateral partners to support in this area. The Bank’s 
program would emphasize sustainable energy and fiscal sustainability in utilities. The Bank will 
take the lead in supporting the Government’s reform program in the energy sector. In this area, 
the Government’s objective is to introduce energy efficiency and develop renewable sources of 

19 

 
 
 
energy. The Seychelles Energy Commission has prepared an Energy Bill which has already been 
approved by Cabinet (to be enacted in 2012). This Commission is working with UNDP to 
develop a legal framework to encourage private sector investment in Independent Power 
Productions (IPPs) and auto-producers. The development of sustainable/renewable energy 
sources would not only protect the environment but also reduce the import bill and fiscal 
vulnerability. The IFC is supporting the country to implement sustainable and cost-effective 
Resources Efficiency (REF) measures, including Energy Efficiency (EE), Renewable Energy 
(RE) and Cleaner Production (CP) by promoting the adoption of EE/CP to residential goods, 
appliances, and equipment. By the end of the CPS period, at least one follow-on project will 
have benefited from the EE/CP project, and assessments for viable REF technologies will have 
been completed for 5 technologies. To support this work, the IFC will undertake a study on 
constraints to growth and development of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the 
residential sector of Seychelles. To help the Government to implement cost recovery rates for 
utilities in order to ensure long-term sustainability of the utility company and reduce fiscal 
pressure on the national budget, the Bank will support in the development of a tariff study. This 
study will provide a few options to the authorities on tariff levels and structure, as well as 
welfare impact on the poor and vulnerable of the different options. The Bank will also support 
the Government in the implementation of the option decided by the Government. Along the same 
line, the Bank will also support in designing and implementing appropriate indexation and cost-
adjustment mechanisms and related tools to allow transparent future tariff adjustments. It is 
expected that governance will be strengthened and independence of the utility company attained 
and interference of the state in setting up tariffs will be substantially reduced. The Seychelles 
does not yet have a strategy for the energy sector. The Bank will provide assistance to develop an 
energy sector strategy, based on feasible alternatives of renewable energy, implementation costs 
and the required investments, and an action plan for implementation. Given the high external 
debt for Seychelles, the margin for huge public investment in renewable energy is limited and the 
authorities would support investment by private producers. The Bank will support the 
Government in the development of tools and capacity to evaluate purchasing power agreements 
(PPAs) of independent power producers (IPPs). The Government intends to explore potential for 
diversification in the tourism industry. Tourism from Africa and Asia remains limited and could 
be diversified towards emerging markets, particularly those with larger growth prospects, such as 
Russia, India, and China. Wider air access and the creation of a larger common aviation area 
with neighboring countries may be helpful in achieving this goal. At the request of the 
Government, the Bank, as part of its ESW on regional air access policy, will prepare policy note 
specifically on Seychelles. In light of the long term outlook of the tourism industry and the 
potential for Seychelles, the uncertainties in Europe, and the recent decisions of the Government 
(i.e. the cancellation of all long-haul routes for Air Seychelles, and the co-management 
agreement with Etihad Airways) this note will focus on the possible strategic role for Air 
Seychelles.  The Bank will be responsive to the client by providing more such just--in-time 
demand driven support during the CPS period.  
63. 
An improved financial, regulatory and institutional environment is needed to boost 
private sector growth. Cumbersome regulations and red tape discourage the emergence of a 
vibrant and diversified private sector. A range of reforms need to be pursued to make the 
regulatory environment more transparent and less burdensome. The IFC Advisory Services and 
the Bank will work closely to support the Government in its objective of improving business 
regulatory environment and improving access to justice for the business and private sectors and 

20 

 
 
 
speeding up hearings for commercial cases. In this context, the Bank has initiated a technical 
assistance program on improving the business environment. Procedures for registration of 
business will be simplified and streamlined, and an online single point of entry for registration 
that combines business registration, and registration for taxes and as an employer at the Revenue 
Commission will be set up. The goal is to register companies within a day. In the judiciary, a 
commercial division under the Supreme Court will be set up, and court rules and procedures will 
be reviewed to shorten process for resolving disputes in commercial cases (this is also part of the 
governance agenda of the Bank’s support, see below). The goal of the authorities in the medium 
term is to reduce substantially the number of backlog commercial cases, as well as reduce the 
time line for processing new cases. This technical assistance of the Bank will also support the 
Government to adapt labor regulations to the rapidly changing economic landscape by reviewing 
regulations on redundancy and severance pay (these regulations generate considerable 
administrative costs and uncertainty for employers about the ability to lay off workers when 
necessary and force compensation payments even to employees who terminate contracts of their 
own free will). Besides the business environment, the authorities want to create an enabling 
financing environment to expand support to SMEs. In this context, the AfDB will be supporting 
the Government by providing a line of credit for SMEs development. There are plans for the EIB 
to provide technical assistance to help the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS) improve its 
risk-management framework to sustain the government decision to refocus its lending activities 
to SMEs. The authorities will further develop the financial/capital market. The objectives are to 
increase competition among financial institutions and to facilitate private sector development. In 
this context, the authorities have initiated several measures and actions. A credit information 
bureau to enhance assessments of creditworthiness will be launched and the Seychelles Stock 
Exchange will be established in 2012. The Bank will support to further develop the mortgage 
market and broaden sustainable access to housing finance. The Bank will help the authorities to 
design and implement a smart subsidy strategy which will be based on three building blocks: a 
demand-side subsidy, a financing package that combines the subsidy with market-priced loans, 
and home ownership savings scheme. The goal is to increase the relative share of real estate 
mortgage through banks compared to the state-owned Housing Finance Company (HFC) 
lending. This is in line with the Government’s aim of reducing the role of the state in commercial 
activities and helps strengthen the institutional framework necessary for the private sector to 
function. The Bank through the FIRST Initiative will provide technical assistance in this area. 
Through the FIRST Initiative, the Bank is also providing technical assistance to support the 
Government in improving the regulatory framework in the insurance sector, and strengthen 
supervision to encourage a sound and efficient insurance sector that promotes policyholder 
confidence. The outcomes of this technical assistance will be an upgraded regulatory framework, 
particularly focusing on the regulation of financial aspects through an effective solvency regime 
that is sensitive to insurer risk profiles, and in-house insurance supervision capacity at the 
Central bank of Seychelles. The IMF will continue to take the lead in provision of assistance to 
the Central Bank of Seychelles and in financial stability issues (covering foreign exchange 
market, monetary markets, financial supervision), and the Bank will take charge in providing 
assistance  on the development of financial markets (real estate, pension, insurance, stock 
exchange, and legal issues among others). In this context, the Bank will undertake analytical 
work on the development of financial market.   
64. Human resource and capacity development will both improve public sector service 
delivery as well support private sector development and entrepreneurship. With a tiny 

21 

 
 
 
population Seychelles faces the problem of manpower. It also faces skills shortages in some areas 
and the gap is filled with recruitment of expatriates. Around 20 percent of the labor force is made up 

of expatriates (only around 4 percent in the public sector). The WHO is supporting the 
Government to address some of the challenges with respect to quality of health highlighted 
earlier. In the education sector, the EU is providing support to Seychelles to help in the 
preparation and the implementation of the Education Medium Term Strategy (with a focus on 
both basic and post-basic education up to the secondary level) in order to improve the alignment 
between the country's training and manpower needs in an evolving national, regional and 
international environment. While the EU is taking the lead in the education sector, the Bank will 
complement by supporting the authorities in the ECD area. Seychelles will be one of the 
participating countries in the Bank’s SABER-Early Childhood Development (ECD) initiative 
which will help to develop measures to improve ECD policy in the country. The AfDB is 
supporting the development of priority skills to enable a private sector-driven economy and for 
an effective delivery of public services. The AfDB support will be informed by a Human 
resource development strategy that it will undertake. The Bank, through its assistance in the area 
of social protection, will provide support to the Government in introducing activation measures 
for beneficiaries of welfare assistance to reduce welfare dependency and work disincentives and 
introduce activation measures related to school attendance to address the problem of drop-outs at 
secondary school level.  
65. 
Bank’s engagement will have a particular focus on gender. The Bank’s engagement in 
supporting the authorities in introducing activation measures will have a particular focus on 
design of programs for single mothers. Participation in community services (flexi-time) as 
opposed to finding full time jobs may be more suitable for this category of beneficiaries. Along 
the same line, the introduction of co-responsibilities in the education sector may help address the 
relatively high rate of boys drop outs from secondary schools. The Bank team is discussing 
several approaches with the authorities to ensure effectiveness based on the potential causes of 
these drop outs. Incentives structure (benefit termination/ reduction in case of non-compliance, 
or a system of top-up bonuses upon graduation) may be part of the solution while a more feasible 
option seems to consist in involving the social services for referrals and monitoring and this will 
also provide opportunities for a more integrated case management approach. Although much 
improved in the last years, capacity at the National Bureau of Statistics can be further 
strengthened, and the Bank is playing a leading role in this. As part of the engagement of the 
Bank with the statistics office is to support in improving the design of survey questionnaires to 
capture disaggregated data needed for policy making, as well as to improve the collection of sex 
disaggregated data for effective assessments by gender. In particular, the Bank has already 
started providing support to improve the Household Budget Survey questionnaire to capture the 
different types of incomes (including disaggregated welfare schemes) and expenditures 
(disaggregation on health and education) to undertake deeper gender-based analysis. The Bank 
team will also build capacity at the statistics office to undertake such analysis which will help in 
evidence-based policy making. Enterprise surveys are conducted in an ad hoc basis and not 
always by the statistics office which results in almost non-existent data on enterprises including 
gender aspects of small and medium enterprises. The Bank will provide support to design 
enterprise survey questionnaires (one small and medium firm, and one for large firms) which 
will also be useful to capture gender aspects of enterprises. As mentioned below (in the section 
vulnerability and resilience pillar) the Bank will support the authorities to professionalize the 
fishing sector. Given that Seychelles has a large number of women artisanal fishers, 

22 

 
 
 
professionalizing this sector will empower and give more responsibility to these fishermen. 
Currently there is a lack of basic data like number of fisherman (gender-disaggregated), catch 
and income in this sector.  The Bank’s support in the area of Early Childhood Development is 
another key area where gender issues will be important. There are increasing discussions in 
Seychelles about productivity of employees and the firms and the competitiveness challenges 
that the country faces. However, this discussion is far from being supported by evidence as 
analytical work in this area is limited. To close this gap, and support the Government in this 
debate, the Bank will undertake an ESW on earnings and productivity with a gender 
disaggregated focus. The gender angle gives an interesting entry point to look at the external 
efficiency of the education system and the structure of the labor market. 

Vulnerability and Resilience Pillar 

66. 
Seychelles’ economic structure and geographic location make it vulnerable to 
specific economic and climatic shocks. As noted above, macroeconomic vulnerability arises 
from four key factors: the high concentration of economic activity on tourism and fisheries; its 
high import dependency, especially for commodities such as fuel; exposure to disaster and 
climate change; and, more recently, the development of piracy in its area of the Indian Ocean. To 
the extent that several shocks are exogenous, and vulnerability can only be mitigated somewhat 
or over the long term, an immediate focus should be on avoiding that macroeconomic policy 
responses magnify other shocks. Tsunamis and rising sea levels represent important fiscal 
contingent liabilities. These liabilities can be explicit (for example, public property is damaged) 
as well as implicit (the public, especially the poor, may expect some compensation from the 
Government after a natural disaster). To reduce vulnerability and build resilience to absorb the 
impact of exogenous shocks, the authorities should (i) strengthen PFM and improving allocative 
efficiency of expenditure, (ii) strengthen the social safety net system as an instrument to respond 
to shocks and (iii) strengthen institution and capacity for disaster risk management. Point (i) is 
clearly a governance issue as well and will be dealt with in the Governance section. The section 
on governance elaborates further Bank’s engagement in this area.  
67. 
Improved mitigation measures are needed to absorb the impact of disasters and 
climate change. Only limited possibilities exist to insure against such shocks. The authorities 
intend to put in place better mitigating measures and improve institutional capacity to sensitize 
and monitor implementation of risk management measures. With the financial support provided 
through the GEF, the UNDP is supporting the Government to increase capacity for effective 
environmental management to address national and global environmental issues. The Bank’s role 
will be to assist financially and technically when shocks occur and, more important, to support 
policy and capacity development for crisis prevention and preparedness. The Bank will support 
Seychelles in developing a Master Plan for Disaster Risk Management, to be implemented across 
various sectors and by all stakeholders at various levels (from national to community). The 
starting point for the master plan will be to conduct a National Risk Assessment which will 
include a Geological Risk Assessment and other hazards. This master plan will integrate all the 
existing contingency plans and strategy to give an umbrella roadmap17. This will strengthen the 
Government’s capacity to respond to an adverse natural event, evaluate the impact of disaster 
while protecting fiscal stability through risk-financing tools, such as risk sharing, risk pooling, 

17 To provide assistance in this area, the Bank will seek the support of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and 
Recovery (GFDRR) Trust Fund 

23 

 
 
 
                                                 
contingent financing, and catastrophe-related bonds and insurance. The Bank will also support in 
the development of a community preparedness plan to ensure the effectiveness of all the 
equipment purchased. Additionally, considering the weak capacity in disaster impact assessment, 
the Bank will support training on the disaster impact assessment so the country will generate a 
quick economic loss evaluation results when disaster happens, which will provide strong base for 
assistance. When the capacity increased, more regional risk sharing financing tools will be 
explored.

Seychelles is exposed to increasing piracy activities. Piracy is a serious threat to the 
economy as well as security, adding to the vulnerability of the country. Seychelles received 
assistance from a number of partner countries to help combat the threat of piracy in the Indian 
Ocean. Pirates operating in the Indian Ocean have contributed to income losses from economic 
activities such as maritime tourism, fisheries, and trade within and outside Seychelles and have 
added to the costs of freight and insurance. Traders and fishing operators (both domestic and 
foreign) have incorporated practices to address piracy risks, and activity in these sectors is 
picking up to pre-2008 levels. Government has included a contingency appropriation in the 2012 
budget which will activate in the case of unforeseen expenses related to budget risks associated 
with piracy, natural disasters, and further sharp increases in international food and fuel prices. 
Seychelles is receiving assistance from a number of partner countries to help combat the threat of 
piracy in the Indian Ocean. The EU, through the Indian Ocean Commission18 (IOC) is providing 
assistance to enhance capacity on several fronts, including the development and implementation 
of joint legislative frameworks, enhancing regional capacity to address economic impacts, 
creation of effective systems of information sharing on maritime safety and security, and 
establishment of a network for exchange of information and coordination. There exists currently 
a knowledge gap concerning the economic costs of piracy to the international and national 
communities. At present economic analysis has been constrained by fragmented and unreliable 
data and has therefore failed to contribute to effective policy dialogue at a time when the piracy 
industry is booming and anti-piracy measures failing. The Bank will undertake a regional ESW 
which aims at measuring the cost of piracy off the coast of Somalia and in doing so look at the 
mechanisms through which world trade in general and local economies in particular cope with 
this phenomenon. And this study will look at the effects of piracy on local economies of two 
countries, namely Kenya and Seychelles.  
69. 
Climate change, disasters and piracy impacts primarily the fishing industry. 
Promoting better regional integration for fisheries management and development, and supporting 
the growth of a sustainable and profitable local fishing industry will help improving resilience in 
this sector. Proactive management of the regional tuna fisheries, including judicious 
arrangements with other South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) riparian states and tuna industry 
operators, is imperative for insuring that the benefits of utilizing the tuna resource is sustainable 
and shared equitably, to benefit the regional coastal economies and the various stakeholders. In 
this context, the Bank will support regional cooperation in the fisheries management and 
development of the SWIO riparian states and targeted capacity building and investments in 
Seychelles. At the national level, the Bank will support the authorities to improve the sector’s 
monitoring and analysis capacity to ensure adequate information for policy design and 
implementation. The Bank will also support the country in the implementation of co-
management mechanisms. Sector co-management will include the preparation of a joint public-

18 The members of IOC are Mauritius, Seychelles, Reunion Island, Comoros and Madagascar 

24 

 
 
 
                                                 
private led prioritized process to remove critical constraints to profitable and sustainable fisheries 
business development and to identify the complementary public and private investments; the 
process will result in strategic investment to maintain the port attractiveness and industry 
competitiveness while reducing its ecological footprint. The Bank will support the authorities to 
explore synergy between the tourism sector and the fisheries sector to promote the national 
maritime culture and heritage, and the marine environmental assets.  
70. 
Exogenous shocks, while presents serious fiscal risks may have serious impacts on 
the poor. These shocks may substantially affect the purchasing power of low-income households 
and immediately reducing living standards. The Bank will support the authorities to improve the 
social protection system to respond to these shocks and cushion the poor more effectively. Along 
these lines the Bank will assist the authorities in the establishment of effective, well-targeted 
social protection system which offers powerful protection for groups that are most vulnerable to 
the effects of macroeconomic and some idiosyncratic shocks. Such a system can strengthen 
resiliency and help to smooth consumption following shocks. As mentioned above, piracy is 
affecting the business of local fishers. These fishermen are constrained in the distance that they 
could go at sea for catch and some of them have relocate fishing activities to areas that are less 
productive and are turning over-exploited due to the activity concentration. The Bank will 
support the Government in designing and implementing an emergency assistance scheme, as part 
of its assistance in the area of social protection, to compensate (partly may be) the fisherman 
whose catch is affected due to piracy acts. The Bank will also support the Government to 
professionalize this sector. The objective is to give responsibility and make accountable the 
fishers in the sector management and the social welfare system. The Bank’s support in this area 
is through a social protection technical assistance project. As the country is moving into second 
generations of reforms, the Bank will undertake a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA). 
The PSIA will be accompanied by public dialogue and discussions to help mitigate social and 
political resistance to reforms. The PSIA will be conducted together with the political economy 
analysis which will be part of the Governance for Growth AAA as outlined in the governance 
section below. Policy/focus areas of the PSIA might include social protection system reform, 
housing finance reforms and utility tariff change reforms.  

The Governance and Public Sector Capacity Foundation 

71. 
The Bank would approach governance and public sector capacity from both the 
demand and supply side. On the demand side, the Bank would work towards improving social 
accountability by strengthening citizens’ voices and access to information. The program will 
support initiatives by civil society organizations (CSOs) to enhance Government transparency 
and accountability. A political economy analysis will help to better understand governance 
constraints, help to identify which reforms are likely to have most political traction and which 
may get blocked, and help deepen Bank’s engagement for greater development effectiveness. 
Strategic support and tools will be informed by the proposed public sector governance analytical 
work (see supply-side governance section).  
72. 
Supply-side governance measures would focus on strengthening public sector 
institutions and systems to improve the environment in which good governance and 
capacity development are nurtured. On the basis of a careful assessment on strengthening 
public sector strategy and implementation, support would focus on four main areas, PFM, 
including statistics, human resource management, anti-corruption and justice. First, regarding 

25 

 
 
 
PFM, further improvements in the allocation and execution of public expenditures, including the 
preparation of budget programs and evaluation of Government programs, are needed. The PEFA 
2011 identifies some weaknesses in managing public finances, particularly improving multi-
annual budgeting planning and classification; execution of capital projects; accounting, recording 
and reporting; and Parliament oversight. Public debt is high and demands for social spending are 
increasing. A key area for Bank engagement would be to support the development of fiscal 
planning and monitoring capacities. The Bank will support in deepening and broadening 
outcome focused reforms to particularly (i) institutionalize the fiscal discipline, improve 
development of policy and performance oriented budget, (ii) further improve budget execution 
and reporting processes, and (iii) strengthen institutions19. The institutional design for capital 
spending needs to be strengthened to ensure that investment programs are based on national 
priorities and implemented cost-effectively. In this context, the Bank will conduct a Public 
Expenditure Review (PER) focusing on capital expenditure and also provide assistance to the 
Government on the public sector investment program that it wants to put in place. As part of 
building the public expenditure management system, the Bank will support to establish the 
BOOST tool – a tool which permits improving public sector spending efficiency. The Bank and 
the IMF will support the authorities in the development of the policy and performance oriented 
budget (linking capital and recurrent budget, implementation of program based budgeting, etc.). 
By the end of the CPS period, the objective is to support the Government to fully include 
recurrent costs of capital projects into the recurrent budget and to implement, as pilot cases, PBB 
into two sector ministries. The Bank will help the authorities to achieve greater efficiency in 
public health expenditure by explore sustainable health financing policy options and improving 
the management of service delivery. Proposed strategic support will be informed by a health 
sector note. This analytical piece will provide a comprehensive review and analysis of health 
sector performance and efficiency in the organization and delivery of services looking into the 
supply side determinants (i.e. human resources for health, supply chain management, governance 
and expenditure management, infrastructure and ICT), demand side determinants (household 
resources, health seeking behavior and risk factors, and community factors), and quality of 
service delivery. The Bank will also support the authorities on pension reforms with the 
objective to improve sustainability of the system. The contribution rate (and therefore unfunded 
liabilities) to the Seychelles Pension Fund is low and the Government’s objective is to increase it 
to a total of 5 percent by 2014. Old age pensions managed by the SSF (now ASP) are not means-
tested and universal. This also has fiscal sustainability implications as the population of 
Seychelles is ageing. In fact a re-thinking of the mode of operation in the public sector from 
efficiency and sustainability perspectives will be important for long term fiscal sustainability. 
While the country has made enormous progress in right sizing the public service, outsourcing 
non-core activities, divest in some public enterprise which do not serve policy purposes, yet 
more progress is needed. Education and health services at all levels are almost free, old age 
pensions and some assistance are not means tested, universal subsidies still exist, and transport is 
free for students and pensioners. At the request of the Government, the Bank will produce a 
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) to identify key sector-specific policy reforms to attain 
long term fiscal sustainability. While Seychelles reduced its debt substantially following the 
restructuring program with the Paris Club, yet it needs consolidate progress on debt sustainability 
and in the context the Bank will support the country in improving its debt institutional 

19 Empower the Public Enterprise Monitoring Division, legislate the roles of the Internal Audit Division and 
National Audit Committee and strengthen the Financial and Public Accounts Committee 

26 

 
 
 
                                                 
framework and build institutional capacity in this area. The Bank will assist the authorities with a 
debt management assessment and a medium term debt strategy (DeMPA/MTDS).  
73. 
Since initial exploration data acquired in the Seychelles marine EEZ have been 
encouraging, the authorities wants to put in place governance structure for this sector 
upfront. In this context the Bank would provide technical assistance to create the institutional 
framework that needs to be in place to support oil production and make sure that the appropriate 
benefits accrue to the country. The Bank will support the Government to establish an 
Independent Regulatory Authority (IRA) for this sector, support in the revision of petroleum 
legislation and supplementary regulations, and support in the adherence to the extractive industry 
transparency (EITI) validation program. The Bank will monitor closely the evolution of 
exploration activity and, if warranted by results, will deepen the Bank’s engagement in 
strengthening the Seychelles’ regulatory and revenue management capacity in this area. In such 
circumstances, the existing Reimbursable Advisory Services framework would continue to be 
useful, since it would allow the mobilization of support from Bank staff. 
74. 
Reliable and timely statistics is essential for evidence base policy making. On this 
front, on the basis of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, the Bank, through 
the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, provides technical assistance to the National 
Bureau of Statistics to improve capacity to compile national account statistics and tourism 
statistics. The Bank would continue to support the development of national statistics to improve 
planning and monitoring and evaluation, by tapping Multi-Donor Trust Funds20, and encourage 
the use of statistical information to foster greater accountability between Government and its 
citizens. The Government will field a new Household Budget Survey in the second quarter of 
2012. In this context, the Bank will provide technical assistance to the statistics office to improve 
the survey instrument to ensure that more disaggregated and essential data are collected which 
will be useful to inform future policy decisions, based on evidence21. One of the key areas where 
collection, analysis and disclosure of key information are needed, to improve governance, is the 
fisheries sector. The Bank will assist the authorities and build capacity to collect and disclose 
fishing licenses and agreements, and regularly disseminate key aquaculture and fisheries 
statistics, including catch and effort per fishing vessel category, and aquaculture production per 
species. 
75. 
As part of the efforts to greater public sector performance to enhance growth, the 
Bank will support several on-going reforms in human resource management, anti-
corruption and justice. To lay the analytical foundation to accompany governance reforms in 
the Seychelles and to advise Government in the selection, design, implementation and 
sequencing of reforms, an ESW on Governance for Growth will be undertaken to take stock of 
public sector Government reforms, explore public sector reform options, and help design a 
public sector strategy to support the selected core areas of reforms in line with Government 
demands. This analytical piece will also include work on the demand side. It will consist of a 
Demand-for-Good-Governance (DFGG) Assessment that will take stock of demand-side 
governance, identify complementarities with supply-side governance and select possible entry-

20 For example the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (STATCAP), and Statistics for Results Facility – 
Catalytic Fund.   
21 Broadly the following changes will be made: in the income module, the source of income section will be 
elaborated to include income from welfare assistance, pensions, disability benefits etc. In the expenditure module, 
health expenditure will be disaggregated, and utilities expenditure will be disaggregated. 

27 

 
 
 
                                                 
points for targeted support, including the consideration of political economy considerations. It 
will help to lay the basis in designing and implementing activities across sectors to support civil 
society for greater development effectiveness. The ESW would be closely tailored to specific 
Government requests and provide sequential, just-in time support to client needs. As part of a 
broader focus on strategic planning and management, support to human resource management 
will be continued. This will include support to improved human resource management systems 
for hiring, managing and monitoring staff, a greater performance-orientation in the public sector 
and the incorporation of a greater service-culture, including measures to enhance transparency 
and accountability in the civil service. These efforts will be undertaken as part of the broader 
Government efforts in strengthening results-management and M&E while promoting governance 
and anti-corruption, and will be closely supplemented by the relevant demand-side governance 
areas mentioned above. They will also be closely coordinated with efforts on public enterprises. 
The Bank will also respond to client demands supporting the legal and judicial sector to 
strengthen governance and improve investment climate (the investment climate component is 
dealt more extensively in the competitiveness and employment pillar). Strengthening governance 
will be achieved by strengthening accountability, improving access to justice for citizens, and 
making use of ICT facilities and technology in the judicial sector. The judiciary’s capacity is 
constrained by the backlog of cases and the lack of an adequate case management system 
integrated across the key justice institutions. The Judiciary in 2010 adopted a Strategic Plan in 
which its immediate priorities are to strengthen its capacity and improve operational efficiency 
by streamlining court processes; up-grading infrastructure and addressing case backlog through 
the introduction of an innovative case management system. Key priorities include strengthening 
both civil and commercial courts with a judicial strengthening program and the need for an e-
justice system to effectively manage and monitor cases, for which design and implementation the 
authorities have requested strong support. With regard to case management system, with the 
support of the British High Commission the Computerised Case Administration System for 
Seychelles CCASS will be launched in 2012. This represents a significant milestone in towards 
modernising and automating case processing. To better support the judicial sector, the Bank will 
undertake a Rapid Judicial Sector Assessment. The Bank will endeavor to work with the 
Judiciary and other stakeholders in the legal and judicial sector to provide this support and to 
anchor reforms in the broader anti-corruption efforts by Government.  

C 

CPS Implementation 

76. 
This strategy will be implemented using the traditional instruments of the World Bank 
Group: (i) partnerships with stakeholders; (ii) knowledge generation to inform policy changes; 
and (iii) finance.  

Partnership 

77. 
The Bank’s engagement will strengthen partnerships with national, regional, and 
global players. The public and private sectors share a good relationship and quite often interact 
on policy matters. The civil society umbrella organization—the Liaison Unit of Non-
Governmental Organizations (LUNGOS)—also interacts with Government to promote its views 
in policy formulation. In its engagement, the Bank will support stronger dialogue between the 
public and private sector. The private sector conveyed its wish for greater dialogue with the state 
on issues, regulations, and decisions that may affect its operations. A durable relationship 
between these two partners, based on transparency, credibility, and trust, can positively influence 

28 

 
 
 
firms’ productivity through more efficient policies and institutions, improved quality and 
relevance of Government expenditure, and reduced policy uncertainty. The private sector, 
through the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), is open to further 
participation in discussions with the Government (formal and informal) to help increase the 
effectiveness of Government support for private sector activities. 
78. 
In the past three years, the Bank has generated a few knowledge products in 
consultation with stakeholders, but dissemination could be expanded. Going forward, the 
Bank will engage with civil society, the private sector, academia, donors, and the media to 
leverage policy changes, and it will organize the dissemination of knowledge products jointly 
with stakeholders. Knowledge products will be generated in partnership with the Government to 
ensure ownership and leadership for reforms, as well as build capacity to undertake policy 
relevant research. Consultation with stakeholders will continue, and the possibility for joint work 
with other donors will be explored. The Bank will mobilize resources from trust funds to support 
CSOs in designing and implementing activities to enhance Government transparency and 
accountability.  
79. 
The Bank’s engagement will reinforce other donors’ interventions in line with 
Government priorities. A relatively small number of donors and development partners are 
engaged in Seychelles. As discussed, after a long hiatus, the Bank and AfDB reengaged with 
Seychelles in 2008 to support the Government’s comprehensive reform program with the 
assistance of the IMF. Such donor coordination, which has helped to harmonize policy dialogue 
in the past three years, will be maintained and if possible strengthened. While the Bank will 
mobilize partners to deepen and accelerate support to Seychelles, the Bank’s engagement will be 
based on greater selectivity: Bank resources will be channeled to areas in which the Bank has a 
comparative advantage and will support areas in which other donors are leading. The Bank and 
the AfDB will jointly conduct mid-term review for their respective strategies in the first quarter 
of 2014 to better harmonize their engagement. Annex 2 presents a matrix of donor engagements 
by sector. 

Knowledge program 

80. 
The Bank’s support for reforms in Seychelles in the past few years was largely 
informed by analytical work. Because the reform program was intended mainly to consolidate 
macroeconomic stability and address deep-rooted structural imbalances, analytical work 
concentrated on governance, particularly expenditure management in social sectors and publicly 
owned enterprises. This work helped to identify areas for support under the two DPOs delivered 
to the Government.  
81. Going forward, knowledge will be generated to further assist Seychelles in 
governance and public capacity building as well as the two pillars of the Bank’s strategic 
approach. Although Seychelles reduced its debt and its economy grew at a higher than expected 
rate in 2010, it needs a strong growth path to consolidate progress on debt sustainability, build 
resilience and prepare for long term fiscal sustainability. It is crucial to speed the pace of 
structural reforms that aim at developing the private sector, redefining the role of the 
Government, and improving economic resilience to shocks. To guide such reforms, strong 
knowledge is needed in key strategic areas.   
82. 
The Bank will ensure that results of analytical work will contribute to the public 
debate on major policy issues. This effort will pursue broader dissemination through a variety 

29 

 
 
 
of media and platforms, including the local press, university, and organized debates with civil 
society, the private sector, donor partners, and other stakeholders. The University of Seychelles 
was established only recently (2008), and the Bank expects that partnering with the university 
will help to develop a policy research culture among academics. Based on demand from the 
authorities, the Bank will develop a seminar series to be delivered by VC or by staffs on mission 
to improve knowledge of the staffs of the Ministry of Finance in some key areas: PFM, budget 
management, accounting standards, auditing, M&E, and others22. Greater participation of the 
Seychelles in South-South (S-S) knowledge sharing and peer- learning events will be explored. 
For example, the Parliamentary Network will invite the Speaker of the National Assembly to 
participate in the private sector development conference in March 2012. The South-South 
Knowledge Exchange Program of the World Bank Institute will be explored for S-S cooperation 
in the judicial sector. To assist in reforms in the competitiveness and employment pillar, 
analytical pieces will need to be developed and technical assistance provided to inform policy 
makers on further regulatory and institutional barriers to business, more knowledge is required to 
understand the financial market so as to support the Government to deepen and broaden this 
market to facilitate business operations and become another pillar for the economy, assistance 
will be provided to develop the energy sector, better understanding is needed on earnings and 
productivity gaps, more knowledge is needed to understand the evolution of the tourism industry 
for the region to devise strategies for open skies by national authorities from a regional 
perspective, and assistance will be provided to develop the right structure and levels of utility 
tariffs. In light of these, the Bank plans to undertake five ESWs and three technical assistance 
projects in the CPS period:  a development of financial market and a regional study on air access 
policies, a gender-disaggregated analysis on earnings and productivity gaps, a study on 
constraints to growth of the EE and RE, a tariff study, a TA on improving business environment, 
a TA to strengthen the housing mortgage market, a TA to develop the energy sector strategy, 
and a TA to strengthen the insurance regulatory framework and supervision. As part of the 
Bank’s SABER-Early Childhood Development (ECD) initiative, Seychelles will be one of the 
participating countries. This will help design effective measures in the area of early childhood 
development for the country. To improve resilience to shocks and pave the way for long term 
growth and sustainability, establishing backward linkages from the tourism industry to domestic 
industry is essential, as well as diversification between sectors, but also within established 
sectors, better understanding of the economic costs of piracy is needed for informed policy 
decisions, understanding of the effects of policy changes on different segments of the population 
is required to better target the poor and vulnerable, and the Government also needs to have in 
place contingency plans to mitigate specific risks. In this context, the Bank will undertake a 
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) of recent and on-going reforms; support the 
development of a Master Plan for Disaster Risk Management (including geological risk 
assessment), a study on the economic impact of piracy, and a social protection TA. On the 
governance and public sector capacity foundation, the Bank’s analytical work will focus on 
improving institutional capacity and governance with respect to capital expenditure and 
subsidies, good governance and accountability, strengthen debt management capacity, prepare 
for oil sector management, re-thinking of the mode of operation in social sectors from an 
efficiency perspective will be important, for example improve efficiency and sustainability of 
health service provision, and building capacity at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). In this 

22 The first such seminar will take place in March 2012 during the DPO identification mission. The topic for 
discussion will be risk management tools/ instruments of the Bank and its application in different countries.

context, the Bank will produce a Country Economic Memorandum identifying key sector-
specific policy reforms to attain long term fiscal sustainability, provide assistance to produce a 
health sector status report, undertake a public expenditure review (PER) focusing on capital 
expenditures and subsidies, a Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) and a Debt Management 
Performance Assessment (DeMPA), an ESW on Governance for growth which would combine 
assessments and analysis on demand and supply side of governance and help design a public 
sector reform strategy, a TA to support dialogue with Government on oil sector governance and 
revenue management, and a statistical capacity building assistance to support improving the 
household survey (including assistance to improve collection of gender-differentiated data), 
build capacity for undertaking distributional incidence analysis for long-term sustainability. In 
the legal and judicial sector, the Bank will support a rapid judicial sector assessment which will 
provide the basis for Bank interventions in the sector. Annex 3 lists the proposed analytical work 
under this CPS. Besides the planned AAAs, the Bank will also respond to demand driven just-in-
time requests to the Government to support the reform agenda.  

Finance 

83. 

The Bank will use its financing instrument to support policy and institutional 
changes that will influence development. A programmatic series of three Development Policy 
Operations (DPOs) will be the main financing instrument and will assist in policy reforms 
informed by analytical works. This series will support second-generation of reforms that are 
natural continuation of support that the Bank provided through two stand alone DPOs in 2009 
and 2010 which had as objectives to (i) establish a stable macroeconomic environment, (ii) 
establish a sustainable fiscal framework, (iii) to improve public sector effectiveness and (iv) 
improve the business environment. This programmatic series will consolidate and reinforce 
reforms achieved during the previous years, while shaping the way to a sustainability path. The 
indicative IBRD lending program of $21 million for the FY12-FY15 CPS period is expected to 
finance a programmatic series of three DPOs of US$ 7 million each. This lending program is 
indicative, and actual lending levels would continue to depend on country performance, IBRD's 
lending capacity, demand by other borrowers, and general economic developments.  
84. 
The areas of the programmatic DPO series is embedded in the strategic approach 
highlighted in this strategy. In the competitiveness and employment pillar, this series will 
support improving the business environment. In the vulnerability and resilience pillar, this series 
will support enhancing the social protection system, and strengthen institutions to respond to 
natural events. In the governance and public sector capacity foundation, this series will support 
the establishment of institutions to prepare for the development of the country’s petroleum 
resources, and improve transparency in the fisheries sector, and improve public finance (incl. 
health sector efficiency, and SOEs). 
85. 
Improved business environment will be achieved through expediting business 
registration, easing business exit, and facilitating settlement of commercial disputes, among 
others. The Bank will support the introduction of a bankruptcy system to (i) save viable 
businesses that can continue contributing to the economy and (ii) support unviable businesses to 
exit the market so that resources can be efficiently redistributed. The Bank will support 
establishment of simpler procedures to attract investment and enhance the development of a 
competitive market economy. The Bank will assist in the setting up of a specialized commercial 

31 

 
 
 
court and the development of its rules of procedure as well as developing the technical 
specifications of a pilot case management system. 
86. 
Improving expenditure efficiency will build the economy’s resilience to shocks. The 
Bank will support policies and actions to reduce subsidy allocation to state owned enterprises 
and limiting the role of the state in commercial activities. As such, amongst others, the Bank will 
assist the Public Utility Company (PUC) in determining and charging market tariff for utilities to 
cover full cost, support Government to assess purchase power agreements, support the Housing 
Finance Company (HFC) in designing and implementing a market based social housing finance 
strategy which would include a system of ‘smart subsidies’. To enhance the social protection 
system, the Bank will support in merging the two agencies for welfare assistance into one, build 
a robust MIS system, establish appeals mechanisms, to introduce assessment based on 
functioning capacity for disability benefits, introducing activation measures, improve the 
targeting system, address the problem of sustainability of the Seychelles Pension Fund and assist 
in designing a piracy-related emergency scheme for fishermen.  
87. 
Strengthening institutions, building capacity and enhancing transparency and 
accountability will help improve governance. The Bank will help review and update of the 
legal, regulatory and model contract framework applicable to the petroleum sector, build 
capacity to evaluation and negotiation of licensing round proposals, establish an independent 
petroleum regulatory authority, and assist in the EITI validation program. The Bank will also 
help improve transparency and accountability in the fisheries sector by disclosing fishing 
agreements, licenses information (number and type of licenses issued, duration and fees paid) 
and other key sector statistics such as fleet composition, activity (fishing days - or “effort” - and 
catches) and subsidies. Such approach will support setting up civil society and stakeholders’ 
participation in the debate on sound policy design. To improve PFM, the Bank will support in 
strengthen planning at the sector level, linking capital and recurrent budgets, review non-tax 
revenue policies, processes and forecasting, improve quality of financial statements and legislate 
the roles of the Internal Audit Division and the National Audit Committee.  To improve 
efficiency in the health system, the Bank will help undertake an elaborated health sector status 
(HR, Infrastructure, supply chain management, quality of service delivery) to inform policy 
choices,  bring efficiency gains by revisiting and re-enforcing the referral system and task 
shifting, explore health financing options and develop sustainable health financing strategy. This 
will be supported by the analytical underpinning of the Governance for Growth ESW. 
88. Knowledge products and provision of technical assistance will be financed by the 
Bank, by partnering with other donors, by leveraging trust funds, or under the fee-based 
framework. Trust funds will be used to address climate change challenges, build capacity in 
development, analysis and dissemination of statistics, support to improve the financial and 
accounting sectors, and support to in improving governance. The Bank will support in improving 
disaster management by tapping on the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery 
(GFDRR), support capacity building by tapping into the Statistical Capacity Building Program 
(STATCAP) and the Institutional Development Fund (IDF), support to improve housing finance, 
insurance regulatory framework, and accountancy profession through the FIRST Initiative, 
support for the evaluation and negotiation of licensing rounds  by tapping into the Extractive 
Industries Technical Advisory Facility (EI-TAF) program, and support for improving public 
sector governance by tapping into the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF). Since the Bank 
response to the Government’s request is constrained due to limited Administrative Budget (BB) 

32 

 
 
 
and limited possibilities of grants from trust funds, to expedite implementation of reforms, the 
authorities have requested fee-based support in three broad areas: social protection, public 
finance management and public sector efficiency. This will provide the Government with 
specialized technical assistance and advisory services (policy choices and implementation 
options) to meet the inevitable skills gaps that exist in the country to advance the comprehensive 
economic reform program. The Bank will also use flexible and innovative financing alternatives 
to provide possible solutions against vulnerability, such as commodity price hedging, and debt 
management. Financial assistance will be assessed 
in 
the context of 
the country’s 
macroeconomic situation, including debt dynamics and the international economic context, 
which would be key factors in the determination of the financing gap. The IFC and the Bank will 
jointly leverage on the WBG engagement to support the authorities to bring in strategic partners 
on board in the reform program of SOEs. MIGA will explore opportunities to offer its insurance 
coverage to potential clients seeking political risk insurance in line with Government’s endeavor 
to attract more Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs). 

VI  RISK AND MITIGATION 

91. 

89. 
The success of this strategy may be hampered because of the foreseeable risks mentioned 
below. Risk mitigating measures are also discussed. 
90. Macroeconomic stability is vulnerable to exogenous shock. Volatility in commodity 
prices associated with the slow global economic recovery and threats of piracy could exert 
pressure on fiscal balance and debt sustainability and affect the Government’s ability to continue 
its reforms. To mitigate these risks, reforms need to be accelerated for medium-term expenditure 
planning. While Bank’s financial support may scale up to respond to external shocks, the country 
should also collaborate with other institutions such as the IMF and AfDB in the face of such 
shocks. The risk management strategy that the Government plans to adopt would also contain 
contingency plans to mitigate specific risks.  
Capacity constraints are an issue at all levels of the public sector. During the ISN, the 
lack of expertise in some technical areas limited implementation of some Bank operations. The 
first-generation reforms related to restructuring the economy for macroeconomic stability were 
led by the Ministry of Finance, which has higher capacity than other ministries. Second-
generation reforms must be owned and driven by other ministries and agencies, however, where 
a lack of technical capacity or human resource could delay implementation of the reform 
program. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will provide technical assistance and strengthen 
implementation capacity, AfDB will support the Government in developing a Human Resource 
Strategy and a statistical capacity building program, and UNDP will assist in developing a 
capacity development plan and provide technical assistance to build capacity. The risks related to 
limited capacity will also be mitigated by: (i) sustaining reforms that will generate stronger 
capacity in PFM and governance; (ii) concentrating on a limited number of policy areas; and (iii) 
agreeing on critical technical assistance required to overcome weaknesses identified in Bank 
institutional capacity assessments. 
92. 
Political and social resistance to reforms may arise. Reforms of state-owned enterprises 
may pose moderate to substantial political risks, and other reforms could be stymied by their 
potential impact, including on the poor. For example, it might be difficult to further increase 
utility tariffs given that from May 2009, utility tariffs have increased 7 times. The political 

33 

 
 
 
commitment to charge cost-recovery rate exist, but implementation might be difficult. During the 
process of the tariff study, consultation needs to build consensus among the various stakeholders. 
However, possibility of resistance from the general public cannot be understated. Implementing 
the new housing finance policy is also politically sensitive. Here too consensus building on this 
highly politically and socially sensitive area is very important, and a slow process built on 
consensus and taking into repayment capacity in the immediate to short term. To mitigate these 
risks, the Government will continue its strong and successful communication about its reform 
program. Specific reforms will be advanced through public consultation and awareness programs 
to gather public opinion and gauge public willingness to reform. The Government is improving 
its social safety net programs to ensure that they reach the poor and vulnerable. The Bank will 
use change management mechanisms, including communications strategy to manage this risk. 

93. 
Seychelles is exposed to climatic changes. Seychelles remains vulnerable to several 
natural hazards including floods, rising sea levels, landslides, and tsunamis, and these pose 
serious risks to the country. To mitigate these risks the Bank will support the country in the 
development of a Master plan for Disaster Risk Management which will be build on the 
assessments of geological risks and other hazards, provide technical expertise to develop risk 
financing tools, and support in the setting up of an emergency assistance scheme for fishermen, 
the most vulnerable sector to climate change risks.   

VII MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

94. 
The results framework presented in Annex 1 of this CPS will be used as a 
monitoring tool both by the Government of Seychelles and the Bank. Since the Bank’s 
engagement is flexible and will adapt to priority needs on an annual basis, it is also possible that 
the Bank will contribute to outcomes that are not reflected in the results framework. A mid-term 
review of the CPS will be undertaken during the first quarter of 2014 to evaluate the performance 
of the CPS and shape the agenda until 2015. In addition to the results framework, the CPS 
program will be monitored and evaluated through the planned programmatic DPO, which will 
also include a results matrix covering specific outcomes in the different areas of support 
envisaged in the DPO. 

VIII CONCLUDING REMARKS 

95. 
The design of the CPS is based on the understanding that Government ownership of 
the reform program is strong and that it is committed to drive reforms just as it has in the 
last three years. The CPS is timely, as the president was reelected in 2011 for another five-year 
term, and the strategy reflects the Government’s program. The country is also updating its long-
term strategic framework, and development of the CPS benefited from a draft version of that 
strategy. The CPS is designed to be flexible and allow the Government and the Bank to adjust 
the program to the country’s changing medium-term needs and priorities. The overall reform 
agenda also fits well with the Bank’s strategy for Africa. Although sector ministries will have to 
play an important role as the reform agenda expands from macroeconomic structural reform to 
more wide-ranging reforms, the Ministry of Finance will play the coordinating role and ensure 
that the reform program is implemented as planned.
