EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

Over the past 20 years, Mongolia has transformed itself from a socialist country to a vibrant multi -
party democracy with a booming economy. Mongolia is at the threshold of a major transformation 
driven by the exploitation of its vast mineral resources and the share of mining in GDP today stands 
at 20 percent, twice the ratio of a decade ago. The economy grew by 17.3 percent in 2011, compared 
to 6.4 percent GDP growth in 2010. GDP is expected to grow at a double digit rate over the course of 
the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) period. 

This economic growth has translated into some benefits for the people of Mongolia. Poverty has been 
on a downward trend over the past decade. Most recently, it decreased from 39.2 percent in 2010 to 
29.8 percent in 2011. Substantial progress has also been made in regard to several Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) at the national level, though significant regional disparities prevail. 

To ensure sustainable and inclusive growth, Mongolia will need to strengthen instituti onal capacity 
to manage public revenues efficiently and limit the effects of Dutch Disease; allocate its resources 
effectively among spending, investing, and saving; reduce poverty; and offer equal opportunities to 
all its citizens in urban and rural areas. It needs to do this in a manner which protects the environment 
and intergenerational equity.  

In 2008, Parliament approved the MDG-Based Comprehensive National Development Strategy of 
Mongolia. The document sets a 14-year development path: the first phase (2007-2015) will focus on 
achieving the MDGs and actively developing the country’s economy; the second phase (2016 -2021) 
will be dedicated to transitioning to a knowledge-based economy. 

The World Bank Group’s CPS is aligned with Mongolia’s Comprehensive National Development 
Strategy. It identifies three areas which the World Bank Group will support over the next five years 
(FY13-FY17):   

 Enhance Mongolia’s Capacity to Manage the Mining Economy Sustainably and 
Transparently. There are two outcomes: (i) supported the country in developing a 
regulatory environment, institutional capacity, and infrastructure for world -class mining, 
and (ii) supported the Government in designing and implementing policies and systems for 
a more robust, equitable, and transparent management of public revenues and expenditures. 

 Build a Sustained and Diversified Basis for Economic Growth and Employment in Urban 
and Rural Areas. There are two outcomes: (i) enhanced the investment climate and 
financial intermediation, and (ii) created more opportunities in the rural economy for 
enhanced livelihoods. 

 Address Vulnerabilities through Improved Access to Services and Better Service Delivery, 
Safety Net Provision, and Improved Disaster Risk Management. There are three outcomes: 
(i) worked with the Government on the design, adaptation, and implementation of a 
comprehensive social protection system that supports the poor, (ii) supported better 
delivery of basic services (education, health, justice, and infrastructure), and (iii) reduce d 
vulnerability of households exposed to natural hazards and pollution. 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CPS incorporates the lessons identified by the CAS/ISN Completion Report: (i) build in 
flexibility to take account of transitions and emerging priorities, (ii) ensure alignment, focus on fewer 
outcomes and ensure a clear results framework, (iii) design programs/projects to minimize 
implementation challenges, (iv) take a programmatic approach to AAA, and (v) consider the longer -
term role of the Bank in Mongolia and ensure flexibility of the Bank’s engagement as the country 
graduates from IDA to IBRD. 

The CPS period (FY13-17) spans across two IDA replenishment periods: IDA16 (FY12-14) and 
IDA17 (FY15-17). The indicative IDA16 allocation for FY12-FY14 is SDR64.8 million. SDR22.7 
million has already been firmly allocated for FY12 and IDA16 allocation for FY13-FY14 (SDR42.1 
million) is indicative only. During this CPS period, Mongolia will start accessing IBRD resources. A 
pipeline of projects that could potentially be financed with IBRD funds is being developed, and 
initial ideas have been included in the lending program. 

In delivering its program, the World Bank Group will continue to establish platforms for engagement 
with Development Partners in areas of strategic relevance to its program. They contribute to 
enhancing donor coordination and aid harmonization and reducing transaction cost. The Bank will 
continue playing an active role in formal donor coordination forums by co-chairing meetings of the 
Government and Development Partners.  

As Presidential and Parliamentary elections will take place early on during the CPS period, the 
World Bank Group will maintain flexibility in its program to adjust to new Government priorities. It 
will also focus on helping the Government prepare for potential risks such as a slowdown in the 
global economy, deterioration in governance, and shocks from natural disasters.

I. MONGOLIA – A COUNTRY ON THE VERGE OF AN UNPRECEDENTED MINERAL-LED 
TRANSFORMATION 

A. MANAGING REVENUES AND INVESTING THEM FOR TODAY’S AND FUTURE GENERATIONS 

1. 
Mongolia has gone through 20 years of democratic transition and market -based economic 
reforms. Since the end of socialist rule in early 1990, the people of Mongolia have made great strides 
towards transforming the country into a stable multi-party democracy in which civil society is 
playing an increasing role and openly calls for greater transparency and accountability. The classic 
range of post-socialism economic reforms have also been adopted and implemented. 

2. 
It is now experiencing a rapid economic transformation that is generated by mineral 
discoveries. The economy has traditionally been based on livestock herding. Starting in the past 
decade, a boom in mining exploration confirmed the existence of large mineral deposits – notably 
copper, uranium, coal, iron ore, and gold. Investments are turning these into world class mineral 
projects: Oyu Tolgoi will become one of the five largest copper and gold mines in the world; the 
Tavan Tolgoi mine, which the Government is currently negotiating with investors, will supply high-
quality coking coal for more than 100 years. The share of mining in GDP today stands at 20 percent, 
twice the rate of a decade ago. In recent years, the mining sector has contributed around a third of 
total government receipts, through royalty payments and direct and indirect taxes. In 2011, the export 
share of minerals reached its highest level yet, 90 percent.  

3. 
In 2013, copper and gold output from Oyu Tolgoi will commence, instantly trebling 
national output of these minerals and resulting in more than a quadrupling of GDP within a few 
years. By 2016, the mining sector is expected to contribute more than half of the GDP. T he export 
share of minerals may hover around 95 percent. When other mines will be developed, notably Tavan 
Tolgoi, the mining sector share of GDP and of exports will rise even further. The depth of 
dependence will soon place Mongolia alongside the most highly dependent mineral -rich economies, 
with Mongolia’s economy more alike with one of an oil-rich state. 

4. 
The mining boom carries with it all the well-known risks associated with mineral-
dependency. These range from the “Dutch Disease” – with its exposure to commodity price 
volatility, an appreciating currency and inflation, and unemployment in the non -mining sector – to 
the “natural resource curse”, with rising corruption, deepening inequality, and social disruptions or 
even conflicts.  

5. 
Mongolia is on a cusp of a transformation and has the unique opportunity to overcome 
many of the development challenges it has faced in the past and to take a path towards sustainable 
and inclusive growth. How can it manage public revenues efficiently? How can it allocate its 
resources effectively among spending, investing (in infrastructure and human development), and 
saving? How can it reduce poverty and offer equal opportunities to all its citizens – be it in urban or 
rural areas? How does it balance the needs of today’s generation with the aspirations of future 
generations? How does it do so in a way that will respect the environment? Such decisions – and 
more critically, their implementation – will require a higher level of institutional capacity more in 
line with other middle-income countries.  

6. 
More specifically, mining rents will need to be efficiently and transparently captured by the 
state as revenues. This will depend on the capacity of several public sector institut ions, ranging from 
the mining cadastre to tax administration. So far, Mongolia’s performance in these areas has been 

1 

 
satisfactory and it is working on further needed improvements. For one, fighting corruption will 
require greater attention, if only for the sheer magnitude of the rents and resource flows involved. 

7. 
The mining revenues will need to be proactively and sustainably managed to avoid an 
appreciating currency, inflation and credit risks. This implies adopting counter-cyclical fiscal 
policies, and avoiding over-borrowing and over-spending. Mongolia has adopted a set of fiscal rules 
which would achieve these goals under the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) of 2010 and the Integrated 
Budget Law (IBL) of 2011. Adhering to the spirit and letter of these laws wi ll be critical for 
Mongolia to limit the effects of Dutch Disease on the economy. A corollary is to apply the same 
principles to the private sector, in particular the sectors likely to fall prey to the pro -cyclical trends of 
a mining-dependent economy (e.g., banking sector, construction). Mongolia scores relatively poorly 
in this area, based on past and current practice.  

8. 
The mining sector, its associated infrastructure, and the upstream and downstream 
economic sectors will need to be supported in order for the current high growth to continue 
without running into capacity constraints. Given the size of the necessary investments in 
infrastructure and services, its effective delivery will depend in great part on the soundness of the 
public expenditure management systems – planning, budgeting, procurement, private financing – and 
the speed at which the Government can strengthen these systems. 

9. 
In the presence of a mining sector which will tend to command priority access to the 
economy’s scarce resources (i.e., capital and skilled labor), the non-mining sectors will face the 
formidable challenge of being the source of livelihood for a substantial part of the population. 
Successful diversification, often elusive for mineral -dependent economies, will be one of the keys to 
meeting the objectives of full employment and poverty reduction. Success will depend on providing 
the type of infrastructure and policies that will reduce the cost of doing business across a range of 
sectors and maximize the chances of successful innovation.  

10. 
It will also depend on improving education services so that a trained labor force can be 
employed in the mining and non-mining sectors. While the expansion of the mining sector will 
create many opportunities, it is highly unlikely that there will be a seamless shift of workers from the 
low-skilled agricultural sector, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of total employment, into the 
expanding ones (mining and private non-tradable sectors such as transportation, construction, 
financial and retail). Indeed, there are already growing concerns that the ongoing mining boom is 
fuelling inequality by placing a premium on skilled labor. Investments in quality social services can 
be both growth- and equity-enhancing, but policy and institutional frameworks and delivery systems 
which use incremental resources efficiently will be essential.   

11. 
As the economic benefits of growth will not be shared equally, the country will need to 
develop its own approach towards inclusive growth for today’s and future generations. Concerns 
about inequality are increasing rapidly, with growing demands for a wider and quicker redistribution 
of mineral wealth. The impact on public policy is shown in the rising share of universal cash 
handouts in government expenditures in recent years. While this approach may be satisfactory in the 
short term, it is fiscally unsustainable and ineffective. It also raises an issue of inter-generational 
equity: natural resources are depleted to support immediate consumption instead of being invested 
for the benefit of future generations. It will be important to ensure that some of the mining revenue s 
are invested in human capital, sustainable social protection and population health in a way that 
enhances equality of opportunity and avoids increased social segmentation. Recent reforms of the 
social assistance system to replace the untargeted and ineff icient cash transfers with a poverty 
targeted benefit represent a positive step into this direction. 

2 

 
12. 
The present social services system is characterized by structural weaknesses that 
undermine equity in financing and delivery . Channeling huge incremental mineral revenues into 
these systems risks exacerbating inequalities, and policy and structural changes are needed to ensure 
that they are equitable, efficient, and of good quality. Reforming the pension system to create a more 
equitable system across cohorts that takes into account the needs from the older population will be an 
important part of the policy agenda. The socio-economic prospects of the transformation which is 
currently taking place depend on how well the process is managed. 

13. 
In recent years, Mongolia has studied the experience of a range of mining-rich countries 
to learn from their achievements and mistakes – including Chile, Canada, Botswana, Norway, and 
Australia. As a result, policymakers are highly aware that turning the mining wealth into sustained 
prosperity for all Mongolians will require a more developed policy and institutional framework that 
can address multiple challenges.   

B. A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON PAST DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS AND ADDRESS 
REMAINING CHALLENGES 

14. Mongolia is a country with a rich nomadic culture that faces a range of natural 
constraints. It is the least densely populated country in the world with 2.75 million people inhabiting 
a territory three times the size of France. About 1.2 m illion people live in the capital Ulaanbaatar and 
the rest are spread across small urban centers and vast steppes where they herd cattle, sheep, goats, 
horses, yaks and camels. It is the second largest landlocked country in the world, with two giant 
neighbors that are strong economic locomotives. Living conditions – particularly in rural areas and in 
poor urban areas – are harsh, and infrastructure services are limited at best. Wintertime temperatures 
often dip below -30 degrees Celsius, growing and construction seasons are short, and natural 
productivity is low with arable land constituting only 1 percent of the total area. 

15. 
The recent economic transformation has brought significant benefits to the population . 
The GNI per capita went from US$480 in 2004 to US$1,890 in 2010. Progress has also been made in 
regard to several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the national level, though it masks 
significant regional disparities (see Box 1 and At-A-Glance table in CAS Annex A2). The National 
Statistical Office (NSO), which estimates poverty through nationwide household surveys, found that 
poverty remained stagnant around 35 percent between 2002 and 2008, went up to 39.2 percent in 
2010, and dropped to 29.8 percent in 2011. Poverty remains higher among the population in rural 
areas (33.3 percent in 2011) than in urban centers (26.6 percent in 2011). It is worth noting that the 
national poverty line between 2002, 2008, and 2010 was raised in real terms, but was kept constant 
between 2010 and 20111. If the poverty line had been kept constant in real terms throughout the 
period, one would have observed a significant reduction in poverty between 2002/2003 and 
2008/2009. Improvements in standard of living can also be seen in other measures of wellbeing. For 
example, the number of heads of livestock per households increased significantly during the same 
period, in particular among the poorest households.  

16. 
Strong economic growth may translate into a further reduction in poverty . Yet, inequality 
in opportunities and outcomes may rise as the economy increasingly relies on the mining sector.  
Measured through the Gini coefficient, inequality in household per capita consumption increased 
from 32.9 in 2003 to 35.8 in 2008. Emerging evidence of such divergence can be seen in the rapid 
increase in salaries of skilled workers juxtaposed to a decline of real wages in the informal sector. 

1 The change in the real poverty line up to 2010 allowed NSO to reflect changing preferences and consumption patterns in a 
rapidly growing economy but with the consequence that these data are not comparable over time . 

3 

 
                                                           
Appropriate social policies that promote equality of opportunity in access to basic services, targeted 
and sustainable social welfare programs to improve secondary income distribution, and other labor 
and social protection policies would mitigate further increase in inequality.  

Box 1: Progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 

Mongolia has made significant progress towards achieving a number of MDGs, but is off track on meeting 
certain key goals. It has achieved targets for child mortality (MDG 4), and has high primary education enrolment 
(MDG 2). It has made strong progress on maternal health (MDG 5), though it will have to further accelerate 
efforts to achieve the goal by 2015 and will need to reverse the downward trend in women’s political 
empowerment. 

Mongolia has made mixed progress towards MDG 7 on Ensuring Environmental Sustainability. Access to safe 
drinking water has increased but the proportion of the population using improved sanitation facilities has not 
changed from 1995 levels. And while progress has been made in integrating sustainable development policies and 
programs – including an increase in protected water sources – these successes have also been accompanied by 
worsening environmental degradation in some areas, including increased urban air pollution and desertification.  

17. 
School enrolment rates are high for girls and boys at all levels, but significant disparities 
in educational outcome by location and overall system quality remain a concern . The result of the 
2008 national assessment showed that sampled Grade 5 students on average scored below 41 percent 
correct in reading and 32 percent correct in mathematics. The challenge of improving the quality of 
basic education is compounded by the fact that many children who begin Grade 1 are not ready for 
school. Currently, 24 percent of those aged 2-5 do not have access to early childhood education due 
to lack of kindergarten facilities – the vast majority of them from disadvantaged communities. 
Overall, developing a skills base to support the development of a middle -income country will require 
sustained reform across all levels of the education and training system, including in partnership with 
the private sector where appropriate.  

18. 
Despite good achievements in health relative to Mongolia’s income level, the health system 
can be improved. Mongolia has reached several of the health-related MDGs. However, health care 
utilization and outcomes are increasingly characterized by large inequalities, both ge ographic and 
socioeconomic. There are wide disparities across the country in maternal mortality and child health. 
Adult mortality rates are on the rise, driven by a rising incidence of non -communicable diseases. The 
availability and quality of social services in rural areas is hard to maintain and will take on new 
dimensions with the proposed decentralization of primary health care. Underlying are systemic 
problems with health services financing and delivery. Social health insurance lacks a long-term 
strategy for achieving universal coverage. A strategic priority in the health sector is to reorient the 
system towards a greater reliance on primary care. This will require capacity and systems to monitor 
quality, and promote greater coordination of care across levels of the health system. 

19. Much has been achieved in improving gender equality in education and health. Education 
gaps have been reversed at all levels of education and girls now account for more than half of the 
students in tertiary education. Fertility rates stand today at 2. Maternal mortality was reduced from 
130 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 65 in 2009. However, violence against women remains 
alarmingly high with almost 20 percent of women surveyed by the National Statistical Office in 2009 

4 

 
 
 
 
reporting to have been subjected to physical violence by a husband or partner 2. The gender gap in life 
expectancy is also widening due to a worrying increase in adult male mortality.  

20. 
There are persistent inequalities in economic opportunities for women . Although labor 
force participation remains adequate at 56 percent in 2010, average remuneration is lower for 
women. According to a recent analysis by the World Bank, women tend to retire early and are 
completely absent in some economic sectors: they continue to be over-represented in unpaid or low-
paid jobs and under-represented in lucrative sectors such as transport. Under current policies , women 
are allowed to retire five years earlier than men, although women live on average seven years longer.  

21. 
There has been a marked decline in women’s opportunities to express their political voice, 
but Parliament has recently been taking action in support of women’s participation. The 
proportion of women elected to the State Great Khural gradually fell from 23 percent in 1990 to 4 
percent today. However, 2011 also saw the passage of two important legislations . A Gender Equality 
Law was developed with broad consultations and was adopted by Parliament in 2011 . The Parliament 
also recently prescribed a 20 percent quota for women’s participation on party lists starting with the 
2012 parliamentary elections. 

22. 
The rapid mining-driven economic growth also has a significant environmental footprint 
that is unsustainable. Much of the country’s growth is derived and will continue to be generated 
from its natural capital (around 58 percent of country’s wealth consist of minerals, forest resources, 
cropland and pastureland). Some 80 percent of the land area is grassland, representing the largest 
remaining contiguous area of common grazing in the world, with large herds of migratory gazelles 
and the world’s largest population of wild ass. In the past two decades, a combination of human 
actions and natural causes has led to a significant decline in grassland quality: 70 percent of 
Mongolia’s grasslands are affected by desertification, and the forest area has decreased by 25 
percent. Human actions include changes in conventional livestock husbandry leading to overgrazing, 
and poor management of mining activities.  

23. Major issues are emerging in water resources management, with growing competition for 
water use for mining, livestock, conservation flows and human consumption . Water resources are 
rapidly declining and the quality is believed to be deteriorating quickly. The on-going and planned 
mining developments in southern Mongolia will require significant quantities of groundwater. The 
impact of abstracting up to 350,000 cubic meters of groundwater per day on local communities and 
herders are as yet unknown. Their livelihood depends on groundwater from wells and springs. 

24. Mongolia is highly vulnerable to climate risks because of its geographic location, extreme 
weather and fragile ecosystems. Climate risks in the country pose serious burdens on its 
development with an array of interrelated consequences for every sector of the society. They can 
affect peoples’ living standards both short and longer term. According to Mongolia’s National Action 
Program on Climate Change, the future climate scenarios project: (i) increased air temperature (2.1- 
3 Celsius and 3.1-5 Celsius by mid and end century respectively), the rate of increase is 2-3 times 
higher than the global average; (ii) increased precipitation in some areas; and (iii) reduction of water 
resources and arable land as potential evapo-transpiration increases would be 6-10 times higher than 
precipitation increases. Melting of permafrost, which covers more than 60 percent of the territory of 
Mongolia, will have adverse impacts on agriculture, water resources and infrastruc ture development.   
Agriculture and livestock, which are already heavily exposed to climate risks (such as dzuds -

extremely harsh winters in which livestock is unable to find fodder under the snow cover ), will 
continue to remain vulnerable, and large shocks will affect Mongolia’s society and overall economy.  

25. 
Agriculture employs about 40 percent of the workforce, but contributes less than 15 
percent of GDP. Livestock constitutes 63 percent of the assets of rural households. Still, almost half 
of the herders live on incomes below the national poverty line. The majority of herders have fewer 
than 100 heads of livestock, which is considered too few to provide sufficient income to support a 
household. The effects of dzuds –– and consequent high levels of livestock mortality -- have had a 
major impact on rural poverty. A series of dzuds between 1999 and 2002 were unprecedented but 
have been surpassed by events in 2009/10, as a result of which close to 10 million of the country’s 
estimated 44 million livestock perished. While there is no scientific evidence that climate change is 
leading to more frequent or severe dzuds, there are fears that such events will become more frequent 
and/or severe while the country is also getting warmer and drier . The devastating loss of livestock as 
a result of these climate events has prompted a large number of herders to move to urban areas in 
search of employment.  

26. 
In addition to having to contend with climatic risks, the development of the livestock sector 
is limited by its lack of integration into global supply chains, and lack of higher value-added 
production. Herders are increasingly exposed to shocks in international commodity, specifically 
cashmere, prices. Cashmere, considered a luxury good, is particularly volatile and sensitive to 
economic turndowns in consumer markets. In addition, livestock sector management is not meeting 
international standards of production that would enable it to export on a large scale to international 
markets. Furthermore, Mongolia’s livestock sector is vulnerable to infectious diseases which could 
be better controlled. Diseases such as foot and mouth and brucellosis are prevalent despite substantial 
but not prioritized public spending on disease prevention. Over the longer term, the risk remains that 
“Dutch Disease” may erode the competitiveness of the agricultural sector as it would be unable to 
raise its prices in response to rising domestic input prices. 

27. Mongolia’s rapid urbanization adds pressure 
to urban services, particularly 
in 
Ulaanbaatar and small cities close to mining sites . An increasing share of the population has moved 
to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities and social services. Ulaanbaatar has seen 
its population doubled to 1.2 million3 in just two decades and it is expected to reach 1.9 million by 
20304. Most of Ulaanbaatar’s in-migrants settle in unplanned peri-urban “ger areas”. These informal 
settlements currently comprise 60 percent of the city’s residents and 90 percent of its administrative 
area.  Until recently they were viewed as temporary and did not benefit from the city’s development 
planning or investments. Most urban infrastructure was constructed in the 1970s, and utility services, 
such as water supply, heating, and electricity, have reached capacity limits. As a result, residents in 
ger areas suffer from limited or no access to public services. Over 95 percent of roads are unpaved. 
They become impassible due to rain or ice and in the summer, rising dust also contributes to air 
pollution. Ger area residents suffer from higher rates of unemployment and rely more heavily on the 
informal sector for their livelihoods.  

28. 
The urban environment, in particular air quality, is fast deteriorating causing significant 
health problems. To heat their homes in winter and cook, nearly 85 percent of urban residents rely 
on wood- or coal-burning stoves that are highly polluting. On a cold winter day, the concentration of 
particulate matters in Ulaanbaatar’s ger areas can be up to 35 times higher than the WHO standards, 
leading to a high incidence of respiratory diseases, especially for children, and cardiovascular

diseases. A recent World Bank study5, undertaken with the cooperation of the Ministry of Health, 
estimated that 1,600 people die prematurely every year due to high air pollution. In winter, 
Ulaanbaatar is not only the coldest capital in the world; it is also the most polluted.  

29. 
An increasing number of people are exposed to natural disasters in urban areas. Poorly 
maintained storm water management facilities, low quality housing in hilly areas, degradation of land 
water retention capacity, and desertification in watershed areas have meant that Ulaanbaatar is 
becoming increasingly prone to flash floods. In addition, Ulaanbaatar is also situated in one of the 
most seismically active parts of the world, experiencing 30 to 50 quakes above 5.0 on the Richter 
magnitude scale on an annual basis. The Government has prioritized the protection of the population 
against natural disasters, and it recently approved policies and strategies to improve the legal 
environment for disaster management. Nevertheless, flash floods in 2009 and the 2010 dzud showed 
how much further work is still required to reduce people’s vulnerability to disasters. 

30. 
Finally, connecting people, services, and businesses across the vast land is a challenge. 
While there are nearly 50,000 km of roads throughout the country, 90 percent are earthen or gravel. 
Of the paved network that is more than 10 years old, less than 30 percent are considered to be in 
good condition. The main transport artery for goods is the Trans-Mongolian Railway that links to 
China and Russia. The biggest task is for Mongolia to build a transport and energy infrastructure to 
support the extraction, processing, and exportation of minerals. A World Bank study estimated the 
investment needs at US$5 billion in Southern Mongolia only. On the positive side, Mongolia has 
been able to facilitate the development of a telecommunications network across the country. Today, 
all soums are covered by cellular phone services and they are increasingly accessing the internet. In 
2008, 67 percent of the population owned cell phones and today’s numbers will be significantly 
higher. Mobile telephony is opening a range of possibilities for delivering better and faster services – 
such as banking, weather information, or other government services – to the most remote parts of the 
country. 

C. ECONOMIC CONTEXT 

31. 
The economy grew by 17.3 percent in 2011, compared to 6.4 percent GDP growth in 2010, 
and well above the average 9 percent seen during the previous mining boom in 2004 -08. The fastest 
growing sector was wholesale and retail trade, which expanded by 43 percent during 2011 and 
contributed 4 percentage points to overall growth in 2011. Meanwhile, mining and manufacturing 
expanded by 8.7 percent and 16 percent during 2011. Agricultural output, which had contracted 
sharply during 2010 due to a dzud, was flat in 2011.  

32. 
Inflation pressures continue to build, reflecting expansionary fiscal policy . Consumer price 
increases also remained in double digits during 2011, reflecting the effects of an expansionary fiscal 
policy stance in an already booming economy.  

33. 
Government spending in 2011 was 56 percent higher than the previous year, and the 2012 
budget seeks to ramp up spending further by 32 percent. The increased spending reflects pre-
election year pressures and efforts to make good on earlier political promises for large cash handouts 
and increases in infrastructure spending.  Revenues in 2011 were 43 percent higher than in 2010 
thanks to growing receipts from royalties and dividends. As a result, the 2011 overall deficit 
amounted to only 3.6 percent, albeit a deterioration from the balanced budget achieved in 2010. 
Since 2011, the budget has been based on estimates of structural (i.e. , long-term) mineral revenues as

required by the Fiscal Stability Law, with the difference between actual revenues and structural 
revenues (around 2 percent of GDP) saved in a Fiscal Stability Fund. By this measure, the 2011 
structural deficit (structural revenues less actual expenditures) stood at 5.8 percent. The structural 
deficit budget is forecast at 3 percent of GDP for 2012. 

34. 
To control inflation, monetary and fiscal policies need to work in tandem . The Bank of 
Mongolia raised the benchmark rate three times and the banking sector reserve requirement ratio to 
11 percent. In order to contain inflation, it is important to pace government spending to avoid a 
wage-price spiral if higher inflation expectations become entrenched.  

35. 
Recent history is a reminder that Mongolia’s economy can go through boom-and-bust 
cycles. For instance, between 2004 and 2008 the economy grew at 9.1 percent on average annually, 
but growth plummeted to minus 1.3 percent in 2009 when global commodity prices collapsed. It had 
dire consequences for the Mongolian economy, including its banking sector. (See Box 2) 

Box 2: The tale of a mining-dependent economy – the 2008 bust and the adoption of the Fiscal 
Stability Law 

The macroeconomic situation deteriorated sharply during the latter half of 2008 due to plummeting global 
copper prices and the global economic downturn. The fiscal shock was large, causing the overall 
government balance to shift from a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to a 5.4 percent deficit in 2009. 
Similarly, the external balance swung from a surplus into a deficit as export proceeds fell by one quarter in 
2009. Inflation, which had peaked at 34 percent (year-on-year) in August 2008 due to large increases in 
domestic spending, loose monetary policy, and a de facto fixed exchange rate, turned negative for a brief 
period in the latter half of 2009 as the economy contracted sharply. Economic growth, which had been 
averaging 9.1 percent per year, came to a grinding halt and real GDP declined by 1.3 percent in 2009. The 
bust was compounded by the international economic crisis and a harsh winter “dzud” in 2009 -2010.  

The banking sector was particularly hard hit by the economic slowdown as the significant vulnerabilities 
accumulated during the prior period of economic boom were exposed. The unhedged foreign currency, and 
heavy credit concentrations in construction and mining sectors, resulted in dramatic deterioration of loan 
quality and erosion in banks' capital positions. In parallel, the abrupt drying up of external funding combined 
with chronic maturity mismatches led to pressures on liquidity. With the system's non -performing loans 
reaching 20 percent, the credit mechanism came to a virtual standstill and public confidence in the banks 
eroded rapidly. Two medium sized banks had to be put into bankruptcy in late 2008 –2009 following a run 
by depositors. Only the introduction of a blanket deposit guarantee by the authorities, as well as the rapid 
economic turnaround, helped prevent the continued deposit outflow and more bank failures.   

The Government reacted by adopting a strong legal foundation for a sound macroeconomic and fiscal 
framework. Three complementary fiscal rules form the basis of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) which passed 
with overwhelming majority in Parliament in June 2010. Under this law, the budget framework adopts a 
structural balance and saves the mineral revenues, which are the result of mineral prices higher than the 
long-term price projections, in a stabilization fund, following the example of Chile. The fiscal rules put strict 
limits on the structural fiscal deficit, public expenditure increases , and public debt. However, the essence of 
the FSL kicks in only in 2013, when a structural fiscal deficit of no more than 2 percent of GDP needs to be 
adhered to. If implemented fully, the FSL will go a long way to minimize strong currency appreciation and 
excessive public spending and borrowing.  

The combination of strong policy action, supported by balance of payments and budget support from key 
development partners, together with a rebound in the copper price and the successful negotiation of the Oyu 
Tolgoi mining project, successfully stabilized the economic situation. The country successfully concluded 
an 18-month Stand-By Program with the IMF in October 2010.

36. Mongolia’s economy is expected to grow at a double-digit rate over the CPS period. As 

significant investments are required to extract Mongolia’s mineral resources and transport them to 
markets, large multiplier effects on related sectors, particularly infrastructure, transport and utilities 
are expected. (see Table 1) For example, an estimated US$5 billion is needed in the Southern 
Mongolia region by 2015 for investment in railways, electricity, towns, and water, a substantial 
financial injection into the economy. 6

37. 
Looking ahead, Mongolia is better equipped today to face a potential international 
financial crisis. It has adopted a fiscal framework scheduled for full implementation starting in 2013. 
Although it has not implemented a complete banking sector reform, the Bank of Mongolia is better 
positioned to exert its supervisory role over banks. Finally, the Socia l Welfare Reform Law ensures 
that basic social protection will be provided to the poorest.  

D. POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXT 

38. 
Since the end of socialist rule in early 1990, Mongolia has built a multi -party democracy. 
Two leading political parties, the Mongolian People’s Party (MPP, previously known as the 
Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party) and the Democratic Party (DP) have ruled in alternation – 
at times at a rapid pace. Transition from one Government to the other was for the most part peaceful 
but the Parliamentary elections in June 2008 were marred by claims of voting fraud. The next 
parliamentary elections are scheduled for June 2012 and the presidential election will take place in 
2013. 

39. 
The political landscape is characterized by open and free public debate. Parliament actively 
and openly debates new laws. The opposition is vocal and able to get its views heard. The President 
of Mongolia has increased the involvement of civil society organizations and citizen s’ groups by 

6 World Bank (2009)

organizing regular Citizens’ Halls to debate matters of importance for the country. Civil society 
would gain further influence if it had the capacity to organize itself into a powerful force for change 
and accountability. There is an abundance of media outlets (i.e., written press, TV channels) 
representing different affiliations and opinions, often highly influenced by the interests of the media 
owners. Journalists can attend and report on Parliament’s meetings and parliamentary decisions are 
all posted on the internet within a short period of time. Most recently, the country passed a milestone 
by enacting a Law on the Right to Information.  

40. 
As Mongolia becomes a middle-income country, it faces a range of complex institutional 
challenges. (i) a scaling up of existing institutions particularly in public expenditure management to 
manage the mineral wealth and invest in the considerable infrastructure to develop and benefit from 
the new mines; (ii) the development of a new set of institutions that would enable it to access 
international markets and develop a range of financing products; and (iii) structural reforms of 
service delivery systems to ensure an efficient institutional base for effective deployment of 
incremental public resources.  

41. 
Public sector institutions have already gone through a first phase of transformation during 
the market-based reforms but they will need to evolve further. While budget execution and treasury 
management have improved significantly at the central level and are unde rtaken by competent staff, 
Mongolia still has to tackle a series of limitations: unpredictable budgets, little long term planning, 
poor public investment management, insufficient capacity in line ministries to forecast needs, 
relatively low civil servant salaries at the senior level, and the difficulty to attract people to public 
sector positions in the countryside.  

42. 
The country recently decided to decentralize core services . This is bringing decision-making 
closer to the people, but also raises a range of implementation issues in the short and medium term . 
Decentralization offers a host of opportunities for greater civic participation in priority setting and 
oversight of services and can significantly 
improve governance and 
transparency. Yet , 
decentralization of social services also requires common national standards and systems, and 
effective equalization of basic services across the country. Getting the decentralization process right 
is instrumental to staving off discontent on the part of rural and poorer urban populations and 
ensuring that equality of opportunity to basic services is assured . Global experience suggests that the 
risks in achieving an effective decentralization are substantial and offer many lessons for Mongolia 
to avoid pitfalls in its own reforms. 

43. Mongolia fares better than many comparator countries in setting up the regulatory and 
institutional framework for greater transparency . In 2006, it adopted a new Anti-Corruption Law 
and established an Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) that is still in nascent stage. 
Mongolia adhered to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2005 and became 
EITI compliant in the span of five years. All civil servants and elected officials have to file Income & 
Assets Disclosure forms annually. Thanks to work undertaken in the past few years to improve 
public financial management – in particular on the quality and quantity of public budget information 
– Mongolia stands out for its remarkable progress on the Open Budget Index (OBI):  between 2006 
and 2010, the OBI increased from 18 to 60, placing Mongolia second behind South Korea in East 
Asia. Per the revised Public Procurement Law, civil society groups are mandated to participate in 
public procurement, specifically in bid evaluation and ex-post monitoring of government contracts. 

44. Many difficulties remain concerning corruption, conflicts of interest and political 
fragmentation. Patronage links within a small population are embedded in political parties, regional 
networks, and business conglomerates. For example, many financial institutions have significant 

10 

 
shares in non-financial companies and vice-versa which has led to distortions in the allocation of 
credit. Such problems have led to the recent adoption of a law on Conflicts of Interest that will 
require (i) agencies to adopt and enforce a code of ethics and (ii) public servants to register private 
interests with the IAAC starting from July 2012. In addition, channels for citizen accountability in 
service delivery have been piloted but still remain to be institutionalized as part of the broader 
governance framework. 

45. 
The mining boom is increasing opportunities for greater corruption and could drive 
policymaking towards more populism and patronage. As mandated by the Anti-Corruption Law, the 
IAAC developed a Corruption Index based on qualitative and quantitative indicators, including 
households, experts, and businesses perceptions of corruption, as well as agency self -assessments. 
The perceptions survey revealed that 13 percent of respondents claimed to have paid a bribe to a 
public official in the preceding 12 months. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions 
Index ranks Mongolia 120 out of the 183 countries measured. The Worldwide Governance Indicators 
reflect a deterioration of all indicators over the past decade, except in regulatory quality (see 
Attachment 3). According to Transparency International’s 2010 Global Corruption Barometer, 73 
percent of the population surveyed in Mongolia reported that corruption had increased in the 
previous three years; only 7 percent thought that corruption had decreased. They perceived political 
parties, Parliament, the judiciary, and police as the most corrupt. Half of the respondents considered 
the Government’s actions in the fight against corruption to be ineffective.  

46. 
Significant vulnerabilities and opportunities for corruption exist across Mongolia’s 
government agencies. To date, many government agencies lack proper resources, including specific 
routines for internal checks, internal and external auditing, and efficient processes that limit 
corruption. Poor performance in the public management system is also caused by the absence of 
effective performance measuring systems.  

47. 
Despite greater efforts at transparency, the country is struggling to establish a culture of 
accountability. While an adequate policy framework is in place, there appears to be a gap between 
enacted rules and actual practices. In part with Bank support, Mongolia has successfully 
implemented “first generation” public financial management (PFM) reforms – including the 
establishment of a consistent legal framework and effective systems for budget execution, monitoring 
and reporting. Public revenues from mining will increase exponent ially over the next few years. A 
stronger sense of transparency and accountability at the national, local and corporate levels will be 
vital to secure the transformation of non-renewable mineral resources into renewable assets.   

48. 
Although outspoken, media and civil society have a limited capacity to serve as a check on 
Government. As of early 2010, there were 3,840 media practitioners in 383 media outlets throughout 
Mongolia with 1,709 journalists and contributors. This large number notwithstanding, most media is 
controlled by the business-political elite and rigorous investigative journalism is scarce and often 
under pressure. Similarly, the capacities of civil society organizations to report, track and follow up 
on corruption and mismanagement are limited.  

49. Mongolia is facing typical circumstances of countries with small populations and these 
need to be better reflected when addressing governance and anti -corruption issues. Small countries 
are exposed to a higher vulnerability to corruption since the small size of the population translates 
into a close interface between the public and private sectors. People are related, are friends, have 
gone to school together. This closeness influences government operations and actions. On the other 
hand, in a small knit community it is also difficult to hide corruption and other mechanisms can come 
in to control unethical behavior. Further efforts to curb corruption need to build on these particular 

11 

 
challenges especially by promoting government transparency and accountability, allowing for 
controlled flexibility in hiring and other public-private engagements, and by creating a better 
understanding of the cost and societal impact of corruption. 

II. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT IN MONGOLIA 

50. 
Today, IDA net commitments in Mongolia stand at US$220 million, compared to US$136.6 
million in FY05, and are provided through 14 projects. The IDA net commitments include grants 
and credits. The majority of the projects support infrastructure development, economic governance 
and institutional strengthening of the mining sector. A Country Portfolio Performance Review 
(CPPR) in 2011concluded that the portfolio is well aligned with government priorities. 

51. Mongolia has also benefited from considerable trust fund support that is closely aligned 
with the country’s priorities. Contributions from donors increased to US$74.5 million in FY11, up 
from US$23.55 million in FY05. A total of 42.5 percent of the donor resources in the active trust 
fund portfolio have been provided as co-financing of IDA operations. 

52. 
IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Mongolia currently stands at US$131.2 million . 
This includes equity, loans, convertible loans, and trade finance lines. In FY11 , IFC achieved a 
record-high level of investment committing US$83 million in seven projects. It also secured 
important donor funding to provide advisory services in Mongolia, allowing it to increase 
significantly its programs. Currently, its three advisory services programs focus on (i) Investment 
Climate (Business Inspections Reform); (ii) Corporate Governance; and (iii) Access to Finance (trade 
finance, leasing, credit information, mobile banking). IFC, in close coordination with the Ba nk, is 
also exploring advisory services to support the Government of Mongolia’s effort to form Public -
Private Partnerships, mainly in the infrastructure sector.  

53. 
Past engagement in Mongolia was guided by the Mongolia Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) FY05-FY08 and the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) 2009-2010. These were discussed by the 
World Bank Executive Directors in April 2004 and May 2009 respectively. Both strategies were fully 
aligned with government strategies, including the Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction 
strategy (EGSPRS) as well as the subsequent Government Action Plan (2008 -2012) and the National 
Development Strategy (2008-2021).  

54. 
The CAS FY05-FY08 was built around the five main pillars of the Government’s 
Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy. These were (1) ensuring macro-
economic stability and public sector effectiveness; (2) supporting production and exports and 
improving the environment for private sector-led development; (3) enhancing regional and rural 
development and environmentally sustainable development; (4) fostering sustainable human 
development, and (5) promoting good governance, and implementing and monitoring the strategy. 
Within these pillars, the CAS was organized around three main objectives, namely (i) consolidating 
the transition; (ii) reducing vulnerabilities, and (iii) strengthening the alignment of policies and 
resources around results. A results framework was designed around these objectives in clusters of 
key results areas and 20 outcomes. The progress towards the achievements of these outcomes was to 
be monitored through multiple indicators and milestones.  

55. 
The CAS implementation was rapidly affected by two external events . First, a period of 
political uncertainty followed the 2004 elections and the ensuing Governments did not have a 
program of reforms that could be supported through a series of budget -support operations as earlier 
planned. Second, the CAS had not foreseen the speed at which the mining boom would occur and the 

12 

 
range of new development challenges that it brought about. The team thus re -adjusted its approach to 
consolidating the transition and reducing vulnerabilities and initiated a series of mining -specific 
work. This work was later reflected in the ISN 2009-2010.  

56. 
The ISN 2009-2010 was formulated with a view to supporting the Government’s efforts to 
restore economic stability in the aftermath of the economic crisis that affected the country during 
the latter half of 2008 and 2009. The ISN outlined Bank Group support in the following areas: (i) 
improving macro and fiscal sustainability in a mineral -based economy; (ii) protecting the poor and 
vulnerable; and (iii) encouraging transparent and prudent mining investment and a more competitive 
and stable medium-term business investment climate. A results framework included these goals and 
related outcomes and milestones.  

57. 
Under the CAS and ISN, the Bank Group’s analytical and advisory activities (AAA) 
provided substantial support to operations, and informed the Government’s reform path and 
response to the economic crisis. The Bank is generally considered by the Government, development 
partners, and other national stakeholders to have strong comparative advantage in analytical and 
policy work, including bringing in global innovations and best practice. Examples of the analytical 
and policy work undertaken in recent years include the Mining Sector Review (2006), the Country 
Economic Memorandum (2007), Public Expenditure and Financial Management Review (2008), 
ROSC Accounting and Auditing Review (2008), Livestock Sector Study (2009), South Gobi 
Infrastructure and Environment (2009), Civil Service Reform (2009), Public Investment 
Management Review (2010), Banking Restructuring Program (2010), and Poverty Assessment 
Policy Notes (2010). The Bank also produces regular Economic Updates that are well received by 
stakeholders. IFC significantly increased its advisory services in Mongolia to help develop the 
business and investment climate and support financial markets. 

58. 
Strong alignment of IFC and the Bank’s strategic priorities created critical synergies . IFC 
and the Bank maintained a strong working relationship in both investment and advisory services in 
the areas of mining and infrastructure, financial markets, agriculture, corporate governance and 
SMEs. For example, during the CAS and ISN periods, IFC made a number of investments and 
provided advisory services supporting banking consolidation, including a variety of new investment 
products and advisory work to improve risk management and spread best practice lending and 
environmental and social standards, which complemented the Bank’s program following the 2008 
banking crisis. IFC’s approach to mining and infrastructure sector is also fully aligned with the 
Bank’s strategic priorities.  

59. 
The CAS and ISN Completion Report (Attachment 4) rated the performance of the CAS as 
moderately unsatisfactory and the ISN as satisfactory. The overall rating of both the CAS and the 
ISN was moderately satisfactory.  

60. 
From an implementation perspective, the portfolio performance has been satisfactory . The 
disbursement ratio for FY11 was 29.3 percent, above the regional average of 22.4 percent. There is 
one problem project that is being restructured. All 13 projects which exited the portfolio in the past 
decade have been rated moderately satisfactory or satisfactory by IEG.  

61. 
The CAS and ISN completion report identified the following key lessons with implications 
for the design and implementation of the FY2013-FY2017 CPS: 

13 

 
 Build in flexibility to take account of transitions and emerging priorities . Alignment of the 
country strategy with national priorities and development plans is integral, but flexibility to 
accommodate emerging and unforeseen developments must be incorporated.  

 Ensure alignment, focus on fewer outcomes and ensure a clear results framework . The results 
agenda should: (i) be aligned with selected national development priorities, (ii) take into account 
activities of development partners, (iii) engage in areas with strong client demand where the 
Bank Group has a comparative advantage; (iv) be simple and only have a few selected outcomes 
and clearly monitorable indicators; and (v) link directly with proposed activities.  

 Design programs/projects to minimize implementation challenges . Given capacity constraints, 
simplification of project designs should be a priority, though this should not prevent the Bank to 
work with the Government on pioneering innovative approaches. Greater reliance on country 
systems should be explored in conjunction with capacity strengthening.  

 Take a programmatic approach to AAA. The Bank should consider multi-year programmatic 
ESW and TA programs in key areas (e.g., public expenditures, governance, service delivery and 
decentralization) while continuing with responsive policy notes and advisory pieces. 

 Consider the longer-term role of the Bank in Mongolia. Ensure flexibility of Bank’s 
engagement as the country graduates from IDA to IBRD and while continuing to provide strong 
analytical and advisory services, focus resources on “piloting” new approaches and improving 
the implementation capacity of the Government. Mongolia will become less reliant on ODA, and 
some donors may reorient their support to other low-income countries, affecting the ability to 
mobilize Trust Fund resources. 

62. 
In preparation for this FY2013-2017 Country Partnership Strategy, the World Bank team 
also undertook specific reviews of its portfolio from three perspectives: overall performance, 
integration of gender, and furthering of governance objectives . The World Bank Institute has also 
undertaken a case study on the World Bank’s overall effectiveness in supporting Mongolia’s mining 
transformation as part of its learning series on Governance and Extractive Industries. 

63. 
The Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) undertaken in 2011 provided a range 
of recommendations to improve portfolio performance further. Among others, the CPPR 
recommended more disciplined supervision reporting and recording, better integration of non -
blended trust funds in the overall portfolio, and pointed to the opportunity cost associated with the 
prevailing pattern of extending projects beyond their original closing date. The review also pointed to 
the need to systematically ensure the involvement of safeguard specialists in the operations in the 
country. 

64. 
The portfolio of lending and advisory work was also analyzed as to the integration of 
gender considerations in key Bank projects and policy recommendations . Specifically, the review 
assessed four aspects: 

 Overall adequacy of the attention to gender issues; 
 The identification of gender issues during preparation of projects and AAA; 
 The inclusion of specific measures to ensure gender inclusion in program benefits during 
implementation or in analytical work; and, 
 The adoption of mechanisms to monitor gender impacts. 

14 

 
Key findings were that the Bank could achieve much greater impact through better mainstreaming of 
gender considerations, particularly in key sectors such as mining, rural livelihood, urban 
infrastructure, and social protection. While the Bank recently undertook analytical work specific to 
gender (e.g., women and the labor market) and systematically monitors the benefits for women in 
certain projects (e.g., Enhanced Access to Justice, microfinance component of the Sustainable 
Livelihood Program), it could do so more consistently. The Bank should consider at the concept 
stage of each project or analytical work if there are gender dimensions that could be addressed and 
monitor these throughout implementation. In addition, the review flagged that the World Bank could 
take a more active role in disseminating the recently approved Law on Gender Equality. 

65. 
Finally, the Bank reviewed how it could strengthen its engagement in governance and 
anti-corruption. Mongolia is one of the C-GAP pilot countries that benefits from support from the 
Governance Partnership Facility in the East Asia and Pacific region. The Bank has helped advance a 
series of institutional reforms under the CAS and ISN, working closely with the IAAC, the Ministry 
of Finance, Parliamentarians, CSOs and media. GPF grant funding proved critical to the Bank 
undertaking outreach and advocacy for reform. Going forward, Bank support will be required not 
only to advance the design of reforms but also to strengthen their implementation.  

III. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES AND HOW THE WORLD BANK GROUP WILL 
SUPPORT THEM 

A. MONGOLIA’S MEDIUM-TERM PRIORITIES 

66. 
Over the past few years, the Government has developed and adopted a series of strategic 
documents outlining its development goals. In 2008, the Government defined the Millennium 
Development Goals-Based Comprehensive National Development Strategy of Mongolia which was 
approved by Parliament. The document sets a 14-year development path “aimed at promoting human 
development in Mongolia, in a humane, civil, and democratic society, and developing intens ely the 
country’s economy, society, science, technology, culture and civilization in strict compliance with 
global and regional development trends.” The objective is “to protect and strengthen Mongolia’s 
sovereignty, and develop it into a middle-income country through achieving its MDGs attaching high 
priority to promoting private sector-led dynamic economic growth, human development including 
education, healthcare, as well as sustainable development of science, technology and environment, 
strengthening intellectual development and human capacity; creating knowledge -based economy 
sustained by high technology, which respects environmentally friendly production and services; 
fostering a democratic system of governance, which serves its citizens, protects human rights and 
freedoms, and is free from corruption and red tape.” The Strategy covers two phases: the first phase 
(2007-20015) will focus on achieving the MDGs and actively developing the country’s economy; the 
second phase (2016-2021) will be dedicated to transitioning to a knowledge-based economy. 

67. 
Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals is being assessed regularly by the 
Government, with the support of the United Nations Development Program . The most recent report 
“Third National Report on the Millennium Development Goals Implementation” was released in 
2011. The report is forthcoming in its assessment of progress and attempts to provide policy 
recommendations to accelerate progress, in particular regarding the three MDGs identified as lagging 
by National Statistical Office data – i.e., poverty7, gender equality, and environment. 

7 When adjusting the national poverty line to new consumption patterns over time, it appears that the poverty level 
between 2002 and 2008 as measured by the NSO remained stable. 

15 

 
 
                                                           
68. 
Although the Comprehensive National Development Strategy sets a broad framework, it 
does not spell out a specific action plan. Some sectors – such as health, agriculture, and environment 
– have come up with strategies that are more specific. However, the Government often lacks the 
capacity to translate those strategies into concrete action plans with clear allocation of 
accountabilities around which ministries, agencies at the national and local level, private sector, civil 
society and development partners can plan and coordinate actions. 

69. 
The lack of a national actionable plan does not prevent the Government – and 
policymakers in general – to give a sense of the directions in which they would like the country to 
head. Based on public statements and policy decisions, key objectives can be described as follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a world-class mineral-led economy. There is a shared conviction that mineral 
resources present a unique opportunity for Mongolia to rapidly become a middle-income 
country. There is also a shared understanding that for the mining wealth to materialize, an 
appropriate regulatory framework – covering not only mining financial aspects but also labor, 
social and environmental dimensions – needs to be in place, infrastructure to facilitate the 
mining exploitation is to be planned and built, and a labor force has to be trained. 

to diversify the economy by building on the non-mineral economic basis (e.g., agriculture, 
tourism). As of now, the Government has adopted different schemes that rely mostly on 
subsidies of various forms for specific industries (e.g. , Small and Medium Enterprises fund, 
cashmere and meat bonds, national livestock program). 

to share the mining wealth among the Mongolian population. There are strong expectations 
among the population that the benefits extracted from the land will be shared among all. 
During the 2008 elections, political parties committed to distribute the equivalent of 
US$1,500 per person during their government tenure. The Government is now making good 
on its promise by channeling mining royalties, dividends and prepayments into a Human 
Development Fund (HDF) and distributing them in the form of (i) a universal cash transfer o f 
about US$16 per person per month, (ii) stipends, and other universal benefits; and (iii) a 
scheme to distribute shares of Erdenes MGL, the state -owned enterprise which regroups all 
strategic mining assets. While well intentioned, the HDF approach is fiscally unsustainable, 
accounting for around 10 percent of total public spending. It would be more efficient to use 
mining revenues to reduce poverty if it was targeted at the poorest families. Therefore, as part 
of the preparation for the 2012 elections, political parties have committed to refrain from 
making cash promises and to discontinue universal HDF cash payments from July 2012 
onwards. In its place, Parliament adopted in January 2012 a social welfare reform that is 
based on a redistribution system that targets the poorest. The national debate is now about 
making growth inclusive. 

to continue strengthening the country’s democratic tradition by involving civil society 
and local communities in decision processes. The institutional framework in Mongolia all ows 
for the open involvement of civil society in public decisions and was further advanced by the 
recently approved Integrated Budget Law.  

to develop a modern financial capability in line with Mongolia’s middle-income status. 
The country is equipping itself with financial instruments that would help it fund its 
development needs in a more flexible way over time. In addition to requesting IBRD and 

16 

 
 
 
 
OCR status with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, it recently established the 
Mongolian Development Bank which will focus on financing infrastructure projects. The 
Government is issuing domestic treasury bonds and is considering issuing foreign -
denominated bonds. Finally, as part of an ambitious strategy to develop domestic capital 
markets, the Government has signed a partnership agreement with the London Stock 
Exchange to build capacity at the Mongolian Stock Exchange. 

70. 
Based on a range of consultations undertaken with stakeholders (including an anonymous 
client survey – see Box 3), these goals are broadly shared across the population. There is of course 
diversity in the ordering of the priorities among groups – for example, some put greater emphasis on 
the development of the rural economy while others focus more on developing infrastructure in 
mining areas. Civil society in particular conveyed the need for the World Bank to continue 
supporting the country in building institutions of accountability, not only in the mining sector but in 
the broader economy.  

Box 3: Client Survey 

In June and July 2011, 538 stakeholders of the World Bank in Mongolia were invited to provide opinions on 
the Bank’s assistance in a country survey.  Stakeholders included Members of Parliament, officials from 
government ministries and agencies, provincial officials, project staff, civil society organizations, NGOs, 
private sector, media, trade unions, the judiciary and members of the academic community. The response rate 
was 58 percent.  The survey pointed to the following lessons: 

 Respondents valued the Bank’s policy and economic advice most, followed by its technical assistance ;  
 Governance/government effectiveness were considered the key development priority in the country, and 
private sector growth, mining, and basic infrastructure development were seen as critical elements to 
poverty reduction and economic growth; 
 Respondents indicated that the Bank was most important in strengthening infrastructure development and 
in encouraging greater transparency in governance, and believed that most focus should be on 
government effectiveness and improving basic infrastructure, and to a lesser degree on private sector 
growth and investment, education, poverty reduction, growth and improving natural resource 
management. Nearly half of all respondents indicated that the Bank should be more involved in 
Mongolia’s development strategies; 
 Respondents indicated that the Bank should work more closely with NGOs, the private sector, local 
Government and academia; 
 A number of stakeholders believed there is not enough public disclosure of the Bank’s work; and, 
 The survey also indicated a perceived decline in the Bank’s effic iency and speed with which funds are 
disbursed, as well as more cumbersome procurement requirements . 

Across all respondents, the Bank’s overall effectiveness and the perception of an institution that plays a 
relevant role in Mongolia’s development received a mean rating of 7 on a 10 point scale.  

B. RESOURCES THAT THE WORLD BANK GROUP CAN PROVIDE TO SUPPORT MONGOLIA’S 
DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES 

71. 
This Country Partnership Strategy lays the foundation for Mongolia’s access to IBRD 
resources. In the span of six years, Mongolia’s GNI per capita has nearly quadrupled from US$480 
in 2004 to US$1,890 in 2010, a level well above the 2010 cut-off mark set for low-income of 
US$1,005 per capita. In light of its economic advancement, the Mongolian Government has 
requested the World Bank to change the country’s status from “IDA-only” to “Blend” enabling 
access to resources on a non-concessional basis as well as concessional resources. While balancing 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
the number of positive developments that have taken place in the past two years in Mongolia with the 
risks associated with the development of a mineral-rich economy, the World Bank has decided to 
declare Mongolia creditworthy for IBRD lending. 

72. 
A key element for consideration when deciding on IBRD’s exposure to Mongolia is the 
country’s management of its public debt and how it is expected to evolve in coming years. The 
establishment of the Fiscal Stability Fund and the issuance of government guarantees to the 
Development Bank imply a need to gradually expand the focus from the public debt, to the risk 
exposure of the overall balance sheet of the Government, i.e., monitoring and managing risks related 
to direct and contingent assets and liabilities , and to exogenous shocks. Both the World Bank and the 
IMF are committed to continue providing guidance and share experiences with the Mongolian 
Government in this critical area and the authorities are receptive to such work. 

73. Mongolia will benefit from a full IDA allocation under IDA16 (FY12-FY14) as a blend 
country. The CPS period (FY13-17) spans across two IDA replenishment periods of IDA16 (FY12-
14) and IDA17 (FY15-17), The indicative IDA16 allocation for the FY12-FY14 period is SDR64.8 
million8. Out of this IDA16 allocation, SDR22.7 million has been firmly allocated for FY12 . The 
IDA16 allocation for FY13-FY14 (SDR42.1 million) is indicative only, and the actual allocation will 
depend on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the 
performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA's assistance to 
country (credit and blend terms for Mongolia) and; (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. As 
Mongolia will now be a “Blend” country, the borrowing terms that will apply to IDA resources are 
the following: a 25-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 1.25 percent interest charge.  

74. 
The Blend status not only increases resources to Mongolia, it also expands the types of 
financial products and services. In addition to a full IDA allocation for the period of FY12-FY14, 
Mongolia will gradually start accessing IBRD resources that would be used for investment 
operations. At this stage, a pipeline of projects that could potentially be financed with IBRD funds is 
being developed. Initial ideas have been included in the lending program. Once the IBRD lending 
program is firmed up, it would be presented as part of the CPS Progress Report or with the first 
IBRD-funded operation, whichever comes first.  

75. 
IFC can play a critical role in assisting Mongolia to address its private sector development 
needs on multiple fronts. IFC offers three lines of services: Investment Services, Advisory Services, 
and through its Asset Management Company (AMC). IFC’s investment services provide a broad 
suite of financial products including loans, equity, trade finance, structured finance, risk management 
products and syndicated loans in all sectors and enable companies to manage risk and broaden their 
access to foreign and domestic capital markets. IFC advisory services offer advice in a broad range of 
topics aimed at private sector development, from help ing the Government implement reforms to 
improve their business environment, to promoting sustainable business practices at firm level , 
advancing good corporate governance practices, building the capacity of small firms and small-scale 
farmers, advancing women in business, promoting higher environmental and social standards, and 
engaging the private sector in climate-change solutions. IFC also promotes access to finance both 
through investment services and advisory services. IFC’s AMC, a wholly owned subsidiary of IFC, 
was created to channel the resources held by sovereign funds, pension funds and other institutional 
investors to investment opportunities in developing countries. In this process, IFC expands its 
development reach by “crowding in” commercial investors by demonstrating the financial benefits 
and growth opportunities as well as the development impact of investing in these markets. IFC is 

8 Equivalent to about US$101million as of February 2012. 

18 

 
                                                           
exploring future investment opportunities in the financial markets, manufacturing, and agriculture 
sectors, and is committed to enhancing its program during the new CPS period. 

76. 
In addition to IFC’s investment programs, IFC has significantly increased its advisory 
services with over US$1.5 million projects funded by IFC, two donors (Japan and Netherlands) and 
clients to develop the investment climate and support financial markets. In April 2011, existing 
advisory programs received an additional US$2.5 million from Japan, bringing the total funding to 
nearly US$ 4 million.  

77. Mongolia is a strategic priority for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) 
and it is exploring opportunities related to the mining sector . MIGA's other strategic priorities are 
South-South transactions, complex infrastructure projects, and supporting financial sector institutions 
to enhance access to finance. MIGA's focus in Mongolia will be to support sustainable development 
of the mining sector, associated industries and also enhance financing for infrastructure. 

78. MIGA can provide support and incentives for foreign investors looking at entering the 
Mongolian market. Through its Political Risk Insurance (PRI) product, MIGA offers reassurance for 
investors concerned about political interventions or disruptions which might affect their returns. 
MIGA’s main covers offer protection against Transfer or Convertibility Restriction, Expropriation 
and Breach of Contract risk, War and Civil Disturbance risks. With uncertainty in the political, 
economic or regulatory environment, these guarantees offer protection for investors unsure about 
counterparty risk with the Government or about how more conventional political disruptions and 
civil disturbances might cause physical damage or disrupt their operations. In the Mongolian context, 
MIGA’s guarantee product could support the mining sector through supporting investors, and 
buffering the reform of the sector to encourage new exploration and socially sustainable 
development. The reassurance offered by MIGA guarantees would potentially be particularly useful 
for investors uncertain about further Government interventions and policy changes in the sector. 

79. More recently, MIGA has launched a new cover, guaranteeing the Non-Honoring of a 
Sovereign Financial Obligation, a coverage which provides credit enhancement in transactions 
involving sovereign and sub-sovereign obligors. Again, this may fill a local need, as the primary 
beneficiaries here would be commercial lenders that provide loans to public sec tor entities for 
infrastructure and other productive investments. Finally, MIGA offers a more streamlined product 
under its Small Investment Program (SIP) where it offers the standard basic covers to smaller 
investors entering a foreign market.    

80. 
In addition to providing resources, the World Bank Group’s programs can be platforms for 
engaging with other Development Partners on strategic priorities . At US$74.5 million, the 
Recipient Executed Trust Fund (RETF) portfolio is equivalent to more than one third of Mongolia’s 
IDA portfolio. In fact, half of the RETFs co-finance IDA projects, successfully leveraging resources 
from donors for the benefit of the client . The World Bank will continue its practice of establishing 
platforms for engagement with Development Partners in areas which the Bank has determined as 
strategic for its program and in which it has established a comparative advantage through its 
analytical work. An example of such approach is the ongoing rural program (see Box 4). Such 
approach has the benefits of further enhancing donor coordination and aid harmonization, reducing 
the transaction cost of receiving overseas development assistance on the part of the Government, and 
increasing the impact of the work of the Bank.  

19 

 
Box 4: Using WB programs to engage other Development Partners and generate greater impact  

The Sustainable Livelihoods Program (SLP) was launched in 2002 to address poverty and vulnerability , primarily 
in rural areas, by developing mechanisms to support the livelihoods of rural citizens. This is a long term 
objective, to be achieved through a three phased Adaptable Program Loan, during which the approaches would be 
piloted, then scaled up and ultimately embedded in policy and institutions, with capacity and tools in place for 
sustainability. In addition, a separate project, the Index -based Livestock Insurance Project (IBLIP), was spun out 
of SLP to provide an innovative and market -based tool for rural risk management. The core financing for the 
program has come from IDA with, to date, a total of US$63 million for SLP (first and second phases) and US$18 
million for IBLIP (including Additional Financing). However, trust fund support has been equally important. 
Trust Funds amounting to US$25 million – from Japan (PHRD and JSDF), FIRST, Swiss Development 
Cooperation, European Union, and Korea – have supported the initial (often innovative) design work, have 
financed the costs of high caliber international technical assistance, have supported the capacity of local 
institutions and the improved focus on results, including M&E systems and impact assessment. Development 
Partners have increasingly recognized the Government’s preference to use the Bank’s rural portfolio (SLP and 
IBLIP) as a platform for support to rural Mongolia and have aligned around the themes of promoting innovation, 
supporting community based approaches to local development, and creating opportunities for sustainable 
livelihoods. In some cases, such as for the European Union, the support is its largest single commitment in 
Mongolia. The TF support has therefore helped partners increase their visibility in the country while enabling 
IDA to leverage additional funds to push forward innovation and capacity building and ultimately increase the 
impact of IDA resources.  

81. 
Finally, the World Bank Group will continue to support the economic development of 
Mongolia through a range of Analytical and Advisory Activities. As Mongolia becomes a middle-
income country that can rely more and more on its own resources to finance its development, the 
World Bank’s key contribution to Mongolia’s development will increasingly take the form of 
knowledge, in-depth analyses, experience sharing with other countries, and the facilitation of training 
activities. Such activities will be organized around programmatic areas that are aligned with the 
development priorities of the country. They will take the form of core economic and sector work, 
just-in-time policy notes, technical assistance, and South -South exchanges. The World Bank Group 
will continue to invest in reaching out to policymakers in Government, Parliament, private sector 
companies, academia, civil society and media while developing these products. 

C. STRATEGIC AREAS THAT THE WORLD BANK GROUP WILL SUPPORT AND EXPECTED RESULTS  

82. 
The strategic areas that the World Bank Group will support reflect the country’s 
development challenges and government priorities, and builds on the priorities outlined in the ISN 
2009-2010. Extensive consultations with key stakeholders reveal a strong desire for the World Bank 
Group’s program to continue along the lines outlined in the Interim Strategy Note 2009 -2010. The 
World Bank Group will continue to support the country’s efforts to transform its economy into a 
world-class mining economy, to support economic development in urban and rural areas, and to 
address vulnerabilities. But there will also be an increased emphasis on economic diversification, 
decentralization, and equitable access to social protection and basic delivery so that growth is more 
inclusive. The widened focus in the program will not translate automatically into additional projects 
but rather will be achieved by adapting ongoing projects (e.g., Multi-Sector TA), designing planned 
projects to the new needs (e.g., SLP3), and by providing analytical support depending on the Bank 
Group’s comparative advantages.  

83. 
The proposed activities are well aligned and complementary to the priorities and projects of 
other Development Partners.  (See Attachment 6). Development Partners’ ongoing commitments to 
Mongolia stand at US$3.2 billion. The largest ODA contributors are: JICA, the People’s Republic of 

20 

 
 
 
 
China, ADB, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the World Bank. JICA invests heavily in 
infrastructure (particularly urban) and education; PRC has ramped up its support in the areas of 
transport, housing development, manufacturing and agricultural processing; ADB focuses on energy, 
transport, water and other municipal services, education, and health. MCC has selected five areas for 
engagement, the most important ones being land rights, transport corridors, vocational education, air 
pollution, and health. In areas where there is joint interest, efforts are made to focus on different sub -
sets. For example, in the education sector, ADB is the lead donor and strongly supports 
improvements in secondary and tertiary education; MCC, GIZ, EU, and UNDP focus on technical 
and vocational training; JICA, UNICEF and the World Bank support early childhood education and 
primary education. In the area of gender, the World Bank participates in the in-country UN Gender 
Thematic Group; UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA have a comparative advantage in advancing 
women’s political representation and fighting against gender-based violence, while the World Bank 
will work more on the gender dimensions in economic development (e.g., labor restrictions, pension 
reform). The Bank plays an important overall donor coordination role through its co-chairing with 
the Government of the annual Meeting of the Government of Mongolia with Development Partners.

In designing and implementing projects and providing advice, particular attention will be 
paid to enhancing the capacity of institutions so that they can manage more effectively and 
transparently. In particular, the Bank will support Mongolia’s anti-corruption efforts through 
specific project work and by mainstreaming good governance and anti -corruption mechanisms in 
Bank operations. As it is feasible, the Bank will seek to support enhancements in lead agency 
operations (i.e., enhancing agency structures and operations for greater transparency and 
accountability) in various sectors the Bank is working with (i.e., Mining, Environment, Health, 
Justice, etc.). The Bank will seek to support the Government’s efforts to create stronger government 
institutions and to engage a broader stakeholder group to develop more effective citizen engagement 
to generally develop greater government and societal resilience to corruption. 

PILLAR 1: ENHANCE MONGOLIA’S CAPACITY TO MANAGE THE MINING 
ECONOMY SUSTAINABLY AND TRANSPARENTLY 

85. 
Through its ongoing program and new activities, the World Bank Group will support the 
Government, private business and civil society (i) in developing a world-class mining environment 
that takes into account social and environmental considerations, and (ii) in strengthening its 
management of public revenues and expenditures. In doing so, the World Bank Group will aim to 
bring greater transparency and accountability to the entire mining value chain through better policies 
and institutional capacity building. The programs of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA will be tightly 
coordinated. 

86. 
Outcome 1.1 – Support the country in developing a regulatory environment, 
institutional capacity, and infrastructure for world-class mining.  

 
Improve regulatory environment and strengthened environmental management capacity. 
Building on the work undertaken so far, the World Bank Group will rely on the ongoing Mining 
Sector Institutional Strengthening Technical Assistance Program (MSISTAP) to provide advice and 
technical assistance, which will include a focus on environmental and social safeguards.  

 Possible “good practice” investments by IFC and MIGA. IFC is leading an international 
consortium together with EBRD for a debt financing of US$3.6 billion for the Oyu Tolgoi copper 
mine development. MIGA has been asked to provide a guarantee for the participating commercial 
banks.  

 Better planning of critical infrastructure in support of the mining sector and neighboring 
communities. The Mining Infrastructure Investment Support project (MINIS) supports the 
preparation of regional 
infrastructure 
investment plans 
that examine 
infrastructure needs 
comprehensively. Some of these projects may be developed as Public Private Partnerships with the 
support from the various WBG institutions (IBRD, IFC, and MIGA).  

 An institutional set-up for greater transparency and accountability. Mongolia’s reporting 
systems will be further enhanced with World Bank support. EITI Mongolia will continue to improve 
the scope and quality of the revenue data , look into legislating mining revenue transparency, and 
expand outreach among civil society, Parliamentarians, and the population. The World Bank will 
continue to use GPF resources to generate greater demand for good governance in the sector.  

22 

 
 
 
 
87. 
Outcome 1.2 – Support the Government in designing and implementing policies and 
systems for a more robust, equitable and transparent management of public revenues and 
expenditures 

 Continued implementation of fiscal, economic and monetary management policies that aim to 
mitigate the impact of Dutch Disease. The World Bank will focus on supporting the Government in 
implementing the Fiscal Stability Law and the Integrated Budget Law through the ongoing Multi -
Sector Technical Assistance Credit and through analytical and advisory services. Through the 
Reserve Asset Management Program (RAMP), the World Bank is also making available to the Bank 
of Mongolia a structured program of training opportunities and tools to enhance its management of 
reserve assets.  

 
Improved implementation of planning, budgeting, procurement, expenditure management, 
financial reporting, auditing, assets and liabilities management policies through continued technical 
assistance and advice. Building on past and ongoing efforts (ECTAC, GAP, and MSTA projects) to 
improve the planning and budgeting capacity of the Government, the World Bank will work closely 
with the National Development and Innovation Committee (NDIC) and the Ministry of Finance to 
improve its capacity in assessing and planning public investments.  

 Roll-out of the decentralization plan for a more participatory and equitable budget that 
reflects local needs and priorities. Regulations will be developed with MSTA support and 
implementation and capacity building will be supported through the third Sustainable Livelihoods 
Program. This will be undertaken in partnership with the Swiss Development Cooperation and in 
coordination with other Development Partners. 

 More transparent and citizen-oriented public management through better data and e -
Government. NSO has been implementing successfully a statistical capacity building project 
(MONSTAT). The World Bank will also explore the possibility of developing an e -Government 
project, closely synergized with an Open Data Initiative. This would be in line with  Mongolia’s 
commitment to participate in the Open Government Partnership. 

PILLAR 2: BUILD A SUSTAINED AND DIVERSIFIED BASIS FOR ECONOMIC 
GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT IN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS  

88. 
The World Bank Group will support the Government’s efforts to diversify the economy and 
generate employment by (i) enhancing its overall competitiveness and (ii) strengthening the 
competitiveness of the agricultural sector.  

89. 

Outcome 2.1 – Enhance the investment climate and financial intermediation 

 An improved investment climate. IFC will continue to build on its business inspections 
project to raise the competitiveness of Mongolian firms, especially SMEs, by making business 
inspections more efficient, effective and transparent.   

 A deeper, more efficient and stable financial system. The Bank will employ a range of 
analytical and lending instruments to support the authorities in: (i) identifying, monitoring and 
addressing the existing and new vulnerabilities in order to make the sector more resilient to possible 
future shocks; (ii) improving access to credit for the MSME sector and general population, including 
in rural and remote areas, and strengthening  financial literacy and consumer protection; and (iii) 

23 

 
 
 
  
expanding the range and quality of financial products provided by non -bank financial institutions, 
including the development of the domestic capital market. IFC will continue to support the financial 
markets in Mongolia by introducing more complex and innovative financial products, working 
closely with Khan Bank and XacBank, in which IFC is a shareholder.  

 Better corporate governance through the deepening of accounting, reporting and auditing 
reforms. Through its FIRST initiative and the MSTA technical assistance, the World Bank will assist 
entity-level implementation of internationally recognized financial reporting standards and internal 
control systems in major public-interest entities, and facilitate the introduction of simplified and 
effective financial management practices in small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs).  

90. 

Outcome 2.2 – Create more opportunities in the rural economy for enhanced livelihoods 

 A more productive, healthier and sustainable livestock sector. The Bank will provide 
investment and analytical activities including implementation of the Livestock-based Livelihoods 
Improvement Project, financed by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) and 
evaluated for its impact with DIME support. The World Bank will also undertake a follow -up project 
to the successful ongoing AHI project. 

 Higher quality and higher value agribusiness through a combination of IFC investments and 
business advisory. IFC’s recent investment in Suu JSC’s dairy company will help to expand its 
network of raw milk herders from 2,500 to 4,000. IFC will continue to assist agribusiness modernize 
production equipments, raise food safety standards, develop supply chains and address working 
capital needs. Complementing the World Bank’s work on animal health, IFC is also assisting the 
Government in the drafting of a Food Security Law to bring food safety inspections to international 
standards.  

 Greater outreach and innovation in microfinance products in rural areas. The Bank has had a 
long and successful engagement in microfinance development in rural areas since the establishment 
of the Microfinance Development Fund (MDF) under the Sustainable Livelihoods Program. The 
Bank will continue to support the increased access to financial services in rural economies, through 
continued support for the MDF (under the Sustainable Livelihoods Program 3), including suppor t for 
new financial products (such as loan guarantee funds to address collateral shortfalls) and for the use 
of ICT for rural finance.   

PILLAR 3: ADDRESS VULNERABILITIES THROUGH IMPROVED ACCESS TO 
SERVICES AND BETTER SERVICE DELIVERY, SAFETY NET PROVISION AND 
IMPROVED DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT  

91. 
In addition to promoting employment creation through economic diversification, the country 
is trying to reduce poverty and vulnerability by: (i) decentralizing more authority to local 
Governments and urban districts, including the delivery of health, education and social welfare 
services; (ii) implementing the reformed social assistance system that supports first and foremost 
poor people and possibly reforming health insurance as well as the pension system to promote more 
equitable, efficient and sustainable social insurance programs; (iii) improving living conditions for 
the people of ger areas through infrastructure investments, housing expansion, and better service 
delivery; and, (iv) acting on several sources of vulnerabilities that have traditionally affected 
Mongolia: climate risks in rural areas, disaster risks in urban areas 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
92. 
Outcome 3.1 – Work with the Government on the design, adoption and implementation 
of a comprehensive social protection system that supports the poor  

 A better understanding of poverty and inequality, including its gender dimensions. The 
World Bank will continue its cooperation with NSO and will support them in their analysis and 
dissemination of poverty data.. Following the recent series of policy notes on poverty, it will enhance 
analysis of inequality and policy responses such as safety net reform, as well as strengthen the focus 
on labor market and employment dynamics as structural change deepens. In those analyses, the 
World Bank will look specifically at the gender dimension of poverty and inequality. It will also 
disseminate a series of policy notes around “women and the labor markets” and “women and 
mining”.  

 A successfully implemented poverty-targeted safety net. The World Bank will continue to 
provide support to the Government as it moves towards a more targeted and transparent system, 
under the social protection component of the Multi-Sector Technical Assistance (MSTA) project and 
technical assistance financed by a Korean Trust Fund. The Bank will also explore a possible Social 
Protection Administration Implementation support operation once the MSTA support winds down.   

93. 
Outcome 3.2 –Support better delivery of basic services (education, health, justice, and 
infrastructure)   

 More responsive and accountable local service delivery through a strengthening of 
participatory processes. Under the Sustainable Livelihoods Program, participatory methods have 
demonstrated the effectiveness of community engagement to plan and deliver local development 
projects. This approach is being adopted as government policy and the Bank will continue to support 
the Government at all levels and communities to operationalize the emerging policy framework.   

 Expanded opportunities for early childhood education and more efficient systems for health 
services. With funding support from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), the World Bank 
will support the Government’s efforts to increase the provision and quality of early childhood. An E -
health project – developed in partnership by the Ministry of Health, Korea and the World Bank – 
would help improve access to secondary and tertiary level clinical services through strengthening of 
the referral process between hospitals. It will work closely with other development partners already 
involved in the sector such as ADB. 

 Better infrastructure planning and prioritization of investments in poor neighborhoods of 
Ulaanbaatar. Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project 3 (USIP3) will aim to support the 
prioritization of infrastructure investments in ger areas through an integrated district level planning 
system and targeted investments in selected areas. The World Bank will also explore with the 
Government how it can encourage affordable and energy-efficient housing development. 

 Greater consistency in judicial decisions and greater predictability of the judicial system. 
Issues relate to lacking capacities of judges and prosecutors, increasing allegations of corruption, lack 
of access to justice in rural areas, and limited public trust in the justice sector. In addition, lack of 
access to relevant information is at the core of ineffective management and opacity of operations. 
The Bank provides support to strengthen these areas through the ongoing Enhanced Justice Sector 
Services Project. 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
94. 
Outcome 3.3 -- Reduce vulnerability of households exposed to natural hazards and 
pollution  

 Cleaner air in Ulaanbaatar. A platform for cooperation among several development partners 
(e.g., ADB, EBRD, GIZ, MCC) has been developed to assist the Government’s coordinated efforts to 
improve air quality in Ulaanbaatar. The Clean Air Project provides financing for a combination of 
short-term and medium-term measures. The project may also lay the foundation for a World Bank 
investment in the expansion of the electricity transmission system or a modernization of district 
heating during this CPS period, possibly with IBRD resources. 

 
A comprehensive approach to risk management in the livestock sector. The Bank will build 
on the ongoing SLP – where the Pastoral Risk Management component supports herders and local 
authorities to better plan and prepare for winter – and the Index-based Livestock Insurance Project 
(IBLIP) which provides a tool for herders to protect themselves from asset loss.  

 A city better prepared to manage disaster risk. Technical assistance funded by GFDRR will 
be provided to improve the disaster preparedness of the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar. Based on 
assessment of hazards and vulnerability, a disaster risk management plan for Ulaanbaatar city will be 
developed in close coordination with JICA. JICA will focus on earthquake risks, wh ile the Bank 
team will look into flood risks in the city.  

IV. IMPLEMENTATION MODALITIES AND RISKS 

A. IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING OF THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

95. 
The Bank will work towards greater use of country systems in the CPS period . This will be 
pursued by moving towards full financial management of projects within the Government’s Public 
Financial Management systems, and by moving towards managing project funds through the 
Government’s Treasury Single Account System. The use of the Treasury Single Account System and 
the Government Financial Management Information System will be rolled out to all Bank-financed 
projects by the end of the CPS. Furthermore, projects will eventually be audited as part of the overall 
audit of the government accounts by the Mongolia National Audit Office.   

96. 
The Bank will strengthen the implementation of the portfolio and increase the focus on 
results. The quality of portfolio implementation continues to be satisfactory, as evidenced by the 
review of ICRs by IEG, yet there is scope for improvement, particularly as it relates to timely project 
completion. Institutional capacity strengthening at national and sub -national level will remain a core 
area of focus during the CPS period. At the initiative of the Ministry of Finance, emphasis will be 
placed on grouping Project Implementation Units around key sectors so that they are better aligned 
with Ministries and can implement multiple donor-funded projects. 

97. 
The Bank will invest in measuring the impact of Bank-funded projects and in sharing 
lessons. During the CPS period, the World Bank will undertake impact evaluations of projects that 
are considered innovative and have potential lessons for Mongolia as well as other countries. 
Specifically, it will evaluate the ongoing Rural Education and Development (READ) project, the 
ongoing Index-Based Livestock Insurance Project, and the new Livestock-based Livelihoods 
Improvement Project.  

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
98. 
The Bank will also pay greater attention in ensuring that projects that will be developed 
during this CPS period are gender-informed. In line with the IDA16 commitments, projects and 
analytical products that may have an impact on gender – such as the Sustainable Livelihoods 
Program, the Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project, and the Social and Environmental 
Assessment of mining – will take such impact into consideration starting from the design stage and 
will integrate gender-differentiated results in their monitoring and reporting system. Such work has 
already been initiated for several of the projects under preparation.  

99. 
The CPS Results Framework will be the key instrument for monitoring progress of the 
Bank’s program of support. The framework is embedded in the first phase of the MDG-based 
Comprehensive National Development Strategy of Mongolia (2007-2015), and narrows down the 
range of outcomes to those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the CPS period.  Use of 
the Country Portfolio and Results Monitoring Tool (CPRT), a web-based system for monitoring CPS 
progress, will be explored. The Bank will also conduct regular Country Program Portfolio Reviews 
(CPPR). 

100. The Bank will strengthen the Government’s ability to manage donor financed development 
projects. The Bank will support the Government’s decision to establish result-oriented Monitoring 
and Evaluation (M&E) systems with a focus on effective and efficient delivery of intended results of 
development projects, strengthening M&E capacity and enhance the quality and accessibility of 
information for decision makers and stakeholders. In the shorter term, this will increase the 
Government’s ability to monitor the implementation of ODA projects, in the long run it will be an 
important instrument to design and manage investment programs supported by the Government's 
own budget. 

101. Mongolia will have access to incremental resources and will be eligible for IBRD 
financing with the presentation of this CPS to the World Bank Board of Executive Directors. The 
Bank Treasury will provide training to government officials early in the CPS period to ensure that 
Mongolia can take full advantage of the range of IBRD financing instruments.  

102. The Bank will prepare a CPS Progress Report in FY14 to evaluate progress towards the 
outcomes outlined in this CPS and make adjustments as required . The Progress Report will 
consider any changes required to respond to the policies of the incoming Government. Any changes 
to the program will be reflected in the project results framework. In particular, the Progress Report 
will include a firm IBRD lending program for the remainder of the CPS period. 

103. The World Bank Group will also invest in greater outreach. The World Bank is upgrading 
its website and is committed to disclose all documents, in line with its Access to Information policy. 
It will continue to make use of the GPF resources to facilitate dissemination and encourage dialogue 
around key policy documents prepared with World Bank support. 

B. MANAGING RISKS  

104. The World Bank Group may need to address several risks during the implementation 
period of the CPS. They range from an unstable global economy with uncertain future prospects, 
domestic macroeconomic stability and management, to political uncertainty as both Parliamentary 
and Presidential elections will take place during the CPS period. Natural disasters such as the 
increased frequency of severe dzuds pose particular risks to the rural parts of the population who 
remain especially vulnerable to climate risk and variability.  

27 

 
105. Slowdown in the global economy. Mongolia’s economic outlook is dependent on global 
macroeconomic factors, in particular commodity prices. Should China’s economy be significantly 
affected by a global economic downturn, it would have major consequences for Mongolia. Dialogue 
with the Government on macroeconomic fundamentals, in close consultation with the IMF, will 
remain a key priority during the next CPS period. Regular monitoring and analysis of the 
macroeconomic and financial indicators, including debt sustainability analysis and banking 
supervision, will be continued in the next CPS period. 

106. Medium term prospects are bright, but in the near term the country remains at risk of 
repeating the boom-bust cycle of the past decade. Public sector spending remains strongly pro-
cyclical. The Bank of Mongolia has been quick to raise policy rates and reserve requirements . Its 
efforts to control rising inflation could be more than offset if extraordinarily large fiscal injections for 
2012 materialize as currently considered. Lack of management of public debt could be destabilizing 
as the country is exploring new avenues to raise significant resources to finance the pressing 
infrastructure needs. The establishment of the Fiscal Stability Fund and the issuance of government 
guarantees to the Development Bank, among others, shift the focus from public debt to the risk 
exposure of the overall balance sheet of the Government. The World Bank will continue to work with 
the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Mongolia and the National Development and Innovation 
Committee to strengthen its capacity, making available its Medium Term Debt Management Strategy 
(MTDS) toolkit.  

107. Other external risks include climate change, weather variability and its impact on 
international prices for agricultural goods. Dzuds, droughts and unexpected temperature 
fluctuations are likely to increase as climate variability becomes more pronounced. The Bank will 
work closely with the authorities to reduce vulnerabilities of herders and increase the resilience of 
ecosystems, both through investment operations and AAA work.  

108. Rising inequality and social perceptions. Global experience suggests that the risks of further 
increases in inequality are real and may create social tensions if left unmanaged. The Bank will work 
with the Government and other partners, first to understand the dynamics and drivers of inequality, 
and also to support public programs to promote greater equality of opportunity and mitigate the 
possible negative distributional effects of the resource-driven growth model. 

109. Political risk in Mongolia, in particular the commitment to sustaining the reform agenda , 
is driven by upcoming elections. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for June 2012 and the 
Presidential election will take place in 2013. Broad consultations undertaken in preparation of this 
CPS point to general support for its key strategic objectives across the aisles of Parliament. Some 
differences among political parties and stakeholders in resolving trade -offs between some of these 
objectives exist, of course. Thus a different order of priorities may emerge depending on the outcome 
of the 2012 elections. The World Bank Group will inform the choices of the current and future 
Governments through good and timely analytical and advisory work . But it will have to remain 
flexible in its approach as highlighted by the experience with the CAS 2004-2008.  

110. The inflow of large amounts of financing for the mining sector poses the risk of increased 
corruption, including in World Bank-funded projects. The World Bank will continue to advocate 
for better governance and to work closely with the Independent Authority Against Corruption. From 
an operational perspective, it will use its projects to promote greater transparency and accountability. 
In particular, it will organize a preventive training workshop on corruption and ethics for all staff 
from the Project Implementation Units and from key Ministries , with the strong support of the 
Ministry of Finance. 

28 

 
111. The World Bank Group may also expose itself to potential reputational risk by getting 
associated with the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine project development . The Oyu Tolgoi management and 
the sponsor are set on making the mine development exemplary and sustainable from a technical, 
social, and environmental perspective. However, due to its sheer size , the complex nature of mining 
development and the economic impact to the country, the Oyu Tolgoi carries a significant importance 
and may attract strong public attention and criticism. The World Bank Group’s overall strategy is to 
have a close coordination among the various institutions involved (Bank, IFC, MIGA) so that the 
Group takes a balanced and comprehensive approach towards the mining sector which should help 
manage risks better.  

112. Capacity of the Government in implementing an increasing number of projects may be 
lagging. While there is a great desire to implement a series of investments, these projects are often 
more complex in nature – from an institutional as well as financing perspectives – than past 
investments. The World Bank Group will continue to invest resources in implementation support and 
will undertake regular portfolio reviews jointly with the Ministry of Finance to identify and address 
potential problems early on. 

113. As the country demands more complex products from Development Partners, the World 
Bank Group will need to focus on attracting and retaining competent staff. With the mining boom, 
the local labor market is evolving rapidly and the WBG will need to be attentive to maintaining its 
competitiveness.  

114. Finally, the transition to non-concessional lending should also lead to a more active 
involvement from the Ministry of Finance in determining the overall World Bank program, and 
from other non-concessional financiers, in Mongolia. In many middle-income countries, the 
Ministry of Finance is a key coordinating agency across Ministries and determines the activities for 
which the country will borrow, based on its financing capacity and the development needs. The 
WBG will work with the Ministry of Finance to enhance its coordinating and management function 
for international development financing.

Period Covered by the Completion Report: July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2011 

Summary of Evaluation Ratings 

Program Performance 

The Completion Report combines a moderately unsatisfactory rating of the achievements of the 
FY05-FY08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and a satisfactory rating of the Interim Strategy 
Note (ISN) programs into an overall conservative rating of moderately satisfactory. Important 
differences characterized the performances of the two strategies, with the ISN providing timely and 
flexible support to Mongolia in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, drawing on important 
lessons learned in the implementation of the CAS, which faced challenges adjusting to changing 
political realities.   

The CAS was strongly aligned with the Government’s growth and poverty reduction strategy 
(Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy, EGSPRS), set an ambitious set of 
outcomes at the time it was designed, and defined a results framework against which progress would 
be monitored. The CAS also envisaged launching a PRSC series that would support the reform 
process in the country and underpin much of the work of the Bank. However, the reform agenda as 
identified in the CAS was not implemented as other priorities emerged following the 2004 general 
elections, including the growth of the mining sector and expansion of public expenditures boosted by 
high mineral prices. The Bank found that the CAS had relied too heavily on the PRSC as the choice 
of instrument, as also reflected in the various indicators identified in the results matrix. When 
circumstances prevented these from going forward, the Bank embarked on a re-alignment of its 
program with the development of new projects (e.g., Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI), Mining Technical Assistance, the Governance Assistance Project, etc.) and a strengthened 
focus on governance, supported by an extensive political economy analysis of the country and in 
particular its mineral resources sector.  

While the program performance of the CAS in light of the above is rated as moderately satisfactory, 
much of the work undertaken during this period was instrumental in setting the stage for considerably 
more flexible and aligned Bank support during the ISN 2009-2010. The formulation of the ISN took 
place at a critical time, with the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, plummeting copper 
prices, and a domestic macro-fiscal crisis, and attention focused on adopting a sustainable fiscal 
management framework, including a prudent assessment of revenues and more targeted and better 
planned expenditures. Support was provided in the form of technical assistance (funded through 
projects as well as the Governance Partnership Facility, GPF) as well as budget support (including 
allocation from the IDA Crisis Window). This re-alignment of the program meant that some projects 
under preparation were dropped. The Bank also mobilized the support of other donors in the country, 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
building consensus around a coordinated platform of assistance to Mongolia. Moreover, it ensured 
the support of the new coalition government, which was keen to take decisive action to address the 
impact of the crisis. The comparative success of the ISN was enabled in part through lessons learned 
in the implementation of the CAS, but is also the result of a design that was more flexible and 
nuanced, providing vital support to the country at a turbulent time. For this reason, the rating of the 
ISN is satisfactory.  

CAS and ISN outcomes and milestones in key areas were fully or partially achieved (supported by 
Bank instruments), such as the enactment of fiscal regulations, stronger public financial management, 
improved mining sector management and governance, reduction of vulnerabilities , and expansion of 
mobile telephony and internet coverage and access. In addition, the Bank was able to introduce 
community participatory processes in several of its activities to enhance their effectiveness and 
transparency. 

Bank’s Performance 

The Bank’s performance in supporting the delivery of the Mongolia CAS and ISN results is 
considered to be moderately satisfactory. After a period of adjustment following the 2004 elections, 
the Bank was able to adjust nimbly to changing circumstances and deliver a substantive portion of 
the envisaged CAS program (albeit with some delays, adjustments, and the addition of some new 
operations) that exceeded the IDA commitment targets. Through activities that were already under 
way, including adjustments to ongoing and planned operations and technical assistance (TA), the 
Bank responded rapidly to the authorities’ request for support during the crisis including two key 
budget support operations which provided the cornerstone of the interim strategy. The Bank 
continued to support the program with relevant AAA and TA, and helped mobilize Trust Funds (e.g., 
education, environment, governance) aligned to the objectives of the CAS. The completed and 
ongoing operations are all rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory for outcomes, development 
objectives, and implementation progress by the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) 
reviews, Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports, and Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) 
evaluations. Nevertheless, weaknesses in the design of the strategy, in part exposed when it became 
apparent that the envisaged PRSC series could not move ahead, are a key factor in the moderat ely 
unsatisfactory rating. 

During the CAS and ISN periods, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) made a number of 
investments in Mongolia totaling US$152 million and provided advisory services in key areas to 
complement the Bank’s strategy by promoting the private sector development.  IEG’s evaluation on 
one of the IFC investments conducted in FY10 was rated “Mostly Successful”. 

I. 

Introduction 

1. 
The Bank Group’s FY05-FY08 CAS for Mongolia was discussed by the Board in April 2004, 
just before parliamentary elections scheduled for June 2004. The CAS was aligned with selected 
priorities of the EGSPRS (discussed by the Bank’s Board in September 2003 along with the Joint 
Staff Assessment Note). Even though the risks of such timing were known, the Bank proceeded with 
the formulation and presentation of the CAS as the commitment to the EGSPRS reform agenda was 
expected to be maintained regardless of the election outcomes. In view of the broad consultations 
undertaken by the Government, the possibility of weakening commitment to the EGSPRS was 
assessed by the Bank’s Mongolia Country Team as a minor risk. Furthermore, the Bank’s Mongolia 
program had operated without a CAS for the preceding three years: the previous CAS covered FY99 -

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY01 and the next one was held back pending the finalization of the EGSPRS so that the Bank’s 
strategy could be aligned. 

2. 
No single party won a clear majority in the June 2004 national election, leading to an 
extended period of political change and a series of coalition gove rnments. Some aspects of the 
EGSPRS implementation lost momentum after the departure of its main supporters following the 
change in government. While there was still overall commitment to the poverty reduction agenda 
with broad ownership of the program, the frequent political changes led to a fragmented and shifting 
development agenda as well as a shorter-term focus. The June 2008 elections gave the Mongolia 
People’s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) a majority but perceptions of voter fraud triggered protests. 
These turned violent, with five people killed. After these traumatic events, the MPRP formed a 
coalition government with the Democratic Party to mend fences.  

3. 
With the end of the FY05-FY08 CAS coverage, and in response to the Government’s request 
for immediate support in the face of the unexpected and severe economic downturn precipitated by 
falling mineral prices and the global financial crisis, the Bank prepared an ISN in April 2009 for the 
next 18 months through the end of CY201011. The ISN reflected the major initiatives, analysis, and 
dialogue that were already underway (such as improvements in the mineral regulatory framework) 
and emerging priorities (e.g., social protection in face of the crisis, and fiscal management). The 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that was under preparation was postponed given the 
uncertainties about the length and depth of the downturn. This Completion Report covers both the 
FY05-FY08 CAS and the CY09-CY10 ISN. 

II. 

Progress towards Mongolia’s Long-term Development Outcomes 

4. 
The Mongolia EGSPRS (issued by the Government of Mongolia in June 2003) was viewed 
as a comprehensive document which aimed to foster development and human welfare and reduce 
poverty by accelerating private sector-led and broad-based equitable growth, and improving the 
efficiency of public expenditures. The EGSPRS articulated key development challenges and priority 
actions organized around five main pillars: (i) ensuring macroeconomic stability and public sector 
effectiveness; (ii) supporting production and exports and improving the environment for private-
sector-led development; (iii) enhancing regional and rural development and environmentally 
sustainable development; (iv) fostering sustainable human development; and (v) promoting good 
governance, and implementing and monitoring the strategy. The joint Bank-Fund staff assessment 
noted its strengths as aligning national development goals – including the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) – with sector strategies and programs; shifting the poverty strategy from income 
transfers and safety nets to growth and sustainable human development; and the potential to align 
donors and stakeholders with the strategy. It also noted important areas for improvements: addressing 
weaknesses in the underlying sectoral and thematic strategies; fitting programs in areas of agreement 
with budgetary resources; and undertaking more diagnostic analysis. 

5. 
The 2004 coalition government, with the strong support of the President, adopted the 
Government Action Plan (GAP, 2008-2012) and National Development Strategy (NDS, 2008-2021) 
based on the MDGs. The ambitious NDS agenda emphasizes (i) achieving the MDGs (reducing 
poverty, promoting gender equality, environmental sustainability, improving health and education 

11 A draft CAS Progress Report was initiated in early 2007, but then shifted to preparation of a full four -year CPS at 
the Government’s request.  However, the draft CPS was delayed following an unexpected change in government in 
late 2007, and again by the June 2008 parliamentary elections.  (Source: Mongolia ISN, 2009, p.15, paragraph 51)

based economy; (iii) exploiting strategic minerals to build savings, growth, and modern processing 
industry; (iv) developing regions and infrastructure to reduce urban -rural disparities; (v) halting 
ecosystem imbalances; and (vi) consolidating political democracy and an accountable system free 
from corruption and red tape. However, while the GAP, NDS, and socio-economic development 
guidelines were fully integrated with the MDGs, they were not prioritized, costed and linked to 
financing sources and a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). 

6. 
Until 2008, the economy performed strongly, due in part to favorable weather and high 
mineral prices for copper and gold. Rising global mineral prices sparked a boom in mineral 
exploration and contributed to rapidly rising government revenues. With improved economic 
performance, the poverty incidence declined to 35.2 percent in 2007 -8 from 61.1 percent in 2002-3. 
However, the macroeconomic situation deteriorated sharply during the latter half of 2008 with the 
global economic downturn and plummeting global copper prices. Growth fell and inflation reached 
34 percent (year-on-year) in August 2008 due to a combination of expansionary fiscal and monetary 
policies and a de facto fixed exchange rate. The economy has since rebounded strongly from the 
sharp drop in outputs in late 2008 and early 2009, largely as a result of policy actions taken by the 
Government during the crisis. Estimates suggest real GDP grew by 6.1 percent (year-on-year) in 
2010, after declining 1.3 percent in 2009. A balanced budget was achieved in 2010, reflecting 
underlying improvements in the economy and the recovery in commodity prices. A recent major 
achievement was the passage of the Fiscal Stability Law (2010) which greatly strengthens the 
medium term fiscal framework.   

7. 
While the country has reached or will reach many of the MDGs at an aggregate level by 
2015, there are strong disparities across the country. The EGSPRS aimed to reduce under-five 
mortality by two-thirds from 87.5 per 1,000 births in 1995 to 29.2 by 2015. It also set the goal of 
halting and reversing the spread of TB. Primary education enrolment rates were set to increase from 
91 percent in 2000 to 100 percent by 2015. Mongolia has done well in extending access to basic 
education and early childhood education. The gross enrollment ratio in primary education reached 99 
percent in 2010, and 76 percent for early childhood education, well ahead of schedule. However, 
learning achievement is low, particularly in rural areas. Under-five mortality (U5MR) fell to 23.8 in 
2008, already below the target set for 2015, reflecting significant historical health sector investments. 
However, there are large rural-urban disparities in the U5MR and infant mortality rates. Adult 
mortality rates are on the rise and are linked to the rising incidence of non -communicable diseases. 
Available data on access to curative health services, although incomplete, suggest that high levels of 
out-of-pocket payments (about 90 percent spent on outpatient care and medicines) constitute a 
significant financial burden to households. The Ministry of Environment and Tourism prepared a 
Strategy on Environmental Policy Reform (2011- 2021) that covers a wide range of priority areas, 
and will be supplemented by the development of a national environmental action plan.  

III. 

Program Performance  

8. 
The FY05-FY08 Mongolia CAS focused on five sets of development challenges: (i) ensuring 
macroeconomic stability and public sector effectiveness; (ii) supporting production and exports and 
improving the environment for private sector-led development; (iii) enhancing regional and rural 
development and environmentally sustainable development; (iv) fos tering sustainable human 
development; and (v) promoting good governance and implementing and monitoring the strategy. In 
response to these challenges, the World Bank Group’s support was organized along three main 
objectives: 1) consolidating the transition; 2): reducing vulnerabilities; and, 3) strengthening the 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
alignment of policies and resources around results. A results framework was designed around these 
objectives in clusters of key results areas and 20 outcomes. Progress towards achieving outcomes 
was to be monitored through multiple indicators and milestones. (Attachment 1 provides details of 
the overall status on the progress and achievement of the outcomes as well as the indicators and 
milestones.) 

IFC’s strategic priorities in Mongolia are to complement the World Bank Group’s strategy by 
promoting the private sector development. Specifically, IFC’s support was focused on three key areas 
through investments and advisory services to help Mongolia position itself for sustainable growth 
and support job creation: (i) support stability and foster the development of financial markets; (ii) 
contribute to the sustainable development of the mining sector and associated infrastructure sectors; 
and (iii) support the development of industrial and agribusiness sectors with a particular focus on 
small and medium enterprises. Crisis response, business and investment environment, climate change 
mitigation and food security were important themes within these key strategic areas. 

9. 
The CAS program targeted systemic and institutional reforms viewed as important to 
achieving overarching EGSPRS objectives. It focused on private sector-led growth, reform of the 
public sector, and reducing household vulnerabilities and proposed annual, single-tranche Poverty 
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) to support the implementation of priority EGSPRS objectives. 
The PRSCs were intended to (i) provide a framework for the Bank’s analytical work, dialogue and 
lending and to leverage Bank resources with other donors around a medium -term reform program; 
and (ii) be sequenced over the four-year CAS period based on readiness (e.g., PRSC I would focus 
on public sector reform, PRSC II on private sector development, and PRSC III on the social sectors). 
Selective lending operations and TA were a lso envisaged to build institutional capacity, implement 
reforms (e.g., public expenditures, infrastructure), and to pilot new approaches (e.g., Sustainable 
Livelihoods Project). During the course of CAS implementation, the program evolved to address 
emerging priorities and circumstances. The ongoing portfolio and lending program were adjusted to 
meet challenges, while some other operations, such as budget support credits, were deferred. 

10. 
The ISN (CY09-CY10) was presented to the Board against the backdrop of government 
efforts to grapple with the economic crisis during the latter half of 2008. The Government was 
focused on restoring economic stability moving away from the populist but unsustainable policies 
pursued during the boom years. The ISN identified overcoming the natural resource curse as the most 
significant medium-term development challenge. It also identified the need for policy adjustments to 
address the economic crisis, protect vulnerable groups from the impact, stabilize and restore 
confidence in the financial sector, as well as the need to urgently develop crisis management 
capacity. The ISN embodied the Bank Group’s existing strategic policy directions and activities in 
support of the Government’s actions to address the short and medium-term challenges. Accordingly, 
the ISN proposed Bank Group support in the key strategic areas of (i) improving macro and fiscal 
sustainability in a mineral-based economy; (ii) protecting the poor and vulnerable; and (iii) 
encouraging transparent and prudent mining investments and a more competitive and stable medium -
term business investment climate. A results framework included these goals and related outcomes 
and milestones (see Attachment 1 for recent status). 

CAS Objective 1: Consolidating the Transition 

11. 
To deepen the transition to a market economy, the CAS focused on removing the remaining 
barriers to effective public service delivery and private sector development. It prioritized support to 
reforms geared towards building a more performance-oriented public sector. Specific reforms goals 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
included a better alignment of public expenditures with policies, an improved investment climate, 
sustainable infrastructure investments, and increased sustainability of social sector financing. 

12. 
Strengthened systems and capacities to align public resources with policy priorities. The 
objective of consolidating reforms for a more performance-based public sector was partially achieved 
with the establishment of a functional Treasury Single Account (TSA) and Government Financial 
Management Information System (GFMIS), as well as greater public access to budget information. 
While the goal of aligning a comprehensive (including donor financed projects and recu rring 
investment costs) MTEF/EGSPRS priorities and costed sector plans was not achieved, progress was 
made on aligning the public investment program with national and sectoral priorities. This included 
requiring the completion of feasibility studies before an investment project enters the budget. These 
institutional improvements were supported by policy triggers under the Development Policy Credits 
(DPCs I and II) and are now included in the draft of the new integrated budget law, expected to be 
passed by Parliament in 2011. The fully functional GFMIS is an important achievement for 
Mongolia, particularly compared with the experience of such projects in other countries. On the 
downside, the goal of establishing an incentive-based civil service has had limited achievements. 
There has only been minor broadening of the salary range and the staffing mix is still not in line with 
MTEF/EGSPRS objectives. Such civil service reforms have proven to be difficult to implement 
effectively in many parts of the world and Mongolia is no exception. Bank-supported projects 
contributed to the outcomes and AAA pieces were effectively used to bring greater realism to the 
agenda.  

13. 
Improved policy, regulatory, financial environment for PSD. The establishment of a 
sound enabling environment for the private sector, including deepening financial intermediation, was 
partially achieved but was negatively impacted by the macroeconomic and financial downturn in 
2008. While the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and Sources of Growth Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) identified the major impediments to stronger private sector development, the 
overall investment climate is still challenging (e.g., Mongolia’s declining relative ranking in the 
Doing Business ratings), though progress was made in some selected sectors (e.g., mining and 
agriculture). Both IDA and IFC teams closely coordinated their activities and collaborated in such 
areas as corporate governance and Doing Business, and maintained a dialogue regarding the 
development and the potential for private sector engagement in mining and other infrastructure 
sectors. The national PSD strategy is still to be endorsed by the authorities, though many 
recommendations of the background technical note are being implemented. The Private Sect or 
Development Credit II, Legal and Judicial Reform Project, and the Financial Capacity Development 
Project supported the strengthening and effective implementation of reforms to facilitate PSD. Most 
of the indicators and milestones for improving the financial environment for PSD were met, but the 
severe banking crisis exposed acute vulnerabilities in the sector, arising in part from inconsistent 
enforcement of sound supervisory practices. The two DPCs supported more consistent enforcement 
of bank supervision, resulting in a bank-by-bank supervision action plan. 

14. 
Strengthened policy and institutional framework to support cost-effective and 
sustainable infrastructure investments. Mongolia’s recent experience with the mineral price boom-
bust cycle and resulting fiscal crisis exposed weaknesses in the public spending framework, the 
Public Investment Program (PIP) process, and the role of short-term political economy incentives, 
particularly related to infrastructure expenditures. However, corrective measures , including 
legislative reforms, are being phased in to smooth future public revenue windfalls and expenditure 
policies. These measures were linked to the development partner-supported reform program triggered 
by the crisis of 2009. There was progress in improving the financial performance of the energy sector 

43 

 
 
 
 
and improving electricity access in rural areas. The Bank was actively engaged in energy through 
projects and AAA such as Infrastructure Strategy and South Gobi Infrastructure and Environment. 
To improve road infrastructure, the Transport Development Project (FY01-FY08) aimed to 
strengthen the planning and asset management capacities of road sector entities. However, in light of 
limited accomplishments, the World Bank opted for phasing out of the road sector. Meeting the CAS 
outcome of increased ICT (Information and Communication Technology) access and coverage in 
Mongolia has been particularly successful. With World Bank financed subsidies combined with 
private sector subsidies from the Universal Service Obligation Fund (established with support from 
the Global Partnership on Output Based Aid), all 335 soums have been provided with access to 
reliable and affordable mobile voice services, with an additional 34 soum centers now equipped with 
broadband internet access for public and private users. Schools are connected at discounted rates, 
there is wider access to internet cafés, and a network of over 170 sa tellite public telephones serve 
herders in remote areas beyond the reach of the mobile networks. The partnership with the private 
sector to promote these services has been instrumental in contributing to the sustainability of the 
outcome.   

15. 
Strengthened social service financing and institutional capacity. There was limited 
progress in improving the financial sustainability and targeting of the pension and social insurance 
program due to modest Government interest in advancing such reforms at that time . More recently, 
there has been renewed interest in Bank technical assistance on various pension system reform areas. 
The Bank has been providing advice to the Government on issues related to the Poverty Targeted 
Benefit (PTB) scheme and the Social Welfare Law (SWL) as part of the key reform areas initiated 
during the crisis and supported by two DPCs from the Bank’s side. In this context, the Bank supports 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the implementation of the second phase of the Proxy Means 
Testing (PMT) survey and through the social protection component in the Multi-Sectoral TA Project. 
Other ministries (health and education) have also expressed interest in using PMT to target 
beneficiaries. Progress was made on education sector outcomes to improve the delivery of 
services by better linking needs with spending. The Bank facilitated the education outcomes 
through: (1) the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) Catalytic Fund grant that 
supports the improvement of education access and quality, particularly for herders’ children; (2) 
an IDA grant for the Rural Education and Development (READ) Project which provides 
classroom libraries and teacher training to raise the literacy skills of students in Grades 1-5; (3) 
and additional IDA financing to support the use of net-books to improve learning. The major 
impact has been an improvement in the learning environment and facilities, which in turn has 
laid the foundation for improvement in reading skills in rural schools. Although Mongolia 
received an Education Program Development Fund (EPDF) grant to participate in the 
international assessment of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 
and Program of International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), the Ministry of Education, 
Culture and Science (MECS) decided not to implement the full scale survey in 2011. Meanwhile, 
Mongolia has applied for an EFA FTI Graduation Grant to finance the building of kindergartens. 
For higher education, the accreditation system is being improved thanks to Bank analytical work 
being implemented under an ADB education project . As part of CAS selectivity and in light of the 
strong involvement by ADB in this sector, Bank support to the health sector was at the margin 
through small grants. However, the client and partners value the Bank’s role in global best practices, 
knowledge and innovation (e.g., AAA on output-based budgeting in the health sector funded by seed 
grant from the Results Based Financing Trust Fund). 

CAS Objective 2: Reducing Vulnerabilities 

44 

 
 
 
16. 
As part of the CAS, the Bank set the objective of increasing support to efforts aimed at 
reducing risks to vulnerable populations, particularly in rural areas, and to improve the delivery of 
services. It would support innovative and pilot initiatives (such as livestock insurance), better natural 
resource management, sustainable regional development and stronger municipal governance and 
urban services including for ger areas. 

17. 
Strengthened risk management and growth to reduce rural vulnerability. Under this 
results area, the twin CAS objectives were (i) strengthen systems that reduce risk and improve 
service delivery to vulnerable populations, and; (ii) address the key sources of rural vulnerability by 
expanding support. Both the Sustainable Livelihoods Project (SLP) and the highly innovative Index -
Based Livestock Insurance Project (IBLIP) helped to address risk and vulnerability, with the latter 
providing livestock insurance coverage to 14 percent of targeted herders, a rate higher than originally 
envisaged. Based on its early success, IBLIP is now being expanded nationwide to protect herders 
from the vulnerability of natural and environmental risks and to improve the country’s risk 
management system. Almost 36,000 sub-loans, for a total of US$30.4 million, have been disbursed 
by banks and non-bank financial institutions under the micro-finance component of the SLP, 
benefitting almost 164,000 people directly or indirectly. The project has made major contribution to 
decentralization in the country, first and foremost by piloting a model of community participation in 
public investment at local level, with lessons from the project incorporated in the integrated budget 
law. SLP is also helping more than 176,000 herder families improve their pastoral management 
skills, emphasizing winter preparedness and a reduction in the vulne rability of livestock. The 
targeting of community level infrastructure projects (e.g. renovation of school dormitories) also seem 
to be succeeding with high satisfaction rates among beneficiaries. 

18. 
Strengthened environmental and natural resource management. The Bank supported 
efforts to improve national and community level environmental governance and natural resource 
management (NRM), which has obvious linkages to vulnerability. The Bank-administered 
Netherlands-Mongolia Trust Fund for Environmental Reforms (NEMO 1 and 2) helped generate a 
range of activities and analyses to advance environmental protection and the sustainability of NRM, 
including through improvements in environmental laws and standards. Also under NEMO, the 
Steppe Forward Programme produced the Mongolian Biodiversity Databank, and the legal 
framework for NRM was revised. A series of studies were carried out to deepen the understanding of 
environmental issues such as ground water resource and managing the mining impact on the 
environment. Public consultations and access to information on Environmental Impact Assessments 
(EIA) were actively promoted.  The publication of all existing EIAs on the internet was further 
supported by DPC2. The CAS outcome for piloting community-based NRM systems in selected 
soums was indirectly supported through the Sustainable Livelihoods Projects. 

19. 
Improved municipal service delivery for Ulaanbaatar peri-urban residents. Progress was 
made in improving service delivery to vulnerable groups in the peri -urban areas of the capital. 
Provision of water supply and kiosk operations improved gradually, directly benefiting the low -
income ger households. Under the Bank-funded Second Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project, 
about 280 water kiosks and 100 individual connections for water and sanitation have been made in 
the ger area of Ulaanbaatar. As a result, the number of people per water kiosk has been nearly halved 
to 892 with approximately 300,000 benefitting. The service performance of the Water Supply and 
Sewerage Authority was improved by reducing unauthorized water and electricity consumption . 
Operation costs were also reduced, while water and wastewater tariffs were increased over the past 
three years. However, the water utility’s financial sustainability of has still not been achieved.  

45 

 
 
 
 
 
20. 
Improved viability of initiatives to reduce rural-urban disparity. The CAS proposed to 
inform the Government’s regional development strategies (which aimed to reduce disparities and 
included large infrastructure investments) with analytical work, analysis of options, and the study of 
cross-country experiences with such efforts. However, the post-2004 government had less interest in 
regional development strategies, except in South Gobi where most of the mining boom is happe ning. 
The Bank thus undertook a large piece of AAA, the Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy which 
looked at the institutions and investments needed to support the growth potential of Southern 
Mongolia. 

CAS Objective 3: Strengthening the Alignment of Policies and Resources Around Results 

21. 
In alignment with a key pillar of the EGSPRS, the CAS aimed to strengthen the national 
institutional framework and capacities to design, implement, and monitor the c ountry’s poverty 
reduction strategies and programs in close coordination with other development partners. Supporting 
the government efforts to formulate and implement the related sector strategies and building 
consensus would be important as well as the coordination and harmonization of donor procedures. 
After the EGSPRS was adopted, the country priorities evolved and the EGSPRS could no longer be 
used as a platform for coordination and development effectiveness. The Bank adjusted to these new 
realities and focused on enhancing donor coordination and ensuring results within the Bank -funded 
activities.   

22. 
To support stronger aid coordination and harmonization, the Bank assisted the Government 
in moving from the Consultative Group mechanism focused on pledging aid to the more operational 
biannual Technical Meetings (TM) and Sector Working Groups (SWG). The TM mechanism was 
particularly effective in coordinating support to the Government in addressing the 2008-2009 
economic crisis. The World Bank played the coordinating role with the IMF, the ADB, JICA, and 
USAID in mobilizing the budget support needed to support the Government’s action plan. The 
combination of strong policy actions and adequate external resources played a major role in the 
country’s ability to mount a quick turn-around, and laid the foundation for a significant improvement 
in its medium to long-term development strategy. The Bank adjusted quickly to the crisis by 
reallocating two-thirds of its IDA envelope to development policy lending, suppo rted by existing or 
restructured TA projects and just-in-time AAA. Donor coordination in sectors such as education 
(e.g., sector-wide approach around the Fast Track Initiative) and mining has been useful.   

23. While some progress has been made on the harmonization agenda, leadership in coordinating 
aid at all levels by the Government needs further strengthening. Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) is now included in the budget (with the Bank setting good practice), but there are still issues 
with lack of transparency and limited dissemination of aid-related statistics and information. The 
Government is now moving towards partnership relations with the donors that are more in line with 
its emerging middle-income country status, signaling its desire to rely more on its own resources 
rather than on aid. 

ISN Objectives 

24. 
Under the ISN, the Bank sought to support the authorities’ urgent response to the crisis and 
associated reforms to improve medium-term economic management, with a particular focus on the 
economy’s mineral dependence. The 2008 severe economic downturn gave an opportunity for the 
Government to revisit its financing mechanisms and management of mineral resource revenues. The 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bank, through the Economic Capacity Building TA and the Governance Assistance Project as well as 
policy dialogue, had already been actively working with the Government to strengthen pro -cyclical 
fiscal management, investment planning, and the linkages among the various strategies and policy 
documents such as the Government Action Plan (GAP), the Medium-Term Budget Framework 
(MTBF), and the Socio-Economic Guidelines (SEG). While the crisis exposed substantial policy 
weaknesses, it also provided the opportunity to correct these and initiate a series of significant 
reforms in key areas. The ISN formalized this reform agenda and articulated the program for CY09-
CY10 under three strategic areas. 

25. 
ISN Strategic Area 1: Improve Macro and Fiscal Sustainability in a Mineral -Based 
Economy. The crisis provided the opportunity to support major policy reforms which had been 
stalled for a long time. These reforms were supported by an IMF-led stabilization package, with 
budget support being provided by the ADB, Japan, Australia, the US, India, and the World Bank. 
The 2010 Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) was the centerpiece of these reforms and its implementation is 
currently being phased in. The 2011 budget available for current expenditures is already based on 
smoothed-out mineral prices, with the balance being saved in a stabilization fund. However, the 
structural balance rule that caps the deficit to a certain level of GDP will only start being applied in 
2013. While the Bank, in order to avoid cross-conditionality, did not include passage of the FSL in 
the DPCs, it supported the drafting of the legislation and organized an intense outreach program to 
Parliament with the view of building consensus around the law. The Bank’s crucial role is widely 
acknowledged. Similarly, improvements to the PIP were given important momentum during the 
crisis and have now been included in the new integrated budget law. In the banking sector, t he 
supporting program met the original objectives of restoring confidence in the banking system, 
although it did not fully address the problem of underlying financial sector vulnerabilities, which 
continue to make the system prone to future crisis. 

26. 
ISN Strategic Area 2: Protect Poor and Vulnerable Groups. The ISN outcome of 
retargeting social assistance to the poorest has gained traction with the development of a 
methodology for Proxy-Means Testing (PMT) and the roll-out of the survey to build the national 
beneficiary database. The official implementation of the PMT-based Poverty Targeted Benefit 
scheme is pending the enactment of the Social Welfa re Law. In the meantime, the universal Child 
Money Program (CMP) has been replaced by universal cash transfers from the Human Development 
Fund. The Sustainable Livelihoods Project , in particular through its Community Initiatives Fund 
component, addresses the vulnerability of rural populations. It has supported the community-led 
investment projects, including renovation of dormitories and schools, improved healthcare facilities, 
improvements in local infrastructure (from public bath houses to street lighting ), and increased 
economic opportunities (e.g., through the construction of hay storage facilities and water points for 
cattle). The Index-Based Livestock Insurance Program is already available in 15 aimags and 
addresses pastoral and disaster risk management. Bank support for reducing vulnerabilities in urban 
areas aimed to enhance municipal planning capacity and urban services with a focus on ger areas . 
Key analytical and diagnostic pieces have already been completed and are informing policies and 
providing clear cost-benefit choices. Additional financing for the Energy Project is improving the 
reliability and financial sustainability of electricity distribution companies. The performance of these 
outcomes is satisfactory as many of them are partially or ful ly achieved and each outcome addressed 
the urgent needs of the Ulaanbaatar municipality. 

27. 
ISN Strategic Area 3: Encourage Transparent and Prudent Mining Investments and a 
More Competitive and Stable Medium-term Business Investment Climate. The program has 
been successful in pursuing objectives aimed at improving the management of the sector , although 

47 

 
 
 
 
the remaining challenges are substantial. The legislative framework for mining is evolving and 
should soon reach a stable stage more consistent with international good practices. Establishing a 
balanced and sustainable fiscal regime for the mining sector remains the greatest challenge. 
Constantly changing provisions, with sometimes aggressive taxation, discourage investments in 
exploration and development by reputable companies and encourage corruption and tax evasion by 
less credible companies. The repeal of the windfall profits tax was well received but was then 
somewhat replaced with a high royalty regime supported by government -fixed commodity prices. 
Bank engagements that are making significant contributions include the Mining TA Project, the 
DPCs, and the Governance Assistance Project. Ad hoc fiscal regime changes are a strong 
disincentive for investment and should remain a major focus of future efforts for dialogue and 
engagement. Since the opening of Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world’s largest copper mines, and Tavan 
Tolgoi, a six billion ton coal resource, the Bank has focused on support to ensure that mining 
revenues are translated into positive development outcomes. These efforts have included 
strengthening governance across the mining value chain by promoting broader and more informed 
public accountability. Key achievements included the EITI compliant designation received by 
Mongolia in 2010 and improvements in the transparency of the mining cadastre . Understanding the 
long term importance of Oyu Tolgoi as a critical growth source for the development of the country, 
IFC, in close coordination with the Bank, has been working closely with the private develop er and 
partner banks with a goal to arrange a multi-billion US$ debt financing package for the sustainable 
development of this world class mine project, as well as actively engaging in technical, 
environmental and social due diligence and advisory services initiatives including community 
development program. 

28. 
Throughout, the World Bank placed a strong emphasis on encouraging greater transparency 
and accountability. Starting with an in-depth political economy analysis, the Bank aimed to foster 
public dialogue around key development issues anchored in facts and informed by other countries’ 
experiences. It did so on both the supply and demand sides of governance, the latter thanks to the 
support of the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF). For example, in addition to advancing greater 
transparency in the allocation of mining licenses through the reform of the mining cadastre, the Bank 
also initiated the establishment of an independent think tank and supported the training of Mongolian 
journalists in economic and mining matters. 

IV. 

Bank’s Performance 

29. 
The Bank did well to adapt to the evolving circumstances soon after the 2004 CAS was 
discussed. In September 2005, the Bank agreed with the new government to refine the CAS priorities 
and deliverables. With the PRSC series stalled, the Bank reformulated its approach to focus on key 
planned investment lending often modified to meet emerging challenges (e.g., Private Sector 
Development Credit II, Rural Education Development), additional operations to meet new pri orities 
(e.g., Governance Assistance Project, Renewable Energy for Rural Access, Enhanced Justice Sector 
Services), technical assistance (e.g., Mining Sector TA), and non -lending technical services aimed at 
achieving the key development goals and outcomes that had been identified in the CAS. It was also 
successful in raising grant resources to address the country’s needs, with resources for recipient 
executed trust funds more than tripling from US$23.55 million in FY05 to US$74.5 million in FY11 . 
Moreover, the Bank mobilized resources from donors to co-finance a range of IDA operations, 
facilitating strengthened donor collaboration and coordination at the sector level. Examples of this 
include, among other, EU support for SLP2, its largest commitment in Mongolia, Swiss and Korean 
support for IBLIP, Japanese support for project preparation and the Ulaanbaatar Services 
Improvement Project, and support from the Netherlands for NEMO and the Renewable Energy 

48 

 
 
 
 
Project, etc.. As the 2008-2009 economic crisis deepened, the Bank Group deferred the approval of 
the next CAS and instead adopted an 18-month ISN to support the Government’s urgent priorities. 
The ISN incorporated major Bank initiatives that were already underway (e.g., the focus on the 
mining sector) and framed the Bank’s program around key priority areas needed to stage a quick 
recovery and form the basis for an improved medium-term policy agenda. 

30. 
Two DPC budget support operations provided the cornerstone of the interim strategy and 
accounted for US$70 million of the indicative ISN FY09-FY11 IDA envelope of US$90 million 
(actual IDA commitments over FY09-FY11 now stand at US$131 million). In addition, components 
of several ongoing operations were reoriented to support the DPC policy areas . The DPCs were 
designed to help the Government manage the economic downturn triggered by the collapse of copper 
prices and helped meet urgent financing needs. The single -tranche DPC-1 supported reforms in the 
areas of fiscal policy and management, social protection, the f inancial sector, and the mining sector. 
Collaboration among key partners (e.g., IMF, ADB, Japan, US) was close and effective given the 
urgency of the situation and the short time span for preparation. DPC-2 supports the significant 
reforms that the Government has undertaken since the economic crisis in 2008 including sustaining 
the economic recovery and developing a stable fiscal framework through improved fiscal policy and 
management; designing a social protection system that supports the poorest people through economic 
downturns; preparing a framework for a sounder financial sector; and maintaining an attractive 
investment climate for mining. The ICR review rated DPC-1 as being satisfactory while the IEG 
rating, which was provided one year after the approval of the DPC and before the passage of the 
Fiscal Sustainability Law, was moderately satisfactory. 

31. 
Overall, the Bank has been able to make substantial progress in assisting the Government in 
key areas selected for support under the CAS and the ISN (strengthening public financial 
management and fiscal and public investment policies; addressing the needs of poor rural residents; 
supporting infrastructure development, with particular success in the ICT sub-sector; improving the 
alignment of resources with policies; and moving towards greater clarity of the mining sector policies 
and safeguards. In some areas where the Bank did not have substantial IDA allocations, it was able to 
leverage other resources, co-financing, and TFs, and also provide support through AAA and global 
cross-country experience sharing. The approval of a GPF for Mongolia was a key pillar of the 
increased outreach to stakeholders undertaken by the Bank to support the Government’s re sponse to 
the crisis and the increased appetite for demand-driven initiatives to improve accountability in public 
service delivery. However, there was slower traction in other areas such as designing and launching 
the MTEF, civil service reforms, social welfare reform, and restructuring of the banking sector. 

32. 
Lending Volumes. Over the FY05-FY08 (CAS) period, the Bank approved 10 projects 
worth US$99.6 million (of which US$50.1 million as IDA credits, and US$49.6 million as grants) . 
Under the ISN, the Bank approved an additional US$130.7 million of IDA financing (Mongolia is 
currently not eligible for IDA grants) during FY09-FY11 with the approval of seven projects, 
including two DPCs for US$69.7 million. (See Attachment 2). During the FY05-FY08 CAS period, 
IFC committed US$57.6 million of debt and equity financing in eight projects; during the ISN 
period, IFC provided additional US$94.4 million in 14 projects. FY11 saw a record level of 
commitments in a given FY with US$83.3 million and seven projects. 

33. 
IFC’s Performance. During the CAS and ISN periods IFC made a number of investments in 
Mongolia, which were strongly aligned with the WBG and IFC strategy. In the financial markets 
sector, IFC’s investments supported banking consolidation; increased banks’ lending volumes to 
target underserved segments, and expandED product and service offerings in the market. These 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
investments also included institutional strengthening and advisory work to improve risk management 
and spread best practice lending standards.  IFC has successfully established trade finance lines with 
five local banks.  IFC’s involvement and advisory services support to Mongolia’s Credit Information 
Bureau helped develop the country’s financial markets infrastructure.  IFC is also enhancing the 
investment activities in the real sector with a focus on local corporations with diversified portfolios, 
which in FY08 led to a US$30 million investment in MCS Holdings LLC, one of Mongolia’s leading 
private companies diversified across such sectors as food and beverage, cashmere, and real estate. 
FY11 became a record year for IFC in Mongolia in terms of its investment activity (investments have 
been made in seven projects worth US$83.3 million, including US$50.0 million for the construction 
of the first Shangri-la hotel in Mongolia, US$20.0 million sub-debt in Khan Bank, US$7.0 million in 
the first private equity fund specialized in SMEs, and US$2.0 million in Suu Dairy, the largest dairy 
company in the country).  

During the same period, IFC significantly increased its advisory services in Mongolia with over 
US$4 million in projects funded jointly by IFC, the governments of Japan, Netherlands and clients, 
to help develop the business and investment climate and support financial markets. There are three 
ongoing advisory projects in Mongolia focused on Investment Climate (Business Inspections 
Reform), Corporate Governance and Access to Finance (trade finance, leasing, credit information, 
mobile banking).  IFC, in close coordination with the Bank, is also exploring PPP advisory services 
to the Government of Mongolia. 

34. 
Analytical and Advisory Activities. The CAS planned an ambitious AAA program for 
Mongolia and placed strong emphasis on collaborative efforts, more effective implementation, policy 
linkages, consensus-building, and dissemination. (See Attachment 3). Key AAA delivered to the 
client include major reports on mining, cashmere, and the enabling environment for social 
accountability; infrastructure strategies; assessments of poverty, the investment climate, and the 
financial sector; public expenditure reviews; a report on public investment planning; and an extended 
series of Netherlands-financed reports on Mongolia’s environment. ESW products focused mostly on 
economic and public sector governance followed by infrastructure, rural development, finance, and 
social sectors. Many of the completed tasks offered the Government and development partners the 
much-needed basis to advance the policy and sector dialogues. The individual elements of the DPC 
policy matrices, for example, were identified from, and supported by, previous analytical work , 
including in the banking sector where the results from a recent Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP) and other diagnostic work were extremely relevant and timely. The Multi-Sectoral TA 
Project is addressing accounting and auditing weaknesses identified by the AAA Report on the 
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). The Bank’s quarterly, and then, from April 2009, 
monthly, Economic Updates played an important role in disseminating the rationale for, and progress 
on, reform measures, along with updates on the impact of the crisis on the macroeconomic, financial 
and corporate sectors. A QAG review of 11 tasks (over FY02-FY06) found that despite an 
unfavorable political and institutional context, the Bank’s AAA program was satisfactory in its 
strategic relevance, quality, and dissemination.   

35. 
Results Framework. The analysis of the challenges in the CAS underestimated the political 
economy realities, and the proposed strategy was somewhat complex and ambitious. The strategy 
was predicated on robust macroeconomic management, strong adherence to the poverty reduction 
objectives of the EGSPRS, and continued commitment and implementation of the reform programs 
including substantive institutional changes. Events were overtaken first by the uncertainties 
subsequent to the 2004 election, and then by the windfall earnings from mineral exports and the 
impact of the natural resource curse. They were further exacerbated by public expenditures and 

50 

 
 
 
 
policies which were dominated by short-term perspectives and “pork barrel” political economy 
considerations. In retrospect, the design of the results framework was overly intricate with too many 
outcomes, indicators and milestones (some of which were not amenable to clear monitoring). 
Outcomes and indicators described in the text and text tables did not match the matrix and there were 
overlaps among some of the outcomes. The ISN results matrix is relatively simpler and outcomes are 
better aligned with proposed Bank Group instruments, including the planned DPC prior actions.  

V. 

Key Lessons and Recommendations 

36. 
The lessons and recommendations for the next Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) draw 
upon the evaluation of the performance of the CAS and ISN, as well as feedback received from 
various stakeholders. Most counterparts viewed the Bank’s comparative advantage as an effective 
convener, especially in donor coordination, and as a major global institution guided by a strategic 
focus on results and analytical strength with the ability to create significant and effective knowledge 
products. However, some who worked with the Bank during the CAS period saw the EGSPRS as a 
complex Bank-Fund instrument that was needed to facilitate the allocation of significant amounts of 
concessional funds to Mongolia.  

37. 

Some key lessons and suggestions for the next CPS include: 

 Build in flexibility to take account of transitions and emerging priorities . While the alignment 
and synchronization of the Bank’s country strategy with selected nationa l priorities and 
development plans are the correct approaches to ensure broad ownership and commitment, 
efforts should be made to build in flexibility to accommodate government and electoral 
transitions as well as emerging and unforeseen developments. Unde rtaking consultations of 
proposed CPS priorities and instruments with wider segments of stakeholders, including 
parliamentarians and political entities in the opposition, could also reduce risks. Maintaining 
flexibility, alternative programming, and strong dialogue on strategic priorities across key 
ministries, parliamentary committees, and civil society will be essential. This will be particularly 
critical as the Mongolian economy is expected to grow rapidly over the next five years and its 
needs may change rapidly too.  

 Focus on fewer outcomes and ensure a clear results framework . The last CAS had an ambitious 
and complex results framework with multiple outcomes, indicators, and milestones. The next 
CPS should have a results agenda which (i) is aligned wi th selected national development 
priorities, (ii) takes account of the activities of development partners, (iii) engages in areas with 
strong client demand where the Bank has a comparative advantage and track record of 
performance in the country, but at the same time supports innovation by bringing in global 
experience; (iv) is simple and has only a few selected outcomes and clearly monitorable 
indicators and milestones; and (v) links directly with proposed instruments and activities. In fact, 
the CPS results framework should adopt existing and proposed project-level outcomes and 
indicators to the extent possible. Benchmarks and monitoring mechanisms should be set up as 
early as possible. 

 The advancement of sound development policies – be it through investment lending, budget 
support, and AAA – is the most sustainable impact of the Bank in Mongolia . Over the past seven 
years, policies and innovations have been introduced successfully through investment lending 
(e.g., ICT project, IBLIP) as well as budget support operations (e.g., the FSL through DPC-1). 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These were supported by quality analytical work and had strong ownership within the 
Government. The crucial importance of understanding the political economy context for policy 
reforms also needs to be underscored. 

 Design programs/projects to minimize implementation challenges . Given capacity constraints, 
simplification of project design should be a priority in Mongolia. This does not, however, imply 
that projects should not be innovative. Mongolia has, in fac t, proven that it can implement 
innovative and technically complex projects with significant policy impact (e.g., IBLIP). 
Furthermore, to reduce the implementation costs, greater reliance on country systems for 
procurement processes and financial management could be explored in conjunction with capacity 
strengthening as warranted. Repeater projects, programmatic lending (for example in urban 
development, direct poverty support, Public Financial Management), and additional financing 
operations can also reduce costs. 

 Take a programmatic approach to AAA. Given the longer-term nature of the engagement in 
Mongolia and the fact that Mongolia will increasingly value the Bank for its knowledge 
contributions, the Bank should consider multi-year programmatic ESW and TA programs in key 
areas (e.g., public expenditures, governance, civil service reforms) while continuing with 
responsive, just-in-time policy notes and advisory pieces, and systematic follow-through on AAA 
findings and recommendations. 

 Consider longer-term role of the Bank in Mongolia. The role of the Bank in Mongolia will need 
to adjust as the country graduates from IDA to IBRD status during the period of current CAS. 
Mongolia will become less reliant on ODA, and some traditional donors may reorient their 
support to other low income countries, which in turn may affect the ability of the Bank to 
mobilize Trust Fund resources. This will require strategic selectivity and emphasis on areas 
where the Bank has a comparative advantage.

Not achieved.  Sector ceilings are currently not enforced and there is 
no comprehensive MTEF based on bottom-up sector priorities.  
However, program classification was introduced in the chart of 
accounts starting in 2009. 

Key Lessons and Suggestions for the New CPS 

The MTEF goal was not achieved because, as has been the 
common experience in many countries, the reform was too 
complex given the capacity on the ground.  A less ambitious 
approach, with embedded advisors providing technical 
assistance to the Government on phased implementation, 
should have been pursued. 

GFMIS was funded through three projects: the Fiscal TA 
(now closed), ECTAC, and GAP.  It succeeded due to close 
Bank supervision, and sound project management on the 
ground.

2007; bonuses linked to

Not achieved.  Pay compression was 3.1 in 2008; bonuses are not 
linked to performance evaluation.  Salary raises in Mongolia have been 
across-the-board and have not addressed pay compression.  However, 
civil service pay, on average, is not unattractive when benefits and job 
security are factored in.

The relative lack of progress on civil service reform is not 
surprising given the World Bank’s general experience (see 
2008 IEG evaluation).  The Bank was too ambitious in this 
regard, with a large (US$0.9 million) QCBS contract with a 
consulting firm to design a civil service reform strategy 
which resulted in hundreds of pages of reports of variable 
quality that could not be implemented.  The Bank’s 
approach to the HRMIS was also weak, with insufficient 
upfront analytical work to understand the HR arrangements 
in Mongolia and the challenges that developing such a 
system would entail.  Once the ESW report was completed 
in 2009, and the challenges recognized, the approach was 
changed and currently a much more modest HRMIS is 
under development.

The Civil Service Law was amended in 2008 in line with some of the 
recommendations of the Civil Service Reform Strategy.  Notable 
changes include increased autonomy of the Civil Service Council 
giving it responsibility for determining the classification, ranking, and 
grading of civil servants, and for annually benchmarking civil service 
pay with private sector comparators; and giving it increased authority 
in dispute resolution.  Comprehensive HRMIS is not in place.  The 
bidding was cancelled three times and the scope of the project has been 
reduced.  Currently, a scaled-down HRMIS is under development. 
Results Area B: Improved policy, regulatory financial environment  for PSD 
Outcome 3: Improved 
enabling environment for 
private sector-led growth 

Outcome indicators: 

Government, donor 
resources aligned to 
prioritized reform agenda to 
support PSD, including  
mining, livestock, other 
sectors 

Achieved.  Investment Climate Assessment (2006) and Sources of 
Growth Country Economic Report (2007) identified a set of concrete 
recommendations aimed at promoting private sector activity and 
greater integration with the global economy in a way that leads to job 
creation, broad-based growth and poverty reduction.  A number of 
these recommendations have been since implemented by the 
authorities, including streamlining of foreign trade procedures, and 
reduction of tax burden.  Work on simplification of the inspection 
regime and corporate governance reform (including overhaul of the 
company law) is currently underway.  Lines of credit from the Bank 
and other donors facilitated access to finance by private SMEs.  In 
addition, significant progress has been made in improving the 
investment climate and business environment in specific sectors 
including mining and agriculture.  

Public, including 
businesses, able to easily 
access all laws, regulations, 
policies, and their drafts; 
citizens able to appeal 
administrative decisions  

Achieved.  Access to legal and judicial information was improved by 
creating a virtual legal information portal and allowing for more 
efficient dissemination of laws and other legal information among 
government ministries and agencies through the creation of the 
electronic United Information Network (UIN) in the National Legal 
Center (NLC).  As a result, the NLC provided (i) legal and judicial 
information to 30 government organizations, agencies and ministries; 
and (ii) facilitated public access to this information via two websites 
containing the laws of Mongolia, court decisions, decrees of ministries

The WBG’s engagement has proven to be most effective 
when policy advice and TA were complemented by an 
investment loan (LJRP).  The impact of analytical work 
such as the ICA and Country Economic Report chapter has 
been more limited, partly because it was not systemically 
followed through by the Bank team due to the need to direct 
limited internal resources to more urgent work in the 
financial sector.  Although interventions at the sectoral level 
(e.g., mining and agriculture) have resulted in an improved 
enabling environment in relevant industries, the overall 
investment climate for private firms is still challenging, as 
shown by Mongolia’s slipping in Doing Business rankings 
in recent years.  In particular, regulations for opening and 
closing a business, trading across borders, and getting credit 
result in costs to business that are higher than in most other 
East Asian economies.  Prompt and consistent enforcement 
of regulations is also an issue.  Going forward, it would be 
advisable for the WBG to agree with the authorities and 
other donors on a time-bound plan for dealing with the 
identified impediments to private sector operations, and 
allocate commensurate TA and lending resources in support 
of the plan implementation.  In view of the anticipated 
mining boom, it is particularly important to focus on 
enhancing competitiveness of private firms working in other 
sectors in order to maintain a degree of economic 
diversification. 

There needs to substantial and sustained effort to maintain 
and expand the web portals and the UIN and to publicize the 
existence and utility of this database in order to ensure an 
increase in the number of public users of these internet sites.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and government agencies, and court commentaries.  The success of 
these websites was illustrated by 2007 survey results which showed a 
100% increase in public access to information about the courts system 
through the internet, a year after the websites were fully activated.  In 
addition, the Bank supported the establishment of the newly created 
administrative courts and the new Supreme Court Chamber for 
administrative cases.  These courts are functioning well and citizens 
have ready access to the appellate level. 

Trade Facilitation 
and Integration 
(FY10); Annual 
Doing Business 
Reports (regular); 
PSD Technical Note 
(2008) 

In 2008, the Bank prepared a PSD technical note at the request of the 
Government with the aim to provide the authorities with the analytical 
foundation for a country PSD strategy.  Although many 
recommendations from the above report have since been taken into 
account by the authorities, the national PSD strategy was not adopted 
formally due to the onset of the financial crisis in late 2008. 

The national legal information center was established, including a 
comprehensive library of laws and regulations. The legal information 
website was set up  and is being maintained.  Administrative courts 
have been staffed and trained.  The establishment of the NLC allowed 
for the creation of a new legal institution in Mongolia capable of 
providing the MOJHA, the judiciary and the legal profession with 
research and training capacities.  In combination with the UIN’s legal 
and judicial databases, connected electronically to 30 government 
ministries and units, and provision of access to the public at large 
through on-site free computer use and library facilities, increased 
efficiency and transparency in providing access to the full corpus of 
Mongolian law and court decisions to end users were accomplished. 

Intermediate indicators:

framework: reduction in 
NPLs from 8% of assets to 
below 5% by 2007; 
improved rating for 
compliance with Basel 
Core Principles for 

Partially achieved.  The NPLs decreased to 5.3%, but this 
improvement masked significant vulnerabilities in the banking system 
which became exposed in late 2008 when Mongolia felt the impact of 
the global financial crisis.  The weak credit risk management by banks 
combined with the lax supervision regime resulted in NPLs reaching 
25% in 2009, although the number has dropped to 10% by late 2010.  
The assessment of Basel Core Principles conducted during the last 
FSAP found that banking supervision is relatively well developed in 
comparison to other countries at Mongolia’s stage of transition.

Increasing information sharing among agencies and 
ensuring optimal public access and utilization of the new 
justice system services would also depend on strong 
capacity building efforts within the system and public 
information strategies and campaigns by the court and 
broader justice system.   

The new CPS should build on the foundations created by the 
LJRP and the follow-on Enhanced Justice Sector Services 
Project (EJSSP), currently under implementation.  The 
EJSSP is supporting important interventions in the 
development and implementation of comprehensive legal 
education reform (strengthening of law professors, 
development of standards of legal clinics, development of 
student handouts), and a bilingual public information 
strategy.  While the ISN did not highlight the justice sector 
as a focus area, the proposed CPS could link the ongoing 
project to the cross-cutting theme of Building Capacity to 
Manage the Crisis and Improve Governance in the Medium-
Term.  As the extractive industries grow, the need for 
individuals and the business community to understand their 
rights and how to access the justice system rises, and with it 
the need to ensure that the system can respond.

The severity of the 2008-2009 banking crisis in Mongolia 
has shown that strengthening of the financial sector remains 
a critical part of the development agenda.  The main lesson 
emerging from the Bank’s engagement in the financial 
sector is that the AAA and TA tools are not sufficient for 
dealing with deep-seated and politically sensitive issues.  
While diagnostic work and TA are important, they need to 
be complemented by policy-based lending that would 
support implementation of lasting reforms in the sector.  It 
is important that the new CPS gives adequate attention to 
the dual objectives of improving the scope and cost of

Intermediate indicators: 

Implementation of updated

strengthened legal and 
regulatory framework as 
specified in the PRSC 
policy matrix, adoption of 
AML/CFT Law 

Achieved.  The Insurance Law was revised in 2004 and enabled the 
development and selling of index based insurance.  The Bank is now 
working with the Government on a separate index based livestock 
insurance law (currently in draft).  The Law on Financial Leasing was 
enacted in 2006, making leasing activities much more attractive for 
investors, both foreign and domestic.  Mongolia also amended its tax 
legislation to create favorable tax treatment for leasing and encourage 
investment in fixed assets. 

Separate strategies were developed in 2006-2007 for the banking sector 
and non-bank financial institutions, but the implementation got side-
tracked in 2008 due to the severe banking crisis.  The PRSC operations 
did not take place, but substantial improvements in legal and regulatory 
framework were made during the crisis period.  In 2006, Mongolia 
passed an AML/CFT law (Law on Combating Money Laundering and 
Terrorist Financing) and established a Financial Intelligence Unit.  
Since then, Mongolia has made significant progress on the AML/CFT 
agenda, including amending the criminal code, strengthening the 
supervision of banks and further building the capacity of the FIU.

quasi-fiscal activities from 
1% of GDP in 2003 

Rebalanced tariffs recover 
full cost of providing 
electricity, but maintain 
access for poor and rural 
groups 

Ulaanbaatar electricity 
distribution losses is 
reduced from 34%  in 2003 
to less than 20 % by 2007 

Not achieved.  Despite periodic write-offs and decisions to reduce 
interest rates of sovereign guaranteed loans, the inter-company arrears 
keep increasing.  As of the end of 2010, inter-company arrears between 
energy companies were still high (receivables Tg 25.3b and liabilities 
of Tg 29.3b).  The receivables and liabilities in energy sector stand at 2 
- 2.4% of GDP in 2010.  Various reasons, including low tariffs, which 
do not allow companies to fully recover operational expenses, 
imperfect power market structure and financial structure, and 
incomplete energy sector restructuring contribute to increasing arrears.  

Not achieved.  After several price adjustments since 2007, the retail 
tariffs for electricity has reached US 6 cents per kWh.   

Partially achieved.  Ulaanbaatar electricity distribution losses were 
reduced from 34% in 2003 to about 21% in 2010.  Energy Project PIU 
and Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network (UBEDN) estimated 
that additional revenues of about Tg 7b were collected due to reduced 
losses and increased collections.  The UBEDN could not meet the 
target fully because the influx of migrants from rural areas is 
continuing and there are still areas with high non-commercial losses.  

Public-Private partnerships 
in place (including 
financing arrangements) to 
implement sector

Bank program to emphasize Development Policy Credits (DPC), the 
priorities have shifted from long-term to short-term activities (e.g., 
covering budget deficit).

With the implementation of REAP, the Government’s 
“100,000 solar ger” program will be completed by the end 
of 2011.  There are still about 60,000 households in rural 
areas without any electricity access.  More analysis of key 
constraints and options for improving access is needed.  It 
will be important to further promote the policy dialogue on 
renewable energy and the regulatory framework.  ESW on 
infrastructure and financial performance (including tariffs) 
of the sectors could further promote the policy dialogue and 
the strengthening of regulatory capacity in energy and other 
infrastructure sectors.  The Bank should continue to support 
these areas with other donors (e.g., USAID).  Mongolia is 
entering a crucial stage where the mining sector will drive 
rapid economic development and significant financial 
resources are needed to support mining infrastructure.  
Within the Mongolia Mining Infrastructure Investment 
Support Project (to be effective) more pre-investment as 
well as feasibility studies for electricity generation can be 
undertaken.  

Donor coordination within the Ulaanbaatar Clean Air 
Program (UB CAP) has proven to be very effective resulting 
in the mobilization of substantial funding and the Bank 
should scale up this approach.

platform for coordination of donor activities for air pollution reduction 
in Ulaanbaatar.  Major donors included ADB, Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA), JICA, EBRD and GIZ.  

Account receivables for Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution network 
has reached 42 days.  

The Energy Regulatory Authority (ERA) introduced lifeline tariffs for 
low-income people.  

There are several PPP projects, such as Power Plant #5 and Tavantolgoi 
power plant.  Though the Bank and IFC offered due diligence and 
transaction advice for Power Plant #5 in Ulaanbaatar in 2008, the client 
(at that time the Ministry of Fuel and Energy) did not take the advice.   

No activities were planned or undertaken during the CAS period.  
Within the REAP, there will be surveys on the current status of 
electrification in rural areas, which will be implemented during summer 
2011.

A more robust prioritization process should be instituted 
with greater consideration on economic rates of return when 
considering new road investments .  Mongolia’s road 
engineering standards and materials requirements, 
especially for pavement, are dated and in some cases 
inadequate to accommodate the country’s harsh climatic 
conditions.  Adequate supervision and testing of materials 
during construction is essential.  One permanent road lab 
and several basic mobile road labs are not sufficient.  
Consideration should be given to creating additional mobile 
road labs and stationing them on-site during large road 
works projects, or to establishing small road labs in key 
Aimag centers to alleviate the burden on the existing road 
lab and ensure better coverage.  Enhanced supervision of 
works during construction would encourage the use of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outside of the mining sector is largely political.  There is a focus on 
new construction, rather than maintaining existing road assets (90 
percent of budgets go to new construction).  It is estimated that more 
than 3,000 km of roads require reconstruction, and this large backlog of 
rehabilitation and maintenance should have priority over the 
construction of new roads. 

Partially achieved.  The Road Supervision and Research Center 
(RSRC) regularly carries out traffic counts and roughness 
measurements and maintains the information in a database (both paper 
and electronic versions).  However, the information is not unified using 
a common software.  Traffic counts are taken every three months, but 
the entire spectrum of measurements is only done every three years for 
existing roads, and every five years for new roads.  While input from 
traffic counts and roughness measurements are considered when 
preparing annual road maintenance plans, the approach is not 
systematic based on need so much as it is based on condition surveys, 
including visual surveys, which are typically carried out at the request 
of MRTT.  In addition, each Aimag receives a percentage of available 
maintenance funds based on the length of paved roads in their 
jurisdiction.

The MRTCUD regularly provides three-year plans and updates them 
periodically. 

There is a system for road maintenance in place.  The RSRC regularly 
carries out traffic counts (quarterly) and road roughness measurements 
(annually).  A lack of control on overloading contributes to the poor 
quality of roads throughout the country.  Although the Road Act 
allowed for limits to be established, they are rarely enforced, and there 
is little consideration given to the size, weight and loads imposed by 
vehicles on the road network. 
Achieved. The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) was 
established and operationalized to promote the expansion of access to 
ICT services in rural and underserved areas and the financing of USOF 
was secured by a law requiring all licensed telecommunications 
operators to contribute 2% of their taxable income to the fund.

(number of households with

Moreover, competition in the sector increased significantly (two 
additional private mobile operators were licensed) and the transparency 
and predictability of the regulatory process were improved (a 
regulatory public consultation process was established in 2007; the 
share of spectrum applications approved and assigned within 15 
working days increased from 50% in 2005 to 75% in 2009; the share of 
regulatory decisions published increased from 58% in 2005 to 100% in 
2009) resulting in sustained investments in the sector (US$37.6m in 
2005, US$93.2m in 2007, US$63.6m in 2008, and US$46.9m in 2009).

Achieved.  The World Bank supported the development and 
implementation of the Government’s Universal Access Strategy and 
Policy, which included the establishment of USOF to provide subsidies 
for the expansion of ICT services into rural areas.  The share of 
households with access to a telephone increased beyond forecasts and 
is significantly higher than 30%.  There are over 1.9 million telephony 
subscribers with about 600,000 household covered. 

Commission was a major success factor.  Furthermore, 
skills transfer and ownership of the program by the 
Government were critical, and consultations with operators 
and stakeholders helped to bring them on board. 

The Government and ICT operators have expressed to the 
World Bank their appreciation for its support to this 
program and have asked it to consider continuing its support 
for this initiative.  Next steps would be to assist initiatives to 
improve the quality and reach of the mobile network 
infrastructure, and to extend the broadband services to more 
soum centers. 

Going forward, The Bank should engage with the 
Government on a new ICT and economic growth agenda 
that includes broadband access, content and applications 
relevant to Mongolia, building new economy skills for the 
young population, developing a private sector led IT/ IT 
enabled services industry in niche segments/markets, and 
using broadband/mobile phones for the delivery of public 
services especially in rural areas. 

Increased private sector 
participation in the 
provision of ICT 
infrastructure and services 
with over 85% of ICT 
services provided by 
private sector 

Achieved.  The sector is dominated by privately owned companies.  
Two additional private mobile operators were licensed resulting in four 
private mobile operators competing in the mobile sector.  The fixed line 
operator (MTC) is 40% privately owned (54% owned by the 
Government) but its market share is small and declining.  The fully 
Government owned ICNC is a wholesale operator providing services to 
the other operators.. 

Intermediate indicators: 

IT law approved that 
provides for favorable legal 
framework for IT sector; 
government strategy for its 
use of ICT developed. 

No new ICT law was approved but there were several amendments to 
the existing law and a package of ICT laws has been submitted to the 
Parliament recently.  Overall, the legal framework is fairly favorable.  
The E-Mongolia National Program originally approved in 2005 was 
updated in 2009. 

Telephony tariffs and interconnection rates have been restructured and, 
overall, the cost dropped significantly for users.  The target for the local 
call tariff lost relevance due to technological developments in the 
sector.

social transfers as a share of GDP have been increasing over the 
reporting period.  Universal cash transfers from the Human 
Development Fund (HDF) during 2010 (and planned for 2011) have 
been the key reason behind rising fiscal costs of social transfers 
recently.  With respect to the pension system, the Bank’s recent 
estimates indicate that holding replacement rates, retirement ages and 
contribution rates constant, the fiscal costs of the pension system will 
substantially increase over time.  Significant policy changes would be 
needed to ensure that fiscal costs are sustainable over time. 

Not achieved.  The pension agenda has seen little progress over the 
reporting period.  However, in 2010 the Government expressed 
renewed interest in the Bank’s support (technical assistance) in various 
areas of pension system reforms.  It was agreed that moving forward, 
the Bank’s pension team will provide policy advice to the Government 
on: (i) formulation of a Pensions Law revising existing parameters 
including initiation of a process of modeling baseline projections and 
reform options for the current social security scheme; (ii) design of a 
savings program for the herders and informal sector; (iii) potential 
expansion and restructuring of the old age income assistance program; 
and (iv) determination of the objectives in the potential establishment 
of a social security reserve fund.  However, these recommendations 
have not been reflected in the policy changes yet.   

Not achieved.  Addressing the existing gap between pre-1960 and post-
1960 cohorts would require changes to the pension system.  No 
changes have taken place yet.  

Not observable. The existing information indicates that SSIGO 
accounts are well maintained.  However, no rigorous assessment of this 
was conducted.  

Not achieved. Social assistance programs have not been changed in 
any significant way, and the Poverty-Targeted Benefit (PTB) has not 
been introduced.  Hence, the targeting performance remains unchanged.

improving efficient financing norms still has room for improvement.  
Higher education institutions are being consolidated to improve quality 
and efficiency.  This reform is still underway.   

Partially achieved.  Accreditation is being improved, but this may not 
necessarily be reflected in the number of institutions accredited because 
institutions are being consolidated or merged. 

Partially achieved.  The Education Evaluation Center which has been 
responsible for handling university entrance examinations and student 
assessment has undergone a leadership change.  Its capacity can benefit 
from further strengthening.  The international assessment exercise in 
the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and 
Progress in International Literacy Study (PIRLS), in which Mongolia’s 
participation was financed by an EPDF grant, has been terminated by a 
ministerial decision.  The survey was not conducted and the unused 
funds will be returned.  

Mongolia’s public spending on education has been equitable and pro -
poor as a very large share goes to basic education, and higher education 
is financed in large part by private expenditures.  The State Training 
Fund provides financial assistance to tertiary education students.  
However, it could be further improved to ensure better targeting and 
thereby help ensure access to more disadvantaged students.  

An accreditation system is already in place and has begun the process.  
Its mandate goes beyond higher education and covers technical and 
vocational education and training as well.  However, it can be further 
strengthened. 

M&E has been improved.  However, due to personnel changes, it is 
unclear whether the improvement has been institutionalized .

sizes and overgrazing.  The mid-term review of the project 
concluded that: “Ultimately, despite the positive impacts of 
project activities, these have been ineffective in the face of 
the prevailing incentive structure and market failure which 
encourage herders to overstock and degrade pasture 
resources.”  Under SLP2, there is increasing focus on some 
of the prevailing incentive issues in a common access 
scenario.  Options are being explored to pilot, for example, 
pasture user fees.  This remains a critical area for 
engagement for the Bank, working closely with other 
partners (e.g., Switzerland, UNDP).

are meaningless. 

Achieved.  By 2008, 14% of herders in the three pilot aimags bought 
insurance.  

Not achieved.  Formal policy measures were not formulated , though 
analytical work was conducted with respect to post dzud assistance for 
herders (see outcome indicator below). 

The activities under the Pastoral Risk Management Component of 
SLP1 were all completed, and herders in the pilot aimags were taking 
more actions to prepare better for winter and mitigate risk.  However, a

Sources of Growth 
(FY07) 

The improvement in access to rural financial services has 
been quite dramatic, aided by the emergence of strong 
micro-finance institutions.  As the recent financial crisis 
showed, however, the system is not robust, and more could 
be done.  Specific areas for potential engagements include 
developing community based financial institutions (to 
provide competition to banks, and also to serve the un -
bankable) and increased consumer education. 

Policy interventions 
identified to intensify and 
diversify livestock 
production and marketing 
systems 

Achieved.  Several analytical pieces have been completed which have 
examined these issues (Livestock Sector Study; Mongolia Country 
Economic Memorandum).  The Bank can take some credit for 
influencing the National Livestock Program, endorsed by Parliament in 
2010, which takes forward the policy agenda for livestock 
intensification.  

10% of target beneficiaries 
in selected aimags have 
access to microfinance 
services by 2007 

Improved targeting of 
community-level 
infrastructure projects -- 
75% of target community 
members satisfied with 
procedure for identification, 
selection, and 
implementation  

Achieved.  The SLP1 ICR noted that about 15% of target population 
were sub-borrowers from the Microfinance Development Fund (MDF). 

Achieved.  This indicator has been difficult to track, not least because 
it tries to capture too much in one figure.  The SLP1 ICR was 
inconclusive: “Actual numeric value for this indicator is not available.  
High satisfaction rates are provided by different studies for different 
procedures”.  No specific survey was carried out to assess the Local 
Initiatives Fund (LIF) process from a range of community perspectives.  
Monconsult (2006): 37% of respondents felt that selection processes 
were transparent, open and fair; 72% of community members ranked 
Household Livelihoods Support Councils’ (HLSC) performance as 
average to excellent; 50% noted a slight or major change in community 
participation, initiatives, and sense of self-responsibility.  Community 
scorecards in Household Livelihoods Support Program Office 
(HLSPO) indicate a 93% satisfaction rate.  This indicator is also 
tracked in SLP2 with an improved system compared to SLP1.  The 
October 2010 mission found that satisfaction with the mechanism was 
88% and satisfaction with outcomes was 77%.

A key lesson is the need for counterparts to take ownership 
in developing and implementing proposed reforms.  
Although implementation might take longer and require 
more oversight and guidance, there is far greater potential 
for reforms to be sustained.

Outcome 14: 
Strengthened institutional 
capacity for management 
of environment and 
natural resources 

Outcome indicators: 

Implementation of road 
map to strengthen 
legislative and institutional 
framework to improve 
management of 
environment and natural 
resources, with priority on 
mining and forestry 

Environmental 
expenditures aligned with 
environmental priorities  

Achieved.  Under NEMO2, support continues to be provided to 
improve environmental laws and standards to manage the country’s 
natural resources by: (i) developing drafts to eliminate discrepancies 
and duplications in laws relating to industry; (ii) renewing the laws and 
regulations (rules, regulations, methods) on EIAs, and increasing the 
accountability of IA (e.g., ecological agreements); and (iii) supporting 
advocacy activities to help the passage of the drafts through Parliament.   
The FAO provides on-going support to newly established forestry 
brigades.  Under NEMO2, the Ministry of Nature, Environment and 
Tourism (MNET) is building upon FAO’s activities by developing 
detailed training plans and implementing a professional and methodical 
program of training sessions for a number (up to 10) of inter-soum 
forest units.  The intent is to improve awareness and strengthen the 
understanding of the roles of the local units to better manage forests 
under their jurisdictions.  Support is also being provided for two local 
environment and tourism departments at Dalanzadgad and Khovd 
aimags to improve how they function and how they carry out their 
duties and responsibilities.  

Partially achieved.  Beginning in 2008, the MNET introduced 
program- based budgeting.  The Bank is helping to improve this 
scheme through its AAA products such as the 2009 Study to Review 
Environmental Expenditures.  Currently, work is ongoing to improve 
inter-sectoral coordination in environmental policy, as well as 
collecting information on spending by the private sector to comply with 
environmental guidelines. 

Improved public 
participation in EIA and 
access to data and 
information on environment 
and natural resources 
management 

Achieved.  The MNET has revised its law on EIAs and will submit it 
to Parliament for ratification during the 2011 spring session.  The Bank 
also assisted in establishing an EIA database with some 2,500 records 
which are publicly available on the internet (http://geodata.mne-
ngic.mn/eia).  The Guidelines for Conducting EIAs were revised in 
2010 through a Decree issued by the MNET minister.

The MNET conducted a review of environmental laws and regulations 
in 2010 in an effort to identify needed revisions and amendments to 
eliminate potential contradictions among different environmental laws.  
During the review process, MNET identified a number of key changes.  
Also, Mongolia has strengthened important policy documents 
governing natural resources, including the National Water Program 
(2010), National Plan for Combating Desertification, and National 
Action Plan on Climate Change and Adaptation. 

System not developed. 

The proposed revised Law on EIAs has two important aspects: (i) 
public consultation when EIAs are prepared; and (ii) public access to 
information and the detailed EIAs.  The draft law will be submitted to 
Parliament during its 2011 spring session. 
Achieved.  Under SLP2, the Bank supports pasture/range management 
and the development of community-based approaches which have been 
piloted and scaled up.  Under the dropped Forestry Project, it was 
planned to support community based forest management, though 
ultimately this was not supported by the Ministry of Finance. 

The guidelines for pasture management planning and implementation 
were developed under SLP1 and the implementation is now supported 
under SLP2.  The guidelines are government policy, under the 
supervision of the Land Agency. 

69 

These outcomes were directly supported under SLP2.
