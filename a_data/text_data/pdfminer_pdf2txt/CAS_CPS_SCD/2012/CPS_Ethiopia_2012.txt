Executive Summary 

i. 

Since the early 1990s Ethiopia has pursued a “developmental state” model with a strong 
role for the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) in many aspects of the economy. This 
approach, based on high levels of public investment, has been associated with strong 
economic growth and delivered notable progress towards the attainment of many Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). During 2004-11 Ethiopia experienced strong and generally 
broad-based real economic growth averaging around 10.6 percent a year; industry and the 
service sector grew on average 10 percent a year, and foreign direct investment increased 
from US$0.5 billion in 2007 to US$1.2 billion in 2011. The growth of goods and services 
exports reached close to 10 percent annually during 2000-10, and Ethiopia made good 
progress in diversifying processed exports. Significant improvements have been made in 
access to and, to a lesser extent, the quality of infrastructure. The average distance to an all-
weather road decreased to 3.5 hours in 2011 from 4.5 hours in 2007. By 2010, the proportion 
of the rural population with access to potable water had risen to 65.8 percent, from 46 percent 
in 2006, with about five percent of Ethiopia’s population gaining access to improved water 
every year. By 2011, 41 percent of rural towns and villages were connected to the grid and 
the number of consumers connected grew from 800,000, in 2005, to more than 2 million in 
2011. Going forward, the hydropower sector holds great promise for Ethiopia as a source of 
investments and closer regional integration. 

ii. There has been similar progress on poverty, human development and capacity. Poverty 
in both urban and rural areas has been reduced substantially from 39 percent of Ethiopians 
living below the national poverty line (US$0.6 per day) in 2004/05, to less than 30 percent 
six years later. Ethiopia is on track to achieve MDGs related to gender parity in primary 
education, child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. Good progress has been made in 
increasing access to primary education (currently 85 percent coverage), but it may not be 
enough to reach the MDG on universal primary education. Limited progress has been made 
in reducing maternal mortality, which remains 676 per 100,000 live births. Finally, during 
the past decade Ethiopia has made impressive progress in decentralizing authority and 
service delivery. Capacity and institution building efforts at decentralized levels have 
contributed to improved access to basic services and to more effective decision-making 
bodies. There have been a series of modernization efforts across the public service, including 
Public Financial Management reforms. The legislative and regulatory framework for the 
business environment has undergone significant strengthening although more remains to be 
done. 

iii. Notwithstanding these positive developments, important challenges have emerged 
during the last few years that may require GoE to adjust some of its policies.  Enabling 
the country to move to a higher growth trajectory may require attention to several challenges, 
including: ensuring macroeconomic stability; addressing the persistently high numbers of the 
poor and food-insecure; the lagging quality of social services; and the weak capacity of the 
public sector. 

iv. With the recent death of the Prime Minister, GoE needs to ensure a smooth transition 
in coming months. GoE has embarked on a constitutional process of transition, has 

i 

 
 
 
 
confirmed that government continues to work as usual, and has expressed confidence that the 
existing public institutions will continue to function normally. GoE has also confirmed its 
commitment to the vision and goals stated in the GTP, which remains the centerpiece of the 
country's development strategy. 

v. The development model adopted by GoE relies heavily on high levels of largely 
government-led investments (like the Asian model of development), but faces low saving 
rates and limited availability of domestic resources (unlike the Asian model). Given the 
high investment requirements of the GTP, public investments, which in past years have been 
one of the major drivers of economic growth in Ethiopia, will not be sufficient to maintain 
high growth performance going forward. While private sector participation in industry and 
services could greatly contribute to the Government’s export-led job creation agenda, 
significantly leverage public sector financing and foster technology and knowledge transfer, 
realizing this potential will require enhancing opportunities for domestic and foreign private 
sector participation. There are also serious concerns that bouts of high inflation may reverse 
some of these positive poverty trends and, while inflation is currently showing a decreasing 
trend, keeping it down will be a major challenge for monetary policy.   

vi. Despite double-digit economic growth and substantial decreases in the percentage of the 
population below the national poverty line, the absolute number of poor is almost the same as 
15 years ago and a significant proportion of the population remains just above the poverty 
line and vulnerable to shocks.  Similarly the number of people living under the food poverty 
line has increased and dependence on appeals for emergency relief remains persistently high. 
Further, although access to basic social services and infrastructure has considerably 
improved, the quality of those services has not kept pace. Delivering quality would require 
continued efforts to deepen the implementation of decentralization and to build the capacity 
of the public service, both its institutions and its human resource.  Finally, continuing efforts 
to promote an open and transparent environment, through, inter alia, creating more space for 
active engagement of non-government actors, facilitating increased participation of all 
citizens in decision making process at all levels of the government, and strengthening of 
fiduciary systems and oversight institutions, are important elements in transforming the 
Ethiopian economy and society and achieving middle-income status by 2020-23.  

vii. The vision of the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2009/10-2014/15) is for 
Ethiopia to “extricate itself from poverty to reach the level of a middle-income economy 
as of 2020-23.” This is to be achieved through strong economic growth within a stable 
macroeconomic framework with agriculture and industry as the main drivers; provision of 
quality infrastructure and social services (particularly health and education); and good 
governance and democratization. There is a large measure of overlap between these priorities 
and the challenges Ethiopia faces (paragraph iii above). Development partners have therefore 
broadly endorsed the GTP as an appropriate, and GoE-owned, agenda for the coming years. 

viii. To succeed in meeting the GTP goals and sustaining high economic growth, a structural 
transformation will need to take place. It would cover the following four dimensions: 

ii 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Increased productivity and competitiveness of the industrial and services sectors for rapid 
and sustained job creation; 
 Transformation to modern and productive agriculture; 
 Strengthened systems to better respond to shocks and increase resilience; and, 
 
Improved government effectiveness. 

ix. These objectives need to be pursued concurrently, as strong synergies exist between 
them. New and diverse job opportunities in urban, peri-urban and rural areas could draw the 
unemployed and underemployed population (mostly youth) from overpopulated rural settings 
to where their skills can be utilized more productively. Complementary efforts (e.g., 
provision of key public infrastructure, stable regulatory framework, private sector 
engagement, leveraging mobile technologies to enhance the productivity of farmers and 
businesses) would be needed to diversify livelihoods and to catalyze a structural 
transformation from subsistence agriculture into a more modern and productive agriculture. 
Improving the effectiveness of GoE support would also be critical so that it can effectively 
and efficiently promote the transformation process through direct and indirect interventions. 
GoE also has a key role to play in providing basic social services (e.g., health and education), 
which would underpin people’s ability to respond positively to new opportunities. Broad-
based economic growth in all sectors of the economy will, in the long term, be the key driver 
for sustainable reduction in vulnerability and increased resilience, however, there is also a 
need for a comprehensive social protection system that allows GoE to manage risks, respond 
to disasters and provide social transfers to the chronically poor. 

x. This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY13-16) builds on the progress achieved by 
Ethiopia during the past five years and aims to help the Government of Ethiopia 
address this structural transformation and assist in the implementation of Ethiopia’s 
GTP. It also builds on the findings of the Completion Report on the last Country Assistance 
Strategy, the Country Portfolio Performance Review, and consultations with a wide range of 
Ethiopian stakeholders. The CPS is results-based, well aligned with the World Bank Strategy 
for Africa and selective, based on WBG’s comparative advantage. The CPS framework 
includes two pillars with governance as foundation and two cross cutting themes. Pillar One, 
“Fostering competitiveness and employment”, aims to support Ethiopia in achieving the 
following strategic objectives: (i) a stable macroeconomic environment; (ii) increased 
competitiveness and productivity; (iii) increased and improved delivery of infrastructure; and 
(iv) enhanced regional integration.  Pillar Two, “Enhancing resilience and reducing 
vulnerabilities”, aims to support Ethiopia in improving the delivery of social services and 
developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk management. Good 
governance and state building form the foundation of the CPS. In line with the GTP, gender 
and climate change have been included as cross-cutting issues in the CPS to strengthen their 
mainstreaming across the portfolio. The programs of IFC and MIGA are well aligned with 
the CPS framework, contributing mainly to the strategic objectives under Pillar 1. 

xi. WBG engagement, provided as a combination of partnerships, knowledge and finance, 
will be driven by the principle of partnering with GoE to look for pragmatic solutions. 
The CPS builds on what has been achieved so far and continues its support in areas where 
there is strong government ownership (e.g., infrastructure and social protection). In order to 

iii 

 
 
 
 
for the WBG to more effectively support GoE’s medium to long term development agenda , 
there are three elements in the CPS that are new. First, the WBG will seek stronger 
engagement with the Government on macroeconomic issues, the job creation agenda, and 
improving Government capacity to deliver results. Second, in addition to strengthening 
already good collaboration with existing development partners, WBG will endeavor to reach 
out to non-traditional partners. Third, WBG will deploy to a larger extent than previously its 
analytical work and look to provide budget support (most likely starting with sectoral 
development policy lending) to deepen policy dialogue, foster the use of country systems and 
increase the predictability of Bank support. 

xii. This CPS sets out a proposed IDA program, which will span the last two years of IDA 16 
(FY13-14) and the first two years of the expected 17th replenishment of IDA (FY15-16). In 
FY12 IDA’s new commitments to Ethiopia amounted to US$1.12 billion. The lending 
program for the first two years of the CPS (FY13-14) has been designed with a buffer of 
about 19 percent (US$1.5bn in FY13 and US$1.2bn in FY14) to allow for possible delays on 
individual operations. A specific IDA allocation for the two outer years of the CPS (FY15-
16) is not available, since it will depend on the outcome of IDA 17 negotiations and 
Ethiopia’s progress on CPIA indicators. The CPS program is therefore indicative and will 
have to be reconfirmed based on Ethiopia’s allocation under IDA 17, and discussions with 
the Government. 

xiii. Ethiopia faces a range of external and internal risks, the potential impacts of some of 
which can be mitigated in part by WBG. Among the key risks identified is the possibility 
of external economic shocks, including the negative impact from a protracted slowdown in 
the EU and other high income economies, as well as natural disasters, of which droughts 
have been the most frequent occurrence in Ethiopia. There is a potential trade-off between 
economic growth and overall debt sustainability, especially for a development model which 
relies on large public investment in an environment of low levels of domestic savings. For a 
number of years Ethiopia has been perceived as having a culture that inhibited corruption, 
however, there is a risk that perception will be undermined by the challenges from rapid 
economic growth coupled with significant government intervention in the management of the 
economy. There is a continuous challenge related to the capacity to deliver results and the 
probity of the public service, which may not be able to keep pace with the broader reform 
agenda. High turn-over within the public service and the expansion of the number of woredas 
will exacerbate this challenge. Among the risks of which WBG needs to be aware, but the 
mitigation of which depends on close coordination with development partners in Ethiopia, 
are the regional security risks linked to relations with Eritrea, ongoing tensions between 
Sudan and South Sudan, and instability fed by Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia. There is 
also a risk associated with the death of the Prime Minster and ensuring a smooth transition in 
the coming months as described in paragraph iv above. Finally, in the longer term there is 
also a risk associated with the next elections scheduled for 2015.

Introduction 

1. 
The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia originally covering 
FY2008-11 was discussed by the Board of Directors on April 29, 2008 (Report No. 43051-ET). 
In 2010, at the time of the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR, Report No. 55931-ET), that CAS was 
extended by one year, to include FY12, due to slower than expected implementation of CAS 
activities as well as to allow more time to undertake a necessary poverty diagnostic. While some 
adjustments to the lending program were made by the CAS PR, mainly to help mitigate the risks 
related to the global food, fuel and financial crises, the key objectives of the CAS were retained. 

2. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds on the progress achieved by Ethiopia 
during the past five years. It also aims to help the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) address 
ongoing challenges and assist in the implementation of Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation 
Plan (GTP, 2010-15). It covers the period from FY2013 to FY2016, one year beyond the GTP’s 
implementation timeframe.  As with the previous CAS it is a result-based strategy firmly 
anchored in the Government’s program as well as the World Bank Strategy for Africa.1 

3. 
This paper is organized into four chapters. Chapter I provides a brief political and 
economic context followed by a summary of achievements in key areas of economic and human 
development over the past decade. Chapter II presents the ongoing challenges faced by Ethiopia 
and the approach the Government is taking, as outlined in the GTP, to address them in the 
coming years. Chapter III and IV focus on the World Bank Group (WBG) role in Ethiopia 
starting with a review of the past WBG assistance followed by a description of the key areas of 
the new partnership, its implementation and risks. Appendices and annexes provide additional 
information and statistics. 

I. Country Context and Recent Developments 

A. 

Political Context 

4. 
Ethiopia is a large, diverse and complex country with political dynamics resulting 
from its unique history.  Up to 1991, the country had seen a century of increasing state 
centralization, underpinned by a political culture reflecting strong hierarchies and social 
stratification that have deep social roots. The current government, led by the Ethiopian People’s 
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), came to power in 1991 after almost two decades of 
armed struggle, overthrowing the repressive military Dergue regime.  EPRDF introduced three 
key reform processes: federal decentralization of the previously socialist state; market 
liberalization of a command economy; and democratization under a multi-party constitution. 
Each of these reform processes has progressed to different degrees and enjoyed some notable 
successes, but also faced significant constraints. 

5. 
A phased approach to federal decentralization has been pursued since 1995. While

more towards the deconcentration of responsibility: dominance of the EPRDF and its allies 
continuing to administer all levels of government seems to underpin strong de facto national 
uniformity.  EPRDF’s dominance has allowed it to establish a strongly interventionist 
“developmental state” system, which is often perceived as limiting the space and role of non-
government social, political and economic actors in economic growth, promotion of liberal 
democracy and pluralism. These include non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil 
society organizations (CSOs), whose role is limited largely to service delivery under recent 
legislation; private media outlets, whose activities are also regulated by strict legislation and a 
tough judicial approach to editorial freedom; and private sector investors, who also often feel 
their interests are neglected by a government determined to curb what it sees as anti-development 
“rent-seeking”. Weak opposition groups have struggled for space in this context, with Ethiopia’s 
most competitive elections to date concluding in 2005 in bitter post-election contestation and 
violence, followed by the reconsolidation of the position of EPRDF. The May 2010 
parliamentary elections resulted in a 99.6 percent victory for the ruling EPRDF and its allies, 
reducing the opposition from 174 to only two seats in the 547 member lower house. This 
weakening of the opposition and marginal role that other non-state actors are playing has created 
a polarized dialogue on many key political and economic issues outside Ethiopia, as well as 
within.2 

6. 
Ethiopia occupies a difficult position in the Horn of Africa sandwiched between war-
torn Somalia, Eritrea, and the newly divided Sudan and South Sudan. All of these neighbors 
generate difficult cross-border problems, often involving cross-border communities. Ethiopia’s 
lowland peripheries have long been affected by instability, and its relatively strong state, security 
and military systems are regularly deployed domestically - and sometimes also regionally - to 
promote GoE interests in national stability and security. However, Ethiopia’s central and 
important strategic position in the Horn of Africa also offers important potential for regional 
cooperation and collaboration (especially in the water and energy sectors), which could 
contribute to a growing inter-dependence between the countries and lead to promote peace and 
stability in the region. 

7. 
Ato Meles Zenawi, the Prime Minister who had led Ethiopia since 1991, died in late 
August 2012. Since his death, GoE has embarked on a constitutional process for the transition to 
a new Government. The incoming Prime Minister and the Government have reconfirmed their 
commitment to political stability, to hold national elections in 2015 (as previously planned), and 
to continued implementation of the GTP and other key GoE strategies and policies.

Recent Economic Developments 

8. 
Since the early 1990s Ethiopia has pursued a “developmental state” model with a 
strong role for GoE in many aspects of the economy. This approach, based on high levels of 
public sector investment, has been associated with strong rates of broad-based economic growth 
since 2001, albeit from a very low base and, since 2010, a particularly ambitious program for 

2 The most visible examples of this polarized dialogue include the often critical position taken by parts of the 
Ethiopian Diaspora, and the high profile some international NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch and the Committee 
to Protect Journalists give to publicizing their concerns about governance in Ethiopia.

state, infrastructure, and economic transformation. Notable progress has been made towards 
many MDGs including those for poverty, access to education and health. Important 
improvements have been made in basic infrastructure, and in strengthening executive capacity, 
and Ethiopia presents a relatively positive picture, particularly at the federal level. It has a track 
record of successful management of reform at the higher tiers of government, and there is clear 
evidence of a strong and consistent vision guiding policies, which are strongly pro-poor. 

Macroeconomic Trends 

9. 
From 2004-11 Ethiopia experienced strong and generally broad-based real 
economic growth of around 10.6 percent a year on average, i.e., more than double the annual 
average of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which reached 5.2 percent (Figure 1). Growth 
came from a mix of GoE-led development investments, strong global commodity demand, and 
the development of new export sectors. More recently annual growth rates have declined 
slightly, but still remain at high single-digit levels. The economy is expected to stabilize at 
around 8 percent in 2012, largely owing to improved performance in the agriculture sector. The 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annual growth is likely to remain around 8 percent until 2016, 
driven by rising foreign investment and exports (EIU, 2012). In addition, despite high population 
growth of 2.2 percent a year, GDP per capita (at PPP) has increased from US$965 in 2007/08 to 
US$1,196 in 2010/11. Nonetheless, Ethiopia’s GDP per capita remains among the lowest in the 
world (169th out of 181 countries, assessed by the World Bank).3

10. 
Export growth of goods and services has been strong, averaging close to 10 percent 
annually during 2000-10. Agriculture remains a major earner of foreign exchange, accounting 
on average for about 90 percent of Ethiopia’s exports over the past decade. Ethiopia has made 
good progress in growing and diversifying processed exports, with double digit growth volumes

in export categories such as leather and leather products, and meat and meat products over recent 
years. The economy, however, remains dependent on primary products (principally coffee) to a 
larger extent than other African and Asian comparators.4 This may change in coming years, if 
Ethiopia is successful in maintaining recent growth of foreign direct investment (FDI), which 
increased from US$0.5 billion in 2007 to US$1.2 billion in 2011 (National Bank of Ethiopia - 
NBE).5 In addition, the mining and energy (hydropower) sectors hold great promise for Ethiopia 
as a source of investments and as important catalysts for the Government’s export-orientated 
development strategy. Other sectors which appear to have scope for continued export growth and 
development include floriculture, hides and leather products. 

11. 
During 2000-10 imports grew annually by around 15 percent on average due to a 
major emphasis on the import of capital goods as part of the government-led growth strategy. As 
a result, the trade balance has been in deficit. Likewise, the current account balance has been 
negative, even though it improved temporarily in 2010/11, when it recorded a small surplus 
resulting from a temporary slowing of investment activities. Yet, consumer goods imports have 
recovered since to earlier, albeit low levels. Thus, the current account is expected to turn into 
deficit again, and likely to stay there given the import requirements of the GTP and increasing 
demand for imported consumer goods.  

12. 
Ethiopia weathered the 2008 global food-fuel-financial crises relatively well. GDP 
growth declined from 11.2 percent in FY2008 to around 10 percent in FY2009, representing only 
a marginal difference between projected and actual GDP. Nonetheless, even before the onset of 
the 2008 crisis, Ethiopia’s economy was already slowing down. Looking forward, there is a 
risk of negative economic impact from a protracted slowdown in the European Union (EU) 
and other high-income economies, mainly through reduced remittances and slowing 
demand for exports. A slowdown of remittances (standing at around 9 percent of GDP) could 
reduce disposable income and ultimately decrease domestic consumption. Although Ethiopian 
exports are only around 15 percent of GDP, they may be vulnerable due to the high 
concentration of commodity and primary goods and to the 50-plus percentage share of OECD as 
export destination.  

13. 
Recent high inflation rates are a particular concern for Ethiopia and its economy. 
Inflation has a negative impact on poverty, possibly pushing poverty up by as much as 0.5 
percent for each 1 percent increase in the inflation rate (World Bank Working Paper, WP3378). 
Further, inflation negatively affects the domestic savings rate, which for the past decade (2000-
10) has been at low single-digit levels, as well as the private investment rate, both of which are 
vital to finance ambitious GTP investment targets. Headline inflation rates in Ethiopia have 
largely been driven by developments in food price inflation and partially by the increasing global 
commodity prices. Since 2005, there have been two major spikes (Figure 2). In August 2008, 

4 During 2005-09 share of manufactured exports as a share of total exports in Ethiopia was only 13 percent 
compared to China (90 percent), Cambodia (90), Bangladesh (93) and Vietnam (58). In case of light manufacturing, 
its share in total exports was 9 percent compared to China (91 percent), Cambodia (89), Bangladesh (91) and 
Vietnam (43). UNIDO, 2011 
5 Currently most FDI originates from China, India and Turkey and focuses on agriculture, textile and leather. Most 
deals are negotiated case-by-case, generally as a result of high-level bilateral official visits. Despite growth in 
private FDI, it only represented 0.6 percent of GDP in 2010 (World Bank, WDI).

headline inflation (year on year) peaked at 61.6 percent, driven by 79.2 percent food price 
inflation; likewise, in August and September 2011 inflation was 40.7 and 40.2 percent 
respectively, at a time when food inflation reached almost 50 percent. Food inflation kept rising 
to more than 50 percent in November 2011, but by then headline inflation had started to ease 
slowly, driven by a tightening monetary stance (base money growth stabilized at the end of 
2011).

14. 
Non-food inflation, a measure of core inflation, shows a relatively high persistent level, 
which indicates that inflation in Ethiopia is not purely a food price problem. In both spikes of 
2008 and 2011 non-food inflation rose above 20 percent. In the 84 months between January 2005 
and December 2011, core inflation was between 10 and 20 percent for 34 months, and above 20 
percent for 25 months. Non-food inflation likely has several drivers in Ethiopia, including: 
relatively high overall monetary growth in the system, inflation expectations (which could be 
further fuelled by food price-inflation), and currency devaluation, which increases the prices for 
imported goods. 

15. While high inflation persists, it is showing a slightly decreasing trend. Recognizing 
the difficulties that inflation poses for its economy and the poor, GoE has been executing 
stringent cash-based budgeting and negative reserve money growth. 6 As a result, headline 
inflation rates, which were above 33 percent on average during all of 2011, started to ease at the 
end of the year, and reached 20.9 percent in June 2012. However, international prices for 
Ethiopian food staples are now rising sharply, and this has in the past led to increased inflation in 
Ethiopia. 

16. 
The exchange rate has continued to steadily depreciate since September 2010, 
following the 20 percent nominal deprecation in August 2010, consistent with the long-term 

6 The trend to tighten monetary base was slightly reversed in December 2011 primarily due to a drawdown in 
government deposits at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). At the same time reserve requirement ratios were 
lowered by 5 percentage points in January 2012.

trend. Overall the Birr has depreciated by 97 percent over the course of 5 years. This trend is 
largely mirrored in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate which shows a steady path of 
depreciation between September 2008 and December 2011. The Real Effective Exchange Rate, 
however, has been on an appreciating trend since December 2010, which coincides with and 
largely originates in the recently observed high inflation rates.7

17. 
Fiscal policy needs to play a key role in GoE’s efforts to reduce inflation over the 
short run as well as mobilize and spend resources efficiently in the medium-term. While the 
current federal budget stance is tight, supported by significant increases in revenues, quasi-fiscal 
activities are growing (such as domestically and externally financed investment activities of 
state-owned enterprises). The overall general government deficit in 2010/11 was 1.6 percent of 
GDP, financed mostly by external project loans and privatization receipts almost without 
recourse to net domestic financing. Federal government data for the first half of 2011/12 
indicates that the revenue performance was improved, the overall deficit was reduced, and a 
large repayment to the banking system from GoE was recorded. The latter, however, resulted in a 
large deposit accumulation at the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) which has 
been extending credits to state-owned enterprises at a very rapid rate (IMF, 2012). Regarding the 
revenue side, implementation of the authorities’ tax reform strategy, which was started in 2010, 
is ongoing and already shows significant improvements in tax collection. On the expenditure 
side, implementation of public financial management (PFM) reforms, including the move to a 
program-based budgeting is ongoing and would need to be deepened to prepare for a possible 
increase of budget support programs of development partners. At the same time, the current tight 
fiscal policy stance needs to be maintained to support the reduction of inflation.

18. 
The latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) carried out for the 2011/12 period 
indicates that Ethiopia remains at low risk of external debt distress – similar to the findings 
for 2009/10 and 2010/11.8 However, given the large financing requirements of the GTP, it is 
expected that debt ratios will rise moderately in the medium-term but stabilize in the long-term. 
Analysis indicates that borrowing from domestic sources is constrained and public enterprises 
will continue to rely significantly on external financing to sustain the large infrastructure 
investments that are expected to drive growth; for the latter a growing share is expected to be on 
non-concessional terms. Consistent with GoE's intention to keep a low risk of external debt 
distress, the amount of non-concessional borrowing will be limited. Indeed there may be a trade-
off between GoE’s desire to maintain a low risk rating and the implementation pace of the GTP. 
In other words, GoE may need to increase the implementation period of the GTP in order to 
smooth the profile of the non-concessional financing requirements for the planned investments. 
Ethiopia is subject to the IDA Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP). In the absence of an 
IMF program, IDA could establish a non-concessional borrowing limit if it was consistent with 
the maintenance of low debt vulnerabilities, and if the planned investments are critical and 
growth-enhancing.9  Recently GoE officially requested a non-concessional borrowing limit of 
US$ 1 billion and the Board will be informed of IDA management’s decision as specified in the 
NCBP. 

Governance and Public Sector Management 

19. 
During the past decade Ethiopia has made 
impressive progress on the 
decentralization of authority and service delivery. A phased approach 
to federal 
decentralization has been adopted, with a transfer of powers from GoE to Regional States (1991-
95) followed by the decentralization of service delivery first to woredas (districts) and, for some 
aspects, down to kebeles (villages) (2001- ongoing). Kebele councils have been enlarged, and 
kebele managers put in place to be focal points for service delivery and to handle complaints. 
The capacity and institutions built at decentralized levels have resulted in improved access to 
basic services and to decision-making bodies.10 Serious efforts have been made at reforming the 
tax system (including policy revision, structural review, adoption of ICT and taxpayer 
education), resulting in a fivefold tax collection increase from 2005 to 2012. The legal and policy 
frameworks and operational systems of urban centers have also been reformed, and capacities 
strengthened. 

20. 
Public Financial Management reforms have made good progress over the last 
decade, although further reforms are needed. This progress was facilitated through 
strengthening of the legal framework for PFM; rolling out of simple but easy to use 
computerized systems such as IBEX (Integrated Budget and Expenditure Management System) 
across GoE and regional administrations; extensive training for PFM staff; and building of 

8 See Appendix 5 for details. 
9 The ability to establish a non-zero ceiling for non-concessional lending in IDA's NCBP in the absence of an IMF 
program was outlined in "IDA's Non-concessional Borrowing Policy: Progress Update", April, 2010.  (IDA Sec 
54240). 
10 According to the 2011 Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey, an independent survey of local governments, 
during 2005-11 percentage of jurisdictions graded as “high performers” by their constituencies has increased from 
25 to 88 percent.

capacity at institutions including the Offices of the Federal Auditor General (OFAG) and the 
eleven Regional Auditor Generals. Several important laws have been drafted including: 11 a 
Financial Reporting Law and the law establishing a regulatory body for the accountancy 
profession in Ethiopia, which mandates the establishment of the Institute of Certified 
Accountants and adoption of accounting standards as well as International Standards on 
Auditing.  Currently, a review of the 1960 commercial code is ongoing under the auspices of the 
Ministry of Justice, and supported by the World Bank. While Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (PEFA) assessments of 2007 and 2011 have noted improvements, they have also 
noted the wide variability in capacity, systems and practices that exist across the country. These 
assessments have highlighted the need to address remaining PFM weaknesses in tax collection, 
procurement, internal and external audit, structured training, legislative oversight and scrutiny as 
well as transparency (see discussion in paragraph 89). 

21. 
The implementation of fiscal decentralization is still ongoing. Although resources 
flowing through the block grant system are increasing, they are flowing to a rapidly increasing 
number of woredas, many of whom have yet to develop in full the capacity to handle and 
manage these funds. Furthermore, on average, 80 percent of these resources are used to fund 
salary costs while resources for capital expenditures are limited. Woredas have limited discretion 
on the allocation and utilization of these funds. In order to make further progress GoE needs to 
further explore mandates over revenue and expenditure within its intergovernmental transfers 
system. The affordability and sustainability of financing the large (and increasing) number of 
woredas also needs to be carefully analyzed. 

22. 
Public Sector Reform has been high on Government’s agenda, and is rooted in its 
long term strategy of state transformation articulated in the early 1990s. There have been a 
series of modernization efforts across the public service including: business process 
reengineering (BPR) implemented at all levels of government; introduction of a balanced score 
card fostering greater customer orientation and performance management in service delivery; 
improvements in transparency and of the budget process; and access to information. Nonetheless, 
there is a high level of staff turnover and churning in the public service which affects the quality 
of service delivery. Whilst this phenomenon is not fully understood a strategy for civil service 
reform, with an overhaul of GoE human resource policies, including pay scales, should be 
considered as a matter of priority by GoE going forward (see paragraph 86). 

23. 
The legislative and regulatory framework has undergone significant strengthening 
in recent years, through overhauling of old acts and enactment of  improved proclamations in 
civil service, decentralization, tax (income and turnover tax, Value Added Tax), finance (public 
finance proclamation, procurement, cash management directives), 
Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT), city proclamations and urban policies, asset registration and 
disclosure, and criminal laws as well as laws that determine the powers and responsibilities of 
the three branches of government. GoE has also embarked on efforts to increase the transparency 
and accountability of its mining-derived financial flows, which are being analyzed, discussed, 

11 Drafting of these laws was recommended by the Report on Observance and Codes - Accounting and Auditing 
conducted in 2007.

and made publicly available under the World Bank-supported Ethiopian Revenue Transparency 
Initiative. Nonetheless, Ethiopia can still do more to improve its business environment (see 
paragraph 30 and 62).  

24. 
Regarding anti-corruption measures, 
the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption 
Commission has overseen the establishment of regional commissions in all regions, with a 
network of Ethics officers in all regional bureaux. The development of investigative capacitates 
of staff at the Commissions is still a work in progress, is moving in the right direction. The 
legislature at federal level has passed a number of laws aimed at enabling an environment for 
fighting corruption. Initiatives around asset disclosure for political leaders and public officials 
(defined as “government appointees, elected persons and public officials” in the Disclosure and 
Registration of Assets Proclamation, 2010) at federal level have resulted in the recording and 
disclosure of assets in respect of over 40,000 individuals. 

Agriculture and Rural Development 

25. 
Agriculture remains the cornerstone of the Ethiopian economy and the most 
important source of growth.  It accounts for almost 48 percent of GDP and 85 percent of export 
earnings. Principal crops include coffee, maize, teff, wheat, sorghum and other cereals, pulses 
(e.g., beans), oilseeds, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. 12 From 2007/8 to 2010/11 the 
agriculture sector was reported to have grown by 6.5 percent a year on average. According to 
official statistics, agricultural productivity of wheat, teff and sorghum increased by an average of 
14 percent,13 due to investments in agricultural extension, some increases in inputs (especially 
fertilizer), improvements in land tenure security and management as well as significant increases 
in the area farmed (by over 2 percent annually). Ethiopia is also the 10th largest producer of 
livestock in the world and, with 75 million head of livestock, has the largest concentration of 
livestock on the African continent. Agriculture remains a major earner of foreign exchange, with 
coffee, oilseeds, qat, flower, pulses, live animal and hides and skins making up the bulk of 
Ethiopia’s total exports. 

26. 
Agriculture is the main income earner, livelihood and way-of-living for 85 percent 
of Ethiopians living in rural areas.14 Ethiopia’s agricultural production is by and large rain-fed 
and dominated by small-scale farmers and enterprises. While much of Ethiopia’s agriculture 
remains for subsistence purposes, smallholders also provide a large part of traded commodities, 
including for exports. Food is also the main consumption item for Ethiopian households, 
accounting for about 57 percent of the consumption basket (excluding beverages). Given the 

12 Ethiopia is Africa’s biggest coffee producer and second biggest maize producer. It is the biggest teff producer in 
the world. 
13 However some independent studies shed some doubts on the reliability of the official statistics. For instance, 
according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Food Program (WFP) Crop and Food Security 
Assessment Mission to Ethiopia (2010) “national cereal and pulse production in 2009/10 is some 4 .7 percent below 
the all time record harvest in 2008/09 but still about 7 percent above the previous five years average. Sorghum and 
maize crops have been most adversely affected, while production of teff and barley is less affected and production of 
wheat is expected to increase.” p.4. 
14 Rural population is increasing at about 2.4 percent annually (e.g., over 1.5 million people). Currently, migration to 
urban areas is much smaller than rural population growth rate.

large rural share of the total population, there is a strong correlation between recent agricultural 
growth and the significant reduction in rural poverty. In recent years, GoE has been increasingly 
interested in pursuing large commercial agriculture schemes especially in crops with export 
potential (e.g., sugar cane) and in collaboration with the private sector, both domestic and 
foreign, which brings both opportunities and challenges going forward (see paragraph 78). 

27. 
Land remains one of the main structural and regulatory challenges that Ethiopia 
faces, as a critical input into all economic activities (rural and urban). According to the Ethiopian 
Constitution, land belongs to “the State and the people of Ethiopia.” Private ownership of land is 
not allowed. Instead, private users have user rights that are different for rural and urban areas and 
vary by region; a significant amount of land is informally used. Formal land markets are 
underdeveloped and do not exist in many areas, and land is generally undervalued. Given the 
country’s strong economic growth, urban and industrial development, and larger-scale 
agricultural investments, the challenges and demand for improved land tenure security, access to 
land, land use planning and land management are further increasing.  To address these 
challenges, Ethiopia can build on strong in-country experience and focus on strengthening: (i) 
the legal and regulatory framework; (ii) the organization set-up and administrative capacity; and 
(iii) the provision of effective land administration services.15 

Industry and Services 

28. 
For the past five years (2007/08 – 2010/11), industry and the service sector have 
experienced strong average real growth of 10.2 and 10.8 percent a year respectively. 
However, while the rate of growth of industry has accelerated, partially due to increased FDI, 
services registered a recent slowdown to 6.7 percent from 11.7 percent (IMF, 2012).16 The output 
structure remains reflective of a developing economy in early transition, with agriculture 
accounting for 48 percent of GDP, industry for 14 percent, and services for 38 percent (2010). 
The manufacturing sector has been growing in value terms at similar rates as GDP but remains 
small in terms of its contribution to GDP (5.5 percent in 2011) and employment – only around 13 
percent of the employed population in urban areas is engaged in manufacturing, and the 
corresponding annual growth in employment has been a modest 4 percent during the last three 
years (CSA 2009, 2010 and 2011). 

29. 
Public investment has in recent years been one of the major drivers of economic 
growth in Ethiopia. The growth in GoE and the activities of state enterprises have multiplied. 
Credit to the public sector from the banking system has increased five-fold from 2004/05 to 
2010/11 from Birr 8 billion to an estimated 42 billion, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all 
banking system credit. 17 Despite a robust privatization program (so far more than 115 state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) have been privatized) the share of public corporations, which are 
predominantly large and medium sized SOEs, has been relatively stable (around 8.6 percent of 

15 Ethiopia: Options for Strengthening Land Administration, World Bank, 2011. 
16 There are some discrepancies between the official Government data and those of IMF. For example, real GDP 
growth in industry in 2010/11 is registered at 15 percent by GOE as opposed to IMF figure of 12.5 percent. The 
variance is much higher with regard to the growth rate in services where IMF has shown a decline of 6.7 percent 
while GOE has registered a slight increase in growth rate to 12.5 percent.

GDP). Further, several large enterprises that the Government considers strategic remain in the 
public domain resulting in limited scope for private participation and competition.18 

Figure 3: Doing Business in Ethiopia (2012) 

30. 
The domestic private sector is dominated by the 
informal sector. In services and manufacturing the 
informal sector 
is growing but continues 
to be 
characterized by low productivity. The formal private 
sector represents a small part of the economy – a recent 
study estimated that private corporations generated only 
2.7 percent of GDP and employed just 5.8 percent of the 
workforce. It is dominated by large and medium sized 
formal firms and includes mostly endowment companies 
(i.e., companies controlled by EPRDF) and FDI. One of 
the contributing factors to the small size of the formal 
private sector is the fact that, despite some positive developments in industry and service sectors, 
Ethiopia has been a difficult place to do business. In Doing Business 2012, Ethiopia ranked 111th 
out of 183 economies and 7th out of the 18 economies that make up the Common Market for 
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).19 In this regard, Ethiopia’s ranking has not improved 
significantly over the past few years and the pace of reforms is slowing down (e.g., registration 
and licensing regulations as shown in Box 1). Ethiopia’s performance is also uneven across the 
Doing Business indicators (Figure 3), with particularly slow progress in removing barriers to 
trading across the borders, which in the context of regional collaboration, presents a significant 
barrier to Ethiopia’s export-driven growth. 

 Financial Sector 

31. 
The Ethiopian banking sector is relatively underdeveloped compared with its 
regional peers and plays a limited role in the economy. The Banking system comprises one 
development bank (the Development Bank of Ethiopia – DBE), two state-owned commercial 
banks (CBE and the Construction and Business Bank) and 14 private banks. There are no 
foreign-owned banks. In 2010/11 CBE’s assets were about ETB180 billion (up from ETB53 
billion in 2004/05), which accounted for about 70 percent of the banking sector’s total assets; its 
market share in terms of credits is almost 75 percent, and in terms of deposits 65 percent. The 
remaining 15 banks are mainly private and have combined assets of ETB86 billion. In addition 
there are 30 Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs), of which the five largest MFIs (owned by 
regional Governments) represent 85 percent of 2.5 million clients and 90 percent of overall 
outstanding loans (as of September 2011). 20 Regarding the overall financial sector depth 
(measured by private sector credit/GDP) Ethiopia’s standing is comparable with Uganda and 

18 Public corporations that the GOE considers strategic include: Ethiopian Air Lines, Ethiopian Shipping Lines, 
Ethiopian Telecoms, Ethiopian Electric and Power Corporation, Ethiopian Metal Engineering Corporation, 
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Development Bank of Ethiopia, and Construction and Business Bank. 
19 These results are also corroborated by the Global Competitiveness Index. Accordingly in 2010-11 Ethiopia was 
119th (out of 139) in terms of its overall competitiveness, 127th with regard to macroeconomic environment, 105th in 
innovation, 129th in higher education and training and 121st in financial market development.  
20 According to quarterly data on MFIs collected by the Association of Ethiopian MFIs, in Q3 2011 the total capital 
of all MFIs reached Birr 2.5bn; the stock of outstanding loans was Birr 6.7bn and savings were Birr 2.1bn.

Tanzania, especially after accounting for Ethiopia’s lower income per capita. However, while 
Ethiopia’s regional peers have seen credit to the private sector as a proportion of GDP rise 
substantially over the last five years (2006-2010)21 , in Ethiopia this ratio has fallen from 18 
percent to 15 percent (NBE).

Ethiopia’s 
financial 
sector penetration and access 
to finance is still limited (Table 
2). According 
to 
the 
IMF 
Financial Access Survey, during 
2004-10 
the 
number 
of 
commercial bank branches per 
100,000 adults has grown from 
0.8 to 1.8 as well as the number 
of their depositors per 1,000 adults from 66 to 107. However, the number of outstanding deposits 
with commercial banks as a percent of GDP has declined from 38 to 28 percent. Similarly, while 
the number of borrowers from commercial banks per 1,000 adults has increased from 1.2 to 1.9, 
outstanding loans from commercial banks as a percent of GDP went down from 19 to 14 percent. 
The ability of the commercial banks to collect deposits and provide loans to the real sector is 
restricted by negative real interest rates prevailing in the economy and a recent GoE requirement 
on the commercial banks to allot 27 percent of their loan disbursements to purchase T-bills. 
While there are some encouraging trends in accessibility and use of financial services, there is 
substantial scope for the financial sector can play a more active role supporting the 
Government’s growth and transformation agenda. One of the possible areas worthwile exploring 
in Ethiopia is mobile banking, which over the past few years has substantially changed the access 
to banking services in Kenya and Tanzania, especially for the rural poor (see also paragraph 35).

Infrastructure 

33. Over the past decade, Ethiopia has made significant improvements in access to and 
quality of its infrastructure. It is estimated that if Ethiopia’s infrastructure platform could be 
improved to the level of the African leader, Mauritius, annual per capita growth rates could 
increase by 3.8 percent.22 Further, given Ethiopia is a landlocked country, connectivity with its 
neighbors and with the rest of the world brings important challenges as well as opportunities. 
Ethiopian Airlines is now one of the three main sub-Saharan African airlines and Bole Airport 
serves as a regional air transport hub for passenger and commodity transport (including cash 
crops such as floriculture). The quality of Ethiopia’s road network has increased: 80 percent of 
the paved network of over 40,000 kilometers is in good or fair condition (2010).23 Nonetheless, 
road density is still low: only 10 percent of the rural population lives within two kilometers of an 
all-weather road, which is only half of the benchmark level for low income countries in sub-

21 For example, private sector credit/GDP between 2006 and 2010 in Kenya went from 26 to 34 percent, in Uganda 
from 10 to 16 percent and in Tanzania from 13 to 16 percent (World Bank WDI, 2011).

Saharan Africa. Ethiopia’s primary transport corridor is through Djibouti and GoE has recently 
initiated construction of a 5,000 kilometer national railway to link Addis Ababa with Djibouti, 
of which the first 2,000 kilometer phase is anticipated to be developed by 2015. Ethiopia is 
actively trying to develop a rail industry to serve the broader region including South Sudan, 
Somalia (Puntland) and northern Kenya. The Government is also exploring alternative routes to 
market including Berbera and Lamu.  

34. 
Access to improved water and sanitation is rising rapidly, albeit from a very low base. 
Close to five percent of Ethiopia’s population is gaining access to improved water every year. 
Though reliance on surface water is in decline and the emphasis has shifted to multiple uses of 
ground water sources, matching drilling capacity with the demand for source development has 
been a challenge. Moreover, the assessment of groundwater potential and the management of 
groundwater resources have not been given sufficient attention. Exceptionally rapid expansion of 
traditional latrines has benefited 60 percent of Ethiopia’s population (Health and Sanitation 
Action Plan, 2012). The practice of open defecation, while still widespread, is declining steeply, 
due mainly to the government’s health extension program and partly the deployment of more 
than 34,000 health extension workers to implement a comprehensive health and sanitation 
package. GoE in collaboration with their development partners has made progress towards 
establishing a harmonized and integrated Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) 
program and is putting in place the corresponding institutional arrangement for its universal 
access plan to provide access to improved water supply for the entire population by 2015. 

35. 
The GTP has a clear vision to “embrace ICT as essential to creating new jobs, new 
business opportunities, to education and to improving the effectiveness of government 
administration and service delivery.” To improve the country’s mobile, internet and 
broadband penetration rates, GoE signed in 2011 a contract with France Telecom to manage the 
state-owned Ethiopian Telecom Company (ETC). After almost a year ETC now serves over 15 
million subscribers and expects its total mobile subscriber base to increase to 50 million at the 
end of 2015, by extending coverage from 50 to 90 percent. To increase the quality and reliability 
of service, ETC has completed steps to eliminate faulty power equipment in Addis Ababa, and is 
assessing equipment needs in regional states. In addition, it has signed an agreement with the 
Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) to facilitate the installation of optical fiber 
between Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar and Addis Ababa and Galafi. Ethiopia's fixed-line and 
internet penetration rates of 1 and 0.9 percent respectively (2011) rank among the lowest in the 
region; ETC plans to expand its internet subscriber base from the current 180,000 to five million 
by 2015.  

36. 
Since 2005 electricity access in Ethiopia has been growing rapidly. 41 percent of rural 
towns and villages are now connected to the grid and the number of consumers connected grew 
from 800,000, in 2005, to more than 2 million in 2011 (14 percent coverage). During the same 
time, off-grid programs, such as: efficient cook stoves and solar lighting, have brought access to 
modern energy services to over 4 million households. The average rate of growth of demand for 
electricity was above 15 percent a year during 2005-10,24 and EEPCO implemented demand side 
management by replacing existing incandescent lamps with CFLs. Ethiopia is endowed with vast 

24 About 25 percent in FY10 and 32 percent in FY11.

hydropower potential and could become one of the largest power exporters in Africa. In 2010, 
EEPCO commissioned three large hydro power plants 25 that increased its power generation 
capacity from about 850 MW to above 2,000 MW, providing sufficient capacity to service the 
current demand26 and allowing high-cost thermal plants to be decommissioned from the grid.  
New regional interconnectors to facilitate regional power trade are underway with Djibouti (in 
operation since 2010), Sudan (expected in 2012) and Kenya (expected in 2017). 

Climate Variability 

37. 
Ethiopia is highly vulnerable to climate change and variability. Ethiopia has become 
warmer over the past century and rainfall variability is predicted to increase further. Impacts of 
droughts and floods will be the most acute impacts on agriculture and on average cost the 
economy about one percentage point of GDP growth per year. 27  However, Ethiopia is also 
vulnerable in terms of other sectors including water, transport, industry, energy, health, and in 
terms of its environmental resources. A multifaceted approach is needed to address the 
challenges posed by climate change, including but not limited to interventions in the agriculture 
sector; better management of natural resources such as land, forestry, groundwater; and 
promotion of “green technologies” (see discussion in paragraph 79). Reducing population growth 
will also be essential in reducing the stress on natural resources and addressing environmental 
degradation.

Poverty has been reduced 
substantially during the last decade, 
in both urban and rural areas. 
According 
to Household 
Income 
Consumption 
and 
Expenditure 
Surveys (HICES), while almost 39 
percent of Ethiopians lived in extreme 
poverty in 2004/05 (below the national poverty line of US$0.6 per day), six years later the 
number was reduced to less than 30 percent (Table 3).28  While both, urban and rural areas 
experienced reduced poverty rates in this period, inequality declined in urban areas but has 
worsened in rural areas. Nevertheless, the poverty rate in Ethiopia as measured by international 
standards remains very high: 39 percent of Ethiopians live below US$1.25 a day; 78 percent of 
Ethiopians live under US$2 a day ((United Nations Development Program - UNDP); and the 
Oxford Poverty and Human Development Index calculates the poverty rate in Ethiopia to be 90 
percent, the second highest after Niger of the 104 developing countries covered.

Education 

39. 
There has been encouraging, albeit uneven, progress towards achieving the 
education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ethiopia continues to give high priority to 
the education sector by channeling significant public resources to education – in 2010/11 
education expenditures were equal to 4.6 percent of GDP or 24.9 percent of public expenditure. 
While, as a result Ethiopia is on track to achieve gender parity in primary education (MDG Goal 
3) it will likely not achieve universal primary education (MDG Goal 2).29 The primary Gender 
Parity Index (GPI) increased from 0.87 in 2006/07 to 0.94 on 2010/11. In the same time period 
increase in access to primary education was modest: the net enrollment rate (NER) increased 
from 79 to 85 percent, an annual growth rate of 1.9 percent, which was less than the population 
growth rate. Grade 8 completions increased at 2.8 percent a year, but remain low at 49.4 percent. 
The gross enrollment rate (GER) of early childhood development grew rapidly at 13.8 percent a 
year during 2006-11 though from a low base of 3.1 percent. Ethiopia has set an ambitious target 
of achieving universal general secondary education (grades 9-10) by 2025 as part of its strategy 
to become a middle-income country (MIC) by that year.30  However, progress with the expansion 
of general secondary education was slow reaching 38.4 percent coverage in 2010/11. There was 
good progress in the expansion of coverage for grades 11-12 – GER increased from 5.5 to 8.1 
percent. Higher education is rapidly expanding – the gross enrollment ratio for which has 
increased from about 1 percent in 2000 to about 5 percent in 2010, and is expected to reach over 
9 percent by 2015.31  Moving forward, more emphasis needs to be placed on addressing the 
quality of education, which is lagging behind (see paragraphs 65 and 81). 

Health and Nutrition 

40. 
Ethiopia is on track to reach the child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and malaria MDGs 
(United Nations MDG Progress Assessment). The latest data report that between 1997/01 and 
2007/11 Ethiopia experienced a rapid decrease in child mortality rates: neonatal mortality 
declined more than 30 percent (to 37 deaths per 1,000); infant mortality declined by 42 percent 
(to 59 deaths per 1,000); and under-5 mortality has been almost halved (to 88 deaths per 
1,000). 32 The latest Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data finds that during 2005-11 
maternal mortality changed only insignificantly (decline from 676 to 673 deaths per 100,000 live 
births) as well as proportion of births attended by a skilled person (increase from 6 to 10 
percent).  While these MDG targets are still achievable, they will require intensified efforts (see 
paragraph 82).  

41. 
The driving force behind Ethiopia’s success in the health sector has been a sound sector 
strategy – the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) – which over the past 15 years has 
governed investments of the Government and its development partners to expand health 
infrastructure and strengthen health service delivery systems.  Ethiopia is also at the forefront of 
international health initiatives and partnerships: it was the first country to sign the International

Health Partnership (IHP+) Compact in 2007 that allowed Ethiopia to establish an “MDG Fund”, 
which now serves as the preferred channel for most of the internal and external resources related 
to reaching health MDGs in Ethiopia.33  

42. 
Ethiopia has one of the highest burdens of chronic under-nutrition in the world, 
despite some decreases of anemia in children and women. During 2005-11, prevalence of 
anemia among preschool aged children and women age 15-49 years was reduced by 10 
percentage points each.34 Reductions have been larger in urban areas, and larger reductions have 
been recorded for the worse classifications (e.g., moderate and severe anemia). Nonetheless, 
anemia prevalence rates remain high at 44 and 17 percent (2011) in preschool aged children and 
women aged 15-49 years, respectively. According to the recent analysis by CSA (2011), less 
than one-fifth of households consume iodized salt. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies affect 
millions of women and children across the country. Among under-five children, 29 percent are 
underweight and 44 percent are stunted (chronic under-nutrition - short for their age).35 Stunting 
rates are similar in both food secure and food insecure woredas and children are undernourished 
in one-quarter of even the richest households.  It is estimated that Ethiopia will lose more than 
US$13 billion from 2006-15 due to iron deficiency anemia and stunting. 36 This evidence 
suggests chronic under-nutrition is not only an issue of access to food, but also about provision 
of the right combination of food as well as of caring practices and disease. 

Social Protection 

43. 
Despite substantial decreases in poverty rates, vulnerability exists in Ethiopia at 
individual and community levels. Sources of vulnerability are manifold including natural 
disasters (e.g., droughts and floods); food shortages; macroeconomic shocks (e.g., high levels of 
inflation); health and nutrition risks (e.g., HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases); conflict and 
environmental degradation coupled with climate change. These shocks by themselves have an 
immediate effect of lowering living standards and perpetuating the poverty trap among the poor 
and the vulnerable. Because there are currently few possibilities to insure against these shocks, 
poor Ethiopians adopt negative coping mechanisms, such as accumulating livestock, even if the 
returns are low, or taking their children out of school to work on the farm, which are likely to 
keep them in poverty now and for future generations. Although Ethiopia is a young country (70

over US$200 million into the MDG Fund.

lower educational outcomes by impairing abilities to learn. Anemia in women signals poor nutritional status and 
increases risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

employment in rural and urban areas results in significant un- and underemployment especially 
among young Ethiopians.  

44. 
Despite a wide range of social protection actions implemented across the country, 
prevalence of vulnerabilities is on the rise and food insecurity is a significant developmental 
challenge. The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), Ethiopia’s largest social protection 
program and one component of the Food Security Program, 37 has had a positive impact on 
livelihoods, especially during times of crisis.38 However, while the food security situation of 
program beneficiaries has improved and productive assets and livestock holdings have increased, 
graduation levels from the program (1.4 million thus far) have been lower than anticipated in the 
GTP. Addressing the issue of vulnerabilities and food insecurity exclusively by means of social 
protection is not going to yield the expected results nor reduce the number of households 
participating in the program in a sustainable way. Broad-based economic growth with agriculture 
and industry as the main drivers is clearly seen as key in reducing poverty, vulnerabilities and 
increasing resilience in the medium- to long-term. Simultaneously, strengthening national 
systems is needed to improve delivery of social services (e.g., health and education) and to better 
prepare and respond to shocks (discussed in Chapter II, section C).  

D. 

Gender 

45. GoE has a strong commitment to gender equality, which is firmly rooted in national 
policies as well as in the signing of international and regional treaties and protocols on women’s 
rights. The GTP highlights gender as a cross cutting theme (p.110). The Ministry of Women, 
Youth and Children’s Affairs contributes to policy development and supports gender 
mainstreaming in all government ministries and bureaus and spearheads responses to address 
gender inequalities.39 To date gender units have been established in all line ministries and in the 
regions. However, implementation capacity remains a serious challenge. 

46. Over the past decade, Ethiopia recorded good progress towards gender equality in 
education and health.40  During 2006-11 the female GER for primary and secondary education 
increased from 84 to 93 percent and from 25 to 35 percent respectively. Due to extensive 
campaigns and increased availability, use of contraceptives doubled from 2005 to 2011 (from 15 
to 29 percent) and family planning increased from 25 to 60 percent of households (Ethiopia 
Population and Housing Census 2007). Fertility declined by 10 percent, while adolescent fertility 
was reduced by 35 percent in the same period. Despite these efforts, the share of women without 
education is almost double that of men (51 versus 29 percent in 2011), and literacy levels of 
women are markedly lower than those of men especially in rural areas and among urban poor. 
The retention level of girls in secondary education is lower than that of boys, and the gender gap 
is steep in tertiary education. Finally, harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation 
and early marriages are widely practiced and gender based violence are widespread.

Program and the Complementary Capital Investments Program.

Significant progress has been made in providing joint land certification for wives 
and husbands in rural areas of the four main regions of the country. More than 20 million land-
use certificates have been issued with both spouses’ names and photos on the certificates, and 
women’s registration for land increased significantly. Some of the benefits of those programs are 
already becoming apparent as women are showing a strong sense of ownership and security that 
their rights will be upheld in case of divorce. More intensified efforts are needed to improve 
women’s access to farm inputs, extension advice and credit, which will contribute to increased 
land productivity and the country’s economic growth. 

II. Development Challenges and the Government Agenda 

48. 
The development agenda of Ethiopia for the next 3 years (until 2014/15) is governed 
by the Growth and Transformation Plan, GoE’s strategy that has been under implementation 
since 2010/11.41 The main goals of the GTP are for Ethiopia to “extricate itself from poverty to 
reach the level of a middle-income economy as of 2020-23.” Drawing from lessons learned from 
the prior poverty reduction strategy (PASDEP, 2005-10), the GTP has the following objectives 
(Appendix 1): (a) to attain a high average real GDP growth rate of 11 percent per annum within a 
stable macroeconomic framework; (b) to achieve MDG goals in the social sectors, especially the 
quality of education and health services; and (c) to establish a stable and democratic, 
developmental state. In order to attain these goals, GTP places strong emphasis on economic 
growth and job creation with industry and modern agriculture as key drivers. During the 
transition period social protection will play an important role, especially in providing safety nets 
to the large food-insecure population. 

49. 
The “developmental state” model adopted by GoE has shown significant results 
over the past decade, nevertheless attaining the GTP goals will most likely become more 
difficult in coming years as the easier gains have already been made, and the global 
environment is not as conducive as before. Enabling the country to move to the higher growth 
trajectory needed to achieve these goals may require attention to several challenges, including: 
ensuring macroeconomic stability; addressing the persistently high numbers of poor and food-
insecure people despite double-digit economic growth and gains in poverty reduction; lagging 
quality of social services; and the weak capacity of the public sector. 

50. 
The development model adopted by GoE relies heavily on high levels of largely 
government-led investments (like the Asian model of development), but faces low saving 
rates and limited availability of domestic resources (unlike the Asian model). Given the high 
investment requirements of the GTP, public investments which in the past years have been one 
of the major drivers of economic growth in Ethiopia, may not be sufficient on their own to 
maintain Ethiopia’s high growth performance going forward. GoE needs to continue its efforts to 
complement its own financing with additional domestic and foreign investments and to increase 
the share of the formal private sector. Over-reliance on public sector investments could result in 

41 See IDA/SecM2011-0581, Report No. 63592-ET, for the Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note on the GTP. 
Appendix 1 provides GTP vision, pillars and selected targets.

an increasing deficit on the External Current Account over the medium to long-term with the 
possibility of increased external vulnerability. Since opportunities for external borrowing will be 
limited, high fiscal deficits may occur, which in turn may further crowd out private investment or 
contribute to increasing inflation rates, if the deficits are monetized.  

51. 
A major challenge for monetary policy will be to keep inflation subdued, despite 
recent bouts of high inflation which could have reversed some of the positive poverty trends. The 
efficiency of current monetary policy is hampered by two main barriers: negative real interest 
rates, which limit demand for government bonds and Treasury Bills (T-bills) and thus the ability 
of GoE to finance its ambitious development plans; and direct central bank financing of the 
government deficit. At the same time, monetary policy instruments are very limited in Ethiopia 
relying mainly on interventions in the foreign exchange market (e.g., selling foreign currency to 
absorb domestic liquidity). High and persistent inflation also negatively impacts savings, which 
at current levels of 6-7 percent of GDP are insufficient to support GTP’s growth targets. 

52. 
Another challenge facing Ethiopia is to ensure that poverty gains are sustainable 
and that high economic growth benefits the poor.  As discussed in paragraph 38, based on the 
2010/11 HICE and Welfare Monitoring Surveys, the proportion of poor people in the country 
declined to 29.6 percent and food poverty to 33.6 percent.  However, the number of poor in 
2010/11 estimated at 25 million is still at the same absolute level as 15 years ago (25.6 million in 
1995/96) and food poverty has increased in absolute terms from 27 million people in to 28.4 
million, partially due to population growth. Despite strong real GDP and GDP per capita growth, 
the number of chronic and transitory food-insecure people remains persistently high, reaching 
the same absolute number of people in need as during the 2003 crisis (Figure 4).  If the current 
high level of livelihood dependency on subsistence agriculture remains, food insecurity and 
vulnerability will likely increase because of the impact from climate change.

53. While access to basic social services (especially health and education) and 
infrastructure has considerably improved, the quality of those services and public sector 
capacity has not kept pace. This is partly due to the focus on increased access in order to 
achieve the MDGs, which has placed a strain on existing facilities. However, accelerated 
economic growth will increasingly require skilled labor that can respond to the changing 
demands of the real sector. In this context quality primary, secondary and tertiary education will 

Page 19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
become progressively more important. Achievements of some of the MDGs (such as maternal 
mortality rate and the proportion of births attended by a skilled person) will also require a 
renewed focus on health care quality. Delivering quality services will in turn require 
continued efforts to build the capacity of the public service, both its institutions and its 
human resources. Decentralization will need to be deepened including by providing adequate 
resources especially for capital investments, and by allowing regions and woredas to exercise 
discretion in their utilization.   

54. 
To address these key challenges and succeed in meeting the GTP goals of reducing 
poverty and becoming a middle income country within a decade Ethiopia will need to succeed 
in transforming its economy in at least the following four dimensions: 

 

Increased productivity and competitiveness of the industrial and services sectors for rapid 
and sustained job creation (GTP pillars 3 and 4); 
 Transformation to modern and productive agriculture (GTP pillar 2); 
 Strengthened systems to better respond to shocks and increase resilience (GTP pillar 5); and, 
 
Improved government effectiveness (GTP pillar 6). 

The Government needs to pursue these objectives concurrently, as strong synergies exist 
between them.  

55. 
Experiences from a range of countries indicate that economic growth cannot be 
sustained unless there is also a structural transformation where people move from 
subsistence agriculture to higher productivity activities.42 New and diverse job opportunities 
in urban, peri-urban and rural areas will draw the excess of unemployed and underemployed 
population (mostly youth) from overpopulated rural settings to where their skills can be utilized 
more productively. However, lowering population pressure on land will not on its own be 
sufficient to transform subsistence agriculture into modern and more productive agriculture. 
Complementary efforts are needed to diversify livelihoods, as well as to enhance agricultural 
growth (e.g., provision of key public infrastructure, stable regulatory framework, private sector 
engagement, leveraging mobile technologies to enhance productivity of farmers and businesses). 
Improving the effectiveness of GoE support will also be critical so that it can effectively and 
efficiently promote the transformation process through direct and indirect interventions. GoE 
also has a key role to play in providing basic social services (e.g., health and education), which 
will underpin people’s ability to respond positively to new opportunities. In time, this virtuous 
circle will enhance social cohesion by creating positive economic and social spillovers for 
individuals as well as the country. Finally, as the urbanization process accelerates, important 
challenges will need to be addressed, such as adequate planning at the municipal level, and the 
provision of adequate infrastructure (especially transport and energy), housing and other 
services. In the absence of such provision, rising urbanization will lead to poverty, the creation of 
slums, and deteriorating environmental quality.

56. 
Broad-based economic growth in all sectors of the economy will, in the long term, 
lead to a sustainable enhancement of resilience and reduction of vulnerabilities of the 
Ethiopian people.  Since the 1990s GoE and its development partners have sought to meet the 
challenge of food insecurity primarily through investments that directly targeted a large, 
chronically food insecure population.  These programs have demonstrated benefits to bridge food 
gaps, reduce asset depletion, increase resilience to shocks, and modestly diversify and increase 
income.  However experience to date suggests that sustainable graduation from food insecurity 
cannot be expected to be achieved with only safety net participation and limited assistance from 
food security focused interventions; it will require a more comprehensive support including 
programs that focus on increasing agricultural productivity, access to microcredit as well as 
improved delivery and quality of social services (especially health and education).  While there 
is a need for a comprehensive social protection system that allows GoE to manage risks and 
respond to disasters (and indeed social transfers may be necessary for the chronic poor), for the 
majority of the population diversification of livelihoods and employment opportunities, in both 
rural and urban areas, and a comprehensive approach to agricultural growth, in both low 
potential and high potential areas, offers the only viable and sustainable solution to food-
insecurity in the medium- to long-term.  

A. 

Job Creation through Increased Productivity and Competitiveness 

57. 
Ethiopia needs to urgently address the needs of a rapidly increasing job-seeking 
population through accelerated growth of off-farm employment and labor intensive 
industries. Around 85 percent of Ethiopia's population depends on small-holder agriculture, 
mostly in subsistence farming.  Rural population growth is leading to a decreasing average size 
of holdings resulting in an increasing number of households for which subsistence farming is no 
longer a viable way of life. However, many young men and women in rural communities have 
limited or no formal employment prospects.  This challenge will persist in the context of a high 
population growth rate. In addition, thousands of students graduating from universities and 
colleges have aspirations of not returning to their parents’ farms, but instead moving into urban 
and peri-urban areas, to look for jobs. Between 2 and 2.5 million young people are entering the 
labor market every year.  This contrasts with a total of 2.5 million people in paid employment in 
2011, of which only 1.5 million were employed in the formal private sector. During the GTP 
period, the number of young people entering the urban labor market will be almost ten times the 
number of people retiring (CSA, 2011). As Ethiopia aspires to become a middle income country, 
urbanization is therefore not just inevitable, but it is also a key factor in delivering economic 
growth.43 

58. 
To maintain GDP growth at double digits and create new jobs, industrial and 
export-led growth is critical, as appropriately acknowledged by the GTP (p.22).44 Accordingly 
during 2010-15 industrial growth is expected to double (from 10 to 20 percent) and export 
growth to accelerate from 12.5 to 19.4 percent. This will lead to a higher contribution of 
manufacturing to GDP and a larger share of light manufacturing in exports (currently 5.5 and 9 

43 As the 2009 World Development Report shows, no developed country has reached its current per capita income 
without the advantages of urbanization and vibrant cities. 
44 Agriculture sector is also singled out as a major source of growth, which is the focus of section B below. 

Page 21 

 
 
 
                                                            
percent respectively). The GTP (p.56-60) defines a two-pronged approach to ensuring faster and 
sustained development of the industrial sector. The main strategic direction is to support 
expansion and development of micro and small enterprises (MSEs), as well as to promote the 
establishment of medium and large scale firms.45 Secondly, a special focus will be given to five 
sectors which, based on recent analysis, capitalize on the country’s endowment and comparative 
advantage: textiles and garments; leather and leather products; sugar and related products; 
cement; and the metal and engineering industry.46 In addition, GTP identifies tourism sector as a 
source of job creation particularly for MSEs and women (Box 2).  

59. GoE’s focus on job creation is well-placed reflecting a challenge faced by 
Governments across the globe.  In this context the 2013 World Development Report (WDR) 
highlights that jobs are at the center of three transformations: living standards, productivity and 
social cohesion. Across the world jobs are a key source of household income and a prerequisite 
for poverty reduction. Employment growth is compatible with productivity growth as more 
productive jobs are created at the expense of less productive ones.  Clustering of firms, 
participation in international and regional trade, and foreign investment all bring new ideas and 
support knowledge spillovers and specialization. However, while micro- and small enterprises 
account for the bulk of job creation in developing countries, they also account for the bulk of job 
destruction, resulting in job “churn” but not growth. Finally, jobs are more than just earnings and 
benefits as they are the main source of satisfaction with life and employment status across 
regions. In conclusion, jobs have important spillover effects – both economic and social for 
individuals as well as a broadly defined community.47

Supporting enterprises across all sizes and sectors will be critical in creating new 
jobs in Ethiopia. According to the preliminary results of the 2012 World Bank Enterprise 
Survey for Ethiopia,48 during FY2008-10 Ethiopia experienced an overall employment growth 

45 Small enterprises employ 5-19 people; medium 20-99 people; large employ more than 100 people. 
46 In addition the GTP also singles out the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. 
47 Regarding social cohesion, jobs have an important role to play in terms of improving the well-being of 
individuals, influencing values and behaviors, and connecting people of different social and ethnic backgrounds thus 
increasing tolerance. 
48 This analysis is based on 2011-12 WB Enterprise Survey. Data collected thus far covered 301 firms located in 
Addis Ababa: 149 manufacturing and 152 services firms. Since the survey was still ongoing at the time of writing, 
weights, which are indispensable in making assertions about the whole economy, have not yet been computed.

rate of 11.1 percent.49 Among enterprises, small firms had the highest employment growth rate 
of 14.4 percent, while medium and large firms experienced growth rate of 9.5 and 2 percent 
respectively. Firms in services had slightly higher employment growth (12 percent) compared to 
firms in manufacturing (10 percent). In terms of job creation, medium-sized firms generated 45 
percent of the total of new jobs, while small firms generated almost as many new jobs as large 
firms (Figure 5). 50 However large firms remain the main contributor to total employment (78 
percent of total jobs in 2010) compared to medium firms which contributed 15 percent of total 
employment in the same period.

61. While there are many ongoing initiatives in Ethiopia to promote labor intensive industries 
(e.g., recent success stories in the footwear and garment industries), in order for Ethiopia to 
rapidly create jobs in the manufacturing sector a more systematic approach to investments 
is needed. This would require GoE to tackle several structural and regulatory challenges. Recent 
analytical work on Africa’s manufacturing experience, in comparison to China and Vietnam, 
provides insights and recommendations for developing Ethiopia’s light manufacturing and labor-
intensive industries.  Accordingly, the availability and quality of inputs, access to finance and 
land seem the most critical constraints to improving competitiveness and accelerating growth in 
selected light manufacturing sectors in Ethiopia (Table 4). These results are also corroborated by 
the 2012 WB Enterprise Survey, which highlighted access to finance and land as two critical 
constraints across sectors in Ethiopia. Both constraints seem to be more acute for small and 
medium size firms. Finally it is important to recognize that frequent and abrupt changes to the 

Caution is needed in interpreting the results for the global comparison as results for SSA and global averages are 
representative at the country level (i.e. survey weights are used to make inferences). 
49 Employment growth is measured as the ratio of the annualized change in employment over the average 
employment of the initial and final year (Haltiwanger index). This measure reduces the impact of a very low initial 
level of employment, which can produce very high rates of growth (i.e., a firm that grows employment from 1 to 10, 
would render a 900 percent growth rate). Employment growth rate is measured over FY 2008-10. 
50 Contribution to job creation is computed as the share of different sub-population groups (e.g. small, medium and 
large firms or manufacturing and services firms) to net job creation, where job creation is the change in the number 
of permanent, full-time employees between FY08-10. Changes in employment are derived by aggregating the 
changes reported by each firm in the sample. Size is defined using 2008 as the baseline year.  Contribution to 
employment is computed as the share of different sub-population groups to total employment, where total 
employment is the number of permanent, full-time employees in 2010 and derived by aggregating the employment 
reported by each firm in the sample. Size is defined using 2010 as the base year.

regulatory framework heighten the perception of risk in the country and may negatively affect 
decisions by domestic as well as foreign investors. 

62. GoE has shown strong interest in addressing these key obstacles by implementing a 
range of financial and non-financial instruments.  As part of a broader industrial and trade 
development strategy, the GTP (p.61) plans to establish Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as a 
platform for catalyzing diversification, upgrading and growth. Similarly, to promote the Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector, GoE intends to facilitate development of 
industrial clusters, which would connect firms in a particular field with links to related 
institutions such as financial providers, educational institutions, and various levels of 
government. 51 These initiatives aim to enable firms to overcome constraints in the areas of 
capital, skills, technology, and logistics as well as to grow and compete by fostering production 
value chains and achieving efficiency gains. 52 To ensure that the SEZ platform energizes 
MSMEs along with FDI and larger domestic investors, the Government recognizes that policies 
to support effective links between local SMEs and the globally-competitive firms anchored in the 
zones will be critical. Since specialized lending to MSMEs typically comes at a relatively later 
stage of banking sector development, GoE is considering using lines of credit as effective tools 
to build capacity in the banking sector and to improve access to finance by MSMEs. 
Simultaneously, there is a need for capacity building,53 financial infrastructure development54 
and a proper corporate governance framework, so that commercial banks (state and private) can 
play their intermediation function in financing MSMEs (GTP, p.62).  

63. While Government’s efforts to alleviate some of the key constraints facing light 
manufacturing through the establishment of SEZs and clustering of firms are commendable, the 
importance of 
strengthening 
the regulatory environment 
that will encourage 
entrepreneurship and innovation, and enhance earning opportunities for the vast majority 
working in the formal and informal sectors cannot be overstated. Successful implementation 
of the GTP is predicated on finding a path to sustain its very high financing requirements. 55  
Attracting more private inflows (domestic and FDI) into the targeted sectors will play an 
important role in leveraging public resources. However, as most jobs in Ethiopia are created by 
new and usually small enterprises, creating a positive overall business environment for the 
MSMEs operating in “other” sectors is critical to unleashing their potential, improving their 
productivity and facilitating their transition from informal-to-formal status (Box 1). Failure to do 
so would constitute a missed opportunity. In this context, improving registration, licensing, 
taxation and trade logistics seems to be of particular importance.56 Strengthening public-private 

51 In this context MSE development also contributes to the GoE’s efforts to increase the economic empowerment of 
women, and the development of small scale income generating activities for women is a specific aim of the GTP.

53 Such as tailoring information requirements and monitoring practices to MSME clients; using credit scoring 
techniques in lieu of collateral; developing innovative ways of lending, including using stock as collateral, order 
financing and invoice discounting.

initiatives were supported by the World Bank as part of the first phase of the Financial Sector Capacity Project.

partnership and dialogue can also greatly contribute to GoE’s job creation agenda (Box 5 in 
Chapter III). 

Box 1: Entry and operation constraints to MSMEs 

Registration: currently businesses need to renew their license every year as a commercial registration for the whole life span 
of a business does not exist. Moreover, there is a requirement to inform the register every time a registered business starts 
carrying out commercial activities in a new location as well as for permit for expansion and upgrading. Initial capital 
requirements for limited liability companies also represent a barrier to entry. Integration of commercial and tax registrations, 
introduction of the principle of the validity of commercial registration for the whole life span of a business, substituting annual 
renewal with annual information update would address some of these constraints. 
Licensing: the lack of a unique “license to sell” for all registered business implies that businesses are required to comply with 
different licensing requirements (including the requirement for obtaining an export/import license) leading to an excessive and 
costly administrative burden.  
Taxation: uncertainty related to the basis of criteria and turnover proxies used for the presumptive taxation for “small” 
taxpayers (Category C) below the 100,000 ETB/year (about US$5,860/year) represent another significant barrier to MSME 
development. Appeals system is perceived to be costly and have limited independence. 
Trade logistics: currently a large number of declarations and supporting documents are required for border clearance 
(import/export) leading to costly trade logistics (higher inland transport cost, higher port and terminal handling fees, letters of 
credit). Recognizing the poor performance in this regard, Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority is currently taking 
encouraging reform initiatives including the enactment of a new Customs Proclamation that is expected to improve the 
import/export environment in Ethiopia and streamline the documentation process. 

64. 
Regional integration and the boosting of intra-regional trade can play a critical role 
in driving productivity and growth over a sustained period as happened in East Asia in the 
1980s and 1990s and recently in China. As correctly noted by the GTP (p.63-64), implementing 
a less restrictive and more efficient trading regime would help Ethiopia deepen regional trade 
integration in goods and services within the African continent and beyond. There is substantial 
potential for Ethiopia to increase its share in regional trade, especially with the East African 
Community (EAC), the fastest growing regional group in the World after ASEAN. In 2010 only 
0.3 percent of Ethiopia’s export went to the EAC, compared to Uganda’s 20 percent. GoE’s 
plans to implement measures that would help Ethiopia’s light-manufacturing industry become 
more competitive internationally would also improve its regional competitiveness. In addition, it 
may be worthwhile exploring the possibility of Ethiopia participating in regional supply chains 
and how this might encourage inward FDI. Ethiopia can also play an important role in cross-
border trade in agricultural products (paragraph 77). Regarding services, a recent World Bank 
study found that Ethiopia had the most restrictive trade policy in the services sector of 78 
developing and 
transition countries sampled 
(financial services, 
telecommunications, 
professional and retail distributions).57 Exports of services appear to be of particular importance 
for land-locked countries, such as Ethiopia, for whom opportunities to diversify into the export 
of manufactures are more limited by the high costs of transporting goods.  

65. 
Entrepreneurship and technical skills development and technology upgrading are 
critical for rapid expansion of all firms, regardless of their size and sector. In order to 
improve firms’ productivity and competitiveness, it is important to adopt new and more efficient 
technologies and ensure the quality of products. To do so, a skilled and semi-skilled labor force 
is necessary. Unfortunately, currently the availability of training is limited and its quality is often 
low. 58 Institutions mandated with provision of training (e.g., Regional State Micro & Small 

57 De-Fragmenting Africa. Deepening Regional Trade Integration in Goods and Services. World Bank , 2012.  
58 Only 7 percent of all MSEs have access to training (Ethiopia Development and Research Institute EDRI, 2004) 
and training is not tailored well to the needs of managers (Triodos Facet 2011, Grunder 2010).

Enterprises Development Agency (REMSEDA), Technical and Vocational Education and 
Training (TVET) institutions and One Stop Shops) lack understanding and appreciation of 
demand driven approaches. While it is important to build their capacity, as planned under the 
GTP (p.86-91), it is equally important to shift towards market based approaches and partnership 
with industry so that firms’ demands for aptly skilled labor are met. Support is also necessary to 
strengthen three government technical institutes mandated to provide technical support and 
technology transfer to selected manufacturing industries with high potential for export, income 
and employment growth (e.g., the Textile Industry Development Institute, the Leather 
Development Institute and the Metal Industry Development Institute). Upgrading of the institutes 
can benefit MSEs through transfer of technology and technical assistance especially to 
strengthen the clusters in the cities. In addition to specialized training, GTP (p.86-91) 
recognizes the importance of improving quality of education, especially secondary and 
tertiary discussed in paragraph 81 below.  

Box 2: Tourism sector – an untapped source of jobs 

Tourism sector in Ethiopia can become an important source of jobs benefitting many poor, particularly SMEs, women, and 
youth. Currently, the hotels and restaurants subsector alone employs over 408,000 people in urban areas compared to 22,000 
people employed in leather industry and 35,000 in floriculture (CSA, 2011). Close to 88 percent of the people employed in 
restaurants and hotels are women, about 60 percent are self-employed, and more than 50 percent are less than 30 years old. 
Ethiopia’s craft sector has the highest impact potential in terms of poverty reduction, with 55 percent of tourist expenditure 
benefiting poor households (ODI 2009). Ethiopia has clear advantages as the “All-of-Africa” in one country destination with 
a good mix of unspoiled culture and nature resources; it has a reputation as a safe and secure destination; and it has good 
opportunities to build on complementarities with well marketed neighboring countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Djibouti. 
Ethiopian Airlines offers good accessibility and competitive air fares. Addis Ababa is quickly becoming a diplomatic capital 
and a major regional hub for air transport.  

The GTP recognizes this potential and establishes ambitious targets for the tourism sector including doubling of tourism 
arrivals (to 1 million) and a twelve-fold increase of tourists´ expenditures (to Birr 3bn) during 2010-15. In order to achieve 
these goals, Ethiopia needs to address challenges related to the tourism-related regulatory framework and business 
environment; institutional management capacity; and cross-sectoral linkages. The WBG, in collaboration with the Ministry of 
Culture and Tourism, is actively supporting the implementation of the 2009 National Tourism Development Policy. Through 
the Ethiopia Sustainable Tourism Development Program and policy dialogue supported by the recently published analysis 
“Ethiopia’s Tourism Sector: Strategic Paths to Competitiveness and Job Creation” (June 2012). IFC is currently organizing a 
Tourism Public-Private Dialogue Forum and is also planning to increase its investment activity in the sector.

66. 
Addressing gender inequality and gaps in women’s and men’s development 
opportunities will help advance the Government’s job creation agenda. Global experience 
indicates that including women in economic activities brings substantial benefits to growth.59 
According to recent analysis, reducing gender inequalities in education and the labor market 
could increase the annual GDP growth in Ethiopia by 1.9 percentage points (World Bank, 2008). 
However, currently women in Ethiopia are mainly responsible for household duties; they lack 
economic opportunities, they have limited involvement in cash crop production, non-farm 
enterprises, and wage employment; and they face much larger barriers to doing business than 
men do. The unemployment rate among females is more than twice as large as that of males in 

59 See Appendix 6 for detailed analysis.

urban areas, so they are less experienced and the wage gap between men and women with a 
similar background, doing the same job, is around 50 percent. Tourism sector, which offers 
significant employment opportunities for women, is still relatively underdeveloped although 
GoE is taking important steps in promoting the sector (Box 2). There is also a pronounced 
gender gap in access to and control of productive resources. Although women contribute much 
of the agricultural labor, their access to land continues to be limited despite joint land 
certification efforts.  

67. Government’s focus on the job creation agenda through industrialization will 
inevitably lead to acceleration of urbanization. According to the most recent data, about 14 
million Ethiopians lived in urban areas in 2011 (up from 9.8 million in 2000), of which about 3 
million live in Addis Ababa.60 The annual growth rate of the urban population is 4.3 percent and 
by 2020 cities are projected to be home to 20 percent of Ethiopia’s population. 61 The urban 
economy is emerging as a major driver of growth: urban areas are estimated to now account for 
close to 50 percent of GDP and about 60 percent of growth in GDP.62 However, for Ethiopia to 
realize the benefits of urbanization important challenges need to be addressed including, inter 
alia, limited capacity of urban local governments in the area of planning and budgeting; 
expansion and maintenance of good quality of infrastructure; and delivery of basic social 
services (GTP, p.24). 

68. 
Despite good progress in improving access to infrastructure (as discussed in Chapter I) 
power disruptions and shortages, and high transport costs were identified among the top 
ten obstacles to firms’ growth and job expansion.63 To address problems related to electricity 
(Table 5) and to keep up with the expected 25 percent per year growth of domestic demand for 
electricity, GoE’s Energy Sector Strategy envisages ambitious expansion of grid and off-grid 
connectivity 64 to 75 percent of towns and villages and to double the number of consumers 
connected to the grid to 4 million by 2015. The high cost of the planned energy sector investment 
program under the GTP (estimated at US$11bn, of which US$3.5bn has already been raised 
mostly through short term bonds) has created financial viability challenges for EEPCO, and will 
create an additional burden of about US$2bn on GoE’s budget in FY2012-20 (cumulatively) 
which is equivalent to 3-4 percent of GoE’s annual budget expenditure. GoE, therefore, needs to 
develop and implement a medium term program of revenue enhancement and/or debt 
restructuring for EEPCO. Efficiency improvements (by reducing system losses) also may 
contribute, but only modestly, since operational efficiency gains would improve the financial 
performance by only about 1-2%. In addition, EEPCO needs to modernize its operations and 
build its capacity by investing in human resources and training in order to be capable of handling

63 According to the results of the 2012 Enterprise Survey, electricity was identified as the third most important 
constraint and transport as ninth. 
64 GOE plans on expanding grid intensification programs as well as increasing the adoption of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency products and services in areas where gird is not present today and also to provide modern energy 
services to households in grid connected areas unable to afford grid connection.

current and forthcoming growth. This agenda will require upgrading the skills and strengthening 
the organization, including for planning, executing and operating the electricity network and 
services, as well as improving back-office operations, such as billing and accounting.

69. 
Ethiopia has vast potential renewable energy resources (about 45,000 MW hydro; 10,000 
MW geothermal and 5,000 MW wind potential). GOE intends to become the power hub of 
East Africa and play a critical role in the East Africa Power Pool (EAPP) area, where 
demand is expected to increase by 69 percent over the next 10 years. Realization of this ambition 
requires organizational structures that can help plan and implement cross-border interconnection 
facilities, harmonize operational rules of practice for interconnected national power grids, and 
put in place a transparent, fair, and viable commercial framework for cross-border trading in 
energy services. Such trade will put East Africa on a cleaner development path in terms of 
carbon emissions and will also help balance loads when other renewable energy resources, such 
as concentrated solar and geothermal energy, are deployed on a large scale. Effective and viable 
modern utilities will be essential to support timely and effective implementation of these large 
investment projects. 

70. 
For the past decade the Government, in collaboration with other partners (including the 
World Bank), has been heavily investing in expansion of the road network and to reform and 
modernize the sector in accordance with the Road Sector Development Program (RSDP). The 
GTP (p.68) reconfirms GoE’s commitment to increase the size and quality of the road 
network to keep pace with rising demand and sets out ambitious targets. So far donors have 
mainly focused on federal roads (e.g., regional arterial and link roads). However, there is a great 
need for improved infrastructure and efficiencies within the rural and community road networks. 
To that end the Universal Rural Road Access Program (URRAP), one of the largest public works 
programs in Ethiopia, is focusing on building the necessary rural road networks and at the same 
time generating employment opportunities, both for skilled and unskilled labor. The Ethiopian 
Road Authority, which is responsible for overall network planning, road development and 
coordination in the country, needs capacity support so that the timeliness and quality of road 
construction projects is improved.

71. 
International best practices show that a vibrant local ICT industry creates jobs, 
improves productivity and fosters innovation.65  The National ICT for Development (ICT4D) 
Action Plan for Ethiopia (2006-10) aims to build an ICT-driven economy. While some progress 
has been achieved, GoE should consider leveraging opportunities presented in the global and 
domestic IT-based services market for the Ethiopian economy. To facilitate this process, steps 
need to be undertaken to improve policy, legal, regulatory and institutional framework; facilitate 
development of a highly skilled talent pool and adaptation to new technologies; and improving 
access to finance and ICT infrastructure. 

B. 

Transformation to Modern and Productive Agriculture 

72. 
Agriculture is Ethiopia’s largest area of private sector activity and a major source 
of economic growth. The sector employs the vast majority of Ethiopians, makes up most of the 
country’s exports, and is at the center of Ethiopia’s development challenges, whether related to 
poverty and food security or to the environment, natural resources management and climate 
change (as discussed in paragraphs 25 and 26). Rapid industrialization and urbanization will be 
necessary to achieve Ethiopia’s growth goals, but the dominance of agriculture in the economy 
and employment–combined with high population growth–means that the performance of the 
sector will remain central to overall growth and poverty reduction for many years to come.  

73. 
The GTP (p.45) sets out GoE’s intention to transform the sector from subsistence to 
more market-led production. Notwithstanding high growth rates over past years, agricultural 
productivity is still at low levels and most of the food produced on the farm remains consumed 
by the farm household. Transformation requires a significant increase in agricultural production, 
driven by an increase in productivity, as well as development of more effective and efficient 
markets. Building on experience with the implementation of previous strategies, 66 the GTP 
(p.45-55) outlines a three-pronged approach: (i) small-holder agriculture development, the 
mainstay of Ethiopia agriculture, dominating overall production and employment; (ii) pastoral 
development; and (iii) large-scale commercial farming development (including horticulture). 
Agricultural commercialization is reflected in an emphasis that increased agricultural production 
can provide the inputs for the development of agro-based industries as well as being a basis for 
becoming commercially viable in international markets. 

74. 
Farms, businesses and smallholder farmers have needs similar to MSEs and face 
similar constraints to their growth, such as limited access to markets, land, finance, and skills 
and technology (as discussed in paragraphs 60-64).67 Therefore, addressing these constraints and 
creating a favorable regulatory environment would also benefit farming as a business (whether 
small- or large-scale), agribusiness and other related sectors, thereby impacting the profitability 
of primary agriculture itself. However, agriculture would also require reforms in areas 
specific to the sector including seeds, soil fertility and fertilizer, and the role and functioning of

sectors. Everest analysis; National Association of Software and Services Companies , NASSCOM, 2011 
66 Namely, the long-standing Agricultural Development-Led Industrialization (ADLI) Strategy and the previous 
five-year development strategy, PASDEP. 
67 Although some of the constraints are exacerbated given factors such as remoteness from financial center with 
services, high risks and seasonality of production, or weak land administration and management. 

Page 29 

 
 
 
 
                                                            
cooperatives.  To address these issues, in 2010 GoE established an Agricultural Transformation 
Agency (ATA). This new institution, in close coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, is 
working on some of the most crucial reform areas specific to agriculture as well as new 
initiatives to form public-private partnerships that encourage agribusinesses to invest and source 
from smallholder farmers.   

75. 
Land is a factor of the business environment which is especially important for 
agriculture. For most farmers user rights to land is their biggest asset or production factor. As 
has been shown globally and for Ethiopia, land tenure security and the ease with which user 
rights can be transferred are important determinants of investments into agriculture. Ethiopia has 
remarkable land resources, but land is scarce in most of the densely populated highlands, and 
under threat from serious land degradation. More land for cultivation is available in other parts of 
the country, but the expansion of agriculture in these areas will require careful management to 
address serious social and environmental risks associated with it. The management of communal 
land – including pastoral land – including the protection of communal land rights is also critical 
for the return and sustainability of these resources.  

76. 
Domestically, although cooperatives play a crucial role in input markets, the direct or 
indirect influence of the Government in key areas such as seeds, fertilizer, breeds and other 
agricultural inputs undermines competition and thus innovation and effectiveness. The agro-
dealer sector, a vibrant part of most rural economies in Africa, is small and underdeveloped in 
Ethiopia.  While GoE’s strategy strengthens the uptake of agricultural inputs and technological 
innovations, the private sector role in these activities has so far been limited. Recent initiatives, 
however, to involve agribusiness enterprises, including international ones, through public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) promise to change this situation over time. These PPPs can strengthen 
agricultural value chains from the farm producer to the consumer of food and other agricultural 
products. Linking farmers to markets through such supply chains will be critical in transforming 
Ethiopian agriculture from subsistence to production. This requires re-thinking and strengthening 
of producer organizations, in particular cooperatives, and the promotion of linkages between 
smallholders and larger commercial farms. ICT, primarily mobile technology, could also provide 
a useful platform to enhance productivity of farmers by delivering just in-time extension 
services, weather and market prices information and connecting them to external markets as well 
as to facilitate more effective seeds and fertilizer management, tracking the distribution. 

77. Great benefits for the agricultural sector can also be realized through international 
trade in the context of regional collaboration. Improved cross-border trade in agricultural 
products is particularly important given the problems of food security in the region and the 
demand for food staples from growing urban centers. Although a member of COMESA, Ethiopia 
only partially participates in the Free Trade Agreement and has not reached agreement with 
neighboring countries on the COMESA Simplified Trade Regime, which is designed to grant 
simplified certificates of origin to an agreed list of products to enable them enjoy duty and quota 
free access. Barriers to trade along the value chain prevent Ethiopia from realizing its potential in 
the agriculture sector. For example, it is estimated that in Ethiopia only about one quarter of the 
demand for improved seed is being satisfied. But the use of improved hybrid maize could 

Page 30 

 
 
 
 
quadruple productivity. Even if just half the farmers achieved the productivity associated with 
using hybrid seeds, domestic production could replace commercial imports.68  

78. 
Commercial agriculture is a challenging business, requiring knowledge in areas as 
diverse as agronomy, economics, finance, and marketing as well as project management. 
Consequently, the needs to be addressed by the research, education and extension systems are 
changing. Traditional agricultural research, which mainly focuses on crops, needs to diversity 
and specialize at the same time. It also needs to be complemented with an education system that 
teaches future farmers and other professionals working in the sector relevant skills. Finally, it 
requires an extension system that provides diversified and specialized information and 
knowledge on demand. Consequently, these agricultural innovation systems need to evolve from 
ones dominated by a public sector with limited capacity towards a more pluralistic approach, in 
which the public sector continues to provide a strong role where needed, but is complemented by 
the private sector, either farmer-controlled or through private firms and institutions. 

79. 
Finally, climate change is particularly important for the agricultural sector as 
farmers are most vulnerable to climate change and agriculture (in particular livestock, forests and 
soils) has the bulk of the potential to reduce green-house gases (GHG) in Ethiopia. It is estimated 
that unless steps to build climate resilience are effective, climate change will reduce Ethiopia’s 
GDP growth by between 0.5 and 2.5 percent each year.69  GoE recognizes the importance and 
urgency of the situation as well as the country’s significant mitigation potential and aims to put 
Ethiopia on a carbon neutral growth trajectory. The Climate Resilience Green Economy (CRGE) 
Strategy is based on four pillars including (i) improved crop and livestock practices; (ii) forestry; 
(iii) renewable energy; and (iv) “leapfrogging to modern and energy-efficient technologies in 
transport, industrial sectors, and buildings.” A major emphasis will be on agriculture and 
forestry, which “contribute around 45 percent and 25 percent respectively to projected GHG 
emission levels under business-as-usual assumptions and together account for around 80 percent 
of the total abatement potential.” Given the ambitious CRGE agenda, changes will be required in 
policies, regulations, and institutions as well as program designs and financial support. 

C. 

Strengthened Systems to Better Respond to Shocks and Increase Resilience 

80. 
Reducing vulnerability and building resilience to shocks is important for sustainable 
economic growth in Ethiopia. While Ethiopia has significant opportunities for transformation 
and growth, many Ethiopians are subject to a large number of shocks, which have an immediate 
effect of lowering living standards, and in many cases can result in permanent stunting of the 
potential intellectual capacity of the next generation of Ethiopians. GoE is currently drafting a 
comprehensive National Social Protection Policy that will provide a framework for the 
coordination and provision of social protection services in Ethiopia.  The Policy recognizes 
that effective social protection services contribute to social cohesion and achievement of broader 
national socio-economic development and security, making growth more effective equitable. It 
aims to address the imbalance in access to basic social services and facilitates investment in

human capital for poor households and communities. The policy commits GoE to prioritize 
additional provision for vulnerable groups through programs such as social safety nets, 
livelihood schemes, social pensions and those programs addressing inequalities in basic services. 
With regard to DRM, GoE’s approach is shifting from response to shocks (saving lives and 
livelihoods) and recovery (immediate post-crisis assistance), to a multi-sectoral multi-hazard 
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) approach, as outlined in the draft National Policy and 
Strategy on Disaster Risk Management (May 2010).  Accordingly, in a complete disaster 
management cycle more emphasis will be given to prevention, mitigation and preparedness. 
Enhancing disaster prevention is facilitated by addressing vulnerabilities and building resilience 
to shocks. This can be achieved, inter alia, by enhancing opportunities for income-earning 
employment (discussed in Chapter II, section A); improving productivity of agriculture and 
shifting towards more sustainable natural resource management (discussed in Chapter II, section 
B); and improved social services delivery, especially health and education, discussed below.  

81. 
Over the past decade access to education services in Ethiopia has expanded considerably 
(paragraph 39), but quality of education has been lagging behind.  There is commitment from 
GoE to improve the quality of education and accordingly there are ongoing programs with the 
support of development partners (including WB) complementing GoE efforts. Nevertheless, the 
bulk of those who have completed primary education may not have acquired basic literacy and 
numeracy.70 In 2010, 38 percent of grade 10 graduates scored below 50 percent - a Ministry of 
Education (MOE) benchmark for minimum competency. The low level of education reduces 
people’s prospects for finding or creating income-earning jobs and, by default, forces them to 
remain in a less-than optimal situation. This also presents opportunity costs. If Ethiopia is to 
achieve its goal to become a MIC in a decade, it will require a labor force with a significant share 
of secondary school graduates. However, the present situation is far from this goal. In 2010, 56 
percent of the labor force did not have schooling, and 29 percent had only primary education. 
The problem of low pass rates and achievement levels is associated not only with quality of 
teaching and learning but also with the nature of the curriculum. Therefore, there is an urgent 
need to reform the secondary curriculum so that it responds better to the skills needed for 
employment rather than just focusing on building knowledge for higher education. For primary 
education, the focus should be on improving the quality of education and increasing completion 
rates.  

82. 
Similarly, while access to health services has considerably improved, some indicators 
remain stubbornly high, such as maternal mortality or chronic under-nutrition. This 
demonstrates that access to services, while a necessary condition, is not sufficient. In order to 
make progress increased capital investments into the sector and focus on quality are required. 
The recent GoE shift under the framework of the latest health sector strategy, HSDP IV, is an 
important step in the right direction. The strategy prioritizes the MDGs and emphasizes concrete 
results over the next 5 years (2011-15) by identifying a list of high impact health inventions and 
measurable performance indicators.  The “MDG Fund” is GoE’s mechanism for providing more 
resources (government and donor funds) to the health sector, allocating them based on results 
and building stronger M&E systems. Finally, for improved quality of services (in health as well 

70 According to 2008 National Learning Assessments, 60 percent of those who have completed grade 8 did not 
acquire the basic competency in mathematics and English. 

Page 32 

 
 
 
                                                            
as education), is it important to ensure that the woreda-level platforms for service delivery rest 
on solid foundations of fiduciary, administrative, and information governance, as discussed in 
Section D below.   

83. 
Regarding disaster mitigation the focus will be on minimizing potential disaster impacts 
through a flexible social safety net mechanism that can quickly scale up when crisis hits and 
scale down when it abates.  During the recent 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia was 
one of the few cases where a scalable safety net under the WB-funded PSNP was in place with 
an early warning system and a risk-financing mechanism, that facilitated increasing the coverage 
and volume of support to those in need in a timely manner, thus allowing the country to avoid a 
more acute crisis. GoE is also considering social insurance as another possible complementary 
mechanism to mitigate the impacts of a disaster on the vulnerable. Finally, GoE is committed to 
increase its focus on preparedness through strengthening early warning system, building logistic 
capacity, maintaining adequate resource reserves and other precautionary measures. 

D. 

Increasing Government Effectiveness 

84. 
For GoE to realize its vision of national and economic transformation and attainment of 
middle-income status through broad-based growth with a strong middle class, it needs a 
government institutional framework which is effective, staffed by civil servants who are 
dedicated to delivering quality services and providing an enabling environment for Ethiopia’s 
transformation. The GTP (p.95) fully recognizes this, and sees the establishment of “… 
government structures with strong implementation capacity” as one of the key strategic 
directions needed to build capacity and establish good governance. The strategy “…aims to 
increase the efficiency, effectiveness, accountability and transparency of public sector service 
delivery”. Whilst significant progress has been made over the last 20 years in building an 
effective state operating through a federal and decentralized architecture, significant challenges 
remain. 

85. 
To secure the GTP’s aim, GoE will need to address severe capacity limitations, 
particularly at decentralized level. In terms of service delivery, this has particular implications 
on quality. Whilst the overall coverage of basic services has increased, evidenced by sectoral 
data presented in previous sections, there remain serious questions about quality across sectors. 
Over the medium term this presents significant challenges to developmental effectiveness, 
particularly in education, health and agriculture, where potential gains secured by wider coverage 
are not fully realized. There are also capacity limitations in important institutions such as ERA 
and EEPCO. The limited implementation capacity of these organizations means that often 
mandates are not delivered upon, and support to large undertakings in infrastructural 
development is often insufficient.  

86. 
The GTP recognizes the need to continue to address human resource development 
systems. This is fully appropriate, and builds on progress already made in civil service reform. 
Whilst reforms within the civil service have addressed some issues around functionality and 
mandate (through business process reengineering), and are creating a platform for more 
performance orientation (through the balanced score card approach) there appear to be human 
resource management challenges across the civil service evidenced by significant vacancies, high 

Page 33 

 
 
 
 
 
staff turnover, and apparently movement across the civil service (or ‘churning’).  There are 
particular challenges in the professions of engineering and accountancy and at decentralized 
level, especially in remote woredas. Whilst the phenomenon is not fully understood, it is agreed 
that it poses significant risks to the quality of service delivery, and to maintaining the hither to 
positive progress made in civil service reform. 

87. GoE also recognizes the need to further strengthen governmental accountability and 
transparency. The GTP notes (p. 97) that it is seeking “… to institutionalize systems ensuring 
transparency and accountability throughout the public service so that the attitudes and actions of 
civil servants are directed towards serving public interests”. As a result a number of initiatives 
relating to access to information, complaint handling, standard setting and the like have been 
integrated into the broader programs of civil service reform.  Nevertheless, weaknesses in formal 
oversight institutions at different levels of government mean that service providers are less likely 
to be called to account over deficiencies in either service coverage or service standards. This 
applies to parliaments at federal and regional level, woreda councils, the Ombudsman, the Anti-
Corruption Commission at both federal and regional level, and offices of Auditors General. 
Appropriate and strong oversight of the public service and public bodies needs to be in place to 
ensure governmental effectiveness.   

88. 
Related to this, there is a need to continue to address the challenges of corruption.  
GoE has, from its outset, shown low tolerance to corruption, and the GTP sets out commitments 
to better educate civil servants in ethical matters, and to embark on practical measures such as 
asset disclosure for political leaders and public officials across all jurisdictions. Nevertheless 
there is a public perception that petty corruption, particularly at the point of service delivery, is 
rising (evidenced by Ethiopia’s Second National Corruption Survey, Federal Ethics and Anti-
corruption Commission of Ethiopia FEACC, 2012). Effective measures need to be put in place to 
dispel these concerns, otherwise significant damage might be inflicted on the credibility of public 
administrations, particularly at decentralized level.  Mobile and internet enabled platforms can 
serve as effective mechanisms for government to disclose information to a greater number of 
citizens, deliver new, innovative services, and allow for faster feedback from its citizens, 
including on the cases of corruption.   

89. Having in place a robust PFM system is vitally important for improving the use of 
and accountability over public funds as well as service delivery. This is recognized in the 
GTP as one of its fundamental governance objectives, to “… establish an effective, efficient, 
transparent, accountable and modern governmental financial management system”. The GTP 
recognizes that while much has already been achieved in this area, a basic platform has been 
built on which a lot more needs to be built, including starting the next generation of PFM 
reforms in Ethiopia through developing a comprehensive PFM Action Plan, establishing the 
regulatory institutions that will manage the introduction and implementation of international 
standards of accounting and auditing, building tax institutions so that they can achieve the GTP 
target of doubling to tax to GDP ratio, improving cash management,  addressing the weak 
control environment in the country through nascent internal audit systems and weak 
procurement, as well as structuring the ad hoc PFM training as it currently exists to deliver better 
value for money. While improvements have been made in financial transparency and 

Page 34 

 
 
 
 
accountability through citizen’s empowerment, more needs to be done regarding legislative 
scrutiny of the budget and parliamentary oversight.  

90. 
A strong commitment to federalism and decentralization remains central to GoE’s 
state-building agenda.  The establishment of a federal structure in the constitution of 1995 has 
subsequently been augmented by ongoing programs of decentralization, which have given 
woredas more powers and gradually pushed significant service delivery through kebeles. 
Commitment to this approach is not without its challenges; the issues of capacity, state 
effectiveness, PFM, oversight and regulation are all made more complex and demanding against 
the decentralized agenda. There is still work to be done with respect to some aspects of the 
architecture if regions and woredas are to deliver on the mandates envisaged for them, including 
issues around revenue assignment. The recent introduction of the MDG Fund by the federal 
government in its budget for FY12, where (in all but Somali and Afar regions) regional 
governments will manage capital expenditure on programs at woreda level, may have 
implications for the woreda-level government.  

91. 
Another essential component of Ethiopia’s transformation process is greater public 
participation in policy making and the holding of governmental administrations and agencies to 
popular account. In Ethiopia there is no long-standing culture of citizens holding government to 
account. GoE’s philosophy that development is not possible without popular participation is 
clearly stated in the GTP (p. 97) which notes that “… public participation is central to ensuring 
citizens’ own development and to the success of good governance initiatives… Citizens 
participate in development processes by expressing their demands and aspirations and so 
contribute to formulating policies and strategies, and to planning, monitoring and evaluation 
activities.” Some progress in this area has already been made with initiatives such as the Good 
Governance Package and the Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA), which have 
been a vehicle for building popular policy consensus. However, a difficulty moving forward will 
be to ensure ongoing participation of Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and other bodies 
which might foster the demand for good governance. 

III. Review of the Past WBG Assistance 

92. 
As part of CPS preparation, the Ethiopia Country Team has prepared two documents that 
provided a retrospective view into the program implemented under the previous CAS; namely  
(i) a Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) for the period FY08-12 
(Appendix 4), and (ii) a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) covering FY09-mid 
FY12. 

93. 
The CAS aimed to help sustain the “dual take-off” of growth and basic services by 
supporting the implementation of key elements of GoE’s Plan for Accelerated and Sustained 
Development to End Poverty (PASDEP, 2005-10). The CAS had four main strategic pillars: (i) 
fostering economic growth, in order to help sustain the emerging economic “take-off”; (ii) 
improving access to and quality of basic service delivery, in order to sustain the emerging basic 
service “take-off”; (iii) reducing Ethiopia’s vulnerability to help improve prospects for 
sustainability; and (iv) fostering improved governance with continued emphasis on institutional 
capacity building to support the first three strategic objectives and citizens’ empowerment. 

Page 35 

 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the CAS CR rated the performance of the CAS program Moderately Satisfactory; CAS 
outcomes were fully achieved only under pillar three, “Reducing Vulnerability”; outcomes under 
all other pillars were rated as partially achieved. Box 3 provides a short description of successful 
and innovative projects during the CAS period. The CAS CR drew the following lessons 
applicable to the Bank’s program under the new CPS: 

CAS Focus 
 The Bank needs to find ways to engage more effectively with GoE in policy dialogue on 
macroeconomic and private and financial sector issues through increasing the relevance of 
the Bank’s economic and sector work, offering the Government a menu of instruments 
available from across the World Bank Group (including the International Finance 
Corporation 
(IFC) and Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA)) and 
strengthening partnerships. In this context, bridging the data and knowledge gap for 
evidence-based dialogue is key. 
 There is a need for a more comprehensive and sustainable solution for food security. Thus, 
while the Bank should continue to support and strengthen social protection systems and 
invest in disaster risk management programs, it should also strengthen its support to GoE to 
increase opportunities for on and off-farm employment (including by supporting private 
sector and agribusiness). 
 The Bank needs to more actively engage in improving the quality of basic services. A newly 
approved instrument – Program for Results – might provide a good opportunity to support 
this shift. 

CAS Design and Implementation 
 Monitoring the CAS results framework more regularly will help maintain realistic targets and 
flag deficiencies in outcome indicators. There should be better linkages between lending and 
non-lending instruments as well as with the indicators and the CAS outcomes. 
 The Bank should be ready to resume budget support under the new CPS as it provides an 
important forum for dialogue, enhances donor harmonization, and reduces transaction costs. 
Despite the successful shift in financing modalities from budget support to Provision of Basic 
Services Program (PBS) in reaction to the 2005 crisis, the benefits of budget support have not 
been fully replicated by PBS. 
 The CPS should promote scaling up of successful programmatic approaches as they leverage 
greater resources from partners, disburse faster, and have greater flexibility.  

94. 
The CPPR (FY09-mid FY12) focused on key cross-cutting implementation and fiduciary 
issues; examined the quality of the project results frameworks and monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) systems; and recommended specific short and medium-to-long-term actions to be 
implemented or initiated under the CPS.71 The following key cross-cutting and fiduciary issues 
were identified that affect the quality and riskiness of the Ethiopia portfolio: 

71 In addition, a separate consultancy has been commissioned out to evaluate application of safeguard policies 
(environmental and social) across the Ethiopia portfolio, but the results have not been finalized at the time of the 
CPS writing.

Cross-cutting issues 
 The most critical cross-cutting issue by far is the high and rapid staff turnover (including 
difficulties in attracting adequately skilled staff as well as their retention). It affecting the 
majority of projects in the Ethiopia portfolio and contributing to a slower than optimal pace 
of implementation and disbursements. This exacerbates already weak capacity at many levels 
of Government and across sectors, especially in the areas of financial management and 
procurement, but also in project management. 
 Low ownership, slow implementation and weak follow-up at regional level due to limited 
early-on involvement of the regional counterparts in project preparation, implementation and 
monitoring.72   
Insufficient sharing of knowledge and experience within the Bank, between the Bank and 
GoE and between project implementation agencies. 

 

Fiduciary risk in Bank projects 
 The fiduciary risk of the portfolio is “High”. The main reasons for these ratings, in addition 
to the cross-cutting issues identified above, arise from systemic weaknesses, the 
ineffectiveness of internal controls and internal audit, late financial reporting, inadequate 
capacity, significant unaccounted advances at various levels of implementation, long delays 
in bank reconciliations, insufficient controls over the usage of government property, 
excessive cash balances and lack of follow up on audit findings. The situation is further 
exacerbated by high staff turnover (over 25 percent on an annual basis at the woreda level), 
low fiduciary capacity and appointment of people to management positions without adequate 
financial management training. While the timeliness of reporting has improved, there are 
concerns regarding the quality of the information contained in these reports.  
In the area of procurement, in addition to a lack of staff with the right skills and experience at 
all levels, there are weaknesses in contract management capacity especially in the 
infrastructure sector (i.e., roads, power and water). Different and inconsistent procurement 
standards at the regions further increases the risk of misprocurement. The disconnect 
between the Work Plans and Procurement Plans results in ineffective procurement practices 
during implementation particularly at the Regional and woreda levels and delays in 
procurement actions.  

 

95. 
In addition, intensive consultations have been undertaken to gain a broad-based 
perspective on the Bank’s performance and future priorities. A Client Survey was conducted 
soliciting inputs from close to 330 respondents. Workshops and discussion foras have been 
organized in Addis Ababa as well as in four regions (Oromya, Tigray, Amhara and SNNP); face-
to-face consultations were organized with federal and regional government officials, private 
sector, CSOs, academia, sectoral and thematic associations and development partners; and a 
meeting with Ethiopian Diaspora was organized in Washington, DC. In addition, social media, 
including a dedicated online consultations facility and country office sites on Facebook and 

72 Bank projects under preparation are often mostly discussed at the federal level with MoFED with limited or 
minimal upfront consultation with regional stakeholders.  Such practice has created the perception that MoFED 
limits the role of regions and this has led to low ownership and affected their ability to effectively address project 
implementation concerns.   The weak implementation follow-up also evolved around the same problem of weak up-
front involvement by the region.

Twitter were used to reach out to those who were not able to take part in the face to face 
consultations. Over 830 people were able to provide their input online. Although the different 
stakeholders had various points of views, there were also areas of consensus, including:73 

i) The majority of stakeholders indicated that Ethiopia has made significant progress towards 
achieving the MDGs and that life in general had become better in the last five years. 
Nonetheless, the quality of services and quality of people’s lives has not kept pace. Both 
public officials as well as citizens at large underlined three reasons for an increasing gap 
between the quantity and quality of public services: (i) high and rapid staff turnover at all 
levels of government (federal, regional and woreda) coupled with the low capacity of public 
servants; (ii) limited space for private sector engagement resulting in over-reliance on public 
sector delivery, especially in the delivery of agriculture extension services but also, for 
example, the delivery of training; and (iii) significant gender inequalities hindering growth. 
Serious concerns also remain regarding macroeconomic stability, especially related to the 
eroding effects that high inflation has on people’s wealth and wellbeing. The majority of 
participants requested the Bank to undertake a thorough analysis of the issues and to engage 
with the Government in addressing them. 

ii) Role of the WBG. Participants perceived the Bank as an effective catalyst for discussion on 
critical issues related to poverty and growth, including the Bank’s role as a facilitator of 
discussions between the government and the private sector (e.g., though the Public-Private 
Dialogue Forum  (PPDF)); as well as a coordinator among development partners. There was 
a demand for the Bank to significantly increase its engagement with the private sector and on 
job creation (e.g., MSE agenda, access to finance, PPPs in agriculture and agribusiness, land 
management in selected regions) and governance (e.g., citizens’ empowerment and social 
accountability; regional and woreda PFM; strengthening legislative and judiciary branch of 
the government). Clearly, in addition to finance, the Bank brings a unique combination of 
analytical knowledge and round-the-world experience. However, knowledge creation is as 
important as its dissemination and both aspects should be strengthened going forward.  
Fostering learning and experience sharing should be promoted between Ethiopia and other 
countries as well as between regions. Finally, Bank could consider ways to facilitate flow of 
knowledge and finance from a large and diverse Ethiopian Diaspora.74 

iii) Demand for stronger partnership with the regions. The regions strongly advocated for a 
much closer partnership with the Bank going forward, not only during the preparation of the 
CPS but also during its implementation. WBG programs should leverage greater emphasis on 

73 Also, as part of CPS preparation two workshops have been organized to inform and enrich the design and 
implementation of the strategy: GAC in the CAS Workshop in May 2012 and Supporting Job Creation in Ethiopia 
Workshop in June 2012.  
74 There are two ongoing initiatives that aim to facilitate exchange of knowhow and finance from Diaspora: 
Ethiopian Diaspora Health and Education Professionals Mobilization project and IDF Strengthening Capacity for 
Mobilizing and Engaging the Ethiopian Diaspora.  Further, the WB Payment System Development Group is 
providing TA to the Universal Postal Union and the Ethiopian Postal Service under the African Institute for 
Remittances (AIR) project on the remittance system that connects post offices worldwide to process money 
transfers.

the regions’ specific development needs. Broadening the range of stakeholders to include 
non-government partners should be promoted. In this context, participants requested both 
GoE and development partners to recognize the role CSOs, NGOs and the private sector play 
in the development of Ethiopia and thus a need to create space and environment that would 
enable for a more meaningful and active partnership in the decision making process. 
Continuous support to PPDF was requested. 

Box 3: Selected projects under 2008-12 CAS 

Urban Local Government Development Project (ULGDP) – how empowered local governments and local communities can 
transform cities and generate local employment. ULGDP (IDA $300mln, effective since Nov 2008) supports improved 
performance in the planning, delivery and sustained provision of priority municipal services and infrastructure by urban local 
governments. The performance-based grant is having a transformative effect on 17 cities in which the project is implemented. For the 
first time, these cities have access to transparent, predictable funding, as long as they meet objective performance criteria. Citizen 
participation in investment planning has more than doubled in participating cities, and investment plans are now closely aligned with 
the expressed priorities of citizens.  Quality and timeliness of external audits has dramatically improved. The introduction of 
appropriate standards, particularly in the case of labor-intensive cobblestone road construction, has greatly improved access and 
drainage while also creating approximately 90,000 of jobs specifically targeted to the urban poor, including women and the disabled. 

The Agricultural Growth Program (AGP) – how partnerships can provide basis for strengthened, comprehensive and more 
harmonized support to agricultural growth.  The AGP (IDA$150mln, effective since March 2011) aims to increase agricultural 
productivity and market access in selected relatively high-potential woredas with particular focus on women and youth. This approach 
presents an important shift in thinking and support that complements the traditional (and still existing) focus of channeling most 
public investments, in particular from donor resources, to directly help the most food-insecure living in the most marginal areas.  
While it is too early to have measurable impacts in terms of AGP’s development objectives, the project has already realized several 
strategic objectives. First, the participatory planning approach ensures that farmers, in particular women and youth, determine the 
development of their communities and themselves. Second, the AGP as a multi-stakeholder program ensures that various government 
agencies and DPs, each contribute in a coordinated manner in line with their comparative advantage. As such, the AGP provides a 
framework for strengthened, comprehensive and more harmonized support to agricultural growth and a platform for policy 
discussions. In addition to creating linkages between agriculture, private sector and market development, AGP supports new 
institutional arrangements and private-public partnerships with the aim of integrating small farmers with high-value agricultural 
markets. 

The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) – how a flexible instrument can help mitigate the effects of natural disaster.  
PSNP (IDA$850mln under APL III) was launched in 2005 to complement the existing humanitarian support system and to assist 
chronically food insecure people in rural Ethiopia. The PSNP helps to reduce household vulnerability, improve resilience to shocks 
and promote sustainable community development in food insecure areas. To mitigate the risk of economic and climate related shocks 
the PSNP has adaptive measures such as soil and water conservation activities, small scale irrigation and integrated watershed 
management. In addition the program also supports the Public Work activities to build Social Infrastructure such as schools, health 
clinics and roads. The effects of the 2008 food crisis in the Horn of Africa have been mitigated in Ethiopia to a great extent by PSNP, 
which was able to scale up its support to those affected. Currently the project benefits more than 7.5 million. 

Road Sector Development Program (RSDP) – how consistent support over long-term to the government’s priority area can 
bring good results. In 1997, GoE formulated the 10-year Road Sector Development Program (RSDP 1997–2007), a two-phased 
integrated package of investments, reforms, and institutional reorganization. The program was later extended and is now in its fourth 
phase. The Bank has provided more than US$1.4 billion to the GoE to support its efforts in improving and expanding Ethiopia’s roads 
network. Currently, IDA$818mln is still committed under APL2, 3 and 4. Over the past fifteen years of implementation, the WB 
projects have helped Ethiopia to double its roads network from 26,550 km in 1997 to over 54,000 in 2011. The WB program has also 
helped in strengthening the institutional capacity of the institutions responsible for transport development in Ethiopia (e.g., the 
Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Urban Development and Construction) as well as institutions in charge of road sector 
development and maintenance (e.g., the Ethiopian Road Authority as well as roads authorities at the regional municipal and woreda 
level).

IV. New Partnership FY13-FY16 

A. Key Principles 

96. 
The CPS is strongly anchored within GoE’s GTP which has been under implementation 
since late 2010. Following the passing away of the Prime Minister in late August 2012, GoE 
reconfirmed its concurrence with the main thrust and focus of the CPS, which is strongly 
anchored in the GTP and has been developed through a highly consultative and collaborative 
process. Areas of World Bank Group (WBG) engagement have been selected based on their 
priority for the country and relevance for growth and poverty reduction as well as WBG’s 
comparative advantage reflected in the combination of partnerships, knowledge and finance.  
WBG engagement will be driven by a principle of partnering with GoE to look for pragmatic 
solutions.  The CPS uses GoE’s “transformational approach”; it builds on what has been 
achieved so far (by using existing knowledge and portfolio as well as cross-country good 
practice and experience) and continues its support in areas where there is strong government 
ownership (e.g., infrastructure and social protection). However, learning from the previous CAS 
and in order for the WBG to more effectively support GoE’s medium to long term development 
agenda there are several elements in the CPS that are new: 

i) More effective partnership with Government in three areas: (i) macroeconomic issues by 
gradually establishing a dedicated dialogue mechanism and providing financial support to 
support macroeconomic stability through budget support; (ii) the job creation agenda by 
offering, in collaboration with other development partners, a comprehensive package of 
possible solutions from IDA,75 IFC and MIGA as well as strengthening dialogue with the 
Government on regional integration issues; and (iii) improving the effectiveness of the 
Government, by assisting GoE to strengthen the human capacities of the civil sector and 
building country systems (including PFM and procurement).  

ii) Extending partnerships with non-state stakeholders. In addition to strengthening already 
good collaboration with the traditional donors, WBG will endeavor to reach out to non-
traditional partners, including sources of FDI. WBG will seek more active engagement with 
the regions though specific analytical work, closer engagement in portfolio management and 
building their capacities. Finally, more systematic ways of engaging with non-government 
partners will be pursued, including through the PPDF (Box 5). 

iii) Instruments. Learning from the results of the CAS CR, WBG will deploy to a larger extent 
its analytical work to inform its own as well as other partners’ work and to ensure that the 
dialogue with GoE is evidence-based. In this context the Bank will support capacity building 
of the Central Statistical Agency,76 to ensure better quality and reliability of data and M&E 
systems. Moreover, as soon as macroeconomic framework allows, the budget support agenda 
will be resumed (most likely starting with sectoral development policy lending and over time 
moving towards multi-sectoral Development Policy Operations (DPOs)) to deepen policy 
dialogue and support GoE’s focus on achieving macroeconomic  balance, fostering use of 

75 Including potential use of IDA guarantees. 
76 See Section F below for details.

country systems and increasing the predictability of aid.77 Finally, in line with GoE’s focus 
on quality of basic services, the Bank plans to gradually increase its utilization of the recently 
approved Program-for Results (PforR) instrument, commencing with the health and possibly 
education sector. WBG will strive to allow greater in-built flexibility into the program 
(lending and non-lending) so that it can be opportunistic and pragmatic in providing solutions 
to GoE. 

B. 

CPS Design: Pillars and Outcomes 

97. 
The CPS Pillars are consistent with the key focal areas of the GTP (i.e., supporting job 
creation in agriculture and industry; enhancing quality of social services; and increasing 
government effectiveness). 78 In line with the GTP, gender and climate change have been 
elevated to cross-cutting issues in the CPS and WBG will strengthen their mainstreaming into the 
portfolio. The CPS framework is also consistent with the World Bank Africa Strategy. Based on 
the existing project portfolio as well as the abovementioned CPS principles, the CPS will focus 
on achievement of the following key strategic objective under its main pillars.79 

98. 
Pillar One: Fostering competitiveness and employment by supporting a stable 
macroeconomic environment; increasing competitiveness and productivity; increasing and 
improving delivery of infrastructure; and enhancing regional integration.  Based on the key 
constraints analyzed in Chapter I, Section B and in Chapter II, Sections A and B, this pillar will 
focus on the following outcomes: 
 Supporting structural and macroeconomic policies to sustain internal and external balance 
and increase domestic resource mobilization; 
Increasing agriculture productivity and marketing in selected areas; 
Increasing competitiveness in manufacturing and services, and MSE access to financial 
services; 
Increasing access to and quality of infrastructure – electricity, roads, and water and 
sanitation; 
Improving regional integration by supporting the Eastern Africa Power Pool Mechanism 
and enhanced 
involvement 
in 
regional agriculture 
technology generation and 
dissemination. 



99. 
Pillar Two: Enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities by improving delivery 
of social services and developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk 
management. Based on the key constraints analyzed in Chapter II, Section C, this pillar will 
focus on the following outcomes: 
 
Increasing access to quality health and education services; 
 Enhancing the resilience of vulnerable households to food insecurity; 

77 The DAG Group in collaboration with the Government agreed to increase usage of country systems from the 
baseline of 52 percent in 2010 to 69 percent in 2014. Since many, especially bi-lateral, donors have limited scope for 
moving towards Chanel 1 disbursements (e.g., using country systems), greater burden will fall on multilateral 
institutions including the WBG. 
78 See Appendix 2 for CPS results chain. 
79 Appendix 2 provides a result chain for translating GTP into CPS framework.

 
Increasing adoption of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) systems; 
 Strengthening sustainable natural resource management and resilience to climate change. 

100. Foundation: Good governance and state building. Based on the key constraints 
analyzed in Chapter II, Section D, this foundation would focus on the following outcomes: 
 
Improving public service performance management and responsiveness; 
 Enhancing space for citizen participation in the development process; 
 Enhancing public financial management, procurement, transparency and accountability. 

101. Cross-cutting themes in CPS. Gender will continued to be mainstreamed in the WBG 
program through including activities focused on women in the design of projects (e.g.,  AGP, 
ULGDP: Box 3) as well as through individual projects focused on women (e.g., WDEP: Box 
4).80  WBG will build on the experiences from WEDP and the emerging research to further 
support growth-oriented women MSE owners. WBG will also intensify its Analytical and 
Advisory Activities (AAA) to create (to the extent possible) a full gender disaggregated poverty 
profile for Ethiopia. A series of gender-focused policy notes will be prepared based on research 
to: evaluate policies supporting female income generation; assess the effects (on school children) 
after including a module on the basic gender rights and responsibilities in their school 
curriculum; analyze constraints to access to justice of the poor and vulnerable groups (a follow-
up to the study on the effectiveness of "domestic violence preventive actions" undertaken in 
FY12).  

Box 4: The Women Entrepreneurship Development Program – unleashing the growth potential of urban 
women entrepreneurs 

Recognizing the large economic potential of promoting female entrepreneurship, since May 2012 the Government is 
implementing an IDA funded ($50m) Women Entrepreneurship Development Program (WEDP), which aims to address the 
two most severe constraints to business growth as reported by growth-oriented women-owned MSEs: lack of access to 
finance and of entrepreneurial and technical skills together with usage of low-productivity technologies. Through provision 
of microfinance loans and other suitable financial instruments through MFIs to individual growth-oriented women 
entrepreneurs, WEDP aims to provide at least 17 thousand loans over the 5 year. MFIs will benefit from a substantial 
Technical Assistance (TA) to build their capacity to provide tailored financial products to female entrepreneurs. WEDP is 
expected to deliver entrepreneurship skills enhancement to 20 thousand women entrepreneurs, together with technology 
diffusion and cluster development where growth-oriented women entrepreneurs will get training and support in most basic 
aspects of developing, running and growing a business. 

In addition to being a key element in the gender strategy of the Bank in Ethiopia, WEDP also serves as an entry point for 
discussing private sector policies concerning the country’s MSE segment, which is the most important source of employment 
outside of agriculture. To contribute to the future policy dialogue, WEDP has a built-in impact evaluation that is designed to 
measure the exact number of jobs created by the program and by different sub-components. The WEDP thus complements 
the Bank’s efforts in the job creation agenda including regulatory concerns, business climate knowledge work and the 
overarching policy framework including macro policies by providing evidence on employment creation. 

102. WBG considers climate change as an important part of the development process. 
Therefore, a focus on climate change will be mainstreamed into ongoing and future operations to 
make them more “climate-smart.”81 Consequently, WBG will (i) support key sectors of crucial 
importance to climate change (e.g., agricultural and pastoral development, sustainable land 

80 See Appendix 5 for details. 
81 See Appendix 7 for details on mainstreaming the Climate Change agenda into the Ethiopia portfolio.

management and food security, and renewable energy); (ii) engage in specific studies and trials 
under ongoing or future projects and programs with the aim to modify their design for an 
increased climate change impact; (iii) strengthen the systematic and enhanced treatment of 
climate impacts at the strategic level building on the IDA16 framework currently under 
development, and based on selected case studies; and (iv) through its engagement with line 
agencies, WBG will support the development of the Government’s Climate Resilient Strategy. 
Finally, WBG will continue engaging in few climate change-specific tasks such as climate 
information systems or other specific AAA products or supporting the agenda on Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.  

C. 

Existing Portfolio and New Program 

103. Existing Portfolio. Much of what the WBG will achieve during the CPS will depend on 
the existing portfolio. As of July 1, 2012 (i.e., the start of the CPS, see Annex 9) the Bank had 25 
active IDA-only projects in Ethiopia (two regional), of which 6 were added in FY12 (including 3 
additional financing and one regional) for a total of US$1.12 billion. Twelve projects were co-
financed with other development partners.  Total IDA commitments were US$5.1 billion (the 
second highest in the Africa Region) and an undisbursed balance of US$2.26 billion.  The 
disbursement ratio in FY12 was 34.2 percent with disbursements amounting to US$727.6 
million. Close to a half of the active IDA Portfolio supports infrastructure development (48 
percent), mostly roads and electricity; there are two programs in social protection (PSNP and 
PBS) which account for 39 percent of total commitments; and the remainder is distributed among 
projects supporting private sector and finance, agriculture and public sector capacity building 
and governance (2, 7 and 9 percent respectively). The existing portfolio is relatively well aligned 
with the CPS strategic objectives (Table 6). Commitments at risk accounted for 10 percent of the 
total portfolio (less than half of the average in the Africa Region) and two projects (Tourism and 
Tana & Beles) were rated marginally unsatisfactory for Implementation Progress and 
Development Objectives (suspension for the Tourism project was lifted in July 2012). However, 
the Realism Index for Ethiopia, as determined by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), stood 
at 40 percent, which is well below that for the World Bank and the Africa Region . The Country 
Team is working jointly with GoE to address this issue through, inter alia, more systematic and 
regular joint reviews of the portfolio and implementation issues arising.

104. New Lending. The total volume of lending is based on Ethiopia’s IDA allocation, which 
is determined annually by the Country Performance Rating (CPR) that takes into account the 
country’s policy performance and governance environment (as measured by the Country Policy 
and Institutional Assessment – CPIA) and the performance of existing IDA portfolio. Although 
over the past few years Ethiopia’s CPR has been relatively stable (e.g., between 3.35 in 2006 to 
3.37 in 2011), its provisional IDA16 allocation of US$3.38 billion (e.g., US$1.1bn per year) is 
close to 28 percent higher than IDA15 allocation due to the increased overall size of IDA16.82 

82 IDA15 covered period of FY09-11; IDA16 covers FY12-14 and IDA17 will cover FY15-17. IDA resource 
envelopes are provided for 3-year replenishment cycles. The FY13 allocation for Ethiopia of Special Drawing 
Rights SDR759.2 million (equivalent of US$1.2bn) is firm while the FY14 allocation of SDR 664.5mln (US$1.1bn) 
is indicative and can change depending on: (i) total IDA resources available in the respective fiscal year; (ii) 
Ethiopia’s performance rating; (iii) the terms of IDA's assistance to the country (grants or credits) in the respective 
fiscal year based on Ethiopia’s debt sustainability position; (iv) MDRI debt relief and the redistribution of the MDRI 
compensatory resources as applicable; (v) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; and (vi) 
the number of IDA-eligible countries. Note that Ethiopia’s IDA envelope was provided in SDR terms, and the US 
dollar equivalent amounts are converted using the IDA16 replenishment rate of 1SDR=US$1.50233; however, the 
exchange rate for each IDA operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of project approval.

The CPS will span the last two years of IDA16 (FY13-14) and the first two years of IDA17 
(FY15-16). In FY12 Ethiopia’s new commitments amounted to US$1.12 billion.83 The lending 
program for the first two years of CPS (FY13-14) has been designed with a buffer of about 19 
percent (US$1.5bn in FY13 and US$1.2bn in FY14). Given that the IDA allocation for the two 
outer years of CPS (FY15-16) is not available, the CPS program is indicative and will be 
reconfirmed based on the IDA17 allocation and discussions with the Government.  

105. Lending selectivity and focus. The focus of the new lending program for the CPS period 
relative to the CPS strategic objectives is presented in Table 6.  Ethiopia’s new lending will most 
likely remain heavily focused on infrastructure for two main reasons: (i) the Government 
perceives IDA to bring high value addition in infrastructure sectors; and (ii) large part of IDA 
support is provided through APLs (e.g., roads and water) or supporting multi-year Government 
programs (e.g., energy). A key constraint affecting selectivity is an expectation (especially from 
the donor community) for the Bank to engage more actively in the areas of macroeconomic 

83 This includes an additional US$70 million from the IDA Crisis Response Window for the PSNP Additional 
Financing as well as the Regional Eastern Africa Power Pool Project (APL1) presented to the Board in July 2012.

development, private and financial sector support and public sector capacity building. Regarding 
social sectors, although they attract more than a quarter of overall Official Development 
Assistance ODA (2008-10, Development Assistance Group (DAG) data), there is an expectation 
for the Bank to stay engaged in these areas to provide a coordinating role even if WBG financing 
is declining (e.g., education). While acknowledging the constraints, the Country Team will 
maintain its good track record on selectivity84 by opening up the budget support agenda (starting 
most likely with sectoral DPOs), utilizing additional financing for successful projects, and 
seeking opportunities for portfolio consolidation. 

106. Addressing fiduciary risks in country portfolio. The CPPR provided several specific 
recommendations on how to alleviate some fiduciary concerns. While some of the proposed 
actions will require high-level interventions,85 many can be undertaken at the technical level and 
within the CPS period.86 The Bank will address fiduciary risks through a multi-annual program 
of fiduciary analytical work aimed at strengthening the policy dialogue in financial management 
and procurement sectors (particularly at the regional level) and raising general awareness. This 
program will consist of (i) Bi-annual federal level PEFA and Country Procurement Assessment 
Report (CPAR); (ii) Regional level PEFA and financial management Economic Sector Work 
(ESW) as required; (iii) policy notes on specific areas of interest to the Government; and (iv) 
Accounting and Auditing Report On The Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) updates. 
These analytical products will be conducted in close coordination with other donors and GoE 
among all relevant sectors. To complement this program, management is implementing a series 
of regular meetings with GoE, and internal measures to ensure more effective portfolio 
monitoring and evaluation. Finally, GAC filters will be introduced for all projects in the pipeline 
for FY14.  

107. Addressing safeguards risks in the country portfolio.  The ambition of the GTP 
targets, particularly for large-scale infrastructure and other initiatives such as large-scale 
agriculture development which may require significant land-use change, present environmental 
and social risks.  At the same time, there is limited capacity in government at all levels (e.g., 
national, regional and local) to manage effectively such risks, and this limited capacity is further 
undermined by the high rate of staff turnover in the civil service. While legally the 
Environmental Protection Agency (or the Regional Environmental Authorities for small, local 
projects) is responsible for review and clearance of assessments of potential environment and 
social impacts of proposed projects, in practice this role has been delegated to sector agencies, 
such as the Ministry of Agriculture, EEPCO and ERA. Moreover, quality review of environment 

84 During the CAS period (FY09-11), the number of projects in the Ethiopia portfolio has decreased from 31 to 26 
despite net commitments growing by US$800 million. As a result, the size of the new projects approved during this 
period has increased reaching on average US$234 million.   
85 For example, civil service reform, more active and early-on engagement of the regions, agreement with MoFED 
and implementing agencies to start advanced procurement prior to WB loan approval. 
86 For example, provision of regular (bi-annually or quarterly) training/FM and procurement clinics for PIU staff as 
well as dedicated institutions (e.g., the Public Procurement Agency) in the areas of procurement, FM and 
safeguards; establishment of Managers Network (PSCAP), Sectoral Groups and Finance Managers Club for 
information and experience sharing; more consistent and rigorous application of Bank’s readiness filters to projects 
under preparation; standardization of the FM Manuals; simplification of reporting at local level; development of 
service delivery standards; piloting join preparation of Annual Work Plans, Annual budgets and Procurement Plans.

and social safeguards for a proposal is undertaken more consistently if the proposal involves 
donor financing. The Bank will take a two-pronged approach to address the related risk. First, to 
ensure consistency of application and compliance with Bank safeguard policies, a high-level 
policy dialogue on safeguards issues will be continued and the supervision of environmental and 
social safeguards implementation in Bank financed projects will be further strengthened.87  This 
strengthening will be complemented by additional training from the Bank for environmental and 
social safeguards specialists and consultants, dissemination of resource materials on 
environmental and social due diligence, and other broader capacity-building activities aimed at 
building up expertise on environmental and social management. Second, the capacity of the 
government system for environment and social safeguards implementation will be strengthened 
in key sector agencies, such as EEPCO and ERA, through project components which focus on 
the modernization of these agencies (see paragraph 69 on EEPCO), as well as broad-based 
training on safeguards for these and other agencies.  

108. Use of Country Systems (Channel 1 and 2). Ethiopia uses a number of alternative 
mechanisms for channeling donor funds to spending units in the country.88 A recent review of 
the Use of Country Systems by donors in Ethiopia confirmed that around 67 percent of World 
Bank support is channeled through government systems, which is higher than the target set for 
all donors in Ethiopia for the next reporting period. CPPR review has confirmed that World Bank 
funds disbursing through Channel 1 (e.g., PBS and PSNP) have an average disbursement rate of 
30 percent compared to 15 percent for Channel 2 projects (traditional Specific Investment 
Lending). Consequently, during the CPS period, the World Bank will be proactively exploring 
ways to moving its portfolio towards Chanel 1 (for example though increasing use of DPO and 
PforR instruments). A systemic assessment for this is underway which involves analyzing the 
quality of country PFM systems with a specific focus on risks and the mitigation measures that 
need to be put in place. While there is clearly commitment to improving PFM systems in 
Ethiopia the approach has been fragmented and there is a need for addressing the major 
weaknesses identified in various diagnostics at different levels of government if donors are to 

87 A particular risk arises because the Bank's Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) has not been 
applied in Ethiopia, in part because of GoE concerns, but also because of uncertainty as to its compatibility with the 
country context. To address the situation, discussions with GoE on how to apply the policy have been ongoing since 
mid-2009. To enhance GoE familiarity with the policy, a joint World Bank-GoE workshop was held in early March 
2011. GoE remains uncomfortable with the policy’s potential application in Ethiopia and progress has been slow in 
reaching a joint understanding. The issue was again discussed with the Ethiopian Delegation at the 2011 Annual 
Meetings, following which Bank management sent a letter to GoE with a proposal which remains under discussion. 
At the 2012 Spring Meetings the GoE delegation reiterated its difficulties with the policy, but noted the need for 
GoE and the Bank to jointly resolve this issue. Since February 2012, a note appearing in the MOP of each Board 
package for Ethiopia has summarized the situation as: (a) dialogue between GoE and the Bank on OP 4.10 is 
ongoing, (b) when agreement is reached, but in any event starting with operations considered by the Board after 
December 2012, the policy would be applied to the extent that it is found to be relevant to the areas of operation of 
the proposed projects; and (c) relevant operations presented to the Board in the meantime will endeavor to contain 
features that approach functional equivalence with the policy even when it is not formally triggered.  In lieu of 
agreement with GoE on application of OP 4.10, in some projects, task teams have been able to achieve much of the 
intent of OP 4.10 without triggering the policy (through the Environmental Assessment or Involuntary Resettlement 
policies and procedures). 
88 The most common are Channel 1a – viz. full use of government systems across all levels of Government though 
MoFED; Channel 1b which uses Government systems only at the Federal level and Channel 2 viz. project aid that 
bypasses MoFED and goes directly to a sector or a government entity at the sub national level.

increasingly move to country systems. The Bank will also work with GoE to increase the use of 
country procurement systems.  

109. Non-lending assistance. As clearly indicated by the CAS CR and feedback from the 
Client Survey and multi-stakeholders consultations, the Bank needs to ramp-up its knowledge 
products (including analytical, advisory and technical assistance) especially in terms of its 
relevance and timeliness. Non-lending assistance can take a variety of forms, including standard 
Economic Sector Work (ESW), study tours, facilitation of knowledge and experience sharing 
between Ethiopia and other countries (e.g., Rwanda, which shares a similar development 
strategy), informal brainstorming, just-in-time studies and regular updates/policy notes. In 
determining the focus of future non-lending assistance priority will be given according to three 
criteria: (i) part of the core country diagnostics that needed regular updates; (ii) on-demand 
policy notes to aid the Government’s policy making discussions; and (iii) covering innovative or 
difficult areas of development. In addition, WBG will strive to engage more actively with the

GoE as well as local think tanks and academia in the process of designing and conducting the 
analytical work. Table 8 provides some of the major non-lending activities (ESW and TA) 
planned during the CPS period; for a complete list see Annex 11.  

110. Ethiopia Trust Funds (TFs) portfolio is one of the largest in the Africa Region with 
US$642 million in commitments allocated in 68 TFs as of June 1, 2012.89 Recipient-executed 
TFs account for 38 percent of the total number of active TFs and 95 percent of the total 
commitments. Two donors, UK and EU, provide almost three quarters of total contributions (61 
and 12 percent respectively). Ethiopia TF portfolio is well aligned with the WB program with a 
clear focus on social sectors: at the beginning of the CPS period, 86 percent of TF portfolio was 
contributing to CPS Pillar 2 (resilience and vulnerability) and 13 percent to Pillar 1 
(competitiveness and employment). Further, more than a half of all TF commitments (52 
percent) were co-financing one multi-donor education project (GEQIP); another 17 percent of TF 
supported water and sanitation sector, 13 percent went to support social sectors (PBS and PSNP) 
and 10 percent went to agriculture. 

111. While TFs are relatively well aligned with CPS objectives, there is still a need to shift 
towards a more programmatic and less fragmented trust fund portfolio. The average size of a 
grant under a Bank-Executed trust fund was US$774,000; however close to a half of such grants 
were smaller than US$250,000. Recipient-Executed trust funds tend to be larger in size 
(US$24million on average) particularly those associated with the education, PBS and PSNP 
operations. Ethiopia also has a large portfolio of Financial Intermediary Funds (FIFs), where the 
Bank only acts as a trustee and transfers funds to implementing agencies outside the Bank. The 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)90, the largest FIF in the Bank, 
had Ethiopia as its largest beneficiary in FY10.  

D. 

IFC and MIGA Programs 

112. 
IFC Program. IFC has been “open for business” in Ethiopia since 2008 and its program 
supports particularly the first pillar of this strategy with a focus on three areas: (i) project 
development in key strategic sectors (e.g., agribusiness, infrastructure, financial services, tourism 
and manufacturing); (ii) removal of 
investment climate constraints; and (iii) building 
entrepreneurial capacity. Since FY08, IFC has committed a total of US$83.6 million including 
investments in the Ethio Cement project that helped to establish a green-field integrated cement 
plant; equity investment in the Saudi German Hospitals Group, which will construct a hospital in 
Addis Ababa, the Group’s first venture in Africa; equity investment in Nyota Minerals Ltd for its 
Tulu Kapi Gold to support gold exploration and in Allana Potash to help explore potash reserves; 
and the Ethiopian Coffee projects (with TechnoServe) that provide financing to specialty coffee 
farmer cooperatives under the Ethiopian component of the East Africa Coffee Initiative . IFC’s 
advisory services provide support to improve the investment climate, encourage entrepreneurs, 

89 See Annex 12 for portfolio of active TF. Calculations exclude HIPC TFs. 
90 In addition to the GFATM, Ethiopia is a major recipient of other FIFs such as the Consultative Group on 
International Agricultural (CGIAR), the Climate Investment Fund, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and 
Immunization (GAVI), the Global Agriculture & Food Security Program (GAFSP), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and 
the Least Developed Countries Fund for Climate Change (LDCF).

and promote better access to finance, especially SMEs. Establishing the Public Private Dialogue 
Forum and Warehouse Receipts Finance Program are among the most noteworthy IFC 
engagement to improve Ethiopia’s investment climate (Box 5).  

113. 
In the coming years IFC’s portfolio is expected to grow with a particular focus on 
opportunities in power, mining, manufacturing and tourism: 

 

 

IFC in collaboration with the WB and potentially other donors is focusing on the 
development of geothermal resources in Ethiopia starting with exploring the possibilities for 
establishing a geothermal development fund. 
 As part of its engagement in the mining sector, IFC will work with other parts of WBG to 
assist GoE in modernizing Ethiopia’s mining regulatory framework and raising investor 
interest in the Ethiopian mining sector.  
IFC is strongly interested in assisting GoE in development of industrial zones. IFC China and 
Ethiopia Offices are actively engaged in developing a structure under which IFC could invest 
in the companies that setup operations in the Ethiopia Industrial Zone in coordination with 
China Africa Development Fund (CAD Fund). 
IFC is keen to help Ethiopia to realize its potential as a significant tourism destination (Box 
2). 

 

Box 5: IFC initiatives to improve business environment in Ethiopia 

Warehouse Receipts (WHR) Finance Program: IFC partnered with the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) and 
selected Ethiopian commercial banks to develop Warehouse Receipts Finance markets in Ethiopia, through a combination 
of advisory services and investments package.  The program is funded by IFC (US$1mln) and four other partners from 
Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Japan (US$2.5mln). Under the investment component, up to US$10 million of financing 
is allocated to the participating banks in the form of guarantees (risk-sharing) or short-term lines of credit (co-financing) on 
their WHR lending portfolio of up to US$20 million. IFC has committed its first WHR finance facilities in March 2011 to 
the United Bank and NIB Bank. WHR-based loans (covering mostly sesame and pea beans) grew to US$1.5 million in 
FY11 from US$50,000 in FY10. This amount is expected to grow to US$ 6million by the end of the current harvest season.  
The advisory service component is also progressing well and ECX is now ready to launch the program with the United 
Bank and CBE.  

Ethiopia Public Private Dialogue Forum (PPDF): On July 8th 2010, GOE, the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and 
Sectoral Associations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to guide the PPDF. The first PPDF meeting was organized 
on February 22, 2011 bringing together representatives of the private sector and the Government in a structured dialogue to 
discuss and ultimately address key obstacles to firms’ growth and competiveness as well as to establish mutual trust and 
understanding between the public and private sector. So far the Forum has facilitated improvements in tax and trade 
logistics legislations. IFC jointly with UNDP have been instrumental in helping structure and lead this process and the two 
institutions have recently agreed to fund the first year of the PPD process at the federal level for a total of US$650,000.  

114. The pipeline of IFC knowledge-based activities includes ramping up its support to GoE 
to improve the country’s business environment. In addition to continued support to the PPDF, the 
program would focus on simplification of business registration and tax administration, 
supporting industry specific investment climate reforms (including investment policy and 
promotion), and trade logistics. There are ongoing discussions in developing IFC’s Global Trade 
Finance Program as well as potential support that IFC could provide to the development of 
Alternative Dispute Resolution as a means to alleviate the burden on the court system and 
improve speedy, amicable resolution of commercial disputes. Finally, there is an ongoing 
process under the Access Leasing project, where IFC would provide a combination of equity 

Page 50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
investments and advisory services to establish the first leasing company in the country, 
sponsored by Access Capital. 

115. MIGA Program. MIGA is also supporting the objectives of pillar one, and is currently 
insuring three projects in Ethiopia (two in agribusiness and one in cement) with total net 
exposure of US$16.8 million (see Annex 10). The first agribusiness project supports an 
investment by Africa Juice BV of the Netherlands which, in Africa, is represented by Juice 
Tibila Share Company.  Africa Juice Tibila Share Company is a producer and exporter of 
tropical fruit juices. The second agribusiness project involves the privatization, rehabilitation, 
and expansion of an existing farm which will result in a 600 hectare plantation of yellow passion 
fruit, an additional 600 hectares of other tropical fruits such as mango and papaya, and the 
construction of a new fruit-processing facility. The manufacturing project supports a minority 
equity investment by Schulze Global Investments (SGI) into the National Cement Share 
Company of Ethiopia (NCSC). The investment by SGI will help NCSC to expand its opera tions 
in Dire Dawa, through supporting the construction of a new 3,000 tpd clinker plant. In order to 
accelerate the construction of the new plant, NCSC engaged SGI for a round of equity financing. 
The expansion of the plant is expected to result in additional significant tax revenue to the 
government and the creation of up to 600 new local jobs directly, and potentially an additional 
2,500 indirect jobs. It will also provide an increased supply of domestic cement to meet the 
growing demand in Ethiopia, thereby reducing the country’s reliance on expensive imports and 
reducing the drain on foreign exchange reserves. 

116. 
In addition, MIGA remains open for business in Ethiopia across all of its Political Risk 
Insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract and 
War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations.  MIGA has 
also made use of its more streamlined Small Investment Product (SIP) where more streamlined 
procedures have allowed smaller projects to be supported. 

E. 

Partnerships 

117. Official Development Assistance to Ethiopia has been growing fast over the last decade, 
more than quadrupling from US$ 0.7 billion in 2000 to US$2.9 billion in 2009, before declining 
to US$2.6 billion in 2010.91 Although there has been a significant proliferation of donors (from 
25 in 2006 to about 36 in 2010, including non-traditional donors), the US and IDA accounted for 
close to a half of all ODA disbursements, followed by the UK, EU, Global Fund and AfDB.  
Nonetheless, aid to Ethiopia has a strong multilateral dimension as almost 80 percent of ODA 
(2011) is administered through multilateral institutions from own resources or through multi-
donor arrangements (MDTFs). Non-traditional donors92 are increasing their presence with new 
modalities of development finance linked to specific trade and investments deals. Over a third of 
ODA received by Ethiopia is humanitarian assistance over which GoE has little influence (most 
is delivered through multilaterals and NGO, less than 10 percent through GoE). Support to 

91 Appendix 8 provides detailed donor mapping. 
92 Non-traditional donors in Ethiopia include private donors such as Bill and Melinda Foundation, donors from 
China, India, Arab countries, and Global Programs, among others.  

Page 51 

 
 
 
 
                                                            
infrastructure accounts for 11 percent of total ODA (6 percent excluding IDA) and to the private 
sector (including agriculture and finance) for 8 percent (5 percent excluding IDA).  

118. Donor collaboration in Ethiopia has a long track record. It includes a High Level Forum 
with GoE, several joint donor: GoE Sector and Technical Working Groups (SWGs, TWGs), 
some of which work more effectively than others, with a direct correlation with a functioning 
funding mechanism (see Appendix 8 for dialogue structure between the GoE and Development 
Partners (DPs)). Currently there are ongoing discussions between GoE and development partners 
on the overall dialogue structure including finalization of the ToRs for the main SWGs, 
definition of common operational procedures, reporting lines and links among SWGs, with 
funding programmes and task forces. Recently there has been a renewed interest in the Aid 
Management Platform (AMP) as a management and M&E tool. 

119. Out of 25 IDA projects in Ethiopia portfolio at the start of the CPS, 12 were co-financed 
with other donors, including the two largest IDA programs (PBS and PSNP) as well as AGP, 
GEQIP, PSCAP, WASH and WDEP. A recent quantitative data assessment of Ethiopia´s 
compliance with the Paris Declaration principles on aid effectiveness concluded that many of 
IDA projects were in compliance with the Paris Declaration principles of aid effectiveness and 
showing significant progress over the years in areas such as coordinated technical cooperation, 
use of country systems, and untying aid. 93 Going forward, the Bank will continue with the 
practice of joint financing of projects wherever possible; resuming the budget support agenda 
would also assist in increased donor collaboration as well as use of country systems.  In addition 
to strengthening already good collaboration with the traditional donors, the WBG will endeavor 
to pursue co-financing opportunities with non-traditional partners; seek more active engagement 
with the regions as well as with non-government partners. 

F. 

Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation 

120. The CPS Results Framework (CPS RF) presents the priorities of the Bank in 
Ethiopia in alignment with the strategic goals of Ethiopia, and was developed in 
collaboration with GoE and Development Partners. The CPS RF (Appendix 3) uses 
Ethiopia’s GTP as its starting point, and narrows down the range of outcomes to those that the 
Bank intend to influence directly through its interventions over the CPS period. GoE, 
development partners, and other stakeholders provided detailed inputs that were incorporated 
into the CPS RF.  In addition, the CPS outcomes are aligned with the sector strategies for the 
country. The CPS RF illustrates the overarching national goals from the GTP to which the CPS 
outcomes, milestones, and related interventions seek to contribute.  As mentioned before, the 
results targets during the CPS period will be largely achieved with the program already under 
implementation  

121. To the extent possible, the CPS M&E system will be linked with national M&E 
systems.  The GTP requires a comprehensive M&E system to collect data to track its progress 
and report results.  Hence, the CPS M&E system will focus on complementing and enhancing 
the government’s results management capacities.  Toward that end, the Bank in developing the 

93 Aid Effectiveness: Ethiopia, MoFED 2012

CPS M&E system, will work to increase demand for M&E information at national, regional, and 
local levels through linking planning, budgeting, and reporting with results. It will work towards 
strengthening M&E and national statistical systems through improvement of data quality for 
basic service sectors and by supporting specific M&E studies and surveys.94  

122. Efforts will continue to strengthen Ethiopia statistical capacity, which is a key to 
ensuring availability and timeliness of quality data to monitor high-level country outcomes and 
producing the national accounts statistics. The capacity challenges will primarily be addressed 
through TA programs to address gaps in national and sub-national statistical capacities, including 
though ongoing collaboration between the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia and the World 
Bank Living Standards Measurement Study team (LSMS) on the Ethiopia Rural Socioeconomic 
Survey.95 Recently, GoE has requested assistance from the WB Statistics for Results Facility 
(SRF) – Catalytic Fund. The Ethiopian SRF is expected to support the implementation of 
National Strategy for Development of Statistics (2019/10-2013/14) through, inter alia, 
infrastructure capacity development at the CSA and key Ministries;  data development and 
management; methodological research and analysis; information dissemination; and M&E 
capacity building.96 

123. To develop a results-oriented M&E system for the Ethiopia CPS, the new Results 
Integration and Management System (RIMsys) tool, developed by the World Bank, will be 
used to systematically capture and consolidate information on CPS targeted results and monitor 
the progress toward their achievement.  The key feature of the RIMsys includes the ability to link 
the performance of Bank operations and the achievement of CPS results.  In addition, the tool 
produces portfolio management and results reports on a periodic basis. A CPS progress report 
will be prepared in FY14, or earlier if needed, to report on progress toward CPS outcomes and 
adjust the strategy and program if necessary and update the results framework.  

G. Managing Risks  

124. Ethiopia faces a range of external and internal risks, the potential impacts of which can be 
mitigated in part by WBG. Other risks may not be susceptible of mitigation but WBG 
nevertheless needs to be aware of them so that we can respond appropriately to the extent that 
the risk arises. 

125. Ethiopia is vulnerable to external economic shocks, including the negative economic 
impact from a protracted slowdown in the EU and other high income economies, as well as 
natural disasters.  A slowdown of remittances, standing at around 9 percent of GDP, could 
reduce domestic consumption, one of the main drivers of recent growth. The high concentration 
of exports in commodity and primary goods and the significant share of exports going to OECD 

94 E.g., the Bank will supporting the Woreda and City benchmarking survey for monitoring local developments in 
local governance.   
95 This work program is a multi-year program that encompasses the design and implementation of a household 
survey integrated with the Agricultural Sample Survey, a panel component of this new survey, capacity building and 
cross-country knowledge sharing, and efforts to improve survey methodologies. 
96 Statistical capacity building is also supported by DFID, Gates-Melinda Foundation, UN and Irish Aid.

countries also pose a risk. And the recent spike in global food prices is also a cause for concern. 
A strong and resilient framework of macroeconomic policies can help GoE manage for such a 
risk, and WBG can assist GoE in the context of the proposed stronger engagement on such 
issues, and possible development policy lending. 

126. There 
is a potential trade-off between economic growth and overall debt 
sustainability. This is particularly important in a state-led development model which relies on 
large public investment (double digits, above 20 percent in terms of GDP) in an environment of 
low levels of domestic savings (single digits in terms of GDP). The gap will, to a large extent, be 
shouldered through the accumulation of debt (domestic and external). Given the authorities' 
intention to keep to a low risk of external debt distress, the amount of non-concessional 
borrowing will be limited. So there may be a trade-off between the low risk rating desired by 
GoE and the implementation pace of the GTP, which may require lengthening of the GTP 
implementation period to smoothen the non-concessional financing requirements for the planned 
investments. This may have growth implications for the economy at large, given the large role of 
investment in GDP expansion at the moments. WBG has already expressed a view about this 
risk, in the context of the IDA-IMF staff Joint Advisory Note on the GTP. In terms of managing 
for this risk WBG needs to ensure the implementation schedules for operations are robust and 
allow for such fluctuations in the overall pace of public investment in Ethiopia. 

127. For a number of years Ethiopia has been perceived as having a culture that inhibits 
corruption and levels of corruption have been thought to be significantly lower than for its 
regional comparators. However, worldwide experience shows that even countries with such a 
culture face increasing challenges when rapid economic growth is coupled with significant 
government intervention in the management of the economy. This combination can feed the 
emergence of unhealthy relationships between politicians and bureaucrats on the one hand, and 
entrepreneurs and investors on the other. Experience also shows that the discipline that comes 
with a vibrant private sector can help mitigate this risk. Achieving a balanced equilibrium along 
these lines will apply to relations both with the domestic private sector, and with foreign 
investors. Accountability and transparency in the oversight of FDI will be just as important as in 
the domestic sector, if the developmental benefits of entrepreneurialism – including those 
associated with broad-based growth and job creation – are to be maximized. WBG lending and 
non-lending assistance on fostering competitiveness and employment will offer help to GoE in 
striking this balance correctly, while the strong foundation of the WBG program in good 
governance should minimize the risk that WBG operations are exposed to risks from economic 
capture. 

128. Natural disasters, of which droughts have been the most frequent occurrence in 
Ethiopia, may cause serious setbacks to economic advancements and jeopardize achievements in 
reducing poverty and vulnerability of Ethiopian poor. As the impact of climate change is 
increasingly felt in Ethiopia, the economic effects of such events are likely to grow. However, 
growth and diversification of the Ethiopian economy (supported under Pillar 1) together with a 
range of interventions supported under Pillar 2 will help to increase the resilience and decrease 
the vulnerability of Ethiopian people and thus help mitigate or manage this risk. 

Page 54 

 
 
 
 
 
129. An essential building block of Government’s vision of economic and social 
transformation is a capable public service at all levels of government (at federal, regional, 
woreda level, and increasingly in kebeles).  A public service which is appropriately capaci tated 
to take forward service delivery of appropriate quality, whilst ensuring universal access, is 
fundamental to the change processes at the heart of government’s agenda of fighting poverty. 
That this public service acts with integrity is also critical, particularly given that the development 
of formal processes of checks and balances is still very much work in progress. There is a risk, 
however, that capacity development and probity of the public service may not be able to 
keep pace with the broader reform agenda. High turn-over within the public service and the 
expansion of the number of woredas will exacerbate this challenge. The risk of the potentials of 
inadequate capacity is one which has been identified by Government itself, and it has invested 
much effort already in building capacity and local leadership. The foundation of our CPS and the 
proposed lending and non-lending activities, including those supporting work on safeguards (see 
paragraph 107) are designed to provide the support to GoE to help them manage this risk. 

130. The following are risks of which WBG needs to be aware, but for which the main 
available mitigation available is likely to be close participation in the arrangements for 
coordinating development partners in Ethiopia. These are: 

 Regional security risks. Relations with Eritrea have been problematic, including localized 
tension along the border. The ongoing tensions between Sudan and South Sudan also present 
challenges; whilst Ethiopia is seen as an ‘honest broker’ by both sides, conflict between the 
governments in Khartoum and Juba, have the tendency to spill over into Ethiopia’s borders, 
either by way of people fleeing conflict or, occasionally, when competing armed groups 
cross borders resulting in instability within Ethiopia itself. Finally, instability fed by Islamic 
fundamentalists in Somalia also presents problems, as the porous borders with Ethiopia’s 
Ogaden result in unrest being transplanted to within Ethiopia itself. The dangers of all these 
potential hotspots present challenges to Ethiopia on at least two accounts: (i) they represent a 
significant distraction and make the delivery of services in certain parts of the country more 
difficult; and (ii) through the spill-over of localized conflict, they carry risks for Ethiopia’s 
internal security.  

 Political transition risk. There is a risk associated with the sudden passing away of the 
Prime Minster and ensuring a smooth transition in the coming months. To this end, GoE has 
indicated that the government continues to work as usual and has expressed its confidence 
that the existing public institutions will continue to function normally despite the transition. 
Furthermore, GoE has confirmed that the GTP remains the centerpiece of the country's 
development strategy, its commitment to the vision and goals stated in the GTP and that it 
will pursue its implementation as planned. GoE also reaffirmed its concurrence with the main 
thrust and focus of the CPS, which is strongly anchored in the GTP and has been developed 
through a highly consultative and collaborative process. Since the WBG Strategy is firmly 
anchored in the GTP, the risk of its implementation will be closely linked to tha t of the 
national program. In the longer term there is also a risk associated with the next elections 
scheduled for 2015.

ISSUES AND OBSTACLES 

Despite some good progress in reducing 
child mortality, Ethiopia is facing 
significant challenges in scaling up 
evidence based interventions to reduce 
maternal deaths.  The gains made in child 
mortality reduction also need to be 
sustained and further enhanced. 
 
Lack of 24/7 delivery services in most 
health facilities, especially, health 
centers 
Shortage, high turnover and 
insufficient skills of midwives and 
delivery attendants 
 High unmet need for family planning 

 

 

Low quality of education resulting 
from, inter alia, inadequate number of 
teachers, insufficient number of 
qualified teachers, inadequate number 
of textbooks.

Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report FY 2008 – 2012 

Date of CAS: April 29, 2008 
Date of CAS Progress Report: September 29, 2010  
Period covered by CAS: FY08 – FY12 (extended one year) 
Period covered by this report: April 2008 – March 2012 

I. Introduction  

A. Methodology 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) presents an assessment of the 
International Development Association’s (IDA) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia for 
FY08 – FY12. The CASCR aims to evaluate two dimensions of the CAS program implementation: i) 
program performance in influencing the CAS outcomes as laid out in the results framework and ii) the 
Bank’s performance in designing and managing the implementation of the program. In addition, this 
report offers lessons for the forthcoming Ethiopia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).  

2. 
The CASCR draws on key reviews undertaken during the implementation period, most notably 
the 2010 CAS Progress Report (CASPR), project implementation completion reports (ICR) and project 
implementation status and results reports (ISR). The CASPR, which was discussed with the Government 
and other stakeholders, made formal adjustments to the strategy reflecting realities on the ground. These 
changes have been taken into account in this CASCR.  This report also benefits from a workshop 
undertaken with the country team and government counterparts in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in February 
2012.  

B. Summary of performance 

3. 
The performance of the CAS program (FY08-FY12) is rated Moderately Satisfactory 
overall.  The rating is an aggregate measure of progress made toward achieving CAS outcomes 
which were achieved in varying degrees. Under pillar one of the CAS, ‘Fostering Economic Growth’, 
progress was made during the CAS period to invest in critical infrastructure for growth.  However, there 
was limited success in achieving macro-economic stability, particularly inflation, and structural reforms. 
That said, the FY08 CAS had clearly acknowledged that these were areas of weak dialogue with the 
Government of Ethiopia (GoE). Consequently the program was less ambitious on macro-stability and 
structural reform. Under pillar two, ‘Improving Access to and Quality of Basic Services’, access to basic 
services increased significantly under the CAS but improving the quality of services was less successful. 
This is partly due to the focus on increased access in order to achieve the MDGs which placed a strain on 
existing facilities. Under pillar three, ‘Reducing Vulnerability’, the GoE’s Food Security Program and its 
largest component, the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP) , had a positive impact on securing the 
access to food for chronically food insecure households . PSNP and the emergency Food Crisis Response 
Program were important instruments through which the Bank helped mitigate the effects of the 2008 food 
crisis. Vulnerability to environmental degradation was reduced by investments in watershed rehabilitation 
and flood management. Nonetheless, environmental pressures will remain a long-term challenge in light 
of Ethiopia’s fast rate of population growth. Under pillar four ‘Fostering Improved Governance’, the CAS 
program contributed to improved social accountability at the local level through citizen groups and 
participatory planning processes in woredas and targeted cities. Governance was also a cross-cutting 
theme in all pillars (see also para 39). At the national level, an anti-corruption policy has been prepared, 

Page 73 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but has not yet been ratified by the Council of Ministers.  Finally, under “Other Outcomes”, over 60% of 
IDA support was provided through program-based approaches, most notably PSNP and the Provision of 
Basic Services Program (PBS). New lending partially complied with the Africa Gender Action Plan 
criteria for gender mainstreaming in lending operations.  

4. 
Bank performance and implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. CAS design and 
CASPR adjustments were relevant and aligned to GoE objectives. The majority of indicators in the CAS 
results matrix are appropriate to measure the CAS outcomes; however a few outlier indicators have been 
identified in the assessment. While the text of the CAS and the CASPR provided a realistic account of 
what the constraints and opportunities were under each pillar, this was not reflected in some of the 
indicators and targets which were overambitious. 1 The Bank scaled-up successful programs such as 
PSNP, PBS, Roads APL and the Urban Local Governance and Development Project (ULGDP). 
Partnerships with other donors were maintained and the Bank often took the technical lead. Risk 
management could have been stronger had mitigation measures been better identified during CAS design 
and the CASPR.  Portfolio performance was satisfactory as the portfolio size and composition was well 
managed and disbursement levels were maintained at a high level. IEG evaluations of projects that closed 
during the CAS period noted that efficiency (value for money) could have been better and that M&E 
design, implementation and utilization also need improvement.  

C. Economic context  

5. 
During the CAS period, Ethiopia continued to experience strong economic growth . The 
main determinants of the sustained economic growth are the good performance of agricultural production 
(which comprises around 47.7% of the total economy)2, the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as 
the expansion of the construction sector (mainly roads and hydroelectric dams and housing).3 Annual real 
GDP growth was 10.8% in 2008, declining to 8.8% in 2009, and it is projected to be 7.6% in 2011 (see 
Table 1), with a per capita GDP shy of US$ 400 in 2011.  

6. 
Similarly to many other African countries, Ethiopia’s macroeconomic situation deteriorated 
after the onset of the global economic crisis in 2008. The country’s end-of-period inflation rose to 64% 
in July 2008 and its foreign exchange reserves fell to less than US$ 770 million (or less than four weeks 
of import coverage) by October 2008.  Recovery was supported by a 14 months arrangement under the 
IMF’s High Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility approved in August 2009 and 
concluded in November 2010.  During this period, inflation declined to single digits but rose again 
reaching 32% in January 2012 and declining slightly to 29% in April 2012. According to the IMF, 
Ethiopia’s highly expansionary monetary policy, that has been highly inflationary, could undermine 
macroeconomic stability.4 

7. 
Structural impediments to growth remain to be tackled, namely, more room for private 
sector development and a better investment climate.  Ethiopia’s ranking in the Doing Business report 
declined from 104th in 2011 to 111th in 2012. Some of the constraints in the investment climate, as 
perceived by the private sector, 5 include access to finance, tax administration, business licensing, 
reliability of electricity and a mismatch of skills in the labor market. Aside from these cross-cutting 

1 Notable disconnects include maintaining single digit inflation in light of the country’s soaring inflation over period 2008 – 
2010, using increased private sector credit as a ratio of GDP as a proxy for private sector activity and reaching 87% school 
completion rates.

constraints, abrupt policy changes in the regulatory environment may have undermined private sector 
confidence. Examples include changes to or the introduction of price caps, the trade licensing law, land 
leasing regulation, and a credit cap on the banking industry. Meanwhile, some positive measures to 
promote small and medium enterprises have been taken, such as lowering the administrative costs of entry 
for micro-firms.

8. 
Ethiopia has significantly invested in infrastructure for growth over the CAS period. This 
has been particularly prominent in the transport and communication sector.  Ethiopia’s vast hydropower 
potential is being developed as the country prepares to become a regional power exporter. Agricultural 
production and productivity has increased for major crops such as barley, maize, sorghum, teff and 
wheat due to increases in investments in agricultural inputs and area coverage. . Exports of oil seed, 
livestock and legumes have also increased, however, food prices have not fallen.  

9. 
Decentralization to the district and sub-district level is a focus of Ethiopia’s strategy to improve 
responsiveness and flexibility in service delivery and increase local participation. Whilst in theory 
districts (woredas) have substantial powers, in practice limited resources have been a brake on budget 
discretion, despite significant increases in sub-national revenue raising. Public sector reform and capacity 
building continue at the national level. 

10. 
The worst effects of the simultaneous food and fuel crisis in 2008 were stabilized through a 
national food security strategy.   Towards the end of 2008 6.4 million people were dependent on 
emergency food assistance, in addition to 7.3 million chronically food insecure people. Similarly, the 
PSNP and the humanitarian response system were also able to address the 2011 Horn of Africa drought to 
avoid the severe impacts that were seen in neighboring areas. However, the developments over the past 
years have shown that Ethiopia is still far away from achieving the paradigm shift away from 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
humanitarian food aid. Humanitarian aid provided to Ethiopia in the period of 2008 to 2011 was 
extremely high, averaging about US$ 807 million annually. Despite strong national growth in agriculture 
and food production as well as very significant investments to support food-insecure households, food 
insecurity increased compared to the period of the previous CAS. Based on figures from MoFED March 
2012 (“Ethiopia’s Progress Towards Eradicating Poverty: An Interim Report on Poverty Analysis Study 
(2010/11)”), the absolute number of food-poor people in Ethiopia increased from about 27.0 million in 
2004/05 to about 28.4 million in 2010/11. Given continued population pressure and increased weather 
volatility through climate change, a re-thinking of Ethiopia’s approach and the Bank’s support to achieve 
food-security might be needed.  

11. 
Ethiopia is making significant progress on all the MDGs and is projected to be one of the 
few African countries on track to meet goals relating to extreme poverty and hunger, combating 
HIV/AIDS and malaria and developing a global partnership for development. Good progress has 
been made on increasing access to universal primary education, reducing child mortality and increasing 
access to safe drinking water. Tackling gender disparity in education and improving the quality of 
education and health services remain a challenge for Ethiopia.   

II. 

CAS Program Performance  

A. Overview and principles of engagement   

12. 
Ethiopia’s FY08-12 CAS supported the GoE to achieve many of the outcomes envisioned in 
its 2005-2010 Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP). 
PASDEP, finalized in 2007, was Ethiopia’s second poverty reduction strategy and placed rapid and 
sustained growth at its center. It also had strong emphasis on achieving the MDGs, particularly on 
increasing access to basic services. The key objectives of the CAS aimed to sustain Ethiopia’s rapid 
economic growth and improvement in service delivery. The four objectives  of the CAS, i) fostering 
economic growth, ii) improving access to and improving quality of basic services, iii) reducing 
vulnerability and iv) fostering improved governance, were relevant and broadly aligned with the 
objectives of PASDEP. This was also Ethiopia’s first results-based CAS with clearly defined outcomes 
and indicators (discussed in detail in section B and annex 1). 

13. 
The Bank responded to GoE’s request to help mitigate the shocks related to the food, fuel 
and financial crises in FY09. An emergency food crisis response program was included in November 
2008 to avoid the worst effects of drought and rising food prices.  Under this program two IDA credits 
were approved:  
 Additional financing or the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP), which supported food and 
cash assistance to food insecure households (US$ 25 million);   
 Fertilizer Support Project providing foreign exchange to support the import distribution and sale 
of fertilizer (US$ 250 million).  

14. 
The CAS period was extended by one year to FY12 due to slower than expected progress 
toward CAS outcomes and to allow sufficient time to prepare a full new CAS program, in 
cooperation with the GoE to support its 2010-2015 Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 
November 2011).  The GTP’s objectives are to (a) attain high growth within a stable macroeconomic 
framework; (b) achieve the MDGs in the social sectors; and (c) establish a stable democratic and 
developmental state.   To accomplish its objectives, the GTP identifies the following strategic pillars: (i) 
sustained rapid growth; (ii) agriculture; (iii) industrialization; (iv) infrastructure investments; (v) 
enhanced social development; (vi) strengthened governance; and (vii) empowerment of youth and 

Page 76 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
women.  The GTP shifts the focus towards industrialization and speeding up Ethiopia’s structural 
transformation to become a middle-income country by 2025.  

15. 
The FY08-12 CAS lending program was mostly comprised of programmatic sector investments 
and analytical and advisory activities (AAA).  In keeping with the objectives of the CAS, a large portion 
of sector investments focused on provision of basic services (US$1,205m, 27% of the total CAS 
program), infrastructure development (US$1,055m, 24% of the CAS program) and social safety net 
programs (US$875m, 20% of the total CAS program). A smaller portion of lending focused on 
agriculture (US$590m, 13% of the total CAS program), governance and public sector development 
(US$350m, 8% of the total CAS program), and private sector development (US$235m, 5% of the total 
CAS program).6 The trust fund portfolio continued to be one of the largest in the Africa Region and 
disbursed US$ 3.46 billion during the CAS period. The majority of trust funds were used to co-finance 
IDA lending operations primarily in the human development sector, ensuring there was adequate 
alignment. The AAA portfolio focused on promoting pillar one of the CAS, “Fostering Economic 
Growth” and pillars two and three, “Improving Access to and Quality of Basic Services” and “Reducing 
Vulnerabilities”.  

16. 
Adjustments were made to the CAS program following the CASPR in FY10. Additional 
financing was favored as the most efficient lending instrument. The CASPR made a number of 
suggestions for the remaining CAS period FY11-12. These include scaling up existing operations, 
discussing a new phase on Sustainable Land Management that focuses on land administration, women’s 
economic empowerment and piloting results-based investment lending to support achievements in the 
health sector7. The CASPR suggested that the program could potentially include a PRSC if the Bank and 
the GoE reach an agreement on an agenda for structural change related to private sector development. 
This however, has not been achieved. The CASPR adjusted the timing of various operations and the 
Ethiopia/Kenya Interconnector was delayed until late FY12 8 , the Pastoral Community Development 
Project was not given additional financing and the Roads APL 5 remains pending until the completion of 
necessary analytical work. The CASPR also indicated that the FY11-12 non-lending program focus on 
improving decentralized service delivery, spurring private-sector led industrial growth and ensuring food 
security, most of which is planned or underway at the time of this report.

IFC re-opened its offices in Ethiopia in FY10 with the appointment of a Resident 
Representative. IFC is expanding its investments and advisory services in the country through a strategy 
based on three pillars:  (i) improving the investment climate; (ii) pro -active project mobilization in 
priority sectors and (iii) support to SMEs through linkages, improved access to finance, and integrated

shown in the table below.  

18. 
IFC advisory services, which were designed and developed in collaboration with the Government 
of Ethiopia, focused on access to finance and investment climate issues. On access to finance, IFC 
partnered with the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (“ECX”) and select Ethiopian commercial banks to 
develop Warehouse Receipts Finance markets in Ethiopia. The initiative’s main objective is to promote 
access to finance for farmers by leveraging their own production. IFC was instrumental in helping 
structure and lead the Ethiopia public-private dialogue process together with UNDP, including the 
establishment of a secretariat for the Ethiopian Public Private Consultative Forum (EPPCF).  

B. Progress by strategic engagement theme (towards CAS outcomes)  

19. 
The assessment of Bank program is based on a set of specific CAS outcomes as laid out in 
the CAS results framework and updated during the CASPR. The outcomes are assessed to be 
achieved, partly achieved or not achieved.9 The assessment is based on quantitative baselines and targets, 
with evidence compiled from available monitoring and evaluation arrangements. In some cases where 
outcomes cannot be measured quantitatively, the assessment considers additional information such as 
proxy indicators or progress on milestones. The assessment is corroborated with evidence gathered from 
the latest ISRs, ICRs, IEG evaluations of completed projects and interviews with the responsible project 
task team leaders. The CAS and the CASPR clearly state that satisfactory performance will have 
been achieved if 70 -75% of the entire set of outcomes are fully attained.10

20. 
Fostering economic growth: the CAS program aimed to support Ethiopia’s goal to foster 
economic growth through structural and macroeconomic policies that are conducive to sustaining internal 
and external balance, strengthening the road sector institutions and the domestic road construction 
industry, enhancing regional integration, increasing agricultural productivity in intervention areas, 
improving financial sector performance, reducing the cost of internet services and improving the 
investment climate. These outcomes were to be supported by the Public Sector Capacity Building 
Program (PSCAP), Roads Sector Development APL, the Energy Access Project, the Nile Basin Initiative 
Power Export Project, the Pastoral Community Development Program, the Irrigation and Drainage 
Project and the Sustainable Land Management Project, the Private Sector and Financial Sector 
Development projects among others, as well as a range of AAA, particularly for outcomes 1, 5, and 7.  

21. 
The majority of indicators used to measure outcomes under this pillar were country outcomes for 
which CAS attribution was difficult. For example, increased agricultural value added was not measured 
and was replaced by increased agricultural productivity of major crops. Other indicators that measured 
higher level outcomes are maintaining single-digit inflation levels, increasing revenue-to-GDP ratios and 
the expansion of private sector credit to GDP.  

22. 
Strong economic growth continued over the CAS period despite the fact that the space for free 
private sector development remains limited. Since 2010 Ethiopia has continued to run high inflation, 
recorded at 32% in January 2012 and averaging 38.1% between July 2011 and January 2012. The revenue 
to GDP ratio while improved (it reached 13.6% in 2011/12 from 12.1% in 2007/8), was nonetheless lower 
than expected and the target of 14.3% was missed. FDI patterns since 2007 are very volatile and generally 
weaker than in the pre-crisis years. Companies from India, Turkey and China are among the leading 
investors in Ethiopia; for the latter, the majority of investments focus on the manufacturing sector in 
Ethiopia.

Strides were made in the road sector as road density per 1000 km2 increased from 38.6 km in 
2007 to 48.1 km in 2011. The share of domestic contractors increased to 77% in 2011 from 35% in 2008. 
Electrification rates reached 41% of rural towns and villages in 2011 and the number of consumers 
connected grew from 800,000 in 2005, to more than 2 million in 2011. A number of activities to enhance 
regional integration remain pending. Construction of power transmission lines between Ethiopia and 
Sudan is complete and the power trade between the two countries is set to begin following an agreement 
on prices. The Ethiopia-Kenya Interconnector project under the East Africa Power Pool is expected to be 
approved in 2012 and will also contribute to regional integration. Other critical investments for growth 
include the Information and Community Technology Assisted Development Project. The project 
constructed 65 community ICT centers that served over 70,000 customers per month, 7 community radios 
and 4 regional ICT business incubators with 55 startup company tenants. At the policy and institutional 
level the project developed a foundation of policies, standards and guidelines for use of ICT in Ethiopia.  

24. 
According to official statistics, agricultural productivity of three major crops, wheat, teff and 
sorghum, increased by an average of 14% from 2007/8 to 2010/11.11 This has increased the agricultural 
income of a number of farmers close to markets, main roads and urban areas . Rice growth around the 
Gondar region developed over the past few decades and recent new varieties of upland rice have become 
increasingly popular allowing farmers to dictate prices to millers.  

25. 
Private sector development has followed three tracks over the CAS period. Privatization of state-
owned enterprises reached their targets however an environment of free competition is not yet there. A 
number of companies in telecom, the airline industry and shipping are not to be privatized for the time 
being as they are perceived by GOE as strategic industries. Secondly, support was given to establishing a 
Competition Authority under the Ministry of Trade and the Trade Practices and Consumer Protection 
Proclamation was enacted in 2010. Analytical work on the transport, telecom and finance sectors was 
conducted to help the GoE with its WTO accession negotiations, however little has been done in this area 
in terms of actual progress.  Finally, under the Private Sector Development Capacity Building Project 
matching grants schemes to SME for exports have been successful and supported 50 -60 firms in textile, 
leather and agro-processing manufacturing to increase exports by 25%. A high-level study tour to China 
and Turkey is currently under preparation to learn about different approaches to SME development and 
line of credits. A number of IFC advisory services have also contributed to the development of the private 
sector and improving the investment climate as mentioned previously.  

26. 
Improving access to and improving quality of basic services: CAS outcomes that contributed 
to the country-level goal of increasing access to and quality of basic services were increasing girls 
enrollment in primary and secondary education, sustainable access to potable water and sanitation 
services, delivery of key health services, improving the quality of education, rolling out kebele health 

11 However this data is not corroborated by other studies. According to the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment 
Mission to Ethiopia (2010) “national cereal and pulse production in 2009/10 is some 4.7 percent below the all time record harvest 
in 2008/09 but still about 7 percent above the previous five years average. Sorghum and maize crops have been most adversely 
affected, while production of teff and barley is less affected and production of wheat is expected to increase.” p.4.

extension packages to improve services and greater use of community radios for improved service 
delivery. This pillar was predominantly supported by the PBS 2 Program and the associated Pastoral 
Community Development Project 2, the General Education Quality Improvement Project (GEQIP), the 
Nutrition Project, the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project, water supply and sanitation projects and ULGDP. 
A large portion of the knowledge portfolio focused on this area , for example a decentralized service 
delivery study, public finance reviews and a health financing policy note.  

27. 
Indicators on increasing access to basic services were appropriate and targets were met for the 
large part. For long-term country level goal 2.3 ‘enhance citizen’s voice to improve quality of basic 
services’, the indicator on the number of community radio stations in operation is weak and insufficient. 
Results in this area are also demonstrated by the work on good governance under the Public Sector 
Capacity Building Project which established mechanisms for citizen’s participation in rural and urban 
kebeles. For example, the project supported the establishment of toll free call numbers that provide public 
information to citizens.  Users of these toll free numbers have increased to over 900 per day. 

28. 
The gender parity index increased to 90% in grades 1-4, 96% in grades 5-8, 83% in grades 9-10 
and 71% in grades 11-12.  Access to safe drinking water increased from 52% in 2007 to 73% in 2011 and 
60% of rural households were using latrines in 2011. The proportion of malfunctioning water facilities 
was reduced from 25% to 20% in 2011. Health services increased as the propor tion of children vaccinated 
against DPT3 reached 85% at the end of 2010.  

29. 
Ethiopia has made good progress in achieving the MDGs.  However, as defined in the CAS, 
progress on quality of services was less successful. Increasing access and simultaneously imp roving the 
quality of services were at times contradictory goals, as the supply of trained personnel was strained by 
increasing demand. Quality in education was measured by grade 5 completion rates which did not 
improve much from 65% in 2006 to 69% in 2011 .  However, completion rates in 2009 and 2010 were 
79% and 76% respectively, indicating that some improvements in quality were made but are not stable.  
In terms of quality of health, the 2012 DHS shows impressive improvement in health outcomes. The CAS 
outcome, rollout of health extension packages, was measured by a single indicator: percentage of births 
attended by trained health personnel, which increased from 9% in 2004 to 16.6% in 2011 but missed the 
target of 27%. Relying on only two indicators to measure quality does not fairly capture this outcome. 
Some of the targets were also set too high, dampening a story of real progress in the area of basic 
services.  

30. 
Reducing vulnerability: the CAS program contributed to decreasing vulnerability through 
containing food insecurity, developing a long-term food security and disaster risk management strategy 
and increasing investments in community-based watershed management. Results under this pillar were 
supported by investment in PSNP 3, the Sustainable Land Management project and the Tana and Beles 
Integrated Water Resources Development project. The knowledge portfolio supported this with Rural and 
Urban Safety Nets Notes, an Urban Poverty study and an Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change 
report. The CAS aimed to accelerate the demographic transition thus addressing population pressures - 
contraceptive prevalence rates doubled to 29% over the CAS period. 

31. 
The indicators measuring the CAS outcomes are appropriate. The CAS outcomes provide logical 
contributions to the country level goals under this pillar, except for one outlier on increasing women’s 
voice within communities that does not provide a logical link to reducing population pressures (in fact 
this indicator can be used to supplement the above mentioned outcome on increasing citizen’s voice to 
improve basic services). 

32. 
An impact assessment conducted in 2010 shows that food security of chronically food-insecure 
people targeted by PSNP was improved from 2006 to 2010 by 1.05 months for households participating 

Page 81 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in PSNP public works. 12  Supporting proxy measures show that there is a statistically significant increase 
in children’s meals consumed during the lean seasons between 2006 and 2010 and that five year 
participation in PSNP increased household livestock holdings by 0.38 TLU. 13 However, the overall 
number of food insecure people has increased, and humanitarian assistance to so-called transient food-
insecure and other beneficiaries reached very high levels of about US$807 million per year between 2008 
and 2011. This underlines the need for the GOE to focus its efforts on moving people out of poverty by 
increasing opportunities in relatively high-potential rural and urban areas and to focus on agricultural 
productivity increase as well as off-farm employment as more sustainable ways of improving food 
security.  

33. 
PSNP has also played a large role in addressing land degradation through its public works 
investments. Community assets built under the program have contributed to increases in the water table, 
vegetation cover, species diversity, expanded use of small-scale irrigation and the construction of 119 
farmer training centers.  Under the Sustainable Land Management Project, 210,000 hectares of watershed 
were rehabilitated from 2008 – 2011, and a further 318, 212 hectares were constructed in the PSNP public 
works component. By June 2012, total investments in community-based flood management are expected 
to reach US$ 5.75 million. The Federal and Regional Sustainable Land Management Platforms hold 
regular meetings to provide technical guidance in the implementation of SLM activities, as established by 
the TerrAfrica Initiative. Population pressure is being addressed by a doubling of the contraceptive 
prevalence rate from 15% in 2004 to 29% in 2011.  

34. 
Fostering improved governance: CAS outcomes under this pillar aimed to improve the 
performance of the public sector and enhance the capacity of local government to engage with citizens for 
more responsive services. Local engagement at the woreda and kebele levels has been explicitly 
encouraged by the GoE and has been supported by PBS 2, PSCAP and ULGDP. A public finance review, 
Investment Climate Assessment, procurement reforms and a Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment 
(CIFA) also supported this pillar.  

35. 
Indicators on public sector performance were drawn from the Woreda/City Benchmarking 
Survey, a representative survey that is routinely conducted. Results show that from 2008 to 2012 the 
proportion of respondents satisfied with agriculture extension services increased from 82% to 94%, 
satisfaction with solid waste services increased from 69.9% to 74%, satisfaction with water services 
decreased from 60% to 58% and satisfaction with health services rose from 34% to 70%. The proportion 
of people who made extra payments for general services increased from 4.3% in 2008 to 6.5% in 2011, 
interpreted by some as the result of the strain that the recent crises placed on service de livery.  Similarly, 
those reporting extra legal payments for government health services have also risen from 5.8% to 8.5% 
between 2008 and 2011.  

36. 
Fourteen public expenditure and financial accounting (PEFA) indicators improved out of a total 
of 28, showing 50% improvement over the 2007 scores. Improvement in citizen engagement in local 
government can be seen by the 75% increase in the number of citizen groups participating in the planning 
process for Capital Investment Plans in 19 cities. Participatory planning of basic services is adopted in 
80% of woredas that receive the Local Investment Grants in 2011. 83% of  woredas have posted their 
Layperson’s Budget and Service Facility Templates in 2011 and 19 cities have disseminated key 
information on budgets and expenditures for 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11. Local accountability has also

seen improvements in financial reporting as all regions are now submitting their interim financial reports 
in a timely manner over the last two quarters. 

37. 
Other outcomes: Over 60% of donor support was provided through program-based approaches, 
meeting the Paris Declaration target. The largest of these were PBS, PSNP and PSCAP. A CAS outcome 
on mainstreaming gender into project design was added in 2010. The indicator states that all new FY11-
12 lending includes gender considerations in the PDO. Gender mainstreaming has now been made a 
regional priority with more appropriate measures which are used as a proxy to assess achievement of this 
outcome. The Africa Gender Action Plan identifies the criteria for detailed coverage in lending as “gender 
issues are discussed and presented with quantitative data and extensive background information .” A 
review of FY11-12 lending shows that four out of six projects comply with GAP criteria.14 Projects such 
as PBS, PSNP and Urban Local Governance promoted the participation of women in community or city 
committees and women were given the opportunity to accrue an independent income through PSNP 
public works.  

C. Cross-cutting issues in CAS period 

38. 
Climate change: Issues related to climate change were addressed throughout the Bank portfolio. 
Most interventions to promote development help address climate change adaptation and / or mitigation. 
Good examples are projects promoting sustainable land and water management, agricultural development 
including irrigation, food security and renewable energy (AGP, PSNP and SLMP). For the most part, 
however, the Bank made no specific efforts to make its portfolio “climate-smart”.  Some analytical work 
on Climate Change was conducted in FY08 at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and a report on 
Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change (EACC) in FY11 was a deliverable for the COP16 UN 
Conference on Climate Change. The analysis addressed the impact of climate change on key sectors in 
Ethiopia.  The GoE’s investment in the development of the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE, 
2011) strategy is critical to climate change and overall development issues in Ethiopia and the region, 
and the Bank should significantly increase its engagement in this area. 

39. 
Governance and social accountability: While some progress has been made, governance 
challenges at the Federal level remained persistent. Implementation of the CAS program, with financial 
management and procurement controls, did however ensure transparency, social gains and progress 
towards the MDGs.  The PSCAP supported the establishment of citizen participation in local government 
processes, better service delivery, court reform and tax reform.  Social accountability and citizen 
participation has played a greater role at the local level and was part of the CAS program. Significant 
components of PBS 2 are focused on a) accountability in decentralized financial services (US$ 50.2m) 
and b) social accountability (US$ 21m). Financial transparency activities such as budget literacy training 
to citizens and the dissemination of budgets have also created links with the PSNP and other major donor -
funded programs. Awareness is not equal across all regions however, and female participation in budget 
literacy remains low. Due to higher-than expected performance of cities under the Urban Local 
Governance Development Project, Bank financing was doubled in 2011. The project provides a good 
model for how empowered local governments and local communities can transform cities and generate 
local employment.  

14 PBS monitors maternal health, gender parity index in schools and women’s participation in community planning groups.  The 
Urban Local Government Development project monitors jobs created for women and gender mainstreaming in urban local 
governments.  A gender study commissioned under PSNP shows that the project had a positive impact on female beneficiaries.  
The Agricultural growth project explicitly addresses gender considerations in its design.

Overall CAS Assessment 

40. 
The GoE assessed achievement of its national development strategy during this period, the 
PASDEP, as satisfactory.  Indeed, there has been a visible increase in economic growth and investments 
in strategic infrastructure paving the way for future growth. Major efforts were also made in increasing 
access to basic services. The GoE’s Food Security Program was able to lower the severity of the impact 
of the food crisis and Ethiopia was the only country in the Horn of Africa that did not experience famine. 
The CAS supported the PASDEP in select areas that reflect the Bank’s priorities and comparative 
advantage. However progress under the CAS pillars varied. Improvements on macro-economic stability, 
investment climate and the quality of basic services were not as expected. Overall CAS performance is 
therefore rated as Moderately Satisfactory due to uneven achievement of the outcomes under the 
CAS pillars. 

III. Evaluating Bank Performance  

41. 
The evaluation of the Bank’s performance focuses on two key dimensions: i) CAS design and ii) 
implementation of the CAS program.  

A. CAS Design 

42. 
The CAS was well aligned with the GoE’s priorities, namely the PASDEP, during the CAS 
period. The Bank’s flexibility to extend the CAS by one year up to FY12 ensured compatibility with the 
new GoE strategy, the GTP, which was under preparation during the CASPR. The additional year also 
gave the Bank sufficient room to conduct consultations with the GoE in order to prepare its upcoming 
CPS FY13-FY16. The CAS areas of engagement were based on the four main pillars which were aligned 
with Ethiopia’s national development goals. The Bank pursued CAS outcomes through a mix of 
investment lending and analytical advisory assistance that reflected the realities of the CAS period. Areas 
of strong GoE interest (such as basic services, food security and infrastructure) were heavily supported 
with investments and trust funds and were scaled up. In areas of divergence or lack of consensus (such as 
structural and macroeconomic policies) support relied on AAA to maintain dialogue. A prospective PRSC 
was not used in the absence of agreement between the Bank and the GoE on changes in structural issues. 
The PBS Program became an alternative to direct budget support and has successfully channeled 
resources to the woredas. However, as recognized in the previous CASCR, despite the successful shift in 
financing modalities from budget support to the PBS in reaction to the 2005 crisis, the benefits of budget 
support could not be fully replicated by PBS, being a more narrowly focused investment instrument.  This 
argues for reconsideration of budget support agenda going forward under the new CPS.  

43. 
The CAS program deepened partnerships with other donors. Trust Funds were well 
incorporated in lending. 91% of trust funds were used to co-finance IDA lending operations in FY11, 
98% of which was used to fund CAS objectives 2 and 3 (improving access and quality of basic services 
and reducing vulnerabilities). In addition to creating multi-donor trust funds for PBS and PSNP, the Bank 
also housed the PBS Secretariat and the PSNP Donor Coordination Team and provided other in -kind 
support to the committees.  The AGP, through its partnership framework, provides a basis for 
strengthened and more harmonized support to agricultural growth in Ethiopia. The program has leveraged 
more than US$ 100 million in addition to IDA financing.  Similarly, the GEQIP (General Education 
Quality Improvement Program) is financed by a group of development partners through pooled funding 
arrangements.  IDA financing was used to secure more than US$ 130 million for the National Nutrition 
Program and the Bank led the coordination along with UNICEF.  The Bank also coordinated grants under 
global and regional programs such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Education for All – Fast 
Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), and the Global Partnership for Output Based 
Aid (GPOBA).

44. 
The expected outcomes in the CAS results framework are overall realistic. For the most part, 
there are good linkages between the strategic pillars, outcomes and indicators. Targets however were set 
too high given the role of the CAS as one of many contributions to the PASDEP. The inability to meet 
some of these targets dampened a story of real progress in some areas.  

45. 
The CAS examined four groups of risks that remained relevant during the CAS period: i) 
Ethiopia’s vulnerability to external shocks, in particular drought and possible regional conflict, ii) two 
governance risks related to the possibility of disputes over local elections in April 2008 (and 
parliamentary elections in 2010), and the ongoing military action in the Ogaden area of Ethiopia’s Somali 
region to subdue separatist rebel elements, iii) macro-economic risks as a consequence of rising food and 
oil prices and iv) procurement and financial management risks as a result of weak capacity and shortage 
of skills at the local level. The CASPR heightened the risks related to vulnerability to external shocks and 
weak capacity in procurement and financial management, and lowered those related to governance and 
macro-economic stability over the period FY08 –FY10.  Mitigation of risks is discussed in the following 
section.  

B. CAS implementation  

46. 
The bulk of lending activities were done through a program-based approach and the Bank 
has acted as the technical lead for the majority of the activities, along with DFID and UNICEF. A 
number of joint AAA have also been conducted, such as the CIFA report and the Woreda/City 
Benchmarking Survey.  

47. 
The Bank was highly supportive of the CAS program, as evident by the high level of project 
staff decentralized to the country office in Addis Ababa. Successful projects such as PBS were scaled up 
to be implemented nationwide.  Significant investments were also made in critical development areas 
such as infrastructure (namely roads and energy access) and agriculture.  The country team explored 
innovative approaches, such as results-based lending, which has been welcomed by the GoE and the new 
Program for Results instrument is the basis for a health project currently under preparation.  Output based 
lending was also used under the Energy Access project but results were delayed because of the 
moratorium on electricity connections.  The country team demonstrated efficiency by having one of the 
lowest administrative costs to IDA allocation ratios in Africa, along with Nigeria.   

48. 
The Bank successfully engaged in a number of areas where the GoE has a strong program 
for development.  There is strong commitment and ownership to increasing access to basic services and 
reducing vulnerability, as the progress towards CAS outcomes clearly shows.  On the other hand, very 
little traction has been made with the GoE regarding private sector development especially in policy 
sensitive areas or those that may require substantial sector reform such as the financial sector and land 
policy. 

49. 
Portfolio management and performance.  Bank portfolio performance maintained strong 
growth and a high disbursement ratio, while maintaining selectivity.   The Ethiopia portfolio has nearly 
doubled since FY08: in April 2008 net commitments were US$ 2.4 billion, compared to US$4.4 billion in 
February 2012. The number of projects in the portfolio has been reduced to 25, from 30 in 2009.  Since 
FY09, the disbursement ratio has exceeded 30% and is on track to do so in FY12. Although the 
impressive disbursement rate is unquestionably driven by fast-disbursing projects as the PBS and PSNP, 
the rest of the projects have also been disbursing reasonably well, with a few exceptions. 15 Proactivity has 

15 The Irrigation and Drainage SIL, Tana and Beles Integrated  Water Reservation Development Project, Tourism Development 
Project, Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and the Road Sector Development  Stage IV APL Projects.

been 100% except for FY10 (67%), which is another indication of good portfolio management. Average 
project preparation time (IDA investments only - PE) for projects approved during the CAS period is 
around 14 months16 (better than the regional average – 16-18 months), although there is wide variation 
between individual projects (ranging from 4 to 27 months). As of February 2012, there were no overage 
projects in the portfolio, though the average project age has increased to 5 years.  This is due to only two 
projects being approved since FY10.  Formal restructuring , other than that carried out as part of the 
support under the global food crisis response, has been practically non-existent (3 restructurings 
altogether during the CAS period). IEG evaluations of completed projects concluded that some of the 
projects should have been restructured or, if they had been, the restructuring was too late or not deep 
enough.  During the CAS period there were eleven additional financings, showing good use of the 
instrument.  However, three of the additional financings were for projects whose funds had been 
previously deployed to the Global Food Crisis Response Project, which suggests that there was some 
trade-off between the affected projects and the emergency response. 

50. 
Projects at risk have been relatively high, reaching 28% in FY08 and FY11, though associated 
commitments at risk have been comparatively lower (FY08 being an exception), indicating that risks are 
rather related with smaller projects.  Actual problem projects, however, are 10% on average over the CAS 
period, which, if compared to outcome ratings in IEG evaluations of completed projects during the same 
period (8 projects evaluated, 37% unsatisfactory outcome ratings), suggests that ratings assessments 
during implementation may have been optimistic.  That said, the net disconnect for Ethiopia (12.5%) is 
nearly half the AFR region’s (22%), and effectively reflects a net disconnect for one project. 

51. 
 IEG reviews of projects that closed during the CAS period highlighted shortcomings in the 
quality of M&E design, implementation and utilization. To advance policy dialogue, maintaining and 
tracking data sources is a necessary condition. Ethiopia continues to have weak data collection and 
capacity. For this the Bank may need to engage collaboratively with the statistical agency in Ethiopia to 
improve country data systems and improve data collection for Bank projects. 

52. 
The total amount allocated for core knowledge products over the CAS period was US$ 5.2 
million, 80% of which was for economic and social sector work (ESW) and 20% for technical assistance 
(TA). 46% of the analytical and advisory activities (AAA) supported the CAS objective ‘fostering 
economic growth’ and 45% was linked to the CAS objectives ‘improving access and quality of basic 
services’ and ‘reducing vulnerabilities’, the majority of which are linked to education and social services. 
Only 7% of AAA outside project budgets supported infrastructure lending. 39% of the knowledge budget 
was used to address public finance, macro-economic and private sector development themes however 
with limited traction on these topics. There is little evidence that analytical advisory work was 
disseminated and discussed with stakeholders beyond the core GoE counterparts. 

53. 
The Bank was quick to respond to the 2008 global food and fuel crisis through the 
Emergency Food Crisis Response Program. The program had two parts, additional financing to the 
PSNP and the Fertilizer Support Project. The Fertilizer Support Project was designed to ensure an 
aggregate supply of chemical fertilizers for 2009 – 2010 in order to prevent a fall in agricultural output 
which would have exacerbated the food crisis. This was financed through re-deploying financing from 12 
existing projects and additional Bank financing (total US$ 250m). The project was approved in three 
months, an exceptionally quick response by the Bank. However, the IEG evaluation questioned the sole 
importer arrangement with the GoE, the logistics of fertilizer distribution, and the efficiency of having 
foreign exchange resources locked in fertilizer stocks.

the Ethiopia - Sudan Interconnector Project (43 months).

54. 
The Bank was slower to respond to the 2008-2010 moratorium imposed by the GoE on 
electricity connections, halting the implementation of the entire energy portfolio for the duration of that 
period. In retrospect, it was difficult to foresee when the moratorium would have ended. The risk, 
however, was already present at the time of the CASPR and the document should have discussed the 
challenges facing the energy portfolio. 

55. 
The CASPR was used to reflect on the initial CAS period, to validate continued relevance of 
CAS objectives and identified risks. No major course correction was made during the CASPR. 
Revisions to the results matrix were made, the number of core outcomes was reduced to 22 and 39 
indicators (down from 26 and 51 respectively), including adding the core sector indicators. The CASPR 
attempted to mainstream gender considerations and dropped indicators on a regional road network, 
growth corridor and support to rural diversification due to slow progress in these areas.  

56. 
The mitigation of risks during the CAS period was mixed, with a few unforeseen risks 
arising. To mitigate the risk of extreme weather events, the Bank supported the GoE to prepare a disaster 
risk management strategy. The worst effects of the recent (2008 and 2011) droughts were mitigated 
through the PSNP. Vulnerability to the food crisis was mitigated by portfolio restructuring to support 
urgent investments in food security and boosting fertilizer supplies to boost agricultural production. The 
sharp decline in fertilizer prices in 2009 could not have been expected and resulted in excess funds 
allocated to the Ethiopia Global Food Crisis Response Project, which were re-directed to PBS 2.  
Macroeconomic risk did not stabilize as anticipated and, following the conclusion of the IMF program in 
2010, inflation peaked to nearly 40% in late 2011.  Monetary policy remains a concern.  The expected 
post-election violence in 2010 did not occur while the security risks related to operating in the Somali 
region meant that operations did not take place there over the CAS period. The CASPR anticipated that 
drought could affect hydropower generation but offered no mitigation measures.  

IV. Lessons Learnt and Suggestions for New CPS 

CAS focus 

57. 
Realizing Ethiopia’s full potential and achieving GTP economic and social targets would require 
stable macroeconomic framework and increased role of the private sector. It is therefore important for 
the Bank to find ways to engage more effectively with GoE in policy dialogue on macroeconomic 
issues and private and financial sector issues. The CAS acknowledged the limitations in policy 
dialogue and relied mostly on analytical advisory work to engage GoE on structural reform matters, 
which had limited impact. Increasing the relevance of the Bank’s ESW, through providing more 
flexible/just in time policy pieces requested by the GoE, could contribute to improved dialogue. In terms 
of financial assistance, it might be important for the Bank to offer the Government a range/menu of 
instruments available to support private sector growth and facilitation, including guarantees, credit lines 
as well as a complementary package of services provided by the IFC and MIGA.  

58. 
Additional suggestions for improving Bank Group engagement in the area of private sector 
development include: (i) strengthening public-private partnership for advancing dialogue and (ii) 
leveraging on partnership with other development partners to align key messages to the 
Government in some of the challenging areas. 

59. 
GoE’s efforts to stabilize the effect of the 2008 food crisis and 2011 drought through programs 
such as PSNP were relatively successful, but overall the absolute number of people who were food 
insecure has increased over the period 2006-2010. This result indicates that a more comprehensive 
solution for food security is required, which would include but not be limited to the GoE’s current Food 

Page 87 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Security Program.  Given population pressure and the possible negative effects of climate change, it 
would be important for the Bank to support the GoE’s efforts on moving people out of poverty by 
increasing opportunities for on and off-farm employment as a more sustainable way of improving food 
security in the medium to long term. Support to private sector and agribusiness would constitute an 
important part of this agenda going forward.  

60. While recognizing the important role of employment generation as an additional way of 
improving food security in the medium to long-term, the Bank also acknowledges that there will be a 
portion of the population that remains highly vulnerable, particularly in the context of increasing 
uncertainties around climate change. In terms of addressing the policy and program responses to 
vulnerability, the Bank should continue to support and strengthen social protection systems and 
invest in disaster risk management programs. 

61. 
In addition to supporting GoE focus on access to basic services, the Bank needs to more 
actively engage in improving the quality of basic services. The PASDEP was centered on achieving the 
MDGs which focused on access to basic services, creating a trade-off with the quality of these services. 
As experience showed, all focus during the CAS period was directed to increasing access, crowding out 
efforts to improve quality.  Challenges to improving quality will be critical if the benefits from higher 
access are to be fully materialized in the longer term. Utilizing a newly approved instrument – Program 
for Results (P4R) – might provide a good opportunity for the Bank to shift its focus from access to 
quality. 

62. 
Bridging the data and knowledge gap for evidence-based dialogue: An important and 
common challenge in Ethiopia is the scarcity and reliability of data sources. To advance policy dialogue, 
maintaining and tracking data sources is a necessary condition. Ethiopia continues to have weak data 
collection and capacity. For this the Bank may need to engage collaboratively with the statistical agency 
in Ethiopia to improve country data systems. At the same time, where possible, Bank projects should 
build in their design both rigorous impact evaluations and continuous monitoring to adjust design 
parameters as and when needed. 

CAS Design 

63. 
Built-in flexibility and mitigations measures ensure more adequate response to identified 
risks at the project level: PSNP was designed with the flexibility to anticipate and scale up in the 
possibility of a shock, through its risk financing mechanism. In comparison, the energy portfolio, while 
identifying solutions to the long-term challenges that face the sector, did not have an adequate response 
on hand for the moratorium. The diversification of activities under the energy portfolio and not solely 
focusing on access projects may reduce this risk.  

64. 
At the portfolio level better emergency responses need to be designed in countries that are 
prone to disasters such as Ethiopia. The portfolio restructuring in response to the food crisis was quick 
but it was a time and labor-intensive exercise and funds may not always be available if a future crisis 
were to occur.   

65. 
Careful thought should be put into linking lending and non-lending instruments with the 
indicators and the CAS outcomes that form a logical results framework. This will help to avoid 
disconnect between the outcomes and indicators. It is particularly important to avoid pitfalls in using 
high-level indicators that are beyond the scope of the CAS. This was most evident in the lack of 
achievement of outcomes under pillar 1.  

Page 88 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CAS Implementation 

66. Monitoring the CAS results framework more regularly will help maintain realistic targets 
and flag deficiencies in outcome indicators. The CPPR can be used as an opportunity to check progress 
on the future CPS results framework in preparation for the CASPR and CASCR stages. This would 
ensure that data is available and efforts are being made to strengthen the quality of the results framework.   

67. 
Recognition of the unique advantages of budget support. Despite the successful shift in 
financing modalities from budget support to the PBS in reaction to the 2005 crisis, the benefits of budget 
support could not be fully replicated by PBS, as a more narrowly focused investment instrument.  Budget 
support provided an important forum for dialogue, especially on issues related to growth and structural 
reforms.  In addition, the multi-donor dialogue fostered by budget support enhanced donor harmonization 
and reduced transaction costs. These factors argue for the resumption of budget support agenda going 
forward under the new CPS. 

68. 
Programmatic approaches which can be scaled up tend to be successful, by leveraging 
greater resources from partners, disbursing faster, and having greater flexibility.17 Such models can also 
help build country systems in the sectors they are operating in. The future CPS should seek to replicate 
this model where possible.  

17 Good examples include the Nutrition Project, PBS and PSNP.

The ambitious targets set 
have downplayed actual 
real progress that has been 
made on these outcomes.  
Furthermore, relying on 
only two indicators to 
measure quality does not 
fairly capture this outcome.  

The indicator used is a 
weak measure of the use of 
community radios for 
improved service delivery. 

Using days as the unit of 
measure is not consistent 
with the available data, 
which uses months as its 
unit of measure. The 
available data is not so 
accurate to be measured in 
days.

Gender Action Plan has 
more detailed and nuanced 
criteria of how gender 
considerations are to be 
mainstreamed into lending

Appendix 5: Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis 
(DSA)1 

1. 
The DSA shows that Ethiopia remains at a low risk of external debt distress in 2012. 
However, vulnerabilities remain as the most extreme stress test indicates. The debt burden 
indicators remain below the policy dependent-thresholds for the whole projection period 
including all stress tests. Even though the external debt ratio remains within thresholds, it shows 
sensitivity to changes in the terms of new public sector loans. Although most of macro indicators 
and assumptions have slightly changed (downward) compared to the projections in the previous 
2011 DSA, the present value (PV) of external debt to exports remains at similar levels (around 
97 percent). The projection of new debt disbursement was lower than in last year’s DSA estimate 
as disbursement of loans to public infrastructure investment is estimated to slow down.  
Furthermore, public infrastructure investment, as planned in the GTP, relies heavily on financing 
from domestic sources. Pursuing the full implementation of the investment plan in the originally 
envisioned time frame may lead to a large accumulation of public debt and could have 
implications of crowding the private sector. Ethiopia has substantial levels of foreign exchange 
receipts from remittances. Since the baseline and sensitivity tests without remittances do not 
breach any of the country specific thresholds, the analysis of DSA focuses on the method that 
does not consider remittances. 

2. 
The 2012 DSA baseline scenario shows a rising path of public and publicly guaranteed 
external debt over the next few years, but will remain well under the various thresholds (see 
figures below). The PV of external debt in percent of exports will slowly increase peaking at 
106.7 percent in 2017 and continue declining over the projection period. A similar trend is 
observed for the PV of debt to GDP and revenue. The debt service to exports is projected to 
remain well below the threshold; it will peak at 8.9 percent in 2019 and declines afterwards on 
account of the expectation of servicing non-concessional borrowing by public enterprises. 

3. 
Under the historical scenario, the debt stock indicators are lower than under the baseline 
scenario in the short term but would rise slightly above those of the baseline scenario over time. 
The PV of debt to exports is projected to fall over the next five years by 23 percentage points 
from current levels before beginning to rise to a peak of 94.8 percent. The most extreme test 
which is characterized by new public sector loans negotiated on less favorable terms (200 basis 
point higher interest rate during the forecast horizon), would show a substantial increase to a 
peak of 145.7 percent (very close to the threshold), but decline after 2020. This is the result of 
the recent and further expected disbursement in non-concessional terms for public infrastructure 
investment. 

4. 
With regard to total public sector debt (external and domestic sources), under the baseline 
scenario, the total public sector debt-to-GDP ratio would rise in the medium term. In addition to 
an accumulation of external public and publicly-guaranteed debt, a significant amount of 
domestic financing is projected to occur through major public enterprises, particularly the state-

with the IMF. The DSA document has not yet been published.

owned electricity company, which continues to run operating losses and plans to invest heavily. 
Among others, the Grand Renascence Dam is expected to be financed largely from domestic 
sources. 
5. 
In summary, DSA 2012 indicates that Ethiopia stays at a low risk of external debt distress 
– similar to the findings in 2009/10 and 2010/11. But given the large financing requirements for 
the GTP, it is expected that debt ratios would rise moderately in the medium-term but stabilize in 
the long-term. New disbursement projections reflect the fact that borrowing from domestic 
sources is capacity constrained and public enterprises would continue to rely significantly on 
external financing to sustain its large infrastructure investments that are driving growth; for the 
latter it has to be expected that a growing share would be on non-concessional terms. Consistent 
with GoE's intention to keep a low risk of external debt distress, the amount of non-concessional 
borrowing will be limited. Indeed there may be a trade-off between GoE’s desire to maintain a 
low risk rating and the implementation pace of the GTP. In other words, GoE may need to 
increase the implementation period of the GTP in order to smooth the profile of the non-
concessional financing requirements for the planned investments.  Ethiopia is subject to the IDA 
Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP). In the absence of an IMF program, IDA could 
establish a non-concessional borrowing limit if it was consistent with the maintenance of low 
debt vulnerabilities, and if the planned investments are critical and growth-enhancing.2  The GoE 
officially requested a non-concessional borrowing limit of US$ 1 billion and the Board will be 
informed of IDA management’s decision as specified in the NCBP.  

2 The ability to establish a non-zero ceiling for non-concessional lending in IDA's NCBP in the absence of an IMF 
program was outlined in "IDA's Non-concessional Borrowing Policy: Progress Update", April, 2010.  (IDA Sec 
54240)

Appendix 6: Analysis of Gender Inequalities and Opportunities in 
Ethiopia3 

1. 
The Government of Ethiopia’s (GoE) has a strong commitment to gender equality, which 
is firmly rooted in national policies as well as in the signing of international and regional treaties 
and protocols on women’s rights. Promoting gender equality is a central element in the GoE 
Growth and Transformation Plan 2010/11-2014/15 and its cross cutting sectors theme (Chapter 
8) identifies a range of gender concerns. The Ministry of Women, Youth and Children’s Affairs 
contribute to policy development and support gender mainstreaming in all government ministries 
and bureaus and spearhead responses to address gender inequalities. To date gender units have 
been established in all line ministries and in the regions. However, implementation capacity 
remains a challenge.  

2. 
The gaps in women’s and men’s development opportunities are significant, and there is 
ample room for reduction in the country’s gender inequality. The literacy levels of women are 
markedly lower than those of men, especially in rural areas and among urban poor. In education, 
the retention level of girls in secondary education is lower than that of boys, and the gender gap 
is steep in tertiary education. Despite having 28 percent female parliamentarians, women are 
generally under-represented in decision-making (only 3 of the ministers are women). There is a 
pronounced gender gap in access to and control of productive resources. Although they 
contribute to much of the agricultural labor, women’s access to land continues to be limited 
despite joint land certification efforts. As a consequence their access to farm inputs, extension 
advice and credit are way below men’s, what slows down land productivity and the country’s 
economic growth. Women lack economic opportunities, have limited involvement in cash crop 
production, non-farm enterprises and wage employment. Harmful cultural practices (such as 
female genital mutilation (FGM) and early marriages) are widely practiced and gender based 
violence is widespread. Climatic changes, HIV/AIDS and other livelihood stresses put women’s 
participation in the economy, society and in education further at risk. There is also considerable 
heterogeneity across region and location (rural vs. urban). Indicators of empowerment show 
increasing disparities between the best and worst performing regions, reflecting in part the 
deterioration of some indicators in the worst performing regions. Further, while progress has 
been made gender disparities persist, with regions that were ranked poorly in 1995 and 2005 are 
still lagging in 2011.4 

3. 
While reducing the large gender gaps in Ethiopia is an important development goal in its 
own right, it is well established that improving gender equality in the country would lead to large 
leaps in achieving many of the other key development goals. World Bank (2008) estimates 
indicate that reducing basic gender inequalities in education and the labor market could increase 
the annual GDP growth in Ethiopia by around 1.9 percentage points – which would be an 
important contribution to poverty reduction given the elasticity of growth to poverty reduction. 

3 The analysis is based on a comprehensive Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 2000, 
2005 and 2011. 
4 For example, the Gender Parity Index (the ratio of girls to boys attending school) in secondary net schooling 
attendance was 0.42 in Somali region, while it was 1.08 in Tigray – a difference that has been persistent over the 
years (DHS, 2011, section2.6.3).

Evidence from other countries confirm that under-investing in women limits economic growth 
and slows down poverty reduction (2012 WDR). Moreover, evidence across the globe links 
increases in women’s productivity and earnings to lower household poverty and to better health 
and education outcomes for household members, especially children.  

Reduced gender inequalities in primary education, but adult education still needs attention 

4. 
The policies to ensure gender equality in education in Ethiopia are elaborated in the 
Education and Training Policy (April 1994) and the Education Sector Development Program IV, 
2010. The GoE Educational Statistics Annual Abstract FY11 shows an increase in the female 
Gross Enrollment Rate for primary education (grades 1-8) from 84% in FY06 to 93% in FY11. 
The girls/boys ratio for 1-4 grade worsened from 95% in FY07 to 90% in FY11, while the ratio 
for grade 5 to 8 improved in the same period, from 88% to 96%. Improvements continue for 
secondary enrolment – female GER for grades 9-10 increased from 25% in FY06 to 35% in 
FY11, while male GER is relatively stable around 42-45%. Hence, the girls/boys ratio in 
secondary education increases – from 59% in FY06 to 83% in FY10. Average drop-out rates in 
primary school have been approximately the same for boys and girls during the last 7 years. In 
2011, 51% of women between 15 and 49 years of age did not have any education compared to 
29% of men compared to 75% of women and 52% of men in 2000 (Table below). Secondary 
school attendance shows a much less favorable picture with very low rates for both girls and 
boys and the numbers are actually declining. Very few people have more than secondary school 
in Ethiopia and the gender difference in tertiary education and above is large. Even though the 
growth in shares with this level of educational attainment has been high, the shares remain low. 
Only 4 percent of women have education higher than secondary, while the corresponding figure 
for men is 7 percent.

Women’s health continues to be of major concern 

5. 
Maternal mortality remains at alarmingly high rates, despite being considered among the 
most important indicators of women wellbeing and one of the Millennium Development Goals. 
Use of contraceptives doubled from 2005 to 2011 (from 15% to 29%), family planning increased 
from 25% of households to 60% in the same period and population growth is declining in 
Ethiopia (Ethiopia Population and Housing Census 2007). Fertility declined 10% from 2005 to 
2011 while adolescent fertility was reduced 35% in the same period. Despite fewer births per 
women and expectations of reduced maternal mortality ratio 5 , especially among very young 

5 Maternal Mortality Ratio is defined as the number of deaths during pregnancy, childbirth or the first 2 months of 
childbirth per 100.000 live births.

women, maternal mortality remains stubbornly high (673 deaths per 100.000 live births in 2005 
and 676 in 2011). 

6. 
Women with poor nutritional status have higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and 
hence anemia is of particular importance for this group. The reduction of anemia in women has 
been large in Ethiopia from 2005 to 2011 - actually more than twice the reduction in anemia in 
children in the same period. The DHS 2005 and 2011 show the share of women suffering from 
moderate and severe anemia has been more than halved in this period, while there has been a 25 
percent reduction in the share with mild anemia. The reduction has been higher in urban areas, 
although the urban-rural difference is much lower than what is found for children. Severe anemia 
was almost eliminated in urban areas as the share declined by 85 percent. Nonetheless, the 
prevalence of anemia in women is still high and the gap between men and women in 2011 shows 
the disadvantaged situation of women (prevalence of anemia is twice as high in urban women as 
that of urban men, while it is 40 percent higher for rural women as compared to rural men). 

Significant benefits to be gained from gender equalizing policies in the economic sector 

7. 
In accessing jobs, Ethiopian women’s opportunities to leverage their labor in the market 
are hindered by their limited skills and greater burden of household responsibilities. As a result, 
women face lower economic activity rates6, lower employment rates and higher unemployment 
rates than men. They are also disproportionately concentrated in unpaid or flexible jobs that offer 
lower earnings and less security and their ability to move to better jobs is limited by some form 
of labor market discrimination/segmentation. Factors such as location and age are also correlated 
with worse labor market outcomes. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging signs of progress 
in Ethiopia when it comes to women’s participation in the economy. The economic activity rate 
is equalizing among the younger cohorts in urban areas as it increased 10 percent for young 
women (age 20-34) from 2009 to 2011 while there was no change for young men. Still, the 
gender gaps in the urban economy remains very large: the female unemployment rate is twice as 
large as that of males in 2011, women earn 50 percent less than men, the share of women without 
education is double that of men, microenterprises owned by women earn only a fraction of those 
owned by men and women face larger barriers for doing business. 

8. 
Around 45 percent of the differences in earnings between men and women in Ethiopia 
can be explained by worker characteristics, while as much as 40 percent of the gap is 
unexplained. Among workers characteristics, lower investments in human capital and less 
experience on the job account for 25 to 39 percent of the gap in earnings between men and 
women. Job characteristics are also systematically less favorable for women. Independent of 
their observable individual characteristics, women are more likely to end up in less rewarding 
segments of the labor market, pointing to some implicit form of job discrimination, particularly 
for the younger wage employed. Finally, about 40 percent of the wage gap cannot be explained 
based on observable individual or job characteristics. In the economics literature this 

6 According to ILO definition, economically active means to be working to produce goods and/or services for others 
or for own consumption, or actively seeking such work (i.e. includes unemployed). Unpaid household chores such 
as preparing food, cleaning the house and taking care of children are not considered economic activities. The 
economic activity rate measures the share of the population that is economically active to the total population.

unexplained gap is referred to as “pure wage discrimination effects” as it implies that individuals 
with identical characteristics other than their gender are not being paid the same. This 
discrimination effect appears to be more marked as the age of the workers increases.  

9. 
Gender equality is legally provided for in business ownership and administration, 
although in practice biases remain. The literature suggests that Ethiopian culture discourages 
women from taking up a career in business. Instead, women’s core activities are often perceived 
as reproductive tasks. This image leads to some specific bottlenecks, such as women’s ability to 
travel away from home, own larger animals, and even control their own independent income 
(ILO, 2003). Families of growth-oriented women would often frown upon their business 
initiatives and many women who would like to go into business cannot because their families or 
husbands do not allow them (TriodosFacet 2011). For the same reason, many women face 
cultural obstacles to grow their small business. Also, women are culturally pressed into 
traditional ‘women businesses’ such as food preparation, hairdressing, and textile production 
confirming the segmentation identified above (Stevenson and St. Onge, 2005). Analysis of the 
latest investment climate assessment data revealed that women face greater barriers at start up.  
Likewise, results from the Rural Investment Climate Survey for Amhara suggest that women are 
more likely than men to do activities with low capital requirements and low productivity (and 
often bearing social stigma) because of lack of other options, as opposed to men entrepreneurs 
whose businesses tend to be much larger and much more profitable. Further, non-farm 
enterprises owned by women in rural areas and urban towns tend to be much smaller and less 
productive than men’s.  

10. 
Gender equality in land tenure, property ownership and inheritance is guaranteed by 
legislation, which also recognizes the legal presumption of joint property by spouses. Yet in 
practice biases persist, particularly towards single women. In some regions such as Amhara and 
Tigray efforts have been made to ensure equal land use rights for women. The most significant 
development in the recent past in this area has been the programs of land certification 
implemented in the four main regions of the country. More than 20 million land-use certificates 
have been issued with both spouses’ names and photos on the certificates, and women’s 
registration for land increased significantly. Some of the benefits of those programs are already 
becoming apparent and a recent nationwide survey indicated that more than 80 percent of 
households expected rural land certification to improve women’s position and women 
respondents who had received a joint certificate almost universally pointed to this as having 
improved their economic and social status. Nonetheless, there is still scope for improvements in 
gender-mainstreaming of these programs and of their implementation on the ground. 

Women lack access to justice  

11. 
Progress in the legal framework was achieved in 2005 when the Family and Penal Codes 
were purged of gender biases, the minimum age for marriage was raised to 18 and important 
concepts such as rape were broadened and domestic violence specifically listed as a crime. All 
new legislation is now systematically reviewed through gender lenses, reflecting a commitment 
by the government to close the gender gap. Ethiopia has signed, but not ratified the Women’s 
Rights Protocol to the African Charter, which entered into force in November 2005. Nonetheless, 
evidence suggests violence against women in Ethiopia is among the highest in the world – 70% 
have been assaulted by their partner (WHO 2006) and domestic violence in Ethiopia can increase 

Page 112 

 
 
 
when women enter formal employment (WDR, 2012).  The 2011 Demographic and Health 
Survey found that 68 percent of all Ethiopian women believe that such violence is justified for 
one reason or another (down from 81 percent in 2005). Abduction of young girls and of female 
genital cutting continues to be major problems in many parts of the country. The introduction of 
the Charities and Societies Proclamation law (CSO law) in 2010 has negatively affected the 
NGOs that promote gender equality, especially the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association 
(which played a crucial role in changing the legislation towards gender neutrality in 2004-05).  

12. 
In urban areas, more advanced women entrepreneurs face more severe challenges than 
their male counterparts and appear to suffer especially from vulnerability to crime, corruption 
and extortion. Most micro and small business owners fear taking their disputes to courts. There 
seems to be a general perception that going to formal courts is waste of time and that those with 
the most resources will win the case anyway. Hence, many entrepreneurs prefer settling disputes 
through mediation, arbitration or other means including at the cost of unofficial payments and 
undue loss of revenues. 

Recommendations 

13. 
In education and health, the aims are given from GTP, MDG and Bank priorities.  The 
WB programs will promote GOE efforts to raise the girls/boys ratio for both primary and 
secondary education enrolment and completion. Given the potential for adult education for 
women, skill development/strengthening programs (e.g., vocational and entrepreneurial training) 
for women will be promoted. In health, continued efforts to reduce fertility will be prioritized 
together with interventions that are credible for reducing maternal mortality ratios. Women’s 
entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as an important untapped source of economic 
growth. The Bank will build on the experiences from WEDP and the emerging research in the 
area to further support growth-oriented women and men micro and small enterprise owners. In 
access to justice the main opportunity for the Bank is to support enforcement of existing laws 
and regulations. Bank in collaboration with the Government and other development partners will 
consider supporting low-level low-cost business dispute resolution mechanisms, for both women 
and men.  

14. 
The Bank will intensify its AAA to assist the GoE to deliver on its national gender 
commitments and improve on its gender equality indicators. There is a clear need for more 
rigorous impact evaluations to inform the design of programs in a range of Bank supported 
programs. Continued assistance will be provided to support the collection of sex-disaggregated 
data. The Bank is currently conducting studies of Access to Justice of Poor and Vulnerable 
Groups in Addis Ababa to inform the future engagement. There are substantial knowledge gaps 
on the impacts of supporting female income generation and under the WEDP a rigorous impact 
evaluation will be undertaken.

Appendix 7: Mainstreaming Climate Change into WB Program 

1. 
The Government and the Bank regard climate change and variability as an 
important challenge for Ethiopia. As the Government puts it in its Vision of a Climate 
Resilient Green Economy (CRGE): “Ethiopia did not cause climate change, but we are 
confronted by the threat that it poses, and should recognize the opportunity that it presents. 
Climate change is not a future possibility for Ethiopia, it is a present reality.” 

2. 
Ethiopia’s climate is changing and expected to change further at unprecedented 
rates. Ethiopia has become warmer over the past century and, as predicted by most climate 
change models, human induced climate change will bring further warming, likely associated 
with heat waves and higher evapotranspiration. While there is uncertainty about future rainfall 
amounts, rainfall variability is predicted to increase further, likely leading to more droughts and 
floods and other challenging impacts. 

3. 
Ethiopia is highly vulnerable to climate change and variability. Roughly 85 percent 
of the population are living in rural areas and are heavily dependent on rainfed agriculture; 
about 10 percent of the population is chronically food-insecure and several million more people 
fall into transitory food insecurity each year; more than a third of all Ethiopians fall under the 
food-poverty line (2010/11). The threat to this population from further climate variability and 
climate change is high. As stated in the WB report “Economics of Adaptation to Climate 
Change “: “Ethiopia is heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture, and its geographical location 
and topography in combination with low adaptive capacity entail a high vulnerability to the 
impacts of climate change.” While the threat from droughts and floods on agriculture might 
lead to the largest and most acute impacts, Ethiopia is also vulnerable in terms of other sectors 
including water, transport, industry, energy, health and in terms of its environmental resources.  

4. 
Ethiopia has also significant mitigation potential and GoE aim is a carbon neutral 
growth trajectory. This is emphasized by the Government it the CRGE Vision. Its Green 
Economy Strategy is based on four pillars including (i) improved crop and livestock practices; 
(ii) forestry; (iii) renewable energy; and (iv) “leapfrogging to modern and energy-efficient 
technologies in transport, industrial sectors, and buildings.” A major emphasis will have to be 
on agriculture and forestry, which “contribute around 45% and 25% respectively to projected 
GHG emission levels under business-as-usual assumptions and together account for around 80% 
of the total abatement potential.” Given the ambitious CRGE agenda, changes will be required 
in policies, regulations and institutions as well as program designs and financial support. 

5. 
This CPS addressed climate change as a cross-cutting issue. It sees climate change as 
a challenge and opportunity to be addressed as part of and integrated into the development 
process, and the Bank’s support to the development process as outlined under the two pillars 
(Fostering Competitiveness & Employment; Enhanced Resilience & Reduced Vulnerabilities) 
and various sectors of this CPS. This is in line with the CRGE and how climate change aspects 
are being integrated into the GTP. 

6. 
Consequently, this CPS first and foremost emphasizes the Bank’s support to key 
sectors of crucial importance to climate change, including agricultural and pastoral 

Page 114 

 
 
 
 
 
 
development, sustainable land management and food security, and renewable energy. 
Supporting the development of these sectors are expected to lead to ‘win-wins’, i.e., an 
economic development that is making the country and its people more resilient and that is 
‘green’ (low-carbon). In addition, the Bank is planning to undertaken work focusing on 
climate change. It will build on its work specific to climate change during the past CAS period7 
and further strengthen its support to Government’s demands including: 
 Further strengthen the Bank’s climate change focus under this CPS. Specifically, it is 
proposed to strengthen the systematic and enhanced treatment of climate impacts at the 
strategic level. This would build on a framework that will be developed for IDA-16 based 
on selected case studies. Specifically, the work would help to provide climate change impact 
analysis at the strategic level, propose sector guidelines for 3 climate sensitive sectors: 
agriculture, water, and roads infrastructure, and seek to develop an institutional assessment 
tool (or scorecard) which will allow Ethiopia to understand their capacity needs and gaps. 
This work could provide further strategic direction and, 
therefore, enhance 
the 
mainstreaming of climate resilience during implementation of this CPS. 
 Support and actively engage in the CRGE initiatives. In particular through its engagement 
with line agencies, the Bank will support the development of the Government’s Climate 
Resilient Strategy.8 During the CPS period, the Bank also plans to support the “I-Planning” 
(implementation and investment-planning) progress led by the Government. In particular, 
we put a strong emphasis in engaging with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of 
Water and Energy and other relevant line agencies as well as the Regions in strengthening 
the integration of the I-Planning process with the development strategies and plan of the 
various sectors.  
 Support the Government in making the Bank-supported investment portfolio more ‘climate-
smart’. In particular, climate change acting at spatial and temporal scales has implications, 
including on the interactions and trade-offs within and between sectors. The Bank’s 
engagement in the “I-Planning” process is crucial for this ‘mainstreaming’ of climate 
change into the development processes and the Bank’s portfolio. In addition, we strengthen 
our engagement in specific studies and trials under ongoing or for future projects and 
programs with the aim to modify their design for an increased climate change impact. 
Examples are the work already started to make the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) 
more response to the challenges and opportunities of climate change, and the planned work 
to do the same for the Sustainable Land Management Program (SLMP) and the Agricultural 
Growth Program (AGP).  
 Continue engaging in few climate change-specific tasks such as climate information systems 
or other specific AAA products or supporting the agenda on Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). However, as much as possible, these 
activities will also be integrated into and supporting the Government’s and Bank-supporting 
‘development’ interventions.  

7 Examples include the Humbo Assisted Natural Regeneration Project assisted by the BioCabon Fund, the Scaling 
Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries (SREP) for Ethiopia or the AAA work on economic adaptation to 
climate change referred to above. 
8 The CR Strategy will complement the already existing GE Strategy and is expected to be completed before the end 
of 2012.

Annex 6: Ethiopia Country Financing Parameters 

Item 

Para-
meter 

Remarks/Explanation 

Cost Sharing 
Limit on the proportion of individual 
project costs that the Bank may 
finance 

Up to 
100% 

Recurrent Cost Financing 
Any limits that would 
apply to the overall 
amount of recurrent 
expenditures that the Bank may 
finance 

No 
country
-level 
limit. 

The actual financing share will be determined during the preparation of each new 
project, and will typically be around 90% of total project costs. Bank financing 
up to 100% will apply selectively to individual projects, on a case-by-case 
merit/justification basis, including operations supporting reform efforts and 
addressing most basic human development needs, including but not necessarily 
limited to food security and safety nets, health, education, rural water supply, and 
HIV/AIDS. Higher than average share of Bank financing could be applied to 
specific CDD projects, IDF grants, and others where the in-kind contribution by 
beneficiaries is difficult to measure. The strong emphasis on borrower ownership 
to individual projects will continue. 
In determining Bank financing of recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank 
will take into account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels, 
including implied future budgetary outlays. The approach to recurrent cost 
financing will be the following. First, project costing in the PAD will specifically 
include estimates of recurrent costs implications, and will outline what are the 
plans to phase out Bank financing of recurrent costs, and phase in Government’s 
absorption of these costs, when the project is finished. In sectors where a 
tax/user-fee arrangement is considered essential for sustainability (e.g., roads), 
the Bank will also take this into account in determining appropriateness and level 
of recurrent cost financing. Second, the project will include a brief explanation of 
the relative share of recurrent costs, per year, compared to the most recent 
recurrent expenditure information for the sector where the project will be located. 
Third, the aggregate of recurrent costs estimated in the whole portfolio will be 
examined within the context of the overall composition of public expenditure, 
during the annual review of the national budget. This examination will focus on 
fiscal sustainability issues, and the schedule of progressively integrating the share 
of Bank financing of recurrent costs into the MEFF to show how Government 
will absorb these costs (implied future budgetary outlays), as Bank financed 
projects reach completion. The Bank will continue to monitor the overall fiscal 
and debt situation, in coordination with the IMF, and as part of the institutional 
processes around the PRSP (APR-JSAN, JBAR, PRSCs, and country strategies). 

Local Cost Financing 
Are the requirements for Bank 
financing of local expenditures met, 
namely that: (i) financing 
requirements for the country’s 
development program would exceed 
the public sector’s own resources 
(e.g., from taxation and other 
revenues) and expected domestic 
borrowing;  and (ii) the financing of 
foreign expenditures alone would 
not enable the Bank to assist in the 
financing of individual projects 

Yes 

Ethiopia meets the two requirements for local cost financing. The Bank can 
finance local costs in any proportions required by individual projects. 

Taxes and Duties 
Are there any taxes and duties that 
the Bank would not finance? 

The Bank may finance the costs of taxes and duties associated with project 
expenditures, as there are currently no taxes that are deemed to be unreasonable 
or discriminatory. The final decision, however, will rest at the project level, when 
the project team assesses whether taxes and duties specific to the project 
activities financed constitute an excessively high share of project costs. 
NOTE: The country financing parameters for Ethiopia set out below have been approved by the Regional Vice President, Africa 
Region, and are being posted on the Bank’s internal website. Date: February 2, 2006 Currently the country financing parameters for 
Ethiopia are being reviewed.
