EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1. 
Guatemala has a rich cultural heritage and considerable economic potential, but a 
challenging history of conflict and exclusion. The country has made progress in consolidating 
democratic institutions since the end of the 36 year civil war in the mid-1990s.  Economic and 
social challenges remain, however, including achieving higher and more equitable growth.  With 
51 percent of its population living in poverty, Guatemala urgently needs to accelerate growth and 
ensure it is more inclusive.  
2. 
The country is the largest economy in Central America with a GDP of US$46.9 billion 
(2011).  A moderate long-term rate of economic growth of 3.3 percent between 2001 and 2011, 
has translated into a GNI per capita of US$2,741 (2010).  However Guatemala is one of the most 
unequal countries in Latin America.  Chronic malnutrition among children under five years of 
age reached 49.8 percent (2008/09), and is particularly pervasive among the indigenous 
population, who represent half the nation’s 14 million inhabitants. 
3. 
To address development challenges, the Pérez Molina Administration, elected in 
November 2011, has outlined an ambitious reform agenda centered on three “pacts” to address: 
(i) fiscal reform; (ii) Zero Hunger (Hambre Cero); and (iii) security, peace and justice.  The 
approval by Congress in February 2012 of a fiscal reform marks a historic achievement as it 
represents the first comprehensive reform of the tax system in twenty years. The Zero Hunger 
pact launched in March of 2012 has the target of reducing the incidence of malnutrition in 
children under the age of five over the next four years. The Pact for Security, Peace and Justice is 
critical given that rising levels of crime and violence represent an increasingly daunting 
development challenge.  A further priority focus is on improving the nation’s competitiveness to 
promote more and better job opportunities, as delineated in the National Competitiveness 
Agenda 2012-2021.  
4. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) is supporting the Government’s efforts to enhance the 
country’s long-term growth potential and move toward a more equitable society. This proposed 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-16 includes two strategic objectives: (i) to 
strengthen public policies for social development; and (ii) to promote inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth.  The themes of citizen security and gender are central to the country’s 
development and, as such, are mainstreamed into CPS activities.  
5. 
In supporting the two strategic objectives and transversal themes, the World Bank and the 
IFC will rely on their comparative strengths.  The Bank will build on its past engagement in 
promoting an efficient public sector with emphasis on improving results in the social sectors.  
The Bank and the IFC will work together with Government in a renewed effort to support 
competitiveness and sustainable growth. 
6. 
This CPS sets out a new approach for the Bank’s engagement in Guatemala.  The 
combination of a simpler design, modest objectives, emphasis on knowledge products, tight 
alignment with Government manifested priorities and close coordination with the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) represents a departure from previous CPS strategies and draws heavily 
from lessons learned from past CPS implementation. In delivering results, the Bank will employ 
a suite of products and will determine specific instruments and sequencing as the dialogue with 
Government evolves. The WBG will also seek to strengthen its partnership with other 
development partners and stakeholders in support of the Government’s agenda.  Regional 
initiatives, in particular with respect to citizen security and trade integration, also represent an 

1 

 
 
important Bank contribution to Guatemala. The Progress Report will provide the opportunity to 
take stock of this new approach, including the role of knowledge services, budget support and 
intensive use of non-lending technical assistance. 
7. 
The WBG program is selective and includes a modest approach to results commensurate 
with the relatively small size of the Bank portfolio. The current portfolio will contribute to 
delivery of outcomes, particularly during the first half of the CPS period.   The seven projects 
under implementation with around US$200 million of undisbursed funds will be a key driver of 
results, particularly under the first strategic objective.  New lending, estimated at US$525 
million, will further contribute to results through a mix of DPL, investment lending and possibly 
guarantees. Support for further fiscal strengthening and results-based budgeting will come 
through a DPL series of US$350 million for FY13 and FY14.  
8. 
In line with a stronger focus on knowledge activities, WBG engagement emphasizes 
building national capacity to design and implement more effective social and economic policies. 
This will be done through strategic non-lending technical assistance packages in support of the 
key Government priorities that, jointly with the DPL program, will open new spaces of 
cooperation. The Progress Report will provide an opportunity to review this approach and fine-
tune the results framework.  
9. 
The CPS program design is informed by a candid discussion of risks. To address these 
risks, the Bank will intensify its dialogue with key stakeholders, including Congress, to minimize 
delays in effectiveness and will choose entry points for lending carefully. The Bank will also 
work closely with the IDB to address shared obstacles to implementation.  Support for social 
assistance programs, including for better targeting and results, will help mitigate the impact of 
potential economic shocks and natural disasters on the poor. Finally, the CPS program takes first 
steps to mitigate the high costs that crime and violence exact on development. The CPS approach 
aligns its evolving strategy with the Government’s own vision to contain crime through the 
provision of better services and creation of opportunities, particularly for youth, thus 
complementing the work of other development partners, particularly the IDB, that follow the 
same strategic direction.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Guatemala has a rich cultural heritage and considerable economic potential, but a 
challenging history of conflict and exclusion. The country is the largest economy in Central 
America with a GDP of US$46.9 billion (2011), a GNI per capita of US$2,741 (2010) and an 
average growth of 3.3 percent between 2001 and 2011.  Economic performance has been 
relatively stable compared to the rest of Latin America, as a result of prudent macroeconomic 
policies. While the country has made progress in consolidating democratic institutions since the 
end of the 36-year civil war in the mid-1990s, shortfalls in responding to economic and social 
challenges, including crime and violence, and in achieving more equitable economic growth, 
have affected the population’s trust in the state’s capacity to deliver on its basic functions.  
2. With 51 percent of its population living in poverty, Guatemala urgently needs to 
accelerate growth and ensure it is more inclusive. Despite its middle income status, 
Guatemala is one of the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin America, and social 
indicators are low compared to countries of similar income levels. Over half the population falls 
below the poverty line and the country ranks third lowest in Latin America, according to 
UNDP’s 2011 Human Development Index. Poverty and low social indicators are particularly 
troubling among the indigenous population, who represent half the nation’s 14 million 
inhabitants.  
3. 
The Government and the World Bank Group (WBG) have agreed on a four-year 
program of engagement designed to help Guatemala enhance its long-term growth 
potential and move toward a more equitable society. This proposed Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS) for FY13-16 supports government reform priorities to strengthen social 
development outcomes and reorient the country’s growth pattern to a more sustainable, inclusive 
trajectory. The themes of citizen security and governance, as well as gender, are central to the 
country’s development and will be mainstreamed into CPS activities. In line with a stronger 
focus on knowledge activities, WBG engagement emphasizes building national capacity to 
design and implement more effective social and economic policies. This CPS has been prepared 
jointly with IFC and was designed in close collaboration with the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IDB).  

II.COUNTRY CONTEXT, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK 

Political Developments 
4. 
Guatemala has made progress in building democratic institutions and consolidating 
peace since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996, with regular elections and transfer of 
power between political parties. In recent years, the country has taken steps to ensure political 
stability, including the peaceful transition to the Government of Otto Pérez Molina in January 
2012, following the administration of Álvaro Colom of the Unión Nacional de la Esperanza 
party. President Pérez Molina was elected on a platform emphasizing aggressive measures to 
address high levels of crime and violence, strengthen and institutionalize social programs, such 
as the conditional cash transfer Bono Seguro, and promote employment through competitiveness 
reforms, including increasing international trade and improving infrastructure.

5. 
The fragmented party system contributes to political inertia and weak legislative 
capacity. In Guatemala, no governing party has ever secured re-election, and the average life 
expectancy of a political party is only 7.6 years. More than 50 parties have been declared void 
since democratization in 1985 and, as a result, few legislators have prior parliamentary 
experience. This phenomenon exacerbates the Government’s weak technical capacity. More than 
25 percent of congressional representatives have switched parties each year over the last decade 
on average; and more than 40 percent switched parties between 2004 and 2007. Volatility and 
fragmentation promotes short political time horizons and creates disincentives for long-term 
national planning beyond the single four-year elected term.   
6. 
The political panorama remains challenged by institutional weakness and contested 
authority between the executive and legislative branches. The current Government’s party has 
the largest share in Congress, but only holds 62 out 158 seats. The absence of a majority in 
Congress poses a challenge for garnering political support for the administration’s public policy 
agenda. Despite the quick passage of the fiscal reform in early 2012, the subsequent paralysis of 
Congress has slowed the transition process and affected popular support for the new 
administration’s reform program, much of which has not yet materialized. The Government will 
need to overcome these collective action problems to effectively design and implement public 
policies for economic and social development. 
          Poverty and Inequality Profile 
7. 
Changes in poverty levels in the last decade were moderate, as the economic 
slowdown rolled back earlier gains. Between 2000 and 2006, poverty decreased by five 
percentage points in spite of low per capita growth. This positive trend reversed with poverty 
increasing almost three percentage points between 2006 and 2011 as the international crisis 
affected economic growth in Guatemala (Figure 1). Extreme poverty declined slightly from 
15 percent of Guatemalans in 2000 and 2006 to about 13 percent in 2011, with gains in both 
rural and urban areas. However, extreme poverty is still widespread among the rural population, 
where 80 percent of the extreme poor live. Human opportunity indicators have risen, creating a 
solid foundation for future improvements. There is some evidence that social programs have 
protected the poorest, even in the face of declining remittances.

8. 
Rural poverty is higher than urban poverty, but the gap declined somewhat between 
2006 and 2011. Poverty is higher in rural (72 percent) compared to urban (35 percent) areas.   
Overall poverty increased in the last five years, although less in rural areas.  By 2011, out of the 
56 percent of population with expenditures below the poverty line, 32.6 percent lived in urban 

2 

 
 
 
areas and 67.4 percent in rural areas. The depth and severity of poverty (measured by the poverty 
gap) are also higher in rural areas, although they decreased between 2006 and 2011 while 
remaining almost constant in urban areas. This suggests that consumption became more equally 
distributed among the poor in rural areas, which may reflect higher food prices benefitting those 
rural poor who were net sellers.   
9. 
Indigenous people suffer from the highest poverty rates and have the lowest social 
indicators (See Box 1 and Annex 6). Just over half the population of Guatemala was poor in 
2011, but among indigenous groups the poverty rate is 75 percent. This level has not changed 
significantly since 2000, while non-indigenous poverty rates dropped from 48 percent of the 
population in 2000 to 41 percent in 2011. Levels of extreme poverty are also higher for the 
indigenous population (22 percent compared to 7.6 for non-indigenous in 2011), although both 
rates have fallen in the last decade (down from 25 percent among the indigenous and 11.5 
percent for the non-indigenous). 

Box 1.  The Indigenous Communities of Guatemala 

Guatemala’s population is very culturally diverse, with one of the highest shares of indigenous peoples in Latin America. 
About 40 percent of Guatemalans, roughly 4.5 million people, self-identify as indigenous, surpassed only by Bolivia and 
about equal to Peru. The vast majority of indigenous people belong to one of approximately 25 Mayan languages still 
spoken in the country, and descend from the Mayan civilization that built numerous urban centres throughout Guatemala, 
Mexico, Honduras and Belize centuries before the Spanish conquest. Most Mayan-speaking communities are found in the 
western highlands. Smaller populations are found in the southern region of the Boca Costa, and increasingly in Guatemala 
City and other urban areas. The most common languages are Q'eqchi, Cakchiquel, Mam, Tzutujil and Achi (Maya). The 
Xinka are a distinct indigenous group mainly in the south-east of the country, whose language is not descended from the 
Mayan languages. The Garifuna people, who comprise 4 percent of the population, are an Afro-Caribbean ethnic group 
found also in Honduras and Belize, and live in villages on Guatemala’s Caribbean coast. 

Indigenous people in Guatemala have faced a long history of social and economic exclusion. During the civil war, many 
indigenous communities in the western highlands were caught in the conflict between the military and the armed 
insurgency, resulting in almost 200,000 deaths, thousands of disappearances and over a million displaced. The 1996 Peace 
Accords that ended the conflict formally recognized that Guatemala consists of four distinct ethnic groups—Maya, Xinka, 
Garifuna and Ladino—and also subscribed the country to the ILO’s Convention 169 relating to indigenous peoples. A 
national referendum was held in 1999 on incorporating certain rights specific to indigenous communities into the 
constitution, but it was defeated. Many human rights groups contend that despite legal protections, discriminatory 
practices still limit the participation of indigenous people in economic, social and political life. One area that has shown 
progress is bilingual education, with hundreds of programs in rural areas teaching children in their mother tongue.  

See also Annex 6. 

10. 
 Guatemala has made significant progress on inequality measures, although 
inequality remains high. The Gini coefficient for consumption inequality declined between 
2000 and 2006 from 0.47 to 0.45, and then dropped steeply to 0.39 by 2011. The wealthiest 
10 percent of the population had consumption levels more than 10 times higher than the poorest 
10 percent, which is a marked improvement from the 18 times registered in 2000.  
11. 
Progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 
Guatemala has been uneven, with some goals advancing rapidly and others lagging. 
Overall, Guatemala is close on reaching MDGs in infant mortality, access to prenatal healthcare, 
TB incidence rate and primary enrollment, but has to accelerate progress in primary education 
completion, gender gaps and maternal mortality (Table 1). One goal showing considerable 
improvement was the increase in net primary enrollment, which reached 95.8 percent by 2011, 
up by 24 percentage points in the last 20 years. As well, the share of students finishing primary 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
school rose 34 percentage points and the literacy rate 15 percentage points over the same time 
period. Guatemala reduced the infant mortality rate from 110 to 42 per 1,000 live births from 
1987 to 2009 and the maternal mortality rate from 248 to 140 for every 100,000 live births. 
However these indicators are still above the Latin American average and the latter indicator is far 
from the goal of 62 per 100,000 live births. Progress improving healthcare can be observed in the 
reduction of malaria from 7.4 to 0.9 per 1,000 inhabitants between 2003 and 2009 and important 
improvements in HIV/AIDS, TB and vector-borne diseases. Efforts to improve the efficiency 
and coordination of social spending—supported by activities in this proposed CPS—would 
accelerate progress to meeting the MDGs.

The rising presence of crime and violence poses a growing threat to the country’s 
development potential in the region, and impacts Government’s capacity to reduce poverty.  
Crime and violence has risen dramatically in the post-conflict period.  The homicide rate nearly 
doubled during the 2000s, from 24.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1999 to 47 in 2006. Although it 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
has since declined to 39 in 2011, it is still well above the Central American average of 29—itself 
the highest rate of any sub region in the world—and far higher than the world average of 6.9 per 
100,000. With an annual average of 6,000 homicides per year, Guatemala now has the seventh 
highest homicide rate in the world.  The country’s rising crime and violence rates impose a high 
developmental cost on both the individual and national level, and as a result has become a 
critical development issue facing the country (see Box 2).  

Box 2.  Crime and Violence – Effects on Citizen Security 

Crime and violence has become the strongest destabilizing factor for political, social and economic life in 
Guatemala. Despite the end to the armed conflict, homicide rates have nearly doubled during the 2000s, from 24.2 per 100,000 
in 1999 to 46.3 in 2009, with an average of 6000 homicides per year (equal to the number of homicides in the entire European 
Union, which has a population 36 times larger than Guatemala’s).  According to a national report, UNDP sites that in 
Guatemala there is a 9 percent probability that a person does not live beyond 30 years of age. Victimization levels (including 
robbery, kidnapping, extortion, car theft etc.) are high and continue to rise. Overall victimization by violent crime rate was 23.3 
percent in 2010 compared to 12.8 in 2004. Both the economic and human cost of rising crime and violence is staggering. When 
accounting for the costs in health, law enforcement, public security and personal damage, violence cost the country an 
estimated USD 2.4 billion, or 7.3 percent of GDP – more than double the cost of damage caused by Hurricane Stan. 
Businessmen identify crime as the prime obstacle to doing business.  

The drivers of crime and violence include the lucrative nature of drug trafficking and Guatemala’s prime geographic 
position as a transport country, and the deportation of transnational youth gang member from US prisons since the mid-1990s, 
which contribute to the proliferation of youth gangs in Guatemala. This situation is compounded by institutional weakness in 
law enforcement and the penal system, which have not been able to cope with the surge in violence. The civil war also 
contributed to making Guatemala the country with the highest estimated rate of gun ownership in Central America with 
approximately 16 guns per 100 people, significantly higher than El Salvador (7) and Honduras (6.2) whose homicides rates 
exceed Guatemala’s. The pattern of inequitable socio-economic development has also created an increasingly disaffected 
segment of the civilian population which is vulnerable to criminalization.  

Reducing violence and improving citizen security has been at the top of the policy agenda over the last three 
administrations. Yet despite these efforts, which include substantial budget increases for security (50 percent) and justice (30 
percent) between 2006 and 2010, significant gains have been elusive. For instance, since 2009 homicide rates have been begun 
to decline (38.5 in 2011), but other crimes, such as robbery and assault, have risen; thus contributing to strong citizen 
perception of violence. Given the complexity of these issues and the recent examples of Colombia and Mexico, it is likely that 
the fight against crime will be exceedingly costly and long lasting. However, until this is obstacle is tackled and an integral 
solution is implemented, growth and development gains will remain in jeopardy. 

Economic Context, Recent Economic Developments and Growth Outlook 
13. 
Economic growth has been stable but weak in the past two decades. Since 1990, real 
GDP growth per capita has averaged 1.2 percent, about three-quarters of a percentage point less 
than the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean and significantly less than other middle-income 
countries. Volatility was less than half the regional average, and the country experienced less of 
an economic decline during the recent crisis. Much of Guatemala’s relative stability can be 
attributed to prudent macroeconomic policies that have kept inflation and public debt 
manageable, while avoiding fiscal imbalances that have affected much of the region.  
14. 
A low level of revenue mobilization has constrained the ability of the state to steer 
development and social policy. Guatemala has one of the lowest tax revenues in the region, and 
the lowest per capita spending on social sectors. At around 11 percent of GDP, Guatemala’s tax-
to-GDP ratio is well below the Central American average of 13.3 percent, and far lower than the 
19.2 percent average for all of Latin America. While other countries with low tax-to-GDP ratios, 
including Mexico and Panama, have significant non-tax revenue sources, Guatemala does not. 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
As a result, total central Government revenues have been below 13 percent of GDP in the past 

decade.

Impact of the of the 2008-2009 Global Crisis 
15. 
The global financial crisis, and in particular the U.S. recession, impacted the 
Guatemalan economy. Remittances dropped sharply in the wake of the 2008 crisis, in large part 
due to the economic slowdown in the U.S., which accounts for 91 percent of Guatemalan 
remittances. At 11 percent of GDP on average between 2006 and 2010, remittances have 
represented an important revenue source, especially for poorer households, accounting for 
30 percent of household income for the poorest quintile. As a result of the sharp fall in 
remittances, the collapse in consumption and investment and reduced foreign demand, 
Guatemala’s GDP growth was 0.5 percent in 2009. The slowdowns affected all sectors, with 
manufacturing, construction and retail the most impacted.  

6 

 
 
 
 
16. 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) had been rising steadily prior to the 2008 crisis, and 
then fell sharply in 2009. FDI inflows increased from US$498 million in 2001 to 
US$754 million in 2008. The crisis led to a 20 percent decline in 2009. A quarter of FDI comes 
from the U.S., while another 55 percent is roughly equally divided between the UK, Spain, 
Canada, Mexico, Honduras and Brazil. FDI has been concentrated in the areas of food and 
beverages, textiles, retail and mining, and more recently in finance.    
17. 
The slowdown in economic activities worsened the fiscal situation. As a consequence 
of the crisis, central government revenues dropped significantly while expenditures increased 
(Table 2). Tax revenues fell from 11.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 10.3 percent in 2009, as the 
narrow tax base dropped significantly.  During the crisis, revenue from VAT suffered due to 
lower imports and domestic demand. At the same time, the Government boosted expenditure in 
social sectors, which contributed to an increase in expenditures from 13.6 percent of GDP in 
2008 to 14.2 in 2009. The overall fiscal deficit widened from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 
3.1 percent in 2009 while the debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 20.1 to 22.9 percent.  
Economic Recovery 
18. 
Economic growth recovered after 2009 and tax revenues improved. Guatemala’s 
GDP grew by 2.9 percent in 2010 and increased to 3.9 percent in 2011. Private consumption and 
a stable recovery of credit to the private sector since 2010 have been the main drivers of 
economic growth. 2010 also saw a recovery in FDI, which had been affected in 2009. Income tax 
revenues increased from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.8 percent in 2011. VAT and import tax 
revenues declined during 2009 and, although they have increased, they are still not at pre-crisis 
levels. Overall indirect tax revenues increased to 7.6 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 from 
7.2 percent in 2009, driven by a rise in consumption. Total tax revenues increased to 11 percent 
of GDP in 2011 but are still below the 2001-2007 average of 11.6 percent.  
19. 
Despite an increase in expenditures during the crisis, public debt levels remain 
reasonable.  Since 2009 revenues have increased in line with economic recovery. However, 
government expenditure increased during the crisis in 2009, and in 2010 and 2011 in part due to 
finance reconstruction following a series of natural disasters.1 The increase in current 
expenditure was largely permanent and associated to the new social spending programs. Total 
expenditure increased from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 14.7 percent in 2011. Consequently, 
the overall fiscal deficit in 2011 reached 2.8 percent of GDP, above the pre-crisis level of 1.6 in 
2008. Given this increase, public debt increased from 20.1 percent of GDP prior to 2008 to 
24.3 percent in 2011, but still remains manageable. Domestic debt accounts for about half of 
total debt (12.3 percent of GDP), while the remainder is made up of loans from multilateral and 
bilateral creditors, as well as Eurobonds issued in 2003, 2004 and 2012.  
20. 
The Government does not currently have an IMF program in place. The last Stand-
By Arrangement (US$951 million) was treated as precautionary and was successfully completed 
in October 2010. While the Government does not currently foresee the need for a new IMF 
program, relations with the institution remain close. An Article IV mission was successfully 
completed in April 2012. The Staff Report stressed the importance of improving public 

1  
Between May and September 2010, Guatemala experienced a large volcanic eruption and a tropical storm, which 
caused an estimated US$1.6 billion (4 percent of GDP) in damages.

expenditure management, especially with a view to preparing for a potential new crisis. In the 
medium term, boosting economic growth and reducing poverty remain the main challenges. 

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability  

21. 
The Guatemalan economy is likely to continue on a path to recovery, but remains 
vulnerable. Due to the uncertain dynamics of the U.S. and European economies and structural 
shortcomings, GDP is currently projected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2012 and 3.2 percent in 
2013, down from 3.9 percent in 2011 (Table 3). Inflation increased to 6.2 percent in 2011, due to 
higher international commodity prices and the impact of natural disasters, but is likely to remain 
under control in the medium term. Following an expected drop in commodity prices, inflation is 
projected to be 5 percent in 2012 and remain around 4.2 for the 2013-2016 period. 
22. 
Despite the 2009 recession, the financial system remains well-capitalized and liquid. 
After a substantial decrease as a result of the 2008 subprime crisis, credit to the private sector 
began to recover in 2011. Although credit growth rates are still below pre-crisis levels, they are 
now positive after a year of decreasing credit in 2010. Lending rates declined slightly at the 
beginning of 2010 but remained stable in 2011, pointing to a recovery of lending in the banking 
sector. At 14.7 percent, the capital adequacy ratio was higher in 2011 than before the 2008 crisis 
(13.6 percent in 2005), while the ratio of non-performing loans to total gross loans decreased to 
2 percent by 2011. Liquidity in the financial sector has continued to improve since 2007, with 
liquid assets to deposits and short-term funding reaching 33.2 percent in 2010.  
23. 
The current account deficit is expected to increase and then remain stable in the 
medium term. The current account posted a deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2011, higher than 
the 1.5 percent reported in 2010. Exports have increased by 23 percent, driven by a recovery in 
import demand in the United States and higher coffee prices, while imports have grown by 
20 percent in the same period. Tepid growth in the global economy is expected to halt the 
recovery in imports and exports in 2012 and 2013. Easing commodity prices would result in 
small deterioration of the trade balance during this period, due to the importance of agricultural 
commodities in Guatemala’s export basket. International capital flows are expected to remain 
broadly constant as a share of GDP. 
24. 
Important tax policy and administrative measures in 2012 will have positive 
medium- and long-term impacts. Administrative measures aimed at improving tax collection, 
strengthening tax enforcement and fighting tax evasion have been implemented over the last few 
years. In addition, the significant tax policy reform which was enacted in February 2012 is 
expected to increase revenues by 1.3 percent of GDP by 2015. This will create fiscal space for 
additional spending on government priorities. Following the expected increase in revenues and a 
stable expenditure path, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to drop from 1.3 percent of GDP in 
2011 to 0.7 percent in 2012 and 0.5 in 2013.

25. 
A 2012 Eurobond issue was received positively by the international market. In May 
2012, the Finance Ministry issued US$700 million in bonds in the international market at a rate 
of 5.75 percent, the first international issue since 2004. The global bond was given a BB+ rating 
from Fitch (one notch below investment grade). In recent years, Guatemala had relied heavily on 
the local bond market and multilateral and bilateral loans for financing. Under conservative 
assumptions, Guatemala’s public debt will remain sustainable in the medium term. While total 
public debt is projected to increase from 24.1 percent of GDP in 2011 to 25.6 percent in 2015, it 
is expected to stabilize below 26 percent thereafter. While the overall debt panorama is stable, it 
could be impacted by Government use of domestic floating debt, which is not fully transparent. 

9 

 
 
 
 
26. 
Long-term growth of 3 percent is not enough for Guatemala to make significant 
progress towards its development goals. Limited state capacity has been detrimental to long-
term growth prospects as it has resulted in lower public investment, lack of modern infrastructure 
as well as limited spending in building up the human capital of the country.  Efforts to create 
fiscal space by mobilizing more domestic sources of financing or revenues would help address 
this constraint.  Investing in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life is critical to make a difference in 
terms of the potential for future growth and development.  While other efforts to promote 
investment, including reaching a consensus on long-term planning and addressing binding 
constraints including security are important, without improving human capital from birth 
significant productivity gains will remain elusive. 

III.  GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

Government Program 

27. 
The Pérez Molina administration has outlined an ambitious development agenda.   
The administration was elected on a platform based around five pillars: (i) Social Development; 
(ii) Competitive Economic Growth; (iii) Productive and Social Infrastructure for Development; 
(iv) Sustainable Rural Infrastructure for Development; and (v) Justice and Democratic Security. 
Since taking office, the Government has established a strategy to implement its development 
agenda through three “pacts” on: (i) fiscal reform; (ii) Zero Hunger (Hambre Cero); and 
(iii) security, peace and justice. A further priority focus is on improving the nation’s 
competitiveness to promote more and better job opportunities, as delineated in the National 
Competitiveness Agenda 2012-2021.  
28. 
The fiscal reform presented to Congress and approved in February 2012 is an 
important milestone.  It includes two key legislative initiatives.  The first is an anti-evasion law 
that builds on an existing law to further strengthen the role of the tax authority (SAT) to control 
and audit VAT payments and personal income tax, and includes measures to reduce the informal 
economy by incorporating small VAT taxpayers into the system. The second legislative initiative 
is the first comprehensive tax policy reform approved since 1992, and includes reforms to both 
corporate and personal income tax, eliminates VAT credit, reduces deductions and includes 
transfer pricing. The law also includes reforms to the custom administration that require the 
application of regional regulations and strengthens the capacity of the customs authority to fight 
contraband and customs fraud.   
29. 
The Zero Hunger Pact is the focal point of the Government’s social policy and 
addresses chronic childhood malnutrition.  Although childhood malnutrition has long been an 
issue in Guatemala, this is the first time it has become the focus of a national dialogue.  The Zero 
Hunger program launched in March of 2012 has the target of reducing the incidence of 
malnutrition in children under the age of five by 10 percent over the next four years. The 
Government has targeted municipalities that will receive training, microcredit and foodstuffs.  In 
addition, the targeted municipalities are the priority beneficiaries of public sector infrastructure 
projects, principally roads, designed to promote economic development. There is an emphasis on 
the development of self-sustaining agricultural practices to improve nutrition in rural areas. Such 
support is vital to address poverty, particularly in rural areas. This broad program addresses 

10 

 
 
 
challenges in all five of the Government’s pillars. The Ministries of Social Development, 
Education, Health and the Secretariat for Food Security implement the program.   
30. 
Addressing the high levels of crime and violence is the cornerstone of the 
administration’s strategy and is embodied in the Pact for Security, Peace and Justice.  
Announced in May 2012, it is the most recent of the three pacts and its objective is to reduce risk 
factors at all levels of society. Starting at the household level with Safe Homes, the pact focuses 
on preventing violence through ensuring basic needs (potable water, sanitation and electricity), 
and guaranteeing rights. The Safe Municipalities Plan focuses on improving the socioeconomic 
conditions of municipalities to promote social peace.  The Government also plans to establish an 
observatory to improve monitoring of violence indicators. A special inter-institutional cabinet 
has been created to assist in implementation as well as a permanent civil society forum to 
provide feedback. The Government’s emphasis on prevention is seen as an important 
complement to its efforts on enforcement.   
Development Challenges 
31. 
Successive administrations have struggled to deliver higher rates of economic 
growth, with limited success. With high poverty rates, the formal sector providing jobs for less 
than 40 percent of the labor force and the working age population projected to expand from 
7.8 million in 2010 to 9 million in 2015, Guatemala urgently needs to accelerate its growth rate. 
It also needs to ensure that growth is inclusive to generate enough good quality jobs and narrow 
income disparities. Fully integrating the rural population in terms of economic opportunities and 
improving social outcomes remains a challenge.  In the last two decades a number of initiatives 
have been launched to coordinate development but results have been slow to materialize.  These 
initiatives, however, have not been embedded in a convincing long-term growth strategy that 
enjoys the backing of the powerful private sector and the taxpayers who would finance any 
expansion of the state’s role.   
32. 
In order to stimulate growth and compete in the global economy, Guatemala will 
need to diversify markets and products into higher value-added manufacturing and 
services. Guatemala’s export structure has changed slowly over the last ten years, with an 
increasing importance of manufacturing industries, small growth in services and decreasing 
significance of agricultural exports. Nonetheless, the few changes in the top ten products 
exported by Guatemala in the last decade reflect a lack of innovation in business activities. 
Exports amounted to 23 percent of GDP in 2009, with exports of goods reaching US$10.6 billion 
in 202.  Only 42 percent of commodity exports were manufactures, mostly labor-intensive low 
tech and low in domestic value-added, and export diversification is low. Between 2003 and 2008 
Guatemala lost world market share in seven of its 10 top export market products.  
33. 
The share of high and medium technology products has increased, driven by FDI 
locating in Guatemala to service the regional markets. More than 75 percent of Guatemalan 
manufactured exports are low to medium-low technology products, which are characterized by 
intensive use of labor with low skills and education level.3 In absolute terms, however, exports of 
high and medium-high technology are increasing, especially in fields related to pharmaceutical 
products and industrial chemicals, both sectors with strong presence of multinational enterprises 
in Guatemala. Many of these companies selected Guatemala to locate their regional

GDP in 2011 was $48.8 billion. Commodity exports were 21.7 percent of GDP. 
See INCAE (2010).

manufacturing operations to export to other countries in the region. As a result, there is a 
significant differentiation of exports by destination market. Guatemala’s low-technology exports 
go to the U.S. (agricultural and maquila products) while a large share of exports of high and 
medium-high technology products go to neighboring Central American countries.  
34. 
SMEs are responsible for net job creation—80 percent of formal employment is in 
firms with less than 20 workers—and limitations on their entry and growth impinge on 
employment.  Start-ups face considerable bureaucratic obstacles. Guatemala ranked 97 in the 
World Bank’s Doing Business Survey for 2012 (down from 93 in 2011). Starting a new business 
and obtaining construction permits are especially problematic. The absence of a vibrant SME 
sector adversely affects the performance of both manufacturing and services sectors, particularly 
those catering to the needs of the tourism sector (the second-largest source of foreign exchange 
earnings).  
35. 
Developing the agriculture sector in Guatemala has the potential to reduce poverty.  
Economic opportunities in rural areas are limited, especially in indigenous communities, due to 
low human capital, unequal land distribution, lack of credit and inadequate infrastructure. Two 
percent of productive farm units control 65 percent of arable land and indigenous peoples are 
much less likely to hold formal title to their lands, which limits their access to credit and finance. 
Rural transport infrastructure is very poor, isolating many communities from opportunities to 
market their produce, and few productive chains exist between agricultural producers and small 
business to add value and generate greater income in the poorest communities. There is 
significant potential to develop the agricultural sector for high value exports, which in turn 
would benefit small holders, including indigenous people, and promote job creation in agro-
processing for example. The objective of the Inclusive-Green Growth (IGG) agenda is to 
increase the resilience capacity of the most vulnerable rural dwellers to cope with the impacts of 
climate change and external food price shocks.  In addition, production of basic foodstuffs can be 
bolstered to improve resilience in the face of external food price shocks.  
36. 
Electricity supply is insufficient and the costs are among the highest in region.  The 
composition of the generation of energy in Guatemala is primarily hydroelectric (35 percent) and 
fuel-oil (32 percent). Reliability and the cost of service remain key issues. Access to electricity 
has deteriorated. One-quarter of companies interviewed for the 2003 Enterprise Survey indicated 
that access to electricity was a critical issue, but this percentage increased to 47 percent in 2006. 
Outages accounted for an average loss of 6.1 percent of sales in 2007. In rural areas, power 
outages cost up to 6.7 percent of sales and lasted an average of 37 hours per month, compared to 
eight hours in metropolitan areas. Price of electricity is also one of the highest in the region due 
to   the  high marginal costs of generation and due to the fact that Guatemala does not subsidize 
energy as heavily as other Central American countries, such as Nicaragua and Honduras. 
Currently there is a national debate ongoing on how to improve the energy matrix in order to 
respond to the increasing demand for energy.   
37. 
Both for urban and rural populations, inadequate infrastructure and related 
services in key trade corridors are critical obstacles to moving merchandise from 
production areas to final destinations.  Particularly burdensome are trade corridors from the 
agro-industry production areas to borders, airports and ports and from Guatemala City to 
borders, ports and airports. Complementary services such as cold chain infrastructure, 
warehousing and licensing remain inadequate, adding to logistic costs. Customs and border 
management is weak, with poor coordination among agencies (see Box 3). The most serious 

12 

 
 
logistics problem is the high level of insecurity on the roads. According to the World Bank’s 
Logistics Performance Index, Guatemala’s score has improved somewhat between 2007 and 
2012, but is held back from faster improvement by inadequate infrastructure, the lowest sub-
indicator for the LPI in each of the three years it has been calculated.  

Box 3.  Logistics in Central America: The Path to Competitiveness 

A new World Bank regional study analyzes logistics in Central America and the impact in competitiveness from 2008-2001. The 
study indicates that the direct cost of security represents 3 to 4 percent of the total operating costs in trucking companies. From 
2008 to 2011, security costs have increased in Central America, except in Costa Rica, with increases in Guatemala of 32 percent. 
Another issue driving up costs, according to the study, is empty backhauls—in Guatemala, 77 percent of truck trips return empty. 
Poor infrastructure in border crossing affects transportations costs; for example in the San Salvador-San José route idle time 
represents 69 percent of the total time (167 hours). An important challenge for the region is to match the infrastructure stock to 
increase regional competitiveness. For example, in Nicaragua only 9 percent of roads are paved, compared to 14 percent in 
Guatemala, 22 percent in Honduras and 43-54 percent in El Salvador, Panama and Costa Rica. The study identifies a series of 
policy recommendations that could improve the competitiveness of the region, including rigorous and informed planning, 
transparent project execution and more efficient operation of infrastructure resources.

38. 
The low level of trust among ordinary Guatemalans in their state’s ability to 
improve citizen security and transparently manage public resources is a critical obstacle to 
the country’s development prospects. Crime and violence are a constant preoccupation among 
the public, while high-profile cases of corruption and the perception of impunity undermine 
public confidence in judicial authorities. A 2010 Enterprise Survey of nearly 600 Guatemalan 
firms found crime, theft and disorder to be the highest-ranked obstacle to doing business, with 
corruption also reported as a top issue. Crime, violence, impunity and corruption are all mutually 
reinforcing, and are further accentuated by the increasing presence of organized crime groups, 
including narcotics traffickers, kidnapping and extortion rings and violent street gangs (maras).  
39. 
Institutional shortcomings and limited demand from civil society continue to result 
in weak governance and impede anti-corruption efforts, despite some progress in recent 
years. The transparency of the budgeting process is compromised by frequent use of alternate 
vehicles to implement programs, like trust funds, NGOs and contracting under exception. Over 
70 percent of public procurement is done through non-competitive methods. Furthermore, 
instituting the SIAF financial information system and the new Law of Access to Information 
(2009) have not led to a significant increase in demand for such information, despite efforts in 
training journalists, students and other key parts of civil society in the relevant legislation and the 
uses of these systems for carrying out social audits.    
40. Guatemala has the highest child malnutrition rate in Latin America and the 
Caribbean and one of the highest in the world. Chronic malnutrition among children under 
five years of age reached 49.8 percent (2008/09), but rates are as high as 89 percent in some 
indigenous areas. This high rate has a direct impact on child mortality, as well as the intellectual 
and physical development of children – which in turn affects human capital development more 
broadly. Given the limited resource envelope, which is largely a function of low tax revenues, 
the effective and efficient use of the available resources is key for accelerating advances in 
human development outcomes in the coming years 
41. 
The level and quality of human capital are extremely low. Those in the 25-65 year age 
group have less than five years of education on average. Only 7 percent of the population had 
more than 12 years of education in 2006 and just 8.6 percent of the labor force falls in the 
category of technical and professional workers. Teacher credentials are weak, with less than 
13 

 
 
 
 
10 percent of primary school instructors having a bachelor’s degree. Student performance has 
been declining: as of 2009, only 20 percent of 12th graders had satisfactory reading scores and 
30 percent had satisfactory math scores, down from 40 percent and 50 percent respectively in 
2007. The current education and social protection strategies have not addressed extreme income 
inequality, particularly between indigenous and non-indigenous populations.  Well-designed and 
sustained policies in education and social protection could change the country’s growth 
trajectory, but will require additional resources. 
42. 
Achieving a more gender equitable society in Guatemala remains a challenge. The 
country’s progress in this area is lagging both regionally and globally. According to the UNDP 
Development Report, the country ranks 109 out of 187 in the Gender Inequality Index, the 
lowest rank in Central America. In the three gender dimensions identified in the WDR 2012 on 
Gender and Inequality, women’s access to economic opportunities, endowments, and agency 
remain hindered. These disparities are particularly alarming in indigenous communities. 
43. 
Disparities in social opportunities and outcomes reveal important gender gaps, 
particularly when ethnicity and geography are taken into account. While literacy rates are 
equal in cities, the gap between men and women in rural areas is quite significant—70 percent 
for men compared to only 57 percent for women. This difference is particularly stark when 
considering that Guatemala indigenous women are twice as likely to be illiterate than non-
indigenous women. The boy-girl gender gap in the primary completion rate is 6.2 percentage 
points (2008), and the female-to-male ratio in secondary enrollment is 0.93 (2008) compared to a 
LAC average of 1.08. In Guatemala, reproductive health also lags behind the rest of the region. 
The maternal mortality rate in Guatemala is 120 per 100,000 live births (2008) whereas the 
regional rate is 80.4. Similarly, Guatemala’s contraceptive prevalence is significantly below that 
of its neighbors (54 percent versus 75 percent). Violence against women is also a major problem 
in Guatemala, with 60,000 cases of violence against women reported between 2008 and 2011.  
44. Gender equality is important in its own right, but it also makes sense from an 
economic perspective. Women comprise 51 percent of Guatemala’s population yet their 
participation in the labor force is limited (48 percent versus 88 percent for men). Furthermore, 
women make up nearly three-quarters of the informal sector and perform the majority of non-
remunerated labor, making it difficult to escape the circle of poverty. Formal sector wage gaps 
are still wide, with women earning 30 percent less than their male counterparts for equal work. 
There has been modest progress in this area, but it has not been significant for the poor. Wage 
inequality becomes most evident if differentiating for region and ethnic background.  Indigenous 
women engaged in agricultural labor earn 27 percent less than their male indigenous 
counterparts, 37 percent less than non-indigenous women, and 50 percent less than non-
indigenous men.  
45. 
Social outcomes are especially 
troubling among 
the nation’s 
indigenous 
communities. The indigenous population is more likely to live in households with less than a 
complete primary education (88.6 percent compared to 64.2 percent among the non-indigenous 
in 2000), and only half of indigenous adults are literate compared to 80 percent of non-
indigenous. Literacy rates are even more extreme by gender, at only 31 percent for rural 
indigenous women compared to 94 percent for urban men. While malnutrition affects half of 
Guatemalan children under five—already an extremely high level—it affects 70 percent of 
indigenous children, and up to 90 percent in some communities in the department of 
Huehuetenango. Only 5 percent of the indigenous have health coverage, in comparison with 

14 

 
 
18 percent of the non-indigenous, and only 19 percent of indigenous women’s births were 
attended by a doctor or nurse, compared to 57 percent for non-indigenous women. 
Underutilization of health services for cultural reasons contributes to this situation.  
46. Guatemala faces major environmental challenges and is highly vulnerable to 
natural disasters. Water pollution is widespread, and currently five children die every day from 
water-borne diseases caused by poor-quality water and sanitation. Low drainage rates 
(11 percent in rural areas and 44.3 percent in urban areas) mean more than 1.5 billion cubic 
meters of untreated wastewater are poured into water and soil each year. The annual loss of 
3.47 percent of the forest cover means Guatemala has among the highest deforestation rates in 
Latin America. A large percentage of this timber is exploited illegally, even if the forest is 
located within legally protected areas (at least 37 percent of deforestation). Guatemala also has 
one of the lowest urbanization rates in the region (50 percent) but is expected to converge to the 
regional average in the next 20 years.  This represents an additional challenge in terms of putting 
in place policies, institutions and investments to make urban growth more inclusive and 
sustainable.  It will also have implications for the country’s inequality challenges. 

Box 4.  Impact of Natural Disasters on Guatemala 
Between 1980 and 2010, Guatemala experienced 67 major natural disaster events, which affected more than 4 million people and 
left over 4,000 people dead; with estimated total economic damages at US$3.4 billion. Major disasters have impacted Guatemala, 
including the 1976 earthquake, which resulted in more than 23,000 deaths and damages estimated at 17.9 percent of GDP; the 
passing of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which caused estimated damages of 4.7 percent of GDP and 268 dead; Hurricane Stan, in 
2005, had an economic impact estimated at 3.4 percent of GDP, killing at least 1,500 people; and the Tropical Storm Agatha and 
the simultaneous eruption of the Pacaya Volcano, in May 2010, followed by torrential rains that exacerbated the already fragile 
environmental and social conditions left by previous adverse natural events. The cumulative economic impact of TS Agatha and 
the eruption of the Pacaya Volcano are estimated at US$1.5 billion, with 235 people dead. Once again, In October 2011, 
Guatemala was hit by Tropical Depression (TD) 12E. Even though, from a meteorological perspective TD 12E was a minor 
event, it caused widespread flooding and landslides in Guatemala and the rest of Central America.  The economic impact of TD 
12E in Guatemala alone was estimated at US$333.2 million. 

47. Guatemala has the fifth highest economic risk exposure to multiple hazards in the 
world, according to the World Bank’s Natural Disaster Hotspot study. Guatemala is located 
in one of the most volcano and seismically active regions in the planet. Over 80 percent of the 
country’s GDP is located in areas at risk (Box 4).  Moreover, global climate change and 
increased climatic variability is likely to exacerbate the country’s exposure to floods, erosion, 
landslide, hurricanes and droughts, which will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable as 
they are the least able to hedge these risks. Without a conscious effort on behalf of the 
Government to link development with environmental sustainability, gains in growth will be 
precarious in the long run. 
48. 
Compounding these challenges, the Government’s inability to generate revenue for 
much needed human capital and social development programs is a binding constraint.  
Government in Guatemala is small and weak, and public resources are not adequate to provide 
social services, infrastructure investments and public security. Reflecting historically weak fiscal 
capacity, Guatemala’s tax revenue stood at 11 percent of GDP in 2011, with social expenditures 
amounting to half that amount. A rigid budget structure makes it difficult to reallocate resources, 
and greater efficiency in the use of public funds is needed to maximize the impact of limited 
resources, as noted in the Bank’s 2012 Guatemala Public Expenditure Review (PER) and 2010 
PEFA. Budget implementation is compromised by weak linkages between planning and 
budgeting as well as frequent use of alternate vehicles to execute the budget. Weak oversight and 
sanctions undermine control over budget allocations and floating debt, as well as the credibility 

15 

 
 
of fiscal targets, and make it difficult to assess the quality of expenditure and perform external 
audits. 

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP—GUATEMALA PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

Past World Bank Group Experience 
49. 
The impact of the previous Country Partnership Strategy (FY09-12) fell below 
initial expectations, but it proved adaptable enough to help the Government weather a 
series of crises. Lack of congressional support impeded moving ahead with tax policy reforms 
and some planned investment projects. In part this underperformance was due to a series of 
crises faced by Guatemala during the previous administration—including rising food and fuel 
prices in 2008, the subsequent global financial crisis and several major natural disasters—as well 
as very low support for the Government within Congress. As well, some CPS goals may have 
been overly ambitious. Slow portfolio implementation as a result of lack of technical capacity 
and project restructuring in response to changing government priorities, affected delivery of 
results. 
50. 
The CPS proved flexible enough to adapt and respond to Government needs.  This 
included a shift in resources to social spending and counter-cyclical fiscal policy to face crises 
and providing quick resources to address natural disasters through the Development Policy Loan 
(DPL) with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO). Some aspects of the 
planned program did show progress, including the Country Governance and Anti-Corruption (C-
GAG) initiative, expansion of Integrated Financial Management System (Sistema Integrado de 
Administración Financiera—SIAF) 
and 
the 
e-procurement 
system Guatecompras, 
modernization of the tax authority, support to the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative 
(CoST), rehabilitation of rural roads and strengthened financial regulation.  
51. 
During the last four years, IFC supported interventions to facilitate doing business 
in the country, which contributed to a private-sector led recovery from the 2008-2009 
financial crisis. IFC supports the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector with a 
US$70 million equity investment in a leading financial institution that has grown its portfolio 
targeted to SMEs to more than US$100 million. In 2011, the client disbursed US$85 million of 
new loans that provide access to financial services to underserved regions and the rural 
indigenous population. Most recently the IFC invested $40 million and mobilized US$80 million 
for a regional telecom infrastructure company that will improve telecom coverage and lower 
costs for the telecommunications industry in the country and throughout Central America, and 
also supports a regional agro-business producer that provides thousands of employment 
opportunities in rural areas. In the same period, the IFC provided trade lines totaling 
US$272 million to three domestic banks in FY09-12, facilitating access to finance for consumers 
and enterprises during and after the crisis. 
Lessons Learned from the Prior Country Partnership Strategy (FY08-12) 
52. 
Develop realistic assessments of the likelihood to deliver results and maintain a 
critical assessment of what has been achieved. A CPS should focus on thematic strategies with 
clear and realistic results. In considering the likelihood of achieving results, attention should go 
beyond formal government commitment to consider the factors that may block achieving the 

16 

 
 
 
 
results, such as the difficult political economy in Guatemala. Such realistic assessments will 
improve the quality of the results framework as well as the understanding of the risks that follow 
to facilitate taking remedies to ease them. The focus on themes rather than projects could also 
provide flexibility in terms of the suite of instruments selected.  
53. 
A long history of implementation challenges has troubled the investment portfolio in 
Guatemala. Early engagement with the new Government may avoid high turnover of 
counterpart staff.  The lack of institutional and operational capacity in Government makes 
training on Bank procedures, including particularly safeguards and procurement, a priority. A 
frank assessment of the potential institutional bottlenecks would also help at project design.  
Since this is a problem shared by the IDB, the two institutions should work together and explore 
alternative options to address implementation constraints through, for example, better project 
design and training of technical counterparts.  Regular mini portfolio reviews to identify capacity 
constraints and provide technical assistance to address issues are also helpful. 
54. Keep the program simple and selective.  In line with the principle above, it is important 
to also be realistic about what can be achieved given the existing implementation capacity and 
country context.   Experience has shown that overly complex projects which involve more than 
one implementing agency have had a poor track record of performance. The current CPS 
therefore proposes fewer operations in select areas where there is strong Government 
commitment and an implementation agency with a proven ability to manage Bank projects well. 
55. 
The Bank should complement financing with a strong program on knowledge. The 
Bank should continue to foster a reputation for delivering high-quality knowledge products and 
technical assistance. In doing so, it is best to adopt a systematic approach to AAA through a 
thematic focus and annual planning exercise to agree with Government on priorities. The role of 
dissemination, and combining knowledge with other instruments, will also be an integral part of 
the knowledge program.  The Bank can support the authorities in scaling up successful pilot 
initiatives through program budgeting. 
Country Partnership Strategy: FY13-FY16 
56. 
The experience of the previous Bank strategy has yielded important lessons for the 
WBG program in Guatemala including the use of instruments and the measurement of the 
Bank’s impact.  Building on that experience, this CPS will be guided by the following 
principles of engagement. 
Principles of Engagement 
57. 
The CPS is aligned with Government priorities and endeavors to take account of the 
likelihood of implementation given the traditionally risky political environment, and therefore 
focus on areas of engagement with strong backing by the administration and broad support 
among different political parties and social groups. It will likewise focus on policy reform early 
on in the political cycle and on implementation thereafter.   
58. 
This CPS is the product of a close collaboration with the IDB, in an effort to avoid 
overlap and maximize the impact of development interventions. At the request of the 
Government, the WBG and IDB are moving their collaboration beyond specific projects to the 
entire country engagement process, including joint strategy design, portfolio reviews and 
supervision missions.  During implementation, cooperation will include frequent information 
exchanges and joint knowledge work, coordination on related policy-based operations and 

17 

 
 
possibly joint lending or non-lending operations, as appropriate. Efforts to improve portfolio 
implementation will receive special attention by both institutions, including developing 
alternative approaches that better fit the Guatemalan context.  The experience will be evaluated 
at the mid-point of the CPS to assess results. 
59. 
The Bank will seek to provide timely resources to the Government. The experience of 
the last CPS showed that the timely provision of resources to the budget helped the country deal 
with the impact of the global crisis and shift resources to social expenditure. The next CPS will 
prioritize budget support, including a CAT DDO, with attention to consolidating gains in the 
areas of public sector governance and effective delivery of social services. Bank support will 
coincide with the country’s own budget and decision-making process.   
60. 
The WBG will explore alternative ways to support the Government. Given the 
continued difficulties in implementing investment operations, the Bank will explore alternative 
options that may include the intensive use of non-lending services to develop with the client new 
areas of engagement, especially in the areas of competitiveness, sustainable development and 
productive inclusion. To achieve results the Bank will employ a suite of available instruments. 
61. 
The CPS includes a realistic and modest results framework to guide program design 
and implementation. The CPS will support the Government in monitoring the results 
framework. The program will be flexible as to how to achieve the results, especially in the newer 
areas of engagement.  The Progress Report will provide an update on the mix of Bank 
instruments to be employed, and will re-define and CPS Outcomes as appropriate. 
Strategic objectives and results areas 

62. 
This CPS sets out a new approach for the Bank’s engagement in Guatemala.  The 
strategic framework is aligned with the Government’s development agenda, including fiscal 
reform, malnutrition, competitiveness and citizen security. Given past experience, the CPS 
program proposes a flexible business model that is synchronized with the country’s budget 
process to facilitate congressional approval.  The program is selective and organized around two 
strategic objectives to: 
(i) Strengthen public policies for social development; and 
(ii) Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth. 
In addition, two cross-sectional themes have been identified which are critical to achieving the 
above objectives: citizen security and gender.  
63. 
In supporting the two strategic objectives and transversal themes, the World Bank 
and the IFC will rely on their comparative strengths.  The Bank will build on its past 
engagement in promoting an efficient public sector with emphasis on improving results in the 
social sectors.  The Bank and the IFC will work together to develop and strengthen an agenda to 
support competitiveness.  In particular, the IFC, consistent with its mandate, will focus on the 
following four areas: inclusive growth; climate change; competitiveness and innovation; and 
regional integration.  
64. 
The IDB strategy is both complementary and consistent with the WBG CPS.  The 
indicative IDB Country Strategy focuses on rural development, 
including productive 
development and diversification of the rural economy, improving health and malnutrition 
outcomes in rural areas and access to services.  A second area of focus is to improve 

18 

 
 
 
coordination of social policies and support efforts to rationalize social programs.  The IDB will 
also continue its support on fiscal consolidation and tax administration, as well as on the citizen 
security agenda, which poses a growing challenge to the country. Cross-cutting issues include 
gender, indigenous peoples and environment and natural disaster mitigation. 
65. 
The combination of a simpler design, modest objectives, tight alignment with 
Government manifested priorities and close coordination with the IDB represents a 
departure from previous CPS strategies. In this context, the current CPS represents a new 
model of engagement, which focuses on a few objective areas and leaves open the use of all 
Bank instrument to achieve results. It explicitly acknowledges that any lending will be 
frontloaded given the risks associated with Congressional approval of new projects at the end of 
the political cycle.  The Progress Report will provide an opportunity to review this approach, 
including bundling options and specific Bank instruments, and fine tune the results framework 
accordingly. The paragraphs below detail the broad objectives and results areas to which this 
CPS will contribute, as well as a suite of traditional and new financial and other instruments to 
be employed. It also mentions specifically the role of the IDB in key CPS results areas. 
(i) 
Strengthen Public Policies for Social Development 
66. 
Support under this pillar will help consolidate efforts since 1996 to improve the 
capacity of the state to deliver social development outcomes in an efficient and transparent 
manner. The Government is committed to this agenda as part of an effort to strengthen the 
presence of the state in protecting the citizens from risks and economic fluctuation, accelerate 
improvement in human capital and broaden inclusion. Work under this strategic objective bears 
on the concerns of the Government with social expenditure (including nutrition), and indirectly 
with security by bringing effective Government to the local level. It supports concrete 
Government initiatives such as Barrio Seguro which are targeted to the most vulnerable 
neighborhoods in the country.  CPS results are organized around two areas: (i) create fiscal space 
for social expenditures while improving transparency to build confidence that money is well 
spent; and (ii) improve the targeting and efficiency of social expenditures for better results. 
Result Area 1.  Create fiscal Space and improve transparency in the budgeting process 
67. 
The support for strengthening capacity to mobilize internal resources seeks to 
further open fiscal space within the framework of a stable macroeconomic management.   
The Bank will use the Fiscal Space for Greater Opportunities DPL series to support the tax 
policy and tax administration initiatives of the Government.  The CPS outcome is to bring the 
tax revenue collection to 12 percent of GDP by 2013 and maintain this level as a minimum.  
The administration’s efforts will include actions to ensure a fair enforcement of the tax law and 
reduce tax evasion of VAT.  The increase in public revenues will allow for maintaining, if not 
expanding, social expenditures.  The supporting DPL series has been closely coordinated with 
lending operations of the IDB related to fiscal policy.   
68. 
Improvements in transparency and governance are likely to stem from efforts to 
strengthen the tax administration. Congress recently reformed the Tax Code and passed a new 
Customs Law. The first of these reinforces the authority of the Tax and Customs 
Administration’s (SAT) to control, audit, and sanction, which is intended to reduce evasion 
through improved auditing practices.  An expected CPS Outcome in this area is to increase the 
number of audits of exports and imports by 25 percent by SAT, an agency that administers 
both tax and customs.  

19 

 
 
69. 
There will be continued attention to the improvement of the budget process. The 
Bank will maintain the policy dialogue with the Government to further strengthen public 
expenditure control and procurement efforts (Guatecompras) to promote fiscal savings, building 
on the findings of the 2012 Public Expenditure Review.  In addition, to help guide ongoing 
public finance management reform a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) 
study has been requested jointly with the IDB and the EU.  The PEFA Update, expected for 
FY13, will set the basis for a strategy to further improve public financial management that 
identifies priority areas of attention. A CPS outcome for this intervention area will be 
articulated at the time of the Progress Report.   
70. 
The CPS will continue to provide support to consolidate gains in expenditure 
transparency. Guatemala’s participation, implementation and successful execution of the 
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) will improve transparency in an industry 
historically vulnerable to corrupt practices. It is expected that by the time of the Progress Report 
Guatemala would have become a certified EITI member and that by the end of the CPS the 
country will be in compliance with reporting procedures. Greater transparency in the extractive 
industry will mitigate the problem of imperfect information, thus leveling the industry’s playing-
field and promoting foreign direct investment in Guatemala. A recently signed multi-donor trust 
fund is supporting technical assistance to increase transparency and accountability in the 
management of the mining, oil and gas sectors.   
71. 
The Bank will support the Government’s efforts to fight corruption.  The Bank and 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have recently started supporting 
Guatemala with technical assistance in recovering assets in other countries under the Stolen 
Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative. By tailoring training towards domestic practitioners (e.g., 
prosecutors, judges, fiscal intelligence units, investigators etc.) whose institutions have an 
interest and/or mandate to pursue stolen assets, StAR seeks to strengthen local capacity to 
recover assets and reduce impunity. The target outcome for the end of the CPS period is to 
strengthen the capacity of the Attorney General’s Office and the Supreme Court to recover 
assets through penal and civil actions.  The Bank, with the support of a Dutch Trust Fund, will 
continue working with the Controller General’s office to improve auditing and reporting on the 
budget process.  The Bank also remains ready to provide technical assistance to the 
Government’s efforts to institutionalize the successful pilot project under the Construction Sector 
Transparency Initiative (CoST).  The IDB supports the transparency agenda through technical 
assistance to improve the country’s ability to combat money laundering in the financial system.  
Results Area 2. Improved Results in Social Sectors 
72. 
The CPS will focus on assisting the Government to improve the effectiveness of 
social expenditures and its impact on results. The Bank will build on the institutional platform 
created by SIAF and support the Government’s focus on delivery of results, with emphasis on 
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation framework. The CPS Outcome is a results-based 
budgeting agreement with at least one line Ministry (e.g, health) that includes an operational 
monitoring and evaluation framework for priority health programs.  
73. 
The support on results will include ensuring the sustainability of achievements of 
the ongoing health and nutrition and education interventions that are coming to an end 
during the CPS period.  It is expected that gross lower secondary enrollment in targeted rural 
areas will not fall below 73 percent in the final year of the CPS period.  Likewise in health, 

20 

 
 
gains in maternal and infant mortality will be maintained.  In addition, it is expected that the 
availability of professional attention to expecting mothers will increase in the 83 priority 
municipalities identified by Government.  To ensure the sustainability of health and education 
outcomes, the Bank will also provide support through the programmatic DPL and accompanying 
NLTA.  
74. 
Several CPS activities will aid the design and implementation of the Government’s 
flagship Zero Hunger program as well as other social sector interventions. The proposed 
DPL series includes support for the development of the Zero Hunger program and a schedule of 
expansion to municipalities across the country over the next two years, with a targeting 
mechanism to prioritize those with the highest rates of malnutrition. The Government and the 
Bank are currently finalizing an NLTA for Zero Hunger, including a strategy for monitoring and 
evaluation. By the end of the CPS period, Zero Hunger is expected to be under implementation 
in 83 priority municipalities, providing at least 30 percent of the children less than 1 year old 
with appropriate growth promotion package of services for their age. Regarding food security, 
the ongoing Land Administration Project supports government efforts to implement guidelines 
on food security which were approved in May 2012 by the Committee of Food Security under 
the auspices of FAO.4 
75. 
The Bank will support efforts to strengthen the Government’s coordination and 
articulation of social policies, including at the local level. The Ministry of Social Development 
(MIDES) was created in February 2012 to coordinate social policies across various ministries 
and public agencies. The Bank will provide support to improve targeting and maximize the 
impact of social assistance, including efforts to address food price spikes, if needed. A first step 
in that direction will be the creation of a unique beneficiary registry which is expected to be in 
operation by the end of the CPS period.  Proposed technical assistance on Social Protection and 
Health will pilot the implementation of multiple coordinated social interventions in one or two 
communities.  An expected CPS outcome, to be confirmed at the Progress Report, will focus on 
measuring targeting effectiveness of the social programs included in the unique beneficiary 
registry.  The IDB is discussing the possibility of strengthening the Government’s coordination 
and articulation of social policies as part of a planned budget operation, and has a technical 
assistance operation under execution to strengthen Guatemala’s statistical capacity through the 
census. 
76. 
The Bank will support the Barrio Seguro (Safe Neighborhood) program of social 
interventions for disadvantaged and unsafe neighborhoods, including the targeting strategy 
as well as its links to Zero Hunger and other social policies. The Barrio Seguro program 
coordinates the implementation of a variety of Government initiatives in high-risk communities.  
The support of the Bank will focus on building the capacity of these communities to stimulate 
private investment in basic services and housing for the poor as an important contribution to 
reduce incentives for crime and violence.  For example, one ongoing initiative under Barrio 
Seguro is to foster youth leadership through the program Jovenes Protagonistas.  It is expected 
that by the end of the CPS 20,000 participants will have been included in the program. The 
IDB is also exploring with the Government a comprehensive strategy to support neighborhood 
upgrading and this would be elaborated in collaboration with the Bank.  

4  
This is the “Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests 
in the context of national food security”.

(ii) 
Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth 
77. 
The WBG will support the Government’s efforts to give prominence to the 
competitiveness agenda, and endeavor to help set the country on a higher growth 
trajectory.  In doing so, the WBG will build on past achievements, but, more importantly, will 
seek to accompany the Government in articulating a comprehensive competitiveness agenda that 
is both inclusive and sustainable. Given fiscal constraints, the increased revenues from fiscal 
efforts will primarily go to benefit the social sectors to build human capital.  This will be a 
challenge for the other elements of the competitiveness agenda which will need to be financed 
with additional resources from within the budget or from more novel solutions, such as Public 
Private Partnerships (PPP). 
78. 
In line with the lessons learned during the previous CPS period, improving growth 
requires a new approach to Bank engagement.  During the CPS period the WBG will seek to 
improve outcomes through innovative project design and the use of a mix of instruments (i.e., 
analytical work, bringing together different stakeholders, support for PPPs and just-in-time 
technical advice). The IFC will lead the dialogue in this area of engagement in close 
collaboration with IBRD and MIGA.  Within this strategic objective, Bank support is organized 
around the following results areas: (i) Infrastructure and Logistics; (ii) Environment and Disaster 
Risk Management; and (iii) Rural Development and SMEs. 
Results Area 1. Infrastructure and Logistics 
79. 
Support for infrastructure will include a diagnostic of the current public-private 
partnership (PPP) framework and technical assistance to increase the capacity of public 
agencies to manage investment and maintenance.  The latter may include advisory services 
for specific sectors.  It is expected that by the end of the CPS period the country will have in 
place the institutions capable of negotiating, monitoring and improving performance of PPPs, 
including managing environmental and social safeguard considerations. In addition, the WBG 
will focus on the transport sector, supporting efforts to build PPP capacity and engage the private 
investment in this sector. By the Progress Report the priority interventions in transport will be 
determined by Government, including the areas of WBG engagement.    
80. 
The Bank will complement IFC’s activities to improve logistics, including roads, 
airports and ports, to facilitate economic activity. The Bank will provide support to assess the 
viability of airports, ports and related road structure as well as the development of a tourism 
master plan. This will be done in close cooperation with IDB and other partners. An additional 
item on the logistics agenda is to improve the operations in customs, where the country lags. The 
Government is aligning Guatemalan customs with the Uniform Central American Custom’s 
Code, which will not only strengthen regional integration but also improve capacity to combat 
contraband and customs fraud. The Bank will support the elaboration of regulations governing 
the new Customs Law. The vision for the long term is to build an integrated regional view of 
development linking the interior of the country—where the bulk of the population is located—
with the region and the rest of the world.  The CPS Outcome is to improve the availability and 
quality of supporting infrastructure for international trade as measured by the infrastructure 
component of the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index. 

22 

 
 
 
81. 
The CPS will strengthen its engagement in improving housing and social 
infrastructure to improve economic opportunities and security in vulnerable areas.  As 
mentioned above, the Bank will support the Barrio Seguro program through two pilots 
(Mancomunidad del Sur and in Guatemala City). These pilots include social infrastructure 
investments such as community centers offering daycare, play areas and sports courts, improved 
access streets or stairs, and services like water and sewage. These interventions can have a 
positive impact on economic competitiveness and social inclusion.  To enhance South-South 
cooperation the Bank will promote exchanges with Bolivia, Honduras and Brazil along these 
lines.  In urban housing, a trust fund-sponsored NLTA is building capacity for banks to use 
mortgage portfolios as collateral to secure credit lines, thus increasing resources available for 
lower-middle class families to purchase housing. In rural municipalities, the ongoing Economic 
Rural Development Project (PDER) has a component using participatory techniques to prioritize 
development plans. This process has already been successfully completed in 45 municipalities in 
2011, and 100 more are targeted for 2012.  Finally, the Bank is initiating a dialogue with the 
Government around issues of urban upgrading, including solid waste management. 
82. Within the renewable energy space, investments are expected with private sector 
clients that won a recent Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) bid coordinated by the 
energy sector regulator, CNEE.  This would support a total of 210MW in new hydro capacity, 
equivalent to 14 percent of today’s energy demand in the country. This will be further 
complemented by other potential investments in a second round of PPA bids, targeting additional 
hydro capacity of 270MW. The two bidding processes will help the country replace 480MW of 
thermal energy produced with fuel oil plants by 2016, and in turn reduce the dependence of 
imported energy supplies and the country’s carbon footprint, as well as improve the 
competitiveness of the manufacturing sector with lower power prices. These investments will 
also take advantage of the regional electricity market (MER) that will come into operations in the 
next two years once the Central American Electrical Interconnection System (SIEPAC) system 
finished.  
Results Area 2. Environment and Disaster Risk Management 
83. 
The Bank will bolster Government’s efforts to address major environmental 
challenges which have not received prominence in the past.  Guatemala, despite having 
significant environmental and cultural assets that need to be protected, has been slow to focus on 
these issues. The Bank, through TA, will assist the Government on strategy formulation building 
on its international know-how and drawing from successful interventions in the region. A CPS 
Outcome will be defined at the time of the Progress Report.  As part of the Economic Rural 
Development Project, the Bank is helping create and sustain supply chains with a specific focus 
on the sustainable use of natural resources such as precious hardwoods, in an effort to limit 
deforestation. By the end of the CPS it is expected that 105 supply chains with an 
environmental component will be in place. The Bank is also engaging in knowledge exchanges 
and capacity building with officials in SEGEPLAN, the Environment Ministry and the Ministry 
of Energy and Mines on the use and importance of WBG environmental safeguards, which is 
expected to inform not only WBG projects but also the broader public investment portfolio.  
84. 
Support for enabling the country to respond effectively and quickly to natural 
disasters and to adapt to the impacts of climate change will be scaled up. Given that the 
current DPL with a CAT DDO is fully disbursed, the Bank stands ready to continue its support to 
the Government to build capacity to address, both institutionally and financially, the impact of 

23 

 
 
natural disasters, including potentially with a second operation. This support would build on the 
positive experience of the first CAT DDO Project which mainstreamed risk management 
methodologies into municipal and departmental development plans. A trust fund is also under 
implementation to support the creation of an agricultural insurance market to help rural 
producers manage natural disaster risks and the impact of climate change. The IDB is active in 
the area of climate change adaptation, with technical assistance loan on national strategy and in 
helping rural, indigenous communities adapt to changing climate patterns and a Policy Based 
Loan. 
Results Area 3.  Rural Development and SMEs 
85. 
The agenda of supporting rural development will continue to be the core of the 
IFC’s 
inclusive approach to development. Within agribusiness, 
the IFC 
invested 
US$100 million in a regional sugar company during FY09-12, targeted to the expansion of 
production, as well increase the co-generation and ethanol operations in the country and its 
regional subsidiaries. This investment has promoted regional integration in the sector and 
facilitated further south-south investments for the client, a major provider of employment 
opportunities in rural Guatemala. The IFC will continue to invest in agribusiness by broadening 
its investments to other competitive export-based commodities to generate employment in rural 
regions of Guatemala.  
86. 
Promoting the growth of the small business sector is an important focus of WBG 
activity in the CPS, through direct investments, capacity building and creating a more 
amenable business environment. The Bank’s Enhancing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise 
(MSME) Productivity Project is designed to stimulate the growth of MSMEs in selected value 
chains. This Project is not yet effective and hence the necessary surveys to establish adequate 
baselines and targets have not been undertaken.  CAS outcomes will focus on stimulating the 
growth of MSMEs and increasing value.  The quantitative indicator will be defined at the time 
of the Progress Report.  IFC Support to SMEs will continue through a US$10 million newly 
formed private equity fund, which will focus on investment in health care, technology, light 
manufacturing and financial services sectors. In the financial sector the IFC will continue 
financing trade and supporting regional firms in south-south investments. Through the 
Sustainable Business Advisory services, the IFC will support capacity building of SMEs in 
selected supply chains.  
87. 
The Bank and IFC are providing joint technical assistance to assist the Government 
in improving the environment for opening and operating new businesses. Following up on 
the successful efforts in FY11-12, technical assistance for ‘Doing Business’ improvements will 
similarly be strengthened, with a focus on supporting job creation through a competitive private 
sector. This support is being provided through a cooperation agreement to work in the area of 
business regulatory and institutional reform, to simplify business laws and regulations, 
strengthen institutions that implement them and reduce the gaps between laws and their 
implementation.  Results in this area are expected to be a reduced number of procedures to open 
and operate a business, and a reduction in time and costs of transactions to deal with regulations.  
Measurement will be tracked through the MSME project and targeted subsections of the Doing 
Business Survey. CPS Outcomes focus on reducing barriers to opening a business and 
obtaining licenses.  

24 

 
 
88. 
The Bank will continue efforts to promote greater economic opportunities in rural 
areas, in coordination with the IDB.  The CPS will continue to support outcomes to improve 
rural productivity and expand economic opportunities for very small farms, through ongoing 
Bank projects. The Bank’s ongoing Economic Rural Development Program—funded jointly with 
the IDB—is expected to deliver outcomes in rural productivity that will contribute to higher 
incomes and greater smallholder resilience.  The Bank is also supporting the Government’s 
efforts to improve land administration and titling, which is expected to lead to greater 
satisfaction with land registration services and foster inclusiveness of women and indigenous 
communities.  The two Bank operations mentioned above will close by the time of the Progress 
Report.  Further WBG support will be tightly coordinated with the IDB, as rural development is 
likely to be one of the primary focus areas of the Country Strategy under discussion. The Bank is 
also planning to undertake a Country Social Analysis (CSA) which could include measures to 
specifically address indigenous people’s constraints, concerns and priorities.  In addition, the 
Bank’s ongoing Land Project is tracking the inclusiveness of the land administration process in 
terms of women and indigenous communities. 
89. 
The CPS will respond to the Government request to assist with developing the 
institutional framework needed to furnish adequate education and skills to meet the 
development challenges ahead. The ongoing Education Project supports the Government’s 
efforts to improve access to and quality of basic education services, particularly among rural and 
indigenous populations. 

(iii) Transversal Themes for Development 
Cross-Cutting Theme 1: Citizen Security 
90. 
Support for the Government strategy on justice, security and crime runs through 
the WBG program.  This support represents a first step in an area where the Bank has limited 
engagement in Guatemala. The approach therefore will support prevention in areas where the 
Bank has been present in the past, and undertake new activities as part of promoting experiments 
to assess alternative options of support.  Strengthening the capacity of the State to mobilize 
resources and improve results effectiveness should help close key gaps in service delivery that 
weaken the legitimacy of the public sector. The NLTA on urban infrastructure will provide 
targeted support for the implementation of the Barrio Seguro agenda which improves the ability 
to deliver results at the local level from a variety of government programs. Barrio Seguro is an 
umbrella for programs that emphasize youth employment and training. The NLTA on Crime and 
Violence will take a more comprehensive approach and provide analytical support to the 
Government on its overall strategy to improve citizen security. The IDB and the World Bank will 
also consider undertaking a joint Public Expenditure Review (PER) on Security Expenditures.5  
Finally, the overall focus of the CPS on inclusive growth is geared towards providing 
employment and training opportunities for youth. 
91. 
Support to strengthening security at the municipal level may materialize in the form 
of investment lending during the CPS period.  Ongoing south-south collaboration includes 
technical assistance in program development to adapt the Guatemalan setting to the experiences 
of the Barrios de Verdad (La Paz, Bolivia) and Barrio Ciudad (Honduras cities) projects, both 
supported by Bank lending. Dovetailing with this activity, the Bank is currently in discussions 

5  

This would build and expand on the Bank’s previous analytical work in the context of the 2012 PER. 

25 

 
 
                                                 
with the Government to identify activities for Guatemala under the State and Peace-building 
Grant which could finance pilot activities to improve urban infrastructure in marginalized 
neighborhoods to make them safer and increase social inclusion. IDB is beginning 
implementation of a non-lending technical assistance project in support of reform to the national 
police force and has an investment project in the pipeline for 2014 to strengthen urban security 
and justice services. The Bank and the IDB are both supporting crime and violence in a 
subregional context, including support for a monitoring observatory as well as support to 
strengthen the regional Central American System of Integration (SICA).  
Cross-Cutting Theme 2: Gender 
92. Gender considerations are mainstreamed into the Bank’s ongoing portfolio, notably 
the maternal health and rural development projects. Gender is a cross-cutting area for both 
the Bank and the IDB. The CPS, through its focus on improving the quality of public 
expenditures, will support the Government’s efforts to maintain or improve the gains in infant 
and maternal mortality, with the support of the ongoing Maternal Health Project which is nearing 
completion. The support of the rural development program is expected to increase rural income 
by strengthening supply chains, where 20 percent of beneficiaries are expected to be women.  
The program is also financing participatory municipal, departmental and regional development 
plans, with strong involvement of women. Due to the inclusive nature of the plan design, 
women's ideas, perspectives and demands are reflected in plans and in budgetary priorities. The 
Land Administration Project targets women and indigenous populations in cadastral surveying, 
land regularization, conflict resolution, titling, and registration.  A gender indicator for the CPS 
program will track satisfaction with land registration services and access to eligible parcels of 
national lands.6 
93. 
In addition, the Bank is committed to including gender indicators in all new 
operations.  For example, the Small and Medium Enterprises Project, when effective, will 
include specific targets for increasing female micro-entrepreneurs. The agenda on security, 
particularly Barrio Seguro, considers as one of its main drivers of success, the ability to engage 
the participation of women and young, underemployed men, in the implementation of its 
programs.  In this regard, south-south exchanges with Bolivia have emphasized the gender 
dimension with a focus on initiatives to provide daycare to promote workforce participation. In 
this context, a CPS milestone includes women's participation in consultations on prevention of 
gender-based violence prevention.  To the extent possible, future DPL lending will also consider 
gender sensitive filters.   
94. 
The Bank is also supporting the Government’s gender agenda through knowledge 
and events to raise public awareness of the challenges and opportunities in Guatemala. The 
work in Guatemala builds on the World Development Report (WDR) for 2012 on Gender and 
Inequality as well as the regional study, Una (R)evolución de género en marcha, that analyzes 
trends in female labor force participation over the past decade in Central America and makes 
recommendations on how to increase participation of women in the labor market. The work 
under the CPS also builds on a close cooperation with the UN System, in particular UN Women 
as well as with the Presidential Secretariat for Women (SEPREM). As a first step this 
collaboration materialized in two public events one launching the regional study on March 8,

Baseline under preparation as part of the Land Administration Project.

2012, and a second one in June 2012 focusing on female access to economic opportunities, with 
broad participation of civil society and public and private sector representatives.  
CPS Program FY13-16 
95. 
Indicative country demand for the financial support component of the CPS period 
FY13-16 is estimated at US$525 million and could include a mix of DPL, investment 
lending and possibly guarantees. The program would be frontloaded in the first two years of 
the CPS period given the high risk of effectiveness delays towards the end of the political cycle 
in Guatemala.  The Bank will increase its focus on implementation of the portfolio and 
accelerating disbursements towards the end of the CPS period, and undertaking the necessary 
analytical work and technical assistance to prepare the policy dialogue with the next 
administration.  The FY13 program is firm with the US$200 million DPL.  The lending program 
in FY14 will depend on government demand and how performance evolves in the course of the 
CPS period, and on IBRD’s lending capacity as well as demand from other borrowers.

96. 
The current portfolio will contribute to delivery of outcomes, particularly during 
the first half of the CPS period. The portfolio under implementation includes seven projects 
and commitments of US$400 million. Half of the portfolio is undisbursed and a little over 
40 percent of the portfolio is at risk.  Disbursements on the trust fund portfolio are also lagging.  
Trust funds are 65 percent undisbursed, which represents roughly US$18 million. The poor 
portfolio performance is due in part to structural factors in the country’s political and 
institutional system. Implementation typically slows during the political transition due to high 
levels of turnover in government officials and changing priorities in what is already a weak 
institutional environment. Effectiveness delays and difficulties due to inefficiencies and rigidities 
in the budgeting process further complicate portfolio performance. Project fiduciary risk is 
generally assessed as moderate for central, non-complex operations and substantial for multi-
institutional, decentralized and more complex operations.  

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
97. 
The Government has reviewed the Bank portfolio and suggested some simplification 
and restructuring that would help accelerate disbursements. The practice of periodic mini-
Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) will continue and additional procurement and 
safeguard support will be provided for particularly complex operations. The Government has 
requested that all future loans be designed based on models that are simple and have been proven 
to work. Officials intend to maximize programmatic support through development policy lending 
in areas where there is sustained commitment to push forward reforms.  
98. 
The CPS will also focus on building the role of the World Bank Group as a 
knowledge provider.   Developing a relevant program of analytical work will be a key objective 
of the CPS as a provider of knowledge and convening services.  While a reasonable amount of 
work has been done in this area, more efforts will be made to improve dissemination and create 
space for dialogue among different stakeholders in the country.  Intense use will be made of 
NLTA in order to allow for different forms of dialogue with authorities and other stakeholders.  
The Bank will also improve coordination efforts with IDB and other partners to maximize the 
impact of our knowledge services.  The Bank’s convening services will be used to bring 
stakeholders together to discuss critical issues, such as social inclusion, gender and crime and 
violence.  The Bank will sponsor with local and regional partners, one large conference in 
Guatemala, starting in FY13 with an event on “Boosting Economic Growth in Guatemala”. 
Results Monitoring 
99. 
This CPS proposes a streamlined approach to monitoring and evaluation.  Given the 
limited size of the portfolio and selective nature of engagement, the design of the results matrix 
is realistic and consistent with a flexible program.  This will require continuous follow-up which 
will be done as part of the portfolio review process. To the extent possible, any portfolio 
restructuring will include a breakdown by gender of key indicators. A challenge during the CPS 
period will be to develop mechanisms to track analytical work, technical assistance and 
conferences in such a way that the full impact of the Bank’s interventions may be measured.  A 
monitoring and evaluation strategy will be defined in the medium term to better track results for 
these instruments.  
Partnerships 
100. The WBG is collaborating with other Development Partners in key areas. In line 
with the principles of the Paris Declaration, the WBG participated in a series of consultations and 
coordination mechanisms with other bilateral and multilateral partners to exchange ideas and 
receive feedback on the proposed strategy. Other development actors responded positively to the 
interest of the WBG in establishing an ongoing dialogue to better coordinate efforts in 
Guatemala, both at the level of the CPS and specific issue areas and projects. The WBG, IMF 
and IDB participated in a full-day event in January of 2012 in which the incoming Government 
presented its action plan and requested support from multilateral institutions as well as an 
efficient division of labor. The IMF takes the lead on the financial sector, monetary policy and 
macro-fiscal issues, in the context of macroeconomic monitoring activities. The Bank 
participates and coordinates at the field level with other UN agencies through the UN Country 
Team (UNCT). In this context the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) is co-managed 
through the WBG and UNODC, and the WBG also works in concert with UN Women and others 
to promote the topic of gender. The Bank is also an active member of the G-13—a grouping of 
13 bilateral and multilateral donors in Guatemala. In this regard the country organized a meeting 

28 

 
 
in June 2012 to coordinate the WBG’s activities and strategy with other donors, with the aim of 
strengthening complementarities and avoiding overlap.   

Regional  
101. The CPS period will support the Guatemala program through several regional 
initiatives.  In support of a greater integration of the Central American regional economy, the 
Bank will work with Guatemala to facilitate trade by reducing barriers between countries, for 
example customs procedures and border crossing standards.  Additional initiatives include: 
(i) support for a Central American Private Sector Task Force; (ii) support to strengthen the public 
sector through a Regional Integration Training Program (launched in January 2011) and a 
Central American Leadership program with the INCAE Business School; (iii) support to the 
Central American Council of Ministers of Finance (COSEFIN) for the preparation of a Central 
America-DR Regional Investment Plan and a trade facilitation window; and (iv) support for the 
preparation of a Central American Disaster Risk policy.  
102. Support on crime and violence will have a strong regional perspective.  Bank support 
in this area centers on the Bank’s convening power, including analytical work and technical 
assistance, as well as participation and co-organization of high-level events in the region.  In 
addition, the 2011 Security Conflict and Development World Development Report (WDR) and 
the regional study on Central America Crime and Violence are informing the regional debate on 
the topic with analytical work. The Bank is also contributing to the institutional strengthening of 
the regional institution responsible for the citizen security agenda in Central America (i.e., SICA) 
with financial resources from the Institutional Development Facility (IDF). Similarly the Bank, 
together with the IDB and other bilateral donors, is providing technical assistance to implement 
SICA's Regional Security Strategy. This includes the creation of a regional crime observatory 
(OBSICA) to generate comparable statistics on violent crimes across Central American 
countries. Through an IDF grant, the Bank is supporting the creation of Technical Units in 
Guatemala and Panama responsible for feeding information to OBSICA using the Regional 
Security Indicators System.  
Consultation process 
103. The Bank organized two formal sessions of consultations as well as several informal 
gatherings with civil society and private sector groups as part of the process of designing 
the CPS.  The purpose of the consultations was to hear reactions to proposed Bank activities and 
receive input on how the Bank might better promote development in Guatemala. The 
consultations—held on June 8, 2012 in Guatemala City and June 14, 2012 in Quetzaltenango—
brought the Bank’s country team together with a wide variety of civil society representatives. 
Participants came from groups representing the private sector (SMEs and industry), women 
(women’s rights, productive associations, and political groups), indigenous communities, 
development and human rights NGOs, youth, religious organizations and universities, among 
others. Groups came not only from the two host cities, but also rural areas and other large towns.  
104. Consultation participants were overall very supportive of the proposed areas of 
engagement contained in the CPS as well as the two cross-cutting themes, which is 
consistent with the findings of the Client Survey (Box 5). The topic of citizen security was a 
major topic of discussion, particularly in the Guatemala City consultation, with participants 
suggesting that the Bank become more involved in this area, especially in prevention-oriented 

29 

 
 
 
activities. The Bank-supported urban infrastructure upgrading efforts underway were seen as a 
positive step in this direction. Infrastructure, especially related to transportation, was a stronger 
focus of interest in Quetzaltenango, which is unsurprising considering this provincial city’s more 
remote location and the desire by the private sector operators and ordinary citizens to be better 
connected to the rest of the country and the region. The Bank and IFC’s proposals to support 
logistics and transport infrastructure were well received, although participants did call for more 
direct investments to the private sector. Areas that participants singled out as requiring more 
attention by the WBG—either through analysis or projects—included rural development and 
environmental protection, the justice sector, public university infrastructure and youth 
interventions, among others.  

Box 5.  Guatemala Country Survey FY13 – Overall Findings 
The FY13 Guatemala Country Survey (CS) findings suggest strong alignment between domestic perceptions of key development 
priorities and the role of the Bank in the country.  
Generally, stakeholders in Guatemala seem optimistic about the direction of the country - 80 percent reported that the country is 
moving in the right direction. Among the development priorities identified, stakeholders indicate that poverty reduction is the 
most critical. Stakeholders also point to rural development (distinct from agricultural development) and basic education as vital to 
reducing poverty. Economic growth emerges as a top priority as well as promotion of job creation, foreign direct investment, and 
development in the energy sector. Pluralities of respondents recommend that the Bank should focus both financial and knowledge 
resources on the rural sector, followed by poverty, basic education and basic infrastructure, which shows strong alignment 
between priority development challenges and the perceived role of the Bank. The Bank is primarily valued for its financial 
resources and technical assistance.  
The CS findings suggest that relationships between the Bank and partners, stakeholders, and clients are strong.  Views on how 
respectful the Bank is with clients are high, as are ratings on Bank collaboration with Government and other donors. Ratings 
related to technical aspects of the Bank’s operations in Guatemala, including Bank approvals and reviews, using country systems, 
implementation support, etc. are generally positive. 
 The Bank receives a lower rating for alignment of its work with country priorities and whether the Bank supports programs that 
are realistic for Guatemala, its flexibility in the face of changing domestic circumstance, and most importantly, sustainability of 
results. Additionally, while stakeholders do not seem to question the quality of knowledge products, ratings on their use are 
disappointing. The CS finds that only two out of ten respondents say they use the Bank’s knowledge monthly, half reported ‘a 
few times a year’ and nearly a quarter responded ‘rarely.’ Going forward, this finding should be investigated to better understand 
why knowledge/research is being used infrequently and how products can be used in innovative ways to meet clients’ needs and 
ensure strong development results – particularly in light of how much respondents in Guatemala value technical assistance. 

V.  RISKS 
105. The high vulnerability of Guatemala to global shocks poses a major risk to the 
country, especially the poor.  The strong economic link with the United States and the reliance 
of the poor on remittances from abroad, means that a slowdown in the global economy will 
lower the incomes of the poor disproportionately in an environment when many households have 
depleted their savings to cope with previous shocks. This has the potential to produce lasting 
effects in terms of human capital accumulation, such as withdrawing children from school. The 
CPS will contribute to the mitigation of this risk through support for social assistance programs, 
including for better targeting and results. 
106. Rising international food prices are a concern given the potential impact on the poor 
and the most vulnerable sectors. Food stocks are lower than in previous years and the global 
economic recession has curtailed remittances, which have traditionally been an important 
mechanism for people to cope with poverty and hunger. The Government’s “Zero Hunger” 
Program is one of the main tools to implement integral development approaches to respond to 
hunger and food insecurity. While the likelihood of a significant direct fiscal impact of 
increasing food prices is limited, the Bank and the IDB are supporting the “Zero Hunger” 
30 

 
 
program, and together with the IMF, and together with the Government will assess the need for 
scaling up safety net programs, should food prices increase significantly in Guatemala.   
107. Political uncertainty in Guatemala poses a risk to the implementation of the CPS 
program.  Of particular concern is the recurrent gridlock between the executive and legislative 
branches and the corresponding impact on the approval prospects for multilateral lending.  To 
address this risk, the Bank will choose entry points for Bank lending carefully, and intensify its 
dialogue with key stakeholders, including Congress. The Bank has also agreed with Government 
to present its lending as a package, in coordination with other partners such as the IDB, and align 
approval with the budget process.  This strategy is expected to minimize delays in effectiveness. 
108. Crime and violence remains a serious issue and exacts a high cost on development. 
Security concerns, combined with institutional weaknesses, are a destabilizing factor for 
political, social and economic life in Guatemala. The Bank’s approach to mitigate this risk is to 
align its evolving strategy with the Government’s own vision to contain crime through the 
provision of better services and the creation of opportunities, particularly for youth. The work 
with other development partners, particularly the IDB, follows the same strategic direction.  The 
Bank recognizes that behind the rise in insecurity are strong forces that may not easily be 
contained in the short term and hence the task of improving security is likely to extend beyond 
this CPS. 
109. Guatemala is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Guatemala is one of five 
countries in the world most affected by floods, hurricanes and earthquakes (see Box 4).    Major 
climatic or seismic disasters had a significant economic and fiscal impact over the life of the last 
CPS, and can often delay the Government’s program as funding must be diverted to support 
emergency efforts.  The Government has made some progress in disaster management and 
preparedness, and the focus on social protection programs, particularly for the most vulnerable, 
is an important tool to help the poor withstand recurring shocks. 
110. Guatemala remains a difficult implementation environment for both the Bank and 
the IDB.  Historically, the portfolio of investment loans has suffered due to delays in approval, 
changes in Government priorities following political transitions, high mobility of technical 
personnel and a low capacity for implementation, particularly in terms of managing Bank 
procedures and safeguards.  To mitigate this risk, the Bank and the IDB are committed to 
adopting innovative solutions in order to address obstacles to implementation and improve 
delivery of results.

Annex 2. CPS Completion Report  
Country:  Guatemala 
CPS Coverage:  FY09-FY12 
Date of Progress Report: August 11, 2010  

(I) 
Summary of the findings of the self evaluation 
1. 
This Completion Report evaluates the delivery of the Guatemala FY09-FY12 CPS as 
amended by the FY11 Progress Report.  The CPS was implemented in difficult economic and 
political circumstances. The executive power never had the support of the Congress; insecurity 
increased driven by the rising influence of the drug trade; and, several shocks hit the economy, 
including climate-related natural disasters. These developments 
led 
to a challenging 
governability, security and macroeconomic situation with subsequent social consequences. The 
Government managed to maintain macro-stability and to soften the shock on growth while 
increasing social expenditures and protecting the most poor. The WBG used the flexibility 
incorporated in the design of the CPS to adjust its strategy to the changing circumstances, 
shifting resources to support mild counter-cyclical fiscal policy and to strengthen social 
expenditure. Project implementation, however, remained slow with a high percentage of the 
portfolio at risk. The Completion Report rates Bank and IFC performance as moderately 
satisfactory. Delivery of CAS outcomes as revised in the Progress Report was good across the 
board; however, the impact on development outcomes was limited, particularly in the area of 
competiveness.  Progress on governance was made but will require sustained efforts in the future 
in order to achieve its full development impact. The rating for the achievement of results is 
moderately satisfactory.  
(II) 
Progress made toward achieving country level goals 
2. 
Since 2008, Guatemala has been hit by subsequent external shocks including a food 
and fuel crisis and severe natural disasters.  The impact of the 2008 global food and fuel crisis 
was exacerbated in 2009 by a drought that led to famines and harvest losses of up to 90 percent 
of certain crops; with over 4,000 communities at risk of acute malnutrition In 2010, the 
subsequent Pacaya Volcano eruption, tropical Storm Agatha and torrential rains from May to 
September led to widespread floods, landslides and evacuations. Over 500,000 Guatemalans 
suffered direct damages from these disasters, with low-income, rural and vulnerable groups 
disproportionately affected. Conservative estimates place the financial costs of the damages and 
losses at about 4 percent of GDP (approximately USD 1.6 billion). The recent E12 tropical 
depression of 2011 left over 22,000 houses damaged and the road system in ruin. Commerce and 
agriculture were among the sectors most affected, causing decreases in economic productivity 
and increased food insecurity for more than 40,000 families. 

3. 
The economic situation was compounded by the global economic crisis in 2008 
which led to a slowdown in economic growth. Recessions in key trading, investment, finance 
and remittances source countries – most notably the United States and Mexico – contributed to a 
significant decline in exports (6.6 percent), foreign direct investment (26.3 percent), remittances 
(9.6 percent), and international credit lines to domestic banks (25 percent) in 2009.  Surges in 
demand for sugar, coffee and cardamom exports, as well as a moderate counter-cyclical fiscal 
stimulus – the deficit of the non-financial public sector increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
2008 to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2009 – helped cushion the impact of the crisis. Real GDP growth 
declined to 0.6 percent in 2009 – the worst performance in two decades.   

4. 
Since 2010, the Guatemalan economy has experienced a moderate recovery.  With 
the improvement in the international situation, GDP growth increased to 2.8 percent in 2010, and 
3.8 percent over 2011, underpinned by buoyant exports and domestic demand. Driven by 
international energy and food prices, inflation went up in mid-2011 to 7.6 percent from 5.4 
percent at the end of 2010, but has come down within the 3.5-5.5 percent range, which is the 
target of the Central Bank. In 2011, the Government tightened fiscal policy reducing the deficit 
of the central Government to 2.8 percent of GDP from 3.3 percent in 2010 and maintaining the 
public debt broadly stable at 24.2 percent of GDP, up from 20.2 percent in 2008. The financial 
sector remains stable, with adequate levels of liquidity and capital. Although the current account 
deficit widened, a larger surplus in the capital account meant that net international reserves 
remained at comfortable levels. The country’s external position is solidly backed by gross 
international reserves of US$6.4 billion. The economic outlook is generally positive. Real GDP 
growth is expected to improve moderately to 3.1 in 2012. 

5. 
Despite the recent adverse effects generated by the global economic crisis, 
Guatemala’s external debt rating is just shy of investment grade. Moody's rates Guatemala’s 
foreign currency Government bonds Ba1, with a stable outlook.7 In supporting the rating, 
Moody's cited a stable macroeconomic environment supported by prudent fiscal and monetary 
policies, a manageable debt burden and limited roll-over risk plus multilateral funding support. It 
also noted the debt-to-GDP ratio of 23 percent low compared to 45 percent for similarly rated 
countries. It stressed, however, that Guatemala’s economy has lagged in growth compared to 
similarly rated sovereigns, and pointed that an average GDP growth since 2003 of 3.6 percent 
was not enough to make significant inroads on the country's large social and infrastructure needs.  

6. 
The Government increased social expenditure over the CPS period. The Government 
undertook, as part of its development program, efforts to enhance and protect social 
expenditures, including the initiation of a flagship Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program. 
Since its launch in 2008, the coverage of the program has been expanded to 307 out of 333 
municipalities, benefiting over 949,500 families.  The CCT “Mi Familia Progresa” expanded 
more rapidly than any program of its kind in the region; currently 22 percent of the Guatemalans 
are recipients of the program’s benefits. The program is, similar to several other social programs, 
managed by the Council for Social Cohesion and located at the Office of the President. It has 
been criticized for alleged links to electoral politics, poor transparency and a lack of sufficient 
supply-side response to the enhanced demand for education and health services.8 Driven by the 
expanding CCT and rural development programs, social expenditures increased from 4.4 percent 
(2008) to 5.3 percent (2010) of GDP contributing to the growth in the fiscal deficit.   

7. 
Progress has been made in reducing absolute poverty and improving access to 
health, education and nutrition.  The incidence of absolute poverty came down during the CPS 
period; with a steeper decrease in poverty in urban areas. The latest estimate is that the Gini 

7   Fitch Ratings has the Central American nation at BB-plus, equal to Moody's rating. Guatemala is rated BB by Standard & Poor's, one notch 
below Moody's. 
8   A December 2010 study placed the country’s CCT program 9 out of 16 in Latin American in terms of transparency and access to information. 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
coefficient of income concentration has decreased as well. According to the 2012 UNDP Human 
Development Report, health and education indicators have improved in Guatemala since 2008. 
However, the country still ranks below the average in the region—at the bottom in Latin 
America, along with Nicaragua and Haiti.  

8. 
Crime and violence are on the rise. The increase in crime and insecurity in Guatemala 
is notable. The rise in homicides has continued unabated, reaching 47 per 100,000 in 2009 – 6.2 
percent and 50 percent above the 2008 and 2004 levels respectively. Not surprisingly, 78 percent 
of Guatemalans consider it the principal problem in the country. The Government’s measures to 
strengthen justice and security forces included the extension of the mandate of the UN’s 
International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), the training of over 5,500 
new police officers in 2008-09 (more than in 2004-2008 combined), and the removal of 1,700 
police officers on grounds of corruption. In addition, Guatemala has joined other Central 
American countries to address jointly the challenges of crime, violence and insecurity.  On a 
positive note, Guatemala is the only country in the northern triangle where homicide rates have 
persistently decreased since 2009. Still, assaults and other indicators driving citizen perceptions 
about insecurity remain high.  

9. 
The difficult political environment prevented faster advances in much needed 
structural reforms. A good example has been the tortuous path of increasing tax revenues and 
the difficulties in passing a tax policy reform. The new Government that came in 2012 was able 
to get a tax reform approved in part because it had a de facto majority in Congress and negotiated 
several measures with the private sector. Lack of needed reforms to improve competitiveness has 
translated into low international rankings for Guatemala in doing business and limits the capacity 
of the Government and the private sector to profit from the country’s assets, including its sound 
macro-management, access to regional markets, superb natural resources, and an entrepreneurial 
culture. In a nutshell, while Guatemala has made progress in moving toward democracy and 
building institutions after a 36 year civil war, much remains to be done in generating the 
foundations for strong broad-based economic growth.   
(III) Highlights of the detailed evaluation of program performance 
10. 
This evaluation follows the general structure of the CPS pillars, namely— (i) 
Enhancing Fundamentals; (ii) Sustainable Growth and Productivity; and (iii) Expanding 
Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups. Annex Table #1 provides a detailed stock taking of the 
results proposed in the CPS and revised by the Progress Report. The main finding is that 
although delivery of results as adjusted by the Progress Report was relatively good, the impact of 
the program on the higher level development outcomes fell short of original expectations.   

Enhancing Fundamentals 

11. 
The ‘Enhancing Fundamentals’ pillar sought to maintain macroeconomic stability, 
while expanding fiscal space for priority spending, and improving governance and 
transparency. Delivery of results under this pillar was mixed. As noted, the country maintained 
macroeconomic stability without compromising its debt position or the international rating of its 
paper. However, it was not possible to expand the fiscal space as hoped and the increase in social 
spending shifted the composition of public expenditures towards consumption at the cost of 
investment.  At the same time, Bank operations did provide crucial support to a range of country-

40 

 
 
 
 
level achievements in economic management and governance, with repercussions for the 
country’s resilience and macroeconomic stability during the economic crisis.  Progress was made 
in several governance-related areas, driven in part by the fact that the country was a CGAC pilot. 
However, these gains have yet to have a full development impact as measured by global 
indicators as pointed to by IEG in its review of the Integrated Financial Management III ICR. 
IEG notes that “while the scale of reforms has been considerable, it is difficult to see evidence of 
improved overall Governmental effectiveness.” The IEG review suggests that “it is possible that 
a much longer time span is needed before improved processes translate into outcomes.” 
Persistence would then be needed to ensure institutional reforms bear fruit over the medium and 
long term. 

12. 
It was not possible to expand the fiscal space given the difficult internal and external 
environments. While the country maintained macro-economic stability, the contribution of the 
CPS program to this achievement was limited. The center of the CPS effort was on increasing 
fiscal space with the support of the DPL series approved in 2008 (First and Second 
Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional DPLs). The series is now completed and the achievement 
of outcomes has been rated as moderately satisfactory by the team ICR and its IEG review. As 
the tax reform that the DPL was intended to support did not passed, the original revenue targets 
were revised in the DPL and by the Progress Report. The revised targets were not met either, 
even if by a small percentage. As the Government undertook a mild anti-cyclical fiscal policy to 
face the crisis, public consumption expenditures rose from slightly over 9 percent of GDP in 
2008 to close to 11 percent for 2011. Even if public investment dropped somewhat from 4.5 
percent in 2008 to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2011, the fiscal deficit expanded and with it the ratio of 
public debt to GDP.  

13. 
The incoming Government in 2012 passed a long-awaited tax reform. After a long 
history of failed attempts at tax reform, the incoming Government obtained approval a tax 
reform. The tax reform comprises two laws: Law 4-2012 (Ley Anti-Evasion II) and Law 10-
2012. It is comprehensive, covering corporate and personal income tax, registration of vehicles, 
credit from VAT, dividends, transfer pricing, and a number of simplification issues. The overall 
revenue impact is expected to be roughly 1 percentage point of GDP by 2013. The main impact 
is expected to be under the personal income tax, as a number of exemptions have been removed 
(e.g., until now individuals could claim the amount of VAT from their purchases as a credit 
against their income tax liability). Corporate income tax rates will be reduced progressively from 
31 to 25 percent but dividends will be taxed at 5 percent and, crucially, a number of deductions 
are removed so the overall take from corporate income is expected to increase. The tax reform 
also enhances the enforcement powers of the tax and customs administration agency (SAT). 

14. 
Progress in improving governance in the public sector (fiscal) continued. The most 
notable advances in public sector reform include the expansion of the country’s public financial 
management system (SIAF), the expansion of its e-procurement system (Guatecompras), the 
modernization of its tax administration agency (SAT) and the strengthening of financial sector 
supervision and transparency. Driven by the financial management TA project, SIAF and 
Guatecompras have improved transparency at all levels of Government.  SIAFMUNI has been 
expanded to all 333 municipalities in the country. The supporting TA project has been 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
completed, with achievement of outcomes rated as satisfactory by both the team and IEG.  This 
risk to development outcomes, however, has been judged significant by IEG.  

15. 
The quality of financial sector institutions has improved as well. The DPL series 
approved in 2008 (First and Second Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional DPLs) helped tighten 
financial sector regulation, specifically the drafting and implementation of a new manual of risk-
based supervision. The resulting improved financial conglomerate supervision, a crisis 
simulation exercise and revised international accounting standards for the country’s Central 
Bank, among others, contributed to the sector’s stability during the crisis while enhancing its 
transparency over the long haul. The banking sector also benefited from IFC financing for 
domestic banks as well as Bank technical assistance through the Financial Sector Reform and 
Strengthening (FIRST) initiative and a previous Financial Sector TA loan. The sector’s 
improving health enabled IFC to commit US$409.7 million to three private Guatemalan banks 
both in trade finance guarantees and long-term loans during the FY09-FY12 CPS period.  

16. 
As a CGAC pilot country during FY09-11, Guatemala benefited from additional 
resources to address critical GAC shortcomings. These resources developed joint priorities 
with the GoG, which was a receptive and an interested counterpart. Resources were targeted to 
areas critical to increase the GAC impact of the Bank portfolio and engage a diverse array of 
State and non-State (or civil society) actors. Key activities included: (a) the creation for 
Guatemala’s Congress of a new website that informs  citizens about the work of their elected 
deputies; (b) a cell-phone-based beneficiary survey of the country’s CCT program whose 
innovative methodology was subsequently disseminated in an LCR;  (c) the ‘SIAF Mirror’ 
program that  trained over 100 members of specialized CSOs in social audits using the Bank-
financed SIAF and GUATECOMPRAS systems; and (d) assessments of the use of extra-
budgetary accounts and the executive’s internal audit function following best practices that 
served, in the first case, as a basis for a new regulatory framework. The GAC agenda also 
benefited from a US$2.2m Trust Fund to strengthen Guatemala’s Comptroller General’s Office. 
In particular, this TF is helping strengthen: (i) the country’s public financial control framework; 
(ii) the methodology used for specialized non-financial audits as well as staff capacity; (iii) the 
essential institutional functions of the Comptroller General’s Office and (iv) civil society 
oversight of public financial management, following-up on a smaller-scale CGAC pilot social 
audit activity.  

17. 
In line with the Bank’s governance strategy note, ‘Guatemala’s C-GAC Experience’, 
country- and project-level GAC activities complemented Bank sectoral interventions. 
Priority focus  has been given to sectors prone to corruption. Starting in FY10, a policy dialogue 
on transparency in the procurement of pharmaceuticals (Guatemala faces the highest end-user 
prices in Central America) included a rapid assessment of the current national procurement 
mechanisms for medicines and a report laying out medium-term policy options and short-term 
interventions to improve accountability and efficiency. In FY11, this engagement was expanded 
with CGAC funds to assist the Government in the strengthening of the classification and 
technical specifications of pharmaceuticals in the tendering process and the monitoring of 
purchasing prices of pharmaceuticals over time, based on south-south exchange and international 
best practice. Moreover, Guatemala was one of the eight pilot countries in the world to 
participate in the CoST Initiative which focuses on improving transparency in the construction 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
sector and making sure that resources are used properly and quality outputs are delivered. The 
grant supporting this initiative has come to an end, but the Government has informed the Bank 
that it will continue CoST with its own funds. Most recently, the Bank has been assisting the 
Government with the country’s incorporation in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative 
(EITI).    

18. 
Capacity building activities further strengthened these governance interventions.  A 
‘Capacity Building for Indigenous People and Local NGOs in the Western Altiplano’  grant 
complemented the Bank-financed Rural Economic Development and Land Administration II 
projects to help build  capacity in organizational and economic activities among indigenous 
communities towards creating better job opportunities, improving incomes and increasing access 
to infrastructure. A ‘Improving Economic Diversification and Governance for Sustainable 
Community Livelihoods in Petén’ grant is seeking to strengthen the capacity of community-
based organizations and enterprises in Petén to implement community-based natural resource 
management initiatives; and a ‘Building capacity to stimulate private investment in basic 
services and housing for the poor in Guatemala’ grant seeks to transform the “Fideicomiso de 
Inversión Fondo Hipotecario Para La Vivienda” (FHV) into a liquidity and guarantee facility to 
stimulate private investment in housing.  
Sustainable Growth and Productivity  

19. 
The Sustainable Growth and Productivity pillar focused on strengthening the 
investment climate, rural development and productivity, sustainable energy, and natural 
disaster risk management. Expected results included, among others, increased foreign and 
domestic investment, an increased range of financial services available for rural producers and 
households, improved farmer access to markets, sustainable sources of energy, improved rural 
telecommunications, and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters.  

20. 

During the CPS period the competiveness rankings of the country do not show 
major improvements. The IFC ranking on the quality of Doing Business ranks Guatemala at 97 
in 2012, lower than in 2011, and slightly below the average for Latin America and the 
Caribbean, but ahead of the three countries in the Central America region (El Salvador, Costa 
Rica and Honduras).  Over the last five years, Doing Business reports significant improvements 
in institutions that facilitate access to credit and those for registering property. But, in some areas 
(starting a business, dealing with construction permits, and protecting investors) Guatemala 
ranks remarkably low. The World Competitiveness Report score has remained constant since 
2009 (84 in 2012), with low rankings in institutions, health and primary education and higher 
education. Crime and corruption are seen as the major roadblocks to doing business. Other 
similar rankings show either no or limited progress. The ratio of total investment to GDP is now 
lower than in 2007, as is Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), mostly due to the crisis. The link 
between global outcomes and the CPS interventions was weak; in part, because the CPS 
interventions were small and punctual and generated limited synergies. The economic and 
political crisis and the natural catastrophes within the CPS period affected delivery; but, progress 
was made in building the capacity to respond rapidly to natural calamities.   

43 

 
 
 
 
Box 1.  Building capacity to respond to national calamities 

To respond to the financial shock caused by the passing of Tropical Storm Agatha and the eruption of the Pacaya 
Volcano, the Government of Guatemala disbursed the whole amount of the DPL with CAT DDO on June 2010. The 
DPL with CAT DDO instrument provided a quick source of liquidity after the ratification by the National Congress of the 
Presidential Decree that declared the national state of emergency (Estado de CalamidadPública). Although the whole amount 
of the Guatemala DPL with a CAT DDO loan has been disbursed, the Government maintains its commitment with, and 
continues making progress toward implementing its DRM program. The operation supported the following results:

CPS projects and AAA under this pillar delivered on their commitments as per the 
Progress Report. The notable IBRD-supported achievements in the competitiveness realm 
include: (i) reduction in the number of steps to apply for a construction license to 19 and 
enhanced legal rights for creditors9, with IFC support ;   (ii) improved access to markets for rural 
producers through the creation of 128 new productive supply partnerships benefitting around 
11,600 indigenous farmers, with the support of the rural economic development project,  (iii) a 
cadastral surveying process, currently underway in seventeen municipalities, under the land 
administration project,  and (iv) the rehabilitation of 736 kms of rural and feeder roads under the 
Roads Project.  In addition, the World Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum 
analyzing the country’s crucial SME sector    (‘Let 10,000 Firms Bloom’.)  The CEM served as 
the technical basis for the design of the FY11 SME Development IL operation.10 

22. 
In addition, the CPS supported successful efforts to strengthen the capacity of the 
country to manage the impact of natural disasters.  The support came mainly through a 
Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Loan with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown 
Option (CAT DDO). The support has been quite effective in building institutions and in 
financing response to disasters.  Box 1 recounts in details the achievements under this project. 
The CAT DDO, in conjunction with a joint post-disaster needs assessment, has facilitated an 
informed and appropriate Government response to the damages caused by the mid-2010 Pacaya 
eruption and tropical storm Agatha. Moreover, productive rural infrastructure damaged by the 
natural disasters is being reconstructed through funding from the Rural Economic Development 
Project.  Municipal plans were also developed in 318 municipalities which included projects to 
stimulate local growth. Additional Bank assistance to strengthen disaster risk management, 
including the CAPRA Platform and support from GFDRR grants, has been forthcoming. 
Financial aid towards keeping the level of public expenditure was provided thru the DPL 
support. 

23. 
IFC’s Advisory Services supported this pillar through two private sector projects 
and 1 municipal project aimed at increasing productivity and competitiveness. In the 
agribusiness sector, a second project was started in 2011 with IFC’s global client ECOM, 
focused on helping 269 coffee producers implement sustainable farming practices, and earn 
sustainability premiums for their produce. In the microfinance sector, IFC supported Fundea’s 
transformation from a not-for-profit to a regulated financial entity. The advisory services project 
included a gap analysis on the current situation of the institution to determine areas that needed 
strengthening. IFC’s Advisory Services also supported a feasibility study to present to financial 
regulators and prospective investors. In the municipal sector, IFC advised four municipalities on 
ways to significantly reduce the number of days needed to issue a construction license, indirectly 
supporting the construction and housing sectors in these regions. 

9  
In this area, Guatemala posts its best rating in Doing Business 2012---place 8th in the world. 
10  
The CEM focused on the small and medium enterprise sector given its contribution to GDP and employment.  SME’s 
contribute 40% of GDP and 85% of employment (2009).  According to the State of the Region Report 80% of employment is in 
firms with less than 20 employees (2008). The AAA provided information on the potential binding constraints for the SMEs and 
besides contributing to the design of the SME project, it had an impact on the design of the new Government’s “Competitiveness 
Agenda”.

 ‘Expanding Opportunities’  

24. 
The ‘Expanding Opportunities’ pillar sought to enhance opportunities for 
vulnerable and at-risk groups through improving access to, and use of, social programs. 
The CPS program sought to contribute to this objective by: (i) increasing effectiveness of the 
CCT program by 
improving 
institutional and 
implementation arrangements, 
including 
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; (ii) expanding access to quality education among the 
poor and indigenous; (iii) improving and expanding access to health and nutrition services, with 
a special focus on maternal and child health; and (iv) expanding services and investments in 
other areas that would maximize the impact of the CCT program (i.e. rural roads, and 
electricity). Expected results included, among others, increased gross completion rates in primary 
school, increased access to public services (electricity, among others) and reduced chronic 
malnutrition among children.   

25. 
The country’s social protection system has been strengthened, with the initiation 
and rapid expansion of the country’s CCT program. The support to the country’s CCT 
program, for instance, has helped to foster conditionality compliance, with 2010 compliance 
rates reaching over 92.3 percent and 95.3 percent for education and health respectively. The 
program covered around 35 percent of the population. 11    It should be noted that the 
involvement of the Bank was limited to a technical dialogue as the operation intended to support 
this initiative was dropped due to difficulties obtaining approval in Congress. 

26. 
In parallel, access to education has been expanded with Bank support. Delivery of 
the results set for education has been good. The lower secondary Gross Enrollment rate (GER) in 
the poorest 196 municipalities increased from 41 percent in 2007 to 54.1 percent in 2011. 
Enrollment of main indigenous groups in 9th grade increased by 70 percent from 2007 to 2011, 
far above the targeted increase of 25 percent.  Completion rates in primary schools went from 67 
percent in 2007 to 81 percent in 2011. The contribution of the Bank has come through the 
Education Quality and Secondary Education Project. The success was due in part to the opening 
of targeted telesecundarias in poor areas; the approach benefited especially indigenous 
communities.   

27. 
Support in health is showing positive results. The Maternal and Infant Health and 
Nutrition Project (2006) is helping reduce the gap in maternal and infant health and nutrition 
indicators in rural and predominantly indigenous municipalities. As of 2011, the percentage 
increase in the number of institutional births (38%), percentage of women receiving postnatal 
care ten days after giving birth (35%), the percentage reduction in the indigenous to non 
indigenous maternal mortality ratio (approximately 50%) have surpassed their end of Project 
targets.  The percentage of children in growth monitoring and weighing sessions in participating 
communities has increased from 0 percent at the start of Project to 75 percent in 2011. The 
percentage of women who received at least one prenatal control has increased from 54.2 percent 
at the beginning of the project to 87 percent in 2011. The Project has renovated and equipped 33 
out of 38 health centers, of which 29 are already functional. Other notable achievements include 
the development a multi-cultural communication strategy to promote health and maternal-child 
nutrition (to date materials have been translated into 7 indigenous languages), and the

establishment of a Communications Resources Bank which is available to all local agencies 
working on maternal-child health issues. The Project has also facilitated culturally sensitive 
training for health staff and has been strengthening facility level staff evaluations regarding key 
care maternal-child care protocols, e.g. post-delivery practices.  It has also provided training and 
technical support to communities to strengthen their capacity to evaluate the performance of their 
own AINM-C activities using a few simple indicators.12 

28. 
The Bank provided additional support to maintain the levels of social expenditure. 
The Emergency Support for Social Services loan contributed to the maintenance of basic health 
and education services in an environment of fiscal strain. The loan, which was approved by the 
Bank’s Board in December 2010 and by the Guatemalan Congress in November 2011, provided 
US$100 million in quick-disbursing financing to help maintain the number of teachers and health 
workers providing basic services in the country’s poorest municipalities. However, the delay in 
Congressional approval meant that the first disbursement could only take place in late CY2011. 
(IV) Review of Bank’s performance 

29. 
The FY09-12 CPS was aligned with the main strategic direction of the Government 
program. The CPS pillars reflected the Government’s pro-poor agenda as well as WBG’s areas 
of comparative advantage. The CPS design drew on the lessons learned from the previous CAS. 
It provided alignment with the political cycle.  It included fewer but larger investment loans, and 
foresaw a sequence of the DPLs aligned with the budget cycle to facilitate implementation and 
provide the financial leeway to pursue fiscal reform while allowing for pro-poor expenditures. A 
natural disaster CAT-DDO strengthened the country’s resistance to natural disasters. To better 
align the program to Government priorities, the team undertook a thorough restructuring of the 
portfolio under implementation.  The lending program was harmonized with other development 
partners and complemented by a mix of non-lending instruments, based on alignment with the 
CPS pillars and rationalization to maximize the cumulative impact of the portfolio.  The 2010 
CPS-PR confirmed the areas of engagements, but revised the results framework to reflect 
changed circumstances and progress towards CPS objectives. 

30. With hindsight, the CPS design contained some weak points. First, it set itself lofty 
goals difficult to reach with the small program in place. Some examples include the intended 
increase in the fiscal space that was linked to a tax reform, the capacity to improve 
competitiveness and address governance challenges. Second, although the CPS restructured 
projects to better align them with the Government strategy, in some areas the interventions were 
too disconnected and lacked the necessary synergy to impact the country’s higher level 
outcomes. This was particularly the case in the area of competitiveness under the second pillar. 
Third, the CAS design could have heeded better the political risks that were present given the 
lack control of the Government in parliament.  In this difficult political environment, the CPS 
design did try doing things differently, such as a focus on DPLs and the Emergency Social 
Sector Investment Loan, but it was not enough to significantly improve impact. 

12  
The Infant Health and Nutrition Project supported undertaking a nutrition survey in 2010/2011 in the target areas of the 
project. The survey allowed setting reliable benchmarks to replace previous estimates. This means however that the impact of the 
Bank project will not be known until a follow-up nutritional status survey is conducted in 2013.

31. 
The delivery of the overall amount of resources during the CPS period was in line 
with the original expectations, but composition of the program was changed to address the 
emerging circumstances. During the CPS period, commitments delivered were US$884.5 
million dollars, slightly below the US$905 million originally estimated. The resources allocated 
through budgeted support operations increased from US$500 million projects to US$650 
delivered, to allow the country to carry out a pro-cyclical fiscal policy during the crisis. Given 
difficulties with advancing a tax reform, the CPS Progress Report dropped a foreseen fiscal DPL 
and, adjusting, the instrument, delivered a fast-disbursing operation focused on the social sectors 
and providing much-needed fiscal space in the aftermath of the global crisis and natural 
disasters. The operation, however, was blocked in Congress, and the delay in effectiveness 
required a six month extension. The Expanding Opportunities operation was not delivered due to 
a lack of support in Congress.  The Energy loan envisioned at the time of the Progress Report 
was also not delivered. IFC committed US$495.66 million in the CPS period and an additional 
US$100 million in mobilized funds contributed by IFC’s investment partners. In addition IFC 
committed US$50 million and an additional US$80 million in mobilized funds in regional 
companies based in Guatemala. Financing was channeled primarily to financial institutions 
(56 percent), the real sector (8 percent), and infrastructure (35 percent), which includes regional 
companies based in Guatemala.   

32. 
Similar to the lending program, the non-lending program was adjusted to focus on 
more urgent Government priorities and strengthen the country’s crisis response. Notable 
crisis-response adjustments included the ‘Financial Crisis Preparedness’ (FCP) TA and the 
‘Human Capital and Social Policies to Support Job Creation in Central America’ study. 
Adjustments to focus on more urgent Government priorities revolved primarily around the 
governance and economic area, including the initiation of the CoST, and Financial Sector 
Reform (FIRST)13 initiatives, support to the Comptroller General’s Office, a study on 
pharmaceuticals, a regional CAFTA-DR trade study and a credit bureau assessment under the 
Western Hemisphere Credit Reporting Initiative.  To accommodate the new priorities, the 
Country Social Analysis and the National Environment Plan for Sustainable Development study 
were canceled.   The CPS also placed a great deal of emphasis on improving governance through 
a strong transparency agenda, which was mostly supported through analytical work and trust-
fund activities.  In hindsight, while the quality of the AAA program over the CPS period was 
good, more efforts could have been made to stimulate debate and facilitate exchange of ideas on 
key priorities in the area of governance and competitiveness. 

33. 
Portfolio Performance.  Currently there are seven projects under implementation 
representing a commitment of US$400 million.  Half of the portfolio is undisbursed and a little 
over 40 percent of the portfolio is at risk.  Disbursements on the trust fund portfolio are also 
lagging.  Trust Funds are 65 percent undisbursed, roughly US$18 million.  The poor portfolio 
performance is due in part to structural factors in the country’s political and institutional system.  
Implementation lagged during the political transition due to the high turnover in Government 
officials and a weak institutional environment.  Most projects in the portfolio were restructured 
to meet the changing Government priorities, which also added to delays, particularly in the first

Guatemala has been the first Central American country to commit to the implementation of the FIRST initiative.  

48 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
half of the CPS.  Furthermore effectiveness delays due to the complicated political environment 
also affected portfolio performance.  In addition, despite the long-term involvement of the Bank 
in Guatemala, limited institutional knowledge about Bank procedures introduces implementation 
constraints due to the high mobility of the scarce technical personnel available in the country.  
IDB shares similar implementation issues and challenges in disbursing resources. 

34. 
The portfolio by the end of this CPS is likely to have a limited impact on the results 
for the next CPS because, of the 7 projects three will close in the next 12 months.  The CAT 
DDO has been fully disbursed.  The MSME project is not yet effective.  Despite the limited 
impact of projects expected on results, the present situation provides an opportunity to chart a 
new agenda with Guatemala addressing some of the limitations with investment lending and 
focusing on developmental impact. Trust Funds (TF) have played an important role in mobilizing 
additional resources to support critical interventions, such as in the area of governance. While the 
Bank has a relatively limited trust fund portfolio, the activities are well aligned with the portfolio 
and overall priorities defined in the CPS, especially to advance selected topics in governance and 
develop pilot activities.   

35. 
The IFC’s program focused on four key domestic economic sectors – banking, 
agribusiness, sustainable energy and telecommunications. IFC’s cumulative investment 
commitments from US$37 million (FY07-08) to US$234 million (FY09-10), thus providing 
important counter-cyclical financing during the crisis.  In the financial sector, the IFC provided 
$331.8 million in trade lines, making Guatemala one of LAC’s most active markets for this 
product. IFC committed an additional US$72.4 million in long-term funding to a locally-owned 
bank to support its growth strategy and market penetration, particularly in the SME sector. 
Within agri-business, the IFC invested $91 million in the sugar sector to expand the sugar, co-
generation and ethanol operations in the country. In addition to increasing output, these 
investments helped support over 40,000 jobs at two companies. In the telecommunications 
sector, a US$135 million operation is helping a mobile phone operator serve 700,000 additional 
mobile subscribers while increasing coverage in frontier regions and underserved rural areas. In 
addition, the IFC continues to seek to drive investments in renewable energy and help diversify 
generation, in particular in hydro and co-generation projects. Annex III provides a description of 
each of the projects in IFC’s current portfolio. 

36. 
Coordination with other donors.  Cooperation between the World Bank and the IDB 
has been strong.  The Rural Development Project is a co-financed operation with the IDB and at 
the Government’s request both institutions restructured the Project to meet the needs following 
the damage caused by tropical storm Agatha. Both the WB and IDB use the same procedure 
mechanisms for disbursement and procurement and supervise the project jointly.  Both 
institutions, along with the IMF, are providing technical assistance for public debt management.  
Mutual support and coordination in the area of gender has led to a fruitful work relation with the 
UN and other development agencies which have benefitted the WBG’s investment in the area of 
gender. 

37. 
The World Bank has been active in helping the Central American Region develop a 
regional platform that will facilitate addressing the challenges of crime and violence. The 
Bank has been instrumental in positioning crime and violence as a regional development issue.  

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Prepared under SICA (the Regional Central American System of Integration) auspices a Bank-
accompanied regional crime and violence summit met in Guatemala in June 2011.  The well-
represented summit concluded that the high level of crime is the primary development challenge 
that the region faces. In the summit, the Governments of the region presented a joint strategy on 
public safety, including an action plan with costed activities for donor financing, and a 
monitoring mechanism for follow up.  The Bank has also been undertaking consultations with 
civil society, the private sector and Government representatives in each of its country offices in 
Central America to identify priorities for regional coordination in crime and violence policies.

38. 
The Completion Report rates the WBG performance as moderately satisfactory. 
The WBG was prompt to support the country during the crisis through budget support and 
technical assistance, which complemented the country’s efforts to increase social spending while 
safeguarding macroeconomic stability. However, project implementation problems continued 
and the design of the strategy, while aligned with the objectives announced by Government, was 
not sufficiently mindful of the risks to the achievement of results, particularly in light of the 
Bank’s track record in Guatemala. AAA dissemination could have been more forceful in line 
with the aim of the building the reputation of the Bank as a knowledge provider. IFC played a 
critical countercyclical role. Its commitments to Guatemala hit a record $204.6 million in FY09, 
six times more than the average for previous years. These guarantees and loans, have performed 
well and supported nearly 50,000 private sector jobs. 

39. 
The Completion report rates the achievement of results as moderately satisfactory.  
CAS outcome results as redefined by the Progress Report were, for the most part, achieved or 
partially achieved. Notable achievements include the use of the CAT-DDO, improved service of 
health and education and a greater and more focused work on governance. There were a few 
shortcomings, though. The targeted ratio of tax revenues to GDP was unmet, even after the 
downward revision introduced by the Progress Report in line with the changes in the results 
framework of the supporting DPL. The required legal framework to improve revenue collection 
was approved as the new Government came in (2012) and the expectation is that revenue 
collection will increase relative to GDP (2013). Project restructuring and slow project 
implementation affected the delivery of results, and the Progress Report was adjusted as a result.  
The portfolio at the end of the CPS is expected to have a limited impact on results for the next 
period; however, it provides an opportunity to chart a new agenda with Guatemala for the future.   
(V) Key lessons and suggestions for the new CPS 

40. 
Develop realistic assessments of the likelihood to deliver results and, at the same 
time, maintain a critical assessment of what has been achieved. A CPS should focus on 
thematic strategies with clear and realistic results. In considering the likelihood of achieving 
results, attention should go beyond formal Government commitment to consider the factors that 
may block achieving the results, such as the difficult political economy in Guatemala. Such 
realistic assessments will improve the quality of the results framework as well as the 

14  
The Completion Report rates the achievements of results in line with the guidelines set by OPCS which states the 
evaluation should be based on the CAS outcomes and not on the country's broader development goals.   

50 

 
 
 
                                                 
understanding of the risks that follow, thus facilitating taking remedies to ease them. The focus 
on themes rather than projects will provide flexibility with the regard to the instruments selected.  

41. Keep simple and selective.  In line with the principle above, it is important to also be 
realistic about what can be achieved given the existing implementation capacity and country 
context.   Experience has shown that overly complex projects which involve more than one 
implementing agency have had a poor track record of performance.  The current CPS therefore 
proposes fewer operations in select areas where there is strong Government demand and an 
implementation agency with a proven ability to manage Bank projects well. 

42. 
The Bank should complement financing with a strong program on knowledge. The 
Bank should continue to foster a reputation for delivering high quality knowledge products and 
technical assistance. In doing so, it is best to adopt a systematic approach to AAA through a 
thematic focus and annual business plans to agree with Government on priorities. In addition, the 
Bank can support the authorities in scaling up successful pilot initiatives through program 
budgeting. 

43. 
A long history of implementation challenges has troubled the investment portfolio in 
Guatemala.  Early engagement with the new Government may avoid high turnover of 
counterpart staff.  The lack of technical capacity in Government makes training on Bank 
procedures, including particularly safeguards and procurement, a priority.   Since this is a 
problem shared by the IDB, it would be advisable for the two institutions to work together and 
explore alternative options to address implementation constraints through, for example, better 
project design and training of technical counterparts.   

44. 
The Bank and IFC should continue integrating their strategies both during initial 
CPS discussions and throughout the program’s life. IBRD and IFC cooperation would deliver 
improved results, as well as enhancing the quality of services to their public and private sector 
clients. IFC can play an important leadership role in supporting effort to improve productivity 
and enhance competitiveness.  

45. 
The Bank could further consolidate the work on governance, while assisting with a 
more focused attention on competitiveness. Since 1996, the Bank has supported a strategy to 
improve budget processes, transparency and civil society oversight. Great progress has been 
made in putting in place laws, organizations, and training people. Despite these efforts, 
Guatemala remains weak on governance, transparency and effectiveness. The next CPS should 
focus on consolidating gains to build the reputation of Government and enhance its legitimacy. It 
is relevant to note that Guatemala’s global ranking on competitiveness and governance did not 
improve during the CPS period calling for an increased effort to understand the linkages between 
program outputs and development outcomes.15   

46. 
The next CPS should explore ways to help the country address the challenges of the 
rising insecurity. One option is to work within regional context. A successful regional approach 
to crime and violence will require enhancing the capacity of SICA. Additionally, a successful 

15  
As already reported, these rankings include the Global Competitiveness and the Doing Business report. A similar point 
is made by IEG on its review of the ICR for the Integrated Financial Management III.

program must take into account the idiosyncrasies of each CA country to ensure that efforts and 
activities are appropriate given the different levels of political commitment and capacity that are 
present in each country.  Therefore, a complementary option is also needed to develop multi-
sectoral responses, focused on prevention involving cooperation and coordination with local 
actors and the international community. The Bank should also use its convening power 
systematically to rally the interest of other development partners around financing initiatives in 
areas which the Bank does not have a comparative advantage (i.e, strengthening of police force, 
prisons, judicial system etc.).

DPL Series (FY09,FY10) 

Guatemala was hit by both internal and external 
shocks during the CPS period which had an impact 
on the macro situation which could not be 
predicted.  The Bank provided support and 
financing during the crisis and also in response to 
disasters with an Emergency Investment Loan 
which helped to mobilize financing quickly.  
The CPS still achieved fiscal targets, in part 
because the Government was conservative, cutting 
back on investment and making adjustments in line 
with tax revenues. Targets on debt levels were also 
met but spending remains low (lowest in region as 
a share of GDP on a per/capita basis). 
The political aspect of the tax reform was 
underestimated. While there was a fairly broad 
consensus for a reform proposal among 
technicians, it did not get through Congress and 
instead was approved under the new 
administration.  Moving forward, the Bank should 
look for areas of engagement where there is a 
strong commitment and where it has a good 
understanding of the political economy.  The PER 
under preparation includes a political economy 
analysis to facilitate identification of areas for 
sustained reforms in public finance.

Modernization of PFM processes and practices 
require further effort as countries move towards 
advanced stages in the reform process. 
Implementing result-based budgeting techniques 
proved complex and not necessarily necessary in 
all cases. Gradual approaches and replication of 
pilot programs and best practices seem to be the 
right way to optimize the impact of these reforms. 

Similarly, public procurement systems are complex 
by nature. Adopting electronic-based platforms 
requires strong engagement not only from public 
sector regulatory entities and line units, but also 
from users and stakeholders in the private sector. 
Gradual and sequenced approach is also advised in 
this area.

Guatemala had a working e-procurement system, 
which improved the efficiency and quality of the 
assurance process. The internationally tested CoST 
methodology guaranteed orientation to the MSG 
members in implementation. 

MSG structure matters. Small group (6 instead of 
10 like other pilot countries) avoids lengthy 
consensus building exercises. Only a 1/3 of the 
MSG is the public sector, which helps promote 
continuity and avoid institutional memory loss 
during periods of high public sector turnover. 

Implementation was accelerated through TA 
provided by the CMU (i.e. supervision, managing 
finances).

Additional missions deployed to help improve 
the health referral system, ensuring that 
community leaders, household decision makers 
including husbands and mothers-in law, and 
mid-wives are also aware of the importance of 
timely referrals. . Community consultations 
were held to ensure that the facilities were also 
culturally responsive, especially with regard to 
indigenous practices. 

Despite facing administrative and financial 
challenges (e.g. delays in payments, spending 
ceilings set by the MOF, limits on trainings 
conducted in large venues such as hotels), it helps 
to have a stable and resourceful Project Team to 
move the Project forward.  For example the Project 
created e-learning modules to minimize travel and 
other related costs for training workshops when the 
Ministry of Health limited trainings in large venues 
such as hotels.  However, even a very good Project 
team can only go so far and the Government’s role 
in ensuring timely release of funds and signing of 
contracts is critical.

Additional technical missions deployed for the 
Community based Integrated Care for Children 
and Women (AINM-C) component to 
strengthen community based monitoring 
activities using simple indicators. 

Videoconferences arranged for South to South 
exchanges between the Panama and Guatemala 
Project Teams, as well as between the 
Guatemala Team and NGOs such as Merci 
Corps to exchange experiences in providing 
health and nutrition services and improving 
communications materials.    

The Project has been promoting the active 
involvement of communities (making efforts to 
also include fathers and midwives) in 
monitoring and promoting health and nutrition 
activities for women and children.  

members- aside from the main target population of 
young children and women of reproductive age -
because they also influence health and nutrition 
behavior including when and where to seek care. 
Develop and deliver key messages on behavioral 
change on health and nutrition that are simple and 
consistent and at the same time culturally sensitive 
given Guatemala’s multi-ethnic environment. 

Find ways to ensure sustainability of interventions 
despite changes in Government priorities. Due to 
the Government’s strategy to progressively shift 
service provision of AINM-C from NGOs to MOH 
staff with the support of community educators and 
also because the Project no longer has funds to 
contract NGOs, the Project team is collaborating 
with the MOH team, particularly the Extension of 
Coverage Program to improve the linkages 
between health staff and community educators to 
deliver AINM-C. In 2012, the Project is financing 
49 community educators while the Government is 
responsible for financing 22 community educators 
to ensure continuity of AINM activities in 9 
municipalities and 216 communities.  It is hoped 
that the Government will assume responsibility for 
the rest of the community educators when the 
Project ends and consider financing NGOs in areas 
previously financed by the Project that do not yet 
have any health facilities.

Annex 5.  Gender Issues in Guatemala 

1. 
Guatemala—despite some improvements over the last decade—continues to lag behind 
other countries in the region with regards to gender equality in particular in rural and indigenous 
areas. 

2. 
Guatemalan women lag behind their male counterparts in endowments, economic 
opportunities and voice and agency. And even more so, Guatemala is worse off than the very 
large majority of other countries in the region. As pointed out in the USAID Gender Assessment 
2009:  

“The inequality appears to be perpetuated by a vicious cycle whereby the marginalization 
of women contributes to low levels of education, poor health, and low earnings, which in 
turn generates dependency and feeds back into marginalization.  Dependency results in 
low levels of self-esteem, lack of understanding of rights and resources, and reluctance or 
inability to act independently. The dependence is reinforced by high levels and general 
acceptance of violence against women.” 

3. 
Gender issues in Guatemala must necessarily be analyzed at the intersection between 
gender and ethnicity as well as gender and urban versus rural residence. According to USAID 
2009, indigenous groups in Guatemala (including Mayan, Xinka, and Garifuna groups) account 
for approximately 43% of the population. In terms of indicators of health, education, poverty, 
access to social services and justice, as well as political participation, rural and indigenous 
women are the most disadvantaged segment of the population. There are thus limitations to this 
note, given that data disaggregated by sex and ethnicity was not available for all dimensions of 
gender equality discussed in this note. 

4. 
The share of female-headed households increased over the last years. From 2000 to 2006 
there was an increase of 4.1 percentage points of household headed by females, from 14.7 to 18.8 
percent: almost one in five households in Guatemala reported a woman as the head of the 
house19. Interestingly (and most probably due to the higher probability of receiving remittances), 
female-headed households are less likely to be poor if compared to male-headed households: 
While 53.4% of male-headed households were poor and 16.7% were extremely poor in 2006 this 
compares to only 40.8% and 16.7% respectively of female-headed households20. 

Endowments21 
Education  
5. 
In contrast to what has been observed for the majority of countries in LAC, in Guatemala 
the gender education gap favors boys. This gap has been shrinking but it is still larger than for 
lower-middle income countries.   

6. 
The female-to-male enrollment ratio in primary education in 2010 was 0.95, slightly 
farther from parity than other countries in the region (Costa Rica 0.98, El Salvador 0.96, and 
LAC average 0.97). The boy-girl gender gap in the primary completion rate however stands at

All data in this note stem from WDI (access July 3rd 2012).

6.2 percentage points (2008), meaning that boys are more likely to finish primary school if 
compared to girls. This also differs from the trend in the region (boy girl gap: in LAC -1.0, in El 
Salvador -3.4, in Mexico -1.1).  While the number of girls and boys out of primary school has 
clearly gone down since 2000 (152.089 girls versus 92.826 boys), a gender gap can still be 
observed (27139 girls versus 4558 boys in 2010). 

7. 
Girls are also disadvantaged in enrollment in secondary schooling: The female-to-male 
ratio for Guatemala is 0.93 (2010). LAC average is 1.08, thus showing a gap in secondary 
schooling that favors girls. In comparison to Guatemala, both El Salvador and Costa Rica show a 
slight gap favoring girls (1.02 and 1.05 respectively). Honduras is an outstanding case with a 
large gender gap – here the female to male ratio is 1.26 (2008) highlighting the problem of boys’ 
underachievement in schooling.  

8. 
Women in Guatemala also have less years of schooling if compared to men (5.5 years for 
females and 5.7 years for males (Vakis, Munoz and Coello 2011)). It is noteworthy though that 
both annual growth rates for females and males have been higher if compared to other countries 
in Central America (2.9% for females and 2.7% for males). 

9. 
According to the WDR 2012, adolescent girls and boys in Guatemala both report lack of 
money and lack of interest as important reasons for not being enrolled in school. But among 13- 
to 24-year-olds, 33% of girls that are not enrolled said household responsibilities were the main 
reason and 56% of boys listed work outside the home as the core reason (also mentioned by 
another 18% of girls) (WDR 2012, citing Hallman and others 200722). This clearly shows how 
gender stereotypes have an impact on women´s and girls´ opportunities in the country. 

10. 
In tertiary education, the female-to-male enrollment ratio shows almost parity 0.99 
(2007) – while in most countries in Latin America, women are more likely to be enrolled in 
tertiary education if compared to their male counterparts (compare for instance El Salvador 1.16 
and LAC average of 1.28).  

11. 
Literacy rates for youths (88.77% for boys versus 84.32% for girls, 2009) also underline 
the lower educational outcomes for girls in the country. Here again, Guatemala goes against the 
regional trend: Generally girls show higher literacy rates in LAC if compared to boys (see for 
instance literacy rates: 98.6% for girls versus 97.7% for boys in Costa Rica; 95.05% for girls 
versus 92.69% for boys, Honduras). The gender gap is even larger when looking at adult literacy 
rates—adult women clearly lag behind men in Guatemala (literacy rates: 80.02% for men 
compared to 69.48% for women in 2009). Female literacy rates are not only low compared to 
male ones, but also extremely low if compared to those of women in the other LAC countries: 
Literacy rates amongst female adults: Guatemala 69.48% (2009), Nicaragua 77.92% (2005), 
Costa Rica 96.27% (2009), Honduras 83.45% (2007). There are huge discrepancies in literacy 
when considering gender and geographic location: In cities, the gap between men and women is 
small (89.5% for men and 86% for women) but in rural areas 70% of men but only 57% of the 
women are literate (USAID 2009). Moreover, indigenous women in Guatemala are twice as

likely to be illiterate than non-indigenous women (WDR 2012). USAID 2009 also states that a 
third of rural indigenous women are unable to communicate and read in Spanish which limits 
their mobility, as well as their access to labor markets and public services. However, the World 
Bank Poverty Assessment 2009 states that gender, economic and indigenous gaps in literacy 
have been shrinking over the last decade. 
Health 
12. 
The indicators for sexual and reproductive health are among the lowest in the Latin 
America and Caribbean region. Guatemala still has very high fertility rates; it is one of the four 
countries worldwide that have fertility rates above 4 (4.05 births per woman) and are outside 
Sub-Saharan Africa (WDR 2012)—compared to other countries in the region (such as Costa 
Rica: 1.8 or Nicaragua: 2.67) and the average for the region (2.2).  

13. 
It is worrisome that the maternal mortality ratio is still very high at 120 (modeled 
estimate, per 100,000 live births, 2010) which is clearly above the average for the region (80.42, 
2010). To compare, El Salvador (81) and Honduras (100) show lower rates and Costa Rica is 
doing much better with a rate of 44.  

14. 
The rate of births attended by skilled staff increased to 51.4% in 2009 from 41.4% in 
2002, but it is still clearly below the average rate for the LAC region (89%). Similarly, the 
contraceptive prevalence rate increased to 54.1% in 2009 from 43.3% in 2002 but still lags 
behind the average rate for the region (74.64% in 2010, compare also El Salvador: 72.5% in 
2008).  

15. 
According to USAID 2009, similar as for education indicators, there are huge 
discrepancies in health indicators if comparing rural versus urban areas: While in 2005, the 
maternal mortality rate was 122 deaths/100,000 live births on average, yet in the northern rural 
departments, the average rate was 175, and in Alta Verapaz, 266. In urban areas, 72% of the 
births were attended by trained medical personnel compared to only 32% in rural areas.  

Economic Opportunities 
16. 
In Guatemala female labor force participation was 48.8% in 2010; this is similar to 
average rates for Central America, and shows a steep increase from 41.9% in 2000. Male labor 
force participation was 88.3% in 2010; resulting in a ratio of female to male labor participation 
rate of 0.55 in 2010. 

17. 
The Duncan index for occupational segregation in Guatemala stands at 0.47 and, 
noteworthy, this has been increasing by 1.8% annually. Out of all Central American Countries, 
Guatemala and Panama are the only examples where segregation has been increasing.23  

18. 
Central America as a whole has relatively high levels of informality – but Guatemala 
shows the highest rates of all Central American countries with 73.1% of all females and 62.9%24 
of males working in the informal sector (compare for example to Honduras: 61.4% for females

47.0% (2006))25. 

19. 
Self-employment and microenterprise employment are the most important sources of 
remunerated work for poor women in most Central American countries. Close to 40 % of 
employed women are self-employed in Guatemala (similar to Honduras, Nicaragua and El 
Salvador). Female self-employment levels have been increasing at a slow pace, similar to male 
self-employment rates26.  

20. World Bank 2009b shows evidence from a Special Household Survey Module in 
Guatemala (2006): While increased education raises the probability of men becoming 
entrepreneurs, it diminishes the chances of entrepreneurship for women. An additional year of 
schooling makes a woman more than 0.3 percent less likely to work as an entrepreneur, while it 
increases the probability of a man becoming an entrepreneur by almost 0.3 percent. This gender 
difference, albeit small, may signal that entrepreneurship in Guatemala is not a preferred option 
by educated women, in contrast to men. 

21. 
Similarly, household wealth reduces the chance of women being self-employed 
entrepreneurs. The opposite is found for men. This reinforces the idea that for many women, 
entrepreneurship is not a preferred option, and those who have the means are less likely to 
undertake it.    

22. 
Another difference when observing female-owned and male-owned firms: 67 percent of 
female entrepreneurs in Guatemala have no employees (self-employed), while 57 percent of men 
entrepreneurs are self-employed.  There are relatively similar percentages of micro firms 
(between 2 and 4 employees) owned by men and women. For businesses with more than 
5 employees, the gender difference is significant.  They represent 7 percent of all male-owned 
businesses and less than 2 percent of female-owned firms.27 

23. 
A report cited by Vakis suggests that only 11% of Guatemalan households with 
microenterprises reported having received credit, compared to 23% in Nicaragua and 29% in 
Panama (Tejerina and Westley, 2007). Women micro-entrepreneurs were even less likely to have 
received credit: only 5% in Guatemala. Another report shows that, over a five-year period, 
Guatemalan microenterprises operated by female entrepreneurs were more stable than those 
operated by men: Drop-out rates from the credit program were much lower among female 
entrepreneurs, as were rates of transition back into the non-entrepreneurial labor market and 
foreign emigration (Wydick, 2002). On average, female-owned enterprises continued to grow in 
terms of hired labor, albeit slowly, while growth in male enterprises was slightly negative five 
years after microfinance borrowing:

24. 
Regarding the reduction of earning gaps that has been shown in the Central America 
gender study (Vakis 2011) as trend common in the CA countries – it has to be noted that 
Guatemala has been amongst the best performers, together with El Salvador and Honduras: 

Gender Earning Gaps Over the Decade (Ratio of Male to Female Earnings)

69 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25. Women contribute up to 40 percent of the total income generated in Central 
America, a figure that has increased over the past decade. These trends have been widespread 
across the region, with some variation. In Guatemala, women’s share of total income was 
34 percent (2006) and has increased annually by 1 percent28. 

26. 
Trends regarding dynamics along welfare distribution: In Guatemala (as in Honduras 
and Nicaragua), women above the 80th percentile of the distribution have entered the labor force 
faster than men and poorer women. In fact, labor force participation (LFP) among poor women 
has declined in these three countries. This contrasts with Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama 
where women in the poorest households have made the most progress over the decade. 
Consistent with the results for LFP, the analysis of earnings gaps along the welfare distribution 
suggests heterogeneous performances. In Guatemala and Costa Rica, the earnings gaps reduced 
the fastest among the less poor – in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama instead, poor 
women experienced the largest gains in earnings. Therefore, Guatemala is the only country 
where poor women experienced reductions in LFP and a widening earnings gap29. 

27. 
There is a clear division of tasks and spheres when comparing women and men in 
Guatemala. While women are almost exclusively responsible for housework and child care, men 
are mostly responsible for market work—86 percent of housework and child care is done by 
women and 28 percent of market work is done by men (WDR 2012, team estimates based on 
time use surveys). Also, 31 percent of urban and 52 percent of women in rural areas have no 
income on their own (ECLAC 2007), as compared to 32 percent of women in LAC on average. 

28. 
According to the OECD there are no legal restrictions on women’s access to land, but 
the percentage of female landowners is extremely low. When land is allotted to a household, it is 
registered under the name of both spouses. However, when it is allotted to an individual, women 
benefit in only 10 percent of cases. The Government has established special programs to improve 
women’s access to land and correct the current imbalance in favor of men (OECD, SIGI). 

29. 
Several characteristics distinguish female-owned firms from male-owned firms in LAC: 
Female-owned firms tend to be concentrated in fewer economic sectors than male-owned firms, 
operating mainly in the commerce, services and manufacturing sectors. This is also true in 
Guatemala where more than 70 percent of businesswomen who are employers are in the 
commerce sector 

Agency 
30. 
Besides endowments and economic opportunities, agency is the third dimension of 
gender equality according to the WDR 2012. It is there defined as follows: 

“By agency we mean an individual’s (or group’s) ability to make effective choices and to 
transform those choices into desired outcomes. Agency can be understood as the process 
through which women and men use their endowments and take advantage of economic 

28 Vakis, Munoz and Coello 2011 
29 Ibid 

70 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
opportunities to achieve desired outcomes. Thus, agency is key to understanding how 
gender outcomes emerge and why they are equal or unequal”. (WDR 12) 

31. 
This shows that women’s agency influences their ability to build human capital and 
pursue economic opportunities. Women’s agency also matters for the welfare of their children. 
Agency, or a lack thereof, can manifest itself in many different ways, certainly in female political 
participation, gender-based violence, and teenage pregnancy. 

Legal and institutional Framework 
32. 
Article 4 of the 1985 Constitution of Guatemala upholds the principle of ‘equality for all 
individuals’. In 2002, the Penal Code was amended by decree to criminalize discrimination. Still, 
the OECD points out that “Gender-related legislation seems to be applied in few cases and strong 
patriarchal traditions persist in the judicial administration”30. 

33. 
Also, there are legislative restrictions to married women’s rights. Article 255 of the Civil 
Code stipulates that “when the husband and wife hold joint parental authority over minors, the 
husband must represent the minor and administer his or her property” (OECD, SIGI). 

34. 
The two principal Government institutions for gender and women’s issues are the 
Secretaría Presidencial de la Mujer (SEPREM) and the Defensoría de la Mujer Indígena (DEMI).  

35. 
SEPREM advises on and coordinates public policy and is responsible for promoting the 
development of Guatemalan women and the fostering of a democratic culture. It operates under 
the direct supervision of the President of the Republic and is the highest executive body 
responsible for issues related to the advancement of women and the mainstreaming of gender 
equity. It is very active and participates in the general, social and rural development cabinets. 
The Presidential Secretary for Women, as head of SEPREM, has the rank of Minister of State 
(CEDAW 2007). In 2007, SEPREM issued the 2008-2023 Política Nacional de Promoción y 
Desarrollo Integral de La Mujer, identifying four strategic spheres for action (political/cultural, 
economic, social, and institutional) to “promote the participation of women of diverse ethnic and 
cultural identities in support of national development, assuring the full exercise of their 
individual and collective rights, to strengthen democratic and intercultural coexistence.” The 
policy identifies ten global pillars for intervention: equity in socio-political participation; cultural 
identity; economic development; workforce; natural resources, land, and housing; and justice; as 
well as the eradication of violence, discrimination, and racism against women; holistic health 
services; education with attention to gender and cultural identity; and strengthening of 
institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women31. 

36. 
The Office for the Defense of Indigenous Women’s Rights (DEMI) was formed as a 
part of the Peace Accords and has been converted into a department of thePresidency of the 
Republic, with administrative, technical and financial management capacity. Its task is to address

the particular situations of vulnerability, lack of protection and discrimination faced by 
indigenous women. The institution has been encouraging in supporting indigenous women to 
speak out about the injustices and offenses they encounter and to pursue action through the court 
system. 

37. 
National Coordinating Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence 
against Women (CONAPREVI): To fulfill the obligation of the State of Guatemala to 
implement and follow the provisions of CEDAW, CONAPREVI was set up by law to 
coordinate, advise on and promote public policies for preventing, tackling, punishing and 
eradicating domestic violence and violence against women. This State agency is made up of the 
public sector bodies and institutions responsible for tackling violence against women and civil 
society: (1) the President of the Republic, represented by SEPREM; (2) the Attorney General of 
the Republic or his representative; (3) the President of the judiciary or his representative; (4) the 
President of the Board of Directors of the National Statistical Institute; (5) a representative of the 
Program for the Prevention and Eradication of Domestic Violence (PROPEVI); and, representing 
the women’s movement, three delegated members of the Network for Non-Violence against 
Women. CONAPREVI leads the implementation of the National Plan for the Prevention and 
Eradication of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women (PLANOVI 2004-2014) 
(CEDAW 2007). 

Political Participation 
38. 
Overall, women are under-represented at all levels of Government in Guatemala. The 
percentage of parliamentary seats occupied by women increased to 12% in 2010 (2008-2012 
administration), and up to 13.9% under the current administration32 so that Guatemala has now 
reached the level of lower-middle income countries (13.9%) – however it still lags behind if 
compared to LAC average (24%). The rate is also lower than in its neighboring countries, for 
instance Nicaragua (18.5%), and clearly below one of the LAC champion in political 
participation of women, Costa Rica (36.8%).  

39. 
Notably though, the political representation at the local level is very low with only 1.8% 
of mayors and 8.8% of town council members being female (ECLAC, 2009). 

Adolescent Fertility 
40. 
Guatemala’s adolescent fertility rate has been slowly decreasing for the past 10 years to 
reach 104.3 in 2010; however this is still very high compared to the LAC region average rate 
(71.7, 2010). Nicaragua has a higher rate at 110 but the rate in Honduras for instance is lower at 
90. The law prohibits marriage for those below 18 years without parental authorization. The 
incidence of early marriage is high: a 2004 United Nations report estimated that 26% of girls 
between 15 and 19 years of age were or had been married.  

Violence against Women 
41. 
Femicide is one of the most critical gender problems facing women in Guatemala and is 
cited in several sources (including USAID, WHO, ECLAC etc.): “In recent years the term 

32 Based on information from www.congreso.gob.gt 

72 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
‘feminicide’ or ‘femicide’ has gained common usage in designating the murders of women for 
gender reasons, although this is a debated issue and consensus has not yet been reached on use of 
the term for legislative ends.  However, agreement has been reached that this form of violence— 
seen at its most terrifying in Mexico and Guatemala—must be eliminated” (ECLAC 2007). 

42. 
To combat the critical issue of (deadly) violence against women, the Commission on 
Femicide was formally established in March 2006. It is made up of delegates from the 
legislative, executive and judicial branches and representatives of human rights and security 
institutions and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. Its coordination was delegated to SEPREM.  

43. 
Data for the first half of 2012 (January-June) shows an 11.5 percent decline in the 
number of women killed, down from 381 from January-June 2011, to 337 in 2012 (INACIF 
2012). Of those deaths, 65 percent of these women were killed by a firearm. Violence against 
women is more prevalent in urban areas, especially for women living in poverty. 

44. 
The legal structure in place to criminalize violence against women and to provide the 
basis for prosecuting these cases includes: Ley Contra la Violencia Intrafamiliar (Law against 
Intra-family Violence), Ley Contra el Femicidio y Otras Formas de Violencia Contra la Mujer 
(Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women), Ley para Prevenir, 
Sancionar y Erradicar la Violencia Intrafamiliar (Law to Prevent, Sanction, and Eradicate 
Domestic Violence) and the Código Penal (Penal Code). However, OECD cites that violence 
against women is prohibited by law, but is not punishable by a prison sentence (OECD, SIGI). 
There are heavy constraints to penalize the perpetrators: Domestic violence can lead to legal 
proceedings only if visible traces of the abuse remain on the victim for at least 10 days. Another 
very worrisome provision is the fact that rapists are exempt from prosecution in Guatemala if 
they are married to their victim and the Penal Code lays down the criterion that women must be 
“honest” to be considered victims (OECD, SIGI, 2011). These provisions pose severe constraints 
to women’s rights and access to justice.  

45. 
There have been some positive trends in addressing domestic violence in 2012 to date. In 
a stronger attempt to enforce the Law Against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against 
Women, more domestic violence cases have resulted in the offending spouse being sent to jail in 
preventative detention. The Director of Strategy at the Public Ministry said that the populations 
in jails have been growing for these reasons. Over the past year, there is also evidence that more 
female police officers and judges are being used to help female victims. 

46. While the Government has a system of services for victims in place this same one is 
concentrated in the Guatemala City area. The reforms regarding the increased access to justice 
are thus not reaching the rest of the country and gender-based and intra-familiar violence are not 
sufficiently addressed, especially in rural areas. Discussions with representatives from 
Government and civil society also suggest that a large share of women are unaware of their 
rights and avenues to access the judicial system. 

73 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Crime and Violence  
47. 
Studies find that males commit crimes and are incarcerated for them more than females. 
This is particularly true for violent crimes. More males are also victims of crime. Whereas 337 
women were killed in Guatemala during the first 6 months of 2012 (January-June), 2,559 men 
were killed. Of these male deaths, 79 percent of victims were killed by a firearm. 

48. 
According to the Central American and Caribbean Commission of Police Chiefs (World 
Bank 2011b) 14,000 persons are estimated to be members of 434 gangs. A study conducted by 
the Office of the Attorney General for Human Rights (Procuradoría de Derechos Humanos) 
which analyzed the causes of death for youth ages 25 and under for the period of July 2002-
August 2003, found that 27 percent of these deaths were caused by gang-member attacks on non-
gang youths (WB 2011b).  
Gender and Gangs  
49. 
In general, because 90 percent of the core members of the gangs are young men, the 
relationship of young women to the gangs and the effect of gender relations on the gang 
activities have received little attention33. The 2006 USAID Gang Assessment for Central 
America asserts that the role of females in male-dominated gangs is subordinate and that sexual 
exploitation by male gang members is common. According to ex-gang members young women 
substantially out-number young men in the “support network” that surrounds the core members. 
These networks are made up of female family members and girlfriends who may serve as 
runners and messengers. Although the Gang Assessment asserts that “young men are both more 
likely to be victims of gang violence, as well as perpetrators”, gang connections also have been 
shown to be a factor in the increased murder of women.34  

33  
34  

USAID Central America Gang Assessment 2006 
USAID suggests more direct investigation and attention needs to be given to the role of women in the gangs.

Annex 6.  Indigenous Peoples and Social Inclusion in Guatemala 

1. 
Indigenous Peoples. The majority of indigenous peoples in Guatemala are of Mayan 
descent and are dispersed throughout the country with the largest populations in rural 
departments north and west of Guatemala City, most notably Quiché, Alta Verapaz, Sololá, 
Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango and Huehuetengango. They are identified by language, with 
Quiche, Cakchiquel, Mam (Maya), Tzutujil, Achi, and Pokoman being the most common of the 
approximately 26 indigenous languages spoken.  Indigenous groups moved to smaller land plots 
in higher elevations and were subject to indentured labor on foreign-held lands in the 
“encomienda” land system. Over time, the decreasing size of their land plots has forced 
indigenous Guatemalans into wage labor on non-indigenous owned lands. Today, less than one 
percent of agricultural producers control 75 percent of the best land in Guatemala. Indigenous 
peoples find wage labor through seasonal migration. 

2. 
Peace Accords Implementation. Major progress has been made in addressing the 
concerns of the indigenous population and implementing the 1996 Peace Accords.  Governments 
have supported the cadastral system and the inclusion of indigenous peoples in demarcation of 
protected areas ensuring that they are not affected by any restriction of access to natural 
resources. The prospects for continued stability in Guatemala are very good. Still, land tenure 
remains a challenge issue in Guatemala. Several surveys report that indigenous peoples continue 
to perceive that they are excluded from access to basic services, public health and education as 
well as land. Recent United Nations reports indicate efforts are needed to ensure that indigenous 
peoples are informed, consulted and properly included in the development process. The social 
inclusion and participation of indigenous peoples in the economic and political development 
process will contribute to political stability and increase the odds of continued transformation of 
the economy and society.  

3. 
Social and Political Organization. Activities to promote the inclusion of indigenous 
peoples can follow a systematic process of consultation and participation as the Guatemalan 
indigenous peoples are well organized at community and at national level. As a result of the 
Peace Accords their organizations created a third level political organization (national-umbrella). 
The Guatemala National Revolutionary Unit (URNG), formerly an umbrella organization of 
guerilla groups, evolved into a conventional political party by 1998. The indigenous peoples are 
also represented by the National Assembly of Representatives of the Mayan People and the 
National Council of Mayan Peoples. In 2004, attempting to present a unified front to the 
Guatemala Government, the National Assembly entered into dialogue with the National Council 
of Mayan Peoples. Labor and land rights are represented by the National Federation of Peasant 
Organizations (CNOC) and the Equality Committee on Indigenous People's Land Rights. A 
number of small NGOs, most notably the Mutual Support Group (GAM) and Families of 
Guatemalan Disappeared (FAMDEGUA), have also emerged to lobby for the prosecution of 
human rights abuses and to locate persons dead and missing since the civil war. In 2004, the 
Guatemalan Association of Mayan Lawyers was created to help select judges and defend the 
rights of indigenous peoples.  

75 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 
International support.  The UN peacekeeping mission to Guatemala (MINGUA) has 
made a great contribution providing overseeing to the process of implementing the Peace 
Accords, facilitating the dialogue between the URNG and the Government.  The World Bank 
and other organizations such as Latin American Human Rights Association, the Commission for 
the Defense of Human Rights in Central America (CODEHUCA), the International Indian 
Treaty Council and Amnesty International have supported indigenous peoples and their 
organizations in land administration, education and in constitutional reform and judicial access. 
However, despite the achievements this agenda is still very challenging and it needs continuo 
and sustained strategic support.

Annex 13. Executive Summary of IDB Strategy for Guatemala 

Country Context 

In recent years, Guatemala has experienced moderate economic growth, however with stagnation 
in GDP per capita.  At the same time, poverty has increased and large disparities between the 
rural and the urban areas remain. These disparities are driven mainly by the existing gaps in 
access to i) health services and education, ii) social and productive infrastructure and iii) income 
generation opportunities. In addition, there are three constraints to development at a country 
level: the institutional framework, the fiscal framework and the ethnic and gender inequity.  

The IDB in 
Guatemala 

The IDB Strategy 
2012-2016 

The IDB is the main source of external financing in Guatemala and one of the main sources of 
technical assistance. The IDB’s support has focused on the following i) Fiscal and Municipal 
Management (20%), ii) Social Protection (17.7%), iii) Capital Markets and Financial Institutions 
(11.6%) and iv) Transport (10. 3%). The current portfolio comprises 18 loans for a total available 
amount of US$562.6 million, 24 operations of the Multilateral Investment Fund worth US$8.8 
million and 38 technical cooperation interventions worth US$8.9 million. The loan portfolio with 
sovereign guarantee focuses on the following sectors: Education (23.5% of the total available 
amount), Environment and Natural Disasters (19.9%), Health (14%), Water and Sanitation 
(13.3%), Energy (9.6%) and Commerce (9.3%). 

The IDB strategy 2012-2016 for Guatemala (EBGU) aims to improve the living conditions of the 
Guatemalan population, specifically those in the rural areas. The main areas for intervention of 
the EBGU will be: Social Protection, Citizen Security and Violence Prevention, Fiscal and 
Municipal Management, and Rural Development (focusing on health, productive development 
and transportation). The rural development issues will be addressed under a territorial - 
multisectoral approach. Additionally, the IDB will be working on cross-cutting topics such as: 
environment, climate change and natural disasters, and indigenous population and gender. 
Moreover, the EBGU will promote regional integration, especially in the transport and energy 
sectors. Social protection, citizen security and violence prevention (i.e Barrios Seguros), fiscal 
and municipal management, productive development and transport will be areas of close 
collaboration with the World Bank.

Strategy 
Implementation 

Risks 

The IDB plans to implement their country strategy under an integrated, multisectoral, 
decentralized approach and with a community-based emphasis, addressing Guatemala´s needs 
through a combination of instruments and with a particular focus on proper project scale. In 
parallel, the Bank plans to continue strengthening the design, implementation and monitoring of 
programs and to concentrate loan approvals in the first years of the EBGU. The EBGU has been 
elaborated closely with the World Bank and this collaboration will continue in the 
implementation phase. 
The principal risks that the EBGU faces are the potential delays concerning parliamentary 
ratification of operations and the slow rhythm of execution in investment projects, all of which 
might restrict the impact of IDB´s intervention. Various activities are planned to mitigate these 
risks, including i) simplifying the design of operations (i.e. scale, execution mode and 
identification of best execution units), ii) emphasize synchronization of interventions with the 
Government’s planning and national budget cycle, and iii) engage with the Government in 
strengthening the technical capacity of the execution units.
