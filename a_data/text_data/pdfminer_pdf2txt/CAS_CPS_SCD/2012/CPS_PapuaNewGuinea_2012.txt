EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an ethnically and socially diverse young nation of seven million 
people speaking over 840 languages.  PNG is rich in natural resources, but is subject to extreme 
weather events and natural disasters.  The economy is dominated by agriculture and the 
oil/minerals sectors.  

PNG has enjoyed markedly improved economic fortunes since the mid-2000s. The global 
commodity price boom and stronger macroeconomic management helped the country avoid a 
repeat of the declining real incomes and macroeconomic volatility of the last 10 years. Revenues 
from new oil/gas/mining projects are expected to begin flowing late this decade, and new 
investments in the country’s productive capacity will be a central driver of growth, jobs, and 
opportunities for poverty reduction. However, the deteriorating global outlook led to marked 
reversals in the prices of PNG’s exports in mid-2012, and government revenues are expected to 
stagnate in the near term. These economic pressures will occur against a background of a 
population growing at 2¾ percent each year, and citizens expecting government to distribute 
benefits from PNG’s recent prosperity. 

PNG is poised on the brink of a challenging period of both opportunity and risk. Efforts to build 
prosperity, and to reduce inequality and poverty, are severely constrained by challenges in 
governance, fragile institutions, and by crime and violence. An empirical analysis of the 
socioeconomic costs of crime and violence is currently being undertaken to better inform potential 
interventions that would aim to reduce costs to business and provide safe access to markets and 
services for women as well as men. Similarly, reforming and strengthening public financial 
management systems including public procurement will be key to addressing the persistence of 
both poor governance and poor service delivery in the country. 

The government’s development vision is “to reform and align institutions and systems to make 
Papua New Guinea become a smart, wise, fair, healthy and happy society” through effective 
service delivery, human resource development, wealth creation and sustainable development of 
the existing vast natural resources. Like many minerals-rich developing countries, PNG struggles 
to transform increasing national revenues and per capita Gross Domestic Product into measurable 
improvements in household incomes and livelihoods or individual well-being, and newly available 
data show that the poverty headcount has not changed significantly over the last 15 years, in spite 
of growing minerals revenues.  

As PNG’s population continues to grow, the “youth bulge” becomes more pronounced, putting 
continued pressure on public service delivery, and exacerbating the challenge of  youth 
unemployment. An important part of the World Bank Group (WBG) commitment comes in the 
form of International Development Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (IBRD) resources to improve the quality of productive sector and infrastructure 
investments and the effectiveness of public service delivery, and in the form of International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) capital to accelerate diversification and job creation. WBG resources 
in PNG are increasingly focused through our core portfolio on investments in sectors where global 
experience demonstrates strong linkages with reducing poverty and increasing prosperity, such as 
road access, agriculture, and renewable energy; in some of our ‘core areas’ we lead the sector, and 
in some we complement much larger donors. In addition, WBG plays a niche role in social sectors 
including education, health, and social protection, through carefully defined analytical work that 
catalyzes innovation and leverages program financing from larger partners and Government.  
Much of this niche work is financed ‘trilaterally’ with a larger donor and Government. 

i 

 
Gender issues will be “front and center” throughout the WBG program.  Gender inequality is a 
significant development challenge in PNG; indeed, the government’s Medium-Term Development 
Plan recognizes gender inequality, including gender-based violence, as a “threat to future 
development”. Women have substantially poorer access to health care services, and lower levels 
of education and literacy pose barriers to their equal participation in economic activity and 
political life. Most women lack access to credit, banking and markets. Gender-based violence is 
reportedly very high, and women’s access to justice and legal protection is low. This strategy 
benefitted from the recent multi-stakeholder Country Gender Assessment, facilitated by the Bank, 
and data and analyses supported by many partners and PNG government agencies. 

The first pillar of WBG’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) in PNG will focus on providing 
increased access to inclusive physical and financial infrastructure in ways that benefit women and 
girls as well as men and boys. The second pillar will contribute to improvements in the quality of 
life and the livelihoods of women and girls as well as men and boys. The third pillar will sustain 
support to the prudent and increasingly inclusive management of revenues and benefit streams at 
national and community levels. The core program includes IDA/IBRD investments in agriculture, 
transport infrastructure, telecommunications, with energy chosen as a selectively targeted “growth 
sector”, and IFC investments in private sector and financial sector development. The program will 
include a selective program of analytical and capacity-building activities in economic policy 
reform and extractives sector governance, and a niche role in health, education, and social 
protection, using WBG global expertise to support policy dialogue and influence key partners. 

In implementing the expanded portfolio and building on these investments with future 
interventions, WBG will leverage the lessons learned during the concurrent Bank re-engagement 
and IFC expansion from 2007-2011, offering an integrated WBG approach to both strategy and 
program with joined-up processes, joint analytics, and carefully selected joint operations. 
Learning from the lack of progress on institutional governance and anticorruption work in the 
previous Country Assistance Strategy, the WBG will proactively seek to tap into the increased 
momentum for public finance and procurement reform. Both inside projects, and through small 
pilot efforts, the WBG will capitalize on the enabling environment provided by a vibrant media 
and increased use of technology for social accountability to provide support to the stronger and 
more cohesive multi-stakeholder coalition demanding reform. 

PNG’s strong economic performance and prudent macro-fiscal management over the last decade 
has brought the country back into actual “Blend” status. After nine years of relying only on IDA 
financing, an IBRD creditworthiness assessment confirmed the availability of additional resources 
beyond the current IBRD portfolio. IDA resources will focus on core investments in agriculture, 
transport infrastructure, while IBRD resources will include catalytic financing for high-return 
inclusive infrastructure such as renewable energy, including through guarantees to leverage co-
financing from other sources. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency has been a successful 
partner in PNG in the past, and can provide support and incentives for foreign investors. 

While the approach to risk in this CPS reflects a more nuanced and granular understanding of 
risks that developed through the intensive process of re-engaging and rebuilding the portfolio, 
risks to the effective implementation of the expanded portfolio, and to the proposed deepening of 
WBG engagement in PNG, are high. The CPS aims to mitigate the range of risks – reputational, 
fiduciary, operational – more systematically by proactively evaluating risks throughout the CPS 
period, building on successful interventions and investments, and identifying institutional 
champions.

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  

I. 
1. 
Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an ethnically and socially diverse young nation of seven 
million people, with over 840 languages and a rich endowment of natural resources, poised on 
the brink of a challenging period of opportunity and risk. PNG is rich in natural resources, 
including forests, fisheries, oil/minerals and land, but is subject to extreme weather events and natural 
disasters. The economy is dominated by a labor-intensive agricultural sector and a capital-intensive 
oil and minerals sector. The formal sector consists of enclave extractive industries, cash crop 
production, a small import-substituting manufacturing sector, and a growing services and retail sector, 
while the informal sector is largely subsistence agriculture and petty trade.  

2. 
PNG’s economy is dualistic along several dimensions: there is a sharp rural-urban 
divide, the extractives economy dominates the small non-minerals formal sector, and the 
contribution and productivity of women is sharply constrained compared to men. PNG  allocates 
similar shares of resources to public service delivery as other countries near its income level, 
measured (for example) by public spending on education in 2008/9 as percent of total government 
expenditure, but these are less effectively transformed into quality outcomes, measured (for example) 
by the literacy rate of youths aged 15-24 during the same period.   

3. 
Efforts to build prosperity, and to reduce inequality and poverty, are severely 
constrained by challenges in governance and by crime and violence. PNG faces the challenge of 
not only maintaining a stable macro-fiscal stance through the next four years, but also improving 
governance and leveraging better service delivery outcomes from constant (rather than growing) 
budgets. National authorities, communities, businesses and civil society seek to cooperatively address 
the challenges posed by crime and violence and fragile, low-capacity public institutions undermined 
by corruption, so that PNG will have a platform for more inclusive and sustainable improvements in 
livelihoods and household well-being, thus reducing inequality and increasing prosperity. 

4. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) is building upon the recently expanded portfolio of 
Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) investments to scale up financial and 
analytical support to PNG as the country moves towards middle-income status through an 
important period of challenge, change and growth. For the first time since 2002, the Bank will be 
providing International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans to PNG’s 
government to complement the continuation of International Development Association (IDA) 
concessional credits, in recognition of the Government of Papua New Guinea (GoPNG’s) continuing 
prudent management of debt and macro-fiscal policy leading to a the country’s gross public debt 
being reduced by 66% between 2002 and 2012.  IDA and IBRD assistance will be programmed in 
support of the government’s efforts to improve the quality of investments and the efficiency and 
effectiveness of public service delivery.   

5. 
Reflecting a strengthened relationship with national authorities, civil society and the 
private sector, as well as with development partners beyond traditional “donors”, a diverse 
range of WBG resources and competences will be deployed through an intensively integrated 
Bank-IFC joint approach. The combined resources of the WBG available for PNG – even after the 
significant expansion of the last three years which saw a doubling of the total WBG portfolio – are a 
small fraction of total Overseas Development Assistance available to the national authorities.  
Strategically selective choices will be essential.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

II. 
6. 
PNG has enjoyed markedly improved economic fortunes since the mid-2000s. The global 
commodity price boom and stronger macroeconomic management helped the country avoid a 
repeat of the declining real incomes and macroeconomic volatility of the preceding 10 years. The 
global downturn of 2009 had only a mild impact on PNG’s economy, which expanded by 5.5 percent, 
outperforming its regional peers and most other developing economies. This follows several years of 
six to seven percent annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. While sharply higher global 
commodity prices have strongly supported incomes (average export prices doubled between 2005 and 
2008, and were still about fifty percent higher in mid 2012), the non-minerals sector has led this 
resurgence, benefiting from private investment in future minerals production capacity as well as in the 
newly liberalized telecommunications and aviation sectors, for example. Even after several years’ of 
broader growth, PNG’s economy remains dominated by two sectors: (i) the agricultural sector, which 
engages most of the labor force; and (ii) minerals and energy extraction, which earns the largest share 
of export receipts.  

7. 
Stronger fiscal management has done much to transform windfall gains from higher 
commodity prices into sustained macroeconomic growth. The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2006 
channeled “additional” government mineral receipts associated with the rise in global commodity 
prices into various onshore trust funds, and into paying down more expensive external loans and 
unfunded public employee superannuation liabilities. By 2012 gross public debt neared 25 percent of 
GDP, down from about 70 percent in 2002. The improvement in official public debts may overstate 
the strength of the government’s balance sheet, as it still holds contingent and other liabilities 
estimated at an additional 20 percent of GDP.  

8. 
With growth in demand outpacing that of productive capacity, inflationary pressures 
built and became increasingly domestically-focused. PNG’s consumers were buffeted by the global 
energy and food price rises of 2007 and 2008, which lifted year-on-year urban average inflation above 
13 percent and urban food price inflation to above 20 percent. The subsequent retreat in global prices 
slowed local price growth, but only to around five percent year on year. As domestic demand 
pressures built through 2011, reported inflation approached 10 percent, with the actual rate likely to 
be considerably higher given measurement and coverage flaws with the official Consumer Price Index 
(CPI). The extension of the government’s tuition-fee-free education subsidy and the strength in the 
Papua New Guinea Kina (PGK) subtracted from inflation through the first part of 2012.  

9. 
PNG’s financial sector has been insulated from the instability in global finance since 
2007 and is characterized by conservative lending practices. Non-Performing Loan (NPL) levels 
have been low and stable, and capital reserves high. Credit growth has been modest relative to 
nominal GDP growth. The country experienced a structural excess of liquidity in the banking system, 
especially as foreign exchange reserves accumulated quickly in 2010 and 2011, and this reduces Bank 
of Papua New Guinea (BPNG’s) ability to conduct monetary policy. Nonetheless, the central bank 
tightened the stance of monetary policy through 2011 and early 2012 as inflationary pressures built, 
raising the overnight interest rate and banks’ official reserve requirements, and allowing an 
historically unprecedented 27 percent appreciation in the United States (US) Dollar US$/PGK 
exchange rate (between mid 2010 and mid 2012). However market interest rates have been stable or 
fallen, limiting the impact on borrowing costs. 

2 

 
 
10. 
Just as importantly, many Papua New Guineans have been finding new jobs, which are 
developing their skills and deepening their engagement with the cash economy. Formal 
employment has grown by an annual average near six percent in the five years to 2012 according to 
BPNG’s survey, a significant improvement from earlier trends. In 2014 and 2015, the start of gas 
production will raise the level of measured GDP by as much as one-quarter. But the shift from 
construction to full operation will also cut the workforce of the PNG-LNG project to around 800, an 
order of magnitude smaller than during construction. Instead, Papua New Guineans will need to look 
to the pipeline of new projects, and the emerging group of PNG-owned and - managed enterprises, for 
employment opportunities. Various major long-term infrastructure investments are being discussed, 
including a possible multi-billion dollar investment in the Highlands Highway, and development of 
PNG’s large renewable energy potential. Efforts are also being made to make new investments more 
attractive by improving the efficiency with which business and government operate. PNG improved 
its ranking in the 2012 Doing Business survey by four positions to 101 out of 183 economies, which 
reflects various incremental reforms.  

Economic Prospects, Scenarios, and Risks  
11. 
PNG’s economic outlook remains solid, with a stream of new investments in the 
country’s productive capacity as a central driver of growth, jobs, and opportunities for poverty 
reduction, amid evidence of increasing diversification in the non-minerals sectors. PNG’s non-
mineral economy is likely to moderate through to 2015 from the very strong growth rates of recent 
years (from 8.4 percent average annual growth in the five years to 2011 to annual growth around five 
percent), as construction of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant winds down, and the retreat in 
cash crop and other commodity prices combines with the stronger PGK to cut real incomes. 
Aggregate GDP will expand by approximately 25 percent in late 2014 and 2015 as the LNG project 
moves to full production. Supply bottlenecks are likely to remain a significant issue into mid-2013 
months, but less so than in the previous period, as new capacity becomes available.  

12. 
In considering PNG’s longer-term economic prospects, it is worthwhile to reflect on the 
different experiences of PNG during resource booms, with the goal of ensuring that this time 
PNG is able to sustain strong growth into the long-term and achieve its development objectives 
of middle-income status. Over the past several years, GoPNG has taken a more prudent approach to 
managing public finances and, at least up to up to 2010, has allowed the exchange rate to move with 
market pressures; the result has been less volatile growth. (Especially since 2010, BPNG has been 
acting as a counterparty to large foreign exchange transactions to reduce volatility in the relatively 
thin exchange rate market, although it has also been leaning against the Kina’s appreciation, by 
allowing its foreign exchange reserves to rise from US$1.9 billion in March 2009 to peak 
US$4.3 billion in January 2012.)  Maintaining prudent policy will be essential to ensuring that recent 
gains in national income are sustained and deepened in coming years. 

13. 
However, significant concerns remain around both external and domestic developments; 
the deteriorating and more uncertain global outlook led to marked reversals in the prices of 
PNG’s exports in mid 2012, and declines may be substantial. (Table 1 presents the implications of 
potential down-side scenarios, with details in Attachment C.) This decline in local incomes from 
exports is coinciding with ongoing large inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the central 
bank’s concern over already-high inflationary pressures, both of which reduce the scope for an 
offsetting depreciation of the PGK exchange rate.

14. 
The scenario that shows slower revenue growth would make even the government’s 
current prudent spending projections unsustainable without a marked improvement in revenue 
collection. Sharper declines in global commodity prices, tightening in global financing conditions, 
and PNG’s costs remaining relatively high in US$ terms would make it less likely for potential 
resource projects to reach final investment approval, with flow-on implications for long-term fiscal 
revenues and shorter-term demand in the non-mineral sector. Meanwhile supply constraints, 
particularly for skilled labor and where land is an important input, are likely to keep inflationary 
pressures high. Alternatively, domestic social and institutional disruption may weaken the domestic 
investment climate. While this scenario is likely to see less compression in government revenues, at 
least in the shorter-term, it would slow growth in the non-resource economy and in formal 
employment, potentially generating further social pressures. 

15. 
Before the revenues from the LNG plant and the potential additional projects start 
flowing, late this decade, government revenues are expected to stagnate, pressuring spending 
and fiscal space. Even if spending over the coming years only keeps pace with inflation (i.e. is 
constant in real terms, growing by about half the rate between 2008 and 2012), the budget deficit is 
likely to average 2.0 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2015. If real spending per capita is held 
constant at 2012 levels, after allowing for very modest growth in 2013 to fund election commitments, 
the budget deficit is projected to average at least 3.0 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2015. (Figure 
1). These revenue pressures will occur against a background of rising costs of skilled employees and 
of materials, a population growing by 2¾ percent each year, and the community expecting a new 
government to distribute the benefits of PNG’s recent prosperity.

Supporting Private Sector Dynamism and Structural Transformation 
16. 
The investment boom funded by FDI has raised output, including in sectors unrelated to 
natural resources (such as telecommunications and services), amid signs of landowner 
companies capitalized by individual extractive projects maturing into larger, commercially-

5 

 
 
managed and sustainable businesses. This is the third commodity boom since World War II, and is 
characterized by some similarities to previous cycles, including concern about food security and 
nonrenewable resource depletion, but also by important differences: this boom is more broadly-based 
across energy, metals, and agricultural exports, it is lasting longer, and it is being managed more 
prudently and strategically.

17. 
Targeted, effective regulatory reform and the opening up of markets to FDI has 
generated visible benefits, and the IFC estimates there is further scope for new entrants in key 
sectors including in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and renewable energy. 
PNG currently has one of the lowest rates of access to electricity in the world, but with a combination 
of policy reform, systematic planning from GoPNG and partners, and new investment, PNG can 
leverage on and off-grid solutions that will reduce burdens on the urban and rural poor and help 
support small businesses. Favorable conditions exist in other sectors (including most infrastructure 
and key social services) for greater private sector investment tied to increased service delivery and 
quality. Government has indicated a desire to continue State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) reform and 
leverage more diversified private sector investment.  

18. 

PNG is fortunate to have a robust, well-regulated and rapidly developing financial 
services sector, providing a base for aggressive efforts to expand financial inclusion to the rural 
and urban poor. Key IFC investments and technical assistance to the retail and commercial Bank of 
South Pacific (BSP) and microfinance provider PNG Microfinance Ltd. has been fundamental in 
increasing access to financial services, although much more will be needed to reach the estimated 85 
percent of 
the population currently without access. Linking 
financial 
services with 
telecommunications allows payment systems to facilitate domestic remittances that reduce the risk of 
carrying funds associated with crime, fraud and violence, decrease the amount of time spent collecting 
and sending money in a country with poor transport links, and cut costs and increase speed of 
payments.  Innovations are underway and showing impact, with attention now turning to focus on 
equity and consumer protection.  
A continued favorable environment for FDI in both minerals and non-minerals sectors 
can contribute more significantly than in the past to job creation as the economy diversifies, 
although PNG will still remain a largely rural, informal economy where access to land for food 
production for home consumption provides a buffer against extreme poverty. The challenge is to 
balance jobs growth with “good jobs” (i.e. expanding the opportunities for all) including through 

19. 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
access to formal sector jobs for women and youth newly entering the labor force, and through 
changing both private sector choices (e.g. up-skilling of PNG employees and explicit transition plans 
that reduce the reliance on expatriate staff) and public sector policies. Small businesses’ formalization 
and growth is also impeded by the high compliance costs and limited understanding of the current tax 
system, a challenge being addressed through various nascent reforms, ranging from better audit 
approaches for small businesses to reform of tax rates applied to Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs). 
Fighting Poverty and Transforming National Wealth into Household and Individual Wellbeing  
20. 
Like many minerals-rich developing countries, PNG struggles to transform economic 
growth and increasing national revenues into widespread improvements in household incomes 
and livelihoods or individual well-being.  PNG’s growth surge in the early 1990’s coincided with 
important gains in human development, but these stagnated over the following decade. Maternal 
mortality rates fell from 340 to 300 per 100,000 live births, and the primary school enrollment rate 
rose from 65 percent to 72 percent, with greater gains for female enrollment (fewer data are available 
for recent years). But the early 1990s growth episode was partially reversed over the following 
decade. Real GDP per capita fell almost one-quarter, when public finances were often on a weak 
footing, impacting on delivery of services and maintenance of PNG’s public infrastructure. External 
imbalances led to the PKG being floated at sharply lower exchange rates in 1994, causing a sharp rise 
in consumer prices. 

21. 
Preliminary findings from the 2009-2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey 
(HIES), summarized in Box 1, confirm quantitatively what many PNG stakeholders have noted:  
the benefits of faster growth and higher revenues have not translated into benefits for wide 
sections of the population. The proportion of the PNG population who live in households where the 
real value of consumption per adult equivalent is below the poverty line is 39.9 percent.  

Box 1:  The Paradox of Wealth without Development - Preliminary HIES Findings on Poverty  

In spite of rich endowments of natural resources, and increasingly effective efforts to prudently manage the 
incoming revenues generated by their export, PNG’s development outcomes remain mixed. Traditional coping 
mechanisms, including rural household access to land for home food production and strong support through 
reciprocal exchange in wantok networks, ensure low risk of “food poverty”.  However, the 2009-2010 HIES 
confirms that many households in PNG suffer a lack of access to basic services (health care, education, and clean 
water), a lack of opportunity to participate fully in an increasingly monetized society, and a resultant lack of 
adequate cash to meet basic household needs and customary household obligations. The challenge is most acute in 
urban areas such as National Capital District (where the two traditional coping mechanisms are less accessible).  
Overall, two-thirds of the struggling households in PNG are concentrated in the Highlands and rural Momase.  
In PNG, where a large share of household consumption is self-produced, cash incomes are used for essential non-
food items (school fees, kerosene, and garden tools), to improve diet quality by allowing consumption of purchased 
protein and energy-dense staples, and to provide insurance for periods of agricultural stress.  However, the HIES 
shows us that all modalities of earning cash are not ‘equal’ in terms of support to households:  when data are 
analyzed by removing household heads with no economic activity, those working for cash as wage or salary earners 
or in formal businesses, and those working on own-account (either as semi-subsistence agriculturalists or making or 
selling items for sale in informal businesses), it emerges that the big economic divide in PNG is between those 
households with access to formal sector incomes and those without. 
PNG is not on-track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MGD’s) (details are in Annex 2 of Attachment I). 
The emerging focus of the post-MDG Sustainable Development Goals will support an increased focus on equity and 
sustainability, both of which are critical for PNG, but it remains true that the core goals of 2015 will not be met. 

7 

 
22. 
Poverty rates appear to have changed very little over the last 16 years. Comparing the 
2009-2010 HIES with the results of the last national survey, in 1996, and mindful of differences in 
data collection, it is apparent that for all PNG, and for each region except the national capital of Port 
Moresby, the situation is stagnant.  In the capital, the headcount does appear to have risen, from 31 
percent in 1996 to 43 percent in 2009/10 but the change is only on the borderline of conventional 
statistical significance. The HIES does not show a systematically higher incidence of poverty amongst 
female-headed households, but there is a clear statistical relationship between the incidence of poverty 
and the education of household heads – even though just one-quarter of the population live in 
households headed by an unschooled person, they comprise between 35-43 percent of the poor. 
Similarly, the poverty rate for people living in households where the head is (self-reportedly) illiterate 
is 50 percent, compared with just 33 percent for people whose household head is literate. As Box 1 
shows, this failure to transform wealth into wellbeing is stubbornly unaffected even by the recent 
better-managed revenue boom in PNG. 

23. 
As PNG’s population continues to grow, the ‘youth bulge’ becomes more pronounced as 
lagging health services fail to deliver a longer, healthier lifespan. This will put continued pressure 
on public service delivery, and will exacerbate the gap between educational outcomes and skills 
demanded in the market, leaving an increasing number of young men and women without livelihoods 
and jobs.  An increased focus on family planning, and better modeling of population growth in service 
delivery planning, will be important.

Confronting the Constraints of Crime and Violence, Institutional Fragility, and Corruption 
24. 
Reports in national and international media, and anecdotal evidence from communities 
and business, indicate that the prevalence of crime and violence is high in PNG, and presents an 
important obstacle to long-term development.  At the same time, PNG scholars and stakeholders 
acknowledge that conflict is part and parcel of social life, and that managed conflict has been central 
to the maintenance of social cohesion and social capital within and among PNG communities. While 
traditional systems of managing disputes historically were effective in maintaining social order, the 
course of economic and social evolution in PNG has generated disputes that are less amenable to 
management by traditional means.   

8 

 
 
25. 
The widespread prevalence of high levels of crime and violence have been attributed to a 
wide range of explanations, but an empirical analysis of the socioeconomic costs of crime and 
violence is only now being undertaken. New internal and external stresses are also rendering 
traditional systems of conflict management incapable of controlling the steady increase in violence 
and crime which harms individuals and businesses, reduces the scope of community activity, hampers 
access to markets and services, and prevents more effective nation-building.  

26. 
The violent conflict in PNG’s eastern-most island province of Bougainville during the 
period 1988 to 1997 illustrates the intersection of many of the dynamics identified in Box 2. The 
conflict was complex, with drivers that included a perceived lack of transparency in the agreements 
made between the national government and the operator of the massive copper mine that dominated 
the economy. Dissatisfaction with benefit-sharing agreements between the large copper mine and 
local communities included the belief that the benefits of the mine were going disproportionately to 
mainland PNG, that migrants were benefiting from the mine more than landowners, and that 
communities in other parts of the island were excluded from benefits.  

Box 2:   Drivers of Resilience or Fragility: Socio-Political Dynamics in PNG  

The challenge posed by crime and violence, and by institutional fragility, can be understood as the “cost” to PNG’s 
society and economy of not successfully addressing the mis-match between exposure to internal and external 
stresses and the social capacity to manage these stresses.  Ongoing analytical work on crime and violence in PNG 
point to six key areas where the drivers of fragility are most clearly manifested: 
  -  PNG is socially fragmented with little common identity or vision.  
  - Extreme power imbalances between men and women in PNG – often enforced with violence – threaten social 
cohesion and the overall economic progress of the country. 
  - Competition for land is increasing with economic shifts, creating divisions among clans, within clans, and within 
families that can easily lead to violence. 
  -  Public sector positions are captured by narrow interests along family, clan and ethnic lines.  
  -  Intergenerational conflict is growing, as the gap between the values of older and younger generations widens. 
  - PNG’s institutions – both customary and formal – are struggling to effectively manage the stresses that have 
arisen from social and economic changes. 
More details on the dynamics of socio-political and institutional fragility in PNG are available in Attachment D. 

27. 
Of concern alongside the damaging and distorting effects of crime and violence are the 
persistent challenges of corruption and the fragility of key institutions. The volatile economic 
history of the young nation has taken its toll on the quality of public and civic institutions, with gains 
made immediately after Independence, but later giving way during the periods of fiscal crisis and 
political instability to eroding capacity and morale in some parts of the public sector and a lack of 
confidence and trust between citizens and the state. Concerns about corruption and poor governance 
persist, and political interference with civil servants and bureaucracies is reportedly high. Measures 
from perception surveys such as Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index show PNG 
ranking very low (154 out of 183 countries), with persistent evidence that citizens remain mistrustful 
of their government (65% of respondents in a 2010 survey found the government's efforts to fight 
corruption to be ineffective).  The creation of a national multi-agency Task Force Sweep in 2011 that 
links together bodies with powers of reporting, investigation, and prosecution has generated attention 
and resulted in high-profile cases being launched, but a sustained effort is needed for many years. 

9 

 
 
28. 
Reforming and strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) systems, including 
public procurement, is key to addressing the persistence of both poor governance and poor 
service delivery in the country. Announcements by the new government in 2012 included a 
willingness to reactivate the stalled reform agenda, but a carefully coordinated program of technical 
support and sustained government appetite for reforms will be required to generate real change. 

29. 
PNG provides a moderate level of transparency and access to information on key 
government resource management processes such as budget formulation and budget outcomes, 
but there is little transparency on the complex mechanics of budget execution, and little rigor on 
routine monitoring of inputs and outputs of key government programs. With the growing 
evidence of an increase in demand for good governance and a range of stakeholders demanding more 
transparent processes, there is emerging interest in leveraging ICT for accountability. Several GoPNG 
agencies are partnering to use mobile connectivity to monitor delivery of education and health while 
pilots are also being considered to empower communities and households to hold service providers 
accountable for key elements of social service delivery (presence of teachers, physical state of repair 
of aid posts). 

Government of Papua New Guinea’s Development Strategy 
30. 
GoPNG’s development vision is “to reform and align institutions and systems to make 
PNG become a smart, wise, fair, healthy and happy society” through effective service delivery, 
human resource development, wealth creation and sustainable development of natural resources. The 
government’s Vision 2050, the PNG Development Strategic Plan 2010-2030 (DSP), and the Medium 
Term Development Plan 2011-2015 (MTDP) form the base of the WBG strategy. The theme running 
through the MTDP is “building foundations for prosperity”. The MTDP prioritizes four key policy 
objectives: (i) sustain prudent fiscal and macro management; (ii) nurture development of 
entrepreneurial culture and vibrant business environment; (iii) reverse the regressive conditions of 
human development; and (iv) support the seven identified MTDP “key enablers”, including transport 
infrastructure, key utilities (energy and communications), primary and secondary education, higher 
and technical education, health, unlocking land for development, and law and order.  

31. 
In September 2012 the newly elected government announced the “Alotau Accord 
Platform for Action”, and signaled their intention to add an eighth MTDP enabler focusing on 
“investing in a sustainable economy” with investments in renewable energy. In their detailed 
statement they announced the intention to revisit the MTDP to make it more selective, fully costed, 
and aligned to the annual budget cycle. The government also reinforced the desire for partners to be 
complementary in programming and work deeply in existing areas where programs show results. 

32. 
The DSP sets an ambitious goal on gender equality; all stakeholders acknowledged the 
significant barriers currently in place.  The country’s own development strategies and plans 
emphasize that every person, irrespective of gender, needs the opportunity to reach their potential – 
because in this way, the whole country will benefit – and yet gender disparity is widespread, from 
education, employment, and political representation to mortality and cultural norms.  Box 3 outlines 
some key priorities identified in the 2011 multi-stakeholder PNG Country Gender Assessment 
(CGA). 

10 

 
 
 
Box 3:   Results of the 2011-12 PNG CGA 

In a highly participatory and consultative process involving a wide range of stakeholders representing some four 
dozen institutions and agencies, the 2011-12 PNG CGA provided a snapshot of the gender dimensions of the 
nation’s development challenges, focusing on access to resources (through education, health, employment, and 
entrepreneurship), access to rights (through legal and social empowerment, and freedom from violence) and access 
to voice (through participation in decision-making).  Of the more than 40 “potential actions” identified by the CGA 
multi-stakeholder team, the following were those where quick action was judged to be most important for PNG: 
− Support more extensive training and enabling support for Village Court Magistrates, many of whom are now 
women, on Gender Based Violence (GBV) and intimate partner violence, and link this to mediation  
− Build on the electoral success of three women MPs in 2012 to explore legal provisions for mandatory support 
for women in political parties’ slates of candidates, and to expand advocacy efforts that support women in office 
− Provide high-visibility support to collection and use nationally-representative data on gender-based violence  
− Solicit donor support for numeracy and financial literacy, and prioritize IFC support to “Finance Alliance for 
Sustainable Trade” (FAST) program that provides basic financial literacy to women farmers 
− Use the reviews of oil/gas/mining laws and policies to provide for mandatory participation by women in 
negotiations; disseminate guidance on dedicated benefits streams based on the Ok Tedi experience. 
− Consider either a Public Services Department circular or an amendment of the relevant Act such that all lists of 
candidates Ministers submit to the Public Services Commission should include at least one female candidate 
− Mobilize senior leaders to ensure that maternal and child health services are officially exempt from fees, and 
that survivors of domestic violence are officially exempt from higher fees charged on “tribal violence” injuries 

Donor Engagement    
33. 
PNG, like many Pacific countries, receives generous international development 
assistance but the government is actively seeking to transition to “more trade than aid”.  Net 
flows to PNG in recent years have reached slightly over US$910m per annum, close to 10 percent of 
GDP or $130 per capita. (See Attachment H for Donor Mapping.) The government’s capacity to 
coordinate development partners is evolving, with technical support from partners, but a more 
strategic focus on monitoring and reporting is needed to leverage impact.   
34. WBG support is complementary to the sizeable resources provided by key partners. 
Australia is Papua New Guinea’s largest partner, providing annual assistance close to A$500m 
focused on primary health, education, transport infrastructure, and law and justice, with a whole-of-
government program supporting public financial management and improved national statistics. The 
Asian Development Bank 
(ADB) program 
focuses on 
infrastructure 
(transport, power, 
water/sanitation), state enterprise reform, trade and PFM, microfinance, and health. 
35. WBG is committed to global and regional initiatives on aid effectiveness and 
harmonization, including those localized in the PNG government’s 2008 Kavieng Declaration, 
and will work closely with clients and partners to improve development effectiveness.  While 
WBG has scaled up, the value of our engagement is defined by the extent to which the WBG can 
“bundle” its expertise and financing, collaborate with other development partners to transfer global 
knowledge, build capacity in public and private sectors, and encourage changes to reverse the 
stagnant human development indicators.    

11 

 
III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT 
Deepening the World Bank Group Re-Engagement in Papua New Guinea 
36. WBG has dramatically scaled up its engagement in PNG, and is committed to continuing 
this support as part of a renewed longer-term commitment.  An important part of the WBG 
commitment comes in the form of IDA and IBRD assistance to improve the quality of investments 
and the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery, and in the form of IFC investment 
capital to accelerate diversification and job creation: this is our core role. Of growing importance, 
however, is the WBG role in catalyzing innovations and pilots for a “triple bottom line” approach to 
sustainability (incorporating economic, social, and environmental considerations), and in leveraging 
financing and influencing programming of a diverse range of partners:  this is our niche role.

rated the performance of the 2008-2011 program as moderately unsatisfactory. While the CAS-
CR notes that the 2008-2011 program was overly ambitious in relation to WBG’s budgetary and 
lending resources, the CAS period did develop a very satisfactory re-engagement which has built a 
solid base for achieving development impact. From an implementation perspective, the portfolio 
performance has been slowly improving. The disbursement ratio at the end of FY12 was 10 percent, 
below the regional average of 18 percent and slightly lower than the FY 2011 rate of 12 percent. This 
result stems mostly from the entry of five new projects with partners having little IDA experience. 
One problem project is being restructured, and two potential problem projects have additional 
supervision resources and implementation support.  

38. 
The CAS-CR identified the following key lessons with implications for the design and 
implementation of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS): 
• Be more modest in the selection of results, focusing on outcomes expected from projects either 
already active or having a high level of readiness for implementation.  
• Avoid loss of momentum by minimizing effectiveness conditions and advancing project readiness 
during final stages of appraisal and in the ‘waiting period’ before Board approval.  
• Sustain support to key sectors and institutions delivering visible services, to balance the largely 
‘invisible’ gains in policy dialogue, particularly when public expectations are high.  
• Use a creative approach to sector engagement, including a range of instruments that can be 
adjusted to adapt to the varying speeds of client engagement. To build stakeholder consensus, 

12 

 
 
smaller interventions such as study tours and workshops can maintain engagement until the timing 
is right to proceed with scaled up activity, especially in weaker partner institutions. 
• Quality consultation and documentation are key to safeguarding PNG’s complex social traditions 
and ethnic diversity. Translate summaries of key documents into Tok Pisin and other local 
languages that project-affected people may need, and disseminate.  Properly record consultation 
location, participation, topics discussed, complaints, and resolutions agreed.  
• Use communications as a strategic development dynamic, rather than for information 
dissemination or remediation. Engage routinely with stakeholders during project design and 
implementation, and once decisions are made on whether or not to make changes, actively 
communicate decisions to the groups consulted, and document that “feedback loop”.  
• Ensure that appropriate community representatives are involved in consultations, including local 
government and traditional leaders, and make special efforts to reach youth and women.  

39. 
In preparing this strategy, the WBG team engaged with a wide range of stakeholders 
through two separate rounds of consultations from late 2011 through mid-2012. Discussions with 
GoPNG policymakers, current implementing agencies, private sector, civil society (including faith-
based institutions and academia) and development partners offered views on how past experience 
should shape the WBG engagement, with strong messages:   
• Where the WBG is already significantly involved, or leading, identify key areas for change and 
mobilize broad stakeholder will from GoPNG champions and non-governmental groups. 
• Ensure a good fit with GoPNG goals, using the WBG’s global technical experience base to 
support the ones where WBG ‘additionality’ drives more inclusive and equitable change. 
• Benefit from newly-built implementation capacity by building on projects in existing sectors and 
agencies and ‘going deeper’ in the core portfolio. 
• Play a targeted ‘niche role’ through carefully defined highly leveraged analytical work in high-
profile sectors like health and education where other donors lead with large grant resources, to 
deploy WBG’s analytical advantage and global technical reach. 
• Encourage areas where Bank-IFC synergy can be demonstrated, such as agriculture, 
telecommunications, financial services, business enabling environment, and energy. 
Prioritizing Gender Equality as Smart Economics 
40. 
Gender issues will be “front and center” throughout the WBG program.  Gender 
inequality is a significant development challenge in PNG; indeed, the MTDP recognizes gender 
inequality, including GBV, as a “threat to future development”. Women have substantially poorer 
access to health care services, and lower levels of educational attainment and literacy pose barriers to 
their equal participation in economic activity and political life. Most women lack access to credit, 
banking and markets. GBV is reportedly very high, and women’s access to justice and legal 
protection is low. The DSP in Section 6.3 says “all citizens, irrespective of gender, will have equal 
opportunity to participate in and benefit from the development of the country”.   

41. 
To support the government goals in Vision 2050 and the DSP, and to help advance the 
specific strategies for gender equality in the MTDP, the WBG will focus on leveling the playing 
field between men and women. The WBG efforts will prioritize interventions that address 
development obstacles identified as significant barriers to women’s equitable economic participation, 
and seek out activities and project design elements that deliver a disproportionately positive impact on 
women and girls. The MTDP baseline and targets for gender are limited, and because there is 

13 

 
inadequate resourcing and experience in GoPNG agencies to effectively mainstream gender, the 
WBG will monitor results carefully, and will convene a Portfolio Gender Review mid-way through 
the CPS period, to feed into the CPS Progress Report. The IFC will emphasize economic 
empowerment of women by piloting an innovative focus on gender in commerce. 

Leveraging the World Bank Group Comparative Advantage to Benefit Papua New Guinea 

42. 
Our engagement in PNG reflects the government’s development priorities, consistent 
with the unifying themes of WBG global strategic directions, and will encompass:  

• A core portfolio of IDA/IBRD investments in agriculture, transport, telecommunications, and 
renewable energy, with significant Additional Financing for IDA, energy as the ‘growth sector’, 
and IFC investments in private sector and financial sector development; 
• A selective program of analytical and capacity-building activities as a core contribution in 
economic policy reform and extractives sector governance, and a niche role in health, education, 
and social protection, using our analytical work and global expertise for ‘best fit’ to support a 
more evidence-based policy dialogue, to leverage financing of key partners, and to influence their 
choices in program design; and 
• A substantial IFC program to promote inclusiveness and support growth by tripling access to 
finance, investing in mid-sized companies, tripling access to electricity, accelerating women in 
business, and formalizing agribusiness.

43. World Bank engagement in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville is consistent with 
the joint priorities outlined in the peace agreement and has been guided by the national 
Government’s views on where WBG expertise might be most usefully deployed in support of the 
reconstruction and reconciliation efforts.  As of mid-2012, three Bank projects were active in the 
province, covering mining sector governance, agriculture, and gender-targeted community 
development. As the date of a referendum regarding the level of autonomy for Bougainville draws 
closer (required between 2015 and 2020), discussions between GoPNG and Autonomous 
Bougainville Government (ABG) have signaled a need for more intensive revitalization of the non-
mining economy; WBG is prepared to deepen engagement in Bougainville by expansion of the core 
national portfolio, such as transport rehabilitation, telecommunications, and community infrastructure. 
Pillar 1: Increased and more gender-equitable access to inclusive physical and financial 
infrastructure 
44. 
The first pillar of WBG’s partnership in PNG will focus on providing increased access to 
inclusive physical and financial infrastructure in ways that benefit women and girls as well as 

14 

 
 
men and boys. With a rapidly increasing population placing heavier demands on physical 
infrastructure that is not being well-maintained, and with expectations of tangible benefits flowing 
‘automatically’ from minerals project revenues, there are overwhelmingly large and unprioritized 
demands for investment in physical infrastructure, and significant gaps remaining in terms of financial 
inclusion.  The WBG will focus support on areas where global evidence shows direct links between 
infrastructure access and reduced poverty, and where there is a disproportionately positive impact on 
rural households and on women and girls. 

45. 
One of the highest priorities shared by all PNG stakeholders is to improve the conditions 
of priority national roads and key provincial roads through rehabilitation, upgrading, and 
maintenance.  Given the country’s vulnerability to extreme weather events and natural disasters, and 
the disproportionate burden that falls on the rural and urban poor from those events, an increased 
focus on “climate proofing” infrastructure is also a priority.  WBG financial support will focus on 
rehabilitation of key national routes in designated provinces; complementary work will include 
piloting of gender-sensitive transport design elements, capacity building for medium-size local 
contractors, institutional support for relevant agencies to build capacity for “climate-proof” works 
design and maintenance, and policy dialogue with Government on mechanisms for more robust, 
consistent, and operational recurrent budget financing for routine road maintenance. 

46. 
PNG has experienced deregulation in the telecoms sector that allowed sharp increases in 
private investment, a rapid expansion of coverage and a dramatic drop in prices.  The very first 
World Bank loan to the then-Territory of Papua and New Guinea, through Australia immediately 
before Independence, established the first national telephone network.  Thirty-five years later, and the 
inclusive and democratizing dynamic created has been welcomed by government and citizens alike – 
as the lead partner in this sector, WBG will support increased coverage of rural areas by mobile 
networks and/or broadband, enabling increased use of ICT for transparency and accountability in 
monitoring basic service delivery. 

47. 
PNG’s financial services sector is more robust and well-regulated than many countries 
of similar age and income, but the dualistic economy has offered incentives to banks to serve 
elite and corporate clients more effectively and more creatively than the rest of the population.  
Private sector interest in expanding financial services into new markets, and strong leadership and 
vision from key national authorities, have led to a strong push to see financial services expand 
microfinance and SME banking services, encouraging rural outreach by financial services. As in 
telecommunications, the WBG leads partner support to this sector, and catalytic investments by IFC 
and the Bank will increase access to credit for SMEs in PNG, increase the number of women with 
bank accounts, and increase access by men and women to financial institutions in rural areas (through 
either branches or mobile networks). 

48. 
PNG is blessed with a wide range and vast potential for a more diverse and ‘green’ 
network of power supply and generation, and yet access to electricity remains below 11 percent 
nationwide.  This hinders economic activities, access to school and health services, and exacerbating 
already severe personal security problems. Global evidence shows clear linkages between improved 
access to electricity and reductions in poverty, and the new GoPNG priority on increasing electricity 
generation through renewable energy provides an opening to expand on workshops and knowledge 
exchange provided in 2011-2012 to build GoPNG’s capacity to deliver that access in pro-poor and 
‘green’ ways. WBG technical assistance and advisory services will support an updated and modern 
policy and strategic framework, facilitating investments by the government, WBG, and/or others that 
contribute to an increased access to electricity. 

15 

 
49. 
One of the most dangerous dynamics driven by the steadily increasing population in 
PNG is the deterioration of antiquated and traditional systems for access to proper and safe 
water supply and sanitation systems.  While for many years this area was an ‘orphan’ sector with 
little policy attention or funding, stakeholders have recently mobilized increased attention and now 
seek to allocate resources to sanitation and clean water services.  The WBG is supporting the scoping 
studies and workshops needed to build both the evidence base and the stakeholder consensus around 
both urban and rural water and sanitation priorities.  Pending the results of preliminary work, 
investments could include a focus on water and sanitation as an enabler of public health, with a focus 
on piloting proven solutions to extend services to low income urban communities. 
50. 
Existing interventions that form the base for CPS Pillar 1 include projects in roads 
transport, communications, and IFC and IDA investments in access to finance including the Risk 
Share Facility (RSF). Possible new activities may include additional financing for road transport and 
communications. At GoPNG’s request, use of a multi-tranche instrument such as an Adaptable 
Program Loan (APL), will be explored. A small IDA credit for energy sector strategy development, 
carried over from the previous CAS period, will both fill gaps in the national policy and strategy 
framework for renewable energy, and open possibilities for use of IDA credits or partial risk 
guarantees, IBRD loans, and/or IFC financing of private participation in renewable energy Private 
Public Partnership (PPP). Support for delivery of a national water and sanitation policy will make way 
for other resources in water and sanitation. An intensification of the Bougainville program could 
include additional financing for roads and communications projects. Indicative analytical work to 
support CPS Pillar 1 can be seen in Table 5.  

Pillar 2:  Gender-equitable improvements in lives and livelihoods  
51. 
The second pillar of WBG’s partnership in PNG will contribute to improvements in the 
quality of life and the livelihoods of women and girls as well as men and boys. To take better 
advantage of the livelihood opportunities offered by a growing and more diversified economy, and to 
begin to redress the stagnation in health and education status that is preventing Papua New Guineans 
from enjoying a better quality of life, attention must be paid to improving the quality and efficiency of 
basic service delivery in a gender-equitable way.  The WBG will focus support on productive sectors 
where we lead, and will complement the lead of other partners by providing niche interventions in 
health and education, and in social protection. 

52. 
For the 85 percent of the country’s population who derive their livelihoods from rural areas, 
future prosperity will require an improved enabling environment serving the agriculture sector, 
with a focus on improved productivity, including of key cash crops. This will need to be supported by 
improved agricultural infrastructure including feeder roads, technology, and other supply chain 
improvements. The country is largely food-secure, and a priority must be placed on maintaining this. 
Given the rich biodiversity of the country, and the persistent challenge of weather change and disasters, 
climate change research supporting a climate-resilient agriculture sector is needed.  WBG interventions 
will support expanded yields and profitability of smallholders growing cash crops, productivity gains for 
rural households growing food crops, improved sustainability and resilience to price and weather 
volatility, and improved market chain infrastructure.   

53. 
PNG is a young country with a young population, many struggling to find educational 
and livelihoods opportunities.  Developing programs to nurture and develop youth as agents of 
change and to increase opportunities for youth engagement in formal employment is a GoPNG 
priority. WBG projects will provide youth in urban areas with ‘second chance education’ programs 

16 

 
for completion of secondary school, with access to improved training and job opportunities, and with 
targeted monitoring of and support for female participation in the wage labor market. 

54. 
For investments by national government and key bilateral partners in access to 
education to produce improved educational outcomes, attention is needed on quality.  Building 
on the 2012 “fee-free education” initiative, attention must turn to quality inputs (educational 
infrastructure and materials, classroom resources, teacher training) and on understanding key 
dimensions of sectoral public expenditure dynamics in education.  The Bank will focus its ‘niche’ 
contribution in education to deliver better reading support in early grades and improved reading 
results for both girls and boys, and on an improved evidence base on education sector expenditures. 

55. 
The Bank will assist in multi-partner efforts to strengthen systems for HIV-AIDS and 
health programming, data collection and analysis, through a program of health sector analytical 
work will contribute to strengthened partnership and coordination with health sector stakeholders.  
Bank-supported health and HIV-AIDS work will bring global expertise to provide a national evidence 
base for improved investments by GoPNG and other partners, in such as way as to encourage PNG 
research institutions in building strategic alliances with international institutions. 
56. Working cooperatively with multiple stakeholders, the IFC will support public-private 
mechanisms that facilitate business and investment while removing impediments and 
inefficiencies in regulation and reducing business costs.  In both advisory work and investments, 
the IFC and the Bank will support efforts to increase women’s access to economic opportunities and 
awareness of economic rights.  More efficient opening, operation, and closing of businesses in PNG 
will be achieved by leveraging technology for business licensing processes, and reduced barriers will 
allow more women-owned businesses ‘graduate” to formal registered status. 
57. 
  Existing interventions that form the base for CPS Pillar 2 include: (i) Bank investments 
in smallholder productivity and IFC investments in coffee; (ii) IFC investment in manufacturing 
enterprises and Bank project in urban youth training and employment; and (iii) Bank projects in 
second chance education for school drop-outs and in quality enhancements for primary reading.  
Potential activities to build upon that base could include additional IDA financing for agriculture and 
youth projects, and potential IFC investments in agribusiness, manufacturing, and financial services. 
An intensification of the Bougainville program could include agriculture and urban youth. Potential 
areas for exploration include IFC investment in affordable housing, market chain infrastructure, and 
an agribusiness investment fund. Indicative analytical work to support Pillar 2 can be seen in Table 5.  

Pillar 3:  Increasingly prudent management of revenues and benefits 
58. 
The third pillar of WBG’s partnership in PNG will sustain support to the prudent and 
increasingly inclusive management of revenues and benefit streams at national and community 
levels. Building on the significant and stable gains made over the last decade on macroeconomic and 
exchange rate policy, on fiscal policy and debt management, and on the innovations emerging from 
both the private sector and government authorities on structuring, using, and monitoring benefits 
streams from extractives projects, the WBG will intensify support in minerals revenue management, 
support extractives industries transparency, deepen engagement on quality of public expenditures and 
public finance management (including procurement), and leverage pilots in gender-equitable 
community development and benefits management. 

59. 
Continued improvements in the national authorities’ ability to oversee the minerals 
sector are an essential building block in the Government’s stated goals of improving the 

17 

 
capacity of key agencies by upgrading regulatory and policy frameworks and building staff 
skills.  To help the state to play a more dynamic role in ensuring equitable distribution of benefits to 
landowners and broader community, and oversee sustainable investment of revenues to benefit 
current and future generations, the Bank will continue to support better governance in and 
accountability for oil, gas, and mining sector, with an focus on changes that will facilitate more 
equitable involvement of both women and men in community benefits. Building upon this platform of 
Bank work, an increasing IFC focus will be on support to improved sustainability through attention to 
environmental and social performance standards by extractives companies. 
60. Many stakeholders agree on the need for government to strengthen its partnership with 
private sector and community based stakeholders for development, but there has been limited 
progress in actually piloting new mechanisms and tracking results. PNG’s development discourse 
has dwelled on reasons why service delivery has stagnated, and on theoretical options for structural 
and policy change, but experience with pilots has been limited.  The Bank will deploy its vast global 
experience in Community-Driven Development (CDD), using block grants and community council 
capacity building to promote transparent accounting for money and results. 

61. 
New momentum is building for governance reform focused on strengthened budgeting 
and PFM for effective service delivery, with GoPNG setting itself the target of getting Public 
Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA) scores of A or B.  Stated priorities include enforcing 
accountability and transparency initiatives, and while there was little momentum for these reforms 
during the last CAS period key reform champions are now mobilizing a renewed consensus on 
procurement and PFM reform.  If requested, the Bank will provide technical assistance and policy 
advisory support for those reforms, and it will continue to support fiscal and debt sustainability 
frameworks and the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF).   
62. 
Niche support will be provided to data analysis. The primary partnership supporting the 
critical improvements needed in national statistics is between Australia and PNG, with auxiliary 
support from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. The Bank will be working in poverty 
monitoring and analysis build effective coordination between NSO and agencies that use data.  In 
focusing selectively on high-quality data analysis, the Bank program will contribute to an expanded 
policy debate about topics such as inequality, inclusion, and vulnerability, and if momentum builds 
for a multi-sector Public Expenditure Review (PER), or a health sector PER, the Bank will engage. 
Existing interventions that form the base for CPS Pillar 3 include mining technical 
63. 
assistance and oil/gas registry projects, women in mining and petroleum initiatives, and technical 
assistance for Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidacy, while ongoing pilots in 
three provinces will leverage the Bank’s global experience in community driven development.  
Possible new activities could include: an EITI MDTF grant, expanded CDD activities beyond the 
pilot provinces, new IFC work with resource companies on environmental and social sustainability 
programs, and support to public financial management and procurement reform. Indicative analytical 
work to support CPS Pillar 3 can be seen in Table 5. 

Implementation: Selectivity, Deep WBG Integration, and Accountability 

64. 
In bringing the newly expanded portfolio to full implementation, and building upon 
these investments with future interventions, the WBG will be selective. The re-engagement 
process has underlined the importance of staying in our core sectors and building long-term 
relationships with key partners rather than fragmenting the portfolio. A CPS costing exercise has been 
done, to ensure adequate support to the pipeline described here, which confirms the program is not 

18 

 
unrealistic. Our niche engagements will focus on bringing the WBG global reach and technical 
expertise to other partners, to leverage a more inclusive, sustainable, and ‘greener’ approach with 
‘traditional’ bilateral donors as well as new partners such as PNG Sustainable Development Program 
Ltd., whose long-term fund currently holds in excess of US$1.2 billion.   
65. WBG will deepen our integration:  The concurrent Bank re-engagement and IFC expansion 
in PNG from 2007 through 2011 has built a deeply integrated WBG approach to both strategy and 
program, where Bank and IFC teams routinely comment at concept-stage meetings, initiate sector-
driven brainstorming in key areas, deliver joint operations (SME RSF), collaborate on analytical 
products (Agriculture Sector Update), and convene joint teams on energy and/or telecommunications. 
66. 
A multi-faceted approach will be taken to accountability, governance, and anti-
corruption. Learning from the lack of progress on institutional governance and anticorruption work 
in the previous CAS, the WBG will proactively seek to tap into the increased momentum for reform 
amongst champions. Both inside our projects, and through small pilot efforts, the WBG will capitalize 
on the enabling environment provided by a vibrant and free media and increased use of ICT for social 
accountability to provide support to the stronger and more cohesive PNG coalition demanding reform 
(business associations, students, trade associations, key civil servants).  New work with GoPNG on 
procurement and PFM reforms will be linked into these demand-side mechanisms. 
67. 
Anticipated outcomes from the WBG program are set out in the results matrix in 
Attachment A.  This will be revised during implementation, and updated in a CPS Progress Report, 
with reporting of results consistent with the GoPNG’s MTDP and with the commitments made during 
the IDA16 replenishment. 

Financing Resources and Terms 

68. 
The financing envelope for this CPS, which includes both IDA and IBRD, donor trust 
funds and co-financing, and IFC investment capital, will be deployed in a flexible and selective 
manner driven by evidence of continued GoPNG macro-fiscal discipline and a prudent debt 
strategy, and higher quality pro-poor expenditures.  The CPS period (FY13-16) spans across two 
IDA replenishment periods (IDA16, covering FY12-14, and IDA17, covering FY15-17). The 
indicative IDA16 allocation 1 is Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 95.3 million, which provides access to 
approximately US$140 million (at current SDR exchange rates) for IDA operations committed by 30 
June, 2014.  The PNG IDA allocation for FY15-16 will be determined based on country performance 
increases, as reflected in CPIA and IDA portfolio performance in achieving results, and improved 
performance could lead to higher IDA resource allocations in the future. As a “Blend” country, PNG 
receives the majority of its IDA assistance on concessional blend credits; in addition, a small portion 
(about 3%) is available as hard term credits. 2  

1 IDA envelope is based on available resource from the IDA16 replenishment, and it is updated annually based on 
country allocation parameters. The allocation is firm only for the current fiscal year and indicative for the outer 
years, and the amount may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance 
rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the performance, other allocation parameters and IDA assistance terms 
for other IDA borrowers; and (iv) the number of IDA-eligible countries. 
2 IDA financing terms are updated annually and generally remain stable during a replenishment period. In FY13, the 
terms of blend credits are the following: a 25-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 1.25 percent interest 
charge; the hard term credits have the same maturity and grace period and carry a fixed interest rate of 1.5 percent, 
which is less concessional than blend credits but still more favorable than IBRD financing with equivalent maturity. 
Hard term credits are only available to blend countries. 

19 

 
                                                           
69. 
IDA will closely work with the authorities to deliver its assistance flexibly. Given the 
capacity constraints of implementing partners, the client preference for continued Bank selectivity, 
and the short time horizon for IDA16, the target is for 70 percent of those concessional resources to 
be channeled through additional financing to existing operations or repeater projects with the same 
agencies. In addition, the Bank will also work with the authorities to fully explore the flexibility in 
IDA financing, including the Immediate Response Mechanism that allows the inclusion of emergency 
related contingent components in selected investment operations, to support rapid response in eligible 
crisis and emergency situations when needed. Furthermore, in case of severe economic shocks and 
natural disasters, PNG could potentially access the IDA Crisis Response Window. 3  

70. 
Papua New Guinea’s strong economic performance and prudent macro-fiscal 
management over the last decade has brought them back into actual “Blend” status.  After nine 
years of IDA-only financing, an IBRD creditworthiness assessment undertaken by the World Bank in 
mid-2011 confirmed availability of a commensurate amount of additional resources beyond the 
current IBRD portfolio (approximately US$119 million outstanding as of 31 August, 2012). Various 
options for combining loans and guarantees will be explored, with indicative IBRD lending over the 
CPS period currently envisioned at about US$140 million. The actual level of IBRD lending would 
depend on government demand and how PNG's performance evolves in the CPS period, as well as on 
IBRD’s lending capacity and demand from other borrowers. Indicative financing is set out in Table 2.

IDA resources will focus on core portfolio investments in agriculture, transport and 
community infrastructure, and communications, with IBRD focused on high-return inclusive 
infrastructure. The joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis in April 2012 concluded that 
maintenance of the current debt levels could henceforth be characterized as a “low” risk of debt 
distress. The provision of IDA credits plus modest IBRD loans is consequently consistent with IDA’s 
debt sustainability framework and with the 2012 DSA, although plans would be revisited if a 
significant increase in loans is agreed by GoPNG with regional export-import banks. 

3 For details of the eligibility criteria, see Annex 3 of IDA (2011) “Additions to IDA Resources: Sixteenth 
Replenishment,” available at http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/IDA16_Report-English-Final.pdf.

72. IFC’s current investment portfolio is US$260m, and will be complemented by an expected 
US$10m in advisory services through ongoing or new programs.  A robust pipeline of potential 
new IFC investments signals an average of $50m per year over this CPS with opportunities in 
agribusiness, renewable energy, market chain 
infrastructure, manufacturing, services, and 
mining/oil/gas. Advisory resources will include areas shown in Table 3.

Building Evidence 
Base for Partners 

Bilateral resources from Australia through Pacific Facility 3-4 support analytical 
work on gender, socio-economic costs of crime and violence, multi-year program on 
health and HIV/AIDS, and possibly pilot programs in water and sanitation. 
The Justice for the Poor program addresses the political economy of benefits sharing 
in extractives economy (including gender), and costs of crime and violence. 
Grants from the (Global Partnership for Education Catalytic Fund) will continue as 
the primary source of Bank support to improved quality in primary education. 
The Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) may support a second phase of work 
with women in mining and petroleum communities. 
The Korean Trust Fund supported the development of the pilot Urban Youth 
Employment Project and may support an expansion of CDD work. 
 The State and Peacebuilding Fund supports the CDD block grants program in post-
conflict Bougainville, and could support more work in this post-conflict area. 
The Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction, together with linked funds from 
the Japan Policy and Human Resource Development Fund, are supporting climate 
change adaptation, community resilience, and disaster risk reduction 
 Multiple sources of grant financing will support work on renewable energy and 
‘greening’ initiatives: the Global Environment Fund (GEF), Energy Sector 
Management Assistance Program, and Asia Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE) 
 The global multi-donor Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) is financing scoping 
activities to define investments in water and sanitation as an enabler of health. 
Two private sector foundations (the Esso Highlands Program and the PNG 
Sustainable Development Program Ltd.) provide grants for community-based youth, 
CDD, and gender initiatives in extractives-rich provinces.

74. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has been a successful partner in 
PNG in the past, and can provide support and incentives for foreign investors looking at 
entering the PNG market including those served by the IFC. Through its Political Risk Insurance 
product, MIGA offers reassurance for investors concerned about political interventions or disruptions 
which might affect their returns. With uncertainty in the political, economic or regulatory 
environment, these guarantees offer protection for investors unsure about counterparty risk with the 
Government or about how more conventional political disruptions and civil disturbances might cause 
physical damage or disrupt their operations.  

75. 
A selective program of World Bank Group analytical work is proposed in sectors where 
the Bank has acknowledged global expertise, and where significant investments are coming 
from other partners.  An indicative analytical and TA program is set out below.

RISKS 

IV. 
76. 
Risks to the effective implementation of the expanded portfolio, and this proposed 
deepening of Bank Group engagement in Papua New Guinea are high. The CPS addresses these 
high risks systematically. Our historical treatment of risks in PNG has clustered consistently around 
five areas that cover both country risks and implementation risks: price and policy volatility, market 
uncertainty, or major economic shocks (either external or internal); sociopolitical turbulence, leading 
in extreme cases to civil unrest and violence; policy and governance gaps (including fiduciary failure 
and corruption); institutional inertia or inadequate capacity; disaster risk, and impacts of climate 
change and extreme weather. (See Attachment F for a summary of the risk review done in early stages 
of CPS discussions).  

22 

 
77. 
Although the risk categories have not changed much over the last decade, the relative 
intensity of specific risks, and the identification of mitigation actions and strategies, has evolved 
considerably. (See Table A in Attachment F for a visual summary of the evolution of the treatment of 
risk in the last three Bank strategy documents for Papua New Guinea).  This evolving risk profile 
acknowledges a change in the underlying risks or the PNG institutions and mechanisms that mitigate 
them, and a more informed and granular understanding of risks, including seeing the risks that are 
wholly within the WBG sphere of control, whose mitigation requires a proactive use of the evolving 
WBG guidance on situations of fragility and conflict.   

78. 
A retrospective validation of the risk assessment in the WBG 2008-2011 CAS was done 
to underpin a more holistic and realistic approach in the new strategy.  Table B in Attachment F 
offers an outline of how each of the risks identified in the CAS were seen to manifest, or not, during 
the program period, as well as a summary of actions that were, or were not, used to mitigate those 
risks, and their success.  Processes such as the investigation and resolution of the Smallholder 
Agriculture Development Project (SADP) Inspection Panel case, and the global WBG consultations to 
develop a framework and strategy for the oil palm sector, have also provided significant learning for 
the WBG program in PNG. Through these discussions the team has avoided treating the CPS as a 
tabula rasa of risk, instead using a structured discussion to learn systematically from the past. 
79. Maintaining an accurate understanding of risk and an appropriately calibrated 
mitigation strategy can best be done by making specific proactive changes in the way the WBG team 
operates.  First, continue the multidisciplinary investigation of the different dimensions of country 
risk by building on the analytical work done in the lead-up to this CPS (which included political 
economy analysis and socioeconomic fragility analysis done by teams including anthropologists, 
political scientists, sociologists, economists, and institutional and legal specialists) by embedding 
these analyses in the Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) program. Second, facilitate an iterative 
discussion to re-assess and revalidate the risk profile of the portfolio by using tools (like the 
Operational Risk Assessment Framework, external Peer Reviewer comments, and specific agenda 
questions) at the pre-concept stage, so the risk profile is actively updated.  Third, include an 
“institutional champion and reform” filter at the pre-concept stage (see below). 

80. 
Given the difficulties of sustaining reform momentum in PNG, both additional financing 
and new activities will be implemented in a sequenced way and linked to areas where there is 
clear reform momentum and multiple champions. Decisions on additional financing to ongoing 
operations, and on new investments in the second part of the CPS period, will be dependent on 
experience with initial interventions and an assessment of how to best support reform efforts by the 
government. The government’s expressed strong support for the program outlined in this CPS must be 
translated into active ownership and a willingness of key GoPNG leaders to drive reform in key 
sectors like agriculture.  

81. 
To operationalize this principle, pre-concept stage discussions will 
include an 
“institutional champion and reform filter”.  The team will candidly map the dynamics that will 
most influence: (i) initial support during design; (ii) momentum during appraisal and launch; and (iii) 
advocacy and trouble-shooting during implementation. Continued strong interest from the private 
sector in IFC services, and a consensus across national stakeholders that the WBG approach adds 
value, will be critical in ensuring effective implementation across the program. 

23 

 
 
 
83. 
Table 6 outlines the results of the risk review and outlines the primary mitigation 
measures. 
Table 6:  Country and Implementation Risks to WBG Program in Papua New Guinea 

Country Risks 
are persistent 
across all efforts 
in a country 
(economic risks, 
political risks, 
credit risks, 
etc.), and may 
be some 
combination of 
legacy and 
negative synergy 
(risks that 
surface in one 
sector increase 
perception of 
risks in another) 

Implementation 
Risks including 
Institutional 
Risks (weak 
capacity or 
systems in 
implementing 
partner agency) 
and Fiduciary 
Risks (potential 
for corruption or 
financial 
malfeasance, 
inefficient 
procurement, or 
poor handling of 
environmental 
and social 
safeguard 
issues) 

Potential Risks 
Political conflict may reverse policy gains, 
require ‘lowest common denominator’ PFM 
compromises, and obstruct governance 
reform. 
Continued global weaknesses, and volatile 
commodity prices, may trigger a decline in 
economic performance or an abandonment 
of fiscal discipline. 
Continued unemployment and frustration 
with failure to meet hyped expectations may 
lead to increased violence and criminal 
activity (especially in urban youth) and 
deteriorating social stability.  

Drastic change in oil/gas/mining 
legal/regulatory regime  

Natural disasters or climate-related impacts 
on pests or rainfall may cause economic or 
social disruption. 
Reversals on key debt management and 
acyclical fiscal policies, or deviations from 
current SWF plan, create a gap between 
GoPNG and partners (risky if large new 
loans are seen as solution to revenue 
shortfalls in 2013-2015). 

WBG engagement is too fragmented, short-
lived or small-scale to leverage institutional 
change and improve service delivery in long 
term.  
Lack of progress in establishing credible 
accountability institutions and strengthened 
governance leads to continued or increasing 
incidence of corruption and further 
deterioration in citizen trust in reform 
efforts. 
Continued inertia on PFM and procurement 
reform slows or stalls progress of 
implementation of key MTDP programs or 
undermines delivery of CPS interventions.   

Efforts to expand information-sharing 
mechanisms into more strategic coordination 
between government and development 
partners may not be successful. 

Mitigation Measures 
Support multi-stakeholder “demand pull” for 
transparency; use CDD pilots to model 
accountability; support EITI submission / 
candidacy with Trust Funds (TFs).  
Use recent experience to discuss risks (2012 
revenue gap shows dangers of overoptimistic 
forecast prices); broker dialogue with Asian 
Middle Income Countries (MICs) about risks. 
Support more informed debate about costs of 
crime and violence; prioritize implementation 
support to Urban Youth Employment Project 
(UYEP) to model an effective approach to 
youth disenfranchisement; support expansion 
of alternative dispute resolution tools. 
Close dialogue with new government; 
support for multi-stakeholder debate 
leveraging the value GoPNG places on its 
position with foreign investors. 
Leverage more grant resources for disaster 
risk reduction in core sectors of agriculture 
and infrastructure. 
Multi-faceted engagement with 
policymakers, MPs, public on risks of 
cyclical spending; move quickly w/ PFM and 
procurement TA if reform opens (be willing 
to expand use of TFs for PFM and 
procurement if GoPNG is reluctant to use 
IDA for a TA operation. 
Emphasize additional financing and repeater 
projects, mobilize grants for complementary 
actions in same sectors; use institutional 
champion filter to prioritize investments.  
Advocate for better governance; offer to 
work closely with GoPNG institutions 
created if/when new anti-corruption 
legislation is passed. Use ICT in Bank 
operations and pilot community projects to 
promote transparency and accountability. 
Jointly with partners, intensify dialogue to 
prepare reform agenda for PFM and 
procurement changes supporting service 
delivery.  Leverage bilateral and TF 
resources for reform-focused TA. 
Use key sectoral groups to increase effective 
coordination at that level (Bank co-chairs 
energy sectoral group); identify key aid 
effectiveness actions if/when GoPNG 
becomes more proactive.

Papua New Guinea CAS Completion Report FY08-FY11 

Date of CAS Board Discussion: November 20, 2007 
Date of CAS Progress Report: March 30, 2010 Report No. 53727-PG 
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: July 2008 – April 2012 
Date of CAS Completion Report: 30 May 2012 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This report is a self-evaluation of the Country Assistance Strategy for the Independent State 
of Papua New Guinea for the period FY08 to FY11 (Report No. 41571-PG) by the Country Team. 
Consultations were conducted with different stakeholder groups including: government counterparts, 
development partners, civil society and the private sector. The report considers two main dimensions 
of the CAS: the extent to which the program outlined in the results matrix was achieved, and the 
World Bank Group’s performance in designing and managing CAS implementation. The primary 
purpose of the report is to extract lessons which can be applied to the design of the next country 
strategy for Papua New Guinea. The main reference points for this evaluation are the Adjusted CAS 
Outcomes presented on page six of the CAS Progress Report, dated March 30, 2010 (Report No. 
53727-PG).  

2. 
The FY08-FY11 CAS followed a period from June 2002 to March 2007 when there was no 
new lending. This break in lending followed the deterioration of Bank-government relations sparked 
by the suspension of disbursements for the Forestry and Conservation Project in 2003 due to 
noncompliance with legal covenants, and with the country’s own legislation regarding the award of 
forestry concessions. Under an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) produced in 2005, the Bank focused on 
two objectives: (i) promoting development dialogue; and (ii) building the foundations for improved 
governance through a robust set of analytical activities. While the analytical work generated during 
the ISN period in areas such as telecommunications and energy provided a promising platform for 
reigniting the lending program, there were only two active IDA/IBRD projects and one small IFC 
investment at the start of the new CAS period.  

II. 

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT IN THE CAS PERIOD 

3. 
PNG has enjoyed markedly improved economic fortunes since the mid-2000s. The global 
commodity price boom and stronger macroeconomic management underlie much of the reversal 
from the declining real incomes and macroeconomic volatility of the preceding 10 years. The global 
downturn of 2009 had only a mild impact on PNG’s economy, which expanded by 5.5 percent, 
outperforming most other developing economies and its regional peers. This follows several years of 
6 to 7 percent annual GDP growth. While sharply higher global commodity prices have strongly 
supported incomes (average export prices doubled between 2005 and 2008, and were still two-thirds 
higher in late 2011), the non-minerals sector has led this resurgence, benefiting from private 
investment 
in future minerals production capacity as well as 
in 
the newly 
liberalized 
telecommunications and aviation sectors, for example. 

4. 
Stronger fiscal management has done much to transform windfall gains from higher 
commodity prices into sustained macroeconomic growth. The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2006 
placed ‘excess’ government mineral receipts associated with the rise in global commodity prices into 
various onshore trust funds and into paying down more expensive external loans and the 
government’s unfunded superannuation liabilities. By late 2011 gross public debt was expected to 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
near 20 percent of GDP, from about 70 percent in 2002. These accumulated surpluses then funded a 
fiscal impulse of as much as 13 percent of GDP in 2009-10 to counter the growth slowdown – more 
than permitted under the medium term fiscal strategy but with a less-than-proportionate impact on 
growth. 

5. 
With growth in demand outpacing that of productive capacity, inflationary pressures 
built and became increasingly domestically-focused. PNG’s consumers were buffeted by the 
global energy and food price rises of 2007 and 2008, which lifted year-on-year urban average 
inflation above 13 percent and urban food price inflation to above 20 percent. The subsequent retreat 
in global prices slowed local price growth, but only to around 5 percent year on year. As domestic 
demand pressures built through 2011, reported inflation approached 10 percent, with the actual rate 
likely to be considerably higher given measurement and coverage flaws with the official CPI.  

6. 
PNG’s financial sector, and the central bank’s restrained behavior, have been sources 
of strength for the economy. PNG’s banks were detached from the instability elsewhere and 
characterized by conservative lending practices creating excess short-term liquidity. NPL levels have 
been low and stable and capital reserves high. Credit growth has been modest relative to nominal 
GDP growth. The country experiences a structural excess of liquidity in the banking system, and this 
reduces BPNG’s ability to conduct monetary policy. Nonetheless, the central bank tightened the 
stance of monetary policy through calendar 2011 as inflationary pressures built, raising the overnight 
interest rate and banks’ official reserve requirements, and allowing a historically unprecedented 20 
percent appreciation in the USD/PGK exchange rate (between November 2010 and 2011). However 
market interest rates have been stable or fallen, limiting the impact on borrowing costs.  

7. 
Overall, the World Bank assesses PNG to have graduated from ‘fragile state’ status in 
2009, as indicated by the CPIA assessment. Improved macroeconomic management has been the 
key driver of this progress. Nonetheless significant institutional weaknesses continue to limit the 
capacity of government to apply effectively its growing financial resources to achieve its 
development objectives, with a ranking stalled just above CPIA 3.2 for three years.  

III. 

PNG’S OVERALL PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES 

8. 
PNG’s Medium Term Development Strategy for 2005 to 2010 (MTDS) was the main 
government document guiding preparation of the CAS. The MTDS promotes three strategic 
priorities: good governance, including public sector reform and enhanced political stability; export-
driven economic growth, focusing on sectors where PNG has a comparative advantage, such as 
agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, supported by mining, oil, and gas; and rural 
development, poverty reduction, and empowerment through human resource development.  

9. 
Considering the global Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets overly ambitious and 
unrealistic for PNG, the government developed its own national MDG targets and indicators, and 
incorporated these into the MTDS. The GoPNG 2009-10 national report on progress towards 
achieving the MDGs presented showed disappointing results (see Annex B for a summary of 
progress). It appears “very unlikely” that PNG will achieve 5 out of 8 MTDS targets, and 
“likely” that it will achieve targets related to poverty reduction and child mortality, targets 
which are set at a considerably lower level than the global MDG targets.  

10. 
Few Papua New Guineans experienced improvements in their living standards 
alongside the country’s strengthening macroeconomic conditions, and women’s conditions 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remained especially poor. The lack of progress in health conditions has been most notable. Progress 
in improving maternal mortality, HIV-infection rates and access to clean drinking water has 
disappointed over the past decade. Progress in improving access to education (in particular in 
reducing the gap between boys’ and girls’ enrollment) has been better, but PNG remains off-track for 
achieving universal primary completion by 2015. In 2009, the Department of Education calculated a 
national net enrollment rate in 2009 for grades 1-6 of only about 45 percent and a gross enrollment 
rate of about 78 percent, although there is significant regional variation and anecdotes suggest 
significant improvements in 2010 and 2011 as school tuition fees were eliminated. Progress in 
reducing poverty is unclear. Simulations of the poverty rate based on aggregate GDP and price data 
suggest a declining share of population living below basic means lines, however much of the 
aggregate economic growth has been highly concentrated (both geographically and among particular 
groups), and anecdotes suggest very poor living conditions persist in large areas of the country. 
Finally, crime and violence rates especially in urban areas and parts of the Highlands remain high, 
affecting both livelihoods (especially of women) and the cost of doing business.  

IV. 

ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF CAS OUTCOMES 

Assessment Summary 
11. 
The overall program performance rating for PNG CAS from FY08 to FY11 is 
Moderately Unsatisfactory. The re-engagement underpinned by the CAS generated significant 
momentum in both dialogue and programming; however, as Table 1 shows, most outcomes for both 
CAS pillars were either Not Achieved or only Partially Achieved. In cases where significant progress 
was made on intermediate indicators, performance was considered to be Partially Achieved. It should 
be noted that significant progress on the complete list of potential outcomes included in the CAS 
would have required resources far beyond those envisioned in the CAS envelope; this CAS supported 
a re-engagement in which a broad range of possible activities was put forth with the expectation that 
client demand would determine which ones were taken up through the improved policy dialogue that 
had been built with the Government.   
12. 
Indeed, the CAS document acknowledged that the program described was “more of a menu 
of valid assistance activities than a literal roadmap” and that it was “ambitious in relation to the Bank 
Group’s budgetary and lending resources.”  If the subset of CAS interventions that were taken up are 
considered as a whole, the CAS period did see a very satisfactory re-engagement which has built a 
solid base for achieving development impact.

13. 
The following paragraphs identify the strengths and weaknesses of the CAS program and 
provide more detail on this mixed performance. 

14. 
The CAS period began with only two active projects, and the clustering of the delivery 
of new projects at the end of the CAS period did not allow sufficient time for outcomes to 
emerge. Of the nine IDA credits active at the end of FY11, four of them were approved in FY11 and 
two in the last quarter of FY10. The two projects approved at the end of FY10 suffered significant 
delays in effectiveness which meant that activities only began in early FY12. The pace of three new 
project approvals per year envisioned in the CAS proved to be too rapid for a re-engaging client; 
accelerating the lending program from two to nine projects put significant stress on the capacity of 
government to design and process new projects with the result of long delays for even simple actions 
such as preparation of legal opinions.  

34 

 
 
 
 
 
15. 
Greater emphasis on lending operations compared to analytical work meant that policy 
and technical assistance outcomes were a small share of the overall body of WBG interventions, 
although the positive impact of Bank Group analytical interventions was quite notable. IFC 
advisory services to the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA) have had a measurable impact on the 
speed and ease with which business can be registered. Economic advice on managing natural 
resource revenues and linkages to other emerging economies’ approaches to sovereign wealth funds 
(SWFs) provided a strong point of departure in the design of a PNG’s SWF laws. And the evolution 
of the overall telecommunications sector, including the design of the National ICT Policy and the 
Universal Access Fund, was influenced by the Bank’s Rural Telecom Options Study.  

16. 
The absence of a supportive environment for public-private partnerships was an 
obstacle to IFC and IDA investments, but new opportunities for expanding access to finance 
and mobile telephony were seized by IFC. Rather than investing in restructuring state-owned 
enterprises in sectors such as energy and telecommunications, IFC made a catalytic investment in a 
new private sector operator, Digicel, which contributed to a rapid expansion in the mobile telephony 
market.  This effort was complemented by Bank policy advice on the regulatory environment. Lack 
of government consensus on public and private roles in the energy sector slowed progress in Bank 
engagement until the very end of the CAS period, with significant momentum building from 
November 2011 onwards and good prospects for transformative WBG involvement in the new CPS 
period.  

17. 
Effective government champions did not emerge in several sectors where significant 
activity was expected, so movement has been slow. The CAS anticipated investments in energy 
and rural development, and a major commitment to EITI. While none of these interventions came to 
full fruition, some significant advances were made during the CAS period. In each of these cases, the 
primary counterparts responsible for these areas took much longer than expected to forge sufficient 
consensus for activities to move forward. In the case of energy, the complexity of stakeholders 
involved in deciding on the roles of public and private sector meant that consensus was only reached 
in late 2011 with the approval of the new Electricity Industry Policy.  In the case of EITI, patient and 
modest investments in capacity and South-South learning reached a critical mass in February 2012 
with formation of the multi-stakeholder group and increased momentum building towards a Cabinet 
submission in the second half of 2012.  

18. 
It has taken time and significant effort to rebuild the institutional knowledge to operate 
efficiently in PNG after a period of limited project activity. The processing of projects suffered 
from various bureaucratic hurdles moving from preparation through to implementation, including 
delays in: preparing and signing Subsidiary Agreements; establishing trust instruments and 
associated designated accounts; processing withdrawal requests through a centralized unit in the 
Department of Treasury; etc.  With experience, ways to navigate through these procedures have been 
identified and applied, but the impact on the speed of implementation was significant, particularly for 
the two projects approved in FY08 and the two approved in FY10.  

CAS Pillar I: Promoting and maintaining sound economic and natural resource management  
19. 
The first pillar of the CAS aimed to consolidate improvements in economic growth and fiscal 
policy while increasing transparency and accountability in the management of public finances and 
natural resources.   

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20. 
Pillar achievements as compared to CAS goals. Out of six outcomes, one was fully 
achieved and three partly achieved. Strategic advice, contributed at a time of strong economic 
performance, led to improvements in debt management and fiscal management, and around future 
natural resource revenues. Dropping the planned project on public sector oversight left EITI as the 
only channel for strengthening mechanisms of transparency and accountability, and government 
engagement with civil society. EITI was slow to progress, but significant actions were taken in late 
2011 and early 2012, and a formal Government decision is expected in the second-half of 2012. Two 
projects that will contribute to goals related to this pillar are picking up pace in implementation; the 
Mining TA project faced delays in effectiveness but is now on-track, and the SME Access to Finance 
was approved late in the CAS period but is accelerating. Analytical work on climate change and 
disaster risk management has fed national strategy development and new grant-funded activity, but 
the grant projects have only recently launched.  

Bank assistance 

21. 
At the time of the CAS Progress Report, two of the six original outcomes were dropped: 
“improved oversight of the public sector, including by the Ombudsman Commission and Auditor 
General” and “improved effectiveness and transparency in budget preparation, execution and 
reporting.” In an effort to improve the likelihood of delivering an impact on governance, the Bank 
program shifted towards a more focused approach aimed at supporting improved government 
accountability and transparency in extractive industries, in particular, in mining. One new outcome 
was added to take advantage of opportunities created by massive new investments in oil/gas/mining, 
seeking to translate the medium-term expansion in construction and related activities into new and 
more sustainable SMEs.  

22. 
The CAS period began without any active lending projects under this pillar, and added two 
new projects, one of which was not included in the Proposed CAS Program (SME Access to 
Finance). Two projects were dropped (Oversight and Accountability and Gas Field Development). 
Table 2 presents lending projects, analytical and technical assistance activities that were both planned 
and delivered.

Outcome I.1: GoPNG shows continued awareness of the importance of maintaining fiscal 
discipline and a stable macroeconomic environment  

23. 
An historical reversal in external conditions, along with stable well-managed macroeconomic 
policy and the continued benefits of reforms early in the decade, all buoyed PNG’s economy. Bank 
engagement in this area built over the CAS period, providing both public interventions and more 
discreet commentary on developments and policy decisions. Engagement has been deepest around 
managing volatile natural resource revenues, through analytical work and by connecting PNG’s 
authorities to relevant policy makers in other emerging economies that offer insight into the design 
and development of sovereign wealth funds (including Mongolia, Chile, Timor-Leste, and others). 
The Bank has taken a leading role in the execution and analysis of a household income and 
expenditure survey, PNG’s first comprehensive effort in 13 years to measure living standards, health 
outcomes and update key macroeconomic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index and National 
Accounts consumption measures. The Bank led a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) 
mission in 2010 that assessed the potential for risks in the financial sector for the larger economy, 
and followed that with a range of targeted interventions.  The Bank has provided GoPNG’s debt 
management team ongoing support, with a DeMPA leading to training and skill-building programs, 
and is in discussions on a more robust program for the new CPS period. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outcome I.2: Expanded and strengthened multi-stakeholder mechanisms to review overall 
policymaking and extractive industries 

24. 
This outcome was adjusted in the CAS-PR to focus specifically on extractive industries 
rather than public spending as a whole. This shift came in light of the limited Government interest 
in follow-up on the Public Expenditure and Revenue Review (PERR), and the absence of appetite for 
a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS). The outcome specified in the CAS-PR focuses on 
EITI progress, namely the formation of multi-stakeholder structures to join and a cabinet decision to 
implement EITI. While modest progress was made with formation of a State Working Group on 
EITI, culminating in Government inviting industry and civil society to join the dialogue in early 
2012, the cabinet decision is not expected until later in 2012.    

Outcome I.3: Increased public availability of accessible information to support monitoring of 
government performance  

25. 
Despite strong support outside of government, the flagship project planned to deliver on this 
outcome, the Strengthening Institutions of Oversight and Accountability project, never came to 
fruition due to a lack of support within the Cabinet.  In the absence of the project, little remained in 
the Bank’s work program to influence public availability of information to assess government 
performance, except for EITI. As progress builds on EITI, early discussions are underway on a 
proposed capacity building program for government and civil society on EITI audits, with additional 
opportunities being explored for broader civil society involvement. 

Outcome I.4: Strengthened institutional structures in the mining sector, emphasizing 
transparent management and resource distribution 

26. 
Building on the first Mining Sector Institutional Strengthening Technical Assistance Project 
(MSISTAP I) which closed in May 2006, the second Mining TA project will strengthen sector 
governance and improving outcomes from social expenditures for mining communities. The Mineral 
Resource Authority has engaged in staff training and capacity building, and the Bougainville 
Department of Mining is operational and working on the “draw-down of powers” from national 
government. Progress has been made on tax and geotechnical capacity fronts, among other areas, 
although movement was limited until late 2011 due to significant delays and a lack of proactivity in 
MRA dialogue with other stakeholders such as IRC.  

27. 
Engagement in the oil and gas sector has been modest and slow to translate into a concrete 
activity; gas development risk-sharing with ADB envisioned in the CAS never came to fruition, but 
the Bank has mobilized IDC grant resources to support GoPNG in developing a registry of oil and 
gas licenses, following on similar Bank work in the mining sector.

Box 1:  Learning from World Bank Work in Mining to Model a Multi-Stakeholder, Multi-Sectoral Approach 
to Gender Issues 

• 

Bank experience in mining sector governance provides a model for integrating analytical and trust-funded work into 
IDA credits to build a platform for broader dialogue and more robust commitment to gender mainstreaming across 
the portfolio.  A 2006 JSDF grant to work with women’s associations grew out of diagnostics in mainstream IDA 
work in mining sector governance from 2000-2005, and in turn the lessons of the grant program implementation 
were fed into design of the follow-on IDA credit (2009-2013).  The key features were: 
• Ensure the locus of intervention is culturally appropriate: Support the economic and social empowerment of 
women for collective action through capacity building with women’s associations (PNG society built on 
collective customary systems) 
• Customize the interventions based on self-diagnosis and community demands: each community’s women’s 
association(s) defines their needs, and program helps meet them 
• Anchor program in authoritative institutions who already possess entrée to formal power structures:  design of 
grant proposal supported under first IDA credit through GoPNG Dept of Mining; JSDF grant implemented by 
PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum; lessons learned from JSDF implementation built into new IDA credit  
• Use close ties to government (through IDA credit) and industry (through Chamber of Mines) to nurture 
relationships between women’s association leaders, mining/oil companies (community relations, gender desk) 
and government policy makers 
Identify allies and male champions of change, and use those relationships to lobby successfully for formal 
systematic recognition of women and children’s issues in benefits-sharing and community investment 
programs; women’s representatives participate in discussions previously dominated by men in industry and 
government  
• Embed innovations into systems:  the 10 percent set-aside for women and children in the 2009 re-negotiation of 
the Ok Tedi Community Mine Continuation Agreement has inspired specific proposals being considered in the 
2010 Mining Policy Review. 
This multi-stakeholder engagement not only allowed for a more nuanced IDA credit design; it also broke down 
some of the embedded barriers to creative discussions on surmounting barriers to gender equality and women’s 
economic empowerment, which in turn laid the foundation for a participatory multi-stakeholder Country Gender 
Assessment.  
The CGA, which is being finalized in mid-2012, is unique in PNG experience for being genuinely participatory 
(with civil society and private sector actors involved actively in contributing to chapters of the draft CGA) and in 
being led by Government and facilitated by, not driven by, development partners (the ADB and World Bank with 
support from UN and Australia).  Building upon early momentum from the CGA multi-stakeholder process, the 
Bank has deepened networking on gender issues by ‘brokering’ connections between academia, civil society, and 
donors through the Gender Research Fair sponsored annually. 

Outcome I.5: Program in place to leverage extractive industry and enclave project revenues for 
broader SME employment  

28. 
This outcome was added at the time of the CAS-PR to enable the Bank and IFC to respond to 
the opportunities for new business activity and employment generated by the massive increases in 
oil/gas and mining investment. The rapid preparation, approval and launch of this innovative Bank-
IFC risk sharing facility is a noteworthy accomplishment in and of itself. Since this project was only 
approved in Q4 of FY11, only modest results will be delivered within this CAS period:  one of the 
two target financial institutions is active already in the RSF, loans began being issued in February 
2012, and the targeted outreach to women begins in mid-2012. 

Outcome I.6: Strategic framework for disaster risk management and climate change 
adaptation and mitigation adopted by GoPNG, and investment program supported by partners  

39 

 
 
 
 
 
29. 
A process for preparing a National Strategy for Climate Compatible Development was 
launched in 2010 with analytical contributions from the Bank. Unfortunately, the Bank’s 
analytical work lost momentum as it was completed at a time of controversy, when the government’s 
lead climate change agency was abolished following the firing of its Director on charges related to 
the fraudulent sale of carbon credits. Other bogus carbon finance deals were being negotiated with 
uninformed landowners which further undermined any movement toward operationalizing carbon 
finance schemes such as the REDD program, which was identified as a potential activity in the CAS.  

30. 
Climate change adaptation became the focus of Bank interventions, conceptually linking 
up with the disaster risk management agenda in the Pacific which was funded primarily through 
grants from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, and the Japan Policy and 
Human Resources Development technical Assistance Program. With the new Office of Climate 
Change and Development (OCCD) as the coordinating partner, a program of mainstreaming 
DRM/CCA strategies into two sectors where the Bank is most active, transport and agriculture, 
began at the end of the CAS cycle and was welcomed by Government as the most appropriate role 
for the Bank at this time. Support to the government also includes a national DRM/CCA Specialist 
placed in the OCCD since June 2011. 

CAS Pillar II: Improving Livelihoods and Service Delivery, Especially for the Rural Poor  

31. 
The second pillar of the CAS aimed to encourage broad-based economic growth and wider 
participation in economic development through expanded opportunities for income generation and 
improved services.   

32. 
Pillar achievements as compared to CAS goals. Out of ten outcomes, one was achieved 
and three were partially achieved. The long-running RMRP project reached its established targets, 
and is in the process of transitioning to RMRP II, applying the successful delivery model of the first 
phase and investigating potential design enhancements to be informed by ongoing research on the 
gendered impacts of road projects. Analytical work and policy advice in the areas of business 
registration, access to finance, telecommunications and health have produced the most tangible 
results, although much of these activities have yet to realize their full potential. Investment projects 
in the agriculture sector (focusing on oil palm, cocoa and coffee) faced significant implementation 
delays but are now accelerating, and plans for investments in community-driven service delivery and 
analytical work on HIV-AIDS are both underway as the CAS period draws to a close. Support to the 
education sector has taken a different direction than envisioned in the CAS, but funding has 
surpassed expectations and strategic policy advice has played an instrumental role in major policy 
change.  Government support for the increased Bank engagement was further enhanced by the 
request late in the CAS period for the Bank to lead a Sectoral Public Expenditure Review in 
education, which is ongoing. 

Bank assistance 

33. 
At the time of the CAS Progress Report, ten of the eleven outcomes remained relevant, and 
only one outcome was dropped, “improve potential in niche industries, including tourism.” 
Adjustments were made to some of the outcomes to better reflect the state of Bank interventions at 
the time, and to capture more relevant outcomes.  

40 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34. 
The CAS period began with two active lending projects, and added six new projects, one of 
which was not included in the Proposed CAS Program (Productive Partnerships in Agriculture), and 
one of which was substantially different than originally envisioned (Education). Table 3 shows 
lending and analytical assistance (both planned and delivered).

Outcome II.1: Stronger business enabling environment, with improved financial infrastructure 
35. 
The 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program, or FSAP, served as the baseline for 
WBG support to an increasingly robust, well-supervised, and inclusive financial services sector 
in PNG. Details on FSAP follow-on activities, and number of which are funded through the global 
multi-donor trust fund FIRST which supports financial sector regulatory strengthening and FSAP 
follow-up, may be found in Box 2. 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Box 2:  Broad WBG Support for a Vibrant Financial Services Sector 
The financial services sector in PNG is more sophisticated and effective than in many countries of similar age 
and income level, but there are still significant challenges in terms of financial inclusion, a need for more robust 
supervision and regulation adapted to new global industry developments, and better service across the full range 
of banking customers especially the large proportion of ‘unbanked” PNG citizens living in rural areas.  
Support and technical assistance, including work following on from the 2010 FSAP, includes: 
• World Bank support is being provided to the Bank of PNG and the Institute of National Affairs to conduct 
a Financial Competency Survey, using resources from the Russia-sponsored Financial Literacy Program 
Trust Fund, which will provide valuable “action-able” information to allow better design and 
implementation of financial inclusion programs. 
IFC support to the Bank of Papua New Guinea has helped to shape the National Payment System Act and 
Vision, while also procuring a new system for interbank clearing and drafting regulations for mobile 
payment. 
In PNG, the FIRST trust fund is currently supporting several critical activities: 

• 

• 

- 

Implementing On-site Supervision (with the PNG Office of Insurance Commissioner, or OIC) will 
strengthen supervision in the general insurance sector in response to the FSAP-identified need for deeper 
skills and increased technical and supervisory resources. 
- Development of Prudential Standards (with the Central Bank) will support BoPNG in updating the existing 
prudential standards and develop new standards in key risk areas. 
- Development of Crisis Preparedness Framework, (also with the Central Bank) will provide assistance 
requested by BoPNG to develop their crisis preparedness framework as per FSAP recommendations. 
In addition to these technical elements supporting improved financial sector oversight, the World Bank Group is 
engaged in strategic investments that focus on expanding access to finance in a way that supports much-needed 
diversification of PNG’s economy away from the dominant oil/gas/mining sector.  The IDA-IFC collaboration 
on a Risk Sharing Facility to improve SME access to finance is a cornerstone in this strategic sectoral program, 
and is open to participation by four of the nation’s leading financial institutions. IFC’s strategic investments in 
Bank South Pacific provides a platform for their multifaceted engagement focused on expanded access to 
finance for agribusiness, SMEs, women in business, and national businesses. 

36. 
Substantial IFC technical assistance, policy advice and investments have led to revised 
legislation and process changes that simplified procedures and improved access to finance for 
Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSMEs).  Support to the Investment Promotion Authority 
(IPA) will lead to the elimination of time-consuming business registration steps, and the 
establishment of an online registration system which is being rolled-out in 2012. Amendments to the 
Companies Act and Business Names Act are likely to strengthen corporate governance and simplify 
the registration and amendment of business names. 

37. 
Access to finance has improved with both IFC technical assistance to Credit and Data Bureau 
(which has led to a six-fold increase in credit inquiries) and IFC investments in PNG Microfinance 
and Bank of South Pacific (BSP), the latter of which included targeted support to rural finance.  
Since the IFC investment in PNG Microfinance in 2009, the value of loans outstanding has doubled, 
from K6 million in 2009 to K12.2 million in 2010.  

Outcome II.2: Greater number of public-private partnerships in infrastructure   

38. 
The PPP work planned for a wide range of sectors (e.g. fisheries, petroleum, and 
aviation) did not materialize. Rather, the planned PPP engagement in telecoms was directed at 
a private company (Digicel) and demand emerged for work on the supporting policy for 
Special Economic Zones (SEZ). In October 2010, IFC provided the Department of Commerce and 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Industry with detailed recommendations on the shape of Special Economic Zones legislation for 
PNG. GoPNG ran a consultation process with government agencies and, drawing from the IFC 
recommendations, prepared a draft Bill. A secondary part of the SEZ project (to be completed once 
the legal and regulatory framework was complete) – to undertake a market demand analysis for a 
fisheries processing economic zone and an assessment of possible sites  – was dropped when 
government pre-emptively selected the site of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone before the 
analytical work had begun. 

Outcome II.3: Sustainable increases in commercial agriculture production and artisanal and 
small-scale mining 

39. 
Significant delays in bringing the smallholder oil palm project from approval to 
implementation means delivery of planned outcomes has been delayed. This was the first lending 
project to be prepared following a long break in IDA borrowing, and was seen as a way to accelerate 
the re-engagement due to the strong case for return on investment. However, delays followed the 
project every step of the way:  it took 13 months to go from Board approval to effectiveness, and 
then another 10 months for the core project team to be established. To allow sufficient time to 
implement the project, government requested an extension and the Bank is restructuring the project 
to ensure that all activities planned within the extension period can be successfully completed.  With 
most of the building blocks for implementation in place by end-2011, road maintenance, improved 
extension services and infill planting of oil palm blocks started in early 2012; thus, increases in 
smallholder production are expected in mid-2012.  

40. With the addition of a project designed to improve the livelihoods of cocoa and coffee 
producers, the Bank expanded its agriculture program to cover the three crops (including oil 
palm) which constitute about 90 percent of PNG’s agricultural exports. While the project was 
only approved towards the end of the CAS period, and has yet to produce its intended results, the 
preparation of the project led to some minor achievements. The Bank worked with the Cocoa Board 
and other stakeholders on further developments of the national cocoa industry strategy and, through a 
partnership with Mars Inc., provided technical expertise to the Cocoa Board. Similarly, the Bank 
drew from global expertise to work with the Coffee Industry Corporation on a program to make the 
Coffee Industry Strategic Plan operational. 

41. 
A small grant project aimed at mitigating or eliminating the negative environmental, social 
and cultural effects of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) on affected communities, closed in the 
early part of the CAS period. The result tagged to this activity in the CAS Matrix was mis-identified, 
as it focused on increased ASM employment and incomes which could not be directly linked to the 
project design. The project did, however, produce valuable guidance and training for small scale 
miners such as a Guide for Community Clean Water Supplies, a Code of Safe Mining Practice, and a 
booklet on Laws Governing Small Scale Mining.  

Outcome II.4: Models for improved local service delivery tested through partnerships between 
government and civil society, and within and across communities 

42. 
Following the completion of a CDD stock-take and roadmap in 2007, an overly 
ambitious menu of analytical work and investment projects focused on local service delivery 
was proposed in the CAS. These plans, including a component of the smallholder oil palm project 
which was dropped during project restructuring, have been scaled down to a pilot rural service 
delivery project now planned for two provinces and co-financed by a Bank-managed trust fund and 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the PNG Sustainable Development Program (PNGSDP). Based on results of this pilot, the project 
may be scaled up through resources from IDA and other donors.  

43. 
Projects focused on strengthening the engagement of women and youth in local 
development have also been approved and are mostly in the early stages of implementation, 
providing indirect support to this outcome. Two grant-funded projects are supporting women: one 
focused on enhancing economic opportunities in mining areas, and another aiming to strengthen the 
role of women and women’s organizations in local development and post-conflict peace-building in 
Bougainville. As a result of the training provided by the Women in Mining project, participants 
have engaged in new income generating activities and taken on new positions of leadership in 
their communities. The Bougainville project is in early stages, but results are expected both in the 
form of strengthened women’s organizations and in the delivery of local services prioritized by 
women.  

44. With little detail provided in the CAS as to the scope and design of initiatives to address 
the needs of youth, the Bank’s attention to this target group has evolved into a sizeable 
investment project focusing on urban youth employment in the capital, Port Moresby. As with 
most of the projects in the active portfolio, the main project activities began only at the end of the 
CAS period, so there are no results yet. One achievement of project preparation is the agreement of 
several private sector companies (BSP, Digicel and Exxon-Mobil) to either provide in-kind or 
financial contributions to the project. See Box 3 on the next page for more detail on the ways in 
which the Bank has engaged the private sector to leverage pro bono specialized services and co-
financing in support of IDA-GoPNG development initiatives. 

Box 3: Leveraging Private Sector Contributions to Empower Youth and Communities  
One of the particular advantages of the private sector is the opportunities that it can provide to young people. A key 
achievement of the Urban Youth Employment Project (UYEP) is the involvement of private sector organizations, 
such as ESSO Highlands (PNG LNG), in the provision of co-financing for key project activities that complement the 
organization’s own community outreach programs. Financing from PNG LNG is being used to strengthen the focus 
on gender inclusion, communications and monitoring and evaluation as well as the Bank’s own supervision capacity 
of the project. PNG LNG is also providing funding to another Bank program aimed at empowering women in 
mining communities to engage more actively in oil project planning consultations, and to provide women with skills 
for improved livelihoods such as agriculture and micro-finance. 

Under the “Save Your Future” scheme, UYEP has signed a MOU with BSP Ltd and Digicel PNG to effect 
electronic payments to trainees and establish a link to the mobile banking system. The scheme will offer basic 
financial literacy training and involve setting up electronic bank accounts for each of the trainees that are eligible for 
work placements in order to help increase their knowledge, access and usability of formal banking services. 
Significant co-financing for Bank-funded projects has also been provided by the PNG Sustainable Development 
Program (PNGSDP), a corporate foundation established as a result of an agreement between the Government of 
PNG and the Australian company formerly operating the Ok Tedi Mine. PNGSDP has, for example, provided 
parallel financing for SADP and RMRP, and more recently decided to contribute funds to a trust fund managed by 
the Bank to support the piloting of the Rural Service Delivery and Local Governance Project. 

Outcome II.5: Improved condition of roads and bridges in selected provinces 

45. 
The Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project has achieved its performance 
targets, contributing to an increase in the percentage of roads in “good” and “fair” condition 
from 20 percent in 2002 to 74 percent in 2010.  In total, 640 kms of national roads, 220 kms of 
provincial roads and 65 bridges were maintained or rehabilitated. While project targets were met, it 
became increasingly difficult to meet these targets as the average cost of road maintenance per 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
kilometer increased sharply from 2008 to 2010. The high cost and difficulty of engaging contractors 
to work in isolated areas led to a decision to use the force account method of implementation in 
Manus province when the rapidly evolving market for contractors resulted in poor contractor interest 
in small and remote areas. See Box 4 for the lessons from this experience, which may have relevance 
for other countries with thin private sector capacity.  

46. 
Emergency assistance was provided in Oro Province through the Smallholder Agriculture 
Development Project to address the impact of the November 2007 tropical cyclone that devastated 
large parts of the province’s infrastructure. Early in 2008, IDA and PNGSDP agreed to support an 
emergency package to re-open access to smallholder oil palm blocks cut off by the flood.  Thirty-
seven culverts and seven wet crossings were installed with PNGSDP funding. 

Box 4: Use of Force Account to Re-Build Roads under Challenging Conditions 

In 2010, as part of the Bank funded Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP), the contractor hired to 
rehabilitate the East-West Highway in Manus Province defaulted on the contract, citing a number of factors which 
would not allow them to complete their contractual obligations.  The firm claimed that significant project delays 
were incurred due to adverse weather conditions, and that they were losing money by paying personnel that could 
not work during these periods; there was also consensus amongst the private sector that higher-margin opportunities 
were available in the Highlands provinces, and few firms remained interested in working in small and remote places. 
Arguing that hiring a new firm would prevent the project from being completed on time, with significantly higher 
costs if a new firm were brought in, the Department of Works (DoW) proposed implementing the project via a 
“force account” approach. It was considered that other contractors would not be interested in a relatively small 
project in an isolated location during a construction boom driven by the LNG project.   

Using force account, the DoW managed to complete the Manus East-West Highway rehabilitation on time, and 
within budget. Force account entails depositing project funds directly with the DOW; their IDA project management 
unit (EPM) supervised the construction works, as they would for other private contracting firms, and they ensured 
technical quality standards were met and that use of funds was efficient. While building private sector capacity 
through competitively bidding for and then implementing road works is the preferred means of implementing road 
works, this experience has demonstrated that “force account” is a viable alternative, particularly when some or all of 
the following challenging conditions are encountered: a) intense or prolonged adverse weather conditions, b) 
extreme isolation of project site, and c) limited timeframe for fulfilling necessary procurement procedures (for 
example, project closing date approaching or emergency response type situation). 

47. 
The results of socio-economic surveys beginning in project provinces in 2004 and 
finishing in 2009 revealed significant improvements in the lives of beneficiary communities, 
although the project only had significant impacts in specific areas. Access to markets (measured by 
trips to town) increased 1.7 times on average in sample villages, and only 1.4 times in control 
villages. Roadside sales increased and clearly benefited from the rehabilitated roads, with more 
traffic and passengers on the roads. Potential for income generating activity expanded especially for 
women, who can earn money near home and still mind children and attend to other household 
livelihood tasks. 

48. 
Originally slated to close in FY03, the Second Gazelle Restoration Project was 
restructured several times and extended to close in FY08. Since the project had only a few final 
activities in play at the beginning of this CAS period, the results framework did not incorporate 
indicators from it. However, it was a highly rated project, and in FY11, a review drawing lessons 
mainly on implementation through a reconstruction authority, and identifying ways in which those 
lessons can be applied to future reconstruction projects in PNG was completed and discussed with 
stakeholders. A summary of key lessons can be found in Box 5.  

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Box 5: Implementation Lessons from the GRA Post-Disaster Project 

2. 

As a post-disaster reconstruction project in a capacity-constrained client country, the GRA work might have been 
expected to perform only moderately well, but in fact it was well-rated by the Bank and Independent Evaluation 
Group, and very highly regarded by Government and communities. Lessons learned provide evidence of factors that 
contributed to success and might be relevant for other efforts, as well as actions that could increase Bank and client 
effectiveness not only in other post-disaster settings but in the challenging environment for project implementation 
throughout PNG: 
1. Constantly renew and cultivate relationship with National Departments, leveraging support through different 
stakeholders to resolve problems such as lack of counterpart funding. 
Intensive upfront training by donor agencies in procedures and practices can make a project run more smoothly, 
reducing delays, costs, and frustration levels. 
3. Reflecting on the implementation experience and recognizing the value that engineers played in nurturing the 
evolving private sector capacity to perform well on reconstruction contracts, GRA now feels they should have 
engaged more technical staff earlier in the program. 
4. Communications with the full range of stakeholders need to be better managed to ensure that the information 
being given to people was heard, and understood, in context. 
5. Explicit attention should have been given to the risk that even groups not directly affected – either as relocated 
populations or host populations – would feel either invested in or disadvantaged by the Medium Term 
Restoration Program (MTRP). 
6. Timeframes need to be realistic. It was apparent that the MTRP was too ambitious for a 3-4 year timeframe, 
thus placing unrealistic pressure on GRA and other stakeholders to deliver. 
7. As an example of transition from reconstruction to development, the GRA transition from the ITRP to the 
MTRP illustrates the importance of common principles and pillars that are widely communicated (and even 
publicly debated, as in the move of ENBPA from Rabaul to Kokopo) even though administrative arrangements 
and implementation modalities may change as the transition is made. 
8. Explicit agreement on both formal and informal “standard operating procedures‟ in the emergency context are 
important so that the broader team – implementing partner agency and donor agency – are not working at cross-
purposes. 
9. The short notice, intensive meeting schedules, and large volume of documents required for World Bank 
supervision missions were a significant burden to stakeholders, although GRA reported that they valued the 
technical support and mentoring from Bank missions. 
Extracted from the report: “Building Capacity by Rebuilding Community Assets: Learning from the Gazelle 
Restoration Authority (GRA) Experience.” 

Outcome II.6: Strategic energy sector planning launched to provide framework for investment 
in lower-carbon and lower-cost electricity in rural centers and urban concentrations  

49. 
The original CAS outcome of “improved availability and lower cost of electricity,” was 
modified in the CAS Progress Report to focus specifically on the strategic approach needed to 
make wise energy investments. After being fully appraised, the main project designed to achieve 
this outcome, the Energy Sector Development Project (IDA with GEF co-financing), stalled due to a 
lack of consensus among key government stakeholders regarding the roles of the public and private 
sectors in power generation and transmission. While Government stakeholders worked to resolve the 
delay, the Bank deployed a modest program of programmatic technical assistance (including 
workshops, a study tour to Lao PDR and highly targeted analytical work).   

50. 
These activities increased stakeholder awareness of hydropower financing options, and raised 
the social and environmental issues that must be managed as a part of a national hydropower 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
program.  This set the stage for the Bank to be brought in quickly at the end of 2011 when the 
Cabinet agreed on their Electricity Industry Policy and re-started plans for project negotiations, 
which are now scheduled for June 2012.  In close collaboration with Government, the Bank 
mobilized an ASTAE/PPIAF grant for support for the electricity regulator, and agreed with GoPNG 
on TA on information exchange (workshop bringing international perspectives) and consultant TA 
for capacity building on rural electrification access, to be deployed in parallel with the upcoming 
IDA/GEF project and to help lay the foundation for expanded engagement in the energy sector in the 
CPS 2012-2016 period. 

51. 
Two GEF-funded projects, with similar design and outcomes, were not successful in 
increasing use of renewable energy sources through incentives for buyers to borrow. Both 
projects relied on the use of risk-sharing guarantees with banks to encourage them to market 
specialized lending products for this purpose. Unfortunately, none of the financial institutions 
involved made an effort to develop and market these products, and, in the end, 24 loans were 
provided with total borrowing of less than $28,000 for both projects combined. For the larger project, 
the Sustainable Energy Financing Project, PNG only represented 6 percent of total borrowing for the 
three participating countries (PNG, Fiji and Solomon Islands). 

Outcome II.7: Expanded access to affordable and reliable telecommunications services in rural 
areas and outside Port Moresby 

52. 
As one of the most dynamic and competitive sectors in the PNG economy, the private 
sector is aggressively driving increased access to affordable telecommunications. The Rural 
Communications Project is in the early stages of implementation, so there are few significant 
achievements, although the Rural Connectivity Study completed in 2007, and subsequent follow-up 
technical assistance during this CAS period made significant contributions to the design of the 
Universal Access Fund.  The UAF (as a component of the National ICT Policy) was adopted by 
Cabinet in March 2009, and a new converged ICT regulator (the National Information and 
Communications Technology Authority, NICTA), combining the functions of ICCC and the past 
regulator, PANGTEL in telecommunications, was established to be independent of Government. 
Support to an inclusive and growing private telecommunications sector continued as well, with IFC’s 
Business Edge training program trained 130 Digicel distributors in good business practice and 
accredited four national trainers to deliver the training themselves.   

Original Outcome II.8:  Increased resources supporting higher primary school participation 
and retention 

53. 
This outcome remains highly relevant to PNG’s development strategy, particularly to 
reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDG #2).  The majority of external funding for 
PNG’s education system is focused on increasing access by expanding the supply of education 
(e.g. more schools, more teachers, more textbooks). The Bank provided technical support for 
drafting the Universal Basic Education (UBE) legislation which was endorsed by GoPNG in late 
2009.  The UBE initiative has been strongly supported since its adoption, beginning with the 
elimination of fees for elementary education in 2010 and the replacement of these fees early in the 
year with direct school grant subsidies.  The new Prime Minister and Minister of Education 
successfully pushed through  a K300 million supplementary budget allocation for UBE in September 
2011, and another K600 million increase was approved for 2012.  The objective of this investment is 
to make education free for all students through grade 10 and to replace parental fees with increased 
school subsidies.  The government expects that this initiative will enable PNG to achieve its MDG 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
goal of universal basic education by 2020, five years later than originally planned, but a dramatic 
improvement over the recent stagnation. 

54. 
The Bank’s more recent interventions in education are focused on improving the 
quality of educational outcomes.   The READ PNG Project ($19.2 million FTI grant) focuses on 
improving reading acquisition in elementary and primary schools.  Improved reading in the early 
grades will promote retention and primary completion, and so should also be seen as an intervention 
that promotes increased access.  The Flexible and Open Distance Education (FODE) Project invests 
in the stock of youth who have been failed by quality programs in the past.  It will increase the 
number of out-of-school youth who complete secondary diploma/certificate equivalency programs. 
These projects only began implementation in late 2011, so there are as yet no concrete results. 
However, it should be noted the FODE project represents the first education sector borrowing from 
IDA or IBRD in 19 years, and is thus demonstrative of GoPNG’s renewed appetite for investment in 
social sectors.  

Outcome II.9: Improved evidence base for health sector policies and plans  

55. With the completion of the Health Human Resources Review in September 2011, the 
evidence base for making decisions regarding sector staffing was significantly strengthened. 
The Review documented for the first time in over a decade the current stock of the publicly financed 
health workforce in PNG, and their characteristics and deployment across the country by type of 
health facility and health cadre. The report also presented a set of four demand scenarios, and drew 
out the implications for the health training system and the health budget for these scenarios. The cost

Outcome II.10: More effective national HIV/AIDS response through evidence-based policy and 
interventions 

57. 
Due to stubborn funding limitations and sometimes differing views of the multiple 
stakeholders involved, it took nearly three years to reach agreement on the Concept Note, governance 
arrangements and funding for the Integrated Bio-behavior Study (IBBS). Now underway in 2012 the 
survey is expected to provide accurate estimates of the HIV prevalence and determinants across the 
country, in turn allowing a better focused HIV program response.  

Measuring Bank Performance 

58. 
The World Bank Group performance rating is moderately unsatisfactory. The design of 
the strategy, while well-aligned to the country’s development priorities, was overly ambitious in 
terms of planned activities and outcome indicators. The identification of risks to implementation was 
too conservative, with overly generous assumptions about the speed with which a dormant program 
could be revitalized. IFC’s performance was, however, notably stronger given the absence of a full 
country office presence at the beginning of the CAS period, and the considerable improvements in 
the business environment, access to finance and telecom expansion which were nonetheless 
achieved.  

48 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
59. 
Although the country strategy was too ambitious, course corrections, including adjustments 
to CAS outcomes, were implemented – both through changes captured in the CAS-PR and through 
real-time intensification of implementation support following the CAS-PR to guard against further 
delays. The Bank took actions to process a significant portfolio increase in a short period of time, 
including adding new professional and support staff to the Country Office team, and training staff 
and government counterparts in operational areas such as disbursement, procurement, FM, and 
safeguards. The Bank’s relationship with government also improved dramatically, allowing an 
increased level of mutual problem-solving across the portfolio. 
60. 
Project ratings indicate adequate progress towards meeting development objectives, 
although implementation progress was weaker. Of the 9 IDA projects and 1 trust-funded (READ-
PNG) project which had completed ISRs at the end of the CAS period, 5 reported satisfactory (S) 
progress to achieving development objectives, 4 moderately satisfactory (MS) and 1 moderately 
unsatisfactory (MU). As for implementation progress, 4 reported as S, 5 as MS, and 1 unsatisfactory 
(U).  
61. 
Due to the newness of the portfolio, only 3 of the 10 projects had more than two ISRs; 
movement on project quality has been mixed between the latest two ISRs with some improving and 
others still struggling. This mixed performance is reflected in the fact that 30 percent of PNG projects 
were at risk as of May 2012, a rate higher than the EAP average of 21 percent but lower than the 37 
percent for the rest of the Pacific. Disbursement rates have been steadily on the rise, and will 
continue to gain in late FY12 and early FY13, as new projects actively disburse. (See Table 4, below, 
for performance indicators in PNG, the Pacific and the EAP region, and Annex A for a table of all 
ISR ratings; all data is reported as of May 2012.)

62. 
To manage the rapid expansion in the portfolio, the Country Office strengthened its 
presence on the ground. Three national sector staff (infrastructure, agriculture/rural development, 
and human development) and two operations staff focusing on fiduciary and overall portfolio support 
were hired. One new international staff was hired with wide portfolio and problem-solving 
responsibility, and another international staff member was transferred from Sydney to help establish 
the UYEP project and cover other social development issues.  IFC upgraded its operations from a 
representative office to a country office in 2011, reflecting the enhanced commitment to PNG and a 
scaled-up work program.  

63. 
Efforts to rebuild the capacity in PNG counterparts and stakeholders to work with the 
Bank have been steady. The number of project implementing agencies (some projects have more 
than one) rose from five in 2008 to twelve in 2011. Since none of these agencies had implemented 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
Bank projects in at least 10 years, and in most cases, never, the Bank has had to invest significant 
time and resources into building the capacity of these agencies to understand and apply Bank policies 
and procedures. Starting before the rapid increase in new project approvals, from February 2009 to 
September 2011, the Bank organized three multi-agency training events on procurement and four on 
financial management, with three of them being combined fiduciary workshops. Two one-day 
safeguard training events were also conducted.   
64. 
Coordination with Development Partners is strong, with sector-specific variations in 
Bank engagement. The Bank is an active participant in the Development Partners Roundtable as 
well as in a number of sectoral coordination groups. Government leadership in donor coordination is 
particularly strong in four sectors where the Bank is active: education, climate change, energy and 
gender.  There is a desire among development partners that the Bank be more engaged in 
coordination and information sharing in sectors where it plays a leading role within the donor 
community, such as agriculture and mining. 
65. 
Implementation risks were inadequately identified in the CAS.  The implementation risks 
identified in the CAS primarily focused on ownership and demand for Bank engagement in 
governance reform. The CAS did not adequately identify the implementation risks of re-engagement 
and a significant scale-up in project activity and effective mitigation measures. Mitigation measures 
were identified in CAS-PR such as training of implementing agencies and building up of local staff 
numbers and capacity. While significant improvements in relations with government have taken 
place, in retrospect it would have been important to recognize that improved relationships do not 
automatically translate into improvements in program processing and implementation capacity.  
66. 
Procurement capacity has been a constraint and preparation of procurement 
documents in advance of effectiveness could speed implementation. Several projects have 
struggled to recruit and retain competent procurement staff and advisors. This has been partly due to 
the limited pool of individuals with training and/or experience in public sector procurement. 
Individuals with credible CVs, hired for key roles, failed to perform on the job and caused significant 
bottlenecks. Government should advertise more widely for such consulting opportunities, and 
undertake more rigorous reference checks, and the Bank can play a more active role in helping 
project teams to find qualified procurement consultants.  
67. 
Projects have often not focused adequate attention on the mitigation actions suggested in the 
project documents in relation to procurement risks, which in turn has caused delays.  For example, in 
low-capacity situations advance planning is often under-emphasized, and thus when project teams do 
not prepare procurement documents sufficiently in advance of effectiveness, they spend valuable 
project time in the early months of implementation going “back-and-forth” with the Bank seeking no 
objections. Applying the lessons learned by Bank teams working in institutionally fragile 
environments elsewhere, the Bank and government have agreed to more proactively engage technical 
assistance in advance of effectiveness to prepare key procurement and financial documents, and the 
Bank’s specialists can assist in this effort. 
68. 
Financial Management performance has been largely satisfactory, but clarity is needed 
in the application of government policies and procedures regarding taxes and audits. Aside 
from some delays in receiving audit reports, FM challenges did not significantly delay project 
implementation. There are issues, however, which were not dealt with satisfactorily during project 
preparation. In general, Auditor General (AGO) audits are accepted as sufficient for annual project 
audits. However, payment for AGO-commissioned audits is an additional cost to the project, and 
includes not only the cost of the auditor, but a fee for the AGO as well. The AGO process of 
procuring contracted auditors also needs to be reviewed to ensure that it meets Bank standards. Bank 

50 

 
 
projects can also not make effective use of tax exemptions for foreign aid projects as Bank projects 
which are exempt may not use IDA funds for GST because this exemption can only be applied on a 
refund basis. As a work-around, GoPNG uses its own funds to pay for GST and then collects the 
refund. Project teams are not sufficiently aware of the pros and cons of using the exemption, and 
have therefore projects have become stuck, particularly when they have had to wait for GoPNG 
funds to be made available to pay GST. 
69. 
Safeguard policies have been successfully applied, with a need for improvement in 
applying the Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP 4.10) highlighted by an Inspection Panel case filed 
against the SADP project. In the Inspection Panel case, concerns regarding environmental 
safeguards were considered by the Panel to be sufficiently covered. No other specific environmental 
concerns were raised during the CAS period. The primary focus of improvement in applying OP 4.10 
will lie in strengthening the implementation of consultations, particularly in ensuring appropriate 
translation, participation and documentation. See Box 6 for a summary of other lessons for good 
consultations emanating from the Inspection Panel case.  A desk review of safeguards performance in 
the Pacific Portfolio also highlighted the need to increase attention to safeguard monitoring during 
project implementation both by the client and the Bank. Continuous training is also needed to 
strengthen government capacity to implement safeguard policies. 

Box 6: Quality Consultation and Documentation Key to Social Safeguards 
With approximately 840 distinct ethno-linguistic groups, and more than 90 percent of land under customary 
ownership, the majority of Papua New Guinea land area comprises traditional communities and their customary 
lands.  Whenever these lands or traditional communities are affected by a project, whether it be positive or negative, 
the World Bank’s Indigenous Peoples Policy is triggered.  When direct project beneficiaries are largely IP 
communities, the policy gives the option of not requiring a separate IP plan; when a proposed project involves 
significant adverse impacts (such things as relocation and loss of communal land), a stand-alone IPP may be the best 
way to protect the community from adverse affects.  When the benefits are largely voluntary and positive, the policy 
provides that rather than designing a separate Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP), the elements of an IPP must be 
integrated in the overall project design. 
The Bank and project management units have learned several lessons in applying this policy to PNG, particularly 
through its response to an Inspection Panel claim against the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project. It is 
highly recommended that such lessons are applied to all relevant future projects in PNG. These include: 
 Define what “broad community support” means in the context of the project, and clearly document this support 
for the project. 
 Translate summaries of key project documents (i.e. PAD, ESMF, safeguard assessments, etc.) into Tok Pisin and 
any other local languages that project affected people may say they need to understand the project and disseminate 
in project areas. 
 Properly record all consultation information, including: location, participation, main topics discussed, complaints 
raised and resolutions agreed, etc. 
 Once decisions are made on whether or not to modify project design or implementation as a result of consultations, 
actively feedback those decisions to the groups consulted with, and document that “feedback loop” in a detailed 
fashion. 
 Ensure that appropriate community representatives are involved in consultations, including both local government 
and traditional leaders. 
 Involuntary taking of land by the project is highly discouraged, and the process for verifying voluntary use should 
be agreed with customary authorities and carefully documented.

Lessons learned and recommendations for future strategy and program design 

70. 
Be more modest in the selection of results during a period of re-engagement. Starting 
from a zero or low base of activity means that significant time will be needed to put in place the staff, 
systems and procedures needed to support the client to manage new projects. By the time these 
building blocks are established, there is little time remaining to see results such as increased 
megawatts of power and increased enrollment. Intermediate outcomes provide a more realistic 
measure of progress during re-engagement. The choice of outcome indicators should be highly 
selective, focusing on results from projects either already active or having a high level of readiness 
for implementation.  

71. 
Advance project readiness beyond current levels by the time of approval. Delays in 
achieving effectiveness or initiating major project components can be reduced by ensuring that the 
implementing agencies are well advanced in their efforts to recruit key project staff and consultants, 
establishing bank accounts, and preparing procurement packages. Most projects approved during this 
CAS have spent valuable time after the signing of legal documents trying to establish implementation 
capacity, increasing the likelihood of requests for project extensions and restructuring increases. 
Actions to consider for improving readiness include: (a) provide for retroactive financing in cases 
where implementing agencies can advance the funds; (b) engage fiduciary staff more actively to 
provide line ministries with hands on support for establishing systems, and (c) provide direct Bank-
executed funding for FM and procurement during the first year of implementation, delivered in a 
collaborative way that nurtures GoPNG ownership while relieving them of some of the 
administrative burden. The use of effectiveness conditions to address fiduciary capacity issues should 
be reconsidered.   

72. 
Sustain support to key sectors and institutions delivering visible services, particularly at 
a time when public expectations are high and dependent on the perceived benefits of large 
resource extraction projects. With huge gains from LNG production prominent in public discourse, 
the inability of government to deliver on development promises could lead to political instability and 
public unrest. Sustained sector engagement will both allow the institutions responsible for these 
projects time to strengthen their capacity to deliver public services, while also producing visible 
results in local communities: better maintained roads, expanded mobile phone coverage, and 
improved employment for youth and school leavers.   

73. 
Plan sector engagement to include the potential for a range of instruments that can be 
adjusted to adapt to the varying speeds of sector engagement. If large and complex projects are 
being advanced and time is needed to allow for new or rejuvenated stakeholder consensus building, 
smaller interventions such as study tours and workshops can be important tools for maintaining 
engagement until the timing is right to proceed with larger, or scaled up activity. In the case of the 
energy sector, such flexibility was required to allow for consensus to develop on the roles of the 
public and private sectors in electricity generation. A similar approach was taken in the piloting of a 
new community-driven service delivery model when the responsible government department had 
concerns regarding its own capacity to manage a large activity. Such flexibility is especially 
important when institutional capacity is assessed as weak. 

74. 
Continue to strengthen the case for return on investment for social sector projects, 
particularly to highlight the importance of human capacity in sustaining economic growth. 
While it is significant that government decided to borrow for two social sector projects (Youth 
Employment and Distance Education), GoPNG remains skeptical on whether social sector activities 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be financed by credits/loans, given large amounts of bilateral grant funding available. 
Discussion with key government stakeholders of returns on Human Development investments in 
other similar countries would help to strengthen the strategic thinking of government regarding ways 
in which different sources (i.e. grants and loans) can be combined to maximum effect.  

75. 
Reasons why projects came to fruition during this CAS should be considered in 
selecting projects for the next CAS. These include: political will, evidenced by the combination of 
a Ministerial champion and strong support from senior technocrats; a good fit between WBG 
comparative advantage and client goals; compelling evidence of high return on investment, 
particularly when grant funding is an alternative; and visible and significant impact on people living 
in rural areas.

Lessons for the New CAS 

PNG Microfinance is 
operational, and its loans 
outstanding have doubled 
from 2009 to 2010.  
Not achieved 
No new PPPs were 
established with Bank or 
IFC support. The PPP 
Policy was adopted by 
government in 2010, but it 
has yet to be applied to a 
specific geographic area or 
sector. A market demand 
analysis for fisheries 
processing economic zone, 
and a site assessment of 
possible sites, was dropped 
when GoPNG selected site 
and secured own financing. 
Not achieved 
Delays in implementation of 
the oil palm investment have 
meant that the main project 
activities only commenced 
in late 2011, and will thus 
only generate new 
production in late 2012. A 
new project supporting 
cocoa and coffee sectors 
will further increase 

Regardless of the level of 
intellectual engagement 
across key counterparts, 
dramatic changes in national 
approaches to public-private 
partnership requires not only 
technocratic support but 
client-led consensus at the 
political level.  Without a 
Cabinet champion, 
technocratic consensus will 
not be sufficient to generate 
decisions. 

Statutory boards/industry 
organizations still face 
significant challenges in 
terms of governance, audits, 
& implementation capacity, 
and progress is 
correspondingly slower than 
usually expected, even when 
compared to projects led by 
GoPNG agencies.

counterpart funding for

The community-driven 
service delivery mechanism 
pioneered by the Bank 
remains new to and untested 
in PNG, and the funds flow 
through local government 
systems pose challenges 
even in setting up 
implementation

place, the commitment to 
piloting should allow 
sufficient time for a 
thorough testing of this 
alternative system of service

Summary 

Lessons for the New CAS 

Achieved 
The Bank provided technical 
support for drafting the 
Universal Basic Education 
(UBE) legislation endorsed 
by GoPNG in late 2009.  
The UBE initiative has been 
strongly supported from the 
outset, beginning with the 
elimination of fees for 
elementary education in 
2010 and the replacement of 
these fees early in the year 
with direct school grant 
subsidies.  The effectiveness 
of both Bank projects was 
delayed by many months 
primarily due to inadequate 
government capacity to 
establish the project units, 
with projects activities only 
starting in very late 2011. 
Partially Achieved 
The HR Review 
documented for the first 
time in over a decade the

A pro-active approach to 
implementation readiness is 
critical in PNG. At the time 
of agreement signing, the 
implementing agency must 
be sufficiently staffed to 
either begin implementation, 
or to conduct the 
recruitment process in a 
timely fashion. Recruitment 
activities should optimally 
take place during the period 
immediately after approval 
and signing, rather than 
occupying valuable time 
during the first months of 
implementation. 

A more nuanced and 
iterative process for 
delivering, discussing, and 
disseminating products of 
analytical work is needed in 
sectors where the Bank’s 
key contribution is 
intellectual, rather than 
financial, such as health.

TARGETS  
Decrease by 2015, the proportion 
of people below the lower poverty 
line by 10 percent (using the 1996 
national average figure of 30 
percent as the benchmark figure). 

Increase by 2015, commercial

secondary level and above by 
2030. 

MDG 4 

Reduce the Infant Mortality Rate 
to 44 per thousand by 2015. 

Reduce the Under Five Mortality 
Rate to 72 per thousand by 2015. 

2010 ASSESSMENT 

LIKELY: Progress was monitored by several proxy 
indices and since 1990, the combined impact of all these 
proxy indices indicate a small improvement of about 5 
to 10 percent in the poverty situation. In other words, 
PNG is more or less on track with its national target. 
However, the continuing very high Gini coefficient is a 
clear example that improvement in the poverty index 
does not necessarily translate into development in which 
citizens of the country share equally. 

POTENTIALLY: Although some progress was made 
with regards to access, retention and achievement, 
progress is disappointing, 
considering that the educational reforms that started in 
1994 should have been completed in 2004. Against its 
national MDG targets, it appears that PNG is slightly 
lagging behind with regards to access to school and 
more significantly with regards to retention and youth 
literacy. 

POTENTIALLY: Gender disparity in many areas 
(education, literacy, employment, longevity etc.) is not 
as large as often 
assumed. However, PNG’s gender culture places women 
in a disadvantaged position. Gender based violence 
(GBV) in particular is widespread and this is one of the 
factors that fuels the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This poses an 
enormous threat for future development and is 
considered a cross-cutting challenge for the achievement 
of all MDGs. 

LIKELY: In 2009, the national target for under-five 
mortality was achieved. Moreover, if current trends 
persist, the IMR is expected to come very close to the 
2015 national target. 

65 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excerpt from GoPNG 2009 National Progress Report on MDGs 

2010 ASSESSMENT 

VERY UNLIKELY: The trend in maternal mortality 
since 1990 suggests that the national target is 
unachievable. PNG’s very high level of maternal 
mortality is another clear indication of significant gender 
disparity and inequity. 

VERY UNLIKELY: Monitoring of HIV/AIDS is 
exacerbated by the fact that data remains very 
incomplete and defective. However, with the increased 
number of testing sites, monitoring after 2004 has 
improved. The available evidence suggests that there is 
as yet no sign that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has 
stabilized. The same also applies to several opportunistic 
diseases that are closely associated with HIV/AIDS, 
especially TB, pneumonia and malaria. 

VERY UNLIKELY: PNG has signed 46 multilateral 
environmental agreements and a very large number of 
indicators were adopted for the monitoring of progress. 
However, most of these have never been measured and 
may never be measured. Furthermore, monitoring is 
made very difficult because of the conflicting views with 
regards to environmental issues, especially in the area of 
forests and forestry. Moreover, monitoring that is carried 
out is fragmented and uncoordinated.

Papua New Guinea Medium-Term Macroeconomic Projections 

1. 
The baseline projections represent a median scenario. Aggregate GDP growth slows in 2013 
and 2014 from the strong rates achieved in 2010 to 2012, as construction of the PNG-LNG and spin-
off private sector investments concludes. Growth then spikes in late 2014 and 2015 as the production 
from the PNG-LNG raises the level of GDP rises by around 25 percent. This production makes little 
contribution to non-mineral GDP, the decline in construction activity dragging on the aggregate 
economy. The start of and return to production at a number of smaller mines in 2012 and 2013 
provides some additional support to real GDP in those years relative to non-mineral GDP; the 
allowance for some fraction of the resource projects currently in the development pipeline to start 
development in 2014 and 2015 provides some offset to the end of PNG-LNG construction. 

2. 
In the external accounts, ongoing foreign direct investment and debt inflows fund the PNG-
LNG and other private investments, which require large capital goods and service imports, expanding 
the current account deficit to near one-third of GDP at the peak. As this deficit is fully funded by 
committed capital inflows this is not considered to be a point of vulnerability. The modest retreat in 
export prices between 2012 and 2014 slows growth in export values and the trade surplus, as well as 
the growth in the income deficit (which a large share of export earnings repatriated to the project 
owners). Inflation, predominately driven in recent quarters by large positive demand shocks 
constrained by a lagging supply response, is expected to remain persistently high (underlying annual 
rates between 6 and 8 percent), only gradually moderating towards 6 percent at the end of the 
projection period. The downside risks associated with lower global energy and other prices is offset 
by the potential for the exchange rate to weaken, absorbing the remaining disinflationary impulses 
from the exchange rate appreciation of 2010 through early 2012. 

3. 
The revenue profile of aging resource projects, the concessional arrangements provided to 
projects now coming on-stream, and the weakening in export prices especially when expressed in 
PGK terms, will see government revenue decline in real per capita terms, breaking the previous 
decade’s trend of strong growth. Expenditure is expected to slow less sharply, leading to a shift to 
deficits from 2012, although these are likely to be modest and sustainable under the Treasury 
department’s projections that spending will also grow less rapidly than inflation and population. The 
fiscal non-mineral balance is expected to remain volatile. Despite this tightening in fiscal conditions, 
the growth in nominal GDP and assumed stability in the exchange rate are projected to further lower 
the ratio of public debt to GDP. 

4. 
A scenario of a sharper external economic downturn would see sharper falls in the 
international prices of PNG’s exports to around 2006 levels, and scarcer financing for new projects, 
leading to slower net foreign direct investment inflows, declines in export receipts, and, over time, a 
weaker exchange rate. These developments would cut growth especially in nominal GDP, and, with 
it, fiscal revenues, leading to a larger deficit, which would become unsustainable without a correction 
in spending plans and/or significant improvements in collection. While the non-mineral economy 
would be less effected than the aggregate economy (because resource activity is most exposed to 
global prices), output and employment growth would be modestly slower relative to the baseline 
projections. Note that PNG’s gold exports provide some buffer to deteriorating global conditions or 
global inflation, given the role of gold as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. (This 
scenario draws on the more extreme projections associated with a scenario of a disorderly workout of 
the European sovereign debt situation weakening commodity demand and ‘higher risk’ currencies, 
and significant tightening in the availability of funds for long-term investment on global capital 
markets.) 

67 

 
 
 
 
 
5. 
The third scenario simulates the impact of domestic social/institutional disturbances, 
creating difficulties for the private sector to operate and the public sector to deliver services. This 
would see a sharp fall in foreign investment inflows and prompt nationals to expatriate their savings, 
leading to a weakening of the currency, especially after BPNG has run down its foreign exchange 
reserves. This scenario sees a more substantial slow-down in non-mineral GDP than aggregate GDP, 
as the latter would be supported by enclave resource projects while the former is more reliant on 
ongoing improvements in general social and institutional conditions. This scenario would also see 
strong inflation, eroding real spending power of those in a slower-growing labor force. The 
disconnectedness of resource production supports exports, while the disruption to the domestic non-
mineral economy and to new investment plans slows import growth, boosting the trade surplus. The 
government deficit would be smaller than the baseline and external downturn scenarios, as revenues 
would grow faster with the acceleration in nominal GDP (expressed in PGK) due to rising local 
currency prices following the exchange rate’s deprecation, while the value of spending is assumed to 
remain at baseline levels or may even weaken due to lower implementation capacity.

Gender Dimensions of PNG’s Development Challenges 

The 2011-2012 PNG Country Gender Assessment was structured to build upon the GoPNG 
National Policy for Women and Gender Equality 2011-2015, which says:  

Gender equality is when the roles of women and men are valued equally. The definition has three 
aspects: equal opportunities, equal treatment, and equal entitlements … Gender equality overcomes 
stereotypes, prejudices, and other barriers so women and men can contribute to and benefit from 
economic, social, cultural, and political developments in society at the same level.  

In a highly participatory and consultative process involving a wide range of stakeholders 
representing some four dozen institutions and agencies, the 2011-12 PNG CGA provided a snapshot 
of the gender dimensions of the nation’s development challenges, focusing on access to resources 
(through education, health, employment, and entrepreneurship), access to rights (through legal and 
social empowerment, and freedom from violence) and access to voice (through participation in 
decision-making).  The result is an evidence-based document that covers the critical gender issues of 
concern, informed both by sectoral data and knowledge and by the 2009-2010 Household Income 
and Expenditure Survey, or HIES which provides the first nationally-representative household data 
since 1996. The intent is to develop a shared platform of understanding, to allow key stakeholders to 
jointly diagnose the gender-related barriers to poverty reduction and sustainable and inclusive 
economic growth.  A sampling of key findings includes the following: 
• Women and men are both very involved in the agricultural sector, but beyond that there are 
inequalities in economic opportunities for women and men that lead to inefficient use of the 
country’s labor resources. 
• There are stubborn differences between women and men in formal labor force participation, 
in range of occupation, and in wages paid. 
• Girls and young women contribute many more household work hours than men and boys – 
even if the men or boys are not employed or doing entrepreneurial activities 
• While women’s and girls’ responsibilities for child care and other household chores may be 
one obstacle to their ability to attend school or contribute to household income, concerns for 
girls’ safety are a very significant barrier 
• The country's legal framework still has provisions (and gaps) that mean there are different 
"rules of the game" for women and men that affect their ability to participate in the economy 
and society, and some of these factors mean women experience less effective rights and 
protections under the law 
• There are gender gaps in education, health, and nutrition – girls and women to not enjoy the 
same level of literacy, school participation, health care, and treatment of disease – influenced 
BOTH by household choices AND service delivery failures 
• The most dramatic difference in women's and men's participation in political decision-
making comes at the provincial and national levels. 

The table on the following pages summarizes the potential actions identified throughout the CGA 
by topic groups that each focused on one specific area of concern, and also shows which of these 
actions were flagged as the highest priorities (as indicated by higher “ranking” numbers in the 
Table).  Scoring was done using a metric that included which actions were considered as being of 
highest importance, which were identified as ‘quick wins’ implementable immediately, and which 
were judged to be capable of generating political will and consensus.

Potential Actions to Increase Access To Education, Health, and HIV-AIDS 
Treatment 
• Mobilize high-profile senior GoPNG leadership in the NEC to send both public 
messages and departmental circulars reinforcing key government policies, and 
institute mandatory monthly monitoring of compliance with these: 
− Maternal and child health services are officially exempt from fees 
− Survivors of domestic violence are officially exempt from higher fees 
charged on “tribal violence” injuries 
• Strengthen the provision of care to survivors of gender-based violence at aid 
posts, health centers, and the new CHPs by revising protocols and including 
GBV in pre-service and in-service curricula for primary health service providers 
• Collaborate with the proposed donor-financed national survey on GBV and 
begin routinely collecting data through the NHIS on service use by survivors of 
GBV. 
• Develop and make available male-focused sources of information on HIV 
prevention, and referrals to male providers of services for HIV and STI. 
− Provide budget to the NDoE Gender Equity Desk, appoint Gender Focal 
Points, & develop Division Gender Action Plans (per NDoE Gender Equity 
Strategy Plan) 
• Prioritize collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data on enrolment and 
completion as fee-free education and UBE continues; report publicly 
• Update the NHIS database system to permit easier retrieval of sex-
disaggregated data across all categories, and introduce systematic annual 
reporting and analysis of the routine sex-disaggregated NHIS data collected on 
outpatient visits  
• Use results of 2012 IBBS to better identify the HIV status of men and women at 
different ages; form new program guidance using that information 
• Conduct the NHS planned assessment of partner and stakeholder capacity to 
design, implement and report on gender-responsive HIV-AIDS programming. 
• Mobilize high-profile senior GoPNG leadership in the NEC to send both public 
messages and departmental circulars reinforcing key government policies, and 
institute mandatory monthly monitoring of compliance with these. 
• Support a joint effort by the NDoE and the DNPM to reconcile and align the 
various strategy documents’ programs and interventions related to gender parity 
in education, with specific focus on bringing the MTDP sections 3.4 and 5.3 
and the UBE and NEP2 all up–to-date with concrete and costed actions on 
gender parity. 
Potential Actions to Increase Access To Employment, Livelihoods, and 
Economic Resources 
• Use the current and upcoming reviews of mining and oil& gas policies and laws 
to provide for mandatory participation by women in negotiations, and guidance 
on allocations of dedicated shares of benefits based on Ok Tedi CMCA. 
• Prioritize donor support and municipal budget allocations for  market safety 
initiatives

− Prioritize the proposed IFC support to “FAST”, a program that provides 
basic financial and business literacy to women farmers 
Include a specific gender focus in the proposed Agriculture Sector Update 
planned by the World Bank in collaboration with DAL 
− Link these analyses to an investigation of the gender-differentiated impact 
of climate change (pests, rainfall, land use changes) on rural livelihoods 
• Seek support for the Department of Petroleum and Energy to invest in 
institutional mechanisms that support programs for women in petroleum, just 
like the MRA does for women in mining. 
• Consider a targeted ‘deepening’ of the successful alternative dispute resolution 
program ongoing at the national court to focus on sectors where increased 
access for women to efficient and low-cost dispute resolution will significantly 
improve their productive economic involvement (as in key agriculture niches 
like coffee)  
• Request collaboration and support from key donors on tax policy and 
improvements that make it easier for informal sector to formalize and “graduate 
up”. 
• Convene a review group to support the CLRC in drafting amendments to the 
two laws that currently affect women negatively in livelihoods and employment 
(the Wills and Probate Act, and the Employment Act with regards to 
underground and night work) 
• Provide systematic training for judges on the gender implications of their 
rulings under the Matrimonial Causes Act. 
• Finalize and pass the draft law on using moveable assets as collateral. 

• 

Investigate the positive benefits that could results from a GoPNG partnership 
with investors at the PMIZ in Madang to commit to improved work conditions 
for the largely female canning workforce, with robust GoPNG monitoring and 
enforcement 
• Follow through on the DMPGM corporate plan commitment to draft legislation 
and policies specifically related to women in mining. 
• Support agriculture sector research that focuses on post-production constraints, 
such as gender-differentiated benefits from improved marketing chain and cold 
storage  
Potential Actions to Increase Access To Rights Through Legal and Social 
Empowerment 
• Seek donor support for more extensive training for Village Court Magistrates – 
many of whom are now women – on GBV especially intimate partner violence, 
and link this to mediation as a key method of resolving disputes 
• Provide high visibility GoPNG support to collection and analysis of nationally-
representative data on gender-based violence to allow for more evidence-based 
programming by all stakeholders

programs to address cultural constructions of masculinity and the implications 
for perceived condoning of aggression and violence, especially with inputs by 
local PNG institutions and academic / research bodies 
• Convene a dialogue with service providers and faith-based institutions to 
develop service standards and core training modules for safe havens and 
counseling programs like Meri Saif Ples. 
• Provide explicit and public Government support – messaging at a minimum, if

Understanding Socio-Political Dynamics and the Drivers of Violence and Fragility 

1. 
Papua New Guinea (PNG) is an extremely ethnically and socially diverse society. While the 
country is rich in natural resources, it continues to struggle with diversifying its economy and 
addressing the myriad conflicts that have arisen around the use of these resources, as well as 
bridging the deep divides among its many social groups. 

Drivers of Resilience or Fragility: Socio-Political Dynamics in PNG  

The challenge posed by crime and violence, and by institutional fragility, can be understood as the “cost” to Papua 
New Guinea’s society and economy of not successfully addressing the mis-match between exposure to internal 
and external stresses and the social capacity to manage these stresses. The five primary stresses on PNG are: 

Social and cultural:  gender inequalities in power and constructions of masculinity that emphasize aggression, 
rapidly transforming social norms, large youth population, distrust in modern state institutions, substance abuse 
(alcohol, marijuana), belief in supernatural phenomena such as sorcery and manipulation of that belief (all internal) 

Citizen and state security: inaccessible and remote rural areas with little or no presence of formal state institutions, 
increasing and unregulated availability of firearms, growing private security sector also largely unregulated, central 
role of conflict in traditional life of clans (internal); introduction of Western governance systems (external) 

Economic:  recent and rapid growth in rural-urban migration, stubborn income poverty and growing inequality 
(especially in urban areas), high unemployment (especially among youth), unequal benefits of resource projects 
accrued to communities (internal); adverse commodity price movements, natural disasters and extreme weather 
related to climate change, dominant role of multinational resource companies with diffuse accountabilities 
(external) 

Justice:  lack of confidence on the part of citizens in law and justice agencies; under-resourcing of the justice 
sector, failure of customary conflict management mechanisms to handle modern-day violent conflict and crime 

Political:  strong patronage politics within decentralized and central state structures, limited professionalism of 
political parties, incitement of violence during campaigns and key political decisions 

2. 
This analysis aims to inform the dialogue around the 2012-2016 Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) for Papua New Guinea by describing some of the key drivers of fragility in PNG and offering 
orientations for addressing these. Based on the lens developed in the report Societal Dynamics and 
Fragility 5, the analysis conceptualizes fragility as a problem both of state capacity and also of 
dysfunctional relationships in society that do not allow an efficient state to be built and maintained. The 
analysis is based on an extensive review of the literature, and can be further developed through 
discussions with key stakeholders in PNG, including communities and representatives from different 
social groups, state agencies and small businesses. 

I. PNG is socially fragmented with little common identity or vision.  

3. 
PNG is home to a diverse and highly fragmented society, with cooperation between groups 
taking place only transiently, and in highly specific situations. This makes it difficult to create a common

identity and vision between different social and ethnic groups within PNG, and with the state apparatus 
that would support that vision.  PNG is estimated to have between 2000 and 18,000 different clans – 
loosely defined as extended networks of families that form the basic social and political units of society. 
With close to 1000 different languages spoken among a population of approximately 5.3 million people, 
it is the most heterogeneous country in the world.6 Clans are both small and inherently unstable, as group 
boundaries are constantly shifting, and allegiances with other groups tend to be short-lived.  

4. 
Conflict – often involving violent fighting – is a central part of inter-clan relationships in PNG. 
Power is consolidated with ‘big men’ in the community, who win their status by demonstrating strength 
and power. Cooperation between clans takes place only for a specific battle or exchange and there are 
even deep, long-lived rivalries between clans. Rivalries are passed down to the younger generation 
through traditional story-telling, such that tensions between groups often become entrenched and survive 
for generations. Disputes may lie dormant for an extended time, and resume suddenly when a new event 
or issue triggers the old claims. The persistence of these conflicts and their periodic mobilization causes 
untold disruption in social relationships as well as violence that kills hundreds of people each year.7  
The geographic isolation of different clans from one another contributes to this social fragmentation. 
Some clans, particularly in rural areas, while they might be aware of the existence of other ‘ethnic 
groups,’ have never encountered them directly.  As a result, many individuals do not see their identity as 
extending beyond the clan or ethnic group.  

5. 
In this context of social fragmentation, creating a common vision and fostering a sense of 
citizenship that can generate strong collective action presents a considerable challenge for the state.  
Clans see very little incentive to cooperate beyond the short term. The state has been unable to unify 
clans under a common vision, because formal state authorities have little legitimacy in most 
communities. Instead, they are viewed as ‘anonymous’ outsiders who cannot be trusted because they are 
unknown to the clan, and whose functions are largely irrelevant to the daily lives of most people. This 
fragmentation makes it difficult to establish a set of national priorities that would serve the needs of a 
large group of people in the population. 

II. Extreme power imbalances between men and women in PNG – often enforced with violence - 
threaten social cohesion and the overall economic progress of the country. 

6. 
Deep gender inequalities reflect deep power imbalances in PNG. The United Nations 
Development Programme ranks PNG 133 out of 138 countries included in its Gender Inequality Index. 8 
Women are considered the ‘property’ of men, subject to the will of their male family members, 
especially their husbands. Polygamy is legal and common, and with the introduction of a cash economy, 
has further weakened women’s access to material resources.9 As such, ‘ownership’ rather than 
collaboration defines the relationship between men and women. 10 Women are expected to be dutiful to 
their husbands and to be a resource drawn upon by men in pursuit of their aims.  At the same time, 
exaggerated masculinities embedded in the cultural notion of the ‘big man,’ encourage the use of 

6 There is significant internal variation in the number of ethno-linguistic groups in a province, with some being relatively 
homogenous, and others- such as the Highlands provinces being the most diverse.  
7 Estimates suggest that approx. 20% of the population may be affected by ethnic violence, with some provinces, such as the 
Highlands, experiencing even higher levels.

violence, not only, as described above – in fighting between clans and other social groups- but also by 
men in their relationships with women. Domestic violence is highly prevalent,11 representing the most 
common form of violence in PNG, 12 and is sexual violence against women and children is also 
common. 13 These extreme gender inequalities, and the violence that often enforces them, weaken social 
cohesion among individuals and communities.   

7. 
Women’s participation in the economy is curtailed by their low and vulnerable social status. 
Within the family, sons are valued over daughters because they are viewed as future heads of families, 
resulting in significant inequalities in school enrollment rates, and low literacy rates for women. 14 This 
bias impacts directly on individual women’s capacity to participate in the economy, and indirectly 
impacts the capacity of their children to thrive as well.15 Economic productivity is also directly impacted 
by security concerns arising from the extreme gender inequalities. Fearing for their security, women in 
some parts of the country report that they don’t want to leave the household. Those trading goods at 
market, for example, are vulnerable to rape and other serious sexual assault, accusations of sorcery, 
robbery, beatings and intimidation by men in the market-place and on roads and public transport, 
especially public motor vehicles (PMVs).  
These deep power imbalances also affect women’s relationship with the formal state. In PNG, as in 
many fragile contexts, women’s relationship to the formal state is mediated through the family and clan. 
They have little voice and decision-making power, within both the private and public spheres. The result 
is a formal state that does not respond to the needs, and is not accountable to, fully half of its citizens. 16 
Similarly, women’s voice in customary institutions is often silenced by the “Big Man” authority system, 
which is founded on notions of masculinity, wealth and strength. The benefits of stronger development 
outcomes, and better-informed policy choices and strategies that result from women’s participation in 
decision-making 17 are also forfeited in PNG. 

III. Competition for land is increasing with economic shifts, creating divisions between clans, 
within clans, and within families that can easily lead to violence. 

8. 
The shift over the past 30 years from an economy based almost entirely on subsistence 
agriculture to one where the economy is dominated by a limited number of natural resource exploitation 
projects has put stress on relationships between different social  groups- between clans, within clans and 

11 One study found that 80-90% of injuries treated at health clinics were the result of domestic abuse (Amnesty International 
2006). Another found that the majority of pregnant women at an antenatal clinic had been beaten- during pregnancy- by their 
husbands (PNG Law Reform Commission 1992 quoted in Kopi 2010).

15 Empirical research from PNG shows that a mother’s education is at least three times more ‘productive’ than father’s 
education in terms of generating positive health and nutritional outcomes for children. (Gibson, J. 1997, “How Can Women's 
Education Aid Economic Development? The Effect on Child Stunting in Papua New Guinea” Background paper prepared for a

2011).

even within families.  In the past, social and economic equilibrium had been maintained across groups 
through the informal compensation system. 18   

9. 
The introduction of large-scale natural resource projects which benefit a select, limited group, 
but stimulate little growth in the remainder of the economy have put stress on this system for 
maintaining a social and economic equilibrium. Enclaves have emerged around these projects, creating 
‘haves’ and  ‘have nots,’ generating intense competition and aggravating perceptions of injustice 
amongst these groups who benefit directly, and those who don’t.19 

10. 
In particular, the introduction of large-scale resource projects has created disputes and 
competition around access r to land.  The majority of the land in PNG – an estimated 80-90%  - is held 
communally. More than simply a productive asset, land helps define the group’s identity and clans have 
a strong spiritual connection to their traditional lands.  Land has historically been a source of conflict in 
PNG, with disputes over ownership, boundaries and usage common between neighboring groups. Some 
of these disputes go back several generations.  

11. 
The leasing of land to private companies under the 1996 Land Law has led to about 11 percent 
of communally held land being used by private companies for agriculture or logging. 20 The 
accompanying increase in the value of land is effectively giving clans more wealth to fight over; it has 
likely contributed to an observed increase in disputes between clans over land.   

12. 
The lease of communal land also has deepened divisions within clans. In some cases co-owners 
of communal land have either not given informed consent, or have been persuaded to go along with the 
acquisition without understanding the full implications. Once the implications of the lease become 
apparent, or if the owners do not agree with the use of the land or of the benefits accrued to them, there 
is tension between owners, lessors and even local government. Manipulation of land ownership by 
political and economic elites also takes place, and can create tensions between co-owners who do not 
always agree on the transaction.  

13. 
The introduction of large-scale resource projects that rely on land acquisition has also 
contributed to intra-family disputes. In such cases family members, often young men, disagree with 
decisions over leasing of land or of the distribution of royalty payments within the extended family. 
There is evidence that disputes over land within families are now overtaking intra-clan disputes in their 
number.   

IV. Public sector positions are captured by narrow interests along family, clan and ethnic lines  

14. 
In several parts of PNG, 21 social fragmentation and patronage are strongly reflected in the 
political and local governance system. The design of political systems and governance institutions has a 
centrifugal effect on societies, accentuating differences between groups, and heightening tensions and 

18 Under this system, material compensation can be demanded from one group by another - ostensibly to resolve a particular 
grievance. Many observers have described how long-dormant disputes can be suddenly activated by groups that have suffered 
a depletion of their resources (usually pigs) in order to gain resources held by more affluent groups. 
19 In some cases, compensation claims have been activated to acquire some of this newly created wealth.  Other cases have 
been documented of wealthier groups, after receiving royalty payments, starting fights with less-fortunate groups in order to 
trigger a compensation claim and thus demonstrate their wealth.  
20 While the government of PNG has supported the evolution of a set of policies that are intended to redistribute tax-revenues 
from mining, petroleum and logging back to the customary owners of land from which the wealth is extracted, it is not clear 
whether the transfer of such entitlements is guaranteed under the lease-leaseback scheme and Land Act. 
21 This is particularly the case in Enga, Simbu, the Eastern Highlands and the Southern Highlands.

rivalries as public goods are delivered only to allies of those in power.  The strength of the wantok 
system –in which members of a social group (clan, family, or even the same province) are obliged to 
reciprocate and support each other results in strong expectations  that elected leaders will prioritize 
rewarding individual supporters directly over serving the interests of their geographical  constituencies.  

15. 
Given these potential rewards, the stakes for getting a member of one’s own clan into elected 
office are high, fueling intense – often violent - competition across ethnic groups. 22 In the Southern 
Highlands Province for example, where constituencies are defined largely geographically, corresponding 
to ethno-linguistic groups (Mendi, Huli and Kewa speakers), ethnic competition in local governance has 
led to intense competition not only in the election process itself but also in administration. In many parts 
of the country, local governance results in the exacerbation of rivalries, and that diversion of public 
goods towards serving the interests of a limited social group.  

16. Whilst a change in the design of the electoral system from a ‘first-past-the post’ approach (the 
plurality system) to the limited preferential voting system for the elections in 2007 and 2012 has helped 
somewhat in curbing the ethnic polarization of politics, the political party system is still very weak, and 
voting continues to be heavily influenced by family, clan or regional alliances. The party system 
produces very large numbers of political parties, based largely on individuals rather than ideological or 
policy platforms.  

17. 
The design of provincial administrations contributes to the patronage system in local 
government. Once in office, Members of Parliaments are given substantial control over provincial 
government expenditure programs, with weak oversight from the national executive. The legal 
framework regulating provincial government gives substantial powers to provincial politicians, and it is 
difficult for national government to play a supervisory role or to intervene in provincial affairs- leaving 
space for mismanagement of funds and corruption. 23 Political appointments for civil service positions 
are also growing in a number of provinces, as politicians seek to consolidate their power and control 
over the distribution of resources. 

18. 
Provincial governments hold substantial power over resources allocated to local government. As 
provided under the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local- Level Government, the 
provincial governments are responsible for planning, budgeting, accounting and reporting. However, 
there is little transparency and accountability in the budgeting and expenditure of public funds, and in 
many districts, development project funds and recurrent budget funds for day-to-day operations are 
diverted from local government to the provincial level. Institutional design prevents effective oversight 
by national government, creating a space for provincial-level corruption and mismanagement of funds. 
Many provinces have experienced at different times, high levels of public dissatisfaction with the lack of 
service provision and unmet expectations. As already experienced in parts of country- in particular in the 
Highlands- there is the potential for this dissatisfaction to be mobilized by political agitators, resulting in 
deeper social divisions and violence. 

V. Intergenerational conflict is growing, as the gap between the values of older and younger 
generations widens 

22 Competition routinely takes violent forms. Election-related violence, for example, was particularly high in 2002, when 
numerous deaths and incidences of assault, robbery, vandalism and damage to property and intimidation were perpetrated by 
candidates and their supporters. In the Southern Highlands Province, firearms were allegedly distributed by candidates to 
their supporters. 
23 As an example, the 2002 SHP audit, conducted by Price Waterhouse Coopers, found that approximately K50 million had 
been misappropriated from provincial revenue by successive SHP governments over the audit period 1998-2002. There was 
said to have been little follow-up by the national government on the report's findings. 

80 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
19. 
Observers have noted a strong intergenerational gap in values and norms in PNG. Relationships 
between the generations have historically been quite rigid, with decision-making power consolidated 
with the clan elders.  These relationships are being challenged by recent socioeconomic changes, 
including increased mobility between some geographic areas, urbanization, and the shift away from 
exclusively subsistence agriculture.  

20. 
In some cases, traditional leadership structures have adapted to these changes by becoming more 
flexible, with some senior leaders devolving responsibilities to younger members, especially “Western 
educated” males. In other cases, these roles- such as liaising with foreign companies investing in the 
area- have been assumed by the young men or ascribed by the private companies, by virtue of the fact 
that they speak English, but without the consent or approval of traditional leaders.   

21. 
Commentators have noted however, that younger leaders, operating outside of the traditional 
cultural codes of conflict and lacking in the oratory skills traditionally used in conflict negotiation, are 
more likely to revert to violent methods of dispute resolution. The strong social imperative for young 
people to use firearms as a way of enhancing social-status, may also be a contributory factor in the resort 
to violence outside of the dictates of the conflict system.  

22. 
The fact that younger people feel less bound to traditional codes of behavior often brings them 
into conflict with their elders (see also the section on land disputes). The authority of elders is being 
challenged, with physical injury and sometimes death inflicted on them by dissenting young men. The 
entrance of young migrants into areas with resource projects, for example, has been linked to increased 
social conflict as they do not operate within a clan structure in their new environments, and as such fall 
outside the mechanisms for maintaining social order.24  

23. Many urban areas in PNG are also seeing the emergence of raskol, or criminal, gangs comprised 
primarily of youth. As noted in the Urban Youth Employment Project Social Assessment, the growth of 
these gangs has to do, in part, with the disconnection of youth from traditional social support systems. 
Removed from their clans, youth are no longer subject to the clan-regulated social norms that would 
govern their behavior and tie them to other clan members, contributing to a sense of disenfranchisement 
and alienation. 

VI. PNG’s institutions – both customary and the formal – are unable to effectively manage the 
stresses that have arisen from social and economic changes. 

24. 
The effectiveness of customary institutions is being challenged by the social and economic 
changes being experienced in the country, while state institutions as yet do not play a significant role in 
the day-to-day lives of people in PNG. 25 In many areas of PNG, state institutions are virtually absent. 
The expansive territory, rugged terrain and limited infrastructure mean that entire geographic areas exist 
outside the physical reach of the state. In some districts, the state has been unable to maintain a 
continuous presence due to ongoing conflict. These factors contribute to a very limited trust in the state 
and its capacity to mediate across different groups. 

25. Many communities, particularly in rural areas, rely on traditional systems of governance and 
support- such as the leadership of clan elders, mediation of disputes by interested parties and wantoks in 
the exchange of goods and social services.  Recent changes in societies in PNG have placed some 

24 They have also been accused of bringing gambling, drinking and prostitution to these local areas. 
25 There is no history of formal, centralized organization of societies in PNG prior to European contact. This lack of experience 
with a centralized structure, it is argued, results in a disregard for the modern state.

aspects of these traditional systems under stress. Disputes, for example, have become less amenable to 
management by traditional means. Economic and social changes brought on by a growing population, 
rapid urbanization, and the growth of a cash economy are contributing to increased tensions between 
groups as traditional systems are not able to manage the impacts- in particular the increasing demands 
for higher-levels of compensation and never-ending cycles of pay-back fighting.  The increased use of 
automatic weapons results in many deaths and much destruction of property in a short time span, and the 
pig culture and small cash incomes cannot generate enough wealth to pay inflated compensation claims 
that ensue.  Further, while in the past, conflict sprang from the community level or ‘bottom-up’, many 
conflicts are now triggered from the ‘top-down’, being politically motivated and manipulated, rendering 
traditional conflict resolution methods far less effective in managing them.   

26. 
The formal institutions charged with providing governance and justice services in PNG are 
weak, in large part because they lack cultural relevancy. Compared with traditional systems of 
governance and leadership whereby the status of the ‘big-man’ is achieved over many years and 
constantly contested, the formal political system provides very little transparency and accountability 
beyond the election of a representative. As another example, the imprisonment of those who break the 
law is often seen as ineffective in securing the rule of law in the country. Incarceration does not act as a 
strong deterrent for would be criminals, as this form of sanction has no basis in the cultures found in 
PNG and doesn’t serve to disrupt the incentives, for example the cultural imperatives and sanctions, to 
engage in violent, or what are considered criminal, actions.  

27. 
There are however some forms of indigenous governance mechanisms that still have potential 
relevance such as the older kiap system and village courts.. The former reinforced the traditional 
leadership system, acting as an arbitrator in disputes, and the latter addressed family and criminal matters 
at the local level in place of the state.  

VII. Addressing the Drivers 

28. 
Drawing on this analysis, the following orientations are offered as possibilities in addressing the 
drivers of fragility in PNG. These are intended to inform a conversation with stakeholders in PNG and 
with other donors that, ultimately, aims to improve the effectiveness of the World Bank’s engagement in 
the country. 

29. 
It is suggested that the CMU consider the following three overarching themes to be 
mainstreamed across the portfolio. 

1. Acknowledge and respond to the social fragmentation in PNG by increasing Bank and GoPNG 
capacity to mediate across different groups.  

30. 
The intense divisions across the many social groups in PNG and the lack of a cohesive common 
identity point to the need for the Bank to support mechanisms that build trust and confidence both across 
groups and between these groups and the state. Specific measures could include: 

• Assessing, at the country level, the reach of conflict redress and resolution measures across the Bank 
portfolio.  It would be useful to assess which projects have embedded these mechanisms and how, 
and to identify opportunities for expanding these. 
Integrating conflict resolution and redress mechanisms into Bank operations.  These could include 
supporting conflict resolution mechanisms in Bank-led road transport and agriculture projects. These 
should especially be considered for any Bank support to natural resource projects. Progress could be 
monitored by tracking the number and type of ‘cases’ brought for resolution, and level of satisfaction 

• 

82 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the outcomes. Here the project teams could draw on Bank experience with mechanisms for 
intra-community cooperation used in CDD projects, such as PNPM in Indonesia.  The Bank may 
also want to consider including training for ‘mediators’ in different projects, who can interface 
between project teams and communities. 
• Building the capacity of the GoPNG to communicate clearly with different social groups in their 
languages (especially Tok Pisin) and in a culturally relevant manner. This support could be provided 
at different levels of government, so that citizens understand the procedures for budgeting, planning, 
monitoring and other functions.  
• Strengthening training in conflict competence within the life-skills component of the UYEP 
(component 2). These could be designed so as to help heal the bruised relationships with elders, by 
bringing in the experience of elders and facilitating dialogue between generations as part of the 
trainings.  
• Considering a stand-alone Bank project to increase the capacity of the state to mediate across 
different groups in society. This may need to commence with AAA to understand the strengths and 
weaknesses in the design and functioning of existing institutions to encourage cooperation, tolerance 
and conflict resolution across groups. This could include analysis of customary and formal 
institutions, as well as hybrid institutions such as the village courts. Based on this analysis, pilots or 
project components could be developed to focus on institutions in key sectors, such as agriculture or 
mining, where conflicts across groups are common. 
• Mapping violence and reconciliation across groups in PNG in order to better monitor these dynamics 
and address them in the country portfolio. It would be important to understand the horizontal 
inequalities between different social groups, and the perceptions of injustice that attach to these, in 
order to get a clear picture of the dynamics at play. Key indicators to track could include: resource 
distribution across different groups; concentration of resources and/or conflict in different 
geographic regions; interplay of conflict with development projects, and others. 
• Considering indicators within the planned risk filter that monitor social fragmentation and Bank 
efforts to address this. For this, it would be important to monitor inequalities and perceptions of 
injustice between ethnic groups, generational groups and genders.  This would obviously be difficult 
to attribute to the Bank’s work, but is nonetheless important to track regularly.  
2. Address conflicts over land and resource allocation. 

31. 
Conflicts between and within clans related to land use and resource allocation are threatening 
social cohesion. The Bank could address these rifts by:  

• Supporting efforts to strengthen the capacity of the GoPNG to deal with increasing competition over 
land. One alternative for this could be encouraging other donor’s support for the Land Courts at the 
village level, and then linking Bank projects in agriculture to these.  
• Encouraging greater transparency in natural resource concessions, and land leasing. The Bank can 
use its lead role in the agriculture sector to encourage greater transparency and public oversight of 
leasing arrangements to help address disputes over land.   
• Monitoring citizen perceptions of state transparency and accountability in resource allocation.  This 
could be done by prioritizing efforts to monitor the perceptions of state transparency around service 
delivery, accountability, and other outcomes. 

3. Consider mechanisms to address social divides between men and women, and between 
generations.  

83 

 
 
 
 
 
32. 
The World Bank has included concerns over generational conflict and gender inequality as an 
important part of its engagement in PNG. This focus could be strengthened further by helping to 
transform the relationships that contribute to these inequalities through the following: 

• Better understanding the role of youth in PNG, in order to increase opportunities for youth and heal 
generational divides.  The UYEP Social Assessment is useful background. The analysis presented in 
the present brief suggests that youth are taking on leadership roles in some cases, and that youth with 
particular skills (especially English language) are being privileged in access to some economic 
opportunities, but lack the social skills that would enable them to play these roles in ways that 
contribute to increased social cohesion. At the same time, youth are becoming disconnected from the 
social norms that regulated the behavior of their parents and grandparents, deepening a rift between 
the generations. Youth also seem to be struggling to access employment opportunities in urban areas, 
particularly when preference for jobs goes to elders or particular clans. Further analysis is needed to 
understand these dynamics of exclusion, access, and relationships between the generations.  
• Considering specific measures to build the conflict resolution skills of youth in ways that heal 
generational divides. 
• Considering ways to connect youth to the state in ways that improve the state-society relationship. In 
other contexts, civil service reform as been important in this regard (ie South Africa, India).  
Integrating mechanisms that remove obstacles to women’s participation in economic and social life, 
and that help to level the playing field for women. It is important to understand how social and 
economic changes are affecting gender relationships, in order to mitigate risks that come from this. 
For example, current projects to increase women’s role in the private sector (such as the WIM 
initiative) could include a stronger focus on the enabling environment for women, and how to 
improve this.  The CPS envisions designing projects where women will benefit, and it will also be 
important to understand the challenges this poses to the rigid gender relationships in PNG, in order 
to better mitigate these.  It will also be important to ensure that gender-disaggregated monitoring 
indicators are included to the extent possible. 
• Designing indicators for the planned risk filter that incorporate a gender focus.  These could include 
indicators of incidence of domestic violence and gender-based violence, and indicators to monitor 
the response of the state to women’s needs and concerns.

Risk Review for WBG Papua New Guinea CPS, and Retrospective Assessment of 2008 CAS 

Approaching the strategy development and dialogue process for the WBG in Papua New Guinea in 2012 
requires a more holistic and yet also more granular consideration of risk.  The country is on the brink of 
structural economic transformation, benefitting from unprecedented levels of new FDI yet still very 
extractives-dependent, gaining significant benefits from a much-expanded IFC program and re-gaining 
access to IBRD to complement IDA, confronting a young, diverse, and increasingly vocal spectrum of 
stakeholders steadily improving in their ability to unite and confront the government.  This means the 
challenges go far beyond managing technocratic risks in maintaining macro-fiscal discipline and making 
‘systems’ improvements in service delivery and public sector governance; thus, the IFC-Bank Country 
Team has chosen to consider risks differently: 

• 

• Discuss risks much further upstream in the strategy process (rather than treating them as a residual to 
be addressed after the program is designed)  
• Consider risks in a longer-term historical context (rather than treating each strategy document as a 
tabula rasa with little explicit connection between the analysis of lessons learned in the previous 
CAS and the analysis of risks in the upcoming CAS) 
Inform the risks discussion in a more granular way that uses a more diverse set of evidence and data 
(from inside and outside of the WBG, and from public and private sector sources), and connects the 
current ‘diagnosis’ with a retrospective assessment of how previous risk analyses ‘performed’ when 
seen ex post facto 
• Construct a risk filter that explicitly does not encourage risk aversion but rather encourages 
calibration and mitigation of risks; we will ask “Which high-impact interventions are most amenable 
to risk mitigation?” rather than asking “what are the least risky interventions?” 
The WBG Context for Talking about RISK:  most World Bank Group documents identify the 
following 'types' or 'sources' of risk:   

• Risks to Achieving Results – risk to development effectiveness = not achieving PDO  
• Reputational Risks – risks of acting or not acting, risk of being blamed (for action or inaction), risks 
of be(com)ing irrelevant 
• Country Risks - risks persistent across all efforts in a country: economic risks, political risks, credit 
risks, etc.  
− may be some combination of legacy (‘their’ history influences ‘our’ current views) and negative 
synergy (risks that surface in one sector increase perception of risks in another) 
is often captured in a category/label or country ‘flag’ 
the “label effect” persists even when label is removed (PNG has not been listed as ‘fragile’ for 
3+ years, has never been late on an IBRD or IDA loan payment, but is thought of as ‘difficult’ 
because of GoPNG and WBG leadership interactions a decade ago) 
Institutional Risks – weaknesses in implementing partner or government agency  
− Q- is risk the ‘dark side’ of capacity building, or the manifestation of incomplete institutional 
development? 
• Fiduciary Risks – potential for corruption or financial mismanagement, procurement practices that 
don’t get ‘value for money, or poor handling of environmental and social safeguard issues

Exogenous risks stem primarily from the potential damage 
from adverse commodity price movements and natural 
disasters.  

Continued weak macroeconomic 
management and poor economic governance, 
leading to further deterioration of fiscal 
situation and possible financial sector crisis. 
Failure to meet targets of macroeconomic 
stabilization program, resulting in significant 
delays in structural policy reforms. 

Endogenous risk is increased political jockeying within ruling 
coalition will erode nascent support base for reform and 
distract govt from focusing on priority policy issues, and/or 
erode fiscal discipline and lead to reversal of recent gains.  

Main country risk is chronic political and economic 
uncertainty over the medium-term, and continued poor 
governance. 

Natural disasters may cause significant economic 
disruption and social dislocation.  

Global financial/economic crisis affects export prices, 
diaspora employment, financial institutions 
A fall in commodity prices may trigger a rapid decline in 
economic performance.

inflation and XR appreciation, skills shortages; accelerated 

urbanization NOTE:  the unanticipated risk associated w/ 
PNGLNG is the monolithic scale, not the ‘standard’ extractives risks 
which were already on our radar 

Political conflict may lead to a serious decline in the 
governance environment.  

Growing unemployment, especially among urban youth, 
may lead to increased violence and criminal activity, and to 
deteriorating social stability.  

Further worsening of law and order problems 
Worsening of systemic issues affecting 
project implementation 

The main risks to implementation of the interim strategy are 
threefold:  
− Relationship risk arising from deterioration in the quality 
of dialogue with the Government on governance and 
portfolio-related issues. 

Lack of ownership of public expenditure and governance 
reform and lack of support for national oversight agencies 
may stall the progress of CAS implementation.  

− Coordination among development partners remains 
weak, due to differing institutional imperatives, thus 
limiting the World Bank’s effectiveness and leverage.  

Efforts to promote closer coordination between the 
Government and development partners may not be 
successful.  

− Ongoing implementation risks posed by systemic 
portfolio problems, including availability of counterpart 
funds and poor financial management, combined with 
potential risk of corruption in loan and grant portfolio. 

Weaknesses in public fiduciary systems may impede 
project implementation.  

The Bank’s engagement will either be too short-lived or too 
small-scale to affect governance in long term.

TABLE B:  RETROSPECTIVE VALIDATION OF 2008 CAS ASSESSMENT 
OF RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES 

Risks Assessed in 2008 
Mitigation Measures Proposed in 2008 
Country Risks as assessed in 2008 
Political conflict may lead to a 
The CAS will aim to mitigate this risk by focusing

governance environment.  
the use of extractive industry revenues, the 
institutional strengthening of key oversight 
agencies, and community-driven development 
approaches that emphasize good governance. In 
order to build coalitions for improved governance, 
the CAS will also support dialogue among key 
stakeholders, including national and sub-national 
government, the private sector, civil society, and 
development partners. 

Retrospective Validation of events 2008-2012 

This risk did eventuate, albeit late in the CAS period.  “Usual” pre-election political 
maneuvering intersected with generational leadership conflict, and by late 2011 
generated increasing tensions between branches of government and the population.  
The resulting dynamics generated threats to governance (actions proposed and/or taken 
to challenge independence of judiciary and oversight institutions) but a multi-stakeholder 
movement pushed back with effective challenges and a forceful demand for 
accountability, and several anti-governance actions were peacefully reversed.  Not all 
government initiatives were negative, with a modest reform momentum in Cabinet 
resulting in concrete actions.   

CAS actions linked to extractives transparency (including outreach to all stakeholders) 
were useful contributors to mitigating the risks, but CAS actions linked to oversight 
agencies and to CDD were not undertaken. 

A fall in commodity prices may 
trigger a rapid decline in 
economic performance.  

The CAS will support the steady accumulation of 
reserves and the reduction of public debt, as well 
as promote the wise and effective use of public 
resources, and intensify efforts to diversify the 
economy. 

Commodity prices did fall briefly but overall they rose throughout the CAS period; the 
primary challenge was increased volatility.  Government pursued all macro-fiscal 
measures encouraged in the CAS which in turn buffered the country from the global 
economic crisis.  Bank efforts supported those macro-fiscal policies and increasingly 
focused on investments that could help in diversifying the economy, and 2010-2011 data 
shows non-minerals growth (in %) outstripping minerals (albeit started from a low base). 

BLACK SWAN 

Unmentioned in the CAS was the significant two-tailed risk of a single massive minerals 
investment project promising transformational gains in national income and potential 
upstream and downstream employment, consuming huge political and financial capital 
of Government, causing structural shifts in employment and local markets, fueling 
inflation and exchange rate appreciation, and driving unrealistic expectations:  PNGLNG. 

The Bank reacted nimbly to this, shifting the focus of our macro-fiscal dialogue onto 
managing minerals-induced volatility immediately after the Final Investment Decision 
was made, and focusing intensive staff time and TF resources on those issues. 

87 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks Assessed in 2008 
Growing unemployment, 
especially among urban youth, 
may lead to increased 
violence and criminal activity, 
and to deteriorating social 
stability.  

Mitigation Measures Proposed in 2008 
The CAS will support the articulation of a Youth 
Integration Strategy designed to create productive 
employment opportunities for youth at risk, 
especially in urban areas, and to create ways of 
fostering their social and political inclusion in 
community and political affairs. 

Retrospective Validation of events 2008-2012 
This risk manifest in a broader way (beyond youth although they were an important 
component) as a general dissatisfaction with perceived growing inequality and lack of 
delivery on expected windfall benefits from extractives projects Mitigation actions were 
less strategic than envisioned in the CAS, focusing on one single investment project 
which would pilot an approach to youth employment but without much policy dialogue 
and with no clear path to link hoped-for UYEP ‘success’ to broader national champions. 

Natural disasters may cause 
significant economic disruption 
and social dislocation.  

The CAS attempts to mitigate this risk by 
supporting the development of a climate change 
strategy and PNG’s participation in regional 
disaster risk reduction initiatives, while also 
promoting responsible and sustainable natural 
resource management practices. 

Only a modest manifestation of risks, with significant difficulty in advancing broad 
consensus on climate change and mitigation/REDD strategies, but Bank efforts to link 
PNG to resources and regional initiatives on disaster risk reduction gained more traction 
than expected and is evolving into a robust element in the grant portfolio. 

Implementation Risks as assessed in 2008 

Lack of ownership of public 
expenditure and governance 
reform and lack of support for 
national oversight agencies 
may stall the progress of CAS 
implementation.  

The CAS attempts to mitigate this risk by 
supporting efforts to build broad-based 
constituencies for change, reaching out to civil 
society and the media by helping them access 
information for monitoring and evaluation. In 
addition, the SIAO program will support the 
capacity of PNG’s oversight institutions to carry 
out their functions effectively and to communicate 
with citizens about their work. 

This risk fully manifest with only minor movements towards reform opening up late in 
the CAS period’ the CAS mitigation measures were largely unexploited, as SAIO was 
cancelled after the Concept Review meeting.  An entirely different approach emerged, 
however, which allowed the Bank to use the steady improvement in macro dialogue as a 
opening to frame the need for PFM reform as a “service delivery issue”; by the end of 
the CAS period, the Bank had been invited to lead a Sectoral PER in Education, the 
single largest budget line item, representing a significant upscaling of engagement on 
public expenditure aspects of governance. 

The Bank’s engagement will 
either be too short-lived or too 
small-scale to affect 
governance over the long 
term.  

The CAS only intends to take a first step in 
dealing with complex socio-political issues of this 
kind. Over time, and with persistence and 
consistent engagement, the Bank expects to be 
able to assist significantly in spite of its limited 
financial capacity in PNG. 

This risk did not eventuate, even in the face of significant increases in scale from the 
two larger donors (Australia and the ADB); mitigation consisted of the CMU’s active 
use of the CAS ‘statement of principles’ from which to make credible commitments to a 
steadily increasing portfolio and significant BB-funded AAA delivered in response to 
specific client demands with an emphasis on modest “just in time” non-lending TA. 

88 

 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks Assessed in 2008 
Weaknesses in public 
fiduciary systems may impede 
project implementation.  

Mitigation Measures Proposed in 2008 
Through the PERR and CPAR processes, the 
CAS will attempt to reduce this risk by 
strengthening GoPNG’s capacity to implement 
effective, transparent procurement, and to apply 
and monitor procurement and fiduciary guidelines 
systematically. 

Retrospective Validation of events 2008-2012 
These risks manifest repeatedly over the CAS period, with some anecdotal evidence 
of deterioration from an already low base in procurement.  Neither of the processes 
suggested in the CAS as mitigation measures were functional, with the PERR closed 
down in 2009 and the CPAR follow-up stymied by a lack of reform appetite on the part of 
the Central Supply and Tenders Board.  The Bank continues to nurture consensus 
amongst key donors on the conditions which would allow for a united and serious 
procurement reform effort. 

Efforts to promote closer 
coordination between the 
Government and development 
partners may not be 
successful.  

The CAS will attempt to mitigate this risk by a 
more straightforward, transparent approach to 
communicating the Bank Group’s views and 
intentions, and by giving greater attention to 
consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. 

This risk manifest mostly in a continued weakening of GoPNG leadership in 
coordination, but ‘shadow coordination’ amongst donors has improved and is 
succeeding at sectoral levels in fostering slight positive movements in government 
leadership.  The CAS mitigation measures have been widely employed by the Bank 
and are judged as very effective.

As a Blend client eligible for IBRD financing in addition to the IDA 16 allocation, Papua New Guinea will be considering the range of products 
shown in the table below as potential mechanisms to help finance strategic investments.  Initial discussions for use of IBRD have focused on 
transformational infrastructure that removes empirically-identified bottlenecks to more inclusive and broad-based growth and better service 
delivery, such as renewable energy.  There are a wide range of IFC products that could be considered, as can MIGA’s risk coverage products.

Development Partners’ Matrix of Activity (Donor Mapping) 

• 

Net flows to PNG currently average slightly over US$910m per annum, close to 10 percent of GDP or $130 per capita. 
• Australia is Papua New Guinea’s largest partner, providing annual assistance close to A$500m. The framework for Australian cooperation is 
set out in the Partnership for Development, focused strategically on four pillars: primary health, education, transport infrastructure, and law 
and justice. Australia’s whole-of-government program includes support to public finance management and to improved national statistics. 
• The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has had a long-term engagement in Papua New Guinea, based around an integrated program of 
analytical work and investments.  The ADB Country Operations Business Plan for 2013-2015 outlines a program focusing on infrastructure 
(transport, power, water/sanitation), state enterprise reform, trade and PFM, microfinance, and health. The ADF allocation is US$168.9m 
and Ordinary Capital Resources total US$205m, complemented by US$3.25m in preparatory technical assistance. 
• The European Commission’s country strategy for the period of 2008 to 2013 sets out a framework for engagement with PNG under the 10th 
European Development Fund.  A maximum of €130m (US$157m) available during this period, with a focus on rural economic development 
and human resources development (basic education and vocational training). 
Japan’s assistance varies from year to year, totaling US$131m in 2009.  Papua New Guinea benefits from grants, people-to-people 
exchanges and scholarships, and the program covers three priority areas: infrastructure and investment environment; education and health 
human resources; and environmental conservation and climate change mitigation/adaptation. 
• New Zealand, under the Joint Commitment for Development with PNG, provides approximately NZ$35m ($28m) per annum, with a focus 
on agriculture, electrification, basic health, scholarships and training, and a safer and more stable Bougainville.   
• China is an important partner with an active program of grant aid, concessional loans, and personnel training for PNG nationals, covering 
agriculture, engineering construction, industry and telecommunication, and sports and education, with a strong focus on infrastructure. 
• United States (US) is increasing its support for Papua New Guinea, both through bilateral and regional programs; two primary areas of 
support are climate change adaptation and community resilience, and HIV/AIDs, with a supplementary focus on strengthening governance 
and reducing gender-based violence.  Support will average US$8-10m per year. 
• The United Nations (UN) system is active, working strategically as a “Delivering as One” self-starter under a multi-agency 2012-2015 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework (including 15 UN agencies) covering four clusters: governance for equitable 
development; access to basic services; social justice, protection and gender equality; and environment and disaster risk management, within 
a resource envelope of US$190m. 
• The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) provides US$14m equivalent in co-financing for the World Bank Productive 
Partnerships in Agriculture Project.   
• Churches and nongovernmental groups play an especially important role in providing services in rural parts of Papua New Guinea, 
particularly in primary and curative health, education (including early childhood readiness for school), and social protection.
