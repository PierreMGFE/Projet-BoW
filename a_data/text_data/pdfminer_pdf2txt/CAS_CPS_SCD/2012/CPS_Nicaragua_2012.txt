Executive Summary 

1. 
Nicaragua is the poorest country in Central America with a GNI per capita of 
US$1,510.  Decades of civil conflict and a series of catastrophic natural disasters have left the 
country behind most of its neighbors in terms of economic and social indicators.  The poverty 
headcount stands at 42 percent and one in seven Nicaraguans lives in extreme poverty.  Most of 
the poor live in the rural areas; many in remote communities where the access to basic services is 
still constrained by very limited infrastructure.  The country also ranks among the most 
vulnerable in terms of natural disasters and extreme climate.  Interestingly, however, Nicaragua 
has not been as plagued by the same levels of violence as some of its Central American 
neighbors: homicide rates are the lowest in the sub-region. 

2. 
Over the last decade or so, major progress has been made in improving service 
delivery to the poorest and results are beginning to show.  Public expenditures in 
infrastructure and reforms in social service delivery have been targeted toward rural areas and 
poorer households.  Poverty reduction accelerated in the last five years, inequality has fallen and 
social indicators are showing steady improvements.  However, while a significant number of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are on track to be achieved, rural-urban disparities 
remain stark and other key human development indicators, such as educational attainment are 
still very low.  

3. 
Sound macroeconomic policies have also allowed for moderate and steady economic 
growth, but increasing productivity is needed to accelerate convergence in income levels 
with the rest of the region.  Nicaragua has maintained disciplined macroeconomic policies 
since 2001 underpinning average growth rates of around 3.5 percent and a strong rebound from 
recent crises.  Despite these positive trends, however, the country remains quite vulnerable to 
external shocks and to natural disasters.  More recently, exports and FDI have picked up but the 
underlying productivity has not improved and is limiting the country’s overall competitiveness. 

4. 
The Government’s current National Plan for Human Development (2007-2012) 
gives priority towards pro-poor delivery of basic social services and infrastructure, 
particularly in rural areas.  Implementation has yielded some critical innovations, notably in 
social service delivery and rural infrastructure that are showing promising results.  More 
recently, there has been a renewed emphasis on the need to stimulate investment and to improve 
productivity, particularly in export-oriented sectors.  This shift is likely to be reflected in the 
ongoing revision to the National Human Development Plan (PNDH).   

5. 
Even with limited resources, the Bank Group has supported important advances in 
Nicaragua.  Implementation of the last CPS saw IDA consolidate lending around a core set of 
well-performing investment programs focused on rural infrastructure and social services while 
IFC accelerated growth in its Nicaragua portfolio, including in key export sectors.  Key lessons 
include the strategic value of Bank Group engagements in helping Nicaragua to mobilize 
resources from other development partners and from the private sector, as well as the need to 
maintain flexibility to respond to emerging challenges in a country buffeted by external shocks 
and natural events. 

i 

 
 
6. 
Against this backdrop, the proposed WBG continues to focus on improving the 
delivery of basic services, and adds an emphasis on strengthening competitiveness as a 
means to accelerate growth in incomes.  Under the first, the objective is to raise welfare by 
improving access to quality basic services.  The IDA lending program will help Nicaragua to 
scale up new models of service delivery in health, education, social protection and water and 
sanitation, particularly in areas where Nicaragua faces significant challenges to achieve the 
remaining MDGs.  The second strategic objective is to raise incomes by enhancing 
competitiveness and diversifying exports.  Under this objective, the CPS program seeks to 
deepen the impact of current programs in rural infrastructure, land and SME administration by 
adding a focus on productivity, and through greater synergies with IFC and MIGA engagements 
in agribusiness, and in the energy and financial sectors.  The CPS will continue mainstreaming 
attention to gender and indigenous peoples, disaster risk mitigation and climate adaptation.  

7. 
The CPS program will leverage the full bundle of WBG services to complement IDA 
resources and help mobilize other development financing. The key principles of engagement 
involve maintaining Nicaragua’s very strong record on project implementation, building scalable 
programs that can attract additional resources, and leveraging the full breadth of WBG 
instruments by coordinating IDA, IFC and MIGA interventions.  The Government has agreed to 
a lending program of one or two new investment projects a year with remaining resources 
reserved to scale up successful ongoing projects and for emerging challenges. Investment 
lending would be complemented with a strong program of knowledge services, as well as 
support to mobilize additional resources (e.g. from global programs, trust funds, public private 
partnerships).    

8. 
The CPS program is complemented by a series of regional initiatives that address the 
citizen security agenda, support a greater economic integration through trade facilitation, and aim 
to reduce disaster risks across Central America.    

9. 
The Bank will coordinate with IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB) in supporting policy reforms.  Although expectations of an ambitious reform agenda on 
governance are low at this time, the CPS program will renew its emphasis on transparency and 
monitoring and evaluation.  More joint Government and Bank dissemination of good program 
results and analytical work to stakeholders, including civil society and local academia, may 
provide an opportunity to build a more substantive governance agenda over the medium term.  A 
strong monitoring and evaluation system will be a prerequisite for anchoring a more determined 
transparency effort, and to support mobilization of resources.   

10. 
Risks to the implementation of the CPS program are considered relatively 
moderate.  Political risk is mitigated in part by the alignment of the CPS period with the 
political cycle in Nicaragua.  While political polarization could encumber the pace of policy 
reform, an improving government dialogue with the private sector has strengthened the outlook 
for consensus building.  A potential economic crisis in Europe, a further slowdown in the US 
economy or a sudden stop in support from Venezuela would create challenges for program 
implementation. The Bank will coordinate with the IMF and the IDB to encourage Nicaragua to 
create necessary buffers, and will maintain flexibility in the IDA program to respond to emerging 
challenges.  The Government has also agreed to introduce the new IDA Immediate Response 
Mechanism (IRM) into the portfolio to mitigate the persistent risk from natural disasters.

I. 

Introduction 

1. 
Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Latin America with a GNI per capita of 
US$1,510 in 2011.  Approximately 42.5 percent of the population still lives below the poverty 
line and one out of every seven Nicaraguans lives in extreme poverty. The country is particularly 
vulnerable to adverse natural events which threaten development gains.   

2. 
A number of macroeconomic reforms and stabilization policies undertaken during 
the 1990s paved the way for improved economic performance over the last decade.  
Moderate growth over the past decade of roughly 3.2 percent per annum has translated into some 
improvements in poverty rates, particularly in rural areas. The current Government has placed a 
strong emphasis on delivering services to the most vulnerable population, and is focusing its 
second term on reducing poverty by deepening rural services, creating job opportunities, and 
promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports. Within this objective there is a renewed 
attention on improving productivity. 

3. 
The country has had a stronger economic recovery following the global economic 
crisis than its Central American neighbors.  The country’s growth rate in 2011 was the highest 
in a decade at 5.1 percent, and FDI and trade are both improving at good rates.  Prudent 
macroeconomic management and favorable export prices have helped support the economic 
recovery. Meanwhile employment has kept pace with population dynamics, but been dominated 
by low income and informal jobs.  The challenge over the longer term is to sustain higher growth 
rates to accelerate poverty reduction. This will require not only improving the efficiency of 
public spending and improving the effectiveness of the state, but jumpstarting improvements in 
productivity that can translate over time into higher income growth across the population.  

4. 
The Government and the World Bank Group (WBG) have agreed on a five year 
program of engagement, designed in close coordination with the IDB and IMF, to support 
Nicaragua in achieving its key development goals. The proposed Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) for FY13-17 supports government priorities in two key areas of engagement: (i) raising 
welfare by improving access to quality basic services; and (ii) raising incomes by improving 
productivity and enhancing competitiveness. 
 The transversal themes of disaster risk 
management, gender and transparency are mainstreamed throughout the CPS program to 
enhance the sustainability of program outcomes.  This CPS has been prepared jointly with the 
IFC and MIGA, with the objective of leveraging each group’s comparative advantage and 
expanding the suite of instruments available to support Nicaragua.  Finally, the strategy has been 
prepared in close coordination with the IDB and the IMF, and reflects an intention to collaborate 
more intensely in areas of policy dialogue which are critical to the development agenda as well 
as to improve the efficiency of development assistance. 

II. Country Context 
Political Context 
5. 
Nicaragua continues to be characterized by high levels of political polarization, but 
also a broadening consensus around macroeconomic policies. In November 2011, the current 
President and Administration were re-elected for a five year term, with a parliamentary majority.  

1 

 
 
While the political opposition has not been able to consolidate around a unified platform, control 
of both the executive and legislature has not yielded the expected stability in government sector 
policy-making.  Indeed, competing demands within the ruling party constituencies have begun to 
surface.  Outside government, Nicaragua has seen continued development of civil society and 
other groups calling for improved governance. As such, the Government is also likely to face 
greater scrutiny and demand for enhanced transparency in the use of public resources and about 
its programs in general.   

6. 
In contrast, the Government’s relationship with the private sector has been 
improving, and provides a space for more open and constructive debate on economic 
strategy.  This includes a broad based consensus on the need to maintain macroeconomic 
stability, the promotion of both private domestic and foreign investment, and on the need to 
address lagging productivity and export competitiveness.  Municipal elections will take place in 
November 2012, raising issues related to electoral processes, but there seems to be a potential for 
negotiation between political actors on some elements of electoral reform. 

Citizen Security 
7. 
Although Nicaragua is comparatively safe among Central American countries, 
crime rates are increasing and could pose important risks to development. The homicide 
rate per 100,000 inhabitants was 13 in 2010 down from 14 in 2009, and together with Costa 
Rica, is the lowest in the region.  Nicaragua is also the only country in Central America where 
these rates have remained stable over the last 5 years.  In the 2011 Latinobarometer survey, 
Nicaragua is the country where the least number (only 3 percent) of respondents name crime as 
the number one problem versus a regional average of 28 percent.  As such, the country allocates 
relatively fewer resources to security and justice, leaving more room for social spending and 
investment which also contributes to prevention.1 While Nicaragua’s homicide rates are stable, 
crime rates are increasing and the economic costs of crime remain high even by Latin American 
standards.2 There are also future risks related to the movement of drug trafficking routes which 
could negatively affect Nicaragua.3   

Poverty 
8. 
The second half of the last decade brought a notable reduction in poverty and 
inequality, concentrated mostly in rural areas. In contrast to the period 2001-2005 in which 
poverty essentially stayed constant at 48 percent, the country saw a significant reduction in the 
poverty headcount of nearly 6 percentage points (equivalent to around 230,000 fewer poor 
people), reaching a national rate of 42.5 percent in 2009.  Meanwhile, extreme poverty fell from 
17.2 to 14.6 percent between 2005 and 2009.  Poverty remains a largely rural problem.  By 2009, 
more than one in four Nicaraguans that reside in rural parts of the country were unable to meet 

1  
The country spends on average US$2,500 per 100 inhabitants on the security and justice sector, similar to 
Honduras (US$3,700) and Guatemala (US$4,600), which have homicide rates over three times as high, and much 
lower than the average for Central America (US$9,400). 
2  
According to the World Bank Enterprise Survey, the share of firms that consider crime and theft as a major 
constraint to business increased from 18 percent in 2006 to 48 percent in 2010, above the average for LAC (32 %).  
3  
There is much speculation about why Nicaragua seems not be affected by the homicide trend of the region, 
with several potential hypothesis including the success of the community police, and its geographic location (far 
from the Mexican border and a relatively isolated Caribbean coast).

their basic food needs; compared to around 6 out of 100 in urban areas.   The Gini coefficient fell 
for the whole country from 40.5 in 2005 to 37.1 in 2009, and was similar in both urban and rural 
parts of the country.  These results are confirmed in multiple measures based on consumption.

9. 
Recent gains have been largely 
driven 
by 
income 
growth 
and 
improvements in education and access 
to basic services but large gaps remain between urban and rural areas and across income 
groups.   The largest absolute gains in rural income occurred in agriculture, the main source of 
employment and income for poor people and contributed to poverty reduction.  There were 
significant, albeit smaller gains in non-agricultural income among rural poor households. School 
attainment for people 20 years and older increased from 5.7 to 6.2 years during 2005-2009, but 
in 2009, rural individuals still had four years less average schooling than their urban 
counterparts.  For the youngest cohort (23-29 years old), this rural-urban gap has been partially 
closed but substantial differences remain (5.3 versus 7.8 years of schooling).  Likewise, there has 
been notable progress in access to electricity and water services that have been successfully 
targeted at poorer quintiles but large gaps remain (see Figure 3).  

10. 
Indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant populations in the rural Atlantic coast 
regions continue to suffer more severe deprivation. Notwithstanding similar poverty and 
extreme poverty headcounts to the Central rural regions, the social and basic service indicators in 
the rural Atlantic remain dramatically lower, in part due to the remoteness of many communities 
that are still only accessible by water.   

11. 
Nicaragua remains vulnerable to food price increases. Given that poverty is 
widespread in Nicaragua and the poor spend a large share of their budget on food, rising food 
prices would present a threat to the nutrition and livelihoods of large segments of the population.  
It is estimated that during the 2008 period of sharply rising food prices more than 90 percent of 
households were worse off as a result of the increases and that food prices pushed poverty - 
especially in urban areas – upwards by more than 4 percentage points.

Recent Economic Developments 
12. 
Nicaragua entered the global economic crisis from a position of relative strength. 
Economic growth in the past decade was positive, averaging 3.2 percent, in line with the regional 
average. More importantly, economic growth has been positive every year during this period, 
except for 2009 where the economy contracted 1.4 percent due to the international economic 
crisis. Nevertheless, these trends have not been strong enough to compensate for the earlier 
collapse of the 1980s and early 1990s. Growth has been partially driven by an expansion in 
exports, which grew at an average rate of 11 percent in the decade and currently represent 43 
percent of GDP, up from 15 percent in 2000. The free trade agreement signed in 2005 between 
Central American countries, Dominican Republic and the United States (DR-CAFTA) played an 
important role. Exports to the US (Nicaragua’s biggest trade partner) have more than doubled 
since its implementation. More recently, Venezuela has also gained in importance and represents 
the second highest export destination. 

13. 
Since 2001 the country has maintained disciplined macroeconomic policies and has 
succeeded in increasing fiscal revenues. There has been a consolidation of the fiscal position 
through several tax reforms that raised tax revenues from 11 percent in 2001 to 15.2 percent in 
2008 of GDP. Furthermore, in 2009 the Ministry of Finance introduced a fiscal reform bill in 
order to tackle the slide in revenues triggered by the economic slowdown and the decline in aid 
from abroad. The bill’s main objectives were to make the tax system more equitable, to 
generalize the levying of taxes and to modernize and simplify tax payment procedures. As a 
result, the balance in the central government (after donations) has improved, posting a 0.5 
percent surplus in 2011, and spending has been reoriented to place greater emphasis on poverty 
interventions.  

14. 
Fiscal consolidation efforts, combined with benefits from the HIPC and MDRI 
initiative, have improved the country’s debt outlook.  Nicaragua has benefited from the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative and Multilateral Debt Relieve Initiative 
(MDRI) which helped reduce the country’s public and external debt-to GDP ratio from roughly 
400 for both in 1994 to 62 and 83 percent, respectively in 2007. These initiatives have helped 
relieve the economy from one of its major constraints to growth as the high debt burden was 
forcing the country to pay debt services equivalent to roughly 7 percent of GDP. Combined, 
4 

 
 
these initiatives helped relieve US$1.1 billion in IDA debt and charges, more than two times the 
current outstanding debt. Since then, public debt has continued to decrease – although at a slower 
pace – and is currently 57.7 percent of GDP.

Impact of the of the 2008-2009 global crisis and economic recovery 
15. 
The economy was hit hard by the food, fuel and financial crises, as well as other 
natural disasters, but has been able to recover its pre-crisis trend.  The primary transmission 
channels of the crisis were a shrinking FDI, weaker external demand and decrease in the flow of 
remittances. Investment plunged 20 percent of GDP due to a collapse of credit and FDI and to a 
contraction in the construction sector, while consumption decreased moderately following a drop 
in remittance flows.  Reduced external demand, weather issues, including shifting rainfall 
patterns due to El Niño, and a low-point in the two-year coffee cycle all had a negative impact on 
exports which fell by 5.5 percent in 2009. However, imports fell at an even faster pace (19.2 
percent) driven by weaker internal demand and lower oil prices (oil imports represent 14 percent 

5 

 
 
      
      
      
      
      
of GDP). As a result, the trade balance improved and the current account deficit fell almost 9 
percentage points (10.3 percent of GDP in 2009). 

16. 
The fiscal and financial sectors remained resilient to the crisis. During the 2008-2009 
crisis, the Government implemented some countercyclical measures to mitigate the social 
impacts of the recession (mainly through current transfers), which boosted expenditures by 1 
percentage point of GDP to 18 percent of GDP. Revenues remained stable at around 15 percent 
of the GDP, but grants fell, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit of the central government 
(after donations) to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2009. As a result, Nicaragua’s fiscal performance in 
2009 was better than most countries in the region. The financial system also weathered the crisis 
without much difficulty. The banks’ capital adequacy ratio stayed well above regulatory Tier 1 
ratios and liquidity buffers remained high on average.  

17. 
Despite the general elections in 2011, fiscal accounts remained strong in the post 
crisis, but there are concerns associated with contingent liabilities. An increase in tax 
revenues of almost 2 percentage points of GDP in the post crisis and partial recovery in grants 
contributed to a strengthening of public finances.  The Government also made efforts to restrain 
spending. Public expenditures have decreased with respect to 2009 but remained slightly above 
the pre-crisis levels. As a result, the consolidated nonfinancial public sector ran a primary surplus 
(after donations) in 2011 for the first time in the decade. While this outcome attests to a budding 
economic resilience, new vulnerabilities have also emerged.  Over the last three years, the 
authorities have used political private cooperation flows from Venezuela of around 2.1 percent of 
GDP to pay for, inter alia, current expenditures such as electricity subsidies and wage bonuses 
for public employees, which could represent a potential fiscal liability if such financing flows are 
interrupted. 

18. 
Since the global crisis, Nicaragua’s economic performance has been strong.  
Economic activity rebounded in 2010, and it remained robust in 2011 as real GDP grew at 3.1 
percent in 2010 and 5.1 percent in 2011. As a consequence, consumer price inflation escalated to 
9.2 percent in 2010 but stabilized at 8 percent in 2011. Exports grew 13.2 percent in real terms, 
and investment is approaching its pre-crisis levels (28 percent of GDP) in 2011. The external 
sector was boosted by traditional export products such as coffee, meat and sugar. Sales of 
manufacturing products to the United States market also expanded. Exports from maquila firms 
producing textiles and automotive parts posted a 40 percent increase while tourism grew 10 
percent. Strong domestic demand fuelled by both consumption and investment drove imports up 
by 22 percent. An increase in imports in 2011 (by 27.8 percent) led to a widening of the current 
account deficit to 14.4 percent of GDP, which is higher than in 2009 but lower than pre-crisis 
levels. 

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability  
19. 
Nicaragua’s economy is likely to grow moderately in the medium term, but it 
remains vulnerable to adverse developments in the external sector. Economic growth is 
expected to decrease to 4 percent in 2012, reflecting continuing uncertainties with the 
international environment, and then to stabilize at around 4.6 percent.  This projection can be 
affected by a worsening in the European debt crisis and its direct and indirect repercussions for 
Nicaragua.  The country is heavily dependent on food exports to the US and Venezuela, and on 
oil imports. Fluctuations in commodity prices that adversely affect terms of trade would increase 
6 

 
the already high current account deficit (17 percent of GDP). The effects of a further 
deterioration of the euro zone crisis on global growth and on donor countries’ aid budgets would 
have adverse impact on the Nicaragua economy. While Venezuela is the main bilateral lender to 
the private sector (75 percent), Europe still plays a role in external financing through official 
development assistance (27 percent of total assistance to the public sector and 52 percent of 
donations in 2011).

20. 
External public debt is expected to decline steadily, with total debt decreasing to 43 
percent of GDP in 2016. The latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) carried out by the 
World Bank and IMF indicates a moderate risk of external debt distress. The analysis assumes 
the resolution of pending bilateral agreements which account for 40 percent of public sector 
external debt outstanding under the HIPC initiative in the near term. Medium-term 

7 

 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
vulnerabilities could arise from a depreciation shock and a historical scenario4 where expected 
growth dividend and envisaged adjustments do not materialize.  

21. However, modest growth levels make it difficult for Nicaragua to close the gap with 
the rest of LAC. As population is expected to grow at around 1.5 percent a year over the next 
decade, a growth rate of 4.5 percent would translate into increases in per capita income of only 3 
percent a year, thus making it difficult for Nicaragua to catch up with the LAC average. 
Considerably higher rates of growth are necessary for the country to converge in living 
standards. To this end, an increase in productivity growth – which has been low despite a 
relatively high share of investment – will be a critical agenda.   

22. 
Increasing productivity will be critical to raising growth rates and accelerating a 
convergence in incomes.  However, aggregate productivity (both labor productivity and total 
factor productivity) has been declining over the last ten years and is the second lowest in Central 
America. Almost all sectors faced reductions in productivity. Construction and agriculture 
presented the worst results, while garment and textile manufacturing were the only segments 
with productivity gains. Investment rates have been relatively high as a share of GDP, but the 
amount per capita actually invested in productive activities is very low. For example, per capita 
investment in infrastructure in Nicaragua is three times lower than in Honduras. In addition, 
growth returns to investment are lower than in neighboring countries.5 

23. Meanwhile, vulnerabilities can be reduced by diversifying export markets and 
products. Nicaragua’s export boom has not been accompanied by the diversification needed to 
reduce external vulnerabilities. It is the only country in the region for which export markets have 
become more concentrated, and the number of export relationships (product-destinations) is the 
lowest in Central America. Even though in nominal terms trade has expanded sharply, Nicaragua 
did not gain world market share over the past ten years and its exports continue to be dominated 
by agriculture products and textiles.  This has exacerbated its vulnerability to a concurrent 
downturn in commodity prices or other changes in the terms of trade.  Meanwhile the jobs 
created from the export boom have been concentrated in low wage, low skilled employment. 
Reducing trade and logistic costs, investing in the quality and productivity of exports, and 
supporting the growth of emerging non-traditional exports will be critical to improve the process 
of Nicaragua’s integration in the world economy.  In addition, increasing the links between 
exporters and the domestic economy will help broaden and distribute the gains from economic 
integration and accelerate poverty reduction.     

III. Government Strategy and Development Challenges 

24. 
The Government’s strategy builds on and consolidates achievements to date. The 
Government of Nicaragua’s National Plan for Human Development (PNDH) 2007-2012 remains 
relevant, with its emphasis on reducing inequality by increasing poverty-related spending and 
boosting investment in social sectors and rural infrastructure. This includes building on the

baseline case, and the primary deficit remains at 0.6 percent of GDP instead of continuously declining towards zero.

proven models to further expand access and to achieve more efficiency in the delivery of basic 
services.   

25. 
A key element going forward is to achieve faster economic growth while maintaining 
its emphasis on poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The Government is expected to 
renew its commitment to improve incomes by raising productivity, reflecting the growing 
concern that for accelerated poverty reduction the economy will need to grow at higher rates and 
provide better jobs.  Indeed, this has been the focus of a renewed dialogue between the 
Government and the private sector.  These efforts would be accompanied by a consolidation and 
increased effort on the human development agenda, and will be included in a revised National 
Plan for Human Development for 2013-2016 that is currently under preparation.   

26. 
The Government has confirmed the broad continuity of the strategy and the 
relevance of the current WBG program in supporting its objectives.  The areas of Bank 
engagement include sectors with broad public support and a proven track record of delivering 
results.  The proposed lending program has been confirmed with the authorities and the 
knowledge agenda supports emerging government priorities.  Given the relatively limited IDA 
resources, the Bank is proposing to coordinate closely with the IDB who are also in the process 
of finalizing their country strategy. 

Improving Social Service Delivery 
27. 
Achieving faster growth rates by improving productivity will require addressing low 
education levels.  Nicaragua’s educational attainments are very low by global standards. The 
population between 15 and 64 years of age has, on average, just 5.8 years of schooling with 
accentuated geographical inequalities achieving 8.1 years in urban areas, but only 4.4 years in 
rural areas. 

28. 
Inefficiencies in the education system are delaying progress to meet the MDG on 
universal completion of primary education. While there is universal enrollment in first grade 
and the gross enrollment rate (GER) at the primary level is 120 percent, less than 75 percent of 
children actually complete sixth grade (data from 2010)6, around 46 percent complete ninth 
grade, and 41 percent eleventh grade. This is the result of a combination of elevated dropout and 
repetition rates, which both have remained consistently above 10 percent on average in primary 
education over the last few years. These problems are concentrated in multi-grade rural schools 
which need better trained teachers, basic learning infrastructure, and adequate pedagogical 
materials. Lower secondary education (grades 7-9) also suffers from inadequate and unequal 
access and low completion, particularly in rural areas.  Low enrollment at the lower secondary 
level is a reflection of lack of access which requires at least classrooms and teachers. 

29. 
Improving quality will require strengthening teacher development and monitoring 
mechanisms. Nicaragua ranked below the regional average on UNESCO’s Second Regional 
Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) in 2006. In addition, national 2009 standardized 
evaluations show that learning outcomes in 4th and 6th grades were strongly correlated with 
poverty levels, rural schooling, and low retention rates in primary. On secondary education, 

6  
The Primary Completion Rate is probably overestimated because MINED usually counts all the children in grade 6 without 
discounting the repeaters.   The real Primary Completion Rate is probably slightly below 70 percent. 

9 

 
                                                            
Nicaragua is still developing the instrument to apply a standardized test in grade 11, but test 
results from university applications provides some indication of the secondary education quality 
challenge. The low quality is also a reflection of poorly trained teachers. In preschool teachers 
are non-formal community volunteers with little training in early-age learning processes. In 
primary, two thirds work in rural schools, many as “contract teachers” lacking any teaching 
certification.  Finally, 40 percent of secondary level teachers lack formal training and the vast 
majority work in rural areas where technical support is scarce.  

30. High poverty levels and vulnerabilities also affect the demand for education. About a 
third of the estimated 300,000 families with children living in extreme poverty have at least one 
child (aged 7-12) working or not going to school. An analysis of the reasons why school-age 
children are not enrolled in school indicates that about 12 percent of those who should be in 
primary school, 15 percent in lower secondary and around 25 percent in upper secondary were 
working. While public primary and secondary education are free, lack of money continues to be 
the most common reason cited for not attending school among extremely poor children. 

31. 
The Government has launched a new Education Sector Plan (ESP), with Bank 
support, for 2011-2015 to improve: (i) the coverage and quality of preschool education, (ii) 
completion of primary education; and (iii) the coverage and quality of secondary 
education.  Progress has already been made in some of the following areas: (i) the development, 
printing and distribution of learning and teaching materials in primary schools under a revised 
curriculum; (ii) the revision of the preschool curriculum and its implementation model; (iii) the 
extension of school feeding to all preschool and primary school children; (iv) the distribution of 
school supplies, including notebooks, uniforms and shoes to children in the poorest households 
and those not enrolled in school; (v) small repairs to primary school buildings; and (vi) the 
design of a plan for teacher professional development.  

32. 
The Government recently also approved an impressive strategy for achieving 
universal access to early childhood education, and plans to extend the ESP to upper 
secondary and technical and vocational education (TVET).  The efforts in early childhood 
education span three ministries, Health, Education and the Ministry of the Family, and have 
already demonstrated good results in terms of efficiencies and effectiveness from integrating 
multi-service delivery around common goals at the local level.  These lessons will be crucial also 
for TVET where a consolidated strategy is still under development and Nicaragua has scattered 
programs implemented by different ministries (e.g, INATEC, Ministry of Labor, INTECNA) that 
could be better coordinated. The strategy will aim to strengthen school-to-work transition and 
improve the linkages of the TVET programs with labor market demands.   

33. 
Nicaragua is making slow progress toward achieving the MDGs related to 
malnutrition (MDG 1) and maternal health (MDG 5) outcomes (see Annex 2).  Although the 
2012 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) is still being collected, there is some data which 
shows improvements in the percentage of children under two years of age with chronic 
malnutrition. While the MDGs 4 in infant and child mortality are on track to be achieved, the 
progress on maternal mortality has been difficult to monitor.  Infant mortality fell from 28.1 
(2006) to 22.6 per 1,000 live births (UN Interagency group data) in 2010 and under-5 mortality 
also fell from 68 (1990 UN Interagency group data) to 26.9 per 1,000 live births (2010 
CELADE). Meanwhile maternal mortality shows little or no decline using available data, from 

10 

 
96 (2006) to 95 per 100,000 live births (2010 Inter agency group data), but risk factors such as 
number of attended births and percent of women receiving sufficient pre-natal checkups has 
improved steadily.   Nevertheless, progress still appears too slow to achieve the goal of reducing 
it by three-quarters from the 1990 baseline. 

34. 
The model of Community and Family Health Care Services is showing promising 
results.  Along with universal access to basic health and nutrition services, this model builds on 
earlier efforts in primary health care service delivery, while placing more emphasis on 
promotion, prevention and on collaborating with local community organizations through a 
territorial network approach to delivery of a basic benefit package of services.  Access for 
vulnerable populations, including indigenous groups, women, children, and the elderly is a 
priority.  Combined with capitation financing and performance-based-incentives, the model, has 
shown promising results in the last five years that it has been in place.  However, more is needed 
to ensure efficiency and the quality of service delivery.   Key challenges include the need to 
support an evolution towards a results-based financing scheme.  MINSA should improve the 
systems for data collection, monitoring and evaluation, to accurately cost service provision at 
different levels of attention, and to undertake more systemic institutional performance and 
impact assessments.  

35. 
The National System of Social Welfare (SNBS) and its flagship Programa Amor have 
provided lessons on how to deliver basic services in an integrated way at the local level. 
Programa Amor, which is supported by the Social Protection Project (Report No. 56243-NI), 
focuses on connecting vulnerable families living in extreme poverty, in particular, those with 
children out of school, to all pertinent social assistance programs and basic services.  As noted 
above, the results to date of integrating services across the Ministry of Education (MINED), the 
Ministry of the Family, Youth and Children (MIFAN) and the Ministry of Health (MINSA) 
around a first common goal of raising early childhood enrollments – are very promising.  The 
Government hopes to also raise the efficiency of this new social assistance/protection service 
provision model (Modelo Atención) and to extend it to other vulnerable groups through a life-
cycle approach that reaches to the elderly.  Plans to implement a national unified registry of 
social program beneficiaries including a digital health registry of families (“Ficha de Salud”) is 
another step in the right direction. 

36. However, given the decline in donor financing for the social sectors, Nicaragua faces 
an urgent need to address the sustainability in social service delivery.  A gradual decline in 
development cooperation in Nicaragua over the last five years (see paragraph 23) has been most 
severely felt in the social sectors where aid fell from US$280 million in 2007 to $130 million in 
2011 and from 40 percent of the aid flows to less than one quarter.  Meanwhile, the Government 
is making progress on gradually improving its own revenue flows that could be available to roll 
out new service delivery innovations.  For this reason, consolidating the above mentioned 
models of integrated service delivery that are showing progress, as well as improving planning 
and budgeting, are critical to sustaining service delivery and progress on Nicaragua’s human 
development agenda.   

37. 
Despite progress in the last decade, there are still large rural-urban gaps in access to 
water and sanitation; public financing is used to subsidize operational and maintenance 
costs of inefficient urban systems instead of being directed to low-income rural households. 

11 

 
Although Nicaragua has achieved its MDG in access to improved water sources, progress on 
access to sanitation has been slower.  Disparities in terms of urban and rural access to water – 98 
percent versus 68 percent, respectively – and to sanitation (63 percent versus 37 percent) are 
particularly striking. The sector also needs to look beyond coverage to improvements in service 
quality and sustainability. Most of the urban population receives discontinuous supply; 
ENACAL, the urban water company, requires continuous transfers from the budget to operate. 
With a recent increase in donor flows to water and sanitation, there are opportunities to make 
important gains, provided there is progress on sector realignment. The Government is currently 
preparing a modernization program for the urban sector (with the support of the Bank and other 
donors) and a new master plan of public investments in both rural and urban areas that should 
provide a strong basis for moving forward.   

38. Ongoing development of the public financial management system needs to be 
complemented with improved planning, M&E, and expenditure policy formulation, 
particularly in the social sectors.  Some progress has been made in moving to results-based 
management, multi-year budgeting and expanding public financial management (PFM) reform to 
sector ministries and municipalities. The authorities are also implementing an ambitious 
modernization effort (supported by IDA, IDB and the EU) to update the ICT platform to better 
support public financial and procurement operations making them more effective and 
transparent.  However, in the social sectors these efforts need to be complemented with 
improvements to the systemic capacity of the SNBS for targeting, monitoring, and evaluating 
social spending.  

Accelerating Growth and Improving Incomes  
39. 
To complement the human capital development strategy, Nicaragua needs to 
accelerate economic growth and improve incomes.  Despite high levels of investment, gradual 
improvements in educational attainment, including a surge of university graduates, a boom in 
exports over the past decade or so, Nicaragua’s economic growth remains moderate.  The decline 
in productivity (see paragraph 19) has not been stemmed, nor has there been any resumption in 
average real earnings growth.   Current hypotheses point to the still large infrastructure needs and 
weaknesses in the investment climate, including property rights.  Recent Bank analytical work7 
suggests also that improvement in infrastructure needs to be complemented by attention to 
logistics and trade facilitation, while the challenge of raising incomes in the rural sector (where 
poverty is highest), suggest that the current rural development strategies focused on food security 
should be complemented by efforts to raise productivity in export production.   

40. 
Improvements to the investment climate are critical to sustain and diversify local 
and foreign investment.  Nicaragua’s overall position in the Doing Business Survey is low at 
118 of 183 in 2012, recording a slight improvement from the year before. Investment climate 
indicators are quite low compared to the regional average in terms of Business Start-up, Property 
Registration, Secured Transaction, and Trade Logistics. Recently there has been a renewed 
government commitment to improve the business environment and reduce red tape in general, 
but efforts in this area need to be accelerated.  In addition, the country has a nascent competition 
policy and institutional framework to address issues of market dominance in many sectors, as a 
means to spur both domestic and foreign investment.   

7  

A Country Economic Memorandum is currently under preparation. 

12 

 
                                                            
41. 
Despite credit growth during the last decade, access to finance is still an important 
constraint to economic activity in general and productivity improvements specifically 
among SMEs.  Nicaragua’s banking sector is small and highly concentrated with just seven 
banks, the three largest of which hold close to 78 percent of the banking system assets. 
Nevertheless, the sector is relatively stable, with adequate risk coverage, capitalization and 
improving profitability.  Credit as share of GDP almost doubled during the last decade (from 18 
percent in 2001 to 33 percent in 2011). However, the expansion in commercial banking has 
largely shifted towards consumer credit; less than a third of total loans provided by banks and 
regulated financial institutions goes toward productive activities. World Bank and IMF 
diagnostics have identified gaps in the national payments system infrastructure. In addition, the 
large microfinance sector has suffered in the past years from a broad nonpayment movement by a 
large group of rural producers. In mid 2011, the Assembly approved new microfinance 
legislation8 which has helped to reverse the impact and provides a strong basis for improving the 
regulatory framework.  Aside from insurance, the rest of the financial services industry is quite 
underdeveloped with equity and security markets still too small to play a significant financing 
role.   

42. While strong advances were achieved in land tenure security, more remains to be 
done.  Almost 20 percent of national territory has been titled and registered, including 15 
indigenous territories representing the majority of the Atlantic region, based on an improved 
national legislation put in place with support from the Bank.  Meanwhile, modernization of the 
cadastre-registry processes has now yielded significant reductions in the time it takes to register 
property from 124 days in 2007 to 49 days in 2012.  The Government is embarking on a program 
to gradually rollout the regularization process through the remaining territory, however this will 
require significant resources and IDA is one of the few active donors in this area.    
Making the Most of the Rural Economy 
43. 
Low productivity of the main agricultural crops is a challenge both for exports and 
food security.  Agriculture remains one of the main drivers of economic growth and represents 
21.5 percent of GDP, 32.3 percent of all exports and 32.2 percent of employment.  Increases in 
production have not been accompanied by much intensification, and yields for Nicaraguan 
commodities are consistently below the LAC regional averages.  There is significant potential for 
agriculture to continue increasing its contribution both to the national economy and to poverty 
reduction, provided that structural challenges of the sector are adequately addressed to improve 
productivity of both food and export crops, to encourage ongoing diversification into new export 
sectors, and to ensure robust linkages with small holder producers.   

44. 
There are opportunities to be transformative.  While low productivity has been a 
permanent challenge of public and private investment, technological innovation, business 
development services, and increasing access to rural finance services could increase the impact 
of public policies in the agricultural sector.  The Government’s continued focus on small 
producers is appropriate given that the majority of both food and export crops are based in small 

8  
To strengthen supervision, transparency and efficiency in the microfinance sector, the National Assembly 
approved in June 2011, the Law for the Promotion and Regulation of Microfinance Institutions.  The Law provides a 
strong basis for monitoring the institutions that intend to transform from non-governmental microcredit providers to 
regulated specialized microfinance banks registered with the new microfinance regulator.

holder production.  However, the strategy of making newer technologies and practices more 
widely available through improved extension services could be complemented with innovations 
that strengthen the linkages of these small producers to bigger markets and supply chains.  
Nicaragua could reinforce its efforts to ensure an integration of environmental considerations 
into its agricultural policies – to ensure both climate adapted and sustainable use of its resources.  

Raising the Impact of Infrastructure Investments 

45. 
Challenges in infrastructure in Nicaragua are significant, and improvements would 
help boost competitiveness, improve productivity and facilitate exports.  Only 13 percent of 
the road network is paved and only 42 percent is in good or fair condition9.  As a result, less than 
a third of the population has access to a paved road.  The road condition issues are compounded 
by heavy vehicle overloading with the destruction of the road infrastructure without viable 
mechanisms for cost recovery. This places a significant burden on Government in terms of 
maintenance. Extra complications arise from natural disaster vulnerability. Addressing systemic 
issues and developing sound strategies would maximize the impact of limited resources. 
Nicaragua has seen improvement over recent years reflected in a 10 percentage point gain in 
perceptions of infrastructure quality as measured by the Global Competitiveness Index, with the 
introduction of a large program of rural road rehabilitation, a sustainable road maintenance 
program, and the completion of some key transit routes.   

46. More integrated multi-modal planning and reducing high logistics costs could 
significantly raise the impact of Nicaragua’s transport investments.  Nicaragua has levels of 
maritime connectivity that could be associated with a land-locked country and the least 
efficiently used trucking fleet in the region.  Meanwhile, for agricultural products, with low unit 
values, customs and border procedures could represent up to 18 percent of sales costs.  The lack 
of equipment and appropriate facilities affect the ability to speed up customs and border 
processes and facilitate transactions. In some cases, it might take up to 15 hours to cross the 
borders.  Efforts to raise financing for a new port on the Atlantic coast should be preceded by 
efforts to improve the productivity on the Pacific coast port, and border crossings to the two 
main ports in Honduras and Costa Rica.   

47. 
Important progress has been made in resolving supply shortages in the energy 
sector, but access to energy remains the lowest in Central America.   Electricity shortages 
were eliminated with significant investment in thermal generation, but with the concomitant 
increases in costs due to oil price fluctuations.  Today, Nicaraguan firms face the highest costs of 
electricity in Central America.  Meanwhile, coverage was estimated to be around 69 percent in 
2009, and only 40 percent in rural areas. Government is now implementing a two-pronged 
investment program: (i) a large scale donor-financed extension of the distribution grid to rural 
areas which is expected to raise rural coverage to 84 percent, and (ii) aggressively promoting 
new private generation in cheaper, renewable sources.  The target is to convert the grid to 94 
percent renewable by 2017. Such an ambitious target is indicative of the Government’s concerted 

9  
Data provided by Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI, 2011). The 42 percent in good or fair 
condition refers to the core road network (about 8000 km) which does not include the local tertiary roads. When 
those roads are included, the roads in good or fair condition as a share of the total classified network is reduced to 
29% which is the baseline in the results framework. 

14 

 
                                                            
effort to move away from dependence on fossil fuels. While there is a steady pipeline in hydro 
and wind generation, Nicaragua has among the largest untapped geothermal potential in the 
world, the cheapest source of base power. Developing this resource will, however, require 
innovative mechanisms to reduce the large upstream development risk.  

48. 
Despite recent advances, including double digit growth since 2006 in mobile 
subscribers to 86 percent in 2011, access to telecommunication services in Nicaragua 
remains low, particularly in rural areas of the country.  Fixed broadband internet penetration 
is only 1.1 percent, significantly lower than the Latin American regional average of about 7 
percent.10    While Nicaragua’s current telecom regulatory framework encourages competition and 
private sector participation, it is difficult to stimulate investment in many rural areas.  Recently 
the Government has undertaken to roll-out and maintain regional networks11 transmission 
infrastructure in more remote locations given that inadequate telecommunications affect 
competitiveness by increasing the cost of logistics and curbing development of new IT related 
areas that are fundamental for the modernization of industry and trade. 

Transversal Challenges 
Gender 
49. 
Attention to gender issues can make a strong contribution to inclusive growth in 
Nicaragua (see Annex 3). Nicaraguan female labor force participation remains low at around 46 
percent, and has not changed much over the last decade.  Meanwhile, the level of consumption 
per capita of female headed households is around 10 percent lower than for those headed by 
men.  According to a recent Central America gender study (Report No. 68944), a 10 percent 
increase in female labor force participation would raise household incomes in Nicaragua by 
around 6 percent, and reduce poverty—8 percent for poverty, 10 percent for extreme poverty.   

50. 
Education is an important driver of labor force participation and empowerment for 
women in Nicaragua.  For each additional year of education, women are earning 15 percent 
more income than men (versus 10 percent more income in the previous decade).  Nicaraguan 
women have now achieved on average 20 percent higher educational attainments than men. This 
phenomenon has been driven by rising attendance and higher primary completion and secondary 
enrollment rates for girls.  In terms of political and economic leadership, Nicaragua scores well 
in terms of women parliamentarians, ministers, and women in managerial positions, and has a 
recognized legal framework for ensuring these opportunities, and for business ownership.12 
Women also represent 65 percent of microcredit recipients.  

51. Given the gradual progress on other fronts, the Government has identified three key 
challenges for the future: adolescent fertility, early childhood education and gender-based 
violence. Nicaragua has the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Latin America and doubles the 
world average with adolescent fertility rates of 110 per 1,000 of women aged 15 to 19 in 2010.  
And while unemployment rates are similar for men and women in general, they are 20 percent 
higher for 15-24 year old women.  The Government’s new strategy on early childhood education

has the potential to provide childcare solutions to more rural families where this service is scarce 
and improve labor force participation or continuing education for young mothers.  Finally 
gender-based violence remains a problem as evidenced by comparatively high homicide rates for 
women. The authorities have just passed a new law with broad public support that should 
provide a boost to ongoing efforts by civil society and the security forces to address the issue 
(see Annex 3).  

Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples 
52. 
Nicaragua’s indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant ethnic communities represent 
roughly 12 percent of the population.  A large number live in the Atlantic region where they 
retain native languages and customs, and count on autonomous regional governments, while the 
majority are found in the Central and Pacific regions, generally with a lesser degree of territorial 
integrity.  A continuously developing legal framework includes the 1993 Languages Law; the 
2003 General Health Law which promotes respect for community health models, 2003 Law on 
the System of Communal Ownership which clarifies the communities’ and titled territories’ right 
to self-government; and the 2006 General Education Law which paved the way for instruction in 
local languages. Nicaragua ratified the ILO Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 
2010. This legal framework has provided a good basis for increasing donor support targeted and 
delivered directly to these communities.  However, capacity and financing constraints still bind.     

Climate and Disaster Risk Management 
53. 
Investing more on disaster-proofing would improve long term productivity and 
competitiveness. Nicaragua is one of the world’s most disaster prone countries and the 
economic costs are high.  Basic social infrastructure, housing, and the roads system are the most 
harshly hit, in part due to the fragility of some of the infrastructure, leading to annual 
investments to replace lost capital.  Every year floods and droughts already impose high 
economic losses on Nicaragua’s economy, particularly by reducing production in the agricultural 
sector and, affecting water and energy supplies. Efforts are needed to reduce the high levels of 
vulnerability, promote mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in relevant sectors including 
health, education, water and sanitation, and to improve local capacity for disaster risk reduction 
and management.  The frequency and magnitude of these disasters is a likely factor affecting the 
low effectiveness of investment and the low rate of productivity growth in the country.  

54. Over time, and with the help of the Bank, Nicaragua has improved its Disaster Risk 
Management System. Solid legal and institutional arrangements for DRM are in place led by 
the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response (SINAPRED) and the 
National Policy and Management Plan for Disaster Risk Management which is aligned with the 
Regional Policy and Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction promoted by CEPREDENAC and the 
Hyogo Framework for Action at the global level.  Together with good inter-sectoral and local 
level coordination, these developments can reduce the mortality factor from natural disasters 
over time.    

55. 
Policy measures and investments in support of adaptation to climate change in key 
sectors could also yield significant benefits, even in the short term. Additional investment 
and integrated planning approaches across sectors are needed in order to climate-proof 
Nicaragua’s critical infrastructure, promote adaptation in agriculture, water supply and other 
16 

 
vulnerable sectors, and create support mechanisms by vulnerable households.  Adaptation 
measures can be costly, but they often simply mean good development policy and investment 
planning. In the agricultural sector, where volatile water supply has high costs, it is becoming 
increasingly important to integrate the risks brought about by extreme climate events in sectoral 
planning by addressing such aspects as water resource protection measures in investment 
programs.  

Transparency 
56. 
Nicaragua still faces a variety of challenges with respect to good governance.  While 
the most high profile aspects relate to the check and balances, including electoral processes, 
other issues such as government effectiveness, regulatory quality and the control of corruption 
are critical for accelerating and broadening the gains from economic growth.  For example, in 
terms of government effectiveness, the investment climate is still encumbered with challenges in 
the area of property rights and land administration, as well as in judicial services.  There are 
avenues outside the political system where the demand for good governance could help improve 
the quality of public services and development outcomes. 

57. 
Improving transparency in the public sector is crucial to help build broader 
consensus around development strategies.  Within the public sector, there has been good 
progress in the area of budget openness and public financial management, albeit with the need to 
further develop better linkages between spending and outcomes that allow for a more transparent 
evaluation of public programs.  In addition, Nicaragua still has significant weaknesses in the area 
of spending oversight both for central government and state owned enterprises.  Efforts are 
needed to strengthen the Comptroller’s office and ensure regular publication and auditing of 
SOE accounts.  In terms of voice and accountability, although access to public information is 
regulated and guaranteed by the Access to Public Information Law approved in 2007, the 
accompanying regulations continue to be insufficient as to effectively guarantee unrestricted 
access to public information.   Weaknesses in the monitoring and evaluation systems within the 
public sector hinder the presentation of information on the performance of public programs.  A 
notable example is that the Ministry of Education has not published its annual statistical report 
since 2009.   In contrast, in those areas where the authorities have encouraged public debate such 
as in macroeconomic and fiscal policies, emerging consensus has helped to strengthen reform 
options. 

IV. The Country Partnership Strategy FY08-FY12 

58. 
The CPS FY08-FY12 (Report No. 39637-NI) discussed by the Executive Directors on 
August 27, 2007, was prepared during the first six months of the new administration and 
before the Government had articulated its general development strategy.  As the 
administration matured, several policy shifts emerged which posed implementation issues for a 
number of ongoing Bank-financed projects, particularly those which engaged the private sector 
in public service delivery, as well as the use of conditional cash transfers to households and 
matching grants to firms.  Later, adjustments to the lending program were required to 
accommodate requests for assistance to address a series of crises.  These adjustments were 

17 

 
 
 
reflected in the CPS Progress Report of December 4, 2009.13 During the CPS period the 
Government reaffirmed its emphasis on pro-poor delivery of basic social services and 
infrastructure. This continues to be an area of focus for the FY13-17 CPS. 

Portfolio Performance 
59. 
Nicaragua’s current IDA program is the best performing portfolio in Central 
America.  The country program includes 14 projects representing some US$400 million 
equivalent of commitments with around US$230 million disbursed.  This is complemented by 
US$15 million of trust funds (see Annex 5).  The average disbursement rate of the portfolio was 
29 percent per year over the previous CPS period, and 37 percent in FY12.  No commitments are 
presently at risk or in problem status.  Close supervision by the Bank and the Ministry of Finance 
promoted an early response to implementation problems.  Although Nicaragua remains a high 
risk country for procurement, rigorous attention to fiduciary management, including ongoing 
annual training on procurement, financial management and disbursement procedures for 
government staff, has helped.   

60. 
IFC’s portfolio (on a commitments basis) has grown from US$53 million at the end 
of FY07 to US$160 million at the end of September 2012, continuing an upward trend since 
2003.  Advisory services of US$5 million have been approved to date, of which around 50 
percent of advisory services are linked to IFC’s investment portfolio.  This is high compared to 
other countries in the region.  MIGA’s outstanding gross exposure in Nicaragua as of August 31, 
2012 was $34.9 million in support of two power generation projects in the renewable sector and 
one project in the financial sector.  MIGA's exposure net of reinsurance was US$32.1 million.   

Lessons Learned 
61. With a five-year CPS in a country that is vulnerable both to external shocks and 
policy shifts, flexibility to adjust the program in response to crises and emerging 
opportunities can help to maintain a robust program and solid results.  Additional financing 
have been used to scale up existing projects that are successful.  Looking forward, given the 
relatively large size of the current portfolio, the Government is adopting a strategy of one 
significant new project a year on average.  This strategy is useful in that it provides flexibility to 
re-program smaller amounts on an annual basis that can be used in the event of a crisis.   

62. 
Development of a transparent monitoring and evaluation system is an important 
part of stimulating good governance and must be a priority in all IDA operations.   Despite 
the advances in many sectors, Nicaragua still faces challenges to measure the results of its 
ongoing programs and to use these measurements to effectively evaluate and refine them.  For 
example, there is no robust official data on trends in primary net enrollment, access to all-
weather roads, safe water and sanitation, maternal mortality, or chronic malnutrition. 
Implementation demonstrated that in areas with good monitoring and evaluation, transparency 
and governance were strengthened by engaging other stakeholders and improving the quality of 
public programs at the technical level.   

13  

Report No. 51616-NI 

18 

 
                                                            
63. 
The decision to shift resources from budget support to investment lending proved 
effective because of the solid implementation performance of the core projects.  As options 
for policy reform weakened during the CPS period and with it the basis for budget support, IDA 
resources were used to finance tested and scalable investment lending initiatives. This experience 
shows the importance of developing and maintaining proven investment interventions that have 
broad-based support so as to have options to channel resources when the policy agendas are 
weak. However moving forward, the Bank will create opportunities to maintain policy dialogue 
in key sectors.   

64. 
Consolidating the portfolio around key lines of action can leverage results with 
modest resources.  Towards the end of the CPS period, the Bank focused its efforts in a few key 
sectors through combining ongoing investment lending with technical assistance to provide 
support to the Government in designing sector strategies. This has resulted in a role for the Bank 
to use its knowledge and convening power to help leverage additional resources to finance well 
designed scalable programs.  Experience in the education sector for example, is currently being 
replicated in water and sanitation.  The long term expectation is that consolidating the portfolio 
further in key strategic areas will help to foster better results and improve coordination with key 
development partners. 

Consultations  
65. 
This CPS has been informed by a range of consultations with the government 
leadership and line ministries, as well as with the private sector, opposition political 
leaders, think tanks, indigenous communities and other development partners.   The private 
sector representatives from a wide range of sectors unanimously pointed to the issue of trade 
logistics and trade facilitation as an emerging priority for Nicaragua.  Issues included the high 
costs of transport, complex import and export procedures, and congested border crossings as a 
key factor in lowering Nicaragua's export competitiveness. Others suggested the need for 
additional attention to export promotion, in particular services for smaller exporters and 
emerging non-traditional products.  In the financial sector, both the private sector and think tanks 
suggested that in addition to a strategic agenda for deepening financial access and broadening the 
range of financial instruments and products, policy dialogue should also review the existing 
financial sector regulation and procedures as a focus for improving the business climate.  
Indigenous community representatives sought a more integrated focus of the Bank in the Atlantic 
regions, and more integration into the strategic planning process with central government.  

66. 
Among the non-governmental organizations (NGO), the main suggestion was for the 
Bank to ensure a multi-sector approach to addressing social issues and some of the lagging 
MDGs, in particular building on some of the more successful local grassroots efforts to 
treat Nicaragua's vulnerable groups in a holistic manner.  Several participants hoped the 
Bank could encourage more avenues for NGO participation in social programs, while others 
called for greater alignment between non-governmental and government efforts to solve social 
issues.  All parties called for the Bank to help foster a more open debate on public policies and 
programs in Nicaragua, in particular through more outreach about Bank-financed projects and 
policy dialogue, broader technical assistance for building monitoring and evaluation skills both 
within and outside of government, and renewed support for the full implementation of the 
Nicaragua's Freedom of Information legislation.   

19 

 
Box 1. Nicaragua Country Survey FY13 – Overall Findings 
The FY12 Nicaragua Country Survey, conducted during May-July 2012, records the views of 240 stakeholders 
among political leaders, government officials and contractors, local government, donor agencies, private sector, civil 
society and the media.  This is the first World Bank client survey conducted for Nicaragua.  There is an overall view 
that the Bank is relevant in the country, that its programs are aligned with the development priorities of Nicaragua, 
and that it is respectful toward stakeholders and collaborates well with government.  Respondents believe there is a 
very valuable role for the IFC in the country, yet familiarity with the IFC is somewhat low.   
Survey respondents viewed education and economic growth, followed by rural development and jobs, as most 
critical for reducing poverty. Stakeholders see energy development and foreign direct investment as the two critical 
drivers of economic growth in Nicaragua. Within this context, the Bank is viewed as having a critical role to play in 
the most important areas of development:  education, rural development and poverty.   
The survey also suggests that stakeholders value the Bank most for its financial resources rather than its knowledge 
or technical assistance.  The most valued instruments are investment lending, capacity development, mobilization of 
other resources and policy-based lending, while the least valued instrument is identified by half of the respondents 
as analytical work. This suggests that the Bank could consider ways to improve the relevance of the 
knowledge/data/research. Survey respondents also indicated that obtaining Bank financing is too complicated and 
one-fifth of respondents suggest that the Bank should offer more innovative financial products.  Finally, when 
thinking about how the Bank can be of greater value in the country, nearly a third of respondents reported that it 
would be valuable for the Bank to focus primarily on advocacy issues.   

V. The Country Partnership Strategy FY13-FY17 
Objective 
67. 
The CPS is organized around two key strategic areas which address the main goals of the 
Government’s strategy, namely a continued focus on social welfare through improvement of 
people’s access to basic services and a heightened concern on issues of productivity, 
competitiveness and export diversification. IFC’s engagement is fully integrated in supporting 
these areas and will focus on fostering sustainable economic growth, critical infrastructure and 
job creation, and helping Nicaragua take advantage of regional integration opportunities.   

Principles of Engagement 
68. 
Based on the experience of the previous CPS implementation, and lessons learned in IDA 
countries, the proposed CPS will be guided by the following principles: 

 Maintaining a strong implementation record.  Nicaragua’s IDA portfolio has benefited 
from close and careful supervision that has led to good results and rapid disbursement.  The 
new program will aim to continue this record through the various efforts in fiduciary 
management and implementation support, including annual training.  In addition, the new 
program proposes to add no more than one or two new projects of a moderate size each 
fiscal year.  The remaining available financing would be used: (a) for additional financing 
on projects with a good implementation record; and/or (b) to respond to emerging crises. 
With respect to the latter, the Government has agreed to introduce IDA’s Immediate 
Response Mechanism (IRM) into the portfolio in FY13.  

 Leveraging and bundling World Bank Group instruments.  Given limited IDA 
resources, the WBG will make a concerted effort to expand the bundle of services being 

20 

 
utilized in support of Nicaragua, in line with the regional strategy in Latin America and the 
Caribbean region while leveraging each group’s comparative advantage.  The IFC will play 
a lead financing role in the energy and financial sectors, while the Bank would primarily 
provide technical assistance and supporting analytical work.  MIGA will be open to 
opportunities to support FDI in the renewable power generation, agribusiness and financial 
sectors through the provision of political risk guarantees.    

 

 Scaling-up and resource mobilization.  The Bank also will seek to: (a) develop 
programs that can be scaled with the support of other donors; and (b) support the authorities’ 
efforts to attract more private investment and participation in public services. The Bank 
already has been asked to take the lead in supporting the identification of a pipeline of 
potential public private partnerships, and in designing programs that are scalable with other 
donor financing (e.g, education and rural roads).  The Bank could also support small pilot 
interventions that may be rolled out later with other partners.  To that end, it will judiciously 
use available trust fund programs to complement the IDA lending program or the 
IFC/MIGA investments and guarantees. It will operate in this manner in the technical design 
of program or reforms where the Bank does not assume a major financing role. 

 Improving monitoring and evaluation. The program will emphasize transparent 
measurement of results in the areas of its engagement, and work to deepen interactions with 
civil society and academia in evaluating and disseminating these results. This will include a 
focus on monitoring social sector indicators in particular; and raising the efficiency and 
effectiveness of public spending in all operations.  A strong monitoring and evaluation 
system will be a prerequisite for anchoring a more determined transparency effort, and 
ensuring the effectiveness of decreasing aid resources.   

CPS Program and Results 
69. 
The CPS supports the Government’s program in two key areas: (i) improving social 
welfare by improving access to quality basic services, in particular by poor rural households; and 
(ii) raising incomes by improving productivity, competitiveness and diversification.   

Strategic area 1.  Raise welfare by improving access to quality basic services 
70. 
The WBG will seek to accelerate the progress against the MDGs (see Annex 2) in 
education, water and health, through the implementation of a series of ongoing and future 
projects in these areas, and in social protection.  In the social sectors, an integrated approach 
geared to better efficiency, quality and expanding access and coverage has already begun to yield 
results.  The Bank will support the consolidation, costing and expansion, and M&E of these 
programs.  IFC will work to develop private sector solutions to critical social needs, in particular 
by investing in health and education.   

71. 
The CPS will bolster its current support for preschool education.  The focus in 
education will start with strengthening preschool education (3-5 year olds) where previous 
efforts have resulted in a gradually improving access: today 52 percent of 3-5 years old in 
Nicaragua attend some kind of preschool.  The current Education and Social Protection projects, 
together with two large EU and Global Partnership for Education trust funds will support 
implementation of the Government’s new strategy in Early Childhood Development (ECD).  A 

21 

 
goal for the end of the CPS is to consolidate the inter-sectoral model for ECD between the 
Ministries of Education, Social Protection and Health and to support its nationwide expansion. 
The Bank will also support the creation of a national registry of social assistance with well 
targeted and operational parameters.  

72. 
The focus on primary education will be on increasing access and improving quality. 
The current completion rate of primary education is relatively low at 75 percent.  Completion 
rates of 85 percent are expected by the end of the CPS period.  This CPS program will also 
continue supporting improvements in the quality of primary and lower secondary education as 
part of the Government’s strategy that is centered on reforming teacher training, expanding the 
availability of textbooks and learning materials, and improving infrastructure.  The impact of this 
support will be measured by the results of systematic achievement testing at relevant grade 
levels, and transition rates to secondary school. IFC is seeking to make its first investment in the 
education sector. 

73. 
In health, the CPS program will continue to focus on reducing infant and maternal 
mortality, and addressing chronic malnutrition. The Bank will support the Government’s 
Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario by strengthening the system of capitation payments 
linked to results, costing the system and helping to mobilize resources to expand the financing 
mechanisms nationwide.  The CPS will pay special attention to targeting outcomes on infant and 
maternal mortality. 

74. 
In social protection, the CPS program will continue to support the consolidation of 
the Modelo Atencion.  Through the ongoing Social Projection project (Report No. 56243-NI) 
and related trust funds, the Bank is supporting Government to improve capacities and integration 
among social workers and service providers at the local level, and to strengthen monitoring and 
evaluation at that national level.  Key improvements in the pilot areas, which also aim to raise 
the efficiency of social assistance spending, are intended to be mainstreamed nationwide.  

75. 
In water and sanitation, the Bank will continue supporting the design of the national 
water and sanitation strategy.  Complementary efforts to broaden access to potable water and 
improved sanitation are also envisaged as part of the agenda to improve health outcomes in 
Nicaragua.  Under the new CPS, the Bank will continue providing strategic and policy support to 
the sector, policy dialogue and technical assistance for the overall WSS sector, in particular 
aimed at improving financial sustainability in the urban systems and mobilization of additional 
financial resources for the rural sector to help reduce the current gaps. Through the 
complementary Water and Sanitation Program of the Government, which acts as a technical 
partner, the Bank will support the development of new techniques of sanitation marketing (with 
potential collaboration from IFC), local capacities for small rural and peri-urban projects, and 
disaster risk mitigation in urban water systems. 

76. 
In each of the above sectors, there will be a concerted effort to develop more 
accurate and transparent measurement of impact and expenditure efficiency which is 
intended to allow the Government to better prioritize the allocation of resources.  To this end, the 
CPS will include results from the ongoing work on the joint Bank-IDB-EU Public Financial 
Management project (PMSAF) to modernize Nicaragua’s PFM practices and information 
systems with special attention to the basic service delivery in the social sectors and water and 

22 

 
sanitation.   This will be complemented by analytical work on public expenditure in the 
education, health and social protection, which builds on the upcoming Demographic and Health 
Survey and a model census of vulnerable households, currently financed by IDA, as well as a 
program to improve indicators and measurement in the water and sanitation sector supported by 
Water and Sanitation Program.  Meanwhile, the Government has requested financial and 
technical support for the new 2013 Living Standards Measurement Survey. 

Strategic area 2.  Raise incomes by enhancing competitiveness and diversifying exports 
77. 
The CPS will continue to support efforts to raise income levels in Nicaragua by 
increasing productivity.  To begin, the program will broaden previous efforts focused primarily 
on access to infrastructure and production geared at the domestic markets and, to the extent 
possible, the export sector, as well as strengthening property rights.  The program hopes to 
expand current support for small rural household producers which have been mainly focused on 
the domestic market, toward creating effective linkages between these producers and growing 
export markets by linking with the large and vertically integrated firms that are active abroad.  In 
addition, the program will expand the focus on land administration to other investment climate 
issues, in particular, trade facilitation and financial innovation. In each of these new focus areas, 
the attention to improving productivity will be complemented by an effort to ensure 
environmental sustainability and address emerging climate change issues.  Finally, in all the 
areas of infrastructure, productivity improvements, and financial innovation, the program will 
seek to better coordinate IDA programs with IFC investments and MIGA guarantees.   

78. 
In agriculture, the CPS proposes to support Government’s efforts to shift limited 
IDA resources toward the emerging competitiveness agenda where small producers are 
now ready to move to more productive and higher income engagement in cash crops for 
export.  The IDA program will collaborate extensively with IFC which is already engaged in 
investments with the leading producers and exporters (coffee, palm oil), as well as a program of 
advisory services in export crops, and is working on expanding trade and supplier financing.  
Resources allocated to foster the diversification of exports will support the Government in the 
elaboration of strategies for the sustainable development of new export sectors with potentially 
strong developmental impact (i.e. palm oil and cocoa) in coordination with IFC.  A joint IDA-
IFC Agriculture Competitiveness Project could support the creation of productive alliances in 
key crops, aiming to more effectively link small producers and to raise productivity along the 
export supply chains, and to complement this with improvement in access to better financing 
instruments, and possibly improved logistics along the supply chain.  By the end of the CPS 
program, joint pilot initiatives for one or more new products to improve productivity and 
producers incomes should be in place.  MIGA will also be open to opportunities to promote FDI 
in the agribusiness sector. 

79. 
The CPS proposes to support the Government’s request to mobilize a Global 
Agricultural and Food Security Program (GAFSP) grant.  The authorities are proposing to 
focus a grant proposal on activities to link small-holder producers (particularly the indigenous 
and afro-descendant farmers)  in the Atlantic coast region and Nicaragua’s productive frontier, to 
market-based agriculture and to expand and strengthen value chains and value-added activities.  
Such a grant would also build on the ongoing Agricultural Technology project that works toward 
improved yields based on better availability of certified seeds.  A new PER in agriculture this 

23 

 
year, along with data from the 2011 agricultural census, and a multi-donor evaluation of the 
Government’s ProRural sector-wide program should permit the development of more cutting 
edge strategies, including the linkages between nutrition and food security.   

80. 
In transport, the CPS would continue concentrating in the rural roads sector while 
adding a new program for improving logistics and trade facilitation.  The Bank has already 
developed a successful and scalable model for investment and maintenance of rural roads which 
has proven to be an instrument to provide jobs for vulnerable communities, including for women, 
and attracted significant other donor financing.  In terms of financing, this emphasis will 
continue including, improvements in road management framework, further development of the 
multi-donor program, more climate resilience measures, and greater transparency in the selection 
of road segments.  It is expected that the share of roads in good condition will increase from 29 
percent to 35 percent by the end of the CPS period.  Meanwhile, the Bank has just completed 
several analytical pieces on trade competitiveness, transport logistics and customs that suggest 
more attention to these services would significantly improve the impact of infrastructure 
investments on trade.  The CPS program will continue technical support from the ongoing Trade 
and Transport Facilitation trust fund to introduce improvement in custom administration, 
including the introduction of integrated risk management systems.  The CPS will also explore the 
possibility of a multi-sectoral Trade and Transport Facilitation project that could address issues 
ranging from improvements in customs administration, border management, multimodal 
transport planning and regulations.   

81. 
In energy, the CPS program will support the Government’s strategy to increase 
private investments in renewable generation.  IFC and MIGA will assume the lead through 
investments and guarantees in renewable generation projects, including wind, geothermal and 
hydropower, while the Bank will primarily provide technical assistance and supporting analytical 
work to backstop these investments, in particular on sector financing, strategies for accelerating 
geothermal investments, and strengthening the regulatory and pricing framework for micro-
generators (such as those supported by the recently closed PERZA project).  It is expected that, 
between IFC and MIGA, new investments could add 100MW of renewable energy generation 
capacity in Nicaragua during the CPS period.  IDB leads the dialogue in rural areas and has a 
large multi-donor program supporting the Government’s strategy to roll out the distribution grid 
to remote areas. 

82. 
The Government has directed new attention to improving the business climate to 
spur both local and foreign direct investment.  The centerpiece of the CPS program will be a 
second phase of the Land Administration project (Report No. 22399-NI) continuing 
improvements in the legal framework, local investments in regularization and the modernization 
of titling and registry services.   Under the MSME project (Report No. 42806-NI), the Bank is 
supporting the modernization of the commercial code while under a new IDF grant the Bank will 
help to strengthen the institutional framework for investment and export promotion and to 
improve Doing Business regulations.  In addition, Nicaragua may receive support from a new 
Regional Competition Center spearheaded by the government of Mexico.  The Government’s 
objective is to signal to the investment community a commitment to a better business 
environment by, inter alia, improving their position in the Doing Business rankings.  Finally, the 
Bank 
is exploring a continuation of recent 
technical assistance on 
the Anti-Money 
Laundering/FTC with Nicaragua and the development of a program of support for the new 

24 

 
ROSC14-based Accounting and Audit action plan.  The key results sought in this area would be 
continued growth in FDI, improvements in an appropriate measure of trade competitiveness, and 
reductions of time and cost to registering property in Nicaragua, and an improvement in the 
country’s results on key Doing Business indicators.  

83. 
IFC will take the lead in providing resources for the financial sector, supported by a 
Joint IFC-WB technical assistance program on financial innovation.  IFC will continue its 
program of credit lines in the trade and housing sectors, while expanding into supplier credits 
(i.e., agri-finance, SME lending, among others).  Following the conclusion of the current Broad-
Based Access to Finance project in FY13, the two institutions will work together on a 
coordinated technical assistance program (from available trust fund programs)15 to support 
development of financial instruments and investment vehicles needed to improve financing for 
productivity improvements and export growth16.  Elaboration of regulations and institutional 
development for the new microfinance law is an early candidate.  This could, inter alia, permit 
IFC to resume financing flows to this critical sector.  Another candidate would be support for the 
improvement of Nicaragua’s framework for secured transactions, also an area covered by the 
Doing Business reforms.  MIGA will also be open to opportunities to support foreign investment 
in the financial sector.  

Transversal Themes 
84. Gender considerations have been mainstreamed in the Nicaragua program since the 
previous CPS.  These efforts are reinforced by the Government’s strong gender policy and 
institutional focus on equitable access.  The majority of projects which support broad-based 
service delivery already count on gender-disaggregated indicators for access to these services, 
and all of the major IDA16 commitments with respect to a “gender-informed portfolio” have 
already been met (see Annex 3).  The new CPS will continue to implement gender-based 
interventions in sectors for which follow-on operations are planned, such as land administration. 

85. 
The Government’s Programa Amor addresses issues such as teenage pregnancy 
through its life cycle programs for vulnerable families.  Other gender issues perform poorly in 
Nicaragua, which include the highest levels of adolescent pregnancy in Latin America, 
comparatively low female labor force participation, particularly among young uneducated 
women, and high levels of domestic violence.  However, because these issues are not limited to 
poor rural families, a broader approach is generally needed.  The Government has recently 
passed a new and important law on domestic violence which is attracting a lot of support from 
other development partners.  In the current CPS, the Bank will focus additional support on 
helping the authorities in formulating and implementing the National Strategy for Adolescent 
Sexual and Reproductive Health which would have synergies with work on reducing maternal 
mortality and a potential impact on labor force outcomes.   

14  
Reporting and Observance on Standards and Codes. 
15  
There is a proposal to review and develop the legal framework for Payment, Remittances, and Securities 
Settlement system which is being considered by the FIRST Trust Fund. 
16  
Support will build on recommendations from the 2009 FSAP conducted by the World Bank and the IMF. 

25 

 
 
                                                            
86. 
The Bank has been active in both the institutional and social development of 
indigenous communities in Nicaragua across several projects under implementation.  In 
addition, to a satisfactory implementation of the Bank’s Indigenous Peoples safeguard policy to 
over 60 percent of the portfolio, the Bank has supported the development and implementation of 
an Indigenous Peoples Land policies under which 15 indigenous and afro-descendant territories 
(comprising 19 percent of national territory) have been titled and registered.  The Bank has also 
supported production of primary textbooks in several Miskito and Mayagna and piloted an agro-
forestry model among indigenous and afro-descendent women farmers.  Going forward the 
Government has proposed to work with the Bank on developing new strategies for supporting for 
agricultural development on the Atlantic region. 

87. 
In terms of disaster risk mitigation and climate adaptation, the CPS will concentrate 
efforts in areas that are already a main focus of the program: water, land use management 
(including forestry) and agriculture.  Through a SCCF-financed GEF grant aimed at protecting 
rural water sources, the program is expected to play a financing and convening role in the search 
for appropriate adaptive responses for the Nicaraguan context, including through non-lending 
technical assistance.  Meanwhile the Water and Sanitation Program will undertake a regional 
disaster risk assessment of urban water systems form which Nicaragua will benefit as we 
continue the institutional engagement in this area.   Nicaragua has been approved for a Forest 
Carbon Partnership Facility REDD readiness grant, and the Government has already requested 
both a follow-on GEF grant for the management of the regionally-important Bosawas biosphere 
reserve and to include additional protected areas demarcation in the second Land Administration 
project.  In agriculture, there is potential WBI support to respond to a new Nicaraguan initiative 
on developing climate smart-agriculture policies through South-South Exchanges.  This would 
also help to ensure that the new program focus on agricultural export competitiveness and 
includes appropriate dimensions of environmental sustainability and climate resilience.  

88. 
To complement these medium term interventions, the program will make full use of 
IDA’s Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) while supporting the continued institutional 
development of the national disaster risk management system.   The Government has already 
agreed to introduce the IRM in the next lending operation.  From the regional program on 
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Reduction, Nicaragua could receive further technical support 
for additional risk assessments at the sector level, the formulation of a national financing strategy 
for risk management as well as a new generation of support for SINAPRED aimed at integrating 
municipal levels in DRM efforts.  

89. 
The transparency agenda will continue to focus on regulatory quality, government 
effectiveness, and voice and accountability.  In terms of regulatory quality, the support for 
improvements in land administration and financial sector legal frameworks and their 
implementation are expected to have significant development impact in Nicaragua. On 
government effectiveness, the primary outcome under the CPS will be to assist the authorities in 
upgrading of the Public Financial Management System and improving the efficiency of 
expenditures in the social sectors.  Finally, the CPS program will seek an explicit objective in the 
area of voice and accountability not only by supporting improvements in monitoring and 
evaluation of program-supported activities, but also the disclosure of M&E results and the 
greater disclosure of the technical achievements and challenges of these programs to the broader 

26 

 
society.  In this context, the Bank is well positioned to foster a broad range of technical dialogues 
between the Government and other stakeholders, including civil society.   

90. 
The Bank and the IDB will coordinate closely in the area of governance and 
transparency.  In terms of monitoring governance improvements, the Bank and the IDB use a 
harmonized methodology for their respective country policy and institutional assessments 
(CPIA/CIPE) that guide the allocation of concessional resources. The Bank and the IDB also 
share information with respect to fiduciary issues and are working together to support public 
financial management improvements. The Bank will continue to collaborate closely with the 
IDB in terms of monitoring the governance environment and identifying entry points for 
dialogue and IFI support. 

Monitoring and Evaluation 
91. 
This CPS proposes a focused effort on monitoring and evaluation as well as open 
data.  Given past difficulties in compiling reliable and comparable data for results monitoring, a 
concerted effort will be made to ensure both new and ongoing operations introduce better 
mechanisms to capture results, and where possible, efforts are made to build better institutional 
capacity for monitoring and evaluation. Efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation will be 
focused primarily in the context of Bank operations and in the social sectors in particular.  In line 
with IDA’s Managing for Results agenda, the Bank has provided statistical capacity building to 
Nicaragua in particular related to the Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS) for many 
years and is currently supporting a number of other survey efforts that are methodologically 
matched with previous instruments, namely, the 2011 Agricultural Census and the 2012 
Demographic and Health Survey.  The Bank will also support the 2013 LSMS with technical, 
and possibly financial, assistance, while seeking the authorities’ commitment for open data 
policies.  Meanwhile, Nicaragua has a small donor-financed long term impact evaluation 
program that has already successfully measured a variety of impacts of some past randomized 
social interventions on, inter alia childhood development, climate resilience, and income 
generation.  The program will also support an impact evaluation of the interventions on SCCF-
GEF funded climate adaptation of rural water sources.   

World Bank Group Program 
92. 
The CPS expects to concentrate new IDA financing in land administration, agricultural 
competitiveness and export diversification, rural roads, rural water and sanitation, social 
protection and health.  New IFC financing and MIGA guarantees would be concentrated in 
renewable energy, agribusiness and the financial sectors.   The Government is also likely to seek 
support to improve trade logistics and facilitation to broaden existing TA on the business 
environment.

The lending program for the CPS period is expected to be roughly US$50 million 
per year for the remainder of IDA 16.  The CPS covers the period FY13-FY17: two years of 
IDA 16 (FY13-14) and all the IDA 17 period (FY15-17).  The final FY13 allocation for 
Nicaragua is SDR39.5 million or about US$61 million equivalent (in grants and credits).17  The 
FY14 allocation (SDR 33.8 million) is indicative only and the final FY14 allocation will depend 
on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance rating, per capita GNI, and 
population; (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of 
IDA’s assistance to the country (grants and credit terms); (v) the number of IDA-eligible 
countries. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance, and the US$ equivalent is 
dependent up on the prevailing exchange rate. The allocations under IDA17 will also depend on 
the above factors, as well as on the overall size of the IDA 17 replenishment. 

17  

Nicaragua frontloaded SDR11 million in FY12 and cancelled SDR3.4 million.

Managing Program Implementation 
94. 
It is expected that by the end of the CPS period the program would be consolidated 
and operations would be reduced to roughly 10 projects.  The WBG is expected to 
concentrate its efforts in: (i) supporting the Government’s approach to local delivery of basic 
services and an integrated approach for health, education and social protection; and (ii) focusing 
on rural areas, particularly for water, agricultural productivity, roads and telecom.  Additional 
Financing for well-performing operations will be utilized to the extent possible.  

95. 
As with the IDA portfolio, careful attention would be taken to ensure that the trust 
fund portfolio remains consolidated, manageable and directly linked with the CPS and 
lending program. To support the implementation of the larger trust funds, for example in 
education, the Bank would contract additional fixed term staff in the Country Office to enhance 
management and supervision.  This has been the practice to date with the US$7 million DFID 
trust fund for Caribbean Coast development. As much as possible, the smaller technical 
assistance trust funds would be assigned to the same project teams in the sectors they are linked 
with. The proposed joint IFC-WB Financial Innovations Program would receive some dedicated 
budget to support the overall program, with the bulk of supervision resources coming from the 
individual trust funds.    

96. 
To manage fiduciary risks, the Bank will continue to decentralize procurement and 
financial management supervision.  Close supervision, migration to the usage of the electronic 
information system “SEPA”, and continual training in procurement, financial management and 
disbursement procedures for government staff have generated good results to date.  Such training 
will continue to be an important tool for strengthening institutional capacity and achieving 
fiduciary objectives. The Bank will continue on a recent started program of procurement 
seminars for the private sector to help encourage more competition and improved scrutiny.   

97. 
During the CPS period the Bank will focus additional attention on coordinating 
closely with the IDB and IMF on key areas for policy reform.  Given limited resources, this 
would include a suite of Bank services including ongoing investment lending, supporting 
analytical work and technical assistance, as well as convening key bilateral partners in some 
sectors.  As the main development partner in Nicaragua, coordination with the IDB and efficient 
division of labor is a key principle in terms of the Bank interventions.   

98. 
The CPS will continue to rely primarily on its investment lending portfolio given its 
proven record in delivering resources and results. The CPS will provide analytical and 
advisory work to strengthen the dialogue in the main areas of engagement and develop policy 
options in critical emerging areas of interest to the Government.   Examples of this effort include 
analytical work in rural competitiveness, on financial innovation and on monitoring and 
evaluation of social outcomes. These efforts will be complemented, as appropriate, by 
opportunities for South South learning. The Government has not yet requested Development 
Policy Lending from the Bank. However, the Bank could consider this instrument within the 
CPS period, provided the macroeconomic policies continue to be favorable and a sufficiently 
robust policy agenda emerges in agreement with the Government. To strengthen the policy 
dialogue in potential reform areas the Bank will cooperate with the IDB and the IMF (see above) 
and support the Government with technical assistance. 

29 

 
 
Partnerships 
99. 
Nicaragua has seen a decline in donor support to the public sector18 from around 
US$700 million in 2007 to US$500 million in 2011 due to the departure of several bilateral 
partners.  Grant donations have been halved from US$430 million in 2007 to US$250 million in 
2011, while, multilateral support and loan financing have remained largely constant. IDA is the 
third largest donor and IDB is the largest partner, with roughly triple the flows of IDA at US$170 
million per year.  The European Union, Spain and Japan are important partners for Nicaragua, 
and Central America more generally. In the context of declining donor resources, the 
Government has requested Bank support for: (i) mobilizing more grant resources from relevant 
global funds; (ii) blending available grant resources with emerging commercial financing, e.g. 
from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration; and (iii) opening the possibility for 
more public private partnerships in some new sectors.  In addition, the Bank is engaged in an 
active dialogue with development partners and diverse stakeholders to monitor the risk of further 
reduction in aid flows to Nicaragua. 

100. The Bank will continue to promote an efficient division of labor among key 
development partners, as well as more coordinated programs among donors.  The CPS was 
prepared in close coordination with the IDB, and preparation included discussions regarding an 
efficient division of labor of development assistance.  The IDB leads on larger road investments, 
while IDA supports rural road development.19  IDB leads on rural electrification and the Bank on 
rural water and sanitation.   The two institutions co-finance a large program on public financial 
management, while the IDB has led on procurement reform and the Bank and IDB work together 
on customs administration.   

101. Areas of collaboration for development partners, including bilateral donors, emerge 
as part of the regular dialogue on key sector roundtables. These ‘mesas’ for technical 
discussion have been instrumental in ensuring close coordination across the donors at the sector 
level.  In addition, the Bank will continue to pay a role in leveraging resources for larger 
government programs in key sectors, for example in education and water and sanitation. In areas 
where the Bank does not play a lead role, it would continue to work with other multilateral actors 
and provide analytical support as needed. The Bank will continue to work closely with the IDB 
and IMF, including to the extent possible on joint analytical work.  

Regional 
102. The CPS period will support the Nicaragua program through several regional 
initiatives.  In support of a greater integration of the Central American regional economy, the 
Bank will work with Nicaragua to facilitate trade by reducing barriers between countries, for 
example customs procedures and border crossing standards.  Additional initiatives include: (i) 
support for a Central American Private Sector Task Force; (ii) support to strengthen the public 
sector through a  Regional Integration Training Program (launched in January 2011) and a 
Central American Leadership program with the INCAE Business School; (iii) support to the 
Central American Council of Ministers of Finance (COSEFIN) for the preparation of a Central 

18  
This does not include Venezuela oil cooperation which is accounted for as donor cooperation flows to the 
private sector, similar to IFC, CAF and some Millennium Challenge Corporation flows. 
19  
IDB will also finance rural roads as part of its Country Strategy under preparation. 

30 

 
                                                            
America-DR Regional Investment Plan and a trade facilitation window; and (iv) support for the 
preparation of a Central American Disaster Risk policy.  

103. Support on crime and violence will have a strong regional perspective.  Bank support 
in this area centers on the Bank’s convening power, including analytical work and technical 
assistance, as well as participation and co-organization of high level events in the region.  In 
addition, the 2011 World Development Report (WDR) on Conflict, Security and Development 
and the Central America regional study on Crime and Violence (Report No. 56781) are 
informing the regional debate on the topic with analytical work. The Bank is also contributing to 
the institutional strengthening of the regional institution responsible for the citizen security 
agenda in Central America (i.e., SICA) with financial resources from the Institutional 
Development Facility (IDF). Similarly the Bank, together with the IDB and other bilateral 
donors, is providing technical assistance to implement SICA's Regional Security Strategy. This 
includes the creation of a regional crime observatory (OBSICA) to generate comparable statistics 
on violent crimes across Central American countries.  

VI. Risks 

104. Political economy issues are risks for the CPS period.  Polarization of different 
political groups inside and outside the dominant political party remains an issue. Mitigating 
measures include aligning the CPS with the political cycle and maintaining close coordination 
with development partners and diverse stakeholders. There is a slight additional risk that the 
revised National Human Development Plan could divert significantly from the current structure 
introducing a misalignment with the CPS.  This risk is being mitigated through a continuous 
dialogue with Government and implementation of a strategy that builds on results in areas with 
broad stakeholders support. 

105. Nicaragua remains highly vulnerable to external shocks. The country remains 
particularly sensitive to economic shocks and an increase in food prices. Global economic 
prospects, including a potential economic crisis in Europe, a slowdown of the United States 
economy, or a sudden stop of Venezuelan support could affect the Government’s ability to 
implement its program. Adverse impacts of the external environment on the price of export 
commodities could further affect Nicaragua’s external position. The WBG will remain actively 
engaged through dialogue, and coordinate closely with the IMF to support the authorities’ efforts 
to maintain macro stability and mitigate the impact of external shocks. 

106. The country’s susceptibility to natural disasters remains a concern.  Climate shocks 
such as hurricanes, severe storms, floods and droughts occur frequently. The country is also 
prone to earthquakes. These events threaten the life and health of the population and the 
infrastructure of the country. The Bank will continue to support disaster risk management efforts 
through trust funds and analytical work.  In addition the new IDA mechanism, IRM, will be built 
into selected projects in the portfolio to provide a mechanism for fast disbursing funds in the 
event of a natural disaster.

 Annex 3.  Nicaragua: Summary Gender Assessment 

1. 
Nicaragua has good legal foundations for the various levers of gender equality – building 
human capital, access to economic resources, participation in society and protection.  Public 
policies are helping to raise girls’ and women’s access to education, health care, credit, land and 
other productive resources.    However, in terms of outcomes, results are mixed.  On the one 
hand, significant progress has been made on education and incomes.  While on the other hand, 
Nicaragua remains challenged by very high levels of gender-based violence and teenage 
pregnancy, combined with exceptionally low levels of female labor force participation and high 
levels of unemployment among the most vulnerable – young, uneducated women.   

2. 
Legal foundations for gender equality.  The Constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua 
grants equal civil rights to all citizens and prohibits gender-based discrimination.  Electoral laws 
call for a gender-balanced representation in Parliament.  Nicaragua scores well on laws and 
regulations affecting women's prospects as entrepreneurs and employees.  There are no legal 
inequalities in terms of accessing institutions and property and Nicaragua has laws mandating 
equal pay and protecting maternity benefits, and provides publically-financed, mandatory 
primary education.20 Interestingly, the minimum legal age for marriage (with parental 
authorization) is only 14 years for women and 15 years for men.  Most recently, Nicaragua 
passed a new Law on Violence against Women (February 22, 2012) that mandates punishment 
for different types of violence, defines habitual abuse as a separate offense and makes mediation 
inadmissible in cases of violence.  The Government has a strong gender policy which has been 
internalized in most ministries striving to ensure women’s access to public and private services. 
Nevertheless, the institutional framework needs further strengthening, in particular on the 
judicial side, to ensure that women’s rights are fully protected in practice.   

3. 
Political and economic representation.  Political participation of women is very high in 
Nicaragua when compared to the region, same income level countries and the world. At the 
National Assembly, 20.7 percent of parliamentarians are women (2010), compared to 17.6 
percent on average in the world and 13.9 percent for same income level countries. Today, 
Nicaragua has the highest number of women holding ministerial positions in its history (55 
percent, 2010) and at the same time the country has the highest share of female Ministers in the 
region (ECLAC).   In 2006, the share of women in managerial positions at 41 percent was 
relatively high compared with other low-income countries (27 percent), while in 2010 
Nicaraguan women participated in the ownership of 62 percent of all firms, also very high when 
compared to other countries in Latin America.  Finally, according to recent market information 
provided by the industry (Mix Market, 2011), the majority – 65 percent – of microcredit 
recipients are women.    

4. 
Education, employment and incomes.  Over the last decade, women in Central America 
have not only closed the education gap, but in the case of Nicaragua, they are also ahead of men.  

20 Women, Business and the Law: Removing Barriers to Economic Inclusion, the Doing Business review which 
presents indicators based on laws and regulations affecting women's prospects as entrepreneurs and employees.  
Latest data for Nicaragua is 2011.

Chart 1: Labor force participation by education 
(2009)

In 200921, Nicaraguan women had achieved 20 percent higher educational attainments than men. 
These improvements have been driven by 
rising attendance and higher primary 
completion rates for girls.  The latter was 
82 percent in 2010, compared to 68 
percent for boys.  Working women have 
seen a steady reduction in the wage-gap 
and a 30 percent 
increase 
in 
their 
contributions to household income (which 
now stands at an average 35 percent).  
Notably, the reductions in the wage-gap 
include the impact of not only rising 
education levels among women – for each 
additional year of education, women are 
earning 15 percent more income (versus 10 percent in the previous decade – but also a change in 
perceptions about women’s employment.

5. 
Nevertheless, women’s labor force participation still remains as low – at around 50 
percent – as a decade ago.  As shown in Chart 1, education is an important driver, with 
participation flat for women with less than 6 years of education but rising sharply thereafter.  The 
national averages also reveal a sharp difference between rural and urban areas with rural women 
aged 35-39 averaging 42 percent participation versus their urban counterparts at 72 percent (in 
2009).  Meanwhile, recent reductions in poverty in Nicaragua between 2005 and 2009 have been 
concentrated in low-income, informal work in which women are even more likely to be 
employed.  Consumption in the growing number of female-headed households still remains 
around 10 percent lower than that for households headed by men.  Finally, while unemployment 
rates are similar by gender, they are 20 percent higher for younger, less educated women than the 
national rate.    

6. 
Health and civil protection.  Among Nicaraguan women, fertility levels have been 
falling, while progress in reducing the comparatively very high levels of maternal mortality has 
been moderate.  Institutional advances have been broadening access to maternal health services, 
including the Government 2007 policy of free public healthcare, development of the family and 
community health services model and public support for Nicaragua’s famous casas maternas.22  
Contraceptive prevalence rate is moderately high, at 72 percent, well above the average for 
countries with similar income levels, 43 percent.  In 2011, 72 percent of births were attended by 
skilled health staff, which is lower than the world average of 82 percent, but equivalent to 
countries with similar income levels, 73 percent.   However, this coverage shows a strong 
variation by income quintiles:  while 95 percent of all deliveries in the richest quintile are 
attended by a trained doctor, the percentage drops to 56 percent among poor women.  
Meanwhile, adolescent fertility rates in Nicaragua are still the highest in Latin American and 

21 The most recent living standards measurement survey in Nicaragua was 2009. 
22 From these casa maternas, networks of community volunteers identify pregnant women in remote areas and bring 
them an array of services, including pre-natal checkups, birthing plans, and post-natal follow-up. Around the time of 
delivery, the women stay in the casas maternas, usually located near health units, and receive additional support, 
such as help with breast feeding, early parenting skills and family planning. 

38 

 
                                                            
 
 
 
among the highest in the world.   At 110.5 for every 1,000 girls, it is twice the world average of 
49.4 and well above the 59.5 for the same income countries (2009).   

7. 
Gender-based violence is still a serious problem in Nicaragua.   The Demographic and 
Health Survey (DHS 1997/98) revealed that 28 percent of women who were or had been once 
married had been physically abused by their partner at least once, and 10 percent had been 
sexually abused (DHS Report 2002).  In 2011, there were at least 82 deaths from gender violence 
and 25,600 complaints of violations against women.  In 2007, the National Commission on 
Violence against Women, Children and Young Persons for which the Nicaraguan Institute for 
Women serves as executive secretariat was established, to address that problem.    

8. 
Given the gradual progress on other fronts, the Government has identified three key 
challenges for the future: adolescent fertility, early childhood education and gender-based 
violence.  Given the correlations between teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality, lower 
education achievement and poor labor market outcomes, improving early reproductive health 
among women in Nicaragua has the potential to be a key driver in gender outcomes. Meanwhile, 
the Government’s new strategy on early childhood education has the potential to provide 
childcare solutions to more rural families for whom this service is scarce. Finally gender-based 
violence remains a problem as evidenced by comparatively high homicide rates for women. The 
authorities have just passed a new law with broad public support that should provide a boost to 
ongoing efforts by civil society and the security forces to address this issue. 

9. 
Bank Program.  At the end of the last CPS, 13 projects were rated “gender-informed” as 
having been based on gender analysis, including gender sensitive/targeted actions or monitoring 
and evaluation.   Table 1 below shows a mapping of these projects to the priority areas of the 
LAC Gender Strategy, while Table 2 shows the Nicaragua program implementation of 
monitorable actions indicators and targets in the IDA16 Gender commitments.

The indicators were adopted and harmonized with the respective sectors in November 2011. The Transition 
Plan’s Three-Year Road Map proposed additional indicators for access to finance to be monitored by IFC: Number 
of loans disbursed to women and men by IFC clients; value of all loans disbursed to women and men by IFC clients; 
active number of microfinance loan accounts disaggregated by sex.

Annex 4.  Nicaragua: Summary Governance Review 

1. 
The trends on governance in Nicaragua over the last decade and a half have been mixed 
(see figure below).  There has been some improvement in political stability; little change in 
regulatory quality, rule of law, government effectiveness and control of corruption; and steady 
deterioration 
in 
voice 
and 
accountability. 
 The country 
remains below the averages for 
lower middle income countries (a 
group recently joined) in all areas 
except for regulatory quality. 

2. 
Voice and accountability. 
The bases are in place for voice 
and accountability to strengthen 
governance. Nicaraguan society is 
characterized 
by 
significant 
participation 
in 
social 
organizations, community actions 
and volunteering, particularly by 
social groups that are traditionally 
excluded (women, indigenous and 
rural communities). 
 Over 30 
percent of the population report 
being a member of a CSO 
(compared 
to membership 
in 
political parties at 10 percent and trade unions at 3 percent. Access to information is guaranteed 
by the Access to Public Information Law approved in 2007.   Nicaragua has improved its score 
in the Open Budget Index from 21 in 2006 to 37 in 2010 on par with the Central America 
average.  Nicaragua publishes a budget proposal, mid and year end reports but in general these 
are not comprehensive and do not provide an adequate basis for the public to judge performance. 
The government is working toward preparing financial assets/liabilities reports, while overall 
central government balance sheets, as well as audit reports are still pending.  

3. 
However, the potential for strong voice and accountability remains constrained.  
Implementation of the 2007 Access to Public Information has been suffered by a general decline 
in transparency at the ministerial level in public programs.   Most importantly lack of timely and 
accurate information on key development outcomes and institutional performance limit 
effectiveness of the law, even if well implemented.  Budget oversight provided by Nicaragua’s 
legislature and Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) also remains weak.24  The Comptroller 
General’s Office (CGRN), responsible for auditing all government entities, has limited resources 
and in fact does not carry out audits of most SOEs. Moreover, CGRN’s external audit review 
process as it is currently designed represents a significant bottleneck, preventing the public from 

24 IBP, Open Budget Index, 2010, Nicaragua.  

42 

 
 
 
                                                            
receiving timely SOE financial statements. In addition, checks and balances on the executive 
continue to be weak in Nicaragua, because appointments to key oversight institutions such as the 
judiciary, the Comptroller General Office and the Supreme Electoral Council remain politicized.  

4. 
Political stability and absence of violence.    Nicaragua saw a significant improvement in 
its WGI indicators on political stability around the millennium but still ranks comparatively low. 
Even after elevated political tensions surrounding municipal elections in 2009, a constitutional 
challenge in 2010 to allow the then President to run for a third term and general elections in 
2011, approval ratings for the President are the highest in Central America at 61 percent.25   
Confidence on basic institutions is also on the increase, as shown in Table 1. The ruling party 
now holds both the presidency and majority in the legislature. The conduct of upcoming 
municipal elections (2012) will test the capacity of the political actors to come an agreement on 
the fundamental of political transparency.  Meanwhile, Nicaragua remains relatively free of the 
levels of violence that have plagued the Northern Triangle, w sharing the lowest homicide rates 
in the region with Costa Rica.  Periodic violent clashes do occur however in the Northern 
Atlantic region mainly related to unresolved land claims.

5. 
Government effectiveness. Nicaragua 
ranks 
lowest 
among Central American 
countries on this measure in the WGIs, but 
survey data26 point to comparatively high and 
improving approval ratings on public services.  
In 
terms of 
the public administration, 
Nicaragua benefits 
from a sound 
legal 
framework for the Civil Service Law but has yet to emerge from a long tradition of blurred lines 
between political and executive functions.  These appear to have been exacerbated in recent 
years, with more overt use of state appointments and resources for political purposes.

In terms of policy formulation and 
implementation, Nicaragua has seen steady 
improvements 
in 
public 
financial 
management 
over 
the 
last 
few 
administrations, with a Medium Term 
Expenditure Framework is now in place in 
all central government and decentralized 
agencies, and has served to strengthen the 
links between planning and budgeting.  The 
modernization of 
the current 
financial 
management information system II is underway and should help to strengthen these links further, 
and also improve budget execution and reporting. Implementation of government policies in this 
and previous administrations has been rather robust.  The variances between budget plans and 
execution have been small and reducing, while implementation rates of government-executed 
development projects for both the Bank and the larger Inter-American Development Bank are

above average for the region.  There remain serious weaknesses in terms of monitoring and 
evaluation, transparency of public programs and external audit by the Comptroller General.   

7. 
Regulatory quality. Nicaragua has maintained a 
sound macroeconomic framework for several years and 
the trade regime has benefited from implementation of 
the DR-CAFTA agreement, but continued weaknesses in 
customs administration raise the cost of exports and 
reduce the country’s competitiveness.  Nicaragua has 
also seen its ease of Doing Business rank decline from 
56 in 2005 to 122 in 2011 as other countries have made 
greater progress in streamlining business regulations.  
Table 2 shows the most problematic areas as reported by 
firms in the World Bank-IFC 2010 Enterprise Survey.  
According to the Heritage Foundation, “Land reforms 
have led to [some] improvements in the protection of 
property rights”27, an assessment that is confirmed by the 
progress made under the Bank’s Land Administration 
project. In terms of corporate governance, a recent 
Report on Standards and Codes on accounting, financial 
reporting and auditing practices notes that Nicaragua is converging with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in its financial sector and moving toward adopting IFRS in other 
sectors.

However, reports of “land invasions” and “land takings” that are either politically or 
judicially sanctioned continue.  Finally, the legal and institutional framework for anti-trust and 
competition is rudimentary, and firms continue to rank “informal practices by others” as high 
among obstacles to doing business. In addition, the quality of SME financial reporting tends to 
be quite low and insufficiently standardized28  and the financial reporting and audit processes 
within SOEs require significant improvement. Some SOEs do not undergo any external audit. 

9. 
Control of corruption.   Nicaragua has a well-developed legislative framework that 
criminalizes acts of corruption, but the implementing institutional framework is weak and the 
political will is waning.  After tackling high levels of corruption being major theme of the 
current administration’s earlier political campaign in 2006, it did not feature much in the recent 
elections.  No prosecutions of high-level politicians or officials for corruption have taken place 
since 2007.  Meanwhile, members of the National Assembly enjoy immunity from prosecution.

Chart 1: Direct family experience of corruption (% of 
those responding yes) 

10. 
Surveys suggest that corruption is more 
of an issue for business than for households. The 
2010 Enterprise Survey lists corruption as the 
fifth largest obstacle to doing business (same as 
in 2006), whereas household reports of direct 
experience with corruption is comparatively low 
and falling (Chart xx).    A larger share of firms 
report corruption as a major constraint than in 
several comparator groups of countries and cite 
arbitrariness and discrimination in taxation and 
customs procedures, as well as a lack of 
professionally trained tax and customs officials.  
The handful of INT cases 
in 
the Bank 
procurement over the previous CPS period were 
generally attributed to wrongdoing by bidding firm and have resulted in a few disbarments, while 
the two cases of mis-procurement reflect deep capacity limitations in the public administration.   
Although, Nicaragua does stand out with respect to judicial corruption, the household survey 
Percepción de Corrupción 2009 conducted by General Prosecutor's office found that two out of 
five citizens perceive the judiciary to be corrupt.  As a result, one of the most serious obstacles 
for investors in Nicaragua is the difficulty in resolving commercial disputes in courts, 
particularly concerning the enforcement of commercial contracts.

Risks  

Between 2007 and 2011 the Nicaraguan economy grew at an average of 2.8% per year, in line 
with the average for Central America. The social context has made progress in reducing levels of 
poverty and inequality, but still has major challenges to address, especially in rural areas. Thus, 
42.5% of the population lives in poverty and 14.6% in extreme poverty.  

The IDB is the main source of external financing in Nicaragua and a leading institution of 
multiannual and multisectorial schemes. During the last years, IDB’s support has been focused 
on: i) Energy (20.23%); ii) Fiscal and Municipal Management (19.50%); iii) Social Protection 
and Health (19.42%); iv) Environment and Rural Development (13.81%); and v) Transport 
(11%).  The current portfolio29 comprises 31 sovereign guaranteed loans for a total available 
amount of US$367 million, 26 operations of the Multilateral Investment Fund for a total of 
US$16.5 million, and 45 technical cooperation interventions worth US$18.8 million. The loan 
portfolio with sovereign guarantee focuses on the following sectors: Energy (27%), Transport 
(11%), Social Protection (17%), Environment Rural Development (17.8%), and Water and 
Sanitation (11.7%). 

The IDB strategy for Nicaragua (2012-2017) aims to help the country to overcome some of the 
main growth challenges and to improve the living conditions of the population, specifically those 
in the rural areas. The main areas of support will be: Energy, Transport, Health, Social 
Protection, and Rural Development. Additionally, the IDB will include in its programs the 
following cross-cutting topics: gender, diversity and climate change and natural disasters. 
Regional integration will be promoted through actions within transport and energy sectors. Rural 
development, energy, and transport will be areas of collaboration with the World Bank.  

During the implementation of the country strategy, the Bank will continue promoting the use of 
the Country Systems, and strengthening the institutional and fiduciary capacities of executing 
agencies. Moreover, the Bank plans to adapt the design and implementation of programs 
according to local capabilities with the aim of improving portfolio execution, and continue 
monitoring development results.  

The main risks identified are: i) limited execution capacities of local counterparts, which may 
slow portfolio's performance, hence affecting the impact of IDB's interventions; and ii) the 
contraction of concessional resources which could bring changes in the grants to loans flows, 
hence increasing the country's vulnerability to possible reductions from these sources. To 
mitigate these risks, the Bank: i) will support institutional strengthening actions that lead to the 
identification of new schemes of programs design and implementation, adapted to local 
capabilities; ii) Bank's interventions will have a greater sectoral focus and donor coordination to 
maximize the flow of development aid.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. The FY2008-2012 CPS was implemented in period of unanticipated challenges.   
Within one month of the approval of the CPS, Nicaragua was hit by category 5 Hurricane 
Felix. A few months later the country suffered the affects of the food price crisis, the 
global financial crisis, unprecedented oil price spikes and the H1N1 pandemic.  During 
the CPS period, the country also experienced a series of alternating droughts and flooding 
associated with an abbreviated El Niño/La Nina cycles.  These developments, together 
with a shifting institutional landscape, created both challenges and opportunities for the 
Bank program.   

2. The Bank program responded with appropriate flexibility both to the new 
challenges and shifts in government priorities.  Additional resources were mobilized to 
respond to several of these crises, while close supervision and dialogue helped to resolve 
delays in ongoing project implementation.  Later, in the face of growing governance 
risks, the Bank shifted resources from development policy lending to social sectors, 
primarily, where institutional developments at the technical level allowed for the creation 
and consolidation of new, innovative models in service delivery.   

3. Notwithstanding these changes, the CPS program was moderately satisfactory.   
Results targeted in the CPS were generally achieved, except in the area of governance.  
Following the global financial crisis, economic growth averaged 4.6 percent from 2010-
11.  Poverty and inequality have fallen, particularly in rural areas.  Access to key 
infrastructure services has improved, in particular for the rural poor.  Meanwhile, 
progress on the social MDGs has continued, albeit very slowly.  More recently, the 
authorities have made significant and promising adjustments to the models of social 
service delivery.  However, a key remaining challenge is to strengthen the monitoring 
and measurement of program results, to establish a more routine evaluation of program 
interventions, and to raise the general transparency of development programs and 
outcomes.   

4. Bank performance was satisfactory. As the Government’s development strategy 
evolved, the Bank was able to adapt projects to focus on small producers and rural 
households, without sacrificing the technical quality of the supported interventions. 
Throughout the CPS period, the Bank devoted adequate management attention, 
manpower and administrative resources to resolve implementation challenges.   When 
crises hit, the Bank responded swiftly to identify additional financing opportunities and to 
modify the CPS – as reflected in the Progress Report.  Later, the reallocation of resources 

61 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from budget support allowed to scale up successful programs, rather than adding new 
projects, and helped to improve implementation rates and consolidate the portfolio. 

5. The CPS implementation shows that the flexibility to respond to crises and 
emerging opportunities can be managed effectively in order to maintain progress on 
the original program goals.  However, within crisis response and other program 
changes, it is important to maintain avenues for high level policy dialogue on key sectors, 
to not sacrifice the requirements of good M&E throughout the portfolio and to avoid the 
proliferation of too many small operations. The flexibility also to scale up on-going 
programs was also key to achieving program goals.  
II.    DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES  

6. During the CPS period from 2008 to 2012, Nicaragua had to weather a range of 
different crises – external and internal.  The external ones included a category 5 
hurricane on the Atlantic coast weeks after Board discussion of the CPS, followed by the 
global economic crises, H1N1 pandemic and shorter, more dramatic cycles of the El 
Niño/La Niña weather systems in the following years.  Internally, the new administration, 
having been out of power for over a decade, took some time to develop its new strategy 
with the added political difficulty of having only minority representation in the 
legislature.  Criticism of the mid-term municipal elections as well as the President’s 
constitutional challenge to run for a third term elevated political tensions in the country.  
At the same time, earlier gains on transparency in government programs were undone.  
Following the national election in 2011, the same ruling party now dominates the 
legislature with a qualified majority.    

7. The authorities, however, continued what Nicaragua’s recent track record of 
maintaining sound macroeconomic policies during the CPS period.  These efforts 
helped to sustain growth, albeit at moderate rates, raise foreign direct investment, and 
garner support from the private sector.  After the global financial crisis of 2008-09, 
economic growth resumed, averaging 4.6 percent 2010-11.   Following some limited 
countercyclical fiscal policies during the crisis, the authorities have continued with fiscal 
consolidation, helped in part by the series of tax reforms that steadily improved revenue 
performance.  Rapid export growth fueled by the long upswing in commodity prices and 
preferential access to Venezuelan markets has helped to sustain growth. As such, this 
export growth remains vulnerable to shifts in the terms of trade and changes in existing 
international agreements.  

8. On the structural side, the Government focused on redressing persistent inequalities 
and the limited progress on poverty reduction by reorienting its programs toward 
direct support for poor households and small producers.  In service delivery, these 
included an early policy change toward free access to public education and primary 
health care.  The government also shifted away from support to the larger productive 
sector in traditional and maquila exports toward programs aimed at food security and 
subsistence production, microfinance and micro- and small enterprise development.    

62 

 
 
9. After little change during 2002-05, poverty and inequality fell from 2005-09, 
particularly in very poor rural areas, as measured by the Living Standards 
Measurement Surveys. Since then, a smaller survey instrument repeated annually 
between 2009 and 2011 indicates that the broad trend in poverty reduction has continued.  
When one disaggregates the causes, economic growth and in particular increases in 
agricultural incomes among poor families has been the major contributor to poverty 
reduction.  Nevertheless, over 40 percent of Nicaraguans remain poor and high levels of 
inequality persist between rural and urban access to basic services.  

10. Nicaragua’s social indicators are improving, but generally at a slow rate.  The 
assessment of the pace of progress in social areas has been complicated by lack of robust, 
timely data and transparent measurement of results.  Nicaragua made notable progress in 
reducing infant mortality (achieving its targets), net school enrollment and access to 
water, whereas progress on maternal mortality, primary school completion, and chronic 
nutrition are either slow or unclear.  Likewise, large rural-urban gaps persist and while 
existing measurements suggest that these are reducing, it is not clear whether the pace is 
sufficient to achieve the goals set by the authorities.   More recently, the authorities have 
made significant and promising adjustments to the models of social service delivery.   

11. Another key development in the CPS period includes the resolution of technical 
shortages in electricity supply, the maintenance of broadly open dialogue with the 
private sector and success in attracting foreign direct investment.  In 2007 the new 
government moved quickly to use Venezuela oil cooperation to resolve long standing 
energy shortages by investing in thermal generation, and is now focused on raising FDI 
to shift the generation matrix toward a greater share in renewables.  Nevertheless, key 
imbalances remain in the electricity sector financing which have only been temporarily 
mitigated using resources from the Venezuela oil cooperation and require a longer term 
solution.  The dialogue with the private sector on key economic and political issues is 
being maintained as are strong efforts to promote more FDI.   

12. Finally, governance challenges emerged during the CPS period.  Controversies 
surrounding the municipal elections in 2009 resulted in the suspension of budget support 
and reduction of other aid flows by several bilateral donors.  The authorities have 
compensated for much of the lost resources with large private flows of aid and 
investment from Venezuelan oil cooperation.  Later, the President’s constitutional 
challenge to run for a third term further elevated political tensions in the country.  The 
authorities have since undone much of the earlier gains in transparency of government 
programs.30  Following the national election in 2011, the ruling party now dominates the 
legislature as well with a qualified majority.   The Government has yet to articulate its 
new program, but it is expected that this program will retain its primary goal of providing 
direct support to poor households and small rural producers, but with an added focus on 
productivity improvements to raise incomes.  The Government is also expected to 
maintain sound macroeconomic policies and seek a new IMF program.  

30 A notable example is that the Ministry of Education has not published its annual statistical report since 2009.

II. 

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

13. The CPS program was able to meet most of its outcome targets, although measurement 
challenges remain.  The authorities maintained an adequate macroeconomic framework 
that helped to underpin growth, and support poverty reduction.   Nicaragua saw a stronger 
decline in inequality and poverty, particularly in rural areas, where much of the program 
support was targeted.  However, lack of agreement over key policies limited results in the 
governance and accountability agenda.  

A. 

CPS Pillar One: Reactivating the Economy, Stimulating Productivity and 
Competitiveness 

14. This CPS Pillar supported the (a) maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic framework 
for growth and poverty reduction; (b) diversification and promotion of value-added in the 
micro and SME sectors; (c) improvements in land tenure security; (d) increased 
agricultural productivity and sustainable use of natural resources. 

15. Throughout the CPS period, Nicaragua’s macroeconomic performance was good, as 
reflected in a stable rating of 4.2 in the CPIA macroeconomic cluster.  After 
averaging 4.0 percent during 2003-07, economic growth recuperated following the 
2008-09 global economic crisis, averaging 4.6 percent over 2010-11. A significant but 
limited fiscal impulse during the crisis helped strengthen domestic demand.  Since then, 
central government fiscal balances have returned to surplus in part owing to steady 
improvements in revenue performance over the CPS period.  After an increase in 2009, 
public debt, including its external component, has gradually declined.   The central bank 
also adopted supportive measures and the financial sector has remained stable, although 
credit to the private sector declined sharply and has yet to fully recover.  Inflation has 
been largely under control since its spike in 2008, in part anchored by Nicaragua’s 
crawling peg.   Despite buoyant remittances and strong export growth, the current 
account deficit remains chronically high dominated by the oil bill. It has been offset by 
improvements in loans and FDI (including the significant flows from Venezuela), 
resulting in a notable improvement in international reserves.   

16. The CPS aimed to deepen the impact growth on poverty outcomes by supporting 
microfinance and microenterprise development, improving productivity of small 
agricultural producers, and strengthening land tenure.   After little movement during the 
first half of the decade, poverty in Nicaragua declined from 48 to 43 percent between 
2005 and 2009.  These gains were accompanied by a moderate decline in inequality and 
in the severity of poverty.  They were also concentrated in rural areas where the poverty 
rates are highest.  Economic growth was the principle factor in these developments 
through 2009.   However, much of the income growth was concentrated in informal 
sector, in the lower productivity agricultural sector, and among workers with little or no 
education.   

17. Strong advances were achieved 
in 
land tenure security and agricultural 
productivity.  Almost 20 percent of national territory has been titled and registered, 
including 15 indigenous territories representing the majority of the Atlantic region, based 

64 

 
 
on an improved national legislation.  Meanwhile, modernization of the cadastre-registry 
processes has now yielded significant reductions in the time and cost of registration 
procedures, and is reflected in an improvement in Nicaragua’s ranking on this Doing 
Business indicator from 151 to 122 in 2011. Under the 2nd Agriculture Technology 
Project, over 34,000 farmers have adopted improved production or processing 
technologies, yielding on average a 38 percent increase in yields on basic grains.  
However, while these advances have been focused on food security, Nicaragua has seen a 
stagnating and in some cases declining productivity in yields on agricultural exports.      

18. Progress on microfinance and microenterprise development has been mixed, in 
large part due to policy reversals and weak implementation. The WBG made a 
positive contribution to increasing the access to finance for small and medium urban and 
rural MSMEs, with the share women receiving financing rising. This happened despite 
the government legally sanctioning a non-payment movement that arose in the large 
microfinance sector (20 percent of financial sector assets) in 2009 when the crisis hit after 
a period of rapid credit growth. However, continued dialogue between the government, 
the WBG and the IMF contributed to new legislation that strengthened the regulatory 
framework and helped reverse the large retrenchment in microfinance assets in 2010. On 
the microenterprise side, significant delays in the implementation of the MSME project 
make it too early to see any results from the development of a small business matching 
grants program.  In retrospect, this project was launched as too large a program and 
arguably it would have been preferable to begin working at a smaller, pilot scale. An 
array of other improvements have been made to the business registration and some key 
inspection processes, but these have not been sufficient to prevent Nicaragua’s ranking 
on the majority of Doing Business indicators from deteriorating over the CPS period and 
the associated loss in the competitiveness of the local business climate.   

B. 

CPS Pillar Two: Pro-Poor investment in delivery of basic services 

19. This CPS Pillar was combined (at the Progress Report stage) to include both social and 
infrastructure services, and focused on rural areas where poverty is highest in Nicaragua.  
Combined, it accounted for two-thirds of the CPS lending program.  In the area of basic 
services — health, education, water and sanitation – progress has been achieved in 
project activities, targets and goals.  Other infrastructure services – electrification, 
telecom, and roads – have achieved the goals laid out in the CPS.   While significant 
progress was made in terms of institutional development, overall development outcomes 
remain unclear due to persistent weaknesses in monitoring MDG performance in 
Nicaragua and updating key indicators.   

20. In education, a major change in policy orientation of the new government, which took 
some time to evolve, presented key challenges for measurement of program results.   
Even so, the shift to universal free primary education in 2007 did raise access and 
accelerated increases in primary enrolment.  The CPS program helped to maintain these 
enrolments over time by providing emergency financing for the national school feeding 
program from various sources (IDA and trust funds) during the food price crisis.  
Meanwhile, the Bank refocused the project toward improving quality with the reform of 
key primary level curricula, provision of new textbooks to all primary schools, and the 

65 

 
 
design and implementation of a learning assessment program.  The complementary MDG 
of primary completion rates also advanced but is still short of the targeted levels.  
Completion rates, together with a new thrust in early childhood education, are now the 
main focus of Nicaragua’s new education strategy, which was prepared and is being 
implemented with Bank support.   

21. In contrast, the policy stability in health care – the administration has been consolidating 
the long-standing model of basic benefits package with emphasis on preventative care at 
the family and community level – delivered some clear progress on both infant and 
maternal health in particular in improving access to care and reducing risk factors.  While 
this progress is clearly reflected in falling infant mortality rates, measured reductions in 
chronic child malnutrition and maternal mortality rates have been more elusive.  
Meanwhile, the Bank program assisted Nicaragua to mitigate the H1N1 pandemic while 
strengthening its preparedness for future epidemiological emergencies.  

22. The remainder of this component focused on access to basic infrastructure services, 
predominantly in rural areas.  Despite the implementation delays in the majority of the 6 
projects in this area, the Bank program helped in significantly to raise access of rural 
households to telephony, electricity and improved roads, at the same time reducing the 
rural-urban gaps in access.  In addition, each of these programs pioneered innovations in 
service delivery –through the use of small private sector providers in telecom and rural 
off-grid electricity, and through large scale community works and road maintenance 
programs, and a low-cost road building technique in the rural road construction.  The 
more recent programs in water and sanitation are now beginning to yield results both in 
rural and urban areas, also with innovations in twinning civil works with social awareness 
programs for hygiene, water conservation and services sustainability.  Again, a key 
challenge remains in the area of measurement of the improvements in access, nationwide, 
as well as the ensuing impact on the communities in a sustainable way.  

C. 

CPS Pillar Three: Strengthening governance and accountability 

23. This CPS pillar was aimed at improving the capacity of the public sector in Nicaragua by 
continuing efforts to strengthen civil service management, planning and financial 
management; as well as social accountability.  By the time of the CPS Progress Report, 
the new administration had begun stalling the overall public sector reform agenda and 
adopting a more narrow focus on public financial management.  However, the CPS 
Progress Report did not revise the governance agenda and results driven by the 
expectation that the on-going dialogue would lead to a resumption of the pace of work on 
public sector reform. At the end, implementation of civil service reform was never 
extended to the broader public sector and was dropped as a CPS outcome at the time of 
the Progress Report.  Some progress was made on wage bill management, particularly in 
the social sectors where wage scales were rationalized to open fiscal space for future 
salary increases when fiscal space allows.  However, these were complicated by the 
annual off-budget wage bonuses financed through the non-sovereign Venezuelan 
cooperation flows.    

66 

 
 
24. Meanwhile, the focus on PFM has yielded progress in the rollout of the Medium Term 
Expenditure Framework to all central government and decentralized agencies, beyond the 
CPS outcome targets, and has served to strengthen the links between planning and 
budgeting.  The development of a new SIGFA II was delayed until the preparation of the 
follow-up PMSAF project in 2010 and so far system requirements have been agreed upon 
and the bidding process is just getting underway.  However, little else was achieved in 
terms of strengthening monitoring and evaluation, transparency of public programs and 
external audit by the Comptroller General.  Finally, the CPS outcomes on social 
accountability and decentralization of the public investment planning were dropped 
because of a change in approach by the new administration to decentralization.  Instead, 
the authorities have put in place a network of Citizen Councils from the community up 
through national levels of government. These have achieved an increase in social 
participation in government activities in many sectors, but they also suffer from some 
criticism of being highly politicized. 

III. BANK PERFORMANCE 

A. 

Program Design 

25. The CPS FY08-FY12 was prepared during the first six months of the new administration 
and before the Government had articulated its general development strategy, which took 
over two years.  As such, the CPS was based in part on the strategic framework 
articulated in the Economic and Financial Program of the IMF PRGF/ECF program. 
However, as the administration matured, several policy shifts emerged which posed 
critical implementation issues for a number of ongoing projects, particularly those which 
engaged the private sector in public service delivery, as well as the use of conditional 
cash transfers31 to households and matching grants to firms.  The highest risks to the 
program were attributed to natural disasters and electricity sector issues, while risks of 
macroeconomic instability, weak institutional capacity and inadequate donor alignment 
and harmonization were rated as moderate.     

B. 

Program Implementation 

26. There were 
significant modifications 
to 
the 
lending program during 
implementation.  The Bank program was adjusted in response to unexpected crises.  Of 
the 15 new projects approved during the CPS period, only five of them were planned in 
the CPS and three in the CPS Progress Report.   Meanwhile, the Bank planned to commit 
around US$240 million at the CPS (and US$274 million at the Progress Report in 
December 2009), but finally mobilized new IDA commitments of just under $300 
million32, and roughly additional $45 million in trust funds.  

31 The authorities originally rejected the idea of conditioning cash transfers on school attendance, viewed more as a 
social obligation, and later accepted the use of family grants to promote attendance at parenting/other workshops.  
32 This included $17 million cancelled from the IDA14 FY07 lending program and reallocated in FY08, an 
additional $14.3 from the IDA15 Crisis Window, front-loading of $15million from the IDA16 indicative allocation 
for FY13, and supplementary grants for H1N1Response and the GFPR Additional Finance for the 2nd Agriculture 
Technology project.   

67 

 
 
                                                            
27. In addition to the external volatilities, the program faced a number of internal 
challenges.  The new administration’s evolving policy and institutional agendas delayed 
the preparation of the planned development lending operations, delayed implementation 
and required extensive restructuring in several projects, and held back the release of a 
number of key economic and sector studies.  Eventually, the ongoing projects accelerated 
into a robust implementation pace and achieved solid results on the ground, particularly 
for rural poverty reduction.  The programmed series of four DPLs was reduced to only 
one operation that responded to the global economic crisis.  The DPL series was 
eventually suspended because of lack of agreement over policy reforms related to 
governance and transparency.   

28. The authorities and the Bank were quick to make use of the resources from budget 
support for additional investment lending.  There were two important impacts of this 
shift.  A first impact of the shift to investment lending in the Bank program was a 
renewed emphasis on social sectors which responded to the emergence of an integrated 
strategic framework and the gradual consolidation of service delivery models in health, 
education and social protection under the new administration.  Second, however, was that 
the cessation of budget support by the Bank and bilateral donors resulted in loss of donor-
coordinated engagement in specific policy dialogues with the authorities. Even though 
there remains strong donor coordination in investment programs, e.g. in rural 
electrification, urban water and sanitation, agriculture, education and health, the 
willingness to, and practicality of, engaging in high level policy dialogue (as opposed to 
technical discussions) under these operations does not happen in practice.   

29. IFC’s portfolio in Nicaragua achieved significant growth, in line with its global 
objective to focus more on IDA countries.  During 2008-12, IFC-syndicated financing 
totaled almost $400 million (of which $245 million were IFC’s own investments) in 22 
projects.  This compares with only $15 million in two projects in the years before the 
CPS period.  Today, the portfolio includes projects in a range of sectors, from 
agribusiness which has a 48 percent share, to renewable energy with 32 percent, and the 
financial sector at 15 percent.  The most notable investment during the CPS was the 
award-winning 72 MW geothermal installation at San Jacinto-Tizate, in which IFC’s 
investment of $50 million helped catalyze $140 million from other international 
development banks.  San Jacinto Central provides more than 15 percent of Nicaragua’s 
energy needs and supports the Government strategy of switching the generation matrix 
toward renewables.  

30. For IFC’s Advisory Services, the strategic focus on Nicaragua during the period FY08-12 
continued around the core strategic themes: business climate (IFC worked with the 
municipal scorecard for a number of years), access to finance (development of new 
mortgage and SME lending products, and support for leasing regulation), and the rural 
agribusiness sector (farmer extension services and sustainability topics, in particular in 
coffee and forestry).  Key project highlights include Sustainable Forestry (2008-12); with 
two projects in sustainable forestry benefiting 4 indigenous communities to promote a 
business approach in community forestry; support to 8 municipalities in making business 
licensing and operating simpler and various projects helping 13,000 farmers in the region 
link into premium markets for sustainable coffee. 
68 

 
 
 
IV. RATING 

31. The CPS program is rated moderately satisfactory. The IDA and IFC programs 
achieved substantial development results in agricultural productivity (in basic grains and 
coffee), land administration and titling, roads, telecommunications and electricity. These 
achievements contributed to a commensurate reduction in rural poverty. While more 
modest, advances were also made in the health, education and microfinance services 
outcomes, particularly in building an institutional framework for the future.  However, in 
the area of governance and accountability, there was little progress outside of some 
improvements 
in public 
financial management. Together with 
the 
fact 
that 
macroeconomic policy stability has helped to provide a good basis for past and future 
growth, the sum of program results can only be deemed moderately satisfactory.33 

32. The World Bank Group performance is rated satisfactory.  As the Government’s 
development strategy evolved, the Bank was able to adapt projects to focus on small 
producers and rural households, without sacrificing the technical quality of the supported 
interventions.  Throughout the CPS period, the Bank devoted adequate management 
attention, manpower and administrative resources to resolve implementation challenges.  
When crises hit, the Bank responded swiftly and flexibly to identify additional financing 
and modify the CPS – as reflected in the Progress Report.  Later, the move away from 
budget support proved to be an appropriate measure in view of the subsequent 
controversy over deterioration in political accountability.  And the decision to reallocate 
budget support to scaling up proven programs, rather than adding new projects, helped to 
raise implementation rates while consolidating the portfolio.    In turn, the IFC’s 
involvement in the country grew significantly going from 2 to 22 projects over a wide 
range of sectors, mobilizing significant levels of complementary financing, and receiving 
international recognition for the design of some of the operations. 

V. 

LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

33. With a five-year CPS in a country that is vulnerable both to external shocks and 
policy shifts, the flexibility to adjust the program in response to emerging 
opportunities helps to maintain a robust program and solid results.  However, this 
will require a CPS program that includes a combination of proven interventions that have 
broad-based support, and pilot interventions to push the envelope on longer term issues.  
With this combination, it is important to maintain a strong focus on quickly resolving 
implementation challenges of the backbone programs.  At the same time, the judicious 
use of technical assistance and trust funds to test new areas is a useful pre-requisite 
before engaging in new large projects/programs.  The difficult history of the MSME 
project which launched a large multi-component project in an area in which the 
Government’s own policy agenda was evolving offers some lessons on going smaller, 
first.  

33 It should be noted that the CPS results framework did not fully capture the impact of the program because it 
omitted the achievements from efforts that respond to emerging needs or demands arising from unexpected shocks.  
Such is the case, for instance, with the response to the 2008-09 food price crisis which saw the Bank provide needed 
financing to sustain Nicaragua’s school feeding program and its impact on school attendance. 

69 

 
 
 
                                                            
34. Development of a transparent M&E systems is an important part of stimulating 
good governance and must be a priority in all IDA operations.   Despite the advances 
in many sectors, Nicaragua still faces challenges to measure the results of its ongoing 
programs and to use these measurements to effectively evaluate and refine those 
programs.  For example, there are no robust official measurement of trends in primary net 
school enrollment, access to all-weather roads, safe water and sanitation, maternal 
mortality, and chronic malnutrition, to name a few.  The UN’s Joint Monitoring Program 
and Inter-Agency Working Groups have proved useful in aligning development partners 
and ministries in some sectors around measurement methodologies, but these are not 
generally accepted as official by the authorities.  

35. The decision to shift resources from budget support to investment lending proved 
effective because of the solid implementation performance of the core projects;  
however, moving forward, the Bank strategy needs to create space to maintain 
policy dialogue in key sectors.  As the options for policy reform weakened and with it 
the basis for budget support, the resources released provided complementary financing 
for innovative and scalable investment lending initiatives. This experience shows the 
importance of developing and maintaining proven investment interventions that have 
broad-based support so as to have options to channel resources when the policy agendas 
are weak. Lacking such options, resources could end up being channeled through budget 
support without a significant policy impact.    That being said, the Bank did not 
sufficiently create alternate mechanisms for advancing policy dialogue in key sectors for 
which donors still retained large financing flows.  While the expectation could have been 
that policy dialogue could continue through supervision of investment projects, in 
practice this did not occur. Supervision teams did not have sufficient resources to divert 
to addressing policy issues, particularly as they are not often critical to project 
implementation.  For example, Nicaragua still faces overarching policy issues in its 
electricity sector. Continued Bank engagement through analytical support in the energy 
sector could have been helpful, particularly in backing up IFC and other players.  

36. In crisis response, it is important to avoid the proliferation of small operations that 
later strain supervision resources and to avoid including too much focus on 
institutional development in these operations.   Over the CPS, the portfolio grew from 
11 operations in FY08 to 15 operations in FY12, while a number of simultaneous, and 
sizeable, recipient-executed trust funds stretched manpower and complicated oversight. 
On institution building, the Hurricane Felix and Emergency Food Price Response 
operations both included institution building activities which proved challenging and 
ultimately delayed the delivery of the emergency support – to address weaknesses in the 
regional governments, and to establish a new program in certified seeds, respectively.  
Nevertheless, both efforts yielded some progress on the institutional front and on which 
the authorities were able to build future programs.  In the case of Hurricane Felix, some 
planning and coordination capacities in the RAAN regional government have been 
achieved.  And a component which was cancelled from the Emergency Food Response 
later spawned Nicaragua’s national seed certification program incorporating lessons from 
the earlier design challenges. 
 Likewise, actions to strengthen epidemiological 
surveillance under the H1N1 response project have helped to create a sustainable capacity 
that proved effective in later outbreaks of H1N1 and other communicable diseases.   

70 

 
 
37. Consolidating the portfolio around key lines of action can leverage results even with 
modest resources.  Towards the end of the CPS period, the Bank focused its efforts in a 
few key sectors through combining ongoing investment lending with technical assistance 
to provide support to the Government in designing sector strategies. This has resulted in a 
role for the Bank in helping to leverage additional resources to finance well designed 
scalable programs.  Experience in the education sector for example is currently being 
replicated in water and sanitation. The long term expectation is that consolidating the 
portfolio further in key strategic areas will help to foster better results and improve 
coordination with key development partners. 

38. Any future engagement with the Autonomous Regions should focus mainly on 
building out institutional capacity in regional and local governments and not on 
proliferating small community development type of investments.  The recent 
experiences have proven that the lack of a clear institutional framework assigning clear 
roles and responsibilities among the regional, municipal and territorial governments 
needs to be addressed before those authorities can effectively guide development in those 
regions.  In light of this, when central government programs extend to these regions, 
there is still a tendency to focus on those interventions that do not require complex 
engagement by the regional authorities.  Other development partners have concentrated 
on geographically focused CDD operations, but given the challenges of working with 
territories with limited access, capacity and markets, this is not the Bank’s comparative 
advantage and the operating and supervision costs of making these types of operations 
effective with Bank regulations are prohibitive.

State Modernization Project (PSTAC I) 

The SNIP methodology changed under the new 
administration.  A network of Citizen 
Councils (instead of the Local Public 
Investment Units) are used to channel local 
needs into central government plans.   As 
such, the SNIP only registers the capital 
transfers to municipal governments.
