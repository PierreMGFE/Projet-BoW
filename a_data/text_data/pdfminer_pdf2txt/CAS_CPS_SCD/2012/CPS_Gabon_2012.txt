COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY2012-FY2016 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 

Since the World Bank Board of Directors last discussed a country assistance 
strategy (CAS) for Gabon in May 2005, significant changes have occurred in Gabon’s 
political landscape. The death of President Omar Bongo Ondimba in June 2009, after 42 
consecutive years in power, led to political and social uncertainty. Civil unrest erupted when Ali 
Bongo Ondimba, the late president’s son, won the August 2009 presidential elections. Gabon 
now appears to have passed through its transition period and is likely to remain one of the 
region’s most stable countries. However, there are still underlying tensions as reflected in the 
opposition’s boycott of the December 2011 legislative elections. 

ii. 
Gabon is the fifth-largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second-largest 
exporter of manganese. Gabon’s oil production over the past 40 years has transformed it into a 
middle-income country, with a 2010 gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$8,643 and a 
current output rate of 235,000 barrels per day. As such, Gabon is one of the few IBRD countries 
in Sub-Saharan Africa.  

iii.  However, Gabon’s human development indicators are well below those of countries 
with similar GDP per capita, and income inequality remains high. Gabon is ranked 106 out 
of 187 countries in the 2011 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human 
Development Index. Many targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including 
those relating to infant and maternal mortality, are unlikely to be achieved. The prevalence of 
HIV-AIDS, although it has declined in recent years, still remains at a high level (5.4 percent in 
2010).  

iv. While economic prospects are broadly favorable, Gabon’s economy is vulnerable to 
external shocks. Gabon is recovering from the global financial crisis (2008–09), thanks largely 
to a rebound in international demand for raw materials and an expansionary fiscal policy. 
However, its dependence on oil makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Given the 
forecast decline in oil production, Gabon’s plans to compete globally will depend largely on 
efforts to diversify economic growth. In the short term, due to the limited integration of Gabon ’s 
financial systems with Europe, the country is not expected to be significantly affected by the 
euro zone crisis. However, a protracted crisis might hold significant downside risk.  

v. 
It is no longer business as usual in Gabon. In 2009, the government introduced its 
economic development plan, the Plan Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE), with the stated goal 

v 

 
 
 
 
 
 
of transforming Gabon into an emerging economy by 2025. In 2010, the government decided to 
triple expenditure to accelerate investments in infrastructure and to improve the investment 
climate. However, the PSGE does not clearly specify how poverty will be addressed and lacks 
sufficient analytical underpinnings in this regard. Weak public financial management and 
institutional capacity also impede progress.  

vi. 
Governance is at the heart of the development challenge for Gabon. The government 
recognizes that improvements in transparency and accountability are critical if Gabon is to 
compete on a global scale. Important initiatives are under way, including efforts to reform public 
procurement. Nevertheless, indexes relating to the perception of corruption remain high.  

vii. While a number of important results were achieved under the former CAS period 
(FY05-FY09), the presidential transition resulted in uncertain future engagement with the 
World Bank Group (WBG). The vacuum in leadership at the end of the CAS period resulted in 
a small portfolio supporting two sectors, natural resource management and local infrastructure. 
In line with the formulation of the government’s new PSGE, however, the new CPS builds on 
renewed dialogue and engagement as the WBG seeks to support Gabon’s ambition to become an 
emerging economy.  

viii.  The CPS is selective and provides a framework for WBG support to Gabon’s effort 
to transition from a highly oil dependent economy to a diversified one that harnesses 
inclusive private sector growth and makes progress in poverty reduction. Consistent with 
the new World Bank Africa Strategy, the Gabon CPS is built around two strategic themes: (1) 
increasing Gabon’s competitiveness and employment by promoting economic growth and 
diversification; and (2) providing greater opportunities for all by focusing on vulnerability and 
resilience and on building a foundation for good governance and public sector capacity. Gender 
equity is the cross-cutting theme. The CPS will contribute to poverty reduction by improving the 
investment climate for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and by filling the outstanding 
knowledge gaps and analytical underpinning needed by the government as a basis for broader 
debate and policy dialogue.  

ix. 

The CPS is innovative in that it will combine partnerships, knowledge , and IBRD 

financing with a reimbursable technical service agreement (RTA) of up to US$2 million for 
2012. As requested by the government, much work under the RTA is designed to improve 
governance, including strengthening public financial management. Efforts will be undertaken to 
deepen cooperation with a wide range of partners, including on a regional basis with the 
Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC). The CPS will work closely 
with the World Bank Institute (WBI) to facilitate effective relations with civil society and with 
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA) to improve the investment climate and attract private sector investments. The CPS will 

vi 

 
 
 
 
 
develop its role as a knowledge provider to support the government in its fight against exclusion 
and vulnerability. Finally, the new lending program is more ambitious than the previous one, 
with an expected portfolio of around US$250 million over 
the next four years.

GABON – COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY2012-FY2016  

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This note presents the context and main building blocks for the World Bank 
Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Gabon over the period FY12–FY16. The 
proposed CPS follows the World Bank Group’s last country assistance strategy (CAS) that was 
discussed by the Board in May 2005 (Report No. 31882-GA). It comes at a time when the Bank 
and Gabon are reenergizing their relationship, and the government is committed to instituting 
major strategic reforms and to becoming an emerging economy. Lessons learned during the past 
CAS period have been taken into account in preparing the present CPS (see the Completion 
Report in annex 9).  

2. 
The Country Partnership Strategy reflects a demand-driven partnership, a 
transformative program that is intended to be flexible and responsive to changing client 
needs. The WBG’s convening power and role as a knowledge broker is expected to be essential, 
including plans to deepen cooperation with a wider range of traditional and nonconventional 
partners at the national, regional, and global levels. The strategy is innovative in its combination 
of IBRD financing and knowledge with a reimbursable technical services agreement (RTA) plan 
of up to US$2 million.1 IFC has also explored investment opportunities in infrastructure, 
forestry, mining, and financial markets, and MIGA will also be active in the agriculture sector. 
The rationale for this renewed dialogue and engagement between Gabon and the WBG reflects 
the recognition, on both sides, of the great value that the WBG can provide to support Gabon in 
its ambition to become an emerging economy. The renewed relationship will also elevate WBG 
impact and relevance, which have been relatively weak to date within Gabon compared to other 
development partners. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT  

A. Political Developments 

3. 
Gabon is a resource-rich country, well endowed with arable land, forest, and 
mineral resources. It has extraordinary biodiversity as well as rich deposits of magnesium and 
iron ore. It is the fifth-largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa and the second-largest exporter 
of manganese. With a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita estimated at US$8,643 in 2010, it 

1 In June 2010, the Government also signed a Reimbursable Technical Service Agreement (RTA) with the IFC for 
US$330,000 for support to improve the investment climate .

is one of Africa’s few middle-income countries. Eighty percent of its population lives in urban 
areas, predominantly in Libreville (the capital), Port-Gentil (the economic capital), and 
Franceville (the mining region). The Gabonese population is young, with 50 percent under 19 
years of age. 

4. 
Two years after the death of President Omar Bongo Ondimba in June 2009, after 42 
consecutive years in power, Gabon has come through a period of transition. The immediate 
period after the president’s death was characterized by political and social uncertainty. Defeated 
presidential candidates rejected the results announced by the electoral commission after the 
August 2009 election, and significant social unrest ensued. A poll recount, requested by the 
Constitutional Court, upheld the victory of the ruling party’s candidate, and Ali Bongo Ondimba, 
the former president’s son, was sworn in as the third elected president of the republic on October 
16, 2009. There has been limited support for Mr. Mba Obame and his self-proclaimed presidency 
(as former leader of the Union Nationale party). However, some members of the opposition still 
contest the legitimacy of Ali Bongo Ondimba’s presidency and decided to boycott the December 
2011 legislative elections, which resulted in the president’s gaining 114 of the 120 seats of the 
National Assembly. Election observers noted a particularly high abstention rate, approaching 80 
percent, in Libreville and Port-Gentil. 

5. 
Gabon plays an important economic role in Central Africa. It is an active member of 
the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC), as well as the Economic 
Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Gabon has promoted regional initiatives to 
boost the economic interrelationships among the member states of the zone, including reducing 
tariffs and removing quantitative restrictions. Since 2003, there has been some tension between 
Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in relation to a territorial dispute over three small islands in 
Corisco Bay (Mbagne, Cocotiers, and Congas), with potentially rich oil reserves. 

6. 
Beyond the region, the country is building strong links with international partners 
including China, France, and Singapore. Gabon has continued to maintain its strong ties with 
France since independence. It remains the main source of Gabon’s imports, and Gabon also hosts 
France’s military base in the region. At the same time, China has become an increasingly 
important partner of Gabon as well as with other emerging economies in Asia. In 2010, the 
government signed a strategic agreement with Singapore-based OLAM International, an 
agricultural products processor, to jointly develop a special economic zone (SEZ) at Nkok (25 
kilometers from Libreville). Over the coming years, OLAM is expected to invest over US$200 
million in initiatives linked to wood processing, palm oil plantations and a fertilizer plant.  

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Box 1: The Special Economic Zone of Nkok 
This new SEZ, inaugurated in September 2011 and situated 25 kilometers east of Libreville, is expected to 
become the largest of its kind in central Africa. The objective of the SEZ, jointly developed by the 
government of Gabon and the Singaporean firm Olam International (a global supply chain manager and 
processor of agricultural products), is to add value to the local forestry industry, the second driver of 
growth after oil. The SEZ will focus primarily on timber processing, allowing firms to gain competitive 
advantage for the Gabonese wood-processing industry for second- and third-level transformation, with a 
view to exporting high value-added timber products. Currently in its second phase of construction, when 
complete in 2014, the zone will include a processing capacity of a million cubic meters of timber per 
annum, industrial spaces equipped with appropriate infrastructure, residential and commercial zones, 
parks, hotels, a railway, and logistics. Through special incentives, the Gabonese government is expecting 
to attract several hundred million dollars of investments annually into the SEZ and to create nearly 9,000 
direct jobs. Companies that establish themselves at Nkok will benefit from various fiscal incentives , 
including tax exemptions on profits for a decade.  

B. Poverty Profile, Millennium Development Goals, and Gender  

7. 
Gabon’s human development outcomes fall short of countries with similar per 
capita income. Oil production over the past 40 years has transformed Gabon into a middle-
income country, with a 2010 GDP per capita of US$8,643, which ranks Gabon 56th in the world. 
However, income inequality is high. The richest quintile of the population receives half the 
national income; yet one-third lives in poverty. Gabon is ranked 106 out of 187 countries in the 
2011 UNDP Human Development Index, well below countries with similar GDP per capita. The 
latest national household survey, completed at the end of 2005 with WBG support, revealed an 
increase in the proportion of Gabon’s population living below the poverty line from 25 percent in 
1997 to 33 percent in 2005. Specific zones in the southern and the northern regions register the 
highest poverty rates (54 and 44 percent, respectively), followed by Port-Gentil, where the 
deteriorating poverty rate is linked to the decline in oil production (44 percent). Libreville, with 
over 50 percent of the population, has the lowest poverty rate (23 percent). Large households 
with low levels of education and weak labor skills are the poorest. Households headed by 
females, which account for 20 percent, are also more likely to be living below the poverty line 
than households headed by males. 

8. 
Despite its wealth, Gabon is unlikely to meet a number of the Millennium 
Development Goals by 2015. The third national MDG progress report, published in 2010, 
concluded that MDG targets relating to poverty reduction, infant and maternal mortality, and the 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS are unlikely to be achieved. With respect to education, Gabon has 
succeeded in making primary education available to all (net enrollment has increased from 88 
percent in 1990 to 91 percent in 2005), but the quality and the need for qualified teachers and 
classrooms remain a concern. The rates for infant mortality dropped from 155 per 1,000 in 1990 
to 52.7 per 1,000 in 2010, but it will be difficult to reach the target of 31.5 per 1 ,000 by 2015. 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although maternal mortality fell from 600 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 420 deaths in 
2010, it is also unlikely that the target of 150 deaths per 100,000 births will be achieved by 2015. 

9. 
Concerted efforts will be required for Gabon to significantly improve its social 
indicators. While efforts were made to prioritize the health and education sectors under the 
former Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP), the recent Bank-prepared Public 
Expenditure Review (PER) indicates that spending on health and education was lower than 
planned and was lower than that in Gabon’s neighboring countries.2 Slow implementation also 
points to the weak public finance management system that currently prevails. Other factors relate 
to outdated statistical information (the last household survey was undertaken in 2005) and weak 
skills in the health workforce.  

10. 
The rate of HIV/AIDS, which had risen dramatically from 0.7 percent in 1990 to 8.1 
percent in 2005, has significantly declined in recent years but remains high (5.4 percent in 
2010). Although many actions have been taken over the past years, further efforts will be 
required both by the government and by the international community to reduce the pandemic and 
monitor the particular impact HIV/AIDS is having on the economically active population and the 
economy. 

11. Gabon's constitution recognizes gender equality and the government has ratified the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. However, as 
highlighted by studies conducted by the United Nations Population Fund, several discriminatory 
provisions exist in the civil and penal codes that pertain to the minimum age of marriage, 
divorce, custody of children, equal inheritance rights of widows, and recognition of polygamy. 
Gabon also lacks specific legislation to eliminate violence against women, particularly domestic 
violence. Women in Gabon have few rights in the area of family matters. The minimum legal age 
of marriage is 15 years for women and 18 years for men, and the incidence of early marriage is 
high. (A 2004 United Nations report estimated that 22 percent of girls between 15 and 19 years 
of age were married, divorced, or widowed.) There is strong discrimination in access to 
employment: women represent only 29 percent of wage and salary workers but 63 percent of 
vulnerable employment. The female unemployment rate is 27 percent compared to 16 percent for 
males. In the health sector, the situation is more mixed for women. On the one hand, one-third of 
girls below the age of 19 have had children, and the lack of a national strategy for ensuring the 
availability of reproductive health products results in frequent shortages. On the other hand, 95 
percent of pregnant women receive prenatal care, and 86.7 percent receive skilled assistance at 
delivery. Concerning access to education, the government has used oil revenues to improve the 
enrollment of girls in primary and secondary schools and has succeeded in making primary 
education available to all. The proportion of women in political functions remains weak, 

2 The recent PER (2011) indicates that the execution rate of public expenditures on human development was 
between 50 and 70 percent less than planned.

however. They represent only 18.6 percent of senators and 17 percent of members of the 
National Assembly. Five out of 30 cabinet members are women.  

12. 
In 2009, the government launched its national strategy for gender equity (Stratégie 
Nationale d’Égalité et d’Équité du Genre), following extensive consultations and research 
that was supported by the United Nations Development Programme and the United 
Nations Population Fund. In accordance with Gabon’s long-term strategic goals, the MDGs, 
and the GPRSP, six strategic goals were articulated: (i) adopting principles of equality and 
gender equity by all relevant stakeholders; (ii) strengthening female autonomy by improving 
labor productivity in sectors largely dominated by female workers; (iii) improving access to 
services for labor-related activities for women and girls; (iv) improving access to social services 
for women and girls; (v) promoting equal participation and access to justice with respect to 
human rights and suppressing violence; and (vi) redefining the role of the ministry responsible 
for gender equity.

C. Economic Context  

13. Gabon is recovering from the global financial crisis. As indicated in table 1 below, in 
2008–09 economic activity, owing to low prices and weak demand for commodities, shrank the 
current account and fiscal surpluses in 2009 and turned growth moderately negative (-1.4 
percent) for the first time since 2000. However, in 2010 the economy recovered rapidly, thanks 
to a rebound in international demand for raw materials and the expansionary fiscal policy 
established by the government through the implementation of large infrastructure projects. Real 
GDP growth increased at a yearly average rate of 3 percent from 2005 to 2011. (GDP growth 
reached 6.6 percent in 2010.) The nonoil GDP growth rate grew particularly fast from 2.3 
percent in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 2007, reflecting the increased investment in rubber production, 
forestry, and mining as well as the expansion in the agribusiness and telecommunications 
sectors. It continued to grow faster than overall GDP in 2008–10.

14. 
Economic prospects should remain favorable in the medium term. The Gabonese 
economy is expected to continue to benefit from relatively high commodity prices and the 
government’s expansionary fiscal policy. Nonoil GDP is expected to grow 4.5 percent on 
average in 2012–15, reflecting increased manganese production, a rebound in wood-processing 
activities, a boom in public works, and a strong expansion of services and domestic trade. In the 
absence of major discoveries, oil production is projected to decline slightly (by 1.4 percent). 
Overall, real GDP is projected to grow at least 3.3 percent. 

15. 
In the medium term, uncertainties related to the ongoing crisis in the euro zone 
imply some downside risk. In the short term, any negative impact is expected to be limited, 
given the modest integration of the country’s financial system and only marginal remittances. 
However, should the crisis be protracted and spread to other parts of the world (especially Asia), 
Gabon could be affected by a decline in world demand for its mineral resources, mainly oil and 
manganese. In this case, having a lower debt burden, Gabon could rely on external financing, 
mainly foreign direct investment (FDI) and concessional loans from countries such as China and 
Singapore that have been active in the country over the last years.  

16. With oil reserves depleting, reforms are critical for promoting and diversifying 
private sector nonoil growth. Efforts to diversify the economy have not yet succeeded in 
reducing Gabon’s dependence on oil. Over the past five years, the oil sector has accounted, on 
average, for 81 percent of exports, 45 percent of GDP, and 60 percent of government revenue. In 
the near term, 2012–16, the Gabonese economy is expected to continue to benefit from relatively 
high oil prices. However long-term prospects for oil production are declining. Estimates include 
reserves of about 3.5 billion barrels, which could be exhausted in 40–50 years (see figure 1).

millions of barrels per annum

17. With oil production expected to decline gradually, fiscal sustainability will remain a 
key challenge for Gabon. Higher oil prices allowed the authorities to maintain a large positive 
fiscal balance at an average rate of 7.8 percent of GDP from 2005 to 2010. The nonoil primary 
deficit, however, has significantly deteriorated from 13.8 percent in 2009 to 21.0 percent of 
nonoil GDP in 2010, reflecting the government’s decision to triple capital expenditure and the 
recent wage increases. According to the permanent income approach, medium- and long-term 
fiscal sustainability would be ensured with a nonoil fiscal deficit of 8 percent of nonoil GDP 
compared to the current rate. Medium-term fiscal consolidation is vital to ensuring fiscal 
sustainability and external competiveness as oil production dwindles over time.  

18. 
Regular debt servicing to creditors has not been consistent over the past two years, 
even though debt levels are manageable. According to the latest debt sustainability analysis 
carried out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2010, Gabon’s external debt remains 
below the critical range of 40 percent of GDP. The ratio of public debt to GDP was radically 
reduced in 2010 to 16.6 percent (from 82 percent in 2002), following the authorities’ decision to 
direct additional revenues from the rise in petroleum prices to reduce external debt. In addition, 
in December 2007, for the first time, Gabon issued a US$1 billion Eurobond on the CEMAC 
market to prepay 86 percent of its debt to the Paris Club members. Nevertheless, local and Paris 
Club creditors have criticized the accumulation of arrears and have pointed to the tendency 
toward erratic repayments, stemming from weak planning and coordination between the 
Treasury and the Debt Department. Going forward, the authorities are hoping to enhance their 
reputation in international capital markets. Efforts include improved debt management and the 
injection of US$50 million into an investment management account to buy Gabonese debt in 
secondary markets in order to repay the bond by 2017. 

19. 
Currently, Gabon does not have a program with the IMF. The three-year stand-by 
arrangement with the IMF expired in May 2010, with only the first three reviews completed, and 
no IMF-supported program is currently planned. The latest IMF Article IV review, which took 
place in November 2010, recommended continued improvement of public financial management, 
particularly a closer link between the budget and a credible medium-term development plan and 
the need for a more efficient public investment program. The IMF also stressed the importance 
of maintaining 
long-term fiscal sustainability, 
improving 
the 
investment climate, and 
strengthening the financial sector.  

20. Gabon’s overall investment climate is challenging, with a variety of administrative 
barriers hampering business operations in many industries. Gabon is ranked 156 out of 183 
economies in the 2011 Doing Business report. The main factors that constrain private sector 
development are red tape and costs involved in starting a business, high labor costs and rigid 
labor legislation, poor enforceability of contracts, and inadequate legislation to protect investors’ 
interests.  

8 

 
 
 
 
21. 
The poorly diversified economy, the skills mismatch, and the weakness of policies 
that promote job creation are 
important factors contributing to Gabon’s high 
unemployment rate. Strong economic growth recorded over the past decade has not been able 
to absorb the estimated 10,000–15,000 people that enter the labor market each year, and 
unemployment is rising. The National Employment Office (Office National de l’Emploi, or 
ONE) estimates that the unemployment rate of young people (those younger than 30) is 30 
percent, while the overall unemployment rate is 16 percent. One of the main contributing factors 
is a mismatch between the skills offered by job seekers and those required by the productive 
sector: 54 percent of the job offers recorded by ONE required technical skills, whereas 64 
percent of the registered applicants do not have any vocational training. At the same time, the 
provision of technical and vocational education and training is limited and does not cover some 
of the priority sectors, including fisheries and mining. The ones that do exist for agriculture, 
forestry, and tourism do not provide training on all required profiles and also suffer from weak 
quality. This lack of high-quality higher educational opportunities has led the government to 
fund the enrollment of an increasing number of students in foreign universities, including those 
in Europe and the United States. The increased costs, however, have had little visible result.  

D. Sector Context and Challenges  

22. Governance. Gabon must improve its transparency and accountability if it is to become 
an emerging economy and compete successfully on a global scale. While progress has been 
slowed because of resistance from vested interests, militant trade unions, and the opposition, 
Gabon’s citizens now recognize that their country is more open than it was under the previous 
regime, with more visible attempts to address corruption and increase government transparency 
through such measures as traveling public cabinet meetings and improvements in both political 
culture and civil liberties. Examples of anticorruption initiatives and other governance issues 
being undertaken include: (i) implementing public procurement reform; (ii) creating a 
commission mandated to fight corruption, the illicit diversion of funds, and capital flight 
(Commission Nationale de Lutte contre l’Enrichissement Illicite); (iii) hiring an independent 
auditor to assess the oil companies’ performance vis-à-vis the stated agreements and ensuring 
that those agreements are in fact beneficial to Gabon; and (iv) procuring WBG advice and 
technical assistance through RTAs to strengthen areas such as public financial management, debt 
management, and taxation systems as well as the petroleum and mining codes. 

Box 2: Public Procurement Initiatives 
Gabon is implementing a range of public procurement reforms with ambitions to comply with international 
standards and institute appropriate institutional and legal frameworks to pave the way for a better 
relationship with the private sector. Key innovations relate to : (i) better public procurement planning 
through alignment with the ministries; (ii) more transparency and accountability in the procurement process 
through systematizing the competitive bidding process; (iii) decentralizing the Directorate of Public 
Procurement to streamline processing; and (iv) creating a procurement regulatory agency made up of the 
government, the private sector, and civil society. Once these measures are formally adopted by the 
government, additional challenges—including training of key stakeholders and developing tools and 
systems—will be undertaken for monitoring and enforcement.  

9 

 
 
 
 
 
23. 
Corruption. In spite of these efforts, perceptions of corruption remain high. Gabon 
became a candidate for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in March 2005 
and has since published three EITI reports, but the country has yet to reach compliant status. In 
June 2011, the EITI international board decided to renew Gabon's EITI candidate status for 18 
months (until December 2012). During this time, Gabon will have to complete an EITI 
validation. While Gabon has improved since 2010 (it now ranks 110 out of 178 countries), it still 
ranks 100 out of 182 in the Transparency International 2011 Global Corruption Report. In 
addition, according to the Mo Ibrahim Governance Index, in 2011, while ranking highest in the 
Central Africa region, Gabon ranked 27th out of the 53 African countries included in the 
classification, with no change in its 2010 ranking in relation to its corruption and accountability 
indicators.  

24. 
Public Finance Management. Gabon’s weak public finance management (PFM) 
hampers its efforts to execute its budget efficiently. In PFM, Gabon has adopted a new organic 
budget law, purging ghost workers in the civil service and imposing salary ceilings for m anagers 
of public enterprises to help control wage bills. However, there are concerns regarding the 
government’s ability to execute the capital budget efficiently (only 55 percent of the 2010 capital 
budget was executed). The recent Bank-prepared Public Expenditure Review highlights weak 
PFM, misalignment between public spending and development goals, and low spending on 
priority sectors (for example, Gabon’s 5.6 percent annual average expenditure in the health 
sector during 2005–09 compared to the 8.3 percent average for Sub-Saharan Africa). This budget 
imbalance is likely to be exacerbated, given pressures to maintain the expansionary fiscal policy 
and accelerated investments related to hosting the 2012 African Cup of Nations .3 While steps are 
being undertaken to reform the legal framework, capacity within sectoral ministries needs to be 
strengthened with regard to: (i) preparing feasibility studies; (ii) managing procurement; (iii) 
implementing budget controls; and (iv) simplifying accounting and payment procedures.  

25. 
Energy. Gabon has the third-largest hydroelectric potential in Central Africa (over 8,000 
megawatts and over 76 terawatts) but very low current capacity, and only 30 percent of the 
population, mostly in urban areas, has access to electricity. Access to electricity in rural areas is 
particularly challenging because of the low density of the population and difficult access. 
Electricity has been generated mainly by hydroelectric power stations, but in recent years, given 
the rapid growth of demand, the share of thermal generation using liquid fuels has increased 
significantly. This trend has increased the average cost of electricity and challenges the financial 
sustainability of the sector. The government has set new goals to reach an installed capacity of 
5,000 megawatts, representing more than 12 times the current capacity, and to establish a 100 
percent national electrification rate. Greater capacity will be achieved through further 
development of: (i) the country’s hydroelectric potential, namely, the construction of three dams 
(in Poubara, in Ngounié, and in the north of the country); (ii) gas for electricity generation; and 

3 The 2012 African Cup of Nations took place January 21–February 12, 2012.

(iii) renewable energies like biomass and solar. According to the concession contract signed with 
the government, the Gabonese electricity and water utility is expected to invest a minimum of 
US$200 million in equipment renewal throughout the concession period (1997–2017).  

26. 
Financial Sector. The Gabonese financial sector is dominated by banks, it remains 
concentrated, and links to international markets are limited. Gabon’s bank penetration rate is 
estimated at 15 percent, which seems low but in fact is relatively high compared to the average in 
the CEMAC region where the average is only 3 percent. Microfinance institutions, which extend 
financial services to the informal sector, have yet to make an impact in Gabon. The country 
scored poorly on the ―getting credit‖ indicator in the 2011 Doing Business report, ranking 138 
out of the 183 countries surveyed. A small regional stock exchange with headquarters in 
Libreville, the Bourse des Valeurs Mobilières d’Afrique Centrale, was set up by the six countries 
of CEMAC in 2003, but trading started only in late 2007 with the issuance of a domestic bond by 
the Gabonese government. 

27. 
Accounting Profession and Standards. The development of the Gabonese private and 
financial sector also suffers from the lack of a well-established accountancy profession. As 
indicated in the World Bank’s Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes: Auditing and 
Accounting, published in April 2011, there is no accountancy body regulating the profession, 
providing institutional support to the private and financial sector, and influencing the tax policy 
reforms undertaken by the authorities. Once the government passes its proposed bill to formalize 
the accounting profession in Gabon, technical assistance will be needed to ensure adherence to 
regional and international auditing and accounting standards.  

28. 
Transport. The transport network remains inadequate, owing to poor planning, low 
population density, and difficult forested or waterlogged terrain near many urban areas. Gabon 
has only 1,200 kilometers of paved roads, no road connects Port-Gentil (the economic capital) 
with Libreville, and links with neighboring countries are poor. Gabon’s road density compares 
unfavorably with that of its poorer neighbors such as the Republic of Congo and Cameroon and 
is comparable only with conflict-torn Chad and the Central African Republic. A 697-kilometer 
rail line linking Libreville to Franceville will facilitate forestry and mining activities, although it 
is still not adequate. The country counts two ports: one in Libreville-Owendo, which is dedicated 
mainly to transactions of commercial goods, and the other in Port-Gentil, which is used for oil 
trade transactions. The decrepit installations and equipment hamper the capacity of both ports 
and increase transport costs. A new deep sea extension to the Mayumba port in the south is 
planned and will serve primarily to export minerals. Under the previous CAS, the World Bank 
had planned a US$75 million road infrastructure project to improve transportation around 
Libreville, given that only one road leads in and out of the city. This support was not provided, 
however, following the authorities’ decision to advance its plans to resettle an estimated 10,000 
persons during the period immediately preceding the 2012 African Cup of Nations.  

11 

 
 
 
 
29. 
Telecommunications. Access to international connectivity in Gabon is very costly and 
lies beyond the reach of the majority of the population. Current access from the Libreville 
submarine cable landing station is rationed; it is at full capacity, with no possibility for upgrades 
to meet the exponential increase in demand linked to the use of Internet services. The fixed 
broadband market is underdeveloped, with merely 9,500 broadband customers as of December 
2010 (a penetration of 2.6 percent). Mobile Internet is also poorly developed, despite a high 
mobile penetration rate. Against this background, the country has developed a three-year plan 
called Digital Gabon (Gabon Numérique) to connect all nine provincial capitals, all regional 
(―departments‖) capitals, and the borders of the country. In the short term, the main objectives 
are to develop new international capacity in Libreville via the ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) 
submarine cable and to create new national capacity to Port-Gentil and Franceville, as well as to 
connect to the Republic of Congo.  The recently established National Agency for Digital 
Infrastructure and Frequencies is tasked with leading the government's connectivity agenda. 

30. 
Natural Resource Management. As part of its diversification agenda, Gabon will give 
considerable attention to the sustainable management of natural resources, which constitute the 
foundation of the Gabon Vert pillar of the PSGE. This pillar includes the forestry, biodiversity 
and environment, agriculture, fisheries, and mining sectors.  

31. 
Forestry. Gabon has a rich endowment in forest resources with a total area of tropical 
forest amounting to around 21 million hectares, or almost 80 percent of the country’s surface. 
The forest sector is the country’s second-largest employer, and exports are estimated at US$450 
million per year, over 60 percent of which go to China. Of Gabon’s 21 million hectares of rain 
forest, around 10.7 million hectares are allocated as concessions for commercial timber 
production. The government considers the country’s forests a strategic economic resource; recent 
reforms have resulted in: (i) a large expansion of areas under sustainable management (more than 
85 percent of the productive areas engaged in sustainable forest management); (ii) a more 
transparent and competitive award process for concessions; (iii) public disclosure of all holders 
of logging contracts and their status with respect to fiscal and other contractual obligations; and 
(iv) the elimination of the monopoly of the national timber marketing company (Société 
Nationale des Bois Gabonais). Forest taxation recovery has also been enhanced, resulting in an 
80 percent collection rate of tax revenues, compared to 30 percent in 2005. As a result of these 
reforms, the contribution of the forestry sector to the national GDP grew from 2.5 percent in 
2004 to 4.7 percent in 2009. In December 2010, the government banned the export of all raw 
unprocessed timber in an effort to stimulate in-country processing of timber, setting the stage for 
the special economic zone of Nkok (see box 1).  

32. 
Biodiversity and Environment. Gabon is endowed with rich faunal and floral wildlife 
and a variety of landscapes, including an 800-kilometer coastline. Gabon belongs to the Congo 
Basin rain forest ecosystem, the world’s second-largest area of contiguous rain forest. However, 
ecotourism remains constrained by limited investments in hotels, services, marketing, and 

12 

 
 
infrastructure. Since 2004, the government has worked to improve biodiversity and the 
environment in several ways: (i) by adopting new legislation on national parks; (ii) by 
establishing adequate institutional capacity to manage national parks; (iii) by settling situations 
where logging and mining concessions overlap with national parks; and (iv) by identifying 
additional areas for biodiversity conservation and ecotourism to meet the national target of 4 
million hectares under protection status. 

33. 
Fisheries. Fish and fisheries’ products are a valuable resource for Gabon and contribute 
roughly 3 percent of GDP. However, the development of the fisheries sector in Gabon is 
constrained by significant governance issues, including the ability to adequately control fishing 
activity. The government has indicated its readiness to embrace an ambitious reform similar to 
the one already under way in forestry and biodiversity. Progress made under the recently closed 
Bank-supported development policy loan in natural resources management (NRM-DPL) includes 
regular disclosure of the fishing licenses and improved tax collection.  

34. Mining and Petroleum. The revitalization of the mining sector is an important priority 
in the government’s diversification agenda. Gabon is the world’s second-largest producer of 
manganese dioxide, possesses considerable iron deposits, and has the potential to produce up to 
15 percent of global niobium. Gabon also produces some gold and diamonds. Along with 
working to improve the policy and regulatory framework in the mining sector, the government is 
currently focused on building institutional capacity for strategy, negotiation, and monitoring; on 
implementing a mining cadastre; on establishing a national mining company (Compagnie 
Equatoriale des Mines); on pursuing EITI compliance and an audit of the Kimberly Process; on 
developing an environmental management framework; and on supporting artisanal and small-
scale mining. Priorities in the petroleum sector include enacting a new petroleum law; 
establishing a legal and regulatory framework for reducing gas flaring; assessing the national gas 
utilization plan, which includes gas for power plants and liquefied natural gas; and 
operationalizing the national oil company (Gabon Oil Company) established in 2010.  

35. 
Agriculture. Owing to the density of the tropical rain forest, only a small proportion of 
land area is suitable for agricultural activity and cultivation. Furthermore, with over 85 percent of 
the population living in towns and poor road infrastructure, the contribution to GDP of the 
agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors is very modest compared to such contributions in 
neighboring countries. The country lacks self-sufficiency in staple crops, and over 80 percent of 
food requirements must be imported. Many people have expressed frustration at seeing even the 
basic elements of their food (bananas, peppers, and cassava) imported from neighboring 
countries. Cocoa, coffee, palm oil, and rubber are cultivated for export. Strategic areas of 
Gabon’s agricultural policy include rehabilitating centers for the development of improved seeds, 
training for farmers, strengthening farmers' organizations, and improving research centers. 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
III. THE GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGIC PLAN 

36. 
Since the 1990s, the government has engaged in a process aimed at accelerating 
growth and reducing poverty. In 1995, it defined its long-term vision, the Prospective Vision 
Gabon 2025; in 2003, Gabon approved an economic and social development orientation law and 
then in 2006 finalized a GPRSP. That strategy, developed through a participatory process, was 
designed around four pillars: promoting strong and sustainable pro-poor growth, improving 
infrastructure, improving basic services, and improving governance. 

37. 
In 2009, the new government presented a new economic vision—Gabon Emergent—
which aims at modernizing the country and turning it into an emerging economy by 2025. 
This strategy is still based on accelerating growth and reducing poverty but now looks to 
capitalize on Gabon’s comparative advantages in the regional and global landscapes (see figure 
2). The strategy is built on three pillars:  
 Gabon Industriel aims to develop Gabon into a metallurgic and industrial pole of 
reference (optimizing oil and mining and support to industries through construction, 
building materials, and agro-industrial transformation).  
 Gabon Vert has three major goals: instituting sustainable forest management and 
transforming Gabon into a global leader in certified tropical timber production, 
developing agriculture and livestock farming to improve food security, and creating 
sustainable and responsible fisheries. 
 Gabon des Services has the objective of making Gabon a center of excellence in business, 
ecotourism, and value-added services, such as higher education and research, health, 
media, and information technologies (IT).

The immediate challenge for the Gabonese authorities is to translate the new and 
ambitious economic vision into practical, fully costed sector strategies with visible impact, 
including poverty reduction, in the short to medium term. The PSGE is based on four 
building blocks representing the reforms that need to take place before the vision can be fully 
realized. However, the strategy still lacks sufficient analytical underpinnings, including sector 
costing, prioritization, and national consultation, before it can be fully adopted by the respective 
ministries and successfully executed. These four building blocks include:  

 Reforming and modernizing the state: Reforming each ministry and the president’s 
office by strengthening the capacity of the ministries, improving public financial 
management, and developing e-government applications. 

 

Infrastructure development and 
infrastructure—notably, energy, 
adequate for all. 

regional planning: Ensuring 
that basic 
telecommunications, and 
transportation—are 

 

Improving the investment climate and private sector development: Implementing 
reforms to streamline the investment process and support the development of national 
SMEs.  
 Human capital development and fighting against exclusion and vulnerability: 
Ensuring education for all and an alignment between the supply of and demand for 
skills in the labor market.  

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP – GABON PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A.  Lessons Learned from Previous CAS and Stakeholder Feedback  

39. 
In spite of the uncertainty arising from the presidential transition, a number of 
important results were achieved during the former CAS period. Good progress was noted in 
public finance management, natural resource management, and urban infrastructure. Structural 
reforms—including privatization, implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative, budgetary capacity improvements, and strengthening the investment climate—are 
progressing. Results obtained under the NRM-DPL are particularly striking in the forestry sector 
where short-term rent-seeking behaviors were widespread. Finally, in urban infrastructure, 
52,000 people in target areas now have access to all-season roads within a 500-meter range, from 
a baseline of 1,000 people in 2006. Other key results include an additional 65,000 people who 
are now benefiting from improved sanitary conditions, compared to a baseline of 500 in 2007.  

40. 
At the same time, the former CAS portfolio performance experienced significant 
challenges, including effectiveness and implementation delays, lack of counterpart funding, 
problems with ownership, and resistance to reform. For example, with respect to the NRM-
DPL, reforms were delivered up to 30 months later than originally planned, because of risks 

15 

 
 
 
associated with certain reforms that generated strong opposition from some of the respective line 
ministries (forestry, fisheries, and mining). Effectiveness could be achieved only after an inter-
ministerial coordination unit was established by the prime minister’s office. In addition, some of 
the fiduciary elements were confusing for the borrower. The need to provide complementary 
technical assistance to strengthen implementation capacity caused further implementation delays. 
Similarly, the RTA, signed in August 2010 but not initiated until late 2011, reflects an 
incomplete consensus among the ministries about the type of technical assistance and reform 
support to be provided by the Bank.  

41. 
Four key lessons stand out from the previous CAS. First, future assistance programs 
should be based more on a systematic analysis of the government’s priorities and be more 
closely aligned to major stakeholders’ goals and objectives. Gabon is a middle-income country, 
and a demand-driven, flexible approach is the most effective strategy. In addition, previous 
experience points to delays in implementation due to insufficient understanding of the political 
economy and the potential resistance to reforms. Second, Gabon’s weak institutional capacity 
has adversely affected project implementation as well as the timeliness of debt repayments. 
Recognizing this inadequacy, the WBG should also provide appropriate and tailored support that 
strengthens both the capacity of government institutions and project-specific implementation 
skills. Third, simpler project design and clear coordination and accountabilities—preferably 
assigned to one ministry—facilitate timely project implementation. Alternatively, multi-sectoral 
projects need high-level coordination. Fourth, to bring about impact and transformative change, 
the WBG must scale up its engagement, focusing on broader representation in sectors that will 
further complement the government’s reform program, including access to infrastructure 
services, improving the investment climate, and strengthening vocational skills. 

42. 
Feedback received from the April 2011 client survey also points to the need for the 
WBG to fundamentally change its engagement with Gabon. Stakeholders appear to have a 
good sense of the road map for development in Gabon and the areas requiring emphasis . 
Respondents indicate that Gabon’s key development priorities have clearly shifted since FY05. 
In 2005, poverty was identified as the top development priority, followed by corruption and 
government effectiveness. In 2011, poverty was rated fifth, with government effectiveness 
identified as the top priority, followed by infrastructure, public financial management, and 
diversity of the economy. Respondents see a clear role for the WBG well beyond the financial 
resources that it provides. Knowledge is seen as the greatest value the WBG brings, followed by 
technical, policy, and economic advice. With respect to the WBG’s effectiveness, some ratings 
have declined since FY05, particularly those touching on the direction and sustainability of its 
strategies related to the changing external environment. Nevertheless, 80 percent of respondents 
affirmed that the WBG should be more involved in the development of Gabon, and there is a 
strong view that the WBG should play a significant role in the future.  

16 

 
 
 
 
43. 
CPS preparation involved substantive discussions with Gabonese government 
officials, civil society, private sector actors, legislators, other donors , and citizens to obtain 
a consensual vision of WBG activities over the CPS period. The consultations consisted of 
several meetings and workshops in six cities in Gabon during a three-week period in November 
2011. This activity involved over 600 participants in discussion and agreement on the major 
directions and prospective themes for the CPS. The proposed CPS strategy received strong 
support, with participants requesting an increased Bank presence in Gabon. In addition, there 
were requests for continued support in (i) urban infrastructure, particularly in areas covered by 
the Bank’s local infrastructure project, with demands from all mayors and beneficiaries that the 
work continue; (ii) agriculture and rural development, particularly in relation to extension 
services, roads to transport produce from the rural areas to the cities, and direct investments in 
other potential agriculture projects, including banana farming and a winery in Franceville; and 
(iii) requests that the Bank continue to assess the impact of its work on beneficiaries. 

B. Country Partnership Strategy FY2012–FY16 

44. 
The CPS aims to set in motion a process of transformative change that will support 
the government in delivering the foundations for medium-to-long-term sustainable 
economic growth (see figure 3). In accordance with the new World Bank Africa Region 
Strategy, the CPS will provide support to Gabon’s PSGE according to two strategic themes: first, 
increasing Gabon’s competitiveness and employment and, second, supporting vulnerability and 
resilience. The underlying foundation of governance and the cross-cutting theme of gender 
equity will contribute to both areas. This approach is expected to contribute to six outcomes 
during the period: (i) improved governance, transparency, and accountability in the management 
of the national budget, debt management, and mining resources; (ii) improved access to 
infrastructure services (electricity and telecommunications); (iii) improved investment climate 
and private sector development; (iv) improved vocational skills and capacity; (v) more 
transparent and sustainable management of natural resources; and (vi) improved knowledge of 
basic service delivery for health and social protection.

The CPS is selective and focuses on areas where the WBG can have the most impact. 
The CPS continues to provide support to the strategic pillars of the last CAS—that is, 
strengthening the management of public resources (both natural and financial for improved 
social outcomes) and helping the investment climate foster sustainable, private sector–led nonoil 
growth. However, transformative change represents a demand-driven, flexible strategy that 
focuses on the provision of targeted support to key priority areas (for example, access to 
infrastructure and private sector development) and tackling them from a regional perspective. 
This approach will also require addressing some of the longer-term foundations of growth, such 
as improving governance, strengthening the capacity of the public sector, and developing human 
capital. The CPS will contribute to poverty reduction by developing a strong repository of 
knowledge with key recommendations for further policy dialogue. The agriculture sector, while 
not specifically targeted in the CPS, will be supported through Gabon’s involvement in the 
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program. 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
46. 
The proposed CPS will strongly emphasize a mix of partnerships, knowledge, and 
financing to best support Gabon’s development needs and requirements. The CPS is 
innovative in its combination of traditional financing and knowledge with partnerships, including 
a reimbursable technical service agreement of up to US$2 million for 2012, with an option to 
extend in the subsequent years. Within the RTA, the government has requested support in four 
main areas: (i) public financial management (debt management analysis, a debt management 
reform plan, improvement of the budget cycle, and a tax system assessment); (ii) the mining 
sector (formulation of the mining code and technical assistance to reduce gas flaring); (iii) 
analysis of sources of growth (tourism, agribusiness, the financial sector, and access to credit for 
SMEs and forestry); and (iv) the transport sector (development of a port concession, and an 
infrastructure assessment).  

47. 
The CPS will deepen cooperation with a wide range of partners at all levels. 
Examples of such partnerships include: (i) emphasizing the World Bank’s role in the 
implementation of PFM reforms as lead donor at the CEMAC Commission level; (ii) 
collaborating with the United Nations to address HIV/AIDs; and (iii) advancing reforms in 
natural resource management as part of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation (REDD+) initiative. Additional assistance, such as that provided through the Global 
Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) public-private partnership trust fund, will also support the 
government in addressing its climate change commitments. The CPS will work particularly 
closely with WBI, IFC, and MIGA to build capacity, facilitate effective relations with civil 
society, improve the investment climate, and attract private sector investments.  

48. 
Providing knowledge plays a central role in CPS support of government efforts to 
implement its national plan, including its fight against exclusion and vulnerability. Existing 
knowledge will be disseminated and leveraged, as, for example, in the recent Bank-prepared 
Public Expenditure Review. New knowledge will be generated in priority areas to facilitate 
policy dialogue and further engagement, including the proposed lending program. With respect 
to poverty reduction, advisory and analytical activities will be undertaken to strengthen statistical 
underpinnings, including an assessment of Gabon’s health sector, its social safety net 
mechanisms, and an analysis of human development challenges and obstacles for redistribution . 
These advisory and analytical activities will be complemented by three other policy notes 
designed to assess employment and growth, export diversification and competitiveness, the fiscal 
decentralization system, and skills development. The CPS also proposes to support updating the 
most recent household survey, which was undertaken in 2005.  

49. 
The lending strategy is more ambitious than the preceding one, with an expected 
lending portfolio four times greater than what it was under the base case, at around 
US$250 million over the next four years. Regional support will be directed toward 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
strengthening regional institutions and telecommunications. Building on the advisory and 
analytical activities, specific sector investment loans will be provided to facilitate access to 
infrastructure services and to strengthen the investment climate for private sector development. 
IFC has also explored investment opportunities in infrastructure, forestry, mining, and financial 
markets, and MIGA will be active in the agriculture sector. The rationale for this renewed 
dialogue and engagement between Gabon and the WBG reflects the recognition, on both sides, 
that the WBG can provide great value to Gabon in its effort to become an emerging economy. In 
providing that support, the WBG will also elevate both its impact and its relevance, which have 
been relatively weak to date in Gabon, compared to the contributions of other development 
partners. 

C. Key Priorities for World Bank Group Support  

C1. 

Improving Governance and Public Sector Capacity  

50. 
The WBG will work closely with the government and partners to implement a well-
coordinated plan for improving governance and strengthening transparency. From the 
supply side, the CPS proposes providing assistance primarily through three entry points (public 
finance management, procurement, and the extractive industries) to address dysfunctional 
practices at the local and national levels (see table 2).  

Table 2: Gabon’s Strategic Goal of Improving Governance and Public Sector Capacity 

Strategic Goal 

Country Partnership Strategy 
Outcome  

PSGE Pillar 1: Reform and modernization of 
the state  

Improved governance, transparency, and 
accountability in management of the national budget 
cycle, debt management, and mining resources.  

Major Interventions 
Partners: WBI, UNPD, IMF, CEMAC 
Proposed Knowledge: PER dissemination and PFM policy notes  
RTA: Components on Improvement of budget cycle, debt management study, tax system analysis  
Ongoing Trust Funds and Grants: Trust Fund for Civil Society Capacity Building, EITI support  

Note: Refer to figure 2 for structure of CPS results chain. 

51. 
The WBG will provide support to PFM reforms in several ways. First, the WBG will 
undertake outreach activities to disseminate the key findings and recommendations of the PER to 
key stakeholders within Gabon, including members of civil society. Second, as lead donor of 

20 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CEMAC’s PFM Agenda, in coordination with UNDP and the IMF, the Bank will assist Gabon in 
implementing the new PFM directives. Third, support will be provided to strengthen the 
preparation and execution of the national budget, including a useful set of tools and systems in a 
pilot set of line ministries as well as a public investment management system. Fourth, in 
financial reporting, as part of the RTA, the Bank will work to strengthen the capacity of the 
Directorate of Financial Affairs to prepare accurate and timely reports. In addition, other related 
work to be undertaken as part of the RTA will include a comprehensive diagnostic of the tax 
system as well as a debt management study to help Gabon focus on fiscal and debt sustainability. 
Finally, as part of the economic and poverty monitoring work program, the WB will prepare a 
series of policy notes that includes a growth and employment study.   

52. 
Demand-side governance will be stimulated in a variety of ways, including through 
extractive industries and at the project level. Through the RTA, the government has requested 
WBG support for EITI validation. In October 2010, the EITI Board designated Gabon as an EITI 
candidate country that is ―close to compliant.‖ However, there are some questions about Gabon’s 
ability to achieve full compliance by the deadline of December 2012, pending completion of an 
independent audit of the oil industry, as decreed by the president. The proposed technical 
assistance will support consultation workshops for civil society organizations and other activities 
aimed at strengthening participation of these organizations in the EITI process. Additional 
support to strengthen transparency may also be provided through the multi-donor trust fund for 
the EITI initiative. 

53. 
At the project level, the Economic Diversification and Competitiveness Project and 
the CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project will focus on fostering business -led 
actions against corruption. These activities will include more effective investigations of 
money-laundering cases and transparent procurement of goods and services. Work will be 
undertaken with committed local business associations and the Chamber of Commerce to 
develop a collective anticorruption initiative with a common code of conduct , including a no-
bribery pact for private firms. One of the goals of the Economic Diversification and 
Competitiveness Project is to oversee the establishment of a public procurement authority, 
comprising representatives from public and private sectors, as well as civil society. This 
authority will entail a new management system to make all information related to procurement 
publicly available. Finally, the CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project will continue to 
support anti-money–laundering efforts.  

54. 
In conjunction with the World Bank Institute, work will also go forward on 
implementing governance reforms through coalitions of multiple stakeholders (civil society, 
government, media practitioners, private sector, and others). This collaboration will also 
include providing stakeholders with platforms for engagement and capacity development to 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
promote South-South knowledge exchanges, enhance practitioners’ expertise, and disseminate 
knowledge in such areas as budget monitoring, public expenditure tracking, and performance 
monitoring. The WBI will also strengthen the oversight capabilities of the media and the 
parliament, including facilitating learning, knowledge sharing, and advisory assistance through 
peer-to-peer media networks. Further support will be provided to enhance the National 
Assembly’s ability to perform its functions effectively, particularly its oversight of the budget 
and the implementation and performance of sectoral policies and programs, including extractive 
industries, through regional knowledge-sharing programs. 

C2. 

Increasing Gabon’s Competitiveness and Employment 

55. 
Despite great potential in industries like mining, timber, agribusiness, tourism, and 
information and communications technologies (ICT), Gabon's exports continue to be 
dominated by oil. The reasons for this reliance on oil are related essentially to poor 
infrastructure and a poor investment climate. Investment in quality infrastructure is one of the 
four pillars of Gabon’s PSGE. As such, WBG support to improve competitiveness will focus on 
two principal goals: (i) increased infrastructure investment in the energy and telecommunications 
sectors; and (ii) improved business climate.  

56. Within this strategic pillar, the CPS proposes to examine the key challenges 
associated with youth unemployment in Gabon. A survey will be prepared, the first ever in 
Gabon, to identify the main constraints to job creation and to recommend key policy actions for 
more inclusive growth. The Human Development Education Project will also build on this 
analytical work by designing a program to help respond to the challenges, including the skills 
mismatch (see table 3).

57. 
Electricity. The WBG is currently supporting the authorities, through a Public-Private 
Infrastructure Advisory Facility grant, to perform an institutional review of the power sector to 
improve the institutional and regulatory framework and meet future challenges. During the CPS 
period, as requested by the government, WBG support will focus on improving the efficiency of 
supply, provide support to rural electrification, and strengthen energy efficiency. The main 
objective of the project is to help the government increase efficient access to modern energy 
services in rural and peri-urban areas through mobilizing public and private investments and 
thereby improve the living conditions of the population and alleviate poverty. The availability of 
reliable electricity at affordable cost will also help improve the investment climate and foster 
private sector–led growth. The proposed transmission and distribution facilities will be supplied 
from new hydro and thermal plants, such as the 70-megawatt gas-fired generation plant of 
Owendo completed last year whose capacity is expected to double in the coming years. 

58. 
Transport. Through the RTA, the government will draw on the Bank’s knowledge of the 
transport sector in Gabon to update its transport policy and prepare a port concession agreement 
for Port-Gentil. Bank engagement is expected to cover several activities: (i) the formulation of a 
concession strategy; (ii) the proposed concession contract; (iii) the proposed concession 
regulatory framework; and (iv) assistance during the concession bidding, negotiations, and award 
process. The government has also requested technical assistance in updating its intermodal 
transport plan and an analysis of infrastructure costs. These activities are included in the revised 
annual RTA. 

59. 
Telecommunications. During the CPS period, new international capacity will be 
provided through the WBG’s Central African Backbone (CAB) program. The WBG will provide 
financing in early stages of the project to ensure that access to the new submarine cable capacity, 
as well as to the national backbone that will carry capacity throughout the country, will be 
provided according to open access principles and will leverage the very strong appetite of the 
private sector (operators and Internet service providers) for participating in the project. This 
approach will create a sound governance structure for international and national capacity and 
enhance links between Gabon and other countries participating in the CAB project (for example, 
by providing access or redundant access to submarine cable capacity to landlocked countries).  

60. 
In conjunction with the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the 
government has also requested additional financing from the WBG to develop a terrestrial 
fiber optic cable from Libreville to Franceville under the CAB program. Connecting 
Libreville, Port-Gentil, and Franceville will address most of the current pent-up demand for 
better and cheaper connectivity. Enhanced regional connectivity will both provide access to 
international connectivity through the ACE submarine cable and increase cross-border 
communications, particularly the traffic flows to and from the Republic of Congo through the 
link from Franceville to Lekoko that connect with Dolisie-Mbinda on the other side of the 

23 

 
 
 
 
border. Once the investments have been made to establish the national backbone, the RTA will 
provide further analytical work to assist the government in developing its e-government 
applications and 
in creating 
taxation approaches and 
fee structures, 
including a 
telecommunications sector fiscal study.  

61. 
Private Sector Development. Recognizing 
the pressing need 
for economic 
diversification, the government is centering its new strategy on improving the investment 
climate, developing skills, and providing assistance to small and medium enterprises, including 
fostering links with larger investment or industries. Building on analytical and advisory activities 
related to export diversification and competitiveness and employment and growth, the CPS 
proposes to focus on four specific areas: establishing an investment climate favorable to private 
investment, fostering industry-specific competitiveness, enhancing competitiveness through in-
firm technical learning, and supporting institutional reform and project implementation.  

62. With respect to establishing a favorable investment climate, the Bank and IFC will 
work together to implement an innovative and transformative approach. That approach will 
be based on a ―one-stop shop‖ for SMEs and investors and expanding on the maison de 
l’entreprise concept. These services would include skills development; advice for start-ups; a 
center for arbitration, mediation, and conciliation to handle commercial disputes efficiently; an 
investment promotion agency; and a secretariat to the Presidential Investment Council. The 
program will also be gender informed, with specific analyses of gender-based investment climate 
barriers that constrain private sector development, and will use IFC’s Practitioner’s Guide for 
Gender and Investment Climate to implement appropriate solutions. The goal is to consider the 
legal, regulatory, and administrative barriers to private sector development with a gender 
perspective and to understand whether women face different or additional constraints beyond 
those faced by men. This approach is taken to ensure that women benefit from on-going efforts 
to improve Gabon’s investment climate on the same basis as their male counterparts.  

63. 
Value chain analysis will be conducted to contribute to growth in ecotourism, agro 
industry, and wood processing. Despite Gabon’s vast potential, only 15,000 tourists visited 
Gabon in 2009. Assistance to the ecotourism industry will be complemented by a matching grant 
scheme for technical learning at the firm level. This component aims to build the technical 
capacities of private firms, including competitiveness, training and advisory services, and linkage 
programs. 

64. 
Finally, the project will focus on several key institutional reforms: (i) establishing a 
legal and institutional framework for public-private partnership (PPP) and supporting the design 
and implementation of such transactions; (ii) improving public procurement to bolster SME 
(including women-owned SMEs) access to public contracts; and (iii) strengthening the capacity 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
of private sector organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture, 
Tourism, and Mining.  

65. 
Better-developed vocational skills are critical for responding to economic 
diversification and private sector development, as well as for improving employment and 
addressing exclusion and vulnerability through a better skills match in the labor market. In 
the short term, the CPS proposes to extend technical support in two areas. The first area is an 
understanding of the obstacles through: (i) rapid labor market survey to assess the demand for 
skills and the supply of skills in the short run; (ii) a policy note on skills development through a 
life-cycle approach while also addressing the development of technical and vocational education 
opportunities in selected sectors supported by the Economic Diversification and Competitiveness 
Project (female job seekers would be targeted); and (iii) a skills development strategy for the 
way forward. The second area of support would consist of an assessment of the feasibility of the 
Human Development Education Project, including the options for new institutions of higher 
education institutions focusing on science and technology, linking the options to the growing 
access to modern and efficient information technology facilities. The medium-term objective is 
to identify specific areas for WBG financing in the fiscal years 2014-2016, including options for 
PPPs for the development of associated infrastructure, and to prepare a transformative lending 
operation in support of the government’s vision. 

66. WBG support to Gabon’s regional integration agenda is provided through several 
projects and programs: the CEMAC Regional Institutions Support Project, the Central African 
Backbone Project in the information and communications technologies sector, the Organization 
for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA)4 Investment Climate Project, the 
Regional REDD+ Project, and the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program. 
The Bank-supported CEMAC Regional Institutions Project, active since 2008, has been focusing 
on helping Central African regional institutions encourage an expanded, better-governed regional 
market and a more transparent, better-regulated, and more competitive financial system, one 
designed to facilitate the use of oil revenues for investment in Central Africa.  

67. 
The Central African Backbone Project will contribute to the implementation of the 
third pillar of the 2010–15 CEMAC Regional Economic Program related to the physical 
interconnectivity of its member countries. This project will reinforce the integrity of the 
regional communications networks by creating loops (redundancy) in the sub-region. The CAB 
project will also enhance the harmonization of sector regulation that governs the ICT sector of 
the CEMAC countries. This improvement will lead to lower prices for telephone services and 
better access to the Internet, which will significantly enhance the environment for foreign and 

4 The 16 member states of OHADA are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, 
Comoros, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, 
Senegal, and Togo. 

25 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
local private investment in the region, decrease the cost of doing business, raise the prospects for 
job creation and wealth generation, and support systems for managing natural hazards and 
emergencies. The project will also provide the appropriate basis for further deployment of the 
national backbone to other zones and border crossings in Gabon. 

68. 
The WBG also provides support through a regional approach to improve the 
investment climate simultaneously in the 16 member states of OHADA that tackles half the 
Doing Business indicators. A number of benefits are expected from the proposed OHADA 
Investment Climate Project: an improved commercial justice system in OHADA member 
countries, a reduced cost of doing business, better access to finance for small and medium 
enterprises, and a greater number of formal companies and formal jobs. In addition, the proposed 
project will help strengthen OHADA regional institutions, harmonize the regional auditing 
norms with international ones, and establish a regional e-government platform connected to the 
national database to provide reliable financial information on firms and movable collateral. 

69. Gabon is one of the six countries covered by the Regional REDD+ Project, approved 
on July14, 2011, by the WBG Board. The future REDD+ mechanism has the potential to 
generate substantial financial flows to help the Congo Basin countries develop a shared, long-
term vision for sustainable forest management and make informed policy choices by finding new 
ways to reconcile long-held and conflicting approaches to land use. Given the ongoing risks of 
deforestation while Gabon engages in its ambitious development program (Gabon Emergent), the 
REDD+ mechanism represents a tremendously powerful tool, potentially backed by large 
financial resources, for creating new paths for sustainable development that also take into 
consideration the importance of preserving forest areas.  

70. 
Finally, in December 2010, the WBG, through a multi-donor trust fund, provided 
financial support to the Economic Community of Central African States, in the amount of 
US$3.9 million (or CFAF 1.8 billion) for the implementation of the Comprehensive Africa 
Agriculture Development Program. This program, which is to be implemented over three 
years, is expected to help build the institutional capacities of the ECCAS General Secretariat, 
with the recruitment of additional experts in financial and accounting management, agriculture 
and rural development, monitoring and evaluation, agricultural databases, and procurement. It 
will also help develop and harmonize the quality of country and regional agricultural investment 
programs. Finally, the grant will allow ECCAS to develop the necessary technical partnerships 
and to urge governments, the respective ministries, and technical and financial partners to 
facilitate access to financing for investments.  

71. 
In conjunction with IBRD, IFC and MIGA will play an important role in helping 
the government advance its new strategy for improving the investment climate, developing 
skills, and providing assistance to SMEs, including fostering links with larger investments 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
or industries. During the forthcoming CPS period, IFC will continue to build on its 
achievements in strengthening the business climate in Gabon as well as pursuing opportunities 
for direct investments. In November 2010, the government signed an RTA with IFC for two 
years to improve the business climate in Gabon, in accordance with the Doing Business 
recommendations. The technical assistance will focus on the following four areas: (i) assisting 
foreign and domestic investors in creating businesses; (ii) developing procedures for construction 
permits and access to property through a one-stop shop; (iii) creating tax incentives and simpler 
tax administration; and (iv) developing procedures to import and export goods. The assistance 
will also extend to the creation of a reform coordination unit within the Ministry of Economy.  

72. 
In conjunction with 
the Bank’s proposed economic diversification and 
competitiveness operation, IFC is also investigating ways to develop projects on a PPP basis 
in the infrastructure, tourism, health, and education sectors, once the government’s 
regulatory framework is in place. Similarly, with respect to SMEs IFC has initiated a 
partnership process with Banque Gabonaise de Développement to implement its online SME 
toolkit in Gabon, which provides information and support to local SMEs via a Web-based 
platform. The Business Edge Corporate Value Chain model will also be deployed in Gabon’s 
cement company and other private sector companies.  

73. 
IFC is developing a pipeline for direct investments in infrastructure, forestry , 
mining, and financial markets. In infrastructure, in alignment with the work being undertaken 
by the Bank within the RTA in ports and mining, the focus will be on transportation projects, 
with potential investments in port facilities and early assessment of investment needs in the 
railway sector in connection with mining projects and growth in general freight and passenger 
traffic. IFC has also been asked to consider financing infrastructure in Gabon’s SEZs. IFC is 
currently evaluating potential investments with two forestry companies operating in Gabon (that 
is, the acquisition of new concessions and wood-processing equipment and the rehabilitation of 
production units) and a potential investment in a Greenfield fertilizer plant. Finally, in financial 
markets, IFC is planning to implement its Global Trade Finance Program with at least one 
leading commercial bank in Gabon. Leasing will also be considered as an alternative source of 
asset financing for Gabon, including for SMEs.  

74. MIGA will continue to offer its guarantee products to foreign investors in support of 
the World Bank Group’s efforts to increase sustainable and environmentally sound foreign 
investments with significant development impact. Along with the inauguration of the SEZ 
near Libreville, intended to offer foreign investors a favorable tax and infrastructure environment 
and to attract firms and industries in the wood-processing subsector, MIGA will also follow up 
with existing inquiries from potential investors by mitigating perceived political risks. MIGA 
will support large and complex transactions, particularly infrastructure projects, as well as PPPs. 
The agency will also offer its new product—non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations—

27 

 
 
 
 
and its more flexible Small Investments Program to serve the needs of investment projects with 
smaller volumes. 

C3.  Addressing Vulnerability and Resilience  

75. WBG support provided under the second strategic theme (vulnerability and 
resilience) will be directed toward the achievement of two principal outcomes . The first 
outcome is more transparent and sustainable management of natural resources, and the second is 
an improved knowledge of basic service delivery of health and social protection (see table 4).

Proposed Lending: Natural resource management project (e.g., forestry, fisheries, or mining) 
Ongoing Trust Funds and Grants: Strengthening capacity for national parks and biodiversity (GEF), 
capacity building in environment management of large infrastructure projects  
Proposed Trust Funds and Grants: GEF (STAR allocation and International Waters) 

Note: Refer to figure 3 for structure of CPS results chain. 

76. 
Natural Resource Management. WBG support under this outcome will continue to 
assist the government in diversifying its economy while at the same time taking steps to ensure 
that renewable natural resources are protected and sustainably managed. The government has 
strongly supported this approach under the Gabon Vert pillar of the PSGE. The government has 
signaled its commitment to mitigating climate change by creating the Conseil Climat, which is 
tasked with preparing Gabon’s plan for addressing climate change issues, and by high-level 
participation at several global conferences, including the United Nations’ 17th Conference of the 
Parties in Durban.  

77. 
Under the CPS, efforts will be made to build on the results achieved through the NRM-
DPL, which focused on improving transparency, governance, and law enforcement across 
several important policy areas, including: forestry, biodiversity and the environment, fisheries, 
and mining. The ongoing Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant will continue to support 
important initiatives for enhancing the conservation of biological diversity in Gabon through 
investments in selected national parks and the strengthening of the management of the parks 
network, other protected areas and production forests, and other ecosystems. Furthermore, the 

28 

 
 
 
  
 
sound management of the national parks network should make an important contribution to the 
national economy through employment and ecotourism spin-offs.  

78. 
As part of the RTA, the government has requested additional support for analyzing 
sources of growth in the natural resource management sector. In fiscal years 2014-2016, the 
CPS envisages an operation in agriculture, livestock, forestry, mining, or fisheries designed to 
support the government in creating wealth through the sustainable use of natural resources and in 
promoting national industries. Key results would include both adopting and implementing 
reforms for improved governance and developing an investment climate and planning capacity 
for sustainable development, aiming to generate more value added for the national economy. 
Additional support from regional partnerships and trust funds will also be explored. 

79. Mining. During the CPS period, the government has requested support from the Bank in 
several areas: (i) creation of a computerized mining cadastre (framework), including detailed 
regulations; (ii) formulation of a strategy for small-scale and artisanal mining, with a particular 
focus on the formalization of artisanal gold miners; (iii) management of the environmental 
impacts of mining and quarries; and (iv) capacity building, particularly with regard to contract 
negotiations with international companies. Most of this assistance will be provided under the 
RTA currently under preparation.  

80. Hydrocarbon Sector. As part of its commitment to mitigating the adverse effects of 
climate change, the government plans to reduce gas flaring by 60 percent by 2015. CPS support 
will be provided through the RTA and the Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction public-private 
partnership trust fund. The cooperation to date has focused on providing legislative and 
regulatory advice on gas flaring decrees and on supporting a feasibility study and review of 
operators’ plans to reduce gas flaring. These efforts should result in significant reductions in 
environmental emissions over the next three years, given the clear commitment of oil operators. 
Other potential activities requested by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons are an 
assessment of the national gas utilization plan, including gas to power a urea plant project and 
liquefied natural gas.  

81. 
CPS support for improving the knowledge of basic service delivery for health and 
social protection will be geared toward developing a knowledge repository and statistical 
analysis. This activity will strengthen the government’s capacity for creating effective responses 
to related potential economic shocks, for improving poor social indicators, and for developing 
effective policies for underserved members of the population, including youths and women. 
Gender issues will be examined as part of the proposed assessment of Gabon’s social safety net 
mechanisms. In addition, the CPS proposes to undertake a new household survey to update the 
statistics last recorded in 2005. Finally, building on the findings of the recent Bank-prepared 
PER, the CPS will support the government by reviewing factors such as governance, financing 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
arrangements, health workforce development, and public-private sector relations to identify the 
key bottlenecks to improving efficiency in the health sector.  

C4. Gender Equity 

82. Gender. As indicated earlier, while Gabon is making progress on gender equality as 
measured by some indicators in education and health, considerable work needs to be done to 
decrease gender gaps, particularly in the formal labor market. Access to finance for both SMEs 
and micro businesses and for extension services in agriculture was the most requested by 
women’s groups during the CPS consultations. The Bank’s economic competitiveness and 
diversification operation and the Human Development Education Project will target and measure 
progress in delivering support to businesswomen, female students, and job seekers through 
efforts to improve the investment climate, to expand access to finance, and to enhance training 
for job seekers in the formal sector job market.  In addition, IFC’s support to SMEs (for example, 
through the SME toolkit) and to the Chamber of Commerce will focus on women entrepreneurs. 
The assessment of social safety nets and the Health Sector Status Report will provide broader 
knowledge of the underserved segments of the population.   

D. The World Bank Group Program of Support  

83. 
The CPS plans to enhance development impact in Gabon through combining 
traditional financing with knowledge and direct assistance provided to the government 
under the RTA. With respect to financing, this CPS plans to increase the volume of new 
commitments in Gabon to between US$200 and US$250 million over the next four years. As 
detailed in table 5 below, there is greater certainty with respect to the early years where 
government priorities are clearer. The CPS proposes a flexible approach to programming for the 
outer years of the CPS, and the progress report will provide an opportunity for adjustments as 
needed. This lending range is indicative, and actual lending levels would continue to depend on 
country performance, IBRD's lending capacity, demand by other borrowers, and general 
economic developments. In addition to the RTA, the CPS emphasizes the mobilization of 
additional resources, either from trust funds or from global funds.

E. Results Monitoring  

84. 
The CPS proposes a realistic framework and mechanisms to track the outcomes of 
the program and its impact. It reflects both the ongoing portfolio and the new program of 
proposed lending and analytical work envisioned beyond this current fiscal year. With respect to 
the new lending to be undertaken in the outer years, the CAS Progress Report will also be 
updated to expand the current results framework. To measure the continued relevance of the 
WBG as a knowledge broker, the CPS proposes to track the impact of the analytical program, 
including quality and strategic dissemination. To the extent possible, the impact of Bank 
operations on gender issues will also be monitored as part of the results indicators of individual 
projects and analytical work. Overall direct support will be provided to the various line 
ministries to strengthen their ability to collect and use data through institutional-strengthening 
components in IBRD-financed loans.  

F. Country Systems and Donor Harmonization  

85. 
Country Systems. As part of the fiduciary environment for project implementation, 
WBG projects have relied on project implementation units. Going forward, concerted efforts will 
be made to shift gradually toward country systems. The CPS will support the government and 
work with partners in examining ways to strengthen capacity at the sectoral level, reduce 
transaction and financial costs, and increase the sustainability of Bank-supported projects. The 
Bank will also continue its close dialogue with the African Development Bank, which is very 
active in Gabon, particularly in the infrastructure and transport sectors. 

86. 
Donor Harmonization. Coordinated action with the government and other partners is 
essential to achieving the CPS goals and objectives. Although Gabon’s requirements for 
international assistance are limited, the CPS will also work closely to harmonize efforts with 
other key donors, including China, the European Union, France, and the agencies of the United 
Nations. Over the course of the CPS period, collaboration with other partners is expected to 
become diverse as FDI increases, including investment from other emerging markets.  

V. RISKS TO THE GABON CPS  

87. Macroeconomic Risk. While medium-term economic prospects are broadly favorable, 
Gabon’s dependence on oil makes the economy vulnerable to external shocks. The current 
expansionary fiscal policy heightens this vulnerability, as the increased capital spending is 
funded mainly by oil resources. Achieving Gabon’s goal of competing globally for foreign direct 
investment will depend largely on the success of efforts to accelerate and diversify its economic 
growth. These risks may slow the preparation and execution of projects. No substantial negative 
impact is expected from the European crisis in the short term; however, protraction of the 
situation could imply downside risk. By providing continued support for improving governance 

32 

 
  
and public finance management, including through the RTA, the CPS will mitigate these risks. It 
will also provide guidance through analytical work and policy advice through a social safety net 
assessment, a health sector assessment, and a policy note on human development challenges and 
obstacles to redistribution 

88. 
Institutional Risk. While ambitious, the government’s national development plan raises 
concerns about successful implementation, including the country’s ability to reach its MDG 
targets before 2015. There are also concerns, however, about the authorities’ limited institutional 
capacity to execute the capital budget effectively, given that only 55 percent of the 2010 capital 
budget was executed. Weak analytical underpinnings, ongoing governance issues including those 
relating to public procurement, and poor coordination between ministries could also impede 
progress. These issues may adversely affect Bank projects. Potential project implementation 
issues will be mitigated through the use of project implementation units, with the goal of paving 
the way for a gradual shift toward country systems by strengthening PFM in key line ministries, 
including through the RTA. Projects will also be carefully designed to ensure that they reflect the 
interest and priorities of the various beneficiaries and stakeholders, in particular, the different 
institutions that may be in charge of defining sector policies and regulations.  

89. 
 Political Risk. Having apparently passed through its transition period following the 
death of its long-serving former president in 2009, Gabon is likely to remain one of the region’s 
most stable countries. However, while popular support for Mr. Mba Obame and his self-
proclaimed presidency elicited only limited support, underlying tensions created by those who 
still contest the legitimacy of Mr. Bongo Ondimba’s presidency remain; such tensions were 
reflected in the opposition’s call for a boycott of the December 2011 legislative elections and in 
the request that the results not be internationally recognized. To mitigate these risks in the 
context of the CPS strategy, the WBG will work jointly with authorities to monitor 
developments, including organizing a bi-annual consultation with such nongovernmental actors 
as unions, academics, and other members of civil society. 

90. 
Social Risk. Social unrest could also arise from the high youth unemployment, as well as 
from active labor unions, which continue to squeeze out policy concessions. This risk is most 
likely to be local. Port-Gentil, Gabon’s economic center saw the worst unrest after the 2009 
presidential election. The CPS will seek to strengthen the government’s policy response toward 
mitigating these risks, including analytical and advisory activities relating to employment and 
growth and an assessment of its social safety net mechanisms.

I. Introduction 

This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the 

1. 
effectiveness of the FY05-FY09 World Bank Group country assistance strategy (CAS) for 
Gabon (Report no. 31882-GA), which was discussed by the Board of Directors in May 
2005. It covers the implementation period from Board approval to September 2011. The 
assessment is based on reviews of: (i) implementation status and results reports (ISRs) from 
projects implemented during the CAS period; (ii) aide-mémoires; (iii) conclusions from a 2010 
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR); (iv) interviews with country team members and 
task team leaders operating in Gabon during the CAS period; and (v) self-assessments by the 
country team and task team leaders. The CASCR also draws on the CAS Progress Report 
(Report No. 40890-GA) that was prepared in 2007 and that took stock of the progress to date.  

2.  
During the course of the FY05-FY09 CAS period, significant changes occurred in 
Gabon’s development context. The death of President Omar Bongo in June 2009, after 42 
consecutive years in power, marked a new era in Gabon. While Gabon has been politically stable 
since independence, the period after Omar Bongo’s death was characterized by political and 
social uncertainty. Defeated presidential candidates rejected the results announced by the 
electoral commission after the August 2009 election, and significant social unrest ensued after 
the announcement of the election results. A poll recount, requested by the Constitutional Court, 
upheld the victory of the ruling party’s candidate, and Ali Bongo was sworn in as president of 
the republic on October 16, 2009. He is the third elected president of Gabon. At the time of this 
writing, the situation in Gabon has stabilized; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon also 
expressed his support for the reforms engaged by the government since 2009.  

3.  

Gabon’s economic performance has generally improved over the past five years , 

particularly in relation to achieving macroeconomic stability and initiating structural 
reforms and more transparent management of natural revenues, in particular in the 
forestry, fisheries, oil, and mining sectors. Higher oil prices coupled with the government’s 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commitment to fiscal adjustment and structural reforms have considerably improved economic 
and financial management. Structural reforms—including privatization, improvements in 
budgetary capacity, and the promotion of an attractive business climate—are on track. Major 
reforms have been introduced in the forestry sector and to some extent in the fisheries sector that 
have improved their governance and transparency, as well as fiscal recovery and the quality of 
the services delivered to the private operators.  

4. 
Economic activity was severely affected by the global economic crisis in 2008–09. All 
commodity exports declined in value. Real growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was 
negative (-1.4 percent) in 2009 for the first time since 2002. In 2010, the Gabonese economy 
benefited from the recovery in global growth and rising prices of its main export commodities 
(oil and manganese). Overall real GDP reached approximately 5.4 percent in 2010. Negotiations 
for a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) program are pending. In the meantime, the IMF 
will continue Article IV surveillance.  

The uncertainty arising from the presidential transition affected the implementation 

5. 
of the CAS as planned as well as the formulation of the World Bank’s new CAS, which is 
now scheduled for FY12–FY16. Nevertheless, the CAS period can be characterized by the 
return of the Bank as a provider of financial resources and supporter of critical reforms, 
particularly in the sectors related to Gabon’s natural resources. The Bank also played an 
important role in strengthening donor coordination and harmonization. In addition, in August 
2010, the government of Gabon signed a reimbursable technical assistance agreement (RTA) 
with the Bank for US$2 million, representing a new phase of engagement. The agreement will 
consist of support to public financial management, assessment of potential sources of nonoil 
growth, and update of the country’s poverty profile. Additional technical assistance has been 
requested for the oil, gas, and mining sectors. A series of growth and poverty diagnostics may 
also be prepared for other sectors, including agriculture and livestock, the financial sector, 
fisheries, timber, information and communication technologies, and tourism. 

II. National Strategic Goals 

6. 
Gabon’s human development outcomes fall below those of countries with similar 
per capita income. Gabon ranks 106 out of 187 countries in the 2011 Human Development 
Index of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In addition, many Millenn ium 
Development Goals (MDGs) are unlikely to be met by the 2015 deadline. The third national 
MDG progress report, published in 2010, concluded that MDG targets relating to poverty 
reduction, infant and maternal mortality, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS are unlikely to be 
achieved. With respect to education, Gabon has succeeded in making primary education 
available to all (net enrollment has increased from 88 percent in 1990 to 91 percent in 2005), but 
the need for qualified teachers and classrooms remains a concern. The rates of infant mortality 
dropped from 155 per 1,000 in 1990 to 52.7 per 1,000 in 2010, but it will be difficult to reach the 
target of 31.5 per 1,000 by 2015. Between 1990 and 2010, maternal mortality declined from 600 

48 

 
 
deaths per 100,000 births to 420 deaths, but it is also unlikely that the target of 150 deaths per 
100,000 births will be achieved by 2015. The rate of HIV/AIDS, which had risen dramatically 
from 0.7 percent in 1990 to 8.1 percent in 2005, has significantly declined in recent years but 
remains high (5.4 percent in 2010). 

7. 

The government prepared an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I -PRSP) 

in June 2003, while the full Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) was 
finalized in January 2006. The GPRSP mapped out a program of reforms to help Gabon 
manage its transition from high dependence on oil to economic diversification that harnesses 
private sector growth and makes progress in reducing poverty. The strategy was developed 
through a participatory process, including nine regional consultations. It was designed around 
four pillars: (i) promoting strong and sustainable pro-poor growth; (ii) improving infrastructure; 
(iii) improving basic services; and (iv) improving governance. 

8. 
The government of Gabon has needed time to define its priorities, develop a 
medium-term strategic course, and identify areas for support by international partners. As 
part of its Déclaration de Politique Générale, the government of Gabon, under President Ali 
Bongo, developed and presented a new economic diversification strategy in November 2009. 
The strategy, aimed at transforming Gabon into an emergent country within 25 years, is based on 
three pillars: (i) making Gabon a metallurgic and industrial pole of reference based on clean 
energy, driven by strategic raw materials such as manganese, iron, and gas and a regional 
industry of wood processing (Gabon Industriel); (ii) positioning the country as a pioneer of the 
green economy through sustainable management of its rich biodiversity and the development of 
ecotourism (Gabon Vert); and (iii) making Gabon a center of excellence in higher education and 
research, business, tourism, health, media, and information technology (Gabon des Services). To 
implement this broad agenda, the government has decided to increase the share of resources 
allocated to public investment from 14 percent to 40 percent of the state budget over the 2010–16 
period.  

III. Strategic Bank Outcomes and CAS Outcomes 

9. 
The FY05–FY09 CAS was originally aligned with the I-PRSP, pending completion 
of the GPRSP. The CAS was articulated around two pillars: strengthening the management of 
public resources (natural and financial) for improved social outcomes and improving the 
investment climate to foster sustainable, private–sector led growth. Capacity development in 
government, civil society, and the private sector, as well as improved governance and 
participation, were cross-cutting themes.  

10. 
The CAS Progress Report (2007) concluded that program implementation was on 
track, albeit with delays. The CAS proceeded according to a base-case scenario. Given that the 
original CAS did not meet the full requirements for a results-based CAS, the opportunity was 
also taken to reformulate a new results framework and to restate the links with the GPRSP. It is 

49 

 
 
this revised results framework that provides the starting point for the current evaluation of the 
achievement of CAS outcomes. 

III. FY05-FY09 CAS Results Assessment  

CAS Pillar 1: Strengthening the management of public resources (natural and financial) 
for improved social outcomes. 

11. 
The Completion Report Analysis (annex 9a) provides a detailed analysis of progress 
against the CAS results framework. Expected CAS outcomes under the first pillar included the 
following: 

 

 

Improved transparency and accountability in forestry 

Improved transparency in extractive industry revenues (EITI) 

 More sustainable management of natural renewable resources 

 

Improved collection rates through better enforcement of ―posted‖ tax rates in key 
nonoil sectors 

 Better prioritization of public spending in the GPRSP, development of Medium Term 
Expenditure Frameworks, and the like 

 

Increased access to urban infrastructure and services in targeted areas 

 Better delivery of HIV/AIDS prevention and control services 

Outcome 1: Improved transparency and accountability in forestry; and Outcome 3: More 
sustainable management of natural renewable resources (Outcome 1 and Outcome 3 
achieved) 

12. 
Progress on governance of natural resource management (NRM) has been slow but 
positive. The IBRD-funded Gabon natural resource management-development policy loan 
(NRM-DPL) contributed to important results across a number of sectors. The operation has 
supported the government of Gabon’s efforts to improve transparency, governance, and law 
enforcement for natural resource management, covering four policy areas: forestry, biodiversity 
and the environment, fisheries, and mining and oil. The second tranche for US$10 million was 
released in June 2011. The NRM-DPL has been instrumental in the elaboration of the Gabon 
Industriel vision in the NRM sectors.  

13. 
Progress made under the NRM-DPL is particularly striking in the forestry sector, 
where short-term rent-seeking behaviors were especially widespread. The NRM-DPL 

50 

 
 
 
contributed to the modernization of Gabon’s forest sector through (i) the establishment and 
operationalizing of instruments for improved sector governance and sustainable management of 
forest ecosystems; (ii) the elimination of pricing and market distortions stemming from the 
monopoly of the Société Nationale de Bois Gabonais (the national timber company) on 
international timber sales; (iii) the reinforcement of institutional capacities to improve 
monitoring and control of forest activities; and (iv) a more open and attractive business 
environment for investors engaging in responsible forest management activities in Gabon.  
Among others, the following two quantifiable outcomes can be attributed to the NRM-DPL 
operation: (i) a sharp rise in the percentage of areas in compliance with sustainable management 
prescriptions, moving from 30 percent to 77 percent over the period of the NRM-DPL; (ii) a 
sharp increase in the recovery rate of forest revenues, which has moved from 40 percent in 2005 
to 87 percent for the area fees at the end of NRM-DPL.  

14. Gabon’s fisheries sector has also benefited from the NRM-DPL, which has been a 
vehicle for engaging the Bank in that sector. The results achieved under this DPL go beyond 
the expectations initially stated. For example, the regular disclosure of the fishing licenses and 
associated tax collection status, posted in the national press (on a semi-annual basis) and on the 
website of the Ministry of Finance, places Gabon among the top countries in public access to 
information in the fisheries sector. In addition, conservation measures have been taken to protect 
and restore populations of fish in overexploited or fragile marine areas through the use of GIS -
based technologies and enhanced control activities.  

15. 

The NRM-DPL has also provided support to the environment sector through 

improvements to the country’s capacity to monitor the social and environmental impacts of 
development programs. As a result, the Direction Générale de l’Environnement (DGE) has 
managed to significantly increase the number of control missions (quantity) but also to better 
target the those missions, based on potential major pollution risks (quality). In addition, the DGE 
has substantially improved the quality of the review process for the environmental impact 
assessments/environmental management plans (EIA/EMPs) prepared by private operators. 
Moreover, EIA/EMPs are also available at the DGE offices for public disclosure. The 
foundations set up under the operation of the NRM-DPL will be further elaborated and 
strengthened through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant of about US$400,000 
aimed at strengthening the government’s capacity to manage the environmental aspects of large 
infrastructure projects.  

16. 
In the mining sector, a strategic socio-environmental review of industrial mining 
was conducted in September 2008. The government is currently using the analytical 
background provided from the review to reform the mining sector, particularly the revision of its 
mining code. 

The grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) (restructured in April 2011) 

17. 
is complementing efforts to enhance the conservation of biological diversity in Gabon 

51 

 
 
through investments in selective national parks. Significant delays were encountered in the 
implementation and disbursement of the GEF grant (US$10 million) over the first 30 months of 
implementation. Weaknesses were related to high turnover of staff in the implementing agency, a 
lack of commitment from the Ministry of Forestry, poor understanding of Bank procedures, and 
a complex institutional framework. Nevertheless, after a restructuring of the project following 
the midterm review in May 2010, performance has improved, and the project has now been 
upgraded to satisfactory. The disbursement rate has now risen to 55 percent, and commitments 
amount to more than 75 percent of the total envelope. 

Outcome 2: Improved transparency in extractive industry revenues (partially achieved) 

18. 
Transparency in petroleum and mining revenues received by the government, as 
well as civil society participation, has considerably improved over the past years. Some 
progress has been achieved since Gabon signed onto the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (EITI). With Bank support, the government published its first reconciliation report on 
petroleum and mining revenue in 2004. The second and third reports were published in April 
2007 and March 2008, respectively. Gabon was accepted as an EITI candidate country on 
September 27, 2007. The final EITI validation report was submitted to the Board on July 9, 
2010, and in October 2010, Gabon was designated as close to compliant. The number of 
reporting companies has also steadily increased over this period, and the accounting gap between 
the payments declared by companies and the receipts declared by the government has decreased 
to around 3 percent. Civil society is also actively engaged. A regional seminar on using 
extractive industries for sustainable development was organized by the World Bank’s office in 
Libreville in April 2008 and served as an important catalyst for civil society involvement in 
natural resource management. 

Outcome 4: Improved collection rates through better enforcement of “posted” tax rates in key 
nonoil sectors (achieved) 

19. 

According to the Direction Générale des Impôts, in the forestry sector an average 

tax collection rate of 87 percent was registered for 2009, which is higher than the 80 
percent target established under the DPL. The DPL was designed to increase the state’s and 
the local communities’ share of the revenues from natural resources, including the strengthening 
of collection and transfer of taxes to local communities. Efforts undertaken by the authorities to 
cancel logging permits that did not comply with forestry and fiscal requirements (116 logging 
permits were canceled in 2007, 56 in 2008, 87 in 2009, and 63 in 2010) have had a particularly 
positive impact on more timely and accurate tax submissions and helped mitigate the impact of 
the global economic crisis on the sector. Tax collection rates in this sector have increased from a 
baseline of 40 percent in 2005.  

52 

 
 
 
Outcome 5: Better prioritization of public spending in GPRSP, development of MTEFs (not 
achieved) 

The government has made some progress in improving governance in the public 

20. 
sector and in strengthening the links between the budget and the country’s development 
strategy as well as the budgetary allocation process. The Bank’s Public Expenditure 
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) of 2006 was particularly well 
received and resulted in the adoption of a new organic budget law. The DPL operation was also 
used as a pilot to streamline the public finance management procedures. Both the Ministry of 
Finance and line ministries consider this a major success, and the government of Gabon plans to 
draw lessons from this operation for its public finance reforms.  

21. 
In general, the absence of sectoral policies has constrained the elaboration of the 
MTEF. Although the Bank and UNDP funded two missions to provide training to the 
government as well as to design an MTEF implementation work plan and budget, little progress 
has occurred since the design of the methodology for developing a prioritized action plan for 
2008. Weaknesses are still evident in budget prioritization as well as in its alignment to the 
development objectives. To date, the government of Gabon has been reluctant to involve the 
donor community in this effort, but the recent request to focus heavily on this issue within the 
RTA indicates a change in government attitudes.  

Outcome 6: Increased access to urban infrastructure and services in targeted areas (achieved) 

22. 
52,000 people in target areas now have access to all-season roads within a 500-meter 
range, from a baseline of 1,000 in 2006. The good progress made in achieving this outcome is 
attributable largely to the Bank’s support provided through the local infrastructure development 
project. Despite delays incurred during the first two years, the midterm review of the project 
confirmed that project development outcomes are likely to be achieved by December 2011. 
Other key results include an additional 65,000 people who benefit from improved sanitary 
conditions, compared to a baseline of 500 in 2007. Less positive progress has been made on the 
third component of the project, namely, development of local small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) through increased access to public works contracts; as a result, the project was 
restructured, and funds were reallocated toward the first component, which focuses on upgrading 
community-based infrastructure in low-income settlements. 

Outcome 7: Better delivery of HIV/AIDS prevention and control services (GPRSP) 
(achieved) 

23. 
Implementation of HIV/AIDS and malaria prevention programs is on track in the 
six cities targeted by the project. This outcome relates to the fifth component in the local 
infrastructure development project, as described above. More specifically, the project helped 
develop awareness and prevention programs among construction workers and communities of 
the six target cities that reached more than 78,000 people; it also helped develop communication 

53 

 
 
programs and tools mainstreamed with nongovernmental organizations and specialized 
institutions. As at July 15, 2011, the project had undertaken 72 awareness campaigns or 
workshops in the six target cities, trained 452 budget personnel, and distributed 240,000 
condoms and 3,200 impregnated mosquito nets.  

Pillar 2: Improving the investment climate to foster sustainable, private sector–led growth. 

24. 

Expected CAS outcomes, under the second CAS pillar, included the following: 

 Outcome 8: Reduced distortions in the forest and mining sectors (achieved: refer 
to DPL results under Outcome 1 and 3 
 Outcome 9: Increased delivery of private participation in infrastructure services 
(partially achieved) 
 Stronger local capacity in the private sector to promote the development of SMEs 
(not achieved: refer to Outcome 6 above). 

Outcome 9: Increased delivery of private participation in infrastructure services (partially 
achieved)  

25. 
Progress under this outcome continues to be challenging but is accelerating. During 
the CAS period, Bank efforts to support competitiveness included a Foreign Investment 
Advisory Service (FIAS) report, the Infrastructure Framework Report, the Local Infrastructure 
Development Project, the Road Infrastructure Project, and the IFC program. The Diversification 
Project was not implemented as part of the base-case scenario, but many of these components 
will now be prepared in the newly signed RTA. The Bank had planned a US$75 million road 
infrastructure project to address the fact that only one road leads in and out of Libreville. Th is 
support was not provided following the authorities’ decision to advance its plans to resettle the 
estimated 10,000 persons during the period immediately preceding the 2012 African Soccer Cup 
of Nations.  

A number of Doing Business indicators in Gabon have improved since 2006, 

26. 
including the cost of starting a business, the minimum capital necessary for starting a 
business, and the cost of construction permits. This improvement has resulted in Gabon’s 
moving from 173rd place in 2010 to 168th in 2011. In November 2010, the government signed a 
service agreement with IFC to build on these reforms to improve the business climate in Gabon, 
in accordance with the Doing Business recommendations. IFC has also provided support under 
the Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) Africa to a number of local SMEs. In partnership with 
the Gabonese Chamber of Commerce, this support has been in the form of capacity development 
initiatives, aimed at enhancing SME growth and job creation. Finally, IFC has been pursuing 
opportunities for direct investments. In 2006, IFC committed an equity investment of €25 million 
and a standby facility of €35 million to Veolia Water AMI, a multi-utility holding company with 
operations in Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and India. Veolia Water’s investments in 
Africa (now held through Veolia Water India Africa) include SEEG (Gabon’s water and 

54 

 
 
 
electricity company), which was privatized following an IFC advisory mandate. In 2009, IFC 
also launched a CFAF 20 billion bond in the Libreville-based regional capital market (BVMAC), 
as the first AAA-rated institution to be listed in this market, to contribute to its development and 
to support long-term local currency financing for local companies. All bond proceeds were 
distributed as planned throughout SME and infrastructure projects in the region. 

V. World Bank Group Performance  

The October 2007 CAS progress report concluded that the CAS program—at the 

27. 
time—was on track and that even though implementation had experienced delays, the 
base-case scenario had proceeded as planned. The base-case lending program for the CAS 
represented US$93 million. Efforts to move to the high-case scenario were not initiated because 
of program delays, in particular, with the second tranche of the DPL and uncertainty over the 
Bank’s direction arising from the presidential transition.  

Lending Activities: 

28. 
As of September 2011, three out of the four planned lending operations under the base-
case scenario were implemented or completed: the US$15 million natural resource management 
DPL (approved by the Board in November 2005 and completed), the US$25 million Local 
Infrastructure Development Project (approved by the Board in March 2006), and the US$10 
million GEF grant for capacity development for managing national parks and biodiversity 
(approved in March 2006). The NRM-DPL operation closed on June 30, 2011. The two tranches 
pertaining to this operation were released during the CAS period. Neither the planned FY08 
infrastructure project (originally slated for US$25 million and later increased to US$75 million) 
nor the US$18 million diversification operation (planned under the high-case scenario) were 
delivered during the CAS period. The diversification operation will now be prepared in FY13 as 
part of the new CPS. Planned support for the infrastructure project was dropped following the 
authorities’ decision to advance its plans to resettle the estimated 10,000 persons during the 
period immediately preceding the 2012 African Soccer Cup of Nations.  

Nonlending and Trust Fund–Financed Activities: 

29. Key analytical work delivered during the CAS period included the PEMFAR, a 
review of infrastructure, a FIAS study, and support for GPRSP preparation. The 
Infrastructure Framework Report was used to launch discussions of the Bank’s support for the 
future road infrastructure project and a potential electrification project (still under consideration) 
and support to a regional fiber-optic cable project (Central African Backbone project, CAB). 

As planned in the CAS, the Bank also provided support for the development of 

30. 
statistical capacity in Gabon through the Ministry of Planning for US$399,850. 
Implementation took place from September 2007 to June 2010. The objective of the grant was to 

55 

 
 
support the government of Gabon in formulating a national strategy for the development of 
statistics. 

The three planned technical assistance Institutional Development Fund grants, each 

31. 
for US$500,000, to finance GPRSP implementation work, civil society, and parliamentary 
capacity-building initiatives and support for HIV/AIDS prevention were not obtained. 
Additional resources were mobilized from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility for REDD 
readiness (that is, for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) for 
US$200,000 and from the Institutional Development Fund on the order of US$400,000 to build 
capacity in environmental management of large infrastructure projects. While the latter is under 
implementation and rated satisfactory (after a slow launch of the implementation activities), the 
REDD grant was terminated in July 31, 2010. These smaller trust funds have experienced 
implementation problems, where government interest has seemed difficult to mobilize and 
progress has therefore been slow. 

Through the Oil, Gas, and Mining Division, the Bank  has provided support to the 

32. 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Gabon (―how-to‖ guidance), including 
initial technical support to help the government, industry, and civil society understand the 
key features of EITI and the way it benefits the broader management of natural resources. 
Two international workshops on negotiations of extractive industries contracts and the role of the 
regional civil society were also organized in Gabon during the CAS period.  

33. 
A FY07 mining sector review was proposed in the CAS under the high -case 
scenario. In 2004, the Bank conducted a preliminary mining sector study, which was well 
received by the government. While this study does not constitute a formal mining sector review, 
the Bank has provided further assistance to the mining sector as part of the natural resource 
management DPL that has supported the preparation of a strategic environmental and social 
assessment of the mining sector. Support to the mining sector may also be included in work 
undertaken within the RTA. 

34. 
Disbursement. To date, 80 percent of total committed amounts of the three projects 
that make up the regular portfolio (IBRD and GEF) have been disbursed. Disbursement 
rates have been slow (with an average age in the portfolio 4.2 years) but accelerated significantly 
after the second tranche of the DPL was released in June 2011. The latest development objective 
and implementation progress ratings of the regular portfolio are moderately satisfactory for both 
the Local Infrastructure Development Project and the GEF grant.  

35. 

Delays in reaching effectiveness. The Local Infrastructure Development Project, the 

GEF grant, and the NRM-DPL experienced significant delays in reaching effectiveness. 
Various factors explain the delays between approval and effectiveness: the 2005 presidential and 
2006 legislative elections slowed down the adoption of reforms that constituted effectiveness 
conditions. In the case of the NRM-DPL, which was approved in November 2005, the first 

56 

 
 
tranche was released in May 2007—18 months after approval. This delay was, however, 
expected; given that the release of the first tranche depended on meeting a number of triggers 
that would take time to implement (no prior actions were identified or agreed on). There were 
further delays due to the need to wait for the government to adopt a new finance law so that the 
resources could be included in the national budget before the transfer could take place.    

36. 

No projects have been rated by QAG. 

37. 
In February 2010, the Bank undertook a country program portfolio review (CPPR) 
in Gabon. The review was seen as a positive exercise by the government, project units, and the 
Bank team (including representatives from the country office, task team leaders, and members of 
the Washington-based Country Management Unit). The review highlighted various cross -cutting 
issues that were seen to affect the performance of the portfolio:  

 

Implementation delays, which translate into disbursement delays; a number of 
projects were identified that lacked 2010 work programs and associated procurement 
plans. The development of such plans—where needed—was one of the actions 
resulting from the CPPR. 
 Delays in the disbursement of 2009 counterpart funds.  
 Lack of clarity on institutional responsibilities and accountabilities in certain projects. 
 Staffing issues in a number of project implementation units, including limited 
availability of staff, high staff turnover, vacancies in key positions, and a lack of 
certain technical skills. In response to these challenges, the Bank committed to 
adopting a more systematic approach to capacity development of staff engaged in the 
implementation of Bank-financed projects and programs. The Bank’s Libreville 
office also committed to arranging quarterly meetings for project staff to provide a 
forum for exchanging experiences and lessons in the implementation of World Bank–
financed projects. The first such meeting took place in May 2010. 
 Lack of inter-ministerial coordination and communication between line ministries, 
between line ministries and the Ministry of the Economy, and between various 
ministries and other implementing agents. 

VI. Donor Coordination 

38. 
During the CAS period, the Bank has played an important role in improving donor 
coordination and aid harmonization. Beginning in 2005, donors have met monthly to 
exchange information and discuss possible communal responses or stances toward the 
government. In 2008, the first survey on the implementation of measures set out in the Paris 
Declaration was conducted, and every year donors produce a joint report on support to Gabon. In 
2010, a joint donor-government committee on aid coordination and harmonization was set up by 
the prime minister’s office. The committee has six thematic subgroups headed by the responsible 
sectoral ministries.  

57 

 
 
 
39. 
Donor coordination in the national resource management sectors, and specifically in 
the forestry sector, has been fully operational and active for more than five years in Gabon . 
The European Commission coordinates the donor platform, and the World Bank has always been 
an active member; meeting with the donor platform on the NRM portfolio as well as with 
individual donors has always been central to the supervision mission.  

40. 
At the sector level, donor coordination in the transport sector has improved since 
2006 when the government recognized a common donor platform. With the recent 
establishment of the Infrastructure Thematic Group, the transport sub thematic group agreed with 
the Ministry of Infrastructure to meet monthly under the coordination of the ministry’s secretary 
general. This arrangement has resulted in a restructuring of the road fund, discussions on a 
transport wide policy framework, and sharing of information on donor operations. Further work 
is still needed, however, to strengthen coordination and cooperation between donors and 
government, and other ministries involved in the transport sector—such as the transport and civil 
aviation, maritime transport, economy, and budget ministries—could be included in these 
arrangements. 

The Bank also engaged in capacity development work through the organization of 

41. 
two regional seminars on transparency in the extractive industries and on contract 
management in petroleum and mining. In April 2008, in close partnership with other agencies 
(the International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, United Nations, and Global 
Corporate Governance Forum), the World Bank organized an international seminar on the 
management of oil and gas resources in Libreville. Seminar participants focused on building the 
capacity to manage revenues from these industries, especially oil and natural gas, including the 
negotiation and implementation of oil and gas contracts.  

VII. Client Feedback 

42. 
A client survey was launched in April 2011. Some of the Bank’s effectiveness ratings 
had deteriorated since 2005. These included respondents’ views on the sustainability of the 
Bank’s strategy, the effectiveness of work related to poverty reduction, and interactions with the 
Bank. In contrast, the Bank’s technical, policy, and economic advice was strongly valued as well 
as its accessibility, inclusiveness, and responsiveness. Eighty percent of respondents indicated 
that the Bank should play a more significant role in Gabon’s development. Conclusions from this 
survey will also be included in the new CAS, FY12–FY16.  

VIII. Conclusions and Lessons 

43. 
The performance of the 2005 CAS can be rated as ―moderately satisfactory.‖ In spite 
of the number of challenges, the CAS represented a realistic assessment of what the government 
was prepared to do over the period. Furthermore, the death of long-time ruler Bongo presented 
the government—as well as the people of Gabon—with something of a leadership vacuum that 
has taken time to fill. This situation has resulted in a series of challenges, including government 

58 

 
 
and counterpart capacity, the alignment of Bank work with government priorities, and the 
willingness of key national stakeholders and some in government to pursue reform. As the new 
government slowly defines its place, its ways of operating, and its priorities, it is expected that a 
strong future World Bank Group support program will be developed in Gabon and will include 
lending and nonlending work. For such a program to be successful, coordination and 
communication between the government of Gabon and the Bank, together with donor 
coordination, will need to become stronger. As the Bank develops this program of support, it will 
also be critical that the government clearly communicate where Bank support is most sought. 
The RTA will be an important instrument—and a first step—in developing those enhanced 
relations.  

44. Key Lessons: 

 

 Effective supervision and the establishment of strong monitoring and evaluation 
processes are important for project success.  
 Simpler project design, with clear accountabilities—preferably assigned to one 
ministry—facilitates project implementation.  
 A push to make use of government and national structures for the implementation 
of Bank-funded operations may increase ownership of implementation. Task team 
leaders, however, complain that government counterparts are too burdened with 
day-to-day tasks to concentrate sufficiently on project implementation.  
In spite of being a middle-income country, Gabon suffers from weak capacity. 
Bank operations should 
therefore be accompanied—when necessary—by 
appropriate support for capacity development. 
 Smaller grants and operations tend to suffer from a lack of counterpart interest 
and engagement (notably REDD). 
 The Bank’s role in donor coordination is important, and efforts should be 
maintained to strengthen donor coordination in Gabon. 
It is not clear what the Bank should or should not finance in middle-income 
countries or how Bank knowledge can add the most value. The RTA will be an 
important test for the Bank, as it seeks to strengthen its relationship with the 
government of Gabon, make clear what services it can offer to middle-income 
clients like Gabon, and identify what value that can add.

2.Improved transparency in extractive 
industry revenues (EITI). 

- Transparent licensing procedures in place 
in the mining sector. 

- Increased environmental regulations and 
compliance in the mining sector. 

- Institutional arrangements for 
implementation and sustainability of EITI 
in place, and regular publication of 
figures underway. 

- Active participation of civil society and 
industry in EITI disclosure process 
through the establishment of consultation 
bodies and regular discussion of 
information. 

- EITI recommendations 
implemented (i.e., audit, 
publication of figures, etc.). 

- Increased number of monitoring 
field visits in mining sector. 

- Increased awareness by 
artisanal miners of 
environmental, social, health 
and security issues of their 
activity. 

- Mining sector: Achieved. This includes a 
strategic socio-environmental review of 
the industrial mining sector in 2008 
which provided the analytical 
underpinnings for the revision of the 
Mining Code. 

- Support provided to the management of 
three key national parks in Gabon and 
increase in management effectiveness 
through increased surveillance and 
enhanced planning capacities. 

- Partly achieved: EITI Board review of 
Gabon’s validation report concludes that 
Gabon is considered an EITI 
implementing country ―close to 
compliance‖. The validator concluded 
that all the EITI indicators are met. 
However, the Board was not satisfied 
that the validation report conclusively 
demonstrates that EITI implementation 
in Gabon meets all the EITI 
requirements. Three remedial actions are 
necessary for achieving compliance (see 
Board Paper 13-3-E), and Gabon is 
given 6 month before its status is re-
assessed, in particular indicators 7, 8, 11, 
14 and 15 of EITI criteria.
