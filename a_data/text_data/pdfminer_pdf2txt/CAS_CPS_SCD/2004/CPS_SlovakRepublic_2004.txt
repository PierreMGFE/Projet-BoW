COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

i. 

The Slovak Republic has made great s t r ides in implementing reforms since the FYOl 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and o n M a y 1, 2004, acceded t o membership in the 
European U n i o n (EU). A new framework to govern relations between the W o r l d Bank and 
Slovakia i s n ow needed, one that moves beyond the o l d lender-borrower relationship t o a 
partnership wh ich recognizes Slovakia’s new status. W h i l e f inanc ia l support w i l l have i t s place, 
the emerging partnership i s based o n fac i l i ta t ing knowledge-sharing and p o l i c y advice. Building 
o n this approach, t h e Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) proposed fo r FY05 -07 focuses o n 
analytical wo rk and technical assistance operations designed t o assist Slovakia t o reach i t s goals, 
while leav ing open the poss ib i l i ty f o r broader financial support should t h e Partnership determine 
it useful t o mee t specific needs. 

11. 

The reforms o f the past f ew years have put Slovakia o n a fm foo t ing f o r fu tu re 
progress. Slovakia achieved sustained g row th in excess o f EU GDP g row th rates as pub l ic 
expenditures declined t o an average 39 percent o f GDP f o r 2001-2003, while the f isca l de f ic i t 
was reduced to 3.6 percent o f GDP in 2003. The de f ic i t i s expected to further decline t o 3 percent 
o f GDP b y 2007, and Slovakia i s o n target to meet t h i s as w e l l as other components o f the 
Maastricht criteria. Slovakia’s re fo rm p rog ram to support growth, reduce the deficit, and develop 
a vigorous market economy i s impressive, and includes the in t roduc t ion o f sweeping f isca l 
reforms and large-scale p r iva t iza t ion o f pub l ic sector assets w i t h substantial fo re ign participation. 

... 111. 

Slovakia n o w faces three b road development challenges. The f i s t i s t o continue the 
prudent management o f the economy and meet obligations under the S tab i l i ty and G row th Pact 
as Slovakia seeks t o achieve full benefits f r o m i t s membership in the EU b y adopting the Euro. 
The recent fiscal reforms have created a strong p la t fo rm f o r fulfilling this agenda. A second 
challenge i s to converge t o European income levels and be f u l l y competitive in European and 
w o r l d markets, and to build the capacity t o productively use n ew l y available EU resources. 
Structural reforms t o imp rove labor and capital m o b i l i t y w i l l be important in t h i s regard. The 
third challenge i s to reduce pove r ty and unemployment and t o address the marginalization o f the 
Roma. Unemployment i s much too high at over 17 percent, and, wh i le absolute pove r ty i s low , 
there are deep pockets o f poverty, pa r t icu la r ly among the unemployed, households l iv ing in poo r 
regions, and the Roma m ino r i ty , who comprise nearly 1 1 percent o f t h e population. Labo r market 
reforms are needed, sma l l and med ium size enterprise (SME) development (wh ich should 
no rma l ly generate a high p ropo r t ion o f new jobs) i s lagging, and education reforms a re on ly just 
beginning wh i le lack o f education remains a key determinant o f unemployment and poverty. 

i v . 
Wh i le these are significant challenges, Slovakia has already demonstrated h ow much 
can be accomplished in a short pe r iod o f time. With the continued commitment o f the authorities, 
Slovakia should proceed in the future as it has in the past, addressing these challenges b y 
fo rmu la t ing and imp lemen t ing p rac t ica l and effective solutions. As a partner in development, the 
Bank stands ready t o assist, where needed, in these efforts. 

V. 

W o r l d Bank assistance has p layed an important ro le in he lp ing Slovakia t o achieve i t s 
goals. The objectives se t ou t in the last C A S have been met and in some instances, exceeded, and 
ongoing projects have satisfactory ratings o r better. Ana ly t ic and Adv iso ry Ac t iv i t ies (AAA) 

- 11 - 

have p layed an important role, i s considered a best practice example b y the Bank, and i s much 
appreciated b y the Government. The Bank needs to continue to p rov ide excellent po l icy advice to 
continue t o be relevant. 

vi. 

Fo r the future, assistance w i l l be formulated in the context o f the Partnership Strategy 
guided b y agreed criteria. Such assistance should: (a) have a high p a y o f f in terms o f e i the r equity 
o r growth, (b) complement other sources o f funds o r expertise, (c) re f lec t the Bank’s comparative 
advantage, and (d) have an impact in the near or med ium term, other factors being equal. AAA 
w i l l continue t o be an important part o f the partnership because o f i t s impact o n Slovakia and 
because lessons lea rned in Slovakia are applicable in less advanced countries. 

v i i . 
There are a variety o f ways in wh ich the W o r l d Bank cou ld assist Slovakia to meet 
the challenges ou t l ined above. The W o r l d Bank cou ld assist with reforms t o enhance 
competitiveness in selected aspects o f p r iva te sector development (financial deepening, SMEs), 
ru ra l development, labor markets, legalljudicial, and education. I t cou ld also assist in pove r ty 
reduction and social inc lus ion through proposed w o r k o n a poverty assessment and pove r ty 
alleviation, education, as w e l l as wo rk to reduce the marginalization o f the Roma. 

v i i i . 

Fo r the present, two projects a re under preparation: a Social Development Fund 
Project and a Legal and Judicial Re fo rm Project. W h i l e demand f o r AAA and technical 
assistance i s high, demand fo r additional W o r l d Bank finance i s n o w low, as Slovakia has 
excellent access to capital markets. As the W o r l d Bank reduces the non - f inanc ia l costs o f 
bo r row ing b y simplifying and aligning i t s procedures with EU and country practice and mo re 
effectively introduces i t s products in l ine with the “Management A c t i o n P lan f o r Enhancing 
W o r l d Bank Support to Middle Income Countries” (Sec M2004-0071/1, April 20, 2004), 
effective demand f o r financing cou ld g row in the future. An important in i t ia t ive i s the Bank’s 
proposed approach t o lending t o the EU8 . The EU 8 Technical Assistance Loan Fac i l i ty ’ cou ld be 
accessed b y Slovakia to p rov ide technical assistance beyond the limited capacity o f the W o r l d 
Bank’s administrative budget in re la t ion t o any o f the development challenges that Slovakia faces 
f o r wh ich i t w i s h e s t o draw o n W o r l d Bank support. In addition, sector-wide approaches, poo l ing 
W o r l d Bank, Government, and possibly the h d s o f European institutions cou ld be use fu l t o 
promote o r maintain p o l i c y o r ins t i tu t iona l reforms and thereby leverage EU funding, and/or to 
p rov ide f inanc ia l support t o activities n o t eligible f o r EU funds. 

ix. 

Slovakia has made notable progress in recent years. I t s accession to the EU b o t h 
certifies this progress and presages continued achievements in the future. As Slovakia assumes a 
new status, it i s n o w appropriate fo r Slovakia and the Bank to en ter in to a new phase o f their 
partnership. To meet this challenge, the W o r l d Bank w i l l endeavor t o respond qu ick ly and 
f lex ib ly t o Slovakia’s development needs. Through t h i s engagement, the W o r l d Bank can also 
help Slovakia share i t s development experience with other countries and lay the groundwork f o r 
i t s eventual transition t o donor status.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
W ITH THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The Slovak Republic has made great strides in implementing reforms since the FYOl 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and o n M a y 1, 2004, acceded t o membership in the 
European U n i o n (EU). A new framework to govern relations between the W o r l d Bank and 
Slovakia i s needed, one that moves beyond the t rad i t iona l provider-client relationship t o a 
partnership wh ich builds o n the progress that Slovakia has achieved. W h i l e financial support w i l l 
have i t s place, the emerging partnership i s based o n fac i l i ta t ing knowledge-sharing and p o l i c y 
dialogue. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) proposed f o r FY05 -07 focuses o n ana ly t ica l 
w o r k and technical assistance operations des igned t o assist Slovakia t o reach i t s goals, w h i l e 
leaving open the poss ib i l i ty fo r broader financial support should Slovakia determine it use fu l t o 
meet specific needs. 

11. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 

2. 
Since winning i t s second te rm in September 2002, 
the Government has b&n 
implementing an ambitious re fo rm program with considerable success. However, the four-party 
coa l i t ion lost i t s parliamentary ma jo r i ty in December 2003, although defecting members o f 
Parliament have stated that they are l i k e l y t o continue t o vote with the Government during the 
remainder o f i t s four year mandate. W h i l e Slovakia has achieved an impressive r e f o rm record, 
po l i t ica l views in the country have been divided; fo r example, the EU accession vote was decided 
b y a re la t ive ly sma l l margin. Popular support fo r the reform has been variable, especially when 
reforms t o improve the func t ion ing o f markets have reduced directed benefits, such as the 
adjustment in welfare payments t o reduce them b e l ow minimum wage levels, o r the in i t ia t ive t o 
introduce l im i t e d t u i t i o n payments f o r tertiary education wh ich has been shelved for the t ime 
being. The recent election o f I v a n Gasporavic, who was supported b y the Parliamentary 
opposition, as President combined with t h e m ino r i ty pos i t ion o f the Government, cou ld s low 
down t h e pace o f reform. O n the other hand, a referendum in April 2004, to limit the term o f the 
Government, was defeated, wh ich increases the p robab i l i ty that the Government w i l l rema in in 
o f f ice f o r i t s elected te rm t o mid-2006. The Government i s comm i t ted to press ahead with i t s 
re fo rm agenda and there i s l i t t l e risk o f reversal o r abandonment o f that agenda g iven the 
irreversible nature o f t h e k e y reforms and core o f support fo r re fo rm in the coalition. 

B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

3. 
Progress has been exemplary since the last C A S (January 2001). At that time, gross 
domestic product (GDP) g row th was modest and appeared unsustainable g iven policies and 
structural imbalances then in place. Few structural reforms had been implemented, f isca l p o l i c y 
r isked high deficits w h i l e monetary p o l i c y needed f o r stability resulted in high interest rates, 
foreign direct investment (FDI) was low , and unemployment was high. 

- 2 - 

4. 
Since then, GDP g row th has exceeded 4 percent per year, higher than i t s neighbors and 
w e l l above the EU GDP g row th rate o f 0.7 percent f o r 2003. Public expenditures have declined 
f r om over 55 percent o f GDP in the early 1990s to an average o f 39 percent o f GDP f o r 2001- 
2003, and are n ow much lower than the average f o r EU8 countries. The fiscal de f ic i t was 
reduced f r om 5.7 percent o f GDP in 2002 to on ly 3.6 percent o f GDP2 in 2003. Further 
improvement i s needed because part o f the reduction was due to one -o f f effects, and Slovakia 
w i l l incu r some expenditures to meet EU accession requirements and the in t roduc t ion o f the 
second p i l la r t o the pension system. Tak ing these in to account, the de f ic i t i s expected to g row t o 
4 percent o f GDP but then decline t o 3 percent o f GDP b y 2007, to meet one o f t h e key 
Maastricht criteria and help pave the way fo r the planned in t roduc t ion o f the Euro.’ 

5 . 

A sweeping tax re fo rm was introduced in January 2004, comprising a tax rate o f 19 
percent o n a l l personal and corporate incomes, but with an increased deductible allowance f o r 
l o w income earners. V i r tua l ly a l l tax exemptions were eliminated - gift and inheritance taxes 
were abolished wh i le real estate t rans fe r tax w i l l be abolished in the beginning o f 2005. A 
u n i f o rm value-added tax rate o f 19 percent i s applied t o a l l products, resulting in a ma jo r shift 
f r om direct t o indirect taxes. This s imp l i f ica t ion o f the tax regime should imp rove govemance 
aspects related to taxation, and further imp rove Slovakia’s competitiveness 
f o r fo re ign 
investment. The r e f o rm i s designed t o b e f isca l ly neutral, but the impact o f such large changes i s 
d i f f i c u l t t o predict. Wh i le the early results are encouraging, the Government w i l l need to be 
ready t o react in case revenues do n o t meet projected levels. 

6. 
Core in f la t ion has been kept at about 3 percent in 2003 and ove ra l l i n f l a t i o n was limited 
to 8.6 percent as a resu l t o f fm monetary po l icy w h i c h contained second-round effects o f 
increases in administered prices. The t rend appreciation o f the currency has been kep t b road ly in 
l i n e with p roduc t iv i ty gains despite large in f lows o f FDI. As a resu l t , the current account de f ic i t 
has been reduced f r om 8 percent o f GDP in 2001 and 2002 to l e s s than 1 percent o f GDP in 2003. 
Foreign exchange reserves are robust: the equivalent o f 6 months o f imports. 

C . SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 

7. 
Slovakia needs t o reduce unemployment and poverty, w h i l e addressing the particular 
issue o f the marginalization o f the Roma community. Slovakia’s pove r ty p r o f i l e i s similar t o that 
o f other EU accession c ~ u n t r i e s . ~ Absolute pove r ty i s low , but there are deep pockets o f poverty, 
pa r t icu la r ly among the unemployed, households l i v i n g in poo r regions-especially in Eastern 
Slovakia-and the Roma m ino r i ty , who comprise nearly 11 percent o f the population. Poverty i s 
most severe in geographically isolated and marginalized Roma settlements in Eastem Slovakia 
w h i c h commonly lack basic infrastructure and u t i l i t ies . Unemployment reaches nearly 100 
percent in many o f these settlements and education levels and hea l th status indicators are low . 
Fo r example, on ly 3 percent o f Roma ch i ld ren complete secondary education. At least one-third 
o f the long-term unemployed are Roma. The Government has established an o f f ice f o r Roma 

Acco rd ing to ESA 95 me thodo logy . 
In add i t ion t o the Maas tr ich t c r i te r ia ( f isca l d e f i c i t <3% o f GDP, p u b l i c debt less than 60 percent o f GDP, l o w 
i n f l a t i o n and long- t e r m interest rates, and exchange rate stability), further re fo rms w i l l be needed t o enable a 
successfbl in t roduc t ion o f the E u r o i n c l u d i n g increased labo r marke t f l e x i b i l i t y and f inanc ia l sector re forms .

grant in FY02) wh ich i s responsible f o r coordinating po l icy o n Roma across the Govemment 
(and fo r coordinating the activities o f the Government related t o the Decade o f Roma Inc lus ion 
wh ich grew out o f the Budapest Roma conference cosponsored b y the W o r l d Bank and Soros 
Foundation in 2003). However the po l i t ica l influence o f the Roma i s dissipated and none o f the 
coa l i t ion par tners (and even less t h e opposition par t ies) consider the Roma as part o f their 
po l i t ica l base or responsibility. 

8 . 

Unemployment i s s t i l l h i g h at over 17 percent fo r 2003, although i t declined b y about 1 
percentage po in t f r om 2002. Conversely, employment i s low, at 57 percent, one o f the lowest 
observed in OECD countries. Low -sk i l led workers are fa l l ing ou t o f the j o b market as about a 
quarter m i l l i o n low -sk i l led jobs disappeared during 1994-2002. The re are large gaps between 
workers in the high p roduc t iv i ty FDI sector and, in general, domestic ( inc lud ing state-owned) 
enterprises. Despite recent reforms, employment i s s t i l l skewed towards the pub l ic sector, with 
general govemment accounting f o r over 20 percent o f a l l jobs. 

9. 
Slovakia has taken several legislative steps t o promote gender equality, and fo l lows the 
recommendations o f the 4th UN W o r l d Conference in B e i j i n g as well as EU regulations. A 
Na t iona l A c t i o n Plan f o r Women was introduced in 1997 and Parliament adopted the Concept o f 
Equa l Opportunities f o r Men and Women. Although, implementation o f the new laws has been 
s low in dealing w i t h gender disparities, available data indicate that gender disparities are no t a 
major problem. 

10. 
The recent tax re fo rm creates strong incentives f o r business creation and self- 
employment; but further measures are needed. High welfare benefits approximating the 
minimum wage and high levels o f social security contributions and health care benefits have 
diminished labor force participation. R e c o g r u i n g this, welfare benefits have recently been 
reduced f r om the equivalent o f about 100 percent o f the minimum wage to about 50 percent o f 
the minimum wage. Recently enacted pension re fo rm laws increase the re t i remen t age t o 62 (and 
modemize the pay-as-you-go (PAYG ) pillar inc lud ing through t h e creation o f a mandatory 
second pillar). Sick pay benefits are being reduced t o levels consistent w i t h other market 
economies wh i le co-payments have been introduced, a l l o f wh ich w i l l reduce labor costs, thereby 
increasing labor demand. This package o f reforms should have a pos i t ive impact o n employment; 
but the rationale f o r these reforms i s n o t w e l l understood b y the popu la t ion suggesting the need t o 
increase communication t o help ensure the i r success. Fo r the future, an enhanced focus o n 
education and t ra in ing i s a h i g h p r io r i ty , as are other measures t o induce g row th in SMEs and 
other sectors no t d i rec t ly linked to FDI. 

111. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES: COUNTRY’S DEVELOPMENT 
OBJECTIVES AND PROGRAM 

A. THREE CHALLENGES FACING SLOVAKIA 

11. 
Slovakia n o w faces t h r e e b road development challenges. The f u s t i s t o manage the 
economy prudently and meet obligations under the Stability and G r ow t h Pact as Slovakia seeks 
to achieve full benefits f r om i t s membership in the EU b y adopting the Euro. These require 
further reductions in the f isca l de f ic i t t o meet the ce i l ing o f less than 3 percent o f GDP, managing 
pub l ic debt t o rema in under 60 percent o f GDP, keeping in f la t ion under con t ro l so that it does n o t 
exceed b y more than 1.5 percent the average o f the three best performers in the EU, ma in ta in ing 

- 4 - 

long-term in te res t rates at no more than 2 percent above the interest rates o f the t h r e e lowest 
in f la t ion countries, and, finally, maintaining exchange rates within the E R M 2 fo r at least 2 years. 

12. 
A second challenge i s to converge to European income levels and be f u l l y competitive in 
European and w o r l d markets, and t o build the capacity t o be able t o productively u s e new ly 
available EU resources productively. As it does so, Slovakia w i l l n e e d t o implement structural 
reforms to improve labor and capital mob i l i ty thereby enabling the economy to func t ion 
e f f ic ien t ly after adoption o f the Eu ro when active monetary p o l i c y w i l l no longer b e an option. 
Another aspect o f this challenge i s t o enhance communications to build a broader consensus in 
support o f reform. 

13. 
The third challenge i s t o reduce pove r ty and unemployment and to address the 
marginalization o f the Roma. Unemployment i s much too high - and reciprocally, employment 
i s too low . Labor market reforms are needed. SME development, wh ich should b e a ma jo r 
source o f new employment and innovation, i s lagg ing and Slovakia’s ove ra l l long term 
competitiveness, b o t h f o r fo re ign and domestic investment beyond the currently h i g h l y 
successful automotive sector, needs to b e reviewed and appropriate reforms introduced. Lack o f 
education i s a key determinant o f unemployment and poverty, and education reforms are o n l y 
just beginning. M a n y Roma ch i ld ren s t i l l do n o t attend school regularly o r those that do are o f ten 
misplaced in to l o w qua l i ty special schools o r classes intended f o r the mentally and phys ica l ly 
disadvantaged. 

B. SECTORAL ASPECTS OF THE THREE CHALLENGES 

14. 
Slovakia needs t o build o n recent pub l ic sector expenditure reforms in order to meet t h e 
Maastricht Criteria. A new pension system was approved in 2003, but implementation w i l l need 
t o proceed qu ick ly as the new system i s t o be operating f r om January 2005. Systemic r e f o rm o f 
social assistance i s be ing implemented to imp rove w o r k incentives and reduce the pove r ty trap 
(see para. 7 ) . In fo rma t ion technology reforms are needed as the country moves t o a u n i f i e d 
con t r ibu t ion system. F isca l decentralization t o imp rove effectiveness and accountability i s needed 
w i t h devolution o f responsibilities t o regional and loca l po l i t ica l u n i t s . These and other reforms 
need t o be carefully explained t o the pub l ic to broaden understanding and support. This i s an 
example o f an area where enhanced Government communications are key t o carrying reforms 
forward. 

15. 
Hea l th sector reforms have been introduced ( inc lud ing co-payments, imp roved patient 
management, better con t ro l o n expenditures f o r pharmaceuticals) but recently, the pace o f r e f o rm 
has slowed. As in the case o f pension reforms, Govemment communication o f the benefits o f 
hea l th sector reforms needs t o b e imp roved to garner support f o r the key elements o f the r e f o rm 
program, such as hosp i ta l restructuring and imp roved provider payments methods, among others. 

16. 
Education sector reforms have begun but further progress i s needed to achieve 
competitiveness and imp rove social inclusion. The M i n i s t r y o f Education’s analytical and 
decision-making capacity needs t o b e strengthened. Excess capacity in p r ima ry and secondary 
schools i s being addressed b y loca l decisions t o determine w h i c h facilities w o u l d b e closed, 
based o n national criteria. Tertiary education has been a free good wh ich has l im i t e d the 
ava i lab i l i ty o f resources. The in t roduc t ion o f t u i t i o n re fo rm at the tertiary leve l remains a p r i o r i t y 
f o r the Government despite some p o l i t i c a l opposition. An implementation strategy fo r l i f e l o n g 
learning, inc lud ing the modernization o f the vocational education system, needs t o be developed. 

- 5 - 

17. 
Public administration re fo rm has been pursued b y the Govemment, but further reforms 
are needed. T h e merit basis fo r staffing needs to b e enhanced as there are too inany seniority- 
based pay steps. Limited f lex ib i l i ty prevents needed staffing changes. T ra in ing fo r c i v i l servants 
needs to b e enhanced. 

18. 
The jud ic ia l system needs t o imp rove i t s efficiency and effectiveness to become mo re 
responsive t o the needs o f society and the market. This requires enhanced capacity in the areas o f 
human resources, and in fo rma t ion and document management. The market f o r legal services i s 
too exclusive and the poo r especially need to be g iven greater access to this system through 
better targeting o f lega l aid. A regulatory impact assessment i s needed t o better evaluate the 
impact o f laws. 

19. 
Energy sector reforms have proceeded qu ick ly w i t h substantial privatizations o f 
d is t r ibu t ion companies, the implementation o f a regulatory framework, and t h e development o f 
an energy efficiency strategy. There i s a need t o continue ongoing w o r k t o imp rove the 
regulatory framework fo r electricity d is t r ibu t ion and gas, develop an implementation framework 
f o r renewable energy, and prepare an energy efficiency action plan. 

20. Wide-ranging financial sector reforms have been introduced with t h e private bank ing 
system n o w operating in a reasonably competitive framework. However, further reforms are 
needed to create a more conducive environment f o r financial sector growth. Creditor rights need 
t o be strengthened, the quality o f financial statements needs to be improved, and credit 
in fo rma t ion needs to be made mo re accessible. Non -bank sources o f finance need to b e 
developed, inc lud ing leasing, factoring, ventuse capital, commercial paper and bond markets. A 
strategy should b e formulated to promote the development o f a capital market. F inanc ia l sector 
oversight should b e further strengthened, inc lud ing through effective implementation o f an 
integrated supervision structure under the auspices o f the Na t iona l Bank o f Slovakia (NBS), 
adequate enforcement o f new ly applicable international accounting and aud i t ing standards, and 
enhanced supervision o f the insurance sector and o f b o t h the new mandatory and existing 
voluntary private pension funds. 

21. 
There i s a need to continue t o imp rove the investment climate, especially t o support the 
development o f SMEs as an engine o f growth. The regulatory framework should be f ia the r 
streamlined and simplified t o reduce the adnlinistrative burden that affects the SME sector 
disproportionately. Th is re fo rm w o u l d inc lude further s imp l i f ica t ion o f licensing, permit and 
inspection procedures. 

22. 
In agriculture, Slovakia w i l l need t o build o n an important array o f reforms (such as 
remov ing the large fa rm bias and the emphasis o n self-sufficiency wh i le observing a hard budget 
constraint) b y implementing the single area payment scheme under the Common Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Po l icy (CAP), imp rov ing market linkages, enhancing the competitiveness o f agriculture, and 
p romo t ing ru ra l development th rough e f f ic ien t structural policies. 

23. While Slovakia 
i s developing programs 
t o W h e r imp rove 
transportation, 
communications, and other linkages t o i t s western neighbors as part o f i t s EU accession program, 
i t should also evaluate the need f o r reg iona l linkages t o make sure that development opportunities 
are n o t undu ly constrained. 

i t s 

24. 
Slovakia i s subject to pe r iod ic and devastating floods along the Danube and i t s 
tributaries. In response, it has begun implementation o f a w e l l formulated f l o o d p ro tec t ion 

- 6 - 

program. But the pace o f investment needs to be accelerated g iven the apparent increased 
frequency o f severe and costly floods throughout the region. 

25. 
Finally, the Govemment faces the challenge o f imp rov ing communications to promote 
pub l ic understanding o f and support f o r structural reforms. The pace o f change in Slovakia and 
the perception o f declining welfare f o r many regions and segments o f the population has 
dominated pub l ic perception o f re fo rm and i t s large net benefits. A clear presentation o f the 
benefits o f re fo rm i s needed, with best-practice comparisons t o Slovakia’s European neighbors. 

26. 
W h i l e these are man i fo ld and significant challenges, Slovakia has already demonstrated 
h ow much can be accomplished in a short period o f time. With the continued commitment o f the 
authorities, Slovakia should proceed in the fu tu re as i t has in the past, addressing these challenges 
b y formulating and implementing practical and effective solutions. As a partner in development, 
the W o r l d Bank stands ready t o assist where needed in these efforts. 

IV . PAST WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED 

A. PAST WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE: LEND ING 

27. 
The Bank’s f i r s t CAS f o r Slovakia covered FYO1-03. The CAS proposed assistance t o 
help Slovakia complete transformation reforms, strengthen govemance and build institutions, 
imp rove social security, enhance human development, and meet environmental standards. At 
that time, the new Government was planning a rap id acceleration o f reforms to move Slovakia t o 
the f i r s t rank o f EU accession candidates. The authorities also aimed to improve f isca l 
consolidation to reduce a large deficit, among other objectives. A l though there had been an active 
advisory and technical support program f r om the late 1990s, there were no projects under 
i m p l e m e n t a t i ~ n . ~ The CAS proposed a lending p rog ram o f US$415 m i l l ion , inc lud ing an 
Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL) in support o f sweeping bank ing and 
corporate sector reforms, and a number o f investment projects: Social Benefits Re fo rm 
Administration, Pub l ic Finance Management, Judicial Reform, and Social Sector Investment. 

28. 
The EFSAL was approved in F Y 0 2 f o r Eu ro 200 m i l l i o n (US$177.3 m i l l i o n equivalent), 
and has played an important and wide-ranging ro le in the r e f o rm and restructuring o f the bank ing 
system, strengthening bank regu la t ion and supervision, imp lemen t ing a strategy t o wo rk out the 
large stock o f non-performing claims taken o f f the books o f the state banks, introducing a new 
banking law, measures to imp rove bank accounting and auditing, bank closure and deposit 
insurance, and imp rov ing the lega l f ramewo rk f o r bankruptcy, collateral claims, and the laws 
dealing with corporate govemance, among others. The third tranche o f the loan was released 
(with full compliance) o n April 21,2004, ahead o f Slovakia’s accession t o the EU. 

29. 
The FY 0 2 Social Benefits Re fo rm Adm in is t ra t ion p ro jec t was approved fo r Eu ro 23.2 
m i l l i o n (US$23.5 m i l l i o n equivalent), with t h e objective o f strengthening institutions (to support 
pension re fo rm design, human resource training, and pub l ic information), establishing a u n i f i e d 
contribution co l lec t ion system, and developing a client database and other in fo rma t ion systems. 
The FY03 Public Finance Management Project was approved f o r Eu ro 5.0 m i l l i o n (US$5.5 
m i l l i o n equivalent) and i s n o w p lay ing an important ro le in imp rov ing budget processes, 
strengthening the macro-economic analysis and forecasting capacity o f the M i n i s t r y o f Finance,

strengthening debt management and treasury capability, and supporting effective coordination o f 
the ove ra l l re fo rm effort. The Social Sector Investment Project proposed in the F Y O 1 CAS was 
m o d i f i e d in concept and focused t o address Slovakia’s p r io r i t ies and constraints as t h e FY04 
Hea l th Sector SECA L fo r Euro 55 m i l l i o n (US$62.9 m i l l ion ) , accompanied b y a Hea l th Sector 
Technical Assistance (TA ) Loan f o r Euro 10.58 m i l l i o n (US$12.58 m i l l ion ) . These projects 
support the Govemment’s comprehensive health r e f o rm w i t h measures o n b o t h the demand and 
supply side t o lowe r costs, reduce expenditures leading to f isca l sustainability wh i le restructuring 
the de l ive ry o f health services to imp rove quality inc lud ing measures t o imp rove access f o r 
vulnerable groups. The accompanying T A loan i s an important ind ica t ion o f the importance that 
the Slovak Govemment attaches t o getting the best technical advice to support i t s re fo rm agenda. 

30. 
The five ongoing projects are rated satisfactory in terms o f meeting development 
objectives and implementation progress, and the one ( o f three) closed project evaluated b y OED 
was ra ted h i g h l y satisfactory (see annex B2). 

B. PAST WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE: A A A 

3 1. 
Non - lend ing assistance has p layed an important ro le in Bank support f o r Slovaha, and 
has h a d an important impact o n p o l i c y reforms in p r i o r i t y sectors, as indicated b y t h e Qua l i ty 
Assurance Group’s (QAG ) ra t ing o f the ove ra l l qua l i ty o f AAA as “highly satisfactory.” The 
Development Po l icy Rev iew (Report N o . 26607, June 2003) proposed a range o f reforms t o 
promote structural transformation, new expenditure strategies, and imp roved governance, many 
o f wh ich served as a basis f o r government programs. 
In agriculture, the report “Food and 
Ag r icu l tu re in the Slovak Republic: The Challenges o f EU Accession” (White Cover, September 
2002) proposed a series o f reforms (remove current p o l i c y emphasis o n self-sufficiency, prepare 
f o r the adoption o f EU agricultural policies o n accession, eliminate agricultural po l icy bias in 
favor o f large f a rm s , 
impose hard-budget constraints, and facilitate the adoption o f EU 
compliance in f o o d safety standards b y Slovakia’s food processing industry). T h e repo r t was 
translated in to Slovak and i t s recommendations were adopted almost in t h e i r entirety. In April 
2004, an international workshop was organized t o share the experience and challenges o f 
preparing fo r EU accession with Slovakia’s neighbors, and t o discuss programs and policies, 
inc lud ing Bank assistance, fo r the fu tu re . The two FlAS studies in 2000 and 2001 analyzed the 
regulatory and administrative burdens f o r fo re ign and domestic investment and recommended 
reforms, many of w h i c h have been introduced. The “Living Standards, Employment, and Labo r 
Ma rke t Study” (Report No . 22351, February 2002) p rov ided new in fo rma t ion o n poverty and l e d 
t o systemic reforms o f social assistance and labor market po l ic ies wh ich imp rove w o r k incentives 
wh i le strengthening support to the poor. The study o n “Poverty and Welfare o f Roma in the 
Slovak Republic” (Report N o . 28768, April 2002) was the f i s t study t o address Roma issues as a 
pove r ty and economic development issue, and l e d the Govemment t o request support f o r a Social 
Development Fund wh ich w i l l support demand-driven development 
initiatives 
f r o m the 
marginalized communities. 

32. 
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) p rov ided a comprehensive rev iew o f 
financial sector strengths and weaknesses, supported the implementation o f the re fo rm agenda 
under the EFSAL, and h igh l igh ted k e y additional p o l i c y challenges fo r further development o f 
the financial system go ing forward. In energy, the Bank has assisted in p rov id ing options o n 
ins t i tu t iona l structures t o support a n ew regulatory framework, assisted in the p r iva t iza t ion o f 
d is t r ibu t ion companies, and p rov ided support f o r t h e fo rmu la t ion o f a na t iona l energy strategy, 
while wo rk ing with a b i la te ra l donor (Austria) in developing a renewable energy plan. 

- 8 - 

33. 
IDF g r a n t s have also been an important component o f the Bank’s assistance strategy. 
The IDF grant fo r Bankruptcy Re fo rm assisted with the preparation o f a n ew modem draft 
bankruptcy law, and the des ign o f a regulatory framework fo r bankruptcy trustees. I D F g r a n t s 
have also p layed important roles in assisting jud ic ia l and legal reform, accounting and auditing 
reform, and capacity bu i ld ing f o r the Roma office. An I D F grant fo r Infrastructure Regulatory 
Re fo rm i s assisting the new ly established independent regulator, the Regulatory O f f ice f o r 
N e tw o r k Industries (RONI). An F Y 0 4 grant w i l l support the Government’s efforts to strengthen 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity to formulate and implement a communications strategy f o r t h e re fo rm 
agenda. 

C. LESSONS FROM THE PAST, PERSPECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE 

34. 
The W o r l d Bank has fulfilled and in many respects exceeded the p rog ram ou t l ined in t h e 
FYOl CAS. V i r tua l ly a l l products envisioned in the last CAS have been delivered, with 
appropriate modifications as needed, and these have played an important ro le in assisting 
Slovakia to pe r fo rm as well as i t has, wh ich i s very well indeed. O n the basis o f this performance, 
Slovakia deserves to be robustly supported b y the Bank in the c r i t ica l pe r iod o f i t s i n i t i a l 
membership years in the EU. A l though Slovakia enjoys good access t o capital markets at t h i s 
po in t in time, i t wishes to rema in f u l l y engaged with the Bank in recogn i t ion o f the complex 
development challenges ahead. Should Slovakia’s pe r capita income continue to g row at recent 
rates so that it appears t o be f i rm l y o n a convergence pa th within the EU and i t makes continued 
progress o n structural reforms, i t i s l i k e l y that our future partnership w o u l d strongly emphasize 
Slovakia’s emerging ro le as a donor. 

35. 
During the pe r iod of this partnership framework (FY05-07), Slovakia welcomes W o r l d 
Bank technical assistance and modest amounts o f lending. B o t h are seen as use fu l t o bring O ECD 
and other comparator country experience t o bear o n the problems Slovakia wishes t o address, 
p rov ided the Bank’s technical assistance continues to meet high performance standards. The 
Govemment’s desire f o r rap id r e f o rm design and implementation i s constrained b y capacity, 
since there are rea l constraints o n the speed with wh ich pub l ic administration can be re fo rmed 
and rectified. The Bank plays, and w o u l d continue to play, an important ro le in supplying 
technical assistance to address t h i s constraint. In a similar vein, the Bank i s able t o assist 
Slovakia t o improve multi-sectoral coordination wh ich constrains effective re fo rm . 

36. 
In addition, Government communication o f the re fo rm agenda i s no t strong, with 
consequent lack o f understanding o f goals, nature, and benefits o f economic reforms among 
stakeholders and beneficiaries. Bank pa r t ic ipa t ion in and endorsement o f the r e f o rm p rog ram i s 
important in buttressing Government’s communications with the pub l ic and securing support fo r 
the reforms. 

37. 
T o continue t o p rov ide excellent p o l i c y advice and rema in relevant, the Bank w i l l a l i g n 
i t s support with Slovak/EU p r io r i t ies consistent with Bank corporate priorities. Such advice 
should continue t o be so l id technically and d raw o n the best experience o f O ECD countries 
w h i c h Slovakia i s t r y i n g to emulate. Fo r advice t o be useful, the Bank has t o move exceptionally 
qu ick ly g iven Slovakia’s r a p i d fo rmu la t ion and implementation o f reforms. The “EU 8 
Framework6” paper proposes a new f ramewo rk t o facilitate the r a p i d f l o w o f Bank technical 
assistance, inc lud ing pre-approval b y the B o a r d o f an envelope w i t h i n w h i c h ind iv idua l country

loans w o u l d b e made through streamlined approval procedures covered b y standard loan 
documentation in l i n e w i t h horizontal APLs. 

38 . 
Beyond small amounts o f lending fo r technical assistance, however, Slovakia’s demand 
for Bank funding w i l l be shaped b y the competitiveness in unde r ly ing f inanc ia l terms relative to 
other funding sources, balanced b y i t s f lex ib i l i ty as a risk management too l . The f inanc ia l terms 
available in the future on international capital markets w i l l evolve based o n general market 
conditions and the perception o f specific country risk. Slovakia has, in recent years, imp roved 
substantially the terms o f i t s market access and has been able to bo r row o n the bond market 
recently at rates 3 0 or more basis points be low the a l l - i n costs o f IBRD lending. O n the other 
hand, IBRD’s Fixed-Spread L o a n has several embedded f lex ib le features that can make it a use fu l 
t o o l f o r pub l ic debt risk management. Indeed, no t on ly does the Fixed-Spread Loan o f fe r a large 
number o f possibilities in terms o f customizing the repayment p ro f i le at loan negotiation, i t also 
pe rm i ts changes t o the financial characteristics o f a l l o r pa r t o f the loan throughout i t s l i f e 
(currency, interest rate f ix ing /un f ix ing , i n t e r e s t rate caps and collars). 

39 . 
There i s cu r ren t ly ongo ing w o r k with S lovak p u b l i c debt management authorities t o 
ga in better m u t u a l understanding o f the poss ib i l i t ies s temm ing f r o m the above, w h i c h w o u l d 
a l l ow a clearer fo rmu la t ion o f the Bank ’s f inanc ia l r o l e in o f the Coun t ry Partnership 
Strategy, i n c l u d i n g op t ions presented be low . 

\ 

40. 

Separately f r o m the p u r e l y f inanc ia l terms, there are the add i t iona l ind i rec t costs o f 
b o r r ow i n g f r o m the Bank , such as the number o f steps needed t o satisfy Bank requirements fo r 
each operation, and the t ime needed to complete them. In the context o f the “Framework f o r 
W o r l d Bank Support to EU8 Countries,” the Bank w i l l endeavor t o reduce these indirect costs as 
f u l l y and qu ick ly as possible. Under this approach, the Bank w o u l d accredit counterpart 
institutions in Slovakia fo r investment or po l icy support lend ing (as in the case o f technical 
assistance discussed above) f o r f inanc ia l management, procurement, and safeguards. In so doing, 
the Bank’s Ins t i tu t iona l Fiduciary Assessments w i l l bear in mind ha rmon iza t ioda l ignmen t with 
the EU, and reliance o n p r io r assessment/certification w o r k done b y EU institutions, as w e l l as 
the EU’s mandatory requirements f o r Slovakia to comply with EU directives. Based o n demand, 
the Bank cou ld then respond rap id ly with streamlined approval procedures f o r such operations 
wh ich re l ied o n such accredited institutions. 

41. With this new framework, access t o po l icy lending in support o f either new reforms o r 
existing good policies w o u l d be conditioned o n the country’s performance at the sector leve l f o r 
SWAPS o r SECALS wh i le maintaining satisfactory macroeconomic progress in l i n e with the 
country’s ow n convergence program. There are tw o ways in w h i c h the Bank-Slovak partnership 
m igh t proceed in this case. First, the Bank can bring value added b y assisting Slovakia t o access 
EU funds wh ich w i l l become available t o Slovakia as a new member state; in particular, the 
Structural and Cohesion Funds. In order t o be able t o u t i l ize t h i s EU funding, Slovakia w i l l need 
to generate projects and programs wh ich qua l i fy f o r funding, and the Bank may be o f assistance 
in some o f these, f o r example, b y using the Bank’s p ro jec t modalities where appropriate. In this 
context, the Bank cou ld p rov ide TA t o build capacity at the loca l leve l f o r developing and 
managing the p ro jec t necessary t o access structural funds and use them we l l .7 Further, the Funds 
require co-financing rang ing f r o m 50 to 85 percent, w h i c h the Bank cou ld assist in p rov id ing . 

’ For example, the proposed Social Development Fund wou ld support bu i ld ing regional and local institutions 
which w i l l develop, propose, and implement projects under EU funds. 

- 1 0 - 

Such potential Bank financial support fo r Slovakia wou ld take the f o rm o f co-financing in 
support o f maintaining or implementing p o l i c y and programs. The Bank cou ld o f course also 
p rov ide f inanc ia l assistance outside o f co-financing, should that b e desired. 

42. 
Operations wh ich are selected fo r inc lus ion in the program should mee t certain criteria. 
The reforms that they support should have a h i g h p a y o f f in terms o f either equity o r growth. 
Bank assistance should no t duplicate other sources o f funds o r expertise and Bank assistance 
should re f lec t the Bank’s comparative advantage. Reforms to b e supported b y the Bank should 
have a near o r medium term impact, other factors be ing equal. 

43. 
In add i t ion to lending, A A A has been and w i l l continue to be an important aspect o f the 
Partnership. Slovakia i s a best practice example in the use o f AAA. In add i t ion to the benefits 
w h i c h AAA brings to Slovakia, there i s a p a y o f f t o the Bank in pursuing AAA in Slovakia 
because o f the lessons learned wh ich are applicable in less advanced countries. Nevertheless in 
t h e context o f our evolving partnership the Bank wou ld l o o k to Slovakia t o take o n an increasing 
share o f the costs o f AAA b o t h through cost sharing and bo r row ing fo r T A if particular activities 
grew beyond the Bank’s budget constraints. In addition, costs w i l l also be reduced b y grouping 
AAA as appropriate into regional studies (as i s currently planned in FY05 -07 fo r studies o n 
pub l ic expenditure/fiscal reforms and labor markets). 

V. THE SLOVAKIA-WORLD BANK PARTNERSHIP FY05-07 

A. CONTEXT 

44. 
The macroeconomic scenario o n wh ich the S lovak ia -Wo r ld Bank partnership i s 
predicated assumes continued economic g row th exceeding t h e average f o r EU countries, l o w 
inflation, continuing substantial FDI flows, current account de f ic i t averaging about 3 percent o f 
GDP through 2007, and the Government’s f isca l de f ic i t dec l in ing t o 3 percent o f GDP in that 
year. A l l o f this w o u l d be satisfactory progress towards meeting the Maastricht c r i te r ia and 
subsequently j o i n i n g the European Mone ta ry Un ion . 

45. Within this scenario, Slovakia cou ld finance a ma jo r i ty o f i t s fiscal de f ic i t b y bo r row ing 
extemally, with the imp l ica t ion that i t w o u l d bo r row at least US $ 1 b i l l i o n per year o n external 
markets. The strategy i s t o bo r row in Euros, so that as the country moves towards the adoption 
o f the Euro, r i s k s a re minimized. This i s consistent with exp lo r ing bo r row ing opportunities with 
the Bank wh ich can, o f course, lend in Euros. Should Slovakia determine that it w o u l d l i k e t o 
d raw more substantially o n this partnership, the framework cou ld accommodate lending in the 
range o f US$lOO-150 m i l l i o n per year. The f o l l ow i n g sections outline h o w such a scenario might 
p lay out, depending o n Slovakia’s more precise determination o f i t s needs in the context o f i t s 
partnership w i t h the W o r l d Bank.

important f isca l reforms. Fo r the future, the proposed cross-country Pub l ic Finance Management 
Rev iew should o f fe r a further set o f reforms to restructure expenditures and reduce the fiscal 
de f ic i t to meet t h e Maastricht criterion. There are three aspects wh ich need to be addressed. 
First, assistance to continue reforms in key sectors, inc lud ing health, education, and social 
benefits. Second, t o help s treng then the structures needed f o r effective fiscal decentralization. 
Third, t o rev iew pub l ic administration and iden t i fy further reforms to promote an imp roved cost- 
effective structure. Look ing beyond the proposed Public Finance Management Review, there 
may be scope f o r policy-based lending t o support the implementation o f f isca l reforms, especially 
should these be consistent with Slovakia meeting the p r io r i t ies iden t i f ied in the EU’s Annua l 
Report.

support f o r specific p o l i c y reforms. 

Labo r market mob i l i ty cons tra in ts and po l ic ies wh ich aflect employment. A proposed 

regional Labor Ma rke t Rev iew w o u l d l o o k at ways t o support the development o f a more 
f u l l y competitive labor force with l o w unemployment in the n ew EU members. 

Lega ldud ic ia l reforms. A project (FY05) i s under preparation wh ich cou ld inc lude 
capacity building, imp roved j u d i c i a l infi-astructure, and reforms t o imp rove the market f o r

Improvements in the knowledge economy. This w o u l d build o n the r e s u l t s o f the recent 

Slovakia Knowledge Economy (KE) workshop and ongoing w o r k in education re fo rm . 
The a im wou ld be t o improve national institutions and programs t o enhance the 
transmission and loca l adaptation o f knowledge and technology t o t h e productive sectors. 
Thus, the Bank w i l l seek to assist in building o n the ongoing re fo rm t o increase capacity

E. POVERTY REDUCT ION AND SOCIAL INCLUS ION 

49. 

The Bank-Slovak partnership has been wo rk ing t o prepare assistance in developing and 
implementing policies and programs t o address the inc lus ion o f vulnerable and marginalized 
groups and communities in loca l govemance processes and development. This w o u l d imp rove 
access t o economic and employment opportunities and social services, and further build capacity 
f o r excluded communities t o propose and implement projects, and w o r k with loca l governments. 
Specific issues cou ld be covered as fo l lows : 

i) Pover ty Assessment. There i s a need to update in fo rma t ion o n pove r ty and iden t i fy 
areas where interventions may be warranted, wh ich w o u l d be addressed b y the Living 
Standards Measurement Study (FY05). Th is w o u l d also build urgently needed 
capacity within the Govemment fo r mon i to r ing l i v i n g standards and the impact o f 

- 13 - 

po l icy changes through T A t o the statistical o f f ice and l ine ministries (especially the 
M in is t ry o f Labor, Social A f fa i rs and Family). Slovakia w i l l also need regular high 
qua l i ty household surveys f o r mon i to r ing progress o n the EU social inc lus ion process 
(e.g. 
the “Laaken” 
indicators o f poverty and welfare). Finally, 
the Poverty 
Assessment w i l l more clearly iden t i fy disparities wh ich may be emerging as a resu l t , 
f o r example, o f reforms affecting pub l ic sector employment. 

ii) Pover ty a l lev ia t ion . There i s a need t o improve the prospects o f disadvantaged 
portions o f the population: (i) through economic development and employment; (ii) 
imp rov ing basic communal services and community d ras t ruc tu re ; (iii) alternative 
community-based social care services; and (iv) monitoring, and evaluation. The 
proposed Soc ia l Development F u n d (SDF) project (FY05) wou ld address these 
objectives. The specific components o f the SDF wou ld be: (i) economic development 
and employment; (ii) basic communal services and community infrastructure; (iii) 
alternative community-based social care services; and (iv) project management, 
monitoring, and evaluation. Finally, the project wou ld include technical assistance f o r 
capacity bu i ld ing as w e l l as targeted support f o r developing Roma communities. 

iii) Educa t ion . Beyond imp rov ing competitiveness and enhancing l i n k s t o the knowledge 
economy noted above, the W o r l d Bank cou ld provide financing f o r the development 
o f higher and vocational education institutions and teacher t ra in ing as pa r t o f an 
education modernization program. For the present, the focus i s o n AAA t o address 
higher and vocational education re fo rm issues, inc lud ing the need t o develop linkages 
between education, research and innovation, and subsequently t o pursue project 
fo rmu la t ion as and when requests develop. 

iv) Decade of Roma Inc lus ion . The W o r l d Bank w i l l support Slovakia’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in 
the regional initiative, the “Decade o f Roma Inc lus ion 2005-201 5.” T h e objective o f 
t h i s ac t iv i ty i s t o accelerate progress in imp rov ing the welfare o f Roma in the reg ion 
through setting quantitative na t iona l targets f o r imp rov ing economic status and social 
inc lus ion o f Roma, and developing and implementing national action plans t o achieve 
those targets. 

F. CURRENT PERSPECTIVE ON LENDING 

50. 

As noted above, tw o potential projects are at an advanced stage o f preparation: Jud ic ia l 
Re fo rm and the SDF. B o t h are p r ima r i ly oriented towa rd T A and capacity building. Beyond 
these, the Bank w o u l d be prepared t o assist f inanc ia l ly in other areas o f the partnership 
framework. Future f inanc ia l assistance c o u l d be p rov ided under the proposed EU8 Technical 
Assistance Loan Fac i l i ty t o assist w i t h ins t i tu t ion and capacity building and the EU8 sector w ide 
approach (SWAP) to p o o l W o r l d Bank f inanc ia l support w i t h Government funds related t o 
p r io r i ty programs o r sectors. This approach cou ld support po l icy reforms as well as con t inua t ion 
o f existing good policies and investment programs, and cou ld be used t o co-finance and/or pre- 
finance EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. 

G. RESULTS FOCUS AND COUNTRY PROGRAM MONITORING 

5 1. 
G iven the approach ou t l ined above, the Bank’s r o l e in the Partnership w i l l evolve and in 
any case be supportive o f the Govemment’s efforts. Country performance w i l l be the result o f 

- 1 4 - 

many factors o n wh ich the Bank w i l l have on ly a selective impact. Since the nature o f the 
Bank’s relationship with Slovakia precludes precise programming o f tasks, it i s n o t possible to 
project specific outcomes. However, there are two b road possibilities. First, the Bank assistance 
program cou ld be l im i t e d t o T.A. lending and AAA, should Slovakia determine that Bank 
lending i s n o t sufficiently competitive with other sources o f finance available in the market or 
f r om other institutions. Program mon i to r ing w i l l then need to b e tailored to the impact o f 
increased knowledge and po l icy advice. Second, should the Government conclude that the 
features n o w available in Bank lending products make the Bank more financially competitive 
(para. 3 8 above), Bank lending fo r investment programs and implementation o f po l icy re fo rm 
wou ld be a more l i k e l y possibility. 

52. 
In e i the r case, the Bank should b e evaluated o n the extent t o wh ich i t has reduced the 
non-fmancial costs n o w associated w i t h i t s lending (see para. 40). This wou ld entail pre- 
qua l i fy ing counterpart institutions in Slovakia, and a l ign ing Bank procedures ( inc lud ing financial 
management, procurement, environment, and social safeguards) t o the ex ten t possible with EU 
policies and procedures. The Bank should also be evaluated o n i t s effectiveness in responding 
qu ick ly t o requests fo r technical assistance lending w h i c h may occur. 

53. 
Project-specific evaluation criteria w i l l also be developed f o r projects wh ich a re 
implemented. For example, in the case o f the proposed SDF Project, outcome indicators wou ld 
be the number o f sub-projects implemented j o i n t l y b y loca l governments and communities and 
the number o f beneficiaries participating in projects supported b y the SDF. 

54. 
The second case i s one in wh ich Slovakia determines that Bank lending i s competitive 
with i t s other sources, either in strict financial terms o r if the Bank’s presence enhances, b y a 
sufficient margin, Slovakia’s access t o EU funding o r provides other benefits t o offset any 
fmancial disadvantage. In this case, i t w o u l d be appropriate to have ove ra l l macro outcomes as a 
mon i to r ing indicator, with a special focus o n the f isca l de f ic i t w h i c h w o u l d be gradually reduced 
and maintained t o achieve the Maastricht c r i te r ion o f 3 percent o f GDP. In addition, key sectoral 
indicators should be developed wh ich w o u l d complement the ove ra l l f isca l indicator. This w o u l d 
be determined according to the specific sector o r sectors in w h i c h p o l i c y support was be ing 
extended. 

55. 
The case o f Bank lending t o co fmance EU support i s s l igh t ly different. Here, the Bank’s 
contribution wou ld be t o the fo rmu la t ion o f programs suitable f o r EU f inanc ing (and Bank co- 
financing). However, sector specific outcome indicators wou ld be developed concerning the 
sectors being supported. The Bank w o u l d need to be competitive fmanc ia l ly fo r t h i s t o 
materialize, or almost competitive with incremental costs offset b y the value o f p ro jec t 
fo rmu la t ion under the Bank’s program. Aligning and making m a x im um u s e o f Slovakia’s 
implementation o f EU policies and procedures with the Bank’s as discussed above in para. 40 
wou ld b e very helpful in t h i s regard. 

H. PARTNERSHIPS 

56. 
Support to Slovakia as i t progressed towa rd EU membership has been closely coordinated 
with the European Comm iss ion (EC) under a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU ) signed in 
response to the EC’s Agenda 2000 wh ich called upon IFIs t o assist in the enlargement process. 
The signatories to the M o U include the E C in l ia ison with EIB, the W o r l d Bank, the EBRD, IFC , 
the No rd ic Investment Bank, the N o r d i c Environment Finance Corporation, the Counc i l f o r 

- 15 - 

Europe Development Bank, and the B lack Sea Trade and Development Bank. Regular meetings 
o f the parties t o the M o U help ensure the complementarity o f the respective assistance programs, 
smooth implementation and enhanced effectiveness o f the i r cooperation. 

57. 
The EU program o f assistance i s wide-ranging and w i l l p lay a major role in Slovakia’s 
development, and so i s presented in some detail be low . The Bank w i l l continue to w o r k closely 
with the EU t o ensure that i t s operations are as closely aligned as possible to EU support. 

58. 
Pre-accession EU assistance to Slovakia under the PHARE program (to help implement 
the acqu is communautaive, strengthen administrative capacity and help countries t o develop 
well-prepared investment and ins t i tu t ion bu i ld ing projects) totaled Euro 63 1.5 m i l l i o n during the 
1992-2003 period. Under SAPARD (Special Accession Program f o r Agriculture and Ru ra l 
Development), with Eu ro 38.2 m i l l i o n allocated since 2000, the ma in p r io r i t ies have been 
imp rov ing agricultural production, upgrading ag r i - food enterprises to EC standards, and 
increasing competitiveness. Slovakia has also benefited f r om I S P A allocations (Instrument f o r 
Structural Policies fo r Pre-Accession, f o r infrastructure projects) o f Euro 171 m i l l i o n to support 
one mo to rway and three ra i lway projects, and another Euro 175.6 m i l l i o n fo r environment. 

59. 
Slovakia has been allocated EU financing for 2004-2006 as follows: (i) Structural Funds, 
Euro 1,186.89 m i l l ion , and (ii) Cohesion Funds, Eu ro 570.5 m i l l ion . Accessing these funds w i l l 
require budgetary realignment to accommodate requirements, in addition t o pre-financing and 
other expenditures related to EU membership.

The EIB offers Slovakia subsidized credits and has been very active. The EBRD has also 
been active, having lent Slovakia Euro 625 m i l l ion , invested Euro 218 m i l l i o n in equity, and put 
in place guarantees wo r th Euro 108 m i l l ion , fo r a to ta l exposure o f Euro 952 m i l l ion , in support 
o f projects with a to ta l value o f Euro 3,280 m i l l ion . 

61. 

The IMF continues t o p lay a ma jo r ro le in assisting Slovakia. T h e A r t ic le I V 
consultations and reports p lay a central ro le in mon i to r ing developments, iden t i fy ing needed 
reforms, and recommending improvements. The IMF has also pursued special reports o n f isca l 
and other matters. As a member o f OECD, Slovakia also benefits f r om the regular, in depth 
analyses o f OECD s ta f f and the collective evaluation process. 

V I . CREDITWORTHINESS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 

62. 

At the macro 
level, Slovakia 
i s strongly creditworthy because o f i t s sound 
macroeconomic management and i t s re fo rm program wh ich has attracted large in f lows o f FDI. 
To ta l debt outstanding i s 57 percent o f GDP in 2003 and i s projected to decrease to 52 percent o f 
GDP b y 2007. Debt service i s on ly 15 percent o f exports o f goods and services, projected t o 
decline t o 6 percent in 2007. Even though the recent increase in the dollar value o f debt has no t 
led to an increase in debt/GDP, t h i s was due largely t o the appreciation o f the Koruna, although 
this appreciation in turn reflected rea l p roduc t iv i ty increases. The NBS has been successfully 
implementing a po l icy o f a l low ing f o r appreciation related t o such p roduc t iv i ty increases, but 
also seeks t o avo id large currency swings and a sharp appreciation that cou ld undermine 
competitiveness. Wh i le current levels o f debt and debt service do n o t raise any serious issues, the 
Government intends t o continue to manage debt very carefully in the future in order t o be able t o 
meet the Maastricht criteria, and i s be ing supported in this b y the Bank. 

63. 

The large in f lows o f FDI w h i c h have p layed a central ro le in the expansion o f the 
automobile industry have raised some concems about creditworthiness were there t o be a 
down tum in this industry. However, these large in f lows need t o be put in to perspective. The 
volume o f FDI in Slovakia i s over US$9 billion,* o f wh ich US$1 .8 b i l l i o n i s in the banking 
sector, and US$7 .3 b i l l i o n in the corporate sector. Within the corporate sector, US$3.3 b i l l i o n i s 
in manufacturing, inc lud ing automobile manufacturing, more than US$ 1 b i l l i o n in electricity, 
gas, and water supply, and another U S $ l b i l l i o n in wholesale and re ta i l sales, inc lud ing 
automobile repairs. In sum, something less than h a l f o f FDI has gone t o the automobile sector. 
W h i l e a serious down tu rn in this sector wou ld have a noticeable impact o n t h e economy, such 
risks should be manageable. M o r e important than the macroeconomic r i s k s are r i s k s arising from 
the fact that three-fourths o f automobile sector investment i s in the Bratislava region, so that a 
down tum wou ld pose problems f o r this region. Thus, prudent macroeconomic management 
w o u l d c a l l fo r the development o f infrastructure in other regions o f the country t o re lax 
constraints o n development there. W h i l e FDI i s certainly most bene f ic ia l t o Slovakia, the current 
patterns o f investment do exacerbate reg iona l disparities. Programs t o redress these disparities 
require even more attention in the future than they have received in the past. 

64. 

Potentially large capital i n f l ow s are l i k e l y to continue comp l ica t ing the conduct o f 
monetary po l icy . W h i l e the NBS should focus i t s p o l i c y o n securing a l o w rate o f in f la t ion , large 
capital in f lows may lead t o excessive upward pressure o n the exchange rate w h i c h cou ld 
unde rm ine extemal competitiveness. The key t o reducing incentives 
f o r speculative cap i ta l

in f lows lies in a sustained reduction in the fiscal de f ic i t and lowe r interest rates as w e l l as 
a l low ing sufficient exchange rate f lex ib i l i ty . Sterilized interventions may also be warranted in the 
short term, although they are un l ike ly t o be effective over t ime and further cou ld undermine the 
income pos i t ion o f the NBS. 

65. 
W h i l e a precise lending program i s n o t proposed w i t h i n the Partnership framework, fo r 
purposes o f creditworthiness analysis, a Bank lending program in the range o f US$lOO-150 
m i l l i o n annually was projected, the maximum amount o f lending foreseen in the scenarios 
outlined above. Again, t o test creditworthiness, the ex treme assumption was made that a l l o f this 
wou ld be fast-disbursing. W o r l d Bank debt i s n o w less than 1 percent o f to ta l debt outstanding 
and disbursed, and, under these assumptions, wou ld r i s e to 2.5 percent o f to ta l debt b y 2007, 
wh i le IBRD debt service, wh ich i s n o w on ly 2.3 percent o f pub l ic debt service, wou ld increase to 
3.3 percent o f pub l ic debt service b y 2007. IBRD debt service w o u l d b e the equivalent o f about 
0.1 
Iercent o f the value o f exports o f goods and services through 2007. These key indicators are 
we1 
within the bounds o f creditworthiness. 

V I I . 

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

66. 
Slovakia has made notable progress in recent years. I t s accession t o the EU b o t h certifies 
this 
progress and presages continued achievements in the future. As Slovakia assumes a new 
status, i t i s n ow appropriate f o r Slovakia and the Bank to enter in to a mo re mature partnership. 
To meet this challenge, the W o r l d Bank needs to strengthen i t s capacity t o respond qu ick ly and 
f lex ib ly t o Slovakia’s development needs. Through t h i s engagement, the W o r l d Bank can also 
help Slovakia share i t s development experience w i t h other countries and lay t h e groundwork fo r 
i t s eventual transition t o donor status.

Slovak Republic: Consultations on the Country Partnership Strategy 

As pa r t o f the preparation o f the CPS fo r 2005-2006, a program o f consultations o n the dra f t Strategy 
w i t h the representatives o f Slovak c i v i l society was launched in Slovakia. The p r ima ry purpose o f the p rog ram 
was to seek inputs f r om a wide spectrum o f stakeholders in regard to the future ac t iv i t ies o f the W o r l d Bank in 
S lovaha . The B a n k team also used this oppor tun i ty to meet i ts partners inc lud ing in the remote regions o f the 
country. 

The dra f t CPS document was prepared fo l low ing discussions w i t h the representatives o f the 
Government o f S lovak ia and lead ing op in ion makers. As background, a baseline survey was conducted cove r ing 
a na t ion-w ide sample o f 1,040 respondents. The survey showed that more than h a l f o f the country's popu la t ion 
( 5 9 percent was aware o f the W o r l d Bank. Among those who heard about the Bank, 59 percent had a 
favorable opinion, while 13 percent he ld unfavorable opinions. The W o r l d Bank i s regarded less favorably in 
comparison to the EBRD, bu t more favorab ly than the IMF. 

A lmos t h a l f o f the respondents were unable to iden t i fy the W o r l d Bank's ac t iv i t ies in S lovaha and 
more than 30 percent cou ld no t see a link between the W o r l d Bank 's operations and the re forms p rog ram o f the 
S lovak Government. 

The CPS consultation process consisted o f several feedback instruments/ events: (i) presentation o f 
the Strategy to the government o f f ic ia ls at the Jo in t Po r t fo l io Rev iew Mee t ing in February 2004, (ii) electronic 
consu l ta t ion through the Coun try O f f ice website (Ma rch -Ap r i l 2004), (iii) a series o f consu l ta t ion meetings held 
in three ma jo r cities in Slovalua: Kosice, Banska Bys t r ica and Bra t is lava (Ma rch 29- April 2, 2004). 

Both, the Slovak and English versions o f the Strategy were p laced o n the Coun try O f f ice website in 
the beg inn ing o f M a r c h 2004 and were subjected to comments by w ider pub l ic . In addition, the dra f t CPS in 
S lovak was distributed along with inv i ta t ion letters to more than 700 ind iv idua ls and organizations p r io r to the 
consu l ta t ion meetings. This pub l ic access resulted in a number o f comments submitted b y representatives o f the 
N G O sector, loca l governments, and academics. A l l comments were made available o n the W o r l d B a n k web 

s i te . 

Fo r the consultation meetings, a me thodo logy was developed b y representatives o f the W o r l d Bank, 
in cooperation with the Bank's key N G O counterparts in Slovakia, a Slovak consultancy company h i red as an 
independent fac i l i ta tor for the CPS consultations. In fo rma t ion about the pub l ic consultations was also p laced o n 
the Coun try O f f i c e website as w e l l as on the in fo rma t ion server o f the c i v i l society organizations in S lovak ia 
www.chanaenet.sk. 

Up to 60 people par t ic ipa ted in each o f the three consultation meetings bringing together 
representatives f r om the N G O sector, loca l governments, academics, business, and media. Each mee t ing 
consisted o f two parts. The f i rs t session focused o n the socio-economic analysis o f the S lovak economy and 
the challenges to be addressed. In this regard, the participants were encouraged to rev iew the analysis p rov ided 
in the CPS and comment o n i s s u e s that were either om i t ted o r insu f f ic ien t ly addressed. The second session 
centered o n h o w these challenges cou ld be addressed and the possible ro le o f the W o r l d B a n k in th is process. 
Discussions f o l l ow i n g each o f the presentations took p lace in one o r two w o r h n g groups established o n the 
basis o f ma in themes in troduced in the CPS. The w o r h n g groups then reported the ir observations and 
recommendations during the p lenary session. 

In the process o f consultations the B a n k ind ica ted that a l l the comments and v iews made b y the 
participants w o u l d be recorded, analyzed and discussed among the sector staff. They were also in fo rmed tha t 
the comments w o u l d be conveyed to the S lovak government. 

Participants fe l t that the dra f t CPS presentation was a good starting po in t fo r consultations and that 
the analysis o f the social and economic s i tua t ion in S lova lua inc luded in the document was comprehensive and 

Annex B l 1 
Page 2 o f 3 

objective. Participants also appreciated some o f the special po in ts o f concern, 
including poverty, 
unemployment, and minorities. Overall, i t was agreed that the presentation o f the pos i t ive and negative aspects 
o f the ongo ing transformation o f public administration formed an impor tan t cornerstone o f the analysis. 
However, the c la im was made that the CPS should note that corrup t ion and c l ien t ism i s no t su f f ic ien t ly 
combated, and many ins t i tu t ions are too weak to redress this problem. 

There was some concern about aspects o f the analysis w h i c h were fe l t to be missing o r 
underemphasized, including: [a) the b ra in drain, especially the number o f people with un ivers i ty education 
who leave Slovakia, (b) gender issues, and the greater impac t o n women than o n men in implementing 
education, social, pension and hea l th reforms, (c) 
impac t o f l o n g te rm unemployment (economic, 
psychological, and social), [d) the need to g ive a better qua l i ta t ive as w e l l as quantitative description o f 
poverty, [and that social safety nets have been weakened for f isca l reasons wh i le subsidies increased fo r large 
corporations), (e) analysis o f the ro le o f l i fe - long learning; and (i) transparency o f the ongo ing reforms, and 
the causes o f inso lvency o f the hea l th service. The participants also fe l t that the CPS shou ld l o o k at income 
d is tr ibu t ion with a v iew to assessing changes needed to sustain long- term support fo r the reform.' The strong 
decline in the support o f the Government coa l i t ion was caused b y the fac t that structural reforms were no t 
adjusted to the s i tua t ion faced b y l o w and middle income classes. Soc ia l inc lus ion and pover ty reduc t ion 
strategies should be in troduced before trans forma t ion programs are started, to prevent rather than t ry ing to 
undo the problems they create. 

Concerning the proposals made in the CPS presentation, most o f participants fe l t that a number o f 
recommendations cou ld be improved . They fe l t that the CPS should present a mo re integrated and 
coordinated v iew o f a l l the m in is tr ies in the context o f a 
l o n g te rm v is ion o f g row th and development. 
Concerning the energy sector, the participants suggested a stronger focus o n renewable energy w h i l e greater 
emphasis might be given to the use o f nuclear energy. Generally, adequate supply o f e lec tr ic i ty shou ld be 
ensured. The CPS might l o o k more closely at agriculture and h ow to strengthen ru ra l development. The CPS 
might also re-evaluate the impac t o f the in t roduc t ion o f u n i f o rm VAT. 

Concern ing health care reform, participants fe l t that the Bank had appropriately emphasized the need 
to ensure a balance between supply and demand, but that the imp lemen ta t ion o f hea l th sector re fo rm su f fered 
f r om poor commun ica t ion resu l t ing in a general perception o f a lack o f coordination." I t was emphasized that 
the qua l i ty o f service should be enhanced, poss ib ly b y creation o f a specialized ins t i tu t ion to evaluate service 
delivery. B o t h qua l i ty and quan t i ty needed to b e taken in to account in hea l th care f inanc ing . I t w o u l d also be 
impor tan t to analyze the ex is t ing labor market fo r the med ica l professions in order to better accommodate the 
needs o f the hea l th sector. P r ima ry hea l th care should become a vehicle to better address pover ty . 

Educa t ion was another impor tan t focus o f discussion. W h i l e the Government had accepted the 
concept o f re fo rm through the year 20 10, imp lemen ta t ion was inadequate. Educa t ion expenditures 
accounted fo r on ly a sma l l percentage o f GDP . Resources f l o w i n g to science and research shou ld be 
increased, especially since the i r share in G D P was lowe r than in Poland, Hungary , or the Czech Repub l ic . 
There was a high degree o f m is trus t in the academic commun i ty towards the M i n i s t r y o f Educa t ion 
concerning imp lemen ta t ion o f accepted targets. I t wou ld be impor tan t to depo l i t ic ize the qua l i ty assessment 
system fo r the universities b y creating an independent body rather than leav ing th is with the M i n i s t r y o f 
Education. The Government shou ld enable and encourage the f l o w o f funds to universities, including f r om 
external sources. There was also some support for funding un ivers i ty tu i t ion f r om the state budget. The 
participants fe l t that stronger support shou ld be g iven to enriched/accelerated education for talented and 
g i f ted children, especially outside B ra t is lava where such fac i l i t ies were pa r t icu la r ly lack ing . P r ima ry 
education should be emphasized to better address pover ty /soc ia l inc lus ion .

Educa t ion re forms be ing imp lemen ted had addressed l o w teachers’ salaries, lack o f resources f o r 
research and development and libraries. Fac i l i t ies were so poo r that i t wou ld be d i f f icu l t to imp lemen t a 
me r i t based facu l ty selection. A n y p lan to introduce tu i t ion payments fo r un ivers i ty students shou ld be 
accompanied b y a care fu l ly formu la ted p lan to assist poorer students Adult education was n o t lac lung as 
many schools and businesses had established L i f e l o n g Lea rn ing Institutes. But there was l i t t le demand fo r 
these due to costs, insu f f ic ien t assistance f r om employers, and l i t t le soc ia l impact. A system i s needed to be 
imp lemen ted to support e f for ts o f adults s t r iv ing fo r a un ivers i ty degree. 

With respect to Slovalua’s development agenda, inc lus ive development shou ld also promo te equa l i ty 
between men and women. There i s a need to pro-ac t ive ly reduce gender disparities, takmg account o f 
gender analysis under a l l reforms. The CPS sh.ould also take in to account the aspect o f pover ty among 
females and the increasing income gap be tween women and men. Concern ing social benefits reform, the 
new system to be launched in January 2005 shou ld take account o f gender analysis and adopt measures to 
prevent the pover ty o f females in retirement age groups. A gender mainstreaming strategy as w e l l as gender 
budgeting shou ld be adopted, and a gender analysis system and related measures fo r government re forms 
introduced. Even tua l ly , the expected broad outcome f r om the W o r l d Bank-Slovak partnership should be the 
reduc t ion o f gender disparities and equal opportunities fo r men and women. 

Concern ing pub l ic administration, re forms to derogate responsibilities to reg iona l authorities had n o t 
been accompanied b y f isca l decentralization. There i s also some dup l ica t ion between the central and reg iona l 
adm in is tra t ive authorities. The c i v i l service was overstaffed w i t h con t inu ing s ta f f ing increase, w i thou t 
commensurate increases in administrative capacity. Service standards were low , and the adm in is tra t ion was 
heav i ly po l i t ic ized . 

Concern ing p r iva te sector development, there was a need to remove adm in is tra t ive constraints and 
otherwise imp rove the environment fo r SME development. 

There were also a number o f suggestions concerning pover ty and social inc lus ion . The CPS shou ld 
l o o k at reg iona l disparities and reg iona l development patterns w h i c h lead to the marg ina l iza t ion o f 
par t icu lar soc ia l groups. M a n y measures o f the Government (e.g. FDI incentives) promo ted rather than 
reduced reg iona l disparities. Unemp loymen t needed to be tack led through sustainable job-crea t ion in ru ra l 
areas. Grants and loans by the W o r l d B a n k through commerc ia l banks cou ld be impor tan t i f transparency 
and invo lvemen t o f loca l stakeholders was assured. Assistance shou ld be allocated reg iona l ly . Qua l i ty 
standards needed to be in troduced in social services. Some participants f e l t that independent ins t i tu t ions 
should be developed to p rov ide in fo rma t ion and counseling in the social and lega l spheres. There was also a 
suggestion fo r a l aw to be passed to pro tec t vulnerable groups. Regard ing the Roma in particular, examples 
o f successful projects fo r the Roma popu la t ion shou ld be more broad ly disseminated. Eco log ica l 
agriculture fo r the Roma shou ld be supported. 

Educa t ion fo r Roma ch i ldren i s no t satisfactory and shou ld be enhanced, f r om pre-school through 
un ivers i ty . F o r example, many Romas attend p r ima ry schools f o r handicapped children. A task force o f 
Roma experts i s needed to comment o n and imp rove the Na t iona l A c t i o n P lan fo r Roma Communities. 

F o r the future, ins t i tu t ions needed to be strengthened through transparent technical assistance and 
twinning. The W o r l d Bank ’s ac t iv i t ies shou ld help ensure transparency, partnership, sustainability, and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f env ironmen ta l and social impac t assessments. A thorough eva lua t ion o f past and 
ongo ing s truc tura l re forms which were supported by the Bank shou ld be carr ied ou t b y an independent 
agency. 

F o l l ow i n g the consultations, comments were p laced on the W o r l d Bank ’s S lovak Coun t ry O f f i c e 
website.
