EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

T h e m a in strategic objective of 
the C roa t ian government i s successful accession to the 
Eu rop e an Un ion (EU), so that C roa t ia enters th e EU as a dynam ic and competitive economy that can 
rap id ly achieve convergence to EU l iv ing standards. A c t i o n s f o r successful accession c a l l f o r re fo rms 

tha t w i l l lead t o im p r o v e d macroeconom ic sus ta inab i l i ty and m o r e sustainable econom ic grow th , even 
p r i o r t o accession. 

C roa t ia has enjoyed solid but moderat ing economic g row th and low inf lat ion since 1999. Rea l 

G D P g r ow t h averaged 3.2 percen t during 1999-2003 with i n f l a t i o n in the l o w single digits (be low 4 
percent). These numbers compare we l l with e igh t coun tr ies tha t j o i n e d the EU o n M a y 1, 2004 (EU8) as 
w e l l as the other EU member states (EU15). Howeve r , i t w i l l b e a challenge f o r C roa t ia t o ca tch up, as i t s 
gross na t iona l income per capita (at pu rchas ing p ow e r p a r i t y ) was at about 32 percen t o f tha t o f the EU15 

in 2003. 

T h e economic recovery has been accompanied by a g row ing externa l cu r ren t account deficit. 

T h e curren t accoun t deficit m i r r o r s the w i d e n i n g trade d e f i c i t . T h e curren t accoun t d e f i c i t has g radua l ly 
w idened f r o m 2.5 percen t o f G D P in 2000 t o 8.4 percen t in 2002. The g r ow i n g curren t accoun t deficit 
has been f inanced p r im a r i l y by a sharp r ise in e x t em a l debt, w h i c h has increased t h e ex terna l v u l n e r a b i l i t y 
o f the C roa t ian economy . D e s p i t e s ign i f ican t f o r e i g n d i rec t inves tmen t (FDI) i n f l ow s , ex tema l debt 
soared f r om 60 percent o f GD P and 128 percent o f exports o f goods and services in 2000 t o 82 percent and 
158 percent, respectively, in 2003. 

F isca l performance has been disappointing. T h e governmen t g radua l ly reduced t h e f isca l 
d e f i c i t f r om 8.1 percen t o f GDP in 1999 t o 4.4 percen t o f GDP in 2002. These gains were, however , 
p a r t l y r e v e r s e d in 2003 as heavy p re -e lec t ion spending, espec ia l ly o n large p u b l i c investments, resu l ted in 
a jump in the f isca l d e f i c i t t o an estimated 5.8 percen t o f GDP. The h ighe r d e f i c i t was l a r g e l y f inanced 
t h r o u g h f o r e i g n b o r r ow i n g : to ta l p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y guaranteed debt as a share o f G D P rose t o 51.9 
percen t in 2003, and annual p u b l i c debt service costs increased by 2.5 percentage p o i n t s o f GDP a f ter 

2000. 

Consolidation offiscal spending of a t least three percentage points of GDP i s needed to control 
the debt and to eventually meet the Maas t r ich t c r i te r ia requ ired for the Eu ropean Mon e t a r y Un ion . 

P u b l i c expenditures in C roa t ia account f o r o v e r 50 percen t o f GDP, w h i c h i s high compared t o EU and 
o ther candidate coun tr ies . Areas where C roa t ia spends b e y o n d EU and other candidate coun tr ies include 
the soc ia l sectors, in fras truc ture , subsidies, and the p u b l i c sector wage bill. F i s c a l ad jus tmen t in these 
areas w o u l d need t o b e comp lemen ted with imp rovemen ts in p u b l i c debt management. 

T h e presence of 

the state i n the economy is significant and would need downsizing. Croa t ia ’s 

p r i v a t e sector share o f GDP i s 60 percent, l o w e r than in any EU8 coun t ry . A p o o r l y f u n c t i o n i n g 
j u d i c i a r y , uncompe t i t ive business env ironmen t , and so f t budge t constraints o n e n t e r p r i s e s have l im i t e d 
enterprise res t ruc tu r ing and new bus iness creation, and have cons tra ined g row th . 

Poverty i n C roa t ia is relatively low and shallow. T h e absolute p o v e r t y ra te was 1 1.1 percen t in 

2001, and income d i s t r i b u t i o n o n l y s l i g h t l y less equ i tab le than the EU15 average. The p o o r are p re - 
d om i n a n t l y l e s s educated and e lder ly , and p o v e r t y tends t o b e concentrated in wa r -a f fec ted areas and 
ce r ta in e thn ic groups (espec ia l ly Roma). Limited emp loymen t oppor tun i t ies and inadequate ta rge t ing o f 
the soc ia l safety ne t are t h e m a i n econom ic causes o f i n c om e pove r ty . C roa t ia has one o f the lowes t 
employment-to-population ra t ios : o n l y abou t 43 percen t o f the w o r k i n g age p o p u l a t i o n i s emp loyed . 
This r a t i o re f lec ts r e l a t i v e l y l o w labo r force p a r t i c i p a t i o n (50.2 percent) and high unemp loymen t (14.3 
percent), nea r ly doub le tha t o f the EU.

The ma in objective of 
the CAS is to support the government’s g row th and reform strategy for 
successful EU accession, wh i le ensuring broad par t ic ipa t ion i n grow th and sustainable na tura l 
resource management. R e f l e c t i n g the lessons learned f r o m im p l em e n t a t i o n o f the p rev ious CAS , the

establishment o f a suppor t ive inves tmen t climate, and macroeconom ic sus ta inab i l i ty . 

The CAS includes base, h igh , and low case lend ing programs aligned w i th sustained, 
accelerated, and slow grow th scenarios, respectively, and w i th triggers fo r mov ing from one program to 
another. Expe r ience in E U 8 a n d candidate coun tr ies has shown tha t once EU accession nego t ia t ions are 
under way, m om e n t um f o r r e f o rm i s established and sustained, independent o f w h i c h governmen t i s in 
o f f i c e . Hence with good prospects f o r sustained r e f o rm during Croa t ia ’s pre-access ion negotiations, the 
p lanned four-year base case l e n d i n g vo lume i s abou t U S $ l b i l l i o n , with a n a d d i t i o n a l USS0.5 b i l l i o n in 
the h i g h case. T h e four-year low-case lending v o l um e i s about US $ 3 0 0 m i l l i o n . The increase f r om past 
lending l e v e l s (w h i c h have been o n average U S $ l 5 5 m i l l i o n annua l ly f o r the pas t three years) i s justified 
by the need t o suppor t the acce lera t ion o f d i f f i c u l t s truc tura l r e f o rm s a n d i n s t i t u t i o n building du r ing 
Croa t ia ’s accession candidate pe r iod . 

I n the base and h igh case programs a series of Programma t ic Adjustment Loans or PALs 
(sequenced single-tranche development po l icy loans) w i l l support a government program focusing on 
improvement of 
the investment climate, f isca l consolidation, and strengthened governance, inc lud ing 
rationalization of 
the pub l ic sector. T w o sector expend i ture suppor t inves tmen t operations w i l l 
comp lemen t the P A L s by addressing s truc tura l and i n s t i t u t i o n a l weaknesses in educa t ion and hea l th . 
Inves tmen t opera t ions in o ther sectors w i l l focus o n capac i ty building f o r EU accession, trade and

with the govemmen t ’s debt strategy. 

The results focus of 
the CAS program , and i n pa r t icu la r PALs, requires an effective 
mon i tor ing and evaluation (M&E) system to assess effectiveness. T h e PAL has b e g u n the process o f 
des ign ing an M&E system, w h i c h w i l l be ex tended t o cover the en t i re C A S . C o u n t r y - l e v e l in termed ia te

The CAS has been developed i n consultation w i th the government and stakeholders (w i th 
whom CAS consultations were held i n f i v e cities i n mid-2004), as we l l as the European Commission to 
ensure i t supports EU accession requirements, i n pa r t icu la r the economic cr i ter ia . B a n k instruments 
over the four-year C A S p e r i o d are a l igned t o support these requ iremen ts , and some loans w i l l b e 
spec i f ica l ly a imed at helping C roa t ia t o m a x im i z e i t s u t i l i z a t i o n o f EC gran t funds. T h e C A S and 
Croa t ia ’s S tand-By A r rangemen t with the IMF w i l l also b e m u t u a l l y re in fo rc ing , as they b o t h a im at 
reducing Croa t ia ’s ex terna l v u l n e r a b i l i t y t h r o u g h f isca l conso l ida t ion ,

The ma in r isk fo r the sustained g row th scenario comes f rom po ten t ia l po l icy slippages, 
inc lud ing some of the post-election pledges. These w o u l d d e r a i l C roa t ia fi-om i t s sustainable g r ow t h p a t h

base and high case C A S programs i s addressed through the se l f-regu la t ing mechan ism o f the P A L program . 
In the event that base and high case triggers (wh ich are c lose ly l i n k e d t o PAL conditions) were n o t 
substantially m e t o r were reversed, B a n k assistance w o u l d reve r t t o the l o w case. 

As the cu r ren t H D Z - l e d government i s a coalition w i th a one-seat ma jor ity in Pa r l iamen t , there 
i s a risk tha t it w i l l not be ab le to reta in power over the med ium term . Howeve r , a l l par t ies are 

comm i t ted t o Croa t ia ’s accession t o the EU, and so c o n t i n u i t y o n the associated r e f o rm agenda i s likely 
over the longe r term . Exper ience elsewhere in the r e g i o n has shown tha t b u o y e d by w idespread p u b l i c

A con t inu ing risk for C roa t ia as a n emerg ing ma rke t w i th h igh fore ign currency exposure i n

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Introduction 

1. 

This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s prepared i n consultation w ith the government o f 
Croatia and i t s main objective i s to support the government’s growth and reform strategy embedded 
i n the European Union (EU) accession process. The las t full C A S f o r C roa t ia was discussed at the B o a r d 
in June 1999, and a CAS Progress Repo r t was discussed at the B o a r d in Oc tobe r 2001 . This C A S i s the 
Bank ’s f i r s t four-year C A S f o r Croatia, c o v e r i n g the Bank ’s f isca l years 2005 th rough 2008 . I t has b e e n 
prepared j o i n t l y by the B a n k and I F C in consu l ta t ion with MIGA. A Progress Repo r t w i l l be prepared 
f o l l o w i n g a m i d - t e rm review o f C A S im p l em e n t a t i o n and reassessment o f the p lanned FY07-08 assistance 
program . 

B. Political Context 

2. 

There has been significant political change in Croatia s ince the last CAS Progress Report was 
discussed at the Board. Within mon ths o f being elected, t h e Soc ia l Democra t- led , cen ter- le f t c o a l i t i o n 
governmen t furthered i t s open economy agenda by signing the S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Agreemen t 
( S A A ) with the EU as we l l as the Cen t ra l Eu ropean Free Trade Agreemen t (CEFTA ) , and in February 2003 
i t f o rm a l l y submitted Croatia’s app l ica t ion f o r EU membersh ip . Despite con t inued s trong p u b l i c support 
f o r Croa t ia ’s in teg ra t ion with the EU, the Soc ia l Democ ra t - led c o a l i t i o n was v o t e d o u t o f o f f i c e in 
N o v em b e r 2003, one m o n t h a f ter c om p l e t i n g p o l i t i c a l l y d i f f i c u l t r e f o rm s suppor ted by t h e Bank ’s 
S t ruc tu ra l Adjustment L o a n (SAL ) . 

3. 

The successor government, another coalition, i s led by the center-right Croatian Democratic 
Union party (HDZ), which now projects itself as a centrist party aligned w ith Croatia’s ambition o f 
EU accession. During the coa l i t ion ’s f i r s t f o u r mon ths in o f f ice , the new adm in is t ra t ion focused i t s 
a t ten t ion m a i n l y o n the EU. T h e e f fo r ts have p a i d o f f , with Croa t ia ’s winning a favorab le o p i n i o n f r o m the 
European C omm i s s i o n (EC) in April 2004 and the g ran t ing o f candidate status by t h e European C o u n c i l

D. Recent Economic Developments 

8. 

Since the 1999 recession, Croat ia has enjoyed solid but moderating econom ic growth and low 

inflation. R e a l GDP g r ow t h averaged 3.2 percen t du r ing 1999-2003 with i n f l a t i o n in the l o w s ing le digits 
(be low 4 percent). These numbers compare well with coun t r ies tha t j o i n e d the EU o n M a y 1 ,2004 (EU8’) 
as w e l l as the EU 1 5 . Howeve r , the challenge o f ca tch ing up with the EU 1 5 rema ins high, as gross na t iona l 
income (GNI) p e r cap i ta (at purchas ing p ow e r pa r i ty ) was at abou t 32 percen t o f EU 1 5 in 2003. 

9 . 

The current growth pattern, mainly public sector investments and consumption driven, i s not 

sustainable. P u b l i c investment, pa r t icu la r ly in mo tonvays , has averaged a n ex traord inary 6.5 percent o f 
G D P in recen t years. Accompan ied by a c red i t - f inanced surge in domes t ic demand and a sharp reversa l o f 
f isca l p o l i c y as spend ing d isc ip l ine b roke d o w n in the run-up t o the N o v em b e r 2003 elections, this caused a 
r ise in ex tema l v u l n e r a b i l i t y o f the economy. (See Figure 1 .) 

10. 

The economic recovery has been accompanied b y a growing external current account deficit.

According to the jo in t Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP, 2002), Croatia has a relatively sound banking system. S ince 1996 
the system has undergone major consolidation, and banking regulation and 
supervision have improved. The banking system today i s 91 percent 
foreign owned, and there i s increasing competition for products and 
services. B y the end o f 2003, non-performing loans had declined to 5 . 1 
percent o f total loans, banks’ net open foreign exchange position had 
increased only slightly to 13 percent o f capital, and pro f i tab i l i ty and 
capitalization remained strong. Neve r the less , given the h igh degree o f 
euroization in the financial system, the financial sector remains vulnerable 
to extemal shocks and the possibility o f reduced confidence. Recent 
efforts by the national bank to quell credit expansion have led to 
proliferation o f non-bank financial activity and unregulated leasing 
companies, which has led the govemment to plan a unification o f 
supervision o f non-bank financial institutions. 

11. 

The growing current account deficit has been financed p r ima r i ly by a sharp r i s e in external 
debt, which has increased the external vulnerability o f the Croat ian economy. Desp i te s ign i f ican t 

fo re ign d i rec t inves tmen t (FDI) i n f l ow s , ex terna l debt soared f r o m 60 percen t o f GD P and 128 percent o f 
exports o f goods and services in 2000 t o 82 percent and 158 percent, respectively, in 2003. Ne t in terna t iona l 
r e s e r v e s have rema ined at about 5.7 mon ths o f impo r ts o f goods and non- fac tor services. 

12. 

Fiscal performance has been disappointing and has worked against tightened monetary 

policy. The governmen t g radua l ly reduced the f isca l de f ic i t f r o m 8.1 percen t o f GD P in 1999 t o 4.4 percen t 
o f G D P in 2002 . These gains were, however , p a r t l y reve rsed in 2003 as heavy p re -e lec t ion spending, 
espec ia l ly o n la rge p u b l i c investments, resu l ted in a jump in the f isca l d e f i c i t to an estimated 5 . 8 percen t o f 
GDP.6 T h e higher d e f i c i t was la rge ly f inanced t h r o u g h f o r e i g n b o r r ow i n g : to ta l p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y 
guaranteed debt as a share o f GDP rose from 50.6 percen t in 2002 t o 51.9 percen t in 2003’.

E. Deb t Sustainability and Deb t Management 

13 . 

Ove r the last seven years the level o f Croatia's public debt has been rising steadily in absolute 
and relative terms to about 52 percent o f GDP by the end o f 2003, h igh when compared to Cen t ra l 
and Eastern European countries (CEEC) that stand a t 35 percent o f GDP on average. In fact, most o f 
the CEEC have succeeded t o reduce t h e i r debt levels over the last seven years, while Croatia has observed a 
sharp grow th o f i t s debt o f more than 30 percentage po in ts o f GDP during the same period. Annua l pub l ic 
debt service costs have increased by 2.5 percentage po in ts o f GDP after 2000, compared with the 1995- 
1999 period. Fiscal developments in the last four to f i v e years have also revealed tw o other important 
sources o f debt accumulation: unpa id in terna l obligations o f the pub l ic sector (arrears) and contingent 
l iab i l i t ies in the fo rm o f state guarantees. 
Deb t sustainability analysis shows that fu r the r consolidation o f fiscal spending o f at least 3 
percentage points o f GDP i s needed to control the debt and to eventually meet the Maas t r ich t cr iter ia 
required fo r the European Mone ta ry Un ion? W i t h the current grow th rate, inflation, and h is tor ica l ly 
low in te res t rates, a pr imary f isca l de f ic i t consistent with debt sustainability i s 0 .38 percent o f GDP. The

r e q u i r e d p r im a r y balance is , however , sensitive to the changes in g r ow t h assumptions (see Tab le 2). F o r 
example, i f p ro jec ted g r ow t h averaged 3 percent, the governmen t w o u l d need t o run a p r im a r y surplus o f 
abou t 0.5 percen t o f GDP. T h e high i n f l a t i o n e las t ic i ty o f m o n e y demand suggests tha t the scope f o r r a i s i n g

and changing ep idem io logca l pro f i les have continued t o exert an upward p ressu re o n costs. L i k e many 
countries, Croatia faces a complex and inter-related set o f challenges concerning the hea l th sector’s fiscal 
efficiency, effectiveness o f service delivery in t h e face o f na t iona l needs, organization and management at

Pension system costs are h igh at 13.5 percent o f GDP, above the EU15 average o f 10.4 percent 
o f GDP and E U 8 average o f 8.3 percent o f GDP.15 Only Aus tr ia (14.5 percent) and I t a l y (13.8 percent) 

spend more in re la t ive t e rm s on pensions than Croatia. Replacement o f combined wage-price indexation 
with nom ina l wage indexation in 2004 w i l l inev i tab ly ma in ta in this high burden. In combination with 
“pensioners debt restitution”, which has created the contingent pub l ic debt l i a b i l i t y o f around 10 percentage 
po in ts o f GDP, wage indexation reverses the pa th o f im p l i c i t pension debt that wou ld r i s e above 200 
percent o f GDP. Mu l t i -p i l la r pension re fo rm o f 1998 was des igned to cu r ta i l pension t o GDP ra t io to be low 
11 percent in the f i r s t t e n years and reduce im p l i c i t pension debt be low 100 percent in order to fiscally 
sustain second p i l l a r transition cost that was successfully introduced in 2002. Since current pension po l icy 
has reversed the projected pension spending trends, i t wou ld need t o be r e v i s i t e d in order t o restore social, 
f isca l and intergenerational sustainability o f the mu l t i -p i l la r pension system. 

23. 

Croatia’s spending on social benefits has rap id ly increased over the last year to an estimated 
3.4 percent o f GDP, owing to an expansion o f poor ly targeted categorical benefits. At the same time, 

spending on t h e bes t targeted (and means tested) social support allowance remained at 0.7 percent o f GDP, 
lowe r than in most comparator countries. Para l le l and numerous b e n e f i t systems p rov ided at different 
government leve ls and by d i f fe ren t ins t i tu t ions suggest a need for ra t iona l iza t ion as well as fo r reducing 
disincentives t o re tum to the labor market. H a l f o f social assistance beneficiaries are able-bodied 
unemployed. In some war-affected c i t ies , 30 percent o f the popu la t ion are social assistance beneficiaries. 
There i s a l o n g trad i t ion o f supporting pub l ic social services, but overa l l the social service system i s 
outdated, over-centralized, and over-institutionalized, even as i t faces increased demand.I6 Re fo rm 
p r io r i t ies in the area o f social assistance include better targeting ( inc lud ing through p romo t ion o f loca l 
service intervention), improved sys tem organization and management, a more streamlined cash benefits 
system, and mon i to r ing o f household incomes, expenditure, and behavior t o better i n f o rm p o l i c y makers. 

24. 

The re i s also a need to reduce public sector wage bill and subsidies. The share o f pub l ic sector 

wage b i l l in GDP remains h i g h at 11 percent o f GDP in comparison to an average 7.2 pe rcen t o f GDP in the 
CEEC or 10 percent in EU15. Subsidies t o the enterprise sector,I7 inc lud ing those t o railways, shipyards, 
the Postal Bank, agriculture, and tourism, amounted t o over 3.3 percent o f GDP in 2003, compared to the 
EU15 average o f approximately 0.8 percent o f GDP. Faster pr iva t iza t ion and enforcement o f the 
compe t i t ion po l icy i s expected to lead to less re l iance o f the corporate sector o n state aid. F o r example, t h e 
annual fiscal burden o f the ra i lways sector has reached about 1.3 percent o f GDP, about double that o f 
Bu lga r ia and I t a l y (0.6 percent) and Roman ia (0.7 percent). Restructuring o f the sector through 
discontinuance o f non-economic l ines , adoption o f an op t ima l investment p lan to meet EU standards,

Actions are also needed to facilitate private firm entry. The dominant trends in employment and 
produc t iv i ty show that by far the most dynamic sector has been the private (non-privatized) sector, 
primarily small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, this sector s t i l l on ly accounts for about 35 
percent o f the value added and owns fewer than 30 percent o f the assets. M u c h o f the dynamism o f 
Croatia's economic grow th and employment potential w i l l thus depend no t just on the efficiency o f the exit 
mechanism fo r large enterprises but also on t h e ease with wh ich new businesses can be created. A number 
o f administrative barriers iden t i f ied in the Fore ign Investment Adv iso ry Service (FIAS) 200 1 assessment 
were subsequently tackled by the former government, such as labor market flexibility, company law, 
bankruptcy law, and business registration. However, the findings o f a recent administrative and regulatory 
cost survey show that conducting business in Croatia remains cos t ly compared with neighboring countries 
in t e rm s o f new business registration (time consuming at 50 days and expensive at US$843"), 
inspections, 
hiring flexibility, land acquisition, and s i t e development. S imp l i f ied procedures fo r land t i t le transfer, 
physical planning, and pub l ic u t i l i t ies , together with improved coord ina t ion between government agencies, 
should be pursued to he lp facilitate the creation o f new f i r m s . 
Croatia's judicial system also suffers from inefficiencies, specifically, the court system cannot 
ensure timely and impartial adjudication o f commercial disputes. Also, Croatia lags beh ind six o f the 
EU 8 countries in secured transactions law and enforcement2', despite the number o f judges per 10,000 
inhabitants in Croatia being among the highest in Europe. (See F igure 3.) One o f the sources o f large 
inefficiencies and back log in t h e court system i s the non-adjudicative agenda with wh ich judges are tasked, 
such as maintenance o f land and company reg is ters . The cour t system needs t o be rationalized, jud ic ia l 
procedures need t o be streamlined, accountability and performance mon i to r ing o f judges need to be 
introduced, and professionalism o f judges and court personnel improved.

commercially produc t ive enterprises with strong foreign exchange eamings and employment opportunities, 
and some in the f inanc ia l sector. I F C has also been helping Croatian companies g row in to regional industry 
leaders. I F C ac t iv i ty in Croatia has been constrained, however, by t h e country’s s low pace o f privatization, 
corruption concerns, high labor costs, and the importance o f n o t c rowd ing out t h e pr iva te sector in an

encourage the authorities to reduce the country’s macroeconomic vu lne rab i l i ty and embark o n the nex t

Effectiveness o n April 21, 2004. The C A E assessed the ro le o f Bank assistance to Croatia during 1991- 
2003, during wh ich the Bank made 22 loans to ta l ing US$1.2 b i l l i o n in commitments. The key f ind ings o f 
OED’s C A E are that while the reconstruction loans in t h e i n i t i a l phase o f Bank assistance had successful 
outcomes, loans t o re fo rm pub l ic finance, promote growth, and strengthen public administration have been 
less successful. O ED concludes that Bank assistance has fa l len short in p romo t ing the pr iva t iza t ion process 
and had limited impact o n imp rov ing the e f f ic iency o f the jud ic ia ry o r o f pub l ic expenditure for highways 
or railroads. However, the Bank has been instrumental in he lp ing to launch labor and pension re forms and 
was highly successful in t h e f inanc ia l sector. Go ing forward, OED recommends that Bank lending for 
ma jor infi-astmcture, whether investment o r adjustment lending, should be predicated o n implementation o f 
sector po l icy reform. (See Table 6 fo r a summary o f C A E lessons and recommendations).

C. Planned Assistance P rog ram

51. 

The CAS lays out a base case and a h igh case program , as we l l as a low case p rog ram for 
Bank assistance, aligned w i t h performance tha t leads to the sustained, accelerated, and slow growth 

scenarios, respectively. Expe r ience in E U 8 and cu r ren t candidate coun tr ies has shown tha t once EU 
accession nego t ia t ions are unde r way, m om e n t um f o r r e f o rm i s established and sustained, independent o f 
w h i c h governmen t i s in o f f ice . H e n c e with s t rong prospects f o r sustained r e f o r m during Croa t ia ’s pre- 
accession nego t ia t ions even with tu rnove rs in governmen t adm in is tra t ion , the p l a n n e d four-year base case 
l e n d i n g v o l um e i s about U S $ 1 b i l l i o n , with a n add i t iona l US$O.5 b i l l i o n in the high case, w h i l e the p lanned 
four-year low-case l e n d i n g v o l um e i s abou t U S $ 3 0 0 m i l l i o n . This increase ove r the pas t C A S i s j u s t i f i e d 
by the m a j o r and accelerated r e f o rm s needed t o enable C roa t ia t o m a x im i z e the bene f i ts o f EU membersh ip . 

52. 

The re are three triggers to determine whether C roa t ia i s in the base case at any t ime dur ing 

the CA S period: (a) ma in tenance o f a sa t is fac tory macroeconom ic f r am ew o r k and f isca l conso l ida t ion ; (b)

recognize and support implementation o f ma jo r infrastructure reforms tha t have been a p r ima ry 
cause o f the current h igh debt and fiscal situation, and have proven d iff icu lt in the past and where 
increased investment w i l l be needed to prepare for European integration. These high case tr iggers are: 

(i) r o a d transpor t sector expend i ture r e f o rm s (as recommended by t h e CAE), (ii) accelerated res t ruc tu r ing o f 
the r a i lw a y s sector, and (iii) accelerated imp lemen ta t ion o f energy sector r e f o rm s requ i red p r i o r t o EU

ii. Accelerated Growth Scenario 

75. 

Under the accelerated growth scenario, Croatia would undertake a fast-track reform 
program that increases the economic growth rate towards 5.5 percent by 2007 with inflation falling to 

2 percent. In add i t ion to po l ic ies envisaged under the sustained g row th scenario t o reduce external 
vulnerability, Croatia wou ld undertake third generation re forms in the infrastructure sectors, accelerate the 
f isca l consolidation process and administrative and jud ic ia l reforms, and complete the pr iva t iza t ion process. 
The scope and pace o f such a re fo rm program wou ld change investors’ sen t imen t and stimulate a significant 
increase in annual FDI f lows close to 7 percent o f GDP in 2007. Under such assumptions, i t i s estimated 
that external debt wou ld f a l l to be low 66 percent o f GDP with current account de f ic i t fa l l ing to 2.5 percent 
as a result o f export-oriented pr iva te sector inves tmen ts . Pnva t iza t ion receipts and f isca l sustainability 
reached in 2006 wou ld a l low the ra t io o f direct public debt t o GDP to f a l l towards 3 8 percent. 

76. 

Under the accelerated growth scenario, medium-term financing requirements during 2004-07 
are estimated to be about US$4.7 billion per year, but with a trend falling towards US$3.6 billion in 

2007. Pnnc ipa l repayment requ i remen ts o n external debt w o u l d decrease to 6.3 percent o f GDP by 2007. 
FDI f lows are expected to prov ide more than 40 pe rcen t o f external financing. The external f inanc ing gap 
wou ld be financed ma in ly f rom new fore ign commercial borrowing, depending on the vo lume o f lend ing by 
t h e other international f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions ( IF Is) , ava i lab i l i ty o f pre-accession funds, and Croatia’s 
absorptive capacity. New disbursements o f long- term debt wou ld gradually f a l l to 5 percent o f GDP, out o f 
wh ich o f f ic ia l creditors’ par t ic ipa t ion in new bo r row ing wou ld account for one-third and rema in at 1.5 
percent o f GDP in 2007. IBRD disbursements are estimated at US$302 m i l l i o n a year, wh ich wou ld cover 
about 6.4 percent o f to ta l f inanc ing needs.

iii. Slow Growth Scenario 

77 . 

Under the slow growth scenario Croatia’s structural reform program has yet t o gain 

momentum and broad public support. Slower progress in f isca l consolidation and administrative and 
jud ic ia l re fo rm wou ld adversely affect pr iva te inves tmen t . Less pro f i tab le pr iva te investments wou ld lowe r 
prospects fo r growth, cause deterioration in competitiveness, and lead to higher f isca l and external 
imbalances. Under such assumptions, i t i s estimated that GDP g row th wou ld f a l l to 2.7 percent o n average 
annually over the medium t e r m with s t i l l re la t ive ly l o w in f la t ion . 

78. 

Under the slow growth scenario, medium-term financing requirements during 2004-07 are 

estimated t o be about US$4.9 billion per year. FDI f lows are expected t o p rov ide on ly one - f i f th o f 
external financing. T h e external f inanc ing gap wou ld be financed ma in ly f rom new fore ign commerc ia l 
borrowing, but as the current account de f ic i t s h t l n k s v e r y gradually, external debt (measured in USD) i s 
expected to decline on ly modestly to 80 percent o f GDP in 2007. New disbursements o f long- term debt 
wou ld rema in high on average at 11 percent o f GDP over the who le projected period, out o f wh ich o f f i c i a l 
creditors’ par t ic ipa t ion in new bo r row ing wou ld diminish towards 0.6 percen t o f GDP in 2007. IBRD 
disbursements under the s low g row th scenario are US$116 m i l l i o n a year and cover approximately 2 
percent o f to ta l f inanc ing needs. (See Annex B6 fo r macroeconomic indicators under t h e three scenarios 
d iscussed above.)

The evaluation component o f the system w i l l be enhanced b y the PAL instrument itself, as 
du r ing preparat ion o f the successor PALs the Bank and the government w i l l assess the outcomes o f 
the PAL p rog ram to date and determine whether adjustments a re necessary. T o tha t end, surveys 

(such as the FIAS A dm i n i s t r a t i v e and Regu la to ry Cos t Surveys) and focus groups (such as those o n 
business env ironmen t) w i l l b e used t o p r o v i d e stakeholder feedback. T h i s w i l l comp lemen t quan t i ta t ive

T o improve institutional capacity in bo th the ministries and the Bank’s Coun t ry Office, a long

grant funds in 2005, the EC w i l l have a comparative advantage in terms o f f inanc ia l support. In

Commun i ty Assistance fo r Reconstruction, Development and Stabilization (CARDS) Program. The 2004 
CARDS Program i s fo r a to ta l o f 76 m i l l i o n euro, t o b e comm i t ted over the next three years. Priorities fo r 
CARDS funding are focused in five areas: jud ic ia l re fo rm (29 percent), economic and social development 
(23 percent), r e t u r n o f re fugees and c i v i l society development (23 percent), ins t i tu t ion bu i ld ing and pub l ic

Box 3: Croatia’s Relationship w ith the IMF 

Croatia has signed three precauliona~y SBAs w i th the IMF. T h e second SBA, approved hy the IMF Board i n February 2003, in 
an aniount equivafent to SUR 105.9 m i l l ion for a period o f 14 months, went o f f track in late 2003 and expired in April 2004. 
‘The (;oveminent d id not make any purchases. The th ird review was not completed as fiscal po l icy went o f f track in the nin-up 
to the November Parlianientary elections, T h e fiscal deficit target f%r 2003 was missed by inore than I percent o f GDP: and 
quasi-fiscal operations and contingent liabilities expanded. I n early Febm .ry 2004 the new governnient requested a successor 
SBA. O n August 4, 2004 the Fund Board approved the S ta f f Report for the k r t i c l e I V Consultation and Request for SBA, The 
new arrangement, in an amount equivalent to S I X 97 m i l l ion for i ] period o f 20 months, w i l l be treated as precautionary, as 
were the two preceding arrangements. ‘The major objective of the new SRA i s to reduce external vulnerability through more 
forceful fiscal connsoIidatictn. A fiscal and quas i- f isca l adjustment o f 2 .75 perceiitage points of GL>P should help to reduce the

collaborating closely with the IMF to ensure syne rg ies between the macroeconomic re forms supported 
under the SBA and the structural re forms to b e supported under the proposed P A L program, especially 
those dealing with fiscal consolidation and public expenditure. The new SBA and the proposed P A L

costs have increased f o r 2.5 percentage po in ts o f GDP a f ter 2000, compared with the 1995-1999 period. 
In order t o s u s t a i n macroeconom ic s tab i l i ty , with the curren t growth rate, i n f l a t i o n and h i s t o r i c a l l y l o w 
interest rates, t h e governmen t w o u l d need t o reduce i t s p r im a r y d e f i c i t to t h e sustainable l e v e l o f 0.38

Croatia's internal public debt consists o f frozen foreign exchange deposits 
(FFEDs), bonds for restructuring (so-called B i g Bonds), bonds for banks' 
rehabilitation (BRA bonds), Treasury Bills, bonds syndicated through 
domestic banks (G-Bonds), Croatian I n s t i t u t e o f Health Insurance Bonds and 
other short-term debt. A t end 2003 intemal direct public debt was HRK 33.4 
b i l l ion or 17.4 percent o f GDP (a 0.5 p.p o f GDP increase over 2002). When 
outstanding government guarantees to domestic banks and arrears are added, 
total domestic public debt sums up to HRK 45.2 b i l l i o n (23.5 percent o f 
GDP). 
Extemal public debt o f Croatia consists o f London and Paris Club 
obligations, credits from IFIs, and increasing share o f debt to commercial 
banks and sovereign bonds. After attaining the lowest investment cred i t 
rating in 1997, the Govemment o f Croatia issued a se r ies o f bonds and took 
several syndicated loans. Total direct extemal public debt o f Croatia 
amounted to HRK 45.4 b i l l i o n or 25.4 percent o f GDP at end 2002 and 
increased to HRK 51.5 b i l l i o n or 26.8 percent o f GDP in 2003. Including 
the outstanding govemment guarantees, total extemal public debt adds into 
HRK 59.7 b i l l i o n (31.1 percent o f GDP).

Large levels of public expenditure in the 1990s and in the early 2000 have been the ma in cause 
of rising and high fiscal deficits and, consequently, rising public debt. T h e governmen t t o o k steps since 

2000 t o repay accumu la ted arrears, t o im p l em e n t expend i ture cuts, and t o under take s truc tura l r e f o rm s

be tween 1999 and 2002 f i o m ove r 6 percen t o f GDP t o a round 3 percen t o f GDP. T h i s i s in sharp 
contrast with average p r im a r y d e f i c i t s o f less than 1 pe rcen t during 1995-98 and a surp lus o f o v e r 2 
percen t o f GDP in 1994. 

1995 debt data i s corrected for London and Paris Club debt recognized in 1996. 
FFEDs originate f rom the r igh t o f t h e former Yugoslav c i t izens to h o l d foreign currency accounts in domestic 
banks, which re-deposited t h i s foreign currency in t h e National Bank o f Yugoslavia (NBJ) in r e t u r n for domestic 
currency. At the time o f the break-up o f former Yugoslavia, Croatian banks held more than HRK 17.75 b i l l in the 
NBJ, which subsequently retained a l l o f these funds. T h e government decided to accept these commercial banks 
assets as public debt as they represented t h e l i f e t im e savings o f a sizeable por t ion o f t h e population. 
' The o f f ic ia l recognition o f that debt was done after reaching an agreement w i t h the Paris Club in 1995 and with the 
London Club in 1996. T h e basic formula for the allocation o f former federa l liabilities was devised b y the IMF in 
order to distribute the former Yugoslavia's so-called "non-allocated" debt to t h e Paris Club. Croatia acknowledged 
28.49 percen t o f the debts owed or guaranteed by the former Yugoslavia not attributable to any successor republic. 
Under t h e agreement w i th t h e London Club creditors, Croatia assumed 29.5 percent o f Refinancing Loans under t h e 
n e t foreign assets and 19.7 percen t o f the Trade and Deposit Fac i l i ty Agreement. 
In July 1996, t h i s debt was 
exchanged for Croatian Series A and B Bonds, and b y t h i s Croatia normalized relations w i t h a l l i t s foreign creditors.

I n addition to the f inanc ing of budget deficits, public debt has also grown to f inance the

Croatia's public debt as well as its trend compare unfavorably with accession and EU

Un t i l now, f inanc ing of 
these 
large deficits has been facilitated by 
relatively easy access to international 
capital markets, which allowed issuing 
debt at low country risk spreads, and by 
significant privatization receipts. In fact,

Issues and Diagnosis 

The P r ima ry Balance and Deb t Sustainability 

12. 

Pro-cyclical fiscal policy during the 1990s seriously undermined f isca l sustainability, 
underpinned by the Russian and Kosovo crises, both of which resulted in an economic downturn. 

F isca l deficits averagmg 2.3 percent o f GDP f r om 1995 to 1998 turned t o 6 percent o f GDP in the per iod 
thereafter. The f isca l po l icy stance over the second h a l f o f the 1990s has n o t been sustainable, as evident 
f r om fast debt growth. W h i l e f rom 2000 there has been a change in the trend, such change i s no t yet 
sufficient 
to restore inter-temporal solvency. In the long run the government must accumulate rea l debt 
(as a share o f GDP) at a rate lowe r than the rea l rate o f interest in order t o be able to amortize at least 
some sma l l frac t ion o f i t s debt. T h e f isca l sustainability exercise suggests that the sustainable level for 
the primary balance (a balance requ ired to ma in ta in a financiable leve l o f debt based o n assumptions 
regarding growth, in f la t ion and the pub l ic demand fo r money) over the med ium term' i s 0.38 percent of 
GDP. T h i s comes f rom a combined estimated rea l debt service cost o f 0.47 percent o f GDP ( th is i s n e t o f 
growth's effect on the stock o f debt), plus seignorage revenue o f 0.85 percent o f GDP." With the cu r ren t 
rea l g row th rate that Croatia achieves, t h e government w i l l have t o find add i t iona l savings o f at least 3 
percentage po in ts o f GDP t o con tro l the debt leve l . I f the government faces a higher premium on i t s 
nom ina l debt, a primary su rp lus w i l l be needed to keep the leve l o f debt stable. Once the rea l interest rate 
exceeds the rea l g row th rate, debt can accumulate v e r y rap id ly . 

The long-run in f la t ion i s estimated at 3 percent, long - run r e a l g r ow t h rate at 4.5 percent, w o r l d rea l interest rate at 
5.5, base money at 14.7 percent o f GDP and short-term interest rate at 3. 
lo T h e previous analysis has already shown that money demand i s so elastic in Croa t ia that t h e max ima l seignorage 
the Government cou ld raise i s n o t much higher: seignorage i s maximized, by a 20 percent i n f l a t i o n rate, at jus t 1.7 
percent o f GDP. T h i s means that even in a h i g h i n f l a t i o n environment the primary f isca l surplus cou ld b e n o lowe r 
than -1.2 percent o f GDP.

Croatia, the government may want also to revisit the currency weightings in its external debt. In

coun t ing o f guaranteed debt (at some 8 percent o f GDP) in pub l ic debt data received f r om the Croatian 
Na t iona l Bank. 

Domestic Deb t Ma rke t 

24. 

The Croat ian government securities market witnessed substantial development since 2000. As 
a result, it now fares reasonably well vis Ci vis the regional leading group. W h i l e enhancement o f the 

public debt management i s a responsibility o f t h e MoF , further development o f the pub l ic debt market 
w i l l require e f for ts by various parties. In addition, such e f for ts w i l l need to be coordinated t o ensure the ir 
effectiveness. A proper mechanism fo r coordination i s needed. In particular, strong leadership by the 
MoF and the CNB w i l l b e indispensable to ensure effective coordination. The domestic investor base 
on ly recen t ly started developing and diversifying, and the primary marke t needs t o b e be t te r organized. 
The i s s u e calendar i s no t ye t established except for the T-bills. The secondary market i s also fragmented 
due to a few factors, inc lud ing a need t o con tro l a f f i l ia ted pa r ty transactions in the small and 
conglomerated f inanc ia l sector, the res tr ic t ion on fore ign investment in the domestic bonds t o con tro l the 
money supply, and the dual currency denomination. 

The demand and investor base need to be developed further. Wh i le the launch o f the second 

25. 
p i l la r pension funds i s giving impetus to the development o f the domestic investor base, the domestic 
demand i s s t i l l limited. Further, a high degree o f currency substitution leads to strong investor preference 
for Euro- l inked govemment securities. W h i l e banks rema in to be an impor tan t group o f investors, they 
are ra is ing funds fo r domestic bond investment f rom overseas sources. M o r e targeted issuance and 
promo t iona l campaign may be needed. Re ta i l investors might be especially attracted to short-dated 
government securities, should infrastructure for easy access and safe custody be established. 

The domestic debt market needs to be broadened with supply of new maturities. The vo lume o f 

26. 
domestic bonds outstanding i s a small po r t ion o f the to ta l pub l ic debt. W h i l e T-bills are issued week ly in 
three maturities (3, 6 and 12 months), there are on ly seven truly marketable T-bonds issued by the 
government and i t s agencies, wh ich have maturities o f 3 ,5 ,7 and 10 years. M id - te rm maturities (i.e., 2 to 
4 years) are scarce where HRK (instead o f Euro-denominated) T-bonds cou ld be issued. In particular, 
with the recent appreciation o f EUR and HRK, Croatia’s USD-denominated ex tema l debt can be 
refinanced in the domestic market with significant cap i ta l gains. Domestic absorption capacity by 
ins t i tu t iona l investors wou ld be sizable enough to support increased domestic bo r row ing in com ing years. 

The primary market needs to be better organized and made more competitive. W h i l e T-bills are 

27. 
auctioned weekly, T-bonds are issued with n o f ixed calendar, and those have b e e n underwr i t ten by 
several lead ing banks based on requests fo r proposals. The pa r t ic ipa t ion in the T-bill auctions i s open to 
anyone, inc lud ing re ta i l investors w i thou t eligibility t o ensure p romp t settlement o f w inn ing bids. In 
response t o the emergence o f new ly b red ins t i tu t iona l investors, the p r ima ry market system wou ld warrant 
a substantial reconfiguration. Particularly, transparency in the p r ima ry market needs t o b e s ign i f ican t ly 
improved by regular auctions, elaboration and early pub l ica t ion o f t h e MoF ’s annual issuance calendars. 
Starting with T-bill auctions, the issuance system cou ld be gradua l ly automated. W i t h be t te r organization 
and enhanced competition in t h e p r ima ry market, the y i e l d i s expected t o go down substantially.

Fragmentation in the secondary market needs to be carefully considered in organizing the 

primary and the secondary market. T h e small, concentrated and cong lomera ted f i n a n c i a l sector ca l ls f o r 
c o n t r o l o f a f f i l i a t e d p a r t y transactions. T h e dua l currency denom ina t ion in HRK and EUR also fragments 
the ma rke t and y i e l d curve. M o s t domes t ic T-bonds are cu r ren t ly denom ina ted in EUR w h i l e T-bills are 
in HRK. M o r e HRK -denom ina ted T-bonds m a y b e in t roduced soon. T h e r e s t r i c t i o n o n fo re ign 
inves tmen t in the domes t ic bonds t o c o n t r o l the m o n e y supply d is tor ts y i e l d s o n C roa t ian Eurobonds and 
EUR -denom ina ted domestic bonds. A l l these fac tors need t o b e cons idered c a r e f u l l y in o rgan iz ing the 
p r im a r y and the secondary markets.

29 . 

The rep0 market exists but needs to be further developed, while the swap market needs to be 

investigated. A standardized master agreement cove r ing b o t h banks and non -bank f i n a n c i a l ins t i tu t ions 
does n o t exist, limiting the ma rke t t o a sma l l numbe r o f banks. I t a lso leaves l e g a l unce r ta in ty in the 
transactions. Depth and e f f i c i e n c y o f the currency and in teres t ra te swap ma rke t need t o b e inves t iga ted . 

Transparency of 

the secondary market needs to be improved.

T h e f o l l o w i n g issues were i d e n t i f i e d as k e y challenges by par t ic ipan ts : 

Education - A l l par t ic ipan ts h i g h l i g h t e d educa t ion r e f o rm as the most im p o r t a n t r e f o rm f o r Croatia. 
T h e curren t educa t ion system a t a l l leve ls i s inadequate and in n e e d o f r e f o rm . I t was also f e l t tha t the

There i s a l a c k o f f o rm a l and i n f o rm a l educa t ion in “democra t ic culture.” Such a n i n i t i a t i v e would 
also h e l p the governmen t ca r ry o u t less popu la r re forms , as the p u b l i c would be aware tha t they have 
t o undergo a p e r i o d o f hardship f o r the greater g o o d o f a l l in the fu ture . Pa r t ic ipan ts a lso f e l t tha t the 
C roa t ian soc ie ty i s c losed t o n e w ideas. 
Public Administration and Judiciary - Par t ic ipan ts expressed a n acute l a c k o f con f idence in t h e 
judiciary system and comp la ined abou t a n o n - f u n c t i o n i n g public administration (unclear regulations, 
l a c k o f educa t ion o f c i v i l servants, i n e f f i c i e n t im p l em e n t a t i o n o f laws). T h e y f e l t the b igges t

economy, i n d i c a t i n g tha t m a n y o f the reg is tered unemp loyed are ac t ive in the g ray economy . Youth 
organ iza t ions expressed the i r concern abou t the m a r g i n a l i z a t i o n o f y o u n g peop le (1 5-30 years o f age) 
in society, due t o l im i t e d emp loymen t oppo r tun i t ies (new emp loyees a lways n e e d t o have x numbe r

depression and apathy.

Areas o f Special State Concern, so m u c h so tha t h o u s i n g shortages we re f lagged as one o f the m a i n 
p rob lems in the Knin area. Decentralization was discussed in some de ta i l . T h e b igges t concern was

WBI Activities in Croatia 

FY05 - FYO8 

I n support of 
the Bank Group’s assistance strategy for Croatia, W B I programs would 
contribute to capacity enhancement in the areas of public sector and governance, private 
sector development, and social sustainability. 

Public sector and governance: WB I wou ld o f fer two reg iona l programs, one on 
Intergovernmental F isca l Relations and Loca l F inanc ia l Management fo r E C A countries and the 
other (subject to donor funding) o n Lega l and Judicial Re fo rm T ra in ing fo r the Judiciary in 
Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia. The objective o f the Intergovernmental F isca l Relations Program 
wou ld be to expand the capacity o f central and subnational governments and key stakeholders for 
undertaking intergovernmental f isca l and urban management re forms and t o p rov ide support 
towards sub-national f isca l and po l i t ica l ins t i tu t iona l development. I t wou ld focus o n various 
issues in f isca l decentralization reforms, intergovernmental f isca l design, and loca l financial 
management. The planned Lega l and Judicial Re fo rm Training, aimed at c i v i l society and 
executive authorities as well as the jud ic iary , wou ld a im to build capacity f o r a more efficient, 
cost-effective accessible, and transparent sys tem o f justice.

challenges are re la ted and have t o d o with the a b i l i t y o f the economy to compe te o n in te rna t iona l 
markets. C roa t ian companies are less compe t i t ive than enterprises o f n e i g h b o r i n g c o u n t i e s tha t 
entered the EU o n M a y 2004, and m u c h less compe t i t ive t h a n enterprises in o ther EU c o u n t i e s . 
With high wages and an aw kw a r d p r o d u c t i o n structure, C roa t ia faces greater challenges. To h e l p 
C roa t ia mee t these challenges and take advantage o f the oppo r tun i t ies t h a t p rospec t ive EU

Box 1. Balkan Infrastructure Development Facility 
A poor and unreliable infrastructure continues to discourage pr i \ ate investors and hinder economic growth in the Balkan 
region. I n turn, slower economic growth reduces the availability o f government funds to improve infrastructure. To 
break this cycle, IFC i s establishing the Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility i n cooperation with USAID and 
European donors. The facility uill help public sector en t i t ies IR the Southern Europe region (including Croatia) attract 
private sector investments in infrastructure, focusing on the energy, transportation. and water and sanitation sectors. T h e 
facility re f lec ts the World Bank Group strategy to broaden engagement in these sectors to ensure e f f ic ien t , affordable, 
and sustainable delivery o f infrastructure services. The facility w i l l help identify, develop, structure, and reach financial 
closure on infrastructure projects, so that committed public sector entities can engage more effectively with the private 
sector and attract investments critical t o the region's economic development. IFC w i l l launch the Facility in FY05.

T h e e f f ic ien t p rov is ion o f energy services i s important fo r p romo t ing g row th and enhancing 
Croatia’s ab i l i ty to compete e f fec t ive ly within the EU. 
Croatia has sought to achieve: 
attracting s ign i f ican t investment resources fo r the modernization o f the energy infrastructure; and 
(ii) creating a market based energy sector, with po l ic ies and regu la tory framework compatible with 
those in the European Un ion . A series o f energy laws we re enacted in 2001 t o launch such 
reforms. W h i l e their implementation in the o i l and gas sector has been generally satisfactory, 
progress in the power sector has been slower. T h e ma in power u t i l i t y (HEP), a state-owned public 
enterprise that carries out the activities o f generation, transmission and d is tr ibu t ion o f e lec tr ic i ty as 
w e l l as operation o f the na t iona l power, controls 95 percent o f the powe r market in Croatia. 
Accord ing to the Athens Memorandum o f Understanding, South-East Europe countries, inc lud ing 
Croatia, have agreed to create by 2005 an open power market in the region. T h i s w i l l ca l l fo r the 
restructuring o f HEP (a high-case trigger fo r this j o i n t W o r l d BanM IFC CAS) by the unbundling 
o f generation, transmission, and distribution, fo l lowed by establishment o f independent operators 
and market liberalization. There may be scope fo r I F C engagement in the powe r sector once HEP 
restructuring i s advanced.

eventually to Austrian and German o i l-p ipe l ine networks. USTDA has f inanced a feas ib i l i ty study

Cross Border Integration-Regional Links 

Croatia’s economy i s re la t ive ly large by reg iona l standards, accounting fo r rough ly h a l f o f the 
GDP o f the western Balkans. However, with GDP o f about US$30 b i l l ion , Croatia i s s t i l l a small 
market. T h e pr iva te sector may p lay an impor tan t ro le in the economic development and cross- 
border integration o f Croatia in the region. During 1993-2001, Croa t ian enterprises inves ted 
around U S $ l 5 0 m i l l i o n o r 27 percent o f to ta l direct investments abroad in Bosn ia and 
Herzegovina, accounting fo r around 30 percent o f to ta l FDI in this country. 
I F C strategy i s to 
support dynamic companies in Croatia that seek to extend across borders. 
Imp lemen t ing this 
strategy, I FC has invested in a paper manufacturing fac i l i ty and in a lead ing pharmaceutical 
company. W h i l e the paper company has acquired a company in ne ighbor ing Slovenia, creating 
the largest cardboard and packaging materials maker in southeastern Europe, the pharmaceutical 
company i s loo lung for opportunities to expand i t s operation in ne ighbor ing countries. Also,
