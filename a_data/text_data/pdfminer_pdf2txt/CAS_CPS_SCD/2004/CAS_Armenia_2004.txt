Executive Summary 

1. 

Context. A rm e n i a i s a small, land locked coun t ry with few na tu ra l resources in a h i s to r ica l ly 
vo la t i le pa r t o f the wo r ld . The coun t ry experienced a m a j o r economic con t rac t ion at the end o f the 
1980s when the effects o f a massive earthquake were amp l i f ied by the b reak up o f the Soviet U n i o n 
and the costs o f the c o n f l i c t with Aze rba i jan over Nagorno-Karabagh. Over the last ten years, the 
Government has shown a strong track reco rd o n economic management and reform, and has made 
good use o f the high l e v e l s o f o f f i c i a l donor support i t has received. A rmen ia had the highest IDA 
performance reco rd in the E C A reg ion in 2003. 

.. 

11. 

Economic Performance. The economy has recovered well f r om the post-1988 collapse, with 
economic g r ow t h reach ing 14% in 2003. At the beginning o f the recovery, g r ow t h was concentrated 
in a na r row se t o f industries, but, since 2000, the base has begun to broaden. A l t h o u g h pove r t y 
remains widespread, i t has been f a l l i n g since the late 1990s. Ex t reme pove r t y has fa l len mo re than 
ove ra l l poverty, but the rate o f imp rovemen t in b o t h measures has lagged behind economic g row th . 
M o s t o f the reductions in p o v e r t y have been seen in Yerevan, with p o v e r t y in other u rban areas 
f a l l i n g l e s s rap id ly , and in r u r a l areas rema in ing stagnant. 

... 111. 

Areas that require further attention. Desp i te this substantial progress, the re are some key 
i s s u e s that need to b e addressed i f strong g r ow t h i s to continue, and p o v e r t y reduc t ion i s to accelerate. 
The c l ima te fo r p r i v a t e sector development needs t o improve fu r the r . While A rmen ia has one 
o f the mos t l i b e r a l business environments in the FSU, the p u b l i c sector needs t o become m o r e 
o f an asset -- rather than an administrative and f inanc ia l cost -- to t h e p r iva te sector. 
A la rge r share of 
the popu la t ion needs to benefit f rom economic g row th . With strong 
economic g r ow t h expected to continue, mo re a t ten t ion i s needed t o increasing jobs, s t imu la t - 
ing the r u r a l economy, and im p r o v i n g the social p ro tec t ion systems. 
The en t i re popu la t ion needs better access t o basic services. After independence basic 
services, i n c l u d i n g education and healthcare, deteriorated sharply, and the Government needs 
to p e r s i s t in i t s e f fo r ts t o imp rove their qua l i t y and e f f ic iency . 

iv . 
Government Program. 
In October 2003, the Government published an ambitious yet 
realistic Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper, w h i c h lays ou t i t s p l a n f o r reduc ing p o v e r t y and 
inequality, and furthering human development. The po l ic ies and actions proposed can be grouped 
i n t o five categories: (i) p r om o t i n g sustainable economic g r ow t h th rough macro-economic s tab i l i ty 
and p r iva te sector development; (ii) enhancing human development and im p r o v i n g social safety ne ts ; 
(iii) imp lemen t ing p ruden t f isca l policies; (iv) im p r o v i n g p u b l i c infrastructure; and (v) im p r o v i n g 
core pub l ic sector functions. 

v. 
IDA Strategy and Results. F r om the range o f in te rven t ions proposed in the PRSP, the C A S 
focuses o n th ree areas w h i c h bes t fit the B a n k Group’s comparative advantage and complement the 
activities o f other donors. In each area, the C A S takes as i t s starting p o i n t long - te rm coun t ry goals, 
and o n that basis defines specific results that can be achieved ove r the F Y 0 5 - 0 8 C A S pe r iod : 
P romo te p r i v a t e sector led economic g row th . A c h i e v i n g this goa l w i l l requ i re be t te r p u b l i c

WORLD BANK COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR 
THE REPUBLIC OF ARMEN IA 

1. 

Introduct ion 

1. 
A rmen ia i s located in the Caucasus Region, ne ighbo r ing Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Tu r - 
key . With a GNP per capita o f US$910 in 2003, A rmen ia ranks in the lowe r m idd le - income group o f 
countries. Em i g r a t i o n and dec l in ing f e r t i l i t y has reduced i t s population, w h i c h was 3.8 m i l l i o n t e n 
years ago, to about 3.1 m i l l i o n today. Because A rmen ia i s small, land locked and mountainous, w i t h 
few na tu ra l resources, i t faces economic disadvantages compared w i t h m a n y o f i t s neighbors. These 
disadvantages have, however, been o f f -se t to some extent by the country’s high l e v e l s o f human 
capital, an active diaspora, and high l e v e l s o f remittances and external assistance (wh ich averaged 
11% o f GDP ove r the last five years). A rm e n i a i s vulnerable to a wide range o f external shocks 
a r is ing f r om i t s loca t ion in a h is to r i ca l ly vo la t i le geo -po l i t ica l environment, and i t s susceptibility t o 
na tu ra l disasters, such as earthquakes, droughts, frosts, hailstorms, and floods. 

2. 
A rmen ia achieved independence f r om the Soviet U n i o n in 1991, and since then the economy 
has changed p ro found l y . H e a v y industry collapsed as the Soviet U n i o n b roke up, and i s g radua l ly 
being replaced by services, light industry, and construction. As this economic t rans fo rma t ion has 
taken hold, GDP g r ow t h has accelerated f r om 3.3% in 1999 to 13.9% in 2003. The Government’s 
fo rce fu l s teps to create a mo re favorable bus iness environment and imp rove p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions he lped 
accelerate g r ow t h rates. Membership o f in te rna t iona l bodies such as the WTO and the C o u n c i l o f 
Eu rope have added impetus t o ma in ta in ing and deepening reforms. B a r r i n g any des tab i l iz ing 
economic shock, the prospects f o r GDP and export g r ow t h rema in favorable. 

3. 
The m a j o r challenge f o r the Government during th is CAS p e r i o d w i l l b e t o create the cond i - 
t ions that w i l l a l l ow g r ow t h t o bene f i t a m u c h larger share o f the A rm e n i a popu la t ion . While o ve ra l l 
p o v e r t y f e l l f r om 56% o f the popu la t ion in 1998/99 to 49% in 2002, and extreme pove r t y f r om 26% 
t o 17%, a mo re r a p i d imp rovemen t might have been expected f r om the r a p i d GDP g row th . The 2003 
PRSP emphasizes the Government’s comm i tmen t to equitable g r ow t h and sustained pove r t y reduc - 
t i o n across the who le country. When the W o r l d Bank ’s Execu t ive B o a r d discussed the PRSP, and 
associated Joint S t a f f Assessment, in December 2003, i t concluded that the PRSP p rov ides a sound 
basis f o r IDA concessional assistance. Th is C A S i s acco rd ing ly based o n the PRSP’s p r io r i t ies . 

4. 
A rmen ia has had a re la t ive ly stable p o l i t i c a l s i tua t ion over the past few years, with strong 
support fo r re fo rms f r om b o t h the executive and leg is la t ive branches. P res iden t ia l and leg is la t ive 
elections in early 2003 resu l ted in re -e lec t ion o f President Kocha r ian and coa l i t ion w i t h i n Parliament, 
w h i c h continues to support the PRSP and med ium - te rm agenda. Howeve r , the electoral process i t s e l f 
was c r i t ic ized at the time, and oppos i t ion parties have since stepped up demands f o r a na t ionw ide 
referendum o f confidence, w h i c h has been rejected by the Parliament. While the ove ra l l environment 
i s s t i l l supportive, there w i l l c lea r ly be a heightened need f o r consensus building t o support the r e f o rm 
p rog ram in the years ahead.

5 . 
Armenia’s t rans fo rma t ion f r om a cen t ra l ly p lanned Soviet system t o a successful ma rke t 
economy has h a d three m a j o r phases. 

6. 
The first phase, las t ing fo r the f i r s t tw o years after Armenia’s 1991 declaration o f independ- 
ence, was ma rked by a con t rac t ion in GDP o f 50%. While GDP f e l l in a l l FSU economies after the 
break-up o f the Soviet Un ion , the situation in A rmen ia was pa r t icu la r ly severe, exacerbated by a 
heavy dependence o n uncompe t i t ive Soviet heavy industry, by the after-effects o f the 1988 
earthquake, and by the direct and ind i rec t costs o f the con f l ic t over Nagorno-Karabagh. The full 
impac t o f this economic contraction was alleviated to some degree by f a rm p r iva t iza t ion , w h i c h took 
place at this time, and a l lowed subsistence agriculture t o act as a safety net, absorbing m a n y o f the 
displaced workers. F a rm ou tpu t rose to over 50% o f a sharply reduced GD P by 1993.

The second phase o f the transformation to a ma rke t economy began in 1994, and was ma rked 
by a successful s tab i l iza t ion and structural r e f o rm program. The p rog ram focused i n i t i a l l y o n f is ca l 
and monetary po l ic ies designed to deal with hype r - in f la t ion (w h i c h reached 5000% in 1994), and 
uncon t ro l led f i sca l spending (the budget de f ic i t reached 56% o f GDP in 1993). S tab i l iza t ion was 
accompanied by l ibe ra l iza t ion o f trade and prices, p r iva t iza t ion o f sma l l and medium en te rp r ises , and 
the creation o f the basic lega l and administrative f ramewo rk f o r a ma rke t economy. These re fo rms -- 
and other pos i t ive factors such as the ceasefire ove r Nago rno -Ka rabagh -- fostered sustained 
economic expansion (see Table 1). G r ow t h averaged 5 . 5% in 1994-2000, and the compos i t ion o f 
GDP changed considerably, with agriculture dec l in ing aga in in re la t ive te rm s , and the cons t ruc t ion 
and trade sectors g r ow i n g rap id ly .

Mac roeconom ic management remains sound. F isca l balances continue t o b e sustainable, w i t h 
a budget d e f i c i t o f 1.5% o f GDP in 2003 (be low the target o f 2.2%, in pa r t because o f undermns o n 
p ro jec ted expenditures). Nonetheless, government revenues rema in l o w by CIS standards, amoun t ing 
t o l e s s than 15% o f GDP. The Government i s comm i t ted to im p r o v i n g tax collection, and re fo rms 
in t roduced at the end o f 2003 seem to be hav ing an impact, with tax revenue in the f i r s t t h r e e mon ths 
o f 2004 18% higher than in the same p e r i o d in 2003. 

10. 
The p r inc ipa l short-term macroeconomic concern has been in f la t ion , w h i c h rose to a re la t ive ly 
high 8.6 percent by the end o f 2003. However, the m a i n cause was a sudden increase in the prices o f 
impo r ted wheat f lou r and cereals, with mone ta ry p o l i c y p l a y i n g at mos t a m i n o r ro le . By April 2004, 
the 12-month rate o f i n f l a t i o n had fa l len to 7.8 percent, and the A rmen ian D r a m rema ined b road l y 
stable.

The Government has sharply reduced the once burdensome quasi-fiscal de f ic i t . M o s t o f th is

an energy sector de f ic i t o f 2% o f GDP in 2000 i n t o a surplus now . In add i t ion the water supply and

acquired equ i ty in several ma jo r state-owned enterprises in A rmen ia in exchange fo r US $ 9 4 m i l l i o n 
o f government debt. This, in add i t ion to the in-kind repayment o f the US$12 m i l l i o n outstanding t o 
Turkmenistan, helped t o eliminate the mos t expensive pa r t o f Armenia’s external debt burden, and 
thereby im p r o v e d the country’s external debt indicators. By the end o f 2003, government and 
government-guaranteed external debt was 39% o f GDP, w i t h about 80% f r om mu l t i la te ra l conces-

The hea l th o f the A rmen ian popu la t ion deteriorated after the economic collapse, but since 
2000 the re have been ind ica t ions that conditions are starting t o imp rove . While data problems ma ke 
de f in i te conclusions d i f f i c u l t , Government figures ind ica te that unde r - f ive m o r t a l i t y f e l l f r om 25 pe r 
1,000 l i v e births t o 19 pe r 100,000 between 2001 and 2003.6 These trends mask a s ign i f ican t d i f f e r - 
ence between r u r a l and u rban areas, with r u r a l in fan t and c h i l d m o r t a l i t y rates exceeding u rban rates 
by 47 percent and 22 percent, respectively, during the 1990s. The Government has embarked o n a 
r e f o rm p rog ram t o increase p u b l i c expenditure o n healthcare, imp rove i t s targeting, and reduce excess 
hosp i ta l capacity.

Access t o basic education i s good, with a n e t en ro l lmen t rate o f 92% in 2001. In contrast, t h e 
n e t en ro l lmen t ra te in secondary schools i s o n l y 61%’ and even l ow e r f o r the poorest qu in t i le (52%). 
B o y s are pa r t icu la r ly l i k e l y to d rop out because o f problems b o t h o f supply (poor qua l i t y o f teaching), 
and demand ( l ow expectations o f jobs aAer comp le t ing education). The Government i s w o r k i n g t o 
imp rove the q u a l i t y o f education, and has begun to make expenditure m o r e efficient, f o r example by 
consolidating unde ru t i l ized schools to imp rove their effectiveness. O v e r a l l pub l ic expenditures o n 
education are also rising (by 45% between 1997 and 2001), but they are s t i l l l o w by FSU standards. 
High qua l i t y textbooks are n o w available t o a l l at a reasonable cost, and 40% o f schools n o w have 
some managerial and f inanc ia l autonomy. 

3.2 Millennium Development Goals 

27. 
A rmen ia has already met the gender MDG, and i s likely to meet the pove r t y and education 
goals, and poss ib l y also the environment goa l (see Table 7 below). The hea l th goals, however, appear 
l e s s l i k e l y to be met by the target year o f 2015, with c h i l d m o r t a l i t y s t i l l m o r e than tw i c e the goal, TB 
rates increasing, and ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y rema in ing a serious p rob lem . IDA i s con t inu ing to support 
Armenia’s e f fo r ts t o meet and exceed the MDGs, w i t h pa r t icu la r emphasis, b o t h in the current 
p o r t f o l i o and in the proposed PRSCs, o n the hea l th goals. In addition, IDA i s con t inu ing t o h e l p 
finance improvements throughout A rmen ia in drinking wa te r and sanitation systems, as we l l as in 
na tu ra l resource management, r u r a l development, and energy re fo rm . 

28. 
A recent exercise t o assess the costs o f mee t ing the MDGs estimated that A rm e n i a w o u l d need 
about US$25 m i l l i o n per year in add i t ion to the cu r ren t ly proposed a l loca t ion fo r the four-year p e r i o d 
2005-08 to cover the costs o f p u b l i c expenditures that w o u l d be requ i red t o mee t the MDGs. This 
assumes that A rmen ia w o u l d receive U S 3 5 m i l l i o n annua l ly f r om p r iva te foundations and o the r

0 The best r e s u l t s were achieved when IDA was able to exp lo i t the syne rg ies between w e l l - 
sequenced ana ly t ica l w o r k and lend ing (both investment and adjustment), and when i t was 
able t o leverage t r u s t funds and other donors’ support. This C A S thus pays close attention to 
the sequencing o f in i t ia t ives , and ensuring that support fo r r e f o rm w i l l be based o n good 
ana ly t ica l underpinnings. 
A strong, high ca l ibe r mu l t i -sec to r team in the Yerevan Coun t ry O f f i c e was impo r tan t in 
designing appropriate interventions, and ma in ta in ing a high l e v e l o f dialogue with senior 
o f f ic ia ls . M o v i n g p o r t f o l i o management and some task management responsibilities to the 
Coun t ry O f f i c e also he lped imp rove p o r t f o l i o performance. B o t h trends w i l l continue under 
this CAS . 
The outcome indicators f o r the FY 0 2 - 0 4 C A S should have b e e n linked mo re c lea r ly t o IDA 
interventions in order t o fac i l i ta te evaluation o f C A S performance. This C A S consequently 
l i n k s a l l targets t o the associated interventions, and indicators in the r e s u l t s ma t r ix (Annex 1) 
w i l l be used as a management t o o l throughout C A S implementation. 
The FY 0 2 - 0 4 C A S was n o t rea l is t ic enough about s ta f f ava i lab i l i t y and p rog ramm ing . 
Though the to ta l number o f ac t iv i t ies and lending vo lume were de l ive red r o u g h l y as planned, 
there was some slippage due to lack o f t im e l y ava i lab i l i t y o f key staff. B a n k management w i l l

The C A S consultation process was extensive, and la rge ly co inc ided with the even mo re

to continue consultations throughout PRSP implementation, and IDA w i l l participate in that

4.2 OED S Country Assistance &ahation

The W o r l d Bank’s Operations E va lua t ion Department prepared an independent assessment o f 
the r o l e o f W o r l d B a n k Group’s assistance to A rmen ia between 1993 and 2002.7 The repo r t found 
that the substantial l e v e l s o f assistance was w e l l used: 86% o f the p ro jec ts rev iewed had satisfactory 
outcomes, with high relevance, substantial ins t i tu t iona l development impac t and excellent linkages 
between ana ly t ica l w o r k and lending, as w e l l as m u t u a l l y supportive inves tmen t and adjustment 
operations. OED found that IDA lending should have focused earlier and mo re in tens ive ly o n 
im p r o v i n g the bus iness c l ima te and p u b l i c sector management. The eva lua t ion also concluded that 
A rmen ia needed to strengthen i t s a i d coo rd ina t ion capacity. The repo r t recommended: (a) p repa r ing a 
strategy fo r an eventual t rans i t ion t o IBRD lending; (b) con t inu ing t o focus o n im p r o v i n g the

31. 
The Bank’s assistance over the FY 0 2 - 0 4 C A S p e r i o d has, in active cooperation with other 
development partners, h a d a tangible impac t o n the g round in a number o f areas. A few examples 
are: 
0 The business environment. The support p rov ided th rough Structural Ad jus tmen t Credits 
(SACS) IV and V, as w e l l as other instruments, he lped produce a measurable imp rovemen t in 
the bus iness environment. F o r example, the number o f steps necessary to register an 
en te rp r ise has been cu t by one third, and Government inspections have b e e n reduced by half, 
s ign i f ican t ly im p r o v i n g the bus iness environment. Businesses’ perceptions o f a l l f i e l d s o f

IDA also helped increase the e f f ic ienc y o f the powe r u t i l i t i e s w i t h the result that almost the 
entire popu la t ion n o w has uninterrupted e lec t r ic i ty supply, and t a r i f f co l lec t ion i s close to 
100%. W i t h support from IDA , drinking water services in Yerevan have imp roved ma rked ly . 
In 2001, o n l y 10% o f the city’s popu la t ion had water f o r 12 hours per day, whereas by M a r c h 
2004, h a l f o f the popu la t ion had 2 4 hou r service. 
Governance. C i v i l service r e f o rm has begun under a new law, w h i c h IDA advised on. In 
addition, IDA has helped bring government and c i v i l society organizations d ra f t an A n t i - 
Co r rup t ion Strategy, w h i c h was adopted and launched by the President in January 2004. 
Rural development. IDA has assisted in rehab i l i ta t ing 4,000 km o f i r r i g a t i o n canals, w h i c h 
have increased the p r o d u c t i v i t y o f some 140,000 hectares o f ag r icu l tu ra l land, 74% o f a l l

Education and health. W i t h IDA assistance, t h e Government has taken steps to ma ke the 
healthcare mo re responsive to the needs o f the poo r .

5. Government Program 

32. 
In October 2003 the Government pub l ished i t s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP), 
w h i c h promotes the goals of: (i) reduc ing poverty; (ii) lowe r ing inequality; and (iii) im p r o v i n g human 
development.* The W o r l d B a n k - IM F Jo in t S ta f f Assessment (JSA) o f the PRSP concluded that the 
strategy was a s ign i f ican t achievement in the Government’s e f fo r t to foster g r ow t h and reduce 
poverty, and endorsed i t s analysis and recommendations.’ The JSA concluded that the PRSP was 
prepared th rough a b road pa r t ic ipa to ry process, was based o n a comprehensive analysis o f poverty, 
contained a sound diagnosis o f needed short- and long - te rm re fo rms and investments, and used 
rea l is t ic cos t ing and f inanc ing assumptions. The JSA recommended add i t iona l w o r k o n m o n i t o r i n g 
and evaluation, further p r i o r i t i z a t i o n o f proposed interventions, and close in teg ra t ion o f the PRSP 
w i t h the M e d i um -T e rm Expenditure F ramewo rk and the annual budgets. 

33. 
The PRSP sees g r ow t h and p o v e r t y reduc t ion com ing p r im a r i l y f r om a mo re dynam ic and 
compe t i t ive p r iva te sector, w i t h the Government’s r o l e focus ing o n p r om o t i n g a better business 
climate, im p r o v i n g the l e v e l and e f f ic ienc y o f social sector expenditures, and reduc ing waste and 
corruption. The PRSP also iden t i f ies infrastructure investments ( inc lud ing in health) as h a v i n g an 
especially high return. 

34. 
The po l ic ies and actions proposed in the PRSP can be grouped i n t o five categories: (i) p romo t - 
ing sustainable economic g r ow t h th rough macroeconomic s tab i l i t y and p r iva te sector development; 
(ii) enhancing human development and im p r o v i n g social safety ne ts ; (iii) imp lemen t ing prudent f isca l 
policies; (iv) im p r o v i n g p u b l i c infrastructure; and (v) im p r o v i n g core p u b l i c sector functions. Table 1 
in Annex 7 divides the p o l i c y actions (p 1 -p 186 as described in Annex 7 o f the PRSP) among the th ree 
PRSP goals, and Table 2 in the same annex groups them i n t o the f ive themes identified in the JSA. 

6. Bank S t ra tegy 

F r om the b road range o f interventions proposed in the PRSP, the C A S focuses o n t h r e e areas w h i c h 
bes t fit the B a n k Group’s comparative advantage and complement the ac t iv i t ies o f other donors: (i) 
p r om o t i n g p r iva te sector g r ow t h by strengthening the f inanc ia l sector, im p r o v i n g p u b l i c sector

2003 o n a 4-point scale where 1 indicates n o obstacle). 
Improvements in the j u d i c i a l system 
w i l l b e measured by an increase in cou r t use rs ’ satisfaction w i th j u d i c i a l performance and 
services. Several intermediate indicators are essential to achieving an imp rovemen t o f this 
score (see the Results M a t r i x , Annex 1). The current p o r t f o l i o contributes t o these re su l ts 
th rough the F Y 0 4 Pub l ic Sector R e f o rm Credit, w h i c h tackles c i v i l service reform, pub l ic 
procurement, e-government, and l o c a l government re fo rm . Resu l ts re la t ing t o the j u d i c i a l 
system w i l l be achieved th rough the FYOl Jud ic ia l R e f o rm Project. Future lending, advisory 
and analytical activities w i l l also contribute. The se r ies o f PRSCs and the PRSC Technical 
Assistance credit”, are l i k e l y t o tack le tax reform, increased transparency o f the budget 
process at central and l o c a l leve ls , and app l ica t ion o f accounting standards amongst other 
things. An F Y 0 7 Pub l ic Sector P ro jec t in the High Case w o u l d address a b road range o f 
problems and thus contribute to further achievement o f these and re la ted resu l ts . In the AAA 
program, the fo l low -up to the Coun t ry F inanc ia l A c coun tab i l i t y Assessment w i l l help resolve 
budget and aud i t ing issues ; f inanc ia l sector advisory services w i l l help im p r o v e corporate 
governance, as w i l l IDFs o n pub l ic procurement and compe t i t ion p o l i c y . WBI’s planned 
capac i ty -bu i ld ing p rog ram f o r l o c a l governments and t ra in ing fo r c i v i l servants w i l l 
complement the efforts o f the Pub l ic Sector R e f o rm Credit. The Programmatic Pub l ic 
Expend i tu re Reviews, and the Coun t ry Econom ic Memorandum, w i l l help diagnose problems 
and mon i to r outcomes, and the regular bus iness su rveys w i l l help m o n i t o r results. 

(b) The financial system intermediates an increasing share o f investment capital, as meas- 
ured by the loans to GDP r a t i o increasing f r om 6% in 2003. IDA w i l l in f luence this r e s u l t by 
supporting 
improvements 
in bank ing regu la t ion and bank ing supervision, supporting 
development and mode rn iza t ion o f the f inanc ia l infrastructure i n c l u d i n g the payments system 
and credit i n f o rm a t i o n bureaus. I t w i l l also support e f fo r ts t o develop the non-bank f inanc ia l

programmatic support to re fo rms th rough the se r ies o f PRSCs. These new in i t ia t ive s w i l l

F inanc ia l In te l l igence Un i t , and t ra in government and f inanc ia l i n s t i t u t i o n o f f i c ia ls . 

(c) Communications infrastructure i s less o f a constraint to private sector development. 
Progress in remov ing in f ras t ruc tu re bottlenecks w i l l b e measured by the increase ( f r om a 
current baseline o f 1) in the number o f telecoms licenses issued in the C A S period, and by 
indicators re la t ing to transport, w h i c h w i l l be developed during the C A S period. Ongo ing 
w o r k to address these issues includes the FYOO Transport Project; PPIAF grants t o strengthen 
the mu l t i -sec to r utility regu la to r and t o assess telecommunications in r u r a l areas; and a 
reg iona l study o n r u r a l infrastructure. The proposed p o r t f o l i o inc ludes PRSC support fo r the 
telecoms sector, a renewable energy project, a t h i r d Soc ia l Investment Fund, and an F Y 0 7

6 . 2 Goal Two: Make growth more pro-poor 

3 8 . 
Long - te rm strategic goal. The PRSP puts a m a j o r emphasis o n ensuring that a larger share 
o f the popu la t ion b e n e f i t s f r om economic g row th . The C A S p rog ram acco rd ing ly has a focus o n 
helping make the bene f i ts o f g r ow t h mo re widely available by im p r o v i n g fo rma l sector j o b s and 
s t imu la t ing the r u r a l economy. F o r those w h o are n o t yet able to share in these benefits, the C A S 
focuses o n im p r o v i n g social protection. 

39. 
P r inc ipa l constraints. Three obstacles to ensuring that the p o o r benefit mo re f r om A rme - 
nia’s r a p i d economic g r ow t h w i l l requ i re close attention during the C A S pe r iod . 

(a) Job creation has been sluggish and the in fo rm a l sector i s large. The economy i s n o t 
creating enough fo rma l sector jobs, because f i r m s appear to have expanded by e xp lo i t ing 
unde r -u t i l ized cap i ta l rather than increasing employment, and because governance problems 
he lp sustain a high i n f o rm a l economy. Furthermore, labo r s k i l l s are n o t always a good ma tch 
fo r the j o b s that are available (see Section 6.3 be low ) . These structural problems are in 
themse lves a m a j o r obstacle t o fostering p ro -poo r growth, but even where there i s a po ten t ia l 
m a t c h between a j o b vacancy and an appropriately qua l i f ied person, deficiencies in the 
i n f o rm a t i o n sys tems available to employers and j o b seekers o f ten prevent the ma tch ac tua l ly 
being made. Very few agencies e f fec t ive ly link employers with po ten t ia l employees. 

(b) R u r a l livelihoods have stagnated. A l t h o u g h the re are some dynam ic developments in 
agriculture overall, the l ive l ihoods o f the r u r a l p o o r have stagnated over the past few years. 
Ag r icu l tu re supports around 25% o f the country’s population, h a v i n g absorbed the bulk o f 
labo r displaced by the economic contraction o f the 1990s. Production, however, remains 
m o s t l y at subsistence levels, w i t h farmers relying o n barter m u c h m o r e than cash transactions 
to dispose o f the sma l l su rp luses they do produce. M o s t fa rm ing i s l o w intensity (bo th cap i ta l 
and labor), so underemployment in r u r a l areas i s pervasive. Some areas o f the coun t r y are 
simply n o t v iab le fo r agriculture over the l o n g term, but, even in the f e r t i l e areas, the re i s 
limited fa rm specialization and intensification. M a r k e t in f ras t ruc tu re i s lac k ing (road 
cond i t ions are poor, there are n o wholesale markets, and few c o l d o r dry stores); ma rke t ing 
ins t i tu t ions are underdeveloped; and mach ine ry and input supplies are p o o r l y organized. L a n d 
ho ld ings are small, and, as land markets have recen t ly been established, conso l ida t ion i s o n l y 
just beginning. Farmers w i l l need add i t iona l support to im p r o v e management o f i r r i g a t i o n 
systems, and agriculture remains vulnerable to na tu ra l disasters. A l t h o u g h a g r ow i n g number 
o f successful agro-processing enterprises have emerged, and tou r ism i s deve lop ing in some 
parts o f the country, mos t r u r a l areas p rov ide few opportunities fo r w o r k outside agriculture. 

(c) T h e social protection system could be mo re efficient. Soc ia l p ro tec t ion has im p r o v e d 
ma rked ly in the past few years, with mos t b e n e f i t s n o w w e l l targeted and n o arrears in 
payments to beneficiaries - indeed the 2001 Househo ld Su rvey showed that transfers 
accounted fo r 15% o f the income o f the poorest quintile. Nonetheless further improvements 
in e f f ic iency and effectiveness c o u l d produce ma rked benefits f o r t h e poorest: adm in is t ra t ion 
o f m a n y benefits needs t o be mo re e f f ic ien t to reduce waste and delays; the p o v e r t y bene f i t 
needs to reach mo re o f the poor, pa r t icu la r ly in r u r a l areas; know ledge o f the bene f i t sys tem 
and c l a r i t y about i t s r u l e s need t o imp rove so mo re e l ig ib le beneficiaries reg is te r ; and the l e v e l

o f pensions needs to be increased, since average pensions have fa l len re la t ive t o average 
wages f r om 33% in 1996 to 21% in 2003." 

40. 
Results achievable in CAS period. The C A S proposes to help the Government overcome 
these constraints th rough an integrated se r ies o f ana ly t ica l wo rk , capacity building, programmatic and 
investment lending designed to achieve the f o l l ow i n g measurable resu l ts : 

(a) The importance o f the informal sector in the economy declines. A cco rd ing t o the PRSP, 
the i n f o rm a l sector accounts fo r an estimated 45% o f the to ta l economy, and the goa l i s f o r 
this t o f a l l over the C A S period. As fo rma l sector employment grows, people w i l l m o v e away 
f r om i n f o rm a l sector jobs, ga in ing lega l status, benefits, j o b security. The change w i l l also 
bene f i t Armenia 's investment c l ima te and f isca l revenues. The current p o r t f o l i o contributes to 
th is goa l th rough the F Y 0 4 Pub l ic Sector R e f o rm C red i t and the FYOl Jud ic ia l R e f o rm Credit, 
coordinated with capacity building w o r k o n an t i -co r rup t ion and procurement as well as 
adv iso ry w o r k to imp rove corporate governance. In the future po r t fo l io , the PRSCs and PRSC 
TA w i l l in f luence this objective, as w i l l the Coun t ry Econom ic Memorandum, 
the 
Programmatic Pove r ty Assessments, the Programmatic Pub l ic Expenditure Reviews and the 
L a b o r M a r k e t Study. The F Y 0 4 Social P ro tec t ion Adm in is t ra t ion P ro jec t w i l l help strengthen 
the reg iona l employment agencies, w h i c h link applicants and po ten t ia l employers. 

(b) The rural economy i s more productive. Since a v iab le ag r icu l tu ra l sector i s key t o a 
dynam ic o f f - f a rm economy, the ind ica to r o f a m o r e p roduc t ive r u r a l sector w i l l be an increase 
o f value-added per hectare f r om US$1,370 in 2003. On -go ing w o r k towards this outcome 
includes the F Y 9 8 A g r i c u l t u r a l R e f o rm Support Credit, the FY 9 9 Title Reg is t ra t ion Project, 
the FY 9 9 I r r i g a t i o n D a m Safety, and the F Y 0 2 I r r i g a t i o n Deve lopmen t project, as well as 
studies o n r u r a l p r o d u c t i v i t y and o n r u r a l infrastructure. The F Y 0 4 Hea l th and Educa t ion 
p ro jec ts are addressing the qua l i ty o f r u r a l services, and the Trans Caucasus Tou r ism I n i t i a t i v e 
i s helping p romo te the o f f - f a rm economy in select r u r a l areas. Proposed new interventions 
inc lude the FY 0 5 R u r a l Deve lopmen t Project, with a second r u r a l operation in FY08 . The 
FY 0 8 Project c o u l d inc lude substantial support f o r i r r i g a t i o n a n d o r f o r land t i t l i n g wo rk , and 
i t s scope w i l l be c la r i f ied in the C A S Progress Report. A d v i s o r y support to the telecoms 
sector w i l l help imp rove services in r u r a l areas, and the F Y 0 7 In f ras t ruc tu re P ro jec t i s likely t o 
im p r o v e key r u r a l infrastructure, i n c l u d i n g roads. 

(c) Soc ia l transfers are more effect ive . The effectiveness o f social transfers w i l l be measured 
by imp rovemen t in the satisfaction o f use rs with the soc ia l p ro tec t ion system f r om a baseline 
t o be determined. A prerequisite f o r imp rovemen ts in this measure w i l l be better tax 
co l lec t ion so that mo re funds are available fo r transfers, i n c l u d i n g the f am i l y p o v e r t y benefit. 
The F Y 0 4 Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Adm in is t ra t ion P ro jec t i s the p r im a r y t o o l to affect th is result. 
The proposed PRSCs and PRSC TA, as we l l as a WB I p rog ram to support pensions 
adm in is t ra t ion w i l l support these objectives, and ana ly t ica l w o r k in the Programmatic Pub l ic 
Expenditure Reviews, the Coun t ry E conom ic Memo randum and Programmatic Pove r ty 
Assessmen ts w i l l also he lp achieve the goal. 

" In contrast, the average n o t i o n a l pens ion as a share o f average wages was 25% in Georg ia , 32% in A z e r b a i j a n and 37% 
in Russia.

(d) Extreme consumption poverty falls. The goa l i s fo r extreme consump t ion po ve r ty to 
decline f r om 17% in 2002. M a n y interventions in the on -go ing and fu tu re po r t fo l ios 
contribute t o this goal. Because i t i s n o t yet clear why economic g r ow t h has n o t led to deeper 
reductions in poverty, ana ly t ica l w o r k t o address this i s s u e (the Labo r M a r k e t Study, the C E M 
o n p ro -poo r g r ow t h and the Programmatic Pove r ty Assessments) w i l l be a m a j o r element o f 
the C A S w o r k program. A d d i t i o n a l results and measures m a y be developed in the C A S 
Progress Repo r t in the light o f the conclusions o f those studies. The PRSCs and PRSC TA 
w i l l b e m a j o r IDA vehicles fo r in f luenc ing these results, but m a n y on -go ing and future 
interventions w i l l also contribute. 

6 . 3 Goal Three: Reduce non-income poverty 

41. 
Long-term strategic goal. The PRSP and th is C A S focus o n the need t o increase the well- 
being o f the poo r by im p r o v i n g their access t o affordable healthcare, education, drinking water, 
sanitation and heating. 

42. 
Principal problems. A l t h o u g h essential re fo rms in healthcare, education and infrastructure 
have begun, and basic services in some parts o f the coun t ry have imp roved s ign i f ican t ly , they s t i l l do 
n o t come close to meeting the needs o f a r a p i d l y g r ow i n g and mode rn iz ing economy. 

(a) Poor quality education. The education system does n o t meet the country’s new needs. 
A rmen ia ’s p u b l i c expenditures o n education are very l o w (among the lowes t in the FSU), and 
available resources are n o t used e f f i c ien t ly -- f o r example the school system has n o t adapted to 
the decline in A rmen ia ’s popu la t ion since independence, resulting in an excessively high 
teachedpupil ra t io . Furthermore, the school cu r r icu lum i s n o t p rope r ly equ ipp ing ch i ld ren f o r 
the labo r market, since the cu r r icu lum has n o t yet been fully r e v i s e d t o meet the needs o f a 
ma rke t economy. Fac i l i t ies are inadequate and teachers are n o t p rope r ly skilled o r motivated. 

(b) Unaffordable health care. The healthcare system does n o t generally p r o v i d e affordable 
services, n o r are they o f adequate qua l i t y . Pub l ic expenditures o n healthcare are l o w and 
p o o r l y targeted, with the excessively large hosp i ta l ne two rk absorbing mo re than h a l f o f 
p u b l i c hea l th expenditures. As a consequence p r im a r y hea l th care i s starved o f funds, with 
u n o f f i c i a l side-payments large and frequent (ha l f o f a l l households using healthcare services 
repo r t m a k i n g u n o f f i c i a l payments). The need f o r such u n o f f i c i a l payments i s an impo r tan t 
reason that o n l y 22% o f the p o o r report using the healthcare system when they are sick. S t a f f 
are n o t p rope r ly skilled o r motivated, school buildings have b e e n inadequately maintained, 
and m u c h o f the equipment i s outdated. 

(c) Lack of investment in infrastructure. The poo r f inanc ia l cond i t ion o f m a n y o f t h e country’s 
u t i l i t i e s has precluded adequate investment in infrastructure. F e w peop le have 24-hour supply 
o f drinking water, and even fewe r have adequate wastewater services. An increasing number 
o f water supply p ipe l ines f a i l to c om p l y with sanitary standards, lead ing to eme rg ing 
outbreaks o f water-borne diseases. Since 2002, Ye revan has seen imp rovemen ts in water 
ava i lab i l i ty and quality, but further improvements are required. Other parts o f A rm e n i a have 
seen almost n o progress. Performance o f the e lec t r ic i ty u t i l i t i e s has im p r o v e d substantially, 
with collections rising and ta r i f fs increasing. These higher ta r i f f s m a y make i t d i f f i c u l t f o r 
some o f the poorest consumers t o a f f o r d these services. M a n y A rmen ians s u f f e r during the

Since the ea r ly 1990s, A rmen ia has benefited f r om a high l e v e l o f in te rna t iona l assistance. 
Ove r the last f i v e years, o f f i c i a l donor assistance and remittances represented 11% o f GDP, with 
b i la te ra l donors accounting fo r about 60% o f this assistance. O f the rema in ing 40% o f a i d p r o v i d e d 
by mu l t i la te ra l donors, IDA p rov ided about two-thirds, and the European U n i o n a fifth.14 Substantial 
u n o f f i c i a l assistance has also been available, m a i n l y f r om diaspora sources. One US-based 
founda t ion has been pa r t i cu la r l y prominent, p r o v i d i n g support averaging 6% o f GDP f o r the last t h r e e 
years. 15 

45. 
I t i s n o t yet clear whether high levels o f donor assistance f r om ex is t ing sources w i l l continue 
ove r the C A S pe r iod . Howeve r , A rmen ia w i l l have access to a new source o f investment finance -- 
the Millennium Challenge Accoun t - - being established by the U S Government. The C A S p ro jec t ions 
assume that A rm e n i a w i l l continue to en joy strong donor support, poss ib ly dec l in ing as the country’s 
per capita income increases, and that IDA w i l l rema in an impo r tan t source o f assistance. 

46. 
A l t h o u g h i t i s cu r ren t ly n o t c red i two r thy f o r IBRD lending, A rmen ia cou ld po ten t ia l ly become 
so towards the end o f the C A S period. This w o u l d requ i re good macroeconomic performance,

i t y w i l l b e mon i to red ove r the C A S period, and an update, w i t h specific creditworthiness benchmarks, 
p rov ided at the time o f the C A S Progress Report. Preparing the w a y f o r IBRD lending i s pa r t icu la r ly 
impo r tan t given Armenia’s r a p i d l y rising per capita income, w h i c h cou ld lead to i t being given blend 
( o f IDA and IBRD) status in the nex t C A S pe r iod . 

47. 
A rmen ia became a High Case pe r fo rme r during the 2002-2004 C A S period, h a v i n g achieved 
the highest IDA performance coe f f ic ien t in the E C A region. I t w i l l enter the new C A S in a Base Case 
scenario fo r IDA support, w h i c h assumes a con t inua t ion o f the ex is t ing good pe r fo rmance and 
p rov ides IDA lend ing o f US$170 m i l l i o n . I f A rmen ia makes further imp rovemen ts in p u b l i c sector

reforms o f the p u b l i c sector th rough an add i t iona l Pub l ic Sector Mode rn iza t ion Credit, add i t iona l 
PRSC resources, and add i t iona l funding fo r r u r a l development and infrastructure. IDA resources o f 
about US$220 m i l l i o n w i l l become available in the H igh Case. 
In the unexpected event o f 
deteriorating performance, a L o w Case scenario w o u l d reduce IDA lending to about US $ 9 0 m i l l i o n . 
This w i l l i n v o l v e h a l t i n g new PRSC lending, and res t r ic t ing new investment operations t o those that 
d i rec t ly protect the mos t vulnerable. 

48. 
The triggers fo r m o v i n g to the High Case are based m a i n l y o n the Government’s amb i t ious 
targets f o r social sector spending and tax collections, and imp rovemen t in the pe r fo rmance o f p u b l i c

- A steady increase in expenditure and/or e f f ic iency o f spending o n education, hea l th and 
social security f o l l ow i n g targets se t in the PRSP. 

6.6.2 C r o s s - c u t t i ng themes 

54. 
The C A S w i l l place m a j o r emphasis o n learning and capacity building. Given Armenia’s 
good track reco rd m a k i n g e f fec t ive use o f IDA resources, th is C A S puts s ign i f ican t emphasis o n 
programmatic wo rk , conducted co l labo ra t ive ly between IDA, Government and other donors 
con t inuous ly over the course o f C A S implementation. Comp lemen t ing IDA’S p lanned activities, the 
W o r l d B a n k Ins t i tu te (WBI) has developed a comprehensive w o r k p l a n f o r add i t iona l capacity 
enhancement support (see paragraph 64 and Annex 3). The Ins t i tu te w i l l w o r k w i t h l o c a l partners and 
NGOs to leverage their l o c a l know ledge and imp rove cost-effectiveness. 

55 . 

Armenia’s capacity for poverty monitoring and analysis i s reasonably good, as the Na t iona l 
Statistical Service (NSS) has conducted regular household su rveys f o r a number o f years. 
Improvements cou ld be made in a number o f areas: (i) strengthening the linkages be tween d i f fe ren t 
household surveys; (ii) im p r o v i n g the measure o f household we l fa re by ad jus t ing fo r reg iona l prices 
and economies o f scale within households; (iii) upda t ing questionnaires t o re f lec t current po l ic ie s 
(e.g. o n social assistance) and p rov ide better i n f o rm a t i o n (e.g. o n emp loymen t and earnings); (iv) 
developing p o v e r t y maps as a p o l i c y tool; and (v) im p r o v i n g m o n i t o r i n g o f non - income dimensions 
o f poverty, pa r t i cu la r l y health, education and labo r markets. The PRSP f o l l ow - u p process i s he lp ing 
the Government imp rove i t s capacity fo r m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o f development results, and 
helping the Statistical Service better ta i lo r i t s data f o r the needs o f p o l i c y evaluation. UNDP, in co - 
o rd ina t ion with IDA, has a p rog ram t o further develop that capacity. 

56. Gender i s integrated i n t o m a n y areas o f the w o r k program. The Programmatic Pove r ty 
Assessmen ts w i l l disaggregate a l l relevant data by gender. One o f the mos t impo r tan t gender i s s u e s 
in A rmen ia i s maternal health, since the coun t ry has re la t ive ly high rates o f ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y and 
abortion; the F Y 0 4 H e a l t h p ro jec t addresses b o t h o f these p rob lems d i rec t ly . Some issues , such as 
why so m a n y boys d rop ou t o f secondary school, w i l l b e addressed unde r the F Y 0 4 Educa t ion 
Project. The proposed L a b o r M a r k e t Study w i l l p a y pa r t icu la r attention to differences in h o w men 
and women fare in the labo r market, and the business su rvey m a y inc lude a modu le t o address the 
specific i s s u e s faced by w om e n entrepreneurs. 

57. 

Environmental issues are also well mainstreamed in the program. In add i t ion t o on -go ing 
w o r k o n na tu ra l resource management, and a proposed Coun t ry Env i ronmen ta l Assessment, m a n y 
interventions w i l l imp rove env i ronmen ta l conditions. The Renewable Energy Project aims t o reduce 
Armenia’s dependence o n impo r ted fos s i l fue ls , and plans t o leverage grant funding f r om GEF, the 
Prototype Ca rbon Fund and related instruments, as we l l as poss ib ly f r om the EBRD, USAID and

activities began to p l a y a l e s s central r o l e in the process. Since preparation and imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
PRSP, however, the Government has resumed a mo re active role. The PRSP process has helped 
c l a r i f y the Government’s p r io r i t ies , and the Ministry o f Finance and E c o n om y i s inc reas ing ly using i t 
to attract f inanc ing f o r p r i o r i t y investments and activities. UNDP and IDA are helping strengthen th is 
function. 
In the last few years, independently o f the Government, donors have been meeting 
regu la r ly to share in fo rma t ion , coordinate plans and programs, and reduce duplication. Fourteen 
sector-specific Partner Groups have been established fo r this purpose, and an umb re l la D o n o r 
Coo rd ina t ion G roup m e e t s o n a m o n t h l y basis in Yerevan. These meetings w i l l continue ove r the

6 . 9 Risks of the strategy 

78. 

The situation in and around A rmen ia c o u l d change in a number o f ways that w o u l d affect 
development in the coun t ry b o t h f o r better and f o r worse. 

i. Political change in the Caucasus region. B o t h pos i t ive and nega t ive developments in the 
r e g i o n are possible over the C A S period. IDA ’S FY05 Coun t ry E conom i c Memo randum w i l l 
analyze h o w A rmen ia can bes t prepare i t s e l f f o r possible 
improvements, 
i n c l u d i n g 
investments that w o u l d a l l ow the economy t o reap the f u l l e s t benefits f r om developments such 
as a no rma l iza t ion o f trade relations. A l t h o u g h i t i s n o t considered likely at this time, renewed 
ins tab i l i ty in the Caucasus i s possible, and i t w o u l d make imp lemen ta t ion o f m u c h o f the 
proposed strategy d i f f i c u l t . In this event, s ign i f ican t adjustments in the w o r k p rog ram w o u l d 
be unavoidable, and the Execu t ive D i rec to rs w o u l d be consulted o n a rev ised strategy. 

ii. Political consensus in Armenia. A rmen ia ’s very impressive r e f o rm track reco rd has 
depended o n strong p o l i t i c a l consensus, b o t h w i t h i n and between the executive and leg is la t ive 
branches. As discussed earlier, the domestic p o l i t i c a l context i s becom ing mo re complicated, 
and this c o u l d affect r e f o rm momen tum by reduc ing pub l ic , inves to r and/or donor confidence. 

-28- 

A deceleration in improvements in tax revenues and/or slower economic g r ow t h c o u l d 
increase the f inanc ing gap to the extent that expected l e v e l s o f IDA adjustment lending and 
donor funding c o u l d n o t cover i t . The CAS p rog ram aims to m i t iga te this risk by outreach and 
know ledge activities, and encouraging active pa r t ic ipa t ion and dialogue w i t h Government and 
c i v i l society around the PRSP process generally, and o n a range o f specific r e f o rm p r io r i t ies , 
i n c l u d i n g hea l th and education revitalization, l o c a l government development, strengthening o f 
governance and an t i -co r rup t ion efforts, and improvements in social p ro tec t ion arrangements. 

iii. Exogenous econom ic shocks. Any decline in g loba l demand w o u l d likely hamper A rmen ia ’s 
export g r ow t h and reduce workers’ remittances and perhaps diaspora assistance. An o i l p r i c e 
shock w o u l d also affect the A rmen ian economy - every $5 increase in the p r i c e o f a ba r re l o f 
o i l increases Armenia’s im p o r t b i l l by the equivalent o f 1 percent o f GDP. I f exogenous 
shocks cause a m a j o r sh i f t in Armenia’s economic situation, IDA w o u l d r e v i s i t the 
p r i o r i t i z a t i o n o f i t s lending and AAA and amend the p o r t f o l i o as necessary. 

iv . Un e xp e c t ed natural resou rce shock , such as an earthquake, m a j o r drought, flood, landslide, 
o r frost. IDA i s helping the Government reduce Armenia’s vu lne rab i l i ty to na tu ra l disasters 
th rough 
the various ongo ing and planned r u r a l and na tu ra l resource management 
interventions, by ensuring that m a j o r construction financed by the B a n k complies w i t h 
earthquake-compatible building codes, and th rough a dam safety p rog ram that reinforces the 
country’s impo r tan t barrages.

Introduction 

Executive Summary 

In 2001, IDA’S boa rd approved a coun t ry assistance strategy (CAS) f o r A rm e n i a f o r the 
p e r i o d FY2002-2004. This comp le t ion repo r t evaluates progress imp lemen t ing that CAS . 

CAS Objectives 

The 2001 C A S had three b road objectives: (i) creating j o b s th rough p r iva te sector 
development; (ii) im p r o v i n g governance and p u b l i c sector services; and (iii) rebuilding 
human capital. These objectives complemented the goals o f the I n t e r im Pove r t y 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper, w h i c h was published sho r t ly be fo re the CAS . 

Country Outcomes 

A rmen ia has made substantial progress ove r the C A S period. The economy grew by 13% 
in 2002 and 14% in 2003, with inc reas ing ly diverse sources o f g row th . Manu fac tu r ing 
exports grew by 50% over the p e r i o d and A rmen ia increased exports to counties outside 
the C IS . Acco rd ing t o surveys, the business environment - registration, licensing, 
inspections, customs clearances, tax requirements and co r rup t ion - have im p r o v e d since 
2000. The number o f f i r m s increased by 15% between 2001 and 2003 and sma l l and 
m e d i um en te rp r ise g r ow t h was about 7% per year during the C A S pe r iod . Howeve r , 
f o rm a l sector employment has n o t g r ow n at the same rate as output. This i s because 
redundancies f r om state owned enterprises have continued, and because m a n y f i r m s 
appear to have expanded by using surplus cap i ta l rather than hiring new employees. 

A rmen ia has seen some progress in reduc ing poverty, w h i c h f e l l f r om 55% in 1998/99 to 
48% in 2001. Be tween 2001 and 2002, however, ove ra l l pove r t y increased slightly 
(pove r ty in Yerevan con t inued t o fall, r u r a l pove r t y remained stagnant and p o v e r t y in 
other u rban areas increased). The increase in pove r t y in other u rban areas i s puzz l ing . 
The stagnant pove r ty s i tua t ion in r u r a l areas appears t o b e the r e s u l t o f wo rsen ing 
domestic ag r icu l tu ra l t e r m s o f trade, with resu l t ing declines in returns to labo r in some 
r u r a l areas, since the ag r icu l tu ra l labo r fo rce remains high. Subsistence fa rm ing s t i l l 
dominates, despite some comme rc ia l successes in agriculture, pa r t icu la r ly in the fe r t i le 
A ra ra t valley. 

Ove r the C A S period, p u b l i c sector services and governance b o t h improved, a l though 
further progress i s s t i l l necessary. The Government completed the f i rs t stage o f c i v i l 
service r e f o rm and prepared and began imp lemen t ing an an t i -co r rup t ion strategy. The 
average pension increased by 30%, and pens ion arrears were cleared. Ta rge t ing o f social 
p ro tec t ion schemes has im p r o v e d and leakage i s l ow . The quas i - f isca l de f ic i t associated 
with the powe r sector (equivalent to 2% o f GDP) was e l im ina ted and mos t o f the coun t r y 
n o w has uninterrupted powe r supply. By 2003, nea r ly h a l f o f the p o p u l a t i o n o f Ye revan 
(close to one fifth o f the country’s popu la t ion ) h a d at least 12 hou rs supply o f good 
qua l i ty water compared t o o n l y 10% in 2001. By M a r c h 2004, h a l f o f the c i ty ’s 
popu la t ion had service 2 4 hours per day.

H um a n capital has imp roved . Hea l th outcomes are better, a l though the imp rovemen t was 
n o t as great the 2001 C A S h a d targeted. D i f fe rences between outcomes in u rban and 
r u r a l areas are marked. People are n o t using hea l th services, at least in pa r t because 
fo rma l and i n f o rm a l payments can be una f fo rdab ly high. Social p ro tec t ion mechanisms 
in t roduced in 1999, however, do appear t o be helping the p o o r access healthcare t o some 
extent. Pa r t ic ipa t ion in basic education remains high, but children, especially boys, are 
d ropp ing out o f secondary school. Th is i s a pa r t icu la r p rob lem in r u r a l areas and f o r 
poorer children. The Government i s w o r k i n g to imp rove the qua l i t y o f education. Pub l ic 
expenditure o n b o t h hea l th and education has increased but remains l o w in b o t h sectors. 

I D A S contribution to country outcomes 

The 2001 CAS set a series o f outcome targets, a l l o f w h i c h have either b e e n me t o r have 
seen substantial progress. In m a n y cases, IDA interventions, o f ten in a m u t u a l l y 
supportive package o f ana ly t ica l work, investment and po l icy -based lending, made direct 
contributions towards the coun t ry results discussed above. Measu r ing the precise 
con t r ibu t ion o f IDA ac t iv i t ies t o those outcomes i s d i f f icu l t , however, because the C A S 
did n o t exp la in the mechanisms, and some indicators did n o t fit the interventions. 

Evaluation o f CAS performance 

IDA’s performance was satisfactory. The focus o f the CAS, the m i x and de s ign o f 
interventions were a l l appropriate. The qua l i t y o f IDA’s w o r k appears t o have b e e n 
good, judging f r om in te rna l repo r t ing systems as well as OED and Q A G reports. M a n y 
o f the products were n o t de l ive red at the time planned. In some cases this was a 
deliberate decision in response to changing circumstances, but in other cases, delays 
resulted f r om k e y s t a f f members n o t being available at the right time. 

Lessons for future CAS design 

The areas o f focus and the m i x o f interventions were appropriate and should be 
continued. Fu tu re w o r k shou ld perhaps put mo re e f fo r t i n t o ensuring that g r ow t h 
leads to as m u c h emp loymen t and pove r t y reduc t ion as possible. 
Outcome ind ica to rs shou ld be linked mo re c lea r ly to IDA in te rven t ions and should be 
used as a management t o o l throughout C A S implementation. 
D e v o l v i n g respons ib i l i ty f o r p o r t f o l i o management t o the coun t ry manager helped 
imp rove p o r t f o l i o qua l i ty and should be continued. 
A strong mu l t i -sec to ra l team w i t h some task management respons ib i l i t ies in the 
coun t ry o f f i c e was impo r tan t f o r ach iev ing results and fu tu re w o r k shou ld be 
designed to bene f i t f r om this team as m u c h as possible. 
During imp lemen ta t ion o f future CASs, management needs t o p a y pa r t icu la r attention 
to ensuring ava i lab i l i ty o f key s ta f f at the appropriate time. 
Consultations o n the nex t C A S can bene f i t f r om recent discussions concerning the 
PRSP, a l l ow i n g the C A S discussions t o concentrate o n h o w IDA can best help the

Introduction 

1. 

This document reviews the experience imp lemen t ing the In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t 
Assoc ia t ion (1DA)’s Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved in April 25,2001, 
(Report No . 2 2 1 1 1-AM). The C A S covered f inanc ia l years 2002-2004. 

2. Armenia’s Objectives 

The C A S in tended t o support the f o l l ow i n g objectives stated in A rmen ia ’s Interim 
Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (M a r c h 2001, repo r t N o . 2213 1): 

0 

0 Sustainable and equitable economic g r ow t h driven by a mo re dynamic p r iva te 
sector. The p u b l i c actions proposed i n v o l v e d reduc ing administrative barriers t o 
investment and entry, building e f fec t ive pub l ic -p r i va te consultative mechanisms 
and creating a l e v e l p l a y i n g field f o r new and ex is t ing companies. 
Pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion r e f o rm and an an t i -co r rup t ion program. Pub l ic actions 
inc luded s t ream l in ing the c i v i l service and k e y regu la to ry agencies, advancing 
j u d i c i a l r e f o rm and im p r o v i n g domestic revenue collection. 
Enhanced human development, Pub l ic actions inc luded add i t iona l f inanc ing f o r 
school education, basic hea l th and in f ras t ruc tu re maintenance (assuming 
im p r o v e d utility revenues and savings f r om reduced subsidies t o utilities), and 
im p r o v e d targeting o f social p ro tec t ion and education expenditures. 

Ne i the r the C A S n o r the I -PRSP made an exp l ic i t link t o the Millennium Deve lopmen t 
Goals (MDGs), but the objectives overlapped w i t h MDG targets. The in te rven t ions t o 
p romo te the p r iva te sector, t o imp rove p u b l i c administration, and t o reduce co r rup t ion 
were in tended t o reduce extreme poverty, as were the proposed interventions to im p r o v e 
social protection. In te rven t ions to p romo te human development c lea r ly help A rm e n i a 
meet the goals re la t ing t o hea l th and education. The C A S ’ S proposed investments in 
na tu ra l resource management, water supply and u rban hea t ing w o u l d a l l help A rm e n i a 
meet the MDG re la t ing t o env i ronmen ta l sustainability. A rmen ia has already m e t G o a l 3

Armenia’s current status against the MDG targets and the W o r l d Bank ’s eva lua t ion o f the 
l i k e l i h o o d o f the coun t ry meeting the goals are l i s t e d in Table 7 o f the FY05-08 Coun t ry

4. Armenia’s progress towards i t s goals 

The coun t ry made substantial progress towards these results, based o n the f o l l ow i n g : 

A rmen ia ’s economy grew strongly, d r iven by the p r i v a t e sector. Rea l GDP grew 
by 10% in 2001, 13% in 2002 and 15% in the f i r s t nine mon ths o f 2003, and the 
basis o f the economy has begun to diversify. M o r e than 70% o f GDP was 
generated by the p r iva te sector. Manu fac tu r ing exports grew by mo re than 50% in 
t w o years, and A rmen ia has expanded i t s export markets beyond those o f the CIS. 
The business c l ima te has imp roved : f i r m s ’ ove ra l l confidence in the government 
and in the business environment imp roved f r om an average o f 2.6 in 2000 t o 3.3 
in 2001 (on a 6 p o i n t scale, where 1 = to ta l lack o f confidence). Bus inesses repo r t 
imp rovemen ts in bus iness registration, licensing, inspections and the tax system. 
New firm g r ow t h was good: the stock o f f i r m s grew by 15% between 2001 and 
2003, and sma l l and medium en te rp r ise g r ow t h was app rox ima te ly 7% p.a. over 
the same period. Fo rma l sector employment did n o t m a t c h g r ow t h in output. 
Aggregate emp loymen t remains l ow e r than i t was in 1990 although i t did increase 
in 2002 and 2003. There are t w o reasons f o r this. First, the massive j o b shedding 
f r om state owned enterprises has con t inued t o the present day. Second, bus iness 
surveys ind ica te that n ew f i r m s i n i t i a l l y h a d surplus capacity because investments 
needed t o be o f a minimum economic scale. As domestic and export demand 
increased, companies used that surplus capacity and then they plus add i t iona l new 
entrants began t o increase the demand f o r labor. 
A rmen ia has made someprogress in reduc ingpove r ty . Pove r t y f e l l f r om 5 5% in 
1998/99 t o 48% in 2001, with the sharpest d rop seen in Yerevan. P re l im ina ry 
data ind ica te that between 2001 and 2002, this progress m a y have halted, as the 
ove ra l l pove r ty incidence appears to have increased slightly. Over the la t te r 
period, p o v e r t y appears t o have continued f a l l i n g in Yerevan, to have remained 
stagnant in r u r a l areas but t o have increased in other u rban areas. The 2002 
results m a y b e affected by government po l ic ies that caused the pove r t y f am i l y 
bene f i t to f a l l considerably in 2002 (the numbe r o f beneficiaries f e l l by 1 1 % and 
the average l e v e l o f benefit by 15%). These po l ic ies were reversed in 2003 with 
expenditure re tu rn ing to 2001 leve ls . 
Governance has improved. Be tween 2000 and 2002, B u s i n e s s Env i ronmen t and 
Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS) ind ica te that A rm e n i a has seen 
imp rovemen ts in p o l i t i c a l stability, government effectiveness, regu la to ry quality, 
r u l e o f law, and con t ro l o f corruption. Howeve r , the coun t ry ’s ratings f o r vo ice 
and accoun tab i l i ty f e l l over the same pe r iod . On a l l measures except p o l i t i c a l 
stability, A rm e n i a pe r fo rms better than the average f o r the CIS. Transparency 
International’s Co r rup t ion Perceptions Index rates A rm e n i a as 78th o f 133 
countries surveyed, the highest rank ing in the F S U apart f r om the B a l t i c countries 
and Belarus. F reedom House ra ted A rm e n i a at 4/7 f o r p o l i t i c a l rights in 2000, up 
f r om 3 /7 in 1998, and rated A rmen ia at 4/7 in b o t h years f o r c i v i l l i b e r t i e s . A n n u a l 
bus iness su rveys s im i la r t o BEEPS also ind ica te imp rovemen ts in governance. 
F o r example, t h e share o f f i r m s repo r t ing m a k i n g bribes f requen t ly dec l ined f r om 

-43- 

40% in 1999 t o 14% in 2002, and the average bribe as a share o f revenue declined 
f r om 4.2% to 1% over the same pe r iod . 
C i v i l service reform has begun. The Government passed a c i v i l service l a w and 
s im i la r laws f o r the diplomatic, tax, customs and po l ice services. I t established a 
C i v i l Service Counc i l to oversee management in l i n e agencies. In addition, a l a w 
o n remuneration o f c i v i l servants was passed in Ju l y 2002, w h i c h requ i res , among 
other things, that a l l senior c i v i l servants p u b l i c l y declare their assets. W i t h 
assistance f r om DFID, the Government has reviewed a l l central executive bodies 
and has reorganized and written charters f o r mos t ministries. I t has also m o v e d 
many agencies f r om direct central con t ro l t o l i n e m in is t r ies , to c l a r i f y 
accoun tab i l i ty and strengthen oversight. The f i rs t phase o f r e f o rm i s thus 
complete, b u t substantial w o r k remains t o bring about changes in the actual 
func t ion ing o f government ins t i tu t ions . 
Energy and wa te r services have improved considerably. Water services have 
imp roved considerably, but the improvements have a l l been in Ye revan (w h i c h 
accounts fo r almost 40% o f the country’s population). By mid 2003,39% o f the 
popu la t ion h a d 2 4 hours supply and an add i t iona l 7% h a d i t f o r at least 12 hours 
per day. This compares t o o n l y 10% o f Yerevan’s popu la t ion that had 12-hour 
supply in 2001. The u t i l i t y i s w o r k i n g m o r e e f f ic ien t ly ; 80 percent o f the 
households have meters, and collections have r i s e n f r om 33% o f billed water in 
the pe r iod M a y - J u l y 2002 t o 84% in the same pe r iod in 2003. l6 Drinking water 
qua l i ty i s good; 98% o f the water supply in Ye revan meets qua l i t y standards, but 
the deteriorating infrastructure i s beginning to compromise these standards. In the 
powe r sector, the who le coun t ry has benefited f r om m a j o r improvements. A lm o s t 
the entire popu la t ion n o w has un in te r rup ted e lec t r ic i ty supply. T a r i f f co l lec t ion 
has increased f r om 80% in 2001 to 98% in 2003. The quasi-fiscal de f ic i t 
associated with the e lec t r ic i ty sector (2% o f GDP in 2001) has been e f fe c t i ve ly 
e l im ina ted since the d is t r ibu t ion company was p r iva t ized in Novembe r 2002. The 
Energy Regu la to ry Comm is s ion has been transformed t o a m u l t i - u t i l i t y regulator, 
a l though the agency needs t o develop add i t iona l capacity. The Government 
adopted an U r b a n Hea t ing Strategy in September 2002; i t has removed some o f 
the barriers to sustainable hea t ing services, and i s n o w p i l o t i n g e f f i c ien t and l e s s 
p o l l u t i n g approaches to hea t ing large apartment buildings. As a resu l t o f increased 
e lec t r ic i ty prices and im p r o v e d co l lec t ion rates, 50,000 households sw i tched to 
gas fo r heating, w h i c h i s mo re e f f ic ien t and l e s s po l lu t ing . 
The c o u n t y ’s soc ia l p ro tec t ion system has improved. The Government has 
cleared i t s arrears, and the average pens ion increased by 30% between 2001 and 
2003. Su rveys ind ica te that ta rge t ing o f the soc ia l p ro tec t ion schemes has 
im p r o v e d and that leakage i s low , a l though further improvements are s t i l l 
necessary. The Government has set up a personal iden t i f ica t ion system f o r a l l the 
Armenians (more than 250,000 people n o w have P IN numbers) fo r au toma t ing 
the social insurance, social we l fa re o f f ices and emp loymen t services. A lm o s t a l l 
people in f o rm a l emp loymen t n o w make the i r social insurance contributions, w i t h

the number increasing by 100,000 between 2001 and 2003. The Government has 
begun t o mode rn ize the pens ion administration system, setting up a management 
i n f o rm a t i o n system with i n d i v i d u a l records fo r those covered by social insurance 
(contributors to the system) and their employers, as well as computerized records 
fo r current pensioners. They are expected to complete this mode rn iza t ion in 2006. 
Howeve r , the pens ion adm in is t ra t ion needs add i t iona l human resources capacity 
and im p r o v e d accounting and administrative sys tems . To address labo r ma rke t 
problems, the Government has prepared D r a f t Labo r Code and developed a new 
system f o r t ra in ing the unemp loyed t o better ma t ch the labo r supply and demand. 
Human cap i ta l has improved. A cco rd ing t o administrative data, be tween 200 1 
and 2003, ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y f e l l f r om 47 per 100,000 l i v e s births t o 34. Other 
sources give higher figures, but also show pos i t ive trends. Under five m o r t a l i t y 
f e l l f r om 25 per 1,000 l ive births t o 16 over the same period. These figures mask a 
s ign i f ican t difference be tween r u r a l and u rban areas. A cco rd ing t o su rvey data 
(ADHS 2000), r u r a l i n f a n t and early ch i ldhood m o r t a l i t y rates exceeded u rban 
rates by 47 percent and 2 2 percent, respectively, during the 1990s. The healthcare 
system has im p r o v e d as the Government has increased the share o f spending 
allocated t o p r im a r y healthcare and established a system o f f am i l y doctors. 
Substantial p rob lems remain, however. O f f i c i a l and u n o f f i c i a l payments are high 
and because there i s n o insurance mechanism, these costs o f ten deter people f r om 
using services. The p o v e r t y f am i l y benefit does appear to have helped some 
people use healthcare services, but o n the who le use rates are l ow . The coun t ry 
s t i l l has excess hosp i ta l capacity and p u b l i c spending o n the sector remains l ow . 
Pa r t ic ipa t ion in basic education i s high, w i t h a n e t en ro l lmen t rate o f 94% in 2001, 
spread f a i r l y even ly across quintiles. Secondary education, however, i s mo re 
problematic. Su rveys ind ica te that the net en ro l lmen t rate in secondary education 
i s 61%, and i s lowe r fo r the poo r (52% f o r the poorest quintile versus 64% f o r the 
richest). Pub l ic spending o n education increased by 45% between 1997 and 2001 
but remains l ow . IDA he lped ensure that high q u a l i t y textbooks are available t o 
a l l at a reasonable cost, he lped create some manage r ia l and f inanc ia l autonomy in 
40% o f a l l schools and encouraged greater parent invo lvemen t in schools. I t also 
helped begin conso l ida t ion o f unde ru t i l ized schools. 
R u r a l areas have no t g r ow n as much as u rban areas. Pove r t y rates in r u r a l areas 
stagnated be tween 1998/99 and 2001, while they dropped considerably in u rban 
areas. There are few o f f - f a rm opportunities and subsistence f a rm i n g s t i l l 
dominates ( o n l y 29% o f fa rm ing households had comme rc ia l su rp luses in 2001) 
ind ica t ing that ag r icu l tu re i s s t i l l a basic safety net f o r m a n y fam i l ies . Domes t ic 
ag r icu l tu ra l terms o f trade worsened eve ry year between 1997 and 2002 and 
agriculture’s share o f GDP declined consistently ove r the same pe r iod . Since the 
size o f the ag r icu l tu ra l wo rk fo rce rema ined constant, r e t u r n s to labo r in some 
r u r a l areas m a y have declined. W h i l e o n average r u r a l areas have stagnated, some 
sectors, pa r t i cu la r l y those located in the fe r t i le A ra ra t valley, have seen some 
progress. A g r i c u l t u r a l exports increased f r om $220mn in 1998 t o $354 m i l l i o n in 
2001. Since 1999, ag r icu l tu ra l exports have g r ow n as a share o f exports, 
representing 14% in 200 1. L a n d titling i s almost complete (the Gove rnmen t p lans 

-45- 

t o complete i t in 2004), and about 500,000 l a n d t i t l e certificates have been i s s u e d 
t o farmers. Transactions in the land ma rke t are beginning to increase. F o r 
example, the number o f business transactions w i th ag r icu l tu ra l l a n d p lo t s 
increased f r om about 2,000 in 2001 to mo re than 4,500 during the f i r s t 8 mon ths 
o f 2003, M a n y i r r i g a t i o n systems are n o w mo re e f f ic ien t and farmers are

Armenia 's good performance means that the coun t ry has m e t a l l o f the triggers fo r

longer than expected (due m a i n l y t o changing ma rke t cond i t ions rather than lac k o f

There were n o seve re exogenous shocks ove r the p e r i o d o f the last C A S that affected the 
achievement o f those outcomes. The p r ice o f wheat c om i n g f r om Russia increased

the C A S outcomes.

p o r t f o l i o has also benefited f r om thorough analytical w o r k o n the environment, w h i c h has 
b e e n mainstreamed i n t o m a n y sectoral and capac i ty -bu i ld ing interventions, such as water 
supply and sanitation, energy, heating and i r r iga t ion . 

Capacity enhancement. The W o r l d B a n k Ins t i tu te (WBI) p rog ram was re la t ive ly 
limited. W B I has focused o n a South Caucasus reg iona l p rog ram o n f isca l 
decentralization and development o f l o c a l government capacity over the last tw o years, 
and o n PRSP dialogues among the CIS-7 countries. They have recen t ly started a t ra in ing 
p rog ram o n pens ion r e f o rm that w i l l complement the fo r thcom ing F Y 0 4 pens ion credit. 
Participants have generally ra ted the ac t iv i t ies as very successful and relevant, but asked 
that activities be broadened and made mo re continuous. 

Delivery o f products. As Tab le 4 shows, by the end o f FY04 , the p lanned lend ing 
p rog ram w i l l have b e e n delivered. The 2001 C A S p lanned 10 new investment projects 
and, by the end o f FY04 , 10 w i l l have been delivered -- eight that were p lanned in the 
C A S and t w o that were n o t envisaged. One p ro jec t (U rban Heating) has n o t yet been 
approved but the Government i s already p i l o t i n g operations under a PPF. IDA delivered 
the planned number o f AAA activities proposed in the 2001 CAS, though they covered a 
somewhat d i f fe ren t m i x o f top i c areas (see Table 5). 

The p rog ram did howeve r su f fe r f r om substantial slippage. A r o u n d h a l f o f the ac t iv i t ies 
were de l ive red at least one f i sca l year la te r than planned. Some delays resulted f r om 
decisions deliberately taken in response to changing circumstances. F o r example, the 
M u n i c i p a l Wa te r and Wastewater p ro jec t was m o v e d f r om F Y 0 2 t o F Y 0 4 because 
respons ib i l i ty f o r the sector within the Government shifted, the Bank ’s p o l i c y changed, 
and coun t ry management wan ted to assess progress implementing the M u n i c i p a l 
Deve lopmen t Project. Other delays, however, were caused by insu f f ic ien t ava i lab i l i t y o f 
key Bank s ta f f and/or s ta f f turnover. This was a pa r t icu la r p r o b l em f o r the Pub l ic Sector 
R e f o rm Project. Given the cen t ra l i ty o f im p r o v i n g p u b l i c sector management to the 2001 
CAS, de l ive r ing the re la ted p ro jec t at the end o f the FY 0 4 , rather than in F Y 0 2 as 
planned, i s an impo r tan t omission.

The w o r k o f d i f fe ren t parts o f the W o r l d B a n k G roup has been m u t u a l l y complementary, 
though IDA has dominated. The I F C has o n l y a sma l l p rog ram in Armenia, with tw o 
active projects and one fund, w h i c h has yet to be capitalized. The I F C has had d i f f i cu l t ies 
finding indus t r ia l investments o f su f f ic ien t scale and has o n l y recen t ly begun to find 
c red i two r thy banks to w h i c h i t can make s ign i f ican t l ine -o f -c red i t investments. IDA i s 
w o r k i n g w i t h MIGA o n the Fo re ign Investment and E x p o r t Fac i l i ta t ion Project, with 
MIGA lead ing the capacity building program, a l though MIGA does n o t yet have any 
active guarantees in Armenia. 

7. Aid coordination 

Over the 1990s, A rmen ia had reasonably high l e v e l s o f o f f i c i a l development assistance 
per capita at an average o f US$16 per pe rson per year o r around 11% o f GDP. IDA has 
successfully w o r k e d with donors t o m a x im i z e development impac t in m a n y areas. A 
donor consultation process was established in the C A S and f o l l ow e d up during 
implementation, inc lud ing a Consultative G roup mee t ing in FY 0 2 . 

D o n o r coo rd ina t ion has n o t b e e n w i thou t d i f f icu l t ies , however. The I C R fo r the S A T A C 
p ro jec t concluded that better donor coo rd ina t ion at the outset w o u l d have a l lowed the 
bo r rowe r to leverage mo re grant funding, a l l ow i n g IDA techn ica l assistance to be t te r 
complement that b i la te ra l support by f inanc ing the use o f l o c a l consultants. The high 
ava i lab i l i ty o f dono r funds has caused pa r t icu la r p rob lems in areas, such as pub l ic sector 
modernization, that require substantial techn ica l assistance. The Government was 
reluctant to bo r row , when considerable grant f inanc ing i s available fo r these purposes. 

Cooperation w i th the IMF has b e e n excellent. Fund cond i t iona l i t ies blended well with 
those o f IDA. The IMF p rog ram has been in l i n e with I -PRSP and n o w with the recen t ly 
published PRSP and remains b road ly o n track. 

8. Overall assessment o f CAS performance 

The team judges the C A S performance as satisfactory in those areas where IDA 
in f luenced r e s u l t s d i rec t ly . A rm e n i a made s ign i f ican t progress towards a l l o f the p lanned 
C A S outcomes and IDA p layed a s ign i f ican t r o l e in helping the coun t ry achieve resu l ts . 

A l t h o u g h r u r a l areas did n o t progress at the same rate as u rban areas, A rm e n i a has seen 
some success, and IDA was ins t rumen ta l in those successes. Furthermore the 
imp rovemen ts in the social assistance p rog rams p robab ly prevented actual worsening o f 
p o v e r t y in r u r a l areas. Given the l im i t e d resources, i t i s h a r d to assess wha t else IDA 
c o u l d have done t o he lp in the r u r a l areas. 

Progress in ra t iona l iz ing hea l th and education in f ras t ruc tu re has perhaps proceeded m o r e 
s l ow l y than envisaged. Howeve r , a stronger emphasis o n this w o u l d poss ib ly have 
detracted f r om the mo re immed ia te needs o f im p r o v i n g the qua l i t y and access to p r im a r y 
healthcare and fo res ta l l ing any further declines in the q u a l i t y o f basic education. IDA 

-52- 

was unable to help the Government fo res ta l l the g r ow t h o f p r iva te payments fo r 
healthcare, w h i c h i s a m a j o r reason that people, especially the poor, do n o t use hea l th 
services. Recent evidence, however, indicates that the pove r t y f am i l y bene f i t has 
protected the poo r and increased the p robab i l i t y that they w i l l u s e healthcare services if 
they f a l l sick. IDA did n o t help the Government develop a strategy t o tackle H I V / A I D S 
as p lanned in the 2001 CAS, because UNAIDS and the G loba l Fund led these in i t ia t ives . 

The de l ive ry schedule proposed in the 2001 C A S was ove r -op t im is t ic about s ta f f time 
ava i lab i l i ty , pa r t i cu la r l y f o r AAA w o r k . Th is meant that m a n y deliverables s l ipped one o r 
mo re f isca l years. 

9 . Lessons f o r subsequent CAS design 

(a) The areas of focus in the CAS were appropriate and the mix of interventions 
supported the objectives well. Both should be continued. Given the substantial 
progress A rmen ia has made and the contributions that the IDA p rog ram made t o that 
progress, the team concludes that IDA selected i t s goals appropriately. The ac t iv i t ies a l l 
contributed to the desired outcomes and n o activities were redundant. Given resource and 
capacity constraints b o t h in IDA and in the Government, i t i s h a r d t o see wha t add i t iona l 
activities IDA should have undertaken. The future C A S w i l l , however, n e e d t o p a y 
exp l ic i t attention to ensuring that the benefits f r om economic g r ow t h have w i d e r impact. 

(b) The best results were achieved when IDA was able to exploit the synergies 
between well-sequenced analytical work, investment and adjustment lending, and to 
leverage trust funds and donor activities. The chosen b lend o f p o l i c y based and 
investment lend ing w o r k e d we l l fo r the mos t part. Substantial levels o f t r u s t funding 
enabled the team to prepare projects and ana ly t ica l w o r k and m a i n t a i n a substantive 
dialog. Other donors also h a d a v i t a l r o l e in ach iev ing m a n y o f the C A S objectives, 
p r o v i d i n g long - te rm techn ica l assistance in areas that requ i re sustained efforts. During the 
2001 C A S p e r i o d this was pa r t i cu la r ly noticeable in the energy sector, in tax and customs 
reform, ag r icu l tu ra l extension, Treasury implementation, c i v i l service development, and 
macroeconomic and mone ta ry p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion . These in i t ia t ives w i l l need t o b e 
duplicated and perhaps i n t e n s i f i e d in the fo r thcom ing CAS . 

(c) The outcome indicators for the 2001 CAS should have been linked more clearly 
to IDA interventions to facilitate evaluation of CAS performance. Future C A S s w i l l 
endeavor to make the ind ica to rs and their baseline data c lea r ly accepted by a l l invo lved , 
the l i n k s to the interventions mo re e x p l i c i t and to use the ind ica to rs as a management t o o l 
throughout C A S implementation. 

(d) Devolving responsibility for portfolio management to the country manager and 
some task management responsibilities to country office staff improved portfolio 
performance considerably. The coun t ry manager and field o f f i c e s t a f f are close t o the 
projects and the counterparts. F o r that reason, and because they w o r k exc lus ive ly o n 
A rmen ia rather than o n several countries, they we re able t o focus o n the A rm e n i a 

-53 - 

p o r t f o l i o and remove obstacles to progress and highlight po ten t ia l problems be fo re they 
materialized. 

(e) A strong team in the country office was impo r tan t fo r achieving results. High 
caliber s ta f f w o r k i n g as a mu l t i -sec to ra l team in Yerevan, w i t h some respons ib i l i ty fo r 
task management, helped p rov ide e f f ic ien t qua l i t y services t o the c l ien t and to ma in ta in a 
good d ia log w i t h senior o f f ic ia ls . Future w o r k should b e des igned t o bene f i t f r om th is 
team as m u c h as possible 

( f ) T h e CAS was no t realistic enough about staff ava i lab i l i ty a n d p rog ramm ing . 
M a n y o f the interventions p rog rammed in the p rev ious C A S were de l ive red one o r tw o 
f isca l years behind schedule, although the to ta l numbe r o f ac t iv i t ies and lending vo lume 
remained r o u g h l y as planned. M a n y factors caused this, some n o t within the con t ro l o f 
coun t ry team members. In some cases, however, slippage was the resu l t o f key s ta f f n o t 
being available at the right time. During preparation and imp lemen ta t ion o f the future 
CAS, management needs to pay exp l ic i t attention to advance s ta f f p lann ing t o ensu re that 
k e y people are available at the right time f o r k e y deliverables. 

(g) I n a country experiencing r a p i d economic growth, i t i s difficult to ensure tha t a l l 
geographic areas and segments o f the popu la t ion bene f i t equally. Clearly, some parts 
o f the coun t ry have progressed faster than others, but i t i s far f r om clear what c o u l d have 
b e e n done to avo id that, Indeed, w i thou t the improvements in social assistance programs, 
the s i tua t ion in lagg ing regions w o u l d p robab ly have b e e n even worse. 

(h) Know ledge and capacity gaps rema in . A l t h o u g h IDA ’S in te rven t ions together with 
those o f other donors were reasonably e f fec t ive in addressing capacity issues , m u c h 
remains to be done. A rm e n i a cou ld p robab ly have bene f i ted f r om an expanded W o r l d 
B a n k Institute (WBI) p rog ram fo r this purpose. The p r im a r y know ledge gaps relate t o 
constraints t o increasing on- and o f f - f a rm incomes in r u r a l areas, and to the dynamics o f 
the labo r ma rke t (this was identified in the p rev ious CAS , b u t dropped because o f s ta f f 
ava i lab i l i ty ) . The latter w o u l d help IDA understand gender i s s u e s in the labo r force. IDA 
w i l l tackle these i s s u e s in the nex t C A S pe r iod . 

(i) T h e CAS consultation process was extensive and coincided la rge ly w i th the even 
mo re thorough government-led consultation process fo r the PRSP. The Government 
has comm i t ted to continue consultations throughout PRSP implementation, and IDA w i l l 
b e pa r t o f that process. Therefore, consultations o n fu tu re CAS s can b e n e f i t f r om the 
PRSP consultations, can b e mo re focused, and consider h o w IDA can best support the 
Government’s PRSP p r io r i t ies .

WB I activities fo r A rm e n i a cu r ren t ly implemented o r p lanned f o r m pa r t o f the broader

Annex 5: Core Labor Standards 

1. 

The Right of Association. The Cons t i tu t ion p rov ides employees w i t h the r i g h t to f o rm and 
j o i n trade unions, a l though i t stipulates that the right t o f o rm associations, inc lud ing p o l i t i c a l parties 
and trade unions, m a y be l im i t e d fo r those persons s e r v i n g in the armed services and l a w enforcement 
agencies. In practice, labo r organization remained weak because o f high unemployment and the weak 
economy. The absence o f active unions and o f accurate employment data precluded a re l iab le 
estimate o f the percentage o f the wo rk fo rce that i s unionized. Un ions are f ree to a f f i l ia te w i t h 
in te rna t iona l organizations; however, none h a d done so to date. 

2. 
Labor Rights. A l t h o u g h the l a w provides fo r the right to organize and ba rga in co l lec t ive ly , 
co l lec t ive ba rga in ing does n o t occur in practice. Fac to ry directorates generally se t the p a y scales 
w i thou t consu l ta t ion w i t h employees. Labo r disputes are arbitrated in regular o r economic courts. 
The Cons t i tu t ion p rov ides f o r the right t o s t r ike ; however, wo rke rs h a d ne i the r the f inanc ia l resources 
t o ma in ta in a s t r i k e n o r enforceable lega l p ro tec t ion against retaliation, and ex is t ing un ions p l a y a 
re la t ive ly passive role. The standard lega l wo rkweek was 40 hours; however, m a n y persons w o r k 
multiple j o b s in order to p rov ide fo r basic necessities. The l a w p rov ides fo r annual and s ick leave; 
however, there we re n o mandated r e s t periods. Compensation f o r ove r t ime w o r k i s required; the 
amount depends o n the p o s i t i o n and type o f employment. 

3 . 
Forced, Bonded and Child Labor. The Cons t i tu t ion and the l aw p r o h i b i t forced and bonded 
labor, i n c l u d i n g by children, and the re have been n o reports that such practices occur. A c c o r d i n g t o

l o c a l commun i ty councils, unemployment offices, and, as a f i n a l boa rd o f appeal, the courts. The 
Government has n o t r a t i f i e d I L O Conven t ion 182 o n the wo rs t fo rms o f c h i l d labor. 

4. 

Trafficking in Persons. A rmen ia i s a coun t ry o f o r i g i n f o r in te rna t iona l t r a f f i c k i n g o f girls

n o t yet c om p l y with the minimum standards fo r the e l im ina t ion o f t ra f f ic k ing . In 2003, however, t h e 
A rmen ian Government acknowledged the need fo r increased ac t ion against t ra f f ic k ing , and has 
focused mo re l a w enforcement resources o n the p rob lem . A n e w inter-agency task force has 
coordinated p u b l i c awareness efforts throughout the country, i n c l u d i n g pamph le t d is t r ibu t ion at the 
borders. The Government’s Refugee and M i g r a t i o n Service inc luded i n f o rm a t i o n o n t r a f f i c k i n g in an 
ed i t ion o f i t s j o u r n a l o n lega l migration, and houses an IOM - f u n d e d M i g r a t i o n Service P o i n t with a 
hotline, a l l ow i n g people t o c a l l o r come in t o ask about m i g r a t i o n issues , i n c l u d i n g t ra f f ic k ing . The 
O f f i c e advertises the h o t l i n e in newspapers. In April 2003, A rm e n i a amended i t s c r im i n a l code t o 
inc lude a specific c r im i n a l p r o h i b i t i o n against t r a f f i c k i n g f o r sexual exp lo i ta t ion . Be fo re then,

personal documents, extortion, bogus marriages and divorces, and coe rc ion i n t o sexual intercourse. 
The Government has ins t i tu ted an t i -co r rup t ion e f fo r ts in the Customs Comm i t tee and upgraded the 
technology at the borders t o combat t ra f f ick ing . In 2002, 26 c r im i n a l cases were b rough t against
