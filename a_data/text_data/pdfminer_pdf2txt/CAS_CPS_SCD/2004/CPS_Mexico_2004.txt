MEMORANDUM 

OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION 

TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP 
W ITH THE UN ITED MEXICAN STATES 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

11. 

.. 

M e x i c o has undertaken impressive re fo rms since the 1994 crisis, lead ing t o a m a j o r 
economic and p o l i t i c a l transformation in the last decade. Today, the coun t ry enjoys a mo re 
open economic and p o l i t i c a l system, i s m o r e integrated i n t o the w o r l d economy, belongs t o 
the OECD , has investment grade in the f inanc ia l markets and has strong ownership o f i t s 
development strategy. Yet, and n o t detracting f r om these achievements but rather p o i n t i n g t o 
the long - te rm nature o f development, there i s s t i l l a substantial agenda that the government 
seeks t o advance within the context o f i t s N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan, i n c l u d i n g very 
im p o r t a n t l y p o v e r t y reduction, im p r o v e d competitiveness, environmental management and 
ins t i tu t iona l change. 
So h o w does the B a n k support a coun t ry with M e x i c o ’ s characteristics? This i s n o t an 
easy question g i v e n the Bank’s re la t ive ly sma l l we igh t in cove r ing the country’s f inanc ia l 
needs, the non -add i t iona l i ty o f B a n k loans f o r the sector m in is t r ies , and the need t o customize 
Bank assistance t o a c red i two r thy m idd le - income bo r rowe r . In some ways, such a strategy 
shou ld n o t be different than that f o r other c l ien ts where the Bank also supports pove r ty 
alleviation, coun t ry ownership and a long - te rm v is ion . But f o r a coun t ry l i k e Mex ico , the 
Bank needs t o customize i t s support by adapting t o a sophisticated bo r rowe r and m a k i n g sure 
the B a n k i s pa r t icu la r ly compe t i t ive in the instruments w e offer, given the m a n y options 
available f o r a coun t ry with investment grade and a s ign i f ican t IBRD lend ing program. 
iii. In this CPS, i t i s proposed in partnership with the government o f M e x i c o t o address 
this challenge in three ways: (a) focus w o r k o n selected areas where t h e B a n k can bring va lue 
added expertise and qua l i ty support t o M e x i c o w h i l e b e i n g mo re selective in i n i t i a t i n g the 
(b) use p rog ramma t ic analytic w o r k and 
p repa ra t ion o f 
lend ing operations; 
l e a r n i n g h o w l e d g e sharing activities to he lp answer, debate and reach consensus around the 
m a i n unanswered questions in selected areas (such as poverty, water, competitiveness, qua l i ty 
o f education and decentralization); and (c) b e f l e x i b l e t o respond t o w indows o f opportunities 
w h i c h m a y arise during the CPS p e r i o d (e.g. subnational lending) and ready t o p rov ide 
f inanc ia l resources tak ing advantage o f WBG’s f inanc ia l products that best suit Mex ico ’s 
needs. 
iv . 
M e x i c o i s in the m i d s t o f b o t h a p o l i t i c a l and an economic transition, b o t h o f w h i c h 
are i n t r i n s i c a l l y inter-connected and p r o v i n g m o r e cha l leng ing than o r i g i n a l l y anticipated. 
The p o l i t i c a l system i s in a process o f renewa l and democratization-the 
e lec t ion o f President 
F o x in Ju ly 2000 ma rked an impo r tan t sh i f t towards democracy and a mu l t i -pa r ty system.

hierarchical-corporatist system that w o r k e d f o r seven decades and made p o l i c y m a k i n g 
re la t ive ly straight fo rwa rd . Today p o l i c y m a k i n g i s m u c h mo re complex, with the r i s e o f 
p l u r a l i sm at the federal level, the dec l ine o f Presidentialism, and the rising importance o f 
l o c a l governments 
f o r social and economic 
development. 
v. 
The economic t rans i t ion i s also p r o v i n g mo re d i f f i c u l t than w o u l d have been expected 
a decade ago, when after the B rady -p lan reduc t ion o f debt and NAFTA i t l o o k e d as i f v i c t o r y 
c o u l d be declared. D e b t management has been extremely successful and the B r a d y bonds 
were p a i d 16 years ahead o f t im e in 2003. But the need to keep the budge t in con t ro l and the 
l o w tax e f fo r t has meant that in f ras t ruc tu re needs are ex t reme ly high and g row ing . The 
legacy o f the 1994/95 c r is is remains with Mex ico , with pove r ty leve ls o n l y n o w recove r ing t o 
ea r ly 1990 levels. And after 10 years, the i n i t i a l economic advantages o f NAFTA are being 
offset by increasing g loba l competition, with Ch ina d isp lac ing M e x i c o as the second t rad ing 
partner o f the U S in late 2003. 
vi. 
H o w are these transitions linked t o pove r ty reduction? A l t h o u g h M e x i c o has made 
impo r tan t gains in hea l th and education, l o w and inequitable g r ow t h has kep t income pove r ty 
high. Imp roved economic g r ow t h i s constrained by l o w levels o f human capital, inadequate 
infrastructure and weak ins t i tu t ions (inadequate competition, p rope r ty rights, p r iva te sector 
f i r m s s t i l l emerging f r om a h is to ry o f rent-seeking). M e x i c o also faces s ign i f ican t 
env i ronmen ta l degradation and wa te r scarcity w h i c h c o u l d threaten growth, social we l fa re and 
pove r ty alleviation. Solutions to these problems are interconnected and requ i re deep 
ins t i tu t iona l change within government and state-society interactions. The competitiveness 
agenda i s c ruc ia l t o p o v e r t y dynamics v i a j o b creation. And the ins t i tu t iona l agenda i s 
fundamental f o r competitiveness (the j u d i c i a l system f o r example), 
f o r environmental 
management and to imp rove basic services t o the poo r . 
vii. 
T a k i n g i n t o account th is r i c h and complex se t o f challenges, the WBG w i l l w o r k in 
mu l t isec to r clusters t o adapt t o these inter-related issues building o n i t s strong partnership 
with government counterparts and w o r k i n g to adopt coun t ry processes in procurement, 
f inanc ia l management and safeguards. W e w i l l u s e the bes t o f ou r new lending instruments, 
i n c l u d i n g SWAPS, repeater projects and f inanc ia l products. These w i l l b e complemented by 
ana ly t ica l w o r k and by WB I lea rn ing and capacity building programs, w h i c h w i l l b e c lose ly 
integrated with the coun t ry program. IFC ’ s p rog ram w o u l d con t inue to support e f fo r ts to: (a) 
enhance competitiveness o f the p r iva te sector; (b) h r t h e r deepen the f inanc ia l sector; (c) 
p romo te investments in areas newly opened fo r p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion ; (d) encourage 
sustainable social and env i ronmen ta l development; and (e) p romo te g o o d corporate 
governance. I F C w i l l imp lemen t this strategy through: (a) d i rec t f inanc ing f o r la rge r clients to 
w h o m I F C can p rov ide otherwise unava i lab le long - te rm f inanc ing and best p rac t ice exper t ise ; 
(b) f inanc ing th rough intermediaries t o reach sma l l enterprises; and (c) targeted f inanc ing t o 
sma l l projects expected t o have a high impac t and a good p r o b a b i l i t y o f success. 
v i i i . 
The SHCP and the B a n k have agreed to w o r k in partnership during this CPS pe r iod 
(FY05-08) t o implement a lend ing p rog ram that bes t addresses Mex ico ’s development needs 
as a c red i two r thy m idd le - income coun t ry and enhances the Bank’s a b i l i t y to respond q u i c k l y 
t o changing circumstances. A lending range o f US$O.8 t o US$1.7 b i l l i o n a year i s proposed 
in order to p romo te the country’s key development objectives supported th rough this CPS. 
The proposed lend ing range i s consistent w i t h ca re fu l risk management, in view o f the 
government’s sound macroeconomic policies, i t s prudent debt management strategy, and the 

2 

p ro jec ted evo lu t ion o f B a n k exposure. In the event o f any s ign i f ican t changes in the proposed 
program, we w o u l d return t o the Boa rd with a CPS Progress Report. 
i x . 
The proposed strategy faces r i s k s such as Congressional paralysis t o imp lemen t 
re fo rms and the po ten t ia l occurrence o f external shocks (such as a down tu rn in o i l prices, a 
stalled U S recovery, o r con tag ion f r om shocks in other markets). There i s also the r i s k that 
mo re se lec t iv i ty in B a n k operations makes the lending p rog ram m o r e sensitive t o some 
operations being dropped. Howeve r , the focus o f the CPS heeds the lessons learned during 
the last decade and the imp lemen ta t ion o f the proposed p rog ram has b e e n designed with the 
management o f these r i s k s in mind. 
B o a r d members m a y wish t o discuss the f o l l ow i n g aspects o f the CPS: 
0 The proposed strategy to u s e programmatic assistance, organize thematic support 
groups and inco rpo ra te f l e x i b i l i t y in the lending program; and 
0 The p roposa l t o m o v e to coun t ry sys tems in procurement, f inanc ia l management 
and safeguards during the CPS pe r iod .

April 2602. 

The last Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r M e x i c o was p resen ted to the B o a r d in

country’s 2001 -2006 Na t iona l Deve lopmen t P l a n presented by the then new adm in is t ra t ion o f 
President Fox . In add i t ion t o a comprehensive p rog ram o f lending and non - lend ing services, 
the p rog ram inc luded operations to support government re fo rms in pensions, finance, 
decentralization and infrastructure that have n o t yet been implemented due t o lack o f 
leg is la t ive support-no 
single p o l i t i c a l p a r t y has a m a j o r i t y in Congress.

Consistent with Mex ico ’s status as a m a j o r m idd le - income coun t ry and O E C D 
member, as well as t o rea l ign the Bank ’s support to the government’s p r io r i t ies f o r the 
remainder o f President Fox ’s te rm , the government and the Bank have agreed t o imp lemen t in 
partnership a n e w CPS to cover f isca l years 2005 th rough 2008, go ing i n t o the beg inn ing o f 
the next p res iden t ia l term. This CPS proposes a selective p rog ram o f IBRD and I F C 
operations and a strategic p rog ram o f ana ly t ica l and lea rn ing services t o be p r o v i d e d by the 
WBG, a l l built u p o n f o u r strategic p i l la rs t o support Mex ico ’s e f fo r ts to: (a) reduce p o v e r t y 
and inequa l i ty ; (b) increase competitiveness; (c) strengthen institutions; and (d) p romo te

The p o l i t i c a l system i s g o i n g th rough a process o f renewa l and

been a peace fb l and smooth process rece iv ing widespread recogn i t ion at home and abroad. 
On the other hand, the r ise o f p l u r a l i sm at the federal l e v e l and the increasing interest 
in the social and economic development agendas at subnational levels have hampered the 
administration’s amb i t ious r e f o rm agenda. Because n o p a r t y ho lds a m a j o r i t y in either house 
o f Congress, the executive has h a d v e r y limited success securing leg is la t ive app rova l o n i t s

preferences as n o single p o l i t i c a l pa r ty obtained a ma jo r i ty . A l l three m a j o r p o l i t i c a l parties 
n o w stand a reasonable chance t o win the nex t p res iden t ia l election. W h i l e there s t i l l m a y b e 
a w i n d ow o f oppo r tun i ty to build consensus t o pass some reforms, recent e f fo r ts o n m u c h

The full imp lemen ta t ion o f the government’s r e f o rm agenda i s expected to increase 
po ten t ia l output g r ow t h by about t w o percentage po in ts due to h ighe r p u b l i c and p r iva te 
investment as well as improvements in p r o d u c t i v i t y g row th . Given the current state o f the

m a j o r reforms, i s unlikely t o b e su f f ic ien t t o make noticeable progress in the reduc t ion o f

Average annual rea l GDP g r ow t h in M e x i c o over the 2001-2003 p e r i o d has been a 
lackluster 0.6 percent. The s lowdown o f the U .S . economy in 2001 and i t s hesitant recove ry 
reduced demand f o r M e x i c a n n o n - o i l exports. In addition, the reduc t ion o f ma rke t share o f 
M e x i c a n n o n - o i l exports to the U n i t e d States f r om 11.4 percent in 2001 t o 10.7 percent in 
2003 suggests that M e x i c o m a y b e l o s i n g ou t t o compe t i t ive pressures f r om abroad. Expo r ts 
o f manufactured goods, w h i c h h a d quadrupled ove r the p rev ious decade, have stagnated at 
about U S $ 141 b i l l i o n annua l ly ove r the past t h r e e years and are about 3 percent l ow e r than 
the i r h is to r ic high in 2000. F ina l ly , a sharp con t rac t ion o f p r iva te investment, attributable to 
g loba l economic uncertainties and lack o f domestic structural reforms, generated a 
deceleration o f domestic demand and con t r ibu ted t o the weak output g r ow t h performance.

Mex ico ’s external accounts do n o t pose a risk t o macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . The

over the past two years t o about 2 percent o f GDP as a resu l t o f strong o i l export revenue,

progress o n economic reforms. While depreciation m a y i n i t i a l l y compensate fo r pa r t o f the

POVERTY: PROFILE AND TRENDS 

14. 
Pove r ty in M e x i c o remains widespread. The 2000 o f f i c i a l pove r ty numbers ind ica te 
that about 53 percent o f i t s popu la t ion was su f fe r ing f r om income -pove r ty (defined as h a v i n g 
a l e v 4 o f p e r capita consump t ion b e l ow wha t i s needed to m e e t basic f o o d and n o n - f o o d 
needs), and close t o 2 4 percent was ex t reme ly p o o r (below wha t i s required to mee t basic f o o d 
needs f o r adequate nutrition). ' In 2000, 12.6 percent o f the urban popu la t ion and 42.4 percent 
o f the r u r a l popu la t ion was extremely poor.* P re l im ina ry government estimates f o r 2002 
indicate a sma l l decline in the b road conception o f p o v e r t y to about 52 percent and a 
s ign i f ican t f a l l in extreme pove r ty t o 2 0 percent. 11 percent o f the u rban popu la t ion and 35 
percent o f the r u r a l popu la t ion was ex t reme ly poo r . In t e r m s o f aggregate numbers, mos t o f 
the p o o r l i v e in u rban areas, yet p o v e r t y in r u r a l areas i s m o r e severe. 
15. 
There has been a s low long - run progress in the reduc t ion o f income poverty, ove r la id 
with a dramatic impac t o f the 1994-95 economic crisis. Howeve r , achievements have b e e n 
imbalanced with impo r tan t gains in hea l th and education and lack o f progress in income 
poverty. Subsequent t o the crisis, the re i s a divergent re la t ionsh ip be tween pove r ty dynamics 
and na t iona l income g r ow t h in d i f fe ren t periods. F r o m 1996-2000, the economy grew at 5.5 
percent p e r annum, but pove r ty f e l l s low ly . In 2000, a l though mean income per capita h a d 
increased 11 percent in rea l terms compared t o 1994, p o v e r t y h a d n o t recovered t o p re -c r is is 
leve ls , and u n s k i l l e d wages h a d decreased by 2 2 percent in rea l terms. The share o f the 
popu la t ion in extreme pove r ty in 2000 was s t i l l above the p re -c r is is l e v e l o f 1994 by fou r 
percentage po in ts in r u r a l areas, and by three percentage po in ts in u rban areas. By contrast, in 
the 2000-2002 period, despite a f a l l in per capita income o f ove r 2 percent, pove r ty declined, 
with the 4 percent dec l ine in ex t reme pove r ty o f pa r t icu la r note. P re l im ina ry analysis by the 
government finds that this was due t o an equa l iz ing pa t te rn o f income growth-heavily 
in f luenced by transfers, remittances, and g r ow t h in l o w s k i l l e d wages-in 
this period, with 
s ign i f ican t g r ow t h f o r the b o t t om deciles and a substantial dec l ine f o r the top decile. 
16. 
Desp i te this decline in poverty, ach iev ing the MDGs w i l l r em a i n a challenge in 
M e x i c o . Assuming n o change in income d is t r ibu t ion and with an average yea r ly g r ow t h rate 
o f 3.5 percent GDP per capita, M e x i c o i s unlikely t o meet the goa l o f reduc ing extreme 
pove r ty by h a l f by the year 2015 (see Table 2). To d o so, i t i s estimated that M e x i c o needs a 
sustained g r ow t h ra te o f at least 5 percent, w h i c h has n o t happened since the 1970's. M e x i c o 
i s also unlikely t o reduce unde r - f ive m o r t a l i t y by two - th i rds and ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y by three 
quarters. Howeve r , i t i s likely t o achieve un ive rsa l p r im a r y education, the e l im i n a t i o n o f 
gender d ispa r i ty in a l l levels o f education, and the reversal o f the spread o f H I V / A I D S . 
Moreover, in the recent past, income g r ow t h o f the extreme poor, especially in r u r a l areas, has 
been l ow e r than the average so specific e f fo r ts w i l l be needed t o reach the mos t disadvantaged 
groups o f the society in order t o enable them t o catch up with the rest o f the popu la t ion . 

' SEDESOL works with three poverty lines: food-based poverty, based on estimated food requirements to provide adequate 
nutrition assuming consumption pattems o f the poor; plus two higher l i n e s that respectively add requirements for education 
and health, and for clothes, housing and transport. T h e first (extreme poverty) and third (poverty) l i n e s are quoted here.

REDUCE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY 

20. 
As already in t roduced in the p r o f i l e and trends section, pove r ty in M e x i c o remains 
widespread and suffers f r om fou r persistent characteristics: (a) a l though reduced, absolute 
pove r ty (be low SEDESOL ’s asset p o v e r t y l ine ) numbers rema in unacceptably high (some 5 1 
m i l l i o n Mex icans are s t i l l poor); (b) the re i s sharp inequa l i ty in the d is t r ibu t ion o f income, 
w h i c h has been res i l ien t to p o l i c y interventions; (c) the incidence o f extreme pove r ty in r u r a l 
areas i s abno rma l ly acute (in 2000, 42 percent o f the r u r a l popu la t ion lived in extreme 
poverty); and (d) there s t i l l i s w i d e development gap be tween the Sou th and the r e s t o f 
M e x i c o (southerners are far poorer, less educated, less l i k e l y t o have running water, and mo re 
l i k e l y t o die younger). At the s am e time, u rban pove r ty remains a challenge, w h i c h requires 
n ew approaches beyond the r u r a l focus o f mos t p rev ious interventions. These characteristics 
gather add i t iona l u rgency w h e n seen in the light o f the available emp loymen t opportunities 
f o r the poor-while unemp loymen t has remained low , some 1.5 m i l l i o n new j o b s are needed 
each year just t o accommodate new entrants i n t o the labo r force. At the peak o f i t s recent 
g r ow t h performance, the M e x i c a n economy managed t o create o n l y about 600,000 f o rm a l

I n c o m e Dynam ics . Reduc ing income p o v e r t y depends p r im a r i l y o n the expansion o f 
labo r incomes-in 
f o rm a l sector jobs, in the i n f o rm a l sector, and in the r u r a l ag r icu l tu ra l and

There i s a complementary agenda o f im p r o v i n g the investment

23. 
Soc ia l P ro tec t ion . The social security system covers o n l y 1 in every 5 o f the u rban 
elderly population, and o n l y 2 percent o f the t o t a l poo r . In social insurance, the pens ion

use o f selected education, health, and nu t r i t iona l services. Yet, impo r tan t gaps in the soc ia l 
p ro tec t ion system remain, pa r t icu la r ly among the r u r a l p o o r w i t h o u t access to hea l th and 
education services and the u rban p o o r to w h i c h p rog rams such as O POR TUN ID AD E S have

24. 
Edu c a t ion . The p o o r have bene f i ted f r om centralized outreach programs designed t o

un ive rsa l access t o p r im a r y education and secondary en ro l lmen t i s high and continues t o 
increase. P u b l i c spending in higher education, however, continues to be highly regressive and 
access by the p o o r remains a challenge. Mo reove r , w h i l e coverage has increased in basic 
education, the ou t -o f -schoo l adult popu la t ion w i t h o u t secondary education remains a 
challenge, requiring greater emphasis o n non - fo rma l education in order t o respond t o the 

10 

demands o f a mode rn iz ing economy. Such demands are also p lac ing a p r em i um o n the 
qua l i ty in education, where the system in general lags. A systemic e f fo r t w o u l d requ i re g o i n g 
beyond the centralized approach and invo lves decentralized governments, w h o are responsible 
f o r basic education services, and co l labo ra t ion with commun i t ies and teachers.

Health. M e x i c o has used centralized ins t i tu t ions and ve r t ica l p rog rams t o con t ro l

p r o v i s i o n o f services in ma rg ina l r u r a l areas. This has helped bring about impo r tan t advances 
with l ow e r i n f a n t mo r ta l i ty , higher vacc ina t ion rates, and higher l i f e expectancy. These and 
other factors have begun t o change the country’s ep idem io log ica l p ro f i le , and n o w ch ron ic

Excluded Groups. The challenge o f human cap i ta l fo rma t ion i s pa r t icu la r ly d i f f i c u l t 
f o r three, ove r lapp ing social groups-women, 
indigenous populations, and the r u r a l poo r . 
Longs tand ing demands-regional, 
rural, indigenous-have 
been he igh tened by the p o l i t i c a l 
opening, the p o o r g r ow t h performance and in te rna t iona l integration. Soc ia l ly ascribed gender 
ro les have p laced w om e n at a clear disadvantage in terms o f hea l th (especially rep roduc t ive 
health), labor, and personal safety. S im i la r ly , about 1 in 10 Mex icans defines h im s e l f o r

trusted ove r those dictated by the country’s laws, soc ia l organization i s based o n prestige and 
c i v i c duty, and the language o f preference (and f requen t ly the o n l y language) i s n o t Spanish. 
These ove r lapp ing groups, themselves, are concentrated in the southern States, w h i c h under- 
p e r f o rm the rest o f the nation, spec i f ica l ly in the areas o f education, hea l th and the p r o v i s i o n 
o f basic services. In 2000, access t o piped wa te r was 2 0 percent b e l ow the na t iona l average, 
en ro l lmen t o f school age popu la t ion was 10 percent less, and deaths per 1,000 births averaged 
5.4 mo re than na t iona l ly . In order t o “catch up” with the nation, these States must address 
challenges re la ted t o l o w income per capita, sma l lhemo te localities, and large p ropo r t ions o f

the need f o r add i t iona l resources t o m o v e f o rw a r d at a faster pace.

La rge numbers o f people are w i thou t access t o basic 
in f ras t ruc tu re services, unde rm in ing e f fo r ts at human cap i ta l development: 13.2 m i l l i o n 
w i t h o u t piped water, 23.7 m i l l i o n w i t h o u t sanitary drainage, and 5.4 m i l l i o n w i t h o u t

Housing. M e x i c o has a large hous ing deficit, cu r ren t ly estimated at 4 m i l l i o n units, 
w h i c h i s worsening due t o the r a p i d l y g r ow i n g demand (700,000 new households are fo rmed 
each year) and l im i ta t ions o n funding ava i lab i l i ty . Currently, ove r 40 percent o f Mex icans

insecu r i ty o f tenure and, in m a n y cases, situated in areas at r i s k f o r na tu ra l disasters (68 
percent o f people affected by na tu ra l disasters are poor). Despite progress in f inanc ia l sector 
re fo rms i n c l u d i n g recent substantial enhancement o f secured lending regulations, the hous ing 
market s t i l l faces p rob lems o f dys func t iona l l a n d markets, w h i c h also h inde r e f f ic ien t 
ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion in r u r a l areas. F ina l ly , o n l y 20 percent o f u rban Mex icans and even 
fewer r u r a l ones have access t o f inanc ia l services, limiting the i r a b i l i t y t o save, inves t and 
manage risks. At year-end 2002, the to ta l mortgage debt represented 3.1 percent o f GDP, 
compared to 12, 15, and 68 percent f o r Colombia, C h i l e and the U.S., respectively. In u rban 
areas e f fec t ive programs have yet t o be tested and w i l l requ i re a greater r o l e by mun ic ipa l i t ies 
and ove ra l l re fo rms in factors markets. The ma rke t i s very segmented with banks p r o v i d i n g

m i d d l e income hous ing segment. Past experience in r u r a l areas suggests that th is w i l l n o t be 
an easy task. 
Increased spending alone w i l l n o t bring sustained changes w i t h o u t 
improvements in hous ing and land markets, in access to f inanc ia l services, and in l o c a l 
government capacity and accountability.

STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONS 

39. Over the past 15 years, m u l t i p a r t y p o l i t i c a l compe t i t ion at a l l 3 levels o f government 
has activated a democratic federal system, rep lac ing the single party system that h a d been in 
p lace €or decades. M a k i n g the n ew system fully operational, however, requires fu r the r 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms. The present administration, l i k e the previous, seeks t o leave an 
ins t i tu t iona l legacy o f transparency, accountability, and federalism that w i l l h inde r prospects 
o f future p o l i t i c a l monopolies. The external open ing o f the economy makes ins t i tu t iona l 
strengthening m o r e urgent, because good ins t i tu t iona l software seems to be the mos t 
impo r tan t con t r ibu to r to sustained competitiveness and per-capita income g row th . Also, the 
economic open ing makes ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm less vulnerable to reversal, as the bene f i ts o f 
in te rna t iona l linkages increase the numbers o f peop le favo r ing the be t te r ins t i tu t ions that 
make M e x i c o m o r e competitive. While the theme o f ins t i tu t iona l strengthening c o u l d touch 
o n mos t o f M e x i c o ’ s development challenges, the discussion he re focuses o n wha t c o u l d 
rea l is t ica l ly b e undertaken and o n wha t i s n o t covered elsewhere in the CPS.

Civil Soc ie ty and Inclusion. Democ racy in Mex ico , t rad i t iona l ly operated th rough 
corporatist channels i n t o a single party, n o w rightly takes p lace th rough m u l t i - p a r t y 
compe t i t ion . Today, people have the o p t i o n t o b e heard th rough c i v i l organizations 
independent o f parties, corporatist organizations (unions, chambers o f commerce, etc.) and the 
government. 
I t i s pa r t icu la r ly impo r tan t f o r vulnerable groups, l i k e indigenous peoples, 
w om e n and youth, t o also have established ins t i tu t iona l channels f o r expressing c i v i l society 
views. Mex ico ’s pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion w i l l bene f i t by hav ing mo re e f f ic ien t f l ow s o f 
i n f o rm a t i o n in b o t h directions between dec is ion -mak ing levels and those in contact with 
stakeholders, by building in te rna l cohesion around clear objectives and shared strategies f o r 
change, and by creating mechanisms f o r open exchanges o f ideas among o f f ic ia ls at various 
levels and in different agencies concerned with the same issues . 
Transparency and Anticorruption. The government has advanced m a n y re fo rms t o 
im p r o v e transparency and reduce corruption, especially in the customs and procurement areas. 
Howeve r , progress regarding government procurement i s uneven. 
In mos t agencies 
procurement p rac t ice s t i l l emphasizes f o l l ow i n g comp lex procedures rather than ge t t ing the 
best value fo r m o n e y f o r the p u b l i c sector. One o f the actions to imp rove transparency was t o 
open t o c i v i l society the m o n i t o r i n g o f government procurement processes f o r v e r y large 
contracts. Ano the r impo r tan t ac t ion was the c rea t ion o f the Federal Ins t i tu te t o Access 
I n f o rm a t i o n (IFAI) and the enactment o f the n ew l a w that makes disclosure o f ce r ta in 
i n f o rm a t i o n mandatory. A m a j o r imp rovemen t in procurement processes was in t roduced with 
the electronic procurement p o r t a l (COMPRANET ) that a l lows f o r electronic management o f 
bidding processes-the 
nex t generation o f C OM P R A N E T w i l l also inc lude shopping- 
a l though the system i s n o t yet used at the State leve l . Likewise, f inanc ia l management i s 
strong in some areas, but weak in others, again leav ing too many opportunities f o r corruption. 
M o r e and mo re government agencies have been m a k i n g i n f o rm a t i o n pub l ic , but the qua l i ty 
and coverage are uneven and until recen t ly peop le h a d l i t t l e chance to dig deeper with any 
inquiry. L o c a l services networks, one stop service centers, service quality, s im p l i f i e d 
procedures, computer-based systems, automated con t ro ls and proper audit t ra i ls need further 
development in order to p rov ide higher q u a l i t y o f services as we l l as accurate and t im e l y 
i n f o rm a t i o n to Mex ico ’s citizens.

raise revenue, as w e l l as o f spending t o better allocate resources t o na t ion -w ide p r io r i t ies . 
Congressional mandates and past concessions t o special i n t e r e s t s have put so m a n y rigidities 
in the budget that adjustments t o revenue shortfalls o r changing p r io r i t ies tend t o affect the 
mos t flexible pa r t o f p u b l i c spending, investment; and VAT and income tax bases rema in too 
narrow, with too m a n y exemptions. 
44. 
In t e rgo v e rnm en t a l F i s c a l Re la t ions . The 1990s witnessed m a j o r expansions in the 
transfers and spending respons ib i l i t ies f o r the subnational governments, but federalism needs 
hrther r e f o rm t o complete the transformations unde rway t o achieve the outcomes desired. 
A l t h o u g h a l o t o f money n o w f l ow s th rough State coffers (mos t ly t o p a y teachers and hea l th 
workers), n o t a l l leve ls o f government have ownership o f the decentralization process, as 
unclear roles, strong links be tween un ions and the i r federal sector m in is t r ies , and lack o f 
p o l i t i c a l w i l l by State governments lead t o ine f fec t ive management o f k e y p u b l i c services. 
States also lack substantive tax bases, and the development bank B A N O B R A S has to

45. 
S t reng then ing C a p a c i t y o f SNG. A l o n g with the SNGs’ p rob lems o f inadequate

PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 

47. 
M e x i c o today faces tremendous pressure o n i t s na tu ra l environment. 
Ava i lab le 
i n f o rm a t i o n o n Mex ico ’s environmental status suggests that severe degradation has taken 
p lace in a numbe r o f sectors-to 
the p o i n t whe re fa i lu re to reverse some o f the mos t 
damaging env i ronmen ta l trends c o u l d n o t o n l y act as a b rake o n con t inued g r ow t h but in some 
cases con t r ibu te d i r e c t l y to reduced social we l fa re and increased pove r ty . During the 1990s, 
env i ronmen ta l deterioration was estimated at a round 10 percent o f GDP. App rox ima te ly 90 
percent was due t o env i ronmen ta l degradation (mos t ly po l lu t ion ) f r om economic activities; 10 
percent represented na tu ra l resource depletion. Given the magn i tude o f M e x i c o ’ s 
env i ronmen ta l challenges and the re la t ive ly short time that has passed since i t began t o 
fo rmu la te a comprehensive response, the re remains a considerable unfinished agenda t o 
imp rove the environment over the nex t decade. 
48. 
Environmental Governance. Since the m i d - l 9 9 0 s , decentralization has become a 
k e y p o l i c y p r i o r i t y . The General L a w o n Eco log ica l Ba lance and Env i ronmen ta l Protection- 
the ove ra rch ing Fede ra l environmental law-and 
other env i ronmen ta l ly related Fede ra l 
leg is la t ion are complemented by State env i ronmen ta l laws. The shift towards greater 
decentralization requires the imp lemen ta t ion o f short and l o n g te rm approaches in a l l sectors 
i n c l u d i n g those i n v o l v e d in environmental management. Howeve r , cross-sectoral in teg ra t ion 
o f env i ronmen ta l considerations i n t o economic dec is ionmak ing has n o t been su f f ic ien t ly deep 
and the evo lu t ion o f env i ronmen ta l p o l i c y imp lemen ta t ion has n o t been accompanied by 
adequate capacity building at State and m u n i c i p a l leve ls . Comp lex dec is ionmak ing 
frameworks do l i t t l e t o p romo te sustainable wa te r resources management in water-stressed 
no r the rn and cen t ra l States. S im i la r ly , c r i t i c a l re fo rms to extend water p r i c i n g f r om 
mun ic ipa l i t ies and indus t r ia l use rs t o the ag r icu l tu ra l sector were rejected by Congress in 
2001. 
Insu f f ic ien t env i ronmen ta l competencies at the State and l o c a l level, comb ined with 
l im i t e d au tho r i ty t o raise revenues f r om taxes o r other charges, impedes decentralization o f 
env i ronmen ta l management per federal and State laws. 
49. 
Environment and Livelihoods. M e x i c o has a wea l th o f na tu ra l resources wh ich , i f 
u t i l i z e d in a sustainable manner, c o u l d se rve as a driver o f g r ow t h in r u r a l areas. With 1.3 
percent o f the wo r ld ’s land area, M e x i c o hosts about 12 percent o f known terrestrial 
b iod ive rs i ty and i s one o f the wo r ld ’s 12 megadiverse countries. Mex ico ’s forests account f o r 
over 100,000 permanent j o b s and are home t o 10 percent o f the na t iona l population. The 
coun t ry i s unique in that 70 percent o r mo re o f i t s forest area i s within the boundaries o f 
ejidos and indigenous communities. L a n d tenu re re fo rms in the 1990s gave many M e x i c a n 
farmers t i t les t o property, thereby p r o v i d i n g incentives t o increase p r o d u c t i v i t y in ag r icu l tu ra l 
and fo res t ry ac t iv i t ies and t o consolidate sma l l p lo ts i n t o v iab le farms. 
Innova t ive 
mechanisms to permit bank ing and t rad ing o f water, as w e l l as t o increase operational and 
maintenance costs in i r r i g a t i o n districts, p romo te m o r e e f f ic ien t water use among users. 
50. 
That said, Mex ico ’s na tu ra l resources have n o t been managed in a sustainable manner. 
Water resource management i s perhaps Mex ico ’s mos t u rgen t env i ronmen ta l p rob lem today, 
and one that impac ts h e a v i l y o n the economy. The coun t ry i s slightly l e s s than 2 m i l l i o n km2 
in size and the popu la t ion has quadrupled f r om 25 m i l l i o n in 1950, t o 100 m i l l i o n today. 
Popu la t ion g r ow t h has occurred nationwide, but has been greater in the semi-arid and a r i d 
north, northwest, and central regions, w h i c h are p rec ise ly the regions with greater economic 
a c t i v i t y and where the m a j o r water shortage p rob lems occur. H a l f the vo lume o f abstracted

groundwater i s pumped f r om ove rexp lo i ted aquifers. In 1975, 32 o f a t o t a l o f 653 aquifers 
were considered overdrawn; there we re 80 by 1985 and 100 by 2002, accounting f o r ove r 50 
percent o f the country’s groundwater supply. P r i o r i t y i s s u e s t o be addressed inc lude : (a) over- 
exp lo i ta t ion o f surface and g round wa tg ; (b) m i n im i z i n g u s e o f scarce wa te r resource f o r l o w

r i g h t s adm in is t ra t ion (ma in ly due t o ove r -a l loca t ion o f water rights); and (e) high subs id ies f o r 
pumping groundwater and inappropriate p r i c i n g o f water. 
51. 
In t e rm s o f forest resources, M e x i c o s u f f e r s f r om one o f the wo r ld ’s highest 
deforestation rates, around 1.2 percent per year. Based o n p re l im ina ry i n f o rm a t i o n f r om the 
2002 Na t iona l Pe r iod ica l Forest Inven to ry , app rox ima te ly 770,000 hectares o f arboreal forest 
pe r year were los t between 1993 and 2000. O f this total, 66 percent takes p lace in t rop ica l 
forests, inc lud ing areas o f high b i o d i v e r s i t y value. The loss in na tu ra l resources places a 
s ign i f ican t t o l l o n Mex ico ’s b i o l o g i c a l wealth: 2,582 species and subspecies o f birds, 
amphibians, r e p t i l e s and mamma ls are at risk, o f w h i c h 4 1 are p robab ly already ex t inc t in the 
wild, 1,215 are endangered o r threatened with extinction, and 1,326 are subject t o special 
p ro tec t ion . The m a i n immed ia te causes o f deforestation and forest degradation are forest 
f i res , i l l e g a l logging, extensive l ives tock p roduc t ion and c lea r ing f o r ag r icu l tu ra l purposes. 
Unsustainable ag r icu l tu ra l practices have led t o high rates o f s o i l erosion and desertification, 
w h i c h affect app rox ima te ly 60 percent o f arable lands. T rad i t iona l and subsistence fa rm ing 
has con t r ibu ted t o env i ronmen ta l degradation, encroaching o n forests and f rag i le land t o boost

o f m a n y marine species o f comme rc ia l value, and thus o f the exhaustion o f fishing grounds 
and damage to ma r ine eco log ica l networks. 
52. 
Environment and Health. M e x i c o has a re la t ive ly high incidence o f illnesses that 
can be correlated with env i ronmen ta l variables, especially among vulnerable groups 
(e.g., children, pregnant women, elderly). Such environmental variables inc lude access t o 
safe water supply and basic sanitation, as well as exposure t o a i r pollutants, hazardous 
substances, and indoo r a i r p o l l u t i o n in r u r a l areas where wood -bu rn ing stoves are used. In 
short, while in recent years M e x i c o has made s ign i f ican t progress in reduc ing the hea l th 
impac ts o f po l lu t ion , e f fo r ts to diminish the impacts o f unsustainable development processes 
need t o be consolidated and extended. 
53. 
M u n i c i p a l waste management i s at an ea r ly stage. 
M u n i c i p a l waste generation 
increased f r om 28 m i l l i o n tons t o 31.5 m i l l i o n tons between 1993 and 2001, m a i n l y re f lec t ing 
r a p i d popu la t ion growth, high rates o f in te rna l m ig ra t ion and urbanization. Proper disposal 
capacity i s so inadequate that over h a l f o f m u n i c i p a l waste i s sen t t o uncon t ro l led and i l l e g a l 
land f i l ls . I l l e g a l dumping o f s o l i d waste o f ten results in imp rope r operation o f sewerage and 
drainage systems, becom ing a disease vector and creating pub l ic hea l th r i s k s . 
L o c a l 
governments do n o t have the capacity f o r p rope r waste management. 
54. 
In t e rm s o f a i r quality, p o l l u t i o n leve ls have s ign i f ican t ly dec l ined ove ra l l in u rban 
areas during the last t e n years, i n c l u d i n g in M e x i c o C i ty . However, re la t ive ly high emissions

IV . THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

INPUTS TO DESIGN THE STRATEGY 

56. 
The b of this CPS takes into consideration it v w i e t y o f inpu ts received from b o t h 
in te rna l and external sources. On the one hand, b ra ins to rm ing sessions with l o c a l s t a f f in the 
M e x i c o o f f i c e and with WBG s ta f f in headquarters we re conducted at d i f fe ren t stages o f 
preparation, be fo re h o l d i n g the fo rma l Reg iona l B ra ins to rm ing mee t ing in December 2003. 
Other in te rna l sources taken i n t o consideration we re OED ’s evaluations, the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the current program, and the valuable coun t ry know ledge existing within the Bank ’s 
extended team w o r k i n g o n M e x i c o . On the other hand, the government, c i v i l society, and 
other development partners p rov ided k e y inputs t o the strategy. In add i t ion to w o r k i n g in 
partnership with the SHCP (the Bank ’s m a i n counterpart) this strategy was also discussed 
with other government institutions, i n c l u d i n g the O f f i c e o f the Presidency and sectoral 
Secretariats. 

Country Partnership Strategy Evaluation and AAA Review 

57. 
M e x i c o has b e e n an impo r tan t B a n k c l ien t f o r decades. Espec ia l ly over the past th ree 
administrations, beg inn ing with the e lec t ion o f President Salinas in 1989 and th rough the 
administrations o f Presidents Z e d i l l o and Fox , the B a n k h a d a substantial and w ide - rang ing 
p rog ram o f lend ing operations, ana ly t ica l wo rk , and p o l i c y dialogue. In 2001, OED i s s u e d a 
Coun t ry Assistance Eva lua t ion (CAE ) that assessed the p rog ram f r om 1989 th rough 2000. 
A l t h o u g h the c l ima te f o r the Bank’s p rog ram in M e x i c o has changed in some impo r tan t 
respects, m a n y o f the lessons f r om that C A E r em a i n v a l i d today. In addition, the recen t ly 
completed Coun t ry AAA Assessmen t (C A A ) that covered ana ly t ica l w o r k during the FYO1- 
03 p e r i o d also p rov ides impo r tan t lessons to consider w h e n w e l o o k forward. 
58. 
An impo r tan t lesson o f experience i s that a l though M e x i c o i s one o f the largest LBRD 
borrowers, the B a n k i s o n l y a ma rg ina l actor in M e x i c o . B a n k lend ing p rov ides a v e r y sma l l 
share o f p u b l i c revenues and the government has ready access t o alternative p r iva te financing. 
The Bank’s advice and ana ly t ica l w o r k i s one among m a n y sources o f expert advice and 
analysis available t o the government. This has two impo r tan t imp l ica t ions . First, M e x i c o has 
exercised high degrees o f ownership in i t s re la t ionsh ip with the Bank . I t invo lves the B a n k 
o n l y in areas where i t finds that the B a n k can p r o v i d e valuable assistance and where i t does 
n o t pe rce ive excessive B a n k cond i t iona l i ty . Second, in order t o p rov ide value-added in 
Mex ico , the B a n k has needed t o do excep t iona l ly good wo rk , comb in ing world-class 
in te rna t iona l experience and ana ly t ica l s k i l l s with deep know ledge o f the coun t ry and i t s 
ins t i tu t ions . 
59. W h e n the B a n k has been able to adequately m o b i l i z e and manage i t s human capital, i t 
has con t r ibu ted s ign i f ican t ly to p o l i c y debate and fo rmu la t ion in M e x i c o and, th rough i t s 
lending operations, has aided e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion o f government investments and r e f o rm 
programs. In the last 15 years, the B a n k has p r o v i d e d valuable assistance in d e f i n i n g and 
imp lemen t ing investment programs and p o l i c y re fo rms in education, health, agriculture, 
transport, environment, trade, pension, and other areas. Howeve r , the B a n k has n o t always 
been able t o p rov ide value-added, sometimes because the government has n o t accepted the 
Bank’s engagement. The recent AAA assessment f o u n d that a l though the l e v e l o f dialogue 

23 

related t o Bank’s ana ly t ica l w o r k was ra ted satisfactory, ove ra l l dissemination and strategic 
relevance were found m a r g i n a l l y satisfactory. 
60. 
The d i f f icu l t ies o f bringing non - f inanc ia l value-added t o M e x i c o ce r ta in ly a f fec ted the 
Bank’s e f fo r ts to develop a lend ing program. The SHCP appropriately sets ce i l ings o n the 
expenditure programs o f l i n e ministries w i t h o u t regard t o f inanc ing sources. Therefore, f r om 
the perspective o f a l i n e m in is t ry , a B a n k loan does n o t add t o i t s ove ra l l resource envelope. 
Because o f this “non-additionality”, 
the l i n e m i n i s t r i e s have o f ten been hesitant t o ask fo r 
B a n k loans o r accepted the technical assistance p rov ided during loan preparation and then 
used non -Bank resources f o r p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . They are concerned about the “hassle 
factors”-Bank 
procurement rules, audits, and safeguard requirements. On the other hand, 
some ministries, where the Bank ’s w o r k i s better known , we lcomed and bene f i ted f r om the 
Bank’s invo lvemen t th rough lend ing operations. 
61. 
Acco rd ing t o the O E D CAE , l i n e m i n i s t r i e s found that the B a n k c o u l d have value- 
added by: p r o v i d i n g first-class p o l i c y analysis; giving an objective, outsider’s perspective; 
sharing lessons o f in te rna t iona l experience; using the Bank’s conven ing p ow e r to bring about

sustained, p roduc t ive re la t ionsh ip with the WBG within i t s ins t i tu t iona l memory, i t m a y n o t 
perceive that these po ten t ia l con t r ibu t ions are w o r t h the “hassle factors”. This suggests that, 
in d e f i n i n g i t s p o r t f o l i o o f ac t iv i t ies in this CPS, the WBG should focus o n areas where i t 
already maintains p roduc t ive relationships (or i t can q u i c k l y start them) o r where the WBG 
can emp loy the bes t expertise (either i t s o w n o r external) t o he lp po l icy -make rs dea l w i t h 
d i f f i c u l t questions. Moreover, the C A A pane l spec i f ica l ly recommended that the AAA 
p rog ram should be organized around a f ew o r g a n i z i n g h n i f y i n g p r inc ip les such as: (a) 
competitiveness; (b) pove r ty reduction; (c) infrastructure, i n c l u d i n g water and sewerage 
services; and (d) mode rn iza t ion o f ins t i tu t ions . The pane l also stated, “In Mex ico , accept that 
AAA w o r k and lend ing are mo re separated than i s n o rm a l l y the case. AAA i s m o r e c lea r ly an 
end in i t s e l f in a middle income coun t ry such as M e x i c o than in mos t countries.” 
H i s t o r i c a l l y the re has also been a p o l i t i c a l aspect t o the Bank’s recep t ion in M e x i c o . 
The Bank ’s name evoked suspicion o r even h o s t i l i t y f r om some elements o f M e x i c a n society. 
F o r this reason, even M e x i c a n leaders w h o consider the Bank’s ana ly t ica l w o r k and 
pub l ica t ions a valuable source o f ideas (G loba l P o l l r e s u l t s in B o x 6) s t i l l w o r r i e d that the 
Bank ’s association with certain sensitive re fo rms w o u l d b e p o l i t i c a l l y ha rm fu l . Even in areas 
that we re l e s s p o l i t i c a l l y sensitive, the govemmen t was sometimes re luc tan t t o accept the 
Bank ’s p u b l i c embrace. This may, in part, exp la in why ove ra l l dissemination o f ana ly t ica l 
w o r k was found m a r g i n a l l y satisfactory by the C A A . As p o l i c y debate and p o l i t i c a l 
compe t i t ion in M e x i c o have become mo re open and democratic, 
these concerns are 
d im i n i s h i n g (Messages t o the B a n k f r om C i v i l Society in B o x 5). Nevertheless, the B a n k 
must s t i l l be aware that p u b l i c endorsement o f ce r ta in programs and re fo rms might damage 
their p o l i t i c a l viability-especially 
as the next, highly contested e lec t ion approaches.

because m a j o r pension,

February 29, 2004, the Bank’s exposure in M e x i c o was US$10.5 b i l l i o n , representing 9.2

In order t o m o n i t o r p o r t f o l i o implementation, the C o l om b i a and M e x i c o C M U

the n ew team was a Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performance R e v i ew (CPPR)-the

M e x i c o since M a y 1997-with 
the active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f ou r government counterparts, as 
well as f inanc ia l agents and execu t ing institutions. The m a i n i s s u e s identified during the 
exercise were the generalized delays in effectiveness, the l a c k o f budget p r i o r i t i z a t i o n at the 
sector level, the absence o f e f f ic ien t f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion t o imp lemen t loans at the

Overall, experience o n projects and the findings o f diagnostic w o r k ca r r ied ou t suggest 
substantial opportunities to place even greater re l iance o n government ins t i tu t ions (e.g. those

while at the same t im e supporting capacity building e f fo r ts where weaknesses exist. This

One area that has a m a j o r impac t o n the results o f p u b l i c expenditure i s government 
procurement and contracting. The Coun t ry Procurement Assessmen t Repo r t (CPAR) issued 
in 2002 highlights the strengths and weaknesses o f the M e x i c o lega l and administrative p u b l i c 
procurement f ramewo rk and makes specific suggestions t o imp rove i t . In terms o f B a n k - 
assisted projects, the C P A R found that agencies responsible f o r p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion ca r ry 
ou t procurement in accordance with B a n k po l ic ies and procedures, using i t s standard bidding 
documents. Procurement performance in B a n k p ro jec ts was therefore concluded t o be 
satisfactory and f r e e o f m a j o r problems-2 
procurement audits and 10 agency procurement 
capacity assessments ca r r ied ou t in the past t w o years found n o m a j o r problems either. The 
mos t used procurement me thod i s NC B , and in the m a j o r i t y o f the I C B procedures o n l y 
M e x i c a n f i r m s submit bids. The C P A R also de f ined a Plan o f A c t i o n to strengthen 
procurement at the federal level. The SFP and the B a n k have me t every 3 mon ths t o f o l l o w 
up o n agreed actions-about 
80 percent have been completed. The SFP has made a 
s ign i f ican t e f fo r t t o organize, standardize and even deregulate p u b l i c administrative and 
procurement law-the wide va r ie ty o f r u l e s and regu la t ions a f fec t ing the current procurement 
regime results in dispersed, fragmented and, at times, con t rad ic t ing no rma t ive bodies. F o r 
instance, mo re w o r k i s required at the State l e v e l t o im p r o v e contracting procedures and 
discard those w h i c h d o n o t f o l l ow generally accepted p r inc ip les . Mod i f ica t ions t o the t w o 
procurement laws (one f o r goods and one f o r w o r k s approved in 2000) t o make the system 
mo re e f f ic ien t and transparent are already be fo re Congress. T a k i n g i n t o account the progress 
so far, the SFP and the Bank have agreed t o prepare a Second P lan o f A c t i o n with the 
in ten t ion t o m o v e to coun t ry systems in the area o f procurement at the federal l e v e l during 
this CPS period. 
IFC’s strategy during the past C A S p e r i o d centered o n (a) fostering f inanc ia l sector

The government’s debt management strategy over the CPS p e r i o d i s expected t o 
rema in in l i n e with i t s current approach of: reduc ing the foreign-currency debt as a p ropo r t ion 
o f the total; reduc ing the costs o f fo re ign debt; and extending the ma tu r i ty p r o f i l e o f a l l debt. 
This i s b e i n g achieved by f inanc ing the f isca l de f ic i t in the domestic market, while using 
foreign-currency bo r row ings f o r re f inanc ing purposes on ly . Deve lopmen t o f the domestic 
ma rke t and lengthening o f the yield cu rve has a l lowed f o r coverage o f the government’s 
f inanc ing needs and extension o f the average l i f e o f domestic debt. On the external front, the 
strategy i s t o imp rove the m a t u r i t y p ro f i le , reduce costs by r e t i r i n g co l la te ra l ized debt, 
diversify the investor base, and reduce vu lne rab i l i ty to the unce r ta in ty o f the in te rna t iona l

The sources o f f inanc ing have also changed since the m id -1990s crisis, with a 
s ign i f ican t expansion o f ma rke t debt in b o t h MXN and fo re ign currencies and a reduc t ion in 
bilateral, mu l t i la te ra l and restructured debt. Debt outstanding f r om the IADB and IBRD has 
been reduced by US$1 .1 b i l l i o n since 1995 and cu r ren t ly represents US$17.5 b i l l i o n o r 11 
percent o f Mex ico 's external debt. M e x i c o does n o t have any outstanding ob l iga t ion w i t h the 
IMF. This has generated and, i f the current trend i s continued, w i l l con t inue t o generate 
MDBs lend ing space-"headroom" within exposure guidelines. MDB l e n d i n g presents some

The government's successful debt management strategy imp lemen ted since the mid- 
1990s has resulted in a ma rked imp rovemen t in some risk indicators. In particular, fo re ign -

to ta l net debt at the end o f 1995 t o 38.8 percent at present ( inc lud ing PIDREGAS debt). 
Over the same period, the average m a t u r i t y o f gross domestic federal debt has increased f r om 
0.8 years t o 2.5 years (exc lud ing off-balance shee t l iab i l i t ies , such as IPAB and F AR AC , f o r

PROPOSED STRATEGY AND INSTRUMENTS

This CPS w i l l focus in supporting the government’s e f fo r ts t o reduce pove r ty and 
inequality, increase competitiveness, strengthen institutions, and p romo te environmental 
sustainability in M e x i c o . This section presents f i r s t a discussion o f the WBG’s thinking o n 
h o w i t s re la t ionsh ip with M e x i c o i s evo lv ing and why i t shou ld r em a i n active in the country; a 
description o f the WBG’s comparative advantage and strategic focus; and the Bank’s lending 
cases. The n e x t fou r parts describe the WBG’s lending and non - lend ing instruments proposed 
t o de l ive r the strategy organized under the fou r CPS p i l la rs . The last pa r t o f th is section 
presents the Bank’s f inanc ia l instruments proposed t o support Mex ico ’s debt management 
efforts. 
79 . Mexico-as 
evidenced by i t s per capita income o f about US$5,900 (GNI per capita 
under A t las method)-is 
in an advanced stage o f i t s development and the WBG’s strategy 
needs to take this i n t o consideration. This CPS proposes a greater focus o n the r o l e that the 
WBG can p l a y as a know ledge ins t i tu t ion , while con t inu ing t o de l ive r a p rog ram o f lending 
operations consistent with M e x i c o ’ s development needs. In the n e x t fou r years, the WBG can 
make mo re o f a d i f fe rence in those areas where i t already ma in ta ins p roduc t ive relationships 
w i t h government counterparts, where challenges are mu l t isec to ra l in nature and where there 
rema in d i f f i c u l t unresolved matters. 
I t can also b e the honest b roke r among government 
ins t i tu t ions and c i v i l society in the i r e f fo r ts t o deal with development issues. Tak ing i n t o 
consideration these advantages, we w i l l seek a sustained p rog ramma t ic ana ly t ica l engagement 
in selected areas where 
the WBG can have the greatest impact, such as poverty, 
competitiveness, education quality, decentralization o f p u b l i c finances, and sustainable water 
management. Our ana ly t ica l and lea rn ing assistance in these areas w o u l d b e supported by 
lending, i n c l u d i n g p rog ramma t ic SWAPS, at the request o f the government. In addition, g i v e n 
the importance o f suppo r t ing State governments f o r the development o f Mex ico , the 
authorities and the B a n k w i l l continue discussing po ten t ia l opportunities to increase lending 
and non - lend ing assistance t o the States. These discussions c o u l d lead t o a request f o r 
add i t iona l lending.

NAFTA, and i s a membe r o f O E C D and the W o r l d Trade O rgan iza t ion (WTO). I t i s an IBRD 
coun t ry with investment grade, w h i c h has a s ign i f ican t lending p rog ram with the Bank . I t s 
recent democratic t rans i t ion has received widespread recogn i t ion and has launched greater 
p u b l i c demand f o r transparency, accountability, and decentralization. With these enviable 
assets, wha t i s the comparative advantage o f the W o r l d B a n k in M e x i c o and at wha t p o i n t 
shou ld the coun t ry seek graduation? 
The WBG’s r o l e i s determined by the s ign i f ican t p o v e r t y challenge in M e x i c o and the 
value that the government places o n ou r contribution. A c c o r d i n g t o o f f i c i a l p o v e r t y figures,

w h i l e the poorest tenth earns o n l y 1.1 percent), deep reg iona l and e thn ica l disparities (such as 
nortldsouth, indigenoushon-indigenous), and differences in access t o qua l i ty healthcare, 
education and p u b l i c u t i l i t ies . Moreover, ach iev ing some o f the MDGs by the year 2015 w i l l

estimates o f an average yea r ly g r ow t h rate o f 3.5 percent o f GDP, M e x i c o i s unlikely t o meet 
the goals o f reduc ing extreme pove r ty by h a l f Y 5 under-five m o r t a l i t y by two-thirds, and 
ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y by th ree quarters. I t i s estimated that M e x i c o needs a sustained g r ow t h

in order to achieve the extreme 
p o v e r t y MDG (see Table 2). 
82. 
In response to the expressed desire o f the M e x i c a n government, w h i c h w e also heard 
l o u d and clear in ou r consultations with c iv i l -soc ie ty , the WBG expects t o stay engaged in 
M e x i c o t o continue supporting the country’s e f fo r ts t o tackle i t s development challenges and 
achieve the MDGs. The engagement proposed in this CPS seeks t o respond t o the specific 
requirements o f Mex ico . 

World Bank Group’s Comparative Advantage and Focus 

83. 
Lea rn ing f r om the imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rev ious CAS, and adapting t o the 
challenges posed by a m idd le - income coun t ry such as Mex ico , this CPS w i l l attempt t o have a 
greater development impac t th rough sustained invo lvemen t in selected areas, th rough the use 
o f a l l the available B a n k instruments. This adaptation starts by recogn iz ing that the mos t 
impo r tan t value-added o f the Bank i s n o t in t rans fe r r ing resources but in h e l p i n g M e x i c o 
achieve better development effectiveness th rough targeted ana ly t ica l w o r k and im p r o v e d 
p ro jec t and p o l i c y design. 
84. Our c l ien ts have stated that the m a i n value-added the B a n k has in M e x i c o i s th rough 
analytic w o r k in those areas where: (a) the re are d i f f i c u l t questions; (b) inter-sector w o r k i s 
required; and (c) we a re perceived as a neu t ra l player. I t i s th rough enhanced p rog ramma t ic 
ana ly t ica l w o r k that w e can raise impo r tan t development issues, p romo te debate by d i f fe ren t 
stakeholders and bring t o M e x i c o the experience o f other countries w h i c h have faced s im i la r 
constraints. Our value-added has been less clear t o the M e x i c a n government in some o f ou r 
lending operations, given the constraints posed by the government’s non -add i t iona l i ty and the 
Bank’s cond i t iona l i ty . Moreover, ou r reco rd in the last 8 years shows that m a n y l e n d i n g 
operations in the p rev ious C A S never materialized. Since FYO1, w e have de l ive red an 
average o f 4 lend ing operations per year despite h a v i n g 10-12 operations under preparation 
and o f f e r i n g 11-12 new lending operations p e r year in the p rev ious CAS . 
85. 
Therefore, in th is CPS we propose that ou r emphasis w o u l d shift, together with ou r 
budget resources, towards an enhanced p rog ram o f analytic wo rk . Howeve r , while the Bank ’s 
po ten t ia l value-added comes f r om i t s know ledge and ana ly t ica l contributions, i t i s impo r tan t 
t o keep in mind that i t s effectiveness (convening power, p o l i c y influence, etc.) i s s t i l l c lose ly 
tied t o lending. Thus, this strategy proposes a m o r e strategic w a y o f bundling B a n k ana ly t ica l 
instruments t o p rov ide ana ly t ica l support in k e y areas o f opportunity, w h i l e at the same t im e 
strengthening the Bank ’s lend ing support in core areas where i t has already established 
p roduc t ive relationships ( fo r example, p o v e r t y reduction, education, health, wa te r resources 
management, i r r iga t ion , and forestry) and in other areas where w e in tend t o make a s ign i f ican t 
con t r ibu t ion t o c r i t i c a l l y impo r tan t government p rog rams ( fo r example, justice, p rope r ty 
rights, access t o f inanc ia l services, and env i ronmen ta l management). Within a constant 
budget scenario, this w o u l d imply l e s s ove ra l l resources devoted to ove ra l l p ro jec t

T h e o f f i c i a l numbers show a n imp rovemen t in i n c om e d i s t r i b u t i o n be tween 2000-2002, but i t i s s t i l l unc lear

86. On the know ledge f ron t we w o u l d give p r i o r i t y t o areas where answers are n o t read i ly 
available and where the B a n k can emp loy the best expertise t o he lp po l icy -make rs find 
answers to d i f f i c u l t questions. W e have selected a few strategic areas f o r p rog ramma t ic AAA 
work, w h i c h w o u l d help the B a n k : stay engaged in a core issue area ove r the full CPS period; 
build longe r - te rm relationships with k e y na t iona l counterparts within and outside the 
government; enhance i t s s t a f f know ledge o f Mex ico ’s s i tua t ion and ins t i tu t ions so as t o 
imp rove the i r po ten t ia l value-added; use the full range o f B a n k p roduc ts ( fo rma l reports, 
i n f o rm a l papers, conferences, workshops, dissemination activities, IDFs, lea rn ing programs, 
and fee-for-services-an 
area where w e have recen t ly h a d pos i t ive experiences w o r k i n g with 
government institutions); and create the foundations in t e rm s o f know ledge and ins t i tu t iona l 
relationship f o r lending operations in w h i c h the B a n k can have non - f inanc ia l value-added. 
The areas where w e cu r ren t ly see these opportunities w i t h i n each o f the themes o f this CPS 
are: poverty, competitiveness, water, and education quality. Decen t ra l iza t ion c o u l d b e the

Hacendaria, a na t iona l conven t ion b e i n g convened t o discuss federal, State and m u n i c i p a l

The p rog ramma t ic approach w i l l r e q u i r e that w e w o r k in thematic clusters, under the 
leadership o f ou r l o c a l l y based Sector Leaders, t o p rov ide f o r multi-sectoral, mu l t i -ope ra t iona l 
and ex t ra - ins t i tu t iona l expertise in longe r - te rm partnerships with the government and other 
partners ( inc lud ing IADB, U S A I D , J I C A and others) to tackle Mex ico ’s m a i n development 
challenges. W o r k i n g in thematic clusters with such characteristics shou ld p romo te consensus 
building, strengthen p o l i c y recommendations, and imp rove p ro jec t and sectoral strategy 
design, delivery, and mon i to r ing . This approach requires a h um a n resource strategy that 
a l lows u s t o convene the best expertise we can muster as a know ledge ins t i tu t ion . I t also 
means that we w i l l need s t a f f w h o w o r k together e f fec t ive ly as a team and have a shared 
understanding o f the struggles faced by the poo r and vulnerable. In order t o launch this effort, 
the C M U sponsored a retreat f o r 86 s t a f f during w h i c h we spent a day in indigenous v i l lages 
close to Oaxaca C i ty , M e x i c o . D i v i d e d i n t o 11 groups, w e learned about the development 
i s s u e s p o o r commun i t ies encounter, especially in light o f the MDG s ; w e heard the voices o f 
the poo r and gained a better understanding o f the uniqueness o f each commun i ty (shared 
language and culture, p a t r im o n y h n i q u e products t o market, access t o roads and markets, 
government, partner and B a n k p rog rams that exist). The f o l l ow i n g day each g roup presented 
i t s findings in poster sessions (s im i la r t o the Deve lopmen t Marketplace). We shared with 
each other the impac t o f ou r experience, as w e l l as h o w the lessons we h a d learned c o u l d 
shape ou r w o r k and he lp u s better imp lemen t this CPS. 
88. 
T o a t ta in a mo re e f fec t ive dialogue w i th , and expose the Bank ’s know ledge resources 
t o k e y audiences-both 
in government and c i v i l society-in a systematic manner, an e f fec t ive 
outreach and dissemination strategy has also been outlined. In add i t ion t o w o r k i n g in the 
areas identified in the G l o b a l P o l l and in consultations with c i v i l society, this strategy entails 
(a) enhancing the Bank’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in conferences and p u b l i c debates; (b) upgrading, 
expanding and p r om o t i n g the Pub l ic I n f o rm a t i o n Center; (c) fu r the r deve lop ing the M e x i c o

Im p r o v i n g the Bank’s competitiveness in M e x i c o also requ i res m o v i n g to coun t ry

Lending Scenarios and IBRD’s Exposure

The SHCP and the B a n k have agreed t o w o r k in partnership during this CPS p e r i o d 
(FY05-08) t o implement a lending p rog ram that best addresses Mex ico ’s development needs 
as a c red i two r thy m idd le - income coun t ry and enhances the Bank’s a b i l i t y t o respond q u i c k l y 
t o chang ing circumstances. A lend ing range o f US$0.8 t o US$1.7 b i l l i o n a year i s proposed 
in order t o p romo te the country’s key development objectives supported th rough this CPS. 
The proposed lending range i s consistent with ca re fu l risk management, in v i ew o f the 
government’s sound macroeconomic po l ic ies , i t s prudent debt management strategy t o 
con ta in the ove ra l l p u b l i c debt as a percent o f GDP and reduce the currency exposure (see par.

120. 
In summary f o r FY05 -FY07 , under the theme o f env i ronmen ta l sustainability, we 
propose a substancial p rog ram o f ana ly t ica l wo rk . This AAA w i l l be accompanied by two

At the P ro iec t level, the government w i l l be able t o use the f l e x i b i l i t y in the l o a n t e rm s

R I S K S OF THE PROPOSED STRATEGY 

126. The proposed strategy faces r i s k s . First, as n o s ing le p o l i t i c a l p a r t y has a m a j o r i t y in 
Congress, i t m a y be d i f f i c u l t t o implement pending re fo rms (fiscal, energy, pensions, labor, 
telecommunications, water, jud ic ia l , ete.). Arty one o f the three major p o l i t i c a l parties c o u l d 
w in the nex t presidential election, however, so there m a y s t i l l ex is t w i n d ow o f oppo r tun i ty t o 
build consensus t o pass re fo rms with longe r - te rm benefits. 
127. Second, the recent inc ip ien t s i g n s o f economic recove ry in M e x i c o c o u l d b e stalled i f 
the U .S . economic upturn does n o t continue, i f there i s another emerging ma rke t c r is is that 
spreads t o Mex ico , i f M e x i c o i s unable t o increase i t s competitiveness to respond t o Asian 
compe t i t ion in the N o r t h Ame r ican market, o r i f the re i s a s ign i f ican t down tu rn in o i l prices. 
This risk i s lessened by the government’s comm i tmen t t o imp lemen t a p rog ram f o r enhancing 
trade competitiveness, and by Mex ico ’s recent so l id macroeconomic and debt-management 
reco rd (Le,, f isca l d isc ip l ine and f lex ib le exchange rate regime) that a l lowed i t t o ma in ta in 
access to cap i ta l markets during the recent in te rna t iona l economic down tu rn and emerging 
ma rke t turbulence. 
128. Third, structural p rob lems in the State governments c o u l d resu l t in a sub-national 
government entering i n t o f isca l d i f f i c u l t i e s that c o u l d prevent i t f r om de l ive r ing basic services 
o r in excluded groups demanding improvements that c o u l d exceed the capacity o f l o c a l 
governments t o respond. Th is r i s k i s especially acute in the poo re r southern States. I t has 
been p a r t l y reduced by the establishment o f ma rke t -d r iven mechanisms f o r restraint o f sub- 
na t iona l debt and by the on -go ing e f fo r ts to strengthen the inter-government f isca l system. 
129. Fourth, the non -add i t iona l i ty o f B a n k f inanc ing f r om the p o i n t o f view o f l i n e 
m i n i s t r i e s presents a challenge t o the Bank’s a b i l i t y t o develop the proposed lending program. 
Th is means that the Bank w i l l need t o ensure high value-added by w o r k i n g in areas where w e 
can bring exceptional know ledge and the po ten t ia l fo r impact. The strong proposed p rog ram 
o f ana ly t ica l w o r k in the CPS shou ld he lp the B a n k t o achieve this goal. 
130. Fifth, an ove r t strategy o f emphasizing AAA c o u l d backfire, jeopa rd iz ing the Bank’s 
repu ta t ion as a p o l i t i c a l l y neu t ra l advisor and ac tua l ly reduc ing i t s fbture effectiveness. The 
B a n k w i l l have t o make a strong e f fo r t t o imp rove i t s AAA w o r k q u a l i t y and review processes 
( inc lud ing increased pa r t ic ipa t ion o f government counterparts and l o c a l peer reviewers), while 
at the same strengthening i t s dissemination. 
131. F ina l ly , there i s an in te rna l r i s k to the Bank . U n d e r this strategy, i f a few operations
