iii. 

T h i s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) has been developed in close 
co l labo ra t ion with the Gove rnmen t o f Kazakhs tan t o ensure that i t responds t o the 
coun t ry ’s eme rg ing development objectives and t o i t s r a p i d l y chang ing econom ic and 
soc ia l cond i t ions . F inanc ing w i l l n o t b e the primary re la t ionsh ip driver f o r this CPS. 
Rather, the Bank w i l l use i t s in te rna t iona l know ledge and experience t o h e l p Kazakhs tan 
build a mode rn , r a p i d l y g r ow i n g and diverse economy that imp roves the w e l f a r e o f a l l i t s 
c i t izens and espec ia l ly the poo r . T h i s CPS b u i l d s o n and extends the f l e x i b l e approaches 
recen t ly deve loped elsewhere in the B a n k f o r o the r M i d d l e - I n c om e Coun t r ies . 
T h e strategy set ou t in the CPS takes as i t s starting p o i n t the coun t ry ’s la rge and 
g r ow i n g ene rgy income. U t i l i z i n g these funds e f fec t ive ly w i l l challenge the country’s 
mac roeconom ic management as w e l l as i t s imp lemen ta t ion capacity. T h e CPS sets ou t a 
p r o g r am tha t w i l l assist the Gove rnmen t in mee t ing these challenges in a n env i ronmen t 
whe re the need f o r ex te rna l f inanc ing i s m i n im a l . 
T h e n e x t phase o f t h e re la t ionsh ip be tween the Gove rnmen t and the Bank w i l l 
build o n the Jo in t Economic Research P rog ram (JEW), an innova t ive approach t o non - 
l e n d i n g services under imp lemen ta t ion f o r the past t w o years. The J E W i s co f inanced by 
the Gove rnmen t and i t s content i s agreed t o annua l ly in pa ra l le l with the Government’s 
regu la r planning and budget cyc le . T h i s has ensured that the ana ly t ic and adv iso ry 
services p r o v i d e d are re levan t t o t h e country’s needs, enhance coun t ry ownership, and 
g i v e greater visibility t o the Bank th roughou t the government. 
iv . 
The Government’s Program: Kazakhs tan has set the f o l l o w i n g m a i n goals: 
ach iev ing in te rna t iona l standards f o r p u b l i c services and enterprises ove r the n e x t decade 
and a ha l f , and inc reas ing the competitiveness o f i t s tradable n o n - o i l sectors. T h e 
Gove rnmen t plans t o accomp l ish these goals th rough f o u r p i l la rs : (I) managing the o i l 
windfall and improving pub l ic institutions and policies, (2) developing an app rop r ia te 
ro le fo r the government t o foster competitiveness and fac i l i ta te business, (3) investing in 
human cap i ta l and infrastructure, and (4) safeguarding the environment. 
v. 
The Partnership: The CPS i s g rounded in the Bank ’s r e c o g n i t i o n tha t i t needs t o 
adapt i t s business m o d e l t o Kazakhstan’s deve lopmen t agenda, and the Gove rnmen t ’s 
recogn i t ion that the Bank b r ings m u c h m o r e than f inanc ia l resources to the table. T h e 
CPS takes as i t s s ta r t ing p o i n t the fou r p i l l a r s o f the Government’s strategy, ou t l ines in 
b road terms the Bank’s ana ly t ica l and ope ra t iona l areas o f interest f o r the n e x t year and 
suggests areas o f poss ib le fu tu re in te rven t ions . De ta i ls o f the Bank G r o u p p r o g r am in 
Kazakhs tan w i l l b e set ou t each year in an Annua l Business P lan (ABP). T h e ABP w i l l b e 
developed in pa ra l le l with the Gove rnmen t ’s annua l planning and budge t processes t o 
ensure that the Bank i s fully in step with Kazakhstan’s deve lopmen t agenda. 

vi,. World Bank Group Analytic Work: Based o n the p o s i t i v e experience o f the 
past t w o years, Kazakhs tan has requested tha t the JEW b e extended f o r another three 
years. F o r 2005, consultations ca r r ied ou t by the Ministry o f E c o n om y and Budget 
Planning with government agencies l e d t o a request f o r studies o n pove r ty , 
competitiveness, WTO accession, p u b l i c expenditures and ins t i tu t ions , health, education, 
transport, and env i ronmen ta l programs, as w e l l as w o r k o n reg iona l wa te r -ene rgy 
arrangements. To supplement th is p rog ram , T h e Wo r ld Bank Ins t i tu te (WBI) has been

vii. World Bank Group Operations: The Gove rnmen t recognizes that IBRD’s 

Guidelines for Engagement and Risk Management: The f l e x i b l e na tu re o f the 

i n v o l v em e n t in p ro jec t p repa ra t ion and supe rv is ion can transfer know ledge and sk i l ls in 
ways that a research p rog ram alone cannot accomplish. Acco rd ing ly , the F Y 0 5 ABP 
inc ludes f o u r p ro jec ts in agriculture, wa te r management and env i ronmen t tha t are 
expected t o b e app roved in the c om i n g 18 months. Kazakhs tan w i l l also bene f i t f r o m the

b e designed f o r d e l i v e r y within tw e l v e mon ths whenever possible. T o th is end, 
Kazakhs tan has c omm i t t e d t o s im p l i f y in te rna l processes. As the Government’s f iduc ia ry 
systems are n o t yet consistent w i th in te rna t iona l standards, the Bank ’s p rocu remen t and 
f inanc ia l gu ide l ines w i l l con t inue t o apply.

IFC w i l l comp lemen t th is p rog ram th rough ongo ing support t o the f inanc ia l sector

f inanc ing t o support l o c a l suppliers o f goods and services t o the r a p i d l y g r ow i n g o i l and 
gas sector w i l l b e also considered. 
x. 
CPS creates a need f o r clear guidelines as t o w h e n and whe re the B a n k shou ld be 
engaged in Kazakhstan. Based o n Kazakhstan’s f inanc ia l circumstances and i t s 
defensible deve lopmen t agenda, the first basis f o r any engagement mus t b e demand by 
Kazakhstan. Howeve r , o n i t s side the B a n k must ensure that i t s w o r k in Kazakhs tan 
serves the ins t i tu t ion ’s broader goals and meets ins t i tu t iona l standards. F o r t h i s purpose, 
management w i l l regu la r ly m o n i t o r b o t h re fo rms and the env i ronmen t i n t o w h i c h Bank 
resources are placed. The CPS inc ludes a se t o f ind ica to rs that w i l l b e used t o assess 
progress in k e y p o l i c y areas. The B a n k w i l l also regularly assess the extent t o w h i c h i t s 
p o l i c y recommendations i n f o r m Gove rnmen t p o l i c y and whe the r Bank - f inanced p ro jec ts 
are b e i n g e f fec t ive ly implemented. 
x i . 
The CPS f ramewo rk i s designed t o r em a i n in fo rce until such t im e as i t i s n o 
longe r relevant. “Relevance” w i l l b e assessed against three c r i te r ia : the demand f o r the 
Bank ’s services; the Bank’s value-added t o the deve lopmen t process; and, Kazakhstan’s 
ove ra l l p o l i c y environment. We re the p r o g r am t o f a l l short in one o r m o r e o f these areas, 
a n ew strategy w o u l d be prepared and presented t o the Boa rd . To demonstrate the 
fiamework’s con t inued relevance, Managemen t w i l l p r o v i d e the B o a r d with a brief 
progress repo r t eve ry 2-3 years. 
x i i . 
B o a r d Membe rs m a y w i s h t o discuss the f o l l o w i n g aspects: 
Does the CPS - i n c l u d i n g the JEW and the ABP - app rop r ia te ly respond t o 
Kazakhstan’s needs, ba lanc ing flexibility w i th accoun tab i l i ty? 
A r e the suggested gu ide l ines f o r engagement adequate?

I. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2. 

K a z a kh s t an has made s ign if icant progress since the b reak -up o f the Soviet 

U n i o n in i t s n a t ion bu i ld ing efforts . I t has deve loped an ac t ive legislature, a lbe i t with 
l i m i t e d p o l i t i c a l d ive rs i ty , and an eme rg ing j u d i c i a r y system. At the same time, i t s 
p o l i t i c a l ins t i tu t ions are s t i l l developing. P ow e r rests m a i n l y in the executive, and towa rds 
the end o f the 1990s some c i v i l and p o l i t i c a l l ibe r t ies we re curtailed. These 
developments, and a widespread pe rcep t ion o f co r rup t ion , have tarnished the coun t ry ’s 
strong econom ic r e f o rm record. Nevertheless, d ia logue t o im p r o v e vo ice and 
pa r t ic ipa t ion i s ongoing, and the Gove rnmen t has ind ica ted i t s in ten t ion t o con t inue the 
process o f democratization, decentralization, and the development o f c i v i l society 
ins t i tu t ions . T h e upcom ing Parliamentary elections in October w i l l b e a test o f this 
process. 1 

3. 

T h e Coun t ry ’s recent economic pe r fo rmance has been impressive a n d i t s 
r e f o r m r e co rd i s among the best in the CIS. G r o w t h has been buoyan t at about 11 

percent o n average since 2000, with income p e r cap i ta expected t o be above $2000 t h i s 
year, 65 percent h ighe r than in 2000. G r o w t h has been d r i v e n mainly-but 
n o t 
exclusively-by 
o i l p r o d u c t i o n and o i l prices. M a n y industries, i n c l u d i n g e lec t r ic i ty , 
food, construction, and banking, have rebounded s t rong ly thanks t o s t ruc tu ra l reforms, 
economic s tab i l i ty and demand generated by o i l revenues. The country’s p u b l i c and 
p r iva te savings leve ls have increased s tead i ly since 1998, p r o v i d i n g the base f o r a 
sovereign inves tmen t grade r a t i n g by two in te rna t iona l r a t i n g agencies. Comme rc ia l bank 
deposits have g r ow n steadily, s igna l ing p u b l i c con f idence in the f inanc ia l sector and t h e 
supe rv is ion authorities. P u b l i c debt i s low , and the bulk o f p r iva te debt i s t i e d t o FD I in 
the o i l sector. FDI f l ow s since 1999 have been s ign i f ican t (amoun t ing t o 9 percent o f 
GDP o n average), m o s t l y t o the o i l and o the r ex t rac t ive sectors (Table 1).

K a z a kh s t an has also achieved a g rea t d e a l in te rms o f s t ruc tu ra l po l icy 
r e f o r m in p r iva t iza t ion , the f inanc ia l sector, pensions, public resource management , 

a n d the energy sector. The country’s econom ic a c t i v i t y ove r the past f ew years has been 
d r i v e n almost exc lus ive ly by the p r i v a t e sector, with nea r ly three-quarters o f a l l 
inves tmen t ca r r ied ou t by p r iva te companies. In 2001 the authorities established the 

OSCE f e l t that the January and Oc tober 1999 elections f e l l short o f commitments. Since then, OSCE has 
in i t ia ted a series of r o u n d tables t o o f f e r assistance in im p r o v i n g the e lec tora l leg is la t ion in Kazakhstan, a 
process that i s s t i l l under way. OSCE i s also ac t ive ly con t r ibu t ing to the process o f im p r o v i n g med ia

Lessons Learned 

24. 
This CPS incorporates lessons from a wide range of reviews of the Bank’s 
Kazakhstan program, including C o u n t r y P o r t f o l i o Performance Rev iews (CPPRs), an 
OED C o u n t r y Assistance Eva lua t ion , a C l i e n t Survey, and, mos t recently, a QAG r e v i ew 
o f AAA.6 T h e m a i n findings o f these rev iews are summa r ized b e l ow : 

0 The Client Survey found that the Bank’s greatest value to Kazakhstan i s as a 
knowledge provider and facilitator o f reform. But the recen t QAG r e v i ew o f E S W

t h e Gove rnmen t also recognizes that, w h e n buy-in has been strong, Bank p ro jec ts 
have p r o v i d e d know ledge transfer that goes w e l l beyond wha t i s poss ib le th rough 
ana ly t ic w o r k alone (see B o x 1). 

IV . THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

Overall Approach 

25. 
Building on these lessons and in line with recommendations from the Bank’s 
Middle Income Country Task Force , this CPS sets out a new approach for the 

Bank’s engagement in Kazakhstan. This strategic f ramewo rk accepts the Government’s 
development agenda, focuses o n a f l e x i b l e business m o d e l that i s synch ron ized with the 
Government’s o w n budge t and dec is ion m a k i n g processes, ou t l ines the b r o a d areas in 
w h i c h the Gove rnmen t has asked the B a n k t o p r o v i d e support, and ind ica tes the 
ins t rumen ts th rough w h i c h that support w i l l b e p rov ided . An Annual.Business P l a n w i l l 
b e prepared each year with the Gove rnmen t de ta i l ing the Bank ’s ana ly t ic and l e n d i n g 
operations f o r that year and identifying areas o f p rospec t ive engagement f o r fu tu re years. 

26. 
A key driver of the approach w i l l be the Joint Economic Research P rog ram 
(JERP ) , an innovative mechanism f o r planning and financing AAA work. B e g u n t w o 

years ago, the J E W i s an e f fo r t o n the pa r t o f the B a n k and the Gove rnmen t t o strengthen 
the impac t o f Bank ana ly t ica l w o r k . U n d e r the JERP, the Gove rnmen t and the B a n k agree 
t o a p rog ram o f AAA w o r k t o b e co - f inanced by the Gove rnmen t and the Bank . Ove r the 
f i rs t three years o f the program, the Government’s f inanc ing share i s p rog rammed t o r ise 
from 30 percent t o 50 percent. 

27 . 

This f o rm a l co - f inanc ing arrangement, un ique in the ECA R e g i o n and p o s s i b l y in 
the Bank, brings bene f i ts that go w e l l b e y o n d funding. T h e JERP ensures tha t B a n k 
ana ly t ic w o r k i s a l igned each year w i th Gove rnmen t p r io r i t ies . Since the Gove rnmen t 
approves and co-finances each p iece o f ana ly t ica l wo rk , c l ien t owne rsh ip i s n o t an issue. 
T h e JERP has also been e f fec t ive in inc reas ing the v i s i b i l i t y o f the B a n k b e y o n d 
i n d i v i d u a l l i n e m in is t r ies and in ensu r ing that the B a n k de l ive rs q u a l i t y p roduc ts in a 
t im e l y manner. In an endorsement o f i t s value, the Gove rnmen t has requested tha t the 
JERP b e extended f o r three years b e y o n d F Y 0 5 and poss ib ly increased in size. 

28. While the J E W i s a key driver o f the CPS, the Government recognizes 
increasingly that the Bank’s involvement in project preparation and supervision can 
transfer knowledge and skills in ways that the J E W alone cannot accomplish. 

Acco rd ing ly , the Gove rnmen t and the Bank have agreed t o i n c l u d e 4 p ro jec ts in the F Y 0 5 
business plan (see Annex 1). Fu tu re l e n d i n g w i l l depend o n deve lop ing a consensus 
among the economic authorities, the l i n e m in is t r ies and Pa r l iamen t with respect t o the 
value-added o f im p l em e n t i n g inves tmen ts in partnership w i th the Bank. 

29 . 

In l i n e with the Government’s demands, p ro jec ts in Kazakhs tan w i l l need t o b e 
designed f o r q u i c k delivery, with p repa ra t ion held t o 12 mon ths and im p l em e n t a t i o n 
timetables t o three years wheneve r possible. F o r i t s part, Kazakhs tan has m a d e a 
comm i tmen t to s im p l i f y i n t em a l processes t o speed up p ro jec t app rova l and

Risks 

T h e strategy ou t l ined in this document faces two b r o a d sets o f risks -- the 
43. 
first associated w i t h Kazakhs tan ’s dependence on o i l revenues a n d the second 
associated w i t h the n a tu r e o f the CPS . R isks associated with o i l dependency f a l l i n t o 

tw o groups: those h a v i n g t o d o with mac roeconom ic management and those h a v i n g t o d o 
with behav io rs and incentives. R i s k s associated with the strategy stem f r o m the fac t that i t 
represents a n e w business approach f o r the Bank in Kazakhstan. 

44. 

With r eg a rd to macroeconomic risks, K a z a kh s t an i s be t te r pos it ioned t h a n in 

the past to wea the r ex te rna l shocks. A l t h o u g h the o i l indus t ry i s at an ea r ly stage, 
revenues are expected t o con t inue t o g r ow subs tan t ia l ly f o r the n e x t two decades, d r i v e n 
m a i n l y by increased p roduc t ion , w h i c h i s set t o doub le by 2012. N o tw i t h s t a n d i n g the 
inhe ren t v o l a t i l i t y in w o r l d o i l prices, i t w o u l d take a substantial dec l ine in w o r l d energy

p r o d u c t i o n (about U S $ 1 0 - 12 pe r barrel) and put serious pressure o n Kazakhstan’s 
ex te rna l and f isca l balances.* T h i s assessment assumes that the reco rd o f p ruden t 
mac roeconom ic management, i n c l u d i n g management o f the N a t i o n a l Fund a n d p u b l i c 
expenditures, continues i n t o the future. Exchange ra te app rec ia t ion w i l l b e d i f f i c u l t t o 
a v o i d giving the magn i tude o f o i l revenues, p o s i n g a con t inu ing challenge f o r the 
authorities in the i r quest t o achieve broad-based g row th . 

45. 

Kazakhs tan i s also vu lne rab le t o o the r ex te rna l shocks beyond those associated 
with the o i l sector. These inc lude n o n - o i l c omm o d i t y shocks, c l im a t i c shocks a f fec t ing 
the ag r icu l tu ra l sector, and the r i s k o f m a j o r earthquakes t o w h i c h the r e g i o n as a w h o l e i s 
prone. 

46. 
T h e second m a j o r risk associated w i t h Kazakhs tan ’s o i l wea l th i s the 
temp ta t ion th a t wea l th b r ings to subst itute money fo r needed po l icy r e f o rm . 

Expe r ience in other resource r i c h coun t r ies demonstrates that too o f ten the i r gove rnmen ts 
try t o c i rcumven t d i f f i c u l t p o l i c y changes by direct, gove rnmen t -d r iven actions - f o r 
example, subs id iz ing impo r t -subs t i tu t ion indus t r ies ra the r than c rea t ing a compe t i t ive 
business environment. H i s t o r y has demonstrated tha t these alternatives t o g o o d p o l i c i e s 
are never sustainable and, as we l l , lead t o des t ruc t ive ren t seeking and co r rup t ion . A k e y 
t o m i t i g a t i n g these r isks i s the Bank ’s con t inued engagement in Kazakhstan, p a r t i c u l a r l y 
in he lp ing t o foster greater transparency and gove rnmen t effectiveness, and in i m p r o v i n g 
the business environment. 

The pace o f o i l revenue g r ow t h hinges c r u c i a l l y also on the o i l sector inves tmen t climate, the extent t o 
w h i c h technical challenges are overcome, and addressing transpor ta t ion barr iers as o i l p r o d u c t i o n increases.

de l ive r ing p roduc ts tha t mee t the Government’s needs and can be read i ly absorbed by the 
Government. Based o n the JEW’S p i l o t phase, the re i s good evidence tha t these r isks can 
be managed. F o r lending; the annual iden t i f ica t ion o f p ro jec ts supported by Gove rnmen t 
w i l l be the best p ro tec t ion f o r ensuring owne rsh ip and m o v i n g these loans q u i c k l y 
th rough the Government’s system. To de l ive r loans in step with Gove rnmen t needs w i l l 
requ i re p repa ra t ion t im e s that can o n l y come with simpler, m o r e focused projects. 

48. 
A final risk i s the repu ta t ion risk th a t the B a n k m a y face in Kazakhs tan . T h i s 
p rog ram i s p red ica ted o n the assumption that Kazakhs tan continues t o make progress in 
areas c r i t i c a l t o sustainable growth and pove r ty reduc t ion - mac ro and f isca l 
management, the business environment, governance, co r rup t ion , transparency. A 
de te r io ra t ion in gove rnmen t po l ic ies o r performance in these areas w o u l d bring i n t o 
ques t ion the effectiveness o f Bank ac t iv i t ies in Kazakhstan. To manage this r isk , the

pa r t ic ipan ts in t o t a l f r o m NGOs , think t a n k s and p r iva te sector representatives. 

Pa r t ic ipan ts w e r e b r o a d l y supportive o f the fou r p i l l a r s within w h i c h the B a n k and the 
Gove rnmen t p roposed t o operate, and encouraged the Bank t o deepen i t s ac t iv i t ies in 
Kazakhstan. At the same time, they stressed that the Bank shou ld take env i ronmen ta l 
concerns into account in a l l p i l la rs , that soc ia l concerns shou ld b e g i v e n as m u c h

m o r e c lose ly with N G O s and business representatives, shou ld b e made a top p r i o r i t y . 
Some o f the pa r t icu la r issues discussed are as fo l lows : 

' 

I n v o l v e C i v i l Soc ie ty and Business Groups. Pa r t ic ipan ts stressed the need t o build a tri- 
partite pa r tne rsh ip in development (government, c i v i l society, and t h e p r iva te sector), and 
t o i n v o l v e the p u b l i c m o r e in decision-making. T h e y p a r t i c u l a r l y encouraged the Bank t o 
i n v o l v e c i v i l society, business groups and p ro jec t bene f ic ia r ies in a l l pa r ts o f the p ro jec t 
cyc le - design, implementation, and mon i to r ing /eva lua t ion - as w e l l as in i t s economic 
and sector work. The B a n k and Participants agreed that the CPS consultations p r o v i d e d a 
g o o d founda t ion t o build o n th rough m o r e regu la r in te rac t ion . Pa r t ic ipan ts also 
suggested tha t the Bank increase the l e v e l o f i t s d i rec t support t o NGOs th rough a larger 
Sm a l l Grants Program. 

M o n i t o r Resu l ts Closely. Participants f e l t that a l though the Gove rnmen t has increased 
hnding in many areas, the impac t o f th is i s n o t clear, and in some cases ind ica to rs 
con t inue t o worsen. Therefore, the B a n k shou ld b e m o r e i n v o l v e d in m o n i t o r i n g coun t ry 
progress in d i f fe ren t sectors, so that p rog rams can b e held accountable f o r de l ive r ing 
results. Participants pa r t icu la r ly encouraged the B a n k t o con t inue i t s e f fo r ts t o strengthen 
m o n i t o r i n g in the areas o f p o v e r t y and co r rup t ion . T h e B a n k shou ld also ensure that i t s 
o w n in te rven t ions are w e l l mon i to red , with the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f N G O s and stakeholders. 
T h i s can b e done by documen t ing pe r fo rmance target ind ica to rs f o r Bank -suppo r ted 
activities, so that progress and deliverables can b e measured against expected results. 

P rov ide Greater Access t o In fo rma t ion . Pa r t ic ipan ts no ted tha t p u b l i c access t o 
government and other i n f o rm a t i o n was qu i te low , and the q u a l i t y o f i n f o rm a t i o n that was 
available was qu i te poo r . W i t h o u t imp rovemen ts in these areas, i t w o u l d b e d i f f i c u l t t o 
determine h o w e f f i c i e n t l y p u b l i c hnds are used. T h e y the re fo re encouraged the B a n k t o

w o u l d m e a n inc reas ing the use o f l o c a l experts, a l though the va lue o f in te rna t iona l

educa t ion a n d health, f i n d s w o u l d b e better spent o n t ra in ing and deve lop ing be t te r 
d e l i v e r y systems than on building fac i l i t ies . T h e y also encouraged the Bank t o con t inue 
t o w o r k in the area o f soc ia l p ro tec t ion . 

Focus o n R u r a l Deve lopmen t and the Env i ronmen t . Participants supported the Bank ’s 
focus o n ag r icu l tu re and the r u r a l areas, where p o v e r t y i s the greatest, and o n the

p r iva te sector t o support the deve lopmen t p lans o f sma l l towns. As regards the 
environment, participants asked the Bank t o h e l p ensure that o i l i n c om e g r ow t h did n o t 
come at the expense o f the environment, and to h e l p the Gove rnmen t use n e w 
technologies in areas such as gas flaring and o i l spills. In th is regard, im p r o v e d 
env i ronmen ta l m o n i t o r i n g was needed. Some pa r t ic ipan ts vo iced support f o r the Bank ’s 
e f fo r ts at im p r o v i n g rangelands and p ro tec t ing forests. One pa r t ic ipan t suggested that the 
B a n k c o u l d consider assisting in the management o f rad ioac t ive ta i l ings . 

Strengthen P u b l i c Governance and the P r iva te Sector. Pa r t ic ipan ts agreed with the Bank ’s 
focus o n establishing an appropriate r o l e f o r the p u b l i c sector, and n o t e d f o u r areas in

Gove rnmen t manage o i l and n o n - o i l ex t rac t ive revenues in a m o r e transparent manner, 
and t o use excess revenues f o r soc ia l and env i ronmen ta l purposes in a sustainable
