EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

From Crisis to Growth-Pakistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy

1. 
Palistan has started the new millennium with more hope. Starting from a position of extreme
vulnerability at the end of the i990s-a financiai crisis, domestic tensions, and external isolation-it has
achieved a remarkable turnaround. A major factor behind this turnaround is strong leadership in the
country with internal cohesion and a clear sense of direction. The latter is manifested in the interim-
Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP) anchored in a comprehensive reform program for poverty reducing
growth, human development, and governance improvement. The government is engaged in fundamental
political, institutional, economic, social and gender transformation for Pakistan's transition to a modern
Islamic state.

2. 
The government implemented a far reaching devolution program which led to locally elected
officials with the legitimacy and mandate to improve public service delivery. Women were given more
voice than in the past (33 percent of the total local governments seats were reserved for them and the
number of reserved seats was tripled in the future national and provincial assemblies). Despite severe
shocks-the worst drought in decades-GDP at factor cost grew by 2.7 percent in 2000/01; inflation is
low and reserves have reached US$3.5 billion on March 31, 2002, one third of imnorts, their hiehest
level in a decade. The government formulated a credible education and health reform strategy. It started

alon a nro-poor public works program to ease the impacts of the eononmic C hncks and the drought.

develop human capital, improve the investment climate, and increase productivity growth to bring the
economy to the 5-6 perce.nt annual growth rate ach.ipeved irn earlier decades, or even higher, 
to
significantly reduce poverty.

Bank Group Strategy

5. 
The main goal of the Bank Group's Assistance Strategy is to support these fundamental reforms
for a transition to a modern islamic state t'nrough a program of analytical services, institutionai capacity
building, and demand-pull lending. The triggers underpinning the Bank Group's assistance strategy will
be based on measurable outcomes wnich have the MDGs as a frame of reference in alignment with
corporate priorities and global public goods.

6. 
The Bank Group CAS has been shaped by: (i) the lessons learned from the implementation of the
past Bank Group CAS in Pakistan, including IFC's and MIGA's experiences as investors and advisors;
(ii) the results of the 2000 Client Survey; and (iii) the concerns of Pakistani women and men expressed
during the extensive consultations held by the Bank Group all through 2000.

Strategic Engagement Principles

7. 
The Bank Group's support will be guided by three strategic engagement principles: (i) Strong
"client pull" to reform and selectivity; (ii) A programmatic approach focused on transfer of knowledge

and canacitv building first: and resources second. in a flexible nursuit of key development outcomes: and
(iii) Partnerships and Outreach.

8. 

Selectivity. The Bank Group's strategic priorities will be subdivided into three categories: (i)

Dee.p engaeTmnnt; (ii) Low enganement: aind (iii) Mnnitnrinor LFC.'s investment±q and mmlrtnart will also

depend on progress in establishing a competitive market framework.

Business Areas for Deep Engagement. While cooperating with other donors, the Bank Group

* Business Areasfor Low Engagement. The Bank Group will keep a low level of engagement in
areas where the client has been "reform-shy" such as for urban development and transport or
where there have been reversals of reforms or slow progress. The Bank Group will focus on
analytical services and leveraging the resources of WBI to play an advocacy role to encourage

reforns.

* Business Areas With No-Lending Services. These are areas where the Bank would monitor
developments such as on areas where the IMF has comparative advantage (macroeconomic
stabilization); areas where the reforms are on-going (sometimes with other donors suDDort) or
need only IFC or MIGA's engagement (capital markets, SMEs); and areas where the
commitment to reform is verv low. Areas of business from which the Bank has disengaged
completely will also figure in this category. This includes financing physical investments in

therefore be more effectively supported by multi-year programs-both at the national, provincial, and
district level-hence the need for a progralmaiuc approach ior iie Banki Group's assistance strategy.
The system wide reforms being envisaged for example for the tax administration (CBR), the institutions
in charge of financial management (the Comptroller Generai of Accounts, the Auditor General's Office),
the civil service, also require a programmatic approach.

10. 
Programmatic Instruments. The instruments used under this CAS follow directly from the
strategy. The Bank will use (i) policy based fast disbursing lending to pursue the economic management

and governance agenda at both the federal and provincial levels and the sectoral reform agenda (finance,
power); (ii) programmatic sector and investment lending to support the implementation of the reforms to
improve the economic and social infrastructure and delivery systems for education and health, and
community infrastructure services (including water management) at all levels of governments; and (iii)

analvtical work and other non-lending serviceS to monitor develonments in the areas of low en,eagement

and encourage reforms. The Bank Group will use its non-lending services to build a coherent strategy for

the government's reform program and its I-PRSP. The Bank Group will continue under this CAS its
ciose collaboraton with the ivr, the AsDB, ana UN agencies (basea on eacn msmtunon-s comparatve
advantage). Facilitating partnerships and donor coordination by the Bank will assume an even greater
role over the CAS period now that sanctions have been lifted and many bilaterai donors are reviewing
their assistance strategy to Pakistan with a view of scaling it up. An important complement to
partnership is the Bank Group's overall outreach. The Bank has increased its interactions with the
different levels of governments, the Pakistan media, civil society, and business community to establish
partnerships based on a shared vision for Pakistan's development.

Bank Group Program Priorities

12. 
The Bank Group's program priorities will be focused on the reforms to (i) strengthen
macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (ii) improve the business environment for
growth; and (iii) improve equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender equity policies.

Strengthening the Basis for Macroeconomic Stability and Government Effectiveness

13. 
Macroeconomic Stability. The Bank will support in partnership with the IME the macro-
economic stabilization program agenda to restore fiscal sustainability, reduce internal and external debt,
and improve the competitiveness of the economy through supportive trade, monetary, and exchange rate
policies. The Bank Group's key contributions will be in improving public expenditure management and
supporting reforms of tax administration, safe and sound banling, efficient public utilities, and structural
fiscal and governance reforms. In particular, the Bank will continue to carrv out the annual reviews of
the Government's Public Sector Development Program at the federal level and will complete a National

Public Pxnenditure Review in FY03.

governance and corruption diagnostic surveys and institutional capacity building for oversight and
monitoring. Thiis will be done through training :i uthe areas of public expenditure and financial
accountability, media development, and the interaction between parliament and the Auditor General,
including support to strengthening legislative oversight once parliament is reinstated.

Strengthening the Enabling investment Cidmate

16. 
Tne Bank Group's support to strengthening the investment climat'e -will include a combination of
analytical work and financial assistance targeted to reforms in key sectors. The Bank Group will
continue to encourage the federal and provincial governments to pursue the trade liberaiization and
modernization of industrial, business and labor regulations that are already under way. To build the
knowledge base to underpin the policy dialogue on private sector development, the Bank Group pians to
carry out a significant program of analytical work. 
In addition to a Development Policy Review
(completed in FY02) which provides the Bank's assessment of the adequacy of the current development
policy agenda, including for rural development, to achieve rapid growth and poverty reduction; the Bank
will complete in FY03 an Investment Climate and Economic Performance Study. The latter aims to
relate key aspects of the investment climate (basic economic infrastructure, and regulatory and
governance frameworks) with the performance and productivity of private manufacturing firms, small
and large. An analysis of the trade regime will also be undertaken in FY03. 
In addition to the
governance reforms which have a direct bearing on the investment climate, the Bank Group will also
continue to support financially the reforms of the governance and regulatory environment for power, gas,
oil, financial sector, pricing and tariffs reforms, and privatization, as well as support to provincial and
district governurients reforms to iimprove the quality of basic infrastructure and social services.

!7. 
WC will suRport the development of new nroducts to better meet the needs of the private sector
(e.g., long-term finance for infrastructure), and expand access to financial services to new clients (e.g.,
the bankable poor through micro-finance or leasing institlutinns), and to the under-serve4 small and
medium enterprises sector.

Supporting Pro-Poor and Pro-Gender-Equity Policies

18. 

The Bank Group will support the I-PRSP's core objective to empower people by creating greater

opportuait-es for increasing real 

incomnes by irnpov,ing ac.ess to 

eAduc,ation and hnealth e, ic

especially for girls, and to safety nets programs. The Bank's support to these three areaLs-promoting

education and healtih, supportirg pro-poor rural developrrent and cormmunity ifastucture, as well as

supporting targeted poverty alleviation programs reflect their importance as well as the Bank's
comparative advantage.

the fiscal and economic reforms of Sindh and NWFP to start with. The support could also include advice
and technicai assistance to reform higher education.

20. 
The Bank Group assistance to health sector reforms, will support the government s priority of
strengthening the public health programs-immunization, communicable diseases such as malaria, TB,
HIYV/AIDS; and maternal and child health and family planning. To this effect, the Bank will use multiple
instruments, including analytical work, technical assistance, policy dialogue, and adjustment and
investment lending as appropriate. 
IFC will seek opportunities to invest in private education and
healthcare providers.

21. 
Supporting the rural sector through community-based infrastructure projects (particularly for
water supply and sanitation services) and the spread of micro-credit have been part of the Bank Group's
strategy to reduce and mitigate risks for Pakistan's poor. The Bank will continue, under this CAS, to
pilot new approaches, and also help scale up those which have proven effective such as the Community
Infrastructure and Services Proiect (CIP) and the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF). The NGO-
implemented program of building social and physical capital and extending micro-credit schemes under
the PPAF is a very successful scheme which will be scaled up during the coming CAS. The on-going
PPAF has already provided loans to over 60,000 borrowers, over two thirds of which are women. A

nocial rick aqqeqnment is also planned for FY03 which will also help undernin the Rank Grun'ps

integration of social protection in the Bank's future operations.

23. 
A significant program of analytical work is also planned to show the opportunities that gender-
responsive policies create for enhanced growth and poverty reduction. The Bank, the government, and
the other donors, including UNDP and DFID, have been working together 
to strengthen the
govenment's analytic capacity on gender sensitive policies. The Bank has a Poverty Assessment
underway, with a survey geared to capturing gender issues with a view of informing public policy
regarding the formulation of a gender strategy. A Country Gender Assessment is planned for FY04,
which would provide 
the knowledge base for future Bank's policy dialogue and operational
interventions.

for the high case over FY03-05. The Bank will resume IBRD lending under the high case starting from
FY04. Tnree iending scenarios (low, base, and high case) combining in base and high case policy based
lending and investment lending are outlined for FY03-05. The lending scenarios will be guided by two
sets of triggers; (i) entry and exit triggers linked to provincial reforms; and (ii) global triggers linked to
each of the three pillars of the assistance strategy, macroeconomic stability and govemrance, enabling
environment for private investment, and human development.

26. 
JFC and MIGA. Future investment will depend on further progress mi key policy reforms to
open up opportunities for private investment. 
lFC's ability to do new business is constrained by its
ability to provide competitive financing. IFC's equity and foreign currency loans are unattractive because
of the high country risk premium. 
IFC is therefore exploring providing local currency financing by
means of partial credit guarantees. MIGA's portfolio is diverse, covering 7 investments in the financial,
infrastructure, and manufacturing sectors. Over the last two years, foreign investors in general have
adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Palistan, which is reflected in the small number of projects that
MIGA has underwritten.

27. 
Non-Lendinz Services will be used to support the PRSP process, strengthen governance reforms
at both the federal and provincial levels, and support capacity building and knowledge sharing. To
recapitulate. over the period FYOO-02. the Bank Group would have completed a CPAR, a CFAA, a
National Public Expenditure Review (PER), a Development Policy Review (DPR), a Poverty

Assessment. a Provincial Finances Renort. A Puniab PER- and a number of other important policy notes.

Over FY03-05, the Bank Group non-lending services will include a Financial Sector Assessment (FY03),
a (FAATT 
FY03), a National Pu blic Expenditure Review (FY04), Provincial Economwic R12ports (FY03-

Risk Management. Pakistan's economy iaces serious cnallenges and major risks emanating
from a variety of internal and external sources. The main risks associated with this CAS are:

29. 
There is unavoidable uncertainty about the sustained implementation of the reform agenda
outlined in the I-PRSP post October 2002, particularly in the face of domestic oppositionL from vested
interest, possible future opposition to the modernizing policies introduced by this government; in
particular the reform of the elementary education system, including the attempt to regulate: the Madaris
(religious schools), and the pro-gender equity policies. The government has rightly decided not to
complete the full PRSP until after the new government is in office to ensure that it endorses it. Hence,
continuity and change issues will be discussed in a CAS Progress Report after the full PRSP is completed

build capacity. The complacency risk is mitigated by the sound, if daunting, debt reduction strategy
wnich has been under implementation for the past three years to rapidly restore creditwortniness and
reduce over-reliance on International Financial Institutions' financing.

31. 
There are also several other risks to the achievement of the poverty reduction outcomes. The
low tax/GDP ratio may prove difficult to raise significantly over the next three years. Lower growth
caused by the impact on exports of a longer than expected global slowdown or protracted military
operations in Afghanistan, or weather related shocks to agricultural output. These shocks could be, in
part, weathered by the floating exchange rate regime but would have also to be met through a
combination of additional adjustment measures and external financing-none of which can be taken for
granted. If concurrent with timid debt relief, exogenous shocks would also delay the return to external
sustainability, which is a key condition to achieving Pakistan's growth and poverty reduction objectives.

32. 
The portfolio risks are manageable in this CAS period. Credit worthiness indicators are moving
in the right direction (though the preferred creditor ratio will continue to increase as debt rescheduling
decreases the share of bilateral debt in total debt). To manage this risk, however, IBRD lending is
planned only under the high case and starting in FY04 when the uncertainty regarding continuitv of
reform would have been resolved. Given on-going repayments, this leads to negative net IBRD lending.

33. 

The Bank Group support program is self-adjusting to mitigate the risk of reform derailment.

Substantial lending will continue only as long as Pakistan continues its excellent imnlementation

performance of the past two years. Adjustment lending is subject to Pakistan being "on track" in

imlplentning the. pnvPertv reduition and economir management sttegy, including those under the

PRGF.

I. POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT-A TURBULENT DECADE

A. 

From Crisis to Growth

1. 
Pakistan entered the new millennium with more hope. Starting from a position of extreme
vulnerability at the end of the 1990s-a financial crisis, domestic tensions, and external isolation-it has
achieved a remarkable turnaround. A maior factor behind this turnaround is strong leadershin in the
country with internal cohesion and a clear sense of direction. The latter is manifested in the Interim

more voice than in the past (33 percent of the total local governments seats were reserved for them and
tne nlumber of reserved seats was tripled in 'the futuLe national an.d provuicial assemb.blies). Despite se-vere
shocks-including the worst drought in decades-GDP at factor cost grew by 2.7 percent in 2000/01;
inflation remained low at 4.4 percent, and reserves have reached US$3.5 billion on March 31, 2002, one
third of imports, their highest level in a decade. The government formulated a credible education and
health reform strategy. 
It started also a pro-poor public works program to ease the impacts of the
economic shock and the drought.

3. 
Pakistan, however, still faces formidable challenges (political, attitudinal, and policy) to fully
develop human capital, improve the investment climate, and increase productivity growth to bring the
economy to the 5-6 percent annual growth rate achieved in earlier decades, or even higher, to
significantly reduce poverty.

B. 

Development Challenges

4. 
Pakistan's past track record as a reformer has been erratic. Over the previous decade, Pakistan
had failed to complete on schedule any of the nine programs supported by Fund arrangements. Progress
was made in some areas, particularly on trade liberalization and banking sector reform; and reversal of
reforms has been rare. Successive governments started off well with ambitious home grown reform
programs but failed to carry through sustained reform. This undermined investors' confidence and
prevented lasting improvements in the fiscal and external positions, as well as human development.

5. 
Pakistan became more inward looking in the 1990s at a time when competing Asian economies
were aggressively integrating into the global economy (see Annex II). A large share of Pakistan's private
sector was content with onerating behind hi h nrotective harriers and snecial 
seeking behavior often referred to as the Statutory Rule Order (SRO) culture-or "tailor made

(Muslim religion-based seminaries). The radicalization of some of these institutions started with their
politicization during the ;980s. with active support from, tne Zia regime (;977-;988), Madaris with
extremist administrations were established along the Pakistan-Afghan border. The objective was to form
a cadre of religiously motivated "Mujahideen 
to fight in Afghanistan and provide political support to
Zia's regime. Madaris degrees were made equivalent to degrees obtained from formal universities. This
facilitated recruitment of Madaris students into the civil service, leading to the state's accommodation of
activities encouraging religious intolerance and sectarian divides.

11. 
The contribution of these "Mujahideen" to the Afghan victory, poverty, falling standards of
public education, and weak governance, account for much of the success of the Madaris in the 1990s.
Since they provided free boarding and lodging, they became popular with the parents of poor children
and a steady stream of Afghans fleeing the factional fighting in Afghanistan. Marginalized, the graduates
from the non-mainstreamed Madaris (those which did not include the formal education curricula) with no
career-oriented education, resorted to violence to influence 
the country's policies. 
Successive
governments did little to restrain them or bring them into the' mainstream education system. 
It is
estimated that 15-20 percent of the Madaris are involved in military related teachings and training.

opportunities for closer regional integration. wnile over tie meuium-term Pakistan s gro-wth potential
may be enhanced by Afghanistan's reconstruction plan, in the short-run, the war in Afghanistan, and its
spillovers to Paidstan, and tensions aiong the border with India, are adding to the political turmoii and
raising the risk of doing business in Pakistan.

13. 
Third, Pakistan's poor and deteriorating governance has accentuated the political and social
turmoil. Since 1990 four democratically elected governments have been dismissed, three of them on
corruption charges. The frequent changes of government over the 1 990s and the ensuing unpredictability
of the policy stance undermined business confidence. At the core of the governance problem is the abuse
of the state's institutions, widespread corruption, and disregard for the separation of powers and respect
for the rule of law.

Service Delivery in Crisis

14. 
Pakistan is a federation of 4 provinces-Punjab, North West Frontier Province (NWFP),
Balochistan, and Sindh-seven tribal areas (excluding five tribal areas adjoining settled areas called as
Frontier regions); and the Northern Areas. Pakistan's 1973 constitution grants major responsibility to the
provinces for regulat6rv oversight, provision of infrastructure (including irrigation and agricultural
extension services) and social services. The provinces account for 80 percent of total government

snendinp on health. education. and irrigation 

In contrast- and contrarv to exnerience with other fedemlil

countries, tax authority is concentrated at the federal level. The federal govemment revenue transfers

funding, delivery, and quality of social services (education, health, rural water supply and sanitation).
Similar pro-vincial infras-tucLure deficits (roads, irrination and drainage, and municipai serices) increase
the cost of doing business and impose a heavy burden on the economy and the general public. Vital
irrigation water services are unreliable and controlied by antiquated, non-transparent and unresponsive
departments. The multiplicity of provincial regulatory agencies harass the private sector and discourage
entrepreneurship and economic activity. The police is widely perceived as ineffective and corrupt, while
the judicial services are subject to long delays and are also seen as sometimes corrupt and out of reach of
the average citizen, let alone the poor.

16. 
There is a tremendous opportunity for the provinces to turn around the performance of their
public sector. The following factors are conducive to reform.

* There is a reforming government at the federal level, which has put at the heart of its poverty
reduction strategy a program of reforms to foster growth and reduce poverty.

* The provinces-particularly Sindh and NWFP-have already initiated a number of promising
reforms to restore good governance, improve their public finances and public service delivery.

introduction of a floating exchange rate regime. The tightening of anti-money laundering measures in
US, Europe, and the Gulf countries has also triggered a large repatriation of holdings abroad by Pakistani
residents through the official banking channel since end-September.

record of macroeconomic policy and structural reform implementation. This laid the ground for a three-
year support program under the Poverty Reduction and Growin Facility (PRGF), approved in November
2001. The first review of the PRGF program was successfully completed in end-March 2002.

21. 
The international community's response post September 11 helped reduce the financing gap.
T he US provided direct budgetary support of US$600 miilion to protect spending on heaith, education,
and anti-poverty programs and cover some of the cost due to the increased number of Afghan refugees.
Other donors (Japan, UK, EU, Canada and European countries) also contributed. The external financing
package which is supported by the IMF (PRGF-US$1.25 billion over FY02-04) includes UJS$3.3 billion
in debt relief from the Paris Club over the next three years. However, despite these favorable
developments, the external and domestic public debt are both quite large and hence there are still
concerns over the fragility of the external position and future growth prospects. The September 11 shock
has also increased the longer term risks to the balance of payment position by making more uncertain an
early resumption of long-term private capital inflows as well as increased access to international capital
markets.

II. PAKISTAN'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

22. 
Soon after the military coup, the new government issued a seven-point agenda to revive the
economy, root out endemic corruption, depoliticize state institutions, devolve power to the grass-root
level, and imDrove checks and balances and democratic processes in society. 
In December 1999.
following broad national consultations, 
the government announced its development strategy which
focused on: (i) strengthening governance and the integritv of the civil service; (ii) creatihng opponrtnities
through accelerating growth of agriculture, small and medium scale industries, informaticin technology,

newly elected government takes office (A Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) on the I-PRSP was discussed by
tne Boards of tne Bank and tne iME on December 4, and 6, 200i, respectively). A referendum was held
on April 30, 2002 in which President Musharraf sought voters confidence for a five-year presidential
mandate, arguing that this is the only way to ensure sustaina'bility of the on-going reforms. National and
Provincial elections are to be held between October 1-11 with the transfer of power andl formation of
federal and provincial governments to take place shortly after.

A. 

Restoring Sustainable and Rapid Growth

23. 
The govemment recognizes that the incidence of poverty and the vulnerability of the poor will
not be reduced without sustained, broad based economic growth. This growth can only be generated and
sustained by the private sector. For this to happen, a reasonable investment climate is required with a
policy framework that provides ample room for private firms, small and large, to invest and create jobs in
agriculture, industry, and services. The government's main preoccupation has therefore been to improve

to flourish.

rigntly stresses that these fiscal iargets hinge upon the realization
of the government's projected revenue increase. 
Implementation of CBR reform, and measures to
broaden tne tax base, including bringing agricuitural income in the tax net, and eliminate tax exemptions,
are therefore crucial. The strategy also seeks to re-orient expenditures towards the social sectors by
reducing the costs of domestic debt, public enterprises, and defense spending (see graphs below).

In alUmuon TO MaCrOeCOnomic StaDiuity ana governance
improvemenit, reforms in this area focused on reducing the level of protection through de-regulation,
trade liberalization, tariffs reduction and rationalization, and policy reforms to raise productivity and
reduce the cost of doing business through privatization or more efficient public services.

26. 

In power, the vision is to build a competitive electric power system consisting of autonomous,

financially viable, and efficiently operated entities governed by an independent regulatory authority.
Commercialization leading to privatization forms the cornerstone of the government's power sector
reforms, which requires credible pricing and regulatory frameworks to improve efficiency and attract
private investment.

27. 
Despite the Government's commitment to this vision, progress in implementing it has been
painfully slow. The four year old National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has not been
able to play its regulatory role effectively because of lack of capacity and weaknesses in the regulatory
framework regarding tariff setting policy. It has not been able to find a balance between the interests of
consumers and producers. 
Improvements in the operational performances of the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) and the Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation (KESC) also have
lagged. In fact, the government recognizes that the large losses of KESC may endanger some of its fiscal
achievements and poses therefore an important risk for macroeconomic balances. Adjustments in tariffs
have been largely inadequate to finance the viability of nower sunnliers.

28. 

Natural Gas. The natural gas sector has significant potenttsl

savings (estimated to be about US$500 million a year), efficiency gains as well as environmental

benefits. 
Its development has been stifled, however, by insufficient investment in exploration and
production, inadequate infrastructure, administered prices, heavy taxation and disproportionate cross-
subsidies. The government strategy is to establish a credible, market-based mricing frameworlk across the
production, transmission and distribution chain. The govermment also intends to privatize Pakistan
Petrnleuim T.imited (PPT.) the largest nroducer of gas and two Transmission and Distribution utilities.

29. 
The cnmerstone of this reform is the imnlementation of a new gas tariff nolicy. For gas
production, well-head gas prices will now be linked to intemational crude prices. The price of gas

of the three government-owned LPG plants has been privatized. Markets have been further deregulated;
oil marketing companies and large consumers are now free to import all products. Petroleum products
prices are set on a fortnightly basis consistent with import parity levels. Pakistan is the first country in
South Asia to adopt automatic adjustment formuiae for petroleum prices. Subsidies to the refineries are
now budgeted. Environmental standards have been strengthened but continue to suffer from poor
enforcement. Unleaded gasoline is now available across most of the country. There is, however, a need
to enhance competition throughout the distribution chain. Pakistan has considerable mineral resources
which, if properly developed, could contribute to job creation, economic growth, and poverty reduction.
The federal government has formulated a new Mineral Development Policy which is now helping shape
activities in Provinces. The Sindh Coal Authority has been established and is now preparing a
developmental and promotional action plan.

31. 
Infrastructure. The government has developed a National Transport Policy to improve the
quality of services and reduce their costs. It has refocused its priorities. For roads, there is a welcome
shift at the national level towards operations and maintenance, cost recovery (mobilizing additional
revenues through tolls earmarked for road maintenance), completion of existing projects, and scaling
back nreviouslv large projects. Provincial governments (notably Sindh and NWFP) are starting to
replicate some of these reforms. Last year's major effort to turnaround the railways department has

competition in ail market segments. Since Pakistan Telecommunication Limited's (PTCL) monopoly
over fixed line services expires at the end of 2002, the government is preparing for liberalization by
licensing operators in basic, long distance, and internationai service provision.

33. 

Financial Sector Reforms have been accelerated. T he government believes that the best way to
insulate the banking sector from political interference is to privatize all Nationalized Commercial Banks
(NCBs) and consolidate (restructure, merge, or liquidate) the Development Finance Corporations.

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy 

9

Accordingly, tne strategy incluues ine privauzauon o0 two INCBs kriaDio B5anK Li1mted iiBL), and

United Bank Limnited (UBL)) within the tenure of the current government and preparing a third bank
National Bank of Paidstan (N.BP) for privatization.

34. 
Tne tnree large nationalized commercial baniks are being restructured to reduce tneir costs and
make them more attractive for privatization. More than 8,000 staff have opted for voluntary retirement
and 650 branches have been closed, mostly in urban areas. The National Finance Development
Corporation-the largest state-owned non-bank financial institution-has been merged with the National
Bank of Pakistan. The government has divested 6 percent of its shares in Muslim Commercial Bank, and
is committed to sell off the remaining 9 percent. For Allied Bank Limited, the Privatization Commission
has already advertised for a block sale of Government's 49 percent shareholding. The strengthening of
prudential regulations continues.

35. 
The government is working on removing the uncertainty arising from the implication of the
application of the Shariah code to all financial transactions which has held potential investors at bay.
The government considers that Islamic banling should be viewed as an opportunity to diversify the
supply of financial products and deepen financial intermediation. The 'government is therefore seeking
Supreme Court approval for a dual approach where traditional and Islamic finance institutions would
coexist. The first Islamic bank (with 90 percent investment from a consortium which includes the
Islamic Development Bank and 10 percent from Societe Generale) has iust been established. Te State
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) intends also to rely on other countries' experiences of such a dual approach to

imrIovement in uje nianagelment ofuna. uilUl reso-5rces, particularly watcr. Gi-ven tnc on-going drough-t,

the I-PRSP focuses on expanding water storage, by building new dams. There is, however, a welcome
emphiatsis on a realistic pricing of water and better recovery of user cnarges, and improved water
conservation and management-particularly to address saline soils and water logging in the Indus Basin
irrigation system-to protect the long-term sustainability of agriculture in Paicstan. The strategy gives
increased emphasis also to investment in on-farm water management (OFWM), recognizing the cost-
effectiveness of this participatory approach at community level relative to other alternatives. A water
management strategy that analyzes access, distribution, and pricing is therefore crucially needed.

B. 

Restoring the Integrity and Accountability of State Institutions

37. 
Improving Government Effectiveness has been and remains the hallmark of this government's
reform program. The far reaching set of reforms to improve governance are all at an advanced stage of
implementation. These include: (i) reforrns of some of the country's fundamental institutions of
economic and financial management: the Central Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Central Board of Revenue
(CBR), the Auditor General and Controller General of Accounts, the police, the judicial system, and the
civil service; (ii) improved public financial management, accountability, and increased transparency and
information on government activities to facilitate public oversight; (iii) devolution; (iv) an anti-
corruption drive; and (v) privatization and deregulation to reduce incentives for rent-seeking behavior.

lo 

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy

38. 
After detailed analytical work, 
including widespread consultations, a strategy for the
fundamental reform of the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) was approved by the Cabinel: in October
2001. The strategy was translated into an action plan using the recommendations of the Task Force for
the Reform of the Central Board of Revenue. A new CBR management has assumed the leadership for
its implementation.

39. 
To improve public financial management and accountability, the government has implemented
fundamental structural reforms to strengthen the audit and accounting functions. 
It has lpromulgated
ordinances establishing the autonomy, powers, and respective responsibilities of the Auditor General and
the Office of the Controller General of Accounts. Ad-hoc Public Accounts Committees (PACs) have been
set up at both the Federal and Provincial levels to clear the backlog of Audit Reports not yet reviewed,
and take appropriate follow-up action. For the first time in more than a decade, the Federal Public
Accounts Committee is reviewing the accounts of a government in office. The proceedings of the Federal
PAC have been onened to the media and it is exnected that the nractice will be extended to thle Provincial
PACs. The government is establishing a National Procurement Authority to lead the process of change

below. As part of this proraLm, dUrig tLle next two yers, Pakistanl will: (i) imp-rove its ex-penditure
management through the implementation of a medium-term budget framework; and (ii) publish the
government's quarterly fiiscai accounts to enaDie pubiic monitoring of budget implementation. 
in
addition, Fiscal Monitoring Committees (FMCs) have been set up at the Federal and Provincial levels to
monitor the preparation of reconciled and accurate accounts. Civil service reforms now include an entry
and exit strategy, training, consolidation of functions, simpler procedures, and a phased program of pay
and pension reforms.

41. 
The Government's far. reaching Access to Justice Reform Program focuses on police and
judiciary reforms. The government is keen on creating an environment that respects the rule of law,
protects property, and offers its citizens, particularly the poor, access to an independent and professional
justice and police.

42. 
Devolution. The government expects that the devolution of power to local governments will play
a major role in putting in place an institutional framework that would make the public sector more
accountable to the users and more efficient at delivering basic social services-basic education, primary
health care, rural water and sanitation, policing, justice, and other forms of community infrastructure.
Local government elections were completed as scheduled in August 2001. Building the administrative
capacity to govern and providing the financial resources to deliver these services are, howvever, yet to
come. Fiscal devolution to allow local Boverments to fulfill the service deliverv asRionments ic

overall framework-Education Sector Reform (ESR), launched in 2001-laying down the foundation for
ute Education For All agenda; (ii) a major Scnooi Rehabilitation Program; (iii) a Teacner Training
Program; (iv) Learning Centers at the District Level which aim at universalizing access to primary
education, with a special focus on giris (covering the entire eiementary stage of education for ages 6-14);
(v) Public/Private Partnerships; providing public funding for low cost private education through the
Education Foundations (the government has also taken the lead in restructuring the National Education
Foundation providing it with greater autonomy under the Societies Act); and (v) a National Education
Assessment System (NEAS) to measure outcomes by enabling stakeholders in the elementary education
system to understand how well the elementary education system in Palistan is performing and to design
targeted interventions to improve the system to achieve desired learning outcomes. In addition, the ESR
encompasses new innovative programs in examination reform, video textbook libraries, a comprehensive
literacy program, early childhood education and an "adopt a school" program. The Federal Minister is
now in charge of donor coordination and is looking for assistance with the implementation of these
various components, including experience with school feeding programs and use of vouchers.

47. 
The Islamabad Capital Territory has been used to test ideas and encourage reforms by piloting a
number of the initiatives included in the ESR. These include the recruitment of teachers on school
specific contracts, introducing training programs for head teachers and learning centers to improve

teachers' academic knowledge- ungrading entrv qualificatinns for teachers and intrnducning a teacher-

focused code of ethics to address chronic teacher absenteeism. Federal transfers are also being used to

encourage reform. 

in this context, federai fundimg nas been ngniiy reiocuseu on rexwEilULIrng UIW

existing infrastructure-with funding targeted to rehabilitating those schools which are in worst
conditions. 
Federal funding is also being put where it is expected to have catalytic impact on
performance. The budget for the NEAS has been doubled and is linked to outcomes. A Human
Development Task Force is also working on a program to build district capacities for service delivery
through pilot initiatives referred to as "incubators". The latter are expected to serve as role models for
district staff and below to better deliver social services. A Human Development Commission has also
been set up to coordinate initiatives to further public private partnerships.

48. 
In parallel with the federal government's ESR initiative, provincial governments are also
beginning to put in place measures that address some of the most fundamental problems of the system,
such as calling teachers to account throuigh a re-certification process, linking pay with performance
(through monitoring attendance), hiring new teachers on school specific contracts, and exploring ways to
use under utilized school buildings. Each province has started to seriously monitor teacher attendance.
To improve facilities, the focus is on maintenance rather than new investment. Education departments

50. 
Tne goveunment's meuiunm term- health strategy under the I-PRSP is rightly cu;uunntauing on
prevention and control programs, especially in the area of reproductive health, child health, nutrient
deficiencies and communicable diseases. Programs include adoption of updated strategies against TB5
and malaria, introduction of Hepatitis B vaccination and plans of response to HIV/AIDS. The IPRSP
includes targets for 2003/04 for reducing child mortality, increasing the number of Lady Hiealth Workers
(See Box 3), reducing the prevalence of malnutrition among pre-school children, and increasing
contraceptive prevalence rate, among others.

51. 
Strengthening public-private sector partnerships features strongly in the Health Policy reform as
well as making more effective use of existing facilities and skills. It is proposed, for exampile, that every
medical college in the public and private sector be required to adopt at least one district hospital or
primary health facility in addition to the teaching hospital affiliated to it. Reforms of the regulatory
environment are also being considered.

52. 
A start has been made already to improve personnel management. In the health sector, NWFP
and Punjab are increasingly resorting to contract employment in an effort to reduce absenteeism and fill
vacancies in remote rural areas. The provinces have also started to strengthen management for the
deliverv of social services at district level. To this effect, they have redeployed staff from the provincial
to district level. Of the four provinces, NWFP is by far the most advanced in decentralizing staff from

the center to the distrinct level facilities where they are most needed-

and offenses related to Qazf (false accusation relating to women chastity). 
under the nudood
ordinances, the testimony of adult Muslim males is the only admissible evidence and this has created
many instances of egregious arbitrariness and discrimination against women. Besides the Hudood
ordinances, other discriminatory laws include the Qanoon-e-Shahadat (law of evidence), Qisas (covers
retribution) and Diyat (covers blood money).

55. 
Beyond changes in the laws, the government is also seeking to improve women's voice and
access to resources by increasing their political representation and reducing their vulnerability to rule of
law violations. A third of local council seats have been reserved for women (resulting in a total of
36,007 women elected across all four provinces). On January 17, 2002, the governmenlt announced a
tripling in the number of seats reserved for women under the future National Assembly from 20 to 60.
Women's rePresentation in the future provincial assemblies will also be increased. This is a clear break
from the past. The government is receiving a significant level of technical assistance from bilateral
donors and UN agencies to implement the reform agenda for gender eouitv in Palistan.

56. 
A number of targeted interventions, such as Pakistan Bait-ul-mal (BPM). the Pa!kistan Povertv
Alleviation Fund (PPAF), the Zakat Foundation, are used also to provide assistance to poor women and
children 
direct financial and medical assistance, and
educational stipends. The government has also established the Khushali Bank (micro credit bank) to

their implementation and monitoring, increasing transfers, and extending the targeting to reach a further
1.5 miilion benenfciaries. For example, the government's Knusnal Pakistan Program, as iaid out in the i-
PRSP, attempts to improve targeting by incorporating active community participation. As district
governments start functioning under the devolution program, the government expects Khushal Pakistan
to gain further importance and local ownership (See the Poverty Assessment and the DPR).

m. THE BANK GRoup's ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OVER FY03-05

A. 

Overview of Bank Group Strategy

58. 
The government of Pakistan is engaged in fundamental reform for a historical transition of the
country to modernity. These reforms cover a broad spectrum-politics, institutions, economic, gender,
and social. They provide a clear break with the past, especially regarding gender equity. The main goal
of the Bank Group's Assistance Strategy is to support these fundamental reforms for a transition to a
modern Islamic State through a program of analytical services, institutional capacity building, and
demand driven lending. The triggers underpinning the operationalization of the Bank Group's assistance
strategy will be based on measurable outcomes which have the MDGs as a frame of reference in
alignment with corporate priorities and global public goods.

The Bank Group CAS will also be shaped by: (i) the lessons learnt from the implementation of
the past Bank Group CAS in Paiistan, including iFC`s and MIGA;s experiences as investors and
advisors; (ii) the results of the 2000 Client Survey; and (iii) the concerns of Pakistani women and men
expressed during the extensive consultations held by the Bank Group all through 2000 (see Annex I).
There was no Country Assistance Evaluation by the Operations Evaluation Department.

60. 
Lessons from the On-Going Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy. Experience with
implementation of the on-going CAS has been positive and has taught a number of lessons.

* The Bank's shift in emphasis towards knowledge transfer (to underpin policy advice) and
capacity building has paid off.

> Significant policy reforms took place in a number of areas without financial assistance. This
was particularly successful in energy and transport, where no sector specific lending took

16 

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy

place over the past 10 years, yet the dialogue continued and reforms have progressed. And
financial sector reforms were deepened well before any financial assistance accrued. The
large and eff-ective pro-poor public works program is another important example of a positive
outcome arising out of the dialogue with the Government.

> The partnership between the Bank Group and the Government of Pakistan has been
strengthened. The latter camne to see the Bank Group as a committed development partner
and not solely a lending institution. This was true both at the federal as well as provincial
levels where the Bank became a more engaged partner in encouraging provinces to reform
and support their efforts through analytical services and policy dialogue.

* The substantial progress in macroeconomic management at the federal level and weaker policy
and implementation performance at the provincial and sector levels (fiscal, power, agriculture,
irrigation, infrastructure, including water and sanitation, and human development) led the Bank
to refocus its assistance on the provincial reforms and on the cross-cutting governance

attractive investments often have low economic value added, further limiting opportunities for
LE- s catalytic role for private invesunent in Pakistan.

* Tne message from tne experience of the Social Action Program (SAP) is to focus Bank's
support on helping the government improve the governance structures (systematically not
topically) that underpin service delivery and help achieve results in the MDGs areas of health
and education. The message from the implementation of the National Drainage Program is that
fundamental institutional reforms require high level political commitment and "champions" to
lead them. Sindh is showing the way in this respect and reforms are progressing well.

61. 
Client Survey Results. The lessons from the client survey echo those from the implementation
of the CAS. They stress the need to (i) sharpen the Banks Group's assistance priorities; (ii) increase the
poverty focus across the spectrum of Bank Group's activities; (iii) increase the effectiveness of the
Bank's assistance through more consultation and participation of stakeholders; (iv) pay more attention to
implementation capacity in the country; (v) be flexible in adjusting to changing country circumstances:
and (vi) strengthen capacity of local training and research institutes. Clients view interactions with Bank
Group Staff as important and very useful and stressed the need for Bank Staff to increase their outreach
and interactions with clients and civil society.

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy

Client "Pul" and Selectivity

65. 

Underiying botn the seiection of The Bank Groups strategic priorities and their implementation is
the principle of "strong client pull" for reform and selectivity. Part of the strategic objective behind the
"demand pull"' approach is to aim for capacity building through lending and non-lending support and to
learn together with the client. There is a need to focus, not just on what is important, but also on areas
with strong client commitment to carry out the necessary reforms. Bank Group financial support is
useful only among these. For example, the Bank's assistance strategy has already been reoriented to
focus first on those provinces-Sindh and NWFP-which have embarked on a comprehensive fiscal and
economic reform program and have sought Bank's assistance. Subsequently the Bank's dialogue will
also focus on those newly established district level governments which would be committed to reform.
IFC's investments and support will also depend on progress in establishing a competitive market
framework. For example, the extent of IFC's involvement in the gas sector depends on government's
action on regulatory and price reforms and privatization.

66. 
Using this principle, the Bank Group's strategic priorities will be subdivided into three
categories: (i) Deep engagement; (ii) Low engagement; and (iii) Monitoring (see graph below).

67. 
Business Areas for Deep Engagement. The Bank Group will engage fully with its full set of
services in areas where the government has shown the strongest conmitment to reform and has
demonstrated such comnmitment through measurable actions already taken. While cooperatng with other
donnrq the Bank (G'roou will take the lead on support tn en.nnnmic management and financial grnance,

Business Areas With No-Lending Services. These are areas where the Bank would monitor
developments such as on areas where the IMF has comparative advantage (macroeconomic stabilization),
areas where the reforms are on-going (sometimes with other donors sunport) or need only IFC or

the need for a programmatic approach for the Bank Group's assistance strategy. The system wide
reforms being envisaged for example for the tax administration (CBR), Tne institutions in charge of
financial management (the Comptroller General of Accounts, the Auditor General's Office), the civil
service, also require a progranmmatic approach.

71. 
Programmatic Instruments. Tne instruments used under this GAS follow directly from the
strategy. The Bank will use (i) policy based fast disbursing lending to pursue the governance and
sectoral reform agenda (finance, power); (ii) programmatic sector and investment lending to support the
implementation of the reforms to improve the economic (TA to the Central Bank, CBR, CGA, and AG)
and social infrastructure and delivery systems for education and health, and community infrastructure
services (including water management) at all levels of governments; and (iii) analytical work and other
non-lending services to monitor developments in the areas of low engagement and encourage reforms.
The Bank Group will use its non-lending services (AAA, TA, and advisory services) to build a coherent
strategy. for capacity building, fill the knowledge gaps in key areas of reforms to help the government
articulate its reform strategies and strengthen its implementation strategy (see Table 7).

72. 
The core program of fiscal and governance reforms at both the provincial and district levels is an
area for which the Bank's programming approach is best suited; reforms take several years to yield
results. and sutport needs to be flexible and consistent to withstand the uncertainties inherent in such an
endeavor. Moving forward with reforms will also require assurance of a reasonable degree of financial
sunnort over the medium-tern. The Bank's nlanned use of a series of one tranche adiustment credits to
the federal and provincial governments will provide a predictable and performance-based support to

enahle hnth the refhrmincr nrnvince tore t.nre their filnrcinl en,lniiiihrilim while ,rndeirtnring the diffirult

and politically controversial reforms. The approach will also help the Bank manage risks by pacing its

Government-funded PHRD grant technical assistance will continue to be a very useful instrument in
building local govermnent capacity to implemelnt refuiris.

Partnership-s and Outreach

74. 
Tne Bank has been instrumental-as it pursued tne Comprehensive Development Framework
approach-in pulling along donors to build stronger partnerships in support of the govermient's reform
program and its I-PKSP. The Bank supported the government from its first days drawing on its expertise
to help it formulate its comprehensive reform program. The Bank Group will continue under this CAS to
base its financial assistance on a sector-wide programtmatic approach. 
In this context, and using the
selectivity principle, the Bank Group will seek better donor coordination in the areas of Blank Group's
deep engagement. The Bank is leading the effort to mobilize technical expertise and financial assistance
to modernize the Central Board of Revenue; leveraging the support of the IMF and DFII) in the process.
In the financial sector area, the Bank will continue to support the banling sector governance reforms (and
privatization with IFC's support) while AsDB is focusing on supporting capital market development, the
restructuring of the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), micro-credit, ane SMEs
development. IFC will complement the Bank's work on baikin8 sector reforms and AsDB's on SMEs.
In education, the Bank will lead the effort to support the sector-wide reforms (through the Education
Sector Reform) and suDport pilot initiatives such as the nlanned LTT 
to the Natinnal Fihuation
Assessment System (NEAS). AsDB and USAID will support basic education and health thkrough project

lending. Tn healtlh, the Bank wil1 cnntiniue tn crnnernt-.P with the relevant TJN agncGies, inliuding aWH,

Partnerships are also central to IFC's work, since it is always a minority investor. 

IFC will

continue to work closely with domestic and international investors in Key industries such as gas and the

financial sector to facilitate new investment. 
EFC will also work closely with domestic financial
institutions to help mobilize long-term domestic financing, e.g. through partial guarantees of bank loans
or bonds. IFC and MIGA's activities will aim to crowd in private investment. The approach is through
investing in, and guaranteeing investments in, projects which have a strong catalytic impact in mobilizing
additional private investment, or which are pioneering new opportunities for private investment, or which
support new mechanisms for raising finance.

76. 
Outreach. An irnportant complement to partnership is the Bank Group's overall outreach.
Accordingly, the Bank has increased its interactions with the different levels of governments, the
Pakistan media, civil society, and business community to establish partnerships based on a shared vision
for Pakistan's development. 
In this regard, the Bank Group's intensified its efforts to build the local
media's capacity to better understand and accurately report on important socio-econornic issues and
govemance. The Bank routinely conducts training programs for business and economic renorters usually
through the WBI and in collaboration with local universities. In keeping with the Bank's goal of sharing

knowledge, increasingy transparencv- and enhancing accoiLntabilitv_ the Bank GfrOni 

has launchrned a web

site dealing specifically with its operations in Palistan but providing worldwide best practices and links

ine Bank Groups outreach will expand Luruier once Farakstn develops its

Distance Learning Center (DLC) as part of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), a global
network of interactive classrooms with full muitimedia connectivity to other centers of inowledge
around the world. Joining the GDLN will greatly increase the Bank Group's outreach in Pakistan by
bringing WBkl learning and capacity building activities to larger numbers of government officiais, private
sector representatives, members of civil society, and other stakeholders. In addition, and in response to
the feedback received during the CAS consultations (see Annex 1), a special effort will be made to extend
the Bank Group's outreach through more periodic dialogue with stakeholders. This will be done through
wider dissemination of the Bank Group's reports and disclosure of project documents (especially in local
languages), greater engagement with civil society organizations and opinion makers. The Bank will
continue also its highly effective consultative process in the preparation of specific projects.

D. 

Program Priorities

77. 
The Bank Group's program priorities will be focused on the reforms to (i) strengthen
macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (ii) improve the business environment for
growth; and (iii) improve equity through support for pro-poor and pro-gender equity policies.

Strengthening the Basis for Macroeconomic Stability and Government Effectiveness

78. 
Macroeconomic Stability. The Bank will support in partnership with the IMF the macro-
economic stabilization program agenda to restore fiscal sustainability, reduce internal and external debt,
and improve the competitiveness of the economy through supportive trade, monetary, and exchange rate
nolicies. The Bank Groun's key contributions will be in inmroving public exnenditure management and
supporting reforms of tax administration, safe and sound banlking, efficient public utilities, and structural

fiscal and governanGe refhrme. Tn particular, the Bank wvill Gnntinue to carrv out the anniul revi-ws of

also support institutional capacity building for oversight and monitoring through training in the areas of
public expenditure and financiai accountabiiity, media development, and the interaction between
parliament and the Auditor General, including support to strengthening legislative oversight once
parliament is reinstated.

81. 
Devolution. 
Initially, the Bank will continue to use analytical work, technical assistance, and
policy dialogue as more appropriate instruments to support the implementation of the devolution strategy,
particularly the strengthening of district level capacity to manage public service delivery. Since a
number of Pakistan's development partners are supporting also the implementation of the government's
devolution program, the Bank will focus on areas where it has a comparative advantage, in financial
management, planning and budgeting, and social service delivery. Specifically, the Bank will focus on
the implementation of the recommendations of the part I of the CFAA. The latter reviewed provincial
financial accountability issues, including the Local Government financial accountabilitv framework.
This was possible because the fundamental financial rules goveming federal and provincial governments
described in the Constitution are similar. and nrovinces mostly follow the federal government budgetarv
rules, since financial accountability institutions are centralized. The federal government's Controller

Grenera of Account'q office 

attaGhed to the Federal Miniftry of Finance, is respc sible for th.e

preparation of the Civil Appropriation Accounts of all Governments, from the federal to the district level.

The Pakistan Auditor General's office is responsible for all audits except for those of the smallest tiers of
local Governments, which are audited by the Local Fund Board. The Bank has already made a start in
sunnorting the devolution aLgenda in the area of financial management through its dialogue on provincial
reforms. The support to Sindh's fiscal and structural reform program includes (i) improving public

the Bank, in FY02, and an SME policy note describing the key features of SMEs and their constraints
1), wne nanik Group plans to carry out a signincant
program of analytical work over the next two years to underpin its advisory services in this area. These
include: (i) A Development Policy Review (completed in r F u) which provides the Bank's assessment
of the adequacy of the current development policy agenda to achieve rapid growth and poverty reduction;
and (ii) an Investment Climate and Economic Performance Study (to be completed in FY03). The latter
aims to relate key aspects of the investment climate (basic economic infrastructure, and regulatory and
governance frameworks) with the performance and productivity of private manufacturing firms, small
and large. To build domestic capacity for this analytical and monitoring work in the future, the study is
being carried out jointly with SMEDA-the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency. An
analysis of the trade regime will also be undertaken in FY04.

83. 
The Bank will also continue to encourage the federal and provincial governments to pursue the
trade liberalization and modernization of industrial, business and labor regulations that are already under
way. 
In addition, the Bank Group has advocated the strengthening of the anti-trust authority. At the
federal level, the Bank will support the newly established deregulation committee. The latter will help
with the implementation of the deregulation agenda with soecial focus on SMEs. At the provincial level,
the Bank's dialogue and proposed assistance to Sindh and NWFP will also focus on reforms which fall
within the provinces' purview (such as labor and industrial regulations) to improve the investment
climate. On SMEs development, given the selectivity principle, the Bank's contribution will be on
knowledge, dissemination- and possible technical assistnnce given that the AsDB is taking the lead w:ith
the preparation of a SME project. This project will support the first generation of reforms already

identified in the Bank's ar.al,tical work on the SMws. WC wil cor.tinie to play a lead.ng, role i

frameworks and development of institutional capacity to iaciliiate and promote environmentaly and
socially responsible private sector mining development both for coal and for non-fuel minerals.

86. 
The Bank Group will continue its deep engagement in the power sector reforms. The power
sector reforms wiil continue to be supported through policy dialogue and adjustment lending which, by
strengthening macroeconomic stability and reducing exposure risk, is expected to improve the investment
climate for private investment. 
In addition, the Bank Group will support through programmatic
investment lending the privatization of the distribution companies. 
In particular, IFC will aim to
mobilize private investment for the power sector, particularly for the privatized distribution companies.
IFC will also continue to act as adviser to the government on the privatization of Faisalabad Electric
Supply Company (FESCO).

87. 
In line with the selectivity principle, the Bank Group support for transport, over the CAS, will be
limited to analytical and advisory services, given the lack of strong pull from the government, the
importance of private sector participation in the sector, and the extent of involvement of other donors in
the road sector. Accordingly, project lending will be limited to supporting the National Highway
Authority's (NHA) 
reforms, especially 
financial management,

89. 
The Bank Group will continue its support to financial sector development, another major
component of the on-going CAS. In particular, over the CAS period, Bank Group support will continue
to focus on deepening banking sector governance reforms, support to bank privatization and to
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory capacity of the State Bank of Pakistan. This last outcome is
supported through a Technical Assistance for the Banling Sector (TABS) Project. The proposed TABS
is a follow-on to the ongoing Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation Project (FSDIP). It will
support (i) the completion of the State Bank of Pakistan's restructuring program aimed at modernizing
the central bank and strengthening its capacity to regulate and supervise the banking sector; (ii) staff
development to re-align personnel management policies with international best practices; (iii) the
strengthening of the country's payment systems and credit information services for better disclosure
standards to all stakeholders; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of regulators and enforcers to control
money laundering and financial fraud.

Creating the Conditions for Accelerated, Sustainable Rural Growth. Agricultural trade and
pricing regimes have been substantially liberalized to the point that few distortions remain at the
macroeconomic level. However, a significant agenda of second generation reforms remain to address the
unequal opportunity and capacity to access assets and markets-land, water, financial intermediation,
technology and output markets. The Bank will therefore focus its assistance over the next three years on:
(i) monitoring developments on agricultural policies to improve further the investment climate in
agriculture; (ii) filling the knowledge gap on the policies and institutional and regulatory frameworks
governing the functioning of rural markets as well as o.portunities for off-farm employment; (iii) seeking
opportunities 
to improve access to financial services with IFC's support; and (iii) supporting

Promoting Education and Health for All. The Bank Group will support the I-PRSP's core
objective to empower people by creating greater opportunities for increasing real incomes by improving
access to education and health services, especially for girls, and to safety nets programs. The Bank's
support to these three areas-promoting education and health, supporting pro-poor rural development
and community infrastructure, as well as supporting targeted poverty alleviation programs (PPAF, CIP),
reflect their importance as well as the Bank's comparative advantage.

Education Reforms. The World Bank Group's assistance strategy will be driven by support to
the implementation of the Education Sector Reform (ESR) Strategy. The Bank support will focus on

of the rural asset base through rural community-based infrastructure projects (particularly for water
supply and sanitation services) and tie spread of micro-credit nave been part of 
the Bank Group's
strategy to reduce and mitigate risks for Pakistan's poor. The Bank's efforts to support key investments
in rural infrastructure and support services are designed not only to promote more rapid and sustained
rural growth but also to directly attack rural poverty and support social protection. Since the 1998 CAS
progress report, the Bank has integrated social protection in its operational work through its support to
improving the delivery of basic infrastructure and access to micro-credit through conmmunity-driven
projects such as the NWFP Community Infrastructure and Services Project (CIP) and the Pakistan
Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF). The NGO-implemented infrastructure and micro-credit schemes
under the PPAF is a very successful scheme which will be scaled up during the coming CAS. The on-
going PPAF has already provided loans to over 60,000 borrowers, over two thirds of which are women.
Building on the experience of these community-based approaches, the Bank is currently preparing a
Commnunity Infrastructure and Services Project (CIP). The Bank will continue, under this CAS, to pilot
new approaches, and also help scale up those which have proven effective such as the CIP and the PPAF.
A programmatic approach is key. This enables the government and the Bank to tailor projects to the
particular circumstances and needs of individual provinces and districts, leaming and adjusting as they

gon and scaling up as successes are identified. A sncial risk assessment is also planned for PY3O whi-ch

will also help underpin the Bank Group's integration of social protection in the Bank's future operations.

system, food for school, and other targeted subsidies-to increase gieis enrollment. Sindh has already
moved in this direction with its successful food program (providing edible oil for girls who attend
schools) which has increased giris enrollment. Women's empowerment is a prominent component of the
Bank-supported education, health, CIP and PPAF.

97. 
A significant program of analytical work is also planned over the CAS period to show the
opportunities that gender-responsive policies create for enhanced growth and poverty reduction. The
Bank, the govenment, and the other donors, including UNDP and DFID, have been working together to
strengthen the government's analytic capacity on gender sensitive policies. The Banl: has a poverty
assessment underway, with a survey geared to capturing gender issues with a view of informing public
policy regarding the formulation of a gender strategy. A country gender assessment is planned for FY04,
which would provide the knowledge base for future Bank's policy dialogue and operational
interventions.

an aggressive portfolio improvement strategy. The traditional project-based approach was supplemented
by a more systemic vision of portfolio management based on outcomes, ownership, and good
governance. Quarterly portfolio reviews with the Federal Finance Minister and periodic- provincial
portfolio reviews are now the norm. Building on this portfolio strategy, two Portfolio improvement Plans
were developed in FY99 and FY00. The number of projects in the Pakistan portfolio declined from 41 in
FY98 to 16 as of May 3, 2002, with outstanding commitments of US$1.5 billion (net of cancellation).
The decline in the number of projects was the result of two actions: (i) a 'no-extension' policy outside of
"force majeure"; leading to closure of 32 projects; (ii) few new entrants to the portfolio in FY00 and
FYOI, relative to closings, as a result of enhanced selectivity and "quality at entry" criteria. This trend
has already been reversed starting from FY01 due to this government's strong track record in reform
implementation.

101. 
The Bank is now engaged with the clients on key thematic 
issues affecting portfolio
performance. 
In this regard, the Bank has initiated thematic portfolio reviews-on impactloutcome
indicators and on social and environmental risk management-with senior policy makers as part of a
strategy to mainstream these development challenges within the Government's own monitoring and
evaluation framework. A workshop was held in March 2002 with key government staff to disseminate
best practice on "outcomes" measurement. Portfolio performance has been turned around to some extent
also with the heln of field-based sunervision teams working closely with the government and reducing
response time. Projects are now managed with increased participation of communities and beneficiaries.

103. 
Using the lessons learnt from project implementation and taking into account the emerging client
needs led to the restructuring in FY01 of two major high risk projects, namely the Second Social Action
Program (SAPP2) and the National Drainage Program (NDP). The scope of the SAP was substantially
narrowed in light of government's changed human development strategy under the new devolution

system. The Rank has recnmmendned diwnsi7ina the NDP tn alion it hetter with the newjv Federal andi

remaining two (NDP, GBHP) have been downgraded to unsatisfactory performance in the last few
montns. As a result, "commitments at risk!' have increased again from 20 percent in F1'uii to 60 percent
at end-December 2001. The specific factors behind the unsatisfactory ratings for these three projects and
actions taken to address them are:

* The restructured SAPP2 is now being implemented satisfactorily but will be closed early in June
2002 with a U rating. The U rating for DO will not be removed because the time span since
restructuring is too short. The SAP2's restructured component accounts for about 15 percent of
total credit, the remaining balance has been fully disbursed. Efforts over the next few months
will be directed at ensuring satisfactory implementation of the restructured component.

* Regarding NDP, the restructuring recommended by the FYO mid-term review--reducing the
implementation to only one canal command in each province-has not yet been implemented.
Sindh has accepted the recommendation to focus on one canal command which has led to
improvement in the implementation of the project in that province. But since the institutional
reforms underpinning the project are not widely shared by all government departments, and

just completed its work but it will take time for the main stakeholders to reach consensus.

* Regarding the GBHP, major disputes on claims emerged during FY01 between WAPDA and the

dispute nas since Deen resolved. As soon as tne agreed upon financiai settlement is honored and

the contractor resumes work, implementation progress is likely to pick up and ratings are
expected to De upgraded.

* By early FY03, with the closure of SAPP2 and resolution of issues related to the other two large
projects (NDP, GBHP), the "commitments at risk" are expected to fall to a single digit.

105. Outcomesfrom the last CAS. The last CAS was discussed by the Board in December 1995 and
the CAS Progress Report was reviewed in June 12, 2001. The volume of IBRD and IDA commitments
was linked to the strength of Pakistan's reform program, maintenance of macroeconomic stability, and to
progress in social sectors. In addition the level of IBRD's commitments was linked to irnprovements in
the country's creditworthiness. In early 1997, policy reforns had been slowed and Pakistan was in the
low base case. In fact, after lending US$420 million from DBRD in FY96; there was no EBRD lending in

FYV7. Lending from IDA also fell dtring those vears- averaging only US$80 mnillion ner year. With the
implementation of a comprehensive package of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms, in

provided US$90 million for a Poverty Alleviation Fund. Sustained implementation of the comprehensive
reform program as envisaged in the 1999 CAS Progress Report was expected to lay the basis for lenlding
at High Case levels during FY00. That never happened. Reform implementation slowed down over
FYOO, with a worsening of the investment climate as the Nawaz Sharif govemment engaged in a very
damaging dispute with Independent Power Producers, NGOs, and corruption became rampant. As a
result, the Bank stopped lending over FY00 and focused on non-lending services.

107. 
The positive developments in Pakistan in FY01 provided the basis tor a stronger operational
engagement by the Bank Group in FY01. Accordingly over FY01, the program of assistance included a
Structural Adjustment Credit for US$350 million and investment credits focused on supporting reforms
to improve the investment climate and the delivery of basic services. These included a Trade and
Transport Facilitation Project for US$3 million, a US$21.35 million project to support water resource
management in North West Frontier province, and a GEF. A Banking Sector Restructuring and
Privatization Project (US$300 million) was approved in October 2001. The assistance over FY01 and
the first half of FY02 was supported by IDA as outlined in the CAS Progress Report discussed by the
Board on June 12, 2001.

B. 

Donor Coordination

108. 
The Bank Group will continue to play its role of bridging partnerships between the Government
of Pakistan and the donor community. Over the past two years, the Bank Group has increased its focus
on donor coordination and continued to play an important role in intermediating information on the

aovernment's reform program and implementation record to donors. 

It has also encouraged the

govermment to communicate with its domestic public opinion makers, and other major stakeholders about

109. 

The government is therefore taking the lead on donor coordination. A donors meeting was held

Revival Program, in the local grass-roots context and see for themselves that the government is truly in
the "driver's seat" and that its program represents a "real break" from the past.

110. 
Learning from this positive experience, 
the government invited its partners to a Human
Development Forum which was held in Islamabad in January 2002 to elicit donors feedback on the
government's human development strategy and seek donors support and stronger engagement in the
implementation of the strategy. Building upon these positive experiences, the provincial governments of

provincial reform programs and poverty reduction strategies. A Sindh Development Forum was held in
February, 2002; another one is being planned for NwrP. Tne second Pacistan De-velopment Forum
(PDF) was held in Paris on April 29-30, 2002. High level representation from 14 bilateral donors and 18
international agencies attended the Forum. 
For the first time NGOs (inciuding 'Transparency
International) were also invited to attend the forum which was also open to the press both in Paris and
Paiistan. This was followed on May 2, 2002 by a Private Sector hnvestors' Forum and a discussion on
the Government's I-PRSP. Both events were attended by a large number of CEOs representing
international and Pakistani businesses, academics and members of influential think tanks.

111. 
Facilitating partnerships and donor coordination will assume an even greater role over the CAS
period now that sanctions have been lifted and many bilateral donors are reviewing their assistance
strategy to Pakistan with a view of scaling it up. The Bank will continue to facilitate the annual donors
meetings as well as provincial and special topic forums on Pakistan's development. The Bank will also
continue to support other donors initiatives to organize thematic donors meeting.

C. 

FY03-05 Lending Program and Implementation Chalenges

112. 
Despite the implementation of very tight macroeconomic policies, that have already led to
compression of imports and falling current account deficits, Pakistan's external capital requirements
remain large. Current balance of payments projections indicate that through 2003/05 Pakistan will need
over US$5.7 billion (US$1 billion for 2001/02 alone) to finance the reforms under the I-PRSP.

113. 
Creditworthiness. Pakistan remains a heavily indebted country despite the recent Paris Club
rescheduling. Pakistan's total external public and publicly guaranteed debt stood at US$31.4 billion, or

53 percent of GDP at the end of June 2001, and is exnected to rise to UTS$317 hillinn (45-8 percent of

GDP) by June 2005. Debt service as a share of foreign earnings is estimated to fall as a result of the debt

above that recommended by IBRD exposure guidelines (see Table 4). This is the result of recent
bilaterai debt reductions and past initiai non-multilaterai iending to Paiastan. At this level, Pakistan is
only marginally creditworthy for IBRD and the government has refrained from borrowing on IBRD terms
for FYOO-01 and is not expected to borrow at those terms in FY03.

114. 
Given the strength of the Government's I-PRSP, its implementation record ito date, poor
prospects for higher private capital flows particularly given the current regional tensions, the large
financing requirements, and high indebtedness and poverty incidence, the Government oi Palcistan has
requested an increased access to 1DA13 allocation to finance the comprehensive federal amd provincial
reform program. The Bank's level of financial assistance over the next three years is a key element of
this CAS.

IDA AUlocaton. Given these considerations, and the likelihood of an increase in demand for
Bank's assistance from the provinces, an SDR 1.0 billion (equivalent to US$400 million per year) IDA

allocation has been set for the base case and SDR 1.4 billion (eauivalent to US$600 million a vear) for

the high case over FY03-05. The Bank will resume IBRD lending only under the high case and starting

from FY04.

i i7. Lending Triggers for Bank Assistance. 
hne lending scenarios will be guided by two sets of
triggers; (i) entry and exit triggers linked to provincial reforms; and (ii) global triggers linked to each of
the 
three pillars of the assistance strategy, macroeconomic stability and governance, enabling
environment for private investment, and human development (see Table 6). In addition, the SACH and
following adjustment operations, include detailed short-and-medium-term triggers for each of the three
pillars of the assistance strategy, macroeconomic stability and governance, enabling environment for
private investment, and human development.

These tg;cero oh.ould be inter-preted as indiatin,g the key areas of depn reforms: (i) macrn

119. Entry and Exit Triggers for Bank Assistance to Provinces. Pakistan's provinces face a fiscal
crisis-itself the resuit of poor governance and economic management-which has crippled their ability
to deliver on their mandate. Since a significant volume of the Bank's lending program is linked to
structural reforms to improve the provinces' fiscal performance and strengthen their capacity to deliver
basic services, the Bank's lending program will take place only under the high case scenario and will be
regulated by the following entry criteria.

* There is a reforming government at the provincial level with committed "reform champions" at
the top and capable reform leaders within the administration.

* The provinces would have already initiated a number of reforms to restore good governance and
improve their public finances and public service delivery. This includes:

O Fiscal discipline translated into reduced short-term borrowing for deficit financing

O Improved Performance of Financial Management Commlittees and PACs.

O Initiation of civil service reform including pay & pensions adjustment, rightsizing by
eliminating positions as per skills requirements at the pDrovincial and in autonomous and
semi-autonomous bodies.

E. 

Monitoring and Evaluation

122. 
For the programmatic approach to succeed, the Bank needs to significantly enhance its capacity
to monitor intermediate targets and final outcomes-be they policy reforms ai the national, provincial,
district level, or of individual projects-and to incorporate the lessons learnt in future work. The Bank is
also working with the government on developing poverty and social monitoring systems to track changes
in key intermediate and outcome indicators, including access to public services as well as income and
non-income dimensions of poverty. This includes: (i) monitoring spending (disaggregated by economic
classification such as salary vs. non-salary) in important sub-sectors such as primary education, health
and safety net programs; (ii) adopting a national poverty line and updating it; (iii) selecting priority
indicators for monitoring poverty outcomes and related intermediate targets, incorporating gender
concerns; and (iv) building technical capacity, particularly in the provinces and districts, for effective

monitoring.

123. 
The success of the Government's poverty reduction strategy as well as the effectiveness of Bank
Group support for that strategy can be judged ultimately by Pakistan's progress towards achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Bank plans to suDport the Federal government to better
monitor these and related key development outcomes (see Annex IV).

V. IFC PORTFOLIO AND PROGRAM

124. Over the past three years IFC has focused on restructuring its existing portfolio, while helping
clients to restructure and strennthen their comnanies. It is nearin8 conmnletion of the reqtructuhrin of
investments in three cement and two textile companies. As a result, Pakistan now ranks as IFC's 9h

to invest in financial services, manufacturing (especially garments and textiles), telecoms, health and
education, ri and SMEs through partial guarantees. New investment is expected to be in the range of
US$150-250 million over the next three years which will keep IFC's exposure near existing levels.

VI. MIGA PORTFOLIO AND PROGRAM

127. As of March 31, 2002, MIGA has a gross exposure of US$92.3 million in Pakistan representing
1.9 percent of the Agency's portfolio. The portfolio is diverse, covering 7 investments in the financial,
infrastrucwre, and manufacturing sectors.

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy

ViH. IOPERATIONAL DECENT (ALIZATION

128. 
Tne South Asia Region initiated a umndamenial shift in organization, culture and work processes
in July 1997 with the single objective of strengthening client effectiveness. The unique character of the
nations of South Asia created the opportunity for more strategic choices in where work was conducted:
in the country itself, in Washington, or in another location in the region. To that end, the Bank's South
Asia operations have been significantly decentralized to the field already. A powerful global team was
formed, co-located between Washington and the field, teaming global knowledge in Washington, and
proximity to the social, cultural, and political business context of development work in the field.

129. 
The management support structure in South Asia, including for Palistan, consists of Country
Directors (CD) in country offices and Sector Directors (SDs) in Washington, working as ai global team.
SDs remain in Washington to work closely with network families and sector boards. For Pakistan,
experience has shown that having the Country Director (CD) in the Islamabad Office has huge benefits.
Some of the Sector Managers who complement the managerial role of Sector Directors will also be
located in country offices further strengthening technical capacity in these offices. Task leadership is
based on competencies, business needs and skills (not location). There has been a large increase in field-
based leadership, for AAA as well as lending tasks including supervision. Recruitment strategv for
sector staff located in Country Offices, within the context of sector strategies, is to hire the best and
brightest South Asians (some 
living abroad and willing to return home) 
For Pakistan, the
implementation of the shift to province and district-based CAS over the forthcoming three years will

Feedback from governments is positive, the Bank Group is better understood, and responsiveness
and product cycle-time have improved. Quantifiable improvements are being seen in the quality of
portfolio, economic and sector work, and supervision.

VIII. RISK MANAGEMENT

132. 
Palistan's economy faces serious challenges and major risks emanating from a variety of internal
and external sources. The main risks associated with this CAS are highlighted below.

133. With national elections scheduled to take place by October 2002 (as mandated by Palistan's
Supreme Court), there is unavoidable uncertainty about the sustained implementaton of the reform
agenda outlined in the I-PRSP post October 2002. Lack of continuity would threaten many of the
benefits expected from the program.

Pakistan Country Assistance Strateev 

37

134. 
The government has rightly decided not to complete the full PRSP until after the new
government is in office to ensure that it endorses it. While it is expected that the new govermnent would
endorse the strategy to reduce poverty in Pakistan as outlined in the I-PRSP, there is inevitably some
uncertainty regarding what economic policies the new government would focus on and what their impact
on private investment will be. The best risk mitigation against reversal is the benefits the Dost 1999
reforms have on the people of Pakistan. The reforms to increase transparency and accountability within
the government the Central Board of Revenue reformsr 
the human develonment strateov, the devolutinon
with elected officials now taking charge of public service delivery and accountable to the voters, are

(see table 6) to help the Bank Group manage this political uncertainty.

135. Another political risk is the opposition 
to the modernizing policies introduced by this
guvwiiu-..e.t; 
in particul'ar, the r-eform. of th.e elementary ed-ucation systeml, 
incl-udinlg thle atemlpt to
regulate the Madaris (religious schools), and the pro-gender equity policies. Following the September 11

e-vents, tuhe government has Ueen more aggressi-ve in its communications surategy, stressing the need to

develop Pakistan into a modern Islamic state and stressing the important benefits Palistan stands to gain
from integrating into the worid economy. 'Wnile the govemment is trying to manage this risk and there is
strong support for the President's stand against intolerance, the risks posed by these militant groups
cannot be underestimated.

136. 
A risk of complacency may lessen the compulsion to improve the investment climate now that
international reserves are rising and seem likely to continue to rise due to the increasing capture of
workers' remittances by the banking system. The Paris Club debt restructuring and exceptional financing
by IDA and other donors may add to the complacency. This risk is mitigated by the sound debt reduction
strategy which has been under implementation for the past three years to rapidly restore creditworthiness
and reduce over-reliance on International Financial Institutions' financing.

137. 
There are also.implementation risks stemming from the technical and institutional capacity
constraints especially for the reforms that involve governments at the provincial and district levels. To
manage this risk, the Bank and other donors are working together with the government to build capacity.

138. 
Domestic public finance risk to poverty reduction outcomes. The low tax/GDP ratio may
prove difficult to raise significantly in the next three years. All levels of government are under-funded
for their basic assignments, with the lower tier the most under-funded when accounting for its
responsibilities for basic service delivery.

139. 
A foreign concessional risk to poverty reduction outcomes. The September 11 shock has
increased the risks to the balance of navment position by maiking more lnertin an early resuimpntion of
long-term private capital inflows as well as access to intemational capital markets. Inadequate extemal

Finally, ogenos shocks may require ad-ustm--e.nt in fiscal an.d exter..-al policies beyond ,what is

if concurreni with excessively timid debt reiief,

141. 
The Bank Group support program is self-adjusting to mitigate the risk of reform derailment.
Substantial lending will raOntinule only as long as Pakistan continiues its imT plemtation per.fo.rmn n-ce of
the past two years.

Consulting the People of Pakistan

2. 
No vibrant society speaks with a single voice, and Pakistan-among other things-is a vibrant
society. Dunrng extensive consultations that the Bank conducted in 0LUU and 200 i in preparation for the
CAS, Pakistanis at all levels predictably spoke with feeling about a wide range of concerns, hopes and
fears. Extensive though the Bank's consultations were in time and area covered, they do not constitute a
scientific survey of public opinion in Pakistan. Their intent, instead, was to enable Bank Group staff to
hear directly from people, particuiarly those the Bank Giroup staff do not frequently meet in the ordinary
course of business-judges and police, students, joumalists, tribal leaders, religious scholars, and women
and men locked up in jails. Nevertheless, in the hundreds of discussions that Bank Group staff held in
impoverished villages and bustling cities, four themes clearly dominated. They were:

* A hunger for education, especially basic education for girls;
* A thirst for water, particularly for clean, accessible drinking water;
* A yeaming for justice, for the maintenance of law and order to curb violence, corruption and
abuse of political influence; and
* A criticism of the World Bank's and IMF's pDolicies and Dractices. particularlv for their Derceived
collaboration with corrupt, anti-poor governments.

3. 

Not every group raised all these points. Many rural Palistanis also highlighted the importance of

access to oualitv healthcare and the infrastructural deficiencies in roads and puhlic transpnrt as well as

power and water supply. Some small town entrepreneurs stressed the importance of access to credit along
with transparency in tAxation and regulation. Notahly, however, wliile some ordiznary citize.ns could not

veterin,ary services, unreliable public transport, backlogged conurtrooms, hbrie-tahing tax and utility

inspectors, extortionist highway police and civil servants indifferent to all but political cronyism. The
Pakistanis who aired their grievances to Bank representatiVes were most articulate about situations they
knew first-hand. Collectively, though, they painted a portrait of a non-functioning system that impedes

8. 
in the workshops in tne provincial capitais-'Lahore, Karacni, Pesnawar, and Quetta-many of
the urban elite and representatives of the middle class blamed the Bank and IMF policies for "hurting
Pakistan and creating poverty." Tne Bank, urged one speaker, shouid "write off Pakistan's debt and
withdraw." "Facilitate but do not promote a western dominated policy agenda in the country ",
recommended another participant in Peshawar. Bank policies shiould change, said another, -from
dictatorial to friendly." Echoing an appeal to "please leave us alone," a third claimed to speak for
Pakistan's citizens when he said "This nation is fed up with the IMF and world bank agenda". Some
thought 80 percent of Bank loans are in technical assistance payments to foreign firms and consultants.
Very few understood that Paiistan was a blend country eligible for both 1BKD and IDA terms, most
quoted interest rates they thought the Bank charged that were far in excess of those actually charged and
almost none knew the IDA terms. Such criticism came in large measure from educated, articulate, urban
professionals. The perception among urban elites of the Bank as an accomplice in official sins of
omission and commission adds another challenge to the Bank's work in Pakistan. Surprisingly these
criticisms and anger were not echoed in the federal capital, Islamabad where the Bank office is situated.

9. 
Other participants from this same gathering of urban professionals, instead praised the Bank's
assistance strategy to Pakistan and argued for increased assistance on concessional terms. Some said the
Bank should "give priority to education for women, technical education andfamily planning and health."
Repeatedly, the participants in the district-level consultations urged the Bank to connect more closely to
community-based and non-governmental organizations. A Peshawar participant, for instance, counseled
the Bank to work with "formally organized" groups of the poor who "can best identify wlat will take
them out of poverty." In Peshawar, Karachi, and D.G Khan district, some speakers citod "religious
groups" as deserving "direct" Bank support and encouragement. "The best building in any village and the
cleanest," asserted a participant, "is the mosque, because the community manages it." Others in Kohat
(NWFP) praised the Bank's support using as example the Community Infrastructure and Services Project
(CTh-being imnlemented in some villages there with community participation-where there was visible
impact of Bank's support in improved rural roads and rural water supply and sanitation schemes.

10. 
A number of those consulted pressed the case for more attention to women's groups at all social
levels both as soLirces of advice and as "delivery mechanisms" for Ba nk-supported progrms. The failure

to "recognize women as partners in development in Pakistan," in the view of a Karachi participant, "is a

major source of siow development." Recommended solutions:

percent of all teachers in some 200 villages are female-and make a special push to bring "literacy
programs to adolescent girls, the primary group affected by maternai mortality." A parallel concern that
some political activists (but few others) raised was continued population growth in Pakistan. An

"illiterate population," said a discussant in Lahore, "does not practice tamily planning because large

families provide them with safety." Female illiteracy, she added, "is the most important reason for low
levels of contraceptive use, poor family health status, and empowerment.

11. 
The consultations with politicians representing the major parties in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore,
Peshawar, and Quetta, uniformly featured criticism of the Bank,, some mild, some harsh. Somewhat more

charitably, many of the political 
representatives of the major parties, 
tended 
to acknowledge Palistan's 
shortcomings

Hungering for Education

Annex I
Page 4 of 13

13. 
Mehrab Khan is an extraordinary 19-year-old from an ordinary Sindh village-Nim Sharif about
two hours outside Shikarpur. What makes him extraordinary is his determination to get a college degree,
a goal that involves commuting by bus three hours a day to a college in Rotadero and that requires his
father to devote half of the household's meager income (Rs. 30 a day) to Mehrab's expenses.

14. 
Sixteen-year-old Rubina Khoso 
is even 1 X 
more extraordinary. Where Mehrab is one of 8-10 
boys from Nim Sharif seeking a B.Sc. degree,
Rubina and her sister, Amina, are the only two girls 
from their Shikarpur village, Qadir Bux Khosa, ever 

| 

to go to college. Her family's income is some three 

.

times that of Mehrab's, and her bus commute is only 
| =
half as long, but as a woman she fears to make it I
alone. As a result, one or two days a week -with
no companion to shield her from harassment-she 
does not make the journey at all.

their daugnters to any other idnd of institution. 
In
their village and others like it, in any case, girls not only have no place for education but little time for it.
Once they are married, usually between the ages of 13 and 15, they are committed to work days-
cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, making dung cakes, collecting firewood, preparing animal fodder and
working either in the fields or at embroidery-that last 14-16 hours. As soon as they are old enough to
attend school, girls follow similar, grueling schedules. 
In some places, families need their school-age
daughters as babysitters for younger children while their mothers walk long distances carrying water for
the household. At least, Nim Sharif villagers have accessible water supplies.

17. 
In the arid stretches of the NFWP, the women of Toolanj Jadeed-a settlement of 500
households-say they spend an average 25 hours a week fetching water from wells a kilometer or more
from the village center. 
In the summer, they must trek to a deeper well three kilometers awav. In the
same season, their neighbors in Dohk Alwara must walk to the Indus River for water, taking ten hours a
week to provide a household necessity.

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy

18. 

Still, even the 70 or so men of the Toolanj Jadeed Community Organization who talked with

Bank visitors in October 2000 recognized the need io educate mneir daugnters. Ine village nas no schoul

for girls, and parents are reluctant to send their daughters to an all-girls school more than two kilometers
away for many of the same reasons tnat keep Rubina Ksnoso irom taking unescorted bus trips. 
anxieties and the need for women's hands in household work also result in girls dropping out of the
village' s five primary schools for boys after the third or fourtn class. -No giris attend tne one secondary
school, and efforts to obtain at least one school just for
girls have tailed. A buildmg for them that was put up 
some ten years ago on shamilati land (donated land) was 
never occupied 
because 
title was not properly 
transferred. Parents, 
however, 
continue 
to 
seek 
educational opportunities for their daughters. They had 
written the provincial education department about the 
village's deprivation. Some had even written to the 
secretary of education. None have received a response.

Another Option - Islamic Education 

19. 
The school in Allah Bux Khoso is one of 120 
public schools open in the Shikarpur district. Ninety- I 
three others are closed because no teachers can be
recruited to work at them. Responding to that shortage 
| 
and to rligou convictions, many families send their
sons to Islamic schools, known as madaris. Pakistan had 
3,000 such schools in 1978. 
It has more than 15,000_
institutions for which the curriculum was designed by a 
Mogul emperor three centuries ago. Their student body I 
is estimated to be close to a million. A number of 
participants 
indicated that lack of access to public 
education and inability to pay for private schooling lead 
parents to send their children to Madaris. Many said that 
while they want their children to know about Islam, they 
did not want them to become Islamic scholars. They
only want them to be educated (see Box 3).

Water - Too Scarce and Too Unhealthy

20. 

Water availability and its quality have a direct bearing on educational and health outcomes,

particularl,y in riural Pakeistn. Watching thte yovnger children while adldit womten fptlh water iS a

common duty that keeps girls, especially, out of school. Water-borne diseases keep school attendance

erratic and is amain contributor to the high infant Iinortahtr rate. Andl at anofthr rpmovep inaidequate

hill torrents would produce a reliable water supply, but the villagers have only their own unskilled labor
to invest in such projects. Children bring their own brackish water in bottles to school since the school
has no running water and no toilets. Of the five diseases that claimed the lives of 30 Roongan children in
2000, three are water-bome: diarrhea, typhoid and cholera.

22. 
Far to the north in the NWFP village of Toolanj Jadeed, water is as high a priority as in Punjab
and Baluchistan, but its provision by the Public Health and Environment Department (PHED) has been
marked by so many false starts that the local inhabitants have lost faith in the government's promises. In
the 1980s, PHED did pipe water from mountain springs to small tanks in the village. Without a system to
pump the water onward from the tanks, however, the enterprise failed within a month. According to a
PHED representative, an agreement with ten members of the community in 1995/96 had established the
conditions for digging a tubewell some distance from the village and piping water from it to Toolanj.
None of the 70-odd village men who met with Bank staff recalled any such agreement. They did recall
that a well had been dug but had failed to produce water.

23. 
A second well was being tested at the time of the October 2000 Bank visit and, if it proved
productive. water was to be piped to Toolani at a monthly charge of Rs. 50 per household. The village
men said they would be willing to pay that bill but would only believe the reality of piped water when and
if it started to flow. Meanwhile their women and girls (before they reach the age of purdah) tramp to
shallower dug wells once or more a day, wasting time and strength and risking accidents each time they
haul heavy buckets up and over the large logs that cross the mouths of the wells.

InAfrstrurture - Roads and Power

24. 
Mainte-nance and general investment nrohlems are not confined to water supply. They mark the
state of Pakistan's roads and its delivery of electricity, not least for irrigation pumps, as well. In villages
and some cities, residents were q,uick to point out sueh deficiencies and their cost. The 12215 residents of
the Shikarpur District village of Allah Bux Khoso, mostly landless farmers, have to make their way along

tw.o eilometers of unpaved road and across a nA1rrOw and nrmbling concrete bridcre to get to nublic

transport on a paved roadway. If the unpaved road, not repaired since it was built in 1996, were in decent

Sukkur in Sindh province-are barriers transporters cite to the growth of private bus service between
cities and outlying villages and on the congested streets of ShiiKarpur itseif. 
in Punjab, where the bridge
on the Multan-Karachi highway is so ill-maintained that traffic must creep across it. The impact of poor
infrastructure is direct and heavy on the poor and on the prospects for rural development. Pakistanis in the
Dera Ghazi Khan district, Punjab, for instance, tied the sorry state of the roads and, in consequence, of
public transport to high rates of teacher absenteeism, particularly among women teaching at the primary
school level, low rates of school enrollment generally and distressing rates of death in emergency cases
when transport is too slow or unavailable.

26. 
Shortages of electricity are another impediment to poverty reduction. Again, in Allah Bux Khoso,
of two transformers supplied by WAPDA, only one functions. The other has burned out, but villagers
have been unable to get the agency to send a repair crew. 
In Dohk Alwara, 
lack of electricity forces
villagers to use hand pumps-at a. construction cost of about Rs. 25,000 each-to move water from

she should draw her salary while not reporting to work. He went on a tirade against World Bank's
policies and foreign interference-he found it preferable to discussing his and his wife's accountability.

28. 
In the Shikarpur District village of Nim Sharif, for instance, women listed a hospital-along with
a school and drainage-as their top priority. The village has no trained birth attendant or public medical
facility. The nearest hospital is an hour away, too far for one expectant mother in September 2000. She
and her unborn baby died en route. For the 1200 residents of.another ShikarDur village-Allah Bux

Tne most noticeabie shortage in the heaith care field is that of medically trained women, a vital
element in delivering everything from immunizations to neonatal advice to other women. The reason that
there are too few midwives or Lady Health Workers or women doctors, however, does not lie in the
health field. It originates in the failure to educate girls, to give them the skills to take charge of their own
lives and help save the lives of others. Without that empowerment, many of the women with whom Bank
staff spoke mentioned health problems only in passing. The root of their greatest problems, they appeared
to indicate, lies elsewhere.

violations, impose highway tolls and assess taxes. Many small busiriessmen told Bank staff one story of
harassment after another. A WAPDA officiai, for instance, bumed one businessman's electricity meter
after being denied a bribe and then charged the trader with tampering with the apparatus. According to
members of the group, an "army of people" 15 strong typically descend on them to conduct the tax
assessment, usually sending an emissary ahead to intimidate and extort a bribe.

37. 
The assessors include income tax, excise,
police, public health, labor, WAPDA and telephone
officials. In addition, in some areas, army members
have joined the gang of inspectors and bribe-takers.

each averaging 16 months in office. Four democratically elected governments altemated with interim
regimes.
4. 
This deteriorating governance aggravated the inadequacies and opacity of the incentive regime
and regulatory framework. It encouraged rent-seeking by the private sector and discouragecl productivity
growth and international competitiveness. While other developing countries were increasingly integrating
into the global economy, their private sectors becoming more outward looking and less dependent on
government protection, Pakistan's private sector became increasingly inward-looking and dependent on
government interventions. Its weakening performance set the stage for the macroeconomic crisis of the
second-half of the 1990s.
5. 
The current government of Pakistan is determined to turn the situation around. Its r ecent Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (l-PRSP) sets out a sweeping program of political, economic, and
institutional reforms that aim to establish the foundations of an open, modern, and prosperous nation
through revived broad-based growth. The Worid Bank Group's private sector strategy tor Pakistan is
based on support for this program, particularly efforts to improve the investment climate by restoring
private sector confidence in the economy. 
'T'hree areas will receive special attention: the government's
macroeconomic stabilization program; a growth-oriented structural reform agenda that encourages
productivity growth and more efficient resource allocation; and timely implementation of key structural
reforms of the incentive regime and the regulatory framework in infrastructure.

6. 
A clear consensus in Pakistan has emerged that private sector led growth is essential in order to
provide better economic opportunities and to reduce poverty faster. The shift in emphasis has been
characterized by the public sector's withdrawal from production activities through privatization, and by
the substantial advancement of the public sector's role as facilitator and regulator (Table 1).

make up the rest of the sector. During the 1990s, most private investment went to capital-intensive
industries. The share of the "Big Four" capital-intensive industries--sugar, textiles (cotton yarn and gray
cloth), cement, and fertilizer-rose from 28 percent of total value-added in large-scale manufacturing to
more than 40 percent.

Dualistic Industrial Structure
9. 
Large-scale activities dominates manufacturing output (70 percent of value-added) while small
and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) provide the bulk of employment. The most important areas of
activity for the SME sector are grain milling (16 percent), cotton weaving (13 percent), wood and
furniture (10 percent), metal products (7 percent), and other textiles (6 percent). The five largest
industries account for half of the SME sector, and cotton weaving and other textiles are their chief
exports. Although SMEs produce a quarter of manufacturing exports, most are low value-added products
that rely on traditional technologies.

Until the 1990s the government discouraged private sector involvement in most infrastructure
services, from power, oil, and natural gas to transport and telecommunications. And even during the
1990s, despite considerable private investment in thermal power generation and natural gas, weaknesses
in the regulatory framework kept the public sector the dominant supplier in all key areas of infrastructure
services (Table 2).
12. 
Pakistan faces an enormous challenge in meeting its energy needs. Costs in largely state-owned
iriadequate. Tne power sector is largely government
controlled. The state-owned Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Karachi Electric
Supply CorpoULtion (kE SC) together control almost the wnole electric distribution and transmission
market. WAPDA also accounts for 65 percent of generation; 21 independent power producers account

State control also characterizes oil and gas. Both of the largest natural gas Droducers. accounting
for more than 80 percent of total production, and the country's two gas transmission and distribution
companies are state owned, as are extensive assets that include refineries, transport and retail facilities=
The performance of public sector entities has been steadily declining, largely because of the rigidities of
public sector management and weak implementation of structural reforms. Demand for nil and gas has

increased significantly in recent years, mainly from the independent power producers (Box 1). A
mounting consensus holds that substituting natural gas for fuel oil would bring considerable
mnacroeconomic gains, improved performance by power plants, and lower power tariffs.

18. Within manufacturing, the decline in growth was uneven. It was more pronounced in large-scale
manufacturing, with a larger share in manufacturing value added, than in small and medium-size
enterprises (see Table 3), though there is some uncertainty in those figures since the quality of economic
information on small firms is poor. Among large firms, the decline was also more pronounced for export-
oriented industries than for domestic-
oriented industries, which have a much 
larger share of manufacturing value 
added (Chart 2)=

Pakistan's deteriorating export
performance seems to reflect an inability 
to integrate into the global economy and 
participate 
in global production sharing 
(specializing in different stages of the 

production 

chain), 

as many of 

its 

competitors across Asia are doing. While 
competing Asian 
economnies were 
increasingly integrating with the global 
economy, Pakistan's 
trade openness 

declined both 

in absolute 

terms and 

relative to other Asian economies'(Chart
4).

This retreat - particularly dramatic in the textile and clothing industry-contrasts sharply with
trends in Bangladesh, China, India, and Sri Lanka, where textile and clothing exports performed
significantly better than in Pahistan. 
'T'hese competitors capitalized on their comparative advantage m
labor-intensive clothing production by establishing zero-tariff schemes for imports of needed raw
materials such as cotton and blended yarns and fabrics. China's intra-industry trade index in textiles, for
example, increased from 34 percent to 54 percent during the last decade, enabling China to develop its
clothing industry and become the world's largest clothing exporter (Table 5).

An unfriendly business climate 
helps to explain the declining economic 
performance and stagnating poverty of the 
1990s. Yet the incentive regime (the trade 
and investment regimes, industrial policies,
tax administration and regulations) of the 1990s did not look very different from that of the 1980s. If
anything, it should have been better. The government had initiated a series of structural reforms in the
1990s, notably reform of the financial sector, government withdrawal from manufacturing, and external
trade reforms.

substituting and capital-intensive industries (fertilizer, cement, synthetic fibers, motor vehicles) while
discriminating heavily against exports by raising the cost of inputs and raw materials. Exports were hurt
further by dysfunctional duty drawback schemes managed by the Central Board of Revenue. The bias
against exnort-oriented industries helps explain Pakistan's noor exnort nerformance during the 1990s.
28. 
Policy shifts in 1997 began a move toward world prices. In April-May 1997, the maximum tariff
was lowered from 65 percent to 45 percent and the number of slabs from 1 1 to 5. By January 2003, the
number of tariff exemptions and concessions (SROs) is to be reduced; the maximum tariff is to be cut to
25 percent; and slabs are to drop to three.
29. 
Although these changes look significant (chart 9) they do not tell the fihll stnry. While the
number of SROs has been cut, they still account for a 30 percent of the difference between potential duty
collections (had all imports paid the fill statu_torv du ty) and actual collections. Mnost of t!ne rem.minig

30. 
All this means that by 2002 the private sector is likely to be increasingly exposed to international
competition, but the anti-export bias and nontransparent trade regime remains. The tariff reductions and
rapid devaluation of the currency since 2000 are probably behind the improvements in export
performance in recent years. But the trade regime and prospective reforms need to be assessed carefullv
for their effectiveness in correcting the anti-export bias and in improving the terms of trade to encourage
faster growth and a greater export orientation. International experience suggests that low, uniform tariffs
would do much to spur a more efficient allocation of resources in the economy, eliminating the anti-
export bias and encouraging competitiveness and nroductivity growth.

Industrial Poieies Have Discouraged Productvity Growth and Contributed to Decing Openness
31. 
Since the early 1990s. the govemment has gradually withdrawn from direct involvement in
manufacturing. 
It continues, however, to attempt to pick winners through its industrial policies despite

increasing evidence that these policies discouirage 

nrodiuctiivity grnwth and restruinfiring i.n significadnt

manufacturing industries.
32. 
industrial policies are also likely to have played a key role in the decreasing openness of the
economy during the 1990s (see Chart 2) and the bias in resource allocation away from export-oriented
and labor-intensive small and medium-size enterprises and toward domestic market-oriented and capital-
intensive industries (see Charts 6 and 7). Constraints on private investment tightened during the 1990s,
initially 
in domestic financing and later 
in extemal 
financing (see Chart 8) as reserves and
macroeconomic imbalances mounted. In this increasingly restrictive setting, the government's industrial
policy assumed greater importance by lowering perceived risks for private investors (by raising retums
both over and under the table). As Box 2 illustrates, this intensified the bias of private investment toward

inward-looking and capital-intensive industries where government can more easily "protect" returns on
canital than it can for exnort-oriented industries.

FLuaucial Policies and Institutions Are Still Weak

Until 1997, the banking system was dominated by public institutions and suffered from
inadequate prudential regulaotin and sunervi:sion and a .weak legral and judicial envirnnmernt Rv the mid-
1990s, public sector banks were in severe distress, a consequence of poor governance in the banking

system and deteriorng ,govemnane in the incentivee repaime nf the real sector. Developu men-nt finance

assets was especially acute in the fertilizer and sugar sectors; non-performing loans totaled 89 percent of
advances to th'e fertiuizer industry and 60 percent to the sugar industry.
34. 
The government introduced reforms in 1997 to strengthen governance and financial discipline in
the banking sector. The reforms upgraded prudential regulation and strengthened the auth,ority of the
central bank to supervise banks and enforce regulations, imDroved legal and judicial processes for
enforcing financial contracts and facilitating foreclosures, and initiated corporate governance reforms in
the nationalized commercial banks.

36. 
The second is that weaknesses in the legal and judicial system impede corporate restructuring and
asset restructuring by the financial system. The stronger than normal links between s-olvency and
performance in the corporate and financial sectors in Paldstan because of the heavy concentration and co-
mingling of political and economic powers make it especially critical that corporate restructuring
accompany bank restructuring. Future growth depends as much on restructurine induistries where
overcapacity or low productivity is rampant (such as cement, textiles, and chemicals) as on new
investmnents. And future growth requires a financial system that facilitates the reallocation of resources
from low to high efficiency sectors or fims. Thus the long-term success of financial sector reforms,
including bank privatization, hinges on strengthening the legoal and judicial framework to facilitate the
exit of fi-rms and the foreclosure or restructuring of distressed assets by financial institutions. While some
progzress has been made (in bankruptcy law. for example). much more remains to be done.

37. 
During the 1990s, the government tried to make the investment regime more attractive to
foreigners, especially in certain sectors of the economy. It established the Board of Investment as a "one-
stop shop" to facilitate and coordinate the needs of foreign (and domestic) investors. Notably, the new
investment policy announced in 1997 lifted the requirement that foreign imnvestrs get government
approval for projects. It also eliminated foreign exchange restrictions; allowed remittances of salaries,

profits, and dividends without restriction or innrova! of the Stqte Bank; remnoved 

ill cnntrnlv on the

transfer of technology; and eliminated ceilings on the amount of royalties or technical fees a technology

38. 
Yet the latest Foreign Investment Advisory Service study (FIAS 1999) found that, "Pakistan is an
inefficient investment location, with the country becoming less attractive relative to other investment
locations in the Region." Moreover, "whilst appropriate on paper, [the current foreign investment regime]
is simply not implemented at the ground level." The study noted that the investment policy was subject to
both inconsistent interpretation and arbitrary changes. FDI was encouraged through directed incentives
such as user-based import tariff concessions or exemptions (on raw material and other inputs), high tariff
protection on output, exemptions from income and sales taxes, exclusive licenses or franchises, and other
special treatment. Implementation of these measures failed to create a transparent and level playing field
for investors, instead encouraging rent-seeking at the expense of intemational competitiveness and
productivity growth.

Palcistan than elsewhere in all its aspects. Policy instability and difficult access to financing (especially
high interest rates and highn collaterai requirements) stand out as particularly damaging to the business
climate (Chart 11). The policy instability reflects the unfolding macroeconomic crisis of the late 1990s,
policy slippages or reversals of successive governments througnout the i990s, and the deteriorating
governance in public institutions and economic management that created a lack of transparency and
predictability in government policies. While tax administration is a criticai constraint for the entire
private sector, regulation is more of a binding constraint for small and medium-size-enterprises (Box 3).

more than 80 percent of the respondents cited regulations.as a major barrier in their smooth functioning

Recognizing these problems, the government set up a Task Force on the Reform of Tax
Administration. The radical reforms it recommended in an April 2001 report, endorsed in the 2001
budget, focus on reducing the number of taxes at federal and provincial levels as well as tax rates and
penalties. The program also calls for simplification of assessment and collection procedures, reform of
labor levies, greater efficiency in dispute resolution, broadening of the tax base, and honesty and
efficiency in administration.

Regulation. Regulatory constraints include lack of predictability of laws and regulations related
to customs, business, labor,.environment, and foreign investment, among others (see Table 6). The
World Bank Business Environment Survey of 1995 had already identified the constraints caused by
Pakistan's poor business climate (Private Sector Assessment 1996). Recent survey work suggests that
conditions have worsened. Most regulatory roadblocks place a bigger burden on small firms than large
ones, encouraging them to remain in the informal sector (see Table 6 and Charts 12 A&B). Because trade
regulations protect many domestic producers, it is not surprising that few firms consider the trade regime
to be especially burdensome.
'40. 
wnat many ousinesses object to in ihc reguiatory framework is tne uncertainty: regulations are
unpredictable, changing without advance notice or consultation, and interpretations are inconsistent. On
average businesses report being informed in advance about changes in policies that affect them "seldom"
or "sometimes," with 45 percent of enterprises reporting that they are "never" or "seldom" informed in
advance. More than a third (37 percent) of the firms in the Pakistani sampie agreed to some extent that
information on laws and regulations is not easy to obtain.
47. 
To improve the regulatory environment for businesses, the government recently established a

Committee for Reforms in Regulatory, Legal and Policv Environment. Building on the govemment's

ongoing regulatory reforms, the committee is mapping out a comprehensive program of regulatory reform
includina the imnlementation stens needed to lower Costq of doing husiness and enhancing international
competitiveness of industry in Pakistan. Because of the many sectors involved and the links between the
center and the provinces in regulatorv affairs. coherent and effective reform will require significnnt
coordination among a wide range of government departments and ministries. And it will require strong
commitment ove.r time-

48. 
Infrastructure services also suffer from a weak regulatory framework that hurts the investment
climate by inhibiting private investment in infrastructure, undermines the competitiveness of the
economy, and exacerbates macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Since the mid-1990s, the government has
pursued policies aimed at attracting private sector investment in infrastructure. However, progress has
been impeded by the risks stemming from a weak and unstable regulatory framework for the efficient
provision of infrastructure services.
49. 
Altnough Pakistan was one of the first developing countries to open its power sector to private
investment in the mid-1990s and thereby eliminate much of the generation capacity shortage, its
mishandiing of the independent power producers crisis of i997 snattered private sector confidence,
particularly for foreign investors (see Box 1). Despite the new capacity, reliability and efficiency remain
poor, the sector's financial position has deteriorated, and only a little more than half the population (about
55 percent) has access to electricity.
50. 
To reinvigorate the power sector reform program, the government, in a new policy statement in

199R8 reiterated its commitment to the establishment within 5-10 years of a comnetitive nnwer syste_m_

made up of autonomous, financially viable, and largely privately owned generation, transmission, and

distribution entities. An indenendent remilatnrv agoencv (NFPRA) would oversee the sector. The firet

phase of the program, now under implementation, 

focuses on the financial restructuring and

utility's operational and financial performance, the government has opted for fast-track privatization, with
the help of t.he Asian DeVelopr.me.nt Bankl.
51. 
Even with these measures, many regulatory implementation issues remain. Tariff standards and
rules are vague, and clear policy guidelines from the government on future competitive market structure
are lacking. Private investors are unlikely to respond unless further progress is made on creating an
enabling regulatory environment in the sector by strengthening the independence of the regulatory agency
(NEPRA), reducing regulatory risks by moving toward formula-based and multiyear tariff setting
mechanisms, and establishing a legal framework for safeguarding foreign investments.

53. 
While gas exploration was encouraged by promises of remunerative well-head Drices under the
1994 petroleum policy, production never materialized because the policy was not implemented. A weak
regulatory framework and contract disputes discouraged further investments by the private sector. The
main regulatory issues are low and administered prices at the retail level, involving heavy subsidies to
fertilizer and households; low and administered well-head prices for existing state-owned nroducers-
inability of new producers to enter into long-term contractual relationships with consumers because of the
administered gas allocation system. Additionally, pricing arrangements for the state-owned tranmisssion
and distribution companies discourage efficiency and cost savings and are inconsistent with the gas
pricing regime. The institutional environment is also defective; the Ministrv of Petroleun and Natul
Resources plays the conflicting roles of policymaker, regulator, and market participant.
54. 
The government has taken steps to redress some of these inadequacies, appointing experienced
staff, for example, to the management and boards of state-owned companies. A new gas pricing
framework adopted in March 2001 uses international oil prices in setting well-head prices; phases in

Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy 

Annex ii

adjustments in consumer prices that reflect cost of service; phases out subsidies over a three-year period,
except for existing fertilizer contractuai obligantons and for a lifeline rate for nousenolds; and establishes
a Gas Regulatory Authority. The new fertilizer policy, however, is inconsistent with the new gas pricing
framework in many respects. T-he latter continues a dual (feedstock and fuei) gas pricing regime thai sets
domestic feedstock gas prices at parity wit-h Middle East prices (around $0.77/mmbtu) when Pakistan's
opportunity cost of gas is considerably higher (around $1.76/mmbtu) and introduces a new feedstock
subsidy for future plants with a 10-year price lock-in feature.
55. 
The inefficient transport system is another drag on Pakistan's competitiveness. The World Bank
esti.martes th.at trAnznnrt weaknesses canse annual nmn etitiveneqs-based losses of some Rs.220 billion, or
6 percent of GDP. Similarly, inefficient public sector utilities impose a heavy fiscal burden on the

economy tat a tim.e when more public investments in infinrstucture and human develonment (health.

education) are badly needed.
56. 
The current government is addressing some of the key transport problems. The National
Highway Authority, rather than focusing on constructing new roads, is emphasizing completing ongoing
projects, upgrading existing corridors, and mobilizing resources for maintenance through tolls. The new
management of Pakistan Railways cut losses in 2000 some 25 percent over the previous year by reducing
excess staff, rehabilitating assets, and shedding non-core operations. The freight business has huge
potential and could interest private sector investors if the right framework were in place, but Pakistan
Railways is reluctant to give up its freight business, which cross-subsidizes its passenger services.
Although Pakistan Railways had once indicated a willingness to consider letting private freight operators
run their own trains in exchange for a track access fee, the government's draft National Transport Policy
(March 2001) contains no mention of private- sector participation in any form. 
Furthermore,
implementation has stalled on a government decision to gradually phase in private operating concessions
at all ports. In aviation, the sale of shares of Pakistan International Airlines to strategic investors has been
proposed, but substantial pre-privatization technical and financial restructuring would be needed to attract
private sector interest.
57. 
Pakistan's rich and extensive mineral resources (zinc, copper, gold, iron ore, coal, marble, among

$1.7 billion, or 3 percent of GDP and tax revenues to central and local governments of $200 million a
year. Development of mineral resources would also act a powerful en^.gLIne of growtu 
for SMEs and
local community development in largely remote regions of the country, such as Balochistan. Today,
however, mineraI exploitation contributes barely 0.4 percent of GDP despi e go-verrnment's in erest in
developing the sector.
58. 
The mining industry is dominated by the public sector through federal and regional development
corporations, with little foreign investor involvement. There is little or no modem exploration, and what
little development has occurred has been restricted to simple technologies and has been poorly planned
and managed, especially the environmental and social imnacts. The main reasons for the missed
opportunities are the uncertainty created by the inadequacies of mining concession rules, which fail to
meet international standards; lack of supporting infrastructure (such as railway freight); and perceptions
of political and security risk associated with the geographic location of the bulk of mineral resources

Ra1nchistan)

59. 
The federal government recently issued 
its National Minerals Policy, which approaches
intemational standards and provides a basis for improving the business environment. It has also created an
export processing zone arrangement for export-oriented mineral development (for example, Saindak
prospect). These recent developments are steps in the right direction, but they remain untested. And more
remains to be done to bring the mining regulatory structure up to international standards and make it
attractive to foreign investors. Modemization of the regulatory framework rests largely with provincial
governments but will also require further actions by the federal government (such as in foreign exchange
and trade regulations) to provide the right incentives to private investors and to provincial governments to
modemize.

Macroeconomic stabilization is the first priority for reducing poverty and improving the business
climate since it will reduce policy instability, the leading deterrent to business confidence. The
stabilization program (fiscal adjustment, flexible exchange rate regime, and tight monetary policies)
together with high indebtedness and limited extemal financing leave the central government with very
little maneuvering room for encouraging private sector-led growth. 
In particular, the stabilization
program imposes strict limits on the capacity to increase public (and private) investment in the economy.

"Sustained pro-poor economic growth, based on robust private sector activity and enhanced
investment, are the main elements of Pakistan's [I-PRSP]. Therefore, the essence of Pakistan's poverty
reduction strategy is to maintain an environment conducive to trade and investment, including foreign
investment" (I-PRSP, p. 23). Promoting private sector-led growth in agriculture, services, and export-
oriented manufacturing will therefore be critical for accelerating growth and poverty reduction and
reducing Pakistan's vulnerability to internal and external shocks.

generation and has neglected external markets, productivity growth, and international competitiveness. It
atributes tne siow pace and ina-pprupriave ptLwrn 01 growmn to tne long neglect of te agriculitural sector
and misguided policies in manufacturing, as well as an inadequate macroeconomic environment,
insufficient investments in 'numan capital, and weak infrastructure. Accordingly, recognizing the need to
spur greater export orientation and more labor-intensive growth, it envisions complementing trade and
financial sector reiorms with reforms 
in Keys sectors nlKe agriculwre, maustry, mirasuructure, and
information technology.
69. 
To revive private sector growth, sectoral committees will be constituted with all key stakeholders
to develop recommendations for the textile, chemical, engineering goods, automobile, and edible oil
sectors. 
In manufactured exports, the prime concern is to encourage the production of value-added
nroducts in Pakistan's textile exports, mainly garments. As these are labor intensive, they also have high
potential for employment generation. Within manufacturing, SMEs have been earmarked as holding the
greatest notential for generating emnlovment and creating an exnort base in the countrv. The focus is on
programs for developing managerial, technical, and informational support for SMEs.
70. 
in trade, the government intends to reduce maximum tariffs to 25 percent by 2003 and the
number of tariff slabs to three, to rationalize duty drawback and export-financing schemes for exporters,
and to comply with the WTO trade regime and standards.

The World Bank Group's Private Sector Assistance Strategy
74. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) private sector strategy aims to support the Government of
Pakistan (GOP) in encouraging dynamic private sector-led growth that can reduce poverty more
effectively, while reducing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, and fostering productivity growth and
efficient resource allocation. Based on WBG's diagnostic work, this would be achieved by supporting the
government in pursuing the following outcomes:
* Establishing a more neutral incentive regime that significantly reduces the appareni bias against
exports, labor-intensive industries and SMEs, and productivity growth in key industries; key
elements of this outcome include: furtner trade liberaiization; policy adjustments to facilitate the
reallocation of resources from less to more efficient industries and firms, and restructuring of
large scale manufacturing industries.

* 

creating an investrnent friendly regrime that is attractive to fnreign and tinTnestic investnrs; key

elements include: transparent trade policy formulation, deregulation, tax administration reform
nind nnlicyv tnhilitv

* Strengthening the financial sector to mobilize resources for private investment; lkey elements
include: commercial bank privatization, development of capital markets, and expansion of
commercial microfinance.
While the outcomes being sought are clear, the Bank still needs to come to an agreement with the

working with the government, through continued dialogue and analytical work, has been enhanced. This

process ha Ws inclueAd.

* Analytical inputs: The Bank has provided inputs to policy-making through sectoral notes on
fertilizer and cement industries, an Investment Climate note by World Bank's Chief Economist,
and an SME Policy note based on a country-wide survey; IFC has provided advice on financial
market development, including reviews of insurance and housing finance.
* Capacity building: Given that thre government has been responsive to analytical inputs and
dialogue, the Bank has followed on its support through capacity building efforts. Amongst other
things, this has included: (i) an iTJF grant to push forward the dereguiation agenda through the
recently established Committee for Reforns in Regulatory and Legal Policy Environment; (ii) an
LDF grant to support the government's championing of tax administration reforms through the
establishment of a Task Force on Tax Administration Reforms in 2000. Based on the
recommendations of the Task Force, a program of reform was approved in November 2001 by the
President; the Bank is providing a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to implement amd prepare a
project for restructuring of tax administration, along the lines recommended by the Task Force;
and (iii) in response to a government request, a three-day WTO training workshop was organized
by the WBG, in joint sponsorship with the Ministry of Commerce. Aside from disseminating
information regarding WTO, its requirements and implications, it helped to build capacity within
the government.

To provide continuing support to COP for its evolvi.ng PS1 
.strategyq 
the World Bank Cironun will
focus on four key areas, selected on the basis of WBG's diagnostic and their impact on growth and
poverty reduction, and of the Group's comparative advantage:
* Supporting economy-wide policy and institutional reforms that improve the overall incentive
regime and investment climate, and cataly ing private investment 
in response 
to these
improvements;
* Supporting the establishment of regulatory frameworks in the key growth-supporting sectors of
gas, mining, power and telecom, and catalyzing private investments under these new frameworks;
* Building the knowledge base on constraints to private sector development; and
* Supporting the further development of thefinancial sector to improve availability of financing for
private investment.
In alignment to the outcomes being sought, support by the WBG will be provided in the form of

77. 

following instruments:

* Policy dialogue and adjustment lending to suDDort the imDlementation of macroeconomic and
sectoral reforms aimed at improving the investtnent climate and overall incentive regime;
* Advisory work to support institutionai and reguiatory reform, inciuding privatization;
* Analytical work to improve understanding of constraints to Drivate investment and Droductivitv
growth, and identify institutional, policy and regulatory frameworks which will encourage private
investment and productivity growth;
* Equity and loan investments and guarantees to mobilize private investment in reformed sectors
78. 
The World Bank will take the lead in analytical and advisory work, drawing on the perspectives
of IFC and MIGA, and in supporting GOP reforms. IFC will invest equity and loan finance, and make
partial credit guarantees; MIGA will offer political risk insurance through its guarantee program. The
matrix below summarizes the Private Sector Strategy and World Bank Group interventions in support of
them.

Improving the Investment Climate
79. 
Tne Worid Bank will support economy-wide policy and regulatory reforms through balance of
payment operations and technical assistance in areas such as tax administration by the Central Board of
Revenue and deregulation of industriai, business, and labor regulations. Tnis dovetails with the World
Bank's program of support for strengthening government effectiveness. Strengthening public institutions

like the CBR both imDroves the accountabilitv and efficiencv of the Dublic sector and improves the
investment climate for the public sector.

80. 
Consistent with the Bank's earlier diagnostic, priority will be given to elements of the trade
regime that discourage export orientation and participation in global production sharing, productivity
growth, and international competitiveness. Actions would include timely implementation of scheduled
tariff reforms, the phasing out of regulatory duties that still provide protection well beyond the maximum
tariff rates, the elimination of SROs that distort resource allocation or undermine business conficlence, and
reforms of the tax administration to eliminate the shortfalls of general sales tax refunds and duty
drawbacks to exporters. External trade reforms would need to be complemented by selected economy-
wide (e.g., labor, business) or sector-specific regulatory reforms to relieve constraints that are holding
back private investment (domestic and foreign) and productivity growth.

81. 
The Bank will continue to encourage the federal and provincial governments to pursue the trade
liberalization and modernization of industrial, business and labor regulations that are already under way.
A Committee for Reforms in Regulatory and Legal Policy Environment was recently established (January
2002) to review commercial and labor regulations with a view to eliminate those that constrain
competition and/or impose unnecessary compliance costs. A World Bank team has started to support the
Committee and will work with the government in identifying policy measures in these areas that could be
supported by adjustment lending.

82. 
At the provincial level, the Bank's iialogue and proposea assistance to Sminh ana INWIw', which
sought Bank's assistance, will also focus on reforms that fall within the provinces' purview (such as labor
and industrial regulations) to improve the investment climate.

In Detroleum, the Bank Group will continue to supDort the government's reform guided by the
important program of analytical work carried out in FY01. Over the next three years the focus will be on
advancing the implementation of the deregulatory reforms to strengthen competition in the sector and
assisting with the privatization of the Oil and Gas Development Corporation Ltd and Pakistan State Oil
Ltd expected to take place by March 2003.

The World Bank Group will accord greater priority than in the past to development of the mining
sector, because of its potential importance in improving macroeconomic stability through external and
fiscal accounts and broadening access to growth and employment opportunities geographically and
socially. While the expected benefits will materialize beyond the planning horizon of this CAS, the
immediate objective of the 'Worid Bank Group will be to support establishment of a modern reguiatory
environment for mining that enhances Pakistan's competitive position in attracting private investment and
encourages environmental and social sustainability. Ine strategy will focus on supporting the federal and
provincial governments in their elaboration and implementation of a modern regulatory framework and
improving their capacity to mranage the instability of govern-ent revenues associated wi't extractive
industries. The Bank will respond to client "pull" from both central and provincial govemments (such as

the power set'tnr particularly for the privati7fA Arih:ulinn cmor.par.ies. LTC will also continue to act as
adviser to the government on the privatization of Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO).

88. 
Since improved connectivity is essential for growth, including that of the IT industry, and for the
poor to benefit from technological change, the Bank CGroun will continue its dialogue with the
government on an adequate regulatory framework to attract private investment. 
In FY02, MIGA
supported a software development project in Karachi by Jananese investors and is looking at a telecom
project in FY03. IFC and MIGA will seek opportunities to support the growth of the 1T industry.

Building the Knowledge Base
89. 
In order to underpin this assistance strategy and the policy dialogue, the World Bank Group will
need to build its knowledge base about the main impediments to an improved investment climate. While
the broad impediments have been identified -- trade and investment regime, industrial policies, tax
administration, business and labor regulations-- the precise microeconomic distortions of the investment
climate and incentive regime and their relative impact on productivity growth, resource allocation, and
private investment need to be identified and quantified more precisely. For example, more needs to be
known about the impact of the current and prospective (2003) trade regime on private sector incentives in
order to judge the effectiveness of trade reforms in encouraging stronger and more export-oriented
growth.

90. 
In documenting these domestic constraints, priority will be given to industries with the potential
to contribute significantly to macroeconomic stability, growth and employment. The textiles and clothing
industry is an obvious candidate. With close to 80 percent of merchandise export earnings, the industry
approaches the imminent phase-out of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in need of crucial domestic reforms
that can put it back in competition after a decade of losing ground (see Table 3). Another candidate might
be the sugar industry. Current sugar policies 
that fuel the huge sugar cycles that destabilize
manufacturing and agricuitural growth also retard productivity growth in the mills and on the farm and
discourage more efficient use of scarce water resources.

91. 
In addition to an informal private sector assessment jointly prepared by the IFC and the World
Bank in FYr , and an SM1E Policy ivote describing tne key features of Sivus ana their constraints
(emerging from a business survey also conducted in FY01), the program of analytical work includes: (i) a

Development Policy Review (to be completed in FY02) which will provide thie Bank's assessmnent of the
adequacy of the current development policy agenda to achieve rapid growth and poverty reduction; (ii) a
'Trade Policy note (to be completed in FY04); (iii) an tiuiI Administrative Barriers Reform study to be

manufacturing firms, small and large. To build domestic capacity for tius analyticai and monimring work
in the future, the study is being carried out jointly with SMEDA.

IFC will supDort the emergence of strong Drivate commercial banks and Non-Bank Financial
Institutions through selective investments. The IFC will also support the development of new financial
products to better meet the needs of the private sector (e.g.. long-term fmance for infrastructure, access to
finance in agriculture/agribusiness, guarantees for SME finance). Such products should also expand
access to financial services to new clients (e.g. the bankable poor through micro-finance institutions or
leasing institutions) and to under-served SM[Es.

ANNEX IV: MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGs), TARGETS AND SELECT OUTPUT
INDICATORS FOR PAKISTAN

1. 
This note summarizes the long term indicators consistent with the MDGs for Pakistan, the
baseline data issues, and the output indicators selected as part of the monitoring and evaluation exercise
for Pakistan's PRSP. The I-PRSP for Pakistan provides an elaborate M&E framework, outlining the
various issues surrounding the choice of indicators and the related sources of data and measurement (see
I-PRSP document, Annex 1, final version Dec 4t" 2001). This note will also describe the progress made so
far on these technical issues as well as on the process of reaching a consensus on these and the
institutional accountabilities for this exercise.

Tracking Progress towards Millennium Development Goals

2. 
Table 1 below summarizes the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the long term
indicators that will be tracked at the national level, along with the sources for these indicators. The long-
term indicators proposed to measure progress towards the MDGs are readily available from existing
databases. A few outstanding issues however remain, w'hich require timely resolution.

> fle challenge, however, is to reconcile the baselines in instances (e.g. gross enroliment rates)
where more than one source of information exist. The PRSP Implementation Committee under
the PRSP Secretariat (Ministry of Finance), in consultation with the relevant ministries and the
Federal Bureau of Statistics, would need to identify the source to be used for baseline and
tracking of sucn indicators. 
in tne interim, we have recommended the Pakistan, integrated
Household Survey (PIHS 1998-99) as the preferred source, since it is a representative household
survey t'hat is regularly fielca. 
iLms wiii aiso ensure ithat capacity-building can be focused on
the agency currently accountable for the PIHS.

3. 

Given the issues raised above, particularly the ones outlined in the first two bullets, the targets

should be seen as indicative. Moreover, for some indintnrc thtar mnnitnr2hle (smuh ns the nnes in

Table 2), targets are not meaningful. 

Tracking progress towards MDGs, which comprise of

internationally set goals, will be challenginga where the firt.t step will he to a 

how realistic suich goals,

are in the specific context of Pakistan. The Bank is facilitating this process in Palcistan, using SIMSIP (a
simulation software nackage develoned by the Bank) to assess how realistic these targets are. in
conjunction with the exercise of costing the targets. The regional workshop made a beginning in this
direction. by conducting training sessions for representatives for all countries in the reffion. including
those from Pakistan.

Poverty Monitoring and Tracking of Output Indicators

4. 
In order to measure progress towards the MDGs, it will be necessary to track some output
indicators that change over short spans of time, are leading indicators for the goals, and provide feedback
to policymakers about the results of policy initiatives on the ground. Such indicators should be monitored
regularly - annually or semi-annually - so that the findings can inform policymakers on a continuous
basis. Table 2 provides a list of such output indicators for Pakistan. This list has evolved from the
monitoring framework provided by the I-PRSP, further refined at the workshop held by the PRSP
Secretariat to bring about consensus among provincial and district authorities on the selection of
indicators. 
Implementation of this monitoring mechanisms will require finalization of the set of
indicators, setting up mechanisms to collect the information, and building capacity for rapid analysis of
the data gathered.

5. 

The process outlined above entails the following steps in the context of Pakistan:

> Evaluation of existing monitoring systems, like the management information systems for
education and health (NEMIS and HMIS), identifying bottlenecks and possible' areas of
improvement. This is likely to be completed by May 1, 2002 with the help of DFID consultants.

> Creating a database to measure the selected output indicators; this involves identifying new data
sources, as well as developing a survey-based tool that is easy to administer, implement, and
covers a large sample that is representative at the district level. Most importantly, the analysis of
the data must be completed with a quick turnaround time, to have maximum impact onl policy
formulation.

> In the context of Pakistan, given the criticality of improving service delivery, the survey tool
should collect information at the facility level, as well as the household level. This, when
triangulated with the expenditure tracking exercise (which is part of the proposed monitoring
frameworkt), will provide a quick and effective diagnostic of progress in education, health and
targeting efficiency of the major poverty programs.

6. 
We expect the full implementation of this monitoring exercise to be completed by the end of this
calendar year. A critical outstanding issue is to clarify the institutional arrangements and accountability
for implementing the monitoring exercise. Ongoing dialogue is expected to expedite this process. In the
context of Pakistan, institutional accountability and the roles and responsibilities of CIPRID and PRSP
Secretariat would need to be specified.
