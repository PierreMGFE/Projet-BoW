I. 

INTRODUCTION

1. 
Poland's relationship with the World Bank Group (WBG) is both a partnership of
choice and a two-way knowledge partnership. It is based on mutual trust and on the
recognition that the WBG's presence in the country continues to generate value-added for both
sides - for Poland through access to financial and knowledge services to support its convergence
process within the European Union (EU) - for the WBG through the strengthening of a solid
relationship with an emerging actor on the global development scene and the development of
sophisticated knowledge products which can inform the sectoral dialogue in other countries. The
authorities are interested in further strengthening this partnership and in benefiting from a broad
range of WBG services. Yet, the WBG is a relatively minor player in Poland and needs to
coordinate closely with the European Commission (EC) and to engage selectively only in those
areas where it can add the most value, in line with its overall strategy.

2. 
The ongoing partnership provides a sound basis to design the new WBG program.
The previous World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was discussed by the Board of
Executive Directors on June 30, 2009. It was devised to help mitigate the negative effects of the
global economic and financial crises on Poland through a series of Development Policy Loans
(DPLs) and advisory services across a number of niche areas. The 2011 Progress Report adjusted
the CPS by (i) framing the WBG engagement within the broader context of Poland's EU
membership and the "Europe 2020" strategy, and (ii) incorporating selective engagement by the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy
following a period of limited IFC activity in Poland.

3. 
This partnership is to continue to evolve in the coming period, to reflect Poland's
economic and social progress as well as the challenges the country continues to face (including
in view of the external environment). While the government has indicated its preference not to
graduate from the WBG at this stage, and while WBG management concurs that a continued
engagement can bring mutual benefits, both parties agree on the need to further transform the
nature of the WBG involvement, with a strengthened strategic focus on boosting shared
prosperity, an 
increased 
reliance on knowledge products, and the use of cost-sharing
arrangements to finance selected advisory and analytical services.

4. 
Against this backdrop, the FY14-17 CPS' two-fold aim is: (i) to foster sustainable
income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population within the context of Poland's
economic convergence process within the EU, and (ii) to support Poland's emerging role as
a global development partner. The WBG program is expected to remain very selective and
demand-driven engagement. It will rest on four strategic engagement areas, which are aligned
with the "Europe 2020" strategic agenda of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth and with the
national development strategy 1: (i) economic competitiveness; (ii) equity and inclusion;
(iii) climate action; and (iv) Poland as a global development partner. A CPS Progress Report
in FY16 will take stock of implementation and will allow the WBG to make mid-term
adjustments in the strategy if and as may be needed to respond to changing needs and to ensure

1 The Government's strategy is articulated in the following key strategic government documents: "Poland 2030 - Development
Challenges" (2009), "National Development Strategy 2020 - Active Society, Competitive Economy, Efficient State" (2012),
"Republic of Poland - Convergence Programme" (2012 Update) and "Republic of Poland - National Reform Programme -
Europe 2020" (Update 2012/2013).

1

a continued alignment with the country's priorities and the WBG strategy. The CPS Progress
Report may also revisit the desirable pace and timing of graduation.

5. 
The CPS is informed by the WBG's overall strategic goals. In a country like Poland,
where extreme poverty is marginal, the WBG program is aimed at promoting shared prosperity -
economic competitiveness, to spur economic growth in a difficult external environment - equity
and inclusion, to ensure that the benefits of growth are enjoyed by the bottom 40 percent of the
population - and climate action to support the sustainability of Poland's economic and social
development. The CPS is also aligned with the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Regional
Strategy, which is aimed at supporting inclusive and sustainable globalization through a focus on
competitiveness, inclusion, and climate change and a renewed emphasis on governance as
a cross-cutting theme. The Regional Strategy is based on a close partnership with the EU and
requires country programs to respond flexibly with financial and analytical support to any
spillover effects from the Euro zone crisis. The design of the FY14-17 CPS for Poland reflects
these priorities and also stresses that countries in the ECA region and beyond could gain from
knowledge transfers out of Poland.

II. 

POLAND: POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

A. POLITICAL PROFILE

6. 
Poland has become a major actor within the EU. With a population of about 38.2
million, and a GNI per capita of US$12,480 (2011), Poland has the largest economy in Central
Europe. Since joining the EU in 2004, the country's ambitions have been marked by the desire to
fully catch up with the core of the EU in terms of economic growth and living standards (GNI
per capita currently stands at only 63 percent of the EU average) and to become one of the
drivers of European integration.

7. 
The Government has a mandate for further economic reform. Poland is a stable
parliamentary democracy with a decentralized system of government.2 The coalition formed in
late 2007 by the Civic Platform (PO) and the Polish Peasants Party (PSL), and led by Prime
Minister Donald Tusk (PO), obtained a second four-year mandate in October 2011 (the first time
in recent Polish history a governing coalition is not replaced after elections). With a small but
workable majority in Parliament, the government has shown a determined, yet cautious approach
to reforms. It was able to adopt and implement several ambitious policy measures, in particular
in the areas of fiscal consolidation, business environment, and pensions. The next general
elections are scheduled for the fall of 2015.

B. SOCIAL PROFILE (POVERTY AND GENDER)

8. 
Poverty has been on a declining trend since 2004 but the pace of reduction slowed
down with the 2008-09 global financial crisis (Figure 1). About 6.5 percent of the population

2 The country, is divided into 16 regions (voivodships), subdivided into 373 districts (powiats) which are in turn made up of 2489
municipalities (gminas). All subnational Governments are elected.

2

still lives below the national poverty line and 11.8 percent live on less than US$ 5 a day (ECA
poverty income threshold). The incidence of poverty is generally high among the unemployed,
families with household heads with low education, families with several children (44 percent of
families with more than 3 children), and households in small towns and rural areas. There is also
a relatively large cohort of working poor: at 11.4 percent the poverty rate among employed
people is the fifth highest in the EU. With the slowdown of poverty reduction, there is a risk that
some of the affected groups will be trapped in long-term economic and social marginalization.

9. 
The crisis has also had a negative impact on the bottom 40 percent. Before the crisis,
per capita income growth of this group outpaced the growth rate for the total population. Since
2009, per capita income growth for the bottom 40 percent fell behind the growth rate for the
entire population. In 2011 it also turned negative (see Figure 2). The average per capita income
of the bottom 40 percent stands at 49.6 percent of the overall average (for the entire population).
While all other groups have recorded some gains in the period 2008 to 2011, the income per
capita of the lowest decile has essentially remained unchanged.

From 2006 to 2011, the real value of the social assistance threshold was declining, as the threshold was not updated to keep
pace with inflation, leading to a sharper decline than in the comparable ECA US$5/day moderate poverty threshold.

10. There remains a substantial gender gap in the labor market. The CPS FY14-17 is
based on the 2012 OECD report "Closing the Gap - Act Now" which includes country level
gender disaggregated data for Poland on employment, education, entrepreneurship and public
policies in general (a summary for Poland is contained in the "Country Note for Poland"
published in parallel to the OECD report). This and other available gender diagnostics 4 point to
several persistent issues, especially in terms of labor force participation: in 2011, 59 percent of
women and 73 percent of men (aged 15-64 years) participated in the labor force. This gap was
particularly large for 25-35 year olds (even though more young women than men have completed
a tertiary education) and those 55 and older. Women are being overrepresented in certain sectors
(such as education, health, and social work) and occupations (e.g., service and clerical work) and
underrepresented in others (e.g., information and communication). This appears to be largely due
to traditional gender roles in the family, as well as to the relative lack of caregiving services for
both children and older relatives. The gender pay gap (10 percent at median earnings) and the
women's representation in managerial and board positions (respectively 40 percent and
7 percent) highlight the persistence of implicit discriminations.

Central Asia; Central Statistical Office, 2012, Women and Men in the Labor Market, Warsaw; Central Statistical Office, 2012,

C. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

11. 
In a deteriorated external environment, Poland is facing strong headwinds. Between
2008 and 2011, Poland's performance was strong by regional standards. It was the only EU
member to avoid recession in 2009 thanks to a combination of sound fundamentals and proactive
counter-cyclical policies (see Box 1), and it recorded sound economic growth in 2010 and 2011,
thanks to strong domestic consumption and a rebound in investment (largely driven by the
absorption of EU funds). Poland's cumulative growth over the period, at about 16 percent, was
the highest in the EU. Yet, the economy is now slowing down and Poland has lost its place as
a leader of economic growth in the EU. GDP growth slowed to 1.9 percent in 2012 and further
in early 2013 as renewed turmoil in the Euro zone weakened business' and
decelerated 
consumers' confidence, leading to a drop in investment and stagnation in private consumption.
The deceleration is further amplified by the negative impact of the ongoing fiscal consolidation
effort, by the closing of the investment cycle under the 2007-13 EU financial perspective, and by
negative growth of real wages.

Box 1: Poland and the 2008-2009 crisis

The global economic and financial crisis generated a demand shock for Poland (demand for Polish
exports was hurt by the recession in high-income countries while domestic demand was lowered by
a reduction in capital inflows). Yet, the country was the only EU member state to avoid a recession.

Poland's performance is commonly attributed to a series of factors:

(i) 

(ii) 

The structure of the economy - diversified, well integrated in supply chains, closely linked to
the German economy (making it possible for Poland's manufacturing to benefit from the
German stimulus), and serving a relatively large domestic demand.
Strong macroeconomic fundamentals at 
the inception of the crisis, 
including 
limited
macroeconomic imbalances and a healthy, tightly supervised financial sector (with a far less
dramatic credit expansion in the pre-crisis years than in other Central European economies).
(iii) A depreciation of the Polish zloty during the crisis, which boosted competitiveness on export
markets;
(iv) A proactive, counter-cyclical fiscal policy to mitigate the decline of demand (including through
the use of large EU transfers).
As the economy is now again facing a difficult environment, observers note that the room for using
fiscal and monetary instruments in a counter-cyclical manner is more limited than in 2008 (due to the
increase in public debt).

12. 
The labor market is deteriorating. The unemployment rate rose from about 7.5 percent
before the crisis, to around 9.5 percent during 2009-11, to 10.4 percent in end-2012 (in spite of
a relatively low labor force participation). Unemployment continued to rise to 10.8 percent in
April 2013 due to 
large lay-offs 
in the crisis-affected construction and labor-intensive
manufacturing sectors, and to the decision by many employers to shed jobs rather than reduce
working hours in a context of continued uncertainty. This trend is expected to result in
a slowdown of the pace of poverty reduction and will further jeopardize the progress made in the
first part of the 2000s for the lower earning 40 percent of the population.

13. Yet, Poland has managed to reduce external imbalances. The current account deficit
has gradually narrowed from 6.6 percent in 2008 to 3.5 percent in 2012. The improvement
reflected the combination of two diverging trends: an improvement in the trade balance (as
exports growth outpaced imports) vs. a widening income account (due to increased transfers to
foreign debt holders). Nearly 90 percent of the current account deficit was financed by EU
capital transfers (around 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012) and net Foreign Direct Investments, FDI
(around 0.9 percent of GDP). External debt, which was around 55 percent of GDP in the pre-
crisis period increased to 70 percent of GDP by end-2012, reflecting the increase in government
indebtedness. The share of short-term debt in total external debt dropped from around 25 percent
in 2007-2010 to 19.2 percent in December 2012. The level of international reserves remained
broadly adequate, covering 5.6 months of imports as of February 2013).

14. 
Poland has also maintained effective counter-cyclical monetary and exchange rate
policies. In 2008-2009, monetary policy helped mitigate the impact of the crisis: cuts in liquidity
rates and liquidity provisions resulted in a depreciation of the currency which boosted exports.
During the rebound from 2010 to mid-2012, inflation expectations were anchored with a 1.25
percentage point increase in policy rates, and inflation was reduced from a peak of 5 percent in

6

May 2011 to 3.4 percent in October 2012. Towards the end of 2012, monetary policy became
accommodative again: between November 2012 and June 2013, the policy rate was cut by 200
basis points to 2.75 percent. Overall, the authorities demonstrated their commitment to using all
available tools to mitigate the risks of contagion from the global (and later Euro zone) crisis.

15. 
In spite of some vulnerabilities, the financial sector proved resilient to both the global
crisis and the deleveraging of Western European banks. Thanks to a strong initial position
and to tight financial sector supervision, the impact of the crisis remained moderate (and no
financial institution required public support). The capital adequacy ratio continues to be strong
(at 14.7 percent in December 2012) and banks enjoy high liquidity and profitability. However,
asset quality, in particular the share of nonperforming loans (especially for consumer credit and
corporate loans) has deteriorated since the pre-crisis period: if left unchecked, this could pose
a risk to some institutions in the medium-term. As of yet, the deleveraging of the Euro zone
banks, which have a predominant share in the Polish banking system, occurred in an orderly
manner: the fall in foreign funding was offset by rising domestic deposits. While there seems to
be enough supply of credit, the private sector credit growth slowed to less than 1 percent at the
end of 2012 (from above 13 percent a year ago) on account of deteriorating business and
consumer confidence.

16. 
Since 2011, the government has engaged in a fiscal consolidation effort. Counter-
cyclical fiscal policies in 2008-2010 (both reduced revenues and sustained public spending)
resulted in a worsening of the fiscal balance: the general government deficit increased from 3.7
percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010 and public debt rose from 47.1 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 54.8 percent of GDP in 2010. In 2011 the public debt-to-GDP ratio continued to
increase and reached around 56.2 percent of GDP, mainly due to Polish Zloty (PLN)
depreciation in the second half of 2011. With the growth rebound in 2011, the government
initiated a process of fiscal consolidation aimed at rebuilding 
fiscal buffers 
through
a combination of revenue and expenditure measures. The general government deficit declined to
around 3.9 percent in 2012 (from 5.0 percent in 2011) and public debt-to-GDP ratio declined to
55.6 percent of GDP (the structural deficit dropped from 5.4 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent of
GDP in 2012).

D. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

17. 
Prospects for economic growth reflect developments in the Euro zone, as the Polish
economy is closely linked to the EU through trade and financial flows. In a difficult external
environment, Poland's GDP growth is expected to decline to about 1.3 percent in 2013: domestic
private consumption will remain subdued due 
to negative 
labor market developments;
investment growth is likely to slow down due to weak business confidence and continued fiscal
consolidation; yet, net exports are expected to make a positive contribution with export growth
outpacing import growth thanks to a relatively favorable exchange rate. Prospects beyond 2013
will largely depend on developments in the Euro zone: assuming that the external environment
strengthens and investment increases (in the context of the new EU financial perspective) growth
could reach 2.4 percent in 2014.

18. 
In a deteriorated external environment, the government is expected to focus on
adopting short- and medium-term growth-supporting measures, while maintaining a fiscally

7

prudent stance to bolster market confidence. This includes a short-term stimulus program
through a guarantee scheme for banks issuing loans to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and
through the recently-announced "Polish Investment Program" (which is to be financed from the
transfer of shares from state-owned companies) 5 . It also includes measures expected to bolster
the resilience of the financial sector by establishing a Systemic Risk Board, implementing
a macro-prudential framework, and revamping the bank resolution system. In addition, the
government is aiming to further enhance the business environment and to soften the impact of
the slowdown on employment by increasing the flexibility of the Labor Code and improving the
operation of Labor Offices.

19. 
Substantial transfers of EU cohesion policy funds are expected to help mitigate the
impact of the Euro zone crisis: Poland will remain the main beneficiary of EU structural and
cohesion funds in the next EU financial perspective (2014-2020), with around EUR72.9 billion
(in grants), compared to EUR68.7 billion in the current period (2007-2013) -
i.e. almost
3 percent of GDP per year. Poland has a strong track record in absorbing such resources at both
central and subnational levels, with a sizable number of large projects still under implementation
and expected to be completed by 2015. Poland will also benefit substantially from the EU's
Common Agricultural Policy with expected fund allocations of EUR28.5 billion until 2020.

20. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative. The inflation rate is forecasted
to stay within the National Bank of Poland (NBP) tolerance band (1.5 to 3.5 percent) through the
forecasting period. A continued lack of domestic demand pressures and moderating commodity
prices are likely to keep the inflation rate in check and could provide space for further monetary
easing.

21. Adopting the euro is among priorities of the Polish government. The Government aims
to achieve this goal as soon as the necessary conditions of a secure euro area membership are
met. An important milestone was the preparation of National Euro Changeover Plan in 2011.
However, due to the large number of institutional changes being implemented in the EU and the
euro area this Plan needs to be revised - a process that is expected to be completed by the end of
2013. While looking at prospective membership, Poland is considering the situation in the Euro
zone (including institutional and regulatory developments) as well as its own so-called "real
convergence criteria" - a set of economic reforms which would prepare the economy to function
successfully in the Euro zone, including steps to increase Poland's competitiveness and measures
to deal with its aging population. Several nominal convergence criteria are also yet to be fulfilled
(see Box 2).

22. External debt sustainability is robust. The current account deficit is projected to stay
close to 3.5 percent of GDP over the medium term. It will continue to be financed mostly by EU
transfers and FDI inflows. External debt is forecast to remain close to 70 percent of GDP over
the medium-term, with a maturity structure that is not expected to change significantly from
2012. Roll-over rates are expected to stay around the average of the last four years, i.e. around
110 percent. The sustainability of the external debt position is generally robust according to

5 The Polish Investment Program-announced by the Prime Minister in October 2012-is aimed at providing financial resources
for investment into energy, infrastructure, and R&D in Poland. Part of the privatization proceeds will be used to boost the capital
base of the state development bank (BGK) and a special investment vehicle (Polskie Inwestycje Rozwojowe) to leverage private
sector resources for investment.

a range of standard stress scenarios, including an increase in nominal interest rates, lower GDP
growth, and higher current account deficit (see Figure 4).

23. 
The Government has indicated its continued commitment to fiscal consolidation but
the pace of adjustment is expected to slow down to reflect the deteriorating external
environment. The fiscal deficit is projected to be around 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and to
further decline to around 3 percent of GDP in 2014. In subsequent years, the Government is
expected to pursue further fiscal consolidation to gradually reduce its structural fiscal deficit to
1 percent of GDP in line with its medium-term objective.

Box 2: Poland and the Euro

Under the EU Treaty, all EU Member States, except those with opt-out clauses, have to join the Euro
zone once the necessary conditions are fulfilled. Poland does not yet meet all the legal preconditions
and relevant convergence criteria. The slower than expected nominal convergence is to a large extent a
consequence of external conditions - the global financial crisis and the Euro area sovere gn debt crisis.

24. 
In a context of weaker growth, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase
in the short-term. According to the European System of national and regional accounts,
ESA'95 methodology, public debt is projected to be close to 56 percent of GDP in 2013 and
2014 before it declines towards 55 percent in 2016. This would still be consistent with the

9

Maastricht ceiling of 60 percent of GDP (as calculated according to ESA'95 methodology) and
the key national debt 
limit of 55 percent of GDP (calculated according 
to national
methodology). Yet, stress tests suggest that the debt path is highly sensitive to a growth shock,
which under certain scenarios could bring the level of public debt above the EU threshold of 60
percent of GDP (see figure 5).

6 The Public Finance Act prompts corrective action when the public debt reaches 55 percent of GDP, in addition to the

constitutional ceiling for public debt at 60 percent of GDP. Starting in 2013, the Government is planning to change the rules for

calculating public debt to GDP ratio (national methodology) with respect to the applicability of sanctions. In case public debt to

GDP ratio exceeds any of the precautionary thresholds, the ratio will be re-calculated using the average (instead of end-of period)

exchange rate for the calculation of public debt stock. Corrective actions will be triggered only if the re-calculated ratio is not
with compliance with public debt safety thresholds.

7 In this scenario real GDP growth rate is at baseline minus 2 percentage points in each year of the projection period.

Public debt in Poland is largely domestic. Under the described GDP growth shock scenario, public debt is more sensitive to

changes in GDP than external debt. Under this scenario, the current account deficit narrows leading to a lower external debt in

year (t+1), while the general government primary deficit increases (as automatic stabilizers increase expenditures, while revenue

collection suffers), thus leading to a higher public debt

" Data for 2012 are estimates, based on actual data available by mid-Feb 2013. The main difference between the

national and ESA'95 definitions of public debt is that the national definition excludes debts of the National Road Fund (which are

included in the ESA'95 definition).

25. Overall, the outlook remains challenging for the bottom 40 percent of the population.
The unemployment rate is expected to further increase until 2014 and, even under relatively
optimistic scenarios, may start to decline only in 2015 if growth accelerates. This is expected to
affect both income opportunities and wage levels in a manner that may further erode the gains of
the early 2000s. The necessary process of fiscal consolidation and the increased targeting of
social benefits will further reduce government outlays (direct and indirect) to the lower middle
class.

E. MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

26. 
Beyond the short-term, Poland is facing a number of challenges, which may
negatively affect potential income growth for the bottom 40 percent of society. These
include a possible gradual reduction of the country's long-term growth potential (due to the
aging of society and to the need to renew the growth model), difficulties in ensuring adequate
economic inclusion of parts of the population (due to the incomplete institutional transformation
and persistent regional imbalances), and threats to the environmental sustainability of Poland's
development.

27. 
Poland is a rapidly aging society. Poland's demographics are daunting. Overall
population numbers have already declined (from 38.6 million in 1995 to 38.2 million in 2010)
due to birth rates which are far below replacement rates (at about 1.38 children per woman) and
emigration. The median age is set to increase from 38.1 in 2010 to 38.5 in 2020 and to 40.0 in
2035, one of the highest median ages in Europe. While recent reforms (including a significant
increase in the retirement age) have strengthened the sustainability of the pensions system, there
remain significant aging-related challenges in terms of labor force participation (among the
lowest in the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) for the
workers aged 55 to 64), productivity of an older workforce, health care (including long-term care
and its financing), and old age poverty or exclusion.

28. 
Poland's current growth model may be gradually approaching its limit. Over the last
two decades, Poland's growth has been driven by a "post-transition" catching up, in terms of
productivity growth and capital accumulation. Yet, as income per capita (and labor costs)
increases, Poland will need to further move up the value chain and achieve productivity gains
through innovation. Poland remains one of the least innovative economies in the OECD and still
needs to make efforts to best equip its workers to the need of a modern economy. Addressing this
will require a combination of steps to foster more effective "ecosystems" for innovation (and in
particular links between research, entrepreneurs, and financiers), to strengthen public support to
innovation, to enhance the quality and relevance of general, vocational, and higher education,
and to further develop skills and entrepreneurship.

29. 
Poland's institutional transformation remains unfinished. Since the early 1990s,
Poland has made significant progress in developing solid and sophisticated institutions. The
challenge in the next period is to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the public
sector, at both national and decentralized levels. This will include efforts to attract and retain
high-skilled staff for senior positions, to enhance cooperation across entities, to modernize the

12

functioning of several key segments of the public sector, and to effectively use budget
instruments to foster reform.

30. 
Poland faces challenges related to territorial disparities. The process of national
convergence within the EU has been accompanied by increased internal divergence among and
within regions. Several of Poland's 16 regions have made significant progress in terms of growth
and living conditions, but five of them (those located in the Eastern part of the country) have
experienced a relative loss. These regions remain among the 20 poorest regions of the EU-27. In
addition, disparities within each region have been on the rise (typically with large cities faring
relatively well, while rural areas and small towns are falling behind) and now rank among the
highest in the OECD. Poverty and the risks of economic marginalization have a significant
territorial component, due to accessibility constraints, mixed quality of public services, as well as
initial resources endowments. The challenge is to help people living in the poorest parts of the
country escape a vicious cycle of impoverishment and low investment and private sector activity.

31. 
Poland's economy is among the least emissions-efficient in the EU, mainly due to the
country's dependence on coal (especially in the power sector), to very high rates of emission
growth in the transport sector, and to an energy efficiency performance that remains below EU
averages. The EU has set a goal for Poland to limit the growth of greenhouse gases (GHG)
emissions to 14 percent between 2005 and 2020 (i.e. significantly below the expected cumulative
rate of economic growth over this period).12 This implies a change in production structures and
energy consumption patterns. A recent World Bank study showed that the transition is expected
to generate economic costs in output and employment until 2020 that are higher than for the
average EU country, but that the shift towards low emissions through better fuel efficiency,
energy efficiency and other measures would eventually boost Poland's economic growth in the
medium-term.

12 This goal was set as part of the broader effort to reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent EU-wide (with different targets for each
EU member).

13

III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

A. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

32. 
Poland's development strategy is framed within the broader context of the EU's
"Europe 2020" strategy, which is designed around the concept of "sustainable, smart and
inclusive growth". Europe 2020 proposes a set of specific targets for each EU member country,
including Poland (see Box 3). It is supported by seven flagship initiatives and ten Integrated
Guidelines for economic and employment policies of Member States (highlighted as relevant in
the results matrix in Annex 1).

33. 
The government has defined 
its 
long-term strategic vision 
in "Poland 2030
Development Challenges", a 2009 report by the Board of Strategic Advisers to the Prime
Minister. The report aims to identify the key challenges that Poland will have to face in the
coming two decades, with a two-fold focus on managing the risks stemming from long-term
global trends and on transforming the existing welfare state model to create better conditions for
dynamic growth and social inclusion. It emphasizes the need to increase capital and labor supply
in the economy (through changes in the fiscal, institutional, and organizational incentive
structure), to enhance productivity (through investments in infrastructure, education and science,
economic regulations, and institutional reforms, specifically in the labor market), and to develop
social capital and social cohesion.

13 The EC cannot present an assessment (methodology to express 2020 energy consumption impact was only recently agreed).
14 The "people at risk of poverty or exclusion' target describes persons affected by at least one of the conditions measured by
three indicators surveyed by EUROSTAT: the at risk-of-poverty rate, the severe material deprivation rate and the share of people
living in households with very low work intensity.

14

34. 
To operationalize its long-term vision the government in September 2012 adopted
a "National Development Strategy 2020". This document spells out national objectives for the
medium-term, to be implemented through individual sectoral and thematic strategies under the
responsibility of different ministries (see Box 4). The National Development Strategy is closely
aligned with the strategic agenda of "Europe 2020" and aims to bring GDP per capita to a target
of 74 to 79 percent of the EU average by the year 2020. It is articulated around several priority
areas: an effective and efficient state (governance, public sector performance, public financial
management, services delivery, etc.); a competitive economy (macroeconomic 
stability,
entrepreneurship, innovation, labor market, infrastructure, energy efficiency, skills, etc.); and
social and territorial cohesion (regional development, inclusion, social exclusion, basic public
services, etc.).

35. 

Poland is also aspiring to play an increasingly stronger role in European institutions
and in the international scene, in line with its demographic weight, economic performance, and
political capacity. The Government 
is aware of the potential importance of development
cooperation in Poland's foreign policy, in particular to advance the country's values, especially
democratization and good governance; to help raise Poland's profile and influence in selected
areas; and to contribute to the stability and development of its neighbors and partners. Poland is
also playing an increasingly strong role in a broad range of international forums (and it will host
the Conference of the Parties, COP, on climate change in Warsaw in November 2013). From an
economic angle, the authorities are keen on supporting the internationalization of Polish firms,

15

and on developing links with the Polish diaspora and with Poles living abroad to help promote
Poland's interests in the world.

36. EU cohesion policy funds are expected to provide the overwhelming share of
financing to support Poland's development priorities. Europe 2020 provides the strategic
framework for the use of EU resources to be made available under the 2014-2020 financial
perspective. The EC has identified four priorities 
in this respect: 
(i) modern network
infrastructure 
for growth and jobs; 
(ii) an 
innovation 
friendly business environment;
(iii) increased labor market participation through improved employment, social inclusion and
education policies and (iv) an environment-friendly and resource-efficient economy. These four
funding priorities are linked to the eleven thematic objectives under the new Structural Funds
regulation (see Box 5 below). Poland is in the process of preparing the corresponding thematic
strategies and Operational Programs to identify the corresponding investments and instruments.

B. LESSONS LEARNED FROM FYO9-13

37. The 2009-2013 CPS was devised to help mitigate the negative effects of the global
economic and financial crises on Poland. Planned support included a series of Development
Policy Loans (DPLs), selected Investment Loans (ILs), and niche knowledge services (including
for subnational governments). Overall, the program of activities was delivered, with the notable
exception of ILs (in the global crisis context, the Government decided to focus on DPLs only).

16

38. 
The Completion Report (see Annex 3) assesses progress made towards the
achievement of the CPS program outcomes and the WBG performance during the
implementation period - both rated Moderately Satisfactory.

* Successful features of the WBG engagement include: (i) the development of a solid,
trust-based relationship with a broad range of Polish counterparts; (ii) the flexibility and
responsiveness demonstrated in the face of changing circumstances; (iii) the delivery of
a solid package of fast-disbursing lending and knowledge support (successive DPL series
were instrumental in advancing policy dialogue, high quality knowledge services provided
timely inputs for decision makers); (iv) the overall quality of the lending portfolio
(Implementation Completion Reports 
(ICR), and 
the corresponding 
Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluations, rated performance of DPL series as satisfactory; two
ILs were closed as moderately satisfactory and one as moderately unsatisfactory).

* Challenges and disappointments include: 
(i) 
implementation 
issues with selected
operations including long delays in starting implementation of the Odra River Basin Flood
Protection Project (ii) difficulties in developing effective instruments and approaches to
provide a substantial amount of advisory services to subnational governments (transaction
costs proved high, while the capacity to absorb such services remains limited); (iii) slow
uptake of Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) to finance knowledge services over and
above what the WBG can finance from its own resources; and (iv) an initial reluctance to
engage on global development issues (beyond the Poland program).

39. 
The Completion Report draws lessons and recommendations which were taken on
board in preparing the new CPS for the period FY14-17.

* There is a continued demand for WBG knowledge services. Poland is valuing and
requesting WBG knowledge services in a number of areas. Under the new CPS the
challenge for the WBG is to identify those areas where it can best contribute to policy-
making and add value to the services otherwise available from private consultants or from
other partners, especially the EC. Experience suggests that the WBG's comparative
advantage varies across sectors but typically 
includes: 
(i) 
the ability 
to provide
independent expert advice, with a combination of knowledge and operational experience;
(ii) the combination of global experience and local knowledge and the ability to tailor
global solutions to local circumstances; (iii) a strong commitment to results, i.e. an
engagement that is not limited to a contractual relationship; and (iv) a focus on poverty
reduction and shared prosperity, which provides the set of "values" that underpin the
partnership.

* The WBG ought to align its program to the EU strategy. Throughout the CPS period,
Poland received large amounts of EU grants and European Investment Bank (EIB) loans.
WBG financing was typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller. This implies that
the WBG needs not only to coordinate with other actors and to identify "niches" and focus
areas, but to fully align its program to the EU strategy. The new CPS FY14-17 therefore is
closely aligned to funding priorities of the EC and fully coherent with the Europe 2020
strategy.

* In most technical areas, the Bank needs to manage a dialogue rather than
deliverables. Throughout the CPS period, influence came from the day-to-day dialogue

17

with counterparts. The traditional focus on deliverables (specific, pre-agreed outputs)
showed some limitations. The WBG was most successful (e.g., in the case of reforms
aimed at enhancing the business environment) when it focused on establishing and
managing a dialogue, providing formal or informal contributions on an ad hoc basis (and
in a very rapid manner) with a focus on supporting the decision-making process in real
time and with solid accountability for results. During the new CPS period, the WBG will
further shift from a "task-focused" to a "dialogue-focused" engagement, which has an
impact on both decentralization and quality control processes.

* Selectivity, 
flexibility, quality, and timeliness are keys to success. These are well
known factors of success in any development context, but they apply somewhat differently
in a country like Poland. In particular, the WBG has to continuously adjust to an evolving
demand if it is to remain relevant. In this context, the new CPS aims to provide an overall
strategic framework and a set of specific selectivity criteria to help prioritizing areas for
engagement as new demands for support emerge. The Bank will also make a particular
effort to reflect lessons learned from the delays of the Odra program for its future
investment loans, such as the need to strengthen capacity of implementing entities, to
ensure solid cross-agency cooperation, and to ensure adequate project readiness.

* Continued important role for lending 
in the delivery of knowledge services.
Throughout the CPS implementation period, the WBG effectively used stand-alone
knowledge services to make a contribution to policy-making in a number of areas. Yet,
lending, and especially the successive DPL series, also played a major role in advancing
the policy dialogue, especially in some of the most difficult areas. Overall, it is the
combination of (well-articulated) lending and analytical and advisory activities that can
provide for the most effective way to engage. The CPS FY14-17 therefore includes
a continued financial engagement in tandem with knowledge services.

* Knowledge-focused results matrix. The results from stand-alone knowledge activities
will often be intermediate outcomes in a longer results chain. This presents a conceptual
challenge for developing a results matrix. A knowledge activity in Poland may help
develop the capacity for improved service delivery in an area, but the WBG may not be
involved in the delivery of the service itself and as such it will have only an indirect effect
on the final beneficiary. The new CPS results matrix focuses indicators of progress on
results to which the WBG will make a significant contribution.

40. 
Public goods aspect of knowledge activities. The relationship with Poland, a demanding
and sophisticated client, is such that a number of knowledge products have been the subject of an
intense back-and-forth process of comments and adjustments between the Government and the
WBG. This has made it possible to develop high-quality products that went even beyond what
was initially contemplated. In turn, several of these products have provided a solid foundation for
engagement in other countries, where the findings and recommendations developed for Poland
provided a reference point or a benchmark for similar work (see Box 6). In parallel, some of the
lessons learned by Poland through its successful transition experience can usefully inform the
policymaking debate in other countries. In this context, the WBG can substantially benefit from
its knowledge partnership with Poland.

18

Box 6: Illustrative examples of "public goods knowledge products" developed in Poland

Business environment. The Polish experience in improving its business environment (especially with
regard to insolvency) is informing the policy dialogue in this area in Ukraine.

Regional Development Strategy. The methodology developed by the Bank to assess the Regional
Development Strategy for the Lubelskie region (combining a "place-based" and "people-based"
approach) was used to support other authorities, including the Kakheti region in Georgia.

Climate change modeling. The analytical work developed in Poland provided the basis for similar
analysis on "transition to low emissions economy" in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and for an ECA-wide peer-learning event held in Warsaw in May 2013.

Local Bond Market Development. Poland's experience will be central to raising awareness of the
increasing reliance of fast growing emerging market countries on local bond markets to finance
business investment and infrastructure. The WBG and the National Bank of Poland are planning to co-
host the Annual Gemloc Investor-Country Conference and Advisory Services Workshop in FY14.

The WBG is also facilitating multiple exchanges of experience including in areas such as environment
management (e.g., with Kazakhstan), procurement (e.g., with Vietnam), etc.

C. PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP CPS FOR POLAND

A TRANSFORMING PARTNERSHIP

41. 
The government has indicated its preference not to graduate from International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) at this stage. Poland is one of 28 IBRD
borrowers which have crossed the current threshold (US$7,035) triggering the IBRD to work
together with the authorities to review the country's overall economic, social, and financial
situation and to determine its capacity to sustain a long term development program without
further support from the Bank.15 The authorities have expressed their interest in continuing to
benefit from WBG financing and knowledge services, which they see as important ingredients to
inform policy making and more generally to support the reform process in selected strategic
areas.

42. WBG management concurs with the government's position that IBRD support
continues to generate development value-added for the country, in particular in light of the
slowdown in poverty reduction and convergence within Poland across different regions, the
unfinished structural reform agenda and of the external risks posed by the continued Euro zone
crisis for the shared prosperity agenda. In addition to Poland's own demand for WBG financing
and knowledge services, WBG management considered three factors in assessing the country's
graduation scenario, i.e.:

15 The Board in 2002 confirmed that the Bank's graduation policy does not require automatic graduation of a client if the country

becomes a member in an economic or other union with richer countries such as in Poland's case with the EU. See reference in

SecM2004-0283, Framework for World Bank support to the European Union (EU) new member countries of central and eastern

Europe, p. 7f.

19

* Poland's progress 
in establishing key 
institutions for economic and social
development. Although major progress has been achieved over the last two decades,
significant efforts are still needed to enhance the functioning and capacity of important
public sector entities and to modernize the regulatory apparatus (and its application), so as
to meet the country's goals of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth (and to make the
best of EU cohesion funds available under the new financial perspective) and to foster
income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population.

* Poland's ability to access financial markets on reasonable terms. Poland has access to
capital markets on sound terms, yet the current uncertainties stemming from the Euro zone
crisis are associated with risks of financial market volatility. 16 WBG management also
noted that, in spite of such access to financial resources, Poland continues to value the
WBG's financial support for the "signaling effect" it may have on markets, and for the
support it provides to the implementation of difficult reforms.

* Poland's efforts to foster income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population
and to ensure the environmental sustainability of its development. This remains
a largely unfinished agenda, and an area where the WBG can provide significant added
value through advocacy and awareness raising, technical and policy advice, as well as
support to the design and implementation of selected reforms. The Government has also
expressed its interest in further benefiting from the WBG support to that effect.

43. WBG management also notes that a continued engagement in Poland has significant
positive spillover effects for other countries and global programs. Continued engagement in
Poland has the potential to create a number of further "public good" knowledge products, which
can inform the policy dialogue with other client countries. It can also help foster a solid
partnership with Poland to start working together on international development efforts and global
public goods. WBG management hence assesses that the relationship can be a two-way, win-win
partnership.

44. 
In this context, the WBG will continue to provide a broad range of services to
Poland, including financing, analytical, and advisory services. Yet, in a context of limited
availability of lending and Bank budget resources, 
the WBG will focus its involvement
selectively, based on the following set of criteria:

* IBRD lending resources will be limited to operations (either DPLs or ILs) which
complement other donors' activities and support policy or institutional reforms by:
(i) supporting reforms in the implementation phase (as a follow up to advisory services for
the design phase), especially for politically or technically difficult endeavors; (ii) serving
a demonstrable signaling function for outside stakeholders; and/or (iii) creating a lasting
impact on institutional capacity in the country. It is expected that the overall access to
lending resources during the CPS period should be substantially lower than under the 2009
CPS, and decline gradually as 
the relationship further matures and the external
environment improves.

16

In view of this uncertainty and of the corresponding heightened risks to the balance of payments, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) provided renewed access to a two-year precautionary Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement in the amount of SDR
22 billion in January 2013.

20

* IBRD budget resources for stand-alone knowledge activities will be allocated in priority
to those activities which have a high likelihood of creating positive spillover effects
through the creation of new knowledge which the Bank could use in its dialogue with
other countries. Financing for other services will increasingly have to be arranged by way
of Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS), except possibly in areas which IBRD sees as
critical for the implementation of the bottom 40 percent agenda and where RAS may not
be a feasible option. 17

* IFC is considering a selective re-engagement in Poland following several years of
limited activity due to a perceived lack of role. With the economy now on a slower
growth trajectory, declining investment and ongoing fiscal consolidation, IFC has a role to
play in supporting short- and medium-term pro-growth measures. Subject to market
demand and conditions, IFC investments will be focused on those areas where IFC can
(i) have a significant demonstration or catalytic effect, for example in markets where risk
perceptions are high and private sector capital remains limited; (ii) facilitate additional
resource mobilization; (iii) co-finance EU-funded projects in the private sector or at the
sub-national level and/or (iv) support the growth of Polish companies outside of their
domestic market.

45. WBG management will reconsider the issue of graduation in the CPS Progress
Report, to ensure the WBG engagement remains relevant and meaningful. In particular,
WBG management will base this analysis on the Government's demand for WBG services; the
WBG's ability to achieve results for the bottom 40 percent of the population during the first two
years of CPS implementation; and the overall economic environment Poland will face at that
time.

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

46. 
The proposed CPS program reflects a series of conversations with a multiplicity of
stakeholders. Key strategic choices were discussed in depth with and endorsed by the
Government and the National Bank of Poland (which holds the WBG Governor role). The WBG
also held conversations with the private sector and selected civil society figures to seek insights
on the challenges faced by Poland and the ways the WBG could support 
the country.
Consultations were held with the EC (in Brussels), the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), and the EIB about the planned areas of engagements to confirm the
WBG's proposed program is complementary to the activities of these institutions.

47. The WBG's overall objective during the CPS period is two-fold: 
(i) 
to foster
sustainable income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population within the context of
Poland's economic convergence process within the EU, and of the "smart, sustainable, and
inclusive growth" agenda, and (ii) to promote and support Poland's role as a global development
partner and to learn from the Poland program to the benefit of other client countries.

48. 
The WBG program is articulated around four strategic areas of engagement, which
are aligned with the overall WBG strategy to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity, the
ECA Regional Strategy and the "smart, sustainable, and inclusive" agenda. Within each area, the

17 World Bank management will ascertain in such circumstances that RAS do not lead to any form of market distortion

21

CPS focuses on those objectives for which there is both a clear demand and a track record of
successful dialogue, and aims to deepen or expand existing engagements. The four areas consist
of: (i) economic competitiveness, with a focus on business environment, innovation, and public
finance effectiveness; (ii) equity and inclusion, with a focus on inclusive labor market, balanced
regional development and strengthened health care and health prevention in an aging society;
(iii) climate action, with a focus on informed climate change policy making, adaptation and flood
protection, and resource efficient infrastructure; and (iv) Poland as a global development partner
with a focus on enhancing Poland's contribution to development cooperation and global public
goods.

49. 
The alignment between the proposed strategic areas of engagement and the WBG's
overarching goals is discussed in Annex 2. Activities under the economic competitiveness
pillar aim to help sustain overall economic growth, which is key to the bottom 40 percent
prospects - to mitigate the impact of the difficult external environment in the short-term and to
avoid a sharp decrease of Poland's long-term growth potential. Activities under the equity and
inclusion pillar target three groups within the bottom 40 percent of the population which are
among those facing the most difficult odds - the unemployed, those living in lagging regions,
and the older / less healthy people. Activities under the "climate action" pillar are directly
focused on strengthening the environmental sustainability of Poland's development. Finally,
activities under the "Poland as a global development partner" pillar are geared towards
facilitating Poland's contribution to other countries' development agenda.

50. 
The WBG is expecting to implement the CPS with a degree of flexibility, so as to be
able to adjust the program to an evolving demand. The WBG will prioritize new demands for its
services on the basis of a set of criteria which include: (i) strategic focus (supports the CPS
overall strategic objectives through engagement in an area which is consistent with the WBG's
overarching goals and where the WBG has a comparative advantage); (ii) demand (reflects
a clear demand by a counterpart committed to implementing reforms); (iii) operational capacity
to deliver and Bank Group approach (coordinated response between IBRD, IFC and MIGA); and
(iv) mainstreaming of gender considerations (operations in relevant areas, especially, but not
limited to, those related to strengthening labor force participation will be designed in a gender-
responsive way and include at least one sex-disaggregated indicator to monitor progress). WBG
interventions are not necessarily expected to deliver development results exclusively in their
target pillar but some also have potential positive impacts in other engagement areas (e.g. labor
market reforms for equity and inclusion can at the same time also improve sustainable public
finances under economic competitiveness) due to the multidimensional, cross-cutting nature of
most operations.

51. 
The proposed strategy is in full coherence with the EC's strategic approach and
programs in Poland (see Box 7). The EC peer reviewed the CPS and confirmed that the
proposed engagement is closely aligned with both the EU strategy 2020 and the corresponding
funding priorities under the new programming period. The EC sees the WBG as uniquely placed
to support policy reforms which can make the large EU-funded investments more effective. In
particular, 
the WBG strategy will cover 
investment areas where 
the EC encountered
implementation difficulties in the previous programming period (e.g., rail, flood protection) as
well as investment areas which will grow in importance in the upcoming programming period

22

(e.g. innovation/R&D). The WBG is committed to monitoring the continued complementarity of
the programs through a regular and active dialogue with the EC.

Box 7: CPS relationship to national and EU objectives

The WBG aims to support Poland in the implementation of its development agenda as
articulated in the National Development Strategy 2020 which translates the broad headline
targets under the Europe 2020 strategy into national targets. The relationship between the
different 
strategic 
levels 
is 
illustrated below with CPS Outcome 2, 
"Increased
Innovativeness". Similar relationships for each CPS Outcome are indicated in Annex 1.

52. Results Framework. Annex 
provides a results framework which aims to help monitor
and evaluate progress in the implementation of the CPS (including on gender equality in the
labor force). The definition of specific outcome indicators focuses on those results that could be
unambiguously attributed to the Bank -
in the context of a knowledge-focused program where
the WBG's engagement in a number of areas consists only of analytical and advisory services
(and hence where results can often be no more than intermediate outcomes in a longer results
chain).

PLANNED ACTIVITIES IN CPS AREAS OF ENGAGEMENT

Strategic Engagement Area 1: Economic Competitiveness

53. This first Strategic Engagement Area is focused on sustaining overall economic
growth, which is key to foster income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population.
The challenge is two-fold. In the short-term, Poland ought to further mitigate the impact of
a difficult external environent and a slowdown in economic activity. Beyond this horizon,
Poland needs to avoid that its long-term growth potential declines too sharply as a result of both
the aging of society and the diminishing returns of its current "catching up" growth model.
Action is required on a multiplicity of fronts. Based on the government's demand, and on the

23

track record to date, the WBG will focus on three areas: enhanced business environment,
increase innovativeness, and effective public finance.

54. Country Development Goal 1: Enhanced businesses environment. Much remains to be
done to enhance the business environment in Poland, as illustrated by the country's ranking
under Doing Business 2013 (55, below the EU average), with particular weaknesses in starting
a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, enforcing contracts, paying
taxes and resolving insolvency. This is a priority area for Government action in the coming
years. Over the last period, IBRD has been successfully providing technical advice (including
under a RAS arrangement) 
to strengthen the insolvency law, revamp the bank resolution
framework, and improve contract enforcement. During the CPS period, IBRD will provide
continued support, with a focus on (i) reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens for private sector
development (especially in those areas where Poland is lagging the most in the Doing Business
surveys), (ii) further strengthening the financial sector, and (iii) enhancing financial auditing,
accounting and reporting. In parallel, IFC could support the development of Poland's bond
market, for instance through participation in a bond issuance. Instruments: Policy Lending,

technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Business Regulatory Environment,
Financial Reporting).

55. Country Development Goal 2: Increased 
innovativeness. To sustain 
its economic
performance, Poland will need to increasingly rely on innovation as a key engine for growth. Yet the
country ranks among the least innovative economies in both the EU and the OECD. Large resources
are expected to be made available to support private sector-led innovation under the new EU
financial perspective. Both the national and subnational governments are developing "innovation and
smart specialization strategies" to provide a framework for using these resources effectively. Over
the last period, the WBG carried out a review of the public support to innovation system and helped
develop innovation strategies. During the CPS period, IBRD will build on these activities and
support the operationalization of this agenda, in terms of both strategic approaches and instruments.
Efforts to develop human capital for R&D, in particular with regard to higher education, will also be

supported. Instruments: economic and sector work (Innovation Ecosystems), technical assistance and
reimbursable advisory services (Innovation, Smart Specialization, Innovation Instruments, and
Higher Education).

56. Country Development Goal 3: Effective public finance. To accompany the ongoing
fiscal consolidation effort, the government is contemplating reforms aimed at strengthening
fiscal rules and institutions and improving 
the quality of expenditure and public sector
effectiveness including in social sectors. The Bank has been actively engaged in this area,
through successive DPL series, analytical work, and technical assistance, in close cooperation
with the EC and the IMF. During the CPS period, IBRD will support the design and adoption of
selected public finance reforms through demand-driven, just-in-time knowledge services to
support the evolving government agenda, as well as financial support (including to provide
a strong signal of support to other financiers and financial markets as appropriate). The initial
areas of engagement include: (i) further developing fiscal rules and institutions, (ii) strengthening
the quality of public finance, (iii) planning for the macroeconomic challenges associated with the
aging of society, and (iv) preparing for the eventual adoption of the Euro. Instruments: Policy

Lending, economic and sector work (Public Finance Review, Savings and Growth, Social
Sectors Service Delivery), technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Justice).

24

Strategic Engagement Area 2: Equity and Inclusion

57. 
This second Strategic Engagement Area is focused on ensuring that the bottom 40
percent of the population can enjoy the benefits of economic growth, including in terms of
accessing economic opportunities as well as benefiting from efficient social services. This is
a multi-tiered agenda, where specific support is needed for each of the various groups that
altogether constitute the "bottom 40 percent of the population". Based on the government's
demand, and on the track record to date, the WBG will focus on three groups which are among
those facing the most difficult odds -
the unemployed (inclusive and effective labor market),
those living in lagging regions (balanced regional development), and the older / less healthy
people (strengthened health care and health prevention in an aging society).

58. Country Development Goal 4: Inclusive and effective 
labor market. Increased
participation in the labor market is key for Poland's sustained economic growth as well as for
social inclusion and poverty reduction. The government is making efforts to improve the
functioning of the labor market, including by reviewing unemployment services and activation
policies (with support from the European Social Fund). Over the last period, IBRD's dialogue in
this area has been relatively limited to ad hoc technical support. During the CPS period, the
WBG will aim to scale up its engagement, especially to support reforms in the areas of labor
market and employability and the use of EU funds. This will include a specific focus on
identified gender related issues, including female participation in the labor market, segregation
and pay gaps. This work will be conducted in close coordination with the multi country work in
ECA on activation and skills to ensure exchange of good practice and joint learning as well as
other synergies at the regional level. Instruments: Investment Lending (Social Inclusion project),
economic and sector work (Aging), technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services
(Labor Market, Social Assistance).

59. Country Development Goal 5: Balanced regional development. Significant EU
resources are expected to be available in the next period to finance investments at the subnational
level, where local governments have a solid track record for disbursing such funds. An important
objective for Poland is to develop public-private partnerships, especially to raise the number of
hybrid projects. The challenge 
is two-fold: 
to maximize results (beyond disbursements),
especially with regard to reducing the inequality of opportunities across and within regions
which stand in the way of creating shared prosperity; and to ensure the sustainability of these
investments (in particular by strengthening local public finance to free up resources for
cofinancing, operations, and maintenance). Over the last years, the WBG worked in close
cooperation with the EC, provided a range of knowledge services, and developed solid
relationships with several key counterparts, at both national and subnational level. During the
CPS period, the WBG will build on this dialogue and provide focused knowledge services in
support of strengthening subnational strategies (and their implementation) and enhancing
subnational public finance. The WBG will also help prepare a "small area poverty map" to allow
for a better geographical focus of relevant poverty reduction measures. Instruments: economic
and sector work (Equitable Resource Reallocation for Regional Development and Service
Delivery) technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Subnational Development,
Subnational Finance).

60. Country Development Goal 6: Reformed health care for an aging society. A growing
elderly population is associated with increased health care service utilization as well as with

25

increased risks on old-age exclusion. Poland's objective in the health sector is to develop an
effective care system which can deliver quality services and cope with demographic changes in
a fiscally constrained environment. Achieving this will in particular require the strengthening of
spatial planning for health service delivery to account for the health needs of an aging population,
streamlining hospital infrastructure and developing less hospital-centric care practices. This will also
include developing measures 
to 
limit 
the growth of long-term care needs by prevention,
rehabilitation, and support of capacity of independent living. Significant reforms have been
engaged in particular to transfer the responsibility for hospitals management (and financial
losses) 
to subnational governments, which heighten the pressures for consolidation and
restructuring. Over the last years, the WBG provided analytical and financial support to reforms
in the sector, first at national level and increasingly at the subnational level (in line with the
decentralization process). During the CPS period, the WBG will build on this dialogue and
further work in close cooperation with the EC and EIB to strengthen capacity to effectively
create and manage hospital networks at the subnational level, to facilitate a sound and structured
process for hospital restructuring, and to inform further reforms in the health sector (e.g., on
private health insurance). IFC will explore opportunities to complement these activities with
selected direct and Public Private Partnership (PPP) advisory or investments in the health sector.
Instruments: Investment Lending (Hospital Reform Project), economic and sector work (Aging),
technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Health); possible IFC investments and
PPP advisory in health sector).

Strategic Engagement Area 3: Climate Action

61. 
This third Strategic Engagement Area is focused on enhancing the sustainability of
the country's economic development, in particular with regard to climate change. This is
about climate-informed policy-making, climate change adaptation, and climate change
mitigation. Once again, this is a multi-fold agenda, which calls for action across a number of
areas. Based on the government's demand, and on the track record to date, the WBG will focus
on three areas: helping to develop methodological tools to inform climate change policy
decisions; protecting against floods, as part of the mitigation effort, and developing or improving
resource-efficient infrastructure (e.g., railways, renewable energy, energy efficiency) to reduce
emissions.

62. Country Development Goal 7: Informed climate change policy. The government is
keenly interested in developing a better understanding of the implications of climate change
policy decisions on the overall economy, especially with regard to the impact on growth
prospects and relevant macroeconomic aggregates, so as to be able to analyze policy options and
trade-offs. Over the last period, the WBG carried out analytical work and provided technical
assistance, which were highly appreciated. During the CPS period, the WBG will build on this
effort and provide continued support especially with regard 
to building capacity 
for
macroeconomic modeling of climate policy decisions, and climate change strategy-making.
Instruments: economic and sector work (Economic Effects and Financing of Energy Program
Implementation), technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Economic Modeling
for Climate Policy), IDF grant on low emissions.

63. Country Development Goal 8: Enhanced protection against floods. Large parts of the
country are exposed to flood risks, especially in the basins of the two main rivers (the Odra and

26

the Vistula) due to both inadequate protection infrastructure and insufficient arrangements for
institutional coordination. The government has developed a comprehensive program to enhance
flood protection along the Upper Odra River (which was affected by a devastating flood in 1997)
and is now preparing similar plans for the Upper Vistula River. Over the last period, the Bank
has supported these efforts, by providing technical leadership and mobilizing other financiers
(EC and CEB) to implement the Odra River program. During the CPS period, the Bank will
focus on completing implementation of this program. In partnership with others, the Bank may
also support the design and implementation of a Vistula River flood protection program.
Instruments: Investment Lending (implementation of Odra River Basin Management and Flood
Protection Project; Vistula River Basin Management and Flood Protection Project).

64. Country Development Goal 9: Resource-efficient and safe infrastructure. In close
cooperation with the EC, Poland is making efforts to gradually strengthen its low carbon
infrastructure systems, 
including for transport (railways) and energy (energy efficiency,
alternatives to coal). Yet, this is proving a challenging endeavor, and the authorities have had
difficulties 
in absorbing 
the corresponding EU funds. Over the 
last period, with the
encouragement of both the government and the EC, the WBG initiated a dialogue to support
reforms of the railways sector and especially of the infrastructure company, PLK (to reduce
staffing levels, improve safety, and strengthen capacity for absorbing EU funds). The WBG also
provided targeted (and limited) advisory services in the area of energy efficiency. During the
CPS period, the WBG will build on these engagements, with a focus on supporting in particular:
(i) implementation of the PLK reform; (ii) the design of effective strategic approaches and
instruments to develop resource-efficient infrastructure (including through PPPs); (iii) efforts
aimed at developing alternative energy systems and at improving energy efficiency including
through possible IFC investments in renewable energy and other climate-friendly projects; and
(iv) enhanced road safety. Instruments: Investment Lending (Railways Restructuring Project);
technical assistance and reimbursable advisory services (Road Safety) IFC advisory or
investment in PPPs.

Strategic Engagement Area 4: "Poland as a Global Development Partner"

65. 
This last Strategic Engagement Area aims to benefit the developing world at large
and to contribute to the WBG's overall objectives at a global level. It will also benefit Poland
by strengthening its voice on the international scene.

66. Country Development Goal 10: Contribution to development cooperation and global
public goods. Poland is a new actor on the global development scene (the first law framing
development cooperation efforts was passed in late 2011). Yet, as a Central European power and
a strong voice within the EU, the country has the potential to play a significant role by
influencing international debates, sharing its successful experience of economic transition, and
gradually providing increased amounts of financing to support global development efforts. This
is expected to be an endeavor that can yield its full results only over the medium-term, not only
because of the short-term fiscal constraints, but also because it requires an evolution of the
society's mindset (from recipient to donor). During the CPS period, the WBG will aim to
advance this dialogue by identifying at least three areas (e.g., specific global public goods,
support to selected countries, aid effectiveness themes; concrete target areas will be identified by
the time of the CPS Progress Report) in which it could work in partnership with Poland in

27

support of global development goals. Through IFC, the WBG will also seek opportunities to
work with Polish companies interested in investing outside of Poland in emerging markets.
Instruments: possible IFC co-investments with Polish companies outside of Poland, advisory
services (Poland as a Global Partner).

D. IMPLEMENTING THE WORLD BANK GROUP CPS FOR POLAND

WBG ONGOING PROGRAM

67. 
The IBRD lending portfolio is limited to a single ongoing investment operation. This
reflects the WBG's focus on successive series of DPL loans as the main instruments to support
reforms. The ongoing Odra River Flood Protection Project (US$ 184 million, of which US$
140.3 million undisbursed), which is cofinanced with the EC and the Council of Europe
Development Bank (CEB), is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory. The initial difficulties and
delays in implementing this operation provide important lessons which will be reflected in
potential investment loans under the new CPS, including: (i) the need to strengthen capacity of
implementing entities, (ii) the importance of solid cross-agency cooperation, and (iii) the
criticality of adequate project readiness. The current TF portfolio consists of 14 active
TFs/grants. Current TF commitments amount to over US$ 50 million, with very solid
disbursements of about US$ 52 million in FY12/13, with sizable engagements for (i) the sale of
Polish Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) to the Carbon Fund for a total of EUR21 million;
(ii) three Prototype Carbon Fund projects; (iii) a highly-appreciated program funded by the
multi-donor Global Road Safety Facility; and (iv) an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant
for strengthening capacity to prepare a low emissions strategy.

68. 
The IBRD ongoing knowledge program is significant. This program has proven
a successful way to engage with the authorities in support of reforms. Over the last few years, it
has gradually expanded in several sectors, in support of a number of counterparts. It is closely
aligned with the government's own priorities for reform as well as with the EC's program. It
provides the basis for a sustained engagement in selected areas. It is mainly financed through the
WBG's own resources, though there is a nascent RAS program.

69. 
IFC and MIGA currently have a very limited involvement in Poland. IFC has three
active projects in Poland in discount grocery retail, microfinance, and an exposure to an SME
fund. As of end of May 2013, a total of US$ 17.09 million were committed in loans, equity and
quasi-equity of which a total of US$ 15.52 million were disbursed and are outstanding. The net
exposure of MIGA in Poland amounts to US$ 2.9 million in two projects, both in support of
foreign investment in the telecommunications sector.

Strategic Engagement Area 1: Economic Competitiveness
Enhanced business environment. The WBG is providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Justice (on
contract enforcement and insolvency) and to the Ministry of Infrastructure (on construction permits), under a series
of RAS agreements. The WBG also helped draft a modem banking resolution framework and recently completed an
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) which identified priorities for further reforms. With financing from
the Swiss Development Cooperation, IBRD is managing a multi-year program aimed at strengthening accounting
and auditing practices and the effective implementation of modem standards in this area.

Increased innovativeness. Building on a recently-completed and well-received analysis of public support to
innovation, the WBG is supporting the development of operational instruments to better support innovation under
the new EU perspective, under a RAS agreement. The WBG is also supporting the preparation of innovation
strategies, at both national and subnational (for the Swietokrzyskie region) levels, to inform the use of resources
under the upcoming EU perspective, also under RAS agreements.

Effective public finance. The WBG is working closely with the government within the context of the fiscal
consolidation agenda. The WBG is completing a review of international experience to inform an eventual reform of
public sector pay. The WBG is also reviewing the issue of savings in Poland (level, structure, adequacy, and
medium-term trends).

Strate2ic En2a2ement Area 2: Equity and Inclusion
Inclusive and effective labor market. The WBG has initiated a dialogue on in-work poverty and profiling of the
unemployed.

Balanced regional development. The WBG is supporting the development of regional strategies (for Eastern
Poland and the Slaskie region), building on best practice strategy work for the Lubelskie region. The WBG is also
working closely with subnational governments (and the MoF) on subnational debt management issues.

Reformed healthcare for an aging society. This ESW is part of a regional effort to look at challenges related to
ensuring a healthy, active, and prosperous aging. It looks in particular at issues of labor force participation, health
care (including long-term care), health condition of workers and pensions / social assistance systems.

Strategic Engagement Area 3: Climate Action

Informed climate change policy. The WBG is working with the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Environment
to develop modeling capacity to assess the macro impact of climate change-related policy decisions. The WBG is
also supporting the strengthening of capacity in the Ministries of Economy and Environment for the preparation of
low-emissions strategies.

Enhanced protection against floods. The WBG will continue to provide knowledge support at policy and sector
management level in this area through the ongoing and planned projects on the Odra and the Vistula.

Resource-efficient and safe infrastructure. The WBG is supporting the development of new instruments to help
operationalize EU priorities for energy efficiency, renewable, and environment, under a RAS agreement. The WBG
is also providing support for the preparation of a new road safety strategy.

Strategic Engagement Area 4: Contribution to development cooperation and global public goods

The WBG has engaged in a dialogue with the authorities for the preparation of the upcoming climate change
Conference of the Parties (COP), expected to take place in Warsaw in November 2013, and in possible synergies in
selected countries. The WBG is also engaged in discussions with non-governmental stakeholders to help promote
Poland's role on the global development scene.

FINANCIAL ENVELOPE AND INDICATIVE KNOWLEDGE SERVICES

70. 
The demand for IBRD financing over the CPS period is estimated at US$ 3.2 billion.
The indicative financing program for FY14 (at about US$ 900 million) is reasonably firm. The

29

actual lending volumes in FY15-FY17 will depend on economic developments and external
risks, Poland's performance and priorities, IBRD lending capacity, and demand from other
borrowers. In accordance with the government's preferences, the bulk of the resources 
is
expected to be provided through policy lending, with the possibility of a small number of ILs in
selected areas where the Bank can provide added value through its global expertise and through
its engagement. The IBRD indicative financing program is presented in Annex 4. For FY14 and
FY15 it includes a DPL series of two operations with a focus on a pro-growth policy agenda,
a possible railway restructuring project, and a possible hospital restructuring project. The
program for the remainder of the CPS period may be adjusted in the CPS Progress Report in
consultation with the government based on the evolution of the country's priorities. At this stage,
the pipeline for FY16/17 could include a further DPL series (to support structural reforms in
view of the economic environment at the time of design), a possible Vistula River Basin Flood
Protection Project, and a possible Social Inclusion Project. Selection of activities for IBRD
support will be guided by the government's demand and the criteria for IBRD financial
engagement (signaling function, additional resource mobilization, emergency policy response, or
lasting impact on institutional capacity).

71. 
IFC is considering a focused re-engagement in light of the challenges facing Poland's
economy. Subject to market demand and conditions, IFC will explore opportunities to invest
selectively in renewable energy and other climate-friendly projects; to engage in the health sector
through the financing of public-private partnerships as well as direct investments; to support
development of Poland's bond market and to support the internationalization of Polish firms
through cooperation in projects beyond Polish borders. Support in structuring and implementing
PPPs in health and other sectors in particular has the potential to contribute to the mobilization of
private investment into vital infrastructure during a time of economic stress and limited public
resources; to support Poland's progress towards energy efficiency targets; to mitigate real and
perceived market and regulatory risk; and to demonstrate the potential of PPPs to neighboring
countries with less developed or untested regulatory frameworks. IFC's efforts are expected to be
complementary to IBRD's activities within the broader framework of the WBG engagement. The
level of IFC commitments during the CPS period will depend on market demand and adequate
role for IFC, but could be in the range of US$25-50 million per year.

72. MIGA is expected to remain a minor partner in Poland. MIGA will continue to
underwrite projects in Poland, encourage inward FDI, and contribute to the WBG's efforts to
promote the internationalization of Polish firms.

73. 
The core of IBRD program will consist of knowledge products: Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) and Technical Assistance (TA) in support of all CPS strategic engagement areas.
The indicative analytical program for the first two years of the CPS is reasonably well defined
(see Annex 4), though it may be adjusted to reflect evolving demands for specific activities. It
often builds upon an existing engagement, either to deepen the level of analysis, to operationalize
earlier recommendations, or to expand the dialogue to connected issues. Particular attention will
be paid to the development of knowledge products which can also benefit other countries
(e.g., by developing methodologies for Poland which can then be used in other parts of the
region). Poland is also expected to benefit from analytical work at the regional level, including
through the periodic Regular Economic Reports (RER) which will continue to analyze short-term
economic developments and present an economic and social outlook. A large part of the TA will

30

be provided on a programmatic basis, so as to support a multi-year dialogue in a flexible yet
sustained manner. IBRD ESW and technical assistance (especially in the areas of labor force
participation and aging) are expected to address gender issues.

74. 
IBRD will continue to make efforts to develop the use of RASs, as a way for IBRD to
expand its capacity to deliver knowledge services over and above what can be financed
from Bank budget. RASs are governed by the same quality and fiduciary standards as the rest
of IBRD's program, and the same procedures of monitoring and evaluation apply. The key to
produce results for Poland through the RAS instrument are a close client relationship, flexibility
and a clear value proposition. In the short-term, the demand is expected to remain relatively
limited (due to both the fiscal consolidation environment and administrative obstacles) and
IBRD's approach will consist in focusing on a few strategic areas where it has established a solid
track record and a trust-based relationship, and in developing a modular approach with a series of
relatively small, successive tasks (the definition of each task being adjusted at the time of
inception to reflect shifting circumstances and priorities). The RAS portfolio is expected to grow
in size (as budget resources are heavily constrained), yet to remain limited compared to other EU
members which have hired IBRD to help with administrative reforms to support better
implementation of EU funds. IBRD will continue to finance analytical and advisory services in
areas which it sees as critical for the implementation of the bottom 40 percent agenda and where
RAS may not be a feasible option - as well as for selected knowledge activities where the WBG
engagement in Poland could contribute to informing the policy dialogue in other countries.

75. 
The fiduciary risks for program implementation remain moderate. Following
significant improvements in Public Financial Management (PFM) during the EU accreditation
process, the PFM enshrines enhanced budget transparency, predictability and performance-
orientation over the medium term. The reform agenda (based on the 2009 Public Finance Act
(PFA), amended in 2010) introduced performance-oriented four year rolling budget planning
with binding annual cash based budget, cash management consolidation, and strengthened
internal control over public expenditures and debt via new regulations on corrective actions
triggered by debt thresholds. The Ministry of Finance is currently implementing multiyear
performance budgeting program. More efforts are expected to streamline the national flow of
funds and budgetary processes, to harmonize public sector accounting and reporting standards
and practices on EU level as led by EC and supported with further integration of IT systems.

PARTNERSHIP AND DONOR COORDINATION

76. 
The WBG is committed to ensuring a tight alignment at both strategic and
operational levels of its activities with EU priorities and programs, as discussed above.
A significant part of the WBG advisory services will be aimed at strengthening capacity to make
the most of available EU resources. The WBG also maintains a close partnership with the EC
through the organization of regular knowledge-sharing events (including dissemination 
in
Brussels of key knowledge products) and the development of ad hoc cooperation in selected
areas (in particular in areas where the WBG's technical expertise and local knowledge can
contribute to advancing the EU agenda).

77. 
The WBG cooperates closely with other multilateral institutions and development
partners. The WBG conducts regular consultations with the IMF. It is also cofinancing a project

31

with the CEB, and will look for further cofinancing opportunities with both EIB and CEB. The
WBG is also implementing a large program of technical assistance on financial reporting, which
is financed by the Swiss Development Cooperation (for CHF 10 million), and will strive to
further strengthen this relationship. The WBG will also aim to closely coordinate with the IMF
and seek synergies with EIB, CEB, and EBRD

78. The WBG aims to support Poland's growing and varied civil society 
in its
partnership roles. This will include further outreach to local NGOs as a mean to seek insights
and exchange on Poland's development challenges and possible solutions; 
to research
institutions and think tanks as partners in the definition and design of technical solutions within
the context of the WBG's knowledge work; and to universities as centers of excellence and
centers of influence on the public debate.

MANAGING THE WBG PROGRAM

79. 
The WBG will track progress towards achieving the country outcomes defined in the
CPS results framework, spelled out in Annex 1. On this basis, the WBG will conduct an annual
CPS implementation review for assessing progress under the CPS and possible adjustments to
the WBG program. This review process is also expected to provide inputs for the planned CPS
Progress Report in FY16 when adjustments in the CPS results framework will be made if
necessary.

80. 
IBRD's program management will also include an annual review process with the
government and will build on it with the purpose of strengthening portfolio implementation,
improving lending efficiency, furthering the knowledge agenda, and leveraging resources
through strategic partnerships with Polish institutions and multilateral agencies. To maintain the
quality of knowledge services delivery and portfolio performance, the country management unit
works closely with technical teams to ensure a proactive approach in solving issues during
implementation.

81. 
The WBG will make a particular effort to develop adequate systems to monitor the
impact and effectiveness of knowledge products, as part of a WBG-wide level exercise. This
will require defining approaches and instruments to assess what can be attributed to the WBG
involvement in the reforms implemented and the development results achieved by the country.

32

IV. MANAGING RISKS

82. 
The implementation of the proposed CPS program face political, economic, social,
and implementation risks. The WBG is proposing measures to address and mitigate these risks.

(i) 

Impact of 2015 Parliamentary elections. In the run-up to the elections, the pace of
reform may slow down. The WBG will phase its engagement accordingly and aim to help
frontload key reforms well ahead of the beginning of the campaign. The elections results
may also lead to a change or at least a reshuffling of the government, with potentially
significant consequences on both the reform agenda and the partnership between Poland
and the WBG. The FY16 CPS Progress Report will provide an opportunity and an
instrument for the WBG to adjust it program to the new circumstances, if and as may be
needed.

(ii) Persistent turmoil in the Euro zone. Poland's economic performance will continue to
depend on developments in the Euro zone. The Government is well aware of these risks
which combine with internal factors such as tepid household consumption and a sharp
slump in public investment and is taking steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis. The
WBG will remain flexible to adjust its program to changing circumstances, and in
particular to intensify its support (both financial and non-financial) in the case of a further
deterioration of the external environment.

(iii) Social resistance to reforms. The government has taken an overall cautious stance on
reforms to avoid antagonizing critical constituencies. Yet it has also demonstrated its
capacity to move forcefully when needed. In parallel, over the last period, the Polish
society has shown its maturity by supporting some difficult reforms (e.g., raising the
pension retirement age). The WBG will focus its activities in areas where there is
a demonstrated commitment 
to 
reform, and 
support 
the authorities 
in 
their
communication strategy, if and as may be appropriate.

(iv) Implementation risks. Implementation risks are low, in an environment where fiduciary
controls are strong. The main implementation risks are related to possible delays in
specific 
activities, an 
issue 
that 
falls under management's responsibility. The
development of a RAS program may continue to be hampered by legal and administrative
issues (and in particular constraints on the sole source contracting of the WBG for the
delivery of analytical and advisory services).

83. Notwithstanding the risks, the engagement between Poland and the WBG is expected
to bring high development rewards for both Poland and the WBG. For Poland, the
development impact will come through the implementation of the WBG-supported program
presented in this strategy, in particular through increased engagement on structural reforms in
support of a shared prosperity agenda. For the international community, the rewards will be
channeled through the development of "public good" knowledge services and an enhanced
contribution of Poland to the global development agenda.

Annex 2: Shared Prosperity - An Agenda for Poland

1. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) has established ambitious but achievable goals to
anchor its overarching mission and to galvanize international and national efforts in this
endeavor. Accordingly, the institution will strive to (i) end extreme poverty at the global level
within a generation and (ii) promote what may be called "shared prosperity": a sustainable
increase in the well-being of the poorer segments of society. This second goal reflects the fact
that all countries aspire to rapid and sustained increases in living standards for all of their
citizens, not just the already privileged. The corresponding indicator can be summarized as:
foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country. Yet,
promoting shared prosperity must also be achieved in such a way as to be sustainable over time
and across generations, which requires promoting environmental, social, and fiscal sustainability.

2. 
In a country like Poland, the WBG needs to focus on the shared prosperity agenda.
Extreme poverty, as defined by an income per capita below US$ 1.25 per day, is marginal. Yet,
the bottom 40 percent of the population continues to struggle with issues of unemployment, lack
of relevant skills, and uneven access to services and opportunities. Furthermore, the crisis has
eroded some of the gains that were made in previous years and income growth for this part of the
population is now slower than for the top 60 percent. There are also difficult issues of
sustainability, especially on the environmental side, where Poland remains one of the most
carbon-reliant EU economies.

3. 
The shared prosperity agenda to create an "opportunity society" ought to reflect
a three-fold approach: (i) sustain overall economic growth, which is key to the bottom 40
percent's prospects - by mitigating the impact of the difficult external environment in the short-
term and by avoiding a sharp decrease of Poland's long-term growth potential due to aging and
to the end of the "catching up" growth model; (ii) ensure that the bottom 40 percent of the
population can enjoy the benefits of such growth, including in terms of accessing economic
opportunities as well as benefiting from efficient social services; and (iii) enhance the
sustainability of the country's economic development, in particular on the environmental

front.

4. 
The FY14-17 CPS for Poland is articulated along these lines. Activities under the first
pillar, "economic competitiveness", aim to help sustain overall economic growth with a focus on
business environment, innovation, and public finance effectiveness. Activities under the second
pillar, "equity and inclusion", target three groups which are facing difficult circumstances among
the bottom 40 percent of the population - the unemployed (inclusive labor market), those living
in lagging regions (balanced regional development), and the older / less healthy people
(strengthened health care and health prevention in an aging society). Activities under the third
pillar, "climate action", are directly focused on strengthening the environmental sustainability of
Poland's development, with a focus on informed climate change policy making, adaptation and
flood protection, and resource efficient infrastructure. Finally, activities under the last pillar,
"Poland as a global development partner", are geared towards facilitating Poland's contribution
to other countries' development agenda.

hospitals, is both costly and ineffective in addressing these issues.

Line of Sight:

Achieving the CPS Objective will make it possible for the authorities to
enhance effectiveness 
in the management and moderization of their
hospital networks, which in turn will contribute to developing a more
effective care system which can deliver quality services and cope with the
needs of an aging society. This in turn will result in enhanced health

outcomes, increased opportunities to participate in the labor market for

vulnerable parts of society and reduced (or delayed) old age disability (and

hence poverty) - which will contribute to fostering income growth for the

part of part of the bottom 40 percent of the population who are aged.

Poland's economy is among the least emissions-efficient in the EU, mainly

due to the country's dependence on coal (especially in the power sector), to

very high rates of emission growth in the transport sector, and to an energy

efficiency performance that remains below EU averages. The EU has set

a goal for Poland to limit the growth of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions
to 14 percent between 2005 and 2020 (i.e. significantly below the expected

cumulative rate of economic growth over this period). This implies a change
in production structures and energy consumption patterns, which is resisted
by powerful constituencies.

Line of Sight:

Achieving the CPS Objective will facilitate the adoption of the most

turn will facilitate and / or accelerate Poland's transition to a lower carbon

Infrastructure choices have long-lived and difficult-to-reverse impacts on the

carbon, land, and water intensity of future patterns of development making it

a key concern for the sustainability of the shared prosperity agenda.
Line of Sight:

Achieving the CPS Objective will make it possible to gradually increase the
reliance on low carbon infrastructure (in particular by supporting reforms
aimed at increasing the efficiency and hence the attractiveness of railways,
compared with road transport). This in turn will translate into diminished

emissions over time, which will contribute to mitigating the impact of the

Polish economic development on global climate, and hence 

to the

sustainability of the WBG's poverty eradication and shared prosperity

agenda.

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) assesses the World
Bank Group's (WBG) partnership with Poland under the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)

for FY2009-13. The CPS was presented to the Board on June 2, 2009. The program remained largely
valid throughout the implementation period, though it was slightly adjusted in the May 9, 2011 CPS
Progress Report (CPSPR), in particular to increase the focus on the European perspective and to
further advance the concept of a two-way knowledge partnership (and to adjust the Results Matrix
accordingly). The present Completion Report (i) evaluates progress made towards the achievement of
the CPS program outcomes; (ii) assesses the WBG performance during the implementation period;
and (iii) draws lessons and recommendations for the preparation of the forthcoming CPS (FY2013-
17). The CPSCR uses the updated CPSPR Results Matrix as the reference for assessing CPS program
performance.

2. 

The WBG is a relatively minor player in Poland, yet a well-appreciated one. In the 1990s

and early 2000s, the WBG had a large financing and analytical program in a broad range of sectors.
With the country's entry into the EU in 2004, the WBG saw its role and activities diminish
substantially. In financial terms, current IBRD's annual lending represents at most 7 percent of EU
grants, and a fraction of the European Investment Bank (EIB) operations - and IFC and MIGA are
providing marginal support. The EU also provides significant opportunities for knowledge
acquisition (through exchanges and discussions with other EU members, and the implementation of
its directives and regulations). Still, the WBG's image is good and its technical expertise is widely
respected.

3. 
The implementation of the CPS was affected by the global crisis, but the flexibility built
in the CPS program proved to serve Poland well. The environment in which the CPS was

implemented significantly deteriorated compared to what had been expected, as Poland suffered from
the contagion of the global, and later Euro area crisis. Yet, within the broad strategic parameters set
in the CPS, the WBG strove to best respond to the evolving demand of the Government and managed
to make an effective contribution in several areas. This was achieved in large part through the
flexible delivery of knowledge services. In parallel, IBRD reengaged on the financial side, with
several large policy-based lending operations, which provided an anchor to the partnership.

4. 

Both program and Bank performance are rated as moderately satisfactory. Out of the 25

CPS anticipated outcomes 14 were fully achieved (including those that required the most significant
policy actions), and 11 were partially achieved. The largest progress was made in reforming social
sectors and public finance as well as in supporting regional development and strengthening the
business environment and the financial sector. Challenges remain to better support innovation, to
further advance reforms in infrastructure sectors, and to implement an effective climate change
mitigation agenda. In parallel, the WBG performance in designing and implementing the CPS
program was overall sound. Areas of strength included the strategic selection of areas of engagement
(and corresponding instruments) as well as the technical quality of knowledge-based activities and
development policy loans. Yet, the CPS results framework proved insufficient to allow for an
effective monitoring of results, and part of the program was not implemented (especially on the
lending side). Some of the most innovative areas of engagement (e.g., Poland as a donor) also remain

challenging.

II. 

5. 

PROGRESS TOWARDS POLAND DEVELOPMENT GOALS

The CPS period was marked by political stability and Government continuity. The

coalition formed in late 2007 by the Civic Platform (PO) and the Polish Peasants Party (PSL), and
led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk (PO), remained broadly stable and enjoyed relatively strong
social support. In the October 2011 Parliamentary elections, the coalition obtained a renewed
mandate to govern for a second four-year term (the first time in recent Polish history a governing
coalition is not replaced after elections). With a small but workable majority in the Parliament, the
coalition Government was able to adopt and implement a solid set of policy reforms, in particular in
the areas of crisis mitigation, fiscal consolidation, social protection and pensions, and business
environment.

6. 

The CPS period also coincided with a time of economic slowdown, spurred by the global

and later Euro area crisis. While the domestic economy remained relatively solid until 2012,
Poland's economy, which is deeply integrated within the EU, was substantially affected by the crisis.
The main contagion channels included exports as well as business and consumers' confidence (the
financial sector remained relatively solid, profitable, and well capitalized, 
thanks to a strict
supervision of financial authorities). Since 2008 unemployment rose continuously (by 4 percentage
point over the period) reaching 13.4 percent of the active population in 2012.

7. 

The Government managed an effective policy response to these challenges:

* Through proactive fiscal and monetary policies. The Government financed a relatively large
stimulus in 2009 / 2010, which contributed to mitigating the impact of the crisis. As economic
growth strengthened, the authorities engaged in a vigorous effort of fiscal consolidation over
2011 and 2012, while also adopting a number of policy measures aimed at strengthening the
quality of public finance management. In parallel, the authorities effectively implemented
counter cyclical monetary and exchange rate policies.

* Through the implementation of an ambitious agenda of structural reforms, especially in

the social sectors and to support private sector development. Some of the flagship reforms
included: increasing the retirement age to 67 (from 60 for women and 65 for men) and
removing some of the privileges of the uniformed services' pension system; and introducing
a number of policy reforms to strengthen the business environment (Poland was the "top
performer" under the Doing Business 2013 ranking and improved by 19 places over the 2009-

2012 period).

* Through the effective absorption of a sizeable amount of EU funds. Poland was the main

beneficiary of EU structural and cohesion funds under the current EU financial perspective
(2007-2013), with a seven-year envelope of C68.7 billion. The authorities managed 
to
effectively absorb these resources, at both central and subnational levels, which stimulated
public investment and largely compensated for the decline in private financing. EU grants were
largely used to support infrastructure development, in particular in the transport, environment
and ICT sectors - as well as to enhance innovation, entrepreneurship and human capital
development.

8. 
Overall, despite the crisis, Poland made continued progress towards its primary goal,
i.e. a rapid convergence 
towards European Union (EU) 
living standards. In a difficult

environment, Poland managed to maintain a sound economic performance and was the EU country
whose economy grew the most, in aggregate terms, between 2009 and 2012 (it was also the only EU
country to avoid recession in 2009) -
though average growth was significantly below that of the

44

earlier period. Economic activity weakened significantly in 2012 (to 2.1 percent) due to the
worsening external environment. Overall, Poland's per capita income increased from 56 percent to
64 percent of the EU average during the CPS period, though there remain significant gaps in the
country's development, e.g. in terms of infrastructure or innovation. The Gini coefficient at 0.31
suggests relatively limited inequalities, but the fast rate of poverty reduction that the country
experienced until 2008 slowed to a halt due to the crisis: since 2009, the poverty rate has remained
somewhat stable (and poverty 
is 
increasingly concentrated 
in specific groups such as the
unemployed, families with low education, families with many children, and households in small
towns and rural areas).

9. 
Over the medium-term, Poland's objective is to pursue and eventually complete this
convergence process, in terms of economic growth and enhanced living standards. In the longer-
term, Poland will need to make a five-fold adjustment. First, further move from a growth model
based on post-transition catching up to one spurred by innovation-driven productivity gains, and
further move up the value chain. Second, meet the needs of an aging of society: while recent reforms
have ensured the sustainability of the pensions system, there remain significant challenges in terms of
labor force participation, health care (including long-term care), and old age poverty/exclusion.
Third, complete the process of institutional transformation and modernization. Fourth, ensure
a balanced development across the country, and help the poorest regions catch up (the recent
convergence with the EU has been accompanied by a divergence across regions). And fifth, tackle
environmental and climate-related challenges and gradually move from a coal-based to a low-
emissions economy.

III. CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

10. The Completion Report rates program performance as Moderately Satisfactory. Out of
25 anticipated outcomes in the CPS Results Matrix, 14 were fully achieved (including those requiring
the most difficult policy actions) and 11 were partially achieved. In this section the Report evaluates
progress 
in achieving key CPS outcomes by strategic engagement pillars and 
themes.
A comprehensive CPS Results Matrix is attached in Annex 1 to this CPSCR.

Pillar 1: Social and Spatial Inclusion

11. Poland undertook ambitious reforms in the social sectors, in particular regarding
pensions. Performance in implementing the program supported under the CPS in the areas of labor
market, social assistance and pensions was satisfactory, and outcome indicators were largely reached.
In spite of the crisis, the employment rate remained stable at around 60 percent of population aged
20-64 in 2008-2011. In the same period the labor force participation rate of population aged 55-64
rose by over 6 percent from 33.3 percent to 39.6 percent. This was stimulated by the tightening of
early retirement privileges, a new program (50+), which aimed at increasing employment of older
workers as well as less generous unemployment benefits, and more flexible working arrangements
during the crisis. In parallel, the mandatory length of service for uniformed services, including the
military (under the Ministry of Defense) and police, border security, fire-fighting services and
government security (under the Ministry of Interior) increased from 15 to 25 years and the statutory
retirement age for these groups increased to 55 years. The program of the first series of DPLs
Employment Entrepreneurship and Human Capital (DPL2-DPL3) largely supported this agenda as it
concentrated on the core aspects of public finance management, labor market efficiency and social
sector expenditures. The Public Finance Development series of DPLs (PFD DPL) further supported

45

reforms, including the increase of the statutory retirement age. The IBRD lending program was
underpinned by strong analytical work, in particular by Public Expenditure Review (PER) ESW.

12. Poland successfully introduced further improvements in the education sector. All CPS
outcomes in this sector were fully achieved. In particular, Poland managed to significantly increase
the pre-school participation rates among 5-year old children to nearly 97 percent in the school year
2011/2012. In parallel, the Government successfully pursued higher education reforms, in particular
through the implementation of a pro-quality financing system and a precise definition of a catalog of
free of charge education services provided to students by tertiary schools, in line with the CPS
objectives. The WBG largely supported this agenda through the DPL series (DPL2-DPL3) with the
accompanying package of technical assistance, in particular in higher education.

13. Poland made progress in strengthening efficiency in the health sector. All CPS outcomes
in this sector were achieved. In particular, progress was made in improving efficiency of hospitals
through the implementation of a "Diagnostically Related Group" (DRG) system, which covered 91
percent of hospitals in end-2010. A voluntary program converting public hospitals into corporate
entities operating under the Commercial Code was implemented and over 220 hospitals were
corporatized by end-2010. The WBG actively assisted the Government in implementing these
reforms, in particular through the DPL series (DPL2-DPL3) and technical assistance.

14. Poland moved forward on its regional development agenda, including with regard to the
decentralization of responsibilities for managing and implementing EU funds. The two
corresponding CPS outcomes were fully achieved. The technical capacity of regional governments to
use EU funds has increased since 2007 when they became responsible for designing, planning and
implementing EU funds through Regional Operational Programs (ROPs): the absorption capacity of
regions has been strong during the entire EU financial perspective 2007-13, and the ROPs have been
the best performing EU programs in Poland. Improvements were also observed in sub-national debt
and asset management due to improved regulations and stronger capacity. The WBG supported the
authorities through a series of analytical products, hands-on technical assistance at both national and
subnational levels, and a substantive policy dialogue, in particular around the World Development
Report (WDR) 2009 on Reshaping Economic Geography.

Pillar 2: Public Sector Reform

15. 
In a time of crisis, the Government placed a high priority on improving the quality of
public finance. Satisfactory progress was made towards the achievement of all corresponding CPS
outcomes. The Government made substantive progress in improving effectiveness and efficiency of
public spending, as evidenced by regular monitoring reports of the WBG, International Monetary
Fund, and European Commission, though performance-based budgeting is still under development.
The Government managed to reduce the fiscal deficit from nearly 8 percent in 2010 to 5.1 percent in
2011 and 3.4 percent in 2012. This brought Poland's government deficit in line with the reference
value of 3 percent of GDP. Poland also introduced strengthened fiscal control in 2011 as part of
a broader fiscal consolidation agenda. This agenda was largely supported by the first operation from
the second DPL series Public Finance Development (PFD DPL), which focused on the consolidation
of public finances and fiscal institutions, and by analytical work including the Public Expenditure
Review (PER) and the EU10 Fiscal Study on Performance-Based Budgeting, which informed and
enriched 
the discussion in Poland on the introduction of the performance-based budgeting
requirement.

46

Pillar 3: Growth and Competitiveness

16. The Government further improved transport infrastructure. Two of the CPS outcomes in
this area were fully achieved and two were partially achieved. The Government adopted
a comprehensive legal package, which provided for significant improvements in the implementation
of infrastructure projects, including to facilitate the use of PPPs. Total roads in good conditions
increased from 49 percent in 2005 to 63 percent in 2012, in most part due to large EU financing and
stable funding for maintenance (in spite of the reduction of financial resources for rehabilitation).
The IBRD Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMR3), as a continuation of two IBRD
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation loans (RMR] and RMR2) contributed to the improvement of
national road rehabilitation and maintenance systems, particularly in areas of quality, efficiency of
spending and by laying the ground for further progress towards financial viability. The WBG
substantially contributed to policy development at the subnational level, in particular through
a package of policy notes delivered to the City of Warsaw on Sustainable Urban/Metropolitan
Transport and Spatial Development.

17. Poland significantly improved the business environment. Progress in pursuing regulatory
reforms was well ahead of the expected CPS outcomes. In 2012 Poland managed to reduce the cost
of obtaining business licenses to 13 percent of per capita income and the time to register property to
54 days. Significant simplifications for entrepreneurs were introduced in 90 various pieces of
legislation through the implementation of the Law on Reduction of Administrative Barriers for
Citizens and Entrepreneurs. The law reduced administrative fees, especially the cost of SME start -
ups, and fastened business processes such as starting a business, property registration, paying taxes,
enforcing contracts, and protecting investors. The WBG supported the deregulation agenda through
the DPL1-DPL3. To further improve the business regulatory environment, the Government sought
the WBG's assistance through a Reimbursable Advisory Services agreement on "Towards a stronger
contract enforcement and insolvency in Poland", which was successfully delivered in FY13.

18. Poland made only marginal progress in promoting innovation in the private sector. CPS
program performance has been moderately satisfactory in this area. There have been some slight
improvements in spending on public R&D, primarily driven by EU funds, but at a low level: from
0.19 percent in 2009 to 0.21 percent in 2011. Patent applications (8 patents per million inhabitants)
remained an order of magnitude below the EU average of 108.6 patents per million inhabitants. The
WBG provided the Government with a review of the public system that is responsible for supporting
and promoting innovation in Poland, through technical assistance (which was co-financed by the
government) on Review ofPublic Enterprise Innovation Support Systems.

Pillar 4: Regional and Global Public Goods

19. On energy and climate change, performance was moderately satisfactory. In a number of
areas progress has been encouraging, but given that the majority of the CPS outcome indicators refer
to target year end-2013, their final evaluation could be possible only in mid-2014. The Government
established mechanisms to operationalize trading system for White Certificates18 , and all regulations
are now in place, with the first white certificates to be issued in 2013. In parallel, progress was made
in increasing the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption from 8 percent in 2009 to

18 White Certificates are a relatively new policy instrument. Specific time-bound energy saving targets are established for energy
suppliers or distributors who must meet those targets by implementing energy efficiency measures among their clients. Energy
suppliers or distributors, who exceed the targets, can sell their unused white certificates to suppliers/distributors that fall short of
their target. Alternatively they can buy white certificates against a substitute or penalty fee from the Regulator.

47

10.6 percent in 2011; in increasing the share of cogeneration to 16.6 percent in 2011; and in installing
109,000 smart meters with an additional 310,000 scheduled to be installed in 2013. The Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy DPL (EE DPL) reinforced the Government agenda in this area.
The policy dialogue was underpinned by a CEM on Poland's Transition to Low-Emissions Economy
and technical assistance on Economic Modeling for Climate Policy (to strengthen the Government's
analytical capacity to simulate the economic impact of climate policy decisions).

20. After some initial delays, progress was made in strengthening flood protection system
along the Odra River. Flood protection in this region has been a long-standing challenge, which
includes both physical and institutional aspects. Progress was made in strengthening cooperation
across the various entities involved, and in launching major construction works upstream of and
around the city of Wroclaw. Based on current progress, the CPS outcome indicator is expected to be
achieved, though with a two-year delay. The WBG supported this effort through the Odra River
Basin Flood Protection Project.

21. Poland was successful in preserving financial sector stability during the financial crisis.
The Government implemented EU and G20 mandatory regulatory initiatives to increase bank core
capital and counter cyclical 
loss reserves. Progress toward CPS outcomes has been largely
satisfactory as domestic banking sector remained well capitalized, liquid and profitable throughout
the crisis. In 2012 capital to asset ratio exceeded 14 percent and non-performing loans (NPLs)
stabilized at about 8.5 percent. The Polish authorities sought further WBG's assistance to improve
system preparedness for potential future shocks and the Bank resolution framework TA provided
Poland with a solid framework and layout for the future system.

IV. WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE

22. The Completion Report rates Bank performance as Moderately Satisfactory. Positive
aspects of Bank performance included: (i) the establishment of a trust-based relationship with Polish
counterparts; (ii) the flexibility and responsiveness demonstrated by the WBG in the face of changing
circumstances; (iii) the delivery of a solid package of support, including analytical and advisory
services as well as financing during the crisis; and (iv) the delivery of quality knowledge work in line
with the intended objectives of the CPS. Bank performance was less satisfactory with regard to:
(i) the delivery of part of the original CPS program (in particular investment loans); (ii) the
development of a sound portfolio of Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS); and (iii) the
establishment of a mature partnership with Poland on global development issues.

23. The CPS program was well aligned with the Government priorities, and provided a good
and realistic framework for WBG activities over the four-year period. The strategic priorities
were sound and adequately reflected Poland's development challenges and the authorities' policy
agenda. The CPS flexible design allowed the Bank to introduce timely adjustments to the program,
and in particular to support the Government in mitigating the impact of the crisis while pursuing its
long-term development agenda. The mid-term Progress Report introduced minor modifications to the
CPS to better reflect the changing global environment and to coordinate the WBG's activities around
Poland's EU role more effectively. The CPSPR also placed an increased emphasis on knowledge
partnerships and Poland's role as a global partner.

24. The CPS result matrix, updated in the CPSPR, did not provide a strong framework for
monitoring and evaluation. The CPS outcomes indicators were aligned with the country-level
development goals, which posed difficult attribution issues and made it challenging to assess the
actual contribution by the WBG in program implementation. Some outcomes indicators had a target

48

year in end-2013, which did not allow for a solid evaluation of program performance at this stage
(since data will be available in mid-2014). In hindsight, a smaller number of CPS outcomes, focused
on strategic achievements, with clear attribution would have provided a stronger framework.

25. 
Three sets of risks identified in the CPS - economic, political, and institutional were well
managed, and no other significant risk emerged during the CPS period. Poland managed to

weather the consequences of the global crisis reasonably well. The CPS period was marked by
political stability, and the Government demonstrated a continued commitment to reform. Also, while
technical capacity remains uneven in some areas (especially at decentralized 
level), it proved
sufficient for Poland to implement reforms and effectively manage large inflows of EU funds.

26. The CPS lending program was focused on development policy loans. The program was

anchored around successive programmatic DPL series in support of Government policy reforms,
which were crucial to maintain Poland's convergence process on track (public finance, labor market
and social sectors, private sector development as well as climate change). The program of 5 DPLs
delivered during the CPS period (and one scheduled for Board for June 18, 2013) amounted to USD
6 billion. At the same time, none of the investment loans planned in the CPS materialized, including
a Program for Results operation, which had been contemplated in the energy and / or transport
sectors. This was due to the Government's focus on crisis mitigation reforms and its limited
investment capacity. In addition, lending operations supporting sub-national governments and SMEs
planned in the CPS did not materialize either due to constraints in providing guarantee to non-
sovereign borrowers. The investment portfolio decreased over the course of the CPS from four
projects to currently one under implementation. The detailed planned lending program and actual
deliveries is attached in Annex 2.

27. The quality of the lending portfolio was overall satisfactory, with some weak elements.

The successive ICRs (and corresponding IEG evaluations) available for two policy loans delivered
under the CPS rated performance of each individual loan as satisfactory. Performance under the
investment portfolio (with typically much smaller projects) was mixed: some projects faced
implementation difficulties resulting in delays and project restructuring. Consequently, out of three
projects closed during the period, two were rated moderately satisfactory and one moderately
unsatisfactory. Across the portfolio, fiduciary performance was consistently strong.

28. The delivery of Analytical and Advisory Activities was strong, and overall satisfactory.

Ten pieces of Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and twenty-two Technical Assistance (TA) tasks
were delivered during the CPS implementation period. The strategic relevance of this program was
strong, in large part thanks to an effective dialogue with demanding counterparts. The entire list of
ESW anticipated in the CPS was delivered, though the specific focus of each piece was altered to
reflect changing circumstances. 
In this respect, additional pieces were 
included 
(e.g., on
competitiveness) as a just-in-time response to the revised priorities of the Government. The original
TA program was also adjusted in response to the client's changing needs. This includes both
dropping activities, for which the government gave less priority as well as expanding the list by those
of particular importance. The comprehensive list of non-lending services, planned and actual
deliveries, is attached in Annex 3.

29. Technical quality and relevance of knowledge services remained strong. This was mainly

due to the mobilization of strong Bank-wide sectoral teams in specific areas. Yet, timeliness of
delivery was uneven, with several pieces being delayed beyond the original deadlines. The AAA
program benefited from a strong client engagement, which materialized in valuable comments and
adjustments for a number of tasks (this process was very beneficial as it strengthened the quality and

49

relevance of these products). Performance in the dissemination of AAA products was mixed, with the
WBG often pursuing a conventional approach to dissemination (final "delivery workshop" and press
interview) While individual products have enjoyed considerable media coverage, challenges remain
in terms of reaching out to broad audiences and using new communication tools (website, social
media) to share the findings and recommendations made by the WBG in its AAA work. Overall, the
impact of the AAA tasks was solid, though variable across sectors, typically ranging from informing
the public debate to providing the foundation for a new legislation that was effectively adopted.

30. The development of Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) has been relatively limited,
especially compared to other EU members. This partly reflects Poland's stronger administrative
capacity (in particular to manage and absorb EU funds) and a more advanced stage of policy reform
and stronger institutions. It also reflects a business culture that is wary of large-scale, medium-term
contractual arrangements in an environment where demands are constantly shifting and where the
authorities prefer to keep some leverage on their partners. The development of RAS was also
hampered by administrative difficulties on the Polish side (a number of entities remain reluctant to
engage the WBG on a sole-source basis). Some progress was made during the CPS implementation
period, and initial agreements were signed (and delivered) with a few partners - but this is an
engagement that is yet to be consolidated and deepened.

31. The WBG also made efforts to engage in a "stretch area" which proved challenging,
i.e. to establish a mature partnership with Poland on global development issues (as the country
becomes an increasingly strong voice within the EU and OECD). This agenda proved difficult in the
absence of a strong institutional champion on the Polish side. In an environment of fiscal
consolidation, ODA contributions are not perceived as a priority. Time will be necessary to make
progress around a well-defined agenda, including dimensions such as Poland as knowledge provider
and Poland as an ally in selected global forums.

32. During the CPS period, the WBG strengthened its partnership with the European
Commission (EC), as well as with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Council of Europe
Development Bank (CEB). The WBG engagement was largely placed within the broader framework
of complementarity and support of the EC's program (which became explicit in the CPSPR). The
partnership with the EC was centered on knowledge sharing on issues of particular importance and
relevance to Poland and the EU, e.g. low-emissions growth, innovation and smart specialization.

33. 
IFC's role during the CPS period was 
limited due to Poland's strong economic
performance and the growing availability of private financing in the country. IFC provided
USD 27 million in support to a microfinance bank to increase access to finance for micro and small
entrepreneurs through two investments in FY09 and FY10. At the end of the CPS period, IFC
maintained a committed portfolio of USD 17.1 million (USD 15.5 million outstanding) with three
clients in the retail, funds and financial markets sectors.

34. MIGA's contribution to the WBG's program in Poland over the last four years was
relatively modest. During the 2009-13 CPS period, MIGA's gross exposure amounted to US$ 54.8
million, mainly in support of debt and equity investments into local Polish subsidiaries of European
banking groups.

V. 

LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

35. The partnership between Poland and the WBG provides a number of lessons that can
inform both the upcoming CPS and the Bank-wide knowledge and shared prosperity agenda.

Indeed Poland is one of the most developed WBG clients, and the lessons learned through this
engagement can usefully be reflected in the WBG's approach to upper Middle-Income Countries and
in knowledge-based support programs. A number of the specific, sector-level lessons are outlined in
the Results Matrix. This section focuses on the broader, more strategic learning - and its implications
for the design of the next CPS.

36. The first set of lessons relates to the delivery of knowledge services:

* Even in a sophisticated OECD member country, there is a continued demand for WBG

knowledge services. With its well-trained cadre of civil servants and its solid network of think
tanks, academic institutions, and reputed professional networks, Poland is still valuing some of
the WBG knowledge services. The challenge for the WBG is to identify those areas, where it
can best contribute to policy-making, and add value to the services otherwise available from
private consultants or from other partners, especially the EC (Box 1).

Box 1:The WBG's comparative advantage

The WBG's comparative advantage varies across sectors but typically includes:

-

-

-

-

The ability to provide independent, neutral advice from a perspective of technical expertise - which is
helpful in advancing the debate in some of the politically difficult areas (e.g., on pensions reform);

The ability to bring to the fore "development solutions", i.e. a combination of knowledge and
operational experience to translate such knowledge into action, in a broad range of technical areas
(e.g. on the design of enhanced business regulations);
A strong commitment to result, i.e. an engagement that is not limited to a contractual relationship, but
consists of a true partnership aimed at providing support until the effective adoption or implementation
of reforms (e.g., on strengthening the analytical basis for moving towards a low-carbon economy);

The combination of global experience (which is of particular interest to the Polish authorities, who are
often keen on learning from other countries, both European and non-European) and local knowledge
and the ability to tailor global solutions to local circumstances (e.g., to inform the design of a modem
bank resolution framework); and

-

A focus on poverty reduction and shared prosperity, which provides the set of "values" that underpin
the partnership (e.g., support to local NGOs promoting social inclusion).

* The Bank's approach needs to reflect its position as a relatively small player. Throughout

the CPS period, Poland received large amounts of EU funds (in the form of grants) and
substantial financing from EIB (in the form of subsidized loans). WBG financing during the
CPS period of USD 6 billion represented only a fraction of EU structural and cohesion funds
available for Poland in the current EU financial perspective (2007-2013), which amounted to
EUR 68.7 billion. This implies that the WBG needs not only to coordinate with other actors
and to identify "niches" and focus areas but also to fully align its program to the EU strategy.
For the WBG to be relevant, it needs to be seen as helping Poland shape some of its positions
or instruments to best influence the EU debate, or as supporting the implementation of
commitments Poland made as an EU member. This is a challenging role for the WBG, where
its influence results from engagement on the design or implementation of specific measures,

51

rather than from helping the country to define a broad development strategy. Experience during
the CPS period suggests however that this is an important and useful role.

* Key to success are selectivity, flexibility, quality, and timeliness. These are well known
factors of success in any development context, but they apply somewhat differently 
in
a country like Poland.

o Selectivity. The WBG has been most successful when: (i) it positioned itself in technical
"niches", where it could bring expertise that would not be easily available otherwise
(e.g., on climate change modeling); (ii) it nurtured a debate by providing facts, figures, and
analyses that helped stakeholders 
to reflect on some strategic or medium-term issues
(e.g., analysis of spending in social sectors under a Public Expenditure Review); (iii) it
provided an independent advice to a difficult set of reforms (e.g., in the health sector);
(iv) it provided the technical anchor around which other financiers could be mobilized
(e.g., on flood protection); or (v) it raised the profile of selected issues that would otherwise
not be central to the domestic debate (e.g., on the gender impact of pension reform).
o Flexibility. It is clear that to be relevant the WBG has to continuously adjust to an evolving
demand. In this context, the new CPS should not aim to provide an exhaustive list of
activities to be undertaken during the implementation period, but rather an overall strategic
framework and a set of specific selectivity criteria to help prioritize areas for engagement.

o Quality and timeliness. It is worth noting that the WBG has been consistently able to
mobilize the type of expertise that is needed to provide relevant advice in a sophisticated
economy - though this has often been testing (or even stretching) the limits of the WBG's
internal organization for the delivery of knowledge services.

* Lending continues to play an important role in the delivery of knowledge services, in addition
to targeted analytical and advisory services. Throughout the CPS implementation period, the
WBG effectively used stand-alone knowledge services to make a contribution to policymaking
in a number of areas. Yet, lending, and especially the successive DPL series, also played
a major role in advancing the policy dialogue, especially in some of the most difficult areas.
Overall, it is the combination of (well-articulated) lending and analytical and advisory activities
that can provide for the most effective way to engage. The CPS experience highlights that
lending in a context like Poland ought to be focused on areas where the WBG can best
contribute to the advancement of specific reforms (see Box 2). Lending should also limited to
those areas where an equivalent result cannot be achieved through analytical or advisory
services (in an environment where WBG resources are small compared to those available from
other financiers), i.e. in areas where a hands-on Bank involvement in implementation is critical
for success.

* Knowledge activities in support of a demanding and sophisticated client have a public good
aspect and constitute the basis for a mutually beneficial partnership. The relationship with
Poland is such that a number of knowledge products have been the subject of an intense back-
and-forth process of comments and adjustments between the Government and the WBG. This
has made it possible to develop high-quality products that went even beyond what was initially
contemplated, for examples in some of the education policy notes or in the CEM on low-
carbon economy. In turn, these products can provide a solid foundation for engagement in
other countries, 
in 
the ECA Region and beyond, where 
the 
findings and overall
recommendations developed for Poland can constitute a reference or a benchmark for similar
work. In parallel, some of the lessons learned by Poland through its successful transition

52

experience can usefully be applied in other countries, once again in ECA and beyond. In this
context, the WBG can substantially benefit from its knowledge partnership with Poland.

Box 2: Areas of focus for WBG financial support
WBG lending should focus on areas where it can best contribute to the advancement of specific reforms,
i.e. by:
Serving a demonstrable signaling function for outside stakeholders (financial markets, labor unions,
users associations, etc), by providing an endorsement of a specific reform or of the Government
response to deteriorated external circumstances (e.g., through the DPL series);

-

-

Facilitating significant additional resource mobilization, in particular EU funds and other IFIs

(e.g through the Odra River Basin Flood Protection Project);

Creating a lasting impact on institutional capacity in the country.

-
The rationale for the WBG to be involved in more traditional investment projects (e.g., Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Projects) has now faded.

37. The second set of lessons pertains to the approaches the Bank can take to best deliver
such services

* Trust is the key. In a country like Poland, the relationship with the WBG is a partnership of
choice, and it is up to the WBG to demonstrate it can add value and contribute to the country's
development. The quasi-complete absence of an investment portfolio also implies that there are
no "structured relationships" between the Government and the Bank, where a technical
dialogue is nurtured by daily interactions on implementation issues. Instead, throughout the
CPS period, the challenge for the WBG was to generate interest, and a demand, for each
knowledge product, before actually delivering it. To that effect, the WBG benefits from a solid
reputation of technical expertise and a positive image in the public opinion. Yet, to capitalize
on such reputational assets, the WBG ought to establish and nurture a series of trust-based
relationship with key counterparts, at the central and sectoral levels, and at the national and
subnational levels.

* In most technical areas, the Bank needs to manage a dialogue rather than
deliverables. Throughout the CPS period, influence came from the day-to-day dialogue
with counterparts. This is especially true in those areas where the WBG did not provide
financing. In such areas, performance varied significantly across sectors. The traditional
focus on deliverables (specific, pre-agreed outputs financed through a technical assistance
code) often yielded somewhat disappointing results (in terms of outcomes). The WBG was
far more successful (e.g., in the case of reforms aimed at enhancing 
the business
environment) when it focused on establishing and managing a dialogue, providing formal
or informal contributions on an ad hoc basis (and in a very rapid manner) with a focus on
influencing the decision-making process 
in real time and with clear accountability
mechanisms. This suggests a need to shift from a "task-focused" to a "dialogue-focused"
engagement, which has an impact on both decentralization and quality control processes.

A focus on knowledge presents a conceptual challenge for developing a results matrix, as
those will often be intermediate outcomes in a longer results chain. A knowledge activity in
Poland may help develop the capacity for improved service delivery in an area, but the WBG
may not be involved in the delivery of the service itself and as such it will have only an indirect

53

effect on the final beneficiary (or the consumer of the service). Furthermore, the WBG is
a relatively small partner in a country like Poland, which raises difficult attribution issues in
a number of areas. The design of CPS objectives and outcomes has to take this into account.

In the context of a solid sectoral
dialogue, technical assistance
focused on a just-in-time response
to a series of ad hoc client requests
proved to be an effective way for
the WBG to contribute to policy
reforms.

* Because of the sophistication
of the sectoral dialogue, some of the
knowledge products developed
in cooperation with the Polish
authorities have become references
that can be used in the dialogue with
other client countries.

Program performance illustrates the
need for complementary
interventions at central and
subnational levels. During the first
phase of the CPS implementation,
the dialogue focused on national
authorities. When a new health law,
supported by the DPL, increased the
responsibilities and obligations of
regional governments, the WBG
shifted the dialogue towards the
regions, with a view to enhance
their capacity and help them fulfill

find the right balance between
national interventions, essentially
focused on broad policy reforms,
and a sub-national engagement
aimed at the operational and
implementation aspects of reforms.

In a decentralized country like
Poland, engagement with sub-
national governments is important
for the WBG to achieve its goals.
The CPS period saw the
development of a substantive
dialogue with sub-national
governments and a confirmation
of the demand for WBG knowledge
services by these authorities.

While the WBG substantially
contributed to policy development
at the sub-national level through
technical assistance, it faced
major impediments in supporting
policy dialogue financially. Planned
lending operations, directly to sub-
national entities and through a
financial intermediary did not
materialize due to constraints in
providing guarantee to non-

sovereign borrowers.
Yet, the engagement and transaction
costs of WBG cooperation with sub-
national governments proved to be
high while the capacity to absorb
Bank's advice remains limited in
some cases. Selectivity is hence
critical: the WBG should focus on a

few strategic areas with a clear
operational focus, and seek
opportunities for replication across
regions.

The WBG's responsiveness and
flexibility in meeting Poland's
changing needs has helped the
Government to mitigate the impact

of the crisis. IBRD lending also
helped strengthen Poland's position
during the crisis by: (i) informing

the detailed design of critical policy
reforms through the provision of
targeted technical assistance; and
(ii) sending a positive signal to

financial markets through financial

support to a solid package of
reforms.

3. Help Government to achieve 
its fiscal deficit target of "close 
to" 3 percent of GDP in 2012 
through strengthening its fiscal 
responsibility framework 
(indicator: introduction of 
permanent fiscal rule for the
Central Government).

2. Achieved 
Prioritization of expenditures has improved and 
greater control over public financed has been 
introduced through, among others, implementation 

of a temporary fiscal rule (CPI+ 1). Poland is expected 

to exit the European Union Excessive Deficit 
Procedure in 2014 as the general government deficit is 
projected to decline to around 2.7 % of GDP. 

3. Partially achieved 
Fiscal deficit has been reduced from close to 8 percent
in 2010 to 5.1 percent in 2011 and 3.4 percent in
2012. Temporary fiscal rule (CPI+1) has been
introduced. Permanent fiscal rule is under
development.

1. Partially achieved 
A Land Transport Policy Note was developed 
in parallel with the preparation by the Government 
of the Transport Sector Strategy for Poland (2013- 
2020). The Policy Note contributed to the discussions 
with Polish authorities and provided strategic 
considerations for transport sector development 
in Poland.

Rehabilitation loans (RMRI and RMR2) 
(FY10)

Loan RMR3 (FY12).

Measuring the actual contribution
of the WBG is challenging
in a sector where the program is
dwarfed by support from other
financiers, such as the EU and BIB.

9 In this context, to achieve impact,
the Bank must align its program
with other donors' agenda and
focus on providing complementary
support in areas of strategic
importance.

1. Contribution to the strategy 
for transport sector 
development (including climate 
change agenda and medium 
long-term financing).

4. Partially achieved 
The legal framework for private sector involvement 
in infrastructure development has improved, with
the adoption and effective application of legislation
on land acquisition for infrastructure investments
(2008), concessions in construction and services);
public private partnership (2009); and electronic toll
collection systems on roads (2009, with ETC system
actually introduced in 2011).

* The time to register property was reduced from 
197 days in 2008 (DB 2009) to 54 days in 2012 (DB 
2013) thanks to a full digitization of real estate 
records. 
9 The timne to close a business indicator is no longer

2. Partially achieved 

9 Spending on R&D increased to 0.77% of GDP 
in 2011, driven by increased EU funding. Spending 
on business R&D improved only marginally to 0.21% 
of GDP in 2011. 
9 Patent applications submitted to the European 
Patent Office increased from 231 in 2008 to 308 
in the latest year available, 2010 (8 patents per million 
inhabitants), but remained well below the EU27 
average at 108.6 patents per million inhabitants, 

1. Regulatory reforms 
facilitating business start-up, 
operations and licensing, 
and other business-to- 
government requirements 
(taxes, closures, trade), have 
been made showing a reduction 
in time, cost and transactional 
steps. Indicators: 
0 cost of obtaining business 
licenses reduced by at least 
20% from current levels 
(currently 122% ofper capita 
income), and time to register 
property and close a business 
reduced by 20% to z120 days 
and below 2.5 years, 
respectively, by 2012. 

2. Programs to promote 
business innovation made more 
effective via further R&D 
resource allocations to such 
programs as measured by an 
increase in public R&D to GDP 
ratio from 0.68%; R&D for 
business/GDP: 0.19% (2009); 
and orienting these towards 
commercialization ofproducts 
in several sectors (indicator: 
patent applications submitted to 
US patent office increased from 
8.91 per million 
inhabitants (2009)), as well as 
increasing R&D institute 
linkages with the business 
community. 

9 Given the sophistication
of counterparts, the Bank's
comparative advantage lies
in providing high quality advisory
work, including by drawing
on lessons from global benchmarks
and developed countries - and
in proving an independent and
objective perspective that can help
inform the national debate. A large
part of the advisory services were
delivered in a programmatic
mauner, with a focus on
a continuous dialogue rather than
individual output deliveries, which
proved very effective.
Promoting reforms in an area with
entrenched vested interests
is inherently difficult. Yet, the
combination of solid analytical
work ("putting facts in the open")
and a trust-based relationship with
some of the critical stakeholders
makes it possible to spur
a domestic debate that is the pre-
condition for change. Further
developing the partnership with
both Polish authorities and the
European Commission is key
to move from ideas to action.
9 The decentralization model used
by the WBG team with a dialogue
managed from the field and back-
up technical support provided from
headquarters when / as needed
proved to be an effective way
to deliver results

9 This is an area where the WBG has
carried out analytical work which
became a good example and
reference for other countries
to address their climate change
needs: the CEM on Poland's
Transition to Low-Emissions
Economy, which reflected
a sophisticated dialogue with
counterparts, has provided a
foundation for strengthening
the sectoral dialogue not only
with Poland, but also with other
countries in the ECA Region and
beyond. Similarly, the ongoing
Economic Modeling for Climate
Policy technical assistance is likely
to have an impact that goes far
beyond Polish borders through
a replication process.

The work in this area of flood
protection highlights the WBG's
convening role. The WBG's
technical leadership of the Odra
Project, for both preparation and
implementation support, provided
the anchor for a team of financiers
(together with the EC, Council
of Europe Bank). On the ground,
the WBG's involvement was key
to foster an effective cooperation
between a number of local and
sectoral institutions (each in charge
of a separate aspect of the flood

protection system) and integrate
