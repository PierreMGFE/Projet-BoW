EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Guinea has made considerable progress in stabilizing over the past two years.  Emerging from 
political isolation, instability and military rule, Guinea adopted a new constitution, elected a President, 
and fully re-integrated into the international community. A reform of the security sector was vigorously 
engaged. Macro-economic stability was restored, and debt sustainability dramatically improved with the 
attainment of the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point in September 2012. 
Social, institutional and economic decline which had been ongoing for years was halted. In May 2013, the 
government endorsed a third poverty reduction strategy for the period 2013-15 around four main 
priorities: (i) governance and public sector reform; (ii) growth and economic diversification; (iii) service 
delivery; and (iv) reducing regional disparities through local development and decentralization.   

Building on its vast endowment of natural resources, Guinea has now embarked on a path of long 
term development. Yet, if protracted, poor governance and political instability will continue to 
hinder prospects to reduce poverty and achieve shared prosperity.  A legacy of political instability, 
insecurity and pervasive poor governance prevents harvesting the benefits of Guinea’s natural wealth for 
the vast majority living in extreme poverty. “Shared prosperity”, for Guineans, primarily means the 
equitable distribution of the mineral rents. Guinea’s natural endowments, mineral resources, land, sun and 
water, are immense, but were not made available for poverty reduction. In the last decade, per capita 
incomes hardly grew, poverty rose sharply in recent years and the country’s mediocre economic and 
social performance exemplifies the paradox of plenty.  

The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY14-17 will support Guinea to 
implement a long-term development agenda of reducing extreme poverty and enhancing shared 
prosperity.  It addresses poverty reduction and shared prosperity by supporting improved governance 
systems, fostering accelerated, equitable and diversified growth in Guinea and accompanying 
improvements in human capital. Building on a World Bank Fragility Assessment and on the Interim 
Strategy Note (ISN, 2011-12) which focused on human development and service delivery through 
decentralization, this CPS will help the country address long-term challenges of building a credible 
governance system to enable private sector investments, ensuring the transparent management of mineral 
resources, strengthening the efficiency of the energy and agriculture sectors and improving the human 
capital. A strong focus on governance, including transparency, public expenditure and investment 
management, and efficiency of key sectors, is intended to build the foundations for shared benefits and 
prosperity from mineral wealth governance. At the same time, with strong involvement from IFC and 
MIGA, the CPS aims to accompany the authorities’ increased efforts to lifting binding constraints to 
inclusive and private sector-led economic growth, focusing in particular on ensuring sustainability of 
energy services and developing modern agriculture. The Bank will continue to be a key partner in 
building systems to improve lagging human development indicators for absolute poverty reduction, 
through more efficient and transparent allocation of resources, and to build shared prosperity by aligning 
the business environment and education system with Guinea’s economy.  

Regional synergies are critical to unlock Guinea’s growth constraints.  Guinea has the opportunity to 
use its strategic position, access and resources to become an important player in West Africa, and to use 
its potential to benefit all Guineans.  Furthermore, a coordinated regional approach will enhance the Bank 
Group’s leveraging capacity with private and public partners and regional organizations to enable Guinea 
develop growth corridors, exploit its hydropower potential, and become an important player in power 
generation in the sub-region. This ambitious approach requires tailored government infrastructure 
investment plans, a productive dialogue with private sector partners and a strong commitment to the 
regional agenda. 

The Bank Group will tackle governance challenges and further leverage partnerships with the 
public and private sector.  Effective and efficient use of financial resources has been a binding 

1 

 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

constraint to progress in Guinea. The Bank Group’s focus on governance will contribute to expand 
domestic fiscal space and higher availability of donor resources in support of development programs. 
Uncertainties still surrounding Guinea’s political and economic environment warrant a flexible approach. 
A limited number of projects is therefore envisaged in the first years of the CPS, and the Progress Report 
on the CPS will offer the opportunity to fine-tune the CPS in its remaining years. The mix of instruments 
will be based on progress recorded in the first years of implementation, as well as on the lessons from 
ongoing projects. The upcoming closing of several operations provides the Bank with the opportunity to 
significantly renew its portfolio of projects, and exercise strategic selectivity.

INTRODUCTION 

I. 
1. 
The Bank Group’s engagement builds on an Interim Strategy Note prepared in 2008 and a 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which expired in 2006 in a context of a deteriorating political 
and social climate.  During the previous CAS period, the economic landscape of Guinea worsened, 
economic growth slowed and the incidence of poverty grew from 49 percent in 2003 to 53 percent in 
2007. A military coup in 2008 led to a suspension of Bank operations for nearly three years. The 
combined effects of regional insecurity, low international prices for Guinea’s main commodities, and 
political and social turbulence catapulted Guinea into a state of fragility comparable to that of post-
conflict countries. 

2. 
While continued political instability was the main obstacle to growth, other issues also 
contributed.  The absence of infrastructure investment isolated large segments of the population, 
contributing to gender inequality as traditional cultural practices became more entrenched. In addition, an 
extremely difficult business climate prevented the development of a competitive private sector. The 
expansion of the mining sector also possibly led elites to compete for rents, rather than develop the 
economy and institutions, thus further fueling instability. 

3. 
The adoption of a new Constitution in April 2010 marked the beginning of a new era for 
Guinea.  The new constitution allowed the return to civilian rule through elections, and the reform of the 
security sector. Presidential elections were successfully organized in 2010, and the suspension of aid was 
lifted as the newly elected Government was recognized by the international community. In September 
2012, Guinea achieved the highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) completion point.  

4. 
The Third National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP3) approved by the 
Government in May 2013, aims to accelerate economic growth and progress toward the MDGs.  
The strategic vision of the PRSP3 is to use Guinea’s large mining rents to alleviate poverty and develop a 
competitive, employment-generating private sector. Stronger governance and transparency in the mining 
sector, reinforced by external anchors such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and 
“Publish What You Pay”, aims to ensure that the mining sector fairly and openly contributes to fiscal 
revenues. A massive public investment program that prioritizes energy, transport and agriculture is 
envisaged to increase productive private employment and reduce spatial inequalities, while programs for 
education and health are targeted to benefit the poor. Continued monitoring and evaluation will inform 
policies and projects and help strengthen the re-established democratic institutions. Mitigating the risks of 
a mining economy is even more difficult in the context of Guinea’s political economy and the challenges 
posed by regional insecurity, drug trafficking, gender imbalances and climate change.  

5. 
Following the democratic elections of 2010, the international donor community converged 
to support the newly elected Government of Guinea.  In addition to the Bretton Woods institutions, the 
main development partners contributing substantially in financial support to the country are the African 
Development Bank, the European Commission, the Islamic Development Bank, and Agence Française de 
Développement. However, on specific issues other institutions and partners are crucial. The United 
Nations (UN) coordinates the interventions in the area of security reform, with contributions from 
bilateral aid, as well as from ECOWAS and the African Union. USAID plays a crucial role in establishing 
democratic institutions, complementing the work of the EU. The EU has led the work on support for the 
justice sector. Non-traditional development partners, including Arab countries, China, Brazil, Russia and 
India, have focused on areas closely linked to Guinea’s comparative advantage such as mining and 
agriculture, or where public private partnerships could yield rapid transfer to purely private activities.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 
A. Political and Institutional Context 
6. 
Guinea is only gradually emerging from political isolation and instability, but tensions 
remain. Upon opting for independence, officially declared on the 2nd of October of 1958, Guinea almost 
immediately broke all ties with the French administration, but then lived under a succession of autocratic 
regimes, civilian or military. After a first long period of central planning, a new regime started a broad 
range of market oriented reforms in the late 1980s. Following initial stabilization gains (until mid-90s), 
macroeconomic performance weakened, structural reforms were halted – as confronting solid vested 
interests, and the repression of civil and political liberties, combined with widespread corruption, resulted 
in disastrous development outcomes and frequent urban social unrest. In late 2008, a military junta seized 
power with a coup, which prompted the international community to stop formal relationship with (and 
suspend aid to) Guinea. In 2009, the deadly repression of a mass opposition rally prompted the United 
Nations to investigate responsibilities with threats of prosecution through the international criminal court. 
Growing tension within the junta eventually led to its implosion and acceptance to renounce power in 
favor of civilians, against the promise of security services reform, as per the Ouagadougou Accord of 
January 15, 2010.  
7. 
A transition process (led by the National Transition Council) with support from the 
Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU) and the 
international community, was organized and led to the successful election and investiture, through 
a fair and transparent process, of President Condé in December 2010.  Yet, the parliamentary and 
local elections planned to be held shortly thereafter have since been repeatedly postponed, and in lieu of 
an elected parliament, a National Transition Council (CNT) composed of 155 persons handpicked from 
the Guinean society, serves as legislative body. The repeated delays and the surrounding negative political 
debate, which centered largely on ethnic division, continue to pose a serious challenge to the country’s 
transition to a stable democracy. The elections are currently planned for September 2013. 

B. Economic Context 
8. 
Since 2011, the authorities promoted a macroeconomic stabilization program. Elected 
authorities inherited a precarious macroeconomic situation, characterized by rampant inflation, negative 
per capita economic growth, high deficits and arrears, and a highly unsustainable indebtedness situation. 
The Government responded by immediately suspending reliance on central bank financing and froze most 
investment contracts initiated by the military junta. An Extended Credit Facility program was signed with 
the IMF and Guinea received budget support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank. 
Arrears to external creditors were cleared and, in September 2012, Guinea reached the HIPC completion 
point, twelve years after having reached the decision point. US$2.1 billion worth of external debt (in net 
present value terms) vis-à-vis multilateral and bilateral creditors was written off, equivalent to annual 
savings of US$115 million in debt service for the next 20 years. External investors, mostly attracted by 
mineral resources, started to come back; economic growth rebounded and became positive in per capita 
terms, and inflation decelerated. 

9. 
While necessary, macro-economic stability will nonetheless be largely insufficient to make a 
significant dent on poverty. During the last ten years, per capita GDP grew annually by 0.4 percent on 
average. Excluding the revenues of the mining sector (shared between foreign investors and the 
government), per capita incomes are believed to have stagnated in the last decade, or even decreased, as 
per capita private consumption decreased over the same period. Guinea’s economic growth has 
increasingly become dependent on resource extraction, and the computation of adjusted net savings 
suggests that Guinea’s wealth has been decreasing by the equivalent of more than 20 percent of GNI (that 

4 

 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

is, US$1billion in 2012) every year since 2007. This indicates that investments have been greatly 
insufficient to offset mineral rents dissipation in Guinea. Private investments (including residential 
investments and maintenance) averaged only 15 percent of GDP between 2007 and 2012, and dropped to 
a low of 5 percent in 2010 when foreign investors in the mining sector fled the country, frustrated by 
frequent changes in the terms of contracts. Public investment averaged 5 percent of GDP over the same 
period, and its effectiveness was highly questionable -- in particular before 2011 when performance audits 
revealed ex-post that most ongoing investment programs did not comply with procurement rules and 
procedures. The deterioration of the investment climate is reflected in the evolution of the Country Policy 
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings between 2007 and 2012, which saw a strong decline in the 
sub-ratings (ranging from 1 to 6, worst from best) concerning the business regulatory environment (from 
3.0 in 2007 to 2.5 in 2012) and transparency and accountability (from 2.5 in 2007 to 2.0 in 2012).

10. 
Guinea’s large natural resource rents will continue to create pressures from elites and 
groups that aim to monopolize political and economic institutions in order to capture these rents. 
The country is among the world’s largest bauxite producers and has rich reserves of gold, iron ore and 
diamonds. Guinea is currently a candidate country under the EITI and has started implementing the 
principles of the initiative but has not yet met all the requirements. Given the significance of mining as a 
potential driver of growth, or fragility, enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of natural resource 
management could generate valuable resources and increase trust in, and legitimacy of, state institutions.  

11. 
The main engine of growth in Guinea is the mineral sector, which in itself creates 
substantial risks. The extractive industry does not create many direct jobs, and can lead to increased 
income inequality. Secondly, strong investment and policies from the government are a condition to 
diversify the economy. Thirdly, the sector increases governance risks and the potential for corruption. 
There is a strong risk that Guinea’s economy, very natural-resource rich, could become subject to the 
“resource curse”. Such undesirable development can be avoided by increased investment in roads and 
energy that will allow for diversification through inclusive private sector development and improved 
agricultural productivity; measures to increase institutional capacities to manage government resources 
transparently and efficiently; and the development of human capital. 

12. 
Estimates based on different poverty surveys suggest that accelerated, inclusive growth 
could have had a significant impact on poverty reduction.  Growth could have a significant impact on 
poverty reduction in Guinea: current low level of inequality and the computation of the poverty elasticity 
between 1995 and 2012 suggest that one percentage point growth in per capita private consumption could 
result in one percentage point reduction in the poverty rate, should growth be equitably distributed across 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

households. In recent years, however, slow economic growth and the mismanagement of mineral rents 
prevented a significant reduction in poverty. 

13. Mineral rents should be used primarily to support this investment program, but remain 
volatile. Guinea’s mining sector accounts for over a quarter of the country’s GDP and around 80 percent 
of its export earnings. In the forthcoming years, investments in the mining sector are projected to double, 
and mining revenues could significantly support the public investment program and the necessary 
diversification of the economy which could lead to shared prosperity. However, such a strategy bears 
important risks. On the one hand, possible delays in project implementation (with political instability and 
difficulties to develop and protect stable and open contracts between the Government and miners), and 
volatile world prices make revenue forecasts uncertain and call for continued prudent macro-economic 
policies. On the other hand, efforts need to be accelerated to (i) improve the business environment for 
prospective investors, and (ii) convert revenues into effective and cost-efficient public investments in 
infrastructure and human development. This puts programs to improve mineral governance and public 
financial and investment management at the center stage of the Government strategy. In addition, for 
small investors, a number of services need to be supplied to improve the regulatory business environment. 
Recent progress recorded in the 2013 Doing Business indicators are first steps for investors to secure land 
rights, access finance, simplify registration, and strengthen forward and backward linkages with the 
mining sector. 
C. Poverty and Gender Profiles 
Poverty 

14. With elusive and volatile growth, the poverty rate increased from 53 percent in 2007 to 55 
percent in 2012. Declining average per capita consumption contributed to the increase in poverty, but a 
mild reduction of inequality, notably in rural areas, somewhat contained the overall increase in poverty 
(see Box 1). Rural – urban migrations, and the sharp increase in food prices explain why rural areas fared 
better than urban areas in terms of poverty reduction, even if poverty rates remain higher in rural areas 
(65 percent of population in 2012) than in urban areas (35 percent of population in 2012). Meanwhile, 
extreme poverty (inability to satisfy basic food needs) increased from 12.2 percent to 18.0 percent. 

15. 
The incidence of poverty significantly varies across regions. For example, 67 and 65 percent 
of the population living in Nzerekore (Forest Region) and in Labe (Middle-Guinea), respectively, live 
below the poverty line, while in Conakry (Lower-Guinea) the poverty rate stands at 27 percent. Only, 
Kankan (Upper-Guinea) saw its poverty rate reduced between 2007 and 2012, from 59 to 49 percent of 
the population. While average income is higher in Conakry, and poverty levels lower, inequalities (as 
measured by the Gini coefficient) are particularly wide, compared to Guinea’s other regions, see Box 1. 

16. 
The most important determinants of poverty are location, gender and education of the head 
of household. Given the high regional disparities and rural-urban divide, geographic location is the 
primary determinant of poverty in Guinea. Male-headed households are poorer than their female 
counterparts. Concerning education, the level of education of the household head is a determinant of 
poverty of all household members. For example, the incidence of poverty in households where the head 
has not been to school at all is 2.5 times higher than that of a household headed by a university graduate.

Box 1: The data comparability and characteristics of poverty in Guinea 

There have been four household surveys implemented in Guinea since 1994. The two first surveys are Living 
Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) and the last two are Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire Surveys 
(CWIQ). Consumption aggregates, used to compute poverty and inequality indicators, from these two types of 
surveys are not, strictly speaking, comparable. This is due to significant differences in questionnaire design and 
sampling method. Significant efforts have been made to make these four surveys comparable but questions linger. 
For example, the Gini coefficients for the two CWIQ surveys are drastically lower than that of LSMS surveys, a 
hallmark of incomparability of different questionnaires. With this caveat in mind, we present the poverty trend 
below between 1994 and 2012. It should be noted that the poverty trend between the same types of surveys should 
be robust (in this case, the comparison between 1994 and 2003, and between 2007 and 2012 are robust).    

The increase in poverty is due to both the economic downturn and the increase in urban poverty. Between 1995 
and 2012, the incidence of poverty in urban areas has doubled. The evolution of poverty in Conakry is similar to 
the evolution of overall urban poverty, with a poverty rate that has almost tripled over the period. Despite the sharp 
increase in urban areas, poverty in Guinea remains a rural phenomenon.  

Inequality, measured by the Gini, Atkinson and Theil indexes, appears to have stagnated at the national level since 
2007, following a strong decline since 1995. Overall stability of inequality in Guinea during the years 2007-2012 
can be understood by the distribution of consumption. In 2007, 30 percent of people living in the poorest 
households represented 13.8 percent of consumption expenditures, while 30 percent living in the richest 
households represented 51.5 percent of consumer spending. These ratios were 13.9 per percent and 52 percent for 
the two respective categories in 2012.  

Poverty is also affected by gender, age and level of education. Controlling for other factors (education, age, family 
size, etc.), the poverty rate among households headed by men was more than 6 percentage points higher than the 
rate among those headed by women in 2012. However, households headed by women are worse off in absolute 
terms. The difference in per capita expenditure is about 20 percent, to the disadvantage of the women. The results 
of the 2012 ELEP show that poverty increases with the age of the household head. The incidence of poverty is 
lower in households where the head of the household is less than 30 years of age. It increases from 30 years up to 
the age group 40-49 years and remains constant until an advanced age. Poverty decreases with higher levels of 
education of the household head, with a more substantial effect in reducing poverty from upper secondary level 
onwards. The level of education of the spouse is also positively correlated with the well-being of the household 
from the secondary level education onwards.

Box 2: Guinea – Gender Policy 

17. 
Guinea does not yet have an explicit 
social protection policy. As discussed above, 
Guinea is characterized by a high prevalence of 
poverty and high vulnerability to shocks. Food 
insecurity is widespread and varies significantly 
across regions. The proportion of food insecure 
rural households reached 32 percent in 2009, 
affecting about 2.3 million people. As many as 
one half of the households belonging to the 
poorest quintile are considered chronically food 
insecure. Most of the urban population remains 
highly vulnerable to price fluctuations of basic 
commodities. Existing safety nets mechanisms 
are inadequate. Furthermore, the current limited 
interventions are scattered among several 
institutions with very little or no coordination. 
Financing is small and largely funded by donors 
on an ad-hoc basis. Most existing efforts are in 
the form of assistance coming from NGOs and 
religious organizations, at times with support 
from other development partners. As a result, 
the vast majority of the population continues to 
be fully exposed to economic shocks and risks 
related to life events. They rely either on informal solidarity networks, which are ineffective in reducing 
poverty and tend to collapse during large-scale and generalized shocks.  

The Government of Guinea recognizes that in order to 
meet its development challenges it is critical that both 
women and men are able to contribute to and benefit from 
economic and social development. The Government’s latest 
PRSP has a separate section on the promotion of gender 
equality and also mainstreams gender throughout much of the 
rest of the document. Attention to gender issues is particularly 
visible with regard to the following areas: education, social 
protection, health (including reproductive health and women’s 
vulnerability 
to HIV/AIDS), and women’s agricultural 
productivity/contribution to household food security. The 
PRSP sets out its commitment to gender issues, stating that 
“the promotion of women with a view toward full participation 
in decision-making processes at all levels is an integral part of 
the government’s development policy and one of its priority 
areas”. The Government’s commitment to gender is also 
demonstrated with its publication of a national gender strategy 
(GoG, 2011), and a national strategy against gender-based 
violence (GoG, 2010). 

Gender 1 

18. 
 Considerable challenges remain for 
Guinean women with regard to the key areas 
of the World Development Report 2012. In 
education, between 2003 and 2009, the adult 
literacy rate improved from 29 percent to 39 
percent. While female literacy is lower than 
male literacy (28 percent versus 51 percent), 
there has been some progress with the ratio of 
female to male literacy rates increasing from 
0.42 in 2003 to 0.55 in 2009. Significant 
absolute and gender-equality related gains have 
been made in primary education over the past 
decade. Between 1999 and 2010, the net 
primary enrollment rate increased from 43 
percent to 77 percent. Over the same period the

ratio of female to male enrollment rates increased from 0.64 to 0.84.  While some progress has been made 
with enrollment rates, overall performance and gender-equality related performance are noticeably poorer 
at the secondary level. Access to tertiary education has expanded considerably over recent years and there 
have been notable gains in gender equality in the sector, though from a very low base. The overall 
enrollment rate for tertiary education went from just 2 percent in 2003 to 9 percent in 2008. While female 
enrollment is still lower than male enrollment (4.7 percent against 14.1 percent), the expansion in tertiary 
enrollment since 2003 has seen a greater relative increase in female versus male enrollment, with the ratio 
of female to male enrollment rates increasing from 0.19 to 0.33. Women are also underrepresented as 
teachers, making up only 5.8 percent of teachers in higher education and only 3.6 percent of doctoral level 
teachers (MAS, 2011).

19. While women’s health indicators have improved on a number of fronts (including access to 
health facilities, maternal mortality, access to 
Figure 3: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled 
water), significant challenges remain. The 
estimate, per 100,000 live births) (WDI data) 
maternal mortality rate was at 800 in 2005. This 
is high compared to the average for all African 
countries of around 500. A consistent decline 
needs to take place for the country to achieve its 
MDG target of 300 deaths per 100,000 live births 
by 2015 (World Bank, 2011). The total fertility 
rate (TFR) in Guinea is high, though it did 
decline from 6 in 2000 to 5.2 in 2011. This is still 
high compared to the average for all of Africa of 
around 4.5, and it compares favorably with many 
of Guinea’s regional neighbors, such as Niger 
(7.1), Mali (6.3), Chad (6.0), and Burkina Faso 
(5.9). Data from the 2005 DHS (ORC Macro, 
2006) suggest that there were large differences between women in different wealth quintiles, with poorer 
women having higher TFRs. Access to water has improved in recent years, but is still a significant issue 
with regard to women’s health and time poverty, especially in rural areas. Progress on access to sanitation 
facilities has been much slower. In 2008, 71 percent of the population had access to an improved water 
source. This is approximately equal to the average level of access for all African countries and represents 
a moderate improvement from a level of 62 percent in 2000. However, the figure for 2008 masks a large 
variation between access in rural areas (61 percent) and urban areas (89 percent). In rural areas, women 
often have to walk long distances to collect water, and rural populations often resort to using rain water 
and water from wells which can have negative health impacts (MAS, 2011).

20. Women in Guinea appear to be more economically engaged than in many other countries in 
Africa, yet they still have fewer opportunities than their male counterparts to contribute to and 
benefit from productive participation in the workforce. Gender differences in labor force participation 
are not as wide in Guinea as they are in many other African countries, yet there is still a moderate gender 
gap. Women’s labor force participation rate was 79 percent in 2009, compared to a rate of 89 percent for 
men. This translates into a ratio of female to male labor force participation rate of 0.89, which has 
remained essentially unchanged over the past decade. Those women who are economically active are 
more likely to work in the informal sector and less likely to be wage employees than men.  They are less 
likely to occupy senior and skilled positions, earn less income, and are less likely to have sufficient access 
to various inputs with which to improve their productivity. The reasons for women’s lower economic 
opportunities are numerous and may include greater time poverty due to their domestic responsibilities, 
lower levels of education, and cultural biases which accord a lower social standing to women.

III. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 
A. Overcoming Fragility and Laying the Foundation for Long-term Stability 
21. 
The underlying drivers of fragility (Annex 8: Addressing Fragility across World Bank Portfolio 
in Guinea) need to be addressed and present-day contributing factors resolved, in order to build a 
foundation for sustainable development and to secure developmental progress. Development gains 
will be at risk if the drivers of fragility are not addressed as an integral part of the country’s development 
program. These include intergenerational cleavages, youth exclusion and unemployment, breakdown in 
relations between civil society and the state, inter-ethnic tensions and the mismanagement of public 
expectations. Further, the present breakdown in political dialogue over the electoral process threatens 
stability. Sustainable development and economic growth cannot be achieved in a context where security is 
not guaranteed. This has been clearly demonstrated throughout Guinea’s history, most recently during the 
period 2008-2010, which saw heightened levels of insecurity, and political and social unrest. Rule of law 
in Guinea is limited, as personal, property, and contractual rights are not universally protected.  

22. 
Governance indicators reflect Guinea’s fragility. Governance indicators have slightly 
improved in recent years compared to the period of extreme institutional instability prior to 2010. In 
absolute terms, however, Guinea’s scores remain low. The country’s overall score of 42.5 on the 2012 Mo 
Ibrahim Index of African Governance remains significantly below both the West Africa Regional average 
(51.9) and the continental average (51.2). Similarly, Guinea’s CPIA score of 3.0 for 2012 continues to 
place the country in the fragile category, while currently none of Guinea’s sub-indicators on the World 
Governance Indicators reaches the 25th percentile. The sub-indicators of “Rule of Law”, “Political 
Stability”, and “Control of Corruption” are ranked especially low, indicating particular challenges in these 
areas.  
B. Laying the Foundation for Good Governance 
23. While external institutional anchors might help, strong democratic institutions supported 
by the population remain the main instrument for ensuring that Guinea benefits from its natural 
resources. The adoption of the new Constitution and subsequent elections in 2010 were a crucial first 
step in this direction. Unfortunately the next steps, parliamentary elections followed by local elections, 
have been repeatedly postponed. These delays demonstrate the difficulties in establishing strong 
institutions in an environment dominated by ethnic loyalties and other historical and regional issues. The 
commitment to strengthening judicial institutions and security reforms prioritized in the Government’s 
development program will only be viable if the institutions are supported by the population at large and 
across ethnic lines.

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

24. 
Enhancing economic governance and public financial management (PFM) is crucial to state 
effectiveness and hence economic growth. Recent PFM assessments identified a number of critical 
shortcomings in budget preparation and execution processes as well as internal and external controls. In 
response, the authorities have modernized the legal PFM framework with the adoption of a new organic 
law related to finance in August 2012 and accounting regulations in January 2013. These new regulations 
are expected to be fully implemented over a transition period of five years from 2013 to 2017. Their 
specific impacts are yet to be assessed, but should be significant, given the strong focus on program 
budgeting and the elaboration of Medium Term Expenditures Frameworks in key priority sectors.  

25. 
The modernization of the National Statistical System under the purview of the Ministry of 
Planning must be prioritized to assess the impact of major policy reforms and investment projects. 
Reforms need to build on ongoing efforts to improve real sector and monetary statistics. A critical mass of 
economic and social information is available. However, the processing and analysis needed for design, 
monitoring and evaluation is being improved. Persistent weaknesses are noted in terms of regularity and 
timeliness of publications to better understand the impacts of macroeconomic policies at the micro level 
(on households and enterprises). Insufficient knowledge of the informal sector constitutes a handicap for 
its inclusion in the programs for poverty reduction, and in tax and employment policies. In addition, the 
lack of reliable statistics in tourism, transport and public works discourages investment. The quality of 
information on employment and births (the last census was held in 1996) is also major concern. In the 
rural sector, the lack of an integrated system of statistics hampers the authorities’ ability to target and 
monitor the implementation of policies. Further, the national statistical system is still confronted with the 
absence of methodological documents on standards, classifications, and procedures for the collection, 
processing, analysis and dissemination of data. All these constraints, combined with limited qualified 
human resources and deficiencies in equipment and financial resources, do not allow a good design of 
strategies and development programs as well as monitoring their implementation. To address such 
challenges, the authorities developed a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). This 
strategy is based on four pillars: (i) Strengthening the institutional and organizational framework; (ii) 
Improving the quality and the coverage of the statistical production; (iii) Capacity building to increase 
efficiency in statistical services delivery; (iv) Improving the archiving system, and the dissemination and 
use of statistical data, as well as improving research. There is a critical need to support Guinea in better 
implementing this strategy. This will contribute to the promotion of sound and regular statistical 
information that will allow the authorities to evaluate policies and adjust as needed. 

Figure 4: Improvements in access to water 
and sanitation in Guinea (WDI data) 

26. 
The urban population has been growing 
from 28 percent of the total population in 1990 to 
36 percent to date and continues to be confronted 
with the limited availability of potable water, a key 
ingredient for improving health outcomes. Over the 
recent years, urban poverty has increased both in 
absolute numbers and as a share of the population. 
Urban growth has not been accompanied by the 
infrastructure and basic services needed. The 
Government will need to augment the flow of 
resources to local governments, commensurate with 
the mandates set for the latter in the decentralization 
law. Together with appropriate capacity building at all 
levels of government, this is critical to improving 
urban infrastructure and basic services delivery. 
Equally, improving water supply services would result in lower prices compared to what residents in

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

Conakry and other major cities currently are obliged to pay to third parties and would thereby increase 
access to potable water. 

27. 
Increasing the role of social accountability networks is key to improving local governance 
capacity for service delivery. Historically Guinea’s citizens have not been empowered to challenge 
public institutions that delivered poor service. The institutions themselves are frequently hampered by 
complex regulations. Further, the existing rules are not always applied, and it is not uncommon for 
citizens to face transaction costs when accessing public services. The limitations to service delivery in 
remote areas relate to lack of both financial and qualified human resources, which remain largely 
concentrated at the central level. The Government envisages strengthening local accountability networks 
that can challenge the public institutions and by enhancing local capacity through decentralization. As 
part of its development program, the Government foresees a two-phase process to strengthen 
decentralization over the next 10 years. A first phase is expected to put in place the necessary conditions 
and instruments for effective decentralization and de-concentration. A second phase plans to focus on 
strengthening local communities.  

Box 3: LPDSE: Energy Policy Letter 

28. 
Further, reinforcing bottom-up social accountability efforts with the ongoing modernization 
agenda for the public administration will have a transformative impact. These efforts are supported 
by a broad coalition of government officials and politicians but efforts suffer from a lack of coordination. 
There are a number of initiatives and institutions with overlapping agendas and conflicting reporting 
structures. One of the most important initiatives is the Government’s “Program for State Reform and 
Modernization of the Public Administration” (PREMA) under which the High Commission for State 
Reform and Administration Modernization (HCREMA) was created. The HCREMA is charged with 
facilitating and coordinating public sector reform and creating a platform for participation and 
collaboration with civil society. The Strategic Framework envisages first the preparation and piloting of 
priority reforms, with a roadmap to clarify and confirm the role and mandate of public institutions in key 
sectors, and the creation of a broad base of support among both the civil and military side of public 
administration, civil society and local communities.  
C. Diversified and Inclusive Growth 
29. 
 Energy is prioritized as it is a major 
constraint to economic growth and hence 
poverty alleviation 
(paragraph 12 above 
discussed the link between growth and poverty 
alleviation 
in Guinea). Key coordinated 
institutional and investment improvements in 
key sectors are urgently needed to unlock 
Guinea’s hydropower potential. Establishing 
electricity supply in urban, densely populated 
areas is a key concern for the Government, but 
the mining sector and agricultural productivity 
would also benefit. Despite the current status of 
the sector, there are promising development 
prospects. There is an enormous untapped 
potential for hydroelectricity: out of 6000 MW 
only 127.2 MW are installed capacity. The 
Government has been particularly active in 
developing Guinea’s energy sector since 2006. 
This has been part of the implementation of the ECOWAS White Paper for a regional policy on access to 
energy services for rural and peri-urban areas to achieve the MDGs. Access programs involving the three 

The Government’s energy strategy in the short- to medium 
term, as expressed in its updated Energy Sector Policy Letter 
(LPDSE) of March 2012, consists of: (i) providing a high level 
of access and quality of service through the accelerated 
rehabilitation of existing capacities and development of 
additional generation capacity 
(thermal and hydro); 
(ii) 
achieving sector financial autonomy through a suitable tariff 
structure and commercial management and implementation of an 
Action Plan for EDG, endorsed by GoG and the main donors on 
January 15-16, 2012; (iii) supporting the participation of private 
partners in generation, transmission and distribution in a fair 
regulatory framework, relying in particular on partnerships with 
the mining industry established in Guinea; (iv) redirecting the 
role of the Government toward definition of policies and 
strategies with a reinforcement of the energy sector Regulator; 
and 
(v) accelerating 
the development of 
the country’s 
hydropower potential for increased energy security and lower 
production cost. 

12 

 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

pillars of the White Paper (modern cooking fuels, power and electricity) have been progressively 
deployed despite an unsettled political climate. The approach to energy efficiency is two-fold: (i) a 
lighting component led by Energie de Guine -EDG aims to distribute 5 million energy-saving lamps in 
the country; and (ii) an efficient biomass use initiative, whereby the Government will promote efficient 
wood cookers (EPC) and improved stoves. The short- to medium-term energy policy is described in Box 
3. 

30. 
  Agricultural growth is crucial for employment and poverty alleviation in Guinea where an 
estimated 80 percent of the population is sustained by agriculture. Agriculture has the potential to 
boost employment growth both directly and indirectly, as there are prospects for backward and forward 
linkages. Further, by reducing food prices, agriculture contributes indirectly to poverty alleviation. Guinea 
has great potential for economic growth in this 
Box 4: PNIASA – National Agriculture 
sector due to its excellent conditions for agriculture 
and its strategic location that favors trade. With 
about 64 percent of Guinea’s population living in 
rural areas, including 88 percent of the poor and 90 
percent of the extreme poor, increasing agricultural 
productivity is critical for providing jobs and higher 
incomes. However, while agricultural potential is 
high, productivity remains low. Most land use is for 
subsistence farming on small family farms (1-3 ha), 
which lack the technology and capital to pursue 
intensive crop production. Increased production is 
primarily driven by area expansion and has often 
been at the expense of the environment, with erosion 
of mountain slopes due to clearing for rain-fed rice. 
The dominance of subsistence production and the 
lack of market linkages have so far limited the 

The National Agricultural Investment and Food 
Security Plan 2012-2016 (PNIASA) was approved by 
the Government in December 2012. The PNIASA aims 
for Guinea to achieve a 6 percent growth rate in the 
sector and attain the MDGs. The Government intends to 
successfully implement this plan, with a vision to: (a) 
ensure food security; and (b) ultimately position Guinea 
as an exporter of agricultural products. The PNIASA 
identifies 
six priority 
investment programs: 
(i) 
sustainable development of the rice sub-sector; (ii) 
diversification for food security and the population’s 
nutrition improvement; (iii) promotion of agricultural 
exports and agribusiness; (iv) integrated natural resource 
management; (v) institutional capacity building; and (vi) 
coordination of PNIASA’s implementation. 

value-adding potential of the sector.  

31. 
Regional growth poles could be the starting point for building infrastructure for the 
processing and exporting of agricultural products, taking advantage of the transport infrastructure 
in place for resource extraction. The private sector should be considered, through IFC’s support, as a 
potentially strong actor, whether as a stand-alone investor in a direct agri-business enterprise, perhaps one 
that incorporates an out grower scheme, or as a participant enabling more effective functioning of the 
value chain, for example, through the provision of transportation services or warehousing and cold 
storage. MIGA’s guarantees could also be used for foreign investors looking to enter the market. In order 
to unleash the potential in this sector, immediate actions must focus on raising productivity and reducing 
factor costs, developing agricultural growth zones and infrastructure for export of fruits and cash crops, 
and developing coherent sectoral strategies for agriculture.  Finally for fishery which remains a key sector 
of the Guinean economy, Guinea currently realizes far smaller economic benefits from its marine fish 
resources than could be the case mainly due to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. Rough 
estimates indicate that Guinea could recover the shortfall on catches of around 65 percent for an estimated 
US$20 million value. In 2012, the sector contributed about US$4.2 million to the annual budget from 
license fees and fines whereas in neighboring Liberia fines amounted to US$5.5 million. Governance 
reforms to reduce open access to resources has inevitably led to a ‘’tragedy of the commons’’ situation 
where overexploitation rises as economic returns decrease, and reduction of illegal fishing could rebuild 
the fisheries as a future source of growth. 

32. 
Guinea’s mining sector is important for growth and fiscal revenues, but creates few jobs 
directly. The authorities aim to translate the country’s mineral resources into sustainable development 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

through developing the legal and institutional framework and increasing capacity of stakeholders to 
manage and oversee the sector. Measures relate to addressing social and environmental impacts, revenue 
collection, and management, distribution and investment of these revenues for the benefit of the mining 
communities and the country. The sector currently represents over 80 percent of exports, provides 20 to 
25 percent of government revenues (an estimated US$210 million in 2012) and over 10,000 direct jobs 
(0.25 percent of the labor force). Guinea hosts some of the largest non-developed deposits of bauxite and 
iron ore in the world. Bauxite is the most exploited, including the deposits of Kindia Sangaredi and Fria. 
Local processing of alumina is still extremely low (about 4 percent of the production). There is significant 
scope for increasing the production capacity of bauxite and the capacity utilization rate. It is in this 
context that the Guinea Bauxite Company (CBG) is currently undertaking a capacity expansion that will 
increase its production by 18 percent by 2018.  

33. 
The Simandou iron ore mining project could potentially play a transformational role. If 
properly developed, such large projects are expected to have an enormous long-term impact on Guinea, 
notably through spillover effects on community development (thousands of direct and indirect jobs and 
related revenues, SME development, associated social benefits, health and education), the infrastructure 
and power sectors, the agriculture value-chain and Guinea’s fiscal space. Such mining projects offer a 
unique opportunity for Guinea to grow substantially over a relatively short period of time and it is the role 
of the World Bank Group to support the Government of Guinea so that the project can be built and 
operated for the greater benefit of all Guineans. 
D. Strengthening Human Capital 
34. 
Despite progress in education, there are still many challenges related to coverage, quality, 
and relevance. With a gross enrollment rate of about 80 percent in 2011 significant progress has been 
made in primary school attendance, including for girls, albeit not as quickly as planned. However, school 
enrollment rates by age levels continue to show an abysmal picture with approximately 60 percent of the 
age 8-14 student population out of school. This represents around one million children, many of whom 
live in remote and rural areas. Additionally, a learning assessment conducted in 2012 in grades 2, 3 and 4 
suggests that the Government must do more to increase primary completion rates, achieve gender parity, 
improve learning outcomes, and make education more relevant to the needs of the labor market. A 
relatively low share of GDP is geared towards education (less than 3 percent) and a distribution of 
resources between the different education sub-sectors that is not aligned with MDG goals is not 
conducive to improvements in the sector.

Progress towards achieving the health MDGs by 2015 hinges on improving the management 
and financing of the health care system. Health sector challenges are multiple with deteriorating trends 
in many health sector indicators. Access to prenatal care and to some child immunizations (DTP3) has 
significantly increased from 2000 to 2011. However, infant and maternal mortality rates (at respectively 
67 per 1,000 and 980 per 100,000) are among the highest in Africa. This is the result of deteriorating 
access to many health services, particularly in the rural areas, low quality of health services, weakening in 
some child vaccinations since 2008 and inadequate and irregular budget allocation to the health sector. In 
relation to spending, the combination of very low allocation (less than 1 percent of GDP) and weak 
execution undermines the effectiveness of health sector policies. The Government will need to mitigate 

14 

 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

the financial burden through the establishment of health insurance schemes and health mutual, raising 
significantly the share of the population covered by these beyond 4 percent. Health expenditures which 
are currently focused on secondary care, tertiary care, and central administration, need to be redirected 
towards primary care.

The Government will need to take measures to extend social protection coverage and 
improve its quality in the short- to medium-term. It also needs to develop a coherent social protection 
strategy and an effective safety net system capable of reducing inequality and increasing resilience to 
shocks, such as a rise in basic commodities prices.  These concerns can be addressed by improving the 
management and operation of subsidies by providing clear price information on such products, 
strengthening price and quality control institutions, and fostering better coordination between the central 
and local levels of such institutions. It is also fundamental that an educational conditional cash transfer 
approach be implemented in rural areas, as well as a non-contributory health insurance for the poor and 
the extreme poor. 

IV. GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY 

A. Unlocking Diversified and Inclusive Growth: Guinea’s Development Agenda 
PRSP-III 

37. 
Recognizing the challenges and issues at stake, the Government of Guinea, in its Third 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, plans to foster inclusive and sustainable growth. Indeed, the poor 
economic performance over the last decade was inadequate for laying the basis for accelerated growth 
that would trigger job creation and reduce poverty sustainably. The new Government strategy focuses on 
the diversification of economic growth sources, the implementation of sector strategies and support for 
the social sectors.   
B. Targeting Growth by Sector 
38. 
To mitigate the risk of a mineral economy, the PRSP focuses on economic growth in sectors 
that may drive overall economic growth. Economic policies are targeted to boost development in 
agriculture, mining, hydroelectricity, as well as construction and public works, information and 
communications technology (ICT), and tourism. These sectors are prioritized on the basis of Guinea’s 
comparative advantage, notably its resource endowment. The choice is strategic; not all sectors are 
chosen, for example the PRSP does not cover the manufacturing and urban sector in the same detail as it 
does the agricultural or electricity sectors.  

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

39. 
Spatial inequalities will be addressed by a “growth corridor” approach to private sector 
development. Public infrastructure—transport, electricity and telecommunications—will be the backbone 
of the growth corridors. Such infrastructure can be linked directly to major mining sites, or financed 
indirectly by mining revenues but linked to hydroelectricity sites and trade opportunities with neighboring 
countries or targeted at regions with the highest levels of poverty. The infrastructure will be 
complemented by broader growth areas, defined as all land within two hours’ travel distance to the 
corridor, where clarification of land rights will be prioritized to provide investors with secure land 
property rights. Secure property rights and adequate infrastructure will be a condition to attract 
investments, including with support from IFC and MIGA. Potential large-scale project sponsors will be 
encouraged to contract local small-scale enterprises along their supply or distribution value chains. 
C. Embracing Regional Integration 
40. 
Effective regional integration offers Guinea a great chance to diversify its economic base. 
The country’s hydro potential could be transformed into a sustainable source of export income, leveraging 
ongoing initiatives such as the West African Power Pool (WAPP). Equally, Guinea could realize its 
comparative advantage in promoting certain agricultural products, where the country’s geographical 
proximity to Senegal and Mali offers a real opportunity for export-led growth. Finally, broader regional, 
cross-border trade could benefit from ongoing reforms supported by the IFC Investment Climate Program 
working to improve Doing Business indicators. 

41. 
The construction of rail, port and airport infrastructure will contribute to sustainable and 
diversified growth in Guinea. Current infrastructure projects mainly focus on rail and port developments 
and are linked to the large mining developments: (i) corridor Nord-Ouest (North-West corridor) will 
imply the extension of the infrastructure to access the bauxite deposits up to the northern area of Gaoual; 
(ii) Corridor Sud-Est (South-East corridor or Trans-Guinéen), to be developed as part of the Simandou 
project, will have to accommodate the transport of 150+ megatons per annum (mtpa) of iron ore 
production from the Simandou deposits, and possibly some of the bauxite and iron production of the 
Central area. Outside the mining sector, four other projects are currently in the Government’s plans: two 
of them are related to ports (Conakry and Benti), one is a new international airport, and one is the rail link 
to Mali. Conakry is a small port, which has reached the limits of its handling capacity. Two port 
extensions have been planned, and one is to be completed in 2013 (extension of the container terminal), 
while the other, which includes an extension of the oil terminal, is still at a project stage.  

D. Promoting SMEs and an Enabling Business Environment 
42. 
Guinea plans to broaden the country’s small and medium enterprise (SME) base through 
investment climate reform, solutions to improve access to finance, and the establishment of SME 
growth corridors.  Severely limited access to finance (especially for SMEs), inadequate supply of 
infrastructure, deficiencies in logistics and trade facilitation, corruption and low capacity of the 
Government, inflation, and poor education of the workforce, combined with one of the weakest legal 
enabling environment for business in Africa and a history of poor governance, erratic policy, and 
inconsistent regulatory enforcement, has seriously undermined investor confidence in Guinea’s 
institutions. As a result, private participation in the economy remains low and firms’ productivity 
measured by value added is one of the lowest in Africa. Firms’ links with the financial sector are weak; 
only 6 percent of firms surveyed in the 2006 Enterprise survey have a bank loan. Credit to the private 
sector is low as well, at around 5 percent of GDP for much of the last decade (against a Sub-Saharan 
African average of 59.6 percent). By end 2012, the formal banking sector consisted of the Central Bank 
and 14 commercial banks (with 3 more having received an agreement and getting ready to start). The 
banking sector is highly concentrated, not up to date technologically and banks tend to favor short-term 
lending at high interest rates. While the microfinance sector grew strongly from a small base, 

16 

 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

microfinance institutions are loss making and need capacity and technology upgrading. Finally, it is 
important for the efficiency and the use of payment services by all potential users to be improved, in a 
context of financial inclusion.  

43. 
Cross-border financial activities with neighboring countries will further strengthen regional 
ties between Guinea and its neighbors.  Financial service activities in Guinea are based largely on trade, 
especially with neighboring countries; this offers an opportunity to undertake a feasibility exercise of 
integrating retail financial services between Guinea and other WAEMU countries to facilitate cross-
border payments and support small-scale trade. Ensuring interoperability of financial infrastructure 
through integration of the country with the WAEMU financial platform, will contribute to harmonizing 
the country’s financial sector regulatory framework with the one governing WAEMU member states.  
E. Developing Twenty-first Century Skills 
44. 
Education needs to equip Guineans with the right skills for the emerging export-oriented 
activities such as agriculture, mining, and tourism. The lack of relevant vocational programs in 
secondary and tertiary education has led to an excessive emphasis on general education with a focus on 
humanities. Promoting SMEs and an enabling business environment will help deliver the diversification 
agenda, and mitigate the sensitive issue of youth unemployment.  Guinea needs to focus on scientific and 
technological skills and core competencies required by the vast majority of economic sectors and 
technical skills relevant to the key priority sectors.  

45. 
Investors providing on-the-job training should find local competencies more widely 
available in Guinea. The government plans to open training and vocational education centers, while also 
creating higher education offer by introducing mining universities. Defining and implementing support 
programs for skills development and higher education will be critical to generate local jobs from large 
mining investments. 
V. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA (FY14-FY17) 
A. The World Bank’s Role in the Current Landscape of Development Assistance in Guinea 

46. 
A key and longstanding partner of Guinea, the World Bank will leverage its strategic 
position. The Bank will convene the other development partners to support Guinea’s development 
agenda, especially around the key sectors of energy, agriculture and human capital development.  In 
addition to its financial contribution to supporting the Government’s PRSP, the Bank Group will 
contribute its large knowledge base and provide advisory leadership to help Guinea formulate and 
implement sound and results-based development solutions. 

47. 
The World Bank Group CPS for the period FY2014-FY2017 focuses on: (i) improving 
governance and service delivery, (ii) stimulating growth and economic diversification, and (iii) 
strengthening human capital.  The delivery approach of proposed interventions under the CPS the Bank 
will be by (i) leading in a small number of selected areas where the World Bank has a well-established 
track record; (ii) complementing the activities of other development partners on issues for which the Bank 
Group shares a common vision and development objectives with such partners; and (iii) keeping the Bank 
Group informed on developments on issues where the Bank Group does not intervene directly.  From a 
sectoral perspective, proposed operations are mainly focused on agriculture and energy, using the full 
spectrum of instruments at the World Bank’s disposal: economic sector work (ESW), technical assistance 
(TA), investment financing and policy lending, given the potentially high synergies between them.  IFC 
and MIGA will contribute, each based on their respective areas of expertise. 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

48. 
The focus areas of the World Bank Group CPS were selected based on an assessment of the 
World Bank Group’s comparative advantage. Consistent with the Africa Regional Strategy, this CPS 
focuses on areas where the Bank can contribute directly to (a) inclusive growth through better governance 
and diversification and (b) strengthening of human capital, with a strong focus on regional synergies. The 
CPS draws on a Fragility Assessment conducted by the Bank’s Global Center on Conflict Security and 
Development and feedback received via the Client Survey, and integrates considerations related to 
addressing fragility and building lasting stability across the portfolio. Finally, this CPS has benefited from 
an extensive stakeholder consultation process, which involved civil society, NGOs, Government, the 
business community, parliament, and the donor community, both in Conakry, as well as throughout the 
country. 

49. 
In the Client Survey, stakeholders identified energy sector development as the key 
development 
priority 
in 
the 
country. Education, 
public 
sector 
governance, 
and 
security/stabilization/reconstruction emerge as priority areas as well. Under the umbrella of poverty 
reduction, respondents recognized rural and agricultural development (along with the energy sector) as 
critical to reducing poverty in Guinea. Within this context, respondents are keen to see the Bank focus its 
financial resources and knowledge work in these particular areas. Clients also perceive the World Bank as 
a trustful guardian of sound and transparent governance practices and pro-poor reforms in Guinea. 
B. Ongoing World Bank Group Portfolio 
50. 
The proposed CPS builds on strengths and lessons learned from the current portfolio. The 
national IDA portfolio consists of 6 approved operations for a total of US$116.15 million, including a 
Village Community Support that has disbursed its IDA component entirely and continues to disburse 
donor funds, and a recently approved Micro and Small Enterprise operation. About US$66 million 
remains to be disbursed. Since the Bank’s re-engagement with Guinea in April 2011, several projects 
have been restructured to allow for rapid service delivery without overburdening the limited institutional 
capacity. Disbursements have picked up and most projects are being upgraded to satisfactory status. 
Guinea has ended Fiscal Year 2013 with a 28.5 percent (as of the end of June) disbursement ratio, above 
both the IDA 25 percent target and the 16 percent AFR trend disbursement rates (annualized at 19.2 
percent). In addition, the E-signature disbursement procedures are being applied to the entire active 
portfolio, projected to boost the disbursement rate further. Guinea also benefits from four regional 
operations amounting to US$68.1 million: the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and 
Sustainable Ecosystems Management Project (US$9 million), West Africa Regional Communications 
Infrastructure Project APL-1B (US$34 million), Senegal River Basin Multi-purpose Water Resources 
Development Project (US$18 million), and the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety & Security 
Project (US$7 million). 

51. 
The fiduciary performance of the current portfolio is, to some extent, hampered by capacity 
constraints, especially in the procurement processes. As a result, some initiatives have been taken to 
overcome systemic procurement issues; for example, a focal point has been designated at the Ministry of 
Finance to follow up on administrative clearances. Financial Management performance has generally 
been good, as almost half of the Project implementation supervision reports (ISRs) are rated as 
satisfactory with a moderate financial management (FM) risk rating. Most interim financial reports (IFR) 
are being submitted on time to the Bank and the quality of reports appears acceptable. In 2012, Guinea 
achieved 80 percent fiduciary compliance of audited reports submitted within the fiscal year. Most of the 
opinions of the audit reports were unqualified and there were no significant FM issues 

18 

 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

C. Lessons from the Previous Country Strategies 
52. 
The previous CAS and the 2011-12 ISN provide the following lessons for the 2014-2017 
CPS, as detailed in the CAS Completion Report: 

a. Sector policy dialogue needs to be integrated into the macro policy dialogue and elevated to the 
highest level, reflecting the increasingly centralized nature of the policy dialogue. This approach 
may also require the Bank to focus on supporting key reforms, wait for policy decisions to 
materialize at the preparation stage, before committing funding for investments even if investment 
levels are relatively modest. Positive examples of these lessons were acquired by the education and 
governance projects, as well as the analytical work on trade issues. 

b. Development Policy Operations can provide an effective framework for Government entities to 
focus on the implementation of a selected and time-bound set of critical reforms, as it was observed 
in the 18 months prior to the attainment of the HIPC completion point. Enabling conditions for 
success include complementary technical assistance, harmonized budget support from partners, as 
well as an adequate macro-economic framework. 

c. 

In choosing lending instruments, consideration should be given to the specific sector objectives and 
the overall institutional environment of the sector. While certain instruments (such as APLs) were 
seen as innovative in addressing previously identified weaknesses in traditional project lending, 
financing was not always adequate to complete all activities planned in each phase. Without 
presumed recourse to the subsequent phase, triggers become less meaningful and there’s a risk of 
incomplete activities.  

d. The design of the operations should be simple and focused on the Government’s priorities and 
commitment. Consistent with the Government’s strategy discussed above, local authorities and 
communities should play a crucial role in the design and implementation of such projects and be 
represented in the oversight committee. 

e. 

Implementation arrangements and staffing need to be well-embedded in existing administrative and 
political structures. Pro-active project supervision (and effective management) should aim to identify 
opportunities and take action where they occur. The background is that while almost all Bank-
funded projects are led by project implementation units (PIUs), experience shows management 
responsibility should be entrusted to suitable Government units, equipped for the task. 

f. M&E systems should set realistic targets and be established prior to project launch, including 
arrangements for collecting and analyzing data. As always, the timetable for project activities should 
be consistent with borrower implementation capacity. 

g. Given the anticipated and unanticipated risks associated with working with fragile countries in 
general, close coordination with other development partners is indispensable for mitigating risks, 
realizing synergies, and increasing leverage in such important areas like policy dialogue. 
D. Proposed Program 
53. 
The CPS addresses poverty reduction and shared prosperity by supporting improved 
governance systems, fostering accelerated, equitable and diversified growth in Guinea and 
accompanying improvements in human capital.  The proposed program of activities is grouped under 
the following Strategic Areas of Engagements: (i) Improve governance, (ii) Stimulate growth and 
economic diversification, and (iii) Strengthen human capital.  The IDA resources allocated for Guinea for 
the CPS, are indicative and subject to: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance 
rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation 

19 

 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

deductions associated with debt relief; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA 
assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries.  The FY15 
allocation will depend on the above factors, as well as on the overall size of the IDA 17 replenishment. 2 

54. 
The WBG’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity will be 
pursued through existing and new investment and technical assistance instruments.  For example the 
Bank’s Productive Social Safety Nets project which aims to provide income support to vulnerable groups 
and lay the foundations of a social safety net strategy by testing some of the building blocks necessary for 
a larger system, will contribute to the poverty goal.  The project plans to support a labor intensive public 
work program in urban areas with a focus on youth and life skills trainings.  For example in Conakry, the 
capital, the number of beneficiaries for this component is expected to reach 162,000 urban poor people, 
including 33,000 temporary jobs, with the person/days of work reaching 2,700,000. 

55. 
The Bank will pursue governance and public sector reform in order to alleviate 
administrative constraints and improve social service delivery to the poor.  To spearhead economic 
growth, employment creation, and poverty reduction, the Bank Group’s support will focus on boosting 
private sector development, with a specific focus on agriculture and energy. Finding a sustainable solution 
to Guinea’s current energy crisis will be central to boosting shared prosperity for all. With the ongoing 
Electricity Sector Efficiency Improvement Project and its follow-on operation, the Bank will work with 
the Government to replace across-the-board subsidies with a sustainable price structure envisaging lower 
rates for small consumers. This will target subsidies at low income households and reduce subsidies from 
the budget to the power generating and distribution company (Electricité de Guinée). Liberalization of the 
electricity price for large consumers will also help to develop Guinea as a hub for regional power 
generation and distribution. Furthermore, a legal framework for public private partnerships would attract 
private investors. In parallel, a poverty-oriented power strategy could focus on sustainable biomass 
harvesting and more efficient stoves. 

56. 
In the course of CPS implementation, the Bank will build the foundations for shared growth 
generated by mining and diversified activities in agriculture. The Bank will fine tune ongoing 
activities, improve the knowledge base and launch new programs to introduce transparency in linking 
revenues with priority public investments and pro-poor expenditures. This will entail public expenditure 
management, public investment planning, budget transparency with citizen monitoring mechanisms, as 
well as improving the governance structure and capacity of key sectors, mainly mining, energy, 
agriculture, but also health and education. At the same time, the Bank will contribute to setting up 
systems for skills development to meet the demands of Guinea’s economy, as well as in basic and higher 
education and in health. 

2Also, IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance.  While the US dollar equivalent amount is 
provided at the exchange rate of USD1.50233/SDR, the final exchange rate for each operation depends on the 
applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval.

58. 
As indicated in the poverty analysis above (see Section II. C on Poverty and Gender 
Profiles), elusive and volatile growth have led to an increase in poverty rates in recent years. The 
World Bank Group will continue to support the Government in maintaining macroeconomic 
stability and economic governance for equitable growth. Efforts will continue to focus on reforms in 
public expenditure and public investment management, including the improvement of fiscal policy and 
the pursuit of prudent fiscal and monetary policies that helped to break the spiral of inflation and the 
depreciation of the exchange rate. This will also entail supporting effective monitoring of the state owned 
enterprise portfolio and public investment management. The Bank will support the Government’s 
program for further structural reforms to reduce barriers to the realization of the country’s full economic 
potential. Regarding administrative governance, the Bank’s support will focus on supporting the 
Government’s ongoing reform and modernization program (PREMA).  

59. 
Bank support to Public Sector Management and Governance will be comprehensive and 
include a variety of ongoing and new instruments. A technical assistance project, the Economic 
Governance and Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (EGTACB) project, became effective only 
recently, yet it reflects the priorities of a more uncertain political transition. The project will continue to 
provide support for strengthening basic capacities in budget management and public administration, while 
initiating support for public investment management, but its design will be fine-tuned to the new context 
of longer term governance priorities. A GPF Trust Fund complements this program in support to the 
establishment of an investment fund for revenues from natural resources. New activities will include: (i) 
an SPF Trust Fund further supporting public administration leadership and reform; and (ii) on the basis of 
the performance of EGTACB, a new IDA Credit, in the form of a Results-Based Technical Assistance 
project, ensuring sustainable support to public investment management, as well as to the implementation 
of reforms to improve the investment climate, in agriculture and energy sectors. The CPS program also 
envisages a follow-on operation that will likely address specific executive governance constraints in 
public financial management. 

60. 
The Bank Group will continue to support reforms, initiatives, and short- to medium-term 
capacity building to enhance the efficiency and governance systems for institutions involved in the 
management of the mining sector. Reforms will be supported all along the Extractive Industries Value 
Chain, with the exception of revenue management. The World Bank Group will also support the 
development of a framework that promotes regional and local development of mining areas and “demand 
for good governance”. In light of the recently adopted policy to increase state ownership of mines and 
associated infrastructure (rail and road), this recently approved Mining Sector Governance and TA project 
will provide the following: (a) Support to the Société Guinéenne du Patrimoine Minier (SOGUIPAMI) to 
clarify its mandate and role vis-à-vis the Ministries of Mining, Transport and Finance; and (b) Transaction 

23 

 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

advisory to relevant government entities regarding available options for financing, ownership, access fees 
and operating costs of mines and infrastructure to enable informed decision-making; and to provide 
relevant technical, legal and financial advisory services related to potential financing and management of 
mining assets. The project will also strengthen the government’s capacities to license, control and monitor 
technical, environmental, and financial compliance of mining operations. 

61. 
The Bank will continue to support improvements to the governance of the mining sector 
through the Mining Sector Technical Assistant Project, which became effective in FY13, to support 
the capacity of the Ministry of Mines and Geology in contract negotiation, implementation of the new 
mining code and coordination with relevant ministries. The Bank will also support progress towards the 
EITI. Further support to the governance of the sector will be provided through a new operation which will 
address key policy actions in mining, energy and agriculture. 

62. 
To improve capacity to collect, analyze and use poverty data and statistical information in 
key sectors, the Bank will prepare a Country Statistical Brief and seek resources from the 
Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund to support the National Statistical System. The Country 
Statistical Brief will include: (i) an evaluation of existing statistics for all sectors; (ii) an assessment of the 
main constraints to statistical development; (iii) a review of the implementation of NSDS (National 
Strategy for the Development of Statistics), including existing and planned programs; (iv) a review of 
partners’ activities including the Bank; and (v) an identification of activities that the Bank could support 
(financing, knowledge, partnership). It is envisaged that the Bank’s support will focus on the collection of 
household statistics that will allow the authorities to assess the welfare impact of specific policies and 
investment projects (see Annex 12).  

63. 
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes-Accounting and Auditing of Guinea 
(ROSC) highlighted serious weaknesses of the Professional Accounting Organization (PAO) in 
Guinea. The Government has therefore recognized the need for support in strengthening the capacity of 
the PAO to be more active in the process of regulation and making financial information transparent. An 
Institutional Development Funds (IDF) will support the development of the accounting profession in line 
with the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) requirements. The improvement in the use of 
IFAC standards would contribute to bolstering overall quality of the accounting and audit profession in 
Guinea and enhance the country’s financial accountability arrangements and governance practices with a 
real impact on private sector development. 

Strategic Areas of Engagement 2: Stimulate Growth and Economic Diversification 

64. 
Under this area of engagement, the Bank Group’s program will focus on addressing key 
constraints to growth, diversification and employment creation, in particular by playing a catalytic role in 
energy, agriculture, private and financial sector development, and regional integration.

Hydroelectricity 

65. 
The hydroelectricity sector could provide the basis for Guinea’s modernization and also 
supply regional markets. Guinea’s large hydropower potential is estimated at over 6000 MW, 
which could make it an important exporter of power to neighboring countries. The overall 
electrification rate is estimated at 17 percent, with rural electrification at 3 percent only. In 2011, the 
urban power generation capacity in Guinea was 130 MW, against an estimated peak demand of 230 MW, 
thus resulting in widespread load shedding. Hydropower contributed 55 percent of generation, versus 45 
percent for oil-based thermal power. The urban electricity sector, managed by the state-owned utility 
Energie de Guinée (EDG), is in a critical situation resulting in widespread power shortages; dilapidated 
infrastructure due to lack of investment and maintenance; high system losses and electricity theft; low bill 
collection; and increasing financial losses. Given the current level of subsidies to the sector and the 
persistent inefficiency of the utility, there is a need to improve the company’s financial and technical 
performance before extending the grid or expanding hydropower. In its action plan for EDG, the 
Government has included signing a performance contract between EDG and the Government and an 
external assistance contract with a private operator for the management of EDG. To address the rural-
urban divide (see Section II. C above) the Bank will support the Government address the off-grid needs, 
and the Government has committed to the creation of a Rural Electrification Agency. In the longer term, 
Guinea needs to shift gradually away from thermal power generation to hydropower as its main source of 
generation for all customers (including mines) and become an exporter of power to other West African 
nations. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) constitute the best opportunity for Guinea to develop its 
hydropower potential. 

66. 
Despite the current state of the sector, the development prospects of Guinea’s energy sector 
are extremely positive. There is an enormous untapped potential for hydroelectricity: out of 6000 MW 
only 127.2 MW are installed capacity. Flagship projects of hydroelectric development include the Kaléta 
project for an installed capacity of 240 MW (in progress) and Souapiti, a 515 MW hydropower project. 
There are also several rehabilitation projects of the electrical network underway, initiated with the support 
of donors (World Bank, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank), as well as 
interconnection projects with neighboring countries (Côte d'Ivoire-Liberia - Sierra Leone - Mali and 
Senegal), which received the support of the WAPP. The Government has a 20-year plan to realize the full 
potential of the sector, covering the supply and demand of energy and incorporating the concerns of 
energy efficiency and renewable energy development. In the medium term, a three-year action and 
investment plan to improve EDG’s performance includes: (i) an investment plan of over US$1 billion 
over the next three years, of which almost US$300 million are yet unfunded. This plan includes the 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

Kaléta hydropower plant (US$527 million) to be funded and built through support from China. Other 
investments cover power generation, and transmission and distribution, including meters for low-voltage 
customers; (ii) a sector recovery plan, which includes modifying the legal framework for the sector and 
for PPPs, the restructuring of EDG, and signing a performance contract between EDG and the 
Government and an external assistance contract with a private operator for the management of EDG. 
Complementary progress on the reform front to ensure adequate regulatory capacity will be supported 
through the multi-sectoral (governance, agriculture, energy) Results-based Technical Assistance Project. 

67. 
The Bank will continue to be engaged in Guinea’s energy sector primarily through the 
Electricity Sector Efficiency Improvement Project, with an overall financing of US$30 million. The 
project is focused on improving the technical and commercial efficiency of the distribution network in the 
city center of Conakry; it also includes actions to rehabilitate power generation and improve EDG’s 
management. The Bank Group will provide timely advice to the Government for appropriate approaches 
for institutional, technical, and economic design and implementation of access expansion programs, in 
consultation with other donors. In addition, the World Bank’s engagement with the energy sector in 
Guinea is well aligned with the Government’s priorities, in particular, the development of its large 
untapped hydropower potential through public-private partnerships with the mining sector and through 
regional projects that will enable Guinea to export part of its hydropower to neighboring countries. In 
addition, the Bank brings a number of comparative advantages (e.g. global knowledge, convening power, 
expertise for policy advice related to access, etc.) that position it strongly to lead this Technical 
Assistance. MIGA’s product could also be used on its own, or alongside other Bank products, to support a 
PPP process or more generally to encourage private investors into the sector. 

Agriculture 

68. 
To reduce the high levels of poverty in rural areas, the Bank will support efforts to increase 
agricultural productivity. To this end, the Bank’s future efforts will initially focus on food crop 
productivity in FY13 and FY14, with built-in support for market access, commercialization and non-food 
export crops in FY15, as part of a sector-wide program supporting Guinea’s inclusive National 
Agricultural Investment Program. The Emergency Agricultural Productivity (PUAPA) Project and the 
Second Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project (EAPSP) will empower farmer 
organizations in the distribution of government goods and services as a transition to a more market-based 
mechanism through the Government’s agricultural sector investment plan (PNIASA). The two ongoing 
agriculture sector operations: the EAPSP and the WAAPP, complement each other by focusing on 
providing producers with inputs to increase food crop production (inputs for rice, maize, cassava and 
vaccination of traditional poultry). The Bank will work with the Government of Guinea to draw from the 
lessons from these two ongoing projects to inform the design of the proposed follow-on operation. A new 
agricultural operation (IDA, $10 million) will support the diversification of activities beyond traditional 
rice farming, and contribute to the rebuilding of Guinea's agricultural research and technology transfer 
capabilities. The project is expected to help identify commodities with the highest potential for export and 
contribute to increase productivity for these commodities selected by the PNIASA, which have the 
potential to increase food security, reduce poverty and increase rural income. Complementary progress on 
the reform front to develop an enabling investment climate will be supported through the multi-sectoral 
(governance, agriculture, energy) Results-Based Technical Assistance Project. 

69. With regard to Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), an agricultural public 
expenditure review (FY13) and a Sources of Growth (FY14) Study will help lay the foundation for 
new investment lending in FY14 and FY17 as part of a sector-wide program supporting the National 
Agricultural Investment Plan. While the Agriculture Public Expenditure Review (PER) is under 
implementation, the analytical work on sources of growth still needs to be funded. Furthermore, IFC and 
MIGA will pursue agribusiness investment opportunities in Guinea where potential exists.  

26 

 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

70. 
The Bank’s strategy for the agriculture sector (including the fisheries sector) will support 
the fourth pillar of the PRSP3: Strengthen fight against hunger and malnutrition, with a view to 
halting high rates of rural poverty and worsening poverty trends linked to increase in food prices in 
in urban areas (see Section II. C above). Enhanced food production would reduce vulnerability to 
global price spikes, and potential to address to poor production of a wide range of crops for export can 
generate both incomes from peasant farming and employment opportunities in commercial agriculture.  
Guinea’s diverse climatic zones allow production of a range of products from rice to fruits (for example, 
mango, pineapple, and banana) and cash crops (for example, coffee, cocoa, palm oil).  

Mining 

71. 
Guinea is poised to receive massive amounts of foreign direct investments in mining and 
related infrastructure projects. The pipeline of proposed large FDI inflows in mining and related 
infrastructure is estimated at above US$20 billion, which is about 4-5 times the country’s GDP in 2010. 
On the other hand, the Guinean economy is still relatively weak, with a poor investment climate likely to 
face a massive exogenous shock with the discovery and exploitation of natural resources. The Bank 
Group will help lay the foundation for a sustained growth path based on these natural resources and for 
economic diversification by helping this economy to face the upcoming changes.

72. 
The Simandou mining project. The iron ore deposits have historically been the subject of 
intense competition among global mining conglomerates, including Rio Tinto (Simandou blocks 3 and 4 
in which the IFC holds a 5 percent interest). The Simandou deposit is under development, with an 
investment representing almost three times the GDP of Guinea in 2011, and it is projected that it will 
contribute on average about US$1.2 billion in royalties and taxes during the operation phase (more than 
doubling Government revenues). The development of the project is however facing a number of 
challenges, and the World Bank Group has a key role to play in overcoming these. There are other major 
iron projects in different phases of development. Guinea is also endowed with other mineral resources 
(nickel, limestone, copper, gold, diamond, among others). Hence, the establishment of the appropriate 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

investment conditions could enable the development of the proposed large projects with resulting 
significant economic and poverty alleviation impacts for Guinea and its neighboring countries. MIGA’s 
product could also be used to support investors into the sector. 

73. 
In order to expand the benefits of large investments in the mining sector in Guinea, IFC has 
developed a strong Advisory Services (AS) program.  Guinea was selected as the 8th country under the 
IFC Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) Program in 2012 and since then CASA has contributed to 
further informing IFC’s interventions and strategy in Guinea, to focus on: (i) improving the business 
environment through regulatory reforms; (ii) strengthening SMEs and supporting institutions; (iii) 
rebuilding financial markets, banks and other financial institutions; and (iv) increasing private sector 
involvement in providing and rebuilding infrastructure. 

74. 
IFC will continue its efforts to promote the development of the Guinean private sector 
through investment climate (IC) and SMEs development programs.  The investment climate program 
which was recently restructured to better focus on top priorities of the private sector reform agenda will 
continue to aim to improve the competitiveness of, and maximize the economic opportunities for, SMEs 
in the mining sector. Concerning SME development, the 3-year Local Supplier Development Program 
(LSDP), which was launched in 2012, aims to enhance the development and transformational impact of 
the Simandou project through increasing local content, creating sustainable local supply chains, and 
developing local skills using the Business Edge™ (BE) product, an IFC training program in management 
and financial skills. 

75. 
IFC will continue to develop a strong AS pipeline to ease access to finance for SMEs in 
Guinea.  IFC plans to establish a risk sharing facility with a local bank that will ease/expand access to 
finance for local SMEs. In parallel, following enactment of a new leasing law in early 2012, IFC is 
working with the Central Bank of Guinea (BCRG) to develop a leasing finance framework aimed at 
promoting leasing as an alternative financing solution for medium- to long-term financing needs. Other 
activities planned in the rest of the pipeline include a regional venture program and the establishment of a 
PPP program to support potential investments opportunities in energy, agribusiness and tourism. 

76. 
There has been encouraging progress in business regulation reforms as measured by the 
2013 Doing Business Report, which ranked Guinea as 178th out of 185 countries. Through the 
MSME Development Support Project recently approved, the Bank will help create new technical centers 
in different regions in support of local MSMEs. 

77. 
Guinea plans to broaden the country’s small and medium enterprise (SME) base through 
investment climate reform, solutions to improve access to finance, and the establishment of SME 
growth corridors. In 2012, IFC supported the creation of an Investment Promotion Agency (APIP) and a 
one-stop shop to facilitate enterprise creation. Two other reform measures were implemented and 
preparation of five other reform measures is currently underway. A Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) 
framework is envisioned, among others, but there is still a long way to go. An IFC supported Local 
Supplier Development Program (LSDP) was launched in September 2012, building upon the results of a 
pilot phase conducted under the “Guinea Linkages Program”, to improve SME capacity. The next phase 
of LSPD aims to expand scope and coverage, as part of the new IFC strategy that will help improve 
access to financial services for SMEs through microfinance and innovative mechanisms such as leasing.  

78. MIGA continues to offer in Guinea all of its core political risk insurance product lines 
(transfer restriction, expropriation, breach of contract, and war and civil disturbance). These 
product lines can be used along with other World Bank products, such as IFC loans to directly support 
government PPPs or IPPs, as has been the case elsewhere in the region. Moreover, through reassuring 
foreign investors with concerns about governance and political risk, MIGA’s product can support the 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

strategic priority of stimulating growth and promoting economic diversification. As a post-conflict and 
IDA country, Guinea is a strategic priority country for MIGA, and MIGA’s strategic goal of supporting 
complex projects in areas such as infrastructure is also consistent with the overall CPS approach. Finally, 
MIGA's Small Investment Products (SIP), which has streamlined procedures for smaller projects, 
targeting SMEs, is also available to investors into the country. MIGA’s currently has an exposure 
US$51.9m in Guinea, supporting a key investment in the telecoms sector. 

79. 
Using the Bank’s competitive advantage and to support the growth of mining related 
investment in the sector, the Bank will propose an instrument toward building a sustainable 
partnership and fostering coordination in sector interventions to achieve greater efficiency and 
effectiveness in the Guinean transport sector. It will provide Guinea with a platform for maintaining 
collaboration with development partners and sustaining the ongoing productive dialogue in the transport 
sector. The proposed operation will address, inter alia: (i) the capacity issues of the ministries in charge 
of transport in terms of the coordination, management, and the legal and regulatory framework of 
transport sub-sectors; (ii) the integration of non-mining freight and passenger services into the on-going 
mining infrastructure developments; and (iii) the design of a sustainable solution for the current transport 
bottleneck issues of the port and the town of Conakry. In addition, the Bank’s support will complement 
EU and AfDB support, as well as support from IDB and Arab states, which is currently largely focused 
on investment projects.  

Strategic Areas of Engagement 3: Strengthening Human Capital 
80. 
Under the third area of engagement, the Bank expects to improve access to basic social services, 
long term improvement in technical skills to meet the demand of Guinea’s diversifying economy, while 
continuing to create short-term support to the vulnerable population through safety nets. 

81. 
The Bank Group will intensify efforts to promote not only quantity but also quality of 
human capital development to tackle education disparities as one of the main determinants of 
poverty (see Section C).  The Bank is currently preparing a comprehensive tertiary education strategy 
and skills assessment to address skills needs for growth and competitiveness focusing on supply and 
demand issues, governance and program diversification to meets the needs of the labor market. The 
results will be used to inform the design of the new skills development project supported by the Bank 
during the proposed CPS period.

82. 
The Bank plans to support the Government improve human capital, with a specific focus on 
upgrading skills to meet the demands of the Guinean economy. The recent Baccalaureate (Bac) results 
show that only 3,190 students passed the scientific Bac and 6,146 passed in mathematics, with an overall 
success rate of 23 percent nationally across all subjects. This highlights a serious problem for a country 
which needs technical and scientific manpower, knowledge and competencies to fully maximize its 
natural resource potential. Predictions indicate that between 52,000 and 100,000 workers will be required 
for the construction phase of the mining sector alone. These figures do not include indirect job creation 

29 

 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

and depend on the number of projects considered (59,500 to 73,500 workers for 7 projects and 85,000 to 
100,000 if all the projects were to be implemented) and the time horizon (52,000 workers for the next 6 
years only). Guinea will need to upgrade the skills of youth, including the large number of unemployed as 
well as recent graduates, to meet the demand of the private sector and extend the benefits of investments 
in natural resources to the population. During the first year of implementation of the CPS, the Bank plans 
to finance a Skills Development operation in support of youth employability in key sectors. During the 
final year of the CPS, emphasis will be given to higher education with a focus on systemic governance 
reforms. Basic education will be a second priority, focusing on equity and quality of learning. 

83. 
To strengthen the lagging human development indicators in Guinea, the Bank will continue 
to be the leading partner in basic education, social protection and health.  In basic education, the 
Bank will start the preparation of a new Basic Education project, funded by the Global Partnership for 
Education for which the Bank has been elected as the supervising entity. The Social Safety Nets project 
will continue to be implemented to provide the government with a clear social protection strategy. At the 
same time, the Bank plans to build on its experience and comparative advantage to support the health 
sector. Health targets will aim at strengthening prevention and capacity to provide services and quality 
care accessible to the entire population to reduce infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition and fight 
against communicable and non-communicable diseases. At the same time, the introduction of Results 
Based Financing (RBF) will support higher cost-effectiveness in the sector contributing to the broader 
governance agenda. The human development program will enable the Bank to contribute to poverty 
reduction through improved basic services, in response to a demand from government and in close 
coordination with partners.  
VI. RISK ASSESSMENT  
84. 
Political uncertainty and weak governance may negatively affect the CPS implementation.   
With repeated delays in the organization of legislative and local elections, the political situation remains 
tense, with frequent urban and communal riots sparking out of every minor incident. The risk that 
political uncertainly, social tensions and a weak governance framework may spill over and impact the 
reform agenda and implementation of the CPS program remains high. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will 
have a hands-on approach to project management and monitoring. In addition, the Bank’s Economic 
Governance TA and Mineral Governance TA operations will help provide needed institutional 
development support to strengthen governance in the mining sector and the public administration. 

85. 
Economic management remains a challenge. Post-HIPC Completion Point, the authorities need 
to improve and sustain the quality of debt management, strengthen their capacity to evaluate Government 
liabilities, maintain sound macroeconomic policies, and transform the business environment. The 
recurrence of external shocks and/or policy slippages as in the past and the resumption of non-
concessional borrowing could lead to the reemergence of unsustainable debt. Further, populist actions 
such as the agreement with the unions in December 2012 over a 50 percent salary increase will be 
difficult to manage before further stabilizing the overall macroeconomic environment. Improving the 
quality of debt management, strengthened capacity to evaluate potential Government liabilities in PPP 
agreements, sound macroeconomic policies, and improvement in the business environment are crucial to 
achieving and maintaining a sustainable debt level. Borrowing by all Government-owned entities must 
remain strictly under control of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to ensure debt-sustainability. For 
the same reason, possible Government participation in mining sector projects is envisaged to be financed 
only by project revenue without recourse to the budget.   

86. 
Exogenous factors (economic shocks and commodity prices). Guinea is exposed to many 
exogenous factors, which include the continued instability in the sub-region and the country’s heavy 
dependence on mining products for export revenue. Historically, such volatility was managed by long-

30 

 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

term contracts at fixed prices for bauxite exports. Exports of gold and iron ore are increasingly important 
export commodities and are less likely to be managed by long-term contracts (such contracts are more 
expensive). The current Bank strategy aims to help Guinea minimize the risks of external shocks by 
strengthening and diversifying its export base. The liberalization of trade, particularly the strengthening of 
regional trade with the ECOWAS is expected to be an important component of this strategy. The current 
regional integration strategy adopted by the Bank through the rising number of regional projects is a good 
way to reduce or contain exogenous shock on a particular country. Furthermore, countries can gain from 
shared experience and reduce potential heavy costs related to those external shocks. For Guinea, 
integrating Bank’s project within the Mano River Union is a viable strategy to encourage regional 
integration and increase the role of the country in the sub-region. 

87. 
Finally, the financing risk linked to the availability of IDA resources should be considered. 
While the anticipated allocation is based on a conservative estimate, which is based on Guinea’s current 
CPIA rating of 3.0, the inability to secure the anticipated amounts would necessitate scaling down the 
overall level of engagement or changing program priorities proposed in the CPS.

Annex 2: Guinea Country Assistance Strategy (2003-2006)  
and Interim Strategy Note (FY11-FY12) Completion Report 

Context and Objectives of the CAS 

1. 
The World Bank’s 2003-2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Guinea was designed to 
anchor on the country’s First Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) pillars of fostering sustainable 
and equitable growth, improving access and quality to basic services, and strengthening governance and 
institutional and human capacity. The CAS focused on supporting selected economic and sector work, a 
structural adjustment operation, and second phases of existing adaptable program loans to foster growth, 
improve access to social services, and strengthen capacity and governance.  

2. 
 The initial 2003-2006 CAS-period was going to be a period of transition required mainly to 
strengthen Guinea's fiduciary arrangements in public finance management and institutional framework for 
service delivery. The Bank’s Program was to move gradually towards more programmatic support by 
assisting Guinea to reform its institutional and policy framework, build its capacity for service delivery, 
and improve the management of public finances so that the country’s national institutions are able to 
effectively implement its development programs. To support this transition, the Bank and other donors 
planned to gradually move away from projects, to prepare the various sectors for a more programmatic 
approach. To the extent that satisfactory public expenditure and fiduciary arrangements would be in place, 
the Bank also considered moving towards future support through poverty reduction support credits. 

3. 
The political instability which afflicted Guinea during the 2000s thwarted the authorities’ efforts 
to implement the First Poverty Reduction Strategy covering 2002-2006 (PRSP-I), the basis of the Bank’s 
CAS under review. As a result, the government issued a second PRSP (PRSP-II) covering 2007-2010 in 
August 2007, building on the lessons learnt from the unsuccessful implementation of the PRSP-I. In 
2010, the authorities decided to extend implementation of the PRSP-II to allow more time for progress on 
key indicators, especially as the period 2008-10 had been affected by numerous adverse shocks, chief 
among which is continued political instability.  

4. 
The Bank’s 2003-2006 CAS period was never closed, owing partially to a suspension hiatus from 
December 2008 to April 2011 following a military coup. The resumption of the Bank’s activities in 2011 
was guided by an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY11-12 which outlined a Bank re-engagement 
strategy in Guinea with the aim to support the Government’s plan for the period. The Bank pledged to 
support macroeconomic stabilization and help Government to reach the HIPC completion point rapidly by 
providing budget support and technical assistance, with a special focus on the areas of public financial 
management, public administration, the security sector, and mining. The Bank also committed to support 
a major push to boost the delivery of social services and the creation of jobs to help deliver tangible quick 
wins to the citizens. This was to be done by using the existing portfolio, creating a few select new 
projects, and leveraging new sources of finance. The Bank’s emphasis was going to be placed on 
strengthening civil society and social accountability mechanisms and on accelerating regional integration. 
Significant progress under the ISN was expected to lead to a full Country Assistance Strategy, at the end 
of the ISN period. 

5. 
The Bank’s performance is considered to be moderately unsatisfactory because, while some of 
the Bank supported programs achieved results, many were not successful, with a few are still under 
implementation for more than 8 years.  

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

Progress towards Guinea’s Long-term Development Outcomes 

6. 
In tracking progress towards fostering sustainable and equitable growth, it is notable that 
Guinea’s performance has been erratic with economic growth strongly decelerating since 2008, to 
become negative in per capita terms. Cumulatively, GDP per capita declined by 4.6 percent between 2008 
and 2010. While agriculture continued to grow modestly, the mining sector - historically a major driver of 
growth contracted in real terms by 6 percent between 2008 and 2010 in spite of rising world commodity 
prices. The regulatory business environment worsened with the cancellations of contracts in the mining 
sector, changes of license terms and conditions in the telecommunications sector, on the one hand and 
political uncertainty in the context of deteriorated security situation on the other. In contrast, the 
construction sector benefited from the large fiscal expansion recorded in 2009-10. The incidence of 
poverty also increased, from 49 percent in 2002 to 58 percent in 2010. Recent poverty data from the 
2012 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire survey show that 55 percent of the population continue to 
live below the poverty line, compared to 53 percent in 2007 when a similar survey was conducted.  

7. 
Second, during the review period the delivery of access and quality to basic services suffered as a 
result of the budget crunch, under-paid civil servants, and faltering decentralization. Health services are 
in a serious state of decay. Government spending on health (excluding external assistance) is dismally 
low, having decreased from less than 1 percent of GDP in 1993 to 0.2 percent in 2010. Chronic 
malnutrition in 2007 was 36 percent up from the previous survey in 2002. Less than 16 percent of the 
population consulted health care workers even though 56 percent had access to services according to the 
same survey. Malaria remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children. The infant 
mortality rate is 101 per 1,000 (2004) and the maternal mortality rate is one the highest in Africa at 740 
per 100,000. Among those accessing services, only slightly over half expressed satisfaction. The HIV 
prevalence rate is low relative for the region, estimated at 1.6 percent. The government is pursuing a 
policy of free access to anti-retroviral drugs but so far, public resources were not in place to finance this 
policy. 

8. 
The recent crisis also had negative effects on education. The gross enrollment rate has stagnated 
at around 79 percent since 2007 (86 percent was expected in 2010), and for girls, at around 70 percent. In 
the rural areas, the rate has remained at around 60 percent over the same period. Dropout rate however 
shot up from 5.9 percent in 2007 to 11.6 percent in 2010, and as a result, the primary completion rate fell 
to 57 percent in 2010.  Enrollment in secondary schools has also remained flat at about 44 and 25 percent 
GER respectively for secondary 1 and 2 since 2007. The Technical and vocational education and training 
including post-primary cycle is very weak: in 2008, the overall enrollment in this sub-sector was less than 
6,000 students. Sector inefficiencies seem to have risen, especially in expenditure management and 
planning with more than 90 percent of primary and secondary education recurrent expenditures spent on 
salaries. It is widely suspected that public employment, especially in education, is rife with ghost workers 
and double dippers. 

9. 
Third, progress towards strengthening governance and institutional and human capacity fell short 
of expectations, as a result of years of institutional neglect, authoritarian rule, predatory behavior on the 
part of senior government officials and civil servants alike and ethnic tensions. The Ibrahim Index on 
African Governance ranks Guinea 42nd out of 52 African countries, reflecting a judicial system that has 
been weakened by political interference and corruption. Transparency International reports that 
Guinea, over the past several years, ranked at the bottom of the scale in terms of perceptions of corruption 
- in 2011, it was ranked 164 out of 178 countries. A central component of this state of affairs is the 
weakness of the state. The decaying public administration has lost many of its core skills. After years of 
under-investment and institutional neglect, the public administration requires significant attention in order 
to become an effective agent for the country’s rebirth. Serious inconsistencies between the payroll and 

38 

 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

personnel data plague the public service pointing to the existence of large abuse and irregularities in the 
payroll.  

Program Performance 

10. 
The CAS Completion Report focuses on the core CAS benchmarks identified for assessing 
Bank’s performance. However, the review period spans from 2003 to 2012, therefore including the FY11-
FY12 ISN period as well. At the ISN stage and to align the interim strategy with Guinea’s new political 
and economic context, three projects were dropped from the previous CAS program, including the 
Structural Adjustment Credit, the Water Support Program, the First PRSC and the Second CBSD; as well 
as the Investment Climate Policy note. This was in line with the Bank’s new focus devoted to 
stabilization and economic governance, and the need to clear US$74 million of arrears, a precondition to 
resuming Bank activities as well as that of the IMF and other donors.  Furthermore, program Results 
missing any supporting instrument during the period have been dropped. 

Promoting Sustainable and Equitable Growth 

11. 
To support sustainable and equitable growth, the Bank planned to carry out analytical work and 
contribute to (a) fostering macroeconomic stability; (b) improving the investment climate through 
assistance for establishment of minimum infrastructure services required for growth; (c) supporting policy 
reforms in fisheries, agriculture, mining, and trade; and (d) improving rural services. These actions were 
expected to help Guinea achieve an annual GDP growth rate of 5.8 percent (8 percent rural areas) by 
2005. 

12. Macroeconomic stability. The Bank delivered only partially on supporting this first pillar of the 
Government’s PRSP.  The structural adjustment operation (FY04) which was planned to cover policy 
reforms in tax administration, mining and trade, and including various activities to strengthen Guinea's 
public expenditures and fiduciary framework did not materialize. However, in 2011 as part of the re-
engagement effort and to contribute to one of the two objectives of the ISN, namely the consolidation of 
national reconciliation through building state capacity and increasing accountability, the Bank prepared a 
Reengagement and Reform Program which was rated moderately satisfactory at completion. It aimed to 
strengthen financial management, efficiency and accountability in the public sector and to increase 
transparency in the mining.  

13. 
Improving rural services. The Bank also delivered on the planned rural infrastructure program 
(FY04) and the second phase of the Urban Program (FY05) in the CAS. However, both projects 
(P065127 and P091297) are still under implementation following restructuring. The former, which closes 
on June 30, 2013, is currently rated moderately unsatisfactory in overall implementation progress, with a 
disbursement lag of 37.83% or 62 months. The two Global Environmental Facility-supported projects in 
support of the sustainable management of natural resources were delivered and are still under 
implementation. Both are rated moderately satisfactory in overall implementation progress.  

Improving Access and Quality to Basic Services 

14. 
To support increasing equitable access to social services, the CAS planned to strengthen the 
Bank’s analytical base in support of (a) empowering urban and rural people, their local governments, and 
their organizations; and (b) strengthening service delivery in specific priority sectors (health, education, 
fight against HIV/AIDS, and water resource management). To that end the proposed efforts in the CAS 
anticipated a second phase of the then existing health program (FY04). Hypothetically, the Bank also 
suggested provision of budget support to complement the ongoing support to social sectors (the Education 
for All program, and the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS program). 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

15. 
Service delivery. The Multisectoral AIDS Program (P073378), designed to increase HIV/AIDS 
knowledge and low risks behaviors and to improve the coverage and the use of HIV/AIDS prevention, 
care treatment and support services, scored a moderately satisfactory rating at closing. The Education for 
All program which is still ongoing, is currently rated moderately satisfactory. It aims to establish a stable 
framework for good quality universal primary education. 

Strengthening Governance and Institutional and Human Capacity 

16. 
In support to governance strengthening and institutional and human capacity building, the CAS 
planned to build capacity in its broadest sense, creating conditions for effective use of existing capacity 
(public and private sectors, and civil society) to deliver basic services to the poor in rural and urban areas. 
To achieve this, the CAS planned to focus on cross-sectoral generic issues relating to institutional 
transformation, with the ultimate goal of transforming the public sector agencies from organizations 
focusing on bureaucratic control-which hinders service delivery and provides opportunities for rent 
seeking, patronage, and corruption-to organizations supporting public and private service delivery to the 
poor. Through the CAS, the Bank planned to focus on: (a) establishing the analytical base to support the 
government's actions to strengthen governance; (b) transforming cross-cutting national institutions and 
service delivery agencies; and (c) strengthening mechanisms of accountability to ensure that local 
government is accountable to citizens, and operates in a transparent and participatory way. In addition, the 
Bank planned to support developing statistical capacity to allow adequate monitoring and evaluation of 
the PRSP implementation. 

17. 
Programs such as the Community Support Program and the Urban Program that involved strong 
participation of beneficiaries have done somehow well in improving the quality of services and poor 
people's access to these services. Such programs have also promoted gender equity, since many of the 
community-identified priorities have involved measures improving the quality of women's lives, such as 
maternal health services, better access to drinking water and agricultural services. These efforts also 
allowed the Bank to have a decisive impact on governance at the local level. The Bank’s close 
relationship with civil society was also helpful in creating the momentum for change which ultimately led 
to the first free and peaceful elections in Guinea. 

Results Rating 

18. 
The CAS Completion report rates the achievement of results foreseen in the CAS as moderately 
unsatisfactory.  In the absence of a proper results framework, the team proposed core CAS benchmarks to 
assess Bank’s performance. Factoring in the limited context of limited information the Bank had pledged, 
during the CAS period, to support the strengthening of the knowledge base and of statistical capacity, 
which was going to allow establishing a stronger baseline of the various benchmarks, especially in the 
area of strengthened governance and institutional capacity, and measuring the progress over the CAS 
implementation period.  Guinea’s statistical system continues to face major shortcomings including poor 
coordination between producers and users. Persistent weaknesses are noted in terms of regularity and 
timeliness of publications, modeling tools for forecasting and simulation tools for impact to better 
understand the impacts of macroeconomic policies at the micro level (on households and enterprises). In 
addition, the national statistical system is still confronted with the absence of methodological documents 
on standards, classifications, procedures for the collection, processing, analysis and data dissemination.  

Bank Performance, Design and Relevance 

19. 
To reach its objectives, the 2003-2006 CAS proposed a three pronged-program, comprising (a) 
ongoing activities; (b) new analytical work, building on the existing knowledge base; and (c) new lending 
operations. At the time the portfolio comprised eight projects representing a total commitment of 
US$215.6 million in IDA allocations and US$20.3 million in grants.  

40 

 
 
 
WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

20. 
The design of the CAS was in sync with the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, in that the 
CAS’s pillars were mirrored against those of the PRSP. It was inspired by lessons learned from what 
worked and what did not work under the previous CAS, feedback from consultations (Government and 
civil society) and the client feedback survey completed a few years before. The CAS was designed to ease 
the transition required mainly to strengthen Guinea's fiduciary arrangements in public finance 
management and institutional framework for service delivery. To support this transition, the Bank (and 
other donors) planned to gradually move away from projects, to prepare the various sectors for a more 
programmatic approach. To the extent that satisfactory public expenditure and fiduciary arrangements 
would be in place, the Bank also considered moving towards future support through poverty reduction 
support credits. 

21. 
Several years through the period of the 2003-2006 CAS and many years afterwards, it is hard to 
attribute the poor performance of the Bank’s program to design failings more than it is to the gradual 
weakening of the state, weak institutional environment, and political instability in Guinea. 

22. 
Concerning the Bank’s reengagement activities, they were sequenced in time, with the more 
urgent areas receiving more support in the early period in 20011. This included 9 projects that supported 
improved service delivery in maternal health and basic education, and stimulating agriculture and rural 
development. Re-activating the portfolio involved overall 11 retroactive extensions of closing dates and 
six level 1 or 2 restructurings. The restructurings were devised in ways to improve disbursement rates, 
tighten fiduciary controls, make the projects more participatory, and more generally, more adapted to the 
current circumstances at the time. Following a comprehensive fiduciary review of the portfolio, existing 
operations were assessed as being ready for a resumption of activities. All projects were also submitted to 
the required audit reports. During the ISN period, the portfolio was simplified and organized around the 
three key clusters of economic governance, jobs, and decentralized services.  

Implementation 

23. 
The Bank’s support to Guinea’s the PRSP implementation was manifested through its lending 
program and analytical and advisory services proposed in the CAS. By supporting the PRSP 
implementation, the Bank also aimed to support Guinea in achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), which are consistent with the PRSP objectives. Hence, the Bank’s support to the 
implementation of the PRSP was to focus on governance, transformation of country institutions, and 
empowerment of beneficiaries.  

24. 
The delivery of AAA activities followed neither the planned timeline, nor the sector focus the 
AAAs were originally designed for. Only three non-lending activities were delivered during the original 
CAS period: Integrated trade framework diagnostic, Guinea integration and competitiveness study, and 
strengthening public procurement. The IDF grant for accountancy was started, but did not complete. 
However, additional analytical and/or advisory services activities were carried during the broader span of

WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR GUINEA: FY2014-17 

Bank Performance Rating 

25. 
The Completion Report ranks the Bank’s performance as moderately unsatisfactory. 
Summary Findings and Recommendations 

26. 
A favorable political environment that provides the power base, incentives and commitment to 
implement difficult reforms is paramount. Understanding the political economy of reform and 
anticipating opposition needs to inform project planning. In a country where policy decisions are highly 
centralized, the Bank should be prepared to elevate sectoral policy dialogue at the highest level and to 
integrate sectoral reforms in the macro policy dialogue. The Bank should also be prepared to wait for 
policy decisions to materialize at the preparation stage, before committing funding for investments even if 
investment levels are relatively modest.  

27. 
Strengthening accountability mechanisms has been a key element of ensuring some level of 
impact to donor financed activities in an environment where traditional institutional counterparts revealed 
themselves to be unresponsive. Those initiatives whose reach went beyond the traditional institutional 
partners fared better than those who did not. 

28. 
Community participation is central to reaching tangible results. Programs which involved 
participation of beneficiaries (e.g. the Community Support Program and the Urban Program) that tend to 
do better in terms of improving the quality of services and poor people's access to these services. Such 
programs also seem better fitted for promoting gender equity, better access to drinking water and 
agricultural services.  

29. 
Choosing lending instruments, consideration should be given to the specific sector objectives and 
the overall institutional environment of the sector.  While certain instruments (such as adjustable program 
lending (APLs)) were seen as innovative in addressing previously identified weaknesses in traditional 
project lending, financing was not always adequate to complete all activities planned in each phase. 
Without presumed recourse to the subsequent phase, triggers become less meaningful and there’s a risk of 
incomplete activities.  

30. 
Regarding design and preparation assessment of some Bank financed projects has shown that 
engagement with the borrower during preparation should ensure that those involved are motivated by 
providing the best assessment of the country’s needs and the likely capacity of the implementing agencies 
to take on the responsibilities of executing the project. Also, there tend to be clear advantages from 
keeping the design of the operations simple and well-focused on the Government priorities. Of equal 
importance in this chapter are representation and voice of prime beneficiaries: local authorities and 
communities should play a crucial role in the design and implementation of such projects and be 
represented in the oversight committee. 

31. 
The involvement of the private sector, including beneficiary and producer organizations, in 
service delivery helps increase the quality of services. For example, in one survey, beneficiaries of the 
Community Support Program have expressed increased satisfaction with services. Garbage collection in 
Conakry has improved under the Urban Program through subcontracting of the services to private 
organizations. Working with the private sector will be particularly important in the future given the very 
low level of capacity in the public sector.

Partially Achieved 
• The Government made good 
progress in restoring basic fiscal 
discipline. 
• The government has also launched 
an in depth reform of the legal and 
regulatory framework for public 
finances. 
Partially Achieved 
• 330 km of labor based road works

1. Legal and regulatory framework of the sector needs to 
be improved to promote private sector involvement in 
infrastructure (ports and railways).  
2. Despite Government’s efforts and donors’ involvement 
in the sector, effective road management has been 
stymied by the lack of an overall network management 
plan, and inadequate and irregular maintenance funding. 
The Government will need to raise its game in order to 
regulate significant investments (Roads, Rail, and Ports) 
which are expected over the next 10 years from the 
mining sector.

Partially Achieved 
• About one million people benefit 
from the sludge treatment facilities 
and more than 200,000 people are 
connected to the sewerage network 
in the Kaloum area. 
• The Supplemental Credit introduced 
additional specific objectives as 
follows: (i) improve sanitary 
conditions in the Kaloum district of 
Conakry by increasing access to 
sewer services; and (ii) Reduce 
pollution of the marine ecosystem 
from wastewater discharge and 
septage dumping. 

Outcome 1: improve Guinea’s 
urban and rural water resource 
management (WRM)  
Outcome 2: build institutional 
capacity by strengthening the 
National Directorate of 
Hydraulics (Direction 
nationale de l’hydraulique, 
DNH), developing activities in 
urban water distribution and 
increase coverage in Conakry 
by 100 percent and to increase 
metered connections by 100 
percent. 
Outcome 3: rehabilitate and 
extend Conakry’s sewerage and 
contribute to improvements in 
environmental quality through 
construction, rehabilitation and 
extension of the existing 
network, training to private 
local contractors for pit 
emptying and sewage 
management. 

Lessons and Suggestions for new CAS 

1. A strong and continuous political will is as essential for 
consolidating and deepening reforms, as for initiating 
them. In a country where policy decisions are highly 
centralized, the Bank should be prepared to elevate 
sectoral policy dialogue at the highest level and to 
integrate sectoral reforms in the macro policy dialogue. 
2. The Bank should also be prepared to wait for policy 
decisions to materialize at the preparation stage, before 
committing funding for investments even if investment 
levels are relatively modest.  
3. Donor coordination in supporting and deepening reforms 
in the water sector is critical for the Government to 
remain on track and sustain commitment to reform. Lack 
of co/parallel financing and ability for donors’ action in 
the country to support the deepening of the previous 
reform in the water sector didn't help cement the 
development of a strengthened partnership in the 
Guinean's urban water supply that culminated with 
performances that were lower than during the previous 
project.  
4. The Bank's supplemental financing did not help to 
strengthen the reform process and actually gave the 
wrong signal to the Government. The concept of 
Supplemental Financing put too much emphasis on 
technical aspects and cost control and failed to address 
the bigger picture of sector development and 
sustainability.

Outcome 2: promote the 
adoption of renewable energy 
technology by removing 
barriers and thus mitigate CO2

Outcome 1: The Project seeks 
to improve the electricity 
sector's commercial and 
operational efficiency.  
Outcome 2: The project 
contributes to reduction of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions by addressing the 
large inefficiencies in the

Partially Achieved  
• Out of a target of 30 villages, the 
Project has already electrified 24 
villages, but only 60% of 
households originally targeted for 
electrification have been reached so 
far on average.  
• In 4 villages (out of the 24), power 
is not being supplied due to either 
social conflicts related to the project 
or to management deficiencies by 
the private operator.  
• The decentralized rural 
electrification model, based on SME 
participation, has proven viable and 
undoubtedly superior to the business 
as usual scenario (relying on the 
state-utility EDG to provide 
electricity in rural and peri-urban 
areas).  
Partially achieved (on-going project)

Guinée (OECA-G) to monitor 
and improve the quality of the 
accountancy and auditing 
services provided by private 
Guinean firms and significantly 
reduce quality control issues. 

Outcome 2: build capacity of 
the Guinean Government and 
key stakeholders to improve 
governance and transparency in 
the management of the 
country’s mineral resources in a 
participatory way. This would 
be achieved through the 
strengthening of Government’s 
ability to negotiate stable and 
fair investment agreements, 
which would contribute to 
economic development at the 
national, regional and local 
levels; and through the 
development of a sound and 
transparent revenue 
management framework.  

Partially achieved (on-going project) 
• At least one contract negotiated using 
the newly drafted standard 
agreement. 
• Supervision committee formed and 
EITI templates adapted to Guinean 
conditions.  
• Guinea surpassed this indicator and 
was expected to produce its second 
report by June 2008.

Annex 6: Summary of Gender Portfolio Review 

1. 
The Government of the Republic of Guinea recognizes that in order to meet its development 
challenges it is critical that both women and men are able to contribute to a benefit from economic 
and social development.  The government’s latest PRSP has a separate section on the promotion of 
gender equality and also mainstreams gender throughout much of the rest of the document. Attention to 
gender issues is particularly visible with regard to the following areas: education, social protection, health 
(including reproductive health and women’s vulnerability to HIV/AIDS), and women’s agricultural 
productivity/contribution to household food security. The PRSP sets out its commitment to gender issues, 
stating that “the promotion of women with a view toward full participation in decision-making processes 
at all levels is an integral part of the government’s development policy and one of its priority areas”. The 
government’s commitment to gender is also demonstrated with its publication of a national gender 
strategy (GoG, 2011), and a national strategy against gender-based violence (GoG, 2010).

2. 
The World Bank believes that the integration of gender objectives and indicators into the 
CPS and its Results Framework is the most effective way to maximize the accountability of the 
Bank for achieving gender outcomes and to highlight and learn from those outcomes. The start of a 
new CPS period now presents the Bank with the opportunity to put this strategy into practice. Integrating 
gender into the CPS, particularly into the Results Framework, will allow the Bank to: (1) ensure clarity of 
purpose in the overall gender-related objectives of the country portfolio; (2) ensure alignment with the 
priorities of the Government of Guinea; (3) highlight progress; and (4) ensure effective accountability of 
the CMU for achieving such progress. 

3. 
 The main focus of this review is the portfolio of 11 IDA projects 13 – the review finds that 45 
percent (5 out of 11) of the IDA portfolio is gender-informed in at least one of the following 
dimensions: (1) analysis; (2) actions; (3) M&E.  This review also looks at a number of trust-funded 
and AAA activities and finds that 25 and 43 percent of these respectively are gender-informed (see 
annex 1 for a matrix of key project review comments).  The portfolio is supporting the following 
gender-related outcomes: improved access to basic infrastructure and services; reduced gender 
inequalities in education; improved understanding of the impact of cash transfers as a tool for increasing 
girls’ school enrollment/attendance; improved life skills and knowledge of essential family practices 
(EFP); improved delivery of maternal health care; increased productivity, incomes, and food security for 
rural women; increased representation of women in teaching positions; Increased employment 

13 The focus of the review is on IDA because the World Bank’s corporate targets and guidelines on the integration of 
gender are specific to IDA projects (i.e. not including AAA or Trust Funds). 

61 

 
 
 
 
                                                      
opportunities for women through public works; Increased representation of women in local rural 
governments; and increased participation of women in demand for good governance in the mining sector. 

4. 
This review proposes the following gender vision for the CPS: The vision of the FY14-17 CPS 
is to increase the proportion of IDA projects that are rated as gender-informed from 45 percent to at least 
60 percent (the IDA16 minimum target) and to make the same commitment to the portfolio of AAA 
activities. The CPS will demonstrate the country team’s commitment to achieving these objectives by 
specifically including the proportion of gender-informed IDA projects as an indicator in the CPS Results 
Framework. The specific actions that the CMU will focus on in order to achieve greater gender 
integration in the portfolio will include: (1) Increasing the use of gender analysis to inform operations and 
encouraging project teams to be more explicit in illustrating how gender analysis/an understanding of the 
relevant gender issues influenced the design of project activities; (2) Improving the availability of existing 
country level gender analysis (in order to achieve objective 1) by encouraging greater attention to gender 
in AAA work . Any gender-focused AAA work could take advantage of new data from the 2012 Core 
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey; (3) Improving the explicit integration of gender into 
infrastructure sector operations, so that activities take account of women’s and men’s specific and 
differing infrastructure needs and vulnerabilities and maximize positive gender synergies between 
different sectors (e.g. in the case of transport - access to health care, access to markets, access to 
employment through public works, access to schools, and reduced time poverty); (4) Ensuring that 
projects which use participatory approaches are more specific in outlining the exact mechanisms to be 
used to ensure that both women and men are able to participate effectively (both in terms of numbers and 
in terms of the qualitative level of their engagement) – and ensuring that projects also recognize that 
women’s participation alone is not sufficient to ensure that activities are gender sensitive. 

5. 
The CPS will focus on the following broad objective areas, drawn from the gender 
objectives highlighted in the latest PRSP and the National Gender Policy, and based on the review 
of the Bank’s current portfolio of activities in Guinea - these objectives will be reflected (in line with 
PRMGE’s step 3 for integrating gender into the CPS) with relevant indicators in the CPS results 
framework (see annex 3): 
(1) Improved basic infrastructure and services, creating cross-sector synergies and lifting barriers to 
women’s and men’s economic participation, access to health care, and access to education. 
(2) Reduced gender inequalities in education 
(3) Improved maternal and reproductive health and improved knowledge for women and men of 
HIV/AIDS and other life-skills issues 
(4) Improved agricultural livelihoods for women through improvements in productivity, food 
security, and livelihoods diversification 
(5) Improved participation of women in local governance and in the governance of the mining sector  
Figure 1 (see below) presents a brief overview of the Guinea portfolio in the form a SWOT analysis. 
However, it should be pointed out that the points listed here, along with the analysis provided in the 
remainder of this review, should be discussed with project TTLs and other key staff. This review was 
conducted with only minimal input from TTLs and project documents cannot provide as complete and 
accurate a picture as consultation with implementing staff.

Strengths 

Figure 1: SWOT Analysis of Guinea Gender Portfolio 

Weaknesses 

• 
• 

Strong attention to gender in health and education sectors 
Three projects have plans to conduct gender-sensitive 
impact 
evaluations, which will provide valuable 
knowledge on the effectiveness of interventions related to 
the health sector, the mining sector, and cash transfers.  

Opportunities 

• 

• 
• 

Only 45 percent of current IDA operations are gender-
informed 
Low integration of gender in infrastructure projects 
Low use of gender analysis across most projects. 
Where gender analysis is included, it is often cursory 
and without clear links between the analysis and 
project actions. 
No attention to gender issues in legal rights and their 
implementation  
No attention to GBV 
Attention to women’s economic opportunities could be 
strengthened  
Threats 

• 
• 

• 

• 

Lack of clarity in the government’s gender strategy will 
require the Bank team to be especially focused and 
well-informed if it is to successfully identify and 
address the most critical gender issues. 

• 

• 

In the absence of a recent Country Gender Assessments, a 
gender-sensitive analysis of 2012 CWIQ survey results 
could provide useful inputs for operations. 
• With better attention to gender issues, the portfolio’s 
infrastructure projects offer an excellent opportunity to 
make significant contributions to women’s economic 
opportunities, health, and time-poverty. 
• Many projects attempt some form of participatory 
process, yet there is a lack of attention to gender. 
Participatory mechanisms could be easily adapted to 
ensure that women are specifically identified as a target 
group. 
The Community-Based Land Management Project and 
the Second Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support 
Project present opportunities to improve the inclusion of 
women in the management of water, land and other 
natural resources. 
Given the Bank’s previous experience of integrating 
gender in extractive industries work, there should be 
plenty of lessons that could be used to further strengthen 
the Mineral Governance Support Project 
The pipeline Integrated Growth Centers project (not 
included in this review) should increase the gender rating 
of the portfolio, will add to the body of 
impact 
evaluations, and could provide useful inputs to inform 
work related to women’s economic opportunities - it plans 
to test the effect of the project on the incomes of women-
owned SMSEs.

“When thinking about how the Wor ld Bank can have the most impac t on deve lopment re sults Guinea, in 
which sec toral areas do you be lieve the Wor ld Bank should focus most of its attention and re source s in 
Guinea?  (Choose no more than THREE)” 
(Re spondents chose from a list.  Re sponse s combined.)

1. 
Overall alignment with perceived development priorities: Stakeholders are very clear on what 
they perceive to be the most critical development priorities in Guinea. These include energy (nearly sixty 
percent of respondents reported that this is the most critical contributor to growth while forty percent 
noted that it is the country’s top development priority), education, and public sector governance.  Rural 
and agriculture development are also seen as vitally important in reducing poverty in the country. 

Stakeholders report that the development areas that would benefit most from Bank involvement in terms 
of resources (and knowledge) are aligned with the expressed priorities, and include education; energy and 
governance are identified as key areas for Bank emphasis.  

2. 
Perceptions of how the Bank operates on the ground: Stakeholders appear quite satisfied with 
many aspects of the Bank’s work in Guinea.  These include monitoring and evaluations, using country 
systems when available, follow through over time, increasing institutional capacity, and collaboration 
with government and donors.  In addition, research suggests that the Bank is viewed as very relevant and 
aligned with development priorities on the ground, with a very well prepared staff. 

64 

 
 
 
As we see in surveys conducted in other fragile and conflict affected states, the Bank’s speed is of 
greatest concern to stakeholders in Guinea.  This appears to be related to disbursement of funds.  Related 
to this, when asked what the Bank’s greatest weakness is, respondents point equally to the speed of 
processes, bureaucracy and technocratic approach in the face of political realities.  In addition, as in other 
FCS countries, ratings for the Bank’s responsiveness are relatively low (when compared to all other 
ratings of the Bank’s work).  This may be worth further discussion and exploration.   

3. 
Increasing the value of the Bank in Guinea: One message that emerges clearly from the data is 
the perceived need for the Bank to reach out to greater groups in an environment where stakeholders 
report (a full fifty percent) that in the greatest obstacle to reform is inadequate levels of citizen 
participation.  In fact, nearly fifty percent (a plurality) of respondents say that the top way to increase the 
value of the Bank on the ground in Guinea is to reach out beyond government to other groups.  

There is also significant room for the Bank to work more actively in the area of capacity development in 
Guinea (seen in other FCS countries as well).  Nearly half of respondents note that the primary obstacle to 
reform is government inefficiency. Nearly forty percent of stakeholders say that capacity building/training 
are the Bank’s greatest or second greatest value in the country (financial resources are of greatest value).  
In addition a majority of respondents say that the most effective instrument in Guinea is capacity 
development (equal to those who identify investment lending as the Bank’s most effective instrument). 

Finally, research indicates that stakeholders believe that the Bank’s clear comparative advantage is related 
to building capacity (in particular of state institutions), and related, strengthening public financial 
management. This aligns well with stakeholders’ view that the most important area for the Bank to 
emphasize in its knowledge is governance/reform (in contrast, stakeholders believe other donors are best 
positioned to lead in stimulating dialogue to promote peace and stability).  

4. 
Communication: In a country where half of the respondents report that they are still using dial 
up for access to the internet, it is not surprising that workshops and conferences are the preferred source 
of information from the Bank (55%) followed by direct contact. This will evolve, most probably, as 
technology improves, but for now it is important to recognize that substantive interaction is a critical 
aspect of outreach in Guinea in terms of information and knowledge sharing.

Annex 8: Addressing Fragility across World Bank Portfolio in Guinea 

1. Fragility as a cross-cutting issue  

Fragility can be addressed through the projects of each sector of the portfolio by adapting program design 
and implementation. At a minimum, project design should take a ‘do no harm’ approach, recognizing the 
potential drivers of fragility in localities or faced by beneficiaries of the projects.  
The country portfolio as a whole can be leveraged to address the drivers of fragility by embedding a 
conflict-sensitive, peace-building approach into project design and management. Specific design and 
management elements could include the following: 

• Generating tangible and visible outputs and outcomes: to address the short-term drivers of 
conflict related to a breakdown in citizen-state relations, projects should be designed in such a 
way that they generate tangible results that can be seen by all levels of society.  
• Labor intensive project design and management:  
o For public works this would mean using methods that use laborers for building, road, 
bridges, drainage and infrastructure. In urban environments this could also include 
municipal services such as waste management and repair and maintenance of urban 
facilities. The same can be said for the development of infrastructure in other sectors such 
as Health and Education. 
o Projects that use participatory and consultative processes can generate livelihood 
opportunity by generating the need for local level facilitators 
o Labor intensive methods for survey and other data collection as well as third party 
monitoring of projects should also be considered.  
• Participatory and consultative decision making processes for decisions related to projects: 
Where appropriate, projects implemented at local level need to be designed to be participatory, 
consultative and transparent as possible. In practice, this would mean budgeting for an increased 
number of public consultations throughout the projects as well as in a high-visibility public 
information campaign.  
• Complaints handling: projects should have extremely robust systems to receive and manage 
complaints from all levels of society. Systems would need to take into account literacy levels in 
areas of implementation and should also consider having a local ombudsman.  
• Conflict risk monitoring and management: project design should include regular monitoring of 
the social impact of the project and mechanisms to respond immediately to any potential risk of 
conflict generated by the project 
• Maintaining flexibility to respond to situation on the ground: the design of projects should 
include the ability to respond quickly. Examples could include a zero budget line item for 
emergency response that can be triggered if conflicts arise, distribution of work amongst multiple 
implementing agencies in order that work can be shifted between them if situations arise that 
affect implementation 
• Embed learning and knowledge transfer into project design: By ensuring the trajectory of 
project implementation includes activities to capture lessons innovative practices can be 
transferred to other projects. 
Increasing visibility of state actors: In areas where fragility is driven by an acute lack of 
confidence in the state, projects should consider how state involvement in the project is 
communicated as a means to re-establish confidence. 

• 

2. Dedicated Program for Supporting the CT to Address Fragility  

As well as implementing an approach to building stability that cuts across all sectors, a standalone 
program could be developed. This would introduce interventions specifically targeted at peace-building 

66 

 
 
 
 
and increasing stability. The program would also put in place dedicated experts and resources within the 
Country Management Team to support other sector teams to address the drivers of fragility. The basic 
outline of such a program is provided below for illustrative purposes. 

1. 
Program Objective: Increased stability is achieved by reconciliation between state and citizens 
and the establishment of platforms for peaceful public and collective expression. 

2. 

Program Activities: 
• Projects targeted at building stability 
o Creating platforms for public debate – working to build capacities of CSO to act as a 
channel for public expression – this work is already addressed in the Public Sector 
Governance project but could be expanded. The INGO, Search for Common Ground, that 
is contracted by the Government’s reform agency (HCREMA) could be engaged for work 
beyond the scope of the project, to include general public outreach. Alternatively, the 
scope of the project could be increased with additional funds from the State and Peace-
building Fund SPF. 
• Country Team Support: Support to sector teams for addressing fragility and conflict in sector 
work – provision of expertise to task teams to support better integration of stability activities in a 
cross-cutting manner across the portfolio. 
• Fragility monitoring – liaison with other partners, data collection and monitoring to understand 
fragility and conflict dynamics across the country and consider their implication for the portfolio 
• Regular coordination with development partners 

3. 

Management of the Stability Program 
• Oversight by TTL (Suggest TTL of Public Sector Accountability Project, Alexandre Arrobio) 
• Daily management by ETC with specialist knowledge on Guinea and state and peace-building 
expertise, supported by an ETT (to be hired) 
• Regular coordination meetings with peace-building focal point from each sector team 
• Regular coordination meetings with CMU 

4. 

Funding the Program 

Sources of funding:  
• Korean Trust Fund: Operational budget to fund TTL time, ETC and ETT and analytical work, 
including fragility monitoring, impact evaluation and development of a baseline. This could also 
fund further consultations with government and civil society actors for project design  (maximum 
budget US $450,000) 
• State and Peace-building Fund (SPF): Funds to support task teams to adapt projects and TA for 
the Government where necessary 
• Bank budget – it will be necessary to identify Bank budget for supervision of projects

Annex 9: IFC program status (portfolio and pipeline) 

- 

- CASA Program: Established presence on the ground in October 2012 to strategically manage AS interventions in 
Guinea, providing cross business line strategic support and AS portfolio supervision. In this context, the Guinea 
Conflict Analysis Report, under finalization, will inform our interventions moving forward to support the IFC 
Guinea strategy. 
Investment Climate Program (IC):  Aims to establish an enabling environment for SMEs to grow through two 
components: (i) Business regulatory reform program and (ii) Investment policy and tax reform program. The 
program will make it easier and less costly for firms (especially SMEs) to start and operate their businesses 
formally; establish and support an “Investment Climate Reform” operating Committee; develop an effective 
investment policy letter that will drive an attractive investment code, rationalize the investment incentives regime to 
benefit strategic investments, and support the development of an SME taxation system and an effective tax appeal 
system that is conducive to encouraging economic activities, especially for the mining value-chain. 
- Local Supplier Development Program: Support mining related supplier linkages, community development, 
ensuring that concession activity around mining contributes positively to broadening and deepening the domestic 
Guinean private sector, and that the capacity of local suppliers (SMEs) is strengthened in order to participate in the 
supply chains of international mining companies. IFC will build capacity of 100 SMEs in Conakry, Forecariah and 
Beyla during the period from January to June 2013.  IFC has trained around 300 SMEs to date and over 1000 
participants through IFC Business Edge and other activities. 
- Leasing Program (Pipeline): Activities aim to promote the leasing market as an alternative financing solution in 
Guinea. The leasing law was promulgated in February 2012 and a launching mission of program implementation is 
planned in May 2013, starting with the development of a leasing finance framework. 
- Public-Private Partnerships (PPP/Pipeline): The program aims to increase private sector participation in 
providing and rebuilding infrastructure. In conjunction with the WB, the IFC team conducted a mission in October 
2012 to assess PPP opportunities, with a particular focus on the transport, water, tourism, health and education 
sectors. The PPP team is in discussions with the GoG on the establishment of a PPP unit, which will implement 
institutional and regulatory frameworks to build an environment conducive to PPP activity. 
Simfer: Support the development of the Simandou project and Simandou-related transport infrastructure while the 
WB supports sector governance.   
Semafo: Support independent power projects (e.g. Semafo’s Poudalde hydropower). However, at this stage they 
have decided to wait for the outcome of the legislative elections to proceed prior to firming up potential interest. 
SGHI: IFC is currently considering additional investment in the hotel for the renovation project, however, issues 
pertaining to the nature of the renovation and the GoG and Accor’s contribution to the financing of the hotel need to 
be resolved as a prerequisite. 
- Palma Guinea (Pipeline): This is a Greenfield 303-room US$61 million 5-star Sheraton hotel project in the district 
of Kipé in Conakry.  IFC is considering a loan package of up to US$26 million with a US$15 million-A loan and 
US$11 million-B loan. The project was presented to the IFC Credit Committee on April 19, 2013; the Transaction 
team is actively working towards a closing by the end of this fiscal year. 
- Agribusiness project (Pre-Pipeline): IFC is interested in developing agribusiness investment opportunities in 
Guinea where high potential exists and a scoping mission was conducted in end of April 2013. 
- Ecobank Guinea: The Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) Guarantee Facility for Ecobank Guinea (FY2012) 
was designed to assist Ecobank Guinea’s trade operations by providing guarantees that cover the payment risk in 
trade transactions, thus enabling the continued flow of trade credit into the Guinean market.

Annex 10: Summary of Guinea Conflict Analysis: a private sector perspective/ IFC 

The democratic elections of 2010 brought Guinea back into donors and investors' radars, after five 
decades of political turbulences. This renewed interest in Guinea is justified by its strategic value in a 
world hungry of natural resources, energy and agricultural supplies. The country has an enormous mineral 
potential, including the second world reserves of bauxite, gold, cobalt and Iron ore, just to name a few. 
Offshore oil prospects are also tantalizing. Yet, the business climate is still recovering from the deep 
effects of the country's troubled history but it could also fall into chaos if the current political stalemate is 
not resolved. Restoring business confidence and the conditions of growth is the challenge faced by the 
new government in a context of high expectations for social change, justice, jobs and better livelihoods. 
The reform cliff is inevitable in order to mitigate conflict risks on the fragile future.  

Determinants of conflict and instability and their consequences  

This study attempts to understand the main drivers without which conflicts would not exist, or their 
impact on the private sector would be less deterrent to investors. While looking at the drivers of political 
and social tensions in Guinea, the study also examines the levers of an enabling environment for doing 
business with confidence and a sustainable impact in lifting up the society from poverty. 
I. 
Guinea has successfully avoided large scale civil or military conflict in the past fifty four years. However, 
political uncertainty has remained the most prevalent factor of conflict analysis and risk to business 
development in the country. Generally, five key periods and political regimes delineate the timeline of the 
post-colonial history of Guinea, each with polarized figures, political turmoil and uncertainty affecting 
private sector development: 1958-1984: President Ahmed Sékou Touré's socialist experience and 
totalitarism; 1984-2008 Military rule of Colonel Lansana Conté, failed hope for reforms, established 
the laissez-faire and a legacy of military repression and impunity; 2008-2009 Captain Dadis Camara’s 
interlude of accelerated social turmoil and confusion; 2009-2010 General Sékouba’s handover of 
power to civilians; 2010-2013 Professor Alpha Condé, winner of the free and fair elections heads the 
Fifth Republic and comes with great expectations from people. However he faces a difficult question: “Is 
it possible to change Guinea?”  

The extreme expectations for reform and social justice might be perilous for the new civilian regime. It 
still has to negotiate its way through the complex meanders of a sixty year old political dynamics of 
power, dependency and survival, particularly the ethnic elites and the military. The political timeline of 
Guinea constitutes the backdrop of conflicts and social tensions which can be grouped into five sensitive 
bubbles or vicious circles of conflict drivers that are in turn closely interwoven with ten main business 
risks mapped in this study. These bulbs are reviewed with their consequences as follow: Political 
governance; Social expectations and grievances; Natural resources and the notion of a national 
cake; Regional and external factors and finally Asymmetric factors which are still not fully understood 
but critical. 

1. Political Governance  
1. Institutional Power Sharing and lack of counter powers. For over fifty years, the Presidency and the 
army have consistently dictated on the legislature and the judiciary with deep consequences on the 
volatility of the business climate, affecting particularly big businesses.  

2. Ethnic cleavages. The country has successfully resisted ethnic persecution. However, the 2010 
Presidential election revealed major cleavage between the main candidates along ethnic lines. The 
dangerous effects have persisted into today's tensions and social violence bringing fear and causing losses 
to businesses.  

3. Polarization of the Presidency. The excessive concentration of power at the Presidency has 
characterized all Guinean regimes.  

70 

 
 
4. Impoverished and Predatory State. Since independence in 1958, the State has been the main source 
of jobs in Guinea. But it does not pay. In the streets, people say: “The State pretends to pay Guineans. 
Guineans pretends to work.” The impoverished State has developed numerous predatory strategies to 
compensate low wages through corruption and extortion.  

5. The military. Guinea has a long history of military coups and military involvement in government and 
business, similar to South East Asia.  

6. The culture of impunity. The dominance of the Presidency and the military over the judiciary has 
created an entrenched culture of impunity.  

2. Social expectations and grievances  
7. Poverty and social insecurity. Despite vast mineral resources, a great potential in agriculture and 
fisheries, Guinea remains poor, ranking 178 out of 187 countries in the UNDP’s Human Development 
Report, with an HDI of 0.344, well below the sub-Saharan African average of 0.463 and the world 
average of 0.682.  

8. Inequalities and Social injustice. Sharp contrasts are traditionally part of the Guinean social 
landscape. However, the polarized political system has generated a deep gap between the have and have 
not. The Gini index in Guinea is still around 40%, much higher than Norway’s 26% but better than the 
56% found in Central African Republic14. The loss due to inequalities in income is estimated at 31.1%, 
putting Guinea similar to Burundi respectively ranked 178 amongst 186 countries in the world1. Real 
unemployment is very high, hidden by the informal sector. Only 49% among women and 58% among 
men are actively employed 15. However about 70% of the active population is involved in informal sector 
activities. Finally the bank services cover less than 20% of the informal sector’s estimated demand 16.  

9. Lack of Basic Social Services. A few indicators describe the acute lack of access to basic social 
services: in education, health, housing, water and sanitation. Infant mortality is too high, 130 per thousand 
in 2010. The combined public expenditure on health (0.6%) and education (2.4%) is just 3% of GDP 17.  

10. Regional disparities. Most development in Guinea has taken place in the coastal ecological region 
around Conakry, Kindia and Boke. Central, Upper and Forest Guinea regions have received less 
investment and are typically rural. The dry savannah Upper Guinea is the poorest region. Deep disparities 
continue to exist between urban and rural Guinea. About 69% of Guineans live in rural areas which are 
also the poorest.  

3. Nationalistic approach to natural Resources and the economic cake  
11. Nationalistic approach to natural resources. The Guinean elite and patronage network have 
maintained a nationalistic view of controlling natural resources.  

12. Polarization on Mining & Oil Sector. Minerals are by far the largest exports of Guinea. The control 
or access to mining and oil resources has continued to polarize Guinean elites, civil and military.  

13. Sharing the economic cake. Like in other African countries with a large indigenous trading sector, 
the control of importations and the transport services polarized the business elite and is a source of 
conflicts.  

4. Regional and External factors  

14 UNDP, Human Development Report, 2012  
15 UNIDO, 2007 
16 BizClim, 2012 
17 UNDP, Human Development Report, 2012  

71 

 
 
                                                      
 
14. External conflicts and internal dynamics. Strategically, Guinea has been able to contain the effect 
of political instability and war affecting its neighbors, but it has paid a high cost for it. Monitoring 
regional stability remains a priority.  

5. Asymmetric factors  
15. The informal sector and political actors. The unprepared transition from Socialism to a liberal 
economy led to a ballooning informal sector, the laissez-faire and impunity.  

16. The cash economy. The economy is mainly driven by trade, agriculture and the informal sector, 
which all rely on cash transactions, out of the banking system.  

 Hotspots of political and social risks to business development  

17. Relations between State and business leadership. Traditionally, the Strong State in Guinea has seen 
key private business leaders as “partners” or “opponents  
II. 
The ongoing increased polarization of the Presidential role is a traditional trend justified by the need to 
secure guarantees at the most senior political level for the large investment at stake. But it comes with the 
risk of political uncertainty. The notion of risk here relates to the level of uncertainty induced by the 
drivers of political conflicts and social unrest that may reduce performance predictability of the private 
sector’s investments and projects or drive markets down.  

1. Political instability  
Four major trends should be monitored in priority in 2013:  

18. Confidence in the Presidential leadership and the governance system. Despite tangible 
achievements in just two years, key challenges are still ahead:  

1. The legislative elections have repeatedly been delayed since 2011, leaving the country 
without an elected Parliament. The Conseil National de Transition (CNT) cannot play the role of 
a legislature.  

2. Continued delay of the establishment of an independent judiciary which is the foundation of 
the rule of law.  

3. Lack of resolve in fighting corruption. The President is expected to move on the fight against 
corruption and limit the power of patronage networks so deeply entrenched in Guinea.  

19. Social expectations: After long negotiations with trade unions threatening the mining sector, the 
government reached an interesting deal at the end of 2012 for a phased 50% increase of salaries in 2013, 
but tensions will continue.  

20. Political tensions and clashes. With the backdrop of expected reforms, social hardship, the fight for 
political power and the role of the military, exacerbated rivalries and clashes are likely to make the overall 
issue of political stability a major risk.  

21. Transforming the army. This will remain a major challenge.  

2. Conflict risks for IFC  
The magnitude of IFC’s investment in the mining sector in Guinea makes it inevitable to face the broader 
reality of conflict risks in Guinea. Three risks appear in priority: reputation; slow or no delivery of 
social dividends from investments and a limited flexibility for an exit strategy. Working in conflict 

72 

 
 
affected countries put investors, the private sector and even humanitarian and development actors at risk 
if targeted populations perceive them as a substitute to government social responsibilities.  

A well-planned exit strategy is a mitigation tool that helps visualize and manage when to get involved, 
when to exit and how to do so in transferring a sustainable capacity to people. In the Context of the lack 
of clarity on accompanying infrastructures, business and social services around major investments, an exit 
strategy will identify the challenges and opportunities for a handover to receiving societies. In Guinea, 
IFC will continue to face the combined expectations of the government and people around its 
investments, particularly Simandou, in a dynamic and unpredictable way. Added to this nationalistic 
sentiment may encourage the “right to ask” attitudes.  

3. Top ten risks in Guinea for business in 2013  
In general, the business and investment climate in Guinea faces ten top risks identified through the 
analysis of the drivers of political and social conflicts.  

1. Political volatility. There will be increased uncertainty in predicting performance variability for long 
term investment and projects, particularly in the Oil & Mining sector. Being able to maintain a dialogue 
between investors, business and the country's governance system will be essential.  

2. Rule of law. The judiciary vacuum is likely to persist with short term impact on the ability to protect 
deals depending on national laws.  

3. Resource nationalism. Like in many resource-rich countries, the increased opportunities and demand 
for deals will also increase the complexity of negotiating with the government. Some existing deals might 
be at risk. The pressure for enticements will increase along with the request for free infrastructures and 
social services to people.  

4. Social license to operate. Recent trends of social expectations will continue to grow with a culture of 
“right to ask” or social license obligations. A reactive approach to such demand could be very costly as 
both government and communities feel it legitimate to adopt such attitudes.  

5. Skills shortages. The shortage of skills is one of the major consequences of four decades of failure in 
the education system in Guinea. In the short and medium term, business and projects will continue to face 
a cliff to find qualified labor.  

6. Infrastructure access. For companies operating in Guinea, the lack of infrastructure with high impact 
on supply chains will remain a great challenge particularly transportation, power, water and 
telecommunications. The size of the funding requirements to address these gaps indicated the need for a 
concerted approach between government and stakeholders, whereby economies of scale could be made in 
sharing infrastructures.  

7. Cost inflation. The increased demand of supply for projects is likely to initially push up importations 
in Guinea. Conflicts may appear in relation to who will control that market. Ultimately, this added to 
other structural factors such as the increasing oil prices will put a burden on companies to control costs.  

8. Fraud and corruption. Progress in the fight against corruption is likely to be slow. Companies will 
continue to face red tape and negotiate their ways in a complex environment.  

9. Sharing the benefits. Locally, this is understood as sharing the cake, particularly in a context where 
communities have rarely seen a successful job creating venture for the past forty years. Associated risks 
of high costs of suppliers, labors and social license obligations could be a real threat.  

10. Finance and credit risk. The high level of capital involved in Guinean projects is associated with 
proportional risks. Further, it is likely that the country and stakeholders will need more funds to move 

73 

 
 
projects forward. The local private sector and banking industry will face enormous challenges in 
mobilizing capital for Guinea given the existing regulations. Finally, the size of the informal economy, 
the opacity of transactions will continue to make it difficult to measure credit risk or use traditional credit 
risk decision-making tools, for lack of reliable data.  

4. Win-win Conflict Mitigation Levers and Sustainable Opportunities for Business  
A substantial level of uncertainty will continue to affect business predictability in the medium term. 
Therefore donors and stakeholder support to political dialogue, institutional reforms and the 
transformation of the army will pave the way to a greater business confidence. The main challenge facing 
the government is how to establish the conditions for the emergence of a sustainable business ecosystem 
in Guinea. In the context of a stable and reforming Guinea there are many opportunities for IFC as a 
catalyst of increased investment and sustainable growth in Guinea, working with the government, the 
private sector and financial institutions. The challenge is targeting priority interventions and keeping a 
focus on multipliers of sustainable change that are tangible to the demanding society for jobs and better 
living conditions.  

The following sectors offer great growth opportunities to the private sector in Guinea for both local and 
international investments: Mining and Oil; Banking; Building and Infrastructure, Agriculture and Food 
Processing; Manufacturing Industries; Retail Distribution; Transport and Logistics Services; Mobile 
Telecommunications; Tourism; Technical Training and Education; Technical Support Services and 
Security Services. IFC intervention could contribute help Guinea avoid the conflict trap through its risk 
mitigation tools. In this context, CASA completed recently the Guinea Conflict Analysis Report which 
will inform interventions moving forward to support the IFC Guinea Strategy that focuses on (i) 
improving the business environment through regulatory reforms, including supporting a strong Public-
Private Dialogue (PPD) framework; (ii) strengthening SMEs and supporting institutions; (iii) rebuilding 
financial markets , banks and other financial institutions; and (iv) increasing private sector involvement in 
providing and rebuilding infrastructures, especially through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) business 
models.

Annex 12:  Statistical Development in Guinea   
Current Status and Planned Activities over the CPS Period 

1. 

The Guinea National Statistic Development Strategy (Stratégie Nationale de Développement 
de la Statistique, SNDS) was prepared in 2008 for the period between 2009 and 2013. The diagnostics of 
the statistics sector and the vision for the sector development have not been updated since, nor is there a 
review prepared to evaluate SNDS implementation.  

2. 

The 2008 SNDS envisioned a coherent national statistical system, well-coordinated with a 
capacity to produce and disseminate reliable statistics to meet the growing data demands of all users. The 
action plan of the NSDS was based on five strategic pillars: (1) improvement of the institutional and 
regulatory framework for the national statistics system; (2) improved coverage and quality of statistics 
produced; (3) strengthening of the personnel, material, and financial resources of the national statistics 
system; (4) improved dissemination and archiving of data through the use of new information and 
communication technologies; and (5) mobilization of resources from technical and financial partners for 
implementation of the SNDS. 

3. 

SNDS had prioritized 7 areas of improvements for the National Institute of Statistics (INS), 
including: (1) improving the institutional and organizational arrangements for better coordination of 
statistical activities; (2)  improving the coverage and quality of statistical production in accordance with 
international standards; (3)  improving working conditions in the statistical system (infrastructure, 
equipment, furniture, logistics); (4) promoting statistical training, including training in specialized schools 
of statistics, demography and applied economics, on-job learning opportunities, and recruitment and 
retention of a large number of statisticians with professional status;  (5) improving processing capabilities, 
archiving, analysis, and dissemination of statistics by adopting ICT; (6) strengthening analytical and 
research skills; and (7) promoting statistical literacy. It is well recognized, however, little has been 
accomplished in these seven strategic areas by INS since the implementation of SNDS. 

4. 

Five years after launching SNDS, lack of reliable and relevant statistics for timely inputs to 
policy making remains one of the fundamental development challenges in Guinea. The World Bank 
CPS identified many gaps in statistics production and their impact on development. These include the 
delay in the publication of the national accounts and weak economic analysis tools (no publishing 
industry statistics, index of industrial production and lack of predictive model short-term). Insufficient 
knowledge of the informal sector is a serious handicap especially since it contributes more than 60 
percent of GDP and provides most jobs. The weakness of the structures responsible for producing 
statistical information in key sectors such as mining is a serious handicap in achieving sectoral policy 
objectives such as Extractive industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). It is the same in growth sectors 
such as tourism, transport and public works where the lack of a reliable information system does not 
encourage investment. In the field of demographic and social statistics, production statistics of 
employment and treatment of vital events remain a concern. Health statistics remain the weakest link in 
social statistics because of their incomplete coverage and the irregularity of their publication. In the field 
of water, energy and the environment, there is a lack of an integrated statistical system in the rural sector 
and the existence of a multitude of projects on to systems information causing duplication and permanent 
contradictions. With the last annual agricultural survey dating from 1997, it is impossible to carry out 
regular monitoring of food production in a context of food crisis. There is also an imbalance in the 
collection of fisheries data, essentially limited to sea fishing. Finally, the availability of statistics on the 
environment remains largely insufficient. 

5. 

There are low standards of statistical production, marked by the absence of methodological 
documents relating to standards, classifications and procedures for collecting, processing, analyzing and 
disseminating data. Additionally, low skilled human resources, material and financial resources are 
characteristic of the statistical system. Chronic underinvestment in infrastructure is also a major handicap 

88 

 
 
for statistical production. There is a real gap between user needs and supply of disaggregated data at sub-
national and micro levels. This gap seems to be widening with the revitalization of decentralization. 

6. 

Given the scope of statistical capacity deficit in Guinea and limited resources, the strategy 
of the World Bank statistical support will be focusing on limited areas where differences could be 
made independent of the low in-country capacity and limited financial resources. These supports 
could serve as catalytic activities, paving the road for future support when opportunities present.  

7. 

First, the Bank will take a lead in preparing a review on the status of the institution, capacity, 
financing, production, and dissemination of statistics in Guinea, as well as the implementation of the 
NSDS 2009-2013 and donor coordination in statistics support. Based on the review, recommendations 
will be made for targeted strategic statistics support for INS with suggestion of possible areas 
coordination with other development partners and highlight government’s role in financing of statistics 
and internal use.  

8. 

Second, the Bank will prepare an analytical work aiming at recovering the comparability of the 
four household surveys conducted in 1994, 2002, 2007 and 2012. Because the first two household surveys 
were LSMS and the last two were Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ) surveys, the reliability 
of poverty trend based on these four surveys is currently in question. The analytical work will examine 
possible sources of incomparability, including questionnaire design, prediction error, and sampling error 
of LSMS and CWIQ. In addition to examining the incomparability issues in consumption aggregates, the 
analytical work will also examine the comparability of other variables critical to shared prosperity, 
including employment and access to services. Recommendations will be made for the future household 
surveys in Guinea in regard to sampling and survey instrument design. Attention will also be paid to the 
fragile political balances of the country, exploring the relevance and feasibility of using recently proposed 
micro-level surveys to measure conflicts. 

9. 

Third, based on the review described above, the government’s priority initiatives and World 
Bank areas of engagement, there would be a focused effort to develop the statistics requirements to 
support decision–making in one particular policy area that the CPS is supporting. Bank could provide 
support in producing, analyzing and disseminating statistics in this area.  Other possibilities would be to 
focus on 
improving human development 
indicators collected 
through household surveys or 
complementing the ongoing public expenditure review analysis by strengthening the administrative data 
that would be used for public investment decisions. If the effort is successful, it would be possible to then 
build on that success in other areas.
