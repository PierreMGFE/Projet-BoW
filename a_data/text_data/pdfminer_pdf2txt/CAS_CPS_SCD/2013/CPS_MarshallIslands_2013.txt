EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
This is the first World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the 
Republic of the Marshall Islands.  The World Bank Group has been scaling up its engagement 
throughout the Pacific and this CPS reflects the commitment to transition from a regional 
engagement framework to individual country strategies that permit a more detailed analysis of a 
country's specific development challenges.  This CPS outlines a program of assistance intended 
to strengthen economic governance to improve living standards and enhance service delivery.  
The CPS is presented together with the country's first International Development Association 
(IDA) operation. 

ii. 
The Marshall Islands is one of the world’s smallest, most isolated and vulnerable 
nations.  The country consists of 29 atolls and 5 isolated islands (24 of which are inhabited) and 
has a total land mass of just 181 km2 set in an ocean area of over 1.9 million km2.  The 
population of the Marshall Islands is estimated at 53,000 of which close to half are resident in 
Majuro, the capital city.  The country is vulnerable to occasional typhoons and its 370km 
coastline renders it particularly susceptible to extreme waves and high tides.  

iii. 
The Marshall Islands faces many of the development challenges common to small, 
remote economies.  Small size and remoteness increase the costs of economic activity and make 
it difficult to achieve economies of scale. Remoteness also imposes transport costs that increase 
the costs of trade and fundamentally constrain competitiveness of exports of goods and services 
in world markets. These same factors also increase the cost and complexity of providing public 
services.  There is also an opportunity and a need to bring greater attention to gender concerns in 
the Marshall Islands and all World Bank Group interventions will be informed by a consideration 
of these issues. 

iv. 
The World Bank Group program will focus on strengthening economic governance 
and promoting the effective use of public resources to enhance living and service delivery 
standards for all Marshallese.  To help mitigate the effects of economic isolation, the World 
Bank will seek to help the Marshall Islands take advantage of opportunities from closer regional 
and global integration.  The World Bank Group will support the liberalization and regulation of 
the telecommunications sector with the aim of connecting more Marshallese to social and 
economic opportunities.  The Marshall Islands has indicated it will participate in a proposed 
regional fisheries operation that would strengthen the governance and sustainable management 
of tuna fisheries and help increase the share of revenue captured by the Marshall Islands from 
this significant natural resource.  The Government has also signaled a willingness to address 
important structural reforms in the energy sector, to improve management of Compact Trust 
Fund assets and to enhance the investment climate, all of which could also be supported by the 
World Bank Group.   

v. 
World Bank Group support to the Marshall Islands will require an agile and flexible 
approach.  As the World Bank Group deepens engagement in the Marshall Islands, there will be 
a need to balance selectivity with a willingness to support emerging development priorities and 
opportunities.  Moreover, all World Bank Group interventions will need to be informed by an 
appreciation of the extraordinary capacity constraints facing the Marshall Islands.

I.     INTRODUCTION  

1. 
The World Bank Group has been scaling-up analytical and financial support 
throughout the Pacific and is now well-placed to provide International Development 
Association (IDA) support to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI).  The Marshall 
Islands became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) 
in May 1992, of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1992, and of IDA in 
January 1993.  Upon membership, the Marshall Islands was classified as IBRD due to a high per 
capita income level.  However, in part because of creditworthiness concerns, the Marshall 
Islands was unable to access IBRD resources, and the country’s engagement with the World 
Bank was limited to support provided under the Institutional Development Fund (IDF), the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF), and analytical work.  In July 2011, in the wake of 
successive food and fuel price increases and the lingering effects of the global financial crisis, 
the Marshall Islands was reclassified to IDA-only status under the exception for small island 
economies.  This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) signals the World Bank Group’s long-term 
commitment to supporting the Marshall Islands’ development and will be presented together 
with the First Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Sector Development Policy 
Operation. 

2. 
This CPS outlines a World Bank Group program that responds to the Marshall 
Islands’ development priorities and that is informed by the broader themes guiding the World 
Bank Group’s engagement in the Pacific.  The practice of developing individual country 
strategies for all Pacific country members reflects that, while Pacific island countries face many 
common development challenges, Pacific members benefit from strategies that address their 
specific country conditions.  Through this CPS, the World Bank Group aims to adapt its 
instruments to the Marshall Islands’ country context, and to refine implementation approaches 
based on experience derived from engagement elsewhere in the Pacific.  Country strategies in 
“micro-states” such as the Marshall Islands will of necessity be concise, selective, highly 
flexible, and seek to draw upon the full range of available instruments.  As a result, the CPS 
should be viewed as providing a framework for engagement rather than a precisely detailed 
program as might be expected in a larger country or where Bank engagement is more 
established.  The Government of the Marshall Islands is strongly supportive of the preparation of 
an individual CPS and of the program it outlines.  

3. 
To deepen the World Bank Group’s understanding of the Marshall Islands’ context 
and priorities, the program will draw upon the analytical work and operational experience of 
more established development partners.  The World Bank has participated in recent 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV missions, and the proposed interventions have 
been shaped through consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United 
States (US) Government.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

Sociopolitical Context 

4. 
The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a Micronesian Island nation with a history of 
settlement stretching back 4,000 years to the arrival of the first navigators.  The chance arrival 
of the Spanish voyager Alonso de Salazar in 1526 marked the first European contact with the 
country, and it was not until 1788 that British Naval Captain William Marshall named it when 
sailing through the area while transporting convicts to Australia.  In the period 1885-1914, the 
Marshall Islands was annexed to Germany until its capture by Japan in the First World War.  
Japan governed the Marshall Islands until the allied occupation in the Second World War and the 
country’s subsequent transfer to US control.  From 1946-1958, the United States tested 67 
nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands including those in Bikini Atoll, and the 1952 test of the 
first US Hydrogen bomb that destroyed an island in Enetewok Atoll.  The health effects from 
radioactive contamination persist, and in the period 1956-1998, the US provided US$759 million 
in compensation to affected Marshallese. 

5. 
The Marshall Islands became self-governing in 1979.  It achieved formal independence 
in 1990 and is governed as a mixed parliamentary-presidential system.  General elections are 
held every four years (most recently in November 2011) with each of 24 constituencies electing 
one or more representatives (Senators) to the lower house of the bicameral legislature Nitijela.  
The President, and Head of State, is subsequently elected by the 33 Senators.  The upper house 
The Council of Iroij is an advisory body comprising 12 tribal chiefs.   

6. 
The Marshall Islands is one of the world’s smallest, most isolated and vulnerable 
nations, and is already beginning to feel the effects of climate change.  The country consists of 
29 atolls and five isolated islands (24 of which are inhabited) and has a total land mass of just 
181km2 set in an ocean area of over 1.9 million km2.  The population of the Marshall Islands is 
estimated at about 53,000 1 of which over half are resident in the capital city of Majuro.  The 
country is vulnerable to occasional typhoons and, like other low-lying Pacific nations, its 370km 
coastline, which is home to 99 percent of the population, renders it particularly susceptible to 
extreme waves and high tides.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 
their 4th Assessment Report (2007) that sea-level rise is likely “to be of a magnitude that will 
disrupt virtually all economic and social sectors in small island nations…” 

Millennium Development Goals, Youth Development and Gender 

7. 
 Data suggest that the Marshall Islands’ progress towards the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDG) has been uneven.  A 2011 MDG Tracking Report 2 notes that the Marshall Islands 
is not on track to meet the MDG Goals on Eradicating Extreme Poverty (Goal 1) or Combating 
HIV/AIDS and Other Diseases (Goal 6).  The country has made mixed progress towards 
Achieving Universal Primary Education, Promoting Gender Equality and Empowering Women,

and Ensuring Environmental Sustainability (Goals 2, 3, and 7, respectively).  It is on track to 
meet Goals 4 and 5 (Reduce Child Mortality and Improve Maternal Health).   

8. 
 A median age of 21 3 years makes the Marshall Islands one of the youngest Pacific 
nations in demographic terms.  A high birth rate, the continuing effects of urbanization, and a 
largely stagnant economy are generating significant pressure on the country to provide increased 
educational and employment opportunities, and to provide social services. Urbanization has 
resulted in high population density in major capitals. Under these pressures traditional social 
structures (as reflected in the Marshallese saying "jake jobol eo” or "no person will go hungry 
through sharing") are beginning to break down.  The Marshall Islands enjoys a relatively high 
and equal level of primary education for boys and girls.  Among youth, unemployment levels are 
estimated to be more than twice the national unemployment rate and widely acknowledged as a 
major source of social tension. It is estimated that around 11,000 people emigrated between 1999 
and 2011. 

9. 
There is compelling evidence of the need for greater efforts to address gender disparities.  
The recent "Stock-Take of the Gender Mainstreaming Capacity of the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands" published by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) in April 2012 provides a 
comprehensive analysis of the issues facing women and girls in the Marshall Islands.  Teen 
pregnancy in the Marshall Islands is higher than for most other Pacific Islands and accounts for 
nearly 20 percent of all pregnancies.  While two out of three men are economically active, only 
one in three women is, and unemployment rates are significantly higher among women than men 
(37 and 28 percent respectively).  There is currently only one female member of the 33 seat 
Nitijela, and only three women out of twelve appointees in the largely consultative Council of 
Iroij.  The report finds that 30 percent of women have experienced violence since the age of 15 
(primarily at the hands of their husband or partner) and over 22 percent of all women have 
experienced violence in the last year.  The Women in Development Office (WDO) was 
established by the Government in 1979 to serve as the designated policy coordination unit 
responsible for government-wide mainstreaming of gender issues.  The WDO is significantly 
under-resourced (WDO currently receives an annual budget of about US$72,000) and has 
recently been absorbed into the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  As a result, there is no ready 
mechanism by which gender considerations can be systematically integrated into national 
legislation or inform budgetary processes. 

10. There is scope for the World Bank Group to provide a more systematic consideration of 
gender issues and to initiate assistance that could catalyze increased donor effort.  The World 
Bank will be assessing a number of the recommendations in the SPC report including the 
possibility of providing technical assistance for the development of a national gender policy, 
supporting the collection of gender-disaggregated statistics, and organizing a donors’ meeting to 
enhance awareness and coordination on gender issues.  All World Bank Group interventions will 
seek to include gender disaggregated indicators where possible, and all operations will be gender 
informed to the extent possible.  A quantitative study to assess the impact of ICT reforms on 
women is proposed as part of the First ICT Sector Development Policy Operation, which may

help to confirm the anecdotal reports of the positive impact of these reforms in the Pacific and 
elsewhere.  The World Bank Group is exploring a range of possible interventions that may 
include collaboration with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to present the findings of the World 
Development Report on Gender to the Cabinet, an analysis of the existing legal framework 
applying to domestic violence (in the context of international conventions ratified by the 
Marshall Islands).  A targeted trust-funded project might also be considered with the aim of 
strengthening the department within the Ministry of Internal Affairs responsible for women’s 
issues. 

Economic Context 

11. 
The Marshall Islands faces many of the challenges common to small remote 
economies.  Its size and remoteness increase the costs of economic activity and make it unable to 
achieve economies of scale.  Remoteness also imposes transport expenses that increase the costs 
of trade, and fundamentally constrain the competitiveness of exports of goods and services 
internationally.  These same factors also push up the cost and complexity of providing public 
services and fulfilling 
the basic functions of Government. 
 Moreover, geographical 
characteristics, including populations centered on small, low-lying atolls, make the country 
vulnerable to natural disasters.  

12. 
These barriers have led to an undiversified economic base and persistent current 
account deficits. 
 With limited export and domestic production opportunities, public 
administration and social services constitute the largest share of the economy – 40 percent of 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  The fisheries sector comprises around 10 percent of GDP, 
while manufacturing makes up less than 2 percent. Copra and fisheries are the most significant 
exports, while the Marshall Islands is almost completely reliant on imports for food, fuel, and 
other basic needs.  Imports of goods and services totaled US$176 million in 2011, compared to 
total goods and service exports of just US$65 million.  The current account deficit excluding 
grants has averaged 47 percent of GDP since 2007. 

13. With substantial constraints to export-led growth, the Marshall Islands is heavily 
dependent on aid and other fiscal transfers.  The current account deficit is largely financed by 
grant inflows. Aid and fiscal transfers, primarily from the US, support reasonable standards of 
living for the majority of the population, with Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of 
US$3,910 in 2011.  On-budget grant income from various sources is equivalent to 49 percent of 
GNI, and official development assistance per capita was over US$3,450 in 2010 4.

14. 
Public expenditure in the Marshall Islands has expanded rapidly since 2003 with the 
US Compact of Free Association 5 and other grants, supporting reasonable levels of growth.  
The 2003 amended Compact includes various military and other access arrangements, and 
provides a 20-year stream of funding. Beginning 2005, the US also began to provide the 
Marshall Islands with a Supplemental Education Grant. Together, these grants were equivalent 
to, around 40 percent of GDP in 2011. This Compact agreement replaced the first agreement, 
which ran from 1986 to 2001, and included additional fiscal resources provided to the 
Government of the Marshall Islands.  Increased fiscal resources allowed a period of rapid public 
sector expansion through FY2007. 6  Public expenditures grew by an annual average rate of 12 
percent between FY2003 and FY2007, and employment in the public sector expanded by 507 
jobs or at an annual average rate of 6 percent over the same period.  Expansion in public 
spending fueled growth of 1.9 percent between FY2003 and FY2007, peaking at 3 percent in 
2007.

5 The Compact of Free Association defines the relationship between the Marshall Islands and the US under which, 
while remaining a sovereign state, the Marshall Islands is considered an associate US state.  The Marshall Islands 
receives guaranteed financial assistance from the US in exchange for relinquishing full defense authority and 
responsibilities.

15. 
Under the Compact of Free Association, the Marshall Islands receives annual funding 
and access to domestic US Federal Government programs.  These include disaster response and 
recovery, US Postal Service, Federal Aviation Commission, and Federal Communications 
Commission.  Total recurrent annual funding (including Compact sector grants - US$35.2 
million, Compact Trust Fund contributions – US$12.5 million, Kwajalein land owner 
compensation - US$17.0 million, and Supplemental Education Grant – US$5.9 million) currently 
stands at US$70.6 million. Compact sector grants focus on the education and health sectors, 
public sector infrastructure projects, capacity building programs, as well as special allocations 
relating to the US-operated military facilities.  Compact sector grants are scheduled to decline in 
real terms going forward, matched by increases to Compact Trust Fund contributions.  The US 
has established the Compact Trust Fund (CTF) that is designed to “contribute to economic 
development and long-term budgetary self-reliance after FY2023” 7(that is, after the Compact 
has expired: see Box 1). 

Box 1: Republic of the Marshall Islands’ Compact Trust Fund  

Established in 2004, the RMI Compact Trust Fund was established as part of the Compact 
of Free Association (the “Compact”) agreement with the US.  The CTF is designed to replace 
annual grant assistance from the US beyond 2023 and to contribute to economic advancement and 
long-term budgetary self-reliance.  The CTF currently receives annual savings from fiscal 
surpluses along with donor contributions from the US (under the Compact) and Taiwan, China.  

The RMI CTF has a sophisticated setup, and is not fully controlled by RMI.  The RMI CTF 
consists of four inter-related accounts (a "capital" account, a "disbursement" account, a "buffer" 
account and a "windfall" account) with no withdrawals expected until 2024.  Thereafter, CTF 
returns from the previous year can be transferred to government up to a limit equivalent to the 
annual grant assistance in 2023 (in real terms).  The governance of these funds falls on the CTF 
committee (with the United States holding 4 out of 7 votes), which further appoints a trustee, 
investment manager, and independent auditor for the daily management of the assets.   

The market value of the CTF fell significantly during the global financial crisis, given 
significant exposure to growth assets.  The market value of the CTF stood at US$142 million 
(82 percent of GDP) as of end-June 2011.  The assets of the CTF are invested in approximately 30 
percent defensive assets and 70 percent growth assets.  Returns of 11.8 percent and 15.6 percent 
were noted in FY2006 and FY2007 respectively.  However during FY2008–09, when the global 
financial crisis occurred, the CTF faced a cumulative investment loss of over 20 percent, while 
the economy contracted by between 1½ - 2 percent in both 2008 and 2009. 

 Under current policies, the build-up in government assets in the CTF is projected to fall 
short of replacing Compact grants expiring in FY2023.  Recently, the global financial crisis 
has resulted in capital losses and reduced investment returns, and has made it more difficult to 
achieve long-term budgetary self-reliance.  Achieving longer term fiscal sustainability will require 
a combination of fiscal consolidation and a higher level of grants than currently projected.

16. 
The Marshall Islands was hit hard by the global food and fuel and economic crises.  
Growth in public expenditure was already slowing in 2008, and a range of major donor-financed 
projects had reached completion when fuel and food prices reached record levels.  Heavily 
reliant on imports, inflation in the Marshall Islands reached 15 percent, eroding domestic real 
incomes and reducing demand from local businesses.  Record fuel prices brought about a severe 
cash flow crisis at the state-owned electricity utility, the Marshall's Energy Company (MEC), 
requiring the Government to step in to meet the cost of fuel purchases.  Domestic revenues 
declined slightly as the economy slowed. Facing a cash-flow crisis, the Government of the 
Marshall Islands imposed emergency measures. 

17. 
Recovery resumed in 2010 and is being sustained through moderation of global 
commodity prices and progress with fiscal management, although risks remain.  The economy 
grew by 5.6 percent in FY2010, driven by an expansion of fishery capacity and exports, a 
recovery of external demand and the moderation of fuel prices.  Growth fell sharply to 0.8 
percent in FY2011, as a result of high commodity prices, labor shortages, and a delay in the 
airport renovation project. Inflation stabilized in FY2010, falling to 1.8 percent but has remained 
elevated at above 5 percent since FY2011, driven by strengthening import prices.  Government 
finances have also improved since FY2009 through the imposition of successive across-the-
board spending cuts in FY2009 and FY2010 that have reduced total recurrent spending by more 
than 10 percent.  The combination of economic recovery and expenditure control measures 
allowed the Government to avoid cash-flow problems in FY2011, and to generate a fiscal 
surplus, equivalent to about 3.7 percent of GDP.   However, the FY2012 budget deficit is 
estimated at about 1.1 percent of GDP, with volatile domestic revenue, declining foreign grants, 
and occasional off-budget spending posing threats to fiscal management. Financial assistance to 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the form of subsidies and capital transfers remains sizable. 

18. While confronting fiscal challenges, the Marshall Islands is also struggling to address 
key vulnerabilities in the management of SOEs.  SOEs are economically significant, holding 
assets of US$116 million as of end-FY2008 (about 76 percent of GDP) but the performance of 
many SOEs is poor, with Government subsidies to the SOE sector reaching an average of 
US$7.2 million per annum between FY2007 and FY2010 (around 4 percent of GDP).  Poorly 
performing SOEs represent a fiscal risk for Government while also constraining growth 
providing poor service and charging high prices.  

19. 
The Government is continuing to progress on key economic and public sector reforms, 
but challenges remain.  Among the ongoing reforms are the Comprehensive Adjustment 
Program Advisory Group, created in 2010, and whose recommended priorities for fiscal and 
structural reform have been endorsed by the Cabinet.  The Tax and Revenue Reform and 
Modernization Commission (TRAM) has also been created, and its recommendations are soon to 
be implemented through a program of reform supported by the Pacific Financial Technical 
Assistance Center.  A report on SOEs was prepared with ADB assistance, which led to the MEC 
Board adopting a comprehensive recovery program.  The ADB is supporting these reform efforts 
through a Public Sector Program including loan refinancing of the external debt of MEC.  A 
recent review of the current status of the Public Sector Program has indicated that, while some 
reforms are on track (such as tax reform) others (such as generation of a sustained fiscal surplus 
and expenditure compression) are not.

Poverty 

20. While the incidence of extreme poverty is low in the Marshall Islands, progress toward 
MDG 1 (Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger) has been uneven.  The 2011 GNI per capita 
figure of US$3,910 classifies the country as “lower middle-income” although there are 
substantial disparities in cash incomes, which are high in Majuro and Kwajalein (due to a greater 
concentration of highly paid public servants) relative to outer atolls.  Although the incidence of 
absolute poverty is low, data indicate high levels of inequality, evidence of malnutrition in urban 
areas, and limited access to cash incomes in rural areas.  Incomes in communities affected by 
nuclear testing and receiving compensation (such as Enewetak and Kili) are significantly higher 
than those in other islands.  Elsewhere, lack of income-earning opportunities has led to concerns 
over rising unemployment, financial hardship (including declining real incomes and higher levels 
of consumer debt), and hunger.  These factors provide powerful incentives for migration from 
outer atolls to the two major urban centers, as well as externally to the United States.   

21. 
The benefits of economic growth have not been shared evenly and there is evidence of 
growing inequality.  Economic growth has been driven by expansion in Government expenditure 
and payments to land-owners in certain islands, disproportionately benefiting urban populations 
and those with land title, with populations in outer islands left further behind.  According to 1999 
data, the Gini coefficient 8 in the Marshall Islands was 0.54, greater than Fiji at 0.46, Papua New 
Guinea 0.46, Samoa 0.43, Tuvalu 0.43, Tonga 0.42 and the Federated States of Micronesia 0.41.  
Rapid inflation over recent years is reported to have severely impacted the poor. Government 
revenue policy and expenditure do not counter existing inequalities, with an outdated tax system 
and various implicit and explicit exemptions and subsidies having a strongly regressive impact. 

22. 
Improving the quality and availability of poverty data remains a priority for the 
Marshall Islands.  The most recent census data documented in the 2011 Census of Population 
and Housing (previous census completed in 1999).  A Household Income and Expenditure 
Survey was undertaken in 2002 but did not include a formal poverty analysis.  A Community and 
Socioeconomic survey, and a Demographic and Health Survey were completed in 2006 and 2007 
respectively.  In similar situations throughout the Pacific, the World Bank has been able to work 
with respected regional partners – such as SPC – to prepare a comprehensive poverty 
assessment.  An updated Household Income and Expenditure Survey would be a necessary 
prerequisite and might be conducted by SPC with the World Bank providing technical peer 
review and direct inputs during the analytical phase of work. 

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability 

23. 
The Marshall Islands faces important challenges over the medium-term.  Economic 
growth is expected to remain moderate at around 2 percent in FY2012 and FY2013, supported by 
rising fisheries exports, a US Federal Aviation Administration-financed airport rehabilitation 

8 A Gini coefficient is a statistical measure that can be used to measure income inequality.  Gini coefficients are 
scored from zero to one, with a score closer to zero indicating a society with little income inequality, and a score 
closer to one indicating a society with significant income inequality.

project, and the planned Ebeye water and sanitation project.  Beyond the short term, growth is 
expected to be subdued as a result of the gradual reduction in Compact inflows, planned 
downsizing of the Kwajalein military base, and the impact of poorly performing SOEs.  Potential 
sources of growth over the medium-term include further donor-financed capital projects, an 
expansion of existing fishing operations, and an increase in fishing license revenues following 
recent international negotiations.  Increased employment opportunities at the Kwajalein base 
may also materialize with the possible commencement of a new satellite project.  

24. 
The prospective end of Compact funding presents a key challenge to fiscal 
sustainability.  No Compact financing is assured beyond the life of the current arrangement. 
While the CTF was established to replace Compact grants from 2024 onward, based on current 
projections, contributions to the CTF are inadequate to assure a smooth transition, and annual 
CTF income can be expected to fall US$11 million (in 2011 prices) short of what is needed to 
replace Compact grants in 2024. Current public sector and structural reform measures if 
successfully implemented will help to significantly increase accumulation in the CTF. However, 
for the CTF to reach adequate capitalization by 2023 and for fiscal sustainability beyond 2023 
additional grant support will likely be required under any realistic scenario.

25. Measures are in place to address fiscal sustainability challenges.  The Public Sector 
Program supported by the ADB has led to the identification of several priorities for achieving 
savings and improving the effectiveness of public expenditure.  An audit of public sector 
functions is expected to reveal duplication of certain roles and opportunities to reduce the wage 
bill, while the Ministry of Finance is working to eliminate unfilled positions.  A review of 
Government allowances and benefits could deliver further savings.  While these initiatives are 

9 

 
 
likely to produce some savings, further substantial reductions in payroll expenditure and overall 
public spending are unlikely to be achievable without broader counterproductive economic 
impacts, given the key role that Government plays as a source of employment, income, and 
demand.  The priority for Government is therefore to improve efficiency and effectiveness of 
public spending, and to address structural barriers to private sector growth and revenue 
generation.  Planned revenue reform under the TRAM process is expected to be largely revenue 
neutral, but the accompanying simplification of the tax regime may allow some gains through 
increased compliance, and make the economy more business friendly.  
26. With external debt of around 57 percent of GDP, the Marshall Islands is at high risk of 
debt distress.  Under the IMF-World Bank debt sustainability framework, the Marshall Islands 
exceeds several policy thresholds under baseline and stress-test scenarios of the draft 2011 Debt 
Sustainability Analysis prepared by the Bank.  External debt is mostly in the form of 
concessional ADB loans but also includes new Government guaranteed debts in the SOE sector.  
Debt servicing obligations are equivalent to 16 percent of exports, although this is expected to 
decline to less than 5 percent of exports by 2016.  Debt servicing is currently equal to around 20 
percent of revenue, and is expected to decline gradually to below 10 percent of revenue in 2024.  
Debt dynamics vary substantially according to projected growth and export performance.  Policy 
relevant thresholds are breached under any plausible scenario.  The most extreme stress-test 
scenario (maintenance of historical averages minus one standard deviation in 2012-2013) would 
see the present value of public and publicly guaranteed debt exceed 350 percent of GDP over the 
next two years.  Previous arrears to ADB have now been cleared, but the Government has yet to 
develop a clear debt management strategy that can address looming debt service payments.   
Debt management is an area in which the World Bank has a comparative advantage and is 
expected to be an area of focus as engagement evolves in the Marshall Islands. 

27. 
The Marshall Islands remains heavily exposed to changes in global prices, but risks to 
external balances are limited.  Inflation is expected to moderate to under 4 percent in FY2013 as 
fuel and other import prices ease.  Current account deficits are expected to remain wide until 
FY2013, driven by imports for fisheries and airport expansion financed by foreign investment 
and capital grants. Compact-related funding is expected to continue to provide a reliable source 
of import financing over the next decade, and the current account deficit is expected to be close 
to around 5 percent of GDP over the medium-term.  Exports have recently expanded in contrast 
to most Pacific Island countries, although this trend – driven by strong agricultural commodity 
prices and new fisheries investments – cannot be relied upon to continue.  In the longer-term, the 
expiry of Compact funding could lead to an erosion of foreign assets, undermining external 
stability.  

28. 
The macroeconomic policy framework is dependent on continued availability of grants 
from development partners and is subject to high levels of uncertainty.  A sharper than 
expected rise in global commodity prices would exacerbate inflation and lead to further 
contraction of the Marshall Islands’ economy.  The macroeconomic policy framework also 
depends on the continued availability of grants from development partners over the medium-
term, especially the US, and the inadvisability of borrowing to fund fiscal deficits.  Any change 
in Compact arrangements or in the Marshall Islands’ capacity to access federal grants, or from 
further effects of the global economic slowdown would have a significant and negative impact 
on macroeconomic stability.  Uncertainty regarding the US plans for the Kwajalein military base 

10 

 
poses risk in terms of potential job losses but these may be offset by new projects.  Finally, the 
country remains vulnerable to a variety of natural disasters that may also place considerable 
stress on the macroeconomic policy framework.  In regard to the latter, the Marshall Islands has 
recently joined four other Pacific countries in a pilot catastrophic risk pool.  This initiative is co-
led by the World Bank, SPC/SOPAC9 and ADB with financial support from the Government of 
Japan, and aims to increase the financial resilience of Pacific countries by providing them with 
access to a market-based catastrophe risk transfer mechanism as part of their comprehensive 
disaster risk financing strategy.  

Government Priorities and Development Framework 

29. 
The Marshall Islands’ national strategic development plan is outlined in “Vision 2018” 
a framework for achieving a “…country within an interdependent world, with enhanced 
socio-economic self-reliance, [and] an educated, healthy, productive, law abiding and God-
loving people…”  The strategic development framework, drafted in 2001 is a wide-ranging 
document that sets out to address “Ten Challenges” essential to fulfilling the “Vision”:  i) good 
governance, political stability and a competent and honest public sector; ii) investment in 
education and research; iii) a culture of savings, investment and productivity; iv) a country able 
to take advantage of global trends; v) effective and responsible economic and financial 
institutions; vi) equitable development of the Outer Islands; vii) strengthening the spirituality of 
the Marshallese people; viii) promotion of healthy lifestyles, the prevailing culture and 
sustainable environment; ix) fostering fundamental change in the attitudes and behavior of 
citizens, Government, businesses, corporations and non-governmental organizations; and x) 
effective partnership between national and local Governments, NGOs, the private sector, civil 
society and citizens.  In consultation with the World Bank Group and other stakeholders, the 
Government has identified areas in which the World Bank Group could provide support for more 
effective management of public and external resources and to improving living and service 
delivery standards. 

Development Partner Engagement 

30. 
Given the geographic and economic constraints facing the country, external assistance 
is unlikely to be a transitional phenomenon in the Marshall Islands.  In common with many 
small island states, the Marshall Islands is heavily reliant on external assistance with on-budget 
grant income estimated to account for 40 percent of GDP.  Development partner support being 
provided includes the following: 

Under the Compact of Free Association with the US, the Marshall Islands will receive at least 
US$57 million in grants every year until 2023 including contributions to the jointly managed 
CTF (see Box 1). This figure is scheduled to increase to US$62.7 million per annum from 
FY2014 onward. At the end of this period, financial assistance from the US will end at which 
point the CTF is expected to serve as the country’s principal source of budget revenue.  The 

9 SOPAC is SPC’s Applied Geoscience and Technology Division.

domestic economy is already highly dependent on the income generated by the disbursement of 
Compact funds to finance the public wage bill and major construction projects. 

The ADB’s Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) for 2012-14 identifies four areas of 
focus:  i) macroeconomic and fiscal management; ii) private sector development; iii) human 
capacity development; and, iv) the environment and climate change.  The overarching objective 
of ADB support is to help restore macroeconomic stability following the global financial crisis 
and to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability.  The COBP identifies an indicative lending 
program of US$5m with the country eligible for funding from both the Asian Development Fund 
and Ordinary Capital Resources.  This is expected to be supplemented with complementary 
technical assistance (largely focusing on economic planning and policy and enhancing public 
service delivery).  The ADB is providing leadership in the critical area of SOE reform and 
recently signed a US$5m loan for public sector reform Other activities in the Marshall Islands 
include technical assistance provided under regional initiatives to strengthen capacity to respond 
to the effects of climate change and technical assistance to design technical and vocational 
training. 

The Government of Australia has a small program of assistance in the Marshall Islands relative 
to the scope of Australia’s engagement elsewhere in the Pacific. Support focuses on two areas: 
energy sector reform and improving access to clean water and sanitation.  Australia’s program in 
the Marshall Islands is outlined in the Partnership for Development signed by both countries in 
August 2010. 

The European Commission’s strategic framework for assistance is set out in the Country Strategy 
Paper for the Marshall Islands 2008-13.  An indicative under the 10th European Development 
Fund focuses on support to the water and energy sectors, specifically sustainable energy supply 
to the country’s outer islands.  The program is also informed by cross-cutting issues that include 
climate change, environmental sustainability, gender equality, and the fight against HIV/AIDS. 

The Government of Japan’s Rolling Plan for the Marshall Islands identifies solid waste 
management, disaster risk management, the response to climate change, and strengthening of 
health services as priorities in a multi-year program of technical assistance. 

Taiwan, China is a longstanding donor partner to the Marshall Islands and provides an annual 
grant and a range of technical assistance in areas including infrastructure rehabilitation, disaster 
risk management, support to public works projects, and health care.  Funding provided by 
Taiwan, China in 2012 included budgetary support, a contribution to the CTF and assistance with 
debt service payments. 

The United Nations System’s Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP) for 2008-2012 outlines a 
program of assistance that leverages the technical expertise of UN organizations including 
UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and UNV.  The CPAP focuses on: achieving MDG targets; livelihood 
development and employment generation activities with an emphasis on women and youth; 
strengthening of accountability and capacity of the national parliament; good governance; 
disaster risk management; environmental sustainability and civil society strengthening. 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
31. 
Throughout the implementation of the CPS program, the World Bank Group will seek to 
draw on the experience and expertise of the Marshall Islands’ development partners to ensure 
that the assistance provided is closely aligned with existing programs and the country’s 
development priorities. 

III. WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT IN THE PACIFIC  

32. 
The World Bank Group’s engagement with Pacific island countries reflects the fact 
their development trajectories will be shaped – more than perhaps any other nations – by their 
economic geography.  The World Bank Group’s Pacific island member countries (excluding 
Papua New Guinea) 10 have a combined population of about 2 million people spread across 
hundreds of islands in an ocean area equivalent to about 15 percent of the globe’s surface.  Given 
the permanent vulnerabilities that confront Pacific island countries stemming from intrinsic 
factors such as their small size, isolation, and enduring institutional and human capacity 
constraints, sustained development support is a long-term proposition requiring collaboration 
with international partners.  Island states themselves also have a central role to play in 
establishing a policy environment that supports and promotes long-term development outcomes.  

33. 
The World Bank Group continues to expand its programs and presence throughout the 
Pacific.  Both IDA and IFC have been increasing their engagement in the Pacific significantly.  
As well as scaling-up in established clients, there is a renewed emphasis on forging relationships 
in countries – such as the Marshall Islands – in which the World Bank historically has been less 
active. The development of individual CPSs for each Pacific island member reflects a 
commitment to a sustained process of country engagement.  The growth of World Bank IDA and 
trust fund commitments made to the Pacific in the last four years – amounting to about US$250m 
– is more than in prior history, as are IFC commitments of almost US$90m.  Reflecting the 
common challenges facing Pacific countries, World Bank Group engagement in the Pacific has 
focused closely on four overarching themes: i) strengthening regional and global integration; ii) 
building resilience to economic shocks, natural disasters and climate change; iii) encouraging 
economic reform and private sector development; and, iv) improving health, education, and 
social services.  This CPS is informed by these themes and  aims to address the Marshall Islands’ 
country-specific development challenges through an adaptive combination of analytical work, 
technical assistance, and lending operations based on the World Bank’s comparative advantage 
and in partnership with other donors. 

34. 
In countries where development is fundamentally constrained by economic geography, 
the objectives of development assistance and the delivery mechanisms used, need to be 
considered carefully.  Economic growth alone is unlikely to generate automatic development 
progress.  Development outcomes should be measured in pragmatic terms such as improvements 
in social indicators, more effective delivery of public services and in increased opportunities for 
the Marshallese.  Since a proliferation of projects would place an unsustainable burden on 
already overstretched public sector, the World Bank will seek to employ modalities that can help 

10 Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
 
strengthen the country's own systems (such as development policy lending and accessing 
regional programs), help leverage the country's IDA allocation and maximize benefits to 
countries facing common regional challenges.   

35. 
A World Bank Group priority will be to translate the credibility and trust generated by 
deepening engagement in the Marshall Islands into a more substantive and coordinated 
dialogue to support its own reform efforts.  The value of World Bank Group engagement is not 
principally defined in terms of the volume of lending, but in the extent to which the World Bank 
can “bundle” its expertise and financing, collaborate with other development partners, transfer 
global knowledge, develop institutional capacity, and support changes that result in significant 
and sustained development progress. 

Translating Pacific Themes into the Marshall Islands Program 

36. 
Like many small Pacific island states, the Marshall Islands faces significant obstacles 
to development.  Isolation, small size, dispersed populations, and the high fixed cost of providing 
public services, present challenges to achieving sustained economic growth in the Marshall 
Islands.  Moreover, "thin" institutional, human, and technical resources demand that limited 
reform capacity be tightly focused on mitigating these disadvantages to the extent possible.  
Increasing economic integration, promoting access to labor markets, employment and 
educational opportunities in metropolitan neighbors and the US, and retaining a more equitable 
share of revenues from natural resources (such as fisheries), will be central to the long-term 
future of the Marshall Islands.   

37. 
Reflecting the Government’s development priorities and the World Bank Group’s 
engagement in the Pacific, the program in the Marshall Islands will focus on strengthening 
economic governance and promoting the effective use of public resources to enhance living 
and service delivery standards for all Marshallese.  Each of the proposed interventions outlined 
in this joint CPS is designed to address this overarching objective.   

38. 
The first IDA operation for the Marshall Islands, to be presented with this CPS, seeks 
to liberalize the ICT sector to foster market competition and to increase access to ICT services.  
The Marshall Islands is one of the least "connected" countries in the world. About 35 percent of 
the population subscribes to ICT services.  Mobile phone penetration is around 26 percent of the 
population.  Less than 2 percent of the population subscribe to an Internet connection.  Mobile 
broadband is not yet available.  Total broadband Internet 11 take-up is approximately 520 
subscribers, or around 1 percent penetration (although only 120 subscribers have subscribed for 
speeds of 512kbs or greater).  This is despite the fact that Majuro and Kwajalein are connected to 
a 10 Gbps capacity fiber-optic cable system that links the Marshall Islands to Guam.  Cable 
capacity is presently under-used, in part due to the monopolistic market environment. 

11 NTA classifies broadband Internet as speeds 128kbs or greater; the International Telecommunications Union definition of 
broadband is a minimum download speed of 256kbps 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
 
39. 
The ICT Sector Development Policy Program is the first in a planned series of three 
development policy operations (DPOs) that aim to support ICT sector reform and reduce the 
economic costs of distance through greater regional and global integration.  The first DPO 
prepares the foundation for the legal and regulatory reforms that are needed to support sector 
liberalization, with the ultimate objective of increasing access to telecommunications and 
promoting the widespread use of ICT services.  Specifically, the operation will support the 
transition from a monopolistic to a liberalized telecommunications market, reform and 
restructure the National Telecommunications Authority (NTA), help develop a new legal and 
regulatory framework, and establish an independent regulatory function.  The ICT DPO program 
has been informed by recent experience of budget support operations in the Marshall Islands 
(such as ADB’s Public Sector Reform Program), and 
the World Bank Group’s 
telecommunications assistance in the Pacific and elsewhere. It has also benefitted from the 
application of international best practice and the IFC’s considerable experience in supporting 
private sector investment in liberalized telecom markets throughout the Pacific.  

40. 
The Marshall Islands' reliance on expensive imported fuel and the current fuel pricing 
model continue to impose severe fiscal challenges, with effects felt throughout the economy.  
World Bank engagement in the energy sector was initiated shortly after the Marshall Islands 
became a member of the World Bank Group in 1992, when the Government requested analysis 
to be undertaken on the energy sector and, specifically, on the role of the state-owned MEC.  
That study, and the assessments undertaken by other partners since then, identified a range of 
important reforms intended to help address the structural challenges facing the sector.  While 
some of the reforms were undertaken, the relative stability and low price of fuel imports in the 
period 1992-2008, reduced the urgency for fundamental reform.  However, the fuel price spikes 
and increasing volatility in 2008 (reaching a high of US$160 per barrel), compounded by a fire 
that disabled the Majuro Number 1 power generation facility, precipitated an economic crisis in 
the country.  The Government was forced to declare an "Economic State of Emergency", as the 
country experienced power rationing and blackouts.  A Government Taskforce was convened to 
review the state of the energy sector and, in 2010, requested further World Bank technical 
assistance.   
41. While the Government has expressed renewed interest in undertaking energy sector 
reform, successfully implementing these complex and wide-ranging measures will be difficult 
and require sustained commitment.  Since 2010, the World Bank has undertaken dialogue on 
energy sector reform, and has outlined a set of carefully sequenced measures that could be 
implemented under a DPO program.  The reforms proposed would seek to move away from the 
current policy that aims to provide cheap power to businesses and citizens and results in just 23 
percent of diesel sold in 2010 being sold at a profit.  The current policy exposes MEC to 
significant cash flow problems, insufficient funding of critical routine maintenance, inefficient 
use of power, and substantial technical inefficiencies.  While key elements of a DPO program 
have been identified, detailed analysis on the potential poverty and social impacts of tax and 
price reforms will be needed.  This analysis will also examine potential gender-specific effects of 
reform. 

15 

 
 
42. 
The Marshall Islands and the other seven member states of the Parties to the Nauru 
Agreement (PNA) 12 account collectively for approximately one-third of global pelagic tuna 
stocks.  The abundant Pacific oceanscape is a shared natural capital asset for the entire region.  It 
provides fish for food, key biodiversity and habitats that support tourism and carbon storage.  
Pacific tuna fisheries yield about 2.4 million tons per annum (58 percent of the global total) with 
a value on the order of US$4.5 billion.  However, little of that annual revenue is captured by 
Pacific island countries as economic rent.   Until 2007 license fees paid to Forum Fisheries 
Agency member countries in exchange for rights to fish tuna totaled only about US$8m each 
year (or about 7 percent of the first sale revenue received).  The introduction of a rights-based 
regime for fishing effort (i.e. the total number of fishing days permitted, known as the Vessel 
Day Scheme) by PNA nations has already resulted in increases to licensing payments made by 
deep water fishing nations to PNA members of US$5,000 per day or about 10 percent of landed 
value with the expectation that the cost vessel days will continue to increase.  
43. 
The Marshall Islands has expressed interest in participating in the Pacific Islands 
Regional Oceanscape Program (PROP) 13.  This regional operation will be the first operation 
piloted under the Global Partnership for Oceans (GPO) 14 that was recently launched.  The 
PROP aims to support Pacific Island Countries in the sustainable management of the region’s 
oceanic fisheries, coastal fisheries and the critical habitats that support them.  The PROP 
investment in the Marshall Islands is expected to concentrate on three areas: (i) strengthening 
regional governance through the implementation of a rights-based fishing management system; 
(ii) supporting systems to improve the management of coastal and reef fisheries, and (iii) 
developing regional frameworks and market systems to improve coastal and regional fisheries 
management.  Assistance to undertake assessments of the relative costs (including gender based 
social costs) and benefits of investments in onshore processing and services associated with tuna 
product value chains would also be supported.  

44. 
The World Bank Group aims to help support the Marshall Islands in making 
preparations to manage its “Post Compact” future.  Although the Compact of Free Association 
does not expire until 2023 (and managing this transition will require concerted attention beyond 
the period of this CPS), the World Bank Group proposes to provide targeted technical assistance 
to strengthen the management of CTF assets.  The World Bank Treasury department is currently 
exploring the development of a regional approach to asset management that will assess the 
strengths and weaknesses of current asset management approaches in the Marshall Islands and in

12 The PNA is a sub-regional agreement that controls fishing in the world’s largest sustainable purse seine fishery.  
The PNA administers fishing activity in the exclusive economic zones of seven Pacific island countries including 
the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, 
and Tuvalu. 
13 PROP is a regional project designed to strengthen the governance and sustainable management of the region's 
fisheries, and to ensure that Pacific countries receive a more equitable share of benefits from this resource.   
14 The GPO is a growing alliance of more than 100 governments, international organizations, civil society groups, 
and private sector interests committed to addressing the threats to the health, productivity and resilience of the 
world’s oceans.  It aims to tackle widely documented problems of overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss.

Business Indicators and enterprise survey data suggest that there may be a range of reforms that 
might enhance the climate for private sector investment.  The joint IFC/WB Indicator-based 
Advisory Group stands ready to help develop a Reform Memorandum that would diagnose the 
principal challenges in the Marshall Islands and could serve as a roadmap for subsequent 
reforms.  Beyond this, as the World Bank Group engagement deepens in the Marshall Islands, 
additional opportunities may be identified in which IFC can support greater private sector 
involvement and investment.  IFC’s Pacific Investment Climate Rapid Response project could 
also provide IFC expertise to assist the Government in identifying potential for private sector 
involvement in service delivery.  

Selectivity, Flexibility and New Ways of Doing Business 

45. 
In providing support to the Marshall Islands, the World Bank Group will exercise a 
high degree of selectivity.  At this initial stage of reengagement in the Marshall Islands, the 
World Bank Group has yet to develop the depth of knowledge and country experience that would 
permit a more expansive program.  The program outlined in this CPS is informed by the themes 
that guide the World Bank Group's engagement throughout the Pacific, and aims to replicate 
successful approaches in the World Bank's other Pacific country programs.  Acknowledging the 
challenge of calibrating World Bank Group interventions to the limited capacity of this small 
state, all activities will be carefully designed in collaboration with the Government, and 
instruments more suitable to low capacity contexts, such as development policy lending and 
regional approaches, will be utilized wherever appropriate.  The World Bank Group will retain 
flexibility and, as the partnership with Government deepens, the World Bank expects to play a 
greater role in addressing the substantial threats that the Marshall Islands faces from natural 
hazards, the effects of climate change and sea-level rise. 

46. 
Developing leadership and institutions in the Marshall Islands capable of successfully 
implementing reforms demands World Bank Group commitment to a sustained capacity 
enhancement effort.  The Marshall Islands, and islands throughout the Pacific, face significant 
challenges in recruiting and retaining domestic expertise.  In "micro-states" such as the Marshall 
Islands, the size of the population and the pull of opportunities overseas only increase this 
challenge.  By being selective, flexible, and by adopting a pragmatic approach to these 
constraints, the World Bank Group will place a premium on coordination, intensive 
implementation support and on projects whose design is carefully calibrated to the country's 
capacity. 

47. 
A targeted program of analytical work that focuses on sectors in which the World Bank 
Group is initiating engagement and complements analysis being undertaken by other partners 
is proposed.  Indicative analytical and technical assistance activities anticipated during the CPS 
period are set out below: 

Box 2:  Proposed Analytical, Advisory and Technical Assistance Activities

• 
Investment Climate Diagnostic 
• Beneficiary Impact Assessment on ICT Reform with Gender Focus

Financing Terms and Sources 

48. 
The indicative IDA16 resource envelope is on grant terms and amounts to SDR7.6m 
(US$ equivalent 11.4m).  The CPS spans two years in the IDA16 period (FY13 and FY14) and 
two years in the IDA17 period (FY15 and FY16).  It is assumed that the IDA17 envelope will be 
equivalent to the IDA16 level, but only the FY13 amount is firm, while the amounts for FY14-16 
are indicative only.  Actual allocations will depend on:  i) the country's own performance; ii) its 
performance relative to other IDA recipients; iii) the amount of overall resources available to 
IDA; iv) changes to the list of IDA-eligible countries; and v) terms of financial assistance 
provided (grants or credits). Also, the Marshall Islands could potentially benefit from additional 
resources from the IDA Regional Program, which provides financing on top of national IDA 
envelope to promote regional integration by supporting qualified multi-country regional 
operations. Furthermore, in case of severe economic shocks and natural disasters, the Marshall 
Islands could potentially access the IDA Crisis Response Window. 15

49. 
The World Bank's expanded program of Pacific engagement has been made possible 
through access to trust funds, and IDA is expected to leverage trust fund resources in the 
Marshall Islands.  While the principal trust fund resources available to the Pacific countries 
have been from donors (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) with longstanding relationships in the 
South Pacific, it is expected that as the World Bank Group’s program in North Pacific countries 
such as the Marshall Islands are developed there will be opportunities to provide increased trust 
fund resources.  Looking to global programs, both the GEF and the Global Facility for Disaster 
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) are also expected to provide support.   

IV. MANAGING RISK    

50. 
Absolute capacity limitations could constrain program implementation.  The enduring 
nature of capacity constraints in micro-states such as the Marshall Islands pose extraordinary 
challenges to effective implementation, and is only exacerbated by the lack of in-country 
presence.  Experience from the World Bank Group's engagement in other small states such as 
Kiribati and Tuvalu underscores the importance of calibrating and sequencing interventions 

15 For details of the eligibility criteria, see Annex 3 of IDA (2011) “Additions to IDA Resources: Sixteenth 
Replenishment,” available at http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/IDA16_Report-English-Final.pdf.

carefully, and in designing operations that account specifically for the current level of capacity.  
An explicit recognition of the need for intensive and sustained implementation support will be 
paramount. 

51. 
The Marshall Islands remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, and subject to 
many factors beyond its control.  Reliance on imports whose prices are subject to considerable 
volatility (particularly petroleum products) poses significant macroeconomic threats to the 
Marshall Islands.  The World Bank Group stands ready to offer continued support under this 
CPS to reform efforts in the energy sector to mitigate these risks.  The Marshall Islands is also 
highly vulnerable to natural disasters and sea-level rise.  The World Bank will look for 
opportunities to strengthen the disaster risk management capacity of the Marshall Islands, and to 
help the Marshall Islands build resilience to external shocks, including natural and man-made 
disasters.  Additionally, the World Bank Group will promote stronger regional and global 
integration through enhanced ICT connections, as well as making appropriate use of regional 
interventions that encourage exchange and closer integration with neighboring countries. The 
World Bank will also work with the authorities to fully explore the flexible use of IDA 
assistance, including of the Immediate Response Mechanism that allows the inclusion of 
emergency related contingent components in selected projects to further support rapid response 
in eligible crisis and emergency situations. 

52. 
The macroeconomic policy framework is dependent on continued availability of grants 
from development partners, and subject to high levels of uncertainty.  A sharper than expected 
rise in global commodity prices would exacerbate inflation, and lead to further contractions of 
the Marshall Islands economy.  The macroeconomic policy framework also depends on the 
continued availability of grants from development partners over the medium-term, especially the 
US, and the inadvisability of borrowing to fund fiscal deficits.  The World Bank Group will 
continue to work in close collaboration with the IMF as well as with other donors including the 
ADB, Australia, and the US to monitor changes in the macroeconomic situation and ensure that 
the World Bank Group’s assistance is effectively coordinated and aligned with Government 
priorities. 

53. 
The prospective end of Compact funding presents a fundamental challenge to fiscal 
sustainability in the Marshall Islands.  No further Compact financing is assured beyond the life 
of the current arrangements.  The CTF that has been established to replace Compact grants from 
2024 is not currently at a level which would ensure a smooth transition to budgetary self-
reliance.  The World Bank Group's program is intended to support the important structural 
reforms that are needed to return the Marshall Islands to a more sustainable fiscal path. 

54. 
To mitigate the above risks, the World Bank Group will continue to draw on the 
experience and expertise of longstanding partners, and will find ways to adapt its approaches 
and operational models to achieve results on the ground.  The World Bank Group is proposing 
a program that is intended to be both pragmatic and flexible, and one that draws on relevant 
regional and global experience, as well as that of partners with a longer track record in the 
Marshall Islands.  The absence of the World Bank Group in-country presence underscores the 
need for donor coordination issues to be carefully and creatively managed.

Medium-term Goals 
Enhanced energy 
security through 
effective regulation, 
management and 
governance of the energy 
sector 

Key Issues 
Outdated MEC business model 
and fuel price volatility has 
resulted in economy-wide 
impacts, poor service, high 
cost, and inadequate 
maintenance of MEC assets. 

Increased net economic 
benefits to the country 
from its fisheries, 
through transparent and 
sustainable management 
of ocean resources 

Pacific tuna fisheries yield 
about 58 percent of the global 
total with an estimated  value of 
US$4.5 billion but countries 
such as the Marshall Islands 
retain only 7 percent of the first 
sale revenue  

Enhanced capacity to 
manage the Post-
Compact transition to 
increased budgetary self-
reliance 

Expiry of Compact funding 
requires effective management 
of public and external resources 
and increased support for 
private sector development 

Expected CPS Outcomes Milestones 
Cost reflective fuel tariffs 
• Government adoption of 
introduced: 
electricity tariff review 
• Reform MEC’s fuel prices 
proposals 
such that: a) the full cost 
• Undertake essential 
of supply e.g. capital costs, 
maintenance of auxiliary 
depreciation and O&M are 
generators 
recovered; b) capital 
• Increase frequency of 
expenses to upgrade 
meter-reading, improve 
MEC’s fuel tank farm to 
billing and collection 
safe standards can be 
rates 
financed 
• Technical and non-
technical losses reduced 
from 18 percent (2010) to 
14 percent over a 4 year 
period 
• Increase in the percentage 
of the landed value of the 
tuna caught in RMI's 
waters that is retained by 
the country via sale of 
access rights, from 10 
percent to 12 percent
