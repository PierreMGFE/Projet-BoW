REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA  
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Background: Zambia has had a long period of political stability. With strong growth in the last 
decade the country has reached lower middle income status. However, the economy remains 
mainly dependent on copper and more than 60 percent of Zambians live below the poverty line. 
Human development indicators lag the Sub-Saharan Africa average. Over the past decade the 
Gini coefficient worsened from 0.47 to 0.52.  The potential and the need to increase agricultural 
productivity and develop the private sector remain huge.  
Government development plan and CPS alignment: The Government that came to power in 
September 2011 aims for a better Zambia for all and identified poverty reduction, jobs creation 
and improving governance as its main priorities. The Sixth National Development Plan identifies 
the following overarching objectives: to accelerate infrastructure development, economic growth 
and diversification; promote rural investment and accelerate poverty reduction; and enhance 
human development. The CPS is aligned with the Government’s development priorities. In a 
country that displays both low income and middle income characteristics, the CPS will support 
three objectives that speak to the dual nature of Zambia’s development challenges and 
opportunities: (i) Reducing poverty and the vulnerability of the poor; (ii) Improving 
competitiveness and infrastructure for growth and employment: (iii) Improving governance and 
strengthening economic management. The specific activities supported have been identified 
through the systematic application of several guiding principles to enhance relevance and 
selectivity.  
Aid flows to Zambia are declining and the Government is looking to the private market to raise 
resources. The Bank’s contribution to Zambia’s needs for development finance during the CPS 
period will be relatively small (IDA about US$100 million a year). Building on lessons of 
experience from the last CAS and working with other cooperating partners, World Bank, IFC and 
MIGA (WBG) will: (i) intervene pragmatically and selectively in areas where its limited 
resources can play a catalytic role and support public goods that provide the basis for economic 
development; (ii) increasingly leverage its global outreach and draw upon knowledge and 
partnerships to bring technical expertise and knowledge to bear on Zambia’s development; (iii) 
adopt an incremental approach to supporting reform that has proven effective in Zambia.  
Reducing poverty and vulnerability of the poor: The WBG will provide support in areas such 
as research, extension, irrigation, rural roads, agri-business development, to help unlock the 
potential of the agriculture sector in which the majority of the poor, particularly women, are 
engaged. Programs designed to protect vulnerable families and promote job opportunities among 
them will be supported.  
Improving competitiveness and infrastructure for growth and employment: IFC and World 
Bank will together provide support for enhancing the enabling environment for private sector 
development. Projects for improving supply and access to electricity, transport infrastructure, 
access to finance and better access to water for hydro-power generation and industry will be 
implemented. The CPS gives special attention to promoting greater regional integration and 
cooperation in matters of trade, transport policy, agricultural research and water resource 
management. 

vii 

 
 
Improving governance and strengthening economic management: Strengthening institutions 
and capacity so that Zambia can use its growing domestic resources and non-concessional 
borrowing effectively to support its development will be a priority. Other activities, such as 
building statistical capacity, monitoring and evaluation and providing timely and credible 
economic information to inform policy debate will also be supported. 
The Bank will work with the Government to monitor portfolio performance and is taking several 
steps to improve portfolio quality and disbursements. There are political, institutional and 
external risks involved in achieving the results of the CPS but the WBG will take steps to 
mitigate those risks. A CPS progress report in 2014 will provide an opportunity to update the 
assessment of the country context and opportunities and risks.

REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA  
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Zambia is riding on a number of successes. The economy has grown at 5.7 percent per 
annum over the last decade and Zambia was among the 10 fastest growing economies of Sub-Saharan 
Africa in 2012. Fast growth has enabled it to attain lower middle income country (MIC) status with a 
nominal per capita income of US$1,299 (2011). Investor confidence has been high as evidenced in the 
successful issue of the US$750 million Euro bond. In 2011 it successfully held national elections in 
which the long standing ruling party was defeated by the opposition and there was a peaceful transfer of 
power.  

2. 
Zambia also presents difficult development challenges. The economy remains largely 
undiversified and mainly dependent on copper with economic activity mostly concentrated in the 
urban areas. Income distribution is highly unequal (0.52 Gini co-efficient) and on several development 
dimensions the country is indistinguishable or worse than many low income countries (LIC) (Table 1). 
Zambia is also lagging on a number of MDG targets—particularly those on extreme poverty and 
maternal and child mortality (Annex 4). Institutional capacity remains weak and according to the recent 
public sector governance surveys such as the World Governance Indicators (WGI) (see Annex 2) and 
Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) where Zambia ranked 91st out of 153, 
the country’s governance challenges need to be addressed. Recent Government actions (e.g. reversal of 
the railway concession, interest rate cap) are perceived by some sections of stakeholders as having 
created incoherence in the policy environment.

Note: Latest available data. *As per World Bank July 2012 classification of low-income and lower middle income countries. 
Lower and upper middle income countries are separated at an average income of US $4,036. 

3. 
The Government aims to reduce poverty, create jobs and make Zambia a prosperous 
MIC by 2030.  The Government aims for a better Zambia for all and build on the country’s rich 
resources (land, water and minerals) and past achievements to make growth inclusive. The Vision 2030 
document lays out the country’s aspirations and the challenges of achieving prosperous MIC status over 
the next generation. The Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP) elaborates the medium-term 
development objectives for the period 2011-2015 focusing on policies, strategies and programs that 
contribute to addressing the challenges of realizing broad-based pro-poor growth. In this context, 
though there is a mixed track record globally of converting mineral wealth into widely-shared 
prosperity, Zambia’s mining sector, with strengthened institutions and sounder policies, could

potentially contribute to broader development in the country. The Government is however, keen to 
diversify the economy and also effectively utilize Zambia’s other resources to promote inclusive 
growth.   

4. 
In a country that displays both low income and middle income characteristics, the World 
Bank Group’s (WBG’s) role will be twofold i.e. contributing to poverty reduction and supporting 
the transition to a prosperous MIC. There is an urgency to tackle the country’s poverty and diversify 
the sources of growth. The overall resource needs to meet Zambia’s development goals are huge; but 
traditional aid is declining and the IDA envelope for Zambia is also limited (about US$100 million a 
year). However, the WBG’s global outreach to draw on partnerships and bring technical expertise and 
knowledge to bear on Zambia’s development is large. The latter could be utilized more effectively to 
strengthen institutions and improve economic management towards helping Zambia increase its own 
capacity to use its resources and institutions effectively. During the next four years, the WBG will 
position itself to transition from a lending institution to being a solutions one that, in the words of the 
WBG President Dr. Kim, “connects and convenes multiple stakeholders from around the world 
brokering knowledge exchange across institutional boundaries.” The WBG will also draw on its 
tremendous experience accumulated over decades of working with different countries to find the space 
in the current policy environment to support programs and projects that can effectively support 
Zambia’s development. The WBG’s strategic plan for support is laid out in this Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS). 

5. 
The CPS covers FY13-FY16 and reflects the Government’s priorities. The last WBG 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY08-11) was discussed by the Board on April 8, 2008. In 2011, a 
CAS Progress Report (CASPR) extended that strategy until December 2012 to provide an opportunity 
to engage the newly elected Government in the preparation of the new strategy. The CPS reflects the 
Government’s development priorities as reflected in the development plan and Vision 2030 and is a 
“partnership” strategy prepared collaboratively with the Government and in consultation with civil 
society, cooperating partners (CPs), and other stakeholders. It puts forward an integrated World Bank, 
IFC and MIGA strategy—a WBG strategic plan—for supporting Zambia’s development. It also reflects 
the principles agreed upon by the CPs as articulated in the Second Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia 
(JASZII) 2011-2015.  

6. 
Outline of the CPS. The CPS has five chapters. The first chapter provides a country context 
followed by a description of the key development challenges, the country’s development plan and a 
summary of CPs support. Chapter II reviews the WBG’s past support to the country, Chapters III and 
IV lay out the key features of this CPS including objectives, guiding principles of engagement and 
expected results. Chapter V notes the risks and the strategy for mitigation.  

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A.  Institutional and Political Context 

7. 
The Zambian Government structure consists of three arms—the executive, the legislature 
and the judiciary. According to the current Constitution the President, is the head of the State and is 
also at the apex of the executive decision-making structure. The Presidential authority is exercised 
through a Cabinet, comprising ministers who are drawn from among elected or nominated Members of 
Parliament. Zambia has a centralized system of Government. A process to review the Constitution is 
currently underway and is likely to result in devolution of some powers to the lower levels of 
Government.  

2 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
8. 
Zambia has relatively well designed systems, rules and laws 1 that allow for both internal 
and external checks and balances, but they could be more effective. A process of reform over the 
last two decades led to improvements in administrative systems and procedures, such as improved 
service conditions and rationalized payroll, reforms in public financial management and the business 
environment. However, inadequate institutional capacity has created implementation challenges and 
made internal checks and balances difficult. Citizen oversight through social accountability is also 
weak. The Auditor Generals’ reports continue to report misuse and misappropriation of public 
resources with limited follow up of audit report issues and recommendations.   

9. 
The peaceful transfer of power in the last elections from an incumbent party has solidified 
Zambia’s democratic credentials.  This is the second time power was transferred from a longstanding 
incumbent to an opposition party (1991 and 2011). Zambia has held six successful and peaceful multi-
party elections. In the September 2011 elections, Patriotic Front (PF) defeated the long-ruling 
Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).  

10. 
The new Government also identified poverty reduction, jobs creation and improving 
governance as its main priorities, however, the Government’s policies are still evolving and the 
implementation strategy has yet to be concretized.  There is also concern amongst some stakeholders 
consulted during the preparation of the CPS about the negative impact of policy incoherence on 
effective long-term planning and the environment for private sector development. While achieving 
inclusive growth in Zambia is a long term agenda, the Government has found it difficult to undertake 
much-needed policy reforms in sectors such as agriculture on which the vast majority of the very poor 
are dependent. Strengthening public sector implementation capacity would help with implementation of 
critical policy actions.    

B.  Poverty and Social Context  
11. 
Zambia’s rank in the United Nations 
Development 
Program 
(UNDP) Human 
Development Index (HDI), a composite measure 
of life expectancy, education, and incomes, is 
below the Sub-Saharan Africa average.  In 2011 
Zambia's HDI was 0.430, a rank of 164 out of 187 
countries with comparable data. Overtime, the HDI 
for Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 0.365 in 
1980 to 0.463 today, and Zambia falls below this 
regional average.

12. 
 Despite robust annual growth in the last 
decade, poverty, particularly in the rural areas 
remains stubbornly high. The effect of economic 
growth on overall poverty reduction has been small, 
as much of the benefits of growth have accrued to 
those already above the poverty line. Growth was 
driven by industries such as mining, construction and financial services and did little to create jobs and 
expand opportunities beyond the small labor force already employed in these industries. The urban-
centered growth also did not generate better incomes, health, nutrition and key services for the majority 
of Zambians living in the rural areas and dependent on agriculture. Rural poverty at 74 percent is more 
than double the urban poverty of 35 percent. Thirty nine percent of the population lives in extreme 
poverty, with insufficient consumption to meet daily minimum food requirements. Almost 90 percent 

Note:  People living in moderate poverty are those whose 
total expenditures are below the national poverty line.  
People living in extreme poverty have total expenditures that 
are below the food-poverty line.

of Zambians below the extreme poverty line are in rural areas, where the poverty gap ratio 2 is far higher 
(20 versus 3.7 percent in urban areas) (World Bank 2012d).

 Income inequality has been growing in 
Zambia. Disparities between the rural and urban 
areas 
increased overtime. Annual consumption 
growth was less than 1 percent for most of the rural 
population between 2006 and 2010, whereas growth 
in urban areas was about 2 percent for the first four 
quintiles and much higher for the wealthiest quintile 
(World Bank 2012d). Over the past decade the Gini 
coefficient worsened from 0.47 to 0.52.  Interprovincial comparisons also show that rural provinces, 
such as Western, Northern, Luapula and Eastern, have much higher poverty levels (Table 2). The recent 
Economic Brief produced by the Bank also found that the distribution of opportunities for access to 
basic education, health and infrastructure services in Zambia closely mirrors the spatial distribution of 
poverty, implying that poorer regions have lower access to opportunities. 3

 Women face particular challenges. In 
2010, poverty 
incidence among female-headed 
households was slightly higher than male –headed 
households (62.5 versus 60 percent). Zambian 
women’s opportunity to contribute to and benefit 
from productive participation in the labor force 
appears to be less than that of men. In 2009, the 
female labor force participation rate was 59.5 
percent, compared to a rate of 79.2 percent for men. 
Vocational courses present an opportunity for more 
market-tailored education, but there are large gender 
disparities in this area. Women make up less than 20 
percent of technical and vocational education programs and this negatively influences their productive 
participation in the formal workforce. In addition, in rural areas, it is usually customary law that 
determines land allocation and inheritance and the traditional rules regulating land allocation and 
inheritance disadvantage women. Women are also more likely to be in lower productivity jobs than 
men—for example more women work in agriculture and micro-enterprises while men are more likely 
to work in mining and small and medium-sized enterprises.

Both deforestation and climate change, if left unaddressed, will exacerbate poverty and 
curb economic growth and will make it more challenging for Zambia to achieve MDG 7 on 
environmental sustainability. Nearly sixty six percent of Zambia's land area is classified as forests but 
most of the resource is highly degraded and deforestation is occurring at 0.33 percent a year (WDI 
2012). The poorest and most vulnerable tend to live in districts most exposed to frequent droughts and 
floods. With livelihoods that are highly dependent on climate sensitive agriculture and natural 
resources, they also have a low capacity to adapt. In the absence of adaptation, rainfall variability alone 
could keep an additional 300,000 Zambians below the poverty line and cost Zambia at least US$4.3 
billion in lost GDP over the next decade. This could reduce future annual growth by 0.9 percentage 
points (World Bank 2009). 

16. 
Progress has occurred on health indicators but Zambia may still not be able to meet the 
health related MDGs. The 2007 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS 2007) show notable 
reductions in maternal, infant and under five mortality rates between 2002 and 2007 (Table 3). 
However, the annual rates of reduction of 2.1 percent for under-5 mortality and 2.5 percent for maternal 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mortality for the period 1990–2011 are less than half the annual rates of reduction required to achieve 
the MDGs targets. 

17. 
Zambia has achieved high levels of access to basic education but challenges remain.  The 
primary completion rate (PCR) increased from 67 percent in 1998 to universal completion in 2010. The 
proportion of children aged 15 to 19 that complete each grade has also increased substantially between 
1992 and 2010 (Figure 1). Regionally benchmarked learning assessment results however, show that 
Zambian students have severe learning deficits. 4 Learning outcomes are also an issue at institutions of 
higher learning and the Government has commenced the review of education policy and the Education 
Act of 2011. The Government is also working on legislation to put in place a framework to regulate and 
improve education quality standards in private universities and tertiary institutions. Overcrowding in 
classrooms and gender inequalities in secondary and tertiary education still remain major challenges.  

C. Economic Context 
18. 
Zambia’s land area of 753,000 square kilometers holds only about 13.5 million people, an 
average density of 18 persons per square kilometer. The countryside particularly is very sparsely 
populated, making service delivery a challenge. The country’s small population is however, growing at 
a relatively fast rate of 2.7 percent (Annex 3). 5 The population is also young, with about half being 
under the age of 15 years.  

19. 
 Zambia’s young population faces limited economic 
opportunities mainly because of 
inadequate economic 
diversification. Underemployment is the main issue in the rural 
areas whereas open unemployment is more of an issue in the 
urban areas. Policy makers in Zambia are concerned about the 
serious social and political implications of economic exclusion of 
youth. Discussions with various youth groups as a part of the 
CPS consultations brought out concerns about limited access to information and finance, inadequate 
financial literacy, few jobs and limited opportunities for acquiring relevant technical skills as some of 
the challenges that this group faces. 6

20. 
The agriculture sector employs more than 70 percent of the population but contributes 
about 14 percent to real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 7. Two-thirds of Zambians live in the rural 
areas and mostly depend on rain-fed agriculture whose overall productivity remains low even in 
comparison with LICs (Table 4). 8 The mean size of the land holding is 3.27 hectares and the small-
scale farming systems are overwhelmingly dominated by a single crop—maize. Nearly eighty three 
percent of all households grow maize (LCMS 2010).  

21. 
Copper mining and processing are the mainstay of the Zambian economy, the engine of 
GDP growth in recent years and foreign exchange earnings (Annex 13). Mining and quarrying 
contribute about 12 percent to real GDP and 80 percent to exports (World Bank 2012d). Manufacturing 
and construction together contribute about 20 percent and services 54 percent. Part of the construction 
and services are a result of the mining sector. The copper industry’s potential, to contribute to poverty 
reduction remains under-utilized (Annex 13 Box 1). 

22. 
Zambia has a dualistic private sector. About 200 large enterprises located mostly in urban 
areas produce the bulk of industrial output. These large capital-intensive enterprises, mostly in mining, 
and to a lesser extent manufacturing, have higher productivity but provide limited employment (7 
percent). The medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) are located mostly in rural areas (81 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percent) (Zambia Business Survey 2010). They have much lower productivity and employ 88 percent 
of the labor force.  

23. 
Zambia’s land-locked position is a disadvantage in many ways, although its geographical 
location within Southern Africa is potentially conducive to increased regional trade. As a 
landlocked country Zambia confronts costs (both time and dollars) in accessing global markets. Delays 
at intermediate borders, high fuel prices and the poor quality of roads compound the adverse impact of 
the long distances from the ports (World Bank 2012c). The “land-linked” position, however, is 
advantageous for regional trade. Zambia has borders with eight countries and is the start, destination or 
transit country for five of the 18 major transit corridors in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank 2008).9 
However, the poor competitiveness of Zambian firms, among other factors, has prevented Zambia from 
exploiting the potential of its strategic geographical location to further its own development.

Zambia's rich natural endowments offer opportunities for growth from diverse economic 
activities such as agriculture (including livestock and fisheries), tourism, and hydro-energy. 
However, even with some exceptional natural tourism resources, such as Victoria Falls, Luangwa 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
National Park and the Lower Zambezi, tourism today contributes less than 3 percent to GDP. With the 
favorable land and water resources both food and cash crop production could be significantly increased 
and agro-processing developed to create jobs. Similarly, Zambia's outstanding natural grazing areas and 
water resources in rivers, lakes and swamps could support a much larger livestock and fisheries 
population and provide for substantially increased animal food production. Zambia could also better 
exploit its strategic position within the Zambezi River Basin and improve energy production and 
irrigation to contribute to diversification and growth. 

25. 
A combination of prudent macroeconomic management, market liberalization and 
privatization efforts have enabled Zambia to accelerate growth. Substantially increased copper 
production in response to privatization and steep increase in world copper prices contributed to this 
achievement. The Government consolidated macroeconomic stability under the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) programs (the last of which concluded in June 2011) and successfully navigated the shocks 
connected with the 2008 global economic and financial crises. Annual inflation declined from about 30 
percent in 2000 to 7.2 percent in 2011 (Table 5). The completion of the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relieve Initiative (MDRI) provided Zambia with about US$6.5 
billion in debt relief, which provided the much-needed fiscal space by reducing debt service 
obligations. In addition, debt relief improved Zambia's external position and enabled building up of 
foreign-exchange reserves. This, in turn, has strengthened the country's ability to manage volatility in 
its exchange rate and bolstered the financial system. This enduring stability has supported robust 
growth, a marked turnaround from a decade ago.

 With 
declining 
aid, 
the 
Government has escalated domestic 
resource mobilization efforts. The level of 
aid to Zambia has sharply declined in the 
past five years.  In 2012, grants, including 
both budget support and project grants, 
amounted to about 6 percent of Government 
expenditure (1.6 percent of GDP) compared 
to 22 percent in 2004 and a peak of 27 
percent 
in 2002. The decline 
in aid 
highlighted the importance of domestic 
resource mobilization and the Government 
is making attempts to increase domestic 
revenues. Several changes were made to the 
mining fiscal regime in 2009. During the 
period 2008-11, mining revenues averaged 
around 2.6 percent of GDP, a sharp increase 
from the previous range of 1-1.4 percent of GDP. In 2012 revenues are expected to come in at 3.8 
percent of GDP despite a decline in mining output, partly due to an increase in royalty rates. The 2013 
budget proposes further rationalization of the mining fiscal regime and measures to improve tax 
compliance while keeping the regime predictable. A comprehensive review of tax policy is also 
proposed in 2013 focusing on rationalizing of tax incentives and simplification of the tax system for 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

27. 
To meet its needs for development finance, the Government has also accelerated 
borrowing on non-concessional terms. Between July 2011 and September 2012, the Government 
borrowed about $1.25 billion from non-concessional sources alone including the recent issue of a 
sovereign bond for US $750 million. The Government is also relying on public-private partnerships in 
infrastructure to meet the demands for infrastructure finance. 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
28. 
Zambia is using its growing central budget resources mostly to provide for ramping up of 
public investments in infrastructure but the capacity to appraise and implement projects is weak. 
The capital budget has risen from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2012. The 2013 
budget proposes a capital budget of a similar magnitude with bulk of the resources planned to be spent 
on transport and energy infrastructure. Most of the proceeds of the sovereign bond are also proposed to 
be used to finance infrastructure projects (Table 6). The Finance Minister’s 2013 budget speech also 
acknowledged that project appraisal is weak and promises to “institutionalize a rigorous appraisal 
system for screening investment projects in order to ensure that borrowed funds are only applied to 
infrastructure projects that directly and demonstrably contribute to the nation’s economic growth.” 

29. 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is complementing public investment in a significant 
manner but could be at risk. Zambia's FDI regime is one of the most open in Africa (see for example 
OECD, 2012 Investment Policy Review Zambia 2012). Political stability is one of the major factors 
explaining the country’s attractiveness for investments (para 9). FDI rose from approximately 
US$164.9 million in 2003 to US$1.73 billion in 2010 with most investments going to mining, 
manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade 10. However, the signals emanating from several policy 
actions by the Government, such as abrupt reversals of Zamtel privatization and the railway concession, 
are perceived by some stakeholders as creating an incoherent policy environment for private 
investment. The mining companies have also complained about changes to the fiscal regime such as the 
doubling of royalty in 2012 and treatment of capital expenditure for tax purposes. The adoption of 
Statutory Instrument (SI) 33 which prohibits domestic transactions in any currency other than Kwachas 
is also seen by some stakeholders to have increased uncertainty among investors. 

MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 

30. 
Overall, Zambia’s medium-term economic outlook remains steady but vulnerable to 
downside risks from a global economic slowdown. Real GDP growth is projected to stay above 7 
percent in the medium-term based on continued growth in the mining, construction, and tourism 
sectors, and expansion in the manufacturing, transportation, and communications industries (Table 5). 
In 2013 and 2014, mining and quarrying are projected to grow at 14.3 and 18 percent respectively 
(World Bank 2012d). These projections however, face downside risks because of global economic 
slowdown, particularly in China. An unexpectedly large drop in copper prices resulting from slowdown 
in emerging economies could weaken the country’s prospects for growth and affect its fiscal and 
external balances severely. In addition, the tourism sector is especially susceptible to adverse changes 
in the external environment. 

31. 
The macroeconomic framework will be put to test should the risks materialize but can 
withstand the shocks with some adjustment. If risks materialize, Zambia will have some 
maneuverability on the monetary side. The foreign reserve position covering three months of imports 
should allow absorption of shocks to the overall balance of payments to some extent, beyond which, the 
flexible exchange rate regime should keep external balance from swinging too far. However, unlike the 
2008-09 crises, the Government does not have a fiscal cushion and adjustment will be needed. It is 
expected that the Government should be willing to cut spending pro-cyclically, if needed given that 
most of the recent increase in spending is on discretionary capital budget. 

32. 
There are also perceived concerns emanating from recent policy actions. Several policy 
actions such as the rebasing of the currency, adoption of Statutory Instrument (SI) 33, increase in 
capital requirements for foreign banks and interest rate caps on lending by commercial banks have been 
taken by the Government to strengthen economic management. However, a range of stakeholders have 
been concerned about economic policy priorities of the Government and the process by which they are 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arrived at. Unbudgeted fuel subsidies, significant overruns in the cost of maize marketing, and pension 
arrears have also led to the weakening of fiscal discipline.  

33. 
Zambia’s stock of external and public debt remains relatively low but needs careful 
management. The Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis for Low Income Countries (LIC 
DSA) conducted in April 2012 suggests that Zambia’s risk of debt distress remains low. 11 The external 
debt indicators remain well below their thresholds in the baseline scenario and bound tests. The public 
debt DSA also suggests that Zambia’s overall public sector debt dynamics are sustainable in light of the 
current size and the evolution of the domestic debt stock in the baseline scenario. The non-concessional 
borrowing in 2011-12 is unlikely to worsen Zambia’ debt outlook if debt is managed carefully. 12 
Besides sound macroeconomic policies, both strong debt management and project appraisal capacity 
are needed to maintain debt sustainability in the face of increasing dependence on non-concessional 
borrowing. An exception to IDA’s Non-concessional Borrowing Policy is being considered by Bank’s 
Management and the country team is discussing non-zero limits on non-concessional borrowing for 
2013 with the Government.  

D. Key Development Challenges  
34. 
Development challenges in four broad areas are discussed in this section —reducing poverty, 
related vulnerabilities and accelerating human development; promoting agricultural growth and 
diversification; improving competitiveness; and improving governance and strengthening economic 
management. Chapter 3—paragraph 96 then notes what contribution the WBG will make in each area.  

REDUCING POVERTY, RELATED VULNERABILITIES AND ACCELERATING HUMAN 
DEVELOPMENT 

35. 
Reducing poverty is the greatest development challenge for Zambia. The country’s low 
rank on the HDI (para 11), indicates the vulnerabilities faced by the majority of Zambians: 
malnourishment, limited education opportunities to improve their conditions, health and water supply 
and sanitation services. According to 2010 LCMS, 46.7 percent of children under-five years are 
stunted, close to the high levels of the early 1990s. There are two main reasons for under-nutrition in 
children: inadequate dietary intake resulting from suboptimal maternal and infant feeding practices and 
the heavy burden of malaria, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections (World Bank 
2012m)—both factors associated with poverty. Chronic malnutrition in childhood has also negatively 
influenced learning abilities among children from the poorest households. 

36. 
There are several on-going safety net programs in Zambia that directly transfer either in-
kind resources or cash to poor households, but have limited effectiveness (World Bank 2012m). 
Government is committed to addressing chronic under-nutrition and strengthening the country's 
capacity for service delivery for vulnerable and at-risk populations. It requested the World Bank to 
undertake a comprehensive review of existing safety nets that is expected to inform the policy makers' 
work in this area. The Bank's analysis found that current Government transfers and safety net programs 
are not targeted to the poor and that almost none of the very poor are currently benefitting from public 
transfer programs. In addition, benefits from education and health spending have also not been 
progressive.  

37. 
 For close to two decades, successive Zambian governments have supported health sector 
reforms, to provide cost-effective and quality health services to the population. The reforms have 
generally centered on the delivery of primary health care through a decentralized health system.  
Multilateral and bilateral CPs, faith-based and for-profit private health providers have also provided 
significant support to the health sector over the years.

38. 
 But achieving the health-
related MDGs by 2015 remains a 
key development challenge.  At the 
current pace, 
(1990-2011 
level), 
Zambia will only be able to meet the 
MDG targets for under-5 mortality and maternal mortality after the year 2040. 13 Zambia is also one of 
the reproductive health priority countries because of both high maternal mortality and high fertility rate 
of 6.26 (World Bank 2010b). The recent WDR 2012 on Gender notes that average fertility among 
women in the poorest quintile in Zambia is 8.5 children (the highest in the world) but for women in the 
richest fifth it is just over 3.

39. 
External aid has contributed to increased access to essential services but most of it has 
been targeted for specific diseases.  Malaria control has been impressive (Table 7). The TB treatment 
success rate increased from 79 percent in 2005 to 86 percent in 2010, slightly above the WHO target of 
85 percent. HIV/TB collaborative activities are being implemented in all the provinces and districts and 
this increased the rate of HIV testing among TB patients from 23 percent in 2006 to 72 percent in 2009. 
The number of centers administering services to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV increased 
to 1,100 in 2010 from 936 in 2009. However, Zambia continues to have a very high HIV prevalence of 
about 14.3 percent for the 15-49 year-old cohort. Most of the external assistance has been targeted for 
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis and not for overall health system strengthening. As highlighted in 
the 2009 Zambia health public expenditure review, much of the donor funding is off-budget while the 
priorities of the global vertical sponsors often supersede national priorities and needs. 

40. 
The joint work by the Government, Bank and other partners identifies severe shortages in 
human resources for health, weak drug and medical supplies logistic management, poor health 
infrastructure, among others 14, 15, 16 There is a 59 percent gap in the total number of staff positions for 
clinical health workers (doctors, clinical officers, nurses, midwives and other paramedics). Severe 
understaffing and low morale among health workers, as highlighted in the 2007 Public Expenditure 
Tracking Survey (PETS), adds to the challenge.  Weak drug and medical supplies logistic systems, poor 
health infrastructure, low quality monitoring and evaluation systems, cultural and community barriers, 
and the overall mixed record of the country on service delivery are other critical constraints to 
improving health and nutrition outcomes.  

1990 2008 

Table 8: Access to Clean Water and Sanitation  

41. 
Inadequate access to clean and safe 
water and sanitation also increases the risks 
of diseases. Despite improvements over time, 
Zambia is behind schedule in meeting the clean 
water and sanitation MDG targets (Table 8). In 
addition, 
the quality of service 
is poor, 
particularly in the rural and peri-urban areas. 
The lack of adequate water supply and sanitation 
result 
in annual outbreaks of cholera and 
dysentery and overall poor environmental 
conditions. The economic burden of poor sanitation falls disproportionally on the poor. 17 There has 
been significant progress on many of the reforms laid down in the 1994 National Water Policy, such as 
the separation of water resources management from water supply and sanitation, the separation of 
regulatory and executive functions and the devolution of authorities from central to local governments.  
However, much more needs to be done to strengthen local capacity to deliver on these services.

42. With the new Government there is renewed commitment to decentralization and the 
Government is reviewing the decentralization policy to take into account latest developments on 
the ground. Devolution has been articulated as formal Government policy since 2005, and the 
Decentralization Implementation Plan (DIP) was adopted in 2009, and implementation is at different 
stages in the various sectors. The functional and fiscal devolution of responsibility is so far limited with 
local government expenditures constituting about 1.5 percent of total budgetary expenditure. Inter-
governmental transfers represent less than 1 percent of the national budget. Some progress has been 
made on the decentralization agenda over the past year: total allocation of inter-governmental transfers 
to local governments increased by 98 percent  between 2011 and 2012, however, intergovernmental 
transfers remain low; the draft Constitution provides a broad framework for decentralization; a 
consensus has been reached in the Government on implementing a phased approach, i.e., devolving a 
limited number of sectors; and the Government has progressed with the design and costing of the new 
organizational structures for the devolved functions. However, in order to implement a program of this 
magnitude, strong leadership and technical capacity will be needed. 

PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH AND DIVERSIFICATION 

43. 
The vast majority of the very poor derive their livelihoods from subsistence smallholder 
agriculture, whose productivity remains low. The SNDP recognizes agriculture as a principle sector 
for poverty reduction and for promoting economic diversification. Increased agricultural productivity 
will not only improve the income of women as the majority (68 percent) of those who are economically 
active work in that sector, but also increase the nutritional intake of children as women have 
consistently been found to be more likely than men to invest in their children’s health and well-being 
(World Bank 2008b) when they have the means to do so.  

44. 
Farmers face numerous constraints that keep productivity low.  Inadequate rural 
infrastructure, particularly feeder roads and irrigation systems, poor access to markets, inadequate 
research and access to improved inputs, limited advice on their proper use are examples of constraints 
faced. Women farmers tend to have even lower access than men to agricultural inputs.  Government 
expenditure on agriculture has risen consistently since 2000 but two main subsidy programs, Farmer 
Input Support Program (FISP) and the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), have absorbed more than 60 
percent of the sector's budget and have distorted incentives in favor of maize, and created 
unpredictability that has hindered private investment in agriculture. Political economy constraints have 
made reforms of these subsidy programs difficult, but they are critical for ensuring optimum 
development benefits accrue from public expenditure. Recently the Government has proposed scaling 
down and reforming FRA purchase activities and reforming the FISP and undertaking a reform of land 
tenure system. The challenge, however, will be in defining the size of the strategic food reserve and 
employing transparent and competitive processes for procuring the reserve stock and bringing closure 
to land tenure reform issues in a timely manner. The 2013 Budget also increased allocations to non-
maize investment components, signaling steps towards diversification. 

45. 
Since 2002 the Government has supported the development of farm blocks-one per 
province, whose development has been limited by resource constraints and infrastructure 
deficits. The Government proposes to provide the infrastructure (roads, electricity and irrigation) on a 
farm block to attract investors who develop a core venture and/or any of the commercial farms into 
centers of excellence for production, processing and management under an out-grower arrangement.  
So far development is in an advanced stage in only Nansanga farm block. The Government faces 
resource constraints for developing infrastructure and inadequate irrigation, the high cost of borrowing 
and high production costs have kept away potential investors. There is a need to conduct a careful 
analysis of the existing farm blocks to better understand the costs and benefits of use of public 
resources to create jobs and improve agricultural production through this program.  

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
46. 
The value chains for both crops and animal products are inefficient and weak. Weaknesses 
are there at every link-from shortage of inputs, inadequate research, limited access to technology, 
inadequate storage infrastructure and transport, agro-processing and marketing and distribution. 
Livestock and aquaculture sector development is also hampered by animal diseases, inadequate 
extension, poor animal husbandry and chronic shortages of quality fish seed and fingerlings. Recently, 
the Government announced measures to increase forward (by promoting local value addition to crop 
and livestock products) and backward (through local production of key agriculture inputs) linkages with 
agriculture. 

IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS  
47. 
Despite progress on investment climate reform, Zambia still lags behind neighbors on the 
World Bank’s Doing Business 2013 (Figure 2). Zambia's ranking on Doing Business 2013 dropped 
from 90 in 2012 to 94.Three issues stand out in the 2013 report: (i) Dealing with construction permits 
(rank 151), (ii) Getting electricity (rank 151); and (iii) Trading across borders (rank 156). The latter is a 
matter of concern since Zambia is landlocked and depends on smooth border crossings to promote all 
trade. The Government is taking steps, such as creating one-stop border posts, to improve trade 
facilitation. 

48. 
Zambia's businesses face serious constraints in improving competitiveness. Labor costs are 
high while productivity is low. Both hard and soft infrastructure is poor including energy, transport, 
telecom, water and also insurance, marketing and professional services—particularly outside the urban 
areas. 

Figure 2: Zambia and comparator economies on 
ease of doing business 

49. 
Transportation, both road and rail, 
is 
seriously limited outside the main provincial towns 
and major regional transit routes. Since 2003, the 
Government has been implementing a ten-year road 
development program, known as ROADSIP II, partially 
financed by the World Bank and other CPs.  In addition, 
Government recently announced a further paved road 
construction program, Link 8000, planned 
for 
implementation over the next 5-10 years in which it is 
investing a significant amount of its own resources. The 
sector has faced several governance challenges that the 
CPs have raised as a concern. Connecting remote rural 
areas also still remains a challenge. Performance-based 
road contracting could remove the road infrastructure 
gap and allow meaningful agricultural development to 
take place. The rail and road network asset condition 
also needs attention.18 The rail network condition and 
service has continued to deteriorate. The concession was cancelled in September 2012, with a 
commitment from Government to recapitalize the railway service.

50. 
Access to electricity is limited. The mining industry accounts for about 50 percent of national 
electricity consumption. The overall national electrification rate is about 23 percent, with 47 percent of 
the population in urban and peri-urban areas and only 3 percent in rural areas having access to 
electricity.  

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
51. 
The inadequate electricity supply is a binding constraint to growth. Zambia has a strategic 
position within the Zambezi River Basin that affords it significant potential to develop new hydropower 
generation, and improve existing energy production through cooperation. Inefficiencies in the sector 
have however, deterred new investments and the country has not made major investments in generation 
capacity since the development of the major hydro-power stations in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. 
The poor financial condition and weak operational performance of ZESCO, the state-owned power 
company, had been an obstacle to new investments needed to build power-generating capacity. 
Investment needs in generation alone are estimated at about US$6 billion in the next 10 years and 
transmission and distribution networks also need to be rehabilitated. 

52. 
The Government’s strategy addresses short-, medium-, and long-term issues in the energy 
sector. The strategy’s focus is on opening the transmission network to private electricity providers in 
addition to the state-owned ZESCO; improving the operational and financial performance of ZESCO, 
while gradually phasing out the need to subsidize new capital investments; and raising electricity tariffs 
to total cost recovery levels in order to attract private investors to the market.  

53. 
Access to information and communication technology (ICT) is limited in Zambia (Table 9) 
and costs are high, constraining private sector development. Zambia has yet to fully exploit the 
transformational opportunities provided by ICT.

54. 
Access to finance remains a 
serious constraint, as is availability of 
skilled workers. Limited access to 
financial 
services 
for both 
large 
corporations and small enterprises, but 
particularly for the latter, is a major 
factor in poor productivity in Zambia. 
The generally poor financial literacy 
level in the country also increases the 
vulnerability of the borrowers. A major 
input of concern is labor, the cost of which is high and the productivity of which is well below 
international standards. There is a significant gap between the vocational skills demanded by the private 
sector and those produced by the educational system. The cost of other inputs, such as equipment, 
spares, fuel and other consumables is also high as most items need to be imported.

Factors that hinder private sector development have also constrained tourism 
development. If the infrastructure and the business climate in Zambia were as in South Africa, 
Zambia's tourist flows would be 51 percent higher than existing levels (Mattoo and Payton 2007). In 
addition, policies that help improve the regulatory and marketing aspects of the tourism industry are 
also needed.  

56. 
Improving Zambia’s infrastructure requires reforms (for example in ZESCO) and also 
substantial capacity to implement. While Zambia’s debut US$750 million Euro bond is largely 
earmarked to fund infrastructure (Table 6) selecting projects that contribute to high growth, and 
capacity to spend effectively needs to be enhanced.   

57. 
The Government’s capacity for undertaking public-private partnerships (PPPs) also 
needs to be enhanced. The Government has supported PPPs to leverage the strengths of both the 
private and public sectors to deliver and maintain infrastructure investments in the country. Following 
the approval and adoption of the Public-Private Partnership Policy in 2008 and the enactment of the 
PPP Act by Parliament in August 2009, the Government has continued to firm up institutional 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arrangements to implement PPP financed infrastructure projects. In September 2012, the Government 
announced the merger of the Zambia Development Agency and the Public-Private Partnership Unit in 
the MOF to establish an Industrial Development Commission to enhance capacity for implementation 
of PPPs. An adequate institutional framework, however, to spearhead project identification, appraisal 
and implementation still remains a constraint.     

58. 
Concerns remain among civil society, media and the general public about the generally 
low level of participation by Zambians in the mining industry. Effective strategies for broad-based 
development anchored in mining will be needed to deal with these concerns.  Planned infrastructure, 
value-addition and small business development can help turn “enclave” mining projects into sustainable 
mining districts. Capacity gaps in the Government’s ability to monitor mining operations, ensure full 
tax compliance, and maintain a smooth-functioning cadaster 19 and license-award processes also need to 
be addressed. 

59. 
Zambia’s regulatory regime for mining has not kept pace with the structure and size of 
the industry.  The current regulatory structure and capacity was designed to oversee a single state-
owned copper and cobalt mining company.  But today Zambia has a private sector-led industry, 
comprising many large and small mining operations and ever-growing exploration activity, including 
by some of the largest global mining companies. New minerals are also being discovered. Continued 
clean-up on legacy environmental contamination in now-closed mining sites is also needed. The 
regulatory framework for mining-related environmental protection also needs to be solidified.   

60. 
Integration into a dynamic and more open Southern African region will contribute to 
further growth and poverty reduction in Zambia. With eight neighbors, Zambia is favorably 
positioned to take advantage of increased regional demand. World Bank analytical work has 
demonstrated the scope for increased exports of animal products to other countries in the region, 
provided that non-tariff barriers to imports are eliminated or at least reduced (World Bank 2011). The 
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the South African Development 
Community (SADC) 20, the two regional trade blocs of which Zambia is a member, have supported 
liberalization of market access for road freight and harmonization of rules to ensure interoperability in 
member states (MCA 2010). In this regard Zambia could exploit further the presence of COMESA 
headquarters in Lusaka to source financing for trade and commerce related developmental matters. 
Recently, Zambia has initiated dialogue with four other like-minded countries in Southern Africa to 
accelerate trade integration. This has the potential to expand regional trade to the mutual benefit of all 
participating countries. 

61. 
 As a member of the Southern African Power Pool, Zambia could be a supplier and 
transmitter of energy regionally by increasing its power generation capacity and transmission 
infrastructure including regional interconnectors. The growing demand for electricity at both 
domestic and regional levels, and the regional power shortages in the foreseeable future provide a solid 
market for any additional electricity supply that can be offered. Regional interconnectors such as the 
Zimbabwe-Zambia-Botswana-Namibia and the Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya interconnectors could help 
Zambia become a regional hub for power trade in southern and eastern Africa.  

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT  

62. 
Improving governance and strengthening economic management is critical to making 
good policy and effective and efficient use of public resources. Good governance and sound 
economic management also provide the enabling environment for private sector development and for 
improving service delivery. While Zambia has reached low MIC status, its economic management 
capacity remains weak, similar to that in several LICs. Policy coordination within the Government is 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also poor. Efficiency and effectiveness gaps in public spending as well as transparency and 
accountability challenges in public service delivery continue to pose a serious threat to continued 
growth, competitiveness and service-delivery. The statistical base to provide accurate information for 
policy making also remains feeble. The main constraints are less the availability of resources, but the 
knowledge, capacity and incentives to improve government performance. As the Government 
increasingly approaches international capital markets for meeting its needs for development finance, its 
systems for managing public finances, debt, and expenditure will come under greater scrutiny.  

63. 
Public sector management (PSM) reforms have been implemented by the Government in 
the last ten years. Progress has been made on civil service reforms (e.g. payroll policy), and service-
delivery measures such as service-delivery charters, and process re-engineering which have resulted in 
steady improvements in the six WGI indicators. 21 There is renewed momentum to accelerate reforms 
and the Government has over the last six months approached the Bank with a number of different 
requests for support such as: civil service reform, including pay policy, performance management 
system for senior government officials, public pension reform, design of a system for assets disclosure, 
and creating a public sector credit union; and strengthening decentralization. 

64. 
Since early 2000, PFM reforms with support from CPs through the Public Expenditure 
Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) program have also been undertaken. A 
number of diagnostic studies (CFAA of 2003, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) 
assessments of 2005, 2008 and 2012 (draft)) found that Zambia’s PFM system exhibits several 
weaknesses. A comparison of the draft 2012 and 2008 PEFA assessments reveals that scores for eight 
indicators have improved while the remaining ones show a stagnant or downward trend (see Annex 17).  
Some of the achievements to date are: the change in the Government budget cycle in 2009, which the 
2008 PEFA assessment identified as the biggest impediment to improved PFM in Zambia, improved 
infrastructure and logistics for internal and external audits, parliamentary committees and Zambia 
Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZICA); and a significant amount of training across all components 
including for the Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS).  The GRZ has 
committed to implementing the new PFM strategy (recently approved by Cabinet) and has made 
specific commitments to implementing public procurement reforms. Since January 2013, the Zambia 
Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA) has been transformed into an oversight and regulatory body and 
public procurement has been decentralized to ministries, provinces and spending agencies. 

65. 
GRZ has been attempting to also strengthen capacity in other areas that would improve 
economic management. These include a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system including 
strengthening statistical capacity, project appraisal and investment management, debt management, and 
the ability of the MOF to influence sector expenditure policies. The Ministry has also recently 
developed a strategic plan to address these areas over the next five years. The Government has 
approached CPs for support in building a government-wide M&E system and for supporting e-
government, including a review of existing ICT systems to get efficiency gains, expand inter-
operability, and strengthen fiduciary controls and transparency. The World Bank has also recently 
proposed an action plan for strengthening Government’s debt management.  

66. 
Developing a high level platform for civil society, the public and the CPs to engage with 
the Government on development issues is important for making progress on promoting 
transparency and accountability (see Annex 18). Zambia has an active civil society, which has been 
working towards greater representation of citizens’ voice in Government. It has promoted key 
initiatives recently, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the Access to 
Information Law and investigative journalism, supported by Bank financing. But despite this progress, 
civil society’s influence continues to be limited by a lack of institutionalized mechanisms, inadequate 
information and knowledge of policy processes, poor use of communication strategies and weak links 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
with other actors. It will also be important to strengthen and scale up non-state actor participation for 
improved budget oversight (e.g. procurement watch), transparency of budget allocation processes (e.g. 
Open Budget Initiative), service-delivery (e.g. score-cards) and to ensure that these are linked with 
corresponding government-led interventions wherever possible.  

67. 
The Government has also shown its preference for reducing corruption by increasing 
funding to good governance institutions, appointing individuals who have championed the anti-
corruption agenda, and continuing support for transparency and accountability initiatives. In 
fact, the EITI Board declared Zambia compliant with the EITI standard on September 19, 2012. 22 The 
administration has also declared the strengthening of public institutions and accountability as clear 
priorities and has undertaken some initial institutional, regulatory and legal measures to prevent and 
fight corruption. This includes the updating of the Anti-Corruption Act (which reinstates the 
criminalization of abuse of public office for corrupt purposes), preparation of an access to information 
law and work initiated to strengthen the asset disclosure system. 

E. Zambia’s Development Strategy 

68. 
The country’s long-term development objectives are articulated in the National Vision 
2030 that recognizes some important challenges to attaining MIC status. Among the objectives are: 
attaining high sustained annual growth rates, reduction of poverty to less than 20 percent of the 
population, and reduced inequality. Among the challenges noted are: achieving an adequate supply of 
competent, highly skilled human resources, a knowledge-based economy, maintaining efficiency, 
effectiveness, transparency and accountability in the use of public financial resources. The development 
strategy to achieve the Vision 2030 objectives has been elaborated in a series of national development 
plans. The Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP 2006-10) was the first in this series.  

69. 
The SNDP 2011–15 builds on the FNDP gains and was prepared through a highly 
consultative process before the PF Government came to power. There is a high degree of 
consistency between the SNDP and the PF Government’s Manifesto and the new Government has 
indicated that the SNDP and the Vision 2030 will remain the main development frameworks for 
Zambia. The SNDP identifies the following overarching objectives: 
• To accelerate infrastructure development, economic growth and diversification; 
• To promote rural investment and accelerate poverty reduction; and 
• To enhance human development. 
The Plan focuses on policies, strategies, and programs that contribute significantly to addressing the 
challenges of realizing broad based pro-poor growth, employment creation and human development as 
outlined in the Vision 2030. The SNDP identifies growth areas that could unlock Zambia’s natural 
resource endowments that should provide a basis for development. These are: agriculture, livestock, 
fisheries, mining, tourism, and manufacturing. The need to diversify the economy along these sectors is 
stressed.  

70. 
National development plans provide a broad development strategy, but more specific and 
priority policies and institutional actions are elaborated in other programs documents and 
speeches from time to time. These include Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP), the Private Sector 
Development Reform Program (PSDRP), the rolling Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), 
the annual budget, the MOF Strategic Plan 2012-16 and the Performance Assessment Framework 
(PAFs) agreed with Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) CPs. The President’s speech during the 
second session of the 11th National Assembly and the Finance Minister’s speech for the 2013 National 
Budget have also conveyed Government direction and priorities. The PF Government’s pre-election 
Party Manifesto also provides indications of policy preferences during its rule.  

16 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
71. 
The Government has put emphasis on job creation to reduce poverty but a road-map to 
achieve goals is still to be articulated. Job creation is emphasized as a strategy to reduce poverty and 
the recent MTEF Green Paper and the 2013 budget speech recognizes four sectors—agriculture, 
tourism, construction and manufacturing as having the greatest potential to support labor intensive 
growth. The goal is to create 1,000,000 formal jobs over the next five years. While the jobs lens holds a 
solution for poverty reduction its achievement may be difficult given the size and composition of the 
entire labor force of 5.5 million in the country. Private sector led investments are to be encouraged, in 
addition to PPPs and good governance is emphasized. The Government has also emphasized the 
importance of closing the development gap between rural and urban areas.  However, a road-map, and a 
specific set of actions that are regularly monitored with clear accountability for the delivery of 
outcomes is still to be concretized. Some sector specific national strategic plans such as the Rural 
Development Strategy are under preparation and are likely to provide specific direction. 

72. 
The government-wide results-oriented M&E system currently under development by the 
MOF and the Cabinet Office aims at strengthening the linkages between planning, budgeting and 
M&E and focuses on strengthening budget efficiency, policy and program effectiveness. It could also 
help strengthen budget transparency and overall accountability. However, quality of M&E needs to be 
gradually strengthened, including of data and the gradual establishment of M&E functions over time, 
accompanied by the necessary capacity-strengthening. 

73. 
The SNDP explicitly underlines the prioritization of women’s empowerment and gender 
mainstreaming in the development process. Specific areas of intervention include: agriculture, land, 
energy, water and sanitation, commerce, trade and industry, access to finance, education and training, 
maternal and child health, governance, and social protection. The review and harmonization of 
customary and statutory land ownership laws, procedures and administrative practices to develop 
gender responsive policies and legal framework is also emphasized. 

F. Development Partner Support 

74. 
The second Joint Assistance Strategy (JASZ II) for Zambia sets out the principles for 
CPs’ support to the SNDP (Annex 19 for CPs division of labor matrix). The overall goal is to 
support broad-based inclusive growth and poverty reduction as set out in the SNDP while reducing 
duplication of effort and help focus support in areas that align with each donor’s comparative 
advantage. The CPs supporting Zambia’s development agenda, including the WBG, have in the past 
worked with the Government to implement the Paris Declaration in the Mutual Accountability Group 
(MAG). Currently the MAG is adjusting to the Busan Framework that allows room for new CPs such 
as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to be part of the MAG. 

75. While aid to Zambia has been declining (para 26), other sources of finance have become 
important. United States, EU, UK, World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN 
system have been the top CPs contributing to Zambia’s total aid between 2006 and 2010. Other 
significant CPs included Norway, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Finland, Canada and Sweden.  In recent 
years Zambia has received considerable investments from the BRICS, and in particular China. The 
Zambian Government has also begun borrowing on regional and international markets—for example 
the US$750 million sovereign bond. 

76. 
The Bank’s role as a global knowledge partner is yet to be fully exploited by Zambia. 
Consultations with various stakeholders, including the Government reveal that the value of the WBG 
support to the country is still judged mainly on the amount of financing it brings. The institution’s role 
as a global knowledge partner and as an objective facilitator of development experience is yet to be 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fully recognized. Nearly half of the respondents to the client survey reported that they rarely or never 
used the Bank’s knowledge products in Zambia. During the CPS the WBG will give greater importance 
to undertaking analytical work and just-in-time notes in critical areas as well as reaching a broader set 
of stakeholders through improved dissemination so that the Bank’s work can provide the basis for 
generating solutions for development problems (see Annex 18 for details).  

77. 
Seven development partners—including the Bank—that provide budget support have 
formed the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) group. 23  The PRBS group has agreed on a 
common review process, the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), which is a multi-year matrix 
of policy reforms. Budget support has become important as a percentage of total aid. The share of ODA 
going to general budget support was 8 percent in 2006, while in 2010 it was 23 percent (equivalent to 
US$217 million or 7 percent of government revenue).  Similarly, the share of budget support in total 
IDA disbursements was substantial in some years (estimated at some 50 percent in 2010), exceeding 
the envisaged CAS range of 15-20 percent. There is interest in the Government to continue with budget 
support but the current PAF remains weak.    

II. LESSONS LEARNED FROM A REVIEW OF THE PAST WBG ASSISTANCE 

A. Implementation of the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 

78. 
The last WBG CAS (FY2008-11) was fully aligned with the Government’s FNDP. The 
CAS Completion Report (Annex 20) rates both the program under the CAS and Bank performance as 
moderately satisfactory. Of the 23 outcomes under the 2008 CAS, 10 were achieved, 8 were partially 
achieved, and 5 were not achieved. Achievements were in areas critical to the growth of the economy, 
such as macroeconomic stability, public financial management, public management and transparency of 
mining and natural resources, strengthening vocational training, and improving the business 
environment. While the outcome on improving agricultural productivity was not achieved, the basis 
was laid for significant contribution from the World Bank during the next strategy period in this area 
through the design and approval of critical interventions in irrigation (FY11), livestock sector 
development (FY12) and agriculture research (FY13). MIGA through its guarantees (para 86) and IFC 
through, among other things, the Emergent Farmers Program (para 88), also supported the development 
of the agriculture sector. The Bank also managed to maintain a constructive dialogue with the 
Government and CPs and having a well-staffed office in Lusaka helped. The Bank collaboration with 
other CPs helped leverage additional resources and strengthen prospects for reforms. 

79. 
The CAS program was, however, not selective. With four pillars, two cross cutting themes, 
the CAS focus was fairly broad and covered 11 sectors each with several objectives. The scope of the 
Bank program was ambitious for an envisaged three-year time frame and limited IDA envelope, and in 
relation to Zambia’s weak institutional capacity—even though some of the program activities were 
aimed at strengthening that capacity. The CAS design did not reflect the lessons of experience drawn 
from the previous CASCR that noted “future CASs need to be more realistic in their strategic 
objectives and should be based on a careful review of past experience and political economy issues” 
(2008 IEG CAS Review for the FY04-07 CAS). The CASPR recognized that the growth and 
macroeconomic stability had not translated into jobs and reduced poverty. It recommended that going 
forward the Bank’s program deliberately focus on poverty reduction. 

80. 
A World Bank supported client survey (Annex 15) in early 2012 rated the Bank’s overall 
effectiveness as 6 on a 10 point scale. Respondents in 2012 had significantly higher levels of 
agreement that the Bank plays a relevant role in Zambia’s development, that the programs and 
strategies the Bank supports are realistic, and that the Bank treats stakeholders in Zambia with respect 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to respondents in the 2004 and 2007 surveys. They indicated that the Bank’s greatest 
weakness in its work in Zambia was in being too influenced by developed countries. Also, being too 
bureaucratic in its operational policies and procedures; imposing technocratic solutions without regard 
to political realities; and not adequately collaborating with non-state actors to ensure better 
development results were also noted as weaknesses. These have been important considerations in 
preparing this CPS. 

81. 
In preparing the CPS the Bank undertook consultations (Annex 15) with government 
officials, civil society, private sector, CPs, women and youth groups. These emphasized the importance 
of the Bank’s support to the agriculture sector to directly improve the livelihood of rural Zambians. 
Support for energy and improving access to finance was also emphasized as a means to contribute to 
private sector development to create jobs. Policy inconsistency, weak regulatory environment, poor 
governance, weak capacity and poor statistics were recognized as challenges for development. The 
biggest concern for the youth representatives was lack of opportunities for formal and informal jobs.  

B. IDA, Trust Funds and Analytical and Advisory Services 

82. World Bank Executive Directors approved about US$438 million in IDA for 8 operations 
and additional financing for 4 projects for about US$75 million during the last CAS period. Three 
regional projects, one IDA and two GEF supported, were also approved during this period.  

83. 
The sector distribution of IDA resources moved towards agriculture. As the new projects 
got approved during the CAS period the focus shifted towards agriculture (Annex 20 CAS CR Figure 
1).  

84. 
The Bank provided a substantial program of analytical work and capacity building 
support during the last CAS. Thirty-seven AAA were completed during the CAS period, and 20 were 
active as of end December 2012. Some of the core diagnostic AAA delivered during the last CAS 
included a safety net review, a poverty assessment, an investment climate report and a report on jobs 
and prosperity. Analytical work was also done on the potential of the tourism industry, copper 
fabrication, beef and dairy industry and the Zambezi river basin. 

85. 
About US$124 million were provided in trust fund resources during the CAS period 
through 45 trust funds of which 4 were approved in the last few months (Annex 11 covers the 
active trust funds). Some of these resources were available through stand-alone trust funds (for example 
the Russian Education Aid Development (READ)) whereas in other cases the trust funds were 
associated with an IDA project. For example, the Malaria Booster project has trust funds of US $26 
million. In addition, Zambia also benefited from global and regional trust funds.  

C. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
86. MIGA for the first time issued guarantees for US$18.7 million for investments in 
manufacturing and agribusiness in Zambia during FY11. The guarantees to Hitachi Construction 
Machinery Africa Pty. Ltd. and Hitachi Construction Machinery Southern Africa Co., Ltd. of South 
Africa involved the construction and operation of a re-manufacturing plant 24 in Lusaka. The guarantee 
to Chayton Atlas Investments of Mauritius for its equity in Chobe Agrivision Company Limited in 
Zambia involved the acquisition of two adjacent commercial farms in the Mkushi farm block in the 
Central Province of Zambia. The investor plans to increase the amount of land under irrigation from 
210 to 580 hectares through increased capital expenditure.  

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D. International Finance Corporation 

87. 
IFC provided substantial investment lending support. IFC commitment over the last CAS 
period amounted to US$87.6 million for 9 projects to support growth through: (1) helping improve the 
investment climate; (2) infrastructure development (3) investment in power and telecommunications; 
(4) diversification of the economy by increasing the competitiveness of agricultural and services sector; 
and (5) increasing access to finance to underserved market segments, including MSMEs and low-
income individuals. A US$25 million loan facility was committed in June 2010 to support Zambia 
National Commercial Bank’s (ZANACO’s) increased financing for its agribusiness portfolio clients, 
SMEs, and other sectors including telecom, tourism and manufacturing. IFC also committed US$7 
million to Zambeef, a major agribusiness company in Zambia.  

88. 
IFC’s advisory services contributed to improving competitiveness and expanding access to 
finance. Under IFC’s advisory service on Emergent Farmer Finance a total of 171 farmers (of which 30 
percent were women) received financing exceeding the project target of 150 farmers. Since March 
2009, the Investment Climate Department (CIC) has assisted the Government with a program that 
focuses on two activities: licensing and Doing Business reform. In July 2009, the Government 
announced a wholesale streamlining of 517 business licenses. A total of 130 licenses have so far been 
streamlined, and legislation has been prepared by the Ministry of Justice to streamline a further 72. IFC 
also designed and developed a 3-year (2007-10) supply chain development program, the Copperbelt 
SME Supplier Development Program, jointly with leading mining Multinationals Companies focusing 
on assisting them with integrating local SME suppliers in the mining operations.  

E. Lessons Learned 

89. 
Key lessons of experience that are incorporated in this CPS are as follows: 
• The WBG needs to use all constituent institutions and instruments—partnerships, knowledge 
and lending—to the same level to strategically support the country’s development efforts. 
Different parts of the WBG have different counterparts in the country. Depending on the situation 
the need often is not financing but good analysis and information or simply putting stakeholders 
together. All instruments need to be strategically used to inform the national development process. 
• The Bank needs to enhance attention to the impact of political economy and governance in 
designing its program. Realism is needed in identifying the policy environment where projects 
and programs can be designed and implemented as well as working in alliance with reform minded 
factions to contribute to inclusive growth.      
• The CPS needs to be more selective in its strategic objectives and consistent with allocated 
time, resources and available Government and WBG capacity. There are lessons to be learnt 
from the experience of past projects. The CPS should also not underestimate key risks: in 
particular, complex project/program design, shortage of skills and capacity for implementation. 
Sufficient attention must be given to ensuring readiness for implementation and developing an 
adequate results framework and M&E system. 
• An explicit approach of "incremental progress" has proven effective in Zambia and should be 
adopted in areas where reforms are difficult to bring about.  This approach involved the Bank 
staying the course in a particular policy area and addressing the same or closely related issues in 
that policy area with successive analytical work or lending operations, but each time incrementally 
and patiently introducing additional measures until more complete progress is achieved over time 
as for example in the energy sector. The Bank assistance supported the country expand access to 
electricity, improve the efficiency of the electricity company, and introduce tariff reforms that 
enhanced the financial viability of the sector, resulting in recent foreign investment in power 
generation.

III. THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY IN ZAMBIA 

A. The CPS and the WBG Strategies 

90. 
To be equally responsive to Zambia's LIC related vulnerabilities and MIC transition 
opportunities, the CPS has two pillars (Figure 3), grounded in the World Bank's Africa Strategy 
and IFC and MIGA strategies.  The World Bank Africa Strategy pillars – vulnerability and resilience 
and competitiveness and employment—and foundation—governance and public sector capacity—have 
been adapted to Zambia's context. The CPS is also grounded in IFC’s Africa Strategy and the overall 
MIGA Strategy. The IFC Strategy for Africa focuses on promoting sustainable private sector 
development, through improving the investment climate, enhancing support to SMEs and developing 
projects more proactively in sectors such as infrastructure and agribusiness. The MIGA strategy gives 
priority to supporting investments in IDA countries that are frequently considered higher risk by the 
international investment community. 

Figure 3. Zambia CPS 2013-16: Framework for WBG Engagement 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
91. 
The CPS has three objectives (Figure 3), that contribute to the pillars and the foundation 
and respond to the country's development goals of reducing poverty and inequality, promoting 
diversification and sustained growth to become a prosperous MIC by 2030: (i) Reducing poverty and 
the vulnerability of the poor; (ii) Improving competitiveness and infrastructure for growth and 
employment; (iii)Improving governance and strengthening economic management; 

92. 
Seven outcomes are included under the three objectives. The indicators and milestones 
under each outcome are presented in the Results Framework included in Annex 1. 

B. The Guiding Principles for WBG Engagement in Zambia    
93. 
Seven guiding principles explain the choice of the areas of engagement under each 
objective. These are elaborated below: 

94. 
Principle 1: Reflecting client priorities. The areas of WBG engagement reflect client 
priorities. The Government appointed a technical committee of staff from MOF and line Ministries to 
work with the World Bank team drafting the CPS. The discussions with the committee have ensured 
that the CPS goes beyond merely aligning with the Government vision and program documents to 
reflect specific client priorities of support from the WBG. The engagement with the technical 
committee has also enhanced awareness and ownership of the CPS process at all levels of Government.  

95. 
Principle 2: Building-in flexibility. Chapter 4 provides details on the program of support 
during the CPS period and Annex 10 Tables 1 to 3 provide a summary on financing and AAA 
activities. Some degree of flexibility is being maintained to allow the WBG to respond quickly to 
significant changes in the country context. The CPS Progress Report will be the next opportunity to 
take note of major changes and realigning the priorities of WBG support, as required.  

96. 
Principle 3: Exercising Selectivity. The CPS focuses on a limited number of outcomes and a 
few areas of engagement. To address the development challenges noted in Chapter 1 the financing 
support will be provided as follows in the identified areas: 
• Reducing poverty, related vulnerabilities and accelerating human development. The WBG will 
support programs to protect vulnerable families, promote job opportunities among poor people. The 
dialogue on safety nets will be deepened and support will be provided for strengthening health 
systems for results. The Bank’s engagement in education will be through critical analytical work to 
enhance the effort of ten CPs who recently (September 2012) pledged US$211.25 million to 
support the sector. Trust fund resources will also continue to be used and the Bank will mobilize 
partnerships to foster learning and skills improvement in critical sectors (see for example para 147). 
The Bank will not support water supply where several CPs are active, including the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation, Germany and AfDB. However, discussions on whether continued support 
will be provided to support sanitation improvement are underway. 
• Promoting agricultural growth and diversification: The WBG will continue working with other 
CPs to build greater consensus within the country for reform of FRA and FISP and provide 
financing support in much needed areas such as irrigation, rural roads, research and extension, and 
livestock development to promote agricultural diversification. Such simultaneous support in several 
areas has not been provided in the past and will help unlock the potential of Zambia’s agriculture 
sector.  
Improving competitiveness: Continued support for enhancing the enabling environment and 
activities for improving supply and access to electricity, transport infrastructure, access to finance 
and better access to water for hydro-power generation and industry will be supported. Building 

• 

22 

 
 
 
 
   
 
• 

capacity to improve efficiency and effectiveness and for promoting greater regional integration will 
also be given importance.  
Improving governance and strengthening economic management: This is a cross-cutting issue 
which will be supported across the portfolio. In the prevailing policy environment, institutional 
reform and capacity building activities will be given particular attention. 

Principle 4: Improving Effectiveness to leverage IDA. Building on the lessons from the 
implementation of the last CAS, the Bank will continue to engage in sectors where an “incremental” 
approach has proven effective. Energy is a good example where over the years the Bank has supported 
policy reform to improve the governance and performance efficiency of ZESCO and the Government’s 
objective of increased access to electricity services for the population. Similarly, the Bank-supported 
process in formulating the Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy, has contributed to the on-
going reforms in water resources and facilitated increased awareness around the role of water in the 
national economic agenda. Both energy and water resource development have public good aspects to 
them with positive implications for Zambia’s development in the long-run. 

97. 
Principle 5: Incorporating cross-cutting elements. This would include regional integration, 
strengthening institutional capacity, addressing governance, gender25 and climate change challenges.   

Box 1: Knowledge Creation for Zambia through Impact Evaluation  

The World Bank is working closely with Zambian policy makers to evaluate government programs in agriculture 
and health.  One agriculture evaluation examining the impact of a government irrigation program is in the design 
stage.  Another evaluation, the impact of rural road improvement on access to agricultural product markets, was 
rolled out under the last CAS and will be completed under the CPS.  Under the last CAS, an evaluation tested how 
best to guarantee that health facilities had essential medicines; the Government is designing a nationwide scale-up 
based on those results.  An evaluation of a results-based financing pilot for maternal and child health is underway.  
These evaluations were developed in careful consultation with the GRZ, complemented by training workshops, to 
fill knowledge gaps and inform the scale-up of programs in the future.  The current CPS will continue this strategy, 
to support strategic impact evaluations designed and implemented in partnership between the World Bank and the 
GRZ to improve the quality of operations and other government activities. 

98. 
Principle 6: Transitioning the WBG from primarily a lending to a solutions institution  
would involve:  
• Giving as much importance to analytical and advisory activities as lending. Just-in-time analysis in 
critical areas can provide the analytical basis for generating solutions for vexing development 
problems. Strategic impact evaluations can provide hard evidence on which to design scale-up of 
programs (Box 1).  
• Promoting south-south learning partnerships. At the MIC Forum at the Tokyo Annual Meetings 
2012, countries stressed the importance of expert advice from experienced, former, successful 
policy makers who the Bank could bring to work with MICs on specific issues. A "smart mixture" 
of technical assistance, advisory services, and resources from the Bank was emphasized as being 
invaluable in promoting development. For Zambia’s mineral sector learning from the Chilean 
experience could be very relevant as it was for Mongolia. 26 The experience of Mauritius that used 
its tourism sector as a driver of growth and for creating jobs could also be relevant for Zambia.  
• Enhance WBG cooperation. IFC and World Bank will increase collaboration in agriculture, 
infrastructure, private sector development and health.  The joint support of the World Bank, IFC 

and MIGA, particularly on development of PPPs, is expected to show how the strength of 
different parts of the WBG can be leveraged to produce results on the ground.  
• Enhance cooperation between sectors within the World Bank to build synergies for better 
outcomes. For example, as an input to the CPS process the Health, Safety Net and Education teams 
have together produced a Human Development Note that gives a holistic view of the status of 
human development in the country and provides a good basis for undertaking new interventions.  

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
• Enhance partnerships and convening role. The Bank will build strategic partnerships through trust 
funds and co-financing arrangements in sectors such as health and energy and will also engage with 
existing CPs to better align and strengthen the PAF to meet the new Government’s reform 
priorities. It will also play a convening role in connecting diverse stakeholders together for example 
in identifying and dealing with constraints to increasing local content in mining (see para 148).   

99. 
Principle 7: Building on the lessons of experience from the past CAS. Specifically giving 
greater attention to implementation readiness, using more realistic approaches to risk management and 
providing effective implementation support to projects.   

C. WBG Financial Resources under the CPS 
100. 
 IDA resources during the CPS period are estimated at US$400 million –about US$100 
million a year. SDR 221 million (US$344 million equivalent) will also be available as undisbursed 
resources in ongoing projects as of January 1, 2013 (Annex 9).  It is assumed that IDA17 allocations 
will at least be equivalent to IDA16 levels. That said the amounts beyond FY13 are indicative only. 
Actual allocations will depend on: i) the country's own performance; ii) its performance relative to that 
of other IDA recipients; iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; iv) changes in the list of 
active IDA-eligible countries; v) terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and vi) the 
amount of compensatory resources received from the MDR initiative. IDA allocations are made in 
SDRs and the US dollar equivalent is dependent on the prevailing exchange rate.  

101. Regional projects leverage additional IDA resources. 27 Examples include the Regional 
Agricultural Productivity Project and the Kafue-Town-Muzuma-Victoria Falls Regional Transmission 
Line Reinforcement Project that bring in US$20 and US$30 million of regional IDA respectively.  

102. The Global Partnership on Output- Based Aid,28 and the Climate Investment Fund will 
bring added resources. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) includes about US$33 
million administered through the World Bank and US$15 million through IFC. With the finalization 
and signing (expected later this year) of the CAADP 29 investment plan, Zambia will be eligible for 
global funding from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). 30  

103. Trust funds will be used strategically to complement IDA. About US$13.7 million is 
available in undisbursed resources from existing trust funds. Additional resources are also expected 
from CPs for supporting progress on MDG 4 and 5. Regional trust funds will also be available.  

104. The Bank will continue to attract complementary financing from other CPs where 
possible. The Bank is already working with the European Union and the European Investment Bank 
(EIB) in the energy sector. The Bank is also working closely with the AfDB, United Nations, Nordic 
Development Fund, KfW, and other partners on the climate change intervention. Netherlands is 
providing trust fund resources for supporting activities that promote gender equality in the agriculture 
sector and for improving competitiveness, financial literacy and consumer protection. 

105. 
IFC brings additional investment resources and MIGA will play a facilitating role to 
attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). IFC is set to grow substantially over the next few years in 
support of agribusiness, mining and private sector development activities. MIGA will foster 
development in Zambia by providing political risk insurance to investors and lenders. 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
106. The Government has expressed interest in accessing IBRD resources. In response, the Bank 
undertook a preliminary desk review of Zambia's creditworthiness. A more detailed mission will 
follow. In the meantime, options for enclave IBRD investments will be explored.  

D. CPS Instruments   

107. The CPS will draw on partnerships, knowledge and financing instruments to transition the 
WBG from a lending institution to one that can bring all kinds of knowledge-based solutions to support 
the country’s development goals. All three parts of the WBG will partner to build synergy and focus for 
results.  

IV. PROPOSED CPS OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED RESULTS 

A. Objective One: Reducing Poverty and the Vulnerability of the Poor 

108. Two specific outcomes will be supported under this objective.  

CPS OUTCOME 1.1: IMPROVED ANIMAL AND CROP PRODUCTIVITY IN SELECTED 
AREAS 

109. Analytical Underpinnings. The poor in Zambia are 
overwhelmingly engaged in agriculture. Productivity is low 

because of inadequate access to technology, weak research 
and extension systems, limited irrigation and lack of access 
to markets particularly for small-scale farmers, poor rural 
roads and limited or expensive finance. The WDR 2008 on 
Agriculture for Development reported that GDP growth 
originating in agriculture is about four times more effective in 
raising the incomes of such poor than GDP growth originating 
outside the sector. Both Bank and non-Bank analytical work 
demonstrates both the potential as well as the constraints to 
improving agricultural productivity in Zambia.  

110. Expected Results of IDA-financed operations. An 
irrigation project expects to increase yields per hectare and 
value of products marketed by smallholders; a livestock 
project aims to improve the productivity of key livestock 
production systems for targeted female and male smallholder 
producers; another agriculture project has been supporting 
increased commercialization of smallholder agriculture. 
Projects that support infrastructure development, such as 
electricity, roads and water resources discussed under 
objective 2, will provide market linkages, access to electricity 
and better management of water resources and contribute to 
agriculture development.  

111. Expected Results of regional operations. A regional 
project involving Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia will 
strengthen regional approaches to agricultural technology 
generation and dissemination by establishing regional centers

of research leadership. The project will support legume research in Zambia and maize and rice research 
in the other two countries.   

112. World Bank AAA and IFC advisory activities. World Bank AAA provided the analytical 
basis for the reform of FRA and FISP. Next step-notes on these and other key issues (FISP, FRA, rural 
roads, land and farm blocks) will be undertaken. The Bank and IFC are together undertaking a review 
of the cashew value chain, a crop important for one of the poorest regions—Western Province. A study 
on farm blocks will explore the concept, its progress and its feasibility as an approach. A policy note is 
looking at the potential of the agriculture sector for creating jobs. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study 
(DTIS) will, among other things, focus on unlocking the potential of trade in agricultural products.  

113. Trust funds. A regional Gender Equality trust fund will support the development of best 
practices for women's empowerment and entrepreneurship. The focus is on one of the key issues 
identified in the 2012 WDR on Gender -gaps in male and female productivity in agriculture. A global 
trust fund on Knowledge and Learning targets female farmers and is linked to their access to land. 

114. Another trust fund on Linking Women and the Private Sector will finance activities for 
identifying good practices for the improvement of labor standards in agribusiness and for increasing the 
participation of women in the private sector. A trust fund is helping build statistical capacity in the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.  

115. The specific project development objective of the CAADP - Child Trust Fund (CTF) is to 
improve strategic planning and implementation of agricultural investments at the national and 
regional levels. This will be accomplished by supporting COMESA's capacity to support the CAADP 
Roundtable process at both the country and regional levels. 

116. 
IFC. IFC recently disbursed a 10 year US$30 million loan to Zambeef for expanding 
processing capacity, adding new retail outlets and improving efficiency and will provide opportunities 
for development of out-grower farmers. IFC could also support agriculture related infrastructure 
development in farm blocks through PPPs and construction of storage infrastructure such as silos. IFC 
will provide support for scaling-up access to finance for growing emergent farmers through its 
partnership with ZANACO—the expected beneficiaries mostly being MSMEs engaged in agribusiness. 

117. MIGA. MIGA will continue to seek opportunities to support agribusiness development. 
Currently, two projects are under consideration: An investment by Liongate Venture Fund of the 
Cayman Islands in Yalelo Limited in Zambia that involves the establishment of an aquaculture facility 
on the Zambian side of Lake Kariba. Yalelo will contribute to food security by providing a local source 
of tilapia on a commercial scale. The project is also expected to generate 100 local jobs. Secondly, an 
expansion project by Chayton Atlas Investments of Mauritius in Chobe Agrivision Company Ltd. in 
Zambia will cultivate maize, wheat, and soya for consumption in Zambia and eventually neighboring 
countries. Introduction of highly efficient agricultural practices such as crop rotation and zero tillage, 
soil and water management, and certain technological improvements is expected to result in increased 
productivity and sustainable crop yield enhancement. The project will also contribute to increased food 
security within Zambia and the broader Southern African Development Community – the target market 
for consumption. 

118. Partnership and leverage. The World Bank will facilitate south-south learning between 
Zambia and countries such as Brazil and India on increasing agricultural productivity, particularly 
under rain-fed conditions. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
119. The regional project (para 111) will support the development of collaborative 
partnerships between weak and strong systems in the region. In line with its support under the 
CAADP, SADC is currently in the process of defining a new regional agenda for research and 
development (R&D) and is supporting the establishment of an autonomous sub-regional research 
organization to implement this agenda. The newly established Center for Coordination of Agricultural 
Research for Southern Africa (CARDESA) is expected to significantly increase the capacity available 
to support regional R&D activities, and the proposed regional program is seen as an important activity 
in the initial implementation of its operational plan.  

120. The Bank will also continue to collaborate with the Indaba Agriculture Policy Research 
Institute in Lusaka to share knowledge and explore opportunities for joint work. The Bank is actively 
working with other CPs such as the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program 
(WFP), to continue to bring pressure to bear on FRA and FISP reform. World Bank and IFC will 
continue to cooperate in supporting activities that promote agribusiness development.  

CPS OUTCOME 1.2: IMPROVED ACCESS TO RESOURCES FOR STRENGTHENING 
HOUSEHOLD RESILIENCE AND HEALTH IN TARGETED AREAS 

121. Analytical Underpinnings. The poor are 
vulnerable to climatic and other shocks. Decreasing 
vulnerability for 
the poor requires access 
to 
resources for improving resilience such as irrigation, 
policies that help build their human capital, and 
contribute to improved health and nutrition among 
them. Jobs in maintenance and construction of 
infrastructure, afforestation and land conservation 
activities provide returns and build community 
assets that increase the productivity of the poor.  

122. Expected Results 
of 
IDA-financed 
operations. Several projects involve construction 
and maintenance of infrastructure—for example, 
roads and bridges, irrigation and water supply will 
create jobs for the poor and increase their incomes. 
Development of irrigation will also help decrease 
vulnerability to droughts for farmers in the areas 
where such infrastructure is constructed.  A water 
resource development project will contribute to 
increased water security and decreased vulnerability 
to droughts by increasing the reliability of water for 
productive purposes and 
thereby strengthening 
community resilience to climatic variability.

Malaria Booster Project, IDA continues to support innovative ways of improving the supply chain 
system of essential medicines by introducing ICT for health initiatives in the public sector. A follow-on 
intervention in the health sector focused on health system strengthening to accelerate improvement in 
maternal and child health outcomes, building on some of the lessons of the Malaria Booster is in the 
pipeline.  

124. The Bank will also deepen the dialogue on social protection and nutrition to provide input 
for developing a sustainable safety net program in the coming years. Discussions are also under 
way to explore the possibility of a public work program that could generate income for the poor while 
also contributing to afforestation, land and soil conservation. In addition, opportunities for collaboration 
across sectors within the Bank will be explored, such as linking increased food production in the 
irrigated sites supported under the irrigation project with intensified nutrition education to address 
malnutrition. 

125. Trust Funds. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) Phase II will intervene in 
some of the poorest districts of Western and Southern Provinces, working at the community and 
district level through improved climate information, access to credit and weather-index insurance 
(supported by IFC), better planning for floods and droughts, and diversification of sources of income to 
address the root causes of vulnerability. The project would help generate an estimated 3,250 person-
days of labor-intensive works in the region and directly benefit the rural population estimated to live in 
wards adjacent to the canals (about 41,700 people). The interventions would specifically target women-
headed households, as well as households classified as very or extremely vulnerable. The PPCR will 
also promote climate risk financing, including preparing the Government to eventually receive 
financing from the Green Climate Fund and supporting the establishment of a  new inter-sectoral 
institutional framework to improve coordination amongst the growing number of climate change 
mitigation and adaptation projects in Zambia.   

126. A series of projects on the Zambezi River basin are expected to strengthen cooperative 
management and development within the river basin to facilitate sustainable climate resilient growth.  

127. The Government has also requested support for building capacity for scaling up of the 
Cash Transfers Schemes for the most vulnerable and linking them with other interventions.  The Bank 
is exploring accessing trust fund resources to address this request. 

128. There are two Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects—one regional and one 
national—being implemented by the World Bank in Zambia. The national project is expected to 
contribute to sustainable conservation and management of both Lavushi Manda and Kasanka National 
parks. The supported activities will contribute to tourism development and the welfare of poor 
communities in game management areas. The regional project, being jointly implemented with Malawi, 
is expected to also contribute to sustainable management of biodiversity in the conservation area. It will 
also strengthen the ability of community members living in the Chama district to enter the economic 
mainstream by leveraging tourism opportunities and improve farming practices through conservation 
farming. 

129. A project under the Bio-Carbon Fund will increase small-holder crop yields from sustainable 
climate-smart agriculture, increase farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and 
degradation and increase net forest cover in the Luangwa Valley. 

130. The Malaria Booster Project has leveraged a significant amount of trust funds resources. 
The Russian TF has supported procurement and delivery of bed nets, rapid diagnostic tests, and indoor 
residual spraying.  The Health Results Innovation Trust Fund has provided resources for piloting 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
innovative mechanisms for improving maternal and child health outcomes and is being implemented in 
ten intervention districts. It aims to address systemic issues for improved service delivery such as 
human resource constraints.  The country grant is accompanied by a US$ 2.0 million Bank-executed 
grant for an impact evaluation to measure the impact of the program to help the Government answer 
some key questions before scale-up to national level. 

131. The Capacity Building for Public Expenditure Tracking trust fund is expected to 
strengthen the capacity of the Government and partners for tracking expenditure, particularly 
HIV/AIDs related public expenditure, and assist in developing a mechanism for tracking expenditure 
within the MOF, CSOs and the University of Zambia's Health Economics Department.  

132. 
IFC. Through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, IFC will be promoting climate-
resilient investments and access to credit for vulnerable communities living in the Barotse and 
Kafue sub-basins of the Zambezi. IFC recently committed four teams of consultants to focus on 
identifying viable business opportunities to (i) build climate resilience in agri-business, water supply, 
energy production and natural capital; (ii) develop a mobile phone platform to facilitate the 
dissemination of market and climate information to farmers though private sector investment; (iii) 
provide weather index-based insurance products to farmers; and (iv) promote microfinance to build 
climate resilience.  

133. Partnerships. The World Bank will be working closely with IFC and the AfDB in 
strengthening community resilience to shocks and improving their asset and resource base in critical 
sub-basins of the Zambezi. The Climate resilience project is expected to leverage an estimated US$105 
million in parallel financing from other partners (AfDB, IFC, Nordic Development Fund, UN, GEF, 
World Fish, Red Cross, Concern etc.)   

134. Currently the Government and the WBG are exploring the possibility of a PPP for the 
delivery of health services. There is opportunity for Zambia to learn from the experience of the 
Government of Lesotho in this regard that has recently negotiated and launched a unique PPP with a 
private sector consortium to establish and operate a national referral hospital and mini health care 
network. 

135. The World Bank and USAID are also collaborating to improve results in the health sector 
by identifying and removing bottlenecks to increased collaboration at the country level. The 
initiative, supported at the highest levels in the two organizations, is expected to lead to improved 
communication between the two CPs, including on sharing data and complementary support in areas 
such as health care financing and supply chain management. The World Bank (World Bank Institute 
(WBI) in partnership with the country team) is also working with the European Commission in 
developing and delivering innovative tools for capacity development and participative governance, with 
an emphasis on the health sector. 

136. DFID is starting sector budget support in education in 2013 and the Ministry has agreed 
to carry out a public expenditure review in Education in 2014 in which the Bank will be engaged 
through the provision of sector expertise in its preparation.  

137. AAA. The dialogue on safety nets will be deepened building on the recent review of safety 
net programs by the Bank (see para 36) before a decision is made on whether to support an IDA 
project in this area in the outer years. The analytical work on safety nets is expected to inform the 
Government’s new Social Protection Policy expected to be finalized soon. The World Bank will also be 
supporting a study of rural-urban linkages to understand why growth has had limited impact on rural 
areas so far and to explore the options for improving service delivery to sparsely populated rural areas. 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank will engage in policy dialogue and technical assistance on options for reform of the public 
service pension system and for strengthening old age income protection.  

138. The Bank will engage in analytical work and policy dialogue with the GRZ to analyze and 
diagnose areas in which the education system needs further improvement.  In particular, to identify 
causes of low learning outcomes among students, and ways in which the country can foster skills 
required by growing industries. Tools like Service Development Indicators and impact evaluation could 
be used for this analysis. 

139. The Bank has also been part of considerable analytical work done on the economic impact 
of tourism and management of wildlife policies on poor communities and can inform policies and 
implementation as the Government moves ahead on the diversification agenda. These reports will be 
shared with stakeholders in relevant fora. As needed, additional analytical work will be supported. 

140. 
In the health sector the Government has indicated interest in Bank’s assistance to develop 
a comprehensive Health Financing Strategy to improve health sector performance.  A series of 
analytical work are planned and will be used by the Ministry of Health and other partners to develop a 
detailed implementation plan. The Government and other CPs are keen for Bank assistance to explore 
the efficiency and effectiveness gains as a result of integrating HIV services within the broader health 
system services and the best way to increase the demand for safe medical male circumcision services.  
Technical assistance will also be provided to build the capacity of the National Food and Nutrition 
Commission (NFNC), a statutory government body, which is responsible for coordinating policy and 
strategic planning on nutrition and the Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child to 
develop an M&E framework for the National Food and Nutrition Strategic Plan and costing of the 
1000-day action program.   

B. Objective Two: Improving Competitiveness and Infrastructure for Growth and Employment 
141. The recent WDR on Jobs recognizes the key role of the private sector in job creation in the 
developing world while noting the vital role that governments play in ensuring that the conditions are 
in place for alleviating the constraints to private sector development. Three related outcomes are 
supported under this objective—improving the business environment, improvements in transport, 
energy, water and telecommunication infrastructure and access to finance for SMEs. 

CPS OUTCOME 2.1: IMPROVING KEY ASPECTS OF THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
FOR BUSINESS 

142. Analytical Underpinnings.  The Doing Business Survey continues to be the main guide in the 
Bank's investment climate work in countries. In Zambia joint Bank/DFID analytical work –Jobs and 
Prosperity, Copper Mining, Beef and Dairy and Tourism—has also been instrumental in dialoguing on 
investment climate issues as has the recent Light Manufacturing in Africa Report (2012) and its Zambia 
case study. 

143. The Bank prepared the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes-Accounting & 
Auditing (ROSC-A&A) in 2009 which recommended many measures to enhance compliance with 
corporate accounting and auditing standards, improve accounting education and for setting up an 
independent oversight mechanism for monitoring and enforcing compliance with prescribed standards.  
There has not been much appetite for the setting up of an independent oversight mechanism and the 
reforms dialogue in this area has not progressed as expected. During the CPS implementation efforts 
will be made to move on the reform dialogue in this area. 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
144. Expected results of IDA-financed interventions. 
The support for 
institutional reforms and capacity 
development under the CPS (para 175) will contribute 
towards improving the enabling environment for private 
sector development.  

145. 
IFC. A new 
Investment Climate Program 
approved in January 2012 is helping improve Zambia's 
regulatory environment and overall competitiveness and 
focuses on business regulation reform, trade logistics, e-
Government, and industry-specific investment climate 
reform.  

Outcome 2.1 Summary table of interventions 

On-going Financing  
IFC: Investment Climate Program phase II 
Trust Funds: IFC’s Zambia Investment 
Climate Program;  
Proposed Financing 
IDA: Likely budget support credit for 
improving the enabling environment for private 
sector development. 

On-going AAA  
Updating the regulation and supervision 
framework for micro insurance;  
Bi-annual economic brief series  

Proposed AAA 
Analytical work on Job Skills 

146. Trust Fund. A trust fund will provide technical 
assistance support for updating 
the regulatory and 
supervisory framework for micro-insurance. This work 
builds on research done in Zambia by the International 
Labor Organization (ILO) and is required to adapt the 
existing regulatory and supervisory framework to support 
the expansion of the micro-insurance market. Another trust 
fund is funding an expert to work with the Bank of Zambia 
to review their current use of risk-based supervision and 
make recommendations for this approach focusing on identifying, assessing and responding to risk 
accumulation.  

Partnership and Leverage  
AUSAID and WBG, and possibly the EU in 
mining sector; World Bank and IFC are 
facilitating ZMLCI, a collaborative public-
private initiative; WB also working with ACET 
in Ghana; IFC and the World Bank on PPPs; 
IFC and WB  on investment climate reform 

147. Partnerships and Leverage. AUSAID and WBG, and possibly the EU, will collaborate to 
provide capacity building and skill-building support in priority technical areas, such as mining cadaster 
improvements, geo-data mapping and physical audits monitoring, and integrated planning for mining 
and infrastructure. AUSAID will take the lead in providing study tours and scholarships for 
Government officials to countries where capacity in these areas is advanced.  

148. World Bank and IFC are facilitating the Zambian Mining Local Content Initiative 
(ZMLCI), a collaborative public-private initiative (launched in July 2012) comprising representatives 
of the large-scale mining industry, the Zambian manufacturing and SME sectors and key Government 
agencies. It is expected that through sustained collaboration, local manufacturers can become an 
integral part of mining supply chains, ultimately leading to greater industrialization in the country. 
AUSAID has also expressed interest in supporting the initiative. The World Bank is also working with 
the Africa Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), a Ghana-based think-tank that is conducting a 
multi-country comparative assessment of the mining regulatory and legal frameworks covering Zambia, 
Botswana, Namibia and South Africa in the SADC region. Discussions are in progress on two regional 
projects, one that would help alleviate the institutional, legal, policy and road infrastructure along the 
North-South Corridor and the other, to accelerate the process of economic integration between Malawi, 
Mauritius, Zambia, Mozambique and Seychelles. 

149. 
IFC has joined a new initiative with Bank of Zambia for monthly meetings with the 
World Bank and IMF to discuss economic and financial sector issues that are of importance to 
private sector development. In this regard, the World Bank and the IFC will also assist Zambia with 
financial and technical assistance and discuss practical steps that the Government can undertake to 
regain the reform momentum going forward (see para 47 on drop in Zambia's ranking on 2013 Doing 
Business). IFC and the World Bank are also coordinating their support to the Government for PPPs in 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
key areas such as capacity building (institutional capacity for identification, appraisal and 
implementation of PPPs) through implementation of actual PPP transactions.  

150. The Bank will complement IFC's Investment Climate Program through supporting the 
promotion of Business Development Services (BDS), business linkages and the public-private 
dialogue. Continued structural transformation toward labor intensive industries is crucial for job 
creation and sustainable development. The recent study on Light Manufacturing in Zambia (World 
Bank 2012c) provides analytical insights and recommendations for developing the country's light 
manufacturing and labor-intensive industries.  According to this work, inputs, both the availability and 
quality, are the main binding constraint to Zambia's competitiveness in light manufacturing. The Bank 
will facilitate, together with other CPs, a process of dialogue between all stakeholders to address these 
binding constraints. 

151. The ILO in collaboration with the Zambia Federation of Employers (ZFE) has launched an 
assessment of the Enabling Environment for Sustainable Enterprises (EESE) in Zambia to which the 
World Bank is contributing. 

152. AAA. The World Bank is contributing to a Chamber of Mines and International Council on 
Mining and Metals collaborative study on nation-wide benefits to the economy from the mining sector. 
If needed an assessment of the legal framework for investment climate reform could be carried out.  
With Zambia’s improving economic status there is an increasing demand for good and timely economic 
information from the domestic private sector as well as potential investors in US, UK and South Africa 
looking at frontier markets in Africa. Policy debate in the country also remains weakly grounded in 
good information and evidence. Respondents to the client survey also highlighted the importance of 
adequate data and statistics on the country’s economy. The Bank will meet this development need 
through frequent assessments and will launch a new bi-annual economic brief series to provide good 
and credible economic information on the country and build a Bank “brand.” These economic briefs 
will be a flagship production of the Zambia country team. 

153. The Bank will undertake analytical work and a review of its experience across Africa to 
draw lessons on what can be done to build skills for jobs. The Bank in coordination with the GRZ 
will diagnose ways in which the country can foster skills required by growing industries like 
manufacturing and extractive Industries.  

CPS OUTCOME 2.2: SELECTED INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT AND REHABILITATED  

154. Analytical Underpinnings. Critical infrastructure investment gaps constrain the competiveness 
of the Zambian private sector. A World Bank Policy Paper (World Bank 2011a) found that Zambia 
would need to spend an average of $1.6 billion a year over the decade 2006–15 to develop the 
infrastructure found in the rest of the developing world. This is equivalent to 20 percent of Zambia’s 
GDP and about double the country’s rate of investment in recent years.  

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
155. Expected Results 
from 
IDA-financed 
operations. Two road projects support the construction 
of new bridges and the rehabilitation of selected sections 
of paved roads and will help improve connectivity and 
build institutional capacity for sustainable management 
of 
transport 
infrastructure. An electricity project 
supports increased access and improved efficiency and 
quality of distribution. Another pipeline electricity 
project will provide support for rehabilitation of the run-
down transmission and distribution network in Lusaka, 
improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of 
ZESCO and the overall energy system in Lusaka. A 
water project will 
support 
the Government 
in 
implementation of the new legislative framework for the 
development of the country's abundant water resources 
and advance on a pipeline of infrastructure projects.  
Another project is providing support for improving 
access and sustainability of water supply and sanitation 
services for consumers in Lusaka and discussions are on-
going on whether the Bank should be supporting another 
intervention in this area.

156. Expected Results from Regional Projects. A 
regional project 
is facilitating development of an 
efficient power market in the region.  Another regional 
project will help improve electricity availability and 
reliability of supply by supporting the reinforcement of 
the existing transmission network, increasing ZESCO's 
power transfer capacity to the southern part of the country, and reducing the high level of technical 
losses in the network. The World Bank is also helping to push the agenda on regional transport (for 
example, through the Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program) and regional water resource 
management (for example, the Zambezi River Basin Development Program). The Bank recently 
(October 2012) organized a multi-country and multi-sectoral regional conference in Lusaka on road 
safety in African cities that is expected to move the multi-sectoral road safety agenda forward.  

157. Trust Funds. Use will be made of Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) 
resources to provide PPP support. A European Community grant is supporting grid intensification for 
ZESCO and grid extension for the Rural Electrification Authority. 

158. A project under the Cooperation in International Waters (CIWA) trust fund will help in 
supporting regional efforts to enhance development gains through cooperation around the Zambezi 
River basin. This includes building on efforts to alleviate historical geopolitical constraints to 
cooperation and advance development of the Batoka Gorge Hydro-Electric Scheme.   

159. An ESMAP trust fund will provide technical assistance to support a comprehensive 
mapping exercise for wind, solar, and mini-hydro resources in Zambia. Resources from GPOBA 
(endnote 28) will also be available for solar energy programs in schools and health centers as well as 
connection fee subsidies to reduce the cost of grid connection for low income families.     

160. 
IFC: Support for PPPs will help improve infrastructure as discussed in paragraph 149. IFC is 
also looking to invest in a company that is strengthening telecommunications—through fiber 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infrastructure to connect the company’s backbone network to densely-populated towns and corporate 
clusters in the Zambian copper mining belt aimed at providing better internet service and connectivity. 

161. MIGA: MIGA's value added under this outcome will be (i) termination guarantee credit 
enhancement, regulatory risk and other investment guarantees; (ii) ability to guarantee public sector 
projects through non-honoring products;(iii) knowledge and experience of infrastructure/ power sectors 
in other countries with similar types of reform; (iv) client relationship with major players, including 
sponsors and lenders; (v) dispute resolution expertise (as between public and private sector 
stakeholders). MIGA will work closely with IFC on the investment side as well as with the Bank to 
seek opportunities for transfer and exchange of knowledge. In addition, MIGA will explore 
opportunities for relevance in critical sectors such as energy and mining. 

162. Partnerships and Leverage. There is already an existing partnership with EIB in the energy 
sector. The Bank will work closely with IFC and CPs such as DFID to support the Government with 
PPPs for infrastructure. A partnership is also expected to be developed between the World Bank and 
IFC in the water and sanitation sector. The World Bank is taking the lead in the review and updating of 
the 2003 National Transport Policy. Similarly, the AfDB is funding the development of a National 
Transport Master Plan for Zambia. In these policy discussions, the World Bank is actively providing 
input in the overall position of the CPs.  

163. The World Bank is also facilitating a series of meetings between the Energy Ministers of 
Zambia and Zimbabwe and the Zambezi River Authority on the financing and rehabilitation options for 
the Kariba dam and the financing options for the Batoka Gorge. 

164. AAA: Technical assistance on water and sanitation will support the Ministry of Local 
Government and Housing (MLGH) to develop a mechanism for introducing condominial sewer 
systems in peri-urban settlements. A review and updating of the 2003 National Transport Policy to 
include the impact of climate change, gender policies, intermodal transport services and provision of 
disaster risk management is also underway. 

165. An initial piece of analytic work will be carried out to assess the feasibility of a regional 
growth pole development model.  The growth pole concept explores the linkages and synergies 
possible from a coordinated cross-sector approach. It encourages the development of mutually 
beneficial infrastructure (mainly power and transport) and explores how private capital can be attracted 
to finance this infrastructure.   

CPS OUTCOME 2.3:  IMPROVED ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMALL ENTERPRISES 

166. Analytical Underpinning. The availability and cost of finance in Zambia is one of the most 
significant constraints to the operations and growth of SMEs. The 2010 Zambia Business Survey 
highlighted that only 10 percent of Zambian MSMEs were banked and that less than 2 percent had a 
business loan. An SME Forum organized by the World Bank and the Bank of Zambia in June 2012 
drew on the experience of China and Turkey (models used in these two countries) and identified several 
areas that would facilitate access to finance for SMEs. 31 As a follow-up to the forum, the Government 
requested Bank assistance for designing and funding a line of credit for SMEs.  

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
167. 
IDA-financed operations. An access to finance 
project will provide a line of credit to broaden and deepen 
access to medium- and long-term finance for SMEs in 
Zambia. The Bank will also attempt to support SMEs in 
their development, for instance through BDS, to ensure 
that the proposed supply side intervention is equally 
supported from the demand side. The project will draw on 
the experience of successful credit lines around the world 
to increase access to finance for SMEs in Zambia.  

168. The World Bank will also support the financial 
sector reform dialogue during the CPS. The policy, 
legal and regulatory reform agenda in the Zambian 
financial sector 
is supported by 
the Government’s 
Financial Sector Development Plan Phase II (FSDP II). 32 
About 20 bills, laws, and regulations are currently being 
revised, but progress has been relatively slow. Three of the 
most important reforms to facilitate access to finance for 
SMEs are the Credit Reporting Act, the Leasing Law, and 
the Branchless/Agent Banking Regulations.

169. 
IFC.  IFC will also focus on the SME sector and increase local currency programs to support 
economic development (Swaps, Liquidity Enhanced Asset Program (LEAP), Bond issue). IFC is also 
looking to assist Bank of Zambia with support for access to finance for MSMEs. The Bank of Zambia 
has indicated interest in IFC support for both credit bureaus and collateral registry.  

170. AAA. An Enterprise Survey will inform a demand side analysis for SME finance. A Financial 
Sector Assessment Program update is also planned. On the request of the Bank of Zambia, a diagnostic 
review of CPFL was conducted, the findings of which will inform the IDA project (paragraph 167). 

171. Trust Funds. A trust fund on Growth and Equity is supporting improvement of financial 
literacy and consumer protection to build consumer trust in the financial sector and expand the 
confidence of households to wisely use financial services.   

172. Partnerships and leverage.  The World Bank and IFC are coordinating their support for 
financial and private sector development through better information sharing, overall business planning 
and complementary support. As the FSDP II is phasing out, the World Bank will also work with CPs 
such as DFID in addressing the access to finance agenda for lower income groups, transformational 
banking and the use of technology in increasing access to finance.  

C. Objective Three: Improving Governance and Strengthening Economic Management 
173. There is a strong recognition within Government that accountability, transparency and 
good governance remain the cornerstone for prudent management of public affairs, provide the 
enabling environment for private sector development and for development outcomes to benefit the 
people of Zambia. On the supply side this will entail continued efforts to reform policies and improve 
the information base in the country by, among others things, helping to develop good statistical 
capacity. On the demand side this will entail the enhancement of non-state actor voice around issues of 
public service delivery. Wherever possible, the linkages or interface between these two sides will be 
emphasized. Contribution to development of skills will also be important for improving the 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performance of both public and private sectors as the low quality of human capital constraints both 
public and private sector performance.  

OUTCOME 3.1: STRENGTHENED SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES FOR PUBLIC SECTOR 
PERFORMANCE  
174. Analytical Underpinnings: Substantial analytical 
work is available to underpin Bank’s dialogue and support 
on public sector issues. Analytical work includes the 
PEMFAR 2004, the Jobs and Competitiveness Report 
(2010), the Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2010), the 
Poverty Assessment 2012. Several reports and evaluations 
have also been prepared by the Government such as PEFA, 
2005, 2008, and 2012 (draft). The Bank has also carried out 
an assessment of debt management capacity (DEMPA 
2011) and prepared a Public Debt Management Reform 
Plan (World Bank 2013b).

175. Trust Fund and IDA resources: The previous 
CAS included a PSM project and a series of three budget 
support operations, the latter in coordination with other 
PRBS donors. 33 During this CPS, the Bank will explore, in 
partnership with other donors, budget support credits that 
would disburse against agreed milestones. Given the 
prevailing environment around major policy reforms, the 
CPS proposes a flexible approach. The credits could include 
policy actions if the Government prepares a strong program 
of policy reforms that are reflected in the PAF. In the 
absence of strong policy actions, the Bank will consider 
other instruments (e.g. Program-for-Results (PforR)) also to 
support a program of institutional reforms and capacity building for economic and public sector 
management. The areas covered could include PFM, procurement, debt management, fiscal 
decentralization, project appraisal, M&E and statistical capacity building. The underlying strategy 
would be to complement financial support with advisory activities through trust funds. An institutional 
assessment of the Road Development Agency is also being undertaken using a Governance Partnership 
Facility (GPF) funds with a view to identifying institutional weaknesses and entry points for reform.  

Partnership and leverage  
WB and other CPs, e.g. DFID on PSM  and 
PFM  reforms 

176. A multi-donor trust fund will provide support for PFM activities such as improved 
financial reporting, continued roll out of IFMIS to district levels, internal and external audit, budget 
preparation and execution and public procurement reform.  Support will also be provided for addressing 
weaknesses in processes and systems in institutions charged with ensuring that public resources are 
utilized for the purposes that they are intended, such as the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Office 
of the Auditor General.  

177. The global EITI trust fund will generally promote greater transparency and 
accountability in the operations of extractive industries in Zambia. Globally the international EITI 
standard is moving towards leveraging EITI compliance towards concrete actions on PFM 
improvements (specifically PEFA indicators) and formal links towards budget transparency initiatives 
such as open budge index. The World Bank’s TA program for Zambia EITI is in its post compliance 
phase and is emphasizing these “beyond EITI” goals. Another trust fund is providing technical 
assistance to support the efficiency of mineral revenue collection and investment in Zambia.  

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
178. Partnership and Leverage: The Bank will continue to work closely with other CPs (including 
in the direct budget support group) to support strategic PSM and PFM reforms.  For example, the Bank 
is partnering with DFID to provide technical assistance on IFMIS through an externally financed output 
(EFO) mechanism and has offered to provide the lead technical support for the next phase of PFM 
reforms. Discussions are in progress for a possible multi-donor trust fund for pooling the resources for 
PFM reforms that will build on lessons learned from PEMFA and successful practices elsewhere. The 
Bank will also seek to provide technical support to decentralization in collaboration with Germany 
provided certain policy agreements are forthcoming within the Government. 

179. AAA.  The Bank will use regular Economic Briefs, along with structured regular meetings with 
the Bank of Zambia for macroeconomic policy dialogue. In the area of strengthening public sector 
performance the current requests from the Government are for targeted expert knowledge and advice. 
The Bank will thus support a just-in-time advisory approach through brief policy and guidance notes, 
peer-to-peer learning (e.g. the regional Workshop on M&E) to present different reform options to the 
Government and then gradually expand engagement and set the foundation for more transformational 
reforms. The underlying Bank strategy would be to use a flexible, incremental approach in line with 
reform appetite. The Bank will focus on those PSM areas, where not only the demand for engagement 
is high, but also where there is likely to be a high economic or social impact on service-delivery which 
can over time build the foundation for more fundamental public sector reforms. The Bank is well-
positioned to bring its knowledge to bear to also analyze the political economy of reforms and facilitate 
knowledge exchanges and access to international good practices. All Bank supported activities will 
seek to assist the Government in strengthening the results-orientation of public institutions, improving 
the effectiveness of service delivery, and enhancing accountability and transparency in the civil service. 
Knowledge products will initially be focused on areas for which the Government has requested 
immediate support: Civil service performance and pay policies, assets declarations and related -e-
government 
initiatives; Government-wide performance, monitoring and evaluation system, 
improvement of statistics and labor surveys, project appraisal and analysis, policy paper writing using 
data from the Zambia Macroeconomic model (ZAMMOD).  

180. Analytical activities will also be carried out to update the PEFA scores on an annual basis 
using them as the basis for monitoring some of the proposed reforms. The Bank team will also 
carry out a gap analysis to assess the variances between national and international accounting and 
auditing standards and practices in the public sector. Technical assistance is also expected to be 
provided for strengthening of Government’s capability for physical monitoring of mining production, 
assay and exports and effective licensing and cadaster administration systems.  

181. Regular economic briefs prepared by the Zambia country team (para 152) will provide 
credible economic information and an assessment of recent economic developments and outlook in the 
short to medium term. In addition it will include an analysis on a specific development topic or theme 
which is expected to support evidence-based policy debate in the country, strengthen public demand for 
good policies and outcomes and inform government policies and programs.

OUTCOME 3.2: CITIZEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION INCREASED 

182. Analytical underpinnings: The Bank’s support to 
demand for good governance (DFGG) is grounded in the 
recognition that institutional reforms will be most effective 
when supported by genuine demand from an informed 
citizenry. The Bank’s current non-state actor engagement is 
informed by a review entitled Stocktaking of DFGG 
Mechanisms in the Zambia Portfolio (2011) as well as by 
analytical work carried out under the GPF. A number of 
specific pilot activities have been undertaken in FY11-12. 
Evaluations of these initiatives have further helped refine 
the activities outlined herein. In line with the Government’s 
own priorities, the underlying objective of the Bank’s 
citizen-engagement is to strengthen public service-delivery.  

183. Trust Funds and IDA resources: To mainstream a 
governance approach across the Zambia lending portfolio, 
Bank lending projects do increasingly incorporate demand-
side engagement components as part of their attempt to 
mitigate risks. For example, the Road Rehabilitation and 
Maintenance Project Phase II makes awarded contract 
proactively available for review by local communities. 
Beyond the first year the emphasis will be on scaling and 
mainstreaming the most promising of the DFGG activities.

supported by the  EU/Norway/DFID-funded  
Mining Basket Fund and AfDB 

184. Through an EITI Trust Fund the World Bank will continue to support the capacity-building 
of non-state actors to engage in the EITI process.  

185. The GPF will remain the main source of DFGG funding until it ends in January 2014. The 
categories of activity under the GPF are threefold: 
• 
Improving beneficiary feedback in Bank projects: The development and piloting of “On Track”, an 
ICT-enabled feedback system that will enable beneficiaries to submit issues and request 
information whilst also allowing project teams to proactively survey beneficiaries on a regular basis 
is being supported. The platform builds upon lessons learned from the e-ISR plus initiative.  
• Coalition-building and citizen-monitoring: To build the capacity of key issues-based coalitions to 
generate informed public discussion and citizen monitoring on important reform topics. The Bank 
has been engaging with the Zambia Extractives Watch coalition, the Procurement Watch Coalition 
and the Access to Information Coalition. Support is also being considered to implement a third 
party monitoring pilot in the roads sector.   
• Building public interest media: To address structural impediments to a strong public interest media 
in Zambia and train journalists in investigative skills. A radio pilot utilizes a combination of SMS 
technologies and community radio to create a model, interactive radio program that improves 
information dissemination amongst rural constituents on key policy issues and provides 
communities with a direct mechanism to hold public service providers to account.  

186. A possible new Anti-Corruption Fund is expected to provide resources for strengthening the 
efforts of state and non-state actors in Zambia to fight corruption and improve governance.

187. AAA. The GPF supports several pieces of analytical work and technical assistance activities 
including to the mining sector for EITI, to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Access to 
Information, institutional assessment for RDA, political economy analyses and technical notes. Regular 
GPF Snapshots provide updates on GPF activities. 

188. Partnerships and leverage: On the Accountability through Community radio pilot the Bank 
has partnered with Cambridge University’s Centre for Governance and Human Rights. With the 
Support to Investigative Journalism pilot the Bank has established strong partnerships with The Mail & 
Guardian in South Africa and The Bureau for Investigative Journalism in UK. The Bank is currently 
exploring the possibility of a joint media fund with other CPs. The On Track pilot is the result of an 
internal Bank collaboration between WBI, AFTOS and PREM. Support to Procurement Watch is also 
the result of a partnership with WBI. 

D. Implementing and Monitoring the CPS 
189. The WBG will provide support for the implementation of the CPS through a lean, high-
capacity team core team while drawing on global expertise on specific areas (for example, PPP, 
pension reform, debt management) as needed. Technical expertise will be maintained in the country 
office in sectors such as agriculture and energy and in cross- sector areas such as fiduciary compliance. 
The World Bank, IFC and MIGA management will ensure better information sharing between the three 
organizations to increase collaboration for better results. The Bank’s current reform agenda, including 
improving existing products, increasing results-based financing, increasing the use of Bank guarantees, 
and simplifying Bank procurement procedures, provides a good opportunity to adapt Bank policies to 
support MICs generally and implementation of a flexible CPS in Zambia. 

190. The Bank will strive for increased use of Zambia’s financial management systems for 
investment operations, in line with the Accra Agenda for Action and consistent with World Bank 
financial management policy. Zambia has already made a start in the use of country systems, and the 
Irrigation Development and Support Project and the Livestock Development and Animal Health Project 
are using country systems. The Bank carried out a study (January, 2012) to assess fiduciary risks in 
using country FM systems. The assessment shows that overall there is scope for increased use of 
Zambia’s PFM system for Bank-financed investment projects provided appropriate mitigation measures 
are implemented for various aspects of the financial management system. Based on implementation 
experience with the two projects, the plan is to expand the use of country FM systems to other projects 
also using a cautious approach.   

191. The CPS Results framework presents the results chain for the WBGs’ program of support 
(Annex 1).  It uses Zambia’s SNDP as its starting point, and narrows down the range of outcomes to 
those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the CPS period. Where possible, interventions will 
support impact assessments before scale up or mainstreaming into Government programs. For example, 
the health operation is supporting an innovative results-based financing program that finances agreed 
priority health results rather than inputs. Impact evaluations of close to completion projects, for 
example ADSP in collaboration with PREM DIME team are also being undertaken and are also 
planned for newly implementing projects (irrigation and livestock projects) by mid-term. As new 
projects and programs are prepared task teams will be encouraged to adopt design options that link 
financing to results. This will be done through use of performance-linked incremental financing and 
output based aid.  It will also be explored to what extent the recently designed PforR instrument can be 
used in new operations.  

192. The Bank will work with the Government to monitor portfolio performance and is taking 
several steps to improve portfolio quality. Regular meetings will be held with World Bank project 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
coordinators with the participation of MOF where portfolio wide issues will be identified and 
discussed. As needed, focused technical assistance will be provided to deal with capacity constraints, 
including for PFM and PSM. The Bank is also working with relevant Government officials to resolve 
some of the root causes of past poor disbursements—capacity constraints in ZPPA—through providing 
the agency with training, support with creating service standards, preparing standard bidding 
documents and simplification of clearance procedures. Internal World Bank constraints that could be 
inhibiting disbursements are also being examined. A governance team, located in the Zambia country 
office, that meets periodically to assess governance and anti-corruption initiatives will advise the 
Country Director and the CMU on project specific governance issues. 

193. The World Bank has taken measures to integrate trust fund programs and Bank-funded 
programs and to ensure that trust funds are aligned with the CPS. Analytical work activities 
supported through trust funds undergo an equally rigorous quality assurance process and trust fund 
financed activities are implemented in accordance with the same fiduciary requirements as IDA 
financed operations.  

194. The WBG will prepare a CPS progress report in 2014 that will assess progress towards 
outcomes and adjust the strategy as needed.  

V. RISKS AND MITIGATION 

195. The risks involved in achieving the results targeted by the CPS during its implementation 
period are categorized into political, institutional and external risks.  

A. Political Risks 
196. Having seen four peaceful transitions Zambia has a stable political system. The risk of a 
big, disruptive political change is low. The CPS is co-terminus with the time span of the new PF 
Government. Therefore, no major changes in political leadership are foreseen. The country is working 
on a new constitution and the transition to it will likely be smooth and peaceful, providing enough 
space for the Bank to adjust its business plan to changes, if needed.  

197. Risk of major change in development priorities is low. The new PF Government has largely 
adopted the Vision 2030 and the SNDP. The remaining SNDP period is also co-terminus with the CPS 
life. Therefore it is unlikely that the development strategy that underpins the CPS will see a major shift 
during the CPS. It is however, still unclear how the Government will address issues in several critical 
areas such as subsidies in the agriculture sector, and reforms in the energy and road sectors. The Bank 
will continue to work with Government and other CPs to generate momentum for reform of these 
policies. In the energy sector it will continue to support reforms as a part of its, lending, analytical work 
and policy dialogue. Where possible, it will bring lessons of experience from other developing 
countries to inform the dialogue in the country on these issues. The Bank will also focus on activities 
that are not influenced by radically changing policies and on institutional reforms and capacity building 
in areas where a wide government ownership exists. As described earlier these areas relate to PFM, 
procurement reform, building M&E capacity, capacity of statistical systems, and for project appraisal. 

198. Risk from frequent administrative changes is high. In the last year there have been frequent 
changes in senior management positions, including at the ministerial level that have affected the 
functioning of the Government machinery. Ministries and districts have also been re-aligned frequently. 
These changes have been disruptive to the smooth implementation of programs. To mitigate the risk, 
the Bank will strengthen its engagement with a wider set of stakeholders within the Government on the 

40 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programs it pursues so that departure of individuals does not derail the program. Overall pace of 
movement on Bank-supported programs is likely to remain a function of administrative stability. 

B. Institutional Risks 

199. The Government’s need to tackle fundamental reforms in public governance. Governance 
remains weak where institutions charged with oversight have not been very effective and public 
administration systems and controls are challenged. Procurement capacity also remains weak. 
Successive governments have been implementing reforms addressing the efficiency and accountability 
of the public sector, and tackling corruption, but with limited success. There are now new opportunities 
to work with the new Government as it has placed improving governance institutions and anti-
corruption at the core of its programs.  The MOF for example, realizes the need to strengthen debt 
management capacity (as evident in the recently released MOF Strategy for the next five years) and 
initiated the request for a follow-up to the DEMPA mission. 

200. The Bank will continue working with Government on improving PFM and building 
institutions under the PSM program.  The Bank is working in the roads sector, at Government’s 
request, to assist in the development and implementation of an integrity plan to address governance 
weaknesses identified by various reviews and assessments. Government had engaged an independent 
fiduciary review agent for one year who addressed fiduciary concerns and built capacity in the health 
sector. A multi-sectoral governance team works with task teams in addressing governance challenges at 
project level.  

201. The World Bank has started, as a pilot, activities to improve accountability of the 
Government vis-à-vis citizens by supporting demand for good governance. These activities are 
aimed at enhancing the capability of citizens to hold the state and service providers accountable and 
make them responsive to the needs of the citizenry. Such activities could help improve the efficiency of 
government interventions, for example by better targeting, and improve effectiveness of institutions 
through feedback mechanisms and monitoring. These improvements would ultimately lead to better 
development outcomes.   

202. The fiduciary risk of the portfolio is substantial.  After the governance issues in the health 
and road sectors came to light, the Bank carried out an in-depth financial management review of all 
projects in the portfolio.  Ineligible expenses were identified in many projects and the Government is in 
the process of repaying the agreed amounts. The generic issues for occurrence of ineligible expenses as 
highlighted in these in-depth reviews relate to: weak control environment, differing treatment of 
allowances, weak internal audit, lack of understanding of Bank’s FM, procurement and disbursement 
procedures, poor contract management, submission of duplicate claims, unretired advances, insufficient 
controls over the usage of government property and serious lack of follow up on audit findings.  While 
there have been improvements in some of these areas, efforts are being taken by the Bank and the 
government project teams to discuss and agree on corrective steps through fiduciary clinics and 
discussions during implementation support missions. The generic issues are also being brought to the 
attention of MoF and the Internal Audit Unit for regular monitoring/compliance.  The progress is slow 
and some of the capacity building interventions take time to translate to positive outcomes. A two 
pronged approach is being used– interventions through multi-donor PFM program at the country level 
and targeted interventions through individual projects at the sector level. The Bank will also organize 
periodic portfolio review meetings focusing on fiduciary and implementation aspects to address the 
issues in a timely fashion. Country systems use is being done only cautiously and on a pilot basis.  The 
Bank is also improving the internal work flow and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that delays do not 
occur within the Bank system in providing clearances and responding to letters from the government. 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
203. Procurement risks. While reforms have picked up and procurement has been decentralized it 
still remains to be seen how far this will improve implementation. Actions on procurement will also be 
monitored in the new PEFA indicators as part of decentralization of procurement. The Bank will 
continue to provide procurement training for private sector consultants and suppliers and contractors 
and public sector officials. 

204. 
Implementation Capacity. The Government has had challenges in policy implementation, 
specifically policies linked to public sector reform, the civil service compensation structure, and budget 
execution in public finance management.  This risk will be mitigated to a large extent by the activities 
of ongoing lending and TA programs. The Bank and other CPs are also supporting Government 
capacity building in PSM and public expenditure management, and in the reform of financial 
accountability protocols. Several CPs are also supporting implementation of reform programs involving 
oversight institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General and the Parliament.   

C. External Shocks 
205. The lasting effects of the global financial crisis and the economy’s continued reliance on a 
single primary-commodity export could threaten Zambia’s growth rate if copper prices were to 
fall significantly. It is not clear that there will be consensus on how to respond to such a circumstance 
and, more importantly, that the political resolve by the Government to tackle difficult issues involved 
will be present.  However, the adequate size of the country’s international reserves combined with 
continued flexible exchange rate policy should allow absorption of the economic shock that such an 
event would trigger. Besides sound macroeconomic policies, both strong debt management and project 
appraisal capacity are needed to maintain debt sustainability in the face of increasing dependence on 
non-concessional borrowing. The Bank and other CPs are also helping the Government to diversify the 
national economy through support for agriculture, private sector development and policy dialogue on 
structural reforms. This effort has thus far been successful, as evidenced by an increase in Zambia’s 
exports of non-mineral products.

5. Rate of growth of the population is high compared to the Sub-Saharan growth rate of 2.5 percent and that of lower middle income 
countries of 1.5 percent. 
6. The recent World Development Report (WDR) on Jobs notes how many countries with high youth unemployment have education 
and training systems that are not developing the kinds of skills needed by the private sector. 
7. In current GDP this number is potentially higher, about 20 percent. But due to higher deflator for agriculture the contribution 
reduces to 14 percent in real GDP terms.  
8. The increased production in recent years is because of good weather conditions rather than a structural increase in agricultural 
productivity.  
9. All five transit routes have unit road transport costs that are below the regional average (World Bank 2009b). 
10. There has been some diversification, however, with increasing investments in agriculture (directed mainly at the production of 
fruit, flowers, horticultural products, cotton, maize, tobacco, and sugar), construction, telecommunications, tourism and other 
services.

18. The recent Annual Work Plans of the Road Development Agency (RDA) shows that there is a very strong focus on 
rehabilitation and upgrading roads to paved standard and that significant parts of the unpaved road network are not maintained at all. 
The OPRC-contracting methodology is ideally suited to improve the quality of this part of the road network with the RDA already 
having decided to roll it out over the entire unpaved road network. Successful roll-out would reduce business costs significantly. 
19. 40 percent of the country has not been geologically surveyed.

21.World Governance Indicators monitor six areas namely: (i) Voice and Accountability; (ii) Political Stability; (iii) Government 
Effectiveness; (iv) Regulatory Quality; (v)  Rule of Law; and (vi) Control of Corruption. 
22. The EITI is the global standard that ensures transparency of the revenues from a country’s extractive sector.  Zambia becomes 
the 15th EITI compliant country and the first in the East, Central and Southern African region. EITI compliance means that the 
country has an effective process for annual disclosure and reconciliation of all revenues from its extractive sector, allowing citizens 
to see how much their country receives from oil, gas and mining companies. 
23. The Poverty Reduction Budget Support Group comprises the European Union, UK (DIFD), Germany, Norway, Finland, the 
World Bank, and the AfDB.    
24. The facility was to recondition used parts and components from heavy-duty earth-moving machinery, primarily in the mining 
sector, to provide a more cost-effective maintenance solution to serve clients within Zambia as well as in adjacent countries. 
25 A gender portfolio review was undertaken in preparing the CPS and its findings will inform country policy and dialogue on 
gender in the coming years. The current portfolio is above the IDA16 target of 60 percent on mainstreaming gender as all active 
projects are gender informed on at least one of the following dimensions: (1) analysis; (2) actions; (3) M&E (see Annex 16 for 
details). The WBG will further deepen attention to gender to go beyond the simple fulfillment of the IDA16 target through: 
increasing attention to gender in M&E frameworks; increasing the integration of gender into current AAA work; increasing the 
proportion of operations that use existing gender diagnostics and analytical work to inform their design 
26. The extensive wide ranging dialogue between Mongolian and their Chilean counterparts facilitated by a strong IMF and World 
Bank partnership significantly helped Mongolian policy makers understand the challenges posed by Mongolia’s mineral wealth, 
learn from Chile’s success and move decisively to take appropriate reforms (World Bank 2012j). 
27. Projects must cover at least 3 countries, and demonstrate benefits to more than one country.  
28. GPOBA is a World Bank-administered global program with funding from DFID, DGIS, IFC, AUSAID, and SIDA. 
29. The African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) launched CAADP in 2003 at the Maputo 
African Heads of State summit. The CAADP emphasizes the role of agriculture in reducing poverty and food insecurity in Africa 
and aims to accelerate agricultural development in African countries to a minimum annual sector growth of 6 percent with 
allocations of at least 10 percent of the national budget to the agriculture sector. 
30. GAFSP is a multilateral mechanism to address the underfunding of country and regional agriculture and food security strategic 
investment plans. Nine donors, including the US and the Gates Foundation have pledged US$1.2 billion equivalent to GAFSP and 
as of August end 2012 US$ 855 million equivalent had been received. Several countries in Africa and Asia are already benefiting 
from these resources.  
31. See Bank of Zambia 2012. 
32. In June 2004, the Government approved a five year Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) for Zambia covering the period 
2004 – 2009. A further three-year extension of the FSDP into phase II was approved by the Government in January 2010.   
33. ICRs for these projects are yet to be prepared.

Strategic Objective 1: REDUCING POVERTY AND THE VULNERABILITY OF THE POOR 

Issues and Obstacles 

CPS Outcomes 

Milestones 

Bank Group Program (and 
Partners) 

In order to reduce the high poverty levels in 
the rural areas focus will be on stimulating 
agriculture productivity and promotion of 
agro-businesses 
Indicator:  
Baseline Rural Poverty: 77.9(LCMS 2010) 
Target Rural Poverty:<50% (2015) 

During the SNDP period, overall crop 
production increase is expected to come 
from expansion of areas under cultivation 
and irrigation as well as increased 
productivity through the use of improved 
seed varieties and linkages between 
research and extension services. 
Indicator: Agriculture Exports as a 
percentage of non-traditional exports 
2011: 44%  
Target: 55% (2015) 

Zambia’s land and water 
resources could be used more 
effectively to promote the 
development of the agriculture 
sector whose role in the 
economy has stayed well below 
potential. Productivity is low 
because of inadequate use of 
fertilizers, weak research and 
extension systems, lack of 
irrigation and access to markets 
particularly for small-scale 
operators in remote areas, poor 
rural roads and limited or 
expensive finance. There is 
limited investment in these 
priority areas for the 
development of the sector.  

Outcome 1.1 Improved crop 
and animal productivity in 
selected areas 

Indicator 1.1.1:   
Yields increase (tons /ha) for major 
irrigated crops in target sites 
Baseline (2010):  
Tomatoes: 10 
Onions: 12 
Wheat: na 
Bananas na 
Target (2016):   
Tomatoes 31 
Onions: 32 
Wheat: 29 
Banana:31 

Milestones for indicator 1.1. 1:  
• Area covered by feasibility 
studies 
• Area provided with new 
irrigation 
• New technologies 
demonstrated  

The livestock sub-sector that 
accounts for about 35% of 
agriculture GDP suffers from 
inadequate disease control and 
other problems 

Indicator 1.1.2: 
Increase in livestock productivity in 
project areas  
Baseline: (2012) 
hen mortality %: 40 
kid (young goat) mortality %:33 
weaned piglets per sow per year %: 12 
milk per cow per day liters: 6 

Target (2015)  
Reduced hen mortality %: 33 
Reduced kid (young goat) mortality 
%:30 
Increased weaned piglets per sow per 
year %: 14 
Increase milk per cow per day liters: 7 

The main thrust of the livestock sub–sector 
will be to increase livestock production 
through prevention and control of livestock 
diseases, improving production and 
productivity of the various livestock species 
and promotion of the Public Private 

• 

Milestones for indicator 1.1. 2: 
• Vaccination coverage in 
project risk areas against 
diseases 
Small holder livestock 
owners (male and female) 
satisfied by the quality of 
veterinary services 
supported by the project 
Smallholder livestock 
owners adopt at least one

extreme temperatures and dry 
spells during the wet season.  
These trends are expected to 
intensify in the future. In the 
absence of adaptation, rainfall 
variability alone could keep an 
additional 300,000 people 
below the poverty line over the 
next decade, and affect annual 
GDP growth by 0.9 percent. 

Country Development Objectives 
and Results 

During the SNPD period, the main aim is to 
reduce the socio-economic impact of 
disasters by enhancing and building strong 
disaster risk management mechanisms at 
community, district and national level as 
well as building infrastructure that can 
withstand natural disasters. This will be 
achieved through enhanced planning, 
response, reconstruction, rehabilitation and 
disaster mitigation. Efforts to achieve this 
include the integration of disaster risk 
management into sustainable development 
planning and programming at all levels.

During the SNDP, in addition to improving 
agriculture productivity, improving the 
provision of basic services such as water 
and sanitation, health, education and skills 
development is also emphasized. 

The Government recognizes health as one 
of the priority sectors. During the SNDP the 
focus will be on promoting preventive, 
curative and rehabilitative health services. 

Indicator: Under-5 Mortality Rate (per 

Maternal and child mortality 
continue to be at unacceptably 
high levels despite the progress 
Zambia made in 2007. 

Zambia is unlikely to meet 
MDGs 4 and 5.High prevalence 
of malnutrition, malaria and 
HIV/AIDS also contributes to 
the high maternal and child 
mortality.

Zambia not only needs to 
invest more money into health 
(Abuja target of 15% still to be 
achieved), but also needs to 
examine whether current 
investments are efficient and 
cost- effective.  Without 
updated financial and 
performance data, and a 
comprehensive health financing 
strategy, Zambia faces a huge 
challenge in optimally 
mobilizing and allocating 
resources.

To enhance economic development of the 
prioritized economic sectors through 
provision of improved quality infrastructure 
The SNDP emphasizes road and railway 
transport maintenance and rehabilitation, 
including improving access for rural

increasing access to electricity. The 
Government recognizes the energy sector as 
a key driver of growth and increasing 
irrigation infrastructure.

diversification and growth. 

One of the challenges facing 
Zambia is the vulnerability and 
increasing constraints derived 
from a number of water related 
factors. Frequent droughts and 
floods, hydrological variability 
and seasonal water shortages 
compounded by growing water 
demand from the major sectors 
of the economy and limited 
water infrastructure impose a 
serious constraint on medium 
and long term growth prospects

The high cost of finance and limited access 
to financial services is a constraint to capital 
formation and growth. The objective of 
Government during the Plan period is to 
continue making improvements in the 
macroeconomic environment so as to 
support activities across all spheres of

support the expected reduction in lending 
rates by the commercial banks. The 
Financial Sector Development Programme 
(FSDP) is the broad reform programme for 
the financial sector and will continue to be

Strategic Objective 3: IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT 

Issues and Obstacles 

CPS Outcomes 

Milestones 

Bank Group Program (and 
Partners) 

Government will continue to promote 
good governance during the SNDP period 
in the following areas (i) enhancing 
integrity, accountability and transparency 
in public and private bodies; 2) improving 
access to Justice by all especially for the 
vulnerable; 3) promoting human rights and 
4) enhancing democratization. 

The Government intends to put in place 
effective mechanisms that prevent 
corruption, improve service delivery and 
promote broad-based participation in 
public affairs.  

Weaknesses remain in public 
finance and human resource 
management, including limited 
monitoring and evaluation and 
suboptimal statistics. 

There is a lack of focal point on 
public financial management 
reforms 

Both the executive and oversight 
institutions have not been able to 
fully implement their stated 
mandate because of inadequate 
capacity and low expertise. 
Informal oversight through 
social accountability is also 
weak. There is recurring 
misuse/misappropriation of 
public resources. Though there 
is legislation requiring 
disclosure of assets, its scope is 
limited and there is no 
verification in practice. 

The prevalent mindset in the 
civil service still remains 
inhibitive to results-oriented 
delivery. Though some progress 
has been made (e.g. pay policy 
reforms), there now needs to be 
a shift from process to results. 
This requires strategic 
performance management and 
monitoring framework across 
Government, with specific-time-
bound targets and indicators 
against which progress can be 
measured.

Issues and Obstacles 

CPS Outcomes 

Milestones 

The SNDP notes the Government’s 
commitment to improve the efficiency, 
effectiveness, transparency and 
accountability of public funds. 

Specifically for the mining sector, 
Government has also committed to sustain 
and build upon the gains made by the 
Zambian Extractive Industry Transparency 
Initiative (ZEITI) on transparency of 
mining revenues and civil society 
participation  

Suboptimal transparency 
and accountability levels 
and use of demand-side 
governance instruments, 
especially at the sub-
national levels  

Transparency in the mining 
sector is key.   
Transparency through 
Zambia EITI process, 
including quality 
improvements in EITI data 
disclosure and IT 
automation,  as well as 
strong engagement by civil 
society building upon 
Zambia's recent attainment 
of EITI-compliant status 

Outcome 3.2: Citizen access 
to information increased 

Indicator 3.2.1:  
Strengthened capacity of journalists 
Baseline (2012): Low levels of 
investigative journalism in Zambian 
media 
Target (2016): Increase in levels of 
investigative journalism in Zambian 
media 

Milestones for Indicator 3.2.1 
 75 of Zambia’s most promising 
journalists (15 per year) trained 
and mentored in investigative 
skills. Journalists trained in 
skills of reporting on technical 
topics (including EITI, mining 
taxation, roads, access to 
information etc.) 

Indicator 3.2.2: 
Transparency 
Baseline (2012): Zambia is now EITI-
compliant  
Target (next validation due 2017): 
Maintain EITI-compliant status, 
including regular publication of mining 
revenues.

the Bank has established strong 
partnerships with The Mail & Guardian in 
South Africa and The Bureau for 
Investigative Journalism in UK. WB and 
DfID are currently exploring the 
possibility of a joint media fund that 
would provide institutional grants towards 
the development of investigative 
journalism. The On Track pilot is the 
result of an internal Bank collaboration 
between WBI, AFTOS and PREM. 

Zambia EITI, and Zambian civil society, 
are supported by WB with technical 
assistance and grant funding via the EITI 
MDTF.   ZEITI is additional supported by 
the EU/Norway/DFID-funded  Mining 
Basket Fund and AfDB 

Note: (i)  Because of the flexible nature of the CPS, operations for the outer year have not yet been finalized and therefore do not figure in this results matrix. These will 
be reflected in the results matrix for the CPS Progress Report. For projects that are currently being designed (e.g. energy, access to finance for SMEs) changes in the 
indicators as the design is finalized will also get reflected in the CPS Progress Report. 
(ii) The country development objectives and results are from the Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP) 2011–2015 and the indicators are also derived from that 
plan. The objectives of the SNDP are to: accelerate infrastructure development; economic growth and diversification; promote rural investment and accelerate poverty 
reduction and enhance human development.

This proposed project will rehabilitate the electricity distribution infrastructure in Lusaka and Copperbelt regions. 
To assist in realizing the greater contribution of water resources to economic growth and climate resilience. Involves, among other things, scaling 
up of small scale water resource investments programs in support of community development and livelihood diversification; supporting 
development of a pipeline of infrastructure investment programs through feasibility studies; strengthening water resource management capacity in 
the Kafue and Zambezi basins. 
The development objective of the project is to strengthen the institutional framework for climate resilience in Zambia and improve the adaptive 
capacity of vulnerable rural communities in the Barotse sub-basin. Considering Zambia’s long-term institutional strengthening needs, the project 
would be implemented over a six year period, from 2013 to 2019, with subsequent programmatic phases expected.  
SME credit: The proposed development objective of the project is to broaden and deepen access to medium- and long-term finance of small and 
medium enterprises in Zambia, with a view to ultimately contributing to increased productivity and job creation. 
Budget Support: During this CPS, the Bank will explore, in partnership with other donors, budget support credits that would disburse against 
agreed milestones. The credits could include policy actions if the Government prepares a strong program of policy reforms that are reflected in the 
PAF.

Annex 13: Copper in Zambia 

A bifurcated history 

The history of Zambia’s copper mining is one of decline under State ownership followed 
by revival.  From a production level of around 700,000 tons in the early 1970s when the industry 
was in the private sector, copper production under state ownership gradually fell to just 255,000 tons 
in 1998-2000.   Although stakeholders did perceive some benefit from state-ownership of the mining 
industry, in overall terms nationalization of the mines proved to be counter-productive.  When the 
reversal of state-ownership began to occur in the early 2000s, the industry was loss-making (financial 
losses of almost US$1 million/day) and suffering from little or no investment and ever-declining 
output.  Since that period, mining in Zambia has rebounded greatly though the industry’s potential to 
contribute to poverty reduction remains underutilized (Box 1).  Several new international and 
domestic companies entered the industry. Buoyed by high copper prices over this period, and an 
attractive investment climate, Zambia saw FDI flows estimated at US$5 billion over this period, both 
in greenfield sites and in expansion of existing operations.  As a result, output is now at the 800,000 
metric tons (m/t) mark, expected to grow to around 1.3 million m/t by 2015 (which would place 
Zambia among the top 5-6 producers globally).  This growth has resulted in jobs with large-scale 
mining operations now accounting for over 60,000 people in direct employment (with almost as 
many engaged in smaller or artisanal mining).  Overall, mining now accounts for around 10% of 
Zambia’s GDP. 

Box 1: Mining and Job Creation 

Despite the large copper production the country has yet to benefit fully from the industry. Part of the reason for this 
is historical. It is widely accepted that the nationalization of the mines during the 1970s led to under-investment, 
falling output and financial losses to the stage where the industry became a major drain on the exchequer (World 
Bank 2011e). After privatization, in the 2000s, the immediate policy priority was to stabilize the sector. Rising 
commodity prices and an enabling environment led to higher investment and copper output revived significantly. 
Output is now stated to be at the 800,000 metric tons (m/t) mark, and is expected to grow to around 1.3 million m/t 
by 2015 (placing Zambia among the top 5-6 producers globally).  The mining sector, however, has not so far 
provided much for needed investment in infrastructure and human development though the contribution of the 
sector towards Government revenues is increasing. During the period 2008-11, mining revenues averaged around 
2.6 percent of GDP, a sharp increase from the previous range of 1-1.4 percent of GDP. One factor behind the past 
low contribution was the investment incentives then prevailing and the overhang of accumulated income tax losses 
within the mining companies. Further, copper mining is capital-intensive and employs only about 2 percent of the 
population. It has also not provided the backward and forward linkages for development of local industry. To this 
day mining companies’ source 95 percent of their inputs (such as capital plant, operating consumables, engineering 
inputs, safety equipment) for mining operations from overseas.  

The rebound in Zambia’s mining sector over the past decade and the continuing strong 
investment flows in the sector have underpinned Zambia’s macro-economic performance in 
recent years - and it’s attaining of lower middle-income status in 2011. Indeed, mining has been a 
key factor in Zambia’s recent GDP growth story. Notwithstanding this, Zambia’s poverty levels 
remain stubbornly high and the benefits of mining not seen as having had much impact yet on 
Zambia’s broader development goals.  Indeed, deep-seated concerns about mining remain, in 
particular the sense that the benefits of the mining boom have not been widely or fairly shared; that 
mining revenues have not made a dent in Zambia’s human development; and that the environmental 
and social costs of mining are not fully factored -in nor regulated effectively.  On the latter, there are 
legacy concerns from old mining operations yet to be fully addressed, while the growing extent of 
exploration and extraction activities in new minerals like uranium require an even more effective set 

77 

 
 
 
 
 
 
of regulations and enforcement capacity.   Similarly there are misgivings among many about 
perceived low level of tax payments by companies (seen as resulting from overly-generous mining 
development agreements and of inadequate oversight by Government of mining operations and 
production and in ensuring effective tax compliance). 

Further, there are two overarching factors that are relevant:  One is that Zambia’s 
regulatory regime for mining (and its key linkages - fiscal, environment and social) has not kept pace 
with the structure and size of the sector.    Zambia’s current regulatory structure and capacity was 
designed to oversee a single state-owned mining company.  But today Zambia has a private sector-
led industry, comprising many large and small mining operations and ever-growing exploration 
activity, including by some of the largest global mining companies.   The second factor is the need 
for effective strategies for broad-based development anchored on mining – infrastructure, value-
addition and small business development – to help turn “enclave” mining projects into sustainable 
development in mining districts - and the institutions and mechanisms to achieve these goals. 

Promoting transparency and community engagement, building on Zambia Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative process (EITI): The Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative, launched in 2003, is the leading standard for promoting transparency and accountability in 
resource rich countries.  It is also a global coalition of resource rich developing countries, donors, 
major companies, civil society groups, and investors.  Countries implementing EITI commit to 
publishing all payments made by oil, gas, and mining companies to government, and all revenues 
received by the government from those companies.  EITI implementers also commit to closely 
involving civil society in the design and monitoring of the EITI process. Zambia is actively 
implementing the global EITI standard and has an effective multi-stakeholder process for this.  

On the plus side, The EITI Board declared Zambia compliant with the EITI standard 
on September 19, 2012.  Zambia becomes the 15th EITI compliant country and the first in the 
East, Central and Southern Africa region. EITI compliance means that the country has an 
effective process for annual disclosure and reconciliation of all revenues from its extractive sector, 
allowing citizens to see how much their country receives from oil, gas and mining companies. EITI 
compliance is a basic platform that encourages the transparency necessary for Zambians to be able to 
agree how best to better manage the mining sector. Further, EITI helps in addressing the gender 
dimensions of mining especially in artisanal mining and community development initiatives, linked 
to mining companies’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) commitments in mining districts.   

The Opportunity Ahead 

Zambia’s mineral wealth represents an important opportunity for the Government and 
people of Zambia to generate financial resources (albeit in a volatile commodity price 
environment) which enables investment in human and infrastructure development and in 
diversifying the economy over time  - in order to help create jobs, raise incomes and reduce 
poverty.  This path of resource-based development is being successfully charted by a number of 
countries who have created the needed laws, policies and effective institutions to achieve their 
national goals, while avoiding the so-called “resource curse” that has often been associated with 
extractive resources.  

Accordingly, the WBG strategy for engaging with GRZ and stakeholders on mining, 
emphasizes a broad-based approach, built around the WBG’s convening role and knowledge-
sharing.  The specific WBG interventions under this strategy (as detailed elsewhere in this CPS 

78 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
document) include bringing together policy-makers and stakeholders and linking them to global best 
practice (for example in facilitating a public-private process of increasing local content of mining 
inputs as a means for job creation and expanding the benefits of mining more widely).  Also a 
priority is analytical support and technical assistance (in partnership with development partners), 
such as that for the Zambia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (ZEITI) and ongoing 
improvements in license cadaster systems and capacity to monitor mining operations and production.   

Beyond that is the potential for financing support for GRZ’s overarching strategies to 
achieve a well-governed and environmentally-sustainable mining sector, including (i) continued 
clean-up on legacy environmental contamination in now-closed mining sites while solidifying the 
regulatory framework for mining-related environmental protection; (ii) developing an integrated 
approach across GRZ for mining and its key linkages (fiscal, infrastructure, environment and social,  
skills and business development), especially to help move from “enclave” mining towards a wider 
pattern of development, jobs and incomes anchored on mining projects; and (iii) building institutions 
and capabilities fit for a new era of mining in Zambia (with more private-sector participants and 
exploration interest than ever) - and which helps achieve national aspirations for a well-governed 
mining sector, with greater Zambian participation, which delivers widely-shared benefits and 
sustainable development over the long haul. 

The Economic Contribution of Zambian Copper Mining is Key:  Over the long term, the 
performance of the Zambian economy has closely followed the fortunes of copper mining. Research 
has well-documented that the decline of copper output after the 1970s set the stage for a period of 
low economic growth with falling per capita GDP. The revival of copper output has helped the 
economy to grow more rapidly, averaging growth of over 6 percent a year during the 2000s.   
Nonetheless, there is the opportunity to advance even further while also managing volatility risks of a 
mineral- dependent economy. 

How Zambia uses its mineral wealth to reduce poverty and improve its development 
prospects is therefore the key development challenge ahead.  An adequate base of domestic 
taxation is of fundamental importance for sustainable development. In order for developing countries 
to escape aid dependency and reduce poverty more broadly, it is imperative that their revenue 
authorities are able to collect tax effectively. Zambia is a case in point, with its major multinational 
mining companies with huge investments supporting large operations in its mines. Unfortunately 
doubts remain on the state’s revenue collection ability and whether all the mining revenues that are 
due are in fact collected.  In any case, it is perceived that the revenues collected from these 
operations have so far had minimal impact on the economic development of the poor Zambians 
measured by static poverty indicators.  Although mining revenues are growing, so far the mining 
industry’s contribution to government revenues is yet to translate into pro-poor economic 
development and the majority of the people still live in poverty particularly in rural areas.   This is 
the fundamental challenge – and opportunity – that the mineral sector affords to Zambia, through a 
long-term effort to harness the nation’s below-the-ground wealth into financial resources that enables 
sustained development, growth and poverty reduction.

Annex 14: Regional Projects and Programs 

As a landlocked country, Zambia’s economic development potential is closely linked to the 
fate and development of its eight bordering countries and other countries in the region. Through its 
membership in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and Southern 
Africa Development Community (SADC), Zambia recognizes the importance of regional integration 
to the development of the country’s economic infrastructure and to boosting intra-regional trade and 
global competitiveness. The two trade blocs have supported liberalization of market access for 
international road freight and harmonization of rules to ensure interoperability in member states 
(MCA 2010). The World Bank has provided support for Zambia’s integration in the region through 
projects in several critical sectors and programs. 

1. Regional Projects 

Energy:  Access to energy is critical for socio-economic development. Energy underpins the 
provision of clean water, health services, education and communication. It is obvious that efficient 
and clean energy supplies are needed to fuel Africa’s development and fight against poverty. Yet the 
proportion of its people still dependent on traditional, inefficient and polluting energy sources is 
higher than on any other continent (World Energy Council 2005).1 

 As a member of the Southern African Power pool (SAPP), Zambia has a great potential 
to play a pivotal role in the regional power market by increasing its power generation capacity 
and transmission infrastructure including regional interconnectors. The growing demand for 
electricity at both domestic and regional levels, and the regional power shortages in the foreseeable 
future provide a solid market for any additional electricity supply that can be offered. To make trade 
expansion possible, significant additional investments would be required within SAPP and the 
heaviest transmission investments would need to be made in Zambia (7,526 MW), the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (5,984 MW), and Zimbabwe (3,072 MW). These three countries have the onus of 
developing 70 percent of the total required interconnection capacity for the power pool (World Bank 
2011). 2 Therefore regional interconnectors such as the Zimbabwe-Zambia-Botswana-Namibia and 
the Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya interconnectors could help Zambia become a regional hub for power 
trade in southern and eastern Africa.  

Ongoing interventions on regional integration in Zambia have mostly been in the 
Energy sector.  In 2004, the Bank approved the Southern Africa Power project for US$ 560.7 
million between Zambia and DRC (a total of US$ 1.1 for Zambia, closing FY16) to facilitate further 
development of an efficient power market in the SADC region. In 2012 the Zambia Kafue- Town-
Muzuma-Victoria Falls Regional Transmission Line Reinforcement project was approved for a total 
of US$ 60 million. This is meant to improve electricity availability and reliability of supply by 
supporting the reinforcement of the existing transmission network, increasing ZESCO’s power 
transfer capacity to the southern part of the country and reducing the high level of technical losses in 
the network.

 Agriculture:  As part of the World Bank’s support to agricultural research and 
development in the region, an Agricultural Productivity Program for Southern Africa 
(APPSA) is being prepared. It involves Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia for a total of US$ 90 
million (US$ 30 million per country, approval FY13). The project is expected to strengthen regional 
approaches to agricultural technology generation and dissemination by establishing regional centers 
of research leadership (RCoLs) on programs of regional importance. Under APPSA countries would 
work together in a number of different ways: (i) by undertaking joint technology generation, 
dissemination, and training activities; (ii) by coordinating their respective national activities to 
achieve a shared regional objective; and (iii) by sharing knowledge and technological outputs from 
their national programs throughout the region.  To the extent possible, APPSA implementation will 
rely on existing regional platforms, networks, and partnerships to share information and create 
opportunities for collaboration. 

Environment and Natural Resource Management: 
 The Regional Sustainable 
Management of Nyika Transfrontier Conservation Area project being jointly implemented 
with Malawi is financed by two regional trust funds. It is expected to contribute to sustainable 
management of biodiversity in the conservation area while strengthening the ability of community 
members living in the Chama district to enter the economic mainstream by leveraging tourism 
opportunities and improve farming practices through conservation farming.   

2. Regional Programs 

Water Resource Management:  The Bank is supporting the implementation of the 
Zambezi River Basin Development Program to be financed through the Multi-Donor Trust 
Fund for Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA). This program will finance a 
series of activities in the Zambezi River basin over 10 to 15 years to support the objectives of the 
Zambezi Watercourse Commission (ZAMCOM) Agreement, promoting equitable and reasonable 
utilization of the water resources of the Zambezi as well as the efficient management and sustainable 
development thereof. The program is envisaged as a series of three potential projects. The first 
project is designed to provide support over three years under six component that include three 
supporting the Zambezi Watercourse Commission, two supporting the Zambezi River Authority and 
a Bank executed analytical component using a programmatic approach aligned to the overall 
objectives of the project.  

Transport Policy: The Sub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP).  Zambia 
is among six countries that are participating in the SSATP's Transport Sector Policy Performance 
Review. The extent of transport sector policy reforms undertaken by African governments and 
regional economic communities in the last two decades has been significant. The reforms have 
focused on aspects aimed at enhancing transport sector impact, efficiency, and sustainability and 
included the integration of transport policy and national economic growth and poverty reduction 
policies; setting up road funds; creating road management agencies; concessioning railway 
operations; liberalizing port operations and concessioning container terminals; setting up one-stop 
border post operations; and harmonization of regional and national transport regulations. These 
policy reforms, championed by the SSATP, have led to improved infrastructure and related services. 
Due to the continuing global and regional changes, which place peculiar challenges to transport 
infrastructure and services, it has been found expedient to review the transport sector policy 
performance in Africa by assessing in detail how some countries performed. The first phase of six 
countries will be followed by a second phase that will assess the performance of twelve other 

81 

 
 
 
 
 
 
countries. The objectives of the review is to  demonstrate and advocate the contribution of transport 
to economic growth and poverty reduction, identify and propagate good practice,  identify potential 
solutions for sustaining monitoring systems and to meet specific national and regional demands. 
Zambia was selected together with five other countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Gabon and 
Benin) for the review. The outcome would inform SSATP's future dialogue with the countries and 
also help countries identify specific sector policy adjustments. The work will be funded entirely 
through SSATP.  

Road Safety: Zambia will be part of the ongoing SSATP’s activities aimed at assisting 
countries achieve the UN Decade of Action for road safety through the adoption of the African 
Road Safety Action Plan 2011-2020. Worldwide, the number of people killed in road traffic crashes 
each year is estimated at almost 1.2 million, while the number injured could be as high as 50 million. 
Road crashes are estimated to cost between 1 and 3% of GDP worldwide, and in Sub Saharan Africa, 
they amount to about US$10 billion per year, more than the sum of all Official Development Aid 
(ODA) dedicated to Infrastructure. Overall, Africa has fatality rates per capita higher than those of 
other regions and rates per vehicles are even more out of line, by a factor of 10 or up to 100, when 
compared to those of well performing economies.  Africa road crash casualties are estimated to be 
around 322,000 per year, and with no change in performance, they are forecast to grow to 540,000. 
SSATP member countries recognize the need for action and have proclaimed their support to the UN 
Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, which aims at stabilizing and then reducing the 
number of road fatalities before 2020. In 2011, UNECA facilitated the preparation of a joint African 
Action Plan for the Decade of Action, which would guide national authorities to prepare their own 
country specific action plans. In recognition of the demand for road safety improvements, and to 
support the above initiatives, the SSATP has created the Road Safety Program to facilitate the 
development of sound road safety policies, institutional reforms and road safety pilot programs in its 
member states.  The Road Safety Program is a cross-cutting issue in SSATP Development Program 2 
(DP2) whose objectives are to support  the: (i) establishment of road safety lead agencies in countries 
where none exist; (ii) preparation of country specific road safety action plans where none exist;  and 
(iii) identification of high-impact road safety policy and practical interventions. The program will be 
funded out of SSATP resources.  

Transport Sector Data Management and improving M&E functions:  Zambia will benefit 
from SSATP's ongoing collaboration with member countries on data management and M&E. 
Management of transport sector data in Africa still remains a major challenge and one of the results 
of this shortcoming is weak M&E systems.  Data collection is not well harmonized across countries 
and this hampers comparability of achievements. The lack of standardized reliable data, particularly 
in transport, is a critical limitation to policy modernization and large-scale infrastructure investment. 
It limits sector analysis and gap identification, and it impedes economic and financial packaging of 
large bankable investment programs. The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD) 
addressed these issues. This study of the infrastructure in Africa was launched as a result of the 2005 
G-8 Summit at Gleneagles, to collect detailed economic and technical data in the infrastructure 
sectors in Africa— especially transport—while at the same time building a sustainable knowledge 
instrument and delivering it for management by African development institutions. The study was 
commissioned by the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA), and implemented by the World 
Bank on behalf of a steering committee representing the AU, New Partnership for Africa’s 
Development (NEPAD), Regional Economic Communities (RECs), the AfDB and major 
infrastructure donors. SSATP will continue to provide technical support on transport data collection 
and analysis to the Africa Infrastructure Knowledge Program (AIKP), the Africa Infrastructure 

82 

 
 
  
 
Knowledge Partnership— located in the African Development Bank—an offshoot of the AICD 
study. 

In Zambia, some stakeholders— such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern 
Africa (COMESA) and the Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (ZIPAR)—have 
sought partnership with SSATP to enhance their data management capacities. There will be growing 
demand for these services— and AIKP and SSATP will organize their cooperation for best synergy. 
Some initial capacity building work has already started in Zambia, at the Ministry responsible for 
Transport. A national institutional capacity assessment has already been carried out and it proposes 
new institutional arrangements for data management systems as well as development of a sustainable 
implementation plan. It also provided advice on the initial systems set up and prepared a TOR for the 
next phase. Some of the costs of this initiative, especially capacity building in M&E would be co-
funded from the ongoing IDA transport project.   

Governance in Transport: Zambia, together with Kenya and Cameroon, will participate 
as a pilot country in which tools for assessing sector governance will be refined. Good 
governance is a concern to transport sector policy makers and stakeholders.  The sector has a major 
contribution to make towards poverty reduction and economic growth and billions of dollars have 
been spent on improving and rehabilitating transport infrastructure. However, despite this 
considerable investment and much associated effort to build supportive technical, financial and 
management capability, performance continues to lag behind expectation.  “Poor governance” is 
often cited as an underlying reason, the concept encompassing a range of shortcomings from weak 
leadership to outright corruption.  Several studies have also shown that the quality of governance 
significantly affects the quality of public transport infrastructure and unit costs of works. A study 
carried out by SSATP in 2011 on selected countries in Africa proposed a set of ten indicators that 
could be used to assess country performance on governance in the sector. SSATP wishes to 
implement the report’s recommendations and discussions are ongoing to obtain funding from such 
sources as the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF). The objective of the next immediate activity 
would be to: (a) refine indicators and scoring system based on feedback; (b) score the three pilot 
countries; (c) formalize scoring methodology and guidance; (d) develop a simple methodology for 
institutional mapping; (e) prepare briefing papers and communication tools for roll-out; and (f) 
conduct a robust impact assessment to evaluate changes in governance scores as they relate to 
transport sector performance improvement.

Annex 15: Client Survey and CPS consultations 

CPS Consultations  
          On March 29, 2012 the World Bank officially launched the 
consultation process for the Zambia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) in 
Lusaka. This was officially launched by the Vice President of the Republic 
of Zambia, Dr. Guy Scott.  From March to October 2012 the World Bank 
consulted with stakeholders in Lusaka, the Copperbelt, and Solwezi. The 
stakeholders included: government officials, civil society organizations, 
NGOs, academia, private sector, youth, traditional leaders and other 
cooperating partners. Agriculture was emphasized as the most important 
sector for support from the Bank throughout the consultation process. Not 
only was agriculture described as the major engine of economic growth it 
was noted that the sector directly improves the livelihood of the majority of 
Zambians because of its ability to employ a large number of people.  

World Bank Client Survey  
           In May and June 2012, 553 stakeholders of the World Bank in 
Zambia were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to 
the country by participating in a country survey.  Participants in the survey 
were drawn from among 
the offices of 
the President, Ministers,  
Parliamentarians, ministerial departments, consultants/contractors working 
on World Bank supported projects/programs, project management units 
(PMUs), local government officials, bilateral and  multilateral agencies, 
private sector organizations, the financial sector, NGOs, community- based 
organizations, the media, trade unions, faith-based groups, academia, 
research institutes, the judiciary branch, and local citizens.  A total of 312 
stakeholders participated in the country survey (56 percent). 

          In developing the CPS further the consultations were taken on a much 
more technical level with the government in order to develop a CPS that 
represents the countries development priorities. The government emphasized 
that the strategy should have projects that support investment in rural areas 
to increase employment and reduce poverty. The government stakeholders 
also noted that the CPS should carry on some of the programs from the CAS 
with focus towards infrastructure (energy & health), agriculture and 
education sector. In addition, they also noted that there is need for a 
deliberate effort to foster a competitive mind-set among citizens with change 
in belief and attitudes by stakeholders, confidence and belief in the private 
sector. 
         The youth representatives highlighted concrete steps that need to be 
taken to ensure that there is real and sustained investment in supporting the 
development of, and creation of jobs for young people in Zambia. The 
representatives identified key growth areas and among these was agriculture. 
They also encouraged the Bank to offer support on access to finance and 
financial literacy advancement among the youth.  
      Civil society organizations observed that the Bank has been a consistent 
development partner for Zambia and urged the institution to keep four issues 
in mind as it moves forward with the preparation of the new CPS: the World 

           The purpose of the client survey was to assist the World Bank in 
gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Zambia perceive the 
Bank; obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders regarding: the general 
environment in Zambia; their perceived overall value of the World Bank in 
Zambia; overall impressions of the World Bank as related to poverty 
reduction, personal 
relationships, 
effectiveness, knowledge base, 
collaboration, and day-to-day business operations; perceptions of the World 
Bank’s future role in Zambia; and perceptions of the World Bank’s 
communication and outreach in Zambia.  
           The survey revealed that in a number of areas, perceptions of the 
Bank’s work and effectiveness have improved since the FY 07 Country 
Survey.  At the same time there are areas of opportunity for the Bank in 
terms of its emphasis, future focus, outreach, knowledge and results. The 
survey also revealed that the development priorities of stakeholders in 
Zambia appear to have shifted since the last FY 07 Country Survey.  
Whereas then, HIV/AIDS, education and governance were identified as top 
priorities, the agriculture and rural sectors are now of particular importance 
in terms of poverty reduction and growth, as are education and job creation.  
The stakeholders would like to see the Bank focus its resources primarily in 
the agriculture sector, infrastructure development and education.  Poverty

Bank should be proactive in bettering the lives of the poor even though 
Zambia has been re-classified as a lower middle income country; it should 
support diversification of the economy; it should support the country’s 
agenda for job creation; and it should increase interaction and consultation 
with civil society.  
            Private sector representatives from the mining sector noted the 
difficult business environment due to high taxation, loyalties, duties, 
statutory 
instruments 
that are not favorable. They emphasized 
the 
importance of consistent policy messages from the Government in 
influencing the business environment.  The representatives also looked at 
promoting private sector and SME development to create jobs. They 
recommended that the Bank should use its global knowledge to advise the 
government on policies that will help to achieve these. 

reduction emerged as an area for greater Bank emphasis, and a top 
development priority. 
           The survey rated World Bank’s overall effectiveness as 6 on a 10 
point scale. Respondents in 2012 gave significantly higher ratings for 
Bank’s effectiveness in poverty reduction, gender, health and public sector 
reform compared to respondents in the 2007 and 2004 surveys. However, 
the World Bank has significantly lower ratings in comparison to earlier 
years for effectiveness at anti-corruption, 
law and 
justice, basic 
infrastructure, domestic private sector development and social protection. 
Respondents in 2012 also had significantly higher levels of agreement that 
the Bank plays a relevant role in Zambia’s development, that the programs 
and strategies the Bank supports are realistic for Zambia, and that the Bank 
treats clients and stakeholders in Zambia with respect compared to 
respondents in the 2007 and 2004 surveys. 
          Respondents indicated that the Bank’s greatest weakness in its work 
in Zambia was being too influenced by developed countries. Other 
weaknesses noted were: the Bank was too bureaucratic in its operational 
policies and procedures; it imposed technocratic solutions without regard to 
political realities; and it did not collaborate enough with non-state actors. 
Nearly half of all respondents indicated that the World Bank should reduce 
the complexity of obtaining financing to make itself of greater value in 
Zambia and nearly 40 percent noted that the Bank should improve the 
quality of 
its experts as related 
to Zambia’s specific challenges. 
Respondents also indicated that the World Bank should work more closely 
with local governments, the private sector, NGOs and beneficiaries to 
ensure better development results in Zambia.  
       The survey revealed that the stakeholders have mixed views on the 
Bank’s knowledge and the majority identifies financial resources as the 
Bank’s greatest value. The stakeholder’s views of the Bank’s collaboration 
with the government and with other donors have improved profoundly sine 
the FY07 survey.

Annex 16: Gender Integration in Projects 

The integration of gender objectives and indicators into the CPS and its results framework is 
one of the most effective ways to maximize the accountability of the Bank for achieving gender 
outcomes and the ability to highlight and learn from these outcomes. The integration of gender into 
the CPS is in line with the World Bank’s current corporate strategy on gender integration. The 
inclusion of gender as a specific theme of the recent IDA16 replenishment has resulted in a push to 
integrate gender into all CPSs. 

A gender portfolio review was conducted for Zambia to feed into the new CPS mainly 
focusing on the 8 on-going IDA projects3.  The review found that 100 percent of the IDA portfolio is 
gender informed in at least one of the following dimensions: (1) analysis; (2) actions; (3) M&E. 
Health and agriculture projects however, had better gender integration compared to the others. With 
100 percent of IDA projects rated as gender informed, the portfolio is currently above the IDA16 
target of 60 percent. The assessment also  found that overall, the portfolio is supporting among others 
the following gender related outcomes: improved health (including maternal health) for urban and 
rural women; increased access to basic social services and infrastructure for rural and urban women 
(including gender-sensitive sanitation, water, and roads); improved knowledge of the gender 
dimensions of poverty in Zambia and of the gender-related benefits of malaria interventions; 
improved agricultural productivity,  market access for female smallholder farmers; improved 
responsiveness /accountability of governance to both women and men. However, challenges still 
remain, particularly with regard to reducing maternal mortality, improving access to safe water and 
sanitation, reducing gender inequalities in secondary education, improving women’s access to 
agricultural inputs and providing other avenues that can allow women to better benefit from 
economic growth that has in the past tended to be weak in terms of job creation.  

The vision of the 2013-CPS is to maintain the current level of 100 percent of IDA projects in 
the country portfolio rated as gender informed and to further strengthen gender integration for Trust 
Fund and AAA. The CPS will further deepen attention to gender to go beyond the simple fulfillment 
of the IDA16 target, especially by focusing on improvements in four key areas: (1) increasing 
attention to gender in M&E frameworks; (2) increasing the integration of gender into current AAA 
work; (3) increasing the proportion of operations that use existing gender diagnostics and analytical 
work to inform their design; (4) improving the integration of gender in infrastructure work to ensure 
women’s greater participation and greater share in sector benefits. The Irrigation Development and 
Support Project that was approved in FY11 took into account many of these aspects (see Box below). 

3 The focus of the review is on IDA because the World Bank’s corporate targets and guidelines on the integration of gender are 
specific to IDA projects (i.e. not including AAA or Trust Funds).

Box: Gender and the Irrigation Development and Support Project 

       The project was informed by a substantial amount of analytical work in gender and agriculture 
including: the Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook, the TF ESSD Gender support  project; and the 
Gender Action Plan-funded study on the Role of Gender in Irrigation Development. While the project 
indicates that the latter of these informed the design of the M&E system, the current results 
framework does not include any sex-disaggregated indicators beyond the obligatory project 
beneficiaries disaggregated by sex. However, discussions with the project task team indicate that the 
project does intend to sex-disaggregate many of the indicators currently listed in the results-
framework. Additionally, there will be a gender dimension to the user satisfaction and impact 
assessments, which should generate interesting results on the gender-distribution of project benefits. 
The project has also been informed from a gender perspective by an Institutional assessment of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and by continuous focus group discussions, which led to 
the creation of mechanisms to improve women’s access to potential benefits. The project has also 
benefited from additional trust fund financing via the Nordic Trust Fund (OPCS) for a study on 
women’s land ownership and compensation to investigate the impact of different land ownership 
practices on the ability of women to benefit from the ISDP’s objectives. 
       IDSP is aiming for a minimum quota of one third of beneficiaries to be women and the project’s 
actions specifically target women farmers and entrepreneurs in a number of ways: (1) there is a 
special window under the Investment Support Fund (ISF) for women and other vulnerable groups to 
support investments including in job and business skills training and in developing women’s business 
plans, and the project will encourage women to take advantage of this window via social marketing 
campaigns; (2) the project plans to use a participatory approach to land use planning and to ensure 
equal access of men and women to irrigated land; (3) women will have preferential access to group 
and individual training events. In terms of specific mechanisms for ensuring effective female 
participation in the project, a project-specific gender action plan was developed. This includes, inter 
alia, a requirement for gender competency and expertise to be included in the TORs for community 
mobilization. Significantly, men in project sites have also been sensitized to the emerging issues – the 
inclusion of men in gender mainstreaming efforts is often overlooked, so it is encouraging to see this 
avenue being pursued by the project. Men’s active engagement in gender issues on the project is 
reflected in the assertion by men during a men’s focus group session on the importance of including 
women in the project’s decision making processes.

Indicator revised and 2008 score not directly comparable. High variance, broadly unchanged 

Very marginal decline in performance (-5.5 %) in 2010 n 

Performance appears to have diminished, with end-year stock of payments arrears increasing 
sharply to 4.3 percent of primary expenditure in 2011 from 1.8 percent in 2009, particularly in the 
areas of Personnel Emoluments, Recurrent Departmental Charges and utility bills. These figures 
exclude pension arrears, data on which have not yet been provided to the team. 

Performance changes  

No change in performance; the rating in the 2008 assessment appears too high. The 
classification system indicates the purpose of expenditure, but in a non-transparent way.  
Four out of the nine benchmarks are met. The 7th benchmark is not met, as only revised revenue 
outturns are shown. The reason for the change in ratings may be the preparation of the budget 
earlier in the year, at which time revised expenditure estimates, may not be available. 
The accessibility of budget reporting has improved with the introduction of a Financial Report 
narrative summary, which makes budget performance more easily understood. Information is 
awaited on the situation in 2011; the Financial Report for 2011 had not been finalized at the time 
of the assessment team’s visit 
Improvement in performance due to change in budget calendar so that central govt. budget is 
approved before end of the year, so that Councils have more certain information on grants they will 
receive. 

No change in performance. Still no consolidated report on fiscal risk 

Timeliness in publishing reports has slipped somewhat, partly due to MoFNP not keeping its

Annex 18: Connecting the Non-State Actors with the State to Contribute to Greater 
Development Impact: Approach and Tools  

Traditionally, the Bank has focused on working primarily with state actors and 
institutions (the “supply-side”) in its attempt to support development and public-management 
reform around the world. But in the past decade, there has been a realization that interaction with 
state actors is not sufficient in and of itself to bring development, since it tends to assume, rather 
optimistically, that governments both want and need help to deliver development honestly and 
effectively. Development practitioners have increasingly shifted to a focus on engaging citizens, civil 
society and other non -state actors (the “demand side”) in holding government to account for their 
actions 4.  

This shift to reforms that stimulate demand is a welcome one, though the approach 
needs to go beyond simplistic oppositions between supply and demand; The demand-side 
approach has risked reproducing the simplistic assumptions of the supply approach in that it 
implicitly assumes that citizens have an uncomplicated and clear motivation to hold government to 
account for their performance. A number of recent studies and the Bank’s own evaluations have 
demonstrated that the theoretical separation between supply and demand actors can be a hindrance, in 
that it unhelpfully presents Africa’s governance challenges as being fundamentally about one set of 
actors (non-state) getting another set of actors (state) to behave better. In reality, governance 
challenges are fundamentally about getting both state and non-state actors to find ways of acting 
collectively in their own best interests.  

Instead of focusing on separate supply and demand side interventions, more must be 
done to focus on the linkages between the two. User demand is seldom a sufficient factor for 
improving service delivery. Studies show that in the absence of top down performance pressures and 
institutional coherence, bottom-up demand tends to have little impact. In other words a more holistic 
approach is needed. Since our recent evaluations indicate that governance challenges are 
fundamentally about getting both state and non-state actors to find ways of acting collectively in their 
own best interests, far more must be done in bringing these actors together. The Bank’s focus during 
this CPS period will be on facilitating constructive relationships among providers and users based on 
a detailed appreciation of barriers to behavior change in specific local settings.  

This CPS shall ensure enhanced attention to communication and dissemination of Bank 
data and analysis amongst varied stakeholders. Too often Bank product dissemination starts and 
ends with the specific government institution that the work addresses. Given that our technical 
reforms often fail because of a lack of broader public support or awareness, this is clearly a missed 
opportunity. Much more will be done during this CPS period to ensure that Bank research, evidence 
papers, economic briefs etc. are transmitted to a broad mix of stakeholders (including think tanks, 
youth organisations, media, parliamentarians, civil society and academia). What’s more, in contrast 
to the traditional dissemination approach which focuses primarily on putting the information out 
there, the approach going forward will be to engender ownership and mobilisation around the work. 
This means organising more debates instead of press conferences and being willing to allow and 
facilitate the use of World Bank data in forums that are not controlled by the Bank itself. It also

means proactively bringing together a vast mix of stakeholders to discuss the implications of the 
work amongst themselves. 

The World Bank shall utilised ICT to enhance dialogue between state and non-state 
actors as well as between project teams and project beneficiaries. ICT has a great but largely 
untested potential to help disseminate information and enhance dialogue across project stakeholders. 
In the CPS period, the Bank shall proactively seek to better exploit the potential of ICT. In 
collaboration with WBI we shall pilot an ICT solution (utilising on online mapping platform and 
mobile text) that enables project teams to better engage with beneficiaries in a two-way conversation 
about effectiveness of the project.  

The World Bank had held entrepreneurship training for the youth in preparation for 
the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) forum held in Zambia in 2011; the 
participation of the youth in the forum led to the formation of a Business young professionals 
association in Zambia and in Southern Africa region. As a result of this training provided by the 
Bank a desk has been established for young professionals by AGOA.  

As part of the Pilot Project for Climate Resilience (PPCR), Zambian youth were 
introduced and trained in new ICT approaches and technologies to integrate climate risk 
management into regional planning and to promote the importance of addressing climate change 
risks from national to local levels. 

Media shall be treated as a key partner and target for reform. Media is the gatekeeper of 
public opinion in Zambia. It is the “agora” in which debates are had and opinions formed. As such, it 
is a critical arena that the Bank can utilise in bringing together diverse voices across the state, non-
state actor divide. Already the Bank has been undertaking pilot activities with community radio – 
funded by the GPF -  that are aimed at using radio as the channel via which flows of information are 
enhanced amongst these groups. The Bank has also been actively supporting the enhancement of 
investigative journalism skills in Zambia. But much more can be done. During the CPS period there 
shall be a specific focus on enhancing the capacity of the media to act as a credible provider of 
information and a site for inclusive dialogue. This will include continued development of strong 
partnerships with reform-minded media institutions and media individuals via the GPF. The new 
Anti-Corruption Fund will also be utilized to support media projects that seek to increase the quality 
of information and debate in the public sphere. 

The Bank needs to go beyond “the usual suspects”. Civil society in Zambia is dominated 
by a few core organisations that are largely over-burdened with donor demand. The Bank will need 
to go beyond these usual suspects as it seeks to engage non-state actors in its own projects and to 
enhance their ability to engage with government. In particular, this CPS will focus on building 
capacity of rural organisations, community radios and community-based associations. There shall 
also be a greater emphasis on women and youth organisations. Parliamentarians are another set of 
actors that the Bank shall be seeking greater engagement with, particularly in mobilizing opinion 
around key Bank knowledge products. Of course, in deciding to engage beyond the typical donor-
funded organisations, there are likely to be greater transaction costs for the Bank as well as a need for 
Bank staff to be both relational and locally immersed. The new Anti-corruption fund will be 
implemented and staffed with these principles in mind. 

93 

 
 
 
The Bank shall continue with measures that seek to facilitate the creation of locally-
anchored solutions to collective action problems. During the past CPS, the Bank began facilitating 
constructive dialogues across stakeholders around reform that related to extractives industries, 
procurement and on access to information. Though there has been some success with these initial 
endeavours, they still tend to suffer from too much of a heavy Bank hand when it comes to agreeing 
on solutions. In the upcoming CPS, the approach shall increasingly be to operate “at arm’s length” 
with these initiatives, by utilising credible, locally immersed intermediaries who also have a detailed 
appreciation of barriers to behavior change in specific local settings.   

The Bank needs to ensure that it facilitates the development of locally-relevant solutions 
to problems of collective action: Sometimes the mechanical application of donor-inspired policy 
guidelines by sector ministries results in additional policy incoherence and prevents local actors 
coming together to provide their own solutions. The Bank shall endeavour to avoid this possibility by 
ensuring that we do not sweep aside pre-existing institutions, regardless of their potential to 
contribute to reform efforts. Successful reforms need to draw on what is right and proper in existing 
local cultural systems. The emphasis shall be on adapting rather than supplanting existing practices, 
thus creating “practical hybrids”. The new Anti-Corruption Fund, which has as one of its objectives 
“to strengthen innovation and capacity within supply side integrity institutions/ structures”, shall 
retain this lesson as an underlying principle.

Executive Summary 

i. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report for Zambia (CASCR) takes stock of the 
effectiveness of the FY08 CAS and draws lessons for the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 
2013-2016. The FY08 CAS, which was developed in close partnership with the Government and 
other stakeholders, supported Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP 2006-10) through 
four pillars: (i) macro-economic and expenditure management; (ii) 
institutional capacity 
enhancement; (iii) infrastructure development; and (iv) human capital development.  

ii. 
Although the CAS was aligned with the Government plan, it was not selective in the areas 
chosen for support. The scope of the Bank Group program was ambitious in relations to allocated 
time, resources, and available capacity. In addition to the four pillars, the CAS design called for two 
cross cutting themes (governance and HIV/AIDS) and covered 11 sectors each with several 
objectives. This in turn led to a proliferation of CAS outcome indicators (totaling 23) and milestones 
(39). The CAS Progress Report dropped some milestones, revised four indicators, and dropped one. 

iii. 
There was a consistent decline in IDA disbursements to Zambia during the CAS period, 
when the rate dropped from about 29% in FY08 to 18% in FY11 and further to about 11% in FY12. 
Disbursements have however, picked up significantly in the last six months as the CMU has worked 
with the task teams and the Government to address bottlenecks.  

iv. 
Within the Bank's relatively small assistance program, the share of budget support (PRSCs) 
in total IDA disbursements was substantial, exceeding the envisaged CAS range of 15-20%. The 
PRSCs, in conjunction with many development partners, addressed energy, private sector, and public 
sector reforms. In terms of non-lending activities, the Bank supported several capacity building 
activities and produced a number of analytical pieces that informed policies in key sectors. 

v. 
The CASCR rates both overall program and Bank performance under the CAS as moderately 
satisfactory. Of the 23 CAS outcome indicators, 10 were achieved, 8 were partially achieved, and 5 
were not achieved. The CAS was relevant and consonant with Government priorities. Achievements 
include improving macroeconomic and expenditure management, increasing access to roads and 
electricity, reducing under-five child deaths due to malaria, and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS.  
There was also progress towards strengthening public financial management, improving public 
management and transparency of mining and natural resources, enhancing access to water, 
strengthening vocational training, and improving the business environment  (IFC and MIGA support 
was also relevant with respect to the last). But challenges remain in these areas. While agriculture 
productivity did not improve during the CAS period, the strategic focus of the Bank program shifted 
towards the agriculture sector, through the design and preparation of critical interventions in 
irrigation, livestock and agriculture research laying the basis for achievements under the next CAS in 
this area. The analytical and advisory activities undertaken by the Bank were also relevant, of high 
quality and helped the Bank carry out its strategy.  The CAS was a results-based one, but the Bank, 
in some cases, did not pay adequate attention to the development of realistic and monitorable 
indicators.  The weak results framework was corrected only during the CAS Progress Report. 
Implementation of on-going projects proceeded slowly, primarily because of ambitious design 
relative to existing capacity, but the outcome of completed projects was mostly moderately 
satisfactory. The Bank managed to maintain a dialogue with the Government and donors and having 
an office in Lusaka has helped. The Bank collaboration with other cooperating partners helped 
leverage additional donor resources and strengthen prospects for reforms.   

99 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
vi. 
Zambia's progress has been mixed in implementing reforms needed to achieve country-level 
goals. The Government has overseen and implemented sound macroeconomic policies. But the 
strong economic growth of the past decade has not yet translated into substantial reduction of 
poverty, especially in rural areas. Income inequity is high and the urban-rural divide is wide.    

vii. 
Several lessons have been learnt from implementation of the FY08 CAS, and which have 
been taken into account in the preparation of the new CPS. These include the following: (i) the CPS 
needs to be more realistic in its strategic objectives and consistent with allocated time and resources, 
and available capacity; (ii) simplification of project design in future operations is critical to avoid 
implementation delays; (iii) the need for a sound CPS results matrix that clearly shows the link 
between projects/AAA and outcomes; (iv) adopting a low risk piloting approach to major reforms; 
and  (v) pursuing an approach of "incremental progress" that involved the Bank staying the course in 
a particular policy area and addressing the same or closely related issues in that area with successive 
analytical work or lending operations, but each time incrementally and patiently introducing 
additional measures until more complete progress was achieved over time.

Introduction 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the implementation of 
the Zambia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY08-11) discussed by the Board on April 8, 2008.It 
draws lessons for the preparation of the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Where appropriate—
i.e., in areas where there is a high degree of continuity between activities under the FY08 CAS and 
previous CASs (e.g., improving public sector management and enabling business environment)—the 
review takes a medium-term look at the impact of Bank assistance.   

2. 
The CASCR draws on several key reports, most notably the CAS Progress Report (CASPR, 
Nov. 2011), project completion reports, ISRs, as well as independent evaluations and studies. The 
CASPR, which was discussed in-depth with the Government, Parliament and other stakeholders, also 
made adjustments to the strategy based on realities on the ground. It recommended extending the CAS 
period to the end of CY2012 to pave the way for engaging the newly elected Government in the 
preparation of the new strategy. Based on implementation progress and available data, the CAS 
indicators were also revised.  These changes have been taken into account in the CASCR’s assessment 
of the Bank’s performance in Zambia. 

3. 
The remainder of the report is structured as follows. Section II provides an overview of the CAS 
relevance, examining the alignment between the CAS design and the objectives of the Government 
program. Sections III reviews progress towards achievement of CAS objectives. Section IV analyses the 
Bank’s performance and its role in supporting observed progress towards these objectives. The last 
section draws lessons learned for subsequent CPS design.  

II.  

Relevance: National Development Priorities and Alignments to the CAS Objectives  

4. 
An overarching context of stable politics and sound macroeconomic fundamentals but reliant 
on mining. Zambia has a long history of political stability and in the last election in September 2011 
there was a peaceful change of regime with the opposition party (the Patriotic Front) coming to power 
after 20 years of rule by the Movement for Multiparty Democracy. Mining remains the backbone of the 
country's economy. Economic growth, that averaged 5.7 % annually in the last decade, was driven by a 
combination of prudent macroeconomic management, market liberalization as well as high international 
copper prices, increased copper production, a bumper maize harvest, and a boom in the construction 
sector. However, despite favorable growth, poverty and income inequality have remained stubbornly 
high and the urban-rural divide remains large. Sustaining growth and ensuring that the majority of the 
population can benefit from this growth remain Zambia’s central development challenges. The new 
Government has put emphasis on re-orienting policies towards more inclusive economic growth, 
employment generation and poverty reduction.   

5. 
Zambia’s long-term development objectives are articulated in the National Vision 2030, which 
projects Zambia attaining a prosperous middle-income country status by 2030, through developing 
infrastructure and human resources to stimulate wealth and jobs.  The development strategy to achieve 
the Vision’s objectives has been elaborated in a series of medium-term national development plans. The 
Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP 2006-2010)—the first in the series of these plans 
acknowledges that the linkage between growth and poverty reduction has been weak, as growth has 
been narrowly driven by a few sectors. While the FNDP recognizes the importance of continued 
contributions of the mining, construction, and energy sectors to overall growth, it advocates a major 
shift in emphasis towards rural development, agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing that might have 
greater pro-poor impact through increased employment and income opportunities. Agriculture is a key 

101 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
economic sector, providing employment to three-quarters of the workforce, and contributing about 10% 
of GDP and some 10 % of export. The Plan emphasizes four priorities/themes as follows: (i) sustaining 
fiscal and financial stability and deepening structural reforms; (ii) supporting governance, institutional 
capacity, the business environment and agricultural development, (iii) enhancing public infrastructure; 
and (iv) improving health performance, education and skills training. In addition, it highlights several 
cross-cutting issues, such as governance, HIV/AIDS, environment, and gender. The plan had strong 
Government ownership and was prepared through a robust participatory process involving diverse 
stakeholders from throughout Zambian society.   

6. 
In turn, the CAS FY08-11, developed in close partnership with Government and other 
stakeholders, was fully aligned with the FNDP. Support was organized around four pillars: (i) 
macroeconomic and expenditure management; 
(ii) 
institutional capacity enhancement; 
(iii) 
infrastructure development; and (iv) human capital development. Improved governance was interwoven 
throughout the CAS program through a governance filter that emphasized smart project design to 
achieve transparency, participation, and third party monitoring; outreach to stakeholders and proactive 
supervision during project implementation; and synergies between Bank operations to contribute to 
strengthening of country systems. It was recognized that better governance is essentially a longer-term 
activity, likely exceeding the CAS period by several years. The importance of the issue however, 
justified its inclusion in the CAS even in the absence of specified end-outcomes by the end of the CAS 
period. Similarly, mainstreaming HIV measures into all operations was planned. 

7. 
Although the CAS program was aligned well with the Government plan, it was not selective. 
The CAS design called for four pillars, two cross cutting themes (governance and HIV/AIDS), and kept 
its focus fairly broad, covering 11 sectors (e.g. agriculture, mining, infrastructure, PFM, natural 
resources, business environment, health,  tourism, transport and education) each with several objectives. 
This in turn led to a proliferation of CAS outcome indicators (totaling 23) and milestones (39) as shown 
in Annex Tables 9 and 10. The scope of the Bank program was exceedingly ambitious, for the small 
time frame and limited IDA envelope, and in relation to Zambia’s weak institutional capacity-even 
acknowledging that some of the program activities were aimed at strengthening that capacity. The CAS 
design did not reflect the lessons of experience drawn from the previous CASCR that noted “future 
 8. 
CASs need to be more realistic in their strategic objectives and should be based on a careful review of 
past experience and political economy issues.” (2008 IEG CAS Review for the FY04-07 CAS).     
Although the Bank has had a relatively small role in providing financial assistance to 
Zambia, it provided a substantial program of analytical work and capacity building support. Net 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursements to Zambia as well as IDA disbursements have 
been declining since 2006.  ODA rapidly decreased from US$1.5 billion in 2006 (equivalent to 80% of 
government revenue) to US$914 million in 2010 (or 30% of government revenue).  IDA disbursements 
also declined, contributing, on average, some US$50 million per year or about 5% of total ODA 
disbursements during the review period. More than 50 development partners provide assistance to 
Zambia, including bilateral partners (Table 1).   IDA supported several capacity building activities and 
analytical work that informed policies in key sectors as discussed below (see also Annex Table 2).

9. 
Budget support has become important as a percentage of total aid. The share of ODA going to 
general budget support was 8% in 2006, while in 2010 it was 23% (equivalent to US$217 million or 7% 
of government revenue).  Similarly, within the Bank's relatively small assistance program, the share of 
budget support in total IDA disbursements is substantial exceeding the envisaged CAS range of 15-20%.   

10. 
The CAS included a results matrix with generally defined outcomes and milestones for each 
of the four pillars, however, the link between project/program outputs/outcomes and CAS outcomes 
were not always explicitly spelled out.  The outcomes and milestones identified in the CAS results 
matrix were drawn directly from the projects across the portfolio and were generally relevant to the 
country development context as outlined in paragraphs 4 and 5. However, the links between 
project/program outputs/outcomes and CAS outcomes were not always explicitly spelled out and this 
was partly because the links between outputs and outcomes were not clearly specified in the projects. As 
such the selection of outcome indicators in some cases could not be clearly linked to the Bank 
interventions. For example, in the Technical Education Vocational & Entrepreneurship Training 
Development Program Support (TDP) results framework, improvements in the technical education 
system and enhanced training (outputs) were expected to result in raising graduate employments and 
speeding up the process of finding employment (outcomes). The outcome indicators neglected the 
important role of factors, such as the relatively strong growth of the economy during the period of 
program implementation, as well as whether the employed graduates were working in a field related to 
their training 5.In other cases there was no baseline survey undertaken to define the starting point of 
project activities such as in the Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS.   Further, no quantitative 
targets were specified for some indicators. For example, the CAS results framework noted that the 
baseline and target for the CAS outcome indicator of increased primary education completion rate 
would be assessed at the Fast Track Initiative (FTI) for education effectiveness date, which was delayed 
till FY11. Some CAS outcome indicators were also phrased in general terms, “GRZ put in place clear 
guidance for allocation of additional resource flows from mining”,  and were more focused on process 
(putting in place) than outcomes (gains from mining adequately used to support country’s development).  

11. 
The CAS matrix was revised by the CASPR. The CAS implementation experience suggested 
the need to streamline the number of indicators to be monitored and to ensure that the milestones and 
outcome indicators were better aligned with desired CAS goals. The CASPR involved a systematic 
effort to streamline the results matrix: a number of milestones were dropped (5 out of 39) and another 4 

5 The links between outputs and outcomes were however, clearly specified in the road, energy and malaria projects/programs.

milestones were revised.  Similarly a number of CAS outcomes indicators were revised (4 out of 23) and 
one was dropped (Annex Table 9 and CAS Progress Report Annex Table 4 provide details). 

III. Achievements of CAS Outcomes and Milestones 

12. 
Overall, the outcome of the Bank’s relatively small assistance program is rated moderately 
satisfactory. Nearly 43% of specified CAS outcomes having been fully achieved and another 35 percent 
partially achieved (Annex Table 10).  Progress on the milestones - linked directly to Bank supported 
activities - has been higher, with 46% achieved, and another 41% on track to be achieved.  The 
outcomes achieved were in areas critical to the growth of the economy such as macroeconomic stability, 
infrastructure improvement and human capital development. There was also progress towards 
strengthening public financial management, improving public management and transparency of mining 
and natural resources, enhancing access to water, strengthening vocational training, and improving the 
business environment. While agricultural productivity did not improve under the CAS period the basis 
was laid for significant contribution from the World Bank during the next strategy period through the 
design and approval of critical interventions in irrigation, livestock sector development and agriculture 
research (the last through a regional agricultural productivity program (Annex Table 1). By the end of 
the CAS period support for the agriculture sector increased from being 10% to 36% of the portfolio (see 
figure below). Overall budget allocation (constant 2008 billon ZKW) to the agriculture sector also 
increased during the period 2008-12 (see more on this in para 17). The following sub-sections 
summarize progress made across the four CAS pillars.

Pillar I: Macroeconomic and Expenditure Management 

13. 
Zambia’s macroeconomic performance has been commendable when measured by aggregate 
indicators such as growth, inflation, balance of payments, external debt, and the budget balance. 
Transfers under the PRSC series—identified by the FY08-11 CAS as the primary vehicle to support the 
Bank’s macroeconomic and public expenditure management program—helped fund the budget, in turn 
contributing to stabilizing the real economy. As seven donors, including the Bank, have provided budget 
support to help stabilize the country (Table 1), the outcomes cited above are not necessarily attributable 
to the Bank6. Prior actions aimed at public expenditure management helped improve government 
capacity in these areas. In addition, the PRSC allowed the Bank to participate in the dialogue on 
macroeconomic management, even though the IMF took the lead. The external debt position of Zambia

Bank, and the African Development Bank.

also improved appreciably, largely due to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPIC) Initiative and 
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) arrangements. The economy also responded positively to 
reforms.  Maintaining annual growth that averaged 5.7% for a decade was a commendable achievement.   

14. 
Nevertheless, despite the positive performance of growth and overall macroeconomic 
achievements, a number of concerns have remained. First, the pace of growth has been fueled to a 
large extent by high international copper prices and the economy’s reliance on a single commodity 
export could expose it to severe external shocks if copper prices fall. In addition, growth has been driven 
by few sectors (e.g. mining and construction) and has not been inclusive. The labor-intensive rural 
economy has only experienced substantial growth in the last two years, because of good weather 
conditions rather than any structural increase in agricultural productivity. Listed as the third growth 
sector in the FNDP, tourism has also been stagnant during the CAS period. Long term sustainability of 
growth will require greater attention to economic diversification and improvement in agricultural 
productivity and competitiveness and tourism. 

15. 
Poverty did not decrease much and the already high income disparities widened further.  The 
2010 national incidence of poverty is 60%, not much different from the 62.8% in 2006.  With the 
majority of the population dependent on subsistence agriculture, rural poverty was at 78% in 2010, not 
much different from 80% in 2006.  Zambia’s Gini coefficient is now around 0.54, much higher than 
0.47 in 1996. Finally, growth has not translated into commensurate improvement in living standards, 
and Zambia’s rank in the Human Development Index for 2010 is 150 out of 169 countries. 

16. 
 Under this pillar the Bank also intended to help Zambia better manage its expenditure to 
support the inclusive growth agenda. The Bank identified three CAS outcome indicators: (i) public 
expenditure allocation to pro-poor sectors shows real increase from 2008; (ii) GRZ put in place clear 
guidelines for allocation of additional resource flows from mining; and (iii) budget presentation includes 
reporting on donor funding and revenues and expenditures of quasi-fiscal institutions. 

17. 
Public expenditure allocation to pro-poor sectors shows real increase (Achieved). Overall 
budget allocation (constant 2008 billon ZKW) to pro-poor sectors (agriculture, tourism and transport) 
increased during the period 2008-12 (Annex Table 12a)—the increase is reflected in agriculture and 
transport, while in relative terms, the tourism budget was halved. The share of transport increased from 
8.5% of the budget in 2008 to 16.8% in 2012 whereas that of agriculture increased only from 5.8% to 
6.1%. Tourism declined from 0.5% of the budget to 0.2% (Annex Table 12b). In terms of the CAS 
milestone, the Government carried out a mid-term review of the FNDP and presented the report to 
various stakeholders. Government held annual consultations through the life of the FNDP such as PRSC 
annual reviews with donors. 

18. 
GRZ put in place clear guidelines for allocation of additional resource flows from mining 
(Partially Achieved). Although the Government agreed to put in place an appropriate mechanism to 
harness mining flows (such as a sovereign wealth fund), the envisaged fund has not yet been established. 
However, staff from Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) undertook field visits to 
multiple countries to study sovereign wealth funds. On the positive side, a Mining Resource Account 
(MRA) was created in 2008 and mining revenues increased from 1.4% of GDP in 2008 to an estimated 
2.3% of GDP in 2012.  The Mining & Minerals Act was revised; audit of mining companies has 
commenced and reconciliation of mining taxes paid by the companies; and an audit program was 
undertaken by the Zambia Revenue Authority (meeting the CAS milestones).    

105 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
19. 
Budget presentation includes reporting on donor funding and revenues and expenditures of 
quasi-fiscal institutions (Achieved).  There has been improvement in the availability and quality of debt 
data. The records on external debt are complete, updated and reconciled semi-annually. 7 The records 
pertaining to all components of domestic debt stock are captured in a data base. Investment and Debt 
Management (IDM) is upgrading its Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) to the 
latest version (DMFAS 6.0), allowing both foreign and domestic debt to be centrally recorded. The 
quality of debt data recording and reporting—according to the public expenditure and financial 
accountability (PEFA) performance indicator—improved to a “B” in 2010 from a “C” and recording and 
management of cash balances, debt and guarantees posted an improvement from a “C” in 2005 to a 
“C+” in 2008 and remained at that level in 2010 (Annex Table 12c). In terms of the CAS milestones, 
medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) and activity based budgeting (ABB) were rolled out to 
the Bank of Zambia, the Public Service Pension Fund and state owned enterprises including ZESCO. 
was started.  Thus sustained Bank efforts in this area are beginning to have some positive results.    
The last CAS (FY04-07) also supported improvement in public expenditure management and efforts at 
enhancing the transparency of the budget. During that time frame ABB was approved and the MTEF 
20. 
This CAS pillar served as an umbrella for actions in a number of mutually-reinforcing or 
complementary areas.  As such, the Pillar II objective of institutional capacity enhancement in public 
management and productive sectors was to be achieved through concerted action in four main areas: (i) 
public financial management (PFM), procurement and oversight capacity; (ii) public management and 
transparency of mining and natural resources sectors; (iii) business environment; and (iv) agricultural 
productivity (Annex Table 10). The Bank supported the pillar through lending (e.g. PRSC I-III, Public 
Sector Management Program Support, Support to Economic Expansion Diversification (SEED), 
Agricultural Development Support Program (ADSP); the Irrigation Development and Support Project 
(IDSP) and the Livestock project were approved only in FY 2011 and 2012 respectively) and AAA (e.g. 
PER, policy notes, EITI scoping study, analytical work on copper fabrication, potential of the tourism 
sector, investment climate assessment Financial Sector Assessment Update, Zambia Business Survey, 
Jobs and Prosperity Initiative). IFC advisory services and investments also contributed to improving 
competitiveness and expanding access to finance. 

 Pillar II: Institutional Capacity Enhancement 

21. 
Strengthen PFM, procurement and oversight capacity (Partially Achieved).Consistent with the 
priority to help Zambia better manage its resources was support to the multi-donor supported Public 
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) program, whose aim is to improve 
Government capacity to effectively and efficiently mobilize and utilize public resources and strengthen 
financial accountability. The flagship of the PEMFA program is an integrated financial management 
information system (IFMIS).  Other major elements of the program include public procurement reform 
implementation and strengthening of the audit function. The World Bank is the current lead donor for 
the PEMFA program. The program had mixed results because the objectives of several components of 
the program have not been fully achieved and have been delivered later than envisaged. The program 
has facilitated the installation of IFMIS in the MoFNP and in 27 other ministries/provinces. IFMIS 
coverage is intended to expand to 48 Government entities by 2013. The implementation of IFMIS was 
delayed significantly due to challenges which are now being addressed by the Government such as high

behalf of Ministry of Finance and National Planning, Government of the Republic of Zambia by REPIM in association with Oxford 
Policy Management, Aug. 2010; p 36.

staff turnover at project management level, and challenges in contract management with the supplier. 
Timely production of financial statements (a CAS outcome indicator) depends on full implementation of 
IFMIS. 8 However, the implementation of the Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) 
system was well accepted by the Cabinet Office and MoFNP and a clear benefit of the system has been 
the removal of ghost workers. 

22. 
 There have been some improvements in procurement legislation and procedures albeit with 
delays compared to the original planning. Despite slow progress in reform of the public procurement 
system (attributable to lack of capacity as well as the long turnaround time to enact legislation), results 
are now beginning to manifest themselves. The Public Procurement Act (PPA) was enacted into law 
through a statutory instrument in December 2008 (i.e. 4 years into the PEMFA procurement reforms). 9 
The Act is expected to transform the Zambia National Tender Board (ZNTB) into an oversight and 
regulatory body for all procurement entities in the public sector. The new body is called the Zambia 
Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA). Another outcome is the development and implementation of 
record management systems in the Procurement Supply Units (PSUs) and the training associated with 
this (meeting the CAS milestone). Whilst it is of concern that some PSUs that have not been certified 
and do not have a functioning record management system continue to have a procuring responsibility. It 
is, however, positive to note that ZPPA is using a “Capacity Ladder Approach” which means that there 
has to be a minimum capacity in a PSU before a threshold can be devolved. PSUs with more capacity 
will take on a higher threshold compared to the weaker ones. There has been an improvement in the 
high level PEFA indicator for procurement (PI-19) from a “D+” score in the 2005 baseline assessment 
to a “C+” score in the 2008 assessment. The 2010 independent evaluation of the PEMFA program 
suggests that this should now be moved to a score of “B”, following the passing into law of the Public 
Procurement Act No. 12 of 2008 that provides for a procurement complaints mechanism. However, 
actual implementation of the procurement law has been slow to take off as the Government amended the 
law to allow for a further two-year transition period to allow ZPPA to review procurement actions. The 
envisaged CAS outcome indicator, “procurement processing time is maintained at 8 weeks for national 
competitive bidding (NCB) and at 12 weeks for international competitive bidding (ICB) in 90% of 
procurement supply units (PSUs) carried out by procurement committees” was not achieved. Bank 
projects are being negatively affected by delays and the time taken by the agency.  

23. 
Annual audit coverage has increased considerably, surpassing the CAS outcome indicator. 
The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) is now present in all nine provinces and nearly one-half of the 
districts and there is a minimum of one provincial officer per province in place. The percentage of 
entities covered by annual audit has increased significantly in recent years to about 80% in 2010 
(surpassing the CAS outcome indicator of 60%). The OAG has emerged as a strong oversight 
institution, and besides the usual financial audits, the OAG has recently carried out performance, 
systems and forensic audits in the Ministry of Health and the Roads Development Agency.   

24. 
Improve public management and transparency of mining and natural resources sectors 
(Partially Achieved). The Bank has supported the Government with the implementation of the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Zambia became an EITI candidate country in May 

8 An independent evaluation of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) program conducted in 
2010 notes that there is significant potential to achieve the program objectives if the government can complete the IFMIS exercise 
successfully and embark upon a continuing PFM reform program avoiding the mistakes of the past. After the evaluation, the 
government committed to drastically reducing the scope of PEMFA (from 13 to four components) as part of the extension of the 
program. The extended PEMFA focuses on four components—IFMIS, internal audit, procurement and revenue administration.

2009 and following the completion of the external validation process, Zambia was recently declared 
EITI compliant. The Zambia EITI council comprising 15 members drawn from Government, mining 
companies and civil society was formed in 2009, supported by a Zambia EITI Secretariat (meeting the 
envisaged CAS milestone). As part of the EITI process, the first EITI Revenue Reconciliation Report 
was published in February 2011 and the second one in March 2012 (in accordance with the CAS 
outcome indicator) - and the third Zambia EITI report is now in progress. With EITI-compliance, 
Zambia is among the few Sub-Saharan African countries to be validated as EITI compliant, and is 
looking at ways to deepen its EITI process.  The Bank has also supported the development of a mining 
cadaster, which is operational, but its full functionality and transparency, as well as supportive 
institutional arrangements, are still under development, as are broader dimensions of mining sector 
transparency. 

25. 
The Bank played an important role in strengthening the capacity of Zambia’s environmental 
regulatory institutions to improve compliance of the mining sector with environmental and social 
regulations. All major mines submitted their environmental management plans (EMPs) and about 90 
inspections per year in 23 mine areas were carried out during 2005 – 2010 and the industry compliance 
with EMPs increased from 35% in 2005 to 60% in 2010 (below the CAS target of 85%). The lower than 
hoped for level of compliance “is partly due to the fact that, during privatization, the Government 
exempted various new investors from having to comply with environmental standards to give them time 
to phase out or retrofit the old technology they inherited.” (CEP ICR, para. 60, p.24)    While the 
Copperbelt Environment Project (CEP) entailed extensive environment risk awareness activities and 
other forms of community consultation, a more proactive involvement of mining communities would 
have helped ensure sustainability, in accordance with the project’s design. In addition, while some 
indicators such as “pollution flows and loads resulting from mining operations are regularly monitored” 
they were more focused on process (monitoring) than outcome (compliance with environmental 
standards). Finally, changes in air and soil contamination were not captured (CEP ICR, p.14). 

26. 
The Bank also supported a program to improve the governance and transparency of other natural 
resources. The SEED project supported capacity building and infrastructure development in the Kafue 
National Park, one of the largest in the world. There are indications of recovery in wildlife and tourism 
revenues have increased. The ICR for the project reports on the increase in numbers and distribution of 
selected indicator mammal species within the National Park as demonstrated by the series of aerial 
surveys and confirmed by increased wildlife sightings by tourism operators although some areas 
continue to face encroachment and related poaching threats. However, weak coordination between the 
Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and the Ministry of Tourism, Environment, and Natural Resources 
(MTENR), insufficient budgetary allocations to the sector (Table 12a), and slow progress in addressing 
key policy constraints in the forest and in the wildlife sectors continue to impede progress in the sector.  

27. 
  Improve business environment (Partially Achieved). With support from both the Bank and 
IFC, there has been progress toward improving the business environment, but challenges remain. The 
objective of improving the business environment was also pursued during the last CAS (FY04-07). With 
the assistance from IDA FY08 CAS program and in close collaboration with IFC, the Government has 
been implementing regulatory reforms. 10 Under the IFC Zambia Investment Climate Program Phase one, 
a number of key legislative and licensing reforms were implemented. Thirty one licensing laws were 
adopted by parliament, 166 licenses were reformed, and an electronic registry of business licenses and a 

10 The World Bank works in close collaboration with IFC, through the joint Investment Climate Advisory Services, on the 
implementation of Doing Business and business license reforms.  The first Investment Climate Program started in 2009 and ended in 
December 2010. A successor program is being prepared.   

108 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
One Stop Shop were established. Licensing procedures have been made simpler and more transparent 
through the elimination or consolidation of a significant number of administrative requirements. 
28. 
 In 2009, following completion of the PRSC-I a baseline for all licenses to be eliminated was 
established by the Government's Business Licensing Reform Committee, which in 2009, proposed that, 
out of the total 517 business licenses that existed at the time in Zambia, 170 were to be eliminated, and 
the rest retained, amalgamated or reclassified. Rationalization of business licenses has been followed by 
the establishment of an informational e-registry in 2011 for all approved business licenses, which was 
supported by PRSC III.   Zambia has made progress in the areas of ease of starting a business, with the 
elimination of the minimum capital requirement, and in the area of enforcing contracts, with the 
introduction of an electronic case management system.  Thus the Bank has managed to stay the course 
in the business environment policy area, but each time introduces additional measures as the process 
matured.  Successive Bank strategies, analytical work and lending operations covered the same set of 
areas but each time building on previous progress and adding new dimensions. This “incremental 
approach” helped improve Zambia’s business environment with the country being recognized as among 
the top 10 reformers globally in 2011. MIGA support also contributed in this area during the CAS 
period.11  

29. 
Despite progress, three issues stand out in the 2013 Doing Business report: (i) Dealing with 
construction permits (rank 151), (ii) Getting electricity (rank 151); and (iii) Trading across borders (rank 
156). Besides licensing and regulatory framework, reforms in the areas of access to finance by MSME, 
labor market and skills supply, and infrastructure development will enhance competitiveness of 
Zambia’s private sector.  For a land-locked country such as Zambia, streamlined procedures and reduced 
delay at border posts could also go a long way in improving the environment for the private sector. 
According to the World Economic Form’s Global Competitiveness Index 2010-2011, Zambia is not a 
competitive place in which to do business (ranking 115th out of 139 countries).  In terms of the 
envisaged CAS outcome indicators, some target dates have been delayed as the associated Act was not 
promptly approved (e.g., the reduction in the licensing requirements, including the number of days to 
issue tourism licenses and license fees have  been delayed since the Tourism and Hospitality Act is 
being revised). Similarly, the Financial Sector Development Plan was only completed and approved by 
the Government in 2011 and is expected to increase access to finance. As traditional concessional 
financing phases out and the country relies increasingly on international markets and foreign direct 
investment, it will be important to further improve its business environment and competitiveness.  This 
will enhance Zambia’s international reputation as a destination for investment flows by reducing 
uncertainty. 

30. 
Improve agricultural productivity (Not Achieved).  This was one of the four outcomes under the 
Institutional Capacity pillar. Results of the Bank’s intervention in agriculture and marketing schemes for 
smallholders were below expectation.  Bank assistance through the ongoing ADSP achieved a number 
of its objectives, including improved infrastructure (about 1,000 km of rural road network has been 
improved against an end of the project target of 1,133 km), support to some 100,000 farmers and 
agribusiness enterprises including matching grants and TA, and improvement in cotton value chain with 
considerable success in terms of cotton seed production increase and meeting national demand.  
However, the program did not have a significant impact on the productivity of smallholders and the 
small increase in commercial export of targeted commodities (e.g. cotton, paprika, and coffee) is partly 
attributed to the Government subsidy programs that favored maize production. The expectation that the 
Bank’s intervention in agriculture under this CAS period could improve agricultural productivity was 

11 MIGA for the first time issued guarantees for $18.64 million in support of investments in the manufacturing and agribusiness 
sectors in Zambia during FY11. 

109 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
overly ambitious. While the CAS provided the strategic shift towards the agriculture sector (paragraph 
12), the actual disbursements during the CAS period for improving agriculture productivity were 
small.12 Project preparation took time and the Irrigation project became effective only in November 
2011 and the Livestock Development and Animal Health Project in July, 2012. On a positive note 
however, the ADSP supported monitoring gender dis-aggregated data since 2010 and the IFC launched 
the Zambia Emergent Farmers Program in June 2008 in partnership with the Zambia National 
Commercial Bank, Rabobank and the Zambia National Farmers Union. 

31. 
The Government agriculture subsidy program has biased the sector toward the production of 
maize, to the disadvantage of cotton, other cereals and roots and tubers.  The Farmer Input Support 
Program (FISP), subsidizes fertilizer, seeds, and other agricultural inputs, and the operation of the Food 
Reserve Agency (FRA) intervenes in the market for maize. These two programs account for 60-70% of 
Government spending on agriculture. The FISP is not effectively targeted: poor farmers are frequently 
unable to access the subsidy regime, and a large proportion of the subsidy is devoted to areas where 
there is already an adequate private sector supply of agricultural inputs; more remote, less populous 
areas—where farmers have fewer private sector alternatives—are typically excluded. 13  For 2007-2008 
the World Bank estimated that the FISP wasted an amount equal to roughly 20% of its total inputs. 
Audits of the program performed by the Ministry of Agriculture are expected to result in improved 
targeting and the implementation of a voucher scheme could reduce leakages in the execution of the 
subsidy. The FRA plays a major role in domestic maize-pricing mechanisms and is directly involved in 
crop purchasing, sale and the overall management of the national maize stock. In addition, the 
Government uses export bans, import tariffs rates and Government import programs with the stated 
objective of stabilizing prices and ensuring “food security”. In 2010, maize production reached a record 
high of 2.8 million metric tons, mostly due to good weather conditions.  As the FRA guarantees a 
minimum floor price, the Government decided to buy 800,000 metric tons of maize at a cost of ZMK1.3 
trillion (about $280 million). Because the floor price is about twice the current market price, the implicit 
subsidy will likely reach ZMK 650 billion ($140 million) about 4.8% of domestic revenues or 0.9% of 
GDP.  

The Bank’s recent analytical work highlighted the need to adjust FRA and FISP through (i) 
including multiple crop inputs, not only maize to encourage diversification; (ii) proposing a stock size of 
300,000 tons of maize (or 3 months of domestic consumption), which is sufficient to cover historical 
maize imports in any year from 1992 up to date; and (iii) FRA should buy through open tenders at 
market prices. The Government is well aware of the fiscal impact of financing the maize surplus and has 
agreed with the IMF to revise the current maize marketing and pricing mechanisms. This revision will 
establish a pricing system more reflective of market conditions and will act as an incentive to farmers in 
both deficit and surplus years. The Government has delayed approval of the proposed Agricultural 
Marketing Act which will allow the market to play a role in maize pricing, minimize fiscal costs and 
provide more effective market interventions. Irrigation schemes that were rehabilitated or constructed 
reforms in the agriculture sector a difficult task.   
reached only 559 hectares against the target of 6,200 hectares. Political economy constraints have made 

    32. 

12   In terms of investment volume, actual sector specific activities during the CAS period were about US$20 million, since not all of 
ADSP funds were disbursed. The rural roads that were built under this project while improving connectivity also could not be 
expected to show an immediate impact on productivity.  IFC’s program to engage with the Food Reserve Agency to rehabilitate and 
construct new silos for grain storage across the country is also recent.

Pillar III: Infrastructure Development 

33. 
 The infrastructure objectives under Pillar III of the CAS program were largely met with 
respect to transport but progress on water and energy has been relatively slow and difficult—
although sustained effort appears to be finally bearing fruit. Bank instruments in support of these 
objectives include lending (e.g. Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Program (RRMP I-II), PRSCs, 
Water Sector Performance Improvement Project (WSPIP), Increased Efficiency and Access to 
Electricity and AAA (e.g. Country Water Resource Assistance Strategy, Zambezi Multi-Sector 
Opportunity Analysis, Review of the Road SIP, and TAs). 

34. 
Improve transport infrastructure (Achieved). Transport activities under the CAS focused on 
rural roads upgrading and maintenance, construction/rehabilitation of sections of the trunk road and all 
weather accessible river crossings following the floods in 2006-07, which caused severe damage to river 
crossings throughout Zambia and reduced access to social services and markets by local communities.  
Stated CAS outcome indicators were met in each of these areas; namely by 2010 about 80% of rural 
population has access to all weather river crossings, and links between producers and agricultural 
markets in targeted areas improved, following the construction/rehabilitation of about one thousand one 
hundred km of unpaved rural roads. Moreover, the Bank played an important role in supporting the 
Government to rehabilitate and expand its network of roads, both through  the Bank-financed projects 
and, equally importantly, through catalyzing around US$270 million from other development partners 
for road improvement and construction. 14 However, the road sector faces challenges with regard to 
governance issues (as discussed below).  

35. 
Improve access to energy (Achieved). Improvement in the electricity sector has been relatively 
slower and more difficult but sustained efforts are beginning to have some positive impacts - most 
notably the increasing household access to electricity and improving operational efficiency of ZESCO, 
the state owned Power Company, and raising electricity tariffs to total cost recovery levels, attracting 
private sector participation in the energy sector. The Bank’s incremental approach towards reform 
reflected in its PRSC series helped the Government achieve these targets.  In 2008, the first year of 
electricity reform implementation, new domestic connections reached 25,700, substantially exceeding 
the target of 18,000.  The relevant PRSC-2 target was also exceeded. As of end-2009, ZESCO added 
35,709 new connections to the grid, well above the target number of 20,000. For PRSC-3 the target is a 
net increase of 10%, which has been met and the total number of customers reached nearly half a 
million by 2011. 15 In addition, the Bank has recently approved a regional transmission line project that 
would support increase in ZESCO’s power transfer capacity to the southern part of the country. The 
implementation of incremental electricity tariff increases scheduled since 2008 has improved the 
financial position of ZESCO and the financial viability of the sector, which combined with increasing 
demand, has resulted in attracting significant investments in power generation. An explicit approach of 
incremental progress involved the Bank sustaining efforts and staying the course in the sector, and 
addressing the same or closely related issues in that sector with successive interventions, but each time 
incrementally introducing additional measures until more progress was achieved over time.   

14    Besides the Bank, other development partners participating in the sector include Arab Bank for Economic Development in 
Africa, Danish International Development Agency, European Union, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (German Development Bank), 
Japan International Cooperation Agency, and Nordic Development Fund (NDF). The World Bank (2010), Republic if Zambia: Road 
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project in Support of the First Phase of the Road II Program” Report No. 53773-Zm, Sep 2010, para 
5, p.2.    
15   Despite progress access to electricity remains low at about 22 percent in May 2010 according to ZESCO estimates.

36. 
 Improve access to safe water (Partially Achieved). Under the World Bank supported WSPIP, 
the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) has constructed/rehabilitated 99 water kiosks in 12 
Lusaka peri-urban areas, with 56 currently supplying water. An estimated 4, 000 people have access to 
safe water with this number expected to increase when the rest of the constructed kiosks become 
functional.  There have been delays in implementation of WSPIP, mainly due to the two year 
effectiveness delay due to the non-payment of Government debt to the LWSC.  Despite progress, only 
about 60% of the population has access to safe water, necessitating further efforts.  The Bank-supported 
process in formulating the Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy has helped to advance reforms 
in water resources and facilitated increased awareness around the role of water in the national economic 
agenda. This contributed to the Government adopting a new legal framework for water resources 
approved by Parliament in 2011, replacing the 1948 Act and introducing a contemporary framework for 
ensuring sustainable development that can capitalize on Zambia's abundance of water resources. In 
parallel, the Bank undertook a Multi-Sector Investment Opportunity Analysis within the Zambezi River 
basin to demonstrate the benefits of regional cooperation. This highlighted the significant gains possible 
in energy production and food security through cooperation development and informed the formulation 
of a program of support in the Zambezi River basin through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for 
Cooperation in International Waters in Africa.  

Pillar IV: Human Capital Development 

37. 
The human capital development objectives under Pillar IV of the CAS program were largely 
met, although progress lagged in a few areas in education.  The CAS program emphasized 
strengthening skills and education for the formal and informal sectors and fighting malaria and Bank 
instruments in support of these objectives included lending (e.g. TEVET, and Malaria Booster)  and 
AAA (e.g. PETS basic education).  

38. 
Strengthen skills and education (Partially Achieved). The Bank supported the TDP with the 
objectives of developing a high-quality, sustainable, demand-driven and equitable training system 
capable of improving skills in both the formal and informal sectors of the economy. The objectives were 
highly relevant as improving work-force skills, is critical for improvement of productivity and 
competitiveness.  The objectives, however, were found to be excessively ambitious in relation to the 
allocated time and resources, the available capacity, and the institutional challenges and the incentives 
required in shifting the technical education and vocational training (TEVT) from supply to demand 
orientation (IEG (2011) Project performance Assessment Report (PPAR)). 16 
39. With the Bank support considerable progress was made toward raising the quality of the 
technical education system, in particular through the new quality assurance and curriculum development 
procedures implemented by the Technical Education Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training 
Authority (TEVETA). Buildings and new equipment were also procured for training institutions.  
Progress was also made toward increasing the demand orientation of training, by involving industry 
experts through TEVETA in setting standards, reviewing curricula, and developing modular and in-
service training capacity (as envisaged in the CAS milestones). Other demand-relevant measures, 
including strengthening the influence of the private sector through local management boards of training 
institutions, and the channeling of government and private finance for training through the Technical 

16   Considering the institutional challenges and the incentives required in shifting TVET from supply to demand orientation, 
involving changes in the expectations and behavior of public and private sector stakeholders, as well as the time needed to achieve 
demonstrated improvements in graduate outcomes throughout a reformed TVET system, it was unrealistic to expect to achieve the 
program objectives within five years or within the TDP budget.   

112 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
Education Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Fund, were not fully accomplished: 
management boards were established, with some delay, but they had limited authority and did not take 
contribution from the government or private sector, hampering the Fund’s sustainability prospects. On 
on an important role; and the TEVET Fund was only briefly piloted with donor funding, without 
the objective to create an equitable system, bursaries were awarded and sector policies were developed 
for gender and HIV/AIDS, contributing to the equity of the system.  

40. 
The TEVET Fund lacked a viable financing strategy when the TDP ended.   The initial proposal 
of introducing a payroll levy to help finance the TEVET Fund was not followed up and no alternative 
mechanism for private sector contributions was put forward. In the two years following closure of the 
project, government funding for the sector was not channelled (as had been agreed) through the TEVET 
Fund which therefore ceased operation. At the time of the IEG PPAR mission in 2011, the proposed 
autonomous status of the ministry-affiliated training institutions was not fully implemented in practice 
and their training operations continued to suffer from shortage and uncertainty of funding. The IEG 
mission found substantial disagreement among stakeholders on the best way forward for these 
institutions: whether to revert fully to direct Ministry of Science, Technology and vocational Training 
(MSTVT) funding and management, or pass control fully to the management boards and TEVETA. 

41. 
The selection of outcomes indicators for the TDP reform did not focus on results that could be 
clearly and directly linked to the project interventions (already discussed in para 10).  It would have 
been useful for the project to focus on indicators that could be directly linked to the Bank 
interventions—such as an established system for regular tracking of employment and incomes of 
graduates, with strong analysis and dissemination of the information.  

42. 
Improve health planning in fighting malaria (Achieved). The Malaria Booster Program (IDA 
credit and Russian Trust Fund) has made a significant contribution to the increased coverage of key 
malaria prevention activities that took place between 2006-11. The CAS envisaged targets were 
substantially achieved that is: (i) the percentage of children under 5 years of age who slept under an 
insecticide treated bed net increased from 30 to 70%; (ii) the percentage of pregnant women who took 
2+ doses of intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) for malaria increased from 59 to 70%; and (iii) the 
percentage of households that have at least one insecticide treated net (ITN) increased from 38 to 64 
percent. As a result of these interventions, the annual number of malaria deaths decreased by at least 
50% during the period 2008-10. Additional financing for the Malaria Booster Program is supporting the 
purchase of bed nets in close collaboration with the UN and other development partners. The essential 
drugs public pilots program, supported by the Bank, has led to dramatic increase in the availability of 
drugs in rural areas.  The Government has decided to scale-up the program and it is estimated that the 
improvement in the availability of Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) will result in a 21% 
the Government’s scale-up decision.17  The Bank has also supported the Government to pilot innovative 
reduction in under-five child deaths due to malaria. The ESW—Improving Access to ACT—informed 
approaches to improve safe access to drugs through the private sector in underserved areas by piloting a 
price subsidy of ACTs and Rapid Diagnostic Tests to accredited private sector drug sellers in 4 districts 
in the country.

arms of the study.

Cross Cutting Themes: Governance and HIV  

43. 
Sector governance weaknesses. The World Bank was a strong voice among donors on critical 
governance issues during the CAS period. Concerns have been raised regarding governance issues 
involving the Ministry of Health and roads sector agencies. Implementation of programs in the roads 
sector was adversely impacted when the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) identified numerous 
instances of financial irregularity and implementation weaknesses in the roads sectors in 2009.  To 
address the issues raised by the OAG, Government has responded expeditiously and has made good 
progress in developing and implementing a governance action plan, which included changes in the 
Board and Management of the Road Development Agency (RDA) and the National Road Fund Agency 
(NRFA). Similarly, the misappropriation of resources in the health sector resulted in disciplinary action 
against several officials from the Ministry of Health and substantial remedial actions being implemented 
to improve governance in the sector.  

44. 
The Bank, jointly with the cooperating partners in these sectors, is taking the necessary actions 
to ensure that remedial measures are in place to correct the sector governance weaknesses. Specific steps 
in this regard also focus on safeguarding the proposed investments and ensuring that professional 
integrity and the principles of transparency and accountability are upheld. 18 One notable step is that full 
implementation of the Road Sector Governance Plan (RSGP) as agreed and the inclusion of the plan as a 
covenant under the additional financing of the Bank-supported roads project (RRMP II). The Bank has 
been supporting the road sector at another level with implementation of efficiency improvements 
through performance-based contracting that resulted in significant cost savings and administrative 
improvements. Under ADSP the Bank supported the award of four Output and Performance-based Road 
Contracts on about 1,133 km of unpaved roads. These four contracts have 5-year duration and have 
replaced a multitude of traditional contracts with the contractor being paid a fixed monthly sum for 
providing the roads at a good level of service. These contracts reduced internal administration for the 
road sector (fewer contracts to let and administer) and resulted in about a 30% savings when compared 
to traditional contracts. These very positive results led the road sector to decide to roll out the OPRC-
contracting methodology over the complete unpaved road network, a program aimed to commence in 
2013 and to be fully implemented in 2018. In the health sector Government has engaged an independent 
fiduciary review agent who is addressing fiduciary concerns and building capacity in the sector.  The 
Bank continues to work with the Government on improving public financial management and building 
institutions under the public service management program.   

45. 
The Bank has also started, as a pilot approach, activities to improve accountability of the 
Government vis-à-vis citizens by supporting demand for good governance.  User feedback 
mechanisms, community monitoring and stronger linkages are likely to lead to more effective 
institutions, processes and systems. A number of specific pilot activities are being undertaken: examples 
include (i) technical support to issues-based civil society coalitions (on procurement monitoring, 
freedom of information and monitoring of extractive industries) in the form of trainings, sensitizations 
and communications campaigns; (ii) capacity building of the media including  journalism workshops 
and funded internships as well as the piloting of interactive radio programs that improve dialogue 
between rural constituents and their service providers; (iii) development of formalized beneficiary 
feedback mechanisms in Bank-funded projects. Each of these activities is being undertaken on an 

18   See for example, “In depth Financial Review of First Additional Financing for Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project 
undertaken by the Bank in May 2010.   

114 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
experimental basis and with an overall view towards finding what are the most effective means 
of stimulating and sustaining demand amongst Zambian citizens for good governance.  

46. 
Social accountability in the mining sector.  Building on progress achieved under the CEP, the 
ICR for that project proposed that future Bank programs should strengthen social accountability by 
engaging mining-affected communities and civil societies in measuring water, air and soil quality. The 
Bank’s comparative advantage in supporting these activities lies in its international experience in 
facilitating governance, on the demand side, by strengthening the environmental management capacity 
of community-based entities, such as Resident Development Committees, and NGOs, and on the supply 
side, by supporting the Government in providing an enabling environment to jointly improve 
governance and compliance in the mining sector which instills trust in local authorities and the 
government (ICR, p.16). This would also help enhance sustainability prospects of progress made. 

47. 
HIV/AIDS.   The Government’s FNDP emphasizes social sector development, including 
spending on HIV/AIDS, as important not only for improving social welfare but also for spurring 
economic growth.  Zambia is still a hyper-epidemic country (with prevalence of HIV in population ages 
15-45 amounting to 14%) and will continue to face the consequences of HIV/AIDS in the medium and 
long terms, making these objectives strongly relevant vis-à-vis the epidemiology in the country.  The 
objectives of the Bank-supported Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS (ZANARA) project, to 
reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS, mitigate the socio-economic impact of the disease, and increase 
access to care and support for people infected or affected by HIV and AIDS in Zambia, was consistent 
with the FY08 CAS. It is worth noting that high-risk, high-transmission groups (e.g. miners, sex 
workers, and long-distance truck drivers) were not fully captured in the objectives. In addition, the ICR 
noted (p.91) an opportunity to undertake a baseline survey to define the starting point of project 
activities was missed. This, followed by impact assessments done at the conclusion of the project would 
have allowed a more systematic measure of the impact of the project on key sectors. 

48. 
The ZANARA project provided about US$55 million for HIV/AIDS along with global funds, 
namely, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) (US$300 million in grants) 
and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (US$577 million), covering treatment, 
prevention and care (IEG ICR Review). Thus the outcomes cited below are not necessarily entirely 
attributable to the Bank project.   

49. 
The Bank objective of preventing and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS was substantially 
achieved and gender disaggregated data is provided by the ICR. 19  Measures to mitigate the 
socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS were effectively introduced.  For example, school enrollment 
among orphans and vulnerable children exceeded the target and about 88% of orphans and vulnerable 
children attending school, compared with 91% of other children.  Progress in terms of increased access 
to care and support—through provision of drugs for treatment, training in advocacy and positive living, 
syndrome management and home-based care—was modest (IEG ICR Review, 2010).   

50. 
Some lessons learned included: despite the progress achieved, prevention of new HIV infections 
at community level is still a challenge and should receive priority for the next generation of subprojects, 

19   Outcomes reported by the ICR include condom use  increased from 44% in 2002 to 50% in 2008 for  males  (DHS) (against a 
target increase of 15 percentage points – from 30 percent to 45 percent); among women in the same age group, condom use increased 
from 33% in 2002 to 37.4% in 2008 (exceeding the target of  30 percent).  During the same period, the percentage of youth’s age 15-
24 years who knew that abstaining from sexual intercourse is a key intervention to prevent HIV transmission increased to 83% 
among females, and 84% among males.    

115 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
according to the ICR (p.41). Communities should be encouraged to improve their understanding of the 
dynamics of a generalized epidemic and the remedies needed to address it. Mainstreaming HIV and 
AIDS in line ministries took the form of a standard menu of interventions. Interaction between 
ministries was enhanced through the planning meetings. This opened avenues for sharing information 
and lessons learnt in implementation of work place activities. However, there is also an urgent need to 
strengthen work place programs within the private sector especially small business. Finally, 
sustainability remains a challenge. Availability of internal and external resources is limited, particularly 
considering the global financial crisis. For example, the GFATM’s current 10% cut on round 8 and 
further 25% cuts in future GFATM funding will certainly limit Zambia ability to further expand HIV 
programs to vulnerable populations. 

IV. World Bank Performance  

51. 
The Bank strategy was guided by a substantial program of analytical and advisory services and 
non-lending technical assistance from both the Bank and IFC.  Several key economic and sector work 
were important forerunners to reform dialogues and lending operations as noted below; but a 
governance diagnostic study would have been desirable given governance weaknesses in several sectors.  
• The Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2010) influenced the design of measures to strengthen 
efficiency and equity in public spending and suggested  measures to improve the budget and 
planning processes, as well as to account properly for the economic effects of an exhaustible 
resource such as copper, and the need to improve project-specific investment management.  The 
PER provides a detailed analysis of the major infrastructure sub-sectors, such as roads and water 
and the lending program including the PRSC series draw heavily on the PER. 
• The Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (2007) found that despite recent gains, poverty 
levels are unacceptably high in Zambia, especially among the rural poor.  The assessment 
identified major challenges faced by the country in its efforts to reduce poverty and promote 
economic equity and guided the preparation of the PRSC series.   
• The Bank and IFC were very responsive, as evidenced by quick response to Government 
demand on the Doing Business agenda that yielded Zambia’s performance as top ten reformers 
in 2011.  The World Bank worked in close collaboration with IFC, through the joint Investment 
Climate Advisory Services, on the implementation of Doing Business and business license 
reforms.  The first Investment Climate Program started in 2009 and ended in December 2010.  
• A number of sector studies such as the tourism study and the study on copper identified key 
issues and helped inform sector analyses and policies. 

52. 
In some cases, the objectives and design of assistance were complex and ambitious, 
particularly in light of the country’s weak implementation capacity. For the TDP, with nine separate 
components, it was unrealistic to expect to achieve the program objectives within five years or within 
the TDP budget. The TDP experienced a two-year extension.  Likewise, the ICR for the CEP project 
noted in para 22, “the approach was rather complex, and, in retrospect, achieving the proposed outcomes 
within the original timeframe of the project (5 years) was overly optimistic”. The CEP project closing 
date was extended by nearly 3 years.  Similarly, there were delays over the life of the WSPIP mainly 
due to the two year effectiveness delay due to the non-payment of government debt to the Lusaka Water 
and Sewerage Company.  The implementation of the Increased Access to Electricity Services (IAES) 
Project was, however, slower than expected due to management changes at ZESCO and long lead times 
needed for procurement.   

116 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
53. 
Project design often did not take into sufficient account the challenges of stakeholder 
ownership and participation and their implication in implementation and sustainability.  Project 
design is often not based on in-depth information and analysis of the relevant strength, perceptions, 
interests and incentives of different stakeholder groups; all necessary for facilitating implementation and 
ensuring sustainability.  While the CEP design envisioned meaningful participation of mining 
communities, this did not materialize during implementation. A more proactive involvement of mining 
communities would have also helped to ensure sustainability.  Low level of ownership and lack of 
strong leadership are particularly noticeable in public sector reform, as evidenced by significant delays 
in implementing, the IFMIS and the broader PEMFA program. An independent evaluation of PEMFA 
notes that an underlying requirement for successful PEMFA reform is the vital importance of 
ownership. 20 

54. 
The CAS results matrix does not clearly show the link between projects/AAA and outcomes. 
The design and implementation experience of the FY08-11 CAS showed the link between projects and 
CAS outcomes was sometimes weak. The selection of outcome indicators for a project/program was not 
always based on results that can be clearly and directly attributed to the program interventions. The 
ADSP that aimed to increase cotton exports is a notable example.  The selection of the exports indicator 
raises the question of attribution and controlling for other factors.  It may be more useful for ADSP to 
focus on indicators that can be directly linked to the Bank interventions—such as crop diversification—
than on trying to demonstrate higher level impacts—such as increasing exports—within the course of 
one institutional reform project. The TDP program is another example. By focusing on higher level CAS 
outcome objectives, such as the employment of TEVET graduates, the TDP results framework failed to 
make explicit the linkages or chain between program outputs and outcomes.    

55. 
The Bank collaborated with other development partners and mobilized a high parallel/co-
financing ratio for its support. The Bank is part of a group of eight development partners supporting the 
road sector and the Bank attracted US$270 million in co-financing against its support of US$ 90 million 
for the road project (RMDT), a ratio of US$3 on every Bank dollar.  Similarly the Bank contributed 
US$8million towards a US$76 million PEMFA program and US$24 million towards a US$78 million 
TDP program. The ZANAR program triggered an inflow of financing from global funds. The Bank is a 
lead donor in six clusters and cross cutting themes (i.e. transport, energy, water &sanitation, tourism, 
environment and natural resources, and macroeconomics) and is playing an active role in six other 
clusters/sectors, including agriculture, education and health. High co-financing ratios were raised by the 
PRSC series that draws upon a collaborative and harmonized process for providing budget support to 
the GRZ by donors.  Zambia’s seven development partners—including the Bank—that provide budget 
support have formed the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) group. The PRBS group has agreed 
on a common review process, the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), which is a multi-year 
PAFs. 21 The Bank’s harmonization and close collaboration with the PRBS group was facilitated by the 
matrix of policy reforms supported by the PRBS group and the PRSCs prior actions are drawn from the 
presence of the PRSC task team leaders in the Country Office.  
56. 
Going forward the Bank and donors are looking for ways to further strengthen 
harmonization. Some studies have noted areas for further improvement in harmonization and

behalf of Ministry of Finance and National Planning, Government of the Republic of Zambia by REPIM in association with Oxford 
Policy Management, Aug. 2010.       
21   While budget support targeted poverty reduction, the PAFs do not include indicators for the measurement of poverty.

alignment in line with Paris Declaration. 22 Similarly, an evaluation of the first Joint Assistance Strategy 
for Zambia (JASZ, 2007-2010)—that was meant to help improve aid effectiveness and  manage donor 
cooperation in line with Paris Declaration and the FNDP— found that the JASZ has been less effective 
in enhancing government ownership, building mutual accountability between government and 
development partners, and managing for results. 23  More recently, the World Bank Group along with 
the donor community is working on a Mutual Accountability Framework to not only improve the 
process but also the outcomes of harmonization. There is also on-going effort among cooperating 
partners about strategies for mainstreaming the gender agenda. 

Portfolio Performance 

57. 
The IDA lending program proceeded as anticipated with few exceptions. The proposed 
competiveness DPL operations as well as the three investment credits (Hydro Energy Generation, Small 
Towns Water and Sanitation Services Project and Water Resource Development Project) were dropped 
or delayed, and the Kafue-Livingstone transmission Upgrade Project and additional financing for 
Malaria Booster SIL, Water Sector Performance Investment Project, Increased Access to Electricity 
Services, were added. The CAS had planned 11 projects, of which 8 were delivered during the CAS 
period (not counting those regional/global projects).  Overall lending for FY08-11 amount to US$362 in 
line with the original CAS lending allocation.  The country program also included 45 Zambia specific 
trust funds (amounting to US$124 million. Four of these trust funds were approved in the last year of the 
CAS (Annex 11). In addition, Zambia also benefited from global and regional trust funds. 

58. 
Completed and ongoing projects have mostly MS performance.  Three completed projects with 
total net commitment of over US$140 million were rated MS by IEG (Annex Table 3). The SEED, the 
Public Service Management Program Support project (PSMPSP), the CEP and the PRSP series also 
closed during the CAS period. The CEP project was rated MS by the ICR but the IEG ICR reviews for it 
is still being finalized. The SEED project was however, rated MU by the ICR and by IEG. The ICRs for 
the PSMPSP and the PRSP series are under preparation.  Zambia’s current portfolio comprises eight 
investment operations (Annex Table 4) with commitments of US$503.2 million. ISRs rate progress 
towards DO as fully S (3) and MS(5). Implementation progress was rated as fully S(2), MS (5) and MU 
(1) as of December 18th.  

59. 
The quality of the portfolio has improved. With respect to the quality of the portfolio, over 20% 
of the portfolio was deemed projects at risk during FY09-11, but this was reduced to zero percent by 
FY12. However, the country risk flag continues. Overall, Zambia’s commitments at risk were on line 
with the Sub-Saharan African countries (SSA) average during FY09-11, but much better in FY12 
(Annex Table 4).     

60. 
The Zambian country assistance program is relatively expensive. The average cost of project 
preparation during the CAS period was US$412, 000, higher than the SSA average of about US$336, 
000. The average cost of supervision was US$138, 000 per project, above the regional average of 
US$110, 000. The high cost of the assistance program suggests that the projects being prepared could be 
complex and taking too long to prepare. 

22  A donor-led evaluation of budget support in Zambia concludes that budget support has helped to realize a number of objectives in 
Zambia but notes that budget support could have been more effective and that the weaknesses on the part of the Government as well 
as a lack of harmonization on the donor side have undermined the potential of the instrument.  A. de Kemp, J. Faust, and s. Leiderer

61. 
The disbursement rate in the CAS period sharply declined, compared with SSA and Bank-
wide trends but has picked up in the last six months.  There was a consistent decline in IDA 
disbursements to Zambia during the CAS period, when the rate dropped from about 29% in FY08 to 
18% in FY11 and further to about 11% in FY12 (Table 2). Disbursements have picked up in the last 
quarter and for FY13 Zambia’s disbursement ratio is 7.1 as of December 18th. Slow disbursing projects 
include the 8-year old road project (RRMP) with a disbursement ratio of 63% and the 5.5-year old water 
project (WSPIP) that spends just over half of its budget. The low disbursement rates reflected delays 
associated with project implementation and the adverse impact of the death of the Zambian president 
and national elections that followed on the Bank program during FY09-10.  In addition, the low 
disbursements appear to be the results of an extended project cycle, slow preparation, poor readiness for 
implementation, slow start-up, and routine extensions.  The overall disbursement rates for SSA and 
Bank-wide fluctuated during the period under review, but remained higher than Zambia’s rate until FY 
12.

Bank performance.  The FY08 CAS was aligned with the government’s strategy and the Bank 
responded swiftly to the government’s request for support in the area of business environment. A 
number of key outcomes were achieved and a broadly sound assistance program, particularly for 
promoting agricultural development was put in place with the approval of the Irrigation and Livestock 
Development projects in FY11 and 12. Preparation also began for a regional agriculture research project 
which will be approved in 2013. A broad range of relevant analytical work was also undertaken and will 
provide the basis for dialogue and interventions in a range of sectors during the next strategy. However, 
the overall assistance program turned out to be ambitious for the period and the circumstances of 
Zambia. 

63. 
  The CAS was a results-based one, but the Bank, in some cases, did not pay adequate attention 
to the development of realistic and monitorable indicators.  The weak results framework was corrected 
during the CASPR.  Implementation of on-going projects proceeded slowly, primarily because of 
ambitious design relative to existing capacity, but the outcome of completed projects was mostly 
moderately satisfactory.  The AAA activities undertaken by the Bank were relevant, of high quality and 
helped the Bank carry out its strategy.  The Bank managed to maintain a dialogue with the government 
and donors and having an office in Lusaka has helped. The Bank collaboration with other development 
partners helped leverage additional donor resources and strengthen prospects for reforms. On balance, 
Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. 

V. 

Lessons Learned for Subsequent Strategy Design 

64. 
Several lessons have been learnt from implementation of the FY08CAS, and which will be 
brought to bear in the design of new projects and the scope and composition of the new CPS 2013-2016:  

119 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
65. 
The CPS needs to be more realistic in its strategic objectives and consistent with allocated 
time and resources, and available capacity.  The CPS should not underestimate key risks: in particular, 
complex project/program design and implementation challenges; shortage of skills and capacity for 
implementation; sufficient attention must be given to ensuring readiness for implementation (e.g., 
through piloting); and developing adequate results framework and M&E system.  

66. 
Simplification of project design in future operations is critical to avoid implementation delays.  
Many projects were extended, signifying the need to pay attention to design and capacity issues that 
have contributed to delays in implementation. A simpler design based on available capacity and on in-
depth information and analysis of the relevant strength, perceptions, interests and incentives of different 
stakeholders may help ameliorate implementation delay risks. While community consultations were 
extensive during the preparation of the mining environment management plan (i.e. the identification of 
potential subprojects), the extent of community involvement in the implementation of remedial 
subprojects (e.g. through labor-intensive public works opportunities), was lower than anticipated, and 
may have adversely affected their sustainability and ownership as mining-affected communities may 
have felt that they did not share the benefits of a prosperous extractive industry. In the TDP and IFMIS 
programs attention was given to the technical soundness of the vision for the new demand-driven 
vocational training system and the new PFM system but not enough to the implementation challenges 
(which produces winners and losers) -and the need to ensure buy-in by different stakeholders to their 
new roles.  Strengthening stakeholder involvement and participation would enhance ownership and 
sustainability. 

67. 
The need for a sound CPS results matrix that clearly shows the link between projects/AAA 
and outcomes. The selection of indicators for a CPS should focus on results that can be clearly and 
directly linked to the Bank instruments. A more explicit results chain showing how inputs and outputs 
would produce outcomes to meet objectives needs to be explicitly laid out. Selection of some of the 
outcome indicators such as the employability of graduates and increased cotton exports raises the 
question of attribution and controlling for other factors. It would be better in such cases – when higher 
level outcomes cannot be expected within the time frame of the project, or the specific contribution of 
the project interventions cannot readily be separated from other factors – to focus on the intermediate 
outcomes for which the project or program can clearly be held accountable.  In addition, a sound results 
matrix would require baselines for subsequent evaluations to be established right from the beginning so 
that preliminary results are available at CPS Progress Report/MTR to discern whether changes to the 
results are warranted.  

68. 
An explicit approach of “incremental progress” by all the parties involved has proven 
effective in Zambia.   This approach involved the Bank staying the course in a particular policy area and 
addressing the same or closely related issues in that policy area with successive analytical work or 
lending operations, but each time incrementally and patiently introducing additional measures until 
more complete progress was achieved over time. This approach worked particularly well in energy 
sector, where the Bank assistance supported the country expand access to electricity, improve the 
efficiency of the electricity company, and introduce tariff reforms that enhanced the financial viability 
of the sector, resulting in recent foreign investment in power generation.  Similarly, the incremental 
progress constituted a needed investment in building blocks required for success over a longer period in 
the areas such as public financial management (PFM) and business environment. 

69. 
The Bank should continue to forge close partnership with other development partners to 
leverage resources and strengthen prospects for reforms.  The experience during this strategy period 
showed that the Bank mobilized a high co-financing ratio for its relatively small assistance program and 
worked in close collaboration with other development partners including PRBS group in helping the 

120 

 
 
 
 
 
 
GRZ implement reforms supported by general budget support or sector/investment support. The Bank’s 
harmonization and close collaboration with other budget support development partners was facilitated 
by the presence of the PRSC task team leaders in the Country Office. Nevertheless, further improvement 
in harmonization and alignment in line with Paris Declaration is needed.

Human Capital Development 

 3.1 Improved transport infrastructure. 

4.1 Improved health programming. 

 3.2 Improved access to water, energy 
services and irrigation systems. 

4.2 Strengthened skills and education for 
the formal and informal sectors.  

2.1 Strengthened public financial 
management, procurement and oversight 
capacity.  

2.2 Improved public management and 
transparency of the mining sector and 
improved management of the natural 
resources sector. 
2.3 Improved business environment, 
especially for micro-, small- and medium-

2.4 Improved agricultural productivity and 
marketing schemes for smallholders.  

Good governance: increased Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score for Public Sector Management and Institutions by 2010. 
HIV: # of people reached through HIV mainstreaming activities in interventions. ‘Mainstreaming’ is a set of minimum requirements each intervention has to support for implementing 

agencies/ clients: focal point(s), HIV policy, strategy and an HIV related M&E system operational covering target project areas.  

Mainstreaming ‘Good Governance’ and HIV measures into all operations 

24 Alignment and Harmonization: Under the JASZ division of labor the World Bank is a lead donor in 6 FNDP sectors: macro-economics, agriculture, private-sector

1.1. Macroeconomic framework and 
expenditure management maintain stability 
and support the growth and diversification 
of the economy. 

 The composition of public expenditure 
prioritizes and shows real increase in 
allocation to pro-poor sectors (e.g. agri-
culture, tourism, rural infrastructure) from 
2007 levels. 

≈ GRZ has put in place clear 
guidelines for allocation of 
additional resource flows from 
mining.  

 Budget presentation includes reporting on 
donor funding and revenues and 
expenditures of quasi-fiscal institutions 
(Bank of Zambia, the Public Service 
Pension Fund and state owned enterprises 
(SOEs), especially ZESCO).  

• Current composition of 
expenditures is not fully 
supportive of high and 
sustainable long-term growth, 
which would affect the poor 
more strongly  

• Expenditure programs do not 
get executed as planned due to 
low absorption capacity by 
line ministries.  

• Low level of public 
investment in programs that 
support growth and benefit the 
rural areas. 

• Limited institutional capacity 
of fiscal management in the 
mining sector.  

• Large external inflows from 
the mining sector lead to 
symptoms of ‘Dutch Disease’ 

and hamper diversification. 

 MoFNP consults stakeholders annually on 
the performance of the country’s 
development programs under the FNDP. 

≈ GRZ agrees on instruments for 
managing the uncertainty & 
volatility of revenue flows from 
mining and puts in place an 
appropriate mechanism to harness 
the flows (such as a sovereign 
wealth fund). 

≈ 

ZRA submits reports for MTEF and 
annual budget based on corporate 
fiscal models to (a) audit mining 
returns and (b) to predict and collect 
taxes from mining.  

≈ Development of a centralized data 
base of domestic & external debt in 
MoFNP.

There has been improvement in the availability and quality of debt 
data. The records on external debt are complete, updated and 
reconciled semi-annually. All 
the records pertaining 
to all 
components of domestic debt stock is captured in an excel spread 
sheet. The current version of DMFAS does not have a functionality 
to capture the parameters of domestic debt. IDM is considering 
upgrading to the latest version of DMFAS.  In future the score of a 
“B” will be possible on this dimension.
