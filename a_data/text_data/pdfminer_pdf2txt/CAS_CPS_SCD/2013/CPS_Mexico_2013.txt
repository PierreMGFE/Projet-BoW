United Mexican States 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (FY14-19) 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
The Mexico Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), covering FY14-19, is fully aligned with 
the goals of Mexico's National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013-18 and supports the 
Government of Mexico’s development agenda of increased productivity and inclusive and 
sustainable growth. The World Bank Group (WBG) program under the CPS fosters the twin 
goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The 
Mexico CPS includes a benchmarking of extreme poverty and shared prosperity and a thorough 
ex ante diagnosis of development challenges conducted in 2012 utilizing a set of country-specific 
Policy Notes. It includes a systematic effort at selectivity for highest impact of WBG activities 
on the twin goals, WBG comparative advantage, and client demand. Finally, it presents a results-
based WBG thematic engagement program that integrates financial, knowledge, and convening 
services in a tailored package of development solutions. 
Diagnosis of Mexico's Development Challenges 
2. 
Mexico is an upper middle-income country with one of the highest per capita incomes 
among Latin American countries. It is a member of the OECD and the G20. Mexico is an open 
economy with trade agreements with more than 40 countries. It has maintained solid 
macroeconomic stability in times of crisis and financial sector resilience. Mexico’s innovations 
in social policy have been a matter of global learning. Yet, despite Mexico’s significant 
economic and social improvements, stagnant productivity and insufficient inclusiveness are the 
critical causes of persistent poverty, inequality, and regional disparities within Mexico.  
3. 
Extreme poverty declined from over 11.3 percent to 9.8 percent between 2010 and 2012 
according to Mexico’s multi-dimensional poverty measure. However, its monetary dimension 
increased slightly from 19.4 to 20.0 percent during the same period. This indicates that the recent 
reduction of extreme poverty in Mexico has been the result of increased access to social goods 
and services, particularly health care, but labor market opportunities for earning a living are still 
limited. This is due to long-term problems with productivity but also to a series of shocks–the 
food price crisis, the global financial crisis, and the A1H1-flu epidemic prevention. A rebound of 
economic growth during 2010-12 boosted shared prosperity as income growth of the bottom 40 
percent of the population increased on average by 2.3 percent, higher than the average income 
growth of 0.6 percent for the total population for the same period. These national averages, 
however, hide important regional differences. Poverty rates in Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca, 
among the poorest states in Mexico, are 10 times higher than in the richest states. 
Selectivity Framework and Principles of Country Engagement 
4. 
The starting point of the WBG program proposed in this CPS is a comprehensive 
diagnostic of development challenges by WBG staff through a set of Policy Notes and by the 
Government through its own NDP. Departing from the NDP’s 37 strategic development areas, a 
systematic filtering process then identifies 11 areas of engagement by aligning them with the 
WBG’s twin goals, WBG comparative advantage in Mexico, and country demand. Within these 
areas of engagement, WBG interventions can have the greatest impact during the next 6 years on 
12 specific development outcomes. For each expected outcome of the CPS, the country 
engagement proposes to deliver tailored development solutions through packages of WBG 
financial, knowledge, and convening services. Based on the above process of selectivity 

i 

assessment, the Bank strategy: (i) exited several areas of previous CPS engagement (e.g., trade 
competitiveness, customs, judicial, and influenza support programs); (ii) centered its ongoing 
and new knowledge and convening program, including the growing reimbursable advisory 
program, around seven selective multi-year/multi-sector Programmatic Approaches for increased 
effectiveness and reduced transactions costs (e.g., in innovation strategies for poor states; in 
integrating social protection systems; in managing fiscal challenges; and in disaster risk 
management and urbanization); and (iii) limited its new financial services to the green and 
inclusive growth and the social prosperity themes (e.g., Oaxaca water, community education, and 
second generation Oportunidades). Compared to the previous CPS, the selectivity process 
resulted in a compression from 5 to 4 themes and in a reduction from 28 to 12 outcomes. 
WBG Program and Development Solutions  
5. 
To address the country’s main development challenges, the Mexico NDP focuses on: (a) 
achieving peace; (b) making Mexico more inclusive; (c) improving the quality of the education 
system; (d) promoting prosperity; and (e) consolidating efforts to make Mexico a responsible 
international player. The NDP also adopts three crosscutting strategies: democratize productivity, 
foster a modern government, and integrate a gender perspective. The CPS program supports 
these efforts through focused and selective interventions integrating the WBG goals of reducing 
extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity with Mexico’s NDP goals, with special 
attention to states with the highest poverty rates. 
6. 
This CPS proposes a WBG program focused on those areas that are expected to have the 
greatest impact on improvements in poverty and shared prosperity. Poverty is measured by 
indicators of access to health, education, nutrition, social security, housing, basic utilities as well 
as by household income levels, the latter also being key for gauging advances in shared 
prosperity. This means that policy interventions supported by the WBG ought to affect 
productivity to influence earnings; inclusiveness to make sure that the poor have access to health, 
education and social security; and sustainability so that the expansion of urban development and 
basic utilities do not deteriorate the resource base of the country. Given this multi-
dimensionality, and making use of a comprehensive country diagnostic prepared by World Bank 
staff in 2011-12, this strategy categorizes the main challenges to reduce extreme poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity into four themes to: (a) increase productivity and ensure its gains 
are widespread, (b) ensure that poorer segments of society benefit from basic social services and 
contribute to economic growth, (c) strengthen public finances and improve government 
efficiency, and (d) combine the economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development.  
Risks and Mitigating Factors 
7. 
Four potential risks to the CPS are: (a) sluggish economic performance due to failure to 
increase competitiveness and enact key structural reforms, (b) little room for countercyclical 
lending by IBRD in the event of global or local shocks, (c) incomplete or deficient program 
implementation due to complexities of the WBG program at the national and subnational levels, 
and (d) crime and violence. Three main approaches are identified to mitigate these risks. First, to 
address global or local shocks, the WBG is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of its 
financial instruments to provide viable alternatives to the authorities. Second, in mitigating 
program risks, the management of thematic business plans and programmatic approaches around 
results will help focus attention to strategic outcomes and portfolio performance while 
maintaining the flexibility to adjust to country circumstances and build in continuous learning. 
Third, the WBG engagement is not concentrated in areas of high criminality, reducing the 
chances of negative impact to the program.

United Mexican States 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (FY14-19) 

1. 
The Mexico Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers FY14 to FY19 and is fully 
aligned with the goals of Mexico's National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-2018. The strategy 
also focuses on the World Bank Group (WBG) twin goals of ending extreme poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. This CPS document has five main parts. 
Part I summarizes a country analysis based on a set of policy notes and also includes a poverty 
assessment to benchmark poverty and shared prosperity trends at the global, national, and 
subnational levels. Part II summarizes the goals and strategies underpinning Mexico’s NDP for 
2013-18. Parts III and IV explain the principles and the content of the WBG partnership with 
Mexico for FY14-19. Parts V and VI describe the financial, operational, and fiduciary 
underpinnings of the activities postulated and the risks facing the strategy. Finally, the annexes 
provide the results framework, detailed country diagnostic and poverty assessment, assessment 
of the previous CPS, gender dimensions, and an overview of the emerging WBG engagement in 
the State of Oaxaca. 

I. COUNTRY DIAGNOSIS  

A. 
Poverty and Shared Prosperity Trends  
An Innovative Measure of Poverty 
2. 
Mexico is the first country in Latin America to adopt a Multi-dimensional Poverty Index 
as its official poverty measure. Mexico’s official poverty measure includes both monetary and 
non-monetary indicators, with an indicator of monetary well-being (measured by income below a 
nationally defined poverty line) as one dimension, and access to social goods and services as 
another dimension. To be considered poor in Mexico, a person has income below the poverty 
line and has at least one deprivation in terms of housing, infrastructure, education, health, social 
security, or food security. An extremely poor person has income below the minimum well-being 
line and suffers from three or more deprivations. Thus, income poverty alone does not make one 
poor nor can income growth alone move one out of poverty. 1 These multiple dimensions 
underline important differences between the poorest and richest states in Mexico, highlighting 
the importance of reducing extreme poverty as well as the shared prosperity agenda. This new set 
of poverty indicators will also serve as initial indicative reference points to assess the impact of 
the policies and programs proposed in this strategy. 
3. 
Mexico’s extreme poverty line is higher than the World Bank’s extreme poverty line 
marker of US$1.25 per day. As of March 2012, the monthly food poverty line, also called 
“minimum well-being” (bienestar económico mínimo), was equivalent to approximately US$4.0 
per day in urban areas and US$2.9 per day in rural areas at purchasing power parity. The 
implication is that using the World Bank’s measure places 4.4 percent of the population below 
the extreme poverty line, while using Mexico’s monetary measure of extreme poverty places 
approximately 20 percent of the population below the official minimum well-being line. In 
contrast, in using the Mexican official multi-dimensional measure, which includes both monetary 
and non-monetary well-being, 9.8 percent of the population would be below the poverty line. 

1 

 
 
Profile and Trends 
4. 
Monetary poverty rose between 2006 and 2012, breaking a decade-long trend of 
poverty reduction in Mexico. A long-term view using data spanning two decades of monetary 
measures of poverty shows that monetary poverty rates in 2012 are similar to the rates in 1992: 
the net reduction of moderate and extreme poverty was only 0.8 and 1.7 percentage points, 
respectively, over 20 years (Figure 1). 
5. 
Between 2006 and 2012 the extreme poverty rate (food poverty or pobreza 
alimentaria) increased from 14.0 percent to 19.7 percent (affecting 23.1 million people). 
Extreme poverty increased significantly during the period 2006-08 (when the affected population 
increased by 4.7 percentage points) and stagnated in the years after, hovering around 19 percent. 
Until 2006, Mexico kept pace with the region in poverty reduction. Nevertheless, since 2008 the 
economy suffered a series of shocks — food price crisis, global financial crisis, the AH1N1-flu 
epidemic — that slowed economic growth and reversed the reduction in monetary poverty. 
6. 
The multi-dimensional measure, which allows for a more nuanced and complex view 
of poverty, shows a decline in extreme poverty. 2 According to this measure, extreme poverty 
declined from 11.3 percent to 9.8 percent between 2010 and 2012 (Figure 2). This measure not 
only gauges extreme and moderate poverty but also calls attention to the vulnerable population. 
Vulnerability of incomes (people with no lack in basic needs but insufficient income) 
represented 6.2 percent of the population in 2012, a 0.3 percent increase from 2010. 
Vulnerability by social needs (those with earnings above the poverty line but without access to at 
least one basic service) reached 28.6 percent, slightly higher than the 28.1 percent in 2010. Only 
19.8 percent of Mexicans did not suffer either earnings or basic services gaps in 2012 (Table 1). 
These numbers indicate very little mobility (i.e., families exiting poverty or vulnerability and 
entering the middle class). A recent World Bank study finds that Mexico is one of the countries 
in the region with less income mobility and whose low economic growth is associated with little 
growth of the middle class. 3

7. 
The decline in multi-dimensional poverty is due to increasing access to almost all the 
social rights included in the measure, particularly healthcare; but the rise of its monetary 
component indicates that labor market opportunities for earning a living are still limited. 
The largest statistically significant improvement was in access to health care, where 8.2 million 
more people gained access (Table 1). The only social deprivation for which the share of the 
population increased was access to social security. The increase in the deprivation to social 
security arises mainly from the lack of access among the population in the labor force.

Gender, Ethnicity, and Regional Disparities 
8. 
Gender and ethnicity specific estimates indicate important differences across 
groups. From 2010 to 2012, the extreme poverty rate of the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index 
was equally reduced among men and females by 1.5 percentage points. However, in 2012, there 
were 1.5 million fewer men than women living in moderate poverty; but 300,000 more women 
than men live in extreme poverty. Poverty among the indigenous population has fallen faster, but 
their poverty levels remain higher than among non-indigenous population. Extreme poverty 
among indigenous population decreased 7.2 percentage points, lifting more than 800,000 people 
out of poverty. Despite this progress, 8.2 million indigenous people still live in poverty, of which 
3.5 million are among the extreme poor (Figure 3).  
9. 
Eliminating extreme poverty is a critical challenge in Mexico’s poorer states. The 
national rate of extreme poverty masks important regional differences. Chiapas, Guerrero, and 
Oaxaca have extreme poverty rates of 32.2, 31.7, and 23.2 percent, respectively. These are more 
than 10 times higher than the poverty rates of Nuevo Leon, Distrito Federal, and Baja California 
(2.4, 2.5, and 2.7, respectively). One out of 3 Mexicans in poverty lives in Chiapas, Guerrero, or 
Oaxaca (Figure 4). Around 23.5 million Mexicans or 20 percent of Mexico’s population live 
below the official line of minimum well-being of less than US$4.0 a day in urban areas and 
US$2.9 in rural areas. This national average contrasts with the high dispersion of poverty rates 
over the territory: 14 states out of the 32 have populations with monetary extreme poverty rates 

3 

above the 30 percent mark. This indicates that Mexico has been able to increase the coverage of 
social goods and services like basic education and health but labor market opportunities for 
earning a living are still very limited.

Shared Prosperity Indicators 
10. 
Regional disparities highlight the importance of promoting shared prosperity in 
Mexico. For the period 2010-12, Mexico’s income growth for the bottom 40 percent population 
had an average annual increase of 2.3 percent, higher than the income growth of 0.6 percent for 
the total population (Figure 5). The increase did not compensate the drop between 2008 and 2010 
when income growth of the bottom 40 percent decreased slightly more than the total population 
(2.4 percent compared to 2.9 percent). Looking at the entire period 2008-12, the average income 
growth of the bottom 40 percent was negative (but the decline was less pronounced than for the 
overall population). These recent trends in shared prosperity are accompanied by a reduction of 
income inequality for the period 2010-2012. 
11. 
Looking at shared prosperity by gender or ethnicity shows important differences. 
The bottom 40 percent of female-headed households experienced negative growth in all periods 
considered (Figure 6). Between 2008 and 2010, the bottom 40 percent of the indigenous 
households were severely affected as incomes decreased by 7.6 percent. However, this group 
was able to fully recover the following period when its income increased by 10.6 percent.

Global Comparisons  
12. 
Using the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, only 4.4 percent of Mexico’s 
population lived in extreme poverty in 2012. The extreme poor account for 5.2 million 
Mexicans and represent around 0.5 percent of the global population in extreme poverty. 
Eradicating extreme poverty in Mexico would have a small, though not unimportant, impact on 
the WBG’s global target of reducing extreme poverty by 2030.  

13. 
Despite 
its 
limited magnitude, 
extreme poverty, defined by US$1.25 per 
day, is a stark reality in some Mexican 
states. Using the US$1.25 line (equivalent to 
around Mex$335 per month at 2012 nominal 
prices), extreme poverty rates range from 15.2 
and 11.9 percent in Oaxaca and Chiapas, 
respectively, to virtual elimination rates of 1.6 
or 0.7 percent in Nuevo Leon and Distrito 
Federal, respectively. Actually, 41 percent of 
the Mexican population in extreme poverty 
resides in Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca 
(Figure 7). This 
reality highlights 
the 
importance of a subnational perspective when 
aiming at eliminating extreme poverty.

B. 
Challenges in Poverty Reduction and Promotion of Shared Prosperity  
14. Mexico has achieved remarkable economic and social progress over the past two 
decades; yet poverty reversed its downward trend, and inequality has leveled off at very high 
levels since 2006. Therefore, in order to influence Mexico’s poverty and inequality measures, 
policy interventions ought to affect productivity to influence earnings; inclusiveness to make 
sure that the poor have access to health, education and social security; and sustainability so that 
expansion of urban development and basic utilities does not deteriorate Mexico’s resource base. 
Making use of comprehensive country analysis prepared by World Bank staff in 2012 
(http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/research/all) this strategy categorizes four main 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
challenges to reduce extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity: (a) increase productivity 
and ensure that gains are widespread; (b) ensure that poorer segments of society benefit from 
basic social services and contribute to economic growth; (c) strengthen public finances and 
government efficiency; and (d) combine economic and environmental aspects of sustainable 
development. 4 
15. Mexico’s solid macroeconomic management stands out in a global environment of 
higher volatility and lower growth. Economic activity fully recovered from the severe 
contraction experienced following the global financial crisis and continued growth of exports, 
domestic investment and consumption managed to close the output gap by the end of 2012. A 
track-record of prudent monetary and fiscal policies provided the framework, confidence and 
buffers required for a rapid rebound of economic activity. More recently, a global slowdown, 
aggravated by the impact of fiscal consolidation and a slow start of public investment led to a 
significant deceleration of economic growth in Mexico widening the output gap again. This 
deceleration bodes for a low GDP growth of around 1.5 percent in year 2013, with relatively 
stable exchange rates, inflation and current account deficits (Table 2). Economic growth is 
expected to recover in 2014 following strengthening of external demand and the implementation 
of monetary and fiscal policies in support of economic activity. 5

16. 
Despite excellent short-term macroeconomic management during the 2009-10 global 
financial crisis, slow long-run productivity growth and lack of convergence remain serious 
problems. Mexico has enjoyed macroeconomic and financial stability, market-oriented 
economic policy reforms, openness to foreign trade and investment, and a “demographic bonus” 
through a growing working-age population. But it has not had sustained high-growth rates, 
failing to close the gap with high-income economies. Over the past decade, the economy grew at 
less than 2 percent annually, well below the regional average of 4 percent. Its per capita income 
has remained at about 30 percent of that of the U.S. By comparison, East Asia Tigers’ per capita 
income tripled over the past three decades and is currently about 60 percent of that of the U.S. 
(Figure 8). 
17. Mexico’s 
trailing productivity growth partially explains 
its slow 
income 
convergence. The country’s growth has largely been driven by capital and labor accumulation 
and not by growth in productivity, measured by either average output per worker or combined 
efficiency of labor and capital. While physical capital accumulation rates are within a reasonable 
range by international standards, productivity growth is lacking.  Productivity collapsed during 
the 1980s and regained some ground since the early-nineties, but slow productivity growth and 
recurrent shocks—in 1995, 2001 and 2009—have prevented productivity to recover to its former

levels. The economic literature offers many explanations for low productivity growth, all of 
which are relevant in the Mexican context: inequality, underdeveloped financial system, 
regulatory barriers for doing business, uncompetitive markets for utilities, weak innovation and 
limited market competition, labor market rigidities, and scarce skilled labor.

18. High inequality and persistent poverty hamper productivity and are in turn 
perpetuated by low productivity. Inequity of opportunity in access to key economic and social 
services (such as education, credit, and infrastructure) prevents a large segment of the population 
from fully realizing their economic potential. This reduces productivity, slows growth, and 
perpetuates existing poverty and income inequality. Breaking this vicious circle is difficult and 
requires an integrated reform agenda focused on mutually reinforcing economic and social 
objectives. 
19. 
A comprehensive structural reform agenda is needed to help boost productivity. 
Mexico’s financial sector is small for the country’s stage of development, impeding the 
channeling of financial savings into long-term productive investments. Commercial bank credit 
to the private sector is well below the level in countries with similar characteristics and below the 
regional average, and half the population still does not use financial services. Concentrated 
markets, restrictive regulation, and anticompetitive behavior hamper firm productivity and 
economic growth, with some estimation placing such costs at 1 percentage point of GDP growth 
each year. 6 Productivity is also constrained by the low quality of education and inefficient 
matching of workers and firms. The sector composition of jobs has changed over the past 
decade, with a decline in the share of employment in the tradable sectors and a rise in the 
services sector, where informality and low productivity jobs concentrate. 7 Mexico has achieved 
near universal primary school completion and over the past decade the performance of Mexican 
students on the PISA international learning test (measuring largely cognitive skills) has 
improved, but it still lags behind its Latin American and OECD peers. 8  
20. 
Faster productivity growth will also require improvements in infrastructure, 
particularly in telecommunications and trade logistics. Mobile phone penetration is one of the 
lowest in the Latin America, and fast broadband is scarce and expensive. Mexico also needs to 
increase digital literacy to close the digital divide. The recent National Digital Plan has four axes 
for tackling challenges in this area: e-government, innovation in ICT, citizen participation, and 
open data. With regard to trade, low investment in ports and logistics has resulted in a 

7 

 
 
diminished capacity to support trade. Mexico ranks 47th on the overall Logistics Performance 
Index, with weak score on customs, but also low score on infrastructure, logistics competence, 
and international shipments. Logistics costs as percentage of GDP are 14 percent in Mexico, 
while for OECD economies this percentage is less than 10 percent. 
21. 
In addition to addressing challenges for faster productivity growth, reforms in social 
policy are also needed for reducing poverty and inequality. Despite recent progress, social 
protection faces important equity and efficiency challenges. Mexico’s social protection system 
includes contributory social security schemes, social assistance, and labor market programs. But 
the system suffers from fragmentation, weak design, and coverage gaps. Labor market programs 
overlap and are duplicative. Three health insurance programs operate in parallel with little 
coordination. 9 The social protection system lacks a range of mechanisms to mitigate the impact 
of economic shocks; and those that do exist are under-utilized by the poor. More coverage in 
services for employability and intermediation, unemployment protection, and pension systems 
are also needed. Furthermore, expenditure in some social programs such as contributory 
pensions, agriculture development and gasoline subsidies are markedly regressive. Finally, 
gender gaps in areas ranging from economic opportunities, prevention of violence and equal 
treatment and rights, can still experience much improvement (Box 1 and Annex 6). 
Box 1. Gender Issues in Mexico 

In the last decade, much progress has been made toward greater gender equality in Mexico. 
Between 2005 and 2010 the average years of schooling went up from 7.9 to 8.4 for women and from 8.4 
to 8.7 for men. The proportion of women in the House of Deputies has increased from 17.4 percent in 
2000 to 36.8 percent in the 2013. Equal treatment and rights, non-violence, public expenditure, awareness 
of unpaid household work, and political participation are issues incorporated into the public agenda. 
However, despite progress in promulgation of laws and budget increases to enhance gender 
equality, major issues still need to be addressed. Maternal mortality is also a persistent public health 
issue in Mexico with slow progress in alleviating the problem (from 60 deaths per 100,000 live births in 
2002 to 51 in 2010). Between 2006 and 2011 the incidence of violence against women perpetrated in their 
last relationship increased from 43.2 percent to 46.1 percent in spite of public actions to combat it.   
This CPS will support the implementation of the NDP agenda on gender equality. Given its cross-
cutting nature, the package of development solutions on gender will bridge the different themes of this 
CPS. 10 Knowledge products will benchmark, diagnose, and make policy recommendations for furthering 
gender equality related to productivity, social protection, and environmental policy. Conferences, 
seminars, and other dissemination and knowledge exchange activities will follow. Financing activities 
might also materialize provided there is client demand. Key initial efforts will be focused on assisting 
federal, state, and municipal agencies responsible for gender issues. Preliminary contacts are under way 
with Chiapas to develop a package of development solutions to accompany their state gender initiative. 

22. 
Addressing the challenges of ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity 
require a well-funded and effective government. Mexico’s falling oil revenues and rising 
public spending needs require increased tax revenue and more efficient and better targeted public 
spending. An integral fiscal reform is needed that broadens the tax base, narrows special regimes 
or preferential rates, and generates information flows that facilitate tax compliance and boost tax 
revenue. On the expenditures side, three main areas need special attention: (a) increasing 
transparency; operational efficiency and progressivity of public expenditures; (b) improving 
public sector performance through better budget and financial management; and (c) adopting a 
systemic coverage of pending risks (e.g., natural disasters, commodity prices variation, and 
subnational fiscal distress). 11 

8 

23. 
Three challenges related to tax collection, federal transfers, and risk vulnerability 
deserve special attention. First, tax collection is insufficient. If federal and local taxes and 
social security are included, Mexico has the lowest fiscal pressure among OECD member states 
and is among the lowest compared to similar Latin American countries. Second, dependence on 
federal transfers amounts to about 90 percent of subnational public revenue. This imbalance has 
lessened the states’ incentives to raise their own revenue and has led some to financial distress 
because of excessive, sometimes unregistered debt. Third, budgetary disruptions due to growing 
global risks are likely. Public finances are vulnerable to a variety of shocks related to national 
and international macroeconomic fluctuations, demographic contingencies, and natural disasters. 
Around 41 percent of Mexico’s territory and 31 percent of its population are exposed to 
hurricanes, storms, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. In economic terms, 70 percent of 
GDP is considered to be at risk from two hazards or more. The 2011 World Bank study, Social 
Dimensions of Climate Change in Mexico, shows that 70 percent of the poorest 125 
municipalities are highly prone to hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods and hurricanes.  
24. 
Environmental policy must also be an integral part of Mexico's development agenda 
as a means to support the well-being of current and future generations. Natural resource 
capital — forests, protected areas, agricultural lands, energy, and minerals — is an important 
contributor to Mexico’s wealth. Natural resources support economic activities representing at 
least 11 percent of Mexico’s GDP. They are an important source of jobs and support the 
livelihoods of millions of people, including rural populations. Environmental degradation and 
depletion of natural resources in Mexico have an economic cost equivalent to roughly 6.3 
percent of GDP. Environmental degradation includes air and water pollution, soil degradation, 
and solid wastes. In most cases, these costs are primarily borne by vulnerable groups, including 
young children, the elderly, and the rural poor. As Mexico grows and industrializes, demands on 
common property natural resources such as water and forests will also continue to rise. 
Moreover, in terms of the environmental footprint of the urban economy, a number of policy 
challenges still remain in the areas of land use planning, waste collection, urban pollution, and 
energy efficiency. 12  
25. Mexico is highly vulnerable to climate change, which is anticipated to exacerbate the 
country’s development challenges. World Bank studies estimated that climate change could slow 
down the pace of poverty reduction by 2.4 percentage points by 2030, meaning an extra 2.9 
million people would remain in poverty. The consequences of climate change will vary across 
social groups and throughout the country’s territory, depending on factors such as exposure to 
hazards and climatic variability, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Poor and indigenous groups 
who depend on climate-sensitive sources of income could suffer the most significant impacts.  
26. 
As one of the largest contributors of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Latin America, 
Mexico has adopted an ambitious plan to drive down greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Figure 
9). Mexico ranks 12th in the world in CO2 emissions (471.46 million tons). The climate change 
agenda includes a partnership with the states as well as the recently approved General Climate 
Change Bill (Ley General de Cambio Climático), which calls for a 30 percent CO2 reduction by 
2020 and a 50 percent reduction by 2050 (compared with 2000 level). Mexican cities, which 
account for more than 84 percent of the country's GDP, generate 75 percent of the country’s 
GHG emissions. Therefore, Mexico has made significant investments to improve air quality in 
cities. Sulfur content in fuels has been significantly reduced over the last decade while an 
increasing number of cities and metropolitan areas have adopted an air quality program 
(PROAIRE) with targeted measures to arrest air pollution. In addition, improved vehicle 

9 

technologies have helped reduce emissions. However, these trends have been offset by the 
staggering increase of private vehicle ownership which rose by more than 50 percent, from 13.4 
million in 2004 to 21.6 million in 2010.13 
Figure 9. Mexico is a large contributor to global CO2 emissions, mostly driven by the 
energy sector (including transport, energy generation and industry)

27. 
Energy subsidies arguably constitute the most important market impediment for a 
transition to a green-growth development pathway. Between 2005 and 2009, subsidies of 
electricity, diesel, gasoline, and liquefied petroleum gas averaged Mex$200 billion per year 
(around US$18 billion per year). Fuel subsidies result in inefficient use of electricity and fuel and 
are regressive: the richest 20 percent of Mexicans — who own most of the cars and electrical 
equipment — receive 55 percent of the subsidy while the poorest 20 percent receive only 3.4 
percent. Removing energy subsidies alone could increase GDP by 1.5 percent by 2030. 14 
28. 
A comprehensive system for tracking and monitoring progress on environmental 
issues needs to be developed. Mexico’s leadership and early efforts at developing green-focused 
GDP accounts are steps in the right direction, but the remaining challenges are to: (a) strengthen 
available measures for each sector (physical and economic indicators of environmental 
progress); (b) build on green-focused GDP accounts and valuation of natural assets 
methodologies, particularly the Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services 
(WAVES), to guide macroeconomic and sector policies; and (c) ensure public availability of 
information on indicators and trends so that constituencies can play a role in demanding 
improvements in environmental management and demanding accountability for governmental 
efforts to address clearly defined environmental priorities.  
29. 
Development Challenges and Framework for WBG Engagement. Overcoming these 
complex development challenges demands implementing a series of parallel policies. Achieving 
the goals of reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity calls for policies that 
simultaneously foster productivity growth, social inclusiveness and fiscal/environmental 
sustainability. Some of these policies, such as structural reforms in education, energy, 
telecommunications and public finance, are already being put forward by the Government of 
Mexico (see also Section II). This CPS defines, after a careful selectivity process explained in 
section III, a series of tailored engagements which allow for the WBG to play an effective role in 
reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. These areas of engagement, 
described in more detail in section IV, range from activities to strengthen social protection and 
financial inclusion to activities enhancing public sector modernization, competitive and 
innovative business environment, environmental protection, and upgrading infrastructure.

II. GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO VISION 

30. 
President Enrique Peña Nieto assumed office in December 2012 for a six-year period. His 
administration has launched an ambitious reform program buttressed by a principles agreement, 
the Pact for Mexico. Signed in December 2012 by the Mexican Government and the three largest 
national parties, the Pact is a political agreement comprising a list of policy proposals ranging 
from democratic governance to economic growth, security, transparency, and rights.  
31. 
In its initial months, the new administration has presented to Congress a series of 
reforms in telecommunications, education, financial services, public finance and energy. All 
these reforms aim at addressing several of the development challenges described in the previous 
section. A telecommunications reform, approved in March 2013, introduced a series of measures 
to increase competition and access to information in the telecommunication markets. An 
education reform, approved in August 2013, aims at increasing the quality of public education by 
improving the selection, training and evaluation of teachers. A financial sector reform, approved 
in September 2013, includes a package of several laws aiming at consumer protection, access to 
financial services, development banking, and protection to creditors and strengthening the 
institutional framework of the stock exchange. The Government announced a fiscal reform 
package including reforms in the tax and social security systems. The reform contains a series of 
measures to increase revenues through more efficient and progressive taxation, as well as the 
introduction of unemployment insurance and a means-tested pension. The forthcoming reform in 
the energy sector, aims at increasing investment in the oil sector. Finally, to prompt economic 
growth, the fiscal reform also includes a provision for fiscal deficits in years 2013 and 2014. 
These counter-cyclical deficits, scheduled to taper off in subsequent years, together with a large 
infrastructure program are expected to increase productive investment and accelerate growth. 
All these reforms are done within the framework of the comprehensive six-year 
32. 
National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-18, launched in May 2013. The NDP's goals, 
objectives, strategies, and action plans were defined through a broad consultation process 
conducted in early 2013. The public and open consultation process made use of various media 
and fora and included events at the national and state levels with focus on special groups such as 
youth, women, people with disabilities, indigenous peoples, local legislators, local mayors, and 
federal entities. For each goal, the plan makes a self-diagnosis of the main challenges that 
impinge on achievement and the strategies that the Government intends to adopt. Specific targets 
and indicators provide some elements for benchmarking the advances of the NDP. 
33. 
The overarching vision of the NDP is helping Mexico achieve its greatest potential 
by focusing on five national pillars: (a) achieve peace; (b) make Mexico more inclusive; (c) 
improve the quality of the education system; (d) promote prosperity; and (e) consolidate Mexico 
as a responsible international player. The NDP also adopts three cross-cutting strategies: 
democratize productivity to integrate Mexicans into the formal economy; close and modern 
government by simplifying procedures and regulations; and a gender perspective to ensure the 
rights of women and prevent gender differences from becoming a source of inequality. 
34. Mexico in Peace. Mexico in peace aims at improving areas ranging from public security 
and governance to the judicial system, national defense, and human rights. The NDP identifies 
criminal activity linked to drug trafficking as a serious challenge to development, albeit this 
problem is not generalized at the country level but focused in a few regions. A more widespread 
problem is violence in the family, particularly against women, as well as a generalized public 
perception of slow and sometimes corrupt judicial and police institutions. The NDP identifies 

11 

several key interventions for the peace objective. These interventions include creation of better 
education and employment opportunities for the youth; policies to prevent violence against 
women, boys and girls; and policies boosting confidence in the judicial and police institutions 
through promotion of the new justice system that would deliver more humane, agile, efficient, 
and accessible justice to all people.  
35. 
Inclusive Mexico. There are growing public health problems, such as obesity and 
hypertension, and there is a growing number of youth who neither study nor work. The Mexican 
social security system will face mounting financial pressures to tackle these problems. Inclusive 
Mexico focuses on Government actions to guarantee social rights and close inequality gaps that 
divide the country. It includes initiatives to: (a) guarantee social rights to its population; (b) 
strengthen social participation in community development, and protect the rights and inclusion of 
people with disabilities; (c) secure the right to national social services particularly to vulnerable 
populations; (d) increase access to social security by promoting a sustainable system of universal 
coverage; and (e) promote a sustainable urban development model and promote regional 
development and housing markets. 
36. Mexico with Quality Education. The NDP recognizes universal coverage in basic 
education, but a lag in quality hinders advances in secondary education. Moreover, there is need 
for a closer connection between the skills that the education system provides and the demands 
from society. This is even more acute in the case of science and technology and its relation to 
innovation and business creation. The NDP indicates that these challenges require decisive 
public investments in infrastructure for schools, universities, cultural centers, and sports 
facilities. Quality teachers and instructors are an essential complement to these investments. The 
NDP seeks to build human potential for innovation with quality education based on initiatives to: 
(a) strengthen teacher professionalization, modernize infrastructure, and promote ICT in the 
teaching process; (b) guarantee an inclusive education system; (c) increase access to culture and 
sports as a means of integral citizen development; and (d) promote ICT and innovation. 
37. 
Prosperous Mexico. While highlighting the effective macroeconomic management that 
has distinguished Mexico in recent years, the NDP also highlights the need for improving the 
performance of sectors such as finance, mining, agriculture, telecommunications, and energy. 
The expansion and modernization of these sectors are a necessary condition for promoting 
employment creation and regional development. Prosperous Mexico seeks to increase prosperity 
and growth prospects by improving productivity. Its specific actions seek to: (a) maintain 
macroeconomic stability, including managing external risks; (b) promote access to finance; (c) 
promote quality employment; (d) promote inclusive green growth that generates income, 
competition, and employment; (e) promote affordable access to energy and telecommunication 
services; (f) provide incentives for the development of a competitive internal market; (g) 
promote and strengthen entrepreneurship and small and medium-size businesses; and (h) 
promote investments and competitiveness of the mining, infrastructure, transport, agriculture and 
tourism sectors. 
38. Mexico as an International Responsible Actor. Mexico can increase its development 
potential and competitiveness by promoting an active and effective foreign policy. The NDP 
highlights three main areas of interest: (a) fostering global governance; (b) promoting foreign 
trade and investment; and (c) protecting international migrations. The NDP indicates the use of 
international agreements and institutional development as the main instrument for addressing 
these areas. Mexico played a strong global role chairing the G20 and is pledging resources to the 
UN system and IDA replenishment. 

12 

III. WBG PARTNERSHIP: SELECTIVITY FILTERING PROCESS AND COUNTRY 
ENGAGEMENT MODEL 

39. 
The proposed WBG development solutions engagement with Mexico is based on a 
systematic filtering process to define priority action areas and consolidates past efforts toward a 
more strategic and integrated client engagement. The engagement model seeks to maximize the 
impact of a tailored package of WBG financial, knowledge, and convening services for 
promoting shared prosperity and reducing extreme poverty in a sustainable manner. The CPS 
builds on lessons learned in organizing development solutions around themes and flexible 
packages of services. It draws on the scope of collaboration among WBG organizations for each 
of these areas, based on each organization’s comparative advantage and client demand. Finally, 
the country engagement integrates the effort to share globally Mexico’s best practice experiences 
in several of these areas, such as conditional cash transfers and energy efficiency programs. 

A. Lessons Learned from Previous CPS 
40. 
The Mexico FY08-13 CPS Completion Report (Annex 2) highlights six lessons that are 
relevant for the design of the new strategy. 
41. Operational flexibility in packaging services. The FY08-13 CPS was designed to be 
flexible and innovative in responding to Mexico's financial and development needs. This 
flexibility allowed the Bank to respond expeditiously to the Government’s requests when the 
global economic downturn hit the country. The implementation of Mexico’s past country 
strategies reflect the initial transition to a more strategic and integrated client engagement that 
seeks to maximize the package of services offered by the WBG in multi-sector approaches. By 
retaining flexibility in its implementation, the CPS was able to improve alignment, operational 
efficiency, and impact through the use of more focused interventions and programmatic 
knowledge approaches, greater wholesaling resource and budget mobilization, real-time learning 
and adaptation, and exit of program areas where value added, comparative advantage, and impact 
was no longer aligned with the evolving program nor achievable.  
42. Working with subnational clients. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the 
State of Oaxaca proved to be a successful strategy to support the poorest states of Mexico. The 
MoU is serving to deepen dialogue, monitor implementation, and assess impact within the 
framework of a multi-year programmatic engagement. Hence, the Bank should continue to 
support poor states in Mexico following the experience with the State of Oaxaca (Annex 7). 
43. 
Continue to support Mexico’s role as a global knowledge leader. As an innovative 
middle-income country, Mexico engaged in 33 knowledge exchanges during the past CPS and 
has become widely recognized as a key global actor in climate change policy. The WBG should 
continue supporting the Government in exchanging knowledge with other countries. There is a 
strong potential for global knowledge brokering with the Bank as the global connector.  
44. World Bank, IFC, and MIGA cooperation. Bank–IFC cooperation on specific areas 
around their core competencies should improve effectiveness to achieving common goals in 
areas such as improving competitiveness and business climate, access to financial markets, and 
infrastructure development activities. MIGA engagement with Mexico is emerging, and Bank 
and IFC would work closely to support MIGA’s successful in-country transition. 
45. 
Lending instruments. During crisis periods, the use of the Additional Financing 
instrument led to simpler, faster, and more cost-effective results for the borrower, compared to 
other lending instruments. Development Policy Loans (DPL) were effective in sustaining 

13 

progress and protecting long-term reforms in the face of negative external shocks. Multi-
sectorwide approach (SWAP-type) operations (such as in infrastructure) may not be practical in 
the Mexico context since they require significant effort to design and supervise and may dilute 
the Bank’s ability to provide just-in-time policy advice and technical assistance. Governance and 
anti-corruption measures may limit the flexibility of quickly preparing and disbursing emergency 
operations (such as in the support to influenza) in countries with strong legal frameworks and 
adequate control environments.  
46. Knowledge services. Trust fund resources were indispensable in providing demand-
driven technical know-how and in strengthening coordination among key stakeholders and 
financed studies of often overlooked aspects, especially in environmental and social areas. 
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) are powerful instruments when processed quickly by the 
Bank and client. Having a framework agreement signed by the Government and the Bank would 
certainly facilitate their processing by avoiding the time-consuming task of negotiating sensitive 
clauses with each client within the government separately. Programmatic approaches showed to 
be remarkable instruments in focusing and prioritizing Bank interventions. Dissemination is 
required to share the findings of Bank studies at the local level.  
B. Consultations on FY14-19 CPS 
47. 
The CPS FY14-19 was developed in close consultation with the Government, private 
sector, academia, and civil society, comprising over 80 interlocutors. The meetings took place in 
September 2013 in Mexico City with participants representing stakeholders from several 
government ministries and agencies at various levels, trade unions, political parties, 
entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, and chambers of commerce at both the national 
and state levels. Consultations for the CPS were carried out while the new authorities were 
developing specific sector implementation plans and strategies that complement the NDP 2013-
18. This allowed the WBG to align its interventions with those of the authorities, ensuring that 
the development solutions proposed would have the greatest impact. Moreover, the CPS 
consultation process was driven by the need to work as One World Bank Group bringing 
together the IFC, IBRD and MIGA teams to harness expertise across the institution, and leverage 
public and private efforts when communicating with a wide range of groups.  The consultations 
suggest that most stakeholders value the WBG support. The Federal Government acknowledged 
the Bank’s partnership and flexibility in focusing at the subnational level (e.g., Oaxaca MoU) 
and confirmed its request to expand the subnational engagement to the States of Guerrero and 
Chiapas. The Government also highlighted the value of the CPS systematic effort at selectivity 
for highest impact of WBG activities on ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity in 
Mexico. Government officials described the WBG involvement as central in supporting the 
National Development Plan. Ministries and agencies also noted that the CPS is in close accord to 
and complements their own multi-annual programs.   
C. Approach to Dynamic Selectivity  
48. 
A systematic filtering process provides selectivity and improves alignment, 
efficiency, and impact. Three filters were used in selecting areas of engagement: (a) WBG 
comparative advantage; (b) level of client demand; and (c) alignment with WBG twin goals 
benchmarked by Mexico’s new Multi-dimensional Poverty Index. Starting from 
the 
Government's 37 pillar-based activities of the National Development Plan, a systematic filtering 
process led to identifying four thematic areas for WBG intervention (Figure 10). Within these 4 
themes, the WBG team focused on 11 specific areas of engagement (Table 3) and further 
identified 23 specific problem areas (Annex 1) on which the WBG is expected to have the 

14 

Figure 10. World Bank Thematic Focus Areas

greatest development impact. Following 
this 
logical chain, 
the CPS 
then 
describes 
the specific development 
solutions proposed (Annex 1). These 
consist of a tailored package of WBG 
financial, knowledge, and convening 
services for each of these problem 
areas, 
leading 
to 12 specific CPS 
expected outcomes.  
49. 
Targeted 
interventions 
on 
poorest States and frontier markets. 
Central to this engagement is working 
with both public and private sector 
clients in longer-term and multi-sector 
approaches at the federal level and with 
the poorest states (Oaxaca, Chiapas, 
and Guerrero) along the lines of the 
multi-sector WBG experience with the 
on-going State of Oaxaca program (Annex 7). Specific requests from other states will be 
assessed based on their impact on the key development challenges identified for the country, and 
significant parts of the knowledge activities provided to these states are likely to be financed 
though Reimbursable Advisory Services. IFC has a priority focus on frontier markers where 
there is significant poverty and perceived riskiness deters the private sector from investing to 
support inclusive growth.  
50. 
The selectivity approach helped in refocusing the country strategy and in identifying 
areas of engagement where the WB will be exiting as compared to the previous CPS:  
• Areas where the Bank is exiting, compared to the previous CPS, related to weak client 
demand and unsuccessful engagements in trade competitiveness, customs, judicial, and 
influenza support programs, leading to a reduced number of themes, outcomes and activities. 
The number of themes compressed from 5 to 4 and the number of outcomes declined from 28 
to 12 compared to the previous CPS.   
Increased selectivity of ongoing activities. More than half of the financial and knowledge 
services currently under implementation will close within two years (17 of the 25 ongoing 
projects and 12 of the ongoing 29 knowledge services will close in FY14 or FY15.). This 
CPS shifts 
the full knowledge and convening program 
to multi-year/multi-sector 
Programmatic Approaches with one common development objective aligned to CPS themes 
(e.g., in innovation strategies for poor states; in integrating social protection systems; in 
managing fiscal challenges; and in disaster risk management and urbanization). This 
approach would increase development effectiveness and reduce transaction cost. 
• New engagement is selective. A limited number of new financial services (loans, GEF, CTF) 
are currently foreseen for this CPS, concentrated in the green and inclusive growth, and the 
social prosperity themes (e.g., Oaxaca water, community education, and second generation 
Oportunidades). Only seven selective, high-impact Programmatic Approaches in support of 
CPS themes are currently in the pipeline. This is further supported by an increasing demand 
in Reimbursable Advisory Services, further strengthening the cost-benefit ratio of the 
knowledge portfolio.

51. 
Progress in achieving the goals of the strategy will be assessed with two progress 
reports and one completion report at the end of the CPS period. The results framework 
presented in Annex 1A sets out specific outcome indicators with baselines and targets covering 
the period of the CPS for each of the identified outcomes. A logical chain has been established 
from country-level goals, diagnostic of development challenges, WBG comparative advantage, 
and selective engagement relative to the WBG goals; and with clearly defined outcomes, 
indicators, and targets. Constant client dialogue, two Progress Reports and an annual Country 
Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR) covering the full package of services will allow for 
flexible adjustments of the strategy and results framework. Mexico has one of the best national 
monitoring, evaluation, and statistical systems among WBG client countries and is a knowledge 
leader in this area. Data availability and collection does not pose a risk to strategy monitoring. 

IV. WBG PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY: AREAS OF ENGAGEMENT 

52. 
This CPS FY14-19 shifts to a country engagement model based on a development 
solutions approach by delivering a customized package of WBG financial, knowledge and 
convening activities. This engagement model also packages all knowledge and convening 
activities into multi-year programmatic engagements. This aggregation of tasks with diverse 
sources of funding, including trust funds and RAS, emphasizes the synergies and linkages 
between the various WBG activities related to the solution of a specific development problem. 
Theme 1. Unleashing Productivity 
53. 
To increase productivity and ensure that such gains are widespread, focus should be 
placed on policies and programs that primarily benefit SMEs, foster new enterprise creation and 
innovation, and upgrade infrastructure. To these ends it is essential to: (a) foster sound financial 
sector development to facilitate access to finance to businesses and financial inclusion for 
individuals; (b) generate a competitive business environment to propitiate new enterprise 
creation in all sectors of the economy, specially network sectors shielded from competition; (c) 
foster innovation for productivity and competitiveness; and (d) upgrade infrastructure.  
Fostering sound financial sector development 
54. Mexico needs to broaden and deepen its financial system without compromising the 
financial stability gains of the last decade. Using the financial payments system to promote 
financial inclusion, improvements in financial infrastructure and capital market development are 
sound ways to broaden access and deepen the financial system. However, experience in several 
countries has shown that accelerated (or forced) expansion of credit can harm rather than benefit 
customers. If financial institutions do not follow sound practices, they can fail, harming 
borrowers and depositors alike and creating social unrest, with substantial fiscal cost. An 
oversight system (both micro- and macro-prudential) that encourages prudent risk-taking and 
facilitates prompt resolution of failed institutions ensures that strategies for financial deepening 
do not compromise financial stability. 
55. 
The WBG will continue supporting reforms to foster sound financial sector 
development, including the recently draft financial reform initiative. The World Bank will 
provide support for the implementation of the financial reform initiative through a programmatic 
knowledge engagement. The package envisions the reform of 34 laws and numerous secondary 
regulations in the areas of capital markets, public banks, financial infrastructure, and financial 
oversight. The Bank will also work with telecommunications industry to evaluate a pilot to bring 

17 

 
the use of mobile phone operated electronic wallets to isolated rural communities, which 
currently lack wireless phone access. Scale-up of the pilot is contingent on the evaluation results. 
IFC plans to increase its investment portfolio for financial institutions focused on MSME 
lending, niche banks and further penetrating non-bank financial markets (pension funds, 
insurance, capital markets). IFC is also seeking to support financial infrastructure through 
alternative channels such as mobile banking, and will continue to assist in the development of the 
capital markets enabling companies to access the local debt market. MIGA can provide 
guarantees to increase cross-border lending to local clients, including MSMEs. 
Toward a more competitive business environment 
56. 
Strengthening competition and streamlining key regulations for firms are key to 
increasing Mexico’s competitiveness and unleashing productivity. Firm-level productivity 
and business entry for formal enterprises in Mexico are low, relative to international peers. Low 
productivity is associated to firm size, with larger firms having much higher productivity levels 
than small ones. The large proportion of micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (about 98 
percent of all firms), together with the fact that they are not growing in size, is a drag on 
Mexico’s productivity. Factors that hinder productivity include burdensome business regulations, 
concentrated markets with dominant firms in strategic sectors, and lack of effective pro-
competition regulations. Such restrictions limit both firm entry and the growth of existing firms, 
increase the price of inputs, and reduce the overall economy’s competitiveness. Lack of 
competition reinforces existing inequities by affecting low-income households disproportionally.  
57. 
To contribute to unleashing productivity, the WBG will increasingly focus on 
supporting policies that favor SME growth through regulatory simplification and removal 
of regulatory competition barriers. In the next years, efforts will focus on the provision of a 
comprehensive package of services to improve regulatory frameworks at the national and 
subnational level with a special emphasis on eliminating anti-competitive regulations.  
Fostering innovation for productivity and competitiveness 
58. 
Several factors explain Mexico’s innovation shortfall. Mexico’s less than adequate 
competition, labor market rigidities, serious gaps in human resources, very limited financing for 
startups, lack of long-term financing to large companies, and weak links between the productive 
sector and knowledge institutions have all contributed to the innovation shortfall. Federal 
initiatives to promote innovation at the subnational level have not yielded all the desired results 
due to lack of capacity.  
59. WBG contribution to this topic concentrates in improving the coordination of 
policies aiming at taking innovations to firms in the productive sector and supporting 
private investments that boost innovation and productivity. IBRD has been supporting the 
Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) for a doctoral fellowship program and 
programs to encourage public–private collaborative research. Going forward, the Bank’s focus 
will shift to: (a) supporting the newly created SME agency (INADEM) to improve the 
effectiveness of programs to foster SME productivity and growth, with a focus on high-growth 
potential firms; and (b) supporting states with lower GDP per capita to develop a regional 
innovation strategy and regional capacities to access existing innovation funds and programs. 
From a sectoral perspective, the focus would be on improving innovation and technology 
extension in the manufacturing and agricultural sector. IFC will continue to support companies 
that innovate through technology, products, or processes, giving priority to investments related to 

18 

 
the production of value-added products in underdeveloped sectors in which Mexico has a 
competitive advantage and in companies with strong impact in the development of SMEs 
through the supply chain. Agribusiness is also a priority for IFC given its linkages and strong 
impact on SMEs in rural areas and because of its potential effect on the global food security 
problem. IFC also expects to increase its financing for Mexican companies investing overseas to 
achieve knowledge transfer, regional development, and growth. Finally, IFC, together with 
INADEM, is evaluating a pilot to set up a management company to invest and provide technical 
support to innovative early stage SMEs. MIGA can provide guarantees to foreign investors in 
local enterprises, which can act as a catalyst for local entrepreneurship. 
Upgrading infrastructure  
60. 
Raising the country’s productivity would require a comprehensive strategy to 
improve efficiency of key infrastructure services. This includes the rail and port sectors, 
public management arrangements and the role of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), and rules 
and procedures governing the entire breadth of the supply chain. Sector and institutional reforms, 
and substantial infrastructure investment should also be included in this program. To contribute 
to the competitiveness of the country, the IFC aims to continue supporting sectors that are 
opening further to the private sector, such as telecommunications where IFC can bring its global 
experience. In the case of the energy initiative currently under discussion, if the conditions are 
established, IFC could be a financing option to support long-term investments and local 
companies in the sector. 
61. 
If current IBRD capital limitations are eased during this CPS implementation 
period, the WBG could develop a substantial pipeline of financial services and innovative 
instruments with particular focus on infrastructure financing. This would be critical in the 
context of the financing alternatives for President Peña Nieto’s announced spending of US$316 
billion for a 6-year infrastructure program. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA will work jointly to maximize 
impact. MIGA can also support the infrastructure sector by attracting foreign participants in PPP 
processes and by facilitating financing of public projects through its Non-Honoring of Sovereign 
Financial Obligations (NHSFO) product. 
Theme 2. Increasing Social Prosperity 
62. 
To improve social prosperity and alleviate poverty, Mexico needs to promote labor 
markets and an integrated social protection system. The objective should be to increase wages 
through productivity growth and move toward a more efficient, effective, and integrated social 
protection system that will protect people from unexpected welfare losses, including those 
related to violence.  
Promoting labor markets for inclusive growth 
63. 
A crucial ingredient to alleviating poverty and promoting shared prosperity is 
higher wages through greater labor force productivity. Although wages grew slowly over the 
past 20 years, the economic crisis of 2009 reversed the gains; since then, Mexico has had 
difficulty regaining the wage growth. The related slow growth in labor income, the largest source 
of income for families, has not translated into poverty reduction and has limited shared 
prosperity. There is also a gender aspect to this, as fewer women than men are economically 
active (44 and 81 percent, respectively), and there is persistent occupational segregation and 
gender wage gaps. Women, however, work longer hours than men. 

19 

 
64. Measures to increase labor productivity may work through three channels: 
regulations, skills, and employment services. The first channel reduces labor market rigidities 
and increases the benefits of formality and incentives to employees who can invest in their own 
human capital and skills development that allows them to move into more productive jobs with 
low risk. The second channel raises the labor-market relevance and level of skills through a 
national skills strategy. This strategy maps labor-market skills acquisition throughout the life-
cycle; continued reorientation of upper-secondary school toward the labor market; and 
portability of skills across the education, training, and labor-market systems. In spite of 
continuous gains in education attainment rates, 43 percent of Mexican employers cited 
difficulties filling job vacancies, as compared to a global average of 31 percent. The third 
channel improves allocative efficiency of the labor force by facilitating job search and matching 
through integrated employment services and strengthening competency-based certification.  
65. 
A multi-year program of lending, knowledge, and convening services has supported 
the labor productivity agenda. Lending activities included the Compensatory Education 
Project, which supports the Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo (CONAFE) to expand 
quality early childhood development (ECD) services to the most marginalized municipalities in 
Mexico and the second phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 15 for the Quality Schools 
Project (PEC). These were accompanied by a richly laden program, including activities such as 
evaluating the impact of Mexico's teacher training program on student outcomes; an impact 
evaluation of an ECD program targeted at poor children living in marginalized areas; an 
evaluation of the school-based management models; and an analysis of the gap between the 
supply and demand for skills, both nationally and in the State of Oaxaca. 
66. 
The Bank will build on this program through new activities, including: (a) reforming 
the labor courts according to the recently approved labor law to lower labor costs; (b) improving 
the job relevance of education by strengthening and expanding the school-based management 
model, improving the reach of ECD services, further reforming the secondary education system, 
and implementing strategies to reduce upper secondary dropout and youth inactivity; (c) 
supporting labor market policies that improve the skills level, formality, and allocative efficiency 
of the labor force, including the National Employment System (Sistema Nacional de Empleo); 
and (d) promoting appropriate options for skills acquisition and school-to-work transition for the 
poorest youth under the Oportunidades program.   
67. 
In parallel, IFC expects 
to continue supporting skills development and 
employability by: (a) investing in private education providers that have a focus on viable and 
scalable models for low- and middle-income students; (b) supporting innovation by investing in 
new service delivery models to increase affordability and quality; and (c) leveraging WBG 
convening power to share best practice and foster partnerships. IFC’s education strategy in 
Mexico aims to expand equitable access to quality education and affordable costs leading to 
employment opportunities. MIGA can contribute to the effort by supporting projects related to 
education focusing on skills development for employment opportunities reaching underserved 
sectors, and projects in other sectors that will result in job creation and transfer of knowledge and 
skills. 
Promoting an integrated social protection system 
68. 
Although Mexico has been at the forefront in social protection policy, new reforms 
are needed to build on the gains achieved and reduce inequities and inefficiencies to begin 

20 

 
building a more inclusive, effective, and integrated social protection system that provides 
protection from income shocks and helps smooth consumption over the life-cycle. A potential 
hindrance to greater social progress is the difficult citizen security situation, which affects 
certain states. The development of a national and citizen security policy under the National 
Program to Prevent Crime is a first step in providing a framework for joint federal and 
subnational action. This policy should also include skills building and support to civil servants, 
public and private partners, and stakeholders in evidence-based crime and violence prevention 
methods; information systems to track criminal activity to identify hot-spots and to measure the 
impact of interventions; and investment in infrastructure and social services to establish a state 
presence in hot-spot communities.  
69. 
The WB is supporting efforts at designing and implementing second generation 
reforms in Mexico’s conditional cash transfer programs. Mexico’s two flagship social 
assistance programs are a good base toward a more inclusive, effective, efficient, and 
integrated social protection system. While Oportunidades and Seguro Popular (Régimen 
Estatal de Protección Social en Salud – REPSS) are recognized globally for their poverty 
alleviation and human capital development impacts, they represent programs and policies and 
not in themselves a system. To begin moving toward such a system, the WBG will provide 
support to:  
(a)  Develop a unified registry of beneficiaries, as a basis for a social protection system that 
provides information on how families are accessing any social security or assistance 
programs. This allows for proactive management to reduce duplication, improve efficiency 
of program administration (such as unifying cash payments from various programs into a 
single monthly payment), and link families to other eligible programs.  
(b)  Improve functioning of the health system (particularly primary health care) by strengthening 
the incentive and accountability framework between the Federal Government; the state 
through its fund holders, particularly Seguro Popular; and providers.  
(c)  Enhance inter-institutional links between the Oportunidades program and education, labor 
market, and ECD programs.  
(d) Support a transition of the health system from one that only responds to acute illness to one 
that also ensures prevention and control of chronic conditions (i.e., non-communicable 
diseases, particularly those related to obesity such as diabetes and heart disease).  
70. Migration is a potential new area of engagement. Net migration from Mexico to the 
United States, which formerly absorbed some excess labor, has declined rapidly between 2005 
and 2010, in part as a result of the impact of the crisis on the U.S. economy. The presence and 
transit of Central American migrants in southern Mexico is a long-standing concern for Mexican 
authorities. The implications of these migratory flows, both in terms of labor market 
performance and individual wellbeing, have prompted initial contacts with Mexican authorities 
that may lead to technical support in this area in future years. 
71. 
To promote an inclusive, effective, and integrated social protection system, IFC 
investments and advisory services will focus on supporting the private sector players 
engaged with the public sector in the delivery of social services. This will be done by 
supporting players who are currently or are planning to work with the public sector through PPPs 
for delivery of services; and by providing advisory work to local, state, or Federal Governments 
in the design and execution of PPPs to ensure a balance between the risks and benefits assigned 
to the private sector, in order for these partnerships to be financially feasible and bankable. Also 

21 

 
in this sector, MIGA can help support by attracting foreign participants in PPP processes and by 
facilitating financing of public projects through its Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial 
Obligation (NHSFO) coverage to potential foreign investors. 
Theme 3. Strengthening Public Finances and Government Efficiency 
72. 
To achieve faster growth, reduce extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity, Mexico 
needs to improve public service delivery. Mexico’s public service delivery is hindered by low 
tax collection and expenditure inefficiencies at all levels of government: federal, state, and 
municipal. Strengthening public finances in Mexico requires dealing with several challenges. On 
the income side, Mexico needs a comprehensive fiscal reform to alleviate the looming medium-
term pressures on its budget. This fiscal reform refers to both national and subnational public 
finance. On the expenditure side, Mexico needs to improve public sector performance, and 
expenditure quality and equity. The World Bank thematic engagement aims at: (a) managing 
medium-term fiscal challenges at national and subnational levels; (b) enhancing public service 
delivery; and (c) implementing an integrated sovereign risk management framework. 
Managing medium-term fiscal challenges at national and subnational levels 
73. 
The Bank has been supporting Mexico’s efforts to address its fiscal challenges and 
will continue to provide technical support for enhancing the federal tax revenue system. A 
team of international and Bank experts in tax systems is currently working with the Ministry of 
Finance (SHCP) through a three-year Programmatic Knowledge Service to study different policy 
options available to address fiscal pressures in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable way. 
Moreover, the Bank will provide support to the Mexican Tax Administration Office (SAT) 
through a program for evaluating tax administration and improving tax compliance through 
better controls of tax obligations and empirical studies regarding lawsuits. The Bank is also 
providing support through various trust funds to strengthen the institutional capacity of the 
Ministry of Public Administration (Secretaría de la Función Pública) to implement new internal 
control models and modern IT systems. 
74. 
Despite better 
targeting of social spending, some programs 
in Mexico 
disproportionally benefit the higher-income population deciles. Some programs are very 
progressive as the per capita public transfer falls with higher-income levels; others are less so as 
the per capita public transfer rises with higher-income levels. Examples of the former are 
conditional cash transfer programs (Oportunidades), temporary employment program (PET), and 
non-contributory pensions for the elderly. Examples of the latter are energy subsidies, VAT 
exemptions and zero rating, which are, in effect, non-targeted consumption subsidies. In the end, 
Mexico’s tax-benefit system does not improve income equality as much as in other OECD 
countries. Building on past diagnosis, the Bank will continue to provide technical support on 
monitoring and evaluating the design, impact, and distributive incidence of fiscal policies and 
social programs as well as providing recommendations for enhancing its progressivity. The Bank 
will also support the development of a methodology and quantitative estimates for a social 
discount rate, which will help the SHCP to better select investments and evaluate the return of 
social programs. 
75. 
The challenge of subnational public finance. Recent experience with the rapid increase 
in subnational borrowing and the lack of fiscal sustainability in some states has created a 
political momentum to move from a market discipline to a fiscal rules-based approach. 
Legislative proposals, currently under discussion in Congress, include a balanced budget 

22 

 
requirement at the subnational level, the oversight and possibility of intervention by the Federal 
Government in subnational public finances, as well as the ability of the Federal Government to 
extend a guarantee for specific subnational borrowings.  
76. 
In addition to the ongoing engagement with the Federal Government around the 
challenges of subnational public finance, the World Bank also provides technical support to 
subnational entities directly. As part of the growing engagement around this topic, the Bank 
also plans to develop a programmatic knowledge program to support SHCP in setting up a unit 
that will be responsible for the implementation and supervision required under the new 
subnational fiscal discipline and borrowing framework. The Bank is also providing support to 
strengthen the institutional capacity of public sector management in the States of Puebla and 
Oaxaca. Technical analysis of tax administration in Distrito Federal and management capacities 
in the State of Oaxaca initially done in 2011 is an ongoing reimbursable advisory service to these 
entities. 
Enhancing service delivery through better public sector management 
77. 
There has been good progress on three main fronts of the public sector 
modernization agenda in Mexico: (a) harmonizing accounting at the federal and subnational 
levels; (b) 
introducing performance-informed budgeting, a comprehensive Government 
Accounting System (SCG) and implementation of a single treasury account; and (c) building on 
the success of procurement reform in centralized government and sector delivery units to 
strengthen core public sector management functions. However, further actions are needed to 
strengthen those core functions, particularly at the subnational level. As experience from other 
countries shows, setting up a performance-informed system requires a culture change, with a 
new management style based on performance incentives; management delegation; and a focus on 
inputs, outputs, and outcomes. Currently World Bank support related to public sector efficiency 
includes financial services results-based management and budgeting.  
78. Knowledge products are enhancing public sector efficiency and effectiveness. Grants 
supporting an IT system at the supreme audit institution will function as a risk management tool 
and enhance professional competencies of its staff as well as strengthen the audit function with 
new tools and techniques. Technical support for strengthening management capacities is 
currently provided to the Federal Government, the National Congress, and the States of Oaxaca 
and Puebla. The World Bank is also providing technical support with the implementation of 
integrated financial management information systems (SIDAFF) to include financial accounting 
at different levels. Reimbursable services are planned to fund the next generation of procurement 
reforms, particularly in modernizing the government’s Compranet system and in raising 
standards of administrative procedures. Finally, as a means to respond to growing societal 
concerns about the efficiency and transparency of public expenditures, the Bank will support a 
public expenditure review in coordination with federal and subnational agencies.  
Implementing an integrated risk management strategy  
79. 
Exposure to risk at the sovereign level, which depends on both the external 
environment and internal conditions, is more efficiently managed within an integrated 
framework. The impact of external shocks can be amplified or reduced depending on the 
sovereign’s internal degree of exposure to the shocks. This in turn depends on the authorities’ 
proactive drive to identify and quantify the various types of risk, and to analyze them in an 
integrated and centralized manner so as to more efficiently manage this risk.  

23 

 
80. 
The Government of Mexico has increasingly addressed a number of direct and 
contingent risks. An important goal has been to meet the balanced budget target and avoid 
highly disruptive and costly adjustments during 
the annual budget 
implementation. 
Consequently, the Government has sought to diminish the vulnerability of public finances to a 
number of direct shocks and risks related to fluctuations in GDP growth; oil price volatility, as 
well as interest, exchange rate; and refinancing volatility and its impact on the debt and other 
financial portfolios. The Government has also addressed a number of potential or contingent 
sources of risk such as natural disasters, food price volatility and agricultural risk, climate 
change, and subnational governments in fiscal distress. In spite of continued strong progress in 
all its policy areas, a Fiscal Risk Management DPL of US$300.8 million in support of Mexico’s 
fiscal risk management policies was withdrawn on September 20, 2013 in the absence of its 
signature within eighteen months from the Board approval. A completion note is under 
preparation.  
81. 
The World Bank has been supporting the Government 
in dealing with 
environmental and economic risks through the delivery of an on-going comprehensive 
package of services for disaster risk management and by using IBRD financial risk 
management tools. Through the World Bank MultiCat (multiple catastrophe) Program and 
jointly with private sector partners, the Government has successively issued two parametric 
catastrophe bonds for US$290 million and US$315 million in 2009 and 2012, respectively. 
Forthcoming activities to address contingent fiscal risks more generally will include continued 
use of IBRD risk management tools on loan portfolio and non-IBRD liabilities (e.g., interest rate 
conversions and stand-alone interest rate swaps).   
The World Bank is also providing several knowledge services on risk management. 
82. 
A multi-year programmatic engagement in disaster risk management supports the Government of 
Mexico to build an effective disaster risk management strategy that balances risk identification; 
investments in risk reduction measures; efficient ex post reconstruction activities; and use of 
risk-financing tools, including risk transfer mechanisms. In addition, knowledge services are 
contributing to the design of a comprehensive agricultural risk management strategy by both 
evaluating Mexico’s current system and providing sound policy and program alternatives aimed 
at ameliorating processes such as risk identification; institutional risk management analysis; risk 
quantification and pricing; and utilization of innovative market-based risk financing tools, 
including risk transfer mechanisms.  
Theme 4. Promoting Green and Inclusive Growth 
83. Mexico’s significant natural resource capital, the high cost of environmental degradation, 
and the increasing risks posed by climate change highlight the importance of a green-growth 
agenda addressing critical policy concerns: the footprint of growth (externalities), including 
urban planning, solid waste management, energy efficiency; and managing natural assets under 
pressure–focusing on forest, biodiversity and water management, and renewable energy.  
Reducing the footprint of growth 
84. 
Fast urban development has been inefficient and needs to be greener. The fast 
urbanization rate (estimated at 77 percent) is car-oriented, inefficient, and not conducive to 
generating economies of scale in production, movements of labor and capital, and resource 
consumption. To address these issues, Mexico needs to focus on making urban development 
greener, more efficient and resilient, and socially inclusive. This can be initiated by: (a) 

24 

 
reviewing housing policies to develop compact spaces that are both efficient and livable; (b) 
providing urban layouts needed to promote public and non-motorized transport; (c) supporting 
the development of mass transit in appropriate corridors and creating a mobility strategy; (d) 
using land-based financing instruments to provide infrastructure in new low-income housing 
developments; and (e) integrating risk reduction policies in urban development instruments. 
85. 
Costs of land and water degradation due to solid and liquid wastes have been 
increasing each year, impacting human health, the environment, and the economy. The 
following areas require particular attention: (a) developing an integrated urban solid waste 
management strategy; (b) strengthening management capacity at municipal, state, and federal 
levels; (c) reviewing sector policies (including tariff system) that would allow cost recovery; (d) 
developing waste reduction and recycling awareness campaigns; (e) developing sound social 
inclusion plans for waste pickers; (f) addressing problems posed by hundreds of contaminated 
sites and planning for their closure and redevelopment; and (g) exploring the potential of waste 
to energy schemes. 
86. 
Enhancing energy efficiency is also a key element in promoting low carbon 
development for the country. Necessary actions include: (a) promoting the adoption of energy 
efficiency labels and standards in housing, transport, and small businesses; (b) encouraging a 
greater private sector participation in the development of industry-wide efforts to increase energy 
efficiency, as well as in the creation of commercial options to finance energy-efficiency 
initiatives; (c) strengthening regulation in the energy sector for a commercially oriented and 
more efficient operation in PEMEX and Federal Electricity Commission (CFE); and (d)  phasing 
out energy subsidies. 
87. 
The World Bank has a very robust program to support the reduction of the 
footprint of growth. In financing services, an ongoing project is supporting bus rapid transit 
solutions in cities and states, complemented by the Government’s Programa de Transporte 
Masivo (PROTRAM), which provides technical support to the same target clients in the design 
of comprehensive urban transport plans. Funding from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) is 
supporting the acquisition of clean technology buses, enhancing the scope of the project not only 
to improve mobility but also to reduce GHG emissions. A GEF grant is supporting several 
Mexican cities in their efforts for clean air, and a carbon finance operation is supporting 
improvements to the Corredor Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Mexico City. 
Another GEF grant is providing state-of-the-art knowledge to Mexico City on initiatives to open 
data in transport and supply-side schemes to reduce trips in heavily congested areas of the city. 
Reimbursable Advisory Service to support Mexico’s national urban transport strategy was 
completed recently, and further advisory work is possible.  
88. 
The Bank is also building on a long partnership with the Government in the housing 
sector to support its current efforts to increase densities in urban areas. In particular, the 
Bank will be launching in FY14 a programmatic approach that will include an urbanization 
review, a diagnostic of the main urban challenges in the country, and recommendations to inform 
a national urban policy. The programmatic approach will also include a Reimbursable Advisory 
Service in housing policy to improve the efficiency of subsidy programs, to strengthen rental 
markets and construction finance, and to increase the dynamism of the secondary market. 
89. 
The Bank has launched a diagnostic of key issues and players in solid waste 
management with the longer-term objective of supporting a national program. This 

25 

 
program could help cities in the formulation of coherent and comprehensive strategies as well as 
specific projects and financing mechanisms to manage solid waste and contaminated sites. The 
goal is to cover the entire cycle from reduction, recycling, generation, collection, disposal, and 
possible transformation, using regional resources optimally.  
90. 
The World Bank foresees a rich program to support GHG emissions reduction. The 
ongoing Efficient Lighting and Appliances Project successfully supports government programs 
to reduce emissions by increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies at the residential level. 
The Bank also supports some states in the preparation of action plans to improve efficiency in 
city buildings. Four knowledge services are planned: (a) the preparation of National Appropriate 
Mitigation Actions on integrated urban mobility systems, refrigerators, and urban services; (b) 
the development of in-country capacity to design and implement projects capturing carbon 
dioxide from power generation and industrial installations and subsequent carbon capture and 
sequestration; (c) the implementation of strategies to reduce gas venting and flaring; and (d) a 
political economy assessment of the impact of reducing or phasing out energy subsidies.  
91. 
IFC’s contribution to reduce the footprint of growth involves both advisory services 
and direct financing. IFC covers mainly the following areas: (a) solid waste management 
activities and waste to energy projects; (b) a programmatic green buildings initiative and support 
to development of sustainable construction projects that follow international codes for energy 
and water efficiency; (c) energy efficiency-related projects and companies; and (d) urban 
mobility. IFC is engaged in the state of Puebla providing transaction advisory support to develop 
bus rapid transport routes in the form of PPPs. 
Using natural resources in an optimal way 
92. 
Despite their strategic environmental and social role, forests are subject to high 
degradation in Mexico. Policy options to reverse this negative trend include: (a) shifting funds 
from reforestation to community forestry and paying for environmental services; (b) 
strengthening advisory and monitoring systems; (c) fostering sustainable and competitive 
community enterprises; (d) developing approaches for forests with high biodiversity values but 
relatively 
low commercial value; (e) promoting cross-sector coordination and public 
participation in policymaking; and (f) developing a landscape approach to analyze forestry in the 
larger context of integrated rural development.  
93. 
Per capita water availability has decreased by an alarming factor of four in the last 
50 years. This situation is compounded by an inefficient use of water resources in agriculture as 
well as in urban services and exacerbated by the impact of climate change. Service quality is 
below OECD standards and cost recovery is extremely low. Critical actions include: (a) 
implementing an effective water financing system with incentives for an optimal use of water 
resources; (b) consolidating the information base for climate resilience, water management, and 
water sanitation and drainage services; (c) strengthening the enforcement of water rights; (d) 
improving the efficiency of water usage in the agriculture sector; (e) bringing efficiency and 
quality of urban services up to regional OECD standards; and (f) supporting local governments 
in the provision of works and sanitation services. The priorities of the government in the water 
sector will be identified in its National Water Plan (Plan Hídrico Nacional) being drafted.   In 
preliminary discussions with 
the current administration, 
the National Water Agency, 
CONAGUA, has indicated several priority areas in which is interested in partnering with the 
Bank, namely: (i) integrated urban water management; (ii) urban flood management; (iii) water 

26 

 
supply and sanitation utility reform beyond efficiency improvements; and (iv) resilience of 
infrastructure to extreme events and climate variability.  
94. 
The possibility of Mexico turning into a net oil importer poses the challenges of 
radically transforming the country’s energy matrix composition. Key options lie in further 
using renewable energy sources; involving the private sector in financing investments in 
renewable energy; and exploring the potential to expand geothermal, solar, and wind power. The 
WBG will continue supporting Mexico in these areas through a suite of financial, knowledge, 
and convening services. The Bank is preparing a knowledge programmatic approach that will 
include the topics of environmental legislation, environment-related public finance, and 
adaptation to climate change at state level. The Bank has also discussed the possibility of an 
Ecosystems-DPL to continue supporting government policies in climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. Ongoing GEF grants are promoting adaptation to the consequences of climate 
impacts in coastal watersheds and wetlands and promoting the conservation of priority biological 
corridors. A meteorological modernization project is supporting equipment, modeling, and 
forecasting capacity; and the upgrading of several regional centers. A forests and climate change 
project (REDD+) is supporting rural communities to sustainably manage their forests while 
reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. The Bank is also promoting the adoption 
of emission-reduction technologies in small and medium-scale agri-business. 
95. 
The World Bank is supporting the improvement of efficiency in water utilities 
through financial and knowledge services. In addition to an ongoing project in water-
efficiency improvement, the Bank is preparing a water and sanitation project in the State of 
Oaxaca covering regulatory issues as well as improvement of the quality, and sustainability of 
water services in rural and urban areas. Technical support at the state level is an emerging area of 
interest. The Bank has prepared a comprehensive analysis of the water financing system, an 
important input to ensure the sustainability of water provision in years to come. The Bank may 
provide a RAS, requested by the national water agency to prepare water basin diagnostic studies 
in order to develop a comprehensive water management system in the Mexico Valley.  
96. WBG projects on wind and solar energy, and combined solar-thermal cycles have 
helped the Government of Mexico break ground on renewables and energy diversification. 
A new GEF grant will help promote innovation in the development and implementation of clean 
energy technologies through Mexico's Sustainable Energy Fund.  
97. 
The World Bank is planning to launch a new multi-year knowledge and convening 
programmatic engagement in FY14 to address the need to institutionalize environmental and 
social safeguards with the objective of moving toward the use of country systems in the future. 
98. 
IFC is also contributing to the optimal management of natural resources. IFC 
financed the first utility-scale photovoltaic solar project in Latin America and expects that its risk 
taking in renewable energy will further unlock the potential of Mexico’s renewable power 
potential. Through its advisory and investment activities, IFC expects to strengthen its 
collaboration with the Mexican Infrastructure Fund to support municipal water operators in 
improving their operations and efficiency via PPP schemes. In forestry, the priorities are: (a) 
contributing to take pressure off natural forest for wood supply by supporting investment in 
commercial tree plantations; (b) increasing the sustainable use of already degraded land; and (c) 
supporting the expansion of certified forests. As an emerging player, MIGA can contribute to the 
effort by supporting foreign investments in carbon mitigating projects, waste management, water 

27 

 
treatment and delivery, renewable energy, and other efficiency-related sectors, as well as 
attracting private participants in PPP processes and financing of government-sponsored projects 
through NHSFO coverage. 

V. 

PORTFOLIO AND LENDING PROGRAM 

99. 
This CPS describes the Bank’s indicative engagement with Mexico as a partnership to 
achieve development results through a tailored package of financial, knowledge, and convening 
services. IBRD lending has remained an important part of this engagement throughout the years. 
However, Mexico is now approaching the single borrower limit (SBL) of US$16.5 billion. 
Mexico is the largest IBRD borrower with outstanding debt of US$14.78 billion as of September 
30, 2013, representing some 10 percent of IBRD’s total portfolio. After pre-paying some US$5 
billion during FY07 to bring down its exposure to US$4.1 billion, Mexico's exposure increased 
rapidly from FY08 with the unleashing of the global financial crisis and surge in IBRD lending: 
US$12.5 billion commitments in FY09-11 and decline in the size of repayments of loans 
following a large prepayment of loans in FY07.   
100. 
IBRD lending capacity will need to be increased. As Mexico approaches the SBL 
limit, the Bank's ability to further support Mexico's efforts to reduce poverty and enhance the 
incomes of the less well-off will be limited despite the increased demand for development 
finance. The WBG is engaging with the Mexican authorities on possible alternatives to position 
the Group within the Government’s new US$316 billion infrastructure program and in 
supporting subnational programs. In parallel, country management is ensuring the most effective 
use of the combined WBG balance sheets. The Bank is also pro-actively pursuing leveraging of 
IBRD funding with other development partners. Nevertheless, these efforts will be insufficient to 
support Mexico’s financing needs without a significant increase in IBRD lending capacity for 
Mexico. 
101. As of September 30, 2013, the active WBG portfolio consisted of 12 IBRD projects 
and 5 full GEF operations for a net commitment of US$4.26 billion. The average age of 
IBRD projects dropped from 4 years in FY08 to 3 years in FY12, but increased back to 4.1 years 
in FY13 due to the extension of several energy and GEF projects. Disbursement ratio has been 
steadily high (Table 4). The Bank is implementing some 40 trust funds, including a large Clean 
Technology Fund and GEF program for US$455 million.

102. Since 2008, IEG has evaluated 22 projects of which 64 percent has been rated 
“satisfactory” or “moderately satisfactory”. Representing 8.5 percent of commitments, currently 
there are 7 projects in problem status (or 41 percent of projects), concentrated in renewable 
energy 
and 
transport 
projects with 
complex 
and 
innovative 
procurement. 
Restructurings/cancellations have taken place within the last year in five of the problem projects 
and are in process in the remaining two projects. These portfolio actions have untangled 
implementation and contracting bottlenecks and should yield disbursements shortly, improving 
the health of the portfolio. Sector-specific portfolio reviews will also help address systemic 
implementation issues.  

103. The level of IBRD lending within the development solutions thematic engagements 
discussed in Section IV will depend upon: (a) IBRD exposure management developments and 
leveraging options; (b) subnational demand for financing; and (c) the conditions of global 
financial markets. Overall, IBRD capacity to respond to a large increase in financing demand is 
currently constrained by the SBL. In this context, the indicative firm IBRD lending program for 
FY14 and FY15 is expected to be US$350 million and US$700 million, respectively (Table 6). 
Mexican authorities have indicated that if IBRD were to increase its lending capacity, they 
would be interested in developing a more substantial pipeline, with a particular focus on 
infrastructure.

VI. RISKS AND MITIGATION 

104. Four potential risks may impact the results achievement of the CPS: weakened political 
support, international economic environment, program performance, and crime and violence.  
105. Political support for reforms may weaken. The political economy of addressing key 
structural rigidities for improved labor productivity and greater market competition and 
innovation, particularly in the energy sector, is still undetermined and bound to be difficult. 
However, the strategic areas identified in the Mexico NDP received broad acceptance by the 
population, and the new administration has already enacted key reforms in the education and 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
telecommunications sector. Failure of reform implementation could impact results negatively 
and will require adjusting the strategy and expected outcomes to the emerging realities while 
capturing lessons learned. Flexibility embedded in the CPS would allow this adjustment. 
106. Little room exists for countercyclical lending in the context of limited SBL space. 
The risk of a less favorable international context, and in particular changes in global monetary 
policies and a sluggish US economy, may impact foreign exchange markets, domestic financial 
markets, and global financial flows. Renewed fiscal pressure for quick disbursing IBRD 
financing is bound to be limited given the size of the exposure envelope. In addressing this risk, 
the WBG is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of its financial instruments to provide 
viable alternatives to the authorities.  
107. CPS program performance could be at risk at the national and subnational levels. A 
sizable undisbursed amount of some US$1.8 billion remains to be implemented over the next 3-4 
years. In addressing portfolio performance, close supervision and portfolio restructurings would 
help improve the performance of problem projects. To tackle implementation issues, proactive 
portfolio management, including strong follow up on recent restructurings and sector-specific 
portfolio performance review (together with related knowledge programs) should yield 
disbursements and improve the health of the portfolio. The filtering process presented in this 
CPS will also serve to maintain program focus to the WBG goals while maintaining flexibility to 
respond to emerging client needs, including at the subnational level. The close management of 
the thematic business plans, programmatic approaches, and the wholesaling of country budgets 
around results will help maintain attention to strategic outcomes while maintaining the flexibility 
to adjust the programs to evolving country circumstances and build in continuous learning. The 
WBG will systematically assess Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) issues in all 
subnational activities.  
108. Risks from crime and violence to the program. Mexico’s national homicide rate has 
more than doubled between 2007 and 2010, increasing 114 percent between 2005 and 2011. An 
increase in drug- and firearm-related homicides, principally among young men, concentrated in 
particular cities, explain this upward trend in crime and violence. However, the WBG 
engagement is not concentrated in areas of crime and violence (mostly border-states with the US) 
reducing the chances of negative impact to the program. The WB will continue to monitor trends 
in crime and violence, providing support through the dissemination of its recent youth violence 
report, inputs to the proposed urbanization review, areas of engagement in access to social 
protection, and as part of other regional products on citizen security. The WB is also preparing a 
multi-year citizens’ security knowledge and convening programmatic engagement in FY14 to 
support the Government’s crime and violence prevention efforts.

GOALS 

Expected Outcomes 
Specific Problem Areas or Challenges Addressed 
Theme 1: Unleashing Productivity 
Credit to SMEs and poor households constrained but 
expansion needs to preserve financial stability. 
Half the population without access to financial services. 
Capital market constrained by few private bond issuers and 
corporate equity markets. 
Burdensome regulations limit firm entrance and growth. 
Sharp disparities in regulatory burden between states. 
Concentrated markets and lack of effective pro-competition 
regulations, particularly at State Level, inhibit firm entrance 
and growth. 
Less than adequate competition, limited financing for 
startups, lack of long-term financing to even large 
companies and fragmentation of support programs for 
SMEs. Lack of impact evaluation hinder effectiveness of 
SMEs policies to support innovation and growth. 
Better coordination in policy making is needed to support 
innovation. Limited capabilities in some states and the 
private sector to develop innovation strategies. 
Productivity potential limited by: (i) lack of competition in 
Outcomes will be 
telecommunications resulted in few low quality and high

goods. 
Theme 2: Increasing Social Prosperity 
Persistent institutional constraints to labor contracts make it 
difficult to expand formal employment. 
Low level of relevant skills in labor market. 
Inefficiency in allocation of labor force due to incomplete 
labor market policies for facilitating job search and 
matching, and employment shock protection.

target states and 
industries. 

4. Increased skilled 
labor market 
participation. 

1. Increased access to 
finance and improved 
financial inclusion. 

2. Improved business 
environment to support 
private sector 
investment. 

Integrated social protection system needed. System is 
fragmented, poorly targeted, inefficient, has serious 
coverage gaps, and design elements need to be changed to 
function as a system. 

5. Increased use of 
integrated social 
programs among the 
poor with larger 
private sector 
participation in social 
services provision. 
Theme 3: Strengthening Public Finances and Government Efficiency 
6. Increased non-oil 
Low public revenue collection, particularly taxes, to address

7. Increased adoption 
of modern public

9. Strengthened 
institutional 
framework to manage 
urban development and 
reduced GHG 
emissions. 

10. Reduced 
deforestation together 
with increase in 
certified forest areas. 

8. Integrated and 
comprehensive risk 
management 
framework in place 
covering key fiscal, 
agricultural, and 
natural disaster risks. 

Around 41 percent of Mexico’s territory, 30 percent of its 
GDP, and 31 percent of its population exposed to three or 
more natural hazards. These events affect agricultural 
production, physical assets, and human lives, particularly in 
poorest states. 
Non-systemic management of other contingent fiscal risks 
such as commodity price, interest, exchange rate, debt and 
financial assets volatility. Need to implement an integrated 
risk management for potential shocks. 
Theme 4: Promoting Green and Inclusive Growth 
Urban development in Mexico has been steadfast (77 
percent urbanization rate), car-oriented, and inefficient, with 
low-density patterns that are not conducive to generate 
economies of scale in: production; movements of labor and 
capital; and resource consumption. 
Costs of land and water degradation due to solid and liquid 
wastes have been increasing each year, harming human 
health, the environment and the economy. 
Energy production and consumption represent 60 percent of 
GHG emissions and a large cost for the economy. 
Forest degradation is reason for concern, as forests represent 
an essential source of employment, income, and livelihood 
for about 12 million people, and play an important role in 
mitigating and adapting to climate change. 

11. Improved water 
management systems 
and expanded access to 
water services. 
12. Increased 
production of 
combined renewable 
energy. 

Water availability decreased dramatically over the past 50 
years. Situation worsened by inefficient use of water in 
agriculture and urban services. Service quality is below 
OECD standards. 

Declining oil production poses challenge of transforming 
energy matrix composition. 

IBRD risk management: DRM knowledge activities, with emphasis on strengthening 
prevention, developing risk models, supporting states and agricultural risk

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY08-13 
COMPLETION REPORT 

I. INTRODUCTION 
1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) is a self-evaluation by 
the World Bank Group (WBG) team of its performance in implementing the Country 
Partnership Strategy FY08-13 (Report # 42846-MX).  The CPS FY08-13 was jointly prepared 
by the World Bank and IFC in collaboration with the Government of Mexico. It was well 
aligned both with Mexico’s six-year political cycle and the country priorities of President 
Calderon’s administration as stated in the 2007-12 National Development Plan (NDP). Early in 
its implementation, the CPS provided a framework for a strong and flexible knowledge-focused 
partnership with a more limited financing relationship and focused knowledge and financial 
engagement in five key thematic areas: (a) accelerating growth; (b) improving competitiveness; 
(c) promoting social inclusion and reducing poverty; (d) developing infrastructure and assuring 
energy security and environmental sustainability; and (e) strengthening institutions. 
2. 
The CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) FY08-10 (Report #52776-MX) reaffirmed its 
support to the five original themes but adapted the World Bank Group (WBG) strategy 
with a new integrated engagement model to address client needs in the context of evolving 
country developments and global challenges. This new engagement model sought to 
maximize the impact of a tailored package of WBG financial, knowledge, and convening 
services. The CPS was flexible enough to provide fast response to emerging financing needs to 
the public and private sector following the 2008-09 global financial crisis, while delivering a 
broad knowledge agenda using integrated and tailored packages of services in delivering 
development solutions. The Government requested financing in order to have access to 
disbursements of a record US$7 billion over the two-year period (CY09-10) to meet the global 
challenge. The initial CPS program was strategically adapted to accelerate disbursements 
through policy-based loans addressing key structural reforms and several quick-disbursing 
investment loans targeted to the poor. Knowledge services, organized around integrative 
programmatic approaches, leveraged World Bank resources and grants around priority CPS 
themes. The knowledge program experienced a gradual shift from traditional economic sector 
work (ESW) reports to just-in-time pieces, programmatic approaches, and demand-driven 
reimbursable services, showing flexibility and responsiveness to evolving client demand.  
3. 
While lending volumes declined after the crisis for IBRD, IFC financing 
increased significantly in a countercyclical path. IBRD lending declined from US$6.4 billion 
approved in FY09 to US$50 million in FY12. Key areas of IBRD support in response to the 
global crisis included poverty alleviation and increased social safety nets, as well as structural 
reforms in housing, environmental, and climate change sustainability. IFC commitments, 
however, expanded from US$84 million in FY09 to a robust US$1,768 million at the end of 
FY13, following strong demand for its financing and integrated solutions to private sector 
development challenges. IFC demand increased mostly in the financial markets, manufacturing, 
retail, and property sectors. The IFC Mexico program focused on strategic priorities of 
operating in frontier regions, supporting micro, small, and medium-size enterprises and 
reducing the private sector’s impact on climate change. 
4. 
The WBG knowledge program remains its comparative advantage. Demand for 
WBG knowledge and convening services have become an essential component of the WBG 

48 

 
engagement with Mexico. WBG knowledge and advisory products have matured through 
innovative client-driven approaches aligned to critical strategic and global areas such as 
addressing the climate change challenge. 
5. 
The CPSCR describes and evaluates the support provided through the delivery of 
a new approach in packaging financial, knowledge, and convening services aimed to 
provide tailored development solutions. The CPSCR takes into account the crucial role that 
knowledge and convening services played alongside financial services to achieve CPS 
outcomes in the five key thematic areas.  
6. 
The CPSCR seeks two main purposes: First, evaluate the performance of the CPS 
program in achieving the outcomes the WBG expected to influence within the CPS period as 
stated in the updated CPSPR results matrix; and second, assess the performance of the WBG in 
delivering the joint World Bank-IFC CPS program.  
7. 
In summary, program performance was “satisfactory” and 
the WBG 
performance in implementing the strategy was “satisfactory”, based on an extensive 
analysis of the CPS program achieving the objectives throughout the six-year implementation 
period. Lessons from the evaluation of the closing CPS will help formulate the new CPS 
program for the next six years. 
II. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENTS 
8. 
The strategic focus of the Government of Mexico was to confront longstanding 
challenges. By December 2006, the Mexican economy had transformed its export base from a 
dependence on petroleum products to manufacturing goods. Fiscal discipline and strong fiscal 
policy and debt management frameworks enabled the authorities to conduct an adequate 
countercyclical policy response to the 2008-09 financial crisis; the financial system, having 
been battered by the 1995 crisis, had been rebuilt and a sound regulatory framework was well 
established. The authorities took appropriate actions to maintain order in foreign exchange and 
domestic financial markets. 
9. 
Mexico faced a deteriorating global economic environment along with the 
parallel negative impacts of the food crisis and the influenza pandemic, as well as other 
internal issues related to organized crime. In mid-2008, investment in dynamic export sectors 
suffered as a result of the downturn, and job losses had an impact on poverty rates. 18
10. 
Moreover, remittance flows also declined as the Mexican immigrant population in the 
United States suffered significant job losses. 19 
11. 
Credit to the private sector was also constrained, as local branches of international 
commercial banks became hesitant to lend and even hoarded liquidity. Economic activity 
declined by 4.7 percent in 2009. The difficult economic and social situation was exacerbated in 
April by the AH1N1 influenza epidemic in Mexico, which was estimated to have reduced GDP 
by 0.3 to 0.5 percent in 2009. Moreover, organized crime (drug trafficking, kidnappings, 
killings, etc.) had direct and indirect costs to the country’s economy, including expenditures 
made by individuals, firms, and governments to prevent or respond to crime, as well as the 
multiplicative effects or externalities created by criminal actions, such as reductions in 
economic growth or limited governance. 20 
 After the global financial crisis of 2008, Mexico experienced a deep but brief 
recession in 2009. Growth resurged despite turbulence in Europe, in part because of the slow 
but steady recovery in the United States. Real GDP growth expanded 5.1 percent in 2010, 

12. 

49 

 
moderating to 4.0 and 3.8 percent in 2011 and 2012, with an expected deceleration to 1.5 
percent in 2013. 

III. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 
13. 
The program performance evaluation reports on expected CPS program results as 
revised by the CPSPR. During the CPS period, the Bank centered its support in five thematic 
areas that contained 28 CPS outcomes (Table 1). Overall, the WBG program performance is 
rated “satisfactory”.

The analysis of results in each thematic area is organized as follows: (a) sector context 
and challenges facing the thematic area; (b) introduction to CPS outcomes for each theme; and 
(c) package of financial, knowledge, and convening services for each CPS outcome. Each 
outcome presents the results of the IBRD-IFC joint program and provides a comprehensive 
assessment of all elements of the WBG program (not just lending activities). Details of the 
program performance are presented in Annex 1A, Summary of CPS Program Self-evaluation, 
providing a clear assessment of each CPS outcome, a brief reference to supporting evidence, 
and specific lessons or suggestions derived from the evaluation to be taken into account by the 
new CPS program.  

50 

 
 
A. Thematic Area I: Accelerating Growth 
15. 
To achieve a sustainable level of growth of 5 percent, this theme focused on Mexico’s 
agenda of long-term reforms to strengthen public finances, improve the business climate, 
promote regulatory reform, enhance innovation, as well as investment in infrastructure and 
human capital. Yet, with the advent of the global crisis in 2008, support shifted to focus on the 
immediate challenges of stabilizing the fiscal accounts and reactivating the economy, while still 
advancing longer-term reforms. The program focused on the following outcomes: (a) promoting 
measures to enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability and countercyclical fiscal policies; (b) 
promoting regulatory reforms to foster financial sector access and consumer protection; (c) 
enhancing short-term employment programs, while stimulating labor market efficiency and 
productivity; and (d) improving trade competitiveness by reducing and simplifying tariffs and 
customs processing.  
Countercyclical Fiscal Policies During 2009 While Adopting Measures to Enhance 
Medium Term Fiscal Sustainability for 2010 and Beyond, Including an Increase in Non-oil 
Tax Revenue and Improvements to Public Expenditure Management 
16. 
At the time of the crisis, market concerns about Mexico focused on falling oil 
production and the ability to maintain the 2009 fiscal stimulus. At the core of the Bank’s 
response to support the authorities was an Economic Response DPL of US$1.5 billion. The 
operation built on previous knowledge services, including Bank studies on capital markets 
development and financial sector competitiveness. In addition, it built on just-in-time technical 
assistance to support economic policies that helped mitigate the negative effect of the crisis, 
assess its distributional impacts, and strengthen the framework for economic recovery. 
Programmatic Knowledge Services on public expenditure management successfully informed 
policymakers in these areas in preparation of the long-awaited fiscal reform. Despite the crisis, 
non-oil tax income increased from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 10.0 percent in 2010, although 
less than the 10.3 percent expected partly due to higher than expected growth.  Yet, as a result 
of a recently approved fiscal reform on October 31, 2013, the Mexican Ministry of Finance 
expects to raise non-oil tax income from 9.9 percent in 2013 to 10.3 percent in 2014.  [The 
expected outcome was “partially achieved”.] 
Implementation of Regulatory Reforms to Foster Financial Sector Access, Consumer 
Protection and Stability 
17. 
The financial sector, which withstood the global financial crisis, was seen as an 
important player in Mexico’s economic recovery. In response to the impact of the global 
financial crisis on the real economy, the WBG built on its longstanding policy dialogue and 
investment track record with Mexico on financial sector development, including a series of 
initiatives: (a) to increase competition and provide better financial services to the private sector 
and consumers; and (b) to deepen financial markets, as measured by increased financing, 
including bank credit, publicly traded debt, and equity investment. [The expected outcome was 
“achieved” and exceeded.]  
18. 
In FY12, a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) provided a roadmap over the medium 
term for reforms aimed at strengthening financial sector stability and foster sound financial 
sector development. The Bank supported these efforts with technical assistance to the Ministry 
of Finance and a report recommending reforms in the regulation of the insurance and annuities 
market. In addition, the Bank prepared several grants for assessing the poverty and 

51 

 
distributional impacts of the financial crisis and providing evidence-based and gender-sensitive 
policy advice.  
19. 
A package of ongoing financial and technical operations with the development bank 
BANSEFI also contributed to give access to financial services to more than 600,000 low-
income families and to more than 10 million clients in 2012 (above the 9 million target). For 
Mexico as a whole, the number of outlets providing financial services increased to 20,297 in 
2012 from 10,354 in 2010, more than the 35 percent expected for 2010 by the CPS. Mexico was 
also successful in focusing global attention to the topic of financial inclusion as the World Bank 
shared its experience in this topic during Mexico’s G20 Presidency during 2012.  
20. 
IFC supported financial sector deepening by investing in BANORTE, the only locally 
controlled large bank in Mexico, which received a common equity investment of up to US$150 
million to strengthen its balance sheet and help resume the lending activity in the country. IFC's 
Advisory and Investment Services included: (a) housing finance aimed at lower-income 
households; (b) microfinance to service microloans in frontier regions; and (c) SME finance/ 
agribusiness investments in Finterra, Agrofinanzas, and in Mifel. At the end of the CPS period, 
Agrofinanzas reached over 5,000 farmers and Compartamos, Finterra, Mifel, and Agrofinanzas 
together supported a total of 2.8 million loans for micro, small, and medium-size enterprises for 
a volume of US$1.6 billion. 
Enhancement of Short-Term Employment Support Programs While Developing Medium-
Term Reforms for Labor Market Efficiency and Labor Productivity 
21. 
During the 2008-09 recession, the Mexican labor market experienced a severe crisis. 
The expansion of the Temporary Employment Program (PET) supported by the Economic 
Response DPL provided a financial buffer for lower-income segments of the population, 
substantially increasing the number of hired beneficiaries through PET from 365,000 in 2008 to 
897,000 in 2010 (above the 650 thousand target for 2010).  The DPL built on Bank’s knowledge 
services with the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) on productivity and 
employment. A series of policy papers, notes, and micro-simulation exercises complemented 
targeted just-in-time assistance. [The expected outcome was “achieved”.] 
Improved Competitiveness by Lowering International Trade Costs via Reduction of MFN 
Tariffs and Simplification of the Trade Tariff Regime and Customs Processes 
22. 
In December 2008, Mexico adopted an ambitious reduction of its Most Favored 
Nation (MFN) tariff rates for nonagricultural products. The World Bank supported this effort 
through the Economic Response DPL and a package of knowledge and convening services. The 
average general MFN tariff rate fell from 10.4 percent in 2008 to 5.3 percent in 2010, (i.e. the 
CPS 2010 target), and may reach 4.3 percent by the end of 2013. Several indicators were also 
used to measure progress towards simplification of tariff regime. The reduction in rates and 
increase in the number of duty free tariff lines resulted in a simpler tariff structure. The number 
of duty free tariff lines was increased from 20 percent in 2008 to 58.7 percent in 2010 and to 61 
percent in 2011. The reforms supported by the Bank rationalized the borrower’s tariff structure, 
reduced distortions, and simplified Mexico’s trade regime.   
23. 
The Bank’s financial support also built on a Customs Assessment Tool for Trade 
(CATT) that improved trade quality by promoting excellence in customs performance 
management; technical assistance on agricultural trade for sensitive agricultural commodities; 
and South-South knowledge exchanges with Africa, Asia, and other Latin American countries. 
These activities achieved their goals of assisting the Government of Mexico in designing 

52 

 
policies to respond to changes in market conditions for strategically important crops, linking 
extension services with agricultural financing, and promoting Mexico’s competitiveness in an 
environment of commodity price volatility. At the same time, IFC committed US$54 million in 
guarantees through the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) to ensure the flow of trade credit 
in the Mexican market. Despite this volume of commitments in the CPS period, Mexico’s 
demand for GTFP is low, relative to other countries in the program, mostly due to strong and 
established trade links with the United States. [The expected outcome was “achieved”.] 
B. Thematic Area II: Improving Competitiveness 
24. 
CPS outcomes supported by the Bank to improve Mexico’s competitiveness included: 
(a) strengthening and expanding the Government’s quality schools program; (b) greater support 
for improved coverage and quality of education in poor municipalities; (c) improving upper 
secondary education; (d) equitably expanding tertiary education through student assistance; and 
(e) improving human skills, infrastructure, links between local and global companies, and the 
financial, legal and regulatory framework for information technology (IT).  
Strengthening and Expanding the Government’s Quality School Program 
25. 
The Bank provided support to improve the quality of education as measured by 
coverage and social participation, through a series of APLs 21 for school-based management. 
These projects aimed to improve the learning outcomes of children by increasing the number of 
basic education schools participating in the quality improvement program, known as Programa 
de Escuelas de Calidad (PEC), from 39,000 to over 50,000 schools. As of June 2013, over 26 
percent of all basic education schools are participating in the PEC program, up from 20 percent 
in 2010 and well above the 23 percent CPS target set for 2014.  [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Greater Support for Improved Coverage and Quality of Education in Poor Municipalities 
26. 
The School Based Management project phases I and II helped to improve the quality 
of education as measured by increased coverage, social participation and educational outcomes. 
The School Based Management I project contributed to increase the number of schools 
participating in the Quality Schools Program (PEC) from 10.3 percent during 2006 to 20.35 
percent in 2009. With the support of the School Based Management II, by January 2013, the 
percentage of basic and special education schools participating in PEC increased from 20.3 
percent to 26.7 percent.  The percentage of poor schools located in highly marginalized and 
marginalized areas participating in the PEC program also increased from 38.4 percent in 2010 
to 44.5 percent in 2013 (the project is on track to meet the 55% outcome for 2014). [The 
expected outcome was “achieved”]. 
Improved Relevance of Upper Secondary Education 
27. 
The Bank supported the Government through DPLs improving the quality and 
relevance of upper secondary education. 22  These DPLs resulted in increased flexibility of the 
upper secondary system since all federal schools now accept student transfers and validate 
curriculum equivalencies, and in better student learning as evidenced by improved ENLACE 
mathematics scores.  By 2011, 100 percent of federal schools implemented the competence-
based curriculum, well above the 50 percent CPS target for 2011.  Supporting knowledge 
services helped understand better the causes of upper secondary school dropout and 
recommended policy options for education services to the poorest. [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 

53 

 
Equitable Expansion of Tertiary Education Through Student Assistance 
28. 
Through a series of APLs 23 on Tertiary Education Student Assistance, the Bank 
successfully supported the Government’s strategy to foster the sustainable, equitable, and 
efficient expansion of tertiary education through the development of a coherent student 
assistance system consisting of grant programs and compensatory 
interventions for 
disadvantaged students. The share of 18- to 24-year-old students in tertiary education from 
households classified at the two lowest quintiles of the income distribution increased from (an 
adjusted baseline) 10 percent in 2004-05 to 20.6 percent in 2011, surpassing the project target of 
20 percent for 2011. IFC also successfully supported: (a) Universidad Autónoma de 
Guadalajara (UAG) for the construction and renovation of its facilities; (b) work with Finem, 
the leading student loan institution; and (c) support to Edilar, a company that gives access to 
public school teachers to education-related products and content, as well as to lending of 
resources for continuing education. IFC’s education projects have supported 29,000 students, of 
which 40 percent were female. These projects also supported the creation of over 4,000 jobs. 
[The expected outcome was “achieved”.] 
Improved Human Skills, Infrastructure, Links Between Local and Global Companies, 
Financing and Legal and Regulatory Framework for IT 
29. 
As part of its engagement to improve competitiveness, the WBG supported 
improvements in the business environment, particularly among SMEs, and fostered the 
innovative capacity of the private sector, including research and development, to enhance 
productivity and economic growth. The World Bank’s Doing Business reports provided critical 
reform benchmarks within Mexico, generating internal discussion and policy reforms. Efforts to 
strengthen the innovative capacity of the private sector and increasing the integration of 
Mexico’s innovation system were supported by a DPL.  Although the number of agreements to 
streamline public procurements procedures fell short of the DPL target, the project was 
successful in mobilizing annual private investment in infrastructure. Eventually, the impact of 
the 2007 World Bank Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) helped Mexico 
modernize its procurement systems by eliminating obsolete regulations and building in methods 
for transparency. The Bank has successfully provided support to improve human skills, 
infrastructure, links between local and global companies, and the financial, legal, and regulatory 
framework for IT with support of an APL24 on Innovation for Competitiveness and an ongoing 
project on IT development (PROSOFT).  As a result of these projects, the number of companies 
with technical capacity, quality standard certifications, and access to new markets increased to 
413 in 2012 (well above the 390 target for 2014). Total private R&D also increased from 0.15 
in 2004 to 0.17 percent in 2009 but below the 0.23 percent target (2009). [The outcome was 
“partially achieved”.] 
C. Thematic Area III: Promoting Social Inclusion 
30. 
At the time of the CPS FY08-13 discussion, poverty levels in Mexico had been 
declining since the crisis of the mid-1990s; this thematic area focused on long-term issues. Yet, 
the impact of the crisis in 2008 and the AH1N1 influenza epidemic changed the Bank’s 
approach in responding to expeditious demands from the Government to protect the poor’s 
investment in human capital and their consumption. Outcomes supported by the Bank to 
promote social inclusion included: (a) increased capacities in health, nutrition and education of 
poor families through human capital investment; (b) preservation and expansion of the Popular 
Health Insurance coverage of poor and informal worker families; (c) improved access to ECD 

54 

 
services and learning outcomes of children in the most marginalized municipalities; and (d) 
strengthening the capacity of the health system to control epidemic waves.   
Increase Capacities in Health, Nutrition, and Education of Poor Families Through Human 
Capital Investment by Promoting Regular Health Check-ups, Improving Health Status, 
and Raising School Enrollment and Attendance 
31. 
Bank assistance to increase health, nutrition, and education outcomes of poor families 
helped sustain the number of families and children participating in the Oportunidades program. 
A loan and additional financing (AF) associated with this conditional cash transfer (CCT) 
program contributed to achieving significant development results, with 5.8 million families 
participating in the program as of December 2012 and another 3 million more children 
participating in the program. The Bank also provided extensive technical and convening 
services to address a series of second-generation issues for the Oportunidades program to be 
supported in the next CPS, and contributed to increasing Mexico’s engagement in South-South 
knowledge exchanges with other developing countries. As a result, Oportunidades received 
numerous delegations from other countries, most of which have been organized by the Bank, 
where participants learned of the design and implementation of social programs in Mexico and 
exchanged different perspectives on poverty alleviation programs. [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Preserve and Expand the Popular Health Insurance’s Coverage of Poor and Informal 
Worker Families, and to Strengthen its Financing and Affiliation Systems 
32. 
With support of the Social Protection System in Health Project, the Bank promoted 
access to healthcare for the poor by increasing popular health insurance (PHI) coverage to 
virtually all intended beneficiaries. Knowledge activities provided policy options. Compared 
with 27 million PHI affiliates at the beginning of the CPS period, now there are more than 52 
million affiliates; virtually all intended beneficiaries of the PHI are covered. The Basic Health 
Care Project contributed to increase the number of health facilities to guarantee the provision of 
services to affiliates who qualify for the subsidized regime of the PHI. The Bank also supported 
a Global Knowledge Exchange Activity on Health Financing, as well as several South-South 
exchanges that allowed the Government to share its experience and learn from other health 
insurance coverage programs. [The expected outcome was “achieved”.] 
Improve Access to ECD Services and Learning Outcomes of Children in the Most 
Marginalized Municipalities of Mexico 
33. 
With the support of the Compensatory Education Project, the Bank aimed to improve 
the access to ECD services through several innovative interventions. The number of children 
attending at least 80 percent of ECD sessions grew by 30 percent between 2010 and 2013, and 
the number of parents attending these sessions increased from 38,620 in 2009 to 49,447 in 2012, 
exceeding the end of year target. Several knowledge products — with the support of grant 
funding — contributed to improve access to ECD services. 25  [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Strengthen the Capacity of the Mexican Health System to Control Epidemic Waves 
34. 
The Influenza and Prevention Control Loan was cancelled due to problems using 
planned retroactive financing 26 and a milder than expected AH1N1 epidemic. Nonetheless, the 
World Bank supported a number of Government decisions and actions that contributed to 
containing the epidemic. Despite the absence of Bank disbursements, the Ministry of Health 

55 

 
made significant progress toward the original loan-identified program development objectives: 
strengthening the capacity of the health system to monitor the spread of influenza viruses; and 
controlling epidemic waves. By December 2010, 24 percent of the population had been 
vaccinated against AH1N1, and the Government had purchased more than 2.1 million units of 
antiviral medicines to replenish and expand the country’s strategic reserves. 27 As part of its 
ongoing collaboration with the health sector, the World Bank also provided technical assistance 
that contributed to strengthening the National System for Epidemiological Surveillance 
(SINAVE). The Bank also supported the Government through an Avian and Human Influenza 
(AHIF) grant in the development of comprehensive risk communication strategies at the local 
level in 9 states. 28 The Bank helped in transferring knowledge from the Mexican experience 
with the AH1N1 epidemic, including pandemic preparedness management, and in showcasing 
Mexico’s best practice to Asian countries.  
35. 
IFC strengthened its private health sector strategy through the financing of three 
projects: Centro Medico Puertas de Hierro in the construction of new hospitals in Guadalajara, 
Nayarit (frontier state), and Colima, offering general primary, secondary, and tertiary health 
services. These hospitals have already reached 492,000 patients, showing strong demand for 
their services. Additionally, in FY13 IFC supported the creation of a new greenfield hospital 
within the integrated medical complex in northern Monterrey characterized by its growing low-
and middle-income population where demand for medical infrastructure is growing quickly. 
This hospital is planning to reach 27,000 patients. Lastly, IFC successfully structured and 
implemented a PPP solution for the design, construction, financing, and operation of two new 
regional secondary hospitals in Toluca and Tlalnepantla (both in Estado de Mexico). This was 
the first PPP hospital in Mexico to include a payment mechanism incorporating deductions 
attached to contractually agreed-upon key performance indicators. This has resulted in these 
hospitals being considered among the most efficient healthcare facilities in the country.  [The 
expected outcome was “partially achieved”.] 
D. Thematic Area IV: Developing Infrastructure and Assuring Energy Security and 
Environmental Sustainability 
36. 
Despite an appropriate level of service coverage in a wide variety of sectors — urban 
development, transport, energy, water, environmental management — relative to the rest of 
Latin America, the quality and reliability of these services in Mexico are generally below what 
could be expected in an upper middle-income country. 29 Outcomes supported by the Bank to 
promote this area included: (a) enhancing massive urban public transport; (b) use of clean 
development mechanisms to foster technology, regulatory, and institutional changes; (c) 
improving the federal housing system; (d) improving water supply and sanitation service 
provision; (e) providing environmental services; (f) integrating energy services in rural areas; 
(g) contributing to low emissions in the energy sector; (h) piloting renewable energy 
production; and (i) promoting adaptation to climate change. 
Development of Urban Transport Evaluating Alternative Solutions and Proposing 
Frameworks for Private Sector Participation  
37. 
The Government, together with the World Bank, has been working to address public 
transport and air pollution issues and their linkage to climate change. Through a reimbursable 
advisory service (RAS), the Bank advised on designing a federal program to support the 
development of urban public transport systems (i.e., PROTRAM). The Urban Transport 
Transformation Project (UTTP) supports PROTRAM to transform urban transport in Mexican 
cities onto a lower-carbon growth path. The Sustainable Transport and Air Quality Program 

56 

 
GEF grant, linked to the UTTP, assisted municipalities in reducing CO2 emissions and supports 
policy changes to favor larger investments in sustainable transport projects. The ongoing 
Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit System Carbon Finance Project has contributed to reducing 
airborne pollutants and GHG emissions generated by the transport sector in Mexico City. This 
corridor improved bus system energy efficiency by replacing 368 old, small, and mid-size 
gasoline and gas — mainly liquid petroleum gas — units with 105 articulated passenger diesel 
buses. Emissions reductions in the period Nov. 1, 2009, to Oct. 31, 2010 were 50,180 tons CO2 
per year, of which modal change were 38,790 tons. 30 [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Catalytic Use of Clean Development Mechanism to Foster Technology, Regulatory and 
Institutional Changes in the Public Transport Sector 
38. 
Among the actions seeking to improve the use of clean development mechanisms and 
foster technological and institutional changes in the energy and public transport sectors, the 
Bank supported the Government with the Green Growth DPL in developing the regulatory, 
monitoring, and financial framework for lower GHG emissions. 31 In parallel to this DPL, other 
operations aimed to develop the regulatory and business framework of the transport sector. The 
introduction of Climate Friendly Measures in Transport supported the design of the BRT 
corridors in Mexico City (Metrobus) and the creation of the institutional, regulatory, and 
business framework for operating BRT systems in other Mexican cities. Metrobus has now 
become a more robust agency in technical terms and is mobilizing 800,000 passengers per day. 
The ‘Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit System Carbon Finance’ project has also contributed to 
improve bus productivity by serving more passengers with lesser number of units and increase 
modal share of large buses. [The expected outcome was “achieved”.] 
Improve Federal Housing System to Facilitate Access to Housing by Low-and Moderate- 
Income Families 
39. 
At the initial stages of the global financial crisis, the Government recognized the need 
to strengthen the Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), a public sector institution with the 
mandate to develop housing finance markets and facilitate access to housing by low- and 
moderate-income families. The Bank supported the Government toward the achievement of this 
outcome through the Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Reduction DPL III (HUSAL) and 
the Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening Project. However, the expected gradual 
expansion of SHF products toward lower-income segments did not materialize because the 
agency’s focus shifted to mitigating the mounting crisis of the housing sector in general. On the 
positive side, the Private Housing Finance Project successfully contributed to stabilizing the 
housing market during the crisis by supporting government’s achievement of 1 million housing 
solutions per year in 2008-12 and strong SHF support to the private sector. Complementing the 
HUSAL, a three-year Technical Assistance Loan (HUTAL) supported technical aspects of the 
reforms supported by the HUSAL. The HUSAL supported the preparation and implementation 
of Mexico’s 2007-12 National Housing Program, but was not fully effective in improving the 
complex institutional housing framework in Mexico.  
40. 
IFC incorporated in its strategy the support to the housing sector based on the 
Government’s longstanding agenda in promoting affordable housing. Before the 2008-09 crisis, 
IFC supported the demand side through equity investments and debt financing in non-bank 
financial institutions (Su Casita, Vertice, GMAC), which made loans to the low-income 
mortgage sector. From the supply side, IFC supported large publicly listed homebuilders that 
have the scale and capacity to provide the largest volumes of affordable housing in the industry. 

57 

 
At the end of FY13, IFC had a portfolio totaling US$175 million exposure (net of equity write 
downs) in the sector with Urbi, Homex, and Alpha Geo. However, due to changes in 
government policy in 2012, 32 the three largest homebuilders are currently experiencing a 
liquidity crisis and are in the process of restructuring. Nevertheless, the IFC portfolio includes 
projects with clients that, to date, have not been affected to the degree experienced by large 
homebuilders. [The expected outcome was “partially achieved”.] 
Tools and Instruments to Induce Local Authorities to Improve Financial Sustainability 
and Efficiency of Water Supply and Sanitation Service Provision in their Jurisdiction 
41. 
The Government is promoting significant investments in water to address an acute 
water crisis due to accelerated population growth and suboptimal management of water 
resources. The Modernization of the Water and Sanitation Sector TA (PATME) supported the 
documentation and dissemination of successful water models in 10 water utilities participating 
in this program.  Manuals developed by CONAGUA were distributed to water utilities and 
water and sanitation sector institutions beyond the realm of PATME. A satisfactory degree of 
improvement was observed in operational and financial performance of water utilities that were 
part of the PATME.  Through the successful rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation 
infrastructure and the adoption of improved farm irrigation and application systems, the 
Integrated Irrigation and Modernization Project, together with several knowledge activities and 
convening services on reducing overexploitation of aquifers, significantly improved water use 
efficiency and generated replicable models. In an effort to support selected Mexican states to 
improve their provision of water supply and sanitation, the Bank in addition worked with the 
State of Guanajuato in the implementation of the Decentralized Infrastructure Development 
Loan, which expanded access to water and sanitation services. A Water Sector DPL had a 
significant institutional impact, including the approval of a new Climate Change Law, greater 
focus on climate change in the framework of water planning instruments and programs at the 
federal level, and strengthening CONAGUA institutional framework and monitoring capacity.  
42. 
IFC provided capacity advisory support to the municipal water company (OPDM) 
during the design and implementation of a wastewater recycling plant in the municipality of 
Tlalnepantla. Additionally, in 2010 IFC invested in Water Capital, a leasing company that 
provides energy efficiency, renewable energy, and supply- and demand-side water management 
solutions tailored to the specific needs of its customers. [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Provision of Environmental Services of National and Global Significance and Secure 
Long-Term Sustainability 
43. 
During this CPS period, the Bank supported the Government in its efforts to promote 
sustainable production and consumption, prevent environment degradation, and ensure long-
term development opportunities. With the support of the Environmental Services Project and a 
GEF grant, the Bank aimed to enhance the provision of significant environmental services and 
secure long-term sustainability. The project had an important impact in increasing hydrological, 
biodiversity conservation, and hectares under contract; and carbon sequestration services. A 
series of Environmental DPLs supported environmental sustainability measures in the energy, 
water, tourism, and forestry sectors. They helped support congressional approval of the Energy 
Sector Reform package that included two key pieces of legislation: a law to promote the 
efficient use of energy and a law to increase the use of renewable energy sources.  During the 
ENVDPL III, the Bank also provided technical assistance to revise and update the Mexican 
Forest Fund.  By the end of 2009, 15 million ha. of forest under sustainable forest management 

58 

 
in—

operations were financed by this fund. IFC also made a US$10 million investment in Optima 
Energia, an energy services company, to undertake energy savings projects for six hotels in 
Mexico. This project will build the market for energy service companies and set a new standard 
for energy efficiency in the country’s hotel sector. By project completion, Optima Energia could 
reduce GHG emissions by 7.3 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. 
44. 
The Bank also supported the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, with 
projects like the Mesoamerican Corridor GEF grant, aimed at mainstreaming biodiversity 
criteria in public expenditure and supporting private efforts to achieve reduced deforestation and 
improved management of natural resources and biodiversity conservation in six biological 
corridors in southeast Mexico. The National System of Protected Natural Areas (SINAP) was 
also supported by the GEF and the Bank through several grants. [The expected outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Increase Access to Efficient and Sustainable Integrated Energy Services 
Predominantly Indigenous—Rural Areas of Mexico 
45. 
In order to increase access to efficient and sustainable integrated energy services in 
predominantly indigenous rural areas of Mexico, the Bank supported the Government’s Rural 
Electrification Program through a combination of investment operations and grants from the 
GEF. Nevertheless, both the Integrated Energy Services Project and the Solar Thermal Project, 
(i.e., Agua Prieta II) showed limited progress (and are still ongoing) due to a combination of 
complex procurement processes and project implementation difficulties. [The expected 
outcome was “partially achieved”.]  
Regulatory, Monitoring and Financial Framework for Low Emissions Evolution of the 
Transport and Energy Sectors Developed  
46. 
The Efficient Lighting and Appliances Project promoted Mexico’s efficient use of 
energy and the mitigation of climate change by increasing the use of energy-efficient 
technologies at the residential level. The project successfully promoted the development of a 
sustainable market for energy-efficiency equipment among the large and fast-growing energy 
end-use sectors for lighting, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Specifically, less consumption 
of electricity favored the environment, as an emission of about 865,000 tons of CO2 was 
avoided with the 22.9 million light bulbs that were changed during 2012.  
47. 
Also, as part of the Bank’s support in the agriculture area, the ongoing Sustainable 
Rural Development Project seeks to contribute to the goals of the National Strategy on Climate 
Change by reducing GHG emissions through the adoption of emission-reduction technologies. 
By the end of 2012, 770 small and medium-size agri-businesses adopted environmental 
sustainable technologies resulting in 600,000 tons of CO2 equivalent avoided (close to the CPS 
original target of 919 SMEs and 770,000 tons of CO2 equivalent for 2013). A Policy and 
Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant helped improve the Ministry of Environment’s 
capacity to promote the use of clean agro-environmentally friendly practices among producers.  
48. 
IFC, through its Sustainable Business Advisory (SBA) has worked with companies to 
adopt environmental, social, and governance best practice, as well as cleaner technologies that 
create a competitive edge. Additionally several IFC investments have been focused on energy 
efficiency projects (e.g., Calindra, the country’s main lime producer) improved environmental 
footprint with the use of forest biomass as an alternate fuel source. By project completion, 
Calindra is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 97,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. [The 
expected outcome was “partially achieved”.] 

59 

 
Reduce GHG (CO2) Emission Through the Adoption of Emission-Reduction Technologies 
49. 
The Bank is supporting two wind projects in Mexico: Carbon Fund-financed La Venta 
II and the GEF-financed La Venta III. La Venta II entered into commercial operation in 2007. 
After facing many hurdles, La Venta III (i.e., the wind power large-scale renewable energy 
development project) started operations in October 2012 and has paved the way for the 
development of wind energy in Mexico since it was the first project of its kind to be launched 
under the Independent Power Producer Scheme. Today more than 1,300 megawatts capacity of 
wind power energy are in operation with decreased prices of wind energy. In 2010 and 2011, 
IFC financed the first two private wind power projects in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Oaxaca). 
IFC advisory services have helped the Mexican Wind Energy Association (AMDEE) and the 
Ministry of Energy formulate a strategy to promote the development of the wind energy 
sector. 33 [The expected outcome was ‘achieved”.]   
Promoting Adaptation to Climate Change 
50. 
During the CPS period, Mexico demonstrated a strong commitment to address the 
challenges of climate change through concrete actions in the areas of institutionalizing the 
agenda, adopting related policy incentives, and designing national strategies and programs that 
placed climate change at the heart of the country’s NDP. As a result, this CPSCR reports a 
separate outcome — not originally considered on the CPSPR Results Matrix — that captures 
the Bank’s engagement with the Government on the promotion of adaptation to climate change.  
51. 
The Climate Change DPL was the first operation processed under this new assistance 
modality for Mexico proposed under the FY08-13 CPS. The engagement and packaging model 
tailored knowledge and convening services around a series of annual DPLs that successfully 
supported the Government’s effort under its National Climate Change Strategy to mainstream 
climate change consideration in public policy. Moreover, a Low Carbon DPL in FY10 and a 
Social Resilience to Climate Change DPL in FY12 supported Mexico’s climate change agenda, 
including advisory support for adaptation in low-income and vulnerable populations, while 
committing to reduce GHG emissions. 34  Further analysis on the social impacts of climate 
change included a report that identified the key drivers of socio-spatial differences in resilience 
and vulnerability to climate change in Mexico. At the subnational level, the broad range of 
Bank products, including grants, knowledge, and convening services, was coordinated through 
an ongoing Subnational Climate Change MoU that provided technical assistance to five states in 
the preparation of their climate change plans. Moreover, the GEF on Adaptation of Climate 
Change Impacts on the Coastal Wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico also contributed to promote 
climate change adaptation.  
52. 
As part of the CPS flexible design, in partnership with PREM, Treasury, and the 
Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program, the Bank also supported the integration of 
disaster risk within Mexico’s broader fiscal risk management strategy. The Bank worked in 
partnership with Mexico on the first and second multi-peril catastrophe bond (MultiCat bond) 
and had an active engagement in mainstreaming prevention and risk reduction strategies, as well 
as promoting disaster and risk financing and insurance activities. [The outcome was 
“achieved” and exceeded.] 
E. Thematic Area V: Strengthening Institutions 
53. 
Institutional strengthening was a critical cross-cutting theme in Bank support in most 
sectors. CPS outcomes supported included: (a) providing the public with information on the 
efficiency and effectiveness of government organizations and program expenditures; (b) 

60 

 
improving the administration in selected municipal governments; (c) improving customs 
processes and efficiency; (d) strengthening of fiscal 
transparency, governance, and 
accountability; (e) supporting judiciaries institutional performance; (f) improving capacity 
building and communication practices, and (g) strengthening and modernizing treasury 
management. 
Selected Federal Departments and Agencies Provide Decision Makers and the Public with 
Rigorous, Timely, User-Friendly Information on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of 
Government Organizations and Program Expenditures 
54. 
Although the World Bank supported the development of performance information 
indicators through a combination of financial and knowledge instruments, government demand 
for the ongoing Results-Based Management and Budgeting Project changed, resulting in a 
partial cancellation and a reduction of the project’s scope. Nonetheless, the project has helped 
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) to use standardized performance 
information of priority public programs during budget preparation. The Bank, however, 
continued to provide support to different selected federal entities and departments in the review 
and strengthening of their M&E system strategy, as well as capacity-building activities in other 
public accounting and oversight institutions. [The outcome was partially “achieved”.] 
Improved Administration in Selected Municipal Governments 
55. 
With support of an IDF grant for the Creation of a Municipal Management Public 
Observatory, 
the Bank contributed 
to 
institutional building, strengthening of social 
accountability, and administration improvement in selected municipal governments. This was 
achieved through the creation of an online platform, currently under operation, which provides a 
virtual space to exchange good practice and other valuable knowledge.  With the use of this 
public website, areas where local governments could improve have been identified, which has 
resulted in the development of improved trainings for local public servants.  [The outcome was 
“achieved”.] 
Improved Efficiency of Customs Processes 
56. 
The Bank supported the Government in improving the efficiency in customs processes 
through the Customs Institutional Strengthening Project. This operation aimed to reduce 
transaction costs, customs clearance time, and a total redesign of processes, among others. The 
project, approved in 2009, was cancelled 3 years later following the request of the Government 
due to the lack of optimal conditions to implement this project by the executing agency (SAT). 
[The development outcome was “not achieved”.] 
Strengthened Fiscal Transparency, Governance, and Accountability 
57. 
The Bank supported fiscal transparency, governance, and accountability by measuring 
the satisfaction of Congress and civil society with performance information available via a 
dedicated government website.  Through the support of the Results Based Management project, 
an active network and portal is now available for citizens since December 2012. The 
Institutional Strengthening of Congress IDF grants I and II supported the development and 
implementation of an integrated information management system to be used by Congress staff 
and members. However, the creation of the monitoring and evaluation system for Congressional 
performance and technical staff was not accomplished for lack of internal buy-in given changes 
of management. [The expected outcome was “partially achieved”.]   
Support the Improvement of Institutional Performance of Judiciaries 

61 

 
58. 
Through the Judicial Modernization Project, the Bank helped implement a new ICT 
network that provided timely information on demand and supply of justice services in the courts 
of the Federal District Government which was the only subnational jurisdiction that signaled its 
interest to access the existing credit line, as other states were reluctant to participate given the 
lack of coordination between the state governments and judiciaries. The new network has 
increased the information available. As of 2010, annual statistics reports have been published 
and disseminated. There is also an online bulletin providing the status and location of cases in 
courts. However, only 5 applications were uploaded to the ICT institutional platform from the 
10 targeted by the completion of the project. [The expected outcome was “partially 
achieved”]. 
Improved Capacity Building and Communication Practices 
59. 
By strengthening the institutional capacities of diverse federal and state agencies, the 
Bank helped improve the availability of information through the implementation of different 
grants and knowledge services. The IDF grant to support Federal Institute for Access to 
Information (IFAI) in the adoption of the electronic access to information system (INFOMEX) 
was successful in expanding and making operational this system to all 31 states and to several 
autonomous entities that were not initially considered.  The National Agrarian Registry (RAN) 
was also supported by the Bank through the Cadastral Information system IDF.  Within the 
scope of this grant, it was possible to strengthen RAN’s capacity to link geographical and legal 
information and develop a sound technological platform to integrate and analyze data. [The 
expected outcome was “achieved”]. 
IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE  
60. 
To fulfill the challenging needs and demands of a complex middle-income country 
like Mexico, the Bank successfully developed a thematic engagement model to improve 
selectivity, effectiveness, and efficiency in delivery in the context of limited IBRD capital.  This 
model reflects the transition to a more strategic and integrated client engagement that seeks to 
maximize the impact of the package of services (financial, knowledge, and convening services) 
offered by the WBG. Following the flexible design of the CPS, the model also accounts for the 
WBG’s ability to respond to client needs at federal and subnational levels. Based on the success 
of the thematic model in the design and implementation of a flexible country strategy, the 
performance of the World Bank at implementing the CPS FY08-13 has been rated as 
“satisfactory”. This rating focuses on two key dimensions: (a) the design of the strategy and 
(b) the implementation of the CPS program. 

A. CPS Design and Relevance 
61. 
The design of the original strategy was based on support on five engagement 
principles. The five country engagement principles are: (a) competitive IBRD pricing with a 
base-level borrowing of US$800 million per year; (b) flexibility in delivering emerging 
financial services and on-time knowledge products; (c) selectivity in areas of support by 
focusing on areas of comparative advantage and exiting programs with lack of demand or 
operational rigidities; (d) fast response in meeting the Government’s changing demands with 
tailored development solutions; and (e) enhanced coordination within the WBG. These 
principles of engagement were the result of client feedback and the Mexican authorities’ desire 
to maintain a strong relationship with the Bank. To implement these principles and enhance its 
delivery of knowledge services, the Bank proposed back in 2008 to base its support on a 
streamline approach. This approach anchored most lending in a large annual DPL supporting 

62 

 
Government’s national development priorities, accompanied by an enhanced package of non-
lending services.  
62. 
The implementation of these country engagement principles confirmed the 
relevance of the strategy and its alignment with Mexico’s development priorities; yet, the 
flexibility of the design made possible a timely and effective response by WBG to the 
changing needs of the country given the deteriorating 
international economic 
environment. The strategy took into account the need to adjust the program to Mexico’s 
changing circumstances and priorities as a result of the global economic downturn as well as the 
food crisis and the influenza pandemic. The Bank was able to rapidly align its strategy to the 
Government's 10 Point Program, which highlighted the countries immediate priorities under the 
NDP at the time of the crisis. During this crisis period, the Bank also effectively responded by 
reducing its average time of preparation for DPLs to 5 months in comparison to the 18 months 
experienced during the past CPS. The CPS was able to identify all critical risks and mitigation 
measures following the global crisis. None of them affected the implementation of the country’s 
portfolio. The CPS Results Matrix was updated during the CPSPR and then again with this 
CPSCR in order to include outcomes that were not originally considered. Most outcome 
indicators were relevant for ongoing CPS objective; and where new or better indicators were 
available (in four cases), they were used in the assessment. The CPSPR also mapped IFC’s 
strategic realignment to support the gradual recuperation of the economy by strengthening the 
financial sector, supporting investment in infrastructure and climate change, and helping 
competitive industries with a special focus on sectors with importance for employment 
generation such as SMEs. It maintained IFC’s pro-active portfolio management, while showing 
selectivity in its approach to new business to ensure high additionality and development impact.  
63. 
A rolling business plan where all WBG financial, knowledge, and convening 
products and packages were accounted for in real time (at entry and exit) helped in 
maintaining program monitoring and a degree of selectivity. The constant monitoring of the 
business plan confirmed the effective selection of areas of engagement and instruments, and 
helped assess the realism of the expected outcomes and the quality of the results framework. 
Business plans were also used to communicate World Bank program engagement with central 
and sector ministries, development partners, and the media.  
B. Implementing the Strategy 
64. 
The Bank has been highly successful in mobilizing resources and leveraging co-
financing of other organizations and donors to enhance the effectiveness of the overall support 
provided to the country. The Bank has focused its efforts in developing partnerships and 
financing packages in areas of common interest, particularly with other financial international 
institutions (e.g., IMF, IADB), civil society (e.g., Transparency International), bilaterals (e.g., 
Agence Française de Développement, AFD), the private sector/foundations, and the financial 
markets. One relevant example is co-financing of the Oportunidades program with the IADB. 
IFC also mobilized US$790 million from other private sector partners in the CPS period. 
65. 
The results-based thematic engagement approach implemented during the CPS 
period, particularly in regard to human capital mobilization, was highly effective in 
keeping strong client dialogue and business relations with the private and public sectors in 
critical areas where the WBG had comparative advantages and was also learning from 
Mexico’s experience. In particular, the business model of having sector leaders in large country 
offices was highly effective; these sector leaders are technically and operationally strong to 
provide inputs to sector management and capture knowledge as programs are implemented. 

63 

 
Decentralized sector leaders are able to develop coordination focal points and integrate sector 
agendas with sector ministries, country partners, and stakeholders, while representing sector 
business planning with country management units.  
66. 
Financial services took on an increasingly important role not only in crisis 
response but also in advancing Mexico’s leading role in the use of innovative financial 
solutions. At the federal level, Mexico took advantage of the embedded flexibility of IBRD 
loans to fix the interest rates on their loans. The Government also signed a master derivatives 
agreement with the Bank, enabling them to use IBRD hedging products to manage market risk 
of their overall debt portfolio. Moreover, the implementation of customized solutions provided 
competitive funding for subnational entities, allowing the Bank to continue its developmental 
work with these entities. IFC also committed US$580 million to Mexico’s financial sector, with 
volumes increasing in the latter part of the period.  
67. 
Moving forward after the crisis, the Bank adopted a results-based thematic 
engagement approach seeking to maximize the impact of Bank’s support in a complex 
middle-income country. The Bank implemented results-based programmatic knowledge 
services together with reimbursable advisory services (RAS). This model results in an emphasis 
on the synergies and linkages between the various activities that help achieve strategic 
objectives related to the theme, and not just on a set of stand-alone deliverables unconnected to 
each other. The activities and the associated results framework cover a two- to three-year time 
horizon. Dissemination and client feedback are an inherent part of this instrument now known 
as “programmatic approach”. At the same time, IFC advisory services had 24 active knowledge 
projects in Mexico across several business lines with 72 percent of them closing in the period 
rated successful or higher. Following client’s needs, the Bank also provided RAS products more 
strategically and packaged these services within the overall CPS knowledge agenda. Since 
2008, there has been a steady demand of the provision of RAS to the Government (three per 
year on average), which is indicative of the client’s appreciation for the breadth and depth of 
international experience that the Bank brings to complex development solutions. Mexico is 
among the largest RAS users in the Bank. 
68. 
The implementation of the program entailed close supervision and periodic 
reviews of the portfolio both at the project and country level. To tackle implementation 
issues, several CPPRs were held with the active participation of the Government and the Bank’s 
team. At the CPPRs, projects at risk of not achieving their development objectives and projects 
with slow disbursements were at the center of CMU and sector quality reviews. As a result of 
these discussions, action plans were agreed with government counterparts, including 
restructurings and partial cancellations, and strong monitoring and follow-through have ensured 
a healthy loan portfolio in the context of complex operational engagements in the energy and 
transport sectors. In addition to CPPRs, the CMU provided to government counterparts — 
through the Business Plan — with regular updates of its list of activities that classified all WBG 
activities by theme and type of instrument. This helped government to coordinate joint portfolio 
improvement efforts. Mexico’s fiduciary and safeguards framework is strong, and the Bank is 
adopting more frequently Mexico’s country systems in the implementation of its own projects. 
Harmonization of fiduciary procedures among other multilaterals and the supreme audit 
institution, through a memorandum of understanding, contributed to streamlined financial 
reporting. 

64 

 
69. 
A new communication strategy was successfully implemented to promote a new 
narrative around development impact of thematic multi-year engagements. First, 
opportunities were identified and prioritized to showcase the tailored suite of WBG services:  
(a) A new corporate narrative was used by senior management (e.g., in presentations, papers, 
OpEds) and in communication outreach (e.g., public presentations, brochures, websites).  
(b) Reputational risk management systems were established through social media monitoring.  
(c) Regional and corporate advocacy campaigns were implemented (e.g., World Development 
Report, LCR Flagship Middle Class, #whatwillittake campaign).  
Second, internal and external knowledge sharing was promoted (e.g., participation in Mexico 
book fairs in 3 major cities – Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Mexico City – reaching more than 
10,000 visitors). Finally, a web and online social media strategy was implemented and key 
partnerships were developed and consolidated. For example, between 2012 and 2013, there was 
an impressive increase in the number of web-based stories and public presentations displaying 
multi-year development solutions. During FY12, the number of web-based stores was almost 
zero (2 per year). By the third quarter of FY13, 114 stories and public presentations were 
produced. The procurement reform results story, for instance, was published in the Bank’s 
results story compendium and won a Regional award. 
70. 
Mexico continues to be among the Bank’s largest borrowers. The country is 
currently the largest IBRD borrower with US$14.78 billion outstanding debt as of September 
30, 2013, representing some 10 percent of the IBRD total portfolio. As of June 30, 2013, the 
active portfolio consisted of 13 IBRD projects and 5 full GEF operations for a net commitment 
of US$4,557.8 million of which 34 percent remained undisbursed (Table 2). The number of 
projects under implementation has remained in the range of 18-23 operations throughout the 
CPS period. The average age of IBRD projects dropped from 4 years in FY08 to 3 years in 
FY12, but increased to 4.1 years in FY13 with the extension of several energy and GEF 
projects. Since 2008, IEG has evaluated 22 projects of which 64 percent have been rated 
between “satisfactory” and “moderately satisfactory”.  Regarding quality at entry, 50 percent of 
these 22 projects were rated between “moderately satisfactory” and “highly satisfactory”, while 
77 percent were rated in this same range for quality at supervision. Average of projects at risk 
has remained in 4 projects per year and involved complex innovative energy projects with 
procurement issues that needed to be restructured. Efforts to further increase implementation 
have focused on the gradual adoption of country systems.

In FY13, IFC committed portfolio in Mexico reached US$1,584 million, of which 
US$940 million is outstanding (disbursed) (Table 3). The portfolio consists of 54 different 
clients in more than 14 industries. Disbursement rates have increased in the past two fiscal years 
above the FY08-11 average, reaching US$902 million in FY13. Development outcome scores 
of Mexico’s portfolio are also improving: although the percentage of projects rated successful in 
the CPS period is below the IFC average; FY13 results were rated 81 percent successful or 
higher. For IFC as a whole, Mexico ranks number 7 of the 138 countries representing 3 percent 
of IFC total portfolio as of end-June 2013.

V. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
72. 
The FY08-13 CPS was designed to be flexible and innovative in responding to 
Mexico's development needs. This flexibility allowed the Bank to respond expeditiously to the 
Government’s requests when 
the global economic downturn hit 
the country. The 
implementation of Mexico’s past country strategies reflect a transition to a more strategic and 
integrated client engagement maximizing the package of services offered by the WBG. The 
CPS was able to improve alignment, operational efficiency, and impact through the use of more 
focused interventions and programmatic knowledge approaches, greater wholesaling resource 
and budget mobilization, real-time learning and adaptation, and exit of program areas where 
value added, comparative advantage, and impact was no longer aligned with the evolving 
program.  
73. 
Results framework and flexibility. At the time of the progress report the results 
framework was adjusted to reflect the more selective approach that was adopted in the 
meantime and to identify improved quantitative indicators. Corporate requirements at the time 
asked for only one progress report, leaving little flexibility for additional adjustments. 
Therefore, when for example the climate change agenda emerged in the strategic agenda with 
the client, it could only be included as a separate outcome at the time of this completion report. 
The changed corporate guidelines for CAS products now allow more flexibility to adjust the 
program at several points during implementation, and the next CPS should take advantage of it. 
74. 
Working with subnational clients. A MoU with the State of Oaxaca proved to be a 
successful strategy to support the poorest states or regions of Mexico. The MoU itself is not 
designed to be restrictive, with the nature of objectives, instruments included, and level of 
formality dependent upon the level of depth of engagement. The MoU has also served to deepen 
dialogue, monitor implementation, and assess impact within the framework of a programmatic 
engagement. Hence, the Bank shall continue to close the knowledge gap by working at the 
subnational level to support poor states in Mexico following the experience thus far in 

66 

 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
supporting the State of Oaxaca Annex 3 contains a short summary of the Oaxaca MOU and 
result of the partnership. 
75. 
Continued support of Mexico’s role as a global knowledge leader. As an 
innovative middle-income country, Mexico has increased its engagement in learning with other 
developing countries across a wide variety of subject areas. During the previous CPS period, 
Mexico engaged in approximately 33 knowledge exchanges, and the country is widely 
recognized as a global player on environmental sustainability and a pioneer among developing 
countries in climate change policy and negotiations. The WBG should thus continue supporting 
the Government in exchanging knowledge with other countries. There is a strong potential for 
global knowledge brokering with the Bank as the global connector.  
76. 
Exposure limits. With the Government being so close to the single borrower limit, it 
is advisable to agree with our counterparts on a very selective package of financial, knowledge 
and convening services with customized results-focused development solutions in areas where 
the Bank can provide value added. In this context, it would also be important for the WBG to 
continue with its efforts in leveraging resources from the WBG and other development partners 
in support of the Government’s program. 
77. 
Bank-IFC-MIGA cooperation. Bank-IFC cooperation on specific areas around their 
core competencies should improve effectiveness. Strategic coordination in the implementation 
of complementary interventions by the Bank and IFC is critical in achieving common goals in 
areas such as improving competitiveness and business climate, access to financial markets, and 
infrastructure development activities. MIGA engagement with Mexico is emerging, and IBRD 
and IFC would work closely to support MIGA’s successful in-country transition. 
78. 
Lending instruments. During crisis periods, the use of the additional financing 
instrument proved simpler, faster, and more cost-effective for the borrower, compared to other 
lending tools. Budget support loans (DPLs) can pave the way for many other Bank-financed 
operations; and in turn, those operations enrich the dialogue to develop further sequenced DPLs. 
Also, during the economic crisis, DPLs proved to be effective tools in sustaining progress and 
protecting long-term reform agendas in the face of negative external shocks. Multi-sector 
SWAP operations may not be practical in the Mexico context since they require significant 
effort to design and supervise and potentially dilute the Bank’s ability to provide just-in-time 
policy advice and technical assistance.  
79. 
GAC. Although anti-corruption measures aim to limit exposure to fraud and 
corruption risks in MIC countries with strong fiduciary frameworks, these same measures limit 
the flexibility to quickly prepare and disburse operations. Particularly in emergency situations, 
there is room for further work to find balance in the way the Bank engages on corruption issues.  
80. 
Knowledge services. Trust fund resources were indispensable for providing technical 
assistance to advance the government reform program and to strengthen coordination among 
key stakeholders. In addition, grant resources were very important to finance aspects of studies 
that may be overlooked, especially in areas of environmental and social concerns. Reimbursable 
advisory services can be a powerful instrument, but the Bank could avoid over specifying 
procedures. The Bank is working to have one negotiated standard reimbursable contract, which 
should facilitate negotiations. Programmatic approaches proved to be remarkable instruments in 
the focalization and prioritization of Bank’s interventions in Mexico. In general, further 
dissemination is required to spread the findings of several Bank studies to the local level. This is 
very important since many issues to be solved require changes at the subnational level.

Budget support loans provide timely and 
successful financial assistance to the 
Government but impact can be limited by 
constrains. 
The interests and political strengths of 
stakeholders and groups in the reform process 
may help tailor successful reforms and 
provide realistic expectations of reform 
outcomes. 
Important pending issues remain in terms of 
the fiscal sustainability and distributional 
equity of the Mexican fiscal system. Research 
regarding the impact of further reforms is 
likely to be demanded in the future.

As part of the reform process supported by the Bank, an 
originally proposed 2 percent consumption tax was 
substituted by a 1 percent increase in the general VAT 
rate. Minor modifications were also introduced to the 
proposal for the enhancement of the income tax regime, 
while an excise tax on beer increase and the newly 
introduced excise tax on telecommunications were 
adjusted downward. These modifications contributed to 
moderating the increase in non-oil tax revenue as a 
percent of GDP from 9.5 percent in 2009 to 10.0 percent 
in 2010, instead of the 10.8 percent under the 
administration’s initial proposal. Despite a more modest 
outcome, the non-oil tax revenue continued to increase 
from an average of 8.7 percent of GDP during the 
previous administration (2001-2006) to 9.5 percent 
during the first half of the 2007-2012 administration. 

Although non-oil tax revenue is expected to be 10.0 
percent in 2013, and decline thereafter based on the 
Mexico 2012 IMF Article IV Consultation (released in

As part of the reform process supported by the Bank, it 
is important to notice that programmable spending 
increased from 18.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 19.9 
percent in 2010 (more than the 18.7 percent anticipated 
in the DPL, but down from 20.5 percent observed in 
2009, partly explained by the strong recovery in 2010); 
and the public sector borrowing requirements increased 
from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 3.4 percent in 2010 
(slightly more than the 3.1 percent expected in the 
DPL). A program of knowledge services built on the 
reform agenda of the DPL.  A PKS in Fiscal Mgmt. was 
successful in informing policymakers of the fiscal 
pressures Mexico could face, contributing to the 
dialogue between the Bank and the gov’t on the fiscal 
reform.  
Achieved and Exceeded. 
Bank interventions supported medium-term financial 
institutions building activities. A package of ongoing 
financial and technical operations with BANSEFI 
contributed to provide access to financial services to 
more than 600,000 low-income families in marginal 
areas.  In rural areas the number of outlets offering 
financial services rose nearly threefold to 1.45 per 
10,000 adults. For Mexico as a whole the number of 
outlets providing financial services increased to 20,287 
from 10,354 in 2008. Crisis support included (i) a crisis 
simulation exercise that achieved all its objectives; (ii) 
several grants for assessing the poverty and distributional 
impacts of the financial crisis also were very successful. 

IFC supported the financial sector on enhancing 
competitiveness and promoting investments in new areas 
for private sector participation.  IFC worked together 
with (i) SHF in developing HF products aimed at lower 
income households; (ii) worked together with 
Progresemos to develop local capacity in efficiently 
servicing microloans in frontier regions of Mexico,

            (2010): 897,000          

Achieved and Exceeded. 
The number of beneficiaries hired through PET 
increased from 365,000 in 2008 to 897,000 thousand in 
2010, surpassing the CPS outcome indicator. According 
to the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Review 
(P118070 - April, 2012): “The number of beneficiaries 
and number of work shifts contracted through PET 
exceeded targets, and both more than doubled. Efficacy 
in labor sector policies is rated substantial.” 

The Economic Response DPL supported the expansion 
of the Temporary Employment Program (PET). The 
DPL built on the Bank’s close collaboration through 
knowledge services with the Ministry of Social 
Development (SEDESOL). An analytical study on the 
PET showed that the program was able, as a response to 
the 2009 crisis, to increase its allocation of resources 
towards regions with increased levels of unemployment. 
A series of FBS provided a diagnostic and an action plan 
to increase income and employment for the urban poor 
among other findings. Two MoUs coordinated the 
delivery of a series of poverty diagnostics, policy papers, 
and micro-simulation exercises on the targeting of social 
programs, poverty diagnostics, labor productivity for the

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

It is important that more effort is exerted in 
improving the quality of surveys and 
provisions should be made for the linking of 
the survey data to administrative data. 
The publishing of aggregate tabular data on 
reported gross income and taxable income (by 
all sources and by type of tax payer) would 
allow evidence-based adjustments to the 
ENIGH data (either through the application of 
factors that vary across the income 
distribution and by individual characteristics, 
or through re-weighting the data). This would 
be a significant improvement on the status 
quo. 
There is also need for significant research on 
the behavioral response to taxation, both in 
terms of labor supply, and in terms of the 
classical incidence of indirect taxes. 
A labor reform bill was already put forth by 
the new administration. The WB produced a 
package of policy briefs for the new 
government; among them a note on labor 
issues that highlights the issue of 
productivity.  The ongoing work via several 
trust funds will be an important contribution 
to efforts to collaborate with the new 
government on labor productivity.

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

To make well informed decisions, the 
government should weight the tradeoffs of 
policy options based on considerations such 
as cost, sequential importance, technical 
difficulty, risks, and impact. 
Policy options could promise greater benefits 
in the longer run, others could be targeted for 
quick action.

5.3 percent 

Baseline (2008): 10.4% 
Target (2010): 5.3% 
Actual (2010): 5.3% 

Status and Evaluation Summary 

Achieved. 
The Economic Response DPL and a package of 
knowledge and convening services on agricultural trade 
supported Mexico’s efforts in reducing trade costs.  The 
GoM reduced tariff rates and increased the number of 
duty free tariff lines for imports from countries without 
trade agreements or tariff preferences negotiated by 
Mexico, resulting in a simpler tariff structure. The 
average general MFN tariff rate fell from 10.4 percent in 
2008 to 5.3 percent in 2010, and will be further reduced 
to 4.3 percent by the end of 2013.  Based on IEG 
Reviews of Bank operations (P112264 – ICR April 17, 
2012): “Efficiency in trade sector policies is rated high”. 

In addition, several indicators were used to measure 
progress towards simplification of tariff regime. The 
reduction in rates and increase in the number of duty free 
tariff lines resulted in a simpler tariff structure. The 
number of duty free tariff lines was increased from 20 
percent in 2008 to 58.7 percent in 2010 and to 61 percent 
in 2011. The reforms supported by the Bank rationalized 
the borrower’s tariff structure, reduced distortions, and 
simplified Mexico’s trade regime.  

Regarding customs processes, the Government also 
implemented other reforms with the active support of the 
World Bank Group aimed at reducing trade costs, 
facilitating trade, and improving customs administration. 
Although the Mexico Customs Institutional 
Strengthening Project (47396-MX) was cancelled (see 
outcome 25), the Bank supported the creation of the 
Single Trade Window (STW) as part of the 
Strengthening the Business Environment for Enhanced 
Economic Growth DPL (Report 58431-MX, December 
15, 2010). The STW became operational for the 21 trade 
processes linked to the General Customs Administration 
(part of SAT) in mid-January 2012. Moreover, the 
CATT improved trade quality by promoting excellence 
in customs performance management.

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

When project finance is not additional, but 
rather a source of financing for the overall 
fiscal budget, a clear understanding about 
how budget for project-supported activities is 
provided is essential. 
More care is needed to mitigate against the 
impact on projects due to a change in 
administration (as happened with respect to 
this project in 2006) that is often 
accompanied by changes that reach far down 
into the executive.  
In a sophisticated middle-income country like 
Mexico, it is not possible to ring-fence a 
Bank-financed project from the broader, more 
complex government program. In the case of 
this project, as the size of the PRONABES 
program expanded, project restructuring 
could have included a revision in the project 
financing plan to include all government 
financing to PRONABES.

Moreover, tax simplification and reduction in the 
number of tax declarations and payment procedures by 
businesses benefited the private sector with substantial 
time (40 percent) and cost savings (over 0.1 percent of 
GDP). Although the number of agreements to streamline 
public procurements procedures fell short of the DPL

 According 
to an 
analysis done by CONEVAL, extreme 
poverty levels would have been even higher, 
particularly in rural areas, in the absence of 
social 
protection 
programs

as 
Oportunidades. 
The additional financing instrument became 
the best mechanism 
to continue Bank’s 
support to Oportunidades. The use of the AF 
was simpler, faster, and more cost-effective 
for the borrower, compared to other lending 
tools. 
CCT programs cannot be thought of in 
isolation 
from other social policies. In 
particular, achieving 
the human capital 
accumulation goals sought by CCT programs 
will typically require adaptation of the supply 
of social services, 
including expanding 
coverage and improving quality. 
CCT programs will not be able to break the 
intergenerational transmission of poverty if 
there are no jobs or adequate livelihoods 
available when assisted children become 
earners in their own right.

assistance type activities, it is desirable to 
build in mechanisms that pace the

individual indicators that are not feasible 
given the changes brought about by the 
project. 
Analysis of the female labor force

the project leveraged 910 million dollars in counterpart

System Carbon Finance’ project has contributed to 
improve bus system energy efficiency by replacing 368, 
old, small and mid-sized, gasoline and gas –mainly 
Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG)– units with 105 articulated 
passenger diesel buses. This contributed to lower overall 
fuel consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHG) to the extent that articulated buses consume less 
fuel per passenger/km. 

Knowledge: 
FY09: AAA FBS in Massive Urban 
Transport Federal Program (P110474) 

This target was achieved given that 368 buses were 
scrapped or disassembled (no longer generating 
emissions) with support from the Bank. Old buses were 
then replaced with new articulated buses which consume 
less fuel per passenger km. Emissions reductions in the 
period Nov. 1, 2009 to Oct. 31, 2010 (report received by 
the Bank on July 22, 2011) were 50,180 tons CO2/year, 
of which modal change were 38,790 tons.

Achieved. 
Through the Framework for Green Growth DPL, the 
Bank supported the government to further develop the 
regulatory, monitoring and financial framework to 
achieve low emissions in the transport and energy 
sectors.  In parallel to the Green Growth DPL, the 
introduction of Climate Friendly Measures in Transport 
supported the design of the BRT corridors in Mexico 
City (Metrobus) and the creation of the institutional, 
regulatory, and business framework for operating the 
BRT system. Metrobus has now become a more robust 
agency in technical terms and is mobilizing 800,000 
passengers per day. The ‘Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit 
System Carbon Finance’ project has also contributed to 
improve bus productivity by serving more passengers 
with lesser number of units and increase modal share of 
large buses. As of end 2012, (i) 368 buses have been 
scrapped or disassembled (no longer generating 
emissions); (ii) modal shift is at 18 percent, well above 
the 10 target; and (iii) demand continues to grow 
reaching an average of 290,000 rides per weekday with 
peaks of over 300,000 trips per day.  

(The indicator chosen for the CPSPR was a first attempt to reflect a 
quantitative value on the implementation of a Clean Development 
Mechanism in the transport sector in Mexico (i.e. Mexico City BRT 
system). Yet, in the CPSCR, we do acknowledge that this indicator does 
not completely capture the overall engagement of the Bank in this area 
and does not fully capture the target outcome. As a result, we also 
report other activities that qualitatively reflect the Bank successful 
support to foster technology, regulatory and institutional changes in 
the public transport sector) 

Partially Achieved. 
Outcomes aiming at improving federal housing systems 
were partially achieved. A loan approved in FY09 to 
support mortgage lending, including greater down-
market access via Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF) 
successfully strengthened SHF’s financial position and 
stabilized the housing market during the crisis. Overall, 
the project successfully contributed to the achievement 
of the higher-order outcome indicator goal of 1 million 
housing solutions per year between 2008 and 2012. Yet, 
the project did not achieve the expected gradual

A DPL can pave the way for many other 
Bank-financed operations, and in turn, those 
operations enrich the dialogue to develop the 
DPL.  
It is difficult to overcome political differences 
between the Federal District’s and the State of 
Mexico’s administrations.  The metropolitan 
character of some of the projects (i.e. Mexico 
City metropolitan area) and the involvement 
of the State of Mexico, which shares the same 
transport and air quality related problems, 
was limited.  
Development of transport baseline 
methodologies needs to be further 
encouraged. Similarly, further field testing of 
bus technologies is needed for defining 
emission standards and for the decision-
making process on alternative bus 
technologies for public transport. 
Introduction of new bus technologies and low 
carbon fuels needs to be encouraged to form a 
larger share of the modal and fuel mix.

relatively modest scale of assistance offered. 
Contrary to down-market aims, establishing a 
sound reputation in financial markets and 
sustaining a high quality and expanding 
portfolio can lead a new mortgage financier 
up-market, by targeting higher income 
borrowers with larger loans. 
In general terms, Technical Assistance 
Lending has limited benefits in a MIC 
environment. Traditionally TALs offer a 
means of supporting nascent and weak 
institutions and of preparing for investment 
operations. In a MIC, however, the costs of 
setting up and operating public institutions 
are covered by existing government revenue. 
Both sector wide assistance and institutional 
development remain elusive for MICs. 
HUTAL’s attempt to implement sector-wide 
reform by assigning simultaneous (and 
complementary) tasks and technical 
assistance funding to various implementing 
agencies proved frustrating for its failure to 
foster agreement even on a strategy for 
unification, let alone sector unification itself, 
and costly for increasing supervision costs. 
Direct IBRD-support for infrastructure at the 
subnational level in Mexico is both feasible 
and important. However, a new paradigm for 
delivering this type of support needs to be 
formulated to be more efficient.   
Multi-sector SWAP operations may not be 
practical. This requires significant effort to 
design and supervise, and potentially dilute 
the Bank’s ability to provide good policy 
advice and technical assistance. 
It is necessary to distinguish form from 
substance. Most of the innovation (OBD, 
SWAP, National Program, and Country 
Systems) included in some of the water sector 
DPLs were internal Bank preoccupations 
barely understood by the client at the state 
and municipal levels.

satisfactory degree of improvement was observed in 
operational and financial performance of water utilities 
that participated in the program. Non-revenue water 
showed a reduction of 4% in relation to the starting point 
(set at 46.6%).  The recovery tariff increased in absolute 
terms of 31% far exceeding the target set in the PAD of 
10%. 
Through the successful rehabilitation and modernization 
of irrigation infrastructure, and the adoption of improved 
farm irrigation application systems, the Bank 
significantly impacted water use efficiency. Moreover, 
the Water Sector DPL, approved in FY10, had a 
significant institutional impact. In an effort to support 
selected Mexican States to improve their provision and 
performance of infrastructure services (including water 
supply and sanitation), the Bank worked with the State 
of Guanajuato in the implementation of the 
Decentralized Infrastructure Development Loan. A 
substantial improvement was observed in the accounted-
for water during the life of the project, from 129.6 to 
171.5 million m3 between 2005 and 2008—i.e., 
equivalent to a 32 percent increase. 
IFC provided capacity advisory support to the municipal 
water company (OPDM) during the design and 
implementation of a wastewater recycling plant in the 
municipality of Tlalnepantla. Additionally, in 2010 IFC 
invested in Water Capital a leasing company that 
provides energy efficiency, renewable energy, and 
supply and demand water management solutions tailored 
to the specific needs of its customers. 
Achieved. 
Mexico has been recognized as an international leader in 
forest management.  Its PES (Payment of Environmental 
Services) program is the second largest in the world in 
terms of total area enrolled. With the support of the 
Environmental Services project and a GEF grant, the 
Bank aimed to enhance the provision of environmental 
services of national and global significance and secure 
long-term sustainability. The project had an important 
impact in increasing hydrological, biodiversity 
conservation, and carbon sequestration services. By the 
end of the project, 1.5 million additional hectares were

For modernization of irrigation projects in 
Mexico aiming to have impacts on increased 
agricultural competitiveness, it is necessary to 
establish a common strategy between 
institutions such as SAGARPA and 
CONAGUA that forces them to setup a joint 
M&E system and report on the same 
indicators – not only in terms of number of 
hectares with modernized systems and 
improved irrigation technologies, but also on 
indicators of agriculture productivity, labor

Trust Fund resources were indispensable for 
providing TA to advance the government

coordination among key stakeholders. 
Development of robust monitoring and 
evaluation is important for the credibility of 
PES programs. The credibility of 
environmental services programs relies not 
only on fiduciary monitoring but also mainly 
on quantification of the actual impacts of 
environmental services.

Partially Achieved. 
The Bank supported the Government’s rural 
electrification program through a combination of 
investment operations and grants from the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF). Both projects, however, 
showed limited progress due to a combination of 
complex procurement processes and project 
implementation difficulties. By the end of the CPS 
period, the number of households electrified with solar 
photovoltaic technology had not increased, given that the 
solar farms had not yet started to operate. After a 
restructuring of the project, including a one-year 
extension of the closing date (to June 2014) and a 
simplification of the project’s implementations 
arrangements, the bidding process for the first set of 
subprojects financed by the Bank was launched during 
the first quarter of 2013, and it is expected that the next 

The fact that the Bank was one of the first

Indicator: (a) 919 small 
and medium-sized agri-
businesses adopting 
environmentally 
sustainable technologies; 

bidding processes will advance during the next CPS 
period. Although it is hard at this time to evaluate if the 
development outcome will be achieved within the new 
time frames, progress during the CPS period was slow 
and the outcome is not observed yet. However, since the 
end of 2012 and based on lessons learned, the Bank hired 
a local consultant to help smooth out the implementation 
of these projects. 

The main intervention under this outcome, the Integrated 
Energy Services project (P088996), was focused on rural 
development. As the majority of people living in the 
communities targeted are indigenous, the Project is still 
considered an indigenous people development initiative. 
In preparation for the Project , the Mexican Ministry of 
Energy (SENER), in coordination with the governments 
of targeted States and Municipalities, undertook a 
systematic social assessment that included: 
- A comprehensive analysis of the social context 
and the applicable legal and institutional 
framework. 
- Baseline information (demographic, social, 
cultural, political, and other). 
- A review of stakeholder dynamics (including 
institutions). 
- A structured consultation to assess the potential 
positive and negative effects derived from the 
Project and to identify preventing or mitigating 
measures. 
Partially Achieved.  
As part of the Bank’s support in the agriculture area, the 
ongoing Sustainable Rural Development project is well 
on target to meet this outcome. By the end of 2012, 770 
small and medium-sized agri-businesses adopted 
environmental sustainable technologies (i.e. renewable 
energy sources, energy efficient technologies, and/or 
sustainable waste management and biomass conversion), 
equivalent to 600,000 tons of CO2 equivalent avoided 
(close to the original target of 919 SMEs and 770,000 
tons of CO2 equivalent). Moreover, the Efficient 
Lighting and Appliances project promoted Mexico’s 
efficient use of energy and the mitigation of climate

Based on technical assistance, a viable 
strategy to scale-up renewable energy in any 
country should include at least the following 
elements, which are mentioned in Mexico’s

21. Reduce GHG (CO2) 
emission through the 
adoption of emission-

Indicator: Successful 
piloting of renewable

(The CPSPR indicator did not 
include baseline and targets. The 
Bank, however, supported two 
wind projects in Mexico to 
achieve this outcome: La Venta 
II, through Carbon Fund 
financing, and La Venta III, 
through GEF financing. These 
two projects contributed to the 
reduction of GHG through the 
adoption emission-reduction 
technologies).  

Based on these two 
projects, a quantitative 
indicator for the reduction 
of GHG is the following:

change by increasing the use of energy efficient 
technologies at the residential level. Specifically, less 
consumption of electricity favored the environment, as 
an emission of about 865,000 tons of CO2 was avoided 
with the 22.9 million light bulbs that were changed 
during 2012.  

IFC, through its SBA, worked with projects that co-
finance studies to prove the financial viability of 
adopting cleaner technologies, such as a study to install a 
Waste Heat Recovery for 3 MW power generation in a 
cement plant. The study identified potential savings of 
21,000 tCO2e/year. 

La Venta III was one the first wind parks in 
the Tehuantepec Isthmus. It was the slowest 
to start operations but it paved the ground for 
several others to come and set the standards 
in terms of environmental and social 
safeguards. 
As part of the Waste Management project, the 
alliance between the public and private sector 
incentivized each part to guarantee the 
successful development of the project and 
created institutional memory which is 
important to reduce the impacts of rotational 
management but, especially, to ensure that 
experiences and practices learned are not lost.  

Achieved.  
The Bank supports two wind projects in Mexico: La 
Venta II, through Carbon Fund financing, and La Venta 
III, through GEF financing. Both wind farms are 
operational. La Venta III (i.e. the wind power Large-
Scale Renewable Energy Development project) started 
operations in October 2012, after facing many hurdles, 
from the failure of the first bidding process for the 
construction of the plant to social tensions which slowed 
down the entire project. Yet, it is still expected that Bank 
tariff subsidy for the generation of wind energy at La 
Venta III will contribute to a reduction of around 
247,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year of operation in 
the upcoming years. La Venta III, however, has paved 
the way for the development of wind energy in Mexico, 
as it was the first bidding process to be launched for the 
provision of wind energy under the Independent Power 
Producer scheme. Today more than 1,300 MW capacity 
of wind power energy are in operation (under the IPP 
and auto abastecimiento schemes). Prices of wind 
energy have decreased (from US$11c/kWh to 
US$6c/kWh), demonstrating the commercial viability of 
this technology. It could thus be argued that the Bank 
achieved its objective of piloting renewable energy 
production with GEF/CN financing, simultaneously 
achieving the overall objective or reducing GHG (CO2)

expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
approximately 600,000 tCO2 per year. 

Achieved and Exceeded. 
The Bank tailored knowledge and convening services 
around a series of annual DPLs that successfully 
supported the Government of Mexico’s effort under its 
National Climate Change Strategy to mainstream climate 
change consideration in public policy. Proof of this was 
the approval and publication of the PECC (Special 
Program for Climate Change) in Mexico’s official 
Gazette in August 2009, which was fundamental to 
create a comprehensive policy framework for reduction 
of emissions across sectors, and set a national emission 
reduction target.  Moreover, state climate change action 
plans have been completed or they are currently under 
preparation for 26 states. The five states that have

The effectiveness of Bank support depends on 
commitment of counterparts to implement 
reforms and change management. During an 
election period, the Bank should support a 
sustainable reform process thru sensitizations 
and capacity building program for 
management and operational staff. 
FBS can be a powerful instrument but the 
Bank needs to avoid over quantification, and 
flexibility and adaptation along the way is 
critical. 
Frequent supervision of the program, both by 
top authorities and an independent audit, will 
allow concerned parties to anticipate 
corrective actions in the face of errors, new 
challenges or deviations that might take place 
with respect to the results expected in each 
phase.  
Identifying strengths and/or weaknesses of 
working teams to enhance the former and 
redress the latter in a timely fashion. 
Strong ownership from the Government along 
with an almost inexistent turnover in the staff

Achieved.  
Through an IDF the Bank contributed to the 
establishment of an online space or information system 
for the dissemination of successful experiences, 
training material, socio-economic information and 
social demographics.  The grant for the creation of a 
Public Observatory of Municipal Management, took 
the work developed under a previous grant (TF051739) 
and identified areas where local governments could be 
improved such as their managerial and administrative 
capacities to generate social and urban development. 
The grant made possible the compilation of these 
materials and good practices on a public website that 
other municipalities –not covered by the grant— could 
reference, and provided the means to, for example, 
prepare personnel who would further train local public 
servants in an improved way.  This space has helped 
preserve and share municipal management experiences 
and innovations.  By end-December 2011, 20 new 
products were added (200% above the 2010 target) to 
the Municipal Management Observatory website, and 
in addition, 120 new databases were also incorporated.   
Not Achieved. 
At the request of the GoM, the Customs project was 
cancelled; hence the development outcome was not 
achieved.  However, the Bank provided support to 
improve the GoM’s custom processes measuring 
customs performance through the implementation of the 
CATT.

With the support of the Results Based Mgmt project, a 
portal containing financial and non-financial 
performance information about the budget and its 
process is available for citizens as of end-December 
2012.  Also, through two IDFs to Congress, the Bank 
was able to strengthen its institutional capacities by 
developing an integrated information management 
system. By end 2011, the system was operating in 12 
areas. However, the creation of the monitoring and 
evaluation system for Congressional performance and 
technical staff was not achieved.  Several knowledge 
products were produced that supported the enhancement 
of fiscal transparency and accountability at the 
subnational level. Such is the case of the work done in 
Aguascalientes through an IDF Grant.

The PKS shows a remarkable milestone in the 
focalization of the Bank's PSMG 
interventions in Mexico. It is prioritizing the 
Bank’s work on public financial management 
at the federal level of government and has 
opened a new entry point of reform with 
subnational governments with the 
implementation of the Oaxaca RAAP. 
When working with Congress, implementing 
the project gradually proved to be the wisest 
decision considering the nature of the 
institution.  
The Bank is a key development partner in this 
institutional environment by contributing to 
convene the reform among the different 
actors, to provide a safety net against certain 
political interests/biases to the reform itself, 
and, moreover, playing an important role at 
the fiduciary level since it helps the institution 
to prevent potential practices 
that could 
distort

service applications uploaded to the institutional network 
that served as backbone of the management model have 
increased user confidence and stakeholder satisfaction in 
the tribunal system of justice of the GDF.  New ICT 
network has increased public information available. As 
of Dec 2011, 620,896 judicial decisions were filed in the 
“Judicial Resolution Consultation System” and could be 
accessed by staff. Access to these decisions by the public 
was expected by June 2012.  Annual statistics reports 
have been published and disseminated since 2010.   
Annual reports are also available on line.  There is an 
online judicial bulletin that provides the status and 
location of cases in courts. In the four target criminal 
judicial centers, there are 22 kiosks available to the 
public for case status consultations.   
The first survey on user satisfaction was carried out in 
2010 by an independent survey firm (EPADEC).  More 
than half of respondents (55%) were satisfied with 
justice services in DF.  The level of satisfaction with the 
image, attention and functioning of the target criminal 
courts was 63%.  Users’ satisfaction reported by this 
survey was higher than the trust in the justice system 
reported for the whole country by Americas Barometer, 
LAPOP, in 2010. 
Achieved. 
The Bank helped strengthen and improve the 
institutional capacity of several institutions such as the 
Federal Institute for Access to Information (IFAI) and 
the National Agrarian Registry (RAN), through the 
implementation of different grants and knowledge 
services.  
The IDF supporting IFAI contributed to expand the 
INFOMEX system to all 31 states.  While a system for 
access to information was in place at the federal level, 
subnational governments presented a different scenario. 
There was a lack of institutional framework and tools to 
provide adequate responses; moreover, the state 
governments were facing an enlarged demand for public 
information in a context of increased openness and 
democratization.  At the time the TF054316 closed, 
1,569 entities were operating INFOMEX. At least 30 
states, 449 municipalities, 20 state legislative bodies and 

institutional reforms should also pay attention 
to demands of users or potential users, in 
particular from vulnerable groups.  
Working at subnational level poses additional 
challenges in a complex sector. 
Major cancellations and/or reallocations 
impacting the PDO and results framework 
must be accompanied by comprehensive 
restructurings. 
A realistic assessment of justice sector issues 
at the early stages of preparation process is 
essential as a basis for quality project design. 
Justice projects should be structured around a 
problem-solving strategy and should engage 
all actors required to implement a proposed 
solution. 
Civil society participation is critical at all 
stages of design and implementation of 
justice projects.

CPSCR Annex 3. Emerging Subnational Engagement – State of Oaxaca 
1. 
The World Bank has also supported since 2011 the reform agenda for inclusive growth 
of Oaxaca – one of the states with the highest levels of poverty and the lowest levels of 
economic performance among the Mexican States – through a strategic programmatic 
partnership. The Bank and the Government of Oaxaca signed in June 2011 a MoU, including 
multi-year, multi-sectoral support to the state, combining a package of knowledge, convening 
and financial services, structured around four areas: public sector modernization, sustainable 
development, finance and private sector, and human development.  
2. 
In keeping with the flexible design of the CPS, the MoU with Oaxaca was developed 
as an instrument for coordinating AAA, loans, and grants around the critical development 
challenges at the subnational level in Mexico. The approach of this partnership is similar to a 
country’s CPS, and it represents a departure from an operational or ESW-centric approach to 
sector dialogue and development solutions. It recognizes the need to retain long-term 
engagement based on agreed objectives and development challenges not subject to the 
unanticipated changes in financing and knowledge needs in particular sectors.  In addition, the 
Bank and IFC worked together in the identification of the areas where the active engagement of 
IFC on its own or jointly with the Bank was needed, leading to IFC providing advisory services 
related to public private partnerships 
3. 
The MoU was originally established for two years, 2011-2013, and it was renewed for 
another two years on June 2013. As a result of this partnership  
(a) Technical capacity has been built on the government counterparts in the different areas 
of reform (e.g., training and workshops in strategic sector planning, public investment, 
water utility management, forestry management), and advisory services and initial 
diagnostics for key public-private partnerships projects have been provided.   
(b) The Bank has informed policy design and implementation.  
(c) Resources have been mobilized, leveraging co-financing of other organizations, such as 
the UNDP, the MacArthur Foundation, and Transparency International–Mexico.  
(d) A concurrence of key national and local stakeholders has been brought together to the 
table to participate in a specific development agenda.  
(e) Concrete and fundamental tools for efficient policymaking have been generated. 
4. 
Some of the main outputs of this partnership to modernize the State of Oaxaca’s public 
institutions and policies have been: (a) design and implementation of a methodology to structure 
strategic sector planning oriented to results; (b) design proposals for an integrated public 
financial management and public investment management systems; (c) strengthened tax 
administration capacity; (d) map of existing social programs; (e) exchange of good practice to 
reduce maternal mortality; (f) support the consolidation of rural financial institutions; (g) 
exchange of good practice on public–private partnerships; (h) strengthen water utility 
management; (i) Atlas of Climate and Climate Change; and (j) exchange of good practice on 
sustainable development.

ANNEX 3. MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  

1. 
Mexico’s solid economic performance stands out in a global environment of higher 
volatility and lower growth. Economic activity fully recovered from the severe contraction 
experienced following the global financial crisis as a rebound and continued growth of export, 
domestic investment, and consumption managed to close the output gap by the end of 2012. A 
track-record of prudent monetary and fiscal policies is providing the framework, confidence, 
and buffers required for a continued expansion of economic activity in line with potential 
output, which is supported by strong external trade, investment and financial ties. Progress on 
an ambitious structural reform agenda, aimed at enhancing productivity may spur investment 
and eventually raise the level of productivity and economic growth in a sustained way. 
2. 
The Mexican economy rapidly recovered from the impact of the global financial 
crisis and experienced, more recently, a cyclical downturn.  After a severe contraction 
following the global financial crisis, resurgence in demand for Mexican manufactured exports 
led to a sharp rebound in economic activity.  The output gap, generated by the 2008-2009 
contraction, was expected to be closed towards the end of 2012 after the economy experienced 
an average annual growth of 4.4 percent between 2010 and 2012.  More recently, a global 
slowdown led to a significant deceleration of economic growth in Mexico widening the output 
gap again.  Weakening economic growth, industrial production and, in particular a stagnation in 
overall import demand in the U.S. had an adverse impact on growth of Mexican manufactured 
exports as of the second half of 2012.  With an improvement of economic indicators in the U.S., 
the weak spot in economic activity experienced in 2013 is likely to be temporary and a rebound 
of exports and economic growth is expected towards the end of the year. 
3. 
Fiscal consolidation and a slow start of public investment further deepened the 
deceleration of economic activity.  Fiscal prudence continues to enjoy broad political support 
as a cornerstone of macroeconomic stability in Mexico with fiscal policy being conducted 
within the framework of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL).  The FRL includes a balanced 
budget rule with an escape clause that allows for a budget deficit under extraordinary 
circumstances.  The latter requires the outline of a plan to return to balanced budget.  Following 
the severe contraction in 2009, a budget deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP was allowed for 2010 
with a three-year timeframe to get back to a balanced budget. In effect, fiscal support has been 
gradually withdrawn with budget deficits of 0.6 and 0.3 percent in 2011 and 2012, respectively, 
and an initial target for 2013 to return to a zero budget deficit.  The impact of this consolidation 
effort on aggregate demand was intensified by a slow start of public investment at the beginning 
of the new administration, bringing public sector capital expenditures down by almost 7 percent 
in real terms during the first half of 2013.  In the meantime, the government revised fiscal 
consolidation plans as it intends to maintain the planned level of expenditure despite lower-
than-expected revenue, thereby allowing for a budget deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP this year. 
4. 
Moderation of inflation and inflation expectations allowed the monetary 
authorities to lower short-term interest rates in support of economic activity.  Despite 
several supply shocks that temporarily raised headline inflation earlier this year, overall 
consumer price inflation and, in particular, core inflation moderately trended down to the 
medium-term inflation target of 3 percent.  The success in moderating longer term inflation and 
inflation expectation as well as, more recently, the widening of the output gap led the monetary 
authorities to reduce the monetary policy interest rate to an all-time low of 3.75 percent, through 
reductions by 50 and 25 basis points each last March and September, respectively.  The recent 

95 

 
policy move confirms the view of the monetary authorities that secondary round effects of 
supply shocks as well as the pass-through of exchange rate depreciation on inflation and 
inflation expectations have greatly diminished. 
5. 
Mexico experienced a surge in capital flows that has been largely reflected in an 
easing of financing conditions.  Net private capital inflows totaled more than US$180 billion 
over the three year period between 2010 and 2012, equivalent to an annual average of about 6 
percent of GDP.  A mayor part of these flows, US$100 billion between 2010 and 2012, has been 
invested in domestic currency denominated government debt creating a downward pressure on 
longer term interest rates as well as an appreciation of the currency.  The surge of capital flows 
over the past few years did not lead to a corresponding increase in the balance of payments 
current account deficit.  While the economy’s external deficit did show a gradual increase to 1.2 
percent of GDP by 2012 as a result of the economic recovery, significant capital inflows mainly 
led to a substantial accumulation of external assets by Mexican public and private economic 
agents, including through direct investment of Mexican companies abroad as well as the build-
up of international reserves.  
Economic growth will recover following strengthening of external demand and 
6. 
the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies in support of economic activity.  
Following the cyclical downturn created by softness in external demand and the subsequent 
weakening of domestic private consumption and investment demand, economic activity is 
expected to rebound led by strengthening of external demand as the global economy, and in 
particular the U.S., emerges from the soft patch observed in 2013.  Domestic demand will be 
strengthened through supportive monetary and fiscal policies, as monetary authorities lowered 
short-term interest rates and the government announced its plans for additional spending next 
year.  Economic growth is projected at a level slightly above potential output growth over the 
next couple of years, as the output gap generated by the shallow recession in 2013 will be 
closed gradually.    
7. 
Next year’s budget includes countercyclical fiscal stimulus mitigating the impact 
on aggregate demand of the revenue-enhancing tax reform.  In addition to a budget deficit 
of 0.4 percent of GDP to be incurred in 2013 (in terms of the FRL), the proposed budget for 
2014 anticipates a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP to provide for a stimulus of economic 
activity following the widening of the output gap during 2013.  Fiscal stimulus is projected to 
be withdrawn gradually with a budget deficit of 1.0 and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016, 
respectively, and a return to a balanced budget by 2017.  In terms of the broader Public Sector 
Borrowing Requirements, the fiscal deficit increases to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2014 and 
gradually diminishes to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017.   
8. 
Exit from unprecedented monetary policies by advanced economies over the next 
few years may lead to reversals in gross capital flows giving rise to higher domestic 
interest rates and a weaker currency.  Emerging markets, including Mexico, observed a surge 
in gross capital flows over the past few years, partly attributed to unprecedented monetary 
policies and low interest rates in major advanced economies.  With growth in advanced 
economies accelerating, prospects of a gradual exit from monetary policy support are drawing 
closer possibly leading to investors’ portfolio adjustments and a moderation or temporary 
reversal in gross capital flows to emerging markets.  The surge in gross capital inflows to 
Mexico has been mainly absorbed by offsetting public and private capital outflows rather than a 
significant deterioration of the current account.  Such a financial adjustment tends to buffer the 
economic impact of volatile capital flows and moderates the required adjustment in real 

96 

 
economic activity in case of a sudden capital flow reversal.  Financial adjustment to capital flow 
volatility mainly operates through domestic interest rates and the exchange rate creating 
incentives for offsetting capital flows, diminishing variations in net capital flows.  Expectations 
about an exit from unprecedented monetary policies by central banks from advanced economies 
already led to a sharp steepening of the yield curve and a significant depreciation of the 
currency over the past few months and financial markets, in the case of Mexico, were able to 
cope without mayor liquidity pressures or the need for public intervention.  Further sharp 
swings in capital flows can be expected as investors react to withdrawal of monetary support in 
advanced economies over the next few years. 
9. 
International reserves and an IMF Flexible Credit Line (FCL) enhance 
credibility of the policy framework providing economic resilience to volatile capital flows.  
While the major part of stabilizing financial adjustment to sudden shift in gross capital flows 
should come from the buffering behavior of private agents to changes in domestic interest rates 
and the exchange rate, international reserves and access to additional resources under the FCL 
provide the means for complementing public sector contribution to financial adjustment in case 
of extraordinary market conditions.  International reserves have been accumulated over the past 
few years as all public sector foreign exchange transactions are channeled outside of the market 
through the central bank.  The public sector has been a net recipient of foreign exchange, mainly 
due to net oil sector revenue, and international reserves at US$172 billion are up by US$80 
billion compared to the end of 2009 (previous to the recent surge in capital flows) and by 
US$10 billion over the last twelve months.  Mexico renewed its FCL with the IMF in 
November 2012 for a two-year period to an amount of approximately US$73 billion, providing 
additional assurance to investors on the adequacy of the economic policy framework.

ANNEX 4.  COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC: OVERVIEW MEXICO POLICY NOTES 

MEXICO REFORM AGENDA FOR  
INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 
1. 
This Annex presents an overview of Mexico’s forthcoming reform agenda from the 
World Bank’s vantage point (World Bank 2012). It distills the main messages in the policy 
notes that make up this compendium. The purpose is not to provide definitive answers to the 
many policy questions likely to occupy the new Mexican administration, or to provide a 
comprehensive account of progress to date and policy recommendations. Instead, it is to provide 
a view of the main challenges facing Mexico in its quest for inclusive and sustainable growth —
and to propose feasible policy options to address them. 36 Because implementing them will 
prove a daunting task for any government, prioritization is critical. The analysis in these notes 
attempts to structure policy priorities with a proposed sequencing (short-term policy options, or 
quick gains in the first year; and medium-term reform options, which may take longer to bear 
fruit). 
Overview 
2. 
In its quest for inclusive growth Mexico needs to address four main challenges. 
These key challenges are to: (a) increase productivity; (b) ensure that poorer segments of 
society benefit from and are able to contribute to the growth process; (c) combine the economic 
and environmental aspects of sustainable development; and (d) strengthen public finances and 
improve government efficiency. Achieving these objectives involves technical work and the 
political challenge of addressing entrenched interests in the public and private sectors.  
3. 
Productivity is central to accelerating growth. Despite progress on macroeconomic 
and financial stabilization, growth in Mexico has failed to converge with high-income 
economies. A reform agenda focused on unleashing productivity could place Mexico on a path 
to higher long-term growth. Such agenda includes deepening and broadening the financial 
system, promoting market competition and removing regulatory barriers for doing business, 
liberalizing key input sectors such as telecommunications and energy, reducing labor market 
rigidities, developing a workforce with skills for the 21st century, and boosting innovation.    
4. 
Growth can only be sustained with equity. Reducing poverty and inequality should 
be at the center of the reform agenda. Mexico has made great progress on reforming social 
policies with its flagship social programs that have achieved universal health insurance 
coverage 
(Seguro Popular) and have strengthened social protection 
for 
the poor 
(Oportunidades). Over the last decade, the country has also witnessed the rise of an emerging 
middle class. Yet, Mexico still faces high levels of poverty and inequality that are also a drag on 
economic growth. The reform agenda needs to focus on second-generation social policy reforms 
to develop the skills and the mobility of the workforce, strengthen the performance of existing 
social protection programs, broaden the coverage of the social protection system to include the 
elderly and those affected by shocks such as natural disasters and economic crises, and reduce 
the middle class’s vulnerability to poverty. 
5. 
A growth strategy that is accompanied by a deterioration of the environment is 
likely to be self-defeating.  The reform agenda should also promote green growth — growth 
that is efficient, clean, environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive.  Mexico, a global 
leader on climate policy, has a long and distinguished record on promoting environmental 
sustainability and managing climate change. But the country’s vulnerability to climate change 

99 

 
continues to have negative impacts on some segments of the population and environmental 
degradation poses challenges to the sustainability of growth. As Mexico continues to 
industrialize, the incidence of pollution and the societal pressures to use water, energy, and 
forests will rise. This calls for a green growth reform agenda that reduces the environmental 
footprint of growth and optimally manages natural assets. 
6. 
Sound public finances and a more efficient government are critical for inclusive 
and green growth. Mexico is a model of prudent fiscal management and a global pioneer on 
public debt and fiscal risk management. Fiscal policy, through tax measures and expenditure 
programs, has a central role to play in promoting productivity, reducing poverty and inequality, 
and promoting green growth. Yet, the ability of fiscal policy to deliver on these goals is 
constrained by several factors. Non-oil tax collection rates are low — reflecting a narrow tax 
base, a complex tax system, low citizen’s trust in the state, and weak tax administration capacity 
of subnational governments that are highly reliant on Federal Government transfers. Mounting 
medium-term expenditure pressures compound these challenges as oil revenue declines and age-
related public spending rises. This calls for an integrated fiscal and public sector modernization 
reform agenda that raises non-oil tax revenue, improves the transparency and quality of public 
spending, and strengthens subnational fiscal management. 
Unleashing productivity 
7. 
Mexico has achieved remarkable economic and social progress over the past 
several decades. The country has become an investment grade borrower with solid global 
standing in capital markets. It is a model of financial and commercial integration and of prudent 
macroeconomic management. It is also a pioneer of innovative public programs that have been 
replicated around the globe (in areas as diverse as fiscal risk management, social assistance, and 
climate change). Globalization, urbanization, and democratization have given rise to an 
emerging middle class that demands a modern and responsive state — a state that not only 
ensures macroeconomic stability but also provides opportunities for all.  
8. 
Like many other countries in Latin America, however, Mexico faces challenges in 
its quest for inclusive growth. It is a country of contrasts — rich and poor states, dynamic 
urban centers and isolated rural areas, small informal enterprises serving the domestic market 
and large companies competing abroad, top executives graduated from top universities abroad 
and youth who neither work nor study.  
9. 
Unlike some major emerging market economies, Mexico has failed to catch up 
with high-income economies. It enjoyed macroeconomic and financial stability, market-
oriented economic policy reforms, openness to foreign trade and investment, and a 
“demographic bonus,” with a rising share of the working-age population over the past decades. 
But Mexico has not unleashed high growth rates, failing to close the gap with high-income 
economies. Over the past decade the Mexican economy grew at less than 2 percent a year, well 
below the regional average (4 percent).  Its per capita income has remained at about 30 percent 
of that of the United States. 37  By contrast, East Asia’s per capita income, which tripled over the 
past three decades, is currently at about 60 percent of that of the United States (Figure 1).

Mexico’s trailing productivity partially explains its slow income convergence.  
The country’s growth has largely been driven by capital and labor accumulation, not by growth 
in labor productivity (average output per worker) or total factor productivity (combined 
efficiency of labor and capital). While physical capital accumulation rates are within reasonable 
range by international standards, labor productivity and total factor productivity collapsed 
during the eighties and have remained low since then. This explains the limited contribution of 
productivity to Mexico’s economic growth over the last fifteen years. Total factor productivity 
is interpreted in the economic literature as a measure of technological progress and explains a 
substantial share of the per capita income differences across countries (Bosworth and Collins 
2013: 113-79).

11. 
The economic literature offers several explanations for Mexico’s low productivity 
growth. An underdeveloped financial system, labor market rigidities, high informality, scarce 
skilled labor, regulatory barriers for doing business, and weak innovation and limited market 
competition are often cited as binding constraints to productivity growth (Hanson 2010). It has 
proven hard to establish empirically the relative importance of each of these obstacles to 
productivity growth. In the absence of rigorous empirical evidence of the most binding 
constraint to growth, this note argues that making progress on several of these obstacles may be 
a reasonable strategy to accelerate growth, particularly in view of the possible interactions 
between some of these constraints. The next sections discuss these challenges in greater detail.

Deepening and broadening the financial sector 
12. 
Thanks to the financial sector reforms implemented over the last decade, Mexico 
has a sound banking system and a diversified set of financial intermediaries. Financial 
sector oversight has been revamped and assessments of compliance with international 
supervisory standards note the high quality of the current financial regulatory and supervisory 
framework, especially for the banking sector. Authorities have been pro-active in adopting 
measures 
to protect financial sector stability from external shocks and endogenous 
developments; and following lessons from the recent global financial crisis, Mexico was among 
the first countries in the world in creating a formal body in charge of systemic risk monitoring. 
Also, in recent years there have been substantial efforts to improve financial inclusion through 
the operation of banking correspondent agents, propitiating the use of new technologies (such as 
mobile phones) for financial transactions, improving financial infrastructure (i.e., collateral 
registries and credit bureaus), and using public institutions and resources to catalyze private 
sector funding toward small and medium-size enterprises  as opposed to crowding private sector 
activity (i.e., through the creation of an electronic factoring platform and public credit 
guarantees schemes).  
13. 
Yet, Mexico’s financial sector remains small for its stage of development, 
impeding the channeling of financial savings into long-term productive investments. The 
market for government debt is deep and liquid, but there are few issuers in the private bond and 
corporate equity markets. The financial system has done a fair job of mobilizing savings in 
recent years but continues to lag in risk taking and maturities, limiting its contribution to 
growth. Commercial bank lending focuses on consumer credit, which has higher intermediation 
margins. Institutional investors, including pension funds and mutual funds, hold many of their 
assets in fixed-income securities, mostly government bonds.  Deepening and broadening 
Mexico’s financial system could support the growth and investment of credit constrained 
SME’s and households, raise productivity, and spur growth. Improving creditor rights and 
insolvency procedures could also enhance firms’ access to credit. Continued efforts are required 
to foster financial sector development and inclusion while maintaining the soundness of the 
financial system (refer to Mexico Policy Note 1).

Promoting competition and streamlining business regulations 
14. 
Strengthening competition and reducing the costs of doing businesses are key to 
boost productivity.  The availability, quality, and cost of inputs in the production process, such 
as capital, labor and intermediate goods and services, as well as the cost to operate a business 
are critical for firm productivity.  In international benchmark exercises, including the World 
Bank’s annual Doing Business exercise, Mexico at times stands out for the high cost and/or low 
availability for key inputs in the production process (refer to Mexico Policy Note 2). High 
concentration in key sectors of the economy and restrictive regulation hinder competition and 
aggregate productivity growth. Monopolistic behavior results in higher prices, inefficient 
resource allocation, consumer deadweight loss, and disincentives to innovate or invest.  
Similarly, regulatory burden for firms can also increase the costs of doing business. National 
and subnational regulations, such as those related to the cost of enforcing contracts and the time 
needed to obtain licenses and permits, restrict the ability of firms to do business, while 
monopolistic behavior 
reinforces 
inequalities by hurting 
low-income households 
disproportionally (refer to Mexico Policy Note 2).  
15. 
In recent years, Mexico has made progress in supporting a more competitive 
business environment and streamlining of business regulations.  Amendments to the Federal 
Competition Law have been adopted that strengthen the power of the Federal Competition 
Agency to investigate non-competitive market behavior as well as to impose more significant 
monetary and criminal sanctions to deter economic agents from such practices.  With regards to 
the streamlining of business regulations, progress has been made in facilitating tax filing and 
payment procedures, the elimination of redundant testing and certification requirements by 
recognizing the equivalence of Mexican product standards and certifications with international 
ones and the development of a Single Trade Window that will allow enterprises to comply with 
all trade related regulations through a single electronic platform.   
But more needs to be done to remove barriers to competition and reduce the costs 
16. 
of doing business.  Reforms to promote market competition could focus on ensuring an 
effective implementation of the Federal Competition Law; and creating a high-level 
commission with the mandate of recommending the elimination of anticompetitive practices at 
the subnational level. The cost of doing business could be substantially reduced with reforms 
aimed to simplify firm registration procedures, reduce the cost of formal hiring and firing 
processes and ensure effective and prompt contract enforcement.

Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report). 

17. 
As a network industry, telecommunications is critical for promoting firm 
productivity.  The telecommunications sector is undergoing radical technological and 
regulatory changes throughout the world.  In Mexico, the overwhelming dominance of the 
incumbent in the sector has caused improvements to be far smaller than those observed 
elsewhere.  Penetration of telecommunication services in Mexico still shows a lower level and 
slower growth compared to OECD countries or Latin American peers.  In 2010, the penetration 
rates (number of subscribers per 100 inhabitants) for fixed telephony, mobile telephony, and 
broadband services in Mexico were 18, 78, and 10, respectively, compared to 36, 114, and 25 in 
OECD countries, and 21, 106, and 10.3 in Chile.  This is partly attributed to higher prices and 
low-network coverage in rural areas. Using the OECD methodology of representative baskets 
on consumption, prices for moderate use of mobile phone services exceed the OECD average 
by around 30 percent and fixed-line prices for moderate-use consumer and business services 
exceed OECD averages by 67 and 82 percent, respectively, in PPP terms (OECD 2011). 
18. 
Recent reforms sought to 
improve 
investment and competition 
in the 
telecommunications sector. But a more ambitious reform is required to boost productivity.  
Examples of recent reforms include auctions for the lease of part of the optic fiber network 
owned by the state-owned Federal Electricity Commission for data transmission and for the use 
of radio spectrum for mobile telephony, as well as a program to support the reduction of 
interconnection rates for mobile telephony termination.  Additional regulatory interventions are 
needed to facilitate entry in the telecommunications sector.  Eliminating restrictions to foreign 
ownership and developing an integral and transparent interconnection policy are key elements 
of the reform agenda.  In the event that such measures fail to increase competition, sector 
regulators could be given the power to break up companies with monopolistic power whenever 
they abuse their dominant position in the market. While such powers are difficult to implement 
in practice, the mere threat of being able to do so could induce more competitive behavior. 
19. 
Opening the energy sector to private participation in core activities could also 
contribute to productivity growth.  Dominating Mexico’s energy sector, state-owned 
companies, as a result of being insulated from meaningful competition, have been slow to adapt 
and innovate in response to changing market conditions, technologies, and management

practices.  The operation of state-owned electricity companies is constrained by federal budget 
controls and ceilings that have led to insufficient investment, and political interference in 
pricing policies and investment priorities. These constraints hamper longer-term prospects for 
oil and gas supply and the development of downstream capacity, pipelines and storage facilities 
to meet rising domestic demand. Similarly, relatively high prices for electricity use by the 
industrial and commercial sectors (as opposed to subsidized rates for residential and agricultural 
use) as well as low quality of service delivery increase the cost of doing business.  An energy 
reform promoting greater efficiency and a diversification of financing sources for investment 
will enable a more dynamic energy sector and a more adequate provision of a key production 
input that could raise firm productivity. The energy reform goes hand and hand with fiscal and 
green growth policy reforms. The discussion of the fiscal dependence on oil revenues, energy 
pricing and subsidies, the promotion of energy efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions are discussed in more detail in this compendium (Refer to Mexico Policy Notes 6, 7, 
and 10).   
Reducing labor market rigidities 
20. 
Labor market rigidities constrain the efficient allocation of labor across firms 
and industries. Rigid labor market regulations prevent the Mexican labor from working 
efficiently.  The cost of employing formal sector workers remains high because of fairly rigid 
labor market regulations, particularly regarding dismissal (Figure 4). Furthermore, severance 
pay regulations likely reduce companies’ willingness to adopt new productivity enhancing 
technologies, for fear of threat to job security. While informality is partly a reflection of 
Mexico’s stage of development and of labor market rigidities, the large number of informal 
firms reinforces low productivity levels. Lower wages in the informal sector reflect a 
productivity gap, resulting from credit and technology constraints, limited access to employee 
training, and a bias against growth in order to continue to hide their activities. Addressing 
regulatory hurdles in hiring and firing workers, reducing formalization costs and, strengthening 
unemployment insurance could improve labor market efficiency and enhance productivity (refer 
to Mexico Policy Note 4).

Promoting innovation 
21. 
Boosting innovation in Mexico is critical for growth and productivity. Empirical 
evidence suggests that sustained productivity growth is contingent upon increasing knowledge 

105 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation and absorption. 38 Intermediate indicators for innovation, such as investments in 
research and development (R&D), technology licensing, and patenting, suggest that Mexico 
faces an innovation shortfall. Investments in R&D remain low relative to countries with a 
similar GDP per capita: 0.4 percent of GDP in 2009, well below other emerging markets such as 
Brazil and China and even farther below such top innovators as the Republic of Korea and 
Sweden (Figure 5). Furthermore, Mexico has yet to fully exploit the opportunities that its 
proximity to the United States offers for technological progress and productivity. Despite the 
long history of computer assembly in Mexico for U.S. companies, there is little indigenous 
patenting or evidence of new startups or spillovers, as in Korea. The quality of scientific 
institutions and collaboration between universities and firms also remains below a number of 
comparator countries (refer to Mexico Policy Note 3).

22. 
The reform agenda to boost innovation seeks to raise public R&D, improve the 
quality of scientific institutions, and strengthen links between universities and businesses.  
Policy reforms to promote innovation started with the enactment of the Law on Science and 
Technology in 2002. These reforms were followed by programs that sought to encourage 
technology transfer and R&D by private firms. In 2009, subsequent amendments to the Science 
and Technology Law expanded its scope to incorporate business innovation as a key policy 
objective; and to remove regulatory constraints to technology transfer. Going forward, the 
challenge is to strengthen the capacity of public research centers for technology transfer 
activities to take root. Sectoral programs to encourage applied research have been put in place 
as well as increased investment in human capital to improve the quality of scientific institutions. 
Further resources need to be devoted to increase R&D funding, improve the quality of R&D 
programs and develop monitoring and evaluation tools to assess their impact.   
Developing worker skills and facilitating job matching 
23. 
Mexico has achieved near universal primary school completion, but it lags its 
Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) and OECD peers in higher education enrollment. 
While 35 percent of the Mexican labor force has completed secondary school, more than 70 
percent of OECD workers have done so (Figure 6).  Despite a 50 percent increase in tertiary 
education enrolment over the past decade, current enrollment rates of 30 percent lag behind the 
LAC average (37 percent).  Enrolment rates in vocational training programs in Mexico are half 
of those in Brazil and Colombia and only one-fifth of those in Turkey and Poland.  In addition 

106 

 
 
  
to improving the coverage of education and training programs, Mexico needs to strengthen the 
quality of education.  
24. 
Mexico’s performance on international cognitive skill tests has improved over 
recent years. But, it lags behind OECD peers; and the quality of the skills development system 
remains low. Over the past decade, the performance of Mexican students on the PISA 
international learning test (measuring largely cognitive skills) has improved. But Mexico still 
lags behind its peers.  Among the 14 countries, with a similar GDP per capita as Mexico, that 
applied the PISA test, Mexico ranks 10th in reading and 11th in math and science tests (Figure 
6). Going forward, Mexico needs to improve its skills development system, both in schools and 
training institutions, to provide workers with the broad set of skills required to innovate and 
compete globally.

25. 

Mexican firms report skill mismatch in cognitive, technical, and social-emotional 
skills as a constraint to labor demand and firm expansion. Socio-emotional skills have 
increasingly been promoted, as reflected in the recent Upper Secondary School Reform. But 
they are not sufficiently valued and taught by the skills development system. Roughly one-third 
of firms consider inadequate worker skills an obstacle to firm expansion, and more than two-
fifths struggle to fill vacancies for low-skilled jobs (compared with 31 percent on average in 
other countries). While employers continue to demand cognitive (numeracy, literacy, problem-
solving) and technical skills, a recent survey found that 40 percent of Mexican firms identified 
socio-emotional skills (such as communications, customer relations, teamwork) as the most 
difficult skill set to find (refer to Mexico Policy Note 4).     
26. 
Productivity is also constrained by inefficient matching of workers and firms.  
More than half of Mexican workers find their jobs through family, friends, and other personal 
contacts.  This informal matching mechanism likely results in the misallocation of skills and 
lowers productivity. Public spending on job intermediation services is lower in Mexico than in 
other OECD countries. The absence of unemployment support may be responsible for quick 
rather than efficient job matches. Reform options for addressing these challenges include a 
national strategy for building labor market–relevant skills; continued reorientation of upper-
secondary school toward the labor market; portability of skills across the education, training, 
and labor market systems; and facilitating job search and matching by developing integral 
employment services, including unemployment insurance (refer to Mexico Policy Note 4).  

107 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Reducing poverty and inequality 

27. 
Low productivity growth is linked to high levels of poverty and inequality.  
Inequity of opportunity in access to key economic and social services (such as education, credit, 
and infrastructure) prevents a large segment of the Mexican population from fully realizing their 
economic potential. This reduces productivity and slows growth, and perpetuates existing 
poverty and high-income inequality. Breaking this vicious circle is difficult and requires an 
integrated reform agenda focused on economic and social objectives that are mutually 
reinforcing (Bourguignon and Dessus 2009: 45-69). 
28. 
Poverty in Mexico remains high and increased in recent years.  Between 2006 and 
2010, the moderate poverty rate increased from 42.7 percent to 51.3 (to 57.7 million people) 
and the extreme poverty rate from 13.8 percent to 19.8 (to 21.2 million people).  The increase in 
poverty, in 2008 and 2010, broke a decade-long trend of poverty reduction. In 2010, 57.7 
million people suffered from patrimony poverty, 12.2 million more than in 2006 (Figure 7). 
Until 2006 Mexico kept pace with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean in poverty 
reduction. But since 2008 the economy suffered a series of shocks — global food price crisis, 
global financial crisis, the AH1N1-flu epidemic, natural disasters, and a recent wave of drug-
related crime — that slowed economic growth.  
29. 
The recent increase in poverty was largely driven by a rise in urban moderate 
poverty. As of 2010, poverty rates are higher in rural areas (with 6 out of 10 households in rural 
areas are poor), but the largest group of people living in poverty is located in urban areas — 35 
million people in urban areas compared to 17 million people in rural areas based on multi-
dimensional poverty measures (CONEVAL, 2011).  The sharp increase in urban poverty that 
began in 2008 is at the center of the social policy and labor market reform debates. Stagnant real 
wages and higher unemployment and underemployment likely drove the increase in moderate 
urban poverty from 2008 to 2010. At the same time, safety nets in urban areas are not as well 
targeted as those in rural areas. The Temporary Employment Program (Programa de Empleo 
Temporal) focuses mainly on rural areas. It was expanded to urban areas in 2009 but could not 
prevent the increase in urban poverty. The flagship social protection program Oportunidades 
was not designed to quickly sign up transient populations that may fall into poverty when a 
crisis hits.  
30. 
Inequality and the vulnerability of the Mexican middle class have also risen. Over 
the last decade, Mexico has seen the emerging rise of the country’s middle class. 39 
However, the vulnerability of the middle class to shocks and downward economic mobility is at 
the center of economic policy debates. Following the recent global economic crisis per capita 
income growth (2008-2010) turned negative for all income deciles (by more than 2 percentage 
points). The largest income losses were for those in the top and bottom of the income 
distribution, with those in moderate poverty experiencing the smallest loss. Limited social 
security coverage (limited unemployment insurance and high out-of-pocket health spending) 
explains Mexico’s middle-class vulnerability to fall back into poverty when a crisis hits. The 
expansion of social programs, targeted at the lowest-income households, has not been 
accompanied by an increase in social security insurance for those vulnerable groups earning 
incomes above the poverty line (Torche and López-Calva 2010).

* Note: Vulnerable individuals are defined as those individuals with a per capita income of US$4-10. Middle-class individuals 
are those with a per capita income of US$10-50. Per capita income is expressed in international prices (2005 US dollars, PPP 
terms). 

31. 
Regional income disparities remain a concern. Income per capita in the richest state 
was 6.7 times that of the lowest in 1950, and 6.1 in 2000. In 2010 the state with the highest 
moderate poverty was Chiapas (78.4 percent), followed by Guerrero and Oaxaca (each at 
67.2 percent), while Nuevo Leon had the lowest (28.7 percent).  Income disparities across 
Mexican municipalities are also large. In addition, access to and quality of public service 
delivery also varies significantly across regions.  The states and municipalities with higher 
poverty rates tend to be those more prone to crime and/or natural disasters, and those where the 
population is spread in mountainous locations with limited accessibility to basic social services.   
32. 
The rise in poverty and vulnerability, underscores the urgency of a reform 
agenda focused on reducing the inequity of opportunities through inclusive growth. In 
Mexico, most of the decline in poverty over the past decade was driven by demographic factors 
(the increase in the adult population). In contrast, for Latin America the rise in labor income 
was the main contributor to poverty reduction (Figure 8). Since 2008, the labor poverty trend 
index (a leading indicator of poverty which tracks the number of individuals who cannot obtain 
the basic food basket with their labor income) has been on the rise, suggesting that poverty is 
likely to remain high. To reduce poverty and inequality, Mexico’s reform agenda needs to 
address several related challenges: (a) labor market failures that hinder the creation of more and 

109 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
better jobs; (b) the impact of natural disasters and economic crises on the poor; (c) lack of 
protective measures to reduce households’ vulnerability; and (d) regional disparities reflected in 
unequal opportunities in access and quality of basic social services.

Promoting labor markets for inclusive growth 
33. 
Mexico faces challenges as it seeks to develop a labor market that protects 
workers, creates more and better jobs for men and women, and improve their long-term 
standard of living.  A move toward labor formalization, institutionalization of universal social 
protection, and improved education and skill development for all workers could contribute to 
higher labor productivity and economic growth.    
34. 
Labor is the main source of income for most of the population, particularly for 
low-income households.  The reliance on labor income by low-income households reinforces 
the importance of promoting a dynamic labor market that can contribute to poverty 
reduction.  While labor income has been the main driver of poverty reduction and upward 
mobility in Latin America, it has not delivered similar results in Mexico. Between 2000 and 
2010 it only contributed 23 percent to the decline in moderate poverty in Mexico compared to 
41 percent in the region (Figure 8). Gender disparities in labor income remain, with female 
workers earning on average 20 percent less than their male peers (World Bank 2012c).  
35. 
Mexico’s large informal sector reinforces inequality.  The mobility between the 
formal and the informal labor markets provides a buffer against unemployment during 
economic downturns. But informality limits the Government’s public spending capacity and 
restricts social insurance benefits. The prevalence of informality leaves approximately half the 
workforce outside the social security system, thereby exacerbating inequities.  During the 2008 
financial crisis, only workers with access to the formal pension system were able to use early 
withdrawal from retirement accounts as a protective mechanism to smooth consumption. The 
informal workforce also generates fiscal pressures for the Government. On the one hand, it 
results in a narrow tax base. On other hand, the Government needs to fund a parallel set of non-

110 

 
 
 
contributory social programs for the informal sector. Programs seeking to protect informal 
workers can have unexpected implications since they can make informality more attractive for 
new entrants and lead to a reallocation of workers to lower productivity activities. In spite of the 
economy recovery since 2010, informality rates have remained constant with two in every three 
new entrants to the labor market being informal.  
36. 
Recent economic shocks added to existing labor market pressures. Labor supply is 
outpacing labor demand. Higher than expected population growth, a 5 percent rise in labor force 
participation rates since 2005, and a sharp reversal in migration to the United States have 
significantly increased the labor supply. Before the 2008 crisis, the Mexican economy was able 
to absorb labor supply, maintaining steady and fairly low unemployment. However, in the 
second half of 2008 and in 2009 a gap opened between labor supply and labor demand. By 2010 
employment growth once again matched labor supply, but the gap remains.   
37. 
Labor force composition has shifted toward lower-quality jobs. The share of the 
workforce in tradable sector jobs declined since 2005 but increased in non-tradable services — 
the latter characterized by low productivity. Despite the economic recovery, real wages have 
remained stagnant and even fallen; in 2010 they still remained around 90 percent of their 2008 
levels. The number of jobs paying below two minimum wages, up during the crisis, represents 
the highest share of all jobs, unlike previous years where jobs paying between two and three 
minimum wages were most common.  
38. 
The reform agenda should focus on increasing worker skills, addressing labor 
market rigidities and improving social protection. Due to the importance of labor income for 
lower-income households, social inclusion should be fostered through interventions that help 
the most vulnerable groups acquire labor market-oriented skills and access the labor market.  
More generally, the Government should aim to strengthen skills development through education 
and training services, improve employment intermediation services, address labor market 
rigidities, and promote active labor market programs. The agenda also needs to strengthen the 
social protection system, in particular unemployment insurance, for the poor and the non-poor 
vulnerable to sudden income losses in a crisis.  
Improving social protection 
39. 
Despite recent progress, social protection faces important equity and efficiency 
challenges. Mexico’s social protection system includes several contributory social security 
schemes, social assistance programs, and labor market programs. Social protection programs 
such as Oportunidades are globally recognized as quite successful. But the social protection 
system as a whole suffers from fragmented programs, weak design, and gaps in coverage (refer 
to Mexico Policy Note 5).  
40. 
The social protection system remains fragmented. In health insurance the 
different contributory schemes and the Social Protection System in Health operate in 
parallel with little coordination. Each scheme has its own funding source, insurance pool, 
administration structure, financial reserves, and service provider network — resulting in large 
inefficiencies. For labor markets, programs overlap and are duplicative. At the federal level, 63 
programs and actions promote income generation and economic well-being, many with the 
same goals and target populations (mostly indigenous and rural). 
41. 
The social protection system faces weaknesses in the design and targeting of 
programs. Mexico has gained experience in targeting social protection programs to the poor 
(Oportunidades and Seguro Popular). But some social programs (such as the energy subsidies) 

111 

 
continue to disproportionately benefit the wealthiest while absorbing a large share of resources. 
Other programs are regressive by design, such as the Employment Subsidy Program (Subsidio 
para el Empleo), which covers only formal sector workers (less than 5 percent of the subsidies 
go to the poorest household decile). 
42. 
Even the most successful programs suffer from inefficiencies.  An organizational 
and functional reform of health insurance schemes, in particular related to the separation of 
financing and provision, as well as provider payment mechanisms to allow strategic purchasing 
could strengthen performance.  Using production-based payments more would offer incentives 
for providers to decrease inefficiencies while improving quality, particularly if purchasing 
across different schemes becomes the norm. Oportunidades would benefit from reviewing those 
conditions that originally motivated the program and making appropriate adjustments, including 
the need for greater focus on promoting the employability of beneficiaries, support to those 
living in disaster-prone regions, efficiency in urban areas, and mechanisms of intervention in 
indigenous areas. 
43. 
Gaps in coverage particularly affect the poor and vulnerable and those in the 
informal sector. Employment services, which promote employability and intermediation, have 
limited coverage, while important gaps persist in urban and peri-urban areas. The pension 
system also poses challenges. Only 7 percent of those age 65 or older in the poorest decile 
receive a pension, compared with 41 percent in the richest. The recent expansion of 
noncontributory programs — such as 70 y más and Seguro Popular — address some of the 
gaps, but they remain insufficient to ensure full old-age protection. While some instruments can 
protect households in times of emergencies or crises, the Social Protection System lacks the full 
range of mechanisms to mitigate the negative impact of economic shocks.  

Promoting Green and Inclusive Growth 
44. 
While inclusive growth is central for income convergence and poverty reduction, 
the environment, and the use of the country’s natural resources must be recognized as an 
integral part of Mexico’s reform agenda.  It is widely recognized that economic growth is a 
critical driver of social and human development. But international experience has demonstrated 
that it is often accompanied by the deterioration of the local and global environment, while 
adversely impacting the poorest and most vulnerable members of society.  This highlights the 
importance of a green growth agenda that mitigates environmental damage while ensuring 
sustainable and inclusive development (Hallegatte and others, 2011). 
45. 
Green growth is defined as growth that is efficient, clean, environmentally 
sustainable, and socially inclusive.  While sustainable development is often treated as a 
longer-term objective, green growth is the short term path to this longer-term objective, with a 
focus on more immediate concerns.  The green growth approach is concerned with what needs 
to occur in the short term (over the next 5-10 years), before the world gets locked into patterns 
that would be irreversible and extremely expensive to modify, and it aims to maximize 
synergies and economic co-benefits (Hallegatte and others, 2011).  
46. 
Mexico has a long and distinguished record on many aspects of environmental 
sustainability and climate change.  The country is widely recognized as a global leader on 
climate change and is a pioneer among developing countries in climate change policy and 
negotiations.  The country’s comprehensive strategy for climate resilient, low-carbon economic 
growth is one of the most ambitious in the world.  

112 

 
47. 
Yet, the country’s vulnerability to climate change remains high, especially in the 
rural areas.  Mexico is experiencing longer and hotter periods resulting in droughts, more 
intense rains and hurricanes, frequent flooding, and mudslides. Environmental change is having, 
and will continue to have, disproportionally negative effects on poor and indigenous groups 
who depend on climate-sensitive sources of income. A World Bank study found that “Estimates 
of the macroeconomic cost of climatic natural disasters suggest that on average, each of them 
causes a 0.6 percent reduction in real GDP per capita. To the extent that, since the 1990s, such 
events have taken place on average once every three years—compared to once every four years 
in the period since 1950—their average impact on the affected countries would be a 2 percent 
reduction in GDP per capita per decade” (De la Torre and others, 2009: 4). 
48. 
As one of the largest contributors of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Latin America and 
the Caribbean, Mexico has adopted an ambitious plan to drive down GHG emissions.   
Mexico ranks 12th in the world in CO2 emissions (with 471.46 million tons CO2 emissions)40 
(Figure 10). The climate change agenda includes partnership with the states as well as the 
recently approved General Climate Change Bill (Ley General de Cambio Climático), which 
calls for a 30 percent CO2 reduction by 2020 and a 50 percent reduction by 2050 (compared 
with 2000 level).

In spite of Mexico’s commendable performance on the global and domestic 
climate agenda, local environmental pressures continue to rise. One commonly used 
aggregate indicator is the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which is a summary of 25 
different measures of environmental pressure. 41 The EPI combines air and water pollution 
estimates, resource depletion, and aspects related to policy and institutional frameworks.  As 
with any broad measure, there are problems with aggregation and interpretation, but the EPI is a 
useful starting point to assess how countries perform relative to their peers. Latin America 
scores well relative to other developing economies, and Mexico is a mid-range performer within 
the region (Figure 11).

Mexico has adopted innovative reforms to promote green and inclusive growth.  
Policy innovations such as the Green Mortgage Program (Hipoteca Verde) have unleashed 
market forces in the service of environmental efficiency.  The Green Mortgage Program offers 
loans for the installation of green equipment accessory packages (such as solar heaters, low-
energy bulbs and low water consumption toilets and faucets). Initially designed as an addition to 
the regular mortgage loan, the Green Mortgage Program has evolved and now also applies to 
remodeling, expansion, and construction activities. The program began in March 2008 and was 
modified in 2011 in an attempt to broaden the choices to select accessory packages and hence 
promote greener consumption patterns. Before 2011 the program package was fixed and 
depended on climatic zones. Currently the beneficiary can either buy a house with installed 
equipment or chose the equipment to install in the house. 
51. 
Going forward, two critical policy concerns need to be addressed to promote 
greener and more inclusive growth – tackling the environmental footprint (externalities) 
and managing natural assets under pressure.  As Mexico grows and industrializes further, so 
too will the incidence of pollution if there are no compensating policy responses. Similarly, 
demands on common property natural resources such as water and forests will continue to rise, 
enhancing the need for policy innovation and stewardship.   
52. 
Greening growth requires reducing the environmental footprint of the urban 
economy. In particular, the following pending policy issues related to land use planning, waste 
collection, urban pollution, and energy efficiency should be addressed (refer to Mexico Policy 
Note 6):  
• Urban planning. Mexico is a highly urbanized country.  Reducing the resource intensity 
of current urban development might lead to significant efficiency gains, and an 
improvement of economic activities, thus enhancing the efficiency and quality of growth. 
Urbanization also has negative externalities that impact and adversely affect quality of 
life, environmental sustainability, and exposure to natural disasters, mainly for the most 
vulnerable. Addressing these externalities (in an economically appropriate manner) 

114 

 
 
 
would yield a double dividend — efficiency and economic gains in terms of improved 
land use management and greater productivity and resilience.  
• The brown agenda. Although Mexico has developed good environmental legislation and 
protection strategies related to waste management, 42 these are not being adequately 
implemented, especially at the local level.  There are still important gaps, including an 
insufficient number of solid and hazardous waste disposal facilities; municipal sewage 
and industrial effluents polluting rivers in urban areas and costal environments; and 
serious air, water, and land pollution especially in urban centers.  Contaminated sites can 
result in significant human health impacts, often associated with poor or marginalized 
communities.  
• Energy efficiency.  Energy is one of the most important sectors in the Mexican economy. 
First, oil revenues contribute at least one-third of the federal budget, yet oil production 
and reserves have been steadily declining. Second, being state owned and financially 
constrained by the federal budget ceiling, the energy sector has been limited in terms of 
technological progress, corporate practices, and pricing policies. Third, energy 
consumption and production contribute over 60 percent of Mexico’s total GHG 
emissions. Enhancing energy efficiency would improve the country’s competitiveness 
and mitigate the fiscal burden from energy subsidies, as well. However, energy policies 
involve crucial economic, environmental, and social tradeoffs; so paying close attention 
to this issue should be a high priority going forward.  
53. 
Green growth also requires managing the use of natural resources optimally.  
Progress and challenges regarding forests, water management and the energy sector include the 
following (refer to Mexico Policy Note 7):    
• Forest and biodiversity management. While Mexico’s forests have long been valued as 
a source of timber, they are increasingly being appreciated for their role in helping to 
regulate the environment. Mexico ranks twelfth worldwide in forest cover, with 33 
percent of its area being classified as either forests or “wooded land” (FAO 2010). 
Poverty is widespread in forest communities, owing to degradation (the usual common 
property problem) as well as market failures that do not recognize the value of 
environmental services generated in forests. Hence stewardship of forests and 
biodiversity must continue to rank highly on the policy agenda.   
• Water management. Reduced water availability and poor water quality are two of the 
main factors that will affect economic growth and development in Mexico. Water 
resources in Mexico are scarce and heterogeneously distributed across the country, with 
the bulk of the water supply concentrated in the south while the population and demands 
are greatest in the more arid north of the country (Figure 12). About 63 percent of the 
supply comes from surface water sources, and 37 percent is from groundwater sources 
(CONAGUA, 2011). Despite steady improvements in water management across the 
country, there is ample evidence of the costs associated with poor water governance and 
includes diseases, rising costs of alternative sources, and the costs of the implicit 
electricity subsidy to Mexican farmers (Muñoz Piña and others, 2006). But it is the 
unsustainable extraction of groundwater that remains by far the biggest unresolved 
challenge in Mexico.

• Renewable energy. The possibility of Mexico turning into a net oil importer poses the 
challenge of radically transforming the energy matrix composition. The heavily based 
hydrocarbon structure and the declining oil production affect the configuration of the 
power sector and other industrial energy uses. Through the introduction of newer 
technologies and regulatory changes, the power sector has become the main driver of 
natural gas demand in Mexico. Diversification through the expanded use of renewable 
energy sources is a key element to strengthening the long-term sustainability of the 
Mexican economy. 
54. 
Finally, a comprehensive system for tracking and monitoring progress and 
environmental pressures needs to be developed.  Mexico’s leadership and early efforts at 
developing green GDP accounts are steps in the right direction. Going forward, the remaining 
challenge is to: (a) strengthen available measures for each sector (physical and economic 
indicators of environmental progress) and (b) build on the green GDP accounts to guide 
macroeconomic and sectoral policies. 
Promoting sound public finances and efficient government 
55. 
Sound public finances and an efficient government are critical to achieve and 
sustain a green and inclusive growth agenda. A modern public administration is fundamental 
for executing public programs effectively and efficiently and for raising the resources required 
to finance these programs. An efficient and coordinated public administration with well-
articulated institutions is also required to manage medium-term fiscal pressures through policy 
choices consistent with available resources.  In some areas (such as macroeconomic policy and 
public debt management) Mexico has developed the necessary institutions and systems. In 
others, such as the management of expenditure to achieve quality results, progress has been 
made at establishing a framework, but challenges remain to improve the working of the entire 
budgetary and policy cycle. Finally, although improvements have taken place in tax 
administration in recent years, Mexico faces the challenge of developing a broad-based taxation 
system that substantially enhances public revenue to finance its development effort without 
discouraging investment and formal sector employment generation.   

116 

 
 
 
 
 
• 

Improving service delivery and the quality of expenditure management 
56. 
In recent years Mexico has undertaken a number of important initiatives to 
improve the quality of expenditure and service delivery. These include developing a new 
legal framework to increase expenditure efficiency, including a Performance Evaluation System 
(Sistema de Evaluación del Desempeño, or SED). Affecting all three levels of government, the 
framework:  
• Defines new policies on results-based management and budgeting;  
• 
Strengthens budget discipline by improving budget management across the budget 
cycle, from planning through execution to audit and evaluation;  
Introduces a financial management 
information system (Sistema Integral de 
Administración Financiera Federal, or SIDAFF), which began implementation in 
2012; and  
• Establishes a specialized function for comprehensive evaluation of selected Federal 
Government policies and programs within the Ministry of Finance (refer to Mexico 
Policy Note 9). 
57. 
All of these initiatives have yielded benefits, but require institutionalization for 
Mexico to improve public sector performance and the quality of expenditures. Budget and 
financial management covering key functions in the budget cycle, from planning to execution to 
evaluation, have traditionally focused on process compliance and input control. These functions 
and systems need further upgrading to provide public sector managers and decision-makers with 
relevant, timely, high-quality information on financial inputs and outputs and on outcomes from 
public projects and programs. This challenge requires actions on several fronts: continue to 
implement modern harmonized accounting standards and performance-informed budgeting 
policies, using information technologies more intensively for public sector management (e-
government), 
raising standards of administrative procedures and procurement, and 
strengthening the capacity of federal and subnational governments to deliver high-quality public 
goods and services in a timely fashion.  
58. 
The performance budgeting and evaluation system reform led by the Ministry of 
Finance has advanced a results- and performance-informed orientation in the federal 
budget process. To incorporate results and performance dimensions into resource allocation, 
the new system uses performance indicators for public sector programs, along with systematic 
evaluations of public sector policies and programs. Consolidating performance-based budgeting 
at the federal and state level depends on consolidating the SIDAFF and equivalent state 
financial management systems, improving the quality of the performance information, 
institutionalizing the evaluation function, and working with sector ministries to consolidate the 
performance culture, implement the new tools and processes, and expand capacities to use them. 
As experience from other countries shows, setting up a performance-informed system requires a 
culture change, with a new management style based on performance incentives; management 
delegation; and a focus on inputs, outputs, and outcomes. In addition, because results-informed 
management requires mechanisms for accounting, reporting, and consolidating information, 
accounting systems are being modernized and harmonized. 
59. 
Completing the accounting harmonization program will remain a challenge for 
the next administration. This task, not simply technical, will require strong political leadership 
to ensure that the accounting and reporting changes are implemented as the basis for effective 
resource management in the public sector. At the subnational level, supporting the country’s 
1,200 smaller and less-developed municipalities must be a priority.  

117 

 
60. 
At the subnational level, it will be important to provide support and incentives 
for implementing state-level financial management systems consistent with the accounting 
harmonization. For states and municipalities, establishing a common budget classification 
system in parallel with accounting harmonization would enhance fiscal transparency and 
support standardization across levels of government. A more transparent and consolidated 
accounting framework would improve expenditure monitoring and encourage efficiency and 
accountability. Incentive mechanisms for subnational governments that adopt an integrated 
system, and support to those that are willing to move forward first, to implement the new 
accounting standards will be important through 2013. 
61. 
Improving the efficiency of government delivery of goods and services requires 
continuing the procurement system reform initiated in 2009. Mexico’s public procurement 
system has a large impact on the country’s economy: public procurement accounts for 40 
percent of the federal budget and about 10 percent of GDP, and the estimated savings from 
effective procurement are substantial. Until recently, the procurement system was over-
regulated, focused heavily on the administrative function, and based primarily on legal 
regulations. The key challenges are to consolidate the current system and to target more areas. 
Especially important is continued emphasis on performance outcomes. Because the risk of 
waste and corruption in procurement systems is high, procurement reform and monitoring can 
yield substantial gains for the economy and society.  
Managing medium-term fiscal pressures 
62. 
Health and pension spending will rise as the population ages and experiences an 
epidemiological transition. Age-related public spending needs will materialize alongside 
demands for filling the existing gaps in the country’s social security and social protection 
system (refer to Mexico Policy Note 10).  Over the next two decades the population 65 years of 
age and older is projected to double as a share of total population (Figure 13). This demographic 
transition is expected to lead to an increase of public spending on pension and old-age income 
provisions by about one percent of GDP over this period. Similarly, health expenditure is bound 
to increase due to the country’s demographic and epidemiological transitions. Total health 
spending is likely to grow from 6 to 8 percent of GDP over the next two decades. 
Approximately half of this increase will be on account of the public sector.

63. 
Mexico’s public finance depends heavily on oil revenue, but recent high prices 
mask an alarming decline in oil production.  Crude oil production has declined by 25 percent 

118 

 
 
 
following a peak in 2004.  Estimates of oil reserves and production are surrounded by a large 
margin of uncertainty, though even if production were to stabilize at the current level of 2,500 
thousand barrels per day, a growing economy would result in a fall of oil revenue as a percent 
of GDP. Over the next two decades such a stabilization of oil production could represent a 
reduction of oil revenue as a percent of GDP by 3 percentage points. 
64. 
Declining oil revenue, increasing medium-term health and pension spending, as 
well as other public sector spending requirements call for a strengthening of tax collection.   
Federal tax collection in Mexico (13.8 percent) is below the OECD average (19.2 percent). 
When local taxes and social security contributions are included, Mexico drops to last place 
among OECD countries (Figure 14).  Though the general features and statutory rates of the 
Mexican tax system compare favorably internationally, tax collection efficiency remains 
substantially below peers.

65. 
A large informal economy narrows the tax base, and numerous tax loopholes and 
exemptions hinder tax collection and ease tax evasion. The Mexican tax collection agency, 
Servicio de Administración Tributaria, estimates that about 77 percent of income tax due on 
non-salary income is not paid, and that value-added tax evasion is 35 percent. Preferential 
corporate and individual tax regimes, value-added tax exceptions, and multiple rates complicate 
the tax system and facilitate noncompliance. Exemptions, deductions, and multiple rates 
generate substantial revenue losses, have the same effect on the budget as does government 
spending (like subsidies), and alter the horizontal and vertical equity of the tax system.  
Adopting an integrated fiscal reform that simplifies the tax system, reforms 
66. 
energy subsidies, and broadens the tax base could meaningfully bolster revenue. Reducing 
or withdrawing tax expenditures would broaden the tax base and strengthen revenues. Forgone 
tax revenues due to these expenditures are large and mainly regressive. Similarly, reducing 
public subsidies, especially prevalent in the energy sector, would likely enhance public revenue 
as well. Energy subsidies, highly regressive in Mexico, mask resource costs. Withdrawing them 
would raise revenues, avoid distorted price signals, and help Mexico reach its climate change 
mitigation goals. 
67. 
The fiscal reform should also aim at improving equity. The Gini coefficient in 
Mexico has remained virtually the same before and after taxes, in contrast with European Union 

119 

 
 
 
120 

countries, where taxes and public transfers substantially lower-income inequality (Figure 15). 
This is partly the result of a low share of progressive income taxes in overall tax revenues. The 
fiscal reform should include a careful evaluation of its distributional impact. But the 
distributional incidence of the individual fiscal measures should be less of a concern than the 
overall distributional incidence of the tax-benefit package. Energy subsidies, VAT exemptions 
and zero rating are in effect non-targeted consumption subsidies. The amount of the subsidy 
obtained depends on household spending on the subsidized products, which tends to rise with 
income. The loss in purchasing power for lower-income households generated from broadening 
the tax base and the removal of energy subsidies would need to be evaluated in parallel to an 
increase in targeted social spending programs. Eliminating subsidies and preferential tax 
regimes, along with a compensation mechanism for lower-income households, could lead to a 
net benefit in the income redistribution function of the tax-benefit system. A fiscal reform that 
focuses on improving the redistributive impact of taxes and public transfers could improve 
citizen trust in the state, currently lower than in other Latin American countries, reflecting 
taxpayer disappointment with public service delivery (Figure 16).

America and the Caribbean

Improving subnational public finances  
68. 
The high centralization of Mexico’s tax system has reduced the incentives of 
subnational governments to collect taxes. A number of subnational governments suffer from 
limited administrative capacity to fulfill key tax administration functions, while the dependence 
on federal transfers remains high (90 percent of subnational public revenue). These vertical 
imbalances, combined with the rise in discretionary federal transfers, have reduced states 
incentives to raise their own revenue. Property tax, for example, is an important source of public 
revenue for subnational governments in OECD countries, but in Mexico amounts to only 0.2 
percent of GDP. Meanwhile, rapidly growing subnational expenditures now constitute more 
than half of total subnational public expenditures.  
69. 
Dependence on federal transfers increases the volatility of subnational public 
finances during periods of economic instability and puts pressure on state public debt 
(Figure 17). The lack of fiscal discipline has led to unsustainable fiscal positions in some states. 
This calls for fiscal consolidation programs that combine financing (conditional on fiscal and 
service delivery targets) with technical assistance to mobilize state revenues and improve

The reform agenda summarized in this overview, and described in more detail in the 
compendium of policy notes, is challenging but feasible. It proposes an integrated reform 
agenda that seeks to promote productivity, reduce poverty and inequality, promote green 
growth, and strengthen public finances and government efficiency.  Mexico has a unique 
opportunity in the next sexenio to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. But it will require 
setting priorities and sharing responsibilities between the elected government and its citizens.

ANNEX 5. POVERTY AND SHARED PROSPERITY TRENDS: THE CHALLENGE OF 
MEASURING THE GOALS OF DEVELOPMENT 

1. 
Poverty is typically understood in absolute terms, defined in reference to a poverty line 
that reflects the purchasing power sufficient to cover essential needs.  There is a broad-based 
consensus that reducing absolute poverty is a worthy development goal. Along economic 
growth, poverty reduction is understood as an important development goal in itself, while 
whether income inequality is an important goal in its own right has been debated for decades. In 
turn, this reflects at least two underlying and related debates. In particular, how inequality 
evolves over time and the impact of inequality on growth. 
2. 
As the impact of income inequality on economic growth, or vice versa, remains 
unresolved, recent policy discussions have tended to focus more on ensuring equality of 
opportunities alongside protecting people from absolute deprivation, rather than on income 
inequality alone.  This recent emphasis draws from the work of a number of thinkers, including 
Amartya Sen, whose “capability approach”, first conceptualized in the 1980s, has argued — in 
brief and at the risk of oversimplification — for focusing on and equalizing the “capability set” 
or the set of possible “functionings”, that is, the set of activities that an individual can choose to 
engage in using resources at his or her command. Defined as such, “well-being” is understood 
more broadly, and the focus is on protecting individuals from absolute deprivation and 
removing disadvantages that are beyond any individual’s control. Real income remains 
essential, but having the freedom to make substantive choices also requires good health and 
education. Following this approach, public policy focuses on ensuring a fair(er) distribution of 
assets, economic opportunities, and political representation.  
3. 
The multi-dimensional aspect of this understanding of development has warranted a 
more complex approach to the measurement of well-being and progress. There are numerous 
alternatives, ranging from the formulation of composite indexes — such as the Human 
Development Index, which Sen himself helped formulate — to the monitoring of multiple 
development goals, as in the Millennium Development Goals. 
Mexico: pioneer of poverty measurement 

4. 
Mexico became the first country in Latin America to adopt a Multi-dimensional 
Poverty Index as its official poverty measure.  The law on social development (Ley General de 
Desarollo Social or LGDS) published in January 2004, had the key objective of ensuring access 
to social development and the ability to fully exercise the social rights laid out in the Mexican 
Constitution for the entire population of the country.   This law moved Mexico away from a 
purely economic measure of well-being to one firmly rooted in Sen’s ideas of functionings and 
linked explicitly to the national Constitution, which lays out a series of detailed social or human 
rights.   
5. 
The adoption of a Multi-dimensional Poverty Index represented a significant change in 
how poverty was viewed in Mexico.  Up until 2008, poverty was measured in terms of whether 
a person’s per capita income placed him or her below three poverty thresholds. The lowest or 
most extreme poverty line was “food poverty”, set at the value needed to buy a basic basket of 
food items.  According to CONEVAL, food poverty refers to those people who do not have the 
purchasing power to acquire a basic food basket. As of March 2012 the monthly food poverty 

124 

 
 
line was equivalent to Mex$1,253.41 in urban areas and Mex$865.58 in rural areas.  The 
second, somewhat higher poverty line is that of “capabilities poverty”, which corresponds to the 
value of income necessary to cover the basic food basket plus basic health and education.  The 
highest line, “patrimonio or asset”, included additional allowances for housing and 
transportation.  
6. 
Today Mexico measures poverty through an explicit combination of economic well-
being (income) and the social rights of the population.  In addition to per capita income, article 
36 of the LGDS spells out the social rights whose lack would place a person in a condition of 
poverty; and rights related to education, health, social security, housing, related utilities and 
infrastructure, food security, and social cohesion. Importantly, these are all social development 
rights that are outlined in the Mexican Constitution although the level of detail of each of these 
rights in the Constitution varies: education was quite explicit while the right to housing refers to 
a vaguer right to “dignified and decent” housing and food security was only guaranteed for 
children.   
7. 
Operationalizing the social rights into indicators that could be measured and monitored 
and establishing a threshold was a substantial undertaking that drew in a wide spectrum of 
government and civil society. The extensive process was led by the National Council on 
Evaluation (CONEVAL) in partnership with line ministries, other agencies of government, and 
academia. Critical decisions had to be made not just on the indicators to include, but the levels 
below which a person should be considered poor (establishing thresholds).  And most 
troublesome was the need to develop a consensus around an aggregation strategy:  whatever 
combination of multiple indicators is done implies comparative evaluations of the importance of 
each right.   
8. 
The official Multi-dimensional Poverty Index is conceived of as a two-dimensional 
indicator with economic well-being (measured by income) seen as one dimension, separate 
from the other dimension of social rights.  By this construction, per capita income is included in 
the measure as almost an independent measure while a series of six rights (or in their absence, 
deprivations) are aggregated in the second dimension. While income remained as part of the 
poverty measure, its definition has changed along with the thresholds in use. (These changes 
can be seen in Table 1).   
9. 
The implications of the move to a Multi-dimensional Poverty Index is that government 
policies that focus purely on income growth only will, in all likelihood, be insufficient for 
poverty eradication, and the poverty reducing impact of government investment in services is 
now reflected in the official poverty measure.  For persons to be considered poor in multi-
dimensional terms, they have income below the monthly well-being line (i.e., income poverty) 
and have at least one deprivation in terms of housing, infrastructure, education, health, social 
security, or food security.  An extremely poor person has income below the minimum well-
being line and suffers from three or more deprivations. Thus, income poverty alone does not 
make one poor nor can income growth alone move one out of poverty.

10. 
The Multi-dimensional Poverty Index also calls attention to the vulnerable population.  
Anyone who has adequate income but suffers three or more deprivations is considered to be 
vulnerable in terms of social deprivations.  Those with inadequate income but having all of their 
social rights complete are considered to be vulnerable in terms of income.   In 2012 the share of 
the population in extreme poverty was 9.8 percent of the population, an additional 35.7 percent 
suffered from moderate poverty.   The total share in poverty in 2012 was 45.5 percent, a decline 
from 2010 when it was 46.1 percent but represents still an increase in 0.5 million additional 
people.

The World Bank measures of poverty and shared prosperity  

11. 
The World Bank retains a uni-dimensional measure of poverty, income, or 
consumption, but argues strongly that poverty is a multi-dimensional phenomena, as its 
thorough World Development Indicators testify.  In spite of these efforts, the World Bank is 
probably best known for the economic well-being measure of poverty — the widely used metric 
of “one-dollar-a-day” poverty line.  The origin of the line comes from work done for the 1990 
World Development Report on Poverty. The aim of this work was to measure poverty in the 
developing world using standards of the poorest countries.  A critical step for such an exercise 
was the determination of which poverty threshold to use. The line observed in cross-country 
studies caught the imagination and became the one-dollar-a-day line used often in comparative 
work across countries and the object of the first Millennium Development Goal.  The original 
work has been updated multiple times: the most recent version sets the value to $1.25; but the 
overall logic and focus is the same. 
12. 
The recent move to a concept of shared prosperity reflects, in part, the World Bank’s 
concern with broader concepts than average economic growth. Interestingly, although the terms 
appear to be similar, there has been substantial evolution of thinking about poverty at the World 
Bank.  In 1972, then president of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, stressed the need for 
governments of the developing countries “... to reorient their development policies in order to 
attack directly the personal poverty of the most deprived 40 percent of their populations.”  In 
2013, Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, called for attention to be paid to the income 
growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population.  The difference is that in the 1972 case the 
discussion focused simply on the need to eradicate absolute poverty, while the 2013 emphasis is 
on the notion of shared prosperity and the need for growth to be pro-poor and inclusive. 
Recent poverty trends  

13. 
Monetary poverty rose between 2006 and 2012, breaking a decade-long trend of 
poverty reduction in Mexico. Available data spanning two decades of monetary measures of 
poverty show that monetary poverty rates in 2012 are similar to the rates in 1992: the net 
reduction of moderate and extreme poverty was of only 0.8 and 0.7 percentage points, 
respectively, over 20 years (Figure 2). 

127

Source: CONEVAL using the traditional ENIGH 1992-2012. 
Note: Estimates 2006-2012 use the adjusted expansion factors from the 2010 Population Census. 

14. 
Between 2006 and 2012 the moderate poverty rate (asset poverty or pobreza de 
patrimonio) increased substantially from 42.9 to 52.3 (to 61.4 million people). During the same 
period, the extreme poverty rate (food poverty or pobreza alimentaria) increased from 14.0 to 
19.7 (to 23.1 million people). Poverty increased markedly between 2006 and 2008 (5 percentage 
points in moderate poverty), with smaller increases in 2008-10 and leveling-off in 2010-12. 
Extreme poverty increased significantly during the period 2006-08 (when the headcount 
increased by 4.7 percentage points) and stagnated in the years after, hovering around 19 percent. 
Until 2006, Mexico kept pace with the region in poverty reduction. Nevertheless, since 2008 the 
economy suffered a series of shocks — food price crisis, global financial crisis, the AH1N1-flu 
epidemic, natural disasters — that slowed economic growth. 
15. 
Multi-dimensional Poverty Index shows, however, that between 2010 and 2012 the 
share of the population living in poverty decreased from 46.1 to 45.5. In absolute terms, poverty 
increased: the total number of poor according to the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index increased 
by half a million people over the same period.  In contrast to monetary measures and other 
Multi-dimensional Poverty Index measures of poverty such as moderate poverty and 
vulnerability measures, only extreme poverty had an unambiguous improvement in relative and 
absolute terms. Not only did the extreme poverty rate declined from 11.3 to 9.8 percent, but also 
the number of extreme poor decreased by 1.4 million people (Table 2).

The average population with three or more social deprivations dropped from 28.2 to 
23.9 in 2012 (Table 2), and the share of population with social deprivations fell unambiguously 
in five out of the six social areas in the 2010-12 period (Table 3). The largest statistically 
significant improvement was in access to health care, where 8.2 million more people gained 
access. The only social deprivation for which the share of the population increased was access 
to social security (totaling 71.8 million without access to social security). However, the net 
increase is not statistically significant (Table 3).

Shared Prosperity in Mexico 
17. 
For the period 2010-12, Mexico’s income growth for the bottom 40 percent had an 
average annual increase of 2.3 percent while the increase in the average income growth for the 
total population was 0.6 percent. (Figure 3) The increase was not enough to compensate the 
drop that occurred between 2008 and 2010, when income growth of the bottom 40 percent 
decreased slightly more than the total population (2.39 percent versus 2.89 percent). Therefore, 

129 

 
 
 
looking at the entire period 2008-12, the average income growth of the bottom 40 percent was 
negative (but the decline was less pronounced than for the overall population). 

Annex 5 Figure 3.  Measures of Shared Prosperity 2008-2012 

Source: World Bank team calculations using data from MCS-ENIGH 2008-2012. 

18. 
Over the 2008-12 period, per capita income growth hovered around zero for almost all 
income percentiles in Mexico. Only the richest percentile suffered a decreased larger than 2 
percent. However, the incidence of growth had different natures within sub-periods. While in 
2008-10, the poorest segments were the most affected; in 2010-12 they were benefited the most 
in the recovery, which explains the drop in inequality during the last years.

These recent trends in shared prosperity are accompanied by a reduction of income 
inequality for the period 2010-2012. According to the income measure from the poverty 
indicator prior to the adoption of the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, income inequality had 
fallen since 1996. The new income variable used as part of the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index 
shows that inequality rose between 2006 and 2008 (Figure 7 combines the two series). While 
there are comparability issues between the old and the new series, the new income measure 
shows that income inequality rose between 2006 and 2010 but then dropped in 2012. However, 
the latter drop is not statistically significant. More time and data is needed to tell if the trend 
will continue. 
A large degree of regional inequality 
20. 
Differences in GDP per capita across Mexican states and regions have traditionally 
been high and fairly persistent. GDP per capita in the richest state in 1950 was 6.7 times that of 
the lowest, and in 2000 this ratio was still 6.1. According to data from CONEVAL, poverty 
levels are also far from being uniform across the country. In 2012 the state with the highest 
moderate poverty rate was Chiapas (74.7 percent), followed by Guerrero (69.7 percent), Puebla 
(64.5 percent) and Oaxaca (61.9 percent). In contrast, the states with the lowest moderate 
poverty rates in 2010 were Nuevo Leon (23.2 percent), Coahuila (27.9 percent) and Distrito 
Federal (28.9 percent).

using the MCS-ENIGH 2008. 

21. 
If looking at extreme poverty measures, national average hides important regional 
differences. Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca have extreme poverty rates of 32.2, 31.7, and 23.2 
percent, respectively. These are 10 times higher than the poverty rates of Nuevo Leon, Distrito 
Federal, and Baja California (2.4, 2.5, and 2.7, respectively). One out of 3 Mexicans in poverty 
live in Chiapas, Guerrero, or Oaxaca. 

22. 
There are also large regional discrepancies in terms of shared prosperity in Mexico. 
While the mean income of the bottom 40 percent in Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz had an 
average growth above 8 percent between 2010 and 2012, in the states of Nayarit mean income 
decreased by 8 percent (Figure 5).

Gender and ethnicity differences 
23. 
Gender-specific estimates of poverty indicate differences between women and men. 
From 2010 to 2012, the Multi-dimensional Poverty Index extreme poverty rate was equally 
reduced among men and females by 1.5 percentage points. However, in 2012, there were 1.5 
million fewer men than women living in moderate poverty. Moreover, 300,000 more women 
than men live in extreme poverty (left, Figure 6).  
24. 
Poverty among the indigenous population has fallen faster, but their poverty levels 
remain high. Extreme poverty among indigenous population decreased 7.2 percentage points, 
lifting more than 800,000 people out of poverty. Despite this progress, 8.2 million indigenous 
people still live in poverty, 3.5 million of whom are extremely poor (right, figure 6). The social 
deprivation indicator fell in each dimension among indigenous groups. In particular, they had a 
large improvement in access to healthcare for which 1.3 million gained access.

ANNEX 6. STATUS OF GENDER ISSUES IN MEXICO AND ENTRY POINTS TO THE 

CPS 

1. 
In the last decade, much progress has been made toward greater gender equality in 
Mexico. On the one hand, issues such as equal treatment, non-violence, equal law and rights, 
public expenditure, awareness of unpaid household work, and political participation have all 
been incorporated into the public agenda. On the other hand, Mexico shows improved gender 
outcomes in several areas: between 2005 and 2010 the average level of schooling went up from 
7.9 to 8.4 for women and from 8.4 to 8.7 for men, and the proportion of women in the House of 
Deputies has increased from 17.4 percent in 2000 to 36.8 percent in the current administration.  
2. 
The improved gender outcomes may be related to the significant increase in the 
allocation of public funds in the last 10 years in which the budget dedicated to gender equality 
has multiplied by 13.3. Also, the Federal Government has enacted several laws to protect 
women’s rights. 43 The process of guaranteeing the rights granted by these federal laws is 
solidified through adoption of similar laws and regulations at the state level. 
3. 
However, despite progress in promulgation of laws and increases in budgets aimed to 
enhance gender equality, major issues still need to be addressed. Challenges remain on 
education, health (i.e., access to health services and maternal mortality rates); opportunities for 
income generation (i.e., labor markets and occupational segregation, access to assets and 
financial services, use of time); poverty levels; and women agency and gender roles (i.e., 
adolescent pregnancy, gender-based violence, and political participation).   

Ending Poverty 
4. 
Overall, gender-specific estimates of poverty suggest that there are no big differences 
between women and men. Analyzing gender poverty is a complex task because incomes as well 
as inputs into multi-dimensional definitions of poverty are generally measured at the household 
level, but there are estimates that 52 percent of women live in conditions of multi-dimensional 
poverty, compared to 48 percent of men. 44  
5. 
However, estimates of time poverty show noteworthy differences with a higher 
incidence in women than in men. Women dedicate more time to unpaid activities, both in and 
outside of the household. Estimates suggest that 62.9 percent of women and 7.1 percent of men 
aged 15 to 64 live in conditions of time poverty. In rural areas 76.5 percent of women live in 
time poverty conditions, compared to 59.6 percent in urban areas. For men the numbers are 5.8 
percent and 7.6 percent respectively. 
6. 
Maternal mortality is also a persistent public health issue in Mexico; progress on this 
issue has been very slow with 60 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2002 and only down to 51 in 
2010. To improve maternal health, several measures are recommended: (a) ensure that 
necessary resources are available to send women to specialized hospitals in case of emergency 
at the local level; (b) the quality of medical attention should be improved; (c) training for 
medical personnel at a municipal level should encompass detection of risk factors; and (d) 
increased resources should be spent for prevention measures such as prenatal consultations. 
7. 
Between 2006 and 2011 the incidence of violence against women perpetrated in their 
last relationship increased from 43.2 percent to 46.1 percent. Large percentages of women (64.6 
percent of separated, divorced, or widowed women; 70.7 percent of single; and 75.1 percent of 
married or common-law wives) do not denounce physical or sexual abuse by their partner or 

137 

 
spouse. These results demonstrate that violence against women has grown in its every form, in 
spite of public action to combat it. 

Shared Prosperity  
8. 
Gender differences also persist in the labor market, which is still highly dominated by 
men. In 2010, for example, the economically active population rate for women reached 44 
percent while it was 81 percent for men. Women are more likely to work in the informal sector: 
in 2012, 31.6 percent of women and 28.4 percent of men worked in the informal sector. Also, 
the occupational segregation is another challenge for women’s position in the labor market.  
9. 
Inequality permeates Mexican society and analysis of gender differences within states 
reveals that not all the states have made equal progress toward gender equality. The level of 
violence against women is one example. Another one is that rural indigenous females have 
considerably lower average years of schooling (4.5) than the general female population (8.4), 
and the school attendance among indigenous women fluctuates between 10 and 66 percent 
depending on the state, while that of non-indigenous women is between 62 and 73  percent. 
10. 
Also, in spite of increased political participation at the federal level, the proportion of 
women in local congress is very low: up until 2012, only the State of Yucatán had a female 
governor. These inequalities are accentuated in municipal governments in that only 7.7 percent 
of all 2,285 municipalities are headed by female mayors. 

Proposed Engagement Approach 
11. 
The CPS will expand the World Bank’s ongoing analytical and operational activities 
in the area. Key efforts will be focused on assisting federal, state and municipal agencies 
responsible for gender issues to increase research and analytical work and inform well-targeted 
gender policies and investments. The proposed gender work program under the CPS FY14-19 is 
currently under active preparation and discussion within the country management and sector 
units as well as with clients and other stakeholders, and as such it has not yet been possible to 
define gender specific parameters for the CPS Results Matrix (Table 1). The definition of 
operation- and/or activity-specific gender targets and monitoring indicators will be completed as 
integral part of their respective preparation processes.  
12. 
Some potential entry points include: 
• Financial services/inclusion. Disaggregate the number of people with bank accounts 
by sex and propose ways to enhance women’s agency in terms of financial literacy, 
access to services. 
• Labor force participation and formal sector inclusion. Include a gender dimension in 
the labor force discussion since fewer women than men are economically active (44 
and 81 percent, respectively), and there is persistent occupational segregation and 
gender wage gaps. Programmatic actions could include analysis to detect gender-
specific needs and demands for labor market policies that improve the skills level, 
formality, and allocative efficiency of the labor force, including the National 
Employment System. 
• Education. There are acute differences in education levels of indigenous and non-
indigenous women; indigenous women, age 15 and over, have an average of 4.5 years 
of schooling, compared to 8.7 years among non-indigenous women. The PEC could 
provide a channel to work on this. 

138 

 
• Gender-based violence. This might be something to look into further, particularly as it 
is a key Government priority in the Mexico NDP, and it relates to a nationwide 
monitoring system. 
• Oportunidades. In the work the Bank will support there is mention of “a unified 
registry of beneficiaries to track which families are receiving (or not) benefits from 
which social security/assistance programs”. If this registry could collect data on an 
individual level (not just family), useful data would be available for further analysis on 
gender-differentiated needs and demands. 
• Green growth. World Bank engagement in the region (and beyond) has shown that a 
gender-differentiated analysis of usage patterns, demands, and payment schemes of 
issues such as water management and energy diversification can provide valuable 
insights to create more adequate solutions that enhance project effectiveness.

Portfolio Review 
13. 
A consistent incorporation of gender issues into the World Bank’s work has proved to 
increase developmental benefits. Thus, besides high impact gender specific initiatives at the 
State and Municipal level through existing or new operations, the World Bank will further 
explore and support ways to mainstream gender issues within its operational work.

ANNEX 7. OAXACA ENGAGEMENT: AN EXAMPLE OF COMPREHENSIVE 
ENGAGEMENT AT SUBNATIONAL LEVEL 

1. 
The State of Oaxaca faces enormous development challenges and major institutional 
weaknesses.  Oaxaca is among the Mexican states with the highest levels of poverty and the 
lowest levels of economic performance.  The state is characterized by a high illiteracy rate. Its 
average income per capita at roughly US$3,400 is near to that of Swaziland and Guatemala, but 
far from the Mexican average of US$8,960. With a predominantly indigenous population, 
Oaxaca has a highly dispersed population spread across a highly mountainous territory.  Service 
delivery is complicated by numerous municipalities. There is limited budget flexibility and 
public sector management is weak.  

The MoU approach 
2. 
These development challenges call for multi-stakeholder and multi-dimensional 
support.  The World Bank has been supporting the reform agenda for inclusive growth of 
Oaxaca through a strategic programmatic partnership since 2011. In June 2011 the Bank and the 
Government of Oaxaca signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that included multi-
year, multi-sectoral support to the state, combining a package of knowledge, convening, and 
financial services. These services were structured around four areas: (a) public sector 
modernization, (b) sustainable development, (c) finance and private sector, and (d) human 
development.  The MoU was originally established for two years (2011-13) and was renewed 
for two additional years in June 2013 (July 2013 – June 2015). 
3. 
The approach of this partnership is similar to a country’s CPS and represents a 
departure from an operational or ESW-centric approach to sector dialogue and 
development solutions.  It recognizes the need to retain long-term engagement based on agreed 
objectives and development challenges not subject to the unanticipated changes in financing and 
knowledge needs in particular sectors.  
4. 
After two years of implementation, the MoU has proven to be a successful 
strategy to support the reform agenda for the inclusive growth of Oaxaca.  The strategy has 
led to the following main results:  
• Government counterparts have built up technical capacity in the different areas of 
reform (e.g., trainings and workshops in strategic sector planning, public investment, 
water utility management, forestry management).  
• The Bank has informed policy design and implementation.  
• Resources have been mobilized leveraging co-financing of other organizations, such as 
the UNDP, the MacArthur Foundation, and Transparency International–Mexico.  
• A concurrence of key national and local stakeholders has been brought together to the 
table to participate in a specific development agenda.  
• Concrete and fundamental tools for efficient policymaking have been generated. 
5. 
Several outputs have been produced from this partnership to modernize the State 
of Oaxaca’s public institutions and policies: (a) design and implementation of a methodology 
to structure strategic sector planning oriented to results; (b) design proposals for an integrated 
public financial management and public investment management systems; (c) strengthen tax 
administration capacity; (d) map existing social programs, (e) exchange good practice 
approaches on reducing maternal mortality, (f) support the consolidation of rural financial 

141 

 
institutions, (g) exchange good practice approaches on public-private partnerships, (h) 
strengthen water utility management, (i) Atlas of Climate and Climate Change, and (j) exchange 
good practice approaches on sustainable development (see Table 1, Areas of Engagement).  
6. 
After two years of implementation, 10 activities have been concluded, 17 are 
under execution, and 3 new activities will be initiated during FY14. Around 70 specialists in 
75 different technical missions have been to Oaxaca, either as technical experts providing 
support to policy reforms or sharing experiences in seminars and forums that have been 
organized to strengthen the institutional capacity of the state.  
7. 
Sources of funding to develop the MoU include Bank Budget (BB), Global 
Environmental Facility (GEF), Institutional Development Fund (IDF), and Financial 
Sector Reform and Strengthening Fund (FIRST). Development solutions to improve 
competitiveness and the business climate in Oaxaca have also been explored through the 
Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), a joint facility of the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank. The IFC has also contributed to the promotion of public 
and private associations in Oaxaca. 
Proposed engagement approach during the next CPS 

8. 
Development challenges in Oaxaca are structural and require sustained long-
term support in order to shift the current trends.  The Bank and the Government of Oaxaca 
will expand the Bank’s ongoing analytical and operational activities during the next two years. 
Mexico’s Ministry of Finance has also asked the Bank to expand the Oaxaca’s thematic MoU 
model to states of Guerrero and Chiapas. This support both at the federal and state levels 
reinforces the Bank’s subnational engagement. 
9. 
A work program with Oaxaca has been prepared and agreed for FY14-15. The 
MoU is composed of 20 activities, most of which are the continuation of the work that was 
carried out during FY12 and FY13, and a set of new activities has been identified to accompany 
the government efforts and strengthen its agenda such as an assessment of governmental 
accounting harmonization status, the development of tourism development strategies, and a 
project on sustainable production systems and biodiversity. 
10. 
Oaxaca has also expressed its interest in expanding the program with the Bank 
through a specific loan in the water sector. The Water and Sanitation Sector (WSS) 
Modernization Program (P145578) will seek to improve the quality and sustainability of WSS 
services and WSS sector information in the State of Oaxaca.  
11. 
The Bank will continue to provide to Oaxaca with all the necessary information 
and technical advice to facilitate the participation of the state in the federal programs that 
are supported by the Bank.  Specifically, Oaxaca could get technical support and the 
necessary financing to improve urban transport, promote renewable energy sources, and support 
rural communities to sustainably manage their forests.  
12. 
The Bank’s knowledge program on Oaxaca will also be supported by 
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS). Reimbursable advisory services are an increasingly 
important way for the Bank to meet Oaxaca’s demand through the provision of customized 
advisory services. In June 2013, for example, a RAS was signed between the Government of 
Oaxaca and the World Bank to contribute to the improvement of the quality and efficiency of 
the State of Oaxaca’s public expenditure management.

ENDNOTES 

1 Annex 5 provides a detailed description of both Mexican and World Bank’s methodologies for measuring poverty, 
as well as detailed data tables with poverty rates by state and by method. 
2 One limitation of analyzing the official Multi-dimensional Poverty Index is that there are only three years with 
available data: 2008, 2010, and 2012. Thus, in order to study long-term poverty trends it is necessary to use a 
monetary poverty indicator, which was the previous official poverty measure in Mexico and which is still produced 
by CONEVAL 
3 Analysis about mobility and middle class in Mexico and the region can be found in “Economic Mobility and the 
Rise of the Latin American Middle Class” at http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/13/crecimiento-
clase-media-america-latina. 
4 Annex 4 includes the overview chapter of the policy notes prepared in 2011-12 by World Bank staff.  The 
complete set is accessible at http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/research/all. 
5 Annex 3 contains a section on recent economic events and the macroeconomic outlook. 
6 Refer to “Fostering sound financial sector development”, Policy Note No.1; “Toward a more competitive business 
environment”, Policy Note No. 2; “Fostering innovation for productivity and competitiveness”, Policy Note, No.3.   
7 Refer to “Labor Markets for Inclusive Growth”, Mexico Policy Note No.4. 
8 The OECD launched the Programme for International Student Assessment (1997) to evaluate education systems. 
9 The largest insurance programs in Mexico are the Instituto Mexicano de los Seguros Sociales (IMSS), the Instituto 
de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSTE) and Régimen Estatal de Protección Social 
en Salud (Seguro Popular). Refer to “Social Protection”, Mexico Policy Note No.5. 
10 Gender differences in poverty, as well as additional information about gender as entry points to the CPS can be 
found in Annex 5 and 6. 
11 Refer to “Managing medium term fiscal challenges”, Mexico Policy Note No. 8; “Strengthening public revenue 
and expenditure management to enhance service delivery”, Mexico Policy Note No. 9; and “Strengthening sub-
national public finance”, Mexico Policy Note No.10. 
12 Refer to “Reducing the footprint of growth”, Mexico Policy Note No. 6; and “Using natural resources in an 
optimal way”, Mexico Policy Note No. 7.

16 Following Mexico’s Multi-dimensional Poverty Index, the assessment identifies whether WBG interventions have 
a high, average or low expected impact on income poverty or on the access to any of the basic needs that are 
reflected in the multi-dimensional index (i.e., housing, infrastructure, education, health, social security and food 
security). A high value represents areas where the initial expected direct impact could be on both the income side 
and the access to basic needs consistent with the Mexico multi-dimensional index. In other words, this refers to 
strategic areas on which WBG interventions could have a direct impact on “extreme poverty”, defined as population 
with monetary income below the ‘minimum welfare’ line and with at least three deprivations. An average value 
reflects areas where the initial impact could be either on the income side or on the access to basic needs. Finally, a 
low value refers to areas that may not necessarily have an expected direct impact on the income or the basic needs 
sides (i.e. a direct impact on the extreme poor). 
17 Shared prosperity focuses on income growth of the bottom 40 % of the population; 'average' or 'low' indicates the 
WBG's impact on economic growth in general. 'High' indicates impact on specific target groups within the bottom 
40%. 
18 A sharp GDP contraction was largely the result of a collapse in external demand and international trade. Exports 
and imports fell 13.7 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively, in 2009. Between October 2008 and June 2009, Mexico 
lost almost a million jobs. 
19 Between 2006 and 2010, the moderate poverty rate increased from 42.7 percent to 51.3 percent (to 57.7 million 
people) and the extreme poverty rate increased from 13.8 percent to 19.8 percent (to 21.2 million people). 
20 When considering economic losses due to crime, victimization surveys estimate that in 2010 alone, crime costs 
victims losses of US$12.9 billion, and additional health expenses of US$619 million (INEGI Encuesta Nacional de 
Victimización y Percepción sobre Seguridad Pública (ENVIPE), INEGI, Mexico (2011a, 2012b). Moreover, 
empirical evidence also suggests that municipalities with higher levels of drug-related crimes in 2007 have grown at

a slower pace between 2005 and 2010 than municipalities less affected by this shock (Lopez-Calva, L. F, Rodriguez-
Castelan, C., and K. Scott (2012). Brief Cost and Impacts of Crime and Violence in Mexico. Washington, D.C.: The 
World Bank -- Mimeo).

25 A comparative analysis of childcare programs was conducted seeking to compare international standards in the 
provision of childcare services to the Mexican model.  Preliminary findings highlighted the fact that Programa de 
Estancias Infantiles was focused on female labor force participation rather than in ECD. Recommendations to the 
client were provided in order to increase the impact of the country’s program.

28 Baja California Sur, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Estado de México, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Tabasco, Veracruz and Yucatán. 
29 Several factors have contributed to this situation. For instance, the increase in urbanization in Mexico places a 
tremendous strain on urban services, such as the urban transport and electricity networks. Water and sanitation 
services are subject to the capacity of state and municipal operators and thus vary greatly in quality and coverage 
across regions in Mexico.

31Proof of this was the approval and publication of the PECC (Special Program for Climate Change) in Mexico’s 
official Gazette in August 2009, which was fundamental to creating a comprehensive policy framework for 
reduction of emissions across sectors.  
32 Key changes in government policy include (a) delays in subsidies payments and in decision-making processes in 
the funding and operation of the government-sponsored mortgage agencies; (b) shift from horizontal to vertical 
housing, which requires more working capital for homebuilders; and (c) additional government requirements for 
homebuilders to offer sustainable housing. 
33 The sector strategy goal is to achieve 12 GW of wind generation by the year 2020. 
34 The package of advisory and analytical work included (a) just-in-time advice to SEDESOL on the strategy to 
promote local and regional socio-economic development in the southern states of Mexico, enhancing the capacity of 
the poorest states and municipalities to pursue green growth; (b) an SFLAC fund to design municipal indices and a 
sustainable local development guide that enhanced policy dialogue and included policy actions targeting sustainable 
territorial development at the municipal level; and (c) a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) exercise that 
helped enhance the quality of the DPL operation by providing critical analysis and a strong foundation for a more 
effective and informed engagement on climate change adaptation for poverty reduction. 
35 The SINAVE index comprises measures for three of its four sub-systems, including nine different elements, as 
follows: (1) the system for the weekly notification of reportable diseases; (2) the sentinel health facility surveillance 
system; (3) the surveillance system for acute flaccid paralysis; (4) the surveillance system for acute febrile illness; 
(5) the surveillance system for HIV/AIDS; (6) the surveillance system for diabetes; (7) the surveillance system for 
neural tube defects; (8) the registry system for malignant neoplasms, and (9) the surveillance system for addictions. 
Examples of indicators for these elements include: the percentage of medical centers reporting cases in a timely 
manner, the number of consecutive weeks of reporting, the number of notified cases of specific diseases among 
children, the percentage of samples drawn according to standards and percentage of probable cases tested in a timely 
manner. Data for these indicators is provided by health facilities, sentinel sites and laboratories across the country 
and consolidated by the SINAVE at the federal level. 
36 This compendium does not discuss economic and social challenges related to citizen security. Parallel research 
efforts are being launched to shed light on trends of citizen insecurity and their implications for inclusive and 
sustainable growth in Mexico. 
37 In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP per capita. 
38 Evidence based on the US manufacturing sector shows that increasing an industry’s intensity in R&D by 1 
percentage point increases the growth rate of output per worker in that industry by between 0.08-0.16 percentage 
points (Zachariadis, 2003). 
39 The middle class headcount is the number of individuals with daily incomes between 10 and 50 dollars (in 2005 
US dollar, PPP terms). They fall approximately between the 66th percentile to 98th percentile in the household survey 
(World Bank, 2012b).

40 Environmental Indicators (UNEP 2007). 
41 There are a number of measures that identify and emphasize different aspects of the environment such as resource 
exhaustion, pollution, or impacts on health and economic activity 
42 For example, Ley General para la Prevención y Gestión Integral de los Residuos y su Reglamento y sus Normas 
Oficiales Mexicanos; Programa Nacional para la Prevención y Gestión Integral de los Residuos 2009-2012. 
Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT). 
43 Examples are Federal Law to Prevent and Eliminate Discrimination (LGPED-2003), the General Law on Equality 
between Men and Women (LGIMH-2006), and the General Law on Women’s Access to a Life Free of Violence 
(LGAMVLV-2007)
