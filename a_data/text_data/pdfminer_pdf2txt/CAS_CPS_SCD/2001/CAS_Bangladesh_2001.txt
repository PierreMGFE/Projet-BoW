MISSION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. 
The World Bank Group concurs with the Government that poverty reduction must be Bangladesh's
overarching objective. Despite encouraging progress 
in reducing poverty and improving human
development during the 1990s, the average growth of 5% in recent years, while respectable, has not
fulfilled the economy's potential nor been strong enough to reduce poverty substantially. The ambition to
eliminate absolute poverty within a generation requires a greater effort: fostering an environment that
would promote faster, more broadly distributed growth and more effective delivery of public services.
Since Bangladesh lacks strong, accountable institutions to match its rich human and natural resources,
the Government's poverty reduction strategy needs to address these institutional weaknesses, particularly
poor governance, and the slow pace of policy and structural reforms. The World Bank Group's mission in
Bangladesh is to help the Government in implementing such a strategy.

DEVELOPMmENT CHALLENGES

2. 

Bangladesh's prudent macroeconomic management and progress in improving opportunities for
the poor during the past decade have been notable. The success of the program has been enhanced by
participation of NGOs acting independently or as contracted service delivery agents of the Government.
These achievements notwithstanding, weak institutions and poor governance adversely affect the quality
of life of ordinary citizens and are mainly responsible for pervasive corruption, deteriorating law and
order and inefficient and often unresponsive public administration. The persistence of confrontational
politics - notwithstanding recent decline of its intensity - and the strength of entrenched vested interests
that oppose reform have weakened attempts to address these concerns. Inaction on policy reforms has
hampered public sector performance, leading to high costs of conducting business and making economic
activity and private investment risky. Extensive consultations with civic society, political leaders and the
Government during CAS preparation lend support to these conclusions.

3. 

The broad development challenge of accelerating and broadening growth can be met by
* 
reversing recent erosion in macroeconomic performance,
* 
sustaining and building upon human development gains,
* 
increasing the pace of agricultural and non-farm rural growth and
* 
enabling private sector-led growth through regulatory reform and structural reforms in the
financial and infrastructure sectors.

Meeting this challenge successfully depends on mustering the political will to overcome the vested
interests that block reforms. A growing public 'voice' in favor of fundamental reforms, the emergence of
capable and accountable institutions and improved governance would all facilitate this process. 
In
parallel, the efficient use of public resources, both foreign and domestic, is necessary not only to bring
about pro-poor growth but also essential as aid levels decline and domestic resource mobilization remains
weak. Aid effectiveness could be improved if the Government were to exercise greater ownership of its
development programs, commits to policy reforms and strengthens project implementation.

STRATEGIC PRIORIES

4. 
The Government has articulated a poverty reduction strategy centered on fostering private sector-
led growth and promoting integrated rural development, improving social and human development
services and strengthening safety nets for the poor. In line with these strategic priorities and the expected
contributions of other development partners, the CAS identifies four main thrusts for the Bank Group's
assistance to Bangladesh.

* Helping to build stronger institutions and governance across development programs.

* Consolidating gains in human development and supporting initiatives to address the next
generation of development challenges in education, health and nutrition.

* 

Implementing an integrated approach to rural development, including supporting growth in
agriculture and non-farm activities, making opportunities and assets available to the poor and
improving rural infrastructure.

* Accelerating and broadening private sector-led growth by helping to: (i) remove structural
impediments and establish an environment conducive to private investment (IDA); (ii)
strengthen the financial sector (IDA and IFC); and (iii) support private investments in energy,
infrastructure, manufacturing and services (IFC and MIGA).

5. 
In addressing these priorities, the CAS reflects lessons learned, consultations with stakeholders
and an increased potential for strategic partnerships. CAS implementation will be in accord with the
Comprehensive Development Framework principles of partnership and government ownership. 
In
Bangladesh, there has been good progress in areas where strong partnerships based on sharing of
resources and expertise have been forged, such as in health and nutrition programs. Donors have many
opportunities to build on such successes and to partner with the Government, private sector, NGOs and
community-based organizations to increase aid effectiveness. To strengthen government ownership of
development programs, IDA and other development partners have begun a dialogue with the Government
on restructuring their relationship. This dialogue will intensify as the Government prepares the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that, when completed in late 2001, will provide the basis for a
Government-led, donor-assisted program of poverty reduction.

LOW, BASE, AND HIGH CASE SCENARIOS

6. 
The intensity of Bank Group engagement with Bangladesh would be predicated on macroeconomic
performance, progress on governance and structural reforms and status of the portfolio. The Low Case
scenario is characterized by negligible progress on structural reform, no improvement in portfolio
performance, and continued slippage in macroeconomic performance from pre-FYOO levels. 
In this
environment, the one that currently prevails in Bangladesh, IDA believes that selected interventions in
health, education, rural development and governance 
improvement (e.g. judicial/legal reform) -
comprising a core poverty program - would protect progress achieved in these areas and help to maintain
dialogue with the Government. The core poverty program would be delivered utilizing community-driven
approaches to bring opportunities to the poor and to deliver essential social services. Successful models
that already exist in micro-credit and rural infrastructure can be scaled up and replicated in other sectors.
Low Case IDA lending over the FY01-03 period is expected to be about US$800 million. Since IFC's role
in promoting private sector development also depends on the policy environment, 
its Low Case
interventions would focus on limited investments and advisory services in support of small and medium
enterprise development.

7. 
IDA support of analytical work, policy dialogue in key sectors and outreach activities to build
consensus behind reforms will take on added prominence under the Low Case scenario. A key element of
the non-lending program will be collaboration with the IMF, the Asian Development Bank and other
donors to provide analytical support and advice to the Government in preparing its PRSP. Specific inputs
include a public expenditure review, a poverty assessment and an analysis of safety-net programs, the
findings of which will be available to the Government during its PRSP preparation.

8. 
The Base Case scenario is characterized by restoration of macroeconomic balances to the pre-
FYoo levels, progress in addressing govermance and structural reforms and improvements in project
implementation. In these circumstances, in addition to financial support for the core poverty program,
lending could be extended to a few key sectors where significant reform is initiated, private sector
participation is growing and where the Bank Group has an existing or emerging comparative advantage.

ii

The extent to which the Government acts to advance reform in these sectors will determine the magnitude
and sectoral composition of Base Case lending. If the policy and institutional obstacles to an expanding
private sector presence in the infrastructure and gas sectors were removed, IFC and MIGA could play a
significantly larger role in mobilizing financing in these areas.

9. 
Base Case lending over the CAS period would be about US$1.4 billion, a composite of Low Case
lending in FY01 (around US$300 million) and higher levels in FY02-03 that would be closer to the
indicative annual IDA allocation. Given the lower lending level in FYO1, the average per capita IDA
program for Bangladesh would remain below that of other developing countries with similar levels of GNP
per capita and policy performance. Bangladesh could have access to more IDA funding if tangible steps
were taken to address institutional weaknesses and improve governance so that the country raises its
capacity to absorb larger amounts of aid and use resources more effectively.

10. 
The High Case scenario assumes comprehensive reform, with the government adopting and
initiating implementation of a broad-based reform agenda covering governance, institutional and
structural issues in many of the key sectors - energy, banking/finance, water resources, agriculture, urban
development, public administration, health, education and the cross-cutting area of decentralization.
Bank Group support under this scenario could be substantially higher (up to US$2.0 billion over the
three-year period) and would include adjustment support in addition to financing for technical assistance
and project investments. In the event that Bangladesh moves to a High Case scenario, a CAS progress
report would accompany Board presentation of adjustment operations, which could include a Poverty
Reduction Support Credit and/or lending to support structural reforms in strategic sectors such as
finance/banking and power. The CAS progress report would outline actions taken by the Government to
advance its development agenda, and indicate the areas where adjustment lending would accelerate the
implementation of reforms. In the High Case scenario, IFC could play a larger role in financing private
investment, developing financial markets and providing advisory services related to privatization.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

11. 
Overall performance of IDA's Bangladesh portfolio has been below the Bank-wide average. The
percentage of projects evaluated by the Operations Evaluation Department as having unsatisfactory
outcomes remained persistently high at about 19% during the past five fiscal years. To address these
problems, IDA's portfolio management strategy will focus on quality at entry and improved supervision.
A portfolio improvement action plan that draws on lessons learnt has been formulated and agreed with
the Government. These lessons include the need for increased government ownership, beneficiary
participation in decision-making, greater involvement of the private sector, NGOs and local governments
in project implementation and greater attention to sustainability issues such as recurrent expenditure
requirements for operations and maintenance, cost recovery, and policy reforms. The plan, which
proposes better supervision planning, timely portfolio performance reviews and a further judicious
shifting of portfolio supervision to the Dhaka field office, will be implemented during the CAS period.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING

12. 

Achievement of development outcomes will be monitored at two levels:

* Overall performance against a set of core benchmarks - poverty, macroeconomic and social
indicators.

* Specific performance on progress indicators linked to each of the four CAS priorities -
governance, human development, rural development and private sector-led growth.

RISKS

13. 
CAS implementation is subject to significant political and economic risks. A general election is
due in mid-2001. The next government's willingness to invest political capital in implementing reforms is

iii

likely to depend on the decisiveness of the election outcome. The CAS is flexibly designed to increase
support if the new Government adopts a more reformist stance. However, if the current situation of
stalled or slow reforms persists, the World Bank Group would focus only on supporting direct anti-
poverty and social sector programs and non-lending services for analytical work and consensus building
on governance reforms.

14. 
Macroeconomic slippage presents another major risk. The Multi-fiber Agreement phase-out
along with sustained oil price increases could exacerbate the situation. This risk is being mitigated
through ongoing policy advice on export diversification and assistance to the Government in closely
monitoring the balance of payments. Bangladesh will also continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters.
IDA will help the Government to implement a longer-term disaster mitigation strategy and, if necessary,
provide post-disaster recovery assistance, as was done following the 1998 floods.

ISSUES FOR BoARD DISCUSSION

15. 

In its discussions, the Board may wish to consider the following:

* The appropriateness of the proposed assistance strategy in the context of Bangladesh's
economic and political environment, recognizing that Bangladesh's complex development
challenges require the Bank Group to be flexible to respond to the presence or absence of
clear Government progress in addressing constraints in key sectors.

• 

The feasibility of low-key engagement and of pursuing mechanisms to deliver alternative non-
government aid for core poverty needs in the face of increased political risks and
uncertainties.

* The appropriateness of triggers underlying the lending scenarios.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH

I. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. INTRODUCTION

1. 
Bangladesh's development is a mosaic of achievements and disappointments. The
country's achievements - an inspiration to development practitioners worldwide - are many, but so are
the profoundly disturbing signs of performance falling far short of potential. Thanks to prudent
macroeconomic management and generally sound policies during the past decade, indicators of economic
and social well being have improved steadily. Real per capita income grew by about 3% per annum
during the 1990s; rice - the main staple - and other food items became more available and affordable.
Similarly, life expectancy, infant mortality, literacy and access to safe water improved appreciably. The
reduction in population growth and fertility rates and the rise in literacy levels and gender parity in
school enrollment rates all represent important gains. Bangladesh has continuously strengthened its
disaster management capabilities. This enhanced capability, as well as the resilience of its long suffering
people, was in ample evidence during the country's resolute and effective response in 1998 to one of the
century's worst floods.

2. 
The Government has made very effective use of Bangladesh's sizeable and globally
respected NGO community to bring opportunities, services and social awareness to its
poor millions. NGOs have introduced such renowned innovations as micro-credit and a highly
acclaimed non-formal model of school education and promoted social mobilization. Both the
Government and donors readily acknowledge the NGOs' positive role and their contribution to grassroots
empowerment.

3. 
Nevertheless, many daunting development challenges remain. First, despite relatively
strong economic performance in the late 1990s, massive poverty, particularly in rural areas, and
inequality persist. GDP growth rates averaging 5% per annum appear to be well below Bangladesh's
potential. Second, confrontational politics, the recent decline of its intensity notwithstanding, weakens
the political will and social stamina needed to challenge the self-serving elite, bureaucracy, military, labor
unions and corrupt business forces - the vested interests that block reforms widely recognized as critical
for accelerating and broadening growth. Third, poor governance, weak institutions and mediocre public
sector performance inhibit growth and reduce the access of the poor to public services and benefits.
Fourth, aid has been less effective than it could be, reducing the impact of development assistance on
growth and poverty reduction.

B. POVERTY AND SOCIAL ISSUES

4. While progress in reducing poverty in recent years has been encouraging, poverty
continues to be deep and pervasive. Bangladesh has the highest incidence of poverty in South Asia
and the third highest number of poor in the world after India and China. Nearly half of its 130 million
population lives below the poverty line (1998 poverty assessment) with nearly 90% concentrated in the
rural areas. Poverty reduction was slow during the mid-1980s due to limited progress in reduction of
rural poverty, but accelerated in the early 1990s. The national poverty headcount declined from 59% in
1984 to 53% in 1996, while the incidence of extreme poverty declined from 41% to 36%, respectively. A
more complete and updated picture of the poverty trends should emerge from the analysis of the 2000-01
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES).

5. 
Data from earlier surveys suggest that income inequalityl has risen mainly due to differential
patterns of growth between rural and urban areas. While agriculture - the mainstay of the rural economy
- grew only at an average annual rate of 2% between 1986-96, growth in the urban sector - fueled by
garment exports - averaged 20% per annum. 
In addition to different urban and rural poverty rates, the
incidence varied considerably in different areas of the country. Poverty was lowest in Chittagong division
(45%) and highest in Rajshahi (62%). Since these regional disparities were largely due to differences in
area rather than household characteristics, investments to overcome geographically specific deficiencies
could play an important role in poverty reduction, particularly in rural areas.

6. 
Although agricultural output, especially foodgrain production expanded rapidly during the last half
of the 1990s, the lack of a coordinated approach to rural development has resulted in lost opportunities in
accelerating growth of the rural economy through greater diversification and faster growth of rural non-
farm activity. Overall rural growth has been slower than it could have been, reducing the rate of rural
poverty reduction. A high proportion of the rural poor who rely on agricultural labor or petty informal
sector activities - despite Bangladesh's extensive safety net system -
remains highly vulnerable to
seasonal fluctuations and to natural disasters. The low levels of human capital and skills as well as lack of
access to productive assets, inputs and credit further handicap the rural poor. Land ownership and
education are key determinants of living standards in the country. While the potential for reducing
poverty through land redistribution is limited in a densely populated country like Bangladesh, investing
in human capital offers significant possibilities for improving living standards.

7. 
Gains in social development indicators, while impressive, still require maintenance
and follow-up. 
Increased emphasis accorded by the Government and the donor community to the
social 
sectors 
as well as 
the

contribution made by NGOs have

of the Government, have introduced
globally renowned innovations to reach the poor, such as micro-credit, a highly acclaimed non-formal

assistance is supported by the Government through the Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF). These

advances, in turn, contributed to significant progress in improving gender equity in education
and at the work place in the past decade. Much remains to be done, however, to reduce

discrimination and increase women's limited decision-making power, phenomena that persist despite

constitutional guarantees on gender equity.

8. 
Bangladesh has ratified six of the eight International Labor Organization conventions on core
labor standards, but not the two pertaining to child labor. Despite the formal ratification, the
Government still restricts freedom of association in export processing zones to attract foreign investment.

both women and children primarily for forced prostitution continue,2 notwithstanding efforts by the
Government to address these social problems. The issue of child labor is particularly worrisome because
6.3 million children below 14 years of age, constituting 12% of Bangladesh's labor force, are working and
out-of-school. Improvement is, however, expected in the future as a result of the growing support of the
Government, civil society and international organizations for efforts to abolish child labor and provide
working children with alternatives that would allow them to resume schooling.

C. POLITICAL ECONOMY AND THE CHALLENGE OF GOVERNANCE

9. 
Bangladesh's politics remain confrontational and inimical to reform. Although the
popular movement that overthrew the military government in 1991 restored democracy, the Governments
that followed both the 1991 and 1996 elections came to office with only narrow pluralities, receiving
around 35% of the popular vote. Since 1994, Bangladesh's transition to democracy has been impeded by
confrontational politics, particularly when the opposition parties (the Awami League in 1995 and the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 1999-2000) attempted to oust elected Governments through street
agitation and "hartals,"3 rather than through parliamentary debate or other non-violent processes.

10. 

Along with acute political conflict and consequently weakened Governments, the
powerful influence of vested interests has prevented the implementation of reforms widely
recognized as necessary to accelerate growth and reduce poverty. First, confrontational
politics have led to frequent hartals. The business community estimates that each day of hartal costs
US$60 million. Second, the political environment has bred violence in labor and student politics and
contributed to an overall climate of lawlessness in which life and property are both insecure. Third, the
rampant politicization of economic and technical decisions has bred a conservative, risk-averse outlook.
Policy and institutional reforms, seen as politically risky in the short term, have stalled. Fourth, the
strong presence of vested interests discourages reforms because politicians fear loss of both campaign
financing and the ability to mobilize supporters for political objectives. The political leadership has thus
perceived the short-run political costs of reform to outweigh longer-term benefits. Consequently,
progress on policy reforms stagnated in the second half of the decade.

11. 
Inaction on policy reforms has left deep-seated structural problems in place,
weakening 
institutional capacity and insuring that poor governance undermines
Bangladesh's ability to achieve development objectives. Weak, minimally accountable
institutions, pervasive corruption, deteriorating law and order and an inefficient and often unresponsive
public administration hurt performance across all sectors and the quality of life of ordinary citizens. 4
Political debate in Parliament that scants discussion of issues reflects these factors, as do Parliament's
weak oversight of public affairs, a highly centralized political and administrative structure and poorly
functioning legal and judicial systems. Given the State's dominant role, average Bangladeshi citizens
experience these constraints every day as they cope with the mismanaged banking system, persistent
power shortages, inefficient and bankrupt state-owned enterprises, and poorly regulated and managed
ports, telecommunications and roads. Endemic corruption, especially at the interface between the public
and the state, and decline in the quality of the civil service have led to very low expectations of public
services. As a result, the high cost of conducting business makes economic activity risky and deters
private investment. Reversing the institutional decline caused by neglect and civil war prior to
independence and years of military rule thereafter and improving governance are thus major challenges.

12. 
Public consultations carried out for the CAS support this assessment. People and
grassroots organizations repeatedly cited instances of the ways that institutional weaknesses, especially

Council Review of Trade Policies of Bangladesh (Geneva, May2-4, 2000).
3 Hartal is a local term for a forced total shutdown of the fornal economy, often accompanied by violence among political groups.
4 These observations are consistent with Bangladesh's Public Administration Reform Commission's Report of June, 2000. The
Report states in page 7, Volume 1: 'Public agencies have been generally characterized as being rigid, unresponsive, inefficient and
ineffective, pre-occupied with process rather than results, driven by outdated rules and regulations...."; and on page 83, Volume 1:
'Corruption pervades public life and public administration in Bangladesh. Corruption takes place at both political and bureaucratic
levels, occasionally independent of each other, sometimes in collusion."

3

poor governance and corruption, affect their daily lives. 
In particular they stressed the urgency of
assuring the life and property of common citizens and also emphasized the need for government
decentralization, seen as essential for greater accountability and effectiveness in delivery of services to
communities, particularly the poor. They reflected the emerging hope that community 'voice,' assertive
institutions like the Supreme Court, an independent media, a growing class of young entrepreneurs and
vocal NGOs will energize the public to demand better governance.

Box 1: Corruption and its Underlying Causes

Corruption in Bangladesh exacts such a heavy toll that econometric analysis suggests its reduction to levels similar to
those in countries like Singapore and Sweden would raise GDP growth by about 2.5% per annum. This achievement
would contribute significantly to poverty reduction.

Corruption imposes a disproportionate burden on the poor. They are forced to go without access to power and water
because they cannot afford the illicit payments necessary to secure connections. They receive lower quality health and
education services since they cannot pay bribes to those who control access to medical services, education materials and
credit. They also suffer because roads and embankments in their areas are allowed to deteriorate while government
funds are allocated to newer projects that provide more opportunities for kickbacks.

The effects of corruption are compounded by the structure of Bangladeshi society. The rules of social interaction at the
household, community, market and state level are still often expressed through client/patron relationships and
determined by kinship, lineage status, regional and sub-regional identity and gender. Although Bangladesh's legal
framework enshrines equality, the rule of law that treats all citizens equaDly, operates very unevenly. Therefore,
inequalities embedded in traditional hierarchical household, community and market institutions continue to exert a
powerful impact, allowing political and personal power to play dominant roles. 
In this environmnent, individual
challenges to the system are highly risky; no institutions guarantee impartiality or predictable outcomes. Thus, until a
"critical mass" drawn from both the poor and the middle class emerges to demand a rule-based society that can actually
support equality for all citizens under the law, progress on reforms will be slow and pervasive corruption will continue.

Box 2: Private Sector Development

The private sector in Bangladesh is dominated by a few sectors. Outside of agriculture, export-oriented garment and
knitwear manufacturing is the largest area of formal private sector activity, accounting for about 70% of total exports.
Power and natural gas have also been important areas of private investment. Much of the rest of the private sector is in the
informal sector, including small-scale manufacturing and trading.
Although a modem, outward-looking group of entrepreneurs has begun to emerge in Bangladesh, the privilege-seeking
tendencies characteristic of the older industrial sector persist. The many long-established domestic enterprises that
depended heavily on protected markets, government interventions and defaulted loans from public banks stand to lose
from liberalization. A group of newer entrants, both domestic and foreign, with a greater orientation toward export
markets, however, view government intervention as a hindrance rather than a help.

Structural and trade reforms in the 1990s had a positive impact on private sector development, especially in the export
and manufacturing sectors, and in attracting foreign direct investment in the 1990s. Private investment as a percentage of
GDP increased from 9.8 % in 1990 to 15.5% in 1999. Net foreign direct investment increased from US$14 million in 1990
to US$192 million in 1999, mainly in power generation and natural gas production. Garments and knitwear exports were
the driving force behind the last decade's export boom growing at 22% per annun until 1998. The manufacturing sector
also recorded an impressive annual growth rate of 7.7% during the 1990-98s.

Poor governance, heavy taxation, inadequate infrastructure (especially power, telecommunications and transport) and
social and political instability have raised the costs of doing business to very high levels. Access to finance is limited, due
to the weak commercial banking system and underdeveloped capital markets. Together with slow trade reforms and
appreciation of the exchange rate, this has undermined Bangladesh's fundamental competitive advantage in labor-
intensive manufacturing, and deterred foreign investment. As a result, private sector growth has slowed in the past two
years, as shown by average manufacturing growth of below 5%.

The Government has emphasized the private sector's role, especialy in export-oriented industries, as the engine for
sustained growth and employment generation in the current five-year Plan (1997-2002). However, it has taken few
concrete steps to lower the costs of doing business, strengthen the financial system and complete the trade policy reforms.
State-owned enterprises continue to dominate key markets, including gas production, power and telecommunications.

13. 
Unless the underlying institutional and governance issues are addressed, neither
foreign nor domestically funded programs will achieve their potential for accelerating
economic growth and reducing poverty. During the Bangladesh Development Forum in Paris in

4

April 2000 and recent donor meetings in Dhaka, governance and institutional issues have moved toward
center stage as the fulcrum of development assistance. At these meetings, the donors also encouraged the
government to assert stronger leadership in formulating the country's development agenda, and an effort
to restructure the Government-donor relationship along lines consistent with the comprehensive
development framework (CDF) principles has been initiated.

D. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS

Macroeconomic Management

14. 
As noted earlier, Bangladesh's economic performance in the past decade - particularly in
the recent past - has been relatively strong. Annual GDP growth averaged 5% during the 1990s

(Chart-1A). Manufacturing and construction were the main sources of growth during the first half of the
decade, while agriculture and trade services led during the second half. Bangladesh, the most densely
populated non-city state in the world, has attained near self-sufficiency in food production, thanks to
sustained growth of agriculture in the second half of 1990s. Sizable foreign direct investment flows have
started 
in infrastructure, energy and export-oriented manufacturing. These achievements were
underpinned by relatively high rates of investment (about 22% of GDP), increased public spending on
social sectors and the emergence of progressive entrepreneurs. Good macro management kept inflation in
the single digits during the 1990s, which further declined in the last few years (Chart-IB). The overall
central government budget deficit averaged around 4.7% of GDP during FY90-98, with domestic
financing averaging a modest 1.1% of GDP. In the external sector, where export growth averaged nearly
14% per annum and remittances grew at over 5.5% per annum, Bangladesh kept the annual current
account deficit below 2.5% of GDP on average during the 1990s. Macroeconomic soundness has,
however, weakened in 1999 due to a decline in manufacturing growth (Box 2) and weaker fiscal and
external sector management, warranting corrective action by the Government. 
The 1998 floods
contributed to the deterioration.

15. 
Improving the quality of public expenditures and increasing domestic resource
mobilization are Bangladesh's main fiscal management challenges. While the level of public
spending is not high relative to international norms, the quality of public spending is low and has been

deteriorating. 
Successive public expenditure reviews have emphasized the need to improve the
effectiveness of public spending. The Annual Development Program (ADP) continues to include projects
of questionable rationale and priority. The share of interest payments in recurrent expenditures has also
increased rapidly. 
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have continued to accumulate sizable losses,
markedly increasing the quasi-fiscal deficit (Table 2). Contingent liabilities have also risen sharply due to
Government guaranteed power purchase agreements negotiated with foreign investors and to greater
reliance on suppliers credits - up by nearly 1% of GDP in FY00. Revenue collection, among the lowest in
the world at about 9% of GDP, slipped further during the last two years, with actual collections suffering a
large shortfall against ambitious budgetary targets. Improving revenue collection, historically a priority,
has now assumed greater urgency.

16. With no adjustment in expenditures, the Central Government's fiscal deficit

increased from 4.8% in FY99 to over 6% of GDP in FYOO (Chart-IC). Domestic financing of
the deficit increased from 2.3% of GDP to 4.6% (Chart-ID). Fueled by the sharp increase in

5

Government borrowing from the banking system, broad money growth accelerated to 19% in FYOO from
around 13% in FY99. Bumper agricultural harvests, the slack in non-agricultural activity, delays in
adjusting artificially low administered prices and the Taka's real appreciation (Chart-IF), however, have
so far kept inflation from increasing. As of the end of August 2000, the annual rate of inflation had
declined to 1.7%. Continued monetization of the fiscal deficit, however, will inevitably create inflationary
pressures, as will recent increases in administered energy prices and the rise in international oil prices.
Restoring fiscal and monetary prudence is therefore a high priority. Although the upward adjustment to
domestic gas and oil prices in August 2000 will marginally reduce the quasi-fiscal burden, it is unlikely to
cut SOE losses significantly.

17. 
Official foreign exchange reserves have continued to decline in recent years, recently
reaching less than two months of imports (Chart-lE). Since the floods of 1998 and until recently,
export growth has been modest. Insufficient exchange rate adjustment has contributed to lower export
earnings. The low reserves position, the increased injection of liquidity into the economy and the
relatively large devaluation of the currencies of competing countries in the region have increased pressure
on the exchange rate. The Government responded with a 6% devaluation of the Taka vis-a-vis the US
dollar in mid-August 2000, the largest single devaluation in 25 years. A delayed response to declining
external competitiveness, the move was too limited to reverse the Taka's real effective appreciation over
the past three years. The capital account has come under increased pressure with the decline in official
aid disbursements and an increase in unaccounted outflows, as evidenced by the rise in balance of
payments 'errors and omissions", which warrants improvement in statistical data and reflects perhaps an
increase in uneounted outflows. 
In the medium-term, pressures on the exchange rate and the external
account will increase further due to the developments in the external environment described below.

18. 

The IMF, through its annual Article IV consultations, and the Bank have been urging

the Government to strengthen macroeconomic management by improving the country's
revenue effort, prioritizing expenditures, containing 
the losses of state-owned enterprises and
implementing much needed structural reforms, particularly in the financial sector.

Medium-termn Prospects and External Environment

19. While 
the global environment offers promise, several 
factors complicate
Bangladesh's external position and could adversely affect medium-term prospects. The
projected increase in the growth of income, trade and financial flows of OECD countries and India,
Bangladesh's main trading partners, and the rapid expansion of new information technology suggest a
promising climate for Bangladesh's exports and terms of trade, notwithstanding higher petroleum prices.
Foreign direct investment in power, gas and export-oriented manufacturing -- projected to increase from
US$470 million per year in 1996-2000 to over US$750 million in 2001-2005 -- could also improve long-
term growth and export prospects. Bangladesh's gas reserves are a major potential source of foreign
exchange earnings, if opposition to their export can be overcome.

20. 
To take full advantage of emerging global opportunities, Bangladesh will need to
address weakness in its domestic policy environment and manage downside risks. During
the early 1990s, the Government lowered tariffs, eliminated quantitative restrictions and used the flexible
exchange rate mechanism effectively to promote exports. This substantial progress in trade reforms has
not been maintained, and the lack of complementary reforms to improve the provision of power,
infrastructure, telecommunications and financial services has meant below potential benefits from
increased openness. Bangladesh's increased domestic borrowing and growing imbalances have weakened
its external position and become a potential source of instability.

21. 
Pressure on the external sector could increase further due to foreign exchange denominated
obligations to foreign investors in the energy sector resulting in an increase in debt servicing
requirements. External debt management has so far been prudent and, given the high grant element of
Bangladesh's loan portfolio, the debt-service ratio has remained under 10% of export earnings. The
export sector however, faces uncertainty over the medium term because it relies heavily on ready-made
garments that account for three-quarters of its export earnings5. These exports, hitherto benefiting from
quota allocations under the Multi Fiber Agreement (MFA) or Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),

will face greater competition after 2005 when preferential programs are phased out. Unless Bangladesh's

exports become more competitive, foreign exchange earnings growth is likely to slow. Bangladesh could
turn the threat arising in the twilight of the MFA and GSP to its advantage by accelerating the pace of
domestic policy reforms directed towards increasing external competitiveness.

22. 
Quickening the tempo of policy reforms would enable Bangladesh to take advantage of favorable
external developments and raise its annual GDP growth to 6% or higher, with double digit manufacturing
growth (High Case, Table 3). These reforms would create the climate for raising the level of investment
from the present 22% of GDP to around 25% of GDP within the next three to five years. Having achieved
near 5% GDP growth in the past decade and having moved through progressive liberalization of the
economy and adoption of market-friendly policies, under a reformed policy environment, Bangladesh
should be able to attract sufficient foreign direct investment to finance the needed investment growth.
Attracting foreign investment will be important because the potential for increasing national saving from
its present 21% level appears rather limited, particularly because a disproportionate increase in private
consumption is necessary if growth is to be significantly poverty reducing.

5 The garment export industry has helped create 1.5 million jobs, of which 90% are taken by women.

Having demonstrated that it can sustain a current account deficit ranging between 2% to 3% of
GDP, Bangladesh should be able to continue to do so in the medium term. However, this performance
would require reversing the recent slippage in the central government deficit and domestic financing to
the average levels of less than 5% and 1.5% of GDP, respectively, achieved during FY90-98. Improved
quality of public expenditures, stronger revenue effort and a reduction in SOE losses should make this
turnaround possible.

II. THE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

A. GOVERNMENTVISION

24. 
Bangladesh's development planning envisions a substantial reduction in poverty
within a generation. The Fifth five-year Plan (1997-2002) embodies this vision and aims to achieve a
non-inflationary growth of over 7% per annum to realize it. The Government's Poverty Reduction
Partnership Agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and a paper presented to the
Development Forum in April 2000 further articulate its poverty reduction objectives and strategies. The
Government visualizes the numbers of the poor shrinking by roughly 2% a year until the end of this
decade and the following outcomes by 2010:

* 
a 50% decline in the number of people below the poverty line;
* universal primary education;
* 
reduction of maternal mortality rates by 75% and infant and 'under 5' mortality rates by 65%, and
the proportion of malnourished children 'under 5' by 40%; and
availability of reproductive health services to all women.

* 

25. 
The Government's strategy focuses on accelerating economic growth, ensuring basic
welfare and strengthening safety nets. Planning emphasizes policies to promote non-inflationary
economic growth and a greater private sector role, as well as increased expenditures on education,
nutrition, health and water and sanitation. To cover these outlays, the Government intends to improve
domestic resource mobilization, reduce the fiscal deficit and implement financial sector reforms. 
In
addition, it proposes to address growing income inequality through more effective targeting of social
expenditures and safety net programs that are among the largest in the world. Costing more than US$
300 million per annum, Bangladesh's targeted food transfers are relatively well targeted to the poor at the
household level. Nonetheless, considerable scope remains for improving the regional targeting of
benefits, as well as improving cost-effectiveness through streamlining operations and considering more
seriously the option of switching to monetized benefits.

26. 
The Government's strategy, though sound, is limited in scope. It focuses primarily
on promoting growth, giving 
less attention to the priorities, sequencing and
interrelationships among government programs and policies to maximize their poverty

8

reduction impact. It has neither fully articulated sector-specific priorities nor described a
comprehensive framework for reforms. The HIES and related poverty assessment work that the
Government proposes to undertake will address this gap by providing an empirical basis to link programs
and poverty outcomes. The strategy needs to be refined in order to address implementation issues, both
in terms of formulating policies and following a process that enables the Government to marshal the
resources, resolve and capacity to realize its vision.

27. 

Strong institutions and improved governance are requisites for accelerated
development. While acknowledging the need for good governance, the Government has been unable to
address pervasive corruption and institutional weaknesses effectively. The agenda is substantial. Besides
addressing the deteriorating law and order situation, tackling corruption in banking, power and customs
and tax administration are urgent priorities. Other areas of reform include local governments, the civil
service, public audit and accounting bodies, public procurement and the civil justice system. Targeted
policy interventions, decentralization, privatization of SOEs and vigorous public sector reform aimed at
providing incentives for increasing efficiency, accountability and transparency are key priorities in any
effort to reduce corruption and promote greater accountability and effectiveness in delivery of services to
communities, particularly to the poor.

Human Development

B. DEVELOPMENT PRIORMIIES

28. 

The impressive gains recorded in education in the past decade notwithstanding,
improving quality remains the principal challenge. Adult literacy rates rose from 25% in 1990 to
over 50% in 1998, as gross primary enrollment rates went from 76% in 1991 to 96% in 1999. Primary
dropout rates fell by a third - from nearly 60% in 1991 to 40% in 1998. These gains must be sustained to
achieve the goal of universal primary enrollment by 2010, even as new measures to extend access to the
secondary and higher levels of education are initiated. Despite growing access to education, the
large number of working and out-of-school children, currently constituting 12% of the
labor force, is a matter of concern. Although the Government has committed to abolishing child
labor, a concerted effort would be needed to find alternative income support for poor parents so that their
children could stop working and resume schooling. In parallel, steps to enhance the quality of learning
and revise curricula to equip students with marketable skills are required to create an educated
workforce. The unfinished agenda, therefore, includes formulation of a National Education Policy,
owned by all stakeholders. Besides directing future development, the new policy should acknowledge and
address the rampant politicization of students, teachers and administrators and the lack of transparency
and accountability of educators and administrators to their clients (i.e. parents and students.)

29. 
The 1990s saw marked improvements in life expectancy, immunization coverage
and fertility rate, among other health indicators. Maintaining these gains is essential to further
progress against tremendous remaining challenges: reducing the incidence of child malnutrition,
lowering infant and maternal mortality rates, controlling the population growth rate, reducing the
prevalence of endemic and infectious diseases and increasing access to safe water and sanitation. In
addition, new challenges have emerged that will require considerable attention and resources. Primary
among them is arsenic contamination of ground water, affecting at least 24 million people. To mitigate
the adverse health impacts of arsenic poisoning and to develop alternative, safe drinking-water supplies,
a concerted effort by the Government, local communities, donors and the private sector will be absolutely
critical. A second new challenge is to avert a potential HIV/AIDS epidemic by raising public awareness
and outreach to high-risk groups. Even though the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the country is still low
(less than two hundred HIV positive cases have been reported), the Government has initiated preemptive
actions with the help of donors including IDA.

30. 

Bangladesh has achieved remarkable progress in reducing gender discrimination in

education and at the work place. Rapid progress in increasing girls' enrollment in primary schools
and the increase in the female-to-male ratio in workforce participation to around the same level as in
western countries are notable successes. As increasing numbers of women have found jobs in the rapidly

9

expanding ready-made garment industry, their income-earning opportunities and participation in
household decision-making have both expanded. The awareness of the perceived high returns to
investments in girls' education has caused a shift in social attitudes towards the role of women in society.
Nonetheless, a serious concern remains the virtual inability of law enforcement and social practices to
prevent violence against women, the incidence of which is reportedly on the rise. As a signatory of the
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Government has committed to undertake affirmative
actions to remove legal, economic, political and cultural/social barriers that prevent women from
exercising equal rights. The process should be accelerated, given the centrality of women's empowerment
to poverty reduction in Bangladesh. The evidence shows that where women have access to education,
health, assets, and a voice in local decision making, the living standards of poor rural families have
improved significantly.

Rural Development

31. 
Since 80% of Bangladesh's population and 90% of the poor live in rural areas,
accelerated growth there and development of agriculture and non-farm economic
activities are crucial for achieving faster, sustainable poverty reduction. Nearly two million
rural workers enter the labor force each year, a large proportion of them going into foodgrain production,
an area of dramatic change, where output has nearly doubled over the last decade. A combination of
factors - good weather, efficient and timely distribution of inputs, expansion in rural credit and a
consistent shift towards high-yield seeds and technologies - is responsible for the growth in production.
The growth was generally limited to rice, in which Bangladesh attained self-sufficiency in the early 1990s.
During the second half of the 1990s agriculture stagnated due to a slowdown in the demand for rice
caused by low income elasticity of demand and lower population growth rates. Given the importance of
agriculture to poverty reduction, policies to spur crop diversification and non-farm production and better
water management are critical. Complementing such policies, steps to deregulate input and output
markets, improve rural infrastructure, enhance credit access and strengthen domestic/export marketing
and distribution channels are necessary to derive a greater poverty impact.

32. 
Effective management of water resources is a key priority. A new national water policy
has been recently formulated but not yet made operational. The main issues in the water sector are poor
institutional performance and lack of community-driven development models for water use. The
Government has recognized that these problems have to be addressed through restructuring of the key
water agencies, particularly the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), to improve their
efficiency and decentralize management of smaller water schemes to local water users' associations.
Progress in implementing these institutional reforms has so far been slow.

33. 
Investments in rural electrification, roads and micro-credit have yielded highly
satisfactory results. Nevertheless, rural access to electricity remains low at 10% (against 18%
nationwide), and a larger role for the private sector will have to be developed in order to move toward the
Government's extremely ambitious target of universal coverage by 2020. To catalyze growth of non-farm
activities and rural industry, continued investment to expand and maintain the rural road network is
important. Although the reach of micro-credit has benefited many poor families, the instrument needs to
be adapted to improve its effectiveness for the extreme poor and extended to micro-enterprises and to
small and marginal farmers to create more employment opportunities.

34. 
Protecting Bangladesh's rural population, especially 
the poor, from natural
disasters such as cyclones, storms and tidal surges, floods, arsenic contamination of water
and environmental degradation is critical to sustaining development outcomes. 
Improved
information and early warning systems have reduced public vulnerability to natural disasters, as
evidenced by the minimal loss of life during the 1998 floods. Nonetheless, ensuring the sustainability of
disaster mitigation efforts remains an important challenge. 
In this regard, the operation and
maintenance of defensive infrastructure like embankments, cyclone shelters and river training works is
critical. Also, the Government's disaster mitigation efforts increasingly emphasize greater participation
by affected communities and NGOs in operating and maintaining defensive infrastructure. Massive

10

arsenic contamination of groundwater has emerged as a new national challenge. The Government is
responding by developing community capacity to test wells on a continuous basis, finding alternative,
safe drinking-water sources and strengthening the public health system.

35. Environmental problems in Bangladesh range from widespread resource depletion
and ecological degradation, to urban and industrial pollution and natural disasters. These
environmental problems are linked to poverty in three distinct ways: by reducing people's livelihood, by
affecting their health, and by increasing their vulnerability to the destructive impact of natural disasters.
Natural resource degradation affects the livelihood of nearly half the rural poor by reducing yields of
agricultural, fisheries, and timber and non-timber forestry products. The public health impacts of
pollution -- including dirty and arsenic-laced water, lack of sanitation, and urban and indoor air pollution
-- account for nearly 20% of all illness and death. Over the past 30 years, Bangladesh has suffered 25% of
all disaster-related damages in South Asia, the most disaster-prone region in the world. The country is
also particularly vulnerable to the projected impact of flooding, increased cyclones, and sea level rise
being brought about by global climate change. Progress in addressing these environment-related issues
has been generally slow. Some successful steps have, however, been taken with regard to air pollution in
Dhaka, industrial standards, cyclone early warning systems, and localized ecosystem management where
there is both adequate research and local participation. Nonetheless, addressing environmental concerns
is essentially a governance issue - not a financial one - and Bangladesh's environmental problems are
likely to worsen without improved information, policy reform and public sector accountability.

Private Sector Development

36. 
Sustained private sector-led growth is essential to accelerating poverty reduction in
Bangladesh. To nurture such development, Bangladesh will need to foster a stronger, more competitive
domestic private sector, expand the capacity of its infrastructure (especially power, telecommunications,
roads and ports) and strengthen domestic financial markets. In addition, the Government has to step up
its efforts to improve the environment for foreign investment, raise the quality of the labor force and
reduce the costs of doing business by reforming the legal and judicial system, increasing public
transparency and arresting the deterioration in law and order.

37. 
Increased private participation is needed to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks. The
inability of publicly managed infrastructure utilities to generate adequate revenue for maintenance, let
alone for new investments, has led to energy consumption, telecommunication and road penetration
rates that are among the lowest in the world. The inefficiency of Chittagong port, the country's main port,
costs the economy close to a billion dollars a year. Furthermore, the public utilities' poor management
has resulted in large financial losses that add to the fiscal burden. In the power sector, for example, only
18% of the population have access and shortages and unreliable supply are the norm. Power shortages
are estimated to cost a billion dollars in lost industrial output a year, while the two major power utilities
post annual financial losses in excess of US$100 miMion. The utilities' huge financial losses subsidize a
narrow section of the population that, in many instances, does not even pay its power bils and thereby
perpetuates the cycle of corruption and poor management. The underlying causes go back to the vicious
cycle of vested interests -
in this case, sections of the trade unions, management and businesses - that
block reforms and blunt the political will to bring about changes in the status-quo. 
In these
circumstances, the need is compelling to promote the private provision of infrastructure services, initially
and crucially through government actions to open markets with appropriate regulation and to reform the
SOEs' roles in these sectors.

38. 
Foreign direct investments are needed to develop gas production. Bangladesh has had
some success in attracting foreign investors to the gas sector, but progress in implementation has been
hampered by the continuing involvement of Petrobangla. Prospects for further investment depend on the
Government's willingness to allow gas exports without which the limited domestic market demand wil
hold back exploration and production.

39. 
The financial sector requires reform and institutional strengthening to meet the
needs of private business. Poor people's good repayment records under micro-credit programs
contrast sharply with the slow progress being made in recovering the massive amount of bad debt in the
banking system. During the late 1990s the Government began to take steps to attack the default culture
by introducing new courts responsible for debt recovery, by tightening loan classification and
provisioning requirements and by restricting defaulters' access to credit. The private commercial banks
have begun to respond, and the proportion of classified loans in their portfolios has been reduced from
40% in 1995 to about 27% in 1999. In contrast, the NCBs' performance deteriorated somewhat over this
period; non-performing loans still account for over 50% of NCB portfolios.

40. 
Unless the poor performance of the NCBs, which hold over half of banking assets, is reversed, and
the private banks' promising trend of improving performance is sustained, lack of credit from the banking
sector will continue to hinder private sector-led growth. The NCBs' drag on the banking system could be
reduced by the introduction of professional management, real autonomy and, eventually, privatization.
In addition, a healthy and well-functioning banking sector would depend on the central bank's autonomy
and capacity to regulate and supervise the entire banking system effectively, as well as on a better
functioning legal system. Beyond commercial banks, domestic capital markets are limited in depth and
range of services. Regulatory reforms are required to encourage the development of new markets, and
the entry of new institutions.

Aid Effectiveness

41. 
Consistent with global trends, aid flows to Bangladesh have been declining.
Bangladesh still depends on development assistance to finance about half of its development needs
(Chart 2). Since aid will continue to play an important role in the future, its efficient management is a
major concern. Aid flows have declined due to a combination of factors -
lowered availability of donor
assistance worldwide, growth in private financial flows and Bangladesh's reduced access due to
inadequate policy performance, absorptive capacity and linkage with policies, consensus on which takes
considerable time to be reached between the Government and donors. Therefore, the Government has to
manage aid more effectively by playing a stronger leadership role in managing assistance programs. In
addition to assuming greater ownership, the Government has to address the weak policy and institutional
framework in which projects are implemented.

III. PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

A. FORMULATING THE STRATEGY

42. Continuing the focus of its FY98 precursor, this CAS emphasizes institution building
since the underlying systemic conditions in the country have not changed substantially. To increase the
impact on poverty, however, 
this CAS proposes a realignment of priorities, based on learning,
consultations with stakeholders and the increased potential for strategic partnerships. The
strategic priorities of the CAS are aligned with the Government's development vision described earlier.

Learning

43. 
In line with the OED's 1998 Bangladesh Country Assistance Review, the last CAS explicitly
recognized the importance of supporting institutional development. The Bank's recent
(FY00) Bangladesh Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) also highlighted the long-term nature of
engagement required from the Bank Group and other development partners to tackle institutional
reforms. Any near to medium-term successes are likely to be small because building sustainable
institutions requires a major overhaul of the public sector, while resistance from vested interests limits
progress. Strengthening partnerships and building ownership of reforms are therefore critical.
What worked:

44. 
The Bangladesh IGR proposes that lessons for future IDA-financed operations should be drawn
from the gains in capacity building during the past decade. Prominent among the success stories are the
PKSF (a financial intermediary for micro-credit) and the Rural Electrification Board. These 'islands of
excellence' in the micro-finance and electricity sectors share common attributes (listed below) that are
consistent with CDF principles and point to useful lessons for replication in other sectors. The operating
principles include:

* project objectives that are aligned with demands of the community at the grassroots level;
* 
implementation by autonomous agencies that follow a community-based or cooperative model
accountable for achieving community-owned development solutions;
* 
financial discipline and accountability;
* visible political commitment together with strong championship in the civil service;
* home-grown project designs, suitably tested in pilots and scaled up nationwide; and
* partnerships among donors, government and NGOs.

What did not work:

45. 
The July 1999 CAS progress report indicated limited progress on policy and
structural reforms in key sectors such as banking, power and public administration. This outcome
has been attributed to several factors:

* Despite a widely acclaimed report on "Government That Works" and the attention given to
institutional issues in the last CAS, little tangible progress has marked public sector reforms. More
innovative dissemination of report findings is needed to build public awareness and support for
governance reforms.
* Weak government commitment to address difficult issues limited the impact of development
assistance programs, particularly in areas where donors were unable to coordinate effectively.
* Projects requiring complex institutional reforms and coordination across many public agencies
proved very difficult to implement, and several of them became problem projects.
* Uneven quality and inconsistent involvement of the Government in the preparation of several major
analytical reports, such as the Rural Development and Energy Sector Strategies, reduced their
effectiveness in convincing the Government to adopt the recommended changes.
IFC has had limited success in supporting private investment in Bangladesh. Many investment
opportunities, particularly in the power, gas and financial sectors have not been realized due to the

* 

13

poor policy environment. The large proportion of approved IFC funds that have not been committed
evidences this.

CAS Consultations

46. 
In preparation for the CAS, the country team comprising IDA and IFC staff carried out extensive
in-country consultations during January-June 2000, meeting with Government, civil society
representatives and various stakeholders, including villagers and urban slum dwellers. Feedback from
these consultations added to the knowledge base of analytical work and past consultations undertaken by
the Bank and other institutions, providing a grassroots "reality check" on Bangladesh's development
priorities.

47. 
The consultations took place in several urban, semi-urban and rural locations outside Dhaka. The
methodology and findings of the consultations are described in Attachment 1. The overriding, across-
the-board concern centered on the extremely high costs that poor governance, especially
corruption and a decline in law and order, and weak institutions exact from individuals
and the private sector. Participants also identified economic growth and job creation, gender equity,
rural development, safe water and sanitation, better quality health and education services and the arsenic
contamination crisis as priorities for the development agenda. Toward the end of the consultations,
feedback from participants validated the preliminary CAS framework proposed by the Bank Group to
address widely perceived development priorities. Participants expressed a strong desire to continue
engaging the Bank Group in dialogue on the country's development agenda. They were informed that the
Bank Group would be working in partnership with other donors within the CAS framework to meet the
concerns expressed during the earlier consultations.

14

Box 3: What was heard at the CAS consultations....

1. Participants in the CAS consultations indicated that they are proud of the gains made by their country in recent years.

"The Jamuna Bridge is a milestone in ourprogress."
-- Village representative near Sylhet
Primary health care andfamily planning is improving.'
- City of Rajshahi representative
"Women's leadership is increasing in both politics and economic areas."
-- City of Chittagong representative

2. These achievements notwithstanding, concern was expressed about the many challenges that remain. These fall into three
broad areas:

(i) Institutions and Governance: The predominant theme across all groups was Bangladesh's ineffective and inefficient
institutions. In particular, the conflict between political parties, an ineffective Parliament, a public bureaucracy that does not
serve the people well, corruption and the deterioration in law and order, were concerns.

'The hidden costs of doing business are hurting our aility to make profits in every area."
-- Dhaka businessman
"Law and order is decreasing, especially there is rise in violent crimes."
-- City of Sylhet representative
"We sleep with our belongings packed - we never know ifsomeone will come and demolish the

slum."

-- Dhaka urban poor representative
"We need more effective dialogue among the political parties."
-- NGO leader

(ii) Employment and Economic Growth: Both urban and rural groups spoke about the lack of jobs and the critical roles
that improved infrastructure, particularly power and telecommunications, and skilled human capital could play in creating
economic opportunities.

'Roads, ports, telecommunications and Internet connections require much more attention."
-- Govermment Secretary
'Both literate and illiterate people can'tfindjobs."
-- Villager near Sylhet
"Our investment in technology is weak and we don't have well-trained managers.'
Dhaka businessman

(iii) Basic Needs: A common refrain stressed that despite considerable progress and improvements in social indicators,
more progress in the area of Basic Needs is required. While access to basic education and health care had improved, many
groups talked about the need for improving quality and suggested that better data collection and performance monitoring of
social services should be undertaken, particularly in basic education and health.

"More children are in school, but the quality is not good."
-- Villager near Rajshahi
'In our haste to cover a lot of people in a short time, we have sacrificed quality."
-- Government Secretary
"Water, electricity and sanitationfacilities are inadequate."
-- Dhaka urban poor representative
"We need the help of donors, NGOs, the Government and everyone to solve the arsenic problem."
-- Villager near Sylhet

Partnerships

48. 
Bangladesh's 
large and active donor community, reflecting 
the country's
tremendous development needs, is expected to continue to provide significant external
assistance. As indicated in Table 4, during the past three years (i.e. FY 98-00), resources (i.e.
commitments) equivalent to 50% or more of the ADP came from donors, of whom IDA, ADB and Japan
were the largest. Major investments took place in the agriculture, rural development, water resources
management, water supply and transport sectors. Although the ADB and Japan have been the primary
donors for power, and IDA and the United Kingdom, the lead donors in health, a large number of
bilateral donors - Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Swiss Development Corporation (SDC) - are also active in

15

many sectors. The financing shares of the largest donors have not changed significantly over the past
three years; the ADB, IDA and Japan have provided on average, 11%, 10% and 4%, respectively, of ADP
resources. Since the ADB, Japan and other bilateral donors are providing significant support to the ADP,
IDA will be able to be more selective in its interventions in accordance with its comparative advantage
and strategic CAS priorities.

indicates some donor financing in the sector.

49. 
In areas where donors have established strong partnerships, pooled resources and
expertise have strengthened the positive impact of aid. Examples of successful partnerships
abound. 
IDA and several bilateral donors including the Department for International Development,
United Kingdom (DFID) and CIDA, share a common approach on micro-finance, which enables them to
coordinate the provision of resources for credit, technical assistance and institutional strengthening.
Collaboration between the ADB and the Bank Group has been and will continue to be strategically
important for engaging the Government in the power and financial sectors. Continued adoption of a
common stand by these two partners on structural reforms is critical for convincing the Government that
unless reforms are undertaken, sector performance will not improve.

50. Partnerships on governance are gaining momentum. IDA's efforts to strengthen public
sector management and amplify the "voice" of civic society in demanding better governance are
complemented by the work being undertaken by UNDP, Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA) and DFID on decentralization, local capacity building and law enforcement. A consortium of
donors led by IDA is pooling resources and expertise to support a sector-wide health and population
program fully owned by the Government. More can be done to align support effectively in other areas in
a manner similar to the experience in the health sector. The absence of such an approach in primary
education has been an impediment to achieving intended outcomes despite the inputs of numerous
donors including ADB, Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), Gesellsehaft fur Technische
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), UNICEF and IDA. The challenge ahead is for donors and the Government to
seek ways of applying the sector-wide programmatic approach more broadly.

16

51. 

Partnerships with non-government stakeholders in Bangladesh are essential for
consensus building on reforms to improve the quality of policies and institutions, a key
determinant of aid effectiveness. While it is unlikely that the Government will implement any bold
measures before elections, the period following elections could offer a window of opportunity for
accelerating reforms. Among the several positive forces at work that could facilitate a period of faster
reform are:

* 
* 
* 

an increasingly proactive Supreme Court
the NGOs' continuing growth and activism
emergence of a young generation of entrepreneurs with social conscience, who increasingly demand a
more supportive and ethical business environment
* growth of independent research organizations
* 
rapid expansion in basic education
* 
a thriving and increasingly independent press
* 
change agents within government who can catalyze reform
* public discontent with inadequate provision of services by public agencies

Over time and with support, these interest groups are expected to become increasingly vocal in
demanding reforms and better performance from the Government. Donor support to these forces of
change (e.g. for capacity building) could make an important contribution to increasing aid effectiveness.

Box 4: Partnerships in the Health, Nutrition and Population Sector

• 

IDA's strong partnerships with donors and NGOs in supporting the Govermment's HNP program have produced some
remarkable outcomes.
* The IDA-led Bangladesh Health and Population Consortium has been financing the sector since 1975. It started with
Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom joining the Bank in supporting a population project.
The number of donors and scope of activities have since expanded to cover all the donors financing the sector through a
single sector-wide program. Donor financing has increased several fold from $45 million then to $1 billion for the
present five-year program. Bangladesh's fertility decline and immunization program are international success stories.
Currently, extensive policy and institutional reform is being implemented to improve the health of the poor. The multi-
donor partnership has enabled a large amount of resources to be focused on key issues including how to achieve more
balanced development in the sector and more efficient aid management
IDA-supported Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project has developed nutrition interventions that have significantly
reduced malnutrition in the project area. The success is owed to effective partnerships among the Government, BRAC,
UNICEF and IDA. While IDA led the process, UNICEF provided strong technical support to project preparation and
BRAC contributed lessons from its in-country experience. This resulted in the development of a project known for its
technical soundness. The partnership has continued and grown with BRAC participating in project implementation, and
UNICEF in project supervision. The Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition project model will now be replicated nationwide
through the National Nutrition Program that will be launched in December 2000.
* The Government has initiated actions to address HIV/AIDS before it becomes an epidemic in Bangladesh. In preparing
an HIV/AIDS project to be financed by IDA, the Government collaborated with UNAIDS and other NGOs including
CONCERN, CARE and VHSS. While the NGOs' experience in working with high-risk groups was critical for defining the
project's main thrust, UNAIDS has contributed valuable technical assistance during project preparation. Although the
implementation of the project will not begin until early 2001, the partnerships have created the momentum for the
Government to begin training 65,000 HIV/AIDS field workers.

52. 
Improving the Government's management of aid and more effective donor
coordination will both be necessary to facilitate and generate more opportunities for
strategic partnerships among donors, the Government and civil society. The Government has
little involvement in the activities of the Local Consultative Group (LCG), the primary mechanism for in-
country donor coordination. Consequently, the LCG's function has been limited to information exchange,
with few instances of effective alignment, and the LCG, to remedy the situation, has begun to engage the
Government in restructuring the Government-donor relationship based on CDF principles. The LCG has
conducted a review of its objectives and organization and concluded that it should include the
Government more systematically in its deliberations and find mechanisms to increase Government
ownership. The Government will intensify its dialogue with the LCG to seek greater convergence of views
on key thematic areas - such as development assistance issues, regulatory reform and governance -
to
underpin donor support for Government-led development assistance programs.

17

53. 
It is generally agreed that the current piecemeal approach to institution building,
the proliferation of donor-supported project management units and varying
administrative procedures, particularly for procurement and disbursement, are not
working well and strain the Government's capacity. In parallel, and following up on the concerns
raised at the Bangladesh Development Forum in April 2000, IDA has taken the lead in engaging the
Government to identify ways to harmonize the aid policies of donors with the country's development
needs. Among the proposals being considered is a broader application of successful partnership
approaches such as those used in the Health, Nutrition and Population sector (see Box 4).

B. OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

54. 
The CAS's overarching objective is to help Bangladesh realize its aspiration of
reducing poverty substantially within one generation. In line with this aim, the Bank Group will
support poverty reduction by focusing on the three most powerful lines of attack against poverty:

* 

* 

consolidating gains in human development and supporting initiatives to address the next
generation of development challenges in education, health and nutrition;

implementing an integrated approach to rural development, including supporting growth in
agriculture and non-farm activities, making opportunities and assets available to the poor, improving
rural infrastructure and strengthening local institutions; and

* accelerating and broadening private sector-led growth by supporting governmental efforts
to remove structural impediments and establish a conducive environment for private investment
(primarily IDA); by strengthening the financial sector (IDA and IFC) and supporting private
investments in energy, infrastructure, manufacturing and services (IFC and MIGA).

The crosscutting issues of institutional capacity building, governance, macro-economic
stability, social concerns such as gender equity and empowerment and environmental
protection will be treated as integral elements within these strategic objectives.

55. An important element of the CAS wiUl be collaboration with ADB, IMF and other
donors to help the Government sharpen the design and improve the implementation of its
comprehensive anti-poverty strategy. Assistance will take the form of knowledge transfer in
developing analytical and monitoring tools to track poverty indicators and disseminating global best
practices on determinants of poverty and anti-poverty policies. Support may also be provided for
consultations on the strategy.

56. 
From a strategic perspective, IDA's involvement would be selective, based on exploiting
comparative advantages and performance-based lending. 
In supporting improvements in
policies, institutions and governance, the Bank Group wil engage the Government and other
stakeholders through analysis and dialogue in areas critical to growth even if reforms
continue to be slow, but provide financial assistance only when the pace of reform picks up.
Examples would be banking, power and water resource management, where the Bank Group would
increase engagement if and as the Government tackles underlying governance and other structural issues
and achieves progress in implementing agreed policy reforms. IDA would not seek involvement in areas
where the other donors or the private sector have a long history of engagement and/or comparative
advantage. Examples include in building law-enforcement capacity (DANIDA and DFID), urban health
services (ADB and USAID), technical education/vocational training, gas exploration and production
(private sector).

57. 
In delivering assistance in areas where IDA is selectively involved, the strategy
proposes community-driven approaches, private sector-led solutions and partnerships.
Both donors and the Government recognize NGOs' strength in delivering social services in health,
education and rural development and the record of excellent performance by community-based

18

organizations in rural infrastructure and micro-credit. The relevant strategy, therefore, will seek to
promote and scale up such NG0-led and community-driven development models. These models would
also take into account, the importance of resource transfer to regions with the highest poverty incidence.
IDA will focus primarily on policy, institutional and structural reforms to promote private participation in
the financial sector, infrastructure and gas production, with IFC and MIGA facilitating the financing of
private investments. The strategy will emphasize forging partnerships with donors to tap existing and
emerging comparative advantages and achieve synergies. The successful approach of the Health and
Population Sector Program, for example, would be more broadly applied and adopted in the power sector
(ADB, USAID and JBIC), gas (ADB and USAID), finance/banking (IMF and ADB) and education (several
bilateral donors).

58. 
The CAS will be adapted to Bangladesh's political cycle. General elections are due around
mid-2001. The CAS will therefore coincide with the pre-election period and the new Government's initial
years. As little progress is expected on reforms during the pre-election period, non-lending services (i.e.
analytical services, formulation of sector strategies, dialogue and consultation on reforms) will take on
added prominence in FY01. The strategy will be flexible, stepping up engagement and financial
assistance to respond to the possibility of a more reformist stance in FY02-03 or maintaining a minimum
level of engagement and addressing core poverty needs if reforms are not forthcoming.

Assistance Program

C. IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY

59. 

The Bank Group's proposed assistance program has been designed to support the strategic areas

and crosscutting themes described above. Key components of the proposed Base Case program are
summarized in Table 5. Instruments will include a balanced mix of non-lending and lending

interventions. Substantial non-lending activities are proposed to expand on and update the rich

analytical work already done, with a view to further improving the quality of the policy dialogue,
enhancing the impact of the Bank Group's lending interventions, and building consensus on reforms. In

respect of lending interventions, financial support would be provided through IDA technical assistance
and investment credits, Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs), IDA guarantees, IFC equity investments
and loans and MIGA guarantees. Contingent on the policy environment and client needs, adjustment
operations (e.g. Poverty Reduction Support Credit, lending in support of structural reforms in strategic
sectors such as finance/banking and power) would be considered.

i. Due Diligence Economic and Sector Work

60. A key element of the Bank Group's Economic and Sector Work program during FYO1-02 is
assistance to the Government in preparing its PRSP, a process already initiated and expected to be
completed by the end of 2001. Selected analytical and advisory services will be provided in consultation
and collaboration with the IMF and ADB. 
In addition, a public expenditure review (PER), a poverty
assessment (PA) and an analysis of safety net programs are planned as inputs into the Government's
PRSP. The last PER and PA were completed in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Preparation of the new PER
and PA has started, and the findings will be available to the new Government in mid-2001. 
In the past
few years, annual reports equivalent to traditional Country Economic Memoranda have been prepared for
the Bangladesh Development Fora. The last, "Challenges for the New Millennium," was delivered in April
1999. Bangladesh was one of the pilot countries to carry out IGRs. The Bangladesh IGR has been
submitted to the Government, and its findings are being disseminated during FYo1. A Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was completed in FYoo while the first Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) is underway with completion of the report expected in March 2001.
In addition to these institutional/fiduciary assessments, the Bank Group is undertaking a rich program of
diagnostic work on governance and public sector accountability/anti-corruption that will feed directly
into a Communication for Reform Initiative to build public awareness on and support for reforms.

ii. Strengthening Governance

61. 
IDA's objective is to create a powerful nexus for positive movement toward stronger, accountable
institutions, improved governance and a greater voice for the people. Development partners in this
regard include the Australian Agency for International Development (AUSAID), CIDA, DANIDA, UNDP
and USAID.7 The specific areas of engagement on governance are:

* Support interventions to strengthen civic society's voice in demanding reforms. IDA would support
analytical work and effective dissemination of the findings that will enable more informed public

6 Lending in this category is dependent on demonstrable progress on reforms. In addition to the projects shown in the FY02-03
program, several other standby operations - Central Bank TA, Health & Population Sector Program II, Power Reform II (Dispatch &
Transmission), Power Sector TA, and Local Government Support - could be considered for IDA support contingent on reform
progress in these sectors. They are candidates for replacing any of the operations in the regular program that may be delayed due to
unforeseen circumstances.
7 A coalition for positive change called the 'Bangladesh Initiative for Good Governance' and consisting of donors, NGOs and civil
society stakeholders (e.g. Transparency International, Bangladesh), has emerged. The alliance is sponsoring several dissemination
activities.

20

debate on governance issues, greater outreach to civil society groups and other stakeholders, as well
as local capacity building for developing 'citizens' scorecards' to monitor public sector performance.

• 

Promote public sector reforms to improve the quality of the civil service and the efficiency and
accountability of public administration. 
IDA in partnership with DFID and UNDP will provide
technical assistance through a proposed Public Sector Modernization Project. The project would
support strengthening of parliamentary oversight committees and the Auditor General's Office,
upgrading financial and management accounting systems and reforming procurement procedures.
These project components are based on the recommendations of the FYo0 CFAA and the FYOO CPAR.

* Assist in legal and judicial reform. The Legal and Judicial Capacity Building Project (FY01) will
support reform and strengthening of the civil justice system to enable it to perform more efficiently
and fairly.

* Promote decentralization and local capacity building. IDA will support analytical work to underpin
advocacy on decentralization and will finance pilot operations to develop replicable models of local
governance (Local Government Support project). The emphasis will be on capacity building and
fostering partnerships among local governments, community-based organizations and NGOs. IDA
would complement UNDP's ongoing efforts in the area of local capacity building.

* 

IFC investments will provide models for new ways of doing business with strong, transparent
corporate governance, high social and environmental standards and orientation to international
competitiveness rather than domestic protection. The growth of businesses of this type will also
strengthen the domestic constituency for economic reform and improved governance.

iii. Addressing Social and Environmental Issues

62. 
In partnership with other donors, IDA will support implementation of the government's social
development agenda. These activities include:

* 

* 

Identification of performance indicators for gender outcomes and capacity building of project staff to
undertake gender analysis.

Incorporation of gender and social inclusion concerns into the Group's assistance program, and
knowledge sharing and capacity building for research and policy formulation related to social
development.

* Advocacy on the importance of achieving national targets for elimination of child labor. In addition,
rehabilitation of minors forced to work in the commercial sex industry will be an objective of the
proposed HIV/AIDS prevention project.

63. 
IDA would continue to ensure effective implementation of safeguard policies and address
environmental concerns during project preparation. In addition, IDA has assumed chairmanship of the
local consultative group on environment and is endeavoring to focus donor and government priorities on
those environmental problems with the greatest poverty impacts. IDA will:

* Support alleviation of air pollution through the recently approved Air Quality Management LIL.

* Execute a UNDP-funded component of the Sustainable Environmental Management Program
(SEMP), emphasizing improved information, legal systems, monitoring and compliance, and public
disclosure in pollution control and environmental management.

* Promote better environmental assessment procedures across all Government line agencies for donor-
as well as private sector-financed investments.

21

* 

Implement the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP)-funded advocacy program
for reducing vehicle emissions.

iv. Sustaining Human Development Gains

64. 
The Bank has sought to help Bangladesh improve the health of its people by supporting important
investments in education, water supply and sanitation, and health. IDA's aim in the health sector has
been to help Bangladesh reduce fertility, infant and maternal mortality and the burden of health
conditions, such as malnutrition, that affect the poor the most. IDA has also sought to assist the
Government in strengthening the coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of its health system. Consistent
with this focus, the Bank has helped Bangladesh formulate a sector-wide approach to health sector
development -
the five-year, three billion-dollar Health and Population Sector Program (HPSP) - of
which about one-third is being financed by the Bank and a number of other partners (see Box 4).
Continued support to the HPSP through a follow-up operation is envisaged if satisfactory progress on
reforms is achieved under the ongoing operation. Other health-related activities are:

• 

Co-financing the National Nutrition Program with the Netherlands and CIDA, an undertaking being
implemented with significant NGO participation (BRAC) and with technical support from UNICEF.

* Helping Bangladesh establish effective capacity to prevent an HIV/AIDS epidemic through the
implementation of a new HIV/AIDS project in association with UNAIDS and such NGOs as
CONCERN, CARE and VHSS.

* Assisting in arsenic mitigation in close conjunction with UNICEF and bilateral donors such as SDC.

* Promoting a dialogue on health financing reform, contributing through analytical and advisory work
toward the establishment of a more coherent and sustainable health system.

* 

IFC will consider investments in private health facilities.

65. 
IDA and other donors would continue advocacy and support for improving access to and the
quality and efficiency of primary education and for achieving gender parity at the secondary level. IDA
along with its development partners--NORAD, GTZ, UNICEF, ADB, SDC and DFID-will continue to
support the following initiatives:

* Disseminating analytical work on improving the quality, efficiency, management and governance of
the education system and facilitating debate and public support for education reform.

* 

Implementing the Primary Education Development Project more effectively to achieve intended
outcomes.

* Supporting post-literacy and continuing education designed to expand coverage and quality of non-
formal education (Post-Literacy and Continuing Education project).

* Building on the gains made in gender equity at the post-primary education level through follow-up
support for the Female Secondary School Assistance Program to improve program design, targeting
and outreach.

* 

IFC will consider investments in private education and training services.

IDA and other donors would consider additional financial support if the Government were to undertake
medium-term reforms to modernize higher education and vocational training and make it more market-
oriented. As noted in the Bank's recently completed review of Bangladesh's educational system, public
provision of these services is at present inefficient, inflexible, inequitable and not designed to meet the
needs of a modernizing economy. Reforms, such as giving the institutions more autonomy, targeting

22

subsidies to the truly needy and aligning public provision with private initiatives, would go a long way
towards addressing these shortcomings.

v. An Integrated Approach to Rural Development

66. 
The goal of sustained rural development would be served by linking future investments to key
reforms in agriculture, the non-farm sector and governance. In addition to reforms, investments in
essential rural infrastructure and disaster mitigation will be necessary. To ensure meeting the needs of
poor communities, highly participatory approaches would strengthen the linkages between investments
and poverty reduction. Within this framework, the Bank Group's assistance program would consist of the
following activities:

* Scaling up micro-credit to increase access by the poor and to reach such new groups as micro-
enterprises and small and marginal farmers (Micro-credit II project and Rural Credit LIL) and
establishing a social investment fund to finance community-based infrastructure (Social Investment
Program project). A central feature of these initiatives would be collaboration with NGOs such as
PROSHIKA and BRAC and with donors (DFID, CIDA).

* Using data from the 2000-01 HIES to examine the targeting effectiveness of the food assistance
safety nets. Findings would provide the basis for recommendations on improving regional benefit
targeting and on the potential use of cash transfers to improve food consumption and nutrition.

* 

* 

Improving rural infrastructure such as grid and off-grid electrification and roads (Rural
Electrification and Rural Infrastructure Improvement projects). 
IDA, together with the GEF and
USAID, would support the Government's strategy to increase electricity penetration in the rural areas
through multiple providers, expanding cooperatives in grid and off-grid areas and introducing
renewable energy and local private sector systems in remote areas. In parallel, IFC and IDA are
developing pilot schemes that would demonstrate the feasibility of private sector participation in
rural electricity. The community-driven approach that has performed successfully under the Rural
Roads and Markets Improvement project (co-financed by SDC) will continue to be used.

In partnership with the FAO and several bilateral donors, support implementation of the recently
approved National Water Policy. This would include assistance for the formulation of the National
Water Management Plan to address institutional reform in key institutions like the BWDB, promote
decentralized, participatory and multi-sectoral approaches to water resources management and
improve the effectiveness and sustainability of irrigation programs. The vehicles for such support
would be the proposed Water Sector Investment project and the Gorai River Restoration project.

* Support the Government's disaster mitigation efforts by emphasizing greater participation of affected
communities 
in achieving better preparedness and in operating and maintaining defensive
infrastructure. 
IDA will consider financing infrastructure for cyclone and riverbank protection and
natural resources management projects if satisfactory progress is made in implementing fundamental
institutional reforms in the water sector (Coastal Zone Management project).

* 

IDA will strengthen its collaborative efforts with bilateral donors, NGOs and communities to assist
the Government in the arsenic mitigation effort. A follow up operation to the ongoing Arsenic
Mitigation project is envisaged, going beyond assistance for testing tube wells and screening affected
populations to finding community-based solutions for alternative sources of safe drinking water and
improved rural sanitation (Water and Sanitation Sector Improvement project).

vi. Accelerating Private Sector-led Growth

67. 
IDA will support government efforts to maintain macro-economic stability and implement
structural reforms to improve the environment for private sector-led growth. In parallel, IFC and MIGA

23

will support private investment through equity, loans and political risk insurance. The specific areas of
support include:

* 

* 

IFC will make direct investments in companies that have strong growth prospects and can compete in
open markets without special treatment from government. Support for SME development would be
provided through a Project Development Facility.

IDA will continue to collaborate with the IMF and ADB in providing advice on financial sector
reform, the banking system in particular. IDA technical assistance to strengthen Bangladesh Bank's
capacity will depend on reforms to extend the central bank's authority for prudential supervision and
to rationalize its staffing (Central Bank TA project). 
IDA would consider substantial adjustment
assistance if the Government were to adopt a more comprehensive banking reform program,
including measures to move toward privatization of the NCBs. 
IFC will focus on building strong
domestic commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions to expand the range of services and
depth of markets, especially to meet SMEs' needs. 
Since market development depends on
appropriate regulatory frameworks, IFC will work closely with IDA to promote necessary regulatory
and legal reforms.

68. 
IDA's dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders in the energy and infrastructure
sectors is intended to promote improved regulation, the private provision of services and privatization of
poorly managed state assets. IFC investments will aim to increase the availability of telecommunications,
power, water and transportation services to businesses and consumers. These investments will be closely
coordinated with IDA policy dialogue and technical assistance on sector reforms. Specific activities
include:

* 

In collaboration with the World Bank Institute and ADB, IDA is promoting initiatives to build
consensus on policy reform and legislative action in the power sector. 8
IDA and ADB would be
willing to support a multi-year program (Power Sector TA and Power Reform II projects) if the
government initiates actions consistent with the Government's Power Sector Policy announced in
January 2000. 
IFC is exploring further involvement in both national and rural private power
investments, following its successful participation in two power generation projects. IFC and MIGA
would have an important role to play in financing or guaranteeing future projects if the policy and
institutional environment improves.

* To promote dialogue on and support for reforms to remove constraints to private sector involvement
in infrastructure, IDA and IFC will engage key stakeholders through a highly participatory process of
preparing a country framework paper on private provision of infrastructure.

* Contingent on commitment to urban governance reforms, IDA will support an Urban Services project
in Khulna to privatize the city's water and sanitation services and improve the living conditions of
slum dwellers. The pilot studies underpinning this operation are financed by SDC.

* 

IFC will consider further investment in cellular telephones if the Government undertakes regulatory
and policy actions to make the telecommunications sector more competitive.

* The Government is negotiating a private container port project that could be financed by IFC as well
as by the IDA-supported infrastructure development fund (ongoing Private Sector Infrastructure
Development project).

* To promote gas sector development and possible gas exports, IDA will continue to collaborate with
other donors such as ADB and USAID to provide analytical, advocacy and advisory services. 
IFC
would support investments in gas production and transportation, subject to progress on reforms.

8A successful 3-day workshop was organized in September 2000 in which over 150 stakeholders drawn from government, the
power industry, various utilities and trade unions participated. This initiative has promoted greater understanding of and support
for reforms.

24

Portfolio Management

69. 
As of November 2, 2000, the Bangladesh IDA portfolio comprised 26 operations (25 credits and
one GEF operation) and one partial risk guarantee, with a total IDA net commitment of US$2,509
million, of which US$1,111 million (44%) was disbursed. Overall portfolio performance has been below
average. The percentage of projects evaluated by OED as having unsatisfactory outcomes has remained
persistently high at about 19% during the past five fiscal years. Efficiency is also below Bank averages in
terms of project completion and supervision costs. Presently four projects (17.5% of net commitments)
are at risk.

70. 
IDA has learned important lessons in recent years and has increased emphasis on ownership,
beneficiary participation in decision-making and greater involvement of the private sector, NGOs and
local governments in project implementation. More attention is being paid to sustainability issues,
including recurrent expenditure requirements for operations and maintenance, cost recovery and policy
reforms. As a result, the FY 98-00 period saw a continuation of support for primary education and
primary health care, and a shift in IDA lending away from Government-led infrastructure projects to
community-based, demand-driven and poverty-focused interventions (box 5).

Box 5: Poverty-focused Interventions

Rural Electrification: Nearly 90% of Bangladesh's rural population, mostly poor, do not have access to electricity. By
expanding electricity access opportunities, the proposed Rural Electrification project (FY02) seeks to increase opportunities
for economic growth and social well being for this target group. Following previous successful IDA project support, the new
operation will not only build on the past success of rural cooperatives, but also go beyond conventional grid-based electricity
provision. It proposes to expand the menu of provision options by supporting low-cost decentralized and dispersed off-grid
systems and renewable energy like solar home systems. The project would also seek to involve the rural private sector,
community-based organizations and NGOs.
Micro-credit II: Findings of an impact study show that micro-credit in Bangladesh has been an effective tool in mitigating
poverty among the rural poor, especially women, leading to increased incomes and asset accumulation, improved
acceptance of health, education and sanitation faclities, enhanced mobility and efficient use of time. The first IDA-financed
micro-finance project (1996), has helped to scale-up the industry's operations and increase outreach at a time when grant
financing was declining. In the face of even less grant financing, the second planned IDA-financed micro-credit project
(FYo0) will help the industry achieve sustainability by improving its creditworthiness and its ability to access funding from
the formal financial sector. The second project will also extend assistance to employment generating micro-enterprise
activities since income generating micro-credit activities will remain a poverty-mitigating instrument. Only wage
employment generated by faster and more broadly based economic growth will reduce poverty.
Rural Infrastructure Improvement: IDA will build on the successful experience of an earlier Rural Road Maintenance
and Improvement Project to further expand and improve rural roads, bridges and river jetties. The proposed Rural
Infrastructure Improvement project (FY03) will also support the development of rural markets that play a significant role in
improving incomes in the rural areas, particularly for women. Project preparation, prioritization of project components and
project implementation will be done in a highly participatory fashion. This participatory approach has been particularly
successful in the earlier project in empowering local communities to make decisions on rural infrastructure development
that is critical for facilitating the movement of goods and services, particularly in poor and remote areas.

IDA, in partnership with ADB, has made consistent efforts to address generic issues affecting

71. 
portfolio performance. A CPAR and a CFAA were carried out during FY00 and FY01, respectively. These

reviews identified the root causes of poor performance as inadequate ownership and commitment of
Government to project objectives, particularly as they relate to institutional and policy reforms, weak
implementation 
capacity, protracted decision-making 
and 
implementation procedures, 
poor
procurement management and inadequate public sector accountability. Report recommendations have
been discussed with the Government with the result that it has instituted actions aimed at reforming
public sector procurement policy and processes and improving public sector financial accountability.
IDA's portfolio management strategy will focus on quality at entry and improved supervision. A portfolio
improvement action plan has been formulated that draws on lessons learned, better supervision
planning, timely portfolio performance reviews and a further judicious shifting of portfolio supervision to
the Dhaka field office.

72. 
Recognizing that fundamental reform of the civil service and governance is likely to take time,
controlling fraud and corruption within IDA-financed projects will be a critical operational priority.
IDA's efforts to strengthen the prior review process and intensify ex post reviews have sent a clear signal

25

to the borrower and implementing agencies. 
In FYoo, 24 contracts were declared as misprocurement
and US$3.1 million canceled from various credits. This supervisory discipline will continue in FYO1-03.

73. 
As of September 30, 2000, IFC had outstanding committed investments in 7 companies in
Bangladesh with total exposure of US$64.3 million including US$ 62.8 million for its own account and
US$1.5 million for B loan participants (Annex 8). Total disbursed portfolio as of the same date was
US$49.4 million, including US$ 3.4 million of equity investments, for US$46 million of A loans and
US$1.5 million of B loans. The portfolio includes projects in financial markets, infrastructure, cement,
and textiles. Portfolio performance is good, with the exception of one textiles company, which is in
arrears. The interest collection rate as of September 30, 2000 is 94.3%.

74. 
To date, MIGA has facilitated an estimated US$580 million of foreign direct investment into
Bangladesh. As of September 30,2000, MIGA's gross exposure in Bangladesh stood at US$79.5 million,
approximately 1.8% of MIGA's total gross exposure and approximately 6% of MIGA's IDA portfolio. The
portfolio consists of five guarantee contracts for projects in infrastructure and manufacturing.

Co-location of Work

75. The Bank Group will continue to deliver its assistance program in Bangladesh in a decentralized
fashion. The Bank's Country Director has been resident in Dhaka since 1997. The Bank and IFC have
shared office premises since the establishment of an IFC presence in Dhaka in 1995. The number of Bank
staff in the Dhaka office has grown from 91 in 1997 to 123 in 2000, primarily due to expansion of national
staff. At present, 40% of team leaders and just over 50% of task team leaders, two-thirds of whom are
national staff, are based in Dhaka. The Dhaka office procurement team is authorized to review and clear
contracts up to US$ 500,000 for goods and works, and US$ 300,000 for consultant services. The
disbursement team's responsibilities include full review of all withdrawal applications for projects task-
managed by Dhaka office staff and partial review of all other applications. The decentralization of
program management, expansion of the Dhaka office and decentralization of program responsibilities
have deepened appreciation of conditions 
in Bangladesh, strengthened 
local relationships and
partnerships and helped to increase the responsiveness of the Bank Group's assistance program to local
needs. IFC's Dhaka office functions as a satellite to the regional hub in Delhi, which maintains full
processing capacity for manufacturing and service projects and supports the processing of financial
sector, infrastructure, oil, gas and chemicals projects.

D. CAS SCENARIOS AND TRIGGERS

76. 
The level of Bank Group financial assistance to Bangladesh will depend on the Government's
ability to remove the governance and other structural constraints impeding growth and poverty
reduction. The extent and depth to which the Government undertakes reforms to remove these
constraints will trigger different levels of support under the low-, base- and high-case scenarios.
Indicative triggers for the three scenarios are summarized in Table 6.

77. 
The Low Case scenario is characterized by negligible progress on structural reform, no
improvement in portfolio management and continued slippage in macroeconomic performance from pre-
FYoo levels. 
In this environment, which currently prevails in Bangladesh, IDA believes that selected
interventions in health, education, rural development and governance improvement (e.g. judicial/legal
reform) - comprising a core poverty program - would protect progress achieved in these areas and help
to maintain dialogue with the Government. IDA support for the core poverty program would be about
US$ 800 million over the 3-year CAS period. Since IFC's role in promoting private sector development
also depends on the policy environment, its low case program would focus on limited investments and
advisory services in support of SME development.

78. 
The Low Case scenario assumes that the Government will not accelerate the pace of reform during
the period before the elections expected in mid-2001. However, following the elections, a Base Case
scenario could emerge if progress is made on macroeconomic performance, structural reform in a few
key sectors and portfolio performance. In addition, this case assumes the new Government will initiate

26

some measures 
to improve public sector governance, especially 
in procurement and financial
accountability. Under this scenario, in addition to assistance for the core poverty program, financial

support will be extended to the sectors that demonstrate satisfactory progress on reforms.

The extent to which the Government takes actions to achieve reform goals in these sectors will determine
the magnitude and sectoral composition of base case lending. If the policy and institutional constraints
hindering a greater private sector role in the infrastructure and gas sectors were removed, IFC and MIGA
could play a significantly larger role in mobilizing financing in these areas.

79. 
Base Case lending over the CAS period would be about US$1.4 billion, a composite of Low Case
lending in FY01 (about US$300 million) and higher levels of lending in FY02-03 that would be closer to
the indicative annual IDA allocation. Given the lower lending level in FY01, the average per capita IDA

program for Bangladesh would remain below that of other developing countries with similar levels of
GNP per capita and policy performance. Bangladesh could have access to higher IDA funding if tangible
steps were taken to address institutional weaknesses and improve governance so that the country raises
its capacity to absorb larger amounts of aid and use resources more effectively.

80. 
The High Case scenario assumes comprehensive reform with the government adopting and
initiating implementation of a broad-based reform agenda covering governance, institutional and
structural issues in many of the key sectors - energy, banking/finance, water resources, agriculture,
urban development, public administration, health, education and 
the cross-cutting area of
decentralization. Bank Group support under this scenario could be substantially higher (up to US$ 2.0
billion over three years) and would include adjustment lending in addition to financing for technical
assistance and project investments. In the event that Bangladesh moves to a High Case scenario, a CAS
progress report would accompany Board presentation of adjustment operations, which could include a
Poverty Reduction Support Credit and/or lending to support structural reforms in strategic sectors such
as finance/banking and power. The CAS progress report would outline actions taken by the Government
to advance its development agenda, and indicate the areas where adjustment lending would accelerate
the implementation of reforms. 
In the High Case scenario, IFC could play a larger role in financing
private investment, developing financial markets, and providing advisory services related to privatization.

E. MONITORING AID EFFECIVENESS

81. 
The effectiveness of development assistance should be judged against its ability to deliver the
desired results in reducing poverty. Hence, rigorous monitoring of development assistance and
close tracking of progress in the Government's reform program are guiding principles of the
CAS. To ensure this supervision as well as the adequate focus of joint efforts with the Government and
other development partners, a two-tiered monitoring framework is proposed. The first tier is a set of set
of core outcome benchmarks (Table 7). The specific quantitative targets are based on relevant historical
data for Bangladesh, the performance of other low-income countries and macroeconomic growth
projections under the base case scenario. These will be discussed with the Government and other
development partners and finalized during formulation of the PRSP. The objective is to gain the
agreement of all key stakeholders on a full set of indicators and make the monitoring process transparent
and participatory. The Government is expected to take primary responsibility for monitoring these
indicators for which data can be readily obtained through the HIES and smaller surveys and from project
implementation databases. Adequate monitoring and evaluation systems are in place in the Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Health and, to a lesser extent, in the Project Monitoring and
Evaluation Department and other public agencies implementing IDA-financed projects.

82. 
The second tier of indicators comprises intermediate milestones. These are indicators directly
related to the Bank Group's dialogue with the Government that would contribute to the achievement of
desired outcomes under each of the main CAS themes. They have been defined through a four-step
process. First, the key issues or constraints were identified through problem diagnosis. Second,
strategies and measures to address these issues/constraints were proposed. Third, appropriate Bank
Group lending and non-lending services, aimed at achieving desired development outcomes were defined.
Fourth, to assess implementation performance, self-evaluation and country performance indicators have
been identified. The results of this process are summarized in the CAS performance matrix (Annex 9).
Although intermediate milestones linked to sectoral or cross-sectoral programs under development are

outlined in this matrix (a sub-set of which is presented in Table 8), these will need to be further refined

and quantified as the programs evolve. They could also be amended during the CAS period if priorities
change or if more action is required in certain areas to accelerate poverty reduction. These monitoring
and evaluation processes will feed into the formulation of the Bank Group's annual business plans for
assistance to Bangladesh.

F. MANAGING THE RISKS

83. 
The CAS faces political and economic risks. The election could result in a weak coalition,
or the new Government may not be willing to invest political capital in reforms. In such a
case, the current unsatisfactozy situation of stalled or slow reforms would be likely to prevail in the near-
to medium-term, and the Bank Group assistance program would continue to be constrained by weak
political will. The resulting Low Case lending could lead to a deterioration in Bank Group relations with
the Government, which has already complained that IDA assistance levels in FY00 and planned for FY01
are too low to sustain the investments needed for growth and poverty reduction. There is little that IDA
can do to mitigate political risk. However, in terms of managing country relations, IDA could engage the
new Government through non-lending services to foster debate and build consensus on reforms. To
maintain core poverty assistance programs, 
IDA would increasingly 
rely on community-based
approaches. This would involve NGOs and community-based organizations working in partnership with
local governments to deliver services to the poor.

84. Macroeconomic slippage as a result of revenue colection shortfalls and medium-
term balance of payments pressures presents another major risk. The MFA phase-out and
sustained oil price increases could exacerbate this situation. To mitigate this risk, the CAS provides
technical assistance to support export expansion and diversification and to help the Government closely
monitor balance of payments position.

85. Bangladesh's economy 

is also vulnerable to natural disasters of catastrophic

proportions. In recognition of this, IDA must be prepared to consider additional assistance for post-
disaster recovery through operations similar to those provided in the aftermath of the 1998 flood. This
would be incremental to the investments for coastal embankments and riverbank protection that have
been proposed to strengthen disaster mitigation capacity. IDA would support building the Government's
capacity in managing these disasters and implementing a long-term flood control action plan.

1. Judicial/legal reform 
* Due to lack of capacity to plan and 
implement its own affairs, the Civil 
Justice system is subject to excessive 
delays with a major negative impact on 
economic activity and impedes people's 
access to justice. 
* The Civil Justice system is inequitable 
as it widens the gulf between the wealthy 
litigant who can cope with the system, 
and the poor who cannot.

CAS Consultations - Main Findings

1. 
In preparation for the CAS, the country team comprising IDA and IFC staff carried out extensive in-
country consultations during January-June, 2000, with the Government, civil society representatives and
other stakeholders. A new approach differed from previous consultations in two important ways. First,
staff invited a broad array of new groups and individuals to contribute their ideas, and second, the
discussions focused less on the Bank Group and its specific projects and more on the national objectives
and priorities for Bangladesh. This approach allowed the Bank Group to listen to the people of
Bangladesh set out their priorities and solutions for promoting prosperity in the country. The information
is used as one of several sources (e.g. analytical work, previous consultations undertaken by the Bank
and other institutions) to determine the best role for the Bank Group in addressing the primary concerns
expressed by the groups consulted.

2. 
The Consultations were carried out in two phases over a period of about six months. Phase 1, from
mid-January 
through mid-February was 
the 'Listening Phase." 
Academics, businesspeople,
parliamentary committees, Government ministers and secretaries, trade unions, NGOs, donors and the
media, as well as representatives from the urban slums in Dhaka, and villagers and city leaders from the
Rajshahi and Sylhet regions took part. The Bank met with groups of 20-30 representatives from these
segments of society to hear their views on the recent achievements of Bangladesh, the current
challenges, the future vision and priorities for the country and specific suggestions on how to achieve that
vision. A short survey was carried out as part of the process.

3. 
Phase two had two objectives. In addition to providing feedback to phase one participants on the
priorities that emerged from the consultations, it shared with them preliminary ideas on the CAS in
workshops that brought different groups together.

4. 
Highly interactive, the January-February consultations provided valuable feedback on development
priorities and strategic responses. The feedback summarized in the section below confirms the findings of
previous consultations and analytical work carried out by the World Bank Group, such development
partners as the UNDP and ADB and Bangladeshi institutions. The cumulative knowledge from these
efforts has helped to shape the strategic thrust of the CAS. The participants in the consultations
expressed a strong desire to continue the dialogue with the World Bank Group and to have further
opportunity to engage the Government in dialogue about Bangladesh's priorities and development.

Feedback on Bangladesh's Development Priorities

5. 
Bangladesh has achieved a great deal in recent years, and the people consulted are proud of
those gains. They noted the progress made in social indicators such as reduced population growth rates,
improving access to health care and increased school enrollment of children, especially girls. They also
noted improvements in infrastructure, citing the Jamuna Bridge, and improved disaster management.
There are more opportunities for women in both government and the workplace, and Bangladeshis are
proud of the international recognition given to the National Language Day.

6. 
Those consulted also expressed concerns about 
the many challenges that remain. The
predominant theme across all groups was Bangladesh's 
ineffective and 
inefficient 
institutions.
Specifically, people mentioned the conflicts between political parties, an ineffective Parliament, a public
bureaucracy that does not serve the people well, corruption and the deterioration in law and order. Other
common themes included the nation's inadequate infrastructure, particularly telecommunications, the low
quality of basic education, inadequate skill preparation in relation to the job market and continued gender
disparities. A number of other concerns raised in affected groups included the problem with arsenic in the
water. In general, water and sanitation issues drew more pronounced comments from rural villagers and
slum dwellers; slum demolition was a key concern among the slum dwellers; businesspeople expressed
anxiety about managing the negative effects of globalization.

Page 2 of 4
7. 
The remaining challenges can be grouped into three broad areas: Governance and Institutions,
Employment and Economic Growth and Basic Needs. The detailed issues in each of these categories
are summarized below:

Attachment 1

Institutions and Governance

8. 
One of the top concerns, raised in different ways by the participants, was in the area of
governance. Villagers, for example, were concerned about increased crime and violence; slum dwellers
were worried about law and order, slum demolition and unreliable police; and businesspeople were
concerned about unnecessary bureaucracy slowing down their ability to get things done and adding to the
costs of doing business. The ministers suggested that the Bank could play a role in training and capacity
building to strengthen government.

Employment and Economic Growth

9. 
The theme of employment and economic opportunity was raised in all groups consulted. The
villagers and urban poor spoke more about the lack of jobs, while the businesspeople spoke of the lack of
skilled manpower and the challenges of managing businesses and dealing with competitive pressures
resulting from trade liberalization. All groups spoke of the critical role that improved infrastructure,
particularly communications 
infrastructure, could play 
in creating economic opportunities. 
The
perspectives of those consulted correlate closely with perspectives found in previous consultations. For
example, the Consultations with the Poor done by the World Bank in late 1999, and the UNpromPT
Process in 1996 found that "not able to find work' was the top priority in rural areas for both men and
women.

Basic Needs

10. 
A common refrain stressed that despite considerable progress and improvements 
in social
indicators, more progress in the area of Basic Needs is required. While access to basic education and
health care had improved, the groups talked about the need to focus on improving quality. As one
villager put it quite simply, "More children are in school, but the quality is not good." A Government
minister acknowledged, "In our haste to cover a lot of people in a short amount of time we have sacrificed
quality." One of the key action steps raised in several of the groups consulted involved increasing the
coordination and cooperation between government and NGOs to ensure that Basic Needs are addressed
effectively. Additionally, the groups suggested better collection of data and monitoring of performance
related to the quality of social services being offered, particularly basic education and health.

Opinion Survey Results: National Priorities and Institutions 

Attachment 1
Page 3 of 4

11. 
In addition to listening to the participants' perspectives during the consultations, the World Bank
also carried out a written survey with selected groups designed to elicit views on prosperity and wealth
creation, national priorities and the role of the Government and other organizations. Survey results reflect
the views of those 188 individuals consulted, and indicate a strong belief that larger organizations such as
multilateral agencies, the national Government and big business are too powerful, while such entities as
small and medium-sized businesses, local governments, average citizens and particularly women do not
have enough power.

12. 
Top priorities expressed by the participants in the survey seem to reinforce quantitatively the
general priorities articulated by the participants during the consultations. Key issues such as eliminating
corruption and ensuring all children have access to quality health and education emerged as the priorities
most widely shared by all the groups consulted. Other top priorities differ by group, but most tend to
include ensuring that citizens have a meaningful say in political decisions, dramatically reduced
unemployment, personal security and effective govemment institutions.
