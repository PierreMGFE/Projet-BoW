1. 

This CPS i s the second to be prepared fo r Costa R ica fo l low ing a nearly 1 O-year period o f 
very limited engagement be tween Costa R ica and the Bank. The previous CPS, presented to the 
Board in mid-2004, was a key step in establishing a framework fo r a closer partnership and 
aimed at mutual learning and knowledge sharing, rather than significant resource trans fer v ia 
lending operations. The present CPS also includes a very selective, demand-driven program, 
taking in to account the government’s po l icy priorities. To enable be t ter alignment with Costa 
Rica’s po l i t ica l cycle going forward, this CPS has a relatively short time-frame -- August 2008- 
December 2010 - covering the remaining t e r m o f the cu r ren t administration and an additional 7 
months fo l low ing the next presidential transition in M a y 20 10 to enable development o f the next 
CPS with a new, incoming government. This w i l l help better align fu tu re CPS preparation with 
Costa Rica’s po l i t ica l cycle, in turn, smoothing CPS design and implementation going forward. 

.. 11. 

Costa R ica i s a development success story in many respects. An upper middle-income 
country with about 4.5 m i l l i o n people and a GDP per capita o f $5,800 (2007), Costa R ica has 
been one o f the most stable democracies in La t in America - with relatively strong pub l ic 
institutions and peaceful transitions o f power since 1949. Poverty and inequality are much lower 
in Costa Rica than the averages for L a t i n America and Central America, and social indicators are 
generally much stronger than fo r comparable countries in the region and world-wide. The 
country has experienced steady economic expansion over the past 25 or so years, p r ima r i ly due 
t o the implementation since the late 1980s o f a strategy o f outward-oriented, export-led growth, 
openness to foreign investment and gradual trade liberalization. Costa Rica grew at an annual 
average rate o f 5% throughout t h e 1990’s and has generally outpaced the average growth rate fo r 
the region in the current millennium. GDP growth reached a peak o f 8.8% in 2006 and 
maintained a healthy pace (6.8%) in 2007. Finally, i t should be noted that Costa R ica has also 
been a wo r ld leader on environmental issues , ensuring that economic g row th i s no t achieved at 
the expense o f i t s rich natural endowments, and successfully exploiting linkages between 
environmental protection and poverty reduction. 

iii. Costa Rica’s outlook fo r the CPS period i s broadly positive, but a gradual moderation o f 
g row th should be expected. GDP growth i s expected to decline to about 5 percent over the CPS 
period, due to the slowdown in the US, h i g h food and o i l prices, and gradual monetary tightening 
t o reduce inflation, although consumer and bus iness confidence i s expected t o remain high. 
Costa Rica’s strong fiscal performance in recent years implies, however, that the country has 
some room to maneuver. The combination o f h igh growth rates and important administrative 
measures introduced b y the presen t Government have contributed t o a significant increase in tax 
collection - over 27 percent per year in the last two years. This, in turn, led to an increase in the 
tax-to-GDP ratio o f 1.5 percentage points over that period. Combined with lower in te res t rates 
o n pub l ic debt, higher tax revenues have allowed for increased spending in p r io r i ty areas while 
simultaneously contributing to a small fiscal s u r p l u s . Nonetheless, the Government i s very 
conscious o f the fiscal r i s k s associated with the unfavorable external environment (as well as the 
ever-present threat o f natural disasters) and i s mov ing to develop a comprehensive risk 
management framework. 

iv. 
Besides risk management, the Costa Rican Government's medium-term strategic 
priorities are associated with: (a) the need to address emerging challenges to continued growth 
and competitiveness, in particular with respect to infrastructure shortcomings, skills gaps and 
excessive red tape; and (b) sustaining and deepening recent gains with respect to poverty 
reduction, social sector development and the environment. To help further these priorities, and 
taking into account the lessons learned from implementation of the 2004-08 CPS, the 
Government and Bank have identified specific activities for inclusion in this CPS a s described 
below. The Government has been particularly interested in some of the newer instruments 
offered by 
the Bank, in particular contingent financing (DDO) and opportunities for 
reimbursable TA . 

Four lending operations, totaling about US$258 million, targeted to specific areas in 
which the Bank has global expertise or suitable instruments for managing risk (a Cat 
DDO, Telecommunications TA , Secondary Education and Labor Skills, and Integrated 
Infrastructure Development of the City-Port o f Puntarenas) 
Reimbursable TA for the CCSS both in the management of pension assets and in 
supporting continued strengthening of the health system and continued support for 
domestic debt market development 
Non-reimbursable TA related to competitiveness, poverty targeting and streamlining of 
social assistance. 

v. 
This proposed lending program, albeit still modest, represents an increase in the volume 
of lending over the previous CPS which included a program o f about $218 n ~ i l l i o n over a 3 112 
year period. excluding grants. Successful implementation of this CPS will a l low for even closer 
engagement in the future, in areas of mutual interest. Indeed, the Government and Bank have 
already agreed that the lending envelope for Costa Rica could be enlarged over the CPS period, 
should the Government be interested in further financial and related technical support from the 
Bank. 

vi. 
IFC's strategy for Central America, including Costa Rica, concentrates on financial 
sector, infrastructure, health and education and agribusiness with particular emphasis on IDA 
countries. In this context, the strategy in Costa Rica continues to center o n pursuing investment 
opportunities in: (a) developing regional capital markets and strengthening local financial 
institutions; (b) viable manufacturing and service projects; and (c) the agricultural sector. The 
strategy for the financial sector combines advisory and investment activities to support locally- 
owned financial institutions that serve the SME and housing segments. For the manufacturing 
and services sectors, IFC's strategy focuses on the retail and commercial real estate sectors as 
well a s for IT services and products bringing higher value-added to Cos ta Rica, more at the brink 
of the US-CAFTA implementation. Finally, with respect to agribusiness IFC is focusing on 
supporting exports-oriented primary agricultural producers such a s bananas and pineapples. 

vii. 
The risks associated with this CPS are relatively low. The most pertinent risk to 
implementation of the CPS lending program derives from the lengthy legislative approvals 
process which applies to externally funded operations. This risk could be magnified a s the 
country enters the election cycle from mid next year. The CPS attempts to minimize the risk of 
delays by: (i) focusing operations on areas of high strategic importance to a wide range of 

po l i t ica l actors; (ii) ensuring that the size o f operations i s adequate to ensure h i g h leve l po l i t ica l 
commitment within the executive; and (iii) wo rk ing closely with the Executive to build wide 
consensus, inc lud ing among Assembly members, on the content o f the operations throughout the 
development phase. Other r i s k s derive principally f rom the external environment, particularly a 
sharper-than-anticipated acceleration in food prices a n d o r an unexpectedly prolonged slow- 
down in the United States. Costa Rica has been proactively addressing these r isks , in particular, 
b y drawing up a comprehensive strategy with respect to food p r i c e increases, covering bo th i t s 
potential economic and poverty impacts. The Bank i s prepared to support implementation o f the 
strategy through bo th analytical inputs and lending, should the Government reques t it.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
FOR THE 
REPUBLIC OF COSTA R ICA 

I. Introduction 

1. 
This Costa Rica-World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 
has a relatively short time-frame -- August 2008-December 2010 -- to enable better 
alignment with Costa Rica’s political cycle going forward. The CPS covers the 
remaining t e r m of the current administration, led b y Nobe l Peace Laureate, Oscar Arias, 
and allows fo r an additional seven months fo l low ing the next presidential transition in 
M a y 2010 to enable development o f the next CPS with a new, incom ing government. 
The last CPS, presented to the Board in M a y 2004, straddled the latter h a l f o f the Pacheco 
administration and the f i r s t h a l f o f the current, Arias, administration, wh ich took office in 
M a y 2006. A CPS progress report was prepared in October, 2006 to make necessary 
adjustments to programmed CPS activities and ensure their consistency with the Arias 
Government’s priorities. Fo l low ing a nearly decade-long pe r iod o f extremely limited 
engagement between Costa Rica and the Bank, the 2004 CPS, was a key step in 
establishing a framework for a closer partnership aimed at mutual learning and 
knowledge sharing rather than significant resource t rans fe r v ia lending operations. This 
CPS also includes a very selective program, taking in to account the government’s po l icy 
priorities fo r the next two years and the po l i t ica l realities o f the upcoming presidential 
election cycle. 

11. Country Context 

A. Country Context 

2. 
Costa R ica i s a development success story in many respects. An upper middle- 
income country o f about 4.5 m i l l i o n people and a GDP per capita o f $5,800 (2007), Costa 
Rica has been one o f the most stable democracies in L a t i n America - with uninterrupted 
democratically-elected governments and peaceful transitions o f power since 1949. 
Several factors have contributed to this stability, including: (i) the limited presence and 
power o f land-based oligarchies; (ii) the abolition o f the army after a brief c i v i l war in 
1948; (iii) the enactment o f a new constitution in 1949 wh ich founded one o f La t in 
America’s f i r s t welfare states; and (iv) the presence o f e f fec t ive mechanisms for social 
mob i l i ty . The President and a Legislative Assembly comprised o f 57 legislators are 
elected fo r four-year te rms . Two major po l i t ica l parties have generally alternated in 
power, but recent years have seen greater po l i t ica l diversity, with the r i s e o f a number o f 
smaller par t ies . Costa Rica’s government and po l i t ica l norms have long placed a h i g h 
premium on achievement o f wide socio-political consensus on major policies. W h i l e t h i s 
can lead, at times, to extremely slow decision-making, i t also helps create a broad social 
base, enhancing the sustainability o f economic and social reforms and helping to 
maintain the credibility and accountability o f pub l ic institutions.

3 . 
Pove r ty i s much lowe r in Costa R i c a th an the averages fo r L a t i n Ame r ica 
a n d C e n t r a l Ame r ica . The percentage o f Costa R i c a n s l i v i n g in poverty f e l l f rom close 
to 32 percent in 1989 to around 22-24 percent during the period 1994-2006, using the 
national poverty l i n e . Over the s am e period, extreme poverty hovered at 6.5-7 percent. 
I f the international poverty l ines o f $2 and $1 per capita per day fo r poverty and extreme 
poverty respectively a re used, only about 9 percent o f Costa Ricans were poor and only 
about 2% we re l i v i n g in extreme poverty. D e s p i t e these l o w overall levels o f poverty in 
Costa Rica, the re are some areas o f the country in wh ich the concentration o f poor and 
extremely poor households i s relatively high, me r i t ing focused attention to improve 
economic opportunities and basic and social se rv ices . 

4. 
In com e inequa l i ty , measured by the gini coefficient, i s also lowe r in Costa 
R i c a th an in ne ighbo r ing countries and the L a t i n Ame r ica reg ion as a whole, but, a t 
0.48 in 2004, i s nonetheless h ighe r th an countries a t s im i la r income levels in other 
w o r l d regions. Moreover, there i s some evidence that income inequality has been rising, 
f rom a lower l e v e l o f 0.44 in 1989. The Arias administration i s strongly committed to 
further reducing bo th poverty and inequality through rapid, equitable growth, improved 
targeting o f social assistance and social serv ices , and integrated interventions to revitalize 
areas o f h i g h poverty concentration. The specific priorities outlined in the Government’s 
plan a re described further in section I11 below. 

5 . 

Costa Rica’s social ind icators a r e strong re la t ive to compa rab le countries in 
the region. L i f e expectancy at birth, at 79 years, i s comparable to OECD levels and 
close to 96 percent o f Costa R i c a n adults are literate. Social security coverage (both 
health insurance and pensions) i s among the highest in L a t i n America and, since 1995, i s 
managed by the autonomous Social Secu r i ty Institute (CCSS). As shown in Table 1 
below, Costa Rica’s key social indicators a re generally in l i n e with, or stronger than, the 
averages fo r L a t i n America and other upper middle income countries. The one notable 
exception i s secondary education, where coverage lags the comparator countries b y a 
substantial margin.

T h e l o w levels o f p o v e r t y and s t rong soc ia l ind ica to rs obse rved in Cos ta R i c a 
h a v e been fac i l i ta ted by steady econom ic expans ion o v e r t h e past 25 o r so years . 
F rom the mid-1980s onwards, Costa R ica has been one o f the more stable, and faster- 
g row ing economies in L a t i n America, primarily due to the implementation o f a new 
strategy o f outward-oriented, export-led growth, openness to foreign investment and 
gradual trade liberalization. This strategy helped transform the economy f r om h i g h 
dependence on traditional agriculture (coffee and bananas) to today’s diversified 
economy, led b y high-tech computer and electronic industries, services, non-traditional 
agriculture and tourism. This i s illustrated by the changes in coffee and banana exports 
wh ich account for under 10 percen t o f total exports today versus nearly one-third o f total 
exports in 1985. Over the same period, the ratio o f exports to GDP doubled, r is ing f rom 
under 20 percent to over 40 percent. Annual growth during the 1990s averaged about 5 
percent, substantially higher than the L A C average, with factor p roduc t iv i ty accounting 
fo r two - f i f ths o f this performance. In the current millennium, growth slowed in 2001- 
2002 in l i n e with the res t o f the region, but p icked up again, reaching a peak o f 8.8 
pe rcen t in 2006 and maintaining a healthy pace o f about 6.8 percen t in 2007. G row th in 
Costa Rica has consistently been above the Central Am e r i c a n average during 2001 -2007, 
and above the L a t i n American average fo r a l l but one o f those years (2004). 

7. 
Cos ta R i c a has also been a w o r l d l e a d e r on e n v i r o nm e n t a l issues, ensu r ing 
that econom ic g r o w t h i s n o t ach ieved at t h e expense o f i t s r i c h natural endowmen ts , 
and successfully exp lo i t ing l inkages b e tw e e n e n v i r o nm e n t a l p r o t e c t i o n and p o v e r t y 
reduc t ion . I t has se t aside about 25 percent o f i t s land to protected areas and has put in 
place innovative ways to pay i t s citizens fo r good environmental practices. G iven Costa 
Rica’s rich biodiversity - about 5 percent o f known species world-wide - and imp rov ing 
tourist infrastructure, eco-tourism has become, after the INTEL chip plant, the p r inc ipa l 
foreign exchange earner, and a driver fo r ru ra l development. In addition, Costa R ica has 
been a leader in developing markets fo r global environmental services, such as Carbon 
Trading Offsets, as well as fo r loca l environmental services, where water bills in some 
parts o f the country n ow include a charge to pay f a rm e r s upstream fo r “producing water”. 
Studies show payments fo r these loca l and global se rv ices can be effective ways to 
reduce ru ra l poverty in a sustainable way. The current Government has recently 
committed the country to a 0 carbon-footprint by the year 202 1. The Government i s also 
developing plans fo r more cost-effective ways to mitigate the impact on the populace, 
and especially on poor households, o f the many natural disasters (hurricanes, seismic 
activity) to wh ich the country i s subject by virtue o f i t s topography and geographic 
location. In this context, Costa R ica has h i g h potential to be a regional leader fo r South- 
South cooperation in the f ie ld o f disaster risk management.

8. 
Cos ta R ica ’s r e c e n t mac roeconom ic p e r f o rm a n c e has b e e n one o f t h e 
strongest in Latin Am e r i c a . GDP g r o w t h reached 8.8 p e r c e n t in 2006 and an 

3 

estimated 6.8 percent in 2007. B y comparison, L a t i n America as a whole grew at 5.1 
and 4.5 percent in the same two years. Costa Rica’s strong economic performance i s 
attributable to a combination o f internal and external factors. O n the internal front, 
relatively h i g h bus iness and consumer confidence and l o w in te res t rates contributed to an 
acceleration in private consumption and investment, h i g h ac t iv i ty in the construction 
sector and robust growth in domestic manufacturing, especially in high-tech industries. 
O n the external front, robust wo r ld growth helped create strong external demand fo r the 
country’s exports, and sizeable increases in tourism and foreign direct investment (FDI) 
inflows. 

9 . 
The country’s external position also strengthened in 2006-2007. Costa Rica’s 
large trade imbalance showed signs o f improvement during 2007. Me rchand ise exports 
more than offset an upsurge in imports to produce a reduction in the country’s trade 
deficit. The positive export performance was driven by an increase in industrial exports, 
ma in ly computer components and microchips, wh i le imports increased b y about h a l f the 
growth rate o f 2006. As a result, the trade deficit fo r the full year declined f rom 15 
percent o f GDP in 2006 to 14.3 percen t in 2007. Notwithstanding the fact that the cu r ren t 
account balance increased to -5.7 percen t o f GDP in 2007, strong capital inflows-1.6 
b i l l i o n dollars in 2007-allowed 
the country to increase i t s rese rves to over 4 b i l l i o n 
dollars b y the end o f the year. 

10. 
After a period o f relatively lower inflation from 2006-mid-2007, inflation in 
Costa Rica has been on the rise, driven in large measure by the high prices o f food 
and oil. Fo l low ing a steady decline through mid 2007, when i t moderated to an annual 
rate o f 8.6 percent (August 2007), headline in f la t ion reversed i t s declining trend. This 
reversal has been driven p r inc ipa l ly b y external factors such as the evolution o f o i l and 
international food prices (wh ich over 2007 increased 47 percent and 60 percent 
respectively), and also by domestic p ressu res associated w i t h booming domestic demand 
under tight supply conditions. The evolution o f food price in f la t ion i s particularly 
worrisome given the impact i t has on the poor. Year-on year food price in f la t ion reached 
22 percent in February 2008, with likely severe effects on the poor who necessarily 
devote a large share o f their income to food. Background analysis prepared fo r this CAS 
indicates that the recen t r i s e in food prices in Costa R ica may have contributed about 1.5 
percentage points to Costa Rica’s overall poverty rate. The Government i s currently 
developing a comprehensive strategy, including investments in agriculture and targeted 
income t rans fe rs to the most vulnerable, aimed at m i t iga t ing h i g h food prices going 
forward. 

1 1. 
Recen t fiscal performance has also been very strong. Administrative measures 
introduced by the presen t Government, combined with strong economic growth, have 
contributed to a significant increase in tax collection - over 27 percent per year in the last 
two years. This, in turn, led to an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio o f 1.5 percentage 
points over t h e period, with total tax revenues reaching 15.1 percent in 2007. Combined 
w i t h lower in te res t rates o n pub l ic debt, higher tax revenues have allowed fo r increased 
spending in p r io r i ty areas while simultaneously contributing t o a fiscal s u r p l u s fo r the

f i r s t time in f i f ty years: the overall balance o f the pub l ic sector shifted to a su rp lus o f 0.6 
percen t o f GDP in 2007. N e t public debt f e l l to a record l o w o f 38.4 percent in 2007.

B. Outlook f o r 2008-10 

12. 
The ou t look f o r 2008-10 i s broadly positive, but a moderation o f growth i s 
expected to take place in light o f external factors, including the slowdown in the U S 
and continued high food and o i l prices. The central government n ow forecasts a 4.5 
percent real GDP growth for 2008 (see Table 2 above). In M a y 2008, the economic 
activity index increased by 4.2 percent over the same mon th in 2007. This growth 
represen ts the slowest pace in almost th ree years and given that the U.S. i s Costa Rica’s 
ma in trading partner and i t s most important source o f FDI, a deeper or more prolonged 
slowdown in the U.S. could have a direct negative impact on exports, investment and the 
country’s external position. Thus far, however, indications a re that the large capital 
in f lows to Costa R ica are un l ike ly to be significantly affected as they have continued to 
be stable despite the presen t US downturn. O n the domestic front, expected contraction 
o f domestic demand could affect tax revenues while r is ing in te res t rates w i l l likely 
increase in te res t expenditures on the debt. As a resu l t , the fiscal s u r p l u s o f 2007 could 
turn in to a small de f ic i t . The Government i s currently revising the macroeconomic 
program fo r 2008-09 to reflect these factors. 

13. 
Inflationary pressures are likely to be moderately high during 2008 but are 
expected to reduce somewhat in 2009-2010. Headline in f la t ion reached 12.8 percent in 
June 2008, reflecting h i g h food and f u e l pr ices . Food prices have r i s e n tw ice as fast as 
headline in f ia t ion (26% as o f June). Perhaps more worrisome, the core in f la t ion rate 
(headline in f la t ion ne t o f food and o i l ) has also been rising--from 8.5 percent in January 

5 

2008 t o 11.4 percent in June 2008-indicating 
that there are second-round effects 
associated with high f o o d and o i l prices. In response t o these developments, the 
authorities are taking steps t o a v o i d a re tu rn t o doub le -d ig i t in f la t ion , high p u b l i c debt, 
and larger external balances. To tha t end, p r i o r i t y actions inc lude m o v i n g t ow a r d greater 
exchange rate flexibility, using interest rates t o bring d o w n in f la t ion , and fu r the r 
recap i ta l iza t ion o f the cen t ra l bank. 

14. 
Nonetheless, Costa Rica’s strong fiscal pe r fo rmance in recent years imp l ies 
th a t the coun t ry has some room f o r maneuver . As no ted in pa ra 11 , Costa R i c a i s in a 
re la t ive ly strong pos i t ion t o respond t o shocks thanks t o i t s sound f isca l p o l i c y and 
impo r tan t e f fo r ts t o imp rove tax co l lec t ion in recent years. Pub l ic debt i s expected t o 
continue in the downwa rd t rend witnessed in 2006-07, g iven expectations o f con t inued 
g r ow t h in the 4-4.5 percent range. Gross p u b l i c debt w o u l d g radua l ly f a l l t o about 38 
percent o f GD P by 20 10, w h i l e external p u b l i c debt w o u l d stabilize at a round 1 1 percent 
o f GDP . Moreover, Costa R i c a has sizable fo re ign exchange reserves ($4.2 b i l l i o n as o f 
June 2008), has taken impo r tan t steps towa rd a mo re f lex ib le exchange rate reg ime in the 
con tex t o f the t rans i t ion t o i n f l a t i o n targeting, and has imp lemen ted measures t o 
strengthen the f inanc ia l system. Desp i te these pos i t ive factors, there i s some risk that 
g loba l shocks, in pa r t icu la r fu r the r s l ow d ow n o f the US economy, c o u l d fu r the r depress 
g r ow t h rates as w e l l as nega t ive ly a f fec t the external current account pos i t ion . 

Box 1.1. Debt Sustainability in Costa Rica - IMF Assessment 

In i t s latest A r t i c l e I V consultation report o f March 2008, the I M F finds that Costa Rica’s external and 
public debt outlook i s sustainable fo l low ing a downward path in the medium t e rm horizon. The 
sustainability o f debt i s maintained even under alternative sensitivity scenarios. The baseline scenario 
estimates that total public debt (including the non f inanc ia l public sector and the Central Bank) wou ld be 
reduced to 37.4 percent o f GDP b y 2012 ( from 44.6 in 2007), while total (public and private) external debt 
i s projected to decline from 26.4 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 20.5 b y 2012. The public sector external debt 
wou ld be reduced from 17.9 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 11.2 percent in 2012. 
Under the historical average scenario” debt indicators increase l e s s than 2-percent o f GDP during the 
short-term horizon and then converge close to t h e baseline scenario levels b y 2012. The short-term horizon 
increase in public and external debt ratios does not pose a risk to debt sustainability. The different Bound 
Tests scenarios present a potential risk for the country’s public debt i f growth significantly deviates from 
t h e baseline or i f t h e country experiences a one-time real depreciation o f at least 30 percent; in spite o f 
these stress tests, the debt to GDP ratio w i l l remain below 50 percent b y 2012.

” The historical average scenario i s the main sensitivity analysis evaluated by t h e IMF under i ts most recent DSA for Costa Rica. This 
scenario assumes that the key macroeconomic underlying variables are at their historical average (o f t h e latest 10 years) during t h e 
projection period. The key variables include real GDP growth, real and nominal interest rates, inflation, current account, among 
others.

C. Growth and Competitiveness 

15. 
Beyond continued macroeconomic stability, Costa R ica ’s medium-term 
challenges a re also associated with the efforts needed to continue to improve 
competitiveness and the business climate. O n the trade front, Costa R ica remains the 
only signatory to CAFTA -DR which i s yet to implement the agreement. Although the 
f ree trade deal was na r row ly approved in October 2007 in an historic referendum, some 
e lemen ts o f the complementary agenda, wh ich involves major structural changes such as 
opening the insurance and telecommunications sectors, s t i l l await approval by the 
Assembly. The Government, wh ich i s deeply committed to securing the approval o f 
CAFTA , requested an extension f rom C A F T A signatories before the deadline fo r passage 
o f t h e complementary laws expired on February 29, 2008. Approval o f the CAFTA - 
related legislation i s n ow expected before the new deadline o f September 2008 and i s a 
major p r io r i ty o f the country’s re fo rm agenda. O f the 12 laws included in the 
complementary agenda, 10 were passed by July 2008. The remaining two --public 
en t i t ies modernization l aw and additional regulations related t o intellectual property 
rights) a re under discussion in the Assembly and are expected to be finalized during a 
special Assembly session in August. 

16. One o f the most pressing issues affecting Costa Rican competitiveness i s the 
need to address infrastructure bottlenecks which could jeopardize the country’s 
attractiveness to investors in the medium to longer term. A key challenge i s to 
rehabilitate the primary t rade co r r ido rs , inc lud ing bo th the link highways and major ports 
on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, to help facilitate trade, tourism and business 
expansion. To b r ing about the required efficiency and investments, Costa R ica w i l l need 
to introduce institutional reforms as well as consider a way to ensu re that the budgetary 
process allows sufficient resources fo r road maintenance. Government i s seeking ways 
o f enhancing the impact o f additional infrastructure spending through mechanisms that 
exploit public-private synergies, reduce overlaps and improve overall cost-effectiveness 
o f road rehabilitation programs. This should help with the a im o f significantly lowering 
costs in the long-term, wh i le imp rov ing road quality on a sustainable basis. The Bank’s 
recent PER i s supporting Government in this effort through analysis o f viable po l icy 
options. I t i s also wo r th no t ing that the Costa Rican Government i s g iv ing attention to 
addressing g row ing road safety concerns and has developed a comprehensive plan - the 
most advanced o f i t s kind in Central America. 

17. Besides transport, Costa Rica’s long-term competitiveness i s closely linked to 
improvements in energy and telecommunications. In the e lec t r ic i ty sector, there i s a 
need to expand supply and reduce p r ices through the p rov is ion o f incentives to expand 
generation assets as well as parallel efforts to strengthen regulatory oversight. Although 
basic indicators fo r the telecommunications sector reveal h i g h penetration, other 
important issues such as the l o w quality o f service (both landline and mobile), the l o w 
penetration o f high-speed in terne t , the lack o r delay in technological innovation, 
uncertainties in the allocation o f spectrum and overall slow pace o f investment po in t to 
the need fo r a more competitive regulatory environment. The Government i s very 

7 

conscious o f the above i s s u e s and i s p romo t ing leg is la t ion t o spearhead sectoral re fo rms 
in e lec t r ic i ty and telecoms, w h i c h was approved by the N a t i o n a l Assemb ly earlier this 
year as pa r t o f the C A F T A - D R complementary agenda. Mo reove r , in energy and 
telecoms, as w e l l as transport, i t i s l o o k i n g towards the execu t ion o f pend ing concessions 
and i d e n t i f y i n g other pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships as a p r i n c i p a l means o f supporting 
sectoral expansion, and hence, g row th . These e f fo r ts w i l l be c ruc ia l t o ach iev ing the 
increased inves tmen t in infrastructure 
that 
i s needed t o ma in ta in the country’s 
attractiveness t o business investment. 

18. While Costa R i c a holds a reasonably high rank on some global 
competitiveness rankings, other comparisons indicate that there i s considerable 
room f o r cutting back o n red tape associated with business starts, operation and 
exits. F o r example, Costa Rica’s t rad i t iona l strengths - p o l i t i c a l stability, strong 
ins t i tu t ions and l o w co r rup t ion vs. comparable countries - p lace i t at a re la t ive ly high 
rank in the Global Competitiveness Index . 
I t s show ing i s , however, m u c h l ow e r in t h e 
Bank’s D o i n g Business Repo r t (DBR), w h i c h tends t o focus m o r e n a r r ow l y o n the 
regu la t ion and processes associated with businesses as well as labo r ma rke t r ig id i t ies . 
Costa R i c a ranked second-lowest (after Honduras) among the C A F T A - D R partner 
countries in b o t h the 2006 and 2007 DBR rankings, in 1 17* and 1 15 * place in 2006 and 
2007 respectively. The Government i s cu r ren t ly exp lo r ing means o f im p r o v i n g the 
regu la to ry env i ronmen t f o r businesses, in part with assistance f r o m the Bank . 

19. 
An important challenge in Costa R ica ’s efforts to increase competitiveness 
concerns the emerging shortages of skilled workers, pointing, in turn, to the need to 
strengthen the coverage, quality and pertinence o f secondary education. The issues 
conce rn ing secondary education w h i c h have b o t h a competitiveness and an equity 
d imens ion are discussed fu r the r in Para. 24 be low . 
20. 
Finally, while Costa R ica has a number o f governance strengths - political 
stability, strong institutions and low corruption versus comparable countries - there 
i s nonetheless scope for modernizing public financial management both to improve 
efficiency in public funds execution and to strengthen Costa Rica’s competitiveness 
position. Spec i f ic p r io r i t ies f o r imp rovemen t i d e n t i f i e d by the Gove rnmen t in 
con junc t ion with the Bank-led C F M C P A R are 
i n c l u s i o n o f the State-Owned 
Enterprises (SOEs) budget within the budget law , standardization o f SOE f inanc ia l 
statements and standardization o f accounting practices f o r p u b l i c and p r iva te enterprises. 
In the p rocu remen t area, as well, there i s a need f o r mode rn iza t ion o f systems and 
processes a imed at increasing the e f f ic iency and speed o f p u b l i c procurement. 

D. Poverty Reduction and Soc ia l Sectors 

21. 
After well over a decade (1994-2006) o f very little change in poverty and 
unemployment levels, important reductions in both took place in 2007. O v e r a l l 
pove r ty decreased f r o m 22-23 percent d o w n t o 19 percent and extreme pove r ty f e l l even 
mo re r a p i d l y f r o m 6.5 percent t o 3.7 percent. T h i s decline in pove r ty i s in part l i n k e d t o 
the fast expansion o f the Costa R i c a n economy ove r the past 3 o r so years, as re f lec ted in 

8 

unemp loymen t figures w h i c h show a decline in jobless rates t o 4.6 percent in 2007, 
considerably l ow e r than the i r h is to r ica l l e v e l o f around 6 percent (Chart 1 and Tab le 3 
below). The decline in pove r ty i s also d i rec t ly attributable t o t w o po l ic ies put in place by 
the current government: (i) a dec is ion t o raise ( f i o m about $30 pe r m o n t h t o about $100 
pe r month) the non -con t r ibu to ry minimum pens ion cove r ing some 72,000 persons 
i n c l u d i n g b o t h the ind igen t e lde r ly and others, such as the men ta l ly o r phys ica l ly 
handicapped, w h o are unab le t o p rov ide f o r themselves; and (ii) the imp lemen ta t ion o f a 
cond i t iona l cash transfer (CCT) p rog ram w h i c h p rov ides a cash bene f i t t o poo r 
households in exchange f o r en ro l l ing the i r secondary school-aged c h i l d r e n in school. 
The C C T p rog ram cu r ren t ly p rov ides nea r ly 71,000 transfers pe r m o n t h ranging in value 
f r o m $30-$100 pe r household, depending o n the numbe r o f e l ig ib le ch i ld ren . Within the 
f ramewo rk o f the N a t i o n a l F o o d Strategy cu r ren t ly be ing developed, the Gove rnmen t 
also expects t o imp lemen t a new targeted transfer p rog ram w h i c h w o u l d p r o v i d e up t o 
$100 pe r m o n t h t o about 16,000 low - income , female-headed households t o h e l p cush ion 
the impac t o f high f o o d prices. G i v e n Costa Rica’s popu la t ion size o f 4.5 m i l l i o n and 
the fact tha t transfers bene f i t the entire househo ld o f the recipients (5 members pe r

The policy decisions to double minimum pensions and put in place a CCT 
program linked to secondary school attendance were the first steps in the 
Government’s strategy for reducing income poverty; the medium-term goal i s to 
eradicate extreme poverty and reduce ove ra l l poverty by one percentage point per 
year on average. F o l l ow i n g o n the demonstrated success o f these t w o po l ic ies in 
furthering Costa R ica ’s pove r ty reduc t ion goals, the Gove rnmen t a ims t o focus in i t s 
rema in ing t im e in o f f i c e o n strengthening the ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk in order t o sustain 
the momen tum f o r pove r ty reduction. The m a i n elements o f this agenda are the 
f o l l ow i n g : (i) c rea t ion o f a consolidated M in is t ry of Social Development t o t a k e the lead 
in p o l i c y and p rog ram coo rd ina t ion o f the country’s pove r ty reduc t ion e f fo r ts and social 
assistance programs, w h i c h have thus far been managed in a fragmented (and sometimes 
duplicative) fashion; (ii) development and imp lemen ta t ion o f a national management 
information system t o bring together i n f o rm a t i o n f r o m the p le tho ra o f soc ia l assistance 
programs and statistical data sources o n household in fo rma t ion ; and (iii) d raw ing o n 
i n f o rm a t i o n co l lec ted regu la r ly by the CCSS and the management i n f o rm a t i o n system, 
design and imp lemen ta t ion o f an integrated national poverty targeting system, i n c l u d i n g 
p r o x y means testing mechanisms t o identify bene f ic ia ry households. Besides im p r o v i n g 
the focus o n pove r ty reduc t ion within government, the ins t i tu t iona l changes proposed are 
also intended t o increase the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f soc ia l assistance, w h i c h 
accounts f o r about 1.6 percent o f GDP in Costa Rica, a l e v e l that i s considerably higher 
than in the reg ion as a whole. 

23. 
As noted earlier, Costa Rica’s health indicators are very strong but there i s 
some risk that these could erode i f emerging epidemiological and system efficiency 
issues are not addressed in a timely manner. O f pa r t icu la r concern f r o m an 
ep idem io log ica l standpoint are 
two d i f fe ren t challenges: (i) the 
r a p i d l y ag ing 
demographic p r o f i l e and the concom i tan t g r ow t h in the impo r tance o f ch ron ic illnesses, 
w h i c h are re la t ive ly cos t ly t o address; and (ii) the emergence in some pa r ts o f the coun t ry 
o f commun icab le diseases, such as dengue fever outbreaks a long the Pac i f ic Coast, w h i c h 
i n v o l v e p u b l i c hea l th surveillance and p u b l i c hea l th in te rven t ions o f a type f o r w h i c h 
Costa R i c a i s inadequately equipped. Moreover, there are signs that despite high leve ls 
o f p u b l i c spending o n hea l th (about 5.4% o f GDP), qua l i ty and outcomes are uneven at 
b o t h the primary and higher levels o f the system, and that, unsu rp r is ing ly , poo r 
households r em a i n underserved vis a vis the non-poor (30% o f the p o o r a re uninsured 
versus about 16% o f the non-poor). The CCSS, the m a j o r p rov ide r o f hea l th services and 
o l d age pensions in Costa Rica, has been fac ing m o u n t i n g f inanc ia l imbalances given

CCSS i s seeking to mode rn ize i t s investment strategies, i n c l u d i n g b o t h im p r o v i n g returns

disparities in educational attainment between poor and non-poor households and 
across geographic regions. I n addition, relatively low secondary education coverage 
and quality are especially worrisome in light o f the economy’s demand f o r higher 
skilled workers and emerging evidence o f labor shortages. W h i l e Costa R i c a spends 
about 6 percent o f GDP o n education - one o f the highest l e v e l s in L a t i n Ame r ica - 
outcomes have n o t been commensurate and e f f ic iency i s l ow . F r o m the m id -1990s 
onwards, there has been a gradual decline in the p r o p o r t i o n o f secondary school graduates 
and those w h o do graduate t a k e close t o doub le the years f o rm a l l y required. Mo reove r ,

Costa Rica’s pioneering program o f payments f o r environmental services 
(PSA) has had tremendous success 
in promoting

strategy: (i) in t roduc t ion o f service user fees t o a l l ow f o r expansion o f the P S A p rog ram

the strengthening o f partnerships between the d i f fe ren t Gove rnmen t entities i n v o l v e d in 
the conservation e f f o r t as w e l l as p r om o t i n g e f fec t ive

l o c a l

p rog ram has, in turn, he lped enable the development o f s im i la r programs in other c l ien t 
countries. 

26. 
Given Costa Rica’s vulnerability to na tu ra l disasters o f climatic and seismic 
origins, Government i s giving high p r io r i ty to disaster risk mitigation. L i k e i t s 
Cen t ra l Ame r ican neighbors, Costa R i c a i s exposed t o a large va r ie ty o f adverse na tu ra l 
hazards, earthquake, volcanoes, floods, landslides and to r ren t ia l debris f lows . At the 
same time, the g r ow t h in cons t ruc t ion activities, accelerated by the economic boom, 
indus t r ia l expansion and agrarian expo r t ac t iv i t ies has generally resulted in a ma rked 
increase o f assets located in risky areas. This situation, comb ined with env i ronmen ta l 
degradation has l e d t o a ma rked increase in losses f r o m na tu ra l disasters, pa r t icu la r ly 
floods, in recent years. Until recently, disaster management in Costa R i c a centered 

1 1 

essentially o n reactive action, with ve ry f ew p ro -ac t ive p reven t ion programs. The current 
Government has, however, begun t o p lace increasing attention t o management o f disaster 
risks. In particular, and th rough an amendment o f L a w N o . 7914, the government has 
chosen t o s ign i f ican t ly strengthen the Commission Nac iona l de Emergencia (CNE) with a 
pa r t icu la r focus o n i t s r o l e as a p romo te r and coordinator o f risk m i t iga t ion . An

IV . Costa Rica-World Bank Group Partnership 

A. Lessons from the Last CPS (see also the CPS Comp le t ion Report, Annex D) 

27. 
The 2004 CPS, which was prepared after a ten year interval of very limited 
engagement with Costa R ica , was central to the reestablishment o f a c loser 
relationship between Costa Rica and the Bank Group, and had c lear benefits for 
each partner. The CPS comp r ised a very modest lend ing p rog ram o f $2 18 m i l l i o n but 
inc luded strong components o f economic and sector w o r k and AAA in support o f core 
Government objectives. The focus o n know ledge sharing and m u t u a l lea rn ing in a few, 
ca re fu l ly - selected sectors was an appropriate one: i t a f fo rded the Bank an oppo r tun i ty t o 
g a i n in-depth insights i n t o Costa Rica’s successful pove r ty reduc t ion and economic 
d ive rs i f ica t ion e f fo r ts and p ionee r ing env i ronmen ta l programs w h i c h are ex t reme ly

access t o re levan t g loba l know ledge and experience in designing strategies and p rog rams 
t o address eme rg ing development i s s u e s in a number o f areas. Some areas o f cooperation

28 . However, the 2004 CPS underestimated the implications o f Costa Rica’s 
lengthy, consensus-based processes f o r the timely passage o f reforms and f o r 
legislative action to approve Bank-supported projects. A s no ted earlier, the process 
o f building w i d e consensus and s low p o l i t i c a l processes have a f fec ted Government’s 
a b i l i t y t o q u i c k l y m o v e f o rw a r d i t s r e f o rm agenda. T h i s has been especially apparent in 
the leng thy e f fo r ts t o r a t i f y C A F T A and i t s complementary agenda. C A F T A was 
u l t ima te ly approved v i a a p u b l i c re fe rendum late last year, but discussions in the 
Assemb ly are s t i l l ongo ing o n some key, but controversial, laws w h i c h need t o be passed 
be fo re C A F T A can go i n t o effect. Similarly, e f fo r ts by b o t h the Pacheco and A r ias 
administrations t o pass a comprehensive f isca l r e f o rm package have been stalled in the 
Assemb ly f o r a considerable pe r iod o f t ime . The need f o r the Execu t ive t o expend scarce 
p o l i t i c a l cap i ta l o n m o v i n g f o rw a r d some o f these impo r tan t p r io r i t ies f o r the coun t ry has, 
in turn, affected i t s a b i l i t y t o push f o r r a p i d app rova l o f projects developed with the Bank 
(or, indeed, other IFIs), causing s ign i f ican t delays in p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion in some 
cases (e.g., Educa t ion Qua l i ty , Eco-markets 11). 
Based o n th is experience, 
the 
Government concluded tha t sma l l projects, pa r t icu la r ly p ro jec ts with a heavy dose o f TA, 
are d i f f i c u l t t o s tee r th rough the Assemb ly and shou ld n o t be attempted g o i n g fo rwa rd . 
Rather, i t s strategy, w h i c h th is CPS reflects, focuses o n a few, large p ro jec ts w h i c h a re 
l i k e l y t o have w i d e soc ia l and p o l i t i c a l support. I t also suggests the need f o r Government 
teams preparing lend ing operations 
t o consider ea r ly engagement with relevant 
committees in the Assembly t o build understanding o f the operations w e l l be fo re they a re 
f o rm a l l y presented f o r leg is la t ive action. The Bank w o u l d be prepared t o support the 
Government teams in these discussions i f requested by the Execu t ive . 

B. Current Bank Group Program 

29 . 
The Costa Rica portfolio o f Bank-supported projects i s relatively small, 
comprising four lending operations totaling $146 million and a GEF grant of $10 
million, linked to the Eco-Markets I 1 project. 
I n addition, AAA activities are 
ongoing in t w o important areas, domestic debt market development and poverty 
targeting. One o f the l e n d i n g operations, the H e a l t h Sector Strengthening Project, w h i c h 
has helped t o imp lemen t and consolidate the coun t ry ’s amb i t ious 1995 hea l th sector 

13 

re fo rm (including the shift to an insurance-based model fo r the ma jo r i ty o f health 
services provision), was approved in the period before the 2004 CPS. The project i s close 
to completion, but an extension for an additional year was granted to complete activities 
related to upgrading the MIS. The other th ree operations, inc lud ing (i) the Education 
Equ i ty and E f f ic iency Project; (ii) the Eco-Markets I1 project and associated GEF; and 
(iii) the Puerto L im o n Integrated Infrastructure Project were a l l foreseen as part o f the 
program fo r FYs04-FY08. O f these operations, the Education Project i s effective - since 
end-2006 - - fo l low ing i t s approval by the Assembly close to eighteen months after i t s 
approval by the Bank's Board. The Eco-Markets I1 project was recently approved and 
should be made effective shortly, wh i le discussion by the Assembly o f the Puerto L im o n 
project i s currently underway. As noted earlier, the process o f securing legislative 
approval o f projects has been considerably delayed, in large part because o f the h i g h 
p r io r i ty given t o mov ing forward the C A F T A complementary agenda. 

30. O f the four other projects included in the FY04 CPS, three were dropped 
and the fourth i s likely to ca r ry over into the present CPS period. Two o f the 
projects - small TA operations fo r e-Government and agricultural research -- were 
dropped by the Arias administration after i t took office in 2006 and took careful stock o f 
i t s needs, alternative financing options and the po l i t ica l exigencies o f shepherding i t s 
re fo rm priorities and externally-financed projects through the legislature. The third 
project, fo r the water sector, was dropped fo l low ing a corruption scandal in an externally 
funded project in the water sector, which led the Government to halt further external 
financing to the sector until institutional reforms were adopted and implemented. The 
last project, also a TA operation for the telecommunications sector, i s well advanced in 
i t s preparation. 
I t s presentation to the Board, and subsequently to the Costa R i c a n 
Assembly, was delayed to await the approval o f a new telecoms framework l aw wh ich 
was recently approved as part o f the CAFTA -DR complementary agenda. This was 
appropriate given that the a im o f the project i s to support Costa R ica in the 
implementation o f the provisions o f the new telecommunications law. 

31. 
During FY06-08, I FC committed t w o regional projects for $35 million that 
are benefiting Costa Rica. One project i s a $20 m i l l i o n loan to a well established 
Central American auto finance company. The company provides financing and leasing 
for new and used veh ic les w i t h about 60% o f i t s loans going to SMEs, a market segment 
wh ich has weak access to bank financing. The other project i s a $15 m i l l i o n loan to 
Central America's largest trucking company and the on ly one with physical infrastructure 
and operations in f ive Central American countries. 
The project assists in the 
development and expansion o f a regional logistics group as well as further supports 
regional integration by increasing efficiency and cost effectiveness o f the logistics chain. 

32. 
IFC's committed portfolio at the end o f June 2008 amounted to US$102 
million (US$47 million f o r IFC's own account, and US$55 million f o r Participants' 
accounts) in four projects. Over 40% o f IFC's ow n account was in the financial sector; 
30% in the wholesale and re ta i l sector; an additional 26% o f the po r t fo l io was fo r an 
investment with the Juan Santamaria International A i rpo r t (JSIA) in San Jose. After more 
than four years o f negotiations, the authorities and the operator failed to reach an 

14 

agreement that wou ld restore financial equilibrium to the project. In February 2008, the 
authorities sen t a formal no t i f ica t ion to the operators in i t ia t ing an administrative process 
fo r the anticipated termination o f the management contract w i t h the company, opening a 
cure period fo r the operator to find a solution (new financing) or fo r I FC to identify a new 
operator, wh ich wou ld accept the debt o f I FC and i t s participant banks. IFC has identified 
a new operator through a transparent and open process, in close coordination with the 
company. The Costa Rica government i s currently evaluating the o f fe r o f the potential 
new operator. 

33. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio for Costa R ica , as of April 30,2008 consists of 
5 contracts of guarantee, with a total gross exposure of US$186.7 million (2.9% of 
gross portfolio) and net exposure of US$93.9 million (2.7% of net portfolio). These 
guarantees invo lve participation in th ree projects, one in the tourism sector and tw o in the 
infrastructure sector (power and transportation, respectively). The bulk o f the exposure i s 
fo r the guarantees in support o f the S a n Jos6Caldera t o l l road, wh ich was signed o n the 
second quarter o f FY08. MIGA i s currently underwriting another large transportation 
project wh ich could potentially lead to the doubling o f i t s exposure in Costa Rica; 
however, outstanding issues remain and the project may not be finalized until late FY09 
or early FY10. MIGA has also guaranteed two projects by Costa Rican investors, in 
financial leasing. These were to support expansions o f a local company in to Nicaragua 
and E l Salvador as part o f i t s efforts to increase i t s regional presence. These two projects 
totaled US$6.6 m i l l ion . MIGA remains committed 
to supporting 
intra-regional 
investments. 

C. Country Partnership Strategy: FY09 to mid-FY11 
This CPS i s both demand driven and highly selective -- focusing o n areas in 
34. 
which the Government believes i t can benefit from the Bank’s global experience and 
from new lending and AAA instruments which a re suited to the country’s needs. In 
particular, the Government believes that the Bank’s new contingent financing instruments 
(DDO) can be a key e lemen t o f Costa Rica’s risk management strategy. I t i s also taking 
advantage o f opportunities fo r reimbursable TA in areas where i t sees bene f i ts f rom 
seeking the Bank’s technical support. As noted at the outset o f this report (Para l), the 
pe r iod covered b y the CPS includes the remaining t e r m o f the Arias Administration plus 
an additional seven months to prepare a fo l low -on CPS with a new Government, 
expected to take office in M a y 2010. This w i l l help better a l ign fu tu re CPS preparation 
with Costa Rica’s po l i t ica l cycle, in turn, smoothing CPS design and implementation 
going forward. 

35. 
The ove ra l l aims of the CPS a re to support the Costa Rican government in 
implementing its t w o main development priorities fo r the next t w o years: (i) 
addressing emerging challenges to continued growth and competitiveness, including 
f isca l risk management; and (ii) continuing to reduce income poverty and increase 
equity in social service provision. In this context, the Government has reques ted Bank 
support for a few selected areas as follows: 

15 

Four lend ing opera t ions , totaling about US$258 million, targeted to specific areas 
in which the Bank has global expertise or suitable instruments for managing risk 
such as the Cat DDO (see below for more detailed descriptions of these 
operations) 
Reimbursable TA for the CCSS both in the management of pension assets and in 
supporting continued strengthening of the health system 
Non-reimbursable TA related 
to competitiveness, poverty 
streamlining of social assistance. 

targeting and 

This proposed lending program, albeit still modest, represents an increase in the volume 
of lending over the previous CPS which included a program o f about $2 18 million over a 
3 112 year period, excluding grants. The Government and Bank have agreed, however, 
that the lending envelope for Costa Rica could be enlarged over the CPS period, should 
the Government be interested in further financial and related technical support from the 
Bank. 

36. 
Th e four lending operations agreed for this CPS are all in areas deemed high 
priority for Costa Rica's development, and are believed by Government to address 
areas for wh ich there w i l l be sufficient support in the legislature and in society at 
large. The operations are the following: 

A Ca tas troph ic Risk Deferred Draw-Down Operation (Cat DDO) (FYO9 US$65 
mill): The DDO would provide Costa Rica a rapid source of funds in the event of 
a major natural disaster, enabling a quicker response to address emergency needs. 
The DDO would be accompanied by the implementation of comprehensive 
disaster mitigation measures as discussed earlier in Para 24. 
A Te lecommun ica t ions Re form Project (FY09 US$13 mill): Preparation of this 
project is very advanced since the last CPS period and it is intended to bring 
global experience to bear on the opening up of the telecommunications sector, 
once the framework law is passed. 
Secondary Education and Skills Development Project (FY 10, US$80 mill): This 
project would conlplement the ongoing Education Quality and Efficiency Project 
(which is focused on equity at the secondary level) by improving the relevance of 
secondary education to labor market demands through a revamping of the 
cu r r icu lun~ , pedagogical methods, teacher training and updated equipment and 
technology. 
Pun tarenas Integrated Infrastructure Development Project (FYI 0 US$lOO mill): 
The design for this operation will be modeled on the Puerto Limon operation 
approved last year. The long-term goal would be to transform the Punta Arenas 
area (including the nearby Calderas port) into a regional center of economic 
growth. The project would seek to revitalize the port and urban environment, 
leverage the interface and synergies between the port and the city, and increase 
e c o n o n ~ i c opportunities for the poorest households represented in this area.

AAA activities - reimbursable and non-reimbursable -- would generally 
build on activities begun during the previous CPS, pa r t icu la r ly in the areas o f 

domestic debt ma rke t development (v ia the Bank’s Treasury department), pove r ty

No tes that w o u l d summarize the Bank’s p o l i c y perspectives o n k e y areas o f ou r 
invo lvemen t as a means o f fu r the r ing the dialogue with the n ew Gove rnmen t . B o t h 
lend ing and non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies a re summarized in Table 4 above. 

38. 
IFC’s strategy f o r Central America, including Costa Rica, concentrates on 
financial sector, infrastructure, health and education and agribusiness with 

particular emphasis o n IDA countries. In this context, the strategy in Costa R i c a 
continues t o center o n pursuing inves tmen t opportunities in: (a) deve lop ing reg iona l 
cap i ta l markets and strengthening l o c a l f inanc ia l institutions; (b) v iab le manu fac tu r ing 
and service projects; and (c) the ag r icu l tu ra l sector. The strategy f o r the f inanc ia l sector 
combines adv iso ry and inves tmen t ac t iv i t ies t o support 
loca l ly -owned 
f inanc ia l 
ins t i tu t ions that serve the SME and hous ing segments. F o r the manu fac tu r ing and 
services sectors, IFC ’s strategy focuses o n the r e t a i l and comme rc ia l rea l estate sectors as 
w e l l as f o r I T services and products bringing h ighe r value-added t o Costa Rica, m o r e at 
the brink o f the U S - C A F T A imp lemen ta t ion . F ina l ly , with respect t o agribusiness IFC ’s 
i s focus ing o n supporting exports-oriented primary ag r icu l tu ra l producers such as 
bananas and pineapples. 

39. 

The Government o f Costa R i c a and the Bank have jointly developed a results 

monitoring framework f o r this CPS, w h i c h i s inc luded in the annexes t o t h i s document. 
The Government i s fully comm i t ted t o the results specified and b o t h coun t ry outcomes 
and the milestones spec i f ied f o r areas o f d i rec t Bank support shou ld be achievable within 
the CPS pe r iod . Results w i l l be mon i to red us ing intermediate ind ica to rs and the 
Government’s ex is t ing data co l lec t ion and m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion systems. The 

18 

resu l ts framework lays out planned lending and non-lending Bank activities wh ich 
contribute to the achievement o f Government’s broader goals. I t should be noted that the 
indicators to be monitored a re already effectively collected on a regular basis by the 
Ministry o f Finance, the Central Bank, the General Comptroller’s o f f ice and sectoral l i n e 
ministries. Bank staff has reviewed the existing systems fo r data collection and found 
them to be o f adequate quality to enable meaningful mon i to r ing o f development progress.

40. 
Th e r e i s no f o rm a l a i d coord inat ion mechan ism in Costa R ica , in p a r t 
because the re a r e ve ry few ex te rna l pa r tne rs active in the country . The ma in active 
partners are the Central American Bank fo r Economic Integration (CABEI), the Inter- 
Am e r i c a n Development Bank (IDB), the Japanese Bank fo r International Cooperation 
(JBIC), the United Nations agencies and the Wo r ld Bank. Government negotiates 
directly w i t h each o f the partners on a bilateral basis and suggests specific areas in l i n e 
with the partners’ comparative advantages and the fit with Government priorities. This 
system has worked well and there does not seem to be any duplication in wo rk by 
external partners. B o t h IDB and C A B E I are heavily invo lved in financing roads and IDB 
i s also playing a ro le in the agricultural sector. One area in wh ich the Bank and IDB may 
provide coordinated support to Costa Rica in the hture i s secondary education, where 
Government has asked that the two agencies consider options for a j o i n t project. 

E. R isks 

41. 
T h e risks associated w i t h the modest assistance p r o g r am a r e re la t ive ly low. 
Although Costa R ica exceeds the guideline for preferred creditor debt service to total 
pub l ic debt service, i t i s well be low the other exposure guidelines pertaining to debt and 
debt service owed to IBRD. 

42. 
T h e most pe r t inen t risk to imp lemen ta t ion o f the C P S lend ing p rog r am 
derives f rom the lengthy legislative approva ls process wh ich applies to ex te rna l ly 
funded operations. This risk could be magnified as the country en ters the election cycle 
f rom mid next year. The CPS attempts to minimize the risk o f delays by: (i) focusing 
operations on areas o f h i g h strategic importance to a wide range o f po l i t ica l actors; (ii) 
ensuring that the size o f operations i s adequate to ensu re h i g h leve l po l i t ica l commitment 
within the executive; and (iii) bu i ld ing wide consensus o n the content o f the operations 
throughout the development phase. 

43. 
O th e r risks de r ive p r inc ipa l ly f r o m the ex te rna l env i ronmen t , pa r t icu la r ly a 
sharper-than-ant ic ipated acce lerat ion in food prices and /o r a n unexpectedly 
pro longed recession in the U n i t e d States. As discussed in Para 12, based on current 
expectations with respect to food p r ices and U S economic performance, Costa Rica’s 
economy i s expected to continue to perform well over the CPS period, albeit at a slower 
pace than in the recent past. Moreover, i t s safety n e t system appears adequate to protect 

19 

the mos t vu lne rab le groups. The coun t ry has been p roac t ive ly addressing these risks, in 
particular, by d r aw i n g up a comprehensive strategy with respect t o f o o d p r ice increases, 
cove r ing b o t h i t s po ten t ia l economic and pove r ty impacts. As no ted earlier (Para 33), the 
Bank i s prepared t o support imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy v i a a DP L -DDO , i f the 
Gove rnmen t shou ld request one. M o r e generally, Costa R i c a has been a leader among 
Cen t ra l Am e r i c a n countries in deepening the reg iona l dialogue o n risk management 
( inc lud ing b o t h economic and na tu ra l disaster risks). This e f f o r t i s be ing supported as 
needed by the Bank, IDB and other partners w h i c h have p rov ided ana ly t ica l inpu ts and 
he lped create spaces t o m a i n t a i n a p roduc t ive dialogue.

CPS Consultations with Costa Rican Stakeholders 

Annex C 

Page 1 o f 3 

The proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) program was developed in d o s e 
cooperation with the Costa Rican Government over a period o f six months, 
including on-site visits, exchanges of letters, and reviews o f draft documents. This 
demand-driven process has p roduced a p rog ram comprised o f ac t iv i t ies requested by 
Gove rnmen t representatives f r o m a va r ie ty o f sectors and unde r the leadership o f the 
M i n i s t e r o f Finance. This CPS p rog ram targets areas where Costa R i c a stands t o bene f i t 
f r o m the Bank's expertise and g loba l experience, as w e l l as areas where the Bank c o u l d 
l e a r n f r o m Costa Rica 's developmental leadership. 

The CPS was consulted through a broad participatory process 
involving 
representatives o f a wide range o f Government and Non-government organizations. 
As part o f preparation o f the CPS, f o rm a l consultations were h e l d in San JosC o n M a y 13- 
14. These consultations primarily inc luded meetings with government representatives, 
complemented by representatives f r o m business, the in te rna t iona l dono r commun i ty , and 
c i v i l society. The p r i n c i p a l purpose o f the consultations was t o so l ic i t v i ew s o n h o w 
ongo ing and fu tu re Bank ac t iv i t ies c o u l d mo re e f fec t ive ly support Costa Rica 's 
development agenda. The f ramewo rk f o r the consultations 
inc luded a Powe rPo in t 
presentation de l ive red by the Bank Coun t ry D i rec to r , o u t l i n i n g proposed CPS areas o f 
emphasis and l i s t i n g proposed lend ing and non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies in support o f the 
Government 's development plan. F o l l ow i n g the presentation, pa r t ic ipan ts h a d the 
oppo r tun i ty t o raise questions and o f fe r comments. This open-ended approach fac i l i ta ted 
a p roduc t ive and frank discussion with a range o f stakeholders. 

Participants in the consultations were supportive o f the approach, with many o f 
them stating that this was a new and welcome format. They also expressed the 
impo r tance o f ongo ing dialogue with the Bank and o f f o l l ow - u p once the CPS i s made 
pub l ic . 
I t i s w o r t h n o t i n g tha t the Ministry o f H o u s i n g o f fe red e x p l i c i t support f o r 
consultations with representatives f r o m c i v i l society. The f o rm a l consultations p roduced 
recommendations in l i n e with b o t h the Bank's g loba l expertise and the p i l l a r s o f the 
Government 's program. A summary o f v iews expressed by stakeholders appears b e l ow :

I. Address emerging challenges to growth and competitiveness 

Participants h igh l igh ted the importance o f p romo t ing broad-based economic growth 
and competitiveness as a w a y t o reduce pove r ty and p romo te emp loymen t . The issue o f 
h o w t o rema in compe t i t ive (especially in light o f the impacts o f C A F T A - D R ) and h o w t o 
enhance the country 's w o r k force, as w e l l as transportation issues and innova t ion 
capacity, were o f highest interest t o participants. In addition, im p r o v e d e f f ic iency and 
transparency in business regu la t ion (more spec i f ica l ly with rega rd t o r e d tape associated 
with business s tar ts , operation, and ex i ts) w o u l d encourage an im p r o v e d investment 
c l ima te . I t was also recommended that b o t h Government and the Bank deve lop stronger 
mechanisms t o ensure that the benefits o f economic g r ow t h reach p o o r popu la t ions in 
b o t h r u r a l and urban areas. 

Participants stressed the impo r tance o f inc reas ing Bank support f o r institution building 
t o enhance cross-sectoral coo rd ina t ion within government and beyond and t o strengthen 
the capacity o f k e y p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions t o assume strong leadership roles. Furthermore, 
participants h igh l igh ted the impo r tance o f building so l id consensus o n re fo rms t o foster 
the adop t ion o f p u b l i c po l ic ies w h i c h w o u l d continue t o be imp lemen ted despite changes 
in government. In this context, participants ca l led f o r con t inued Bank support f o r the 
c rea t ion o f a Ministry o f Soc ia l Deve lopmen t in the face o f current in te r - ins t i tu t iona l 
coo rd ina t ion problems. 

Participants h igh l igh ted the impo r tance o f human capital formation as a k e y element in 
the f u t u r e development o f Costa R ica . The groups ca l led f o r the Bank t o examine in 
greater dep th the causes o f student d rop -ou t and low educational pe r fo rmance problems, 
thereby ques t ion ing 
the homogene i ty assumed by the Costa R i c a n educational 
model. E f f o r t s t o close educational gaps w i l l be k e y t o ove rcom ing the backwardness o f 
p u b l i c secondary education in order t o enhance the qua l i ty o f country 's wo rk fo rce . 

Participants agreed tha t expanding investment in regional infrastructure (roads, power, 
and communications) i s k e y t o p r om o t i n g economic g r ow t h and competitiveness. 
particular, pa r t ic ipan ts rece ived with enthusiasm the scope and p ro jec ted results o f the

In 

Participants showed great enthusiasm 
f o r B a n k support o f n e w environmental 
sustainability and disaster prevention in i t ia t ives ; such an approach w o u l d s e r v e as a 
complement t o the n o w well-established p ionee r ing conservation practices w h i c h have 
earned Costa R i c a w i d e in te rna t iona l recogn i t ion and have h a d a ga lvan iz ing e f fec t o n 
tou r ism t o the country. 
In this regard, the participants s t rong ly stressed the need f o r 
f inanc ia l sustainability o f env i ronmen ta l efforts. In addition, pa r t ic ipan ts we lcomed the

11. R e d u c e p o v e r t y and enhance h e a l t h , educa t ion , and soc ia l serv ices 

Participants agreed that soc ioeconom ic e q u i t y shou ld b e g i v e n substantial we igh t in the 
assessment o f inves tmen t p r io r i t ies . M u l t i p l e ca l ls were made t o acknowledge the 
existence o f m a j o r differences in we l fa re and l ive l ihoods in Costa R i c a (especially in the 
wake o f rising f o o d prices), requiring d i f fe ren t ia ted and selective actions t o address 
diverse needs. Overall, participants agreed tha t w h i l e Costa Rica’s human development 
and pove r ty ind ica to rs are m o r e equitable than those o f mos t countries in the region, 
households at the b o t t om o f the economic spectrum have s ign i f ican t ly diminished access 
t o social services. Further, they f e l t that the CPS shou ld emphasize the s i tua t ion o f 
exc luded groups, g ive p r i o r i t y t o imp roved data collection, and systematically m o n i t o r 
the re levan t indicators. Participants we lcomed e f fo r ts t o p r o v i d e W o r l d Bank support in

the performance o f social services and the o p t im um use o f resources. 

Participants consider im p r o v e d h e a l t h and e d u c a t i o n serv ices a p r i o r i t y item f o r 
investment. These areas rema in c r i t ica l t o reduc ing pove r ty , s t imu la t ing economic 
growth, and im p r o v i n g income d is t r ibu t ion . Participants we re also concerned about the 
negative impac t tha t rising f o o d p r ices (especially o f staple foods) c o u l d have o n recent 
pove r ty gains. Participants v i e w the Government’s 
targeted safety n e t programs 
( inc lud ing cond i t iona l cash transfers and school feed ing programs) as 
impo r tan t 
in te rven t ions t o p ro tec t mos t vulnerable groups. Participants requested that the Bank 
assist the Gove rnmen t at least with ana ly t ica l inpu ts t o highlight the least d is to r t iona ry 
courses o f ac t ion and help fo rge an e f fec t ive response. 
In the m e d i um te rm , m o s t 
pa r t ic ipan ts hoped tha t the Bank cou ld help the Gove rnmen t in te rp re t and contextualize 
the imp l ica t ions o f rising f o o d prices in areas such ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i v i t y and 
targeted safety ne t programs.

Las t ly , pa r t ic ipan ts in the va r ious groups highlighted the i r desire t o make p ro jec t design 
and imp lemen ta t ion procedures mo re inc lus ive and pa r t ic ipa to ry . In the i r view, such a 
shift w o u l d enhance the link between development processes and the i r beneficiaries. In 
turn, a mo re inc lus ive p ro jec t culture w o u l d also resu l t in permanent and m o r e

In t roduc t ion a n d K e y Lessons 

1. This r epo r t assesses the relevance, progress, a n d pe r fo rmance o f the Costa R i c a C P S 
F Y 0 4 - 0 8 and has been prepared as an input to the preparation o f the new CPS, due to be 
presented to the Bank’s Board in July 2008. T h e Costa R i c a C P S (discussed by the B o a r d on 
M a y 18 ,2004 ) addressed strategic areas o f the Government ’s development p rog r am m a in l y 
th rough selective ana ly t ica l and techn ica l assistance to help Costa R ica with emerging 
economic and social challenges, and lay the po l icy groundwork fo r progress on DR -CAFTA and 
i t s complementary agenda. The CPS period covered two administrations which, with varying 
success and emphasis focused development efforts under four pillars to wh ich CPS activities 
were aligned: ( i ) maintain macroeconomic stability; ( i i ) strengthen trade and competitiveness; 
( i i i ) sustain social progress; and ( i v ) maintain w o r l d leadership with respect t o environmental 
management. The Progress Report was undertaken fo l low ing the po l i t ica l transition f rom the 
Pacheco to the Arias administrations m idway through the CPS period. The CPS-PR was 
instrumental in engaging the new Government’s in te res t in continuing a partnership with the 
Bank, ensuring continued consistency o f the CPS program with national priorities and updating 
expected outcomes (v ia the resu l ts matrix) taking in to account po l i t ica l and economic realities 
wh ich affected the program. The Progress Report, which was delivered to t h e Boa rd on October 
26, 2006, also extended the CPS to FY08. This CPS Completion Report assesses progress 
against the revised program and resu l ts matrix included in the 2006 CPS Progress Report. 

2. T h e m a i n conclusion o f this assessment i s th a t the Costa R i c a C P S (FY04-08) , wh i ch 
fo l lowed a ten yea r in t e r v a l o f ve ry l im i t ed engagement w i t h Costa R ica , was cen t ra l to the 
reestab l ishment o f a closer re lat ionsh ip between Costa R i c a a n d the B a n k G roup , a n d h a d 
c lear benefits f o r each pa r tne r . The revised CPS (FY04-08) comprised a very modest lending 
program o f $105-1 28 m i l l ion , but included strong components o f analytical and advisory 
activities, inc lud ing seven diagnostic reports, in support o f core Government objectives. The 
focus o n knowledge sharing and mutual learning in a few, carefully-selected sectors was an 
appropriate one: i t afforded the Bank an opportunity to gain in-depth insights in to Costa Rica’s 
success fu l poverty reduction and economic diversification efforts and pioneering environmental 
programs wh ich are extremely relevant fo r other Bank c l ien ts . Bank involvement also facilitated 
Costa Rica’s access to relevant global knowledge and experience in designing strategies and 
programs to address emerging development issues in a number o f areas. Some areas o f 
cooperation that stand out in t e rm s o f clear bene f i ts : 
the debt and rese rves management TA which helped establish a new strategic and 
institutional framework fo r debt management and helped the Central Bank to implement 
a new rese rves investment strategy and the fo l low -up to the Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) wh ich included t rans fe r o f new debt simulation models to the 
Finance Ministry 
the poverty and social sector dialogue, analytic work, TA and health and education 
lending wh ich contributed to the design o f the country’s f i r s t CCT program, an overhaul 
of data systems fo r poverty program targeting, inc lud ing more accurate approaches fo r 

Annex D

poverty monitoring, the development and implementation o f strategies to improve 
secondary educational coverage and the consolidation o f the health sector reform. 
Support to the national dialogue on DR -CAFTA and advancement o f the complementary 
agenda that w i l l a l low Costa Rican’s to benefit broadly f rom greater trade openness, 
through the preparation o f a regional study and wide dissemination through workshops, 
technical inputs to the insu rance and telecoms laws wh ich were included in the draft laws 
submitted to Congress, and analysis o f barriers to infrastructure modernization and 
greater foreign investment included in t h e CEM, Investment Climate Assessmen t and the 
Public Expenditure Review wh ich were fo l lowed by dialogue and workshops to identify 
priorities fo r fu tu re actions. 
Technical and lending involvement in the further development o f Costa Rica’s innovative 
and effective Payment fo r Environmental Services conservation program.

However, the FY04-OS CPS underestimated the implications o f Costa Rica’s 
lengthy, consensus-based processes f o r the timely passage o f reforms and f o r legislative 
action to approve Bank-supported projects. The process o f bu i ld ing wide consensus and 
slow po l i t ica l processes have affected Government’s ab i l i ty to qu ick ly move forward i t s re fo rm 
agenda. This has been especially apparent in the efforts t o ra t i fy DR -CAFTA and i t s 
complementary agenda. DR -CAFTA was ultimately approved v i a a pub l ic referendum in late 
2007, but discussions in the Assembly are s t i l l ongoing on some key controversial laws such as 
insurance and telecom, wh ich need to be passed before DR -CAFTA can go in to e f fec t . 
Similarly, efforts by bo th the Pacheco and Arias administrations to pass a comprehensive fiscal 
re fo rm package have been stalled in the Assembly fo r a considerable pe r iod o f time. The need 
fo r the Executive to expend scarce po l i t ica l capital on mov ing forward some o f these important 
priorities fo r the country has, in turn, affected i t s ab i l i ty to push for rap id approval o f projects 
developed with the Bank (or, 
indeed, other IFIs), causing significant delays in project 
implementation in some cases (e.g., Efficiency in Education, Eco-markets 11). Based on this 
experience, the Government concluded that small projects, particularly projects with a heavy 
dose o f TA, are d i f f i c u l t to steer through the Assembly and should no t be attempted going 
forward. Rather, i t s strategy, which this CPS reflects, focuses o n a few, large projects wh ich are 
likely to have wide social and po l i t ica l support. I t also points to the need fo r the Bank and 
Government to maintain close dialogue on evolving strategic priorities as well as the processing 
s teps and requirements fo r activities by each party to ensure coordinated planning. Another 
cause o f delays in some activities was the transition o f administrations midway through the 
CPS period, suggesting the need f o r better alignment with the country’s political cycle f o r 
future partnership strategies.

Costa Rica’s Long-Term Development Goals 

4. Costa R i c a i s a well performing upper middle income country o f about 4.5 million 
people and one o f the most stable democracies in Latin America. Costa R ica has achieved 
success by investing in broad-based economic and social services. Costa Rica’s average GDP 

Annex D 
Page 3 o f 26 

growth o f 4.7% fo r the past 15 years surpassed the L a t i n America and Caribbean (LAC ) region’s 
average by about two percentage points. Education enrollment and access, with the notable 
exception o f secondary education, are among the best in the L a t i n America, and widespread 
health care coverage has led to h igh l i f e expectancy and some health indicators that parallel those 
in the OECD. Poverty and inequality are also l o w by L A C and Central American standards. 
Costa R ica has been a leader in environmental management, ha l t ing deforestation in the early 
2000s and pursuing innovative partnerships w i t h the private sector to protect forests and 
biodiversity. The country’s development success can be attributed to strong institutions, h i g h 
social investment averaging about one-third o f pub l ic expenditure, a relatively well-educated 
workforce, and generally stable po l i t ica l and macroeconomic environments. 

5 . Emerging economic and soc ia l challenges spurred the t w o Administrations of the CPS 
period to seek adjustments to Costa Rica’s development model while maintaining equitable 
growth as the ove ra l l focus. Leading up to the CPS period, real growth averaged 5 percent 
f rom 1990-1999. Then i t slowed dramatically to j u s t 2 percent (2000-2002). In f la t ion remained 
at an annual rate o f 10 percent over the s am e pe r iod as the pub l ic sector deficit shot up to 5.7 
percent o f GDP in 2002 and public debt rose f r om 44.9 percen t o f GDP in 1999 to 5 1.9 percent 
o f GDP in 2002. At the same time, progress on poverty reduction stagnated after 1994; poverty 
levels hovered around 22-23 percent. As Costa Rica’s economic model began to t a k e advantage 
o f globalization and information age technologies beginning in the mid- 1990s, new employment 
opportunities benefited those with higher educations, even as secondary education enrollment 
and completion rates lagged. Notably, unemployment among the extreme poor doubled f rom 12 
to 27 percent between 1994 and 2003. The quality o f infrastructure was on the dec l ine , inc lud ing 
poorly maintained roads and out-moded ports and telecommunications. The development 
policies and priorities o f the Pacheco administration (May 2002-May 2006) and o f the A r ias 
administration (May 2006- M a y 2010) have sought to address these emerging economic and 
social challenges. 

6. The t w o Administrations, with varying success and emphasis, focused efforts on four 
strategic pillars: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability, (ii) strengthening trade and 
competitiveness, (iii) sustaining social progress, and (iv) continuing leadership in 
sustainable environmental practices. As discussed in the Progress Report, re fo rm progress 
stalled under the Pacheco administration as the contentious po l i t ica l environment grew even 
more intransigent. The cornerstone o f the 2002-2006 Administration’s economic re fo rm 
package, a fiscal reform, languished fo r four years in the Legislature and ra t i f ica t ion o f C A F T A 
had to be passed to the Arias administration. The Arias administration brought greater focus to 
longer-term poverty reduction and income equality objectives to breathe l i f e back in to 
languishing economic reforms. 
I t made passage o f the DR -CAFTA and the reforms to 
implement and ensure broad-based benefit f rom the treaty the central t h r u s t o f these reforms 
efforts. The Administration pointed to universal secondary education combined w i t h initiatives 
to and open up and investment in infrastructure, telecommunications and energy as p r ima ry 
drivers fo r increasing Costa Rica’s competitiveness to take advantage o f greater trade openness 
and create skilled labor matched to new jobs fo r poverty reduction. T o make i t s education 
targets and other needed pub l ic expenditures possible, the Administration supported the creation 

Annex D 
Page 4 o f 26 

o f an “appropriate and progressive” tax system t o end “the country’s perennial fiscal crisis.”’ 
Fiscal re fo rm was to be combined with a gradual shift away f rom a crawling-peg exchange rate 
regime toward greater exchange rate f lex ib i l i ty and in f la t ion targeting over the medium-term to 
resolve h i g h dollarization and in f la t ions2 At the same time, the Administration emphasized state 
modernization as a vehicle fo r i t s broader po l icy agenda, inc lud ing a b i g push fo r e-government 
to improve efficiency and transparency o f government institutions and regain citizen confidence. 
The new President also aimed to re tu rn Costa R ica to i t s leading ro le in the international theater, 
inc lud ing making sustainable development and environmental protection foreign po l icy 
priorities.

Progress on Costa Ftica’s Long-term Development Goals included in the CPS 

7. Over the CPS period, Costa Rica made progress across the areas within the four pillars 
that were a part o f the partnership strategy. M an y near-term targets were achieved and 
poverty was reduced despite the slower-than-expected pace o f structural reform. The CPS 
Progress Report discussed progress through 2006. This section notes more recent gains and 
gives an overall assessment o f achievements in each pillar focusing on the se lec ted areas covered 
b y the CPS. Look ing ahead, the pace o f implementation o f structural economic changes, the 
success o f new social policies along with any responses to emerging challenges inc lud ing h i g h 
food and energy prices are expected to de term ine continued progress on Costa Rica’s long-term 
development goals. 

Reduction o f Poverty and Inequality. A f te r seeing l i t t l e change in income poverty l e v e l s 
since 1994, income poverty dropped from 23.5% in 2002 to 19% in 2007. Costa R ica i s 
also on i t s way to eliminating extreme income poverty wh ich was cut f r om 6.9% in 2002 to 
3.7% in 2007.3 The Government estimates that almost h a l f o f the drop can be attributed to 
increases in the minimum pension that were introduced in [2007]. 

P i l la r I Ma in ta in Macroeconomic Stability. Macroeconomic targets were largely 

achieved owing to exceptional growth, responsible fiscal policy and strengthened 
monetary policy. The Government aimed to achieve fiscal sustainability by modernizing 
the tax s truc ture , rationalizing pub l ic expenditures, strengthening debt management and 
imp rov ing government efficiency and budget administration. G row th reached 8.8% in 2006 
and 6.8% in 2007, driven by domestic and external demand, strong FDI flows, fa l l ing rea l 
in te res t rates, good domestic manufacturing, and a boost in construction. Exports grew b y 
12% annually f rom 2004 to 2007, and the cu r ren t account de f ic i t remained around 4.8% o f 
GDP. Tax revenues rose sharply as a resu l t o f growth and improved tax administration, 
although tax po l icy re fo rm remained stalled in the Legislative Assembly.

The Adm in is t ra t ion intends t o complement these medium-term re forms by deepening domestic f inanc ia l markets 
and recap i ta l iz ing the Cen tra l Bank. 
These recent pover ty gains may be an ind ica t ion o f imp roved income equality, however f igures a re no t yet 
available. 

Annex D 
Page 5 o f 26 

The non-financial pub l ic sector balance f e l l f rom -4.0% o f GDP in 2002 to a s u r p l u s o f 1.3% 
in 2007, and total pub l ic debt f e l l f rom 54.3% o f GDP in 2002 to an estimated 44.5% in 
2007. These gains were in i t ia l ly made through lower public and discretionary spending, a 
lower public wage bill, and cu ts to infrastructure spending. But, beginning in 2006, higher- 
than-expected growth, increased fiscal revenues, improved debt management and a lower 
debt se rv ice enabled the central government to increase spending in p r io r i ty areas, and to 
register in 2007 a su rp lus o f 0.4% o f GDP and a public sector overall balance o f 0.6% (for 
the f i r s t time in two decades). Reforms to improve budget planning and formulation and 
public procurement, 
inc lud ing wo rk on standardizing contracting procedures, also 
strengthened fiscal sustainability. The Central Bank’s introduction o f an exchange rate bands 
in 2006 represented a significant shift in monetary po l icy and helped reduce in f la t ion f rom 
14.1% in 2005 to 9.4% in 2006. However, in f la t ion reached 10.8% in 2007 because o f 
growing food prices and higher transportation costs due to o i l price increase, leaving in f la t ion 
as the ma in short-term po l icy challenge. 

0 P i l la r 2 Strengthen Trade & Competitiveness. The Dominican Republic-Central America 
F r e e Trade Agreement was ratified in 2007 and implementation i s expected by the end 
o f 2008. This w i l l secure the administration’s priority goal in trade opening and 
complementary structural reform. Progress on improving competitiveness has been 
limited, but i s expected to pick-up pace with CAFTA implementation. Fo l low ing 
prolonged debate on DR -CAFTA in the Assembly, the f ree trade agreement was na r row ly 
approved v ia an historic national referendum in October 2007. Desp i te t h i s win, passage of 
the 13 bills that comprise the implementation agenda fo r DR -C A F T A was protracted, 
monopolizing the attention o f the Legislature as well as the Executive. These bills include, 
inter alia, sens i t ive structural measures to open the insurance and telecommunications sectors 
to greater competition. Passage o f the f ive remaining b i l ls i s expected by f a l l 2008 at wh ich 
time the treaty wou ld become effective. At the same time, the Administration has been 
wo rk ing to a l low private sector participation in other public-dominated sectors to boost 
competitiveness and improve services. To date, “trial” concessions have been executed in the 
transport and port sectors, such as fo r the Caldera Port and San Jose-Caldera trunk l ine . 
Enabling legislation fo r concessions i s in place fo r many sectors, but the concession process 
remains costly, burdened by lengthy and cumbersome procedures (reducing attractiveness to 
investors), and regulatory agencies sometimes lack the leadership and capacity to fo l low - 
through on implementation. 

0 P i l la r 3 Sustain Social progress. The government achieved its near-term social sector 
goals. Efforts focused on boosting secondary education outcomes, reforming health 
system management under the CCSS, and improving social assistance targeting and 
poverty measurement systems. Costa Rica continued to benefit f r om nearly universal 
primary school enrollment and widespread health care coverage, as reflected in i t s strong l i f e 
expectancy and childhood health indicators. N e t secondary enrollment made important 
gains, r is ing f rom 64% in 2002 to 71% in 2007, supported by the introduction o f a 
conditional cash t rans fe r program targeted to 90,000 l o w income secondary school age youth. 
However, access to secondary education among the poorest quintile remains approximately 
h a l f that o f the wealthiest quintile, and on ly 37% o f those who beg in secondary school 
complete their s tud ies . The Government continues to p r io r i t ize expanding secondary 

Annex D 
Page 6 o f 26 

education and imp rov ing instructional quality, particularly in ru ra l and poor areas, and i s 
wo rk ing to improve the e f f i c i e n c y o f education expenditures. 

In the health sector, primary health coverage increased f r om 81% in 2001 to 91% in 2006, 
but consolidating health system re fo rm remains o n the agenda, as re f lec ted in the slight f a l l in 
measles and po l io vaccination rates f rom 1990 t o 2004 and in the r i s e in t h e incidence o f 
dengue, tuberculosis, and AIDS. Gains in health coverage and financial efficiency were 
supported by government’s continued reform o f the Social Security Administration (CCSS) 
to achieve more e f f i c i e n t delivery o f primary health care services. The Government took 
steps to decentralize CCSS operations, improve in fo rma t ion systems, increase funding in 
undeserved regions, and support accreditation o f providers. Finally, the Government 
improved i t s capacity to assess and address poverty through the application o f a more 
accurate income and expenditure survey, and the design o f a new national poverty targeting 
strategy based on data collected and managed by the CCSS. 

P i l la r 4 Ma in ta in Leadership in Environmental Protection. Costa R i c a continued world- 
class 
leadership in management and protection o f forests, biodiversity, and 
environmental resources even as progress o n new initiatives has been slower than 
planned. In the early 2000s, after nearly 50 years o f deforestation, Costa R ica was able to 
increase forest coverage as a resu l t o f i t s innovative Payment fo r Environmental Services 
program (PES), which pays fanne rs , who ow n 60 YO o f the countries forest land to leave 
forest in tact thereby protecting biodiversity, watersheds, and scenic resources. F rom 2000 to 
2007, the Government increased land under conservation contracts in p r io r i ty areas o f the 
Mesoamerican B io log ica l Corridor f rom about 140,000 t o 270,000 hectares4 The financial 
sustainability o f the program was improved by instituting [in 20061 a new water ta r i f f . A 
Biodiversity Fund was established [in 20061 to ensure an additional sustainable income 
source, though this Fund has yet to be fully capitalized. The Government also took steps to 
reengage in carbon trading, inc lud ing through a project approved in 2006 supporting 
reforestation in southeast Costa Rica. Desp i te these efforts, the long-term financial 
sustainability o f the PES remains an on-going challenge. Government plans in to address this 
challenge include differentiating payments based on potential environmental benefit and 
expanding the program’s scope b y increasing participation o f small farmers . S truc tures are in 
place to make headway on these plans, inc lud ing a new Bank project, but implementation has 
been slow in recen t years ow ing to the government’s focus on DR -C A F T A reform. 

8. Costa Rica’s government program remains relevant, but enhancing competitiveness and 
ensuring that the poor benefit under DR-CAFTA reforms continue to preoccupy the 
government’s short-term agenda. G iven the intensity and scope o f proposed reforms, DR- 
C A F T A may continue to dominate the legislative debate over much o f 2008. In this context, 
authorities a re supporting policies that enable Costa Ricans t o capitalize o n increased trade 
openness, inc lud ing modernizing infrastructure, removing bureaucratic barriers to business, and 
strengthening secondary education. Fiscal re fo rm i s s t i l l planned, but may be more po l i t ica l ly 
feasible after 2008. O f f ic ia ls are also continuing wo rk to ensure that poor, indigenous and A f r o - 
Caribbean groups are no t l e f t behind by increasing education services in certain areas and 

Participation o f female landowners increased, and indigenous community-owned land in the PES rose by 970%.

mov ing ahead on efforts to improve the targeting and coverage o f social programs, inc lud ing 
through better coordination. The new FY09-11 CPS w i l l provide select lending and non-lending 
assistance to support these renewed goals. 

D. 

H o w Did the CPS Contribute to Costa R ica ’s Progress 

9. Following limited engagement between Costa R i c a and the World Bank over the 199Os, 
the FY04-OS CPS was designed to provide select, demand-driven assistance emphasizing 
knowledge sharing and analytical wo r k in areas o f mutual interest. Planned activities 
included in the rev ised CPS program are l i s t e d in Table 1. Mos t o f the analytical reports were 
prepared in consultation with the f i r s t administration (during FY04-06). These reports then 
became valuable tools fo r engaging the in-coming Arias administration in po l icy discussions and 
led to continued engagement through a wide range o f formal and in fo rma l technical assistance 
and capacity bu i ld ing activities that were in many cases added to the revised CPS program. 
These 
included activities poverty measurement and targeting (that spanned FY07-08), 
procurement and financial management reform (FY07 and then taken forward in FY08 through 
the PER) and debt simulation modeling (FY07 as fo l low -up to C E M  discussion^).^ O f the th ree 
additional loans planned for the remainder o f the CPS, one was completed (Port C i t y L im o n 
delivered in FY08), one delayed (Telecomm project) and one dropped (E-government project). 
The CPS was a p i l o t results-based strategy, aligned to Costa Rica’s development program. The 
resu l ts ma t r ix was up-dated in the Progress Report and the format was adapted to emerging bes t 
practice. This section discusses progress toward the revised outcomes to wh ich t h e CPS program 
was expected to contribute. 

5 

As a consequence o f extended discussions on these topics and t h e new Administration’s interest in capturing their 
own progress and plans in reports, the re was often long lag between i n i t i a l delivery o f reports to Government and 
their completion. For example, t h e CFAA and CPAR were f i r s t delivered in FY05 and completed only in FY07.

10. Overall, the support to the Government’s Development Plan was mainly provided 
through high quality inputs often linked to capacity building outcomes in selected areas. 
The focus on knowledge sharing and mutual learning in a few, carefully selected sectors was an 
appropriate one. I t gave the Bank an opportunity to gain in-depth insights, relevant to other 
Bank clients, concerning Costa Rica’s successful poverty reduction and economic diversification 
efforts and i t s pioneering environmental initiatives. The Bank’s involvement also facilitated 
Costa Rica’s access to global knowledge and experience in designing strategies and programs to 
address emerging development issues in many areas. Notable Bank inputs included analytical 
reports whose analysis was used in workshops to broaden po l icy discussions and formulate 
fo l low -up actions in areas ranging the barriers to greater foreign investment, inc lud ing in 
infrastructure, t o health and education t o poverty mon i to r ing and social assistance targeting. 
O f ten grounded in the findings o f these analytical reports, the Bank helped build government 
capacity in areas o f fiscal sustainability, debt management, procurement and financial 
management modernization, the DR -CAFTA agenda and poverty monitoring. Such inputs also 
happened in the context o f lending operation preparation and supervision. Fo r example

1 1. Shortfalls in projected CPS outcomes reflected a broader climate o f legislative gridlock 
and the practical implications o f Costa Rica’s consensus-based political process which was 
better suited to the country’s original t w o party system. By the s ta r t o f the CPS period, Costa 
Rica’s two-party system had evolved in to a multi-party system. The governance procedures o f 
the Assembly, which empower m ino r i ty pa r t ies and served the country very well when power 
was split be tween two parties, a re challenging the historical success o f Costa Rica’s methodical 
consensus building. Now , multiple m ino r i ty pa r t ies are using the provisions to delay important 
initiatives and extract concessions fo r special in teres ts . The longe r - te rn effects o f this 
institutional evolution are unknown, but in the short-run i t has been unexpectedly burdensome on 
the Executive. In this environment, CPS outcomes were ma in ly achieved where the Bank was 
p rov id ing analytical inputs and technical assistance in areas under d i rec t control o f the Executive 
(e.g., debt management). Contributions that r e l i e d o n approval and implementation o f reforms 
and loans have been delayed. In summary, the Administration and the Bank underestimated the 
po l i t ica l difficulties in securing passage o f key reforms and lending - even lending fo r programs 
such as secondary education that enjoyed broad-based support -- particularly in the DR -CAFTA

and 26.0%).7 Recent upturns in the indicators a re the resu l t o f steady efforts. Bank and 
Government teams have remained in close contact with each other despite approval and 
effectiveness lags, continuing advance wo rk and preparations fo r project start-up. As such, the 
lending operations a re expected to make important contributions as soon as implementation i s 
unlocked by Legislative actions. Notably, total lending during the CPS exceeded the h i g h end o f 
the revised CPS envelop b y lo% , even though one small TA project was dropped (e- 
Government) and one project i s s t i l l under preparation (Telecom, whose f ina l preparation i s

BOX 1: Challenges and lessons from lending preparation, 
start-up and implementation (FYO4-OS) 

The pace o f preparation, start-up and imp lemen ta t ion o f lending operations was affected by fou r factors 
over the CPS period: 

Annex D 
Page 17 o f 26 

Bias against foreign borrowing f o r consultant services. There i s a widely he ld presumption in 
Costa R ica that fore ign bo r row ing should be limited to projects that w i l l generate a revenue stream t o 
cover repayment. This has led to care fu l scrutiny o f po ten t ia l bo r row ing plans and skepticism about 
bo r row ing fo r technical assistance and consultants where consultant roles are seen t o duplicate 
Government functions. Even fo r projects that supported widely popu lar programs, like the WB 
financed education project, received long and care fu l scrutiny by the Legislature. (The Government 
ha l ted preparation o f the sma l l E-government pro jec t when the po ten t ia l bene f i t was weighed against 
the po l i t ica l cost o f passage.) Lending operations under the new CPS will be o f sufficient scale 
and “soft” inputs will be focused on building Government capacity. 

The Government’s lengthily decision making processes are out-of-sync with Bank procedures. 
Government processes affected bo th the pace o f ac t ion by the Execu t ive du r ing preparation, and by 
the Leg is la t ive Assembly during s teps t o secure pro jec t effectiveness and secure budget space. The 
fact that DR -C A F T A issues monopo l ized the attention o f the Assembly since the Progress Repor t 
compounded this issue . Fo r projects prepared as part o f the FY04 -08 CPS, pro jec t preparation time 
averaged [29.7] months (compared to [ 1) ( f rom concept review to Boa rd approva1)and the time f r om 
Boa rd approval t o effectiveness i s pro jec ted t o average about 18 months, well above the L A C average 
o f [8.1] mon thsa8 F i n a l preparation o f the planned Telecomm pro jec t has been delayed pend ing 
passage fo r requisite reforms. The new CPS has built in realistic assessments o f Costa Rica’s 
decision making processes into project timelines and aims to maintain close dialogue so that 
requirements by each side are well understood and factored into planning. 

Shifts in Government policy priorities. The CPS covered two administrations (on-go ing projects 
had been prepared with previous administrations). The changes in po l icy p r io r i t ies f rom one 
adm in is tra t ion t o the next affected attention to on-go ing projects and the focus and design o f projects 
under preparation. Fo r example, preparation o f the Puerto L im o n pro jec t bene f i ted f rom greater 
support fo r po l icy re forms that w i l l con tr ibu te to i t s outcomes, but i t s preparation t ime was extended 
substantially as a consequence. The Costa-Rica Bank CPS cycle will become synchronized 
through the next CPS. 

Uncoordinated implementation procedures. Costa R ica has w e l l established procurement controls 
and f inanc ia l management procedures that have yet to be harmonized with the Bank . Inexperience 
with W o r l d Bank f iduc ia ry requirements wh ich differ f r om those o f the Government led t o slower 
pro jec t implementation. Greater harmon iza t ion with Government f inanc ia l management (FM) 
procedures and regular t ra in ing in Bank procurement procedures helped speed up the Hea l th 
Modern iza t ion Project. Harmonization with government FM procedures, three-part policy 
dialogue with the Ministry of Finance, Contraloria and the Bank to initiate more coordinated 
and efficient procurement as well as more training in Bank procurement will be streamlined in 
projects part of the new CPS.
