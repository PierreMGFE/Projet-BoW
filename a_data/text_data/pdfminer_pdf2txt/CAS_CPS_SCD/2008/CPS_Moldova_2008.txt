REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 
i. As Moldova approaches middle-income status, the country needs a 
sustainable growth strategy, recognizing that i t i s unlikely that remittance flows- 
which have fueled consumption-led growth the last few years-will continue to grow 
ve ry rapidly. A l t h o u g h m i g r a t i o n and remittances w i l l l i k e l y be k e y drivers o f g r ow t h 
and development ove r the CPS p e r i o d and f o r some time to come, M o l d o v a needs t o 
create the cond i t ions f o r remittances t o be used as p r o d u c t i v e l y as possible, such as 
th rough strengthening 
f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion and imp rovemen ts in the bus iness 
environment, t o a l l ow M o l d o v a t o increase p r iva te savings and investment. 

.. 

11. 

This results-based Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to assist in 
laying the foundations for inclusive economic growth in Moldova. This w i l l requ i re 
addressing three in te r re la ted challenges: (i) im p r o v i n g econom ic competitiveness t o 
support sustainable econom ic g row th ; (ii) m i n im i z i n g social and env i ronmen ta l risks, 
building human capital, and p r om o t i n g social inclusion; and (iii) improving p u b l i c sector 
governance. These th ree areas constitute the three p i l l a r s o f this CPS f o r FY09-FY 12 and 
are consistent with the Gove rnmen t o f Mo ldova ’s N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy (NDS) 
2008-201 1. 

iii. Moldova’s macroeconomic performance under the past Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) has been robust. The authorities have established a good t rack reco rd o f 
macroeconomic stability, with cumu la t ive g r ow t h over 2004 -2007 o f about 25 percent. 
The economy has been res i l ien t t o a numbe r o f external shocks, i n c l u d i n g sharp increases 
in na tu ra l gas prices, a Russ ian ban o n im p o r t i n g wine f r o m M o l d o v a , and a d rough t in 
2007 that reduced ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion by an estimated 30 percent. 

i v . 
The last CAS period has been characterized by political stability, with 
increasing political pluralism and a competitive electoral process. The current 
President, a membe r o f the Pa r ty o f Commun is ts o f the Repub l ic o f M o l d o v a (PCRM), 
w i l l complete the m a x i m u m t w o t e r m s in 2009 . The T ransn is t r ia c o n f l i c t has con t inued t o 
weigh o n the coun t ry ’s development, but reun i f ica t ion i s a high p r i o r i t y o f Mo ldova ’s 
NDS, and con t inued e f fo r ts towa rds a reso lu t ion are expected g i v e n i t s impo r tance for 
b o t h economic g r ow t h and Eu ropean in teg ra t ion . 

v. 

Moldova aspires to join the European Union over the longer term, and the 
country has been receiving increasing and more coordinated financing from 
European institutions. In 2007, the EU a r r ived at Mo ldova ’s bo rde r with the accession 
o f Romania. In 2008, due t o the successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the E U - M o l d o v a A c t i o n 
Plan, autonomous trade preferences went i n t o effect, and discussions are n o w unde rway 
o n a new legal agreement with the EU. 

vi. 

Despite the ongoing economic growth and political stability, the reduction in 
ove ra l l poverty appears to have stalled, at least between 2004 and 2005. Recen t ly 
released numbers f r o m the Gove rnmen t suggest that the absolute pove r ty rate and the 
extreme pove r ty rate have f a l l e n t o 25.8 per cent and 2.8 percent, respec t ive ly in 2007. A 
mo re sys tema t ic assessment led by the Pove r ty Assessment team i s now unde rway o f the 

v i i 

drivers o f these recent developments. Moldova’s economic recovery moved 40 percent 
o f the population out o f poverty between 1999 and 2004; however, the delay in 
restructuring farms has reduced the income-generating opportunities for ind iv idua l 
fa rme rs and contributed to r is ing ru ra l poverty at least through 2005. The analysis o f the 
trends after 2005 i s constrained by a statistical break in the ser ies . 

v i i . 
T h e M o l d o v a n economy r em a i n s v u l n e r a b l e . The large i n f l ow o f remittances 
has underpinned recen t consumption-led growth but also exposes the economy to risks o f 
a regional downturn. Already the re a re signs that m ig ra t ion m igh t have slowed and some 
workers m igh t have returned. Ongoing increases iu natural gas p r ices necess i ta te 
adjustments in an economy that i s s t i l l i n e f f i c i e n t in i t s energy use . The sharp r i s e in food 
p r ices and the global financial crisis are potential r i s k s wh ich could negatively impact the 
economy. Future weather-related events pose a continuing risk to the agricultural sector. 

v i i i . 
F l e x i b i l i t y w i l l b e c e n t r a l t o t h e W o r l d Bank G r o u p ’ s a p p r o a c h to a l l ow f o r 
a d a p t a t i o n t o c h a n g i n g econom ic and p o l i t i c a l contexts . Since Moldova’s per capita 
income recently exceeded the IDA threshold, the country i s entering a transition period- 
possibly mov ing to lending f rom the IBRD. The Bank’s country program w i l l therefore 
adjust the use o f instruments as appropriate, l i k e l y investing l e s s in projects and more in 
analytic and advisory activities over time as wou ld befit a middle income country. 
Fo l low ing Parliamentary elections, the designation o f a new government i s expected in 
mid-2009, and collaboration w i t h the new government could warrant some changes. 

i x . 
This C P S t h e r e f o r e re f lec ts a s t ra teg ic t r a n s i t i o n f r o m t h e p rev ious C A S 
t h r o u g h a two -s tep process. The f i r s t stage involves scaling up interventions and 
programs that are wo rk ing well w i th in the existing po r t fo l io during FY09 and FYlO. 
Du r ing the second stage, interventions w i l l be defined in more specific t e rm s for the 
remaining years o f the CPS period. This approach allows the Bank some f lex ib i l i ty to 
adjust the po r t fo l io as needed in response to issues emerging after the upcoming elections 
or as a r e s u l t o f a regional financial c r is is . Second-stage interventions w i l l be clearly 
described in the CPS Progress Report, and the t im ing o f this report w i l l be advanced i f 
appropriate to ensure that refinements to the country program are t ime ly and effective. 

\ 

x . 
T h e C P S foresees a l e n d i n g p r o g r a m o f t w o to t h r e e ope ra t ions p e r year-at 
leas t one o f w h i c h w o u l d b e b u d g e t suppo r t . Commitments w i l l total approximately 
US$45-$50 m i l l i o n per annum, with the specific country allocation being determined 
annually through IDA ’S performance-based allocation system. The Bank w i l l consider 
additional financing to existing operations within the current po r t fo l io and support for 
projects w i t h regional or global goods components. Investment operations w i l l build on 
the Bank’s track record and comparative advantage vis-a-vis other partners and focus in 
those areas where other funding can be h igh ly leveraged. 

x i . 
M o l d o v a i s a s t ra teg ic p r i o r i t y f o r IFC, and IFC w i l l inc rease i t s i n v e s tm e n t 
ac t iv i t ies and a d v i s o r y services in t h e c o u n t r y . IFC ’s ma in goal i s to support private 
sector development, focusing in particular o n the financial sector, agribusiness, 
healthcare, and infrastructure modernization. IFC w i l l collaborate closely w i t h I D A 
especially in the in f ras t ruc tu re and health sectors. 

... V l l l 

x i i . 

The Bank’s work on governance and anti-corruption w i l l be consistent with 
the Bank’s recently approved corporate strategy. Coun t ry owne rsh ip and leadership i s 
required f o r the Bank’s p rog ram t o make a decisive difference during the CPS p e r i o d and 
im p r o v e Mo ldova ’s standing o n va r ious comparative governance measures. The B a n k 
w i l l also w o r k with other stakeholders, c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector t o ensure 
r e f o rm e f fo r ts by the authorities are supported and deepened by greater demand f o r good 
governance. 

x i i i . Effective implementation o f this CPS w i l l require strong coordination with 
other development efforts, and monitoring and evaluation activities w i l l capitalize 
on opportunities f o r increased harmonization. Ind ica to rs f r o m the NDS have been 
inco rpo ra ted i n t o the results f ramewo rk where appropriate and the Bank w i l l r e l y o n 
coun t ry data systems and unified repo r t ing systems where feasible. The Bank w i l l 
m o n i t o r f iduc ia ry risks, imp lemen ta t ion capacity at the central and decentralized levels, 
ex te rna l shocks, and p o l i t i c a l economy r i s k s . 

x iv . The Executive Directors may wish to consider the following: 
Whether the lessons learned f r o m the p rev ious C A S pe r iod have been 
su f f ic ien t ly re f lec ted in the CPS; 
Whether the CPS has i d e n t i f i e d the re levan t development challenges and 
whether the p i l l a r s o f support under the new p rog ram p r o v i d e the appropriate 
response; 
Whe the r the CPS su f f ic ien t ly supports the Paris and A c c r a Dec la ra t ions f o r 
the streamlining o f deve lopmen t assistance; 
Whether the r i s k s i d e n t i f i e d by the p rog ram are rea l is t ic and whether the 
proposed remedies are credible; and 
Whether the p rog ram makes o p t im a l use o f the resources ava i lab le t o the 
W o r l d Bank G roup in order t o respond t o Mo ldova ’s needs.

Political Context 

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. 
During the last CAS period (FY05 to FYOS), Moldova experienced political 
stability, with increasing political pluralism and a competitive electoral process. The 
Party o f Communists o f the Republic o f Mo ldova (PCRM) won a ma jo r i ty o f the 
Parliament’s seats in the 2001 election, and Parliament, in turn, e lec ted a communist 
President. The P C RM ma jo r i ty and President remained in power after the next round o f 
scheduled elections in 2005-seen 
as f r e e and fa i r b y the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and others. The Prime Minister appointed in 2001 se rved 
for seven years. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 2009, at which time the 
incumbent president i s expected to stand down having se rved the max imum two t e rm s . In 
2007, opposition parties took over a number o f regional assemblies f rom the PCRM, 
demonstrating that the loca l elections offered genuine choice. In addition, the number o f 
women e lec ted as mayors has grown f rom 16 percent (2003) to 19 percent (2007), and in 
2008, a woman was appointed as Prime Minister o f Mo ldova fo r the f i r s t time. 

2. 
Despite this stability and progress, the Transnistria conflict has continued to 
weigh on the country’s overall development. Relations between the two s ides have been 
tense s ince Transnistria declared independence f r om Mo ldova in 1990. Because this eastern 
territory contained a significant part o f Moldova’s industrial base, this con f l ic t has forced 
Mo ldova to be even more dependent on agricultural production and imported energy. I t 
also created a fractured customs space w i t h implications fo r customs and tax revenue 
mobilization. Fo l low ing a brief con f l ic t in 1992, a ceasefire has been in place; however, 
efforts to forge a permanent se t t lemen t under the auspices o f a multi-country group have 
made l i t t l e headway in recent years. D i r e c t dialogue between Chisinau and Tiraspol 
occurred in April 2008, and continued efforts towards a resolution a re expected using the 
5+2 format-with 
the ma in participants inc lud ing the central government in Chisinau, 
Transnistria, OSCE, Ukraine, and Russia, and the two observers inc lud ing the EU and U .S . 
Reunification i s a h i g h p r io r i ty o f Moldova’s Na t iona l Development Strategy (NDS) given 
i t s importance for bo th economic growth and European integration. 

3 . 
I n the international arena, Moldova aspires to join the European Union o v e r 
the longer term. Mo ldova has strengthened i t s relations w i t h the EU, and bo th parties 
agreed to objectives specified in a three-year EU -Mo ldova Ac t ion Plan (EMAP ) signed in 
2005 within the framework o f the European Neighborhood Po l icy (ENP). In 2006, the 
European Commission (EC) established a delegation in Chisinau. As o f January 1, 2007, 
the EU has arrived at Moldova’s border w i t h the accession o f Romania. In 2008, due to the 
success fu l implementation o f the EU -Mo ldova Ac t ion Plan, autonomous trade preferences 
went in to effect fo r Moldova, p rov id ing fo r the duty f r e e access o f Mo ldovan products to 
the markets o f EU countries. 

4. 
Moldova has been receiving increasing and more coordinated financing from 
European institutions. EU support in Mo ldova has been directed in particular at bu i ld ing 
capacity in public administration, reforming soc ia l assistance and p r ima ry health care, 
developing a re fo rm strategy in the energy sector, imp rov ing the bus iness climate, 
especially export capacity, and imp rov ing the r u l e o f law, the independence o f the 

1 

judiciary, and respec t fo r human rights. Joint Mo ldova -EU efforts have also focused on 
border management and confidence-building measures for Transnistria. Mo ldova has 
recen t ly become the first ENP country to sign on June 5 , 2008 a P i lo t Mob i l i ty Partnership 
to strengthen the country’s capacity fo r m ig ra t ion management. 

5 . 

Discussions a re underway on a new legal agreement with the EU. The Council 
o f the EU has noted positive achievements in the process o f po l i t ica l and economic reforms 
under the first E M A P and welcomed Moldova’s active alignment with the Common 
Foreign and Security Policy Declarations. 
Important progress has been achieved in 
facilitating visa procedures wh i le controlling i l lega l migration and in increasing trade 
access to the European market. The Counc i l has highlighted those areas where ongoing 
efforts must be p r io r i t ized to strengthen democracy and the r u l e o f law, ensu re respec t for 
human rights, re in fo rce efforts against corruption, and improve the investment climate. 

6. 
Moldova has demonstrated the stability and capacity to implement a broad 
range of economic development initiatives, but much remains to be done to sustain 
economic growth and poverty reduction. W i t h a population o f about 3.8 m i l l i o n and a 
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita o f approximately $1,090 in 2007, Mo ldova 
remains a relatively low-income country. Those who are actively engaged in the po l i t ica l 
process remain relatively few-largely because the middle class i s s t i l l small, c i v i l society 
i s fragmented, and many youth are emigrating. M o v i n g forward, Mo ldova must consolidate 
the resu l ts f rom structural reforms needed to establish v i ta l policies and institutions, and 
accelerate the second generation o f re fo rms to provide long-term opportunities to young 
Moldovans.

Recent Economic Developments 

7. 
Moldova’s macroeconomic performance under the past CAS has been robust. 
The authorities have established a good track record o f macroeconomic stability, w i t h 
cumulative growth over 2004-2007 o f about 25 percent. The Government has maintained a 
prudent fiscal stance, recording small p r ima ry s u r p l u s e s in most years. In f la t ion has been 
the ma in macroeconomic challenge in recen t years, and w i t h the support f rom an 
International Monetary Fund Poverty Reduction G row th Fac i l i ty (PRGF), the Government 
has pursued a tight monetary and fiscal po l icy stance. However, in the wake o f recen t 
global economic turbulence, a g row th slowdown i s emerging as the new macroeconomic 
challenge for Moldova. Overall, the macroeconomic framework currently in place i s 
broadly satisfactory (Table 1). 

8 . 
The economy has been resilient to a number of recent external shocks. In 2006, 
Russia banned the impo r t o f wine f rom Moldova, wh ich accounted fo r about a quarter o f 
a l l Mo ldovan exports and 10 percent o f GDP. Meanwhile, Moldova, a net importer o f 
energy, also confronted sharp increases in natural gas pr ices , which tripled f rom January 
2006 to July 2008. In the summer o f 2007, the agricultural sector, directly representing 
about 14 pe rcen t o f GDP, was severely affected b y a drought w i t h losses in the sector 
estimated at nearly 30 percen t o f production. Moldova’s economic g row th f e l l to about 4 
pe rcen t in 2006 and more moderate growth persisted through 2007, reflecting the impact o f 
the drought. D e s p i t e weaker than expected overall performance, growth in non-agriculture 
GDP continues to be strong at 9 percen t last year. Through the f i r s t h a l f o f 2008, g row th

has rebounded strongly, and the economy i s projected to expand b y 6 .5 percent in 2008.

9. 
There have been encouraging signs that Moldova’s previous model o f 
consumption-driven growth may be broadening, with other drivers o f growth 
increasingly playing a more prominent ro le . Since the beginning o f the recovery in 2000, 
economic growth has averaged 5 . 5 percen t per year and has been d r iven in large part b y 
consumption and construction activities supported b y massive in f lows o f workers’ 
remittances (amounting to about a third o f GDP in 2008). There i s some evidence that 
remittances a re 
increasingly f low ing to business 
investment activities rather than 
consumption and housing construction alone. Private investment has r i s e n f rom about 14 
percent o f GDP in 2003 to 3 1 percent o f GDP in 2007, and foreign direct investment (FDI) 
f lows have grown sharply over this same period. FDI represented about 10 percen t o f GDP 
in 2007, much higher than that o f other countries in the region (though cumulatively and in 
per capita t e rm s , Mo ldova s t i l l lags w e l l behind i t s neighbors). Public investment has also 
generally increased in recen t years. 

10. 
The global economic c r i s i s has significantly clouded Moldova’s economic 
outlook. Mo ldova could be severely affected b y a slowdown in remittances in f lows and 
F D I in the wake o f a regional recession. The current account d e f i c i t has widened in recen t 
years ( f rom 10 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 17 percent in 2007), as a r e s u l t o f higher energy 
prices, the ban on Mo ldovan wine exports, strong remittance-driven impo r t demand and 
increased FDI-related activities. As a r e s u l t o f the expected regional slowdown, Moldova’s 
cu r ren t account d e f i c i t i s projected to widen further in 2008 to around 19 percen t o f GDP. 
Overall coverage o f the current account d e f i c i t b y FDI and long-term capital remains h igh 
at about 90 percent. Rese rves have been rising, suggesting that total capital f lows have 
been more than s u f f i c i e n t to finance the current account de f ic i t , leading to an accumulation 
o f r e s e r v e s ( f rom 2.2 months o f imports in 2005 to nearly 3.3 months projected in 2008). 

1 1. 

Despite recent global financial turbulence, Moldova’s own financial sector 

3 

appears to be well positioned to weather the impact o f the ongoing c r ises in world 
financial markets. The high degrees o f cap i ta l iza t ion and liquidity as we l l as reasonably 
good asset structures p r o v i d e a sizeable cush ion against po ten t ia l systemic shocks. The 
Government’s comm i tmen t t o a f l e x i b l e exchange rate reg ime w i l l help soften the impac t 
o f external shocks. Nonetheless, the g r ow t h ou t look f o r 2009 i s unce r ta in at best. (In 
December, 2008, the IMF p ro jec ted a 2009 g r ow t h rate o f 3.5 percent.) The expected real 
app rec ia t ion o f the exchange rate also creates pressures o n the economy tha t w i l l need t o be 
addressed by po l ic ies t o support further imp rovemen ts in p r o d u c t i v i t y and competitiveness.

Macroeconomic Prospects and Debt Sustainability 
12. 
The Mo ldovan economy remains vulnerable. Fou r areas in pa r t icu la r p resen t 
con t inu ing risks: 

G loba l uncertainties. A l t h o u g h estimates to date suggest a strong rebound o f the 
M o l d o v a n economy f o l l ow i n g last year’s ag r icu l tu ra l -d r iven s lowdown , the recent 
g loba l f inanc ia l shocks c o u l d nega t ive ly impac t Mo ldova , i n c l u d i n g th rough a g r ow t h 
s l ow d ow n among i t s m a i n t rad ing partners and among the hos t countries o f Mo ldova ’s 
m ig ran t workers. The heavy reliance o n remittances exposes the economy t o r isks o f an 
ex te rna l down tu rn . These risks are compounded by the l a c k o f p roduc t and ma rke t 
d ive rs i f ica t ion in trade f lows . Howeve r , rem i t tance and FDI-driven impo r ts a re l i k e l y 
t o s l ow d o w n as well, thus m i t i g a t i n g the net impac t o n the balance o f payments. 
Energy p r ices . As per the agreement reached with Gazprom, energy prices w i l l 
con t inue t o increase until they reach ma rke t (i.e. EU) l e v e l s by 201 1. In Ju ly 2008, the 
p r ice reached US$253 per mcm , w h i c h compares t o US$SO per m c m in December 
2005. D e c l i n i n g o i l p r ices in the latter h a l f o f 2008 as w e l l as an appreciating exchange 
rate c o u l d help moderate the expected increase in domestic na tu ra l gas prices. 
Nonetheless, the p r i c e M o l d o v a pays f o r na tu ra l gas i s expected to increase further 
re la t ive t o i t s cu r ren t l e v e l . This w i l l force further adjustments in an economy that i s 
s t i l l ine f f ic ien t in i t s energy use, and the impac t w i l l f a l l d isp ropo r t iona te ly o n the poo r . 
F o o d p r i c e s . The impac t o f rising g loba l f o o d p r ices i s likely t o a f fec t nega t ive ly the 
urban poor, w h o d o n o t produce their o w n food . Also, inso fa r as government p o l i c y 
discriminates against net f o o d producers, higher costs c o u l d unde rm ine ag r icu l tu ra l 
development. The sharp r i s e in f o o d p r ices has f u e l e d i n f l a t i o n th rough the f i r s t pa r t o f 
2008. The rebound in the domestic ag r icu l tu ra l sector has con t r ibu ted t o a s l ow d ow n in 
f o o d p r ice i n f l a t i o n since then, a long with f a l l i n g g loba l f o o d prices. 
C l ima te change. The 2007 d rough t w i l l have persistent e f fec ts o n the ag r icu l tu re sector. 
The impac t o f 2008 f l o o d i n g i s n o t yet clear. Fu tu re weather-related even ts pose a 
con t inu ing risk t o the sector and, hence, ove ra l l economic g r ow t h and p r ice s tab i l i ty . 

13. 
The debt outlook i s favorable w i th a low risk o f debt distress. Mo ldova ’s r a t i o o f 
to ta l external debt t o G D P dec l ined f r o m about 124 percent in 2000 t o a round 54.1 percent 
in 2007. Ex te rna l p u b l i c and pub l ic ly -gua ran teed debt exc lud ing debt o f state-owned 
enterprises f e l l from 6 1.5 percent o f GD P in 200 1 t o a round 2 0 percent o f GD P at the end 
o f 2007. A c c o r d i n g t o a recent Debt Sus ta inab i l i ty Ana lys is (DSA) conducted j o i n t l y by 
the IMF and the World Bank, the public debt and debt-service to revenue ra t ios are well 
within the re levan t thresholds in the baseline and “h is to r ica l ” scenarios (Table 2). Desp i te

Box 1. The 2006 Revisions to the Household 
Budget Survey 
The sampling frame, sampling methodology and 
the questionnaire o f the HBS, the main source o f 
data for measuring l iv ing standards, were a l l 
substantially revised i n 2006 to make the survey 
more representative and improve the 
measurement o f consumption. These 
methodological improvements prevent the 
analysis of poverty trends through 2006. The lack 
o f comparability could be addressed in part by 
applying some new methods recently developed 
by World Bank staff, the so-called Small Area 
Estimates (SAE). The aim i s to predict household 
per capita consumption in a later round based on 
a model o f consumption estimated using an 
e a r l i e r round, to ensure that the definition o f 
consumption i s the same across two, otherwise 
incomparable, surveys. Preliminary work has 
been initiated to apply the same methodology to 
the 2005 and 2006 surveys. The in i t ia l results 
suggest that poverty may have fallen somewhat 
over this period, but this requires further and 
more systematic verification.

population i s poor and about 70 percent o f the poor l ive in ru ra l areas, according to the 
2007 HBS. The urban poverty headcount i s 14 percent while the rural poverty headcount i s 
31.3 percent.6 Consistent with previous findings, many o f the poor are among pensioners, 
f a rm e r s and agricultural workers. Poverty among farmers r e f l e c t s limited economic 
opportunities in r u r a l areas and in the agriculture sector. In addition, poverty levels r i s e 
with the size o f the household (number o f household members), particularly those w i t h 
young children. In fact, child poverty i s higher than adult poverty: in 2006, child poverty 
stood at 27.4 percent compared w i t h 25.8’ pe rcen t fo r adults.

Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals 

20. Moldova i s working to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
and has adapted targets and indicators based on the national context. In 2000, the 
Republic o f Mo ldova along w i t h other 19 1 countries o f the wo r ld committed to achieving 
the MDGs b y 2015. The first adjustment o f these goals to fit Moldova’s situation was done 
in 2004 and resulted in a number o f spec i f ic targets and indicators wh ich have been further 
refined in the fo l low ing years. Reaching these targets i s part o f the medium- and long-term 
strategy o f government as articulated in the 2008-20 1 1 National Development Strategy. 
Mo ldova has made some progress towards achieving the MDGs, and targets for 20 10 and 
201 5 were revised during the NDS consultation p rocess w i t h both central public authorities 
and a number o f national and international organizations (Table 4). The full l i s t o f adjusted 
national target MDGs are presented in Annex 1. 

21. Moldova has made significant progress in achieving Goal 1-eradicating 
extreme poverty and hunger. G iven the recen t improvements to the methodology fo r the 
Household Budget Survey, a new baseline has been established for poverty reduction in 
2006, and further progress i s expected to reach the 2010 and 2015 targets. Good progress 
has also been made toward implementation o f measures seeking to reduce ch i ld and 
maternal mo r ta l i ty rates. The under-5 mo r ta l i ty rate (per 1000 l ive born) f e l l f rom 18.2 in 
2002 to 14.0 in 2006, and the maternal mo r ta l i ty rate (per 100,000 l ive born) dropped from 
28.0 in 2002 to 16.0 in 2006. Changes in methodology have resu l ted in new baselines being 
se t fo r bo th indicators, and Mo ldova expects to achieve the new targets se t fo r 2010 and 
2015.7 

6 

The 2006 urban poverty rate i s much higher than that o f previous years. This could be due to 
methodological changes, but cou ld also be due to energy price increases. Increases in energy p r ices are l ike ly 
to have affected mostly urban households connected to energy sources. The rura l poor, in contrast, were 
l ike ly to have greater access to cheaper, and dirtier, sources o f f u e l . 
The M in is t ry o f Health i s applying a new methodology recommended b y the Wo r ld Health Organization 
wherein a l ive birth i s defined as a b ir th after 22 complete weeks o f pregnancy and a child weight above 500 
grams. Previously, a birth was considered l ive after the 30* complete week o f pregnancy and a ch i ld weight 
above 1,000 grams.

Governance and Anticorruption 

23. 
The quality of governance in Moldova remains a significant challenge to 
economic growth and poverty reduction. An un favo rab le external environment 
characterized by frozen conflict, recurrent external shocks, and a delicate two -vec to r 
geopo l i t ica l balance be tween the EU and Russia exacerbate this challenge. The p ic tu re that 
emerges f r o m the extensive ana ly t ica l and diagnostic w o r k conducted by the B a n k and 
other donors reveals s ign i f ican t governance obstacles and l i m i t e d prospects f o r qu ick wins. 
The m a i n crosscutting issues related t o governance in M o l d o v a are described be low ; the 
specific sectoral obstacles and their relevance f o r development are covered th rough this 
CPS document. A de ta i led analysis o f Mo ldova ’s governance and anti-corruption, 
i n c l u d i n g f iduc ia ry and coun t ry systems and Coun t ry Governance and A n t i -C o r r u p t i o n 
(CGAC ) strategy appears in Annex 2. 

24. Moldova’s success in addressing corruption has been uneven. Compared t o a 
sample o f fo rme r Sov ie t U n i o n (FSU) countries, M o l d o v a pe r fo rms better o r i s o n par o n 
several performance indicators. (Annex 2, Figure 1). Howeve r , M o l d o v a remains an ou t l ie r 
o n “uno f f ic ia l ” payments f o r c i v i l courts, p u b l i c education, and p u b l i c health. One - th i rd o f 
the popu la t ion believes that co r rup t ion has increased unde r this government. The same 
survey f o u n d that 70 percent o f the popu la t ion view co r rup t ion as widespread; 78 percent 
be l ieved that co r rup t ion h a d recen t ly worsened in Mo ldova , and 64 percent ind ica ted that 
co r rup t ion was “no rma l and inevitable.” 
Ins t i tu t ions pe rce ived t o be the mos t co r rup t 
inc luded the police, customs, jud ic ia ry , prosecutors, and m in is t r ies while the least co r rup t 
were the N a t i o n a l Statistics O f f ice , mayoralties, m i l i t a r y , and l o c a l counc i ls . 

25. 
The institutional structure lacks sufficient checks and balances. M o l d o v a i s 
cons t i tu t iona l ly a pa r l iamen ta ry democracy, 
in w h i c h the President 
i s elected by 
parliament. Howeve r , p o l i t i c a l powe r has rema ined concentrated in the Presidency, 
fac i l i ta ted by a s t rong m a j o r i t y o f the PCRh4 in the parliament. Checks and balances are 
insu f f ic ien t ly developed between the executive and the legislature, and the j u d i c i a r y 
remains weak. M o r e generally, Mo ldova , like m a n y other fo rme r Sov ie t Republics, i s 
s t rugg l ing with the legacy o f a vast bureaucracy en joy ing s ign i f ican t discretionary powe r . 
This stifles entrepreneurship and slows the demand f o r economic r e f o rm that w o u l d come 
from a vibrant p r iva te sector. La rge ou twa rd m i g r a t i o n by the young and well-educated has 
further con t r ibu ted t o reduc ing demand f o r change. 

26. 
Barriers to competition impede the development of the private sector. The

invas ive special interests tha t d is to r t the p o l i c ym a k i n g env i ronmen t and hamper M o l d o v a ’ s

27. 
The Government has taken measures to modernize the anti-corruption policy 
framework. Since the beginning o f the an t i -co r rup t ion r e f o rm in year 2000, the 
government has driven a b road range o f leg is la t ive in i t ia t ives and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms : 
passage o f an A c t i o n P lan and a n ew an t i -co r rup t ion l a w (2004-2005); adop t ion o f an EU- 
M o l d o v a A c t i o n P lan and an an t i -co r rup t ion f ramewo rk anchored in the Econom ic G r ow t h 
and Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (EGPRSP); p romu lga t ion o f an A n t i -M o n e y 
Launde r ing L a w and strategy (2007), A n t i - T r a f f i c k i n g L a w and A c t i o n P lan (2007);

adop t ion o f a N e w Gua rd L a w (2007). M o l d o v a also opted t o establish a specialized 
agency, the Center f o r Comba t ing Econom ic C r imes and Co r rup t ion , w h i c h howeve r i s 
pe rce ived as p o l i t i c i z e d and ta rge t ing p r im a r i l y l ow - l e v e l co r rup t ion and c r ime . 

28. 
The Government recognizes governance and anti-corruption as a significant 
challenge and has achieved encouraging progress in some areas. This includes 
mode rn iza t ion o f p u b l i c sector governance ins t i tu t ions responsible f o r p u b l i c finance, 
mac roeconom ic management, and the supreme aud i t i n s t i t u t i o n (Cou r t o f Accounts), w h i c h 
shou ld help deter and p reven t oppo r tun i t ies f o r co r rup t ion . The n ew procurement l a w 
passed in 2007 also aims t o r e c t i f y some o f the co r rup t ion p rob lems in p u b l i c procurement. 
In addition, the second stage o f the comprehensive regu la to ry re fo rm (Gu i l lo t ine 2) a ims t o 
ra t iona l ize and mainstream the system and establish among others a single and transparent 
l icens ing system. 

29. 
Despite these achievements, significant governance challenges remain as 
government commitment has wavered. Be tween 2004 and 2007, the government 
imp lemen ta t ion e f fo r t s lowed down . This i s re f lec ted by the de te r io ra t ing coun t ry ranking 
o n the Transparency In te rna t iona l (TI) co r rup t ion index, p lac ing M o l d o v a at 109 th p lace in 
2008 (down from 79 in 2006). Pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion r e f o rm in i t ia ted in 2006 has largely 
stalled. T h e N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy (NDS) signals a renewed government 
comm i tmen t 
t o combat co r rup t ion and accurately 
iden t i f ies as p r io r i t ies j u d i c i a l 
independence, j u d i c i a l system consolidation, cu r ta i l ing the extensive powe rs o f the General 
Prosecutor’s o f f ice , and p reven t ive an t i -co r rup t ion . 

30. Moldova’s European aspirations require full attention to governance and 
institutional development issues and a sustained commitment to improving them ove r 
the long term. The C G A C Strategy accompany ing th is CPS, elaborated in mo re de ta i l in 
Annex 2, emphasizes con t inued engagement o n public sector and p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management re fo rms o n the supply side o f good governance, but recognizes that progress

the C G A C Strategy also foresees a p rog ram o f ana ly t ica l and advocacy work to support the 
demand fo r good governance. In d o i n g so, i t builds o n an analysis o f the m a i n drivers o f

11. COUNTRY PR IOR IT IES AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

3 1. 
As Moldova approaches middle-income status, the country needs a sustainable 
growth strategy, recognizing that i t i s unlikely that remittance flows-which have 
fueled consumption-led growth the last few years-will continue to grow very rapidly. 
A l t h o u g h m i g r a t i o n and remittances w i l l l ike ly be k e y d r ive rs o f g r ow t h and development

Country Development Program 

32. 
The National Development Strategy i s the main medium-term strategic 
planning paper which defines the developmental objectives and will guide the 
budgetary process ove r the period 2008-2011. The NDS, the successor t o the EGPRSP, 
was adopted by the M o l d o v a n Pa r l iamen t in December 2007. I t was discussed a long with 
the Joint S t a f f Advisory N o t e (JSAN) by the Boards o f IDA and IMF in M a r c h 2008. 
Under the ND S , the Gove rnmen t w i l l seek t o better p r i o r i t i z e i t s po l ic ies and establish a 
clear funding mechan ism f r o m b o t h domestic and external sources. As with the EGPRSP, 
the NDS was developed in broad-based consultations with stakeholders and c i v i l society,

Pa r t ic ipa t ion C o u n c i l comp r ised o f representatives o f a l l stakeholder groups. 

33 . 
The NDS reflects the Government’s objective of reducing poverty from a 
comprehensive development perspective. Consistent with the EGPRSP and the EU- 
M o l d o v a A c t i o n Plan, the NDS i s constructed around f ive med ium - te rm cross-sectoral 
p r io r i t ies (with macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and im p r o v e d p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion capacity

35 . 
T o implement the NDS, the Government of Moldova w i l l need to continue 
strengthening the capacity of the line ministries to develop and implement action

Structural and Sectoral Issues : Progress and Challenges 

Competitive M a r k e t Env i ronmen t and Sustainable G r ow t h 

36 . Moldova’s 
industrial output and exports continue to be dominated by 
traditional, low value-added products, and its current account i s chronically in deficit. 
In 2007, the cu r ren t account deficit was estimated to be about 17 percent o f GDP. 
Enhancing the economy’s global competitiveness-the 
ab i l i ty o f the economy to 
participate in global trade and investment networks-is essential for achieving long-term 
growth. The normalization o f trade relations w i t h Russia and the introduction o f 
autonomous trade p re fe rences b y the European U n i o n presen t an opportunity fo r promoting 
export-driven growth. This w i l l be achieved through: (i) raising the quality and quantity o f 
Mo ldovan exports and promoting deeper integration o f exporters in global supply chains; 
(ii) attracting greater foreign investment in f lows to Moldova; and (iii) developing the 
linkages between loca l f i r m s and foreign companies already in Moldova. 

37 . 
I n recent years, Moldova, assisted by donors, has pursued a re fo rm program 
aimed at achieving sustainable private sector-led economic growth. E f fo r ts focused in 
particular on the ,business enabling environment, including: (i) overhaul o f business 
registration system, (ii) streamlining o f regulatory regime through the so-called Gu i l lo t ine 
exercise fo r existing legislation; (iii) introduction o f Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) 
fo r new legislation affecting business operations; (iv) modernization o f the national system 
o f metrology, standardization, testing, and quality (MSTQ), and (v) p rov is ion o f f isca l 
incentives fo r the en te rp r ise sector. 

3 8 . 
Despite the progress achieved by this re fo rm program, Moldova’s standing in 
global Doing Business ratings remains low relative to its central European neighbors 
(103 in the 2008 report). The most problematic i s s u e s relate to construction permits, trade 
across borders, paying taxes, employing workers, and protecting investors. Recent 
en te rp r ise surveys and case study interviews indicate that Mo ldovan entrepreneurs a re most 
concerned about: (i) the burdensome and unpredictable regulatory environment, (ii) 
insu f f ic ien t access to long-term f inance , (iii) shortage o f skilled labor, (iv) insufficient 
access to knowledge, (v) inadequate MSTQ infrastructure, and (v i ) the weak transport and 
logistics infrastructure. 

39 . While Moldova’s financial sector has deepened rapidly, i t seems in a relatively 
better position to weather the international financial storm compared to regional 
peers. The banking sector has experienced rap id credit growth (52% just in 2007 ) , major 
changes in the ownership s truc ture , and decreasing spreads. Foreign participation in the 
banking sector has g rown with a number o f foreign banks recently establishing themselves 
in Moldova. The recent wine ban and r is ing gas p r ices demonstrated that the Mo ldovan 
financial system can withstand major exogenous shocks to the en te rp r ise sector. Moreover, 
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update conducted in 2007 issued a 
largely positive op in ion on the National Bank o f Moldova’s regulatory and supervisory 
capacity, on the basis o f substantial compliance w i t h the ma jo r i ty o f Base1 Core Principles.

However, given the recent global and regional financial turbulence, some 
caution i s wa r ran ted in the otherwise positive outlook o f the financial sector. A l though 
the banking sector i s relatively stable in the short run due to existing h i g h prudential 

14 

requirements and weak integration in to the global markets, i t i s quite vulnerable in the 
medium t e rm as a severe recession in Moldova’s ma in trading partners could affect 
negatively the f l ow o f remittances, leading to reduction in banks’ deposit base. At the same 
time, reduced demand fo r Mo ldovan exports and a possible currency weakening could lead 
to a r i s e o f non-performing bank loans.

financial system remains small relative to those o f most other transition economies. Total 
assets o f the banking sector amounted to 60 percent o f the GDP at the end o f 2007, whereas 
lending represented on ly 39 percent (in 2004 these figures amounted to 42 pe rcen t and 23 
percent, respectively). The cost o f credit remains relatively high, and access t o long-term 
credit by the corporate sector i s very limited. Development o f the non-bank financial sector 
could increase the relatively l o w level o f savings in the economy and f u e l the growth o f the 
domestic capital market. To mitigate r isks , Mo ldova needs to finalize the legal and 
regulatory framework 
for non-bank financial institutions supervised b y the new ly

network, totaling about 16,800 km, has been severely neglected during the past 15 years, 
w i t h few resources spent fo r maintenance and rehabilitation, For example, in 2006, an 
amount equal to 0.6 percent o f GDP was actually spent on road maintenance and 
rehabilitation whereas roughly 3.6 percent was required. A similar dynamic exists for 
Moldova’s state ra i lway company (CFM-Calea FeratSi din Moldova). Revenues f rom 
freight t ra f f ic have been used to finance the operation and maintenance o f the en t i re r a i l 
network and to subsidize passenger transport operations. Continued efforts to res t ruc tu re

the short-term objectives o f making pension payments on time, in-cash (as opposed t o in- 
kind), and without the need fo r budget transfers. However, the government has not yet 
successfully eliminated pension privileges. K e y i s s u e s that need to be addressed 
immediately therefore include weak linkages between actual contributions and pensions, 
the declining number o f contributors supporting a g row ing number o f pensioners as the 
population continues to age, and the weak administrative capacity w i t h i n the system. 
Recent migration trends s e r v e to accentuate these challenges. 

52. 
Reforms a re also underway in the education sector but further and more 
significant improvements in expenditure efficiency w i l l be required. Public spending 
fo r education amounted to 6.0 pe rcen t o f the GDP in 2001 and increased to 8.2 percen t in 
2006, representing the largest set o f expenditures in the national public budget (20 percent 
in 2006). Increased spending has yielded positive measures to increase quality and access, 
particularly the provision o f textbooks and food to children o f poor families and the 
development o f new cu r r icu la . However, despite growing resources both in absolute and in 
per capita t e r m s (as the population o f school age children i s shrinking), key re fo rm 
challenges remain to be addressed. One area o f reform that holds great promise fo r the 
future o f Mo ldova in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy, i s the integration 
o f IC T in education, both as a subject matter and as a too l for the delivery o f education in 
a l l areas and at a l l levels. This i s o f particular relevance in higher education, where a strong 
link w i t h the private sector, especially the I T industry, w i l l lead to better employment 
opportunities fo r young talent and has the potential to reverse the b ra in drain. 

53 . 
The education sector continues to suffer from persistent problems related to 
the quality of services, equal access, and institutional arrangements that do not 
facilitate the most efficient use of public resources. HBS data f rom 2006 show that 
household expenditures for education vary significantly b y residence area and b y welfare 
level: on average, urban f a m i l i e s spend 2.7 times more than rural families, and wealthier 
families s end 7 times more than poor households or 30 times more than extremely poor 
families.''HBS 
data also show that a household headed b y a person w i t h a university 
education faces a poverty risk that i s 5 t imes lower than that o f a household headed b y a 
person w i t h a primary or incomplete secondary education-thus 
signaling the importance 
o f decreasing dropouts and removing barriers to h igh quality education s e r v i c e s . The 
M in is t ry o f Education and You th w i t h W o r l d Bank support has completed a School 
Ne two rk Optimization Strategy and has developed options for formula funding, bo th o f

Health indicators have improved but remain we l l below EU averages.

59. M ig ra t ion and the associated remittances flows have made a strong 
contribution to poverty reduction, bu t are causing social strains in r u r a l families and 
among the youth.12 The National Bureau o f Statistics (NBS) estimates that over 300,000 
Moldovans or 21 percen t o f the Mo ldovan workforce resided abroad in the second quarter 
o f 2006. The average Mo ldovan migrant i s 3 5 years old. Mos t a re men f rom ru ra l areas 
where the re are few employment opportunities; however, patterns are shifting toward more 
opportunity-based migration that draws men and women w i t h higher educational 
qualifications who l i v e in urban areas. One important recen t trend i s the growing share o f 
migrants obtaining permanent res idenc ies in destination countries. As a resu l t , the more 
permanent m ig ra t ion o f fam i l ies has increased, as has the risk o f brain drain. 

60. Moldova’s youth are leaving in massive numbers due to the lack o f adequate 
jobs and business development opportunities, particularly in r u r a l areas. Young 
people (15-34 years o f age) account fo r about one third o f Moldova’s population, but they 
face major obstacles in f ind ing work. According to the Employment Agency, youth are 3.5 
t imes more l i k e l y than adults to be unemployed. Similarly, the youth joblessness rate 
(number o f young people out o f work, not look ing for work, and out o f school) i s one o f 
the highest in E C A at 30 percent. Wh i le Mo ldova has been struggling to address youth 
i s s u e s in a comprehensive and cross-sectoral manner, there are a number o f important 
constraints to youth programming in the country, inc lud ing weak institutional capacity at 
national and loca l levels, limited financial resources, lack o f equipment, limited targeting o f 
the most vulnerable youth, weak monitoring and evaluation systems, and lack o f human 
resources, particularly specialists. The launch o f bo th Moldova’s Year o f You th in 2008 
and the NDS provide important opportunities 
fo r facilitating youth training and 
employment in the country and encouraging returning migrants to stay in the country and 
contribute to private sector-led growth in combination with a targeted approach fo r the 
most disadvantaged young people especially in ru ra l areas. Mo ldova could create new jobs 
for the thousands o f young graduates who wo rk in the grey economy as programmers, b y 
promoting the development o f the loca l I T industry, encouraging the creation o f I T 
incubators and techno-parks, facilitating the creation o f bus inesses in this field and 
promoting access to credit, inc lud ing venture capital and lending products designed for 
export-oriented I T f i r m s .

o f the Single Treasury Account, wh ich improved the overall scores in cash management 
and accounting recording and reporting. Other areas where scoring improved were payroll, 
procurement and internal controls. Substantial wo rk has been done on revising the budget 
classification fo r the public sector and preparing for the implementation o f the integrated 
financial management information system (to be operational in 2011). A so l id reform

111. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. 

Implementation o f the last CAS 

66. 
The country context and IDA’s allocation system have changed since IDA’s 
last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) f o r Moldova (2005-2008) was d e ~ e lop ed . ’ ~ 
This strategy was presented to the Executive Board against the backdrop o f a difficult 
po l icy environment, w i t h the IMF’s PRGF and the W o r l d Bank Structural Adjustment 
Credit I11 programs both having been recently suspended with l e s s than one third o f the 
committed funds disbursed. Given concerns about Moldova’s commitment to economic 
reform, the CAS directed IDA support to ma in ly local interventions in areas with the 
highest concentration o f poverty. IDA ’S country po r t fo l io fo l lowed a Base Case lending 
scenario that provided on ly investment operations and spec i f ied a se r ies o f re fo rm 
benchmarks that wou ld trigger e l ig ib i l i ty fo r H i g h Case policy-based lending. 

67. 
At the time o f the CAS Progress Report (2006)’ Moldova had accomplished o r 
substantially accomplished most o f the reform benchmarks established as H igh Case 
triggers. However, Moldova’s CAS was one o f the last to contain exp l ic i t lending 
scenarios, and this was superseded b y the IDA 14 resource allocation process-specifying 
that country allocations a re determined annually through IDA’s performance-based 
allocation (PBA) system. This new system awarded funding based on country performance 
ratings, determined by the Country Po l icy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), po r t fo l io 
performance ratings, and the governance factor. Mo ldova did receive increased financial 
support according to the P B A formula, but this was be low the level o f assistance envisaged 
b y the H i g h Case scenario. 

68 . 
Despite these changes, the last CAS was implemented relatively smoothly and 
without major changes in the original objectives. The CAS focused o n th ree p i l la rs : (i) 
promoting a competitive market environment, stability, and pro-poor growth; (ii) 
m in im iz ing social and environmental r i s k s , bu i ld ing human capital, and promoting social 
inclusion; and (iii) combating corruption and imp rov ing public sector governance. The 
CAS Progress Report ca l led fo r some realignment to the overall program t o con f i rm that 
the investment lending was complementary to the new Poverty Reduction Support Credit

(PRSC) program, that much-needed financing was provided for infrastructure (roads), and 
that planned operations wou ld f i t w i th in the PBA-determined IDA allocations. 

Portfolio Management and Performance 

69. 
The ove ra l l portfolio including trust funds has been dominated by projects in 
the infrastructure and agriculture/environment sectors as well as in public sector 
reform. As o f December 2008, IDA lending operations include a PRSC program and 10 
investment operations (w i th an additional 3 GEF projects), w i t h a total commitment o f 
US$159.3 m i l l ion , o f wh ich US$100.4 m i l l i o n (63%) remains to be disbursed. The on- 
going IDA po r t fo l io i s broad ranging covering almost every sector, but w i t h a higher 
concentration o f operations in the infrastructure sectors and in human and rural 
development. The Wo r ld Bank also administers a substantial $76.5 m i l l i o n t r u s t fund 
po r t fo l io o f 23 activities-the 
largest in the E C A region-which provides co-financing to 6 
IDA operations (39%), finances 6 stand-alone GEFKa rbon operations (33%), and provides 
other forms o f direct support (28%) such as an EFA -FT I grant o f $8.8 m i l l i o n fo r pre- 
primary education and a $6.15 m i l l i o n multi-donor t r u s t fund for public administration 
reform. Trust fund resources support sustainable development (46%), human development 
(26%), public-sector reform (22%) and competitiveness (6%). 

70. 
Analytic and advisory activities have complemented lending operations. Recent 
non-lending activities include a Financial Sector Assessmen t Update with the IMF, an on- 
going Country Economic Memorandum, a Public Expenditure Review, a Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessmen t Update, a Private Sector 
Development Note, pension re fo rm technical assistance, telecommunications analytic 
work, a Debt Management Assessment, and a Country Governance Assessmen t . 

71. 
All I D A and GEF operations currently under implementation a re proceeding 
satisfactorily as a re the trust-funded activities. Project performance i s satisfactory in 
t e r m s o f implementation progress, w i t h the disbursement ratio o f bo th the IDA and trust 
fund portfolios consistently exceeding 20 pe rcen t annually, aided by the new country 
financing parameters approved on February 1, 2005. G iven i t s significance to the overall 
program, a spec ia l rev iew o f the t r u s t fund po r t fo l io was conducted in September 2008, 
p rov id ing the fo l low ing insight in to factors for good implementation and thus for 
increasing the l ike l ihood o f achieving resu l ts : (i) strong ownership and governance, also 
generally linked to good management capacity, are key fo r smooth implementation; (ii) 
capacity to adapt to challenges and adjust project design du r ing implementation 
substantially lowers risks to failure; (iii) proactive support provided b y the Bank, 
specifically b y loca l s t a f f on the ground, r e s u l t in more effective implementation; ( iv ) 
combined resources o f Bank administrative budget and t r u s t fund resources can enable 
more frequent and thus more thorough Bank implementation support when an activity i s 
anchored in a broader “program”; (v) unclear commitment f rom the Bank or the client can 
be very damaging; but (v i ) c lea r bene f i ts to bene f ic ia r ies combined w i t h solid 
implementation capacity can make up fo r weak Government ownership. 

72. 
During the last CAS period, I F C continued to develop private enterprises and 
assisted with attracting foreign strategic investors. IFC has been selective in i t s 
investments in Moldova, particularly in the banking sector where transparency and 

23 

corporate governance con t inue t o pose challenges. I F C p r o v i d e d over $15 m i l l i o n o f i t s 
ow n funds in t h r e e projects over the 2005-2008 pe r iod . This inc luded support t o the 
banking sector in long - te rm f inanc ing and trade f inanc ing c red i t l i n e s t o the l o c a l bank, 
Mob iasbank where I F C p rov ided c r i t ica l ly needed t e r m funding w h i c h w o u l d otherwise n o t 
be available f r o m ma rke t sources. This i s helping the bank expand i t s lend ing t o sma l l and 
medium enterprises and also stimulate impo r ts and exports by increasing access to trade 
finance f o r entrepreneurs. 

73. 
IFC has recently increased e f f o r t s to support the private sector. In the 
agribusiness sector, the Government has reques ted IFC ’ s assistance in reviving the 
coun t ry ’s wine sector w h i c h p rov ides emp loymen t f o r nea r ly 10% o f i t s popu la t ion . I F C

equity funds w h i c h m a y invest in sma l l and medium enterprises in M o l d o v a . 

Resu l ts Ach ieved 

74. 
Over the 2005-2008 period, Moldova attained o r exceeded many o f the country 
development outcomes set as targets under the last CAS. Econom ic growth surpassed 
p ro jec t ions o n average, and p u b l i c debt leve ls dec l ined t o well b e l ow thresholds that would 
signal debt distress. With the increased s tab i l i ty o f i t s mac roeconom ic f ramewo rk , M o l d o v a 
wo rked inc remen ta l ly towa rd a compe t i t ive market environment, by simplifying and 
reduc ing the cost o f business l icens ing and registration, im p r o v i n g customs services, 
increasing the e f f ic iency o f the bank ing sector, and improving the e f f ic iency and qua l i ty o f 
energy supply in p i l o t areas. 
In the social arena, m o r e Mo ldovans were covered b y 
essential hea l th in te rven t ions and maternal and c h i l d m o r t a l i t y rates decreased beyond the i r 
targets. Mo ldovans in f ive commun i t ies gained access t o piped systems f o r clean water and 
sewage treatment. F ina l ly , with IDA assistance, M o l d o v a launched an amb i t ious p u b l i c 
sector r e f o rm p rog ram that inc luded the development o f a medium t e rm expenditure 
f ramewo rk f o r a l i g n i n g p u b l i c spending with development p r io r i t ies . 

75 . 

Although I D A ’ S performance under the past CAS was satisfactory, some 
e f fo r ts have not yet achieved their desired outcomes. Ongo ing ac t iv i t ies in the p o r t f o l i o 
are expected t o con t inue the pens ion r e f o rm process, improve the ta rge t ing o f soc ia l 
assistance, comp le te the ove rhau l o f the business enab l ing env i ronmen t and MSTQ system, 
increase the access to and qua l i ty o f education-particularly 
f o r r u r a l Moldovans-and 
further build the capacity o f the p u b l i c sector. The C A S C om p l e t i o n Repo r t exp lo red h o w 
w e l l i n d i v i d u a l coun t ry development outcomes were ach ieved during the last C A S p e r i o d 
and identified factors tha t con t r ibu ted t o o r l im i t e d expected progress. This report, in 
Annex 3, describes the r e s u l t s achieved in m o r e detail and i d e n t i f i e s lessons t o i n f o r m the 
CPS (Box 2). 

76. 
The trust fund portfolio has contributed to achieving results. This has occurred 
th rough enhancing IDA resources in key p rog ram areas such as p u b l i c finance r e f o rm o r

i n i t i a t i n g programs in areas n o t covered by IDA such as env i ronmen ta l conservation and

across and between the IDA and t r u s t fund po r t fo l ios , with 48% o f to ta l grants linked to an 
IDA o r other t r u s t fund ac t iv i ty . The t r u s t fund review revealed the importance o f these 
synergies t o increasing the l i k e l i h o o d f o r ach iev ing impac t when ac t iv i t ies are f irm ly

Wha t Wo rked W e l l and Wha t Wo rked Less We l l 

77. 
The priorities set in the last CAS were aligned to Moldova’s longer-term 
development objectives identified in the EGPRSP. A c r i t ica l focus o f the Bank ’s 
strategy was o n supporting a stable macroeconomic framework-through 
he lp ing M o l d o v a 
to manage and reschedule debt and th rough a series o f analytic and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies 
(AAA) t o better understand and p romo te the factors needed f o r economic s tab i l i ty and 
sustainable, p ro -poo r economic g row th . The successful reduc t ion o f p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y 
guaranteed debt has im p r o v e d the prospects fo r the success o f donor assistance, thus 
making i t mo re likely that donors w i l l p r o v i d e add i t iona l support f o r development. The 
Government’s a b i l i t y t o ma in ta in a p ruden t f isca l stance has buoyed f isca l revenues, 
c rea t ing some f isca l space t o increase p u b l i c expenditures w i thou t inc reas ing the re la t ive 
size o f government. In short, IDA assistance has e f fec t ive ly supported Moldova in 
s tab i l iz ing i t s economy, con t inu ing t o reverse a decade o f economic decline and rising

Box 2. CAS Completion Report Lessons Learned 

Effective, efficient, and transparent public sector management i s increasingly important 
fo r achieving development objectives. Targeted support plays a critical ro le i n building 
country institutions, enhancing ministry capacity, and enabling the development and 
implementation o f longer term policies and, strategies. 
Increasing government ownership o f development efforts i s a priority: the m ix o f budget 
support, investment lending, and advisory services can be strategic in helping the 
Government strengthen i t s leadership ro le . 
IDA i s devoting only a small share o f the resources available from international donors 
for Moldova’s development, and these can be directed strategically to leverage support 
from other donors for optimal development impact. 
Analytic and advisory services can develop a be t ter understanding o f the linkages between 
economic growth and poverty reduction, particularly for the rural sector. 
Continual improvements to the results orientation o f the country program provide 
guidance for identifying, pursuing, and achieving project- and program-level outcomes.

8 1. Given that public domestic investment has remained very low, more support 
for public infrastructure was warranted than that envisaged by the previous CAS. 
In particular, the con t inued deterioration o f roads has had nega t ive imp l ica t ions f o r growth. 
The Transport Strategy within the EGPRSP focused o n r o a d rehab i l i ta t ion as a k e y factor 
in fac i l i ta t ing in te rna t iona l trade and transport, and the B a n k recogn ized the need t o add the 
Road Sector P rog ram Support P ro jec t after the C A S Progress Repo r t .

Continued efforts a re needed to deepen collaboration within the World Bank 
Group. The In te rna t iona l Finance Co rpo ra t ion (IFC) has rema ined ac t ive in Mo ldova , 
with a p o r t f o l i o o f about $30 m i l l i o n supporting power, telecommunications, agribusiness, 
sma l l and m e d i um enterprises, and l o c a l banks. Building o n IDA’S e f fo r ts in the hea l th and 
infrastructure sectors, I F C w i l l collaborate and complement IDA ’S w o r k with p u b l i c p r iva te

been ac t ive in Mo ldova , cove r ing pa r t o f a large-scale p ow e r sector p r iva t iza t ion e f fo r t that 
has also been supported by IFC . MIGA has recen t ly supported the start-up investment o f 
an Aus t r ian f inanc ia l i n s t i t u t i o n in i t s subsidiary in the leas ing sector. MIGA’s outstanding 
gross expenditure in M o l d o v a amounted t o nea r ly US $ 6 9 m i l l i o n in June 2008. MIGA

83. 
The results focus of the country program has been strengthened under the past 
CAS to better identify, pursue, and achieve outcomes at the project and program 
level. The evaluations o f the EGPRSP and the EU -M o l d o v a A c t i o n P l a n comp le ted in 
2006 and the t rans i t ion to the P B A system for IDA assistance have i n f o rm e d and p romo ted 
an ongo ing re f inemen t o f r e s u l t s measures in co l labo ra t ion with other donors. Within this 
context, the coun t ry team has developed a r e s u l t s scorecard (Annex 4) that i s expected t o 
serve as a regu la r and updateable t o o l t o better understand the l i n k s between the inputs, 
outputs and outcomes o f IDA -suppo r ted and trust-funded ac t iv i t ies . This scorecard has 
p rov ided a u s e f u l eva lua t ion o f the progress towards i n d i v i d u a l coun t ry outcomes under

Proposed World Bank Group Country Partnership Program 

8 5 . 

This results-based CPS aims to assist in laying the foundations for sustainable 
and inclusive economic growth in Moldova. The Bank’s strategy w i l l balance the 

ob jec t ives o f se lec t iv i ty and f l e x i b i l i t y , engag ing in areas where the Bank can best 
con t r ibu te t o desired coun t ry outcomes w h i l e also ad jus t ing f o r near-term p o l i t i c a l and 
econom ic changes. The expected outcomes o f this CPS f a l l within three pillars: (i) 
im p r o v i n g economic competitiveness t o support sustainable economic growth; (ii) 
m i n i m i z i n g social and env i ronmen ta l risks, building human capital, and p r om o t i n g soc ia l 
inc lus ion ; and (iii) im p r o v i n g p u b l i c sector governance. 

86 . 

This strategy i s directly aligned with Moldova’s National Development 

Strategy. The B a n k w i l l w o r k c lose ly with Gove rnmen t and other development partners in 
support o f t w o pillars o f the NDS: (i) enhancing economic competitiveness; and (ii) 
deve lop ing human resources, enhancing employment, and p romo t ing social inc lus ion . The 
consu l ta t ive process used in deve lop ing this CPS has identified those areas where the B a n k 
can best help achieve the strategic objectives set f o r t h in the NDS (Figure 2). 

87 . 

The choice of pillars for this CPS has been guided by the Government’s own 
development strategy, client perspectives, the lessons learned from the previous CAS, 
and the Bank’s understanding of Moldova’s development challenges. I t builds o n the 

strengths o f the p rev ious CAS , w h i c h i t s e l f was c lose ly a l igned with the Government’s 
development objectives as a r t icu la ted in the EGPRSP. I t promotes cross-sectoral 
co l labo ra t ion t o max im ize the impac t o f interventions, and leverages other donor partners’ 
resources. As exp la ined below, the f i r s t p i l l a r brings together a diverse se t o f ana ly t ica l and 
ope ra t iona l ac t iv i t ies t o enhance M o l d o v a ’ s competitiveness, bolster and deepen the r e f o rm 
e f fo r ts supported by the p rev ious CAS , and assist the Government’s e f f o r t t o accelerate 
economic g row th . The second pillar, o n the other hand, b r ings together a menu o f 
in te rven t ions t o help M o l d o v a make full use o f i t s human resources. This includes the 
e f fo r ts t o build capacity, p romo te s k i l l s development, and p rov ide adequate social and 
env i ronmen ta l p ro tec t ion . The third p i l l a r p rov ides crosscutting support f o r a l l o f the 
strategic goals o f the CPS by p r om o t i n g better governance and modern, e f f ic ien t , p u b l i c 
ins t i tu t ions .

Operational Principles 

8 8 . 
This CPS reflects a strategic transition from the previous CAS through a two - 
step process. The f i r s t stage involves scaling up interventions and programs that are 
wo rk ing we l l w i th in the existing po r t fo l io during FY 0 9 and FY10. D u r i n g the second 
stage, interventions w i l l be defined in more specific t e rm s fo r the remaining years o f the 
CPS period. This approach allows the Bank some f lex ib i l i ty to adjust the po r t fo l io as 
needed in response to i s s u e s emerging after the upcoming e lec t ions or as a result o f a 
regional financial c r i s i s . Second-stage interventions w i l l be clearly described in the CPS 
Progress Report, and the t im ing o f this report w i l l be advanced i f appropriate to ensu re that 
refinements to the country program a re t ime ly and effective. 

89 . 
The Bank Group’s program of support for Moldova w i l l capitalize on those 
areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage for optimal impact. Moldova’s 
National Development Strategy embraces European integration as a central objective, and 
the country i s collaborating increasingly w i t h European institutions and receiving aid f rom 
a wide range o f donors. In this context, the Bank should be strategic in i t s engagement, not 
only in terms o f where to direct IDA resources and associated Trust Funds but also in t e r m s 
o f how to best leverage i t s ow n internal partnerships. For example, I FC can play a c r i t ica l 
role in ensuring that the Bank’s program appropriately addresses the needs o f the private 
sector w i th in the r e s u l t s framework set fo r th b y the CPS. 

90 . 
The effectiveness of this engagement w i l l rely on strong coordination and 
harmonization with other development efforts. In some cases, the Bank’s expertise or 

29 

established presence in an area w i l l warrant that i t lead a mu l t i -dono r development e f fo r t . 
The presence o f partners can substantially increase the returns o n the Bank ’s investments. 
Howeve r , in other cases, IDA assistance o r other B a n k resources might not add su f f ic ien t 
value f o r in i t ia t ives already heav i ly supported by other dono r efforts. A b o v e all, close 
coo rd ina t ion among donors i s ca l led f o r t o m i n im i z e the adm in is t ra t ive burden and 
transaction costs f o r M o l d o v a . G i v e n limited IDA and adm in is t ra t ive budget, the Bank ’s 
choices f o r engagement w i l l be gu ided by: (i) c l ien t ownership, (ii) consistency with B a n k 
p r io r i t ies , (iii) willingness o f donors t o p rov ide adm in is t ra t ive budget when the Bank i s 
requested t o t a k e a lead role, and (iv) poss ib i l i t ies fo r add ing t o IDA f inanc ing t o ma te r ia l ly 
increase the effectiveness o f IDA funds. 

91. 
Flexibility w i l l be central to the Bank’s approach to allow f o r adaptation to 
changing economic and political contexts. Since M o l d o v a ’ s per cap i ta income recen t ly 
exceeded the IDA threshold, the coun t ry i s en te r ing a t rans i t ion period-possibly m o v i n g 
t o lend ing f r o m the IBRD. The Bank ’s coun t ry p rog ram w i l l therefore adjust the use o f 
instruments as appropriate, s t i l l using a l l available IDA assistance but l i k e l y investing l e s s 
in p ro jec ts and m o r e in ana ly t ic and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (AAA) over t im e as w o u l d b e f i t a 
m i d d l e income coun t ry . Given the add i t iona l costs o f adm in is te r ing Trust Funds, the B a n k 
w i l l also be mo re strategic in their use t o ensure that they d i rec t ly comp lemen t IDA and 
AAA ac t iv i t ies . The coun t ry i s also fac ing some p o l i t i c a l uncertainty, with a new 
government expected in 2009 , and co l labo ra t ion with the new government c o u l d warrant 
some changes. The e v o l v i n g s i tua t ion with regard t o T ransn is t r ia might also open up 
poss ib i l i t ies f o r engagement there th rough M o l d o v a n gove rnmen t - led programs. l 4 F ina l ly , 
new areas o f engagement such as c l ima te change c o u l d ga in impo r tance during this CPS 
pe r iod and requ i re that the coun t ry p rog ram be adapted t o take advantage o f ex is t ing and 
new instruments, i n c l u d i n g Ca rbon Finance Funds and the newly created C l ima te 
Inves tmen t Funds. 

9 2 . 
A l l activities and resou rces delivered as p a r t o f the Bank’s program w i l l 
adhere to the results framework, w i th clear milestones to monitor implementation 
and country outcomes through which to gauge impact. This results-based CPS calls f o r 
IDA assistance and any other Bank resources, i n c l u d i n g Trust Funds, t o be used o n l y f o r 
ac t iv i t ies that are rea l is t ic in scope and tha t are expected t o d i rec t ly in f luence CPS 
outcomes. Given the tens ion between f l e x i b i l i t y and resu l ts , the Bank w i l l have a r o l l i n g 
r e s u l t s f ramewo rk w h i c h can be adjusted over time.

The CPS foresees a lending program o f t w o to three operations per year-at 
least one o f which would be budget support. Comm i tmen ts w i l l to ta l app rox ima te ly 
US$45-$50 m i l l i o n pe r annum, with the spec i f ic coun t ry a l loca t ion b e i n g determined 
annua l ly th rough IDA ’S performance-based a l loca t ion system. In addition, the B a n k w i l l 
consider add i t iona l f inanc ing t o ex is t ing operations within the current p o r t f o l i o and support 
f o r projects with regional or g loba l goods components. Ove ra l l , investment operations and 

l 4 A Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant to provide additional financing to the Social Investment 
Fund 2 for Transnistria has recently been approved. This i s the only activity involving Transnistria that i s 
currently envisioned under this CPS. 

30 

associated t r u s t funds w i l l build o n the Bank ’s t rack reco rd and comparative advantage vis- 
a-vis other partners and focus in those areas where other funding can be h i g h l y leveraged. 
The components o f the lending p rog ram w i l l be strategically selected and refined t o 
achieve targeted r e s u l t s for the three CPS p r io r i t ies : competitiveness, human resource 
development, and good governance. 

94. 
I t i s expected that Moldova w i l l fully utilize the IDA -15 lending envelope. 
Howeve r , the re m a y be circumstances under w h i c h the entire IDA envelope m a y n o t be 
able t o be u t i l i z e d due to: i) a p o l i t i c a l and/or economic governance env i ronmen t w h i c h i s 
non-conducive f o r lending; and/or ii) an extended p o l i t i c a l t rans i t ion pe r iod resu l t ing in 
insu f f ic ien t government capacity t o make e f fec t ive use o f IDA resources. 

9 5 . 

Partnerships within the Wo r ld Bank Group w i l l be leveraged strategically to 
better achieve the desired country development outcomes. B o t h I F C and MIGA w i l l 
con t inue the i r invo lvemen t in M o l d o v a and w i l l rema in open t o opportunities 
f o r 
suppo r t ing the competitiveness and p r iva te sector development p r io r i t ies . Poss ib ly areas o f 
co l labo ra t ion f o r the W o r l d Bank G roup are in the hea l th sector and in the in f ras t ruc tu re 
sector i f m o r e p r iva t iza t ion happens as a r e s u l t o f IDA ’S efforts. 

96. Moldova i s a strategic priority f o r IFC and during this CPS period IFC w i l l 
increase i t s investment activities and advisory services in the country. IFC ’ s m a i n goa l 
i s t o support private sector development, 
focus ing in pa r t icu la r o n f inanc ia l sector, 
agribusiness, healthcare and in f ras t ruc tu re mode rn iza t ion . I F C w i l l collaborate c lose ly with 
IDA in these areas. Discussions with the Gove rnmen t are already in progress o n the 
bene f i ts o f p u b l i c p r iva te partnership (PPP) f o r in f ras t ruc tu re modernization, and-in 
the 
hea l th sector-IFC w i l l collaborate with IDA o n a j o i n t p ro jec t t o assess h o w the r o l e o f 
the p r iva te sector can be increased. This assessment w i l l be f o l l ow e d by at least one PPP t o 
be structured by the M i n i s t e r o f H e a l t h with I FC ’ s support. In the rea l sector, I F C w i l l 
r em a i n oppo r tun is t ic and support companies f r o m the reg ion l o o k i n g t o expand and inves t 
in M o l d o v a . F o r example, in the te lecom and I C T sector, i f the government decides t o 
p r iva t ize Mo ld te lecom , I F C i s prepared t o consider adv iso ry services and investment t o 
support this process, as well as the nascent l o c a l I T industry, should an appropriate 
oppo r tun i ty arise. F ina l ly , I F C w i l l con t inue t o support reg iona l p r iva te equity funds w h i c h 
can p rov ide n o t o n l y scarce equity f inanc ing but also managerial and strategic support t o 
im p r o v e the competitiveness o f M o l d o v a n companies. 

97. 
IFC priority in Moldova i s to provide investments geared at strengthening the 
financial sector , expanding lending capacity and improving governance. The 
M o l d o v a n f inanc ia l system i s d rama t ica l ly underdeveloped and s u f f e r s f r o m a lack o f 
transparency and p o o r corporate governance practices. I F C w i l l provide c red i t l i n e s and 
adv iso ry services t o m a j o r banks f o r lending t o SME s w h i c h are s ign i f ican t ly underserved 
by the f inanc ia l sector. This support i s c ruc ia l f o r the sustainable development o f the 
p r iva te sector across M o l d o v a and w i l l con t r ibu te t o the increased compe t i t ion in the 
f inanc ia l sector as w e l l as create a demons t ra t ion e f fec t for other investors. In addition, I F C 
w i l l p romo te energy e f f ic iency c red i t l i n e s and the development o f non -bank f inanc ia l 
ins t i tu t ions . 

9 8 . When feasible, I F C w i l l l o o k to invest directly in companies operating in 

3 1 

agribusiness. I F C w i l l also w o r k with f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions w h i c h l e n d in the sector t o 
p rov ide long - te rm f inanc ing and capacity building adv iso ry services. F o r example, in

im p r o v e their incomes either by m o r e e f f ic ien t p roduc t ion o r by diversifying. 

99. 
M I G A w i l l continue to promote foreign direct investment in Moldova through 
the provision of political risk guarantees. MIGA w i l l support the investments o f reg iona l 
f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions geared at strengthening the f inanc ia l sector. In pa r t icu la r , M IGA w i l l 
con t inue t o support investments that p romo te the development o f non -bank f inanc ia l 
institutions. MIGA w i l l also consider oppo r tun i t ies in the in f ras t ruc tu re sector. M IGA w i l l 
coordinate i t s invo lvemen t in th is area with IDA. In addition, MIGA i s prepared t o support 
p ro jec ts in the agribusiness, manu fac tu r ing and services sectors. MIGA i s open t o 
suppo r t ing investments that p romo te the development o f SME s in M o l d o v a th rough i t s 
Sma l l Investment Program. 

100. During the implementation period of the CPS, discussions will take place with 
the authorities and within the Bank on a medium-term road map to IBRD status. An 
i n i t i a l c red i t assessment w i l l be undertaken by the IBRD C red i t Depa r tmen t in FY 0 9 . In 
parallel, the B a n k w i l l w o r k with the authorities t o strengthen debt management. E l i g i b i l i t y 
f o r IBRD loans w i l l depend o n Mo ldova ’s sustained and c red ib le t rack reco rd o f economic 
performance, and the c red i t assessment w i l l be based o n an analysis o f eight components o f 
creditworthiness: p o l i t i c a l risk, ex te rna l debt and liquidity, f isca l p o l i c y and p u b l i c debt 
burden, balance o f payments risks, economic structure and g r ow t h prospects, mone ta ry and 
exchange rate po l icy , f inanc ia l sector r isks , and corporate sector debt and vu lne rab i l i t ies . 

101. Analytic and advisory work will continue to be a co re element of the program, 
with the Bank shifting toward greater financing of AAA versus lending operations. 
The Bank w i l l continue as a lead ing external source o f economic and soc ia l analysis and 
w i l l use this analysis t o discuss p o l i c y choices with the authorities. A n a l y t i c a l work w i l l 
focus o n needed s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms and o n those issues mos t c r i t i c a l t o reduc ing the risks t o 
the popu la t ion posed by t rans i t ion and external shocks. F o r example, a C E M (FY09 ) w i l l 
enhance the ex is t ing body o f know ledge o n Mo ldova ’s competitiveness, constraints t o 
possible sources o f future economic growth, and p o l i c y options to ensure tha t future g r ow t h 
i s sustainable, broad-based, and able t o make full use o f Mo ldova ’s h um a n and f inanc ia l 
resources. As pa r t o f the broader t rans i t ion t o a blended or IBRD lending program, the 
B a n k w i l l make a sh i f t towa rd greater f inanc ing o f AAA versus lend ing operations with an 
emphasis in those areas where there are rea l know ledge gaps, e.g. c l ima te change, f o o d 
security, loca l governance, r u r a l pove r ty . 

102. The PRSC (and subsequent DPL) program w i l l remain the main policy-based 
lending instrument o f the Bank for providing support to the implementation of the 
NDS. The cross-sectoral PRSC agenda w i l l be e x p l i c i t l y aligned with EU budget support 
with the second 3-year series commenc ing in FY 1 0 . The comp lemen ta r i ty o f e f fo r ts 
between p rog ramma t ic support unde r the PRSC /DPL and inves tmen t lending w i l l be key t o 
making e f f ic ien t use o f B a n k resources, Synergies w i l l be found be tween po l icy -based 
lending, investment p ro jec ts and t r u s t funds t o support ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms and capacity 
building required fo r increased competitiveness and im p r o v e d governance-helping 
the 

32 

government rea l ize i t s v i s i o n o f a private-sector led economy. These inves tmen t projects 
support re fo rms in the areas o f bus iness env i ronmen t and the agricultural, environmental 
and ru ra l sectors. The Bank also supports a numbe r o f p ro jec ts a imed at im p r o v i n g the 
e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c sector resource use 
i n c l u d i n g m o r e e f fec t ive and transparent 
management o f p u b l i c finances as w e l l as broader p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion re fo rm efforts. 
B a n k operations have also focused o n im p r o v i n g resource use in specific sectors, inc lud ing 
energy, water and sanitation, and road infrastructure. In the soc ia l sectors, B a n k support i s 
p rov ided in the con tex t o f human development programs in health, education, and social 
p ro tec t ion as well as in support o f the government in sca l ing up e f fo r ts t o imp rove the 
ta rge t ing e f f ic iency o f social assistance programs. 

103. The Bank w i l l also make further progress toward programmatic approaches 
and budget support modalities in selected sectors, reducing the number o f active 
operations by the end o f FY12. This move must go hand - in -hand with demonstrated and 
measured progress by the Government in im p r o v i n g the coun t ry systems and mo re 
transparent and accountable sectoral investment planning (e. g., infrastructure, health, and 
education) as w e l l as strengthened p u b l i c i n f o rm a t i o n disclosure mechanisms, and 
increased e f f ic iency o f government services (e.g., e-solutions, i n c l u d i n g e-government and 
e-procurement). T h e B a n k w i l l assess how best t o support these e f fo r ts during the CPS 
pe r iod . To support the m o v e t o coun t ry systems, a Coun t ry Systems Assessmen t - a 
p rog ramma t ic approach t o assessing government systems - w i l l incorporate CPAR , C F A A , 
PEFA , and other diagnostic too ls as appropriate. 

104. Non - IDA W o r l d Bank-administered projects financed by trust funds and other 
grants w i l l be strategically integrated into the Bank Group’s country partnership 
program. With nea r ly h a l f (48%) o f t r u s t funds d i rec t ly comp lemen t ing ex is t ing B a n k 
operations, grant support w i l l rema in c r i t ica l f o r ach iev ing results across a l l th ree pillars o f 
this CPS. The B a n k w i l l be more strategic in i t s use o f non-IDA resources t o ensure that 
they: (i) con t r ibu te t o the objectives and outcomes o f the CPS; and (ii) do not put add i t iona l 
stress o n the adm in is t ra t ive budget. A review o f the T k s t Fund p o r t f o l i o was conducted in 
F Y 0 9 with a view t o putting a f ramewo rk in p lace that strengthens the l inkage between 
t r u s t funds, strategic p r io r i t ies and CPS outcomes, and p rov ides a basis f o r exercising 
selectivity. 

105. The Bank’s wo r k on governance and anti-corruption w i l l be consistent w i th 
the Bank’s recently approved corporate strategy.I5 As with other key r e f o rm areas, 
coun t ry owne rsh ip and leadership are c r i t ica l in this area together with the coordinated 
roles o f other donors. This i s the o n l y way tha t the Bank’s p r o g r am can make a decisive 
difference in the p e r i o d o f the proposed engagement strategy and im p r o v e Mo ldova ’s 
standing o n various comparative governance measures. T h e proposed engagement w i l l 
inc lude an advocacy r o l e f o r re fo rms on governance and measures t o address corruption, 
seek t o develop areas in w h i c h the government and the B a n k have c omm o n goals, and 
ensure that appropriate f iduc ia ry oversight i s app l ied t o p roposed resource transfers f r o m 
the Bank, during preparation, implementation, as well as th rough regu la r p o r t f o l i o reviews..

I n addition, the Bank will emphasize the need f o r good governance f o r 
harnessing a competitive business environment. This focus w i l l include: (i) con t inu ing 
the 
imp lemen ta t ion assistance f o r compe t i t ion and regu la to ry r e f o rm and cu rb ing 
bureaucratic discretion; (ii) strengthening the financial intermediatiodinfrastructure in the

assistance o f the Vienna Center fo r Corporate F inanc ia l Reporting; (iii) addressing 
competitiveness gaps by further development o f the expo r t po ten t ia l f o r the ag r icu l tu ra l 
sector; and (iv) engaging the p r iva te sector o n strengthening the demand s ide for good 
governance. Annex 2 elaborates the proposed p rog ram o f support f o r C G A C ac t iv i t ies . 
The p roposed ac t iv i t ies a re fully integrated with the objectives o f this CPS and w o u l d help 
t o achieve greater depth and sustainability o f the CPS objectives by strengthening the 
demand s ide f o r good governance (DFGG). 

Proposed Program of Support 

107. The proposed program o f lending and AAA wo r k links systematically to the 
Bank’s ongoing portfolio to support the country development agenda set forth in the 
NDS. Tab le 6 p resen ts the ac t iv i t ies planned f o r FY09 and FY 10. As part o f the two-step 
approach set f o r t h in th is strategy, the lending in i ta l ics are we l l -pe r fo rm ing operations 
where add i t iona l resources can be absorbed t o assist in ach iev ing the CPS objectives. The 
AAA p r o g r am supported by the CPS contains core diagnostic studies and ESW t o 
strengthen the capacity f o r im p r o v e d governance m a i n l y o n the supply side, and also o n the 
demand side, e.g. p r om o t i n g greater transparency and accoun tab i l i ty o f public and p r iva te 
ins t i tu t ions . The t w o year p rog ram adheres t o the se lec t iv i ty p r inc ip les se t ou t in paragraph 
90 as i t re f lec ts e x p l i c i t requests f r o m the government o f M o l d o v a (client ownership) and 
b u i l d s o n existing, successful IDA operations (comparative advantage). P rog ramm ing 
decisions beyond FYlO w i l l be guided by CPS operational p r inc ip les and p r io r i t ies tha t 
m a y emerge in the course o f the nex t t w o years (e.g. roads, ag r icu l tu ra l competitiveness, 
f o o d safety, trade, de ins t i tu t iona l iza t ion , energy e f f ic iency , p u b l i c sector reform). 

108. This proposed program i s designed to achieve progress under the three CPS 
pillars by focusing on ten strategic goals. T h e results m a t r i x (Annex 5) presents each o f 
these goals t o ou t l ine h o w the ongo ing p o r t f o l i o and the new p rog ram o f support b e l ow w i l l

Moldova’s enterprise sector will be augmented with an enhanced focus by I D A and 
I F C on the agro-processing sector. A d d i t i o n a l f inanc ing w i l l be added f o r the successful 
Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) and the R u r a l Inves tmen t Support P ro jec t 2 
t o expand the scope and range o f available market-based instruments. This add i t iona l 
p ro jec t f inanc ing i s expected t o fac i l i ta te the g r ow t h o f the expo r t -o r ien ted rea l sector with

exporters, and (iii) the p r o v i s i o n o f in te rna t iona l ly recogn ized labo ra to ry testing services t o 
l o c a l producers, particularly in the area o f f o o d safety. The envisaged lending w i l l be 
strategic t o increase M o l d o v a ’ s export o f goods and attract fo re ign investments and w i l l be 
i n f o rm e d by comp lemen ta ry analytic wo rk . 

110. Developing the key physical infrastructure o f Moldova i s integral to improved 
competitiveness and will be continued under this CPS. To decrease road use r costs, 
add i t iona l f inanc ing c o u l d be p rov ided for the Roads Sector Support Program, and the 
Bank’s co l labo ra t ion with M o l d o v a and other donors w i l l con t inue o n the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the Transport Sector Strategy. Assistance f o r decreasing e lec t r ic powe r losses and 
reduc ing Mo ldova ’s energy in tens i ty w i l l inc lude scaled up f inanc ing f o r the successful 
Energy 2 project, together with SIDA. 
In addition, a complementary set o f lending,

po r t fo l io , e.g. the Soc ia l Inves tmen t Fund, the H e a l t h and Soc ia l Assistance project, etc. 

11 1. Assistance under the second pillar comprises a coordinated and cross-sectoral 
program to build human capital, promote soc ia l inclusion, and minimize social and 
environmental risks. A d d i t i o n a l f inanc ing w i l l build o n the successes o f the ongo ing 
M o l d o v a Soc ia l Inves tmen t Fund 2 and H e a l t h and Soc ia l Assistance projects, i n c l u d i n g

outcomes-particularly 
pove r ty reduction, increased access t o q u a l i t y education programs, 
and improved hea l th ind ica to rs . Given the importance o f p r o v i d i n g oppo r tun i t ies f o r you th 
t o stay in M o l d o v a and con t r ibu te t o economic g row th , the coun t ry t e am w i l l con t inue t o 
identify ways t o ma ins t ream this agenda i n t o the on -go ing and future w o r k p rog ram . In 
particular, the B a n k w i l l con t inue t o w o r k closely with the Y o u t h V o i c e G roup w h i c h has 
already been ex t reme ly ac t ive in p r om o t i n g the c l ima te change and good governance 
agendas th roughou t M o l d o v a . The c l ima te change agenda w i l l be mainstreamed in to the 
CPS starting in F Y 0 9 with a s tock tak ing assessment and an i d e n t i f i c a t i o n o f fu tu re entry 
po in ts in the coun t ry program, e.g. th rough further carbon f inanc ing , c l ima te investment 
funds, etc. On -go ing support f o r im p r o v e d water and sanitation and achievement o f the 
MDG in this area w i l l con t inue t o be a p r i o r i t y under this CPS. Close donor coo rd ina t ion 

in this area w i l l be c r i t ica l . 

112. The third pillar o f the proposed program w i l l provide crosscutting support for 

36 

Moldova to strengthen its public sector governance. A comb ina t ion o f interventions- 
supported by m u l t i p l e donors-will 
he lp M o l d o v a in im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f regu la to ry 
services, deve lop ing and imp lemen t ing sound p u b l i c policies, and strengthening processes 
f o r a l loca t ing resources. 
In addition, the CPS p rog ram w i l l launch an in tense e f fo r t at 
awareness generation and greater pa r t ic ipa t ion o f citizens in the demand f o r good 
governance. 

11 3 . 
I n support o f the CPS results, the AAA program w i l l underpin the lending 
program. The AAA w i l l a im t o p rov ide timely know ledge and input t o Government 
po l ic ies and i n f o r m the on -go ing development debate in the country, e.g. pensions, 
telecoms and IC T , energy, demand-side governance, trade, env i ronmen ta l i s s u e s (climate 
change, forestry). In addition, this CPS reflects a p rog ramma t ic approach t o AAA p lann ing 
w h i c h w i l l include an ove ra l l assessment o f government systems to identify opportunities 
f o r the increased use o f coun t ry systems in selected sectors and projects. This component 
w i l l be c r i t i c a l f o r suppo r t ing Mo ldova ’s con t inued e f fo r ts at statistical capacity building. 
The AAA p r o g r am w i l l be c lose ly coordinated with t h e government and other development 

partners.

Partnerships 
114. 1DA’~s partnership with the IMF in Moldova’s development strategy has been 
strong ove r the past few years. B a n k and IMF staffs have executed j o i n t w o r k and have 
con t inued t o ca r ry out j o i n t missions at least tw i c e a year f o r macroeconomic p o l i c y 
dialogue with the Government. The IMF p o l i c y dialogue with the Gove rnmen t takes place 
in the con tex t o f the ongo ing PRGF, cove r ing the 2006-2008 pe r iod . The PRSC has been 
prepared in con junc t ion with the PRGF t o ensure the consistency o f the macroeconomic 
and structural p o l i c y re fo rms supported by b o t h programs. The IMF i s tak ing the lead o n 
macroeconomic issues w h i l e IDA t a k e s the lead o n structural and soc ia l issues . In a number 
o f areas where the mandates o f the t w o institutions overlap, such as p u b l i c finance, the 
w o r k i s b e i n g c lose ly coordinated t o ensure that consistent advice i s provided t o the 
authorities. The existence o f an IMF program, se t to expire n e x t year, has been an 
impo r tan t input f o r the de te rm ina t ion o f the adequacy o f the macroeconomic p o l i c y 
f ramewo rk . 

115. The Bank has been active in helping to improve donor coordination. M o l d o v a 
has w o r k e d with donors to ha rmon ize development e f fo r ts and has achieved substantial 
progress since 2006 (B o x 4). Alignment between the Econom ic Growth and Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper and the Eu ropean Un ion -Repub l ic o f M o l d o v a A c t i o n P lan and 
the w i l l ingness o f external partners-including 
the US , the EU, the UN, Sweden, DFID, 
the Swiss, and the -Dutch-to 
a l i g n the i r assistance with the EGPRSP ( n ow NDS), has 
fac i l i ta ted coo rd ina t ion o n the ground. The B a n k has wo rked c lose ly with other donors 
b o t h in ana ly t ica l w o r k and in i n d i v i d u a l lend ing operations. 

1 16. The harmonization process was carried forward through a Development 
Partnership Framework designed to 
implement the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness. The f ramewo rk , “Co -o rd ina t ion and Ha rmon iza t ion o f Government and 
D o n o r Practices for Aid Effectiveness in the Repub l ic o f Moldova,” was signed by the 
Government, IDA, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, UN, IMF and EU in Ch is inau

and b i l a t e r a l donors . The emphasis o f these donor e f fo r ts varies somewhat depending o n 

their expe r t ise and se lec t iv i ty as f o l l ow s : 

The United Na t ions Deve lopmen t Programme’s n ew strategy f o r 2007-1 1 focuses on: 
(i) governance and pa r t ic ipa t ion ; (ii) access t o social services; and (iii) reg iona l and 
loca l development. 

The EU coun t ry assistance strategy 
for 2007 -1 1 emphasizes: (i) democratic 
development and good governance; (ii) regu la to ry r e f o rm and adm in is t ra t ive capacity 
building; and (iii) pove r ty reduc t ion and economic g row th . A three-year EU /M o l d o v a 
A c t i o n P lan was approved in February 2005. The last progress repo r t on the A c t i o n 
P lan was issued in February 2008. 

The EBRD coun t ry assistance strategy (approved by i t s B o a r d in September 2007) 
focuses o n p r iva te sector development, i n c l u d i n g support t o f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions and 
public infrastructure. 

Key p r io r i t ies f o r US AID inc lude im p r o v i n g the env i ronmen t f o r p r iva te sector 
development, p r om o t i n g strong commun i t ies and accountable democratic institutions, 
and helping con t ro l mos t dangerous p u b l i c hea l th threats. 

G o o d governance i s a m a j o r area o f focus f o r SIDA, DFID, and the Ne the r lands among 
others. SIDA also supports energy e f f ic iency and ru ra l inves tmen t while DFID 
emphasizes p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion reform, and social 
assistance. The Ne the r lands has recen t ly approved a grant t o enhance the regu la to ry 
and supervisory f ramewo rk for non -bank f inanc ia l institutions. 

In December 2006, M o l d o v a rece ived a US$24 .7 m i l l i o n grant f r o m the Millennium

o r e f o rm and imp rove the capacity o f the Center f o r Comba t ing Econom ic Crimes 
and Co r rup t ion . 
The Government has submitted t o M C C in early 2008 their compact p roposa l w h i c h 
includes i r r i g a t i o n and roads. 

Cen t ra l European countries, i n c l u d i n g Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic, L a t v i a 
and L i thuan ia also p r o v i d e assistance, mos t ly in the areas o f capacity building and good 
governance. 

1 18. The Government and its development partners have recently expressed 
interest in a joint approach to help Moldova ove r the upcoming period, utilizing the 
newly designed National Development Strategy as the overarching framework in this 
process. 
In support o f this j o i n t approach, the development partners have launched a 
d i v i s i o n o f labo r and m a p p i n g exercise (Annex 6). The ra t iona le b e h i n d this exercise i s to : 
(i) p rov ide a use fu l , h igh - leve l ove rv iew o f O f f i c i a l Deve lopmen t Assistance support t o 
Mo ldova ’s new ND S , and (ii) map and a l i g n projects/programs with the results o f the 
N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy t o better ensure coordination, a v o i d dup l ica t ion , and 
u l t ima te ly t o make development assistance mo re e f f ic ien t and e f fec t ive . I t i s anticipated 
that imp lemen ta t ion rev iews and m o n i t o r i n g o f progress toward NDS outcomes w o u l d 
occur o n a regular basis, p r o v i d i n g opportunities to seek add i t iona l support o r r e f i n e 
imp lemen ta t ion strategies as needed t o achieve the intended results. 

I V . MANAG ING AND MON ITOR ING TH E COUNTRY PROGRAM 
A. Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation 
119. The success of the Bank’s strategy in Moldova will be measured by the 
achievement of CPS outcomes aligned to selected priorities set forth in Moldova’s 
National Development Strategy 2008-201 1. The results f ramewo rk 
i d e n t i f i e s the 
outcomes t o w h i c h the CPS i s expected t o contribute and p rov ides measurable ind ica to rs t o 
assess the achievement o f each outcome. Mid-term progress ind ica to rs i d e n t i f y key p o l i c y 
re fo rms and actions needed t o achieve CPS outcomes. The core CPS ind ica to rs identified 
in the r e s u l t s f ramewo rk are summarized in F igu re 3 . 

’ 

120. The results framework will guide the Bank in monitoring progress and 
modifying the strategy as necessary to remain a relevant and effective development 
partner. This m a t r i x (Annex 5 ) l i n k s the B a n k Group’s lend ing , investments, and non - 
lending ac t iv i t ies t o spec i f ic outcomes and specifies milestones and target values t o assess 
whether imp lemen ta t ion and outcomes are occu r r ing as planned. This r e s u l t s f ramewo rk 
reflects the e v o l v i n g results-oriented focus o f the coun t ry p o r t f o l i o described p rev ious ly 
and has bene f i ted in pa r t icu la r f rom : (i) the increasing rigor o f r e s u l t s f ramewo rks f o r mo re 
recent projects, (ii) increased capacity o f coun t ry systems as supported by the Bank and the 
W o r l d Bank I n s t i t u t e (WBI) f o r monitoring and evaluation, and (iii) the development o f a 
r e s u l t s scorecard t o support management in m o n i t o r i n g the p o r t f o l i o ’ s performance vis-a- 

39 

v is country outcomes, the quality o f the r e s u l t s orientation in each individual activity- 
inc lud ing those financed by t r u s t funds-and 
the Bank’s contribution to management for 
r e s u l t s at the country level. This evolution has warranted substantial departure f rom the 
results matrix presented in the last CAS. The matrix o f r e s u l t s targeted b y the CPS builds 
strongly on the activities in the existing po r t fo l io and the additional financing programmed 
fo r FY09 and FY 10. Adjustments w i l l be made at mid-term to incorporate new activities 
planned in the outer years o f the CPS, recognizing that in most instances implementation 
w i l l not progress fast enough to contribute to long-term development outcomes during the 
planning horizon o f this strategy.

121. Plans for monitoring and evaluation under this CPS w i l l capitalize on 
opportunities for increased harmonization. To this end, indicators f rom the NDS have 

been incorporated in to the resu l ts framework where appropriate and the Bank w i l l re ly on 
country data systems and unified reporting systems where feasible. The Bank w i l l also 
monitor the share o f IDA commitments in pooled funding arrangements and the share o f 
on-going IDA operations using regular j o i n t donor supervision missions. 

122. The Bank w i l l actively monitor implementation progress of the CPS with the 
Government and key partners through annual NDSKPS implementation reviews. 

The r e s u l t s scorecard w i l l be one too l used in this process, and the Bank w i l l increasingly 
use NDS outcome indicators and country based systems fo r measuring resu l ts .

B. Managing Risks 
123. 
The risks for this CPS include (i) fiduciary r isks ; (ii) implementation capacity at the 
central and decentralized level; (iii) external shocks; and (iv) po l i t ica l economy risks. 

124. The fiduciary risk in Bank-financed projects in Moldova i s substantial, and 
above the ECA averages. Lessons learned under past country assistance strategies have 
underscored that due diligence and caution i s required in using the country systems t o 
implement new projects. However, the residual risk does not prohibit increased use o f 
country systems for se lec ted sectors and projects to the max imum extent possible. 
M i t iga t ing fiduciary risks b y imp rov ing fiduciary controls at sectoral and project levels and 
assisting Mo ldova w i t h imp rov ing transparency and strengthening the capacity o f the 
government public procurement and public financial management systems, as w e l l as 
f ind ing optimal project implementation arrangements that use country systems where 
reliable w i l l be the ma in fiduciary po r t fo l io management priorities over the next CPS cyc le . 
The PRSC program, as w e l l as the Bank’s and donor’s wo rk in these areas, i s already 
p rov id ing assistance to the Government in this endeavor. 

125. The Government has limited institutional capacity which could delay the 
implementation of its ambitious reform agenda. Mos t l i n e ministries s t i l l have l im i ted 
capacity for the systematic selection and appraisal o f projects, implementation, and 
evaluation and this may lead to the sub-optimal allocation o f budgetary resources. To 
mitigate these risks, a l l the reform areas benefit f rom Bank and donor-supported TA and 
capacity bu i ld ing programs or investment operations. In areas where donor engagement i s 
limited, implementation risk w i l l l ike ly remain high. 

126. Greater integration into the global economy, both with respect to trade and 
labor flows (i.e. remittances), makes Moldova more vulnerable to external market 
developments. For example, the recent turbulence in global financial markets may have 
adverse e f f e c t s on Mo ldova through, among other things, a growth slowdown among i t s 
ma in trading partners and among the major host countries o f Moldova’s migrant workers. 
These may have significant poverty implications at the household level, depending on 
households’ relative dependence on remittances and their sectors o f employment. In 
addition, foreign i n f l ow o f capital may f a l l due to a global tightening o f credit. This may, in 
turn, dampen economic activity and j o b creation. Furthermore, the p r ice o f natural gas 
imports to Mo ldova w i l l r i s e to European levels over t h e next th ree years. Higher electricity 
p r ices f rom Ukraine are also forthcoming. Higher energy p r ices may have significant 
poverty implications w i t h the burden o f the p r ice increase fa l l ing disproportionately on the 
poor and on households with limited alternative sources o f fue l . R is ing food pr ices , 
stemming f rom e i the r domestic or international sources, i f they outstrip income growth, 
could have a disproportional impact on poor households. 

127. The Bank, the IMF and other donors, have shown flexibility in the amount of 
available financing to respond, i f needed, to external shocks. A grant o f US$7 million 
approved in August, 2008 under the G loba l Fast-Track Fac i l i ty fo r the Food Crisis w i l l 
help to mitigate some o f the impact o f r is ing food p r ices in 2 0 0 8 / 9 . Under the PRSC 
program, the Bank i s promoting re fo rms to improve the efficiency o f the energy and 
agricultural sectors as well as the Government’s social assistance system. As demonstrated 

41 

at the Consu l ta t ive G roup meeting, M o l d o v a w i l l be the rec ip ien t o f considerable donor 
f inanc ing in the c om i n g years. 
128. A n u m b e r o f r e f o rm s - c i v i l service, educa t ion and a g r i c u l t u r a l r e f o r m - cou ld 
b e po l i t ica l ly cha l leng ing as n e x t yea r ’s elections draw closer. Under the EGPRSP and 
the NDS, M o l d o v a has a r t icu la ted an amb i t ious r e f o rm p rog ram . Over the last few years, 
the Government has established a steady t rack reco rd o f re fo rm , a lbe i t with some e f fo r ts 
proceeding faster than others. The extensive consultations su r round ing the development o f 
the NDS ind ica te that a high degree o f p o l i t i c a l consensus has been established beh ind this 
r e f o rm p rog ram . A l o n g with the rea f f i rma t ion o f Mo ldova ’s EU aspiration, th is gives 
com fo r t that the agenda l a i d ou t in the NDS w i l l be pursued. These l o om i n g elections m a y 
have an impac t o n the p o l i t i c a l consensus that has developed b e h i n d the Government’s 
re fo rm program; however, the close linkage between the Bank-supported r e f o rm agenda 
and substantial donor assistance (DFID, S IDA , the Netherlands and EU) p lanned f o r 
M o l d o v a continues t o be a m i t i g a t i n g factor.

ANNEX 1: MOLDOVA AND THE MDGP 

The baseline year for establishing the medium- and long-term targets w i l l be the same as in 
the i n i t i a l MDG report (2002), except for cases when the estimation methodology was 
recently mod i f ied for some indicators. [Important to show actual resu l ts against these ] 

Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 
Reduce the proportion o f people whose consumption i s under $4.3 a day/person (in 
PPP t e rm s ) f rom 34.5% in 2006 down to 29% in 2010 and 23% in 2015.

ANNEX 2: MOLDOVA COUNTRY GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION 
STRATEGY 

Executive Summary 

G iven the current development path and institutional environment in Moldova, governance 
remains a significant challenge 
to growth and poverty reduction. Weak governance, 
uncompetitive private sector, and fragmented c i v i l society together create a dynamic cycle where 
a large part o f the active population migrates abroad instead o f being agents fo r wealth creation 
at home. The Government recognizes governance and anti-corruption as a defining challenge; 
however, the authorities’ commitment has not been consistent and the track record uneven. 
Recently government anti-corruption efforts seem to have accelerated, but the resu l ts remain to 
be seen. 

Mo ldova CGAC Objectives. The longer-term objective o f the Bank’s CGAC strategy i s to assist 
Mo ldova in developing sustainable rule-based governance, wh ich w i l l support the p ro -EU choice 
b y closing some o f the major gaps between the quality o f Moldova’s institutions and that o f 
institutions in the member states. Over the mid term, the CPS governance program w i l l be geared 
to assist the Government in achieving macroeconomic predictability, sustainability and a gradual 
transition: away f rom the remittance economy and towards sustained competitiveness, a healthy 
business environment, and investment in human development. The principles guiding the CPS 
are to find new entry points fo r supplying good governance, complement these with selected and 
promising demand-side interventions, and effectively leverage our limited resources through 
selectivity and partnerships. 

Approach, Trade-Ofls, and Selectivity. The lessons f rom the unfinished reform agenda and the 
2004 CAS resu l ts , which primarily emphasized supply-side governance, prompted a renewed Bank 
approach. The elements o f this approach are : 

A l i g n Mo ldova CGAC with the objectives of National Development Strategy (NDS) and 

generally adopt an approach that emphasizes country leadership b y wo rk ing on strengthening 
country systems, inc lud ing public procurement; 
Consequently, approach the governance challenge in Mo ldova as bo th one of the CPS 
pillars as we l l as a cross-cutting platform underpinning the remaining two CPS pillars - - 
Competitiveness and Human Development; 
Continue to engage w i t h the government on the supply side of good governance through 
the PRSC series, the unfinished pub l ic governance re fo rm agenda (PFM, P A R and CSR), 
by stepping up implementation o f e-services for bus inesses and citizens and through 
measures to create a competitive business environment, but recognize the progress along 
these dimensions may continue to be gradual; 

Put incremental efforts and resources in to measures to strengthen the demand s ide fo r 

good governance (DFGG) at the country, sector and project level; 

Support donors’ lead in the anti-corruption effort where they have active programs and 

comparative advantage; and continue to provide public goods for cross-country governance 
monitoring and analysis.

Proposed Entry Points and Program. At the coun t ry level, the ongo ing p u b l i c sector r e f o rm 
agenda, imp lemen ted th rough PRSC p o l i c y lending, P S M r e f o rm grants and technical assistance, 
w i l l rema in a m a i n en t ry p o i n t f o r push ing ahead with re fo rms o f the central governance systems 
and reduc ing oppo r tun i t ies and incentives f o r corruption. Imp lemen ta t ion o f e-governance 
solutions f o r f inanc ia l management, procurement, and service de l ive ry w i l l also imp rove 
governance and reduce opportunities f o r co r rup t ion . Building o n the good progress made with 
p u b l i c finance management reforms, the B a n k w i l l extend i t s e f fo r ts o n the coun t ry systems 
agenda, with a focus o n p u b l i c procurement, in te rna l and external aud i t as well as building 
capacity in central and l i n e ministries f o r performance related budget management. This w i l l 
p rov ide the founda t ion f o r a gradual t rans i t ion towards greater budget support, as requested by 
the authorities. 

Specific en t ry po in ts f o r the G A C strategy at the coun t ry and sectoral l e v e l m a y inc lude : 

Im p r o v i n g the sectoral investment planning in infrastructure, health, and education; 
R e f o rm the civil service pay system t o increase performance incentives; 
Strengthen the public information disclosure mechanisms t o im p r o v e feedback loops; 

Deve lopmen t o f the export potential f o r the agricultural sector and p r om o t i n g f o o d 

security w i t h o u t d is to r t ing p roduc t ion incentives t o increase r u r a l incomes and reduce 
incentives f o r ou twa rd m ig ra t ion ; 
Increasing the transparency in corporate financial reporting thereby attracting greater 
outside inves tmen t f lows ; 

Strengthening the banking sector and financial intermediation f o r flows o f remittances 

t o make them available f o r investment; 
Increasing the e f f ic iency o f government services by app l ica t ion o f e-governance solutions 
(e.g. e-government; e-procurement); 

Addressing the Demand f o r G o o d Governance (DFGG) by engaging vulnerable actors 

with upwa rd (middle class) po ten t ia l and longe r te rm stakes in good governance - e.g. c i v i c 
and p r iva te sector associations th rough building capacity f o r advocacy and co l lec t ive

R isks and M i t iga t ion . The investment p o r t f o l i o w i l l continue t o face f iduc ia ry risks; yet the B a n k 
shou ld continue t o p romo te the use o f coun t ry systems f o r selected sectors and projects, where 
residual risks a re n o t p r o h i b i t i v e after m i t iga t ion . The m a i n m i t i g a t i o n measures 
f o r 
strengthening the f iduc ia ry con t ro ls at the p o r t f o l i o and p ro jec t leve ls w i l l inc lude : (i) invest in a 
deeper understanding o f SOEs and state corporate entities’ management, strategic investment 
planning, and cap i ta l budge t ing t o build the p o l i c y dialogue in these areas; (ii) further building 
capacity f o r im p r o v i n g the p u b l i c procurement system, (iii) finding an o p t im a l PMU t rans i t ion

Governance, Growth and Poverty Reduction 
1. Moldova’s recent high growth has been driven by increased domestic consumption, 
migration and remittances but there a re strong doubts concerning the sustainability o f this 
model over the medium-term. Mo ldova ’s g r ow t h and pove r ty a l lev ia t ion achievements have 
been impressive- an average economic g r ow t h o f 7.0 percent annua l ly since 2001 and noticeable 
imp rovemen ts in the t rans i t ion indicators. Remittances i n f l ow s a re likely t o be reduced 
s ign i f ican t ly in the wake o f the g loba l economic c r is is at the s am e time as fo re ign direct 
investment and other cap i ta l i n f l ow s su f fer , f o r c i n g a retrenchment o f domestic demand and 
l ike ly slower g r ow t h in the near future. 

2 . Governance remains a significant challenge to growth and poverty reduction in 
Moldova. The composite p ic tu re that emerges f r o m the extensive ana ly t ica l and diagnostic w o r k 
conducted by the B a n k and other donors17 reveals governance obstacles and limited prospects f o r 
q u i c k wins. These l im i ta t ions a re complex, and a re due t o n o t o n l y external structural factors but 
also t o the p r e v a i l i n g value-sets and ins t i tu t iona l legacies. Progress i s s lowed b y insu f f ic ien t 
checks and balances that would prevent high concentrations o f state power, conduc ive for 
capture by special interests. The p r iva te sector i s weak and c i v i l society i s fragmented’*. In 
addition, Mo ldova ’s prospects t o j o i n the EU are r e r n ~ t e ’ ~ , and as a r e s u l t a strong anchor f o r 
ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm and im p r o v e d governance i s lack ing . D e s p i t e these constraints, M o l d o v a has 
rema ined comm i t ted t o ma rke t re fo rms and a compe t i t ive electoral process; most Mo ldovans 
p re fe r a democratic f o r m o f government. 

3 . Pervasive corruption contributes to a widespread culture o f cynicism and a sense that 
the public i s disenfranchised. Compared t o a sample o f fo rme r Soviet U n i o n (FSU) countries, 
M o l d o v a pe r fo rms better o r i s on par o n several pe r fo rmance indicators. (Fig.1). However, 
M o l d o v a remains an ou t l ie r o n “uno f f ic ia l ” payments f o r c i v i l courts, public education, and 
p u b l i c health. One - th i rd o f the popu la t ion believes that co r rup t ion has increased under this 
government2’. The same survey found that 70 percent o f the popu la t ion view co r rup t ion as 
widespread; 7 8 percent believed that co r rup t ion had recen t ly worsened in Mo ldova , and 64 
percent that co r rup t ion was “no rma l and inevitable.” C i t izens surveyed think the mos t co r rup t

f rom major donors the government began to upgrade legal and institutional capacity to reduce 
corruption and money laundering, and implement new legislative and po l icy instruments. 
Institutionally, Mo ldova optea 
to

the Center fo r Combating Economic 
Crimes and Corruption 
(CCECC), 
responsible 
fo r analysis, prevention,

that 
some 
CCECC 
investigations a re po l i t ica l ly motivated 
and focus on petty rather than “grand”

Nonetheless, progress measured b y the

resu l ts s t i l l r e m a i n to b e seen. The Na t iona l Development Strategy (NDS) signals a renewed 
government commitment to combat corruption. The NDS i d e n t i f i e s priorities such as jud ic ia l 
independence, further jud ic ia l system consolidation, curtailing the General Prosecutor’s 
extensive powers, and emphasizing preventive anti-corruption efforts.

2 ’ About 80 percent o f Moldovans believe that almost a l l c i v i l servants are corrupt; many citizens typically solve problems w i th 
the authorities by br ib ing c i v i l servant w i th money ( 7 3 percent), gifts (65 percent), or favors (60 percent). Since 2005, 
corruption among parliamentarians and ministers has grown;

weaknesses, at least on paper the r u l e s fo r accountability o f the public o f f ic ia ls provide a basis 
fo r a strong reform implementation. For example, the system o f limited-duration immunities i s 
better than that in some countries, although immun i ty coverage i s excessively broad and exempts 
not only MPs and the President, but also a long l i s t o f prosecutors, judges, and public officials. 

6. Progress has also been made in public procurement re fo rm in moving towards 
alignment w i th the EU aquis. In past years, the share o f the sole source contracting was 
reduced f rom 16 percen t ( o f total value) in 2004 to 7 .2 percen t in 2006 according to the statistics 
o f the Procurement Agency. A new procurement law came in e f f e c t in October 2007. A Public 
Procurement Agency, wh ich reports t o the Prime Minister, has been created out o f cen t ra l 
purchasing body o f the M in is t ry o f Economy. 

7 . Moldova i s a pa r ty o f the international regimes combating illegal cross-border 
activities, A M L - C F T and anti-trafficking. In July 2007 , the governme;lnt adopted a law on 
Prevention and Fight o f Money Laundering and Financing o f Terrorism 
w i t h CCECC being . 
responsible for the coordination and implementation o f the law. Du r ing 2007 -09 , the National 
Committee on An t i -T ra f f ick ing adopted a new action plans fo r f igh t ing drug trafficking. 
Furthermore Mo ldova has ra t i f ied the 2008 European Convention fo r Combating Human 
Trafficking, and in 2007 , adopted a N ew Guard Law . Finally, in 2008, the Parliament adopted a 
law on international legal assistance in penal matters. 

8 . Given the limited resou rces and capacity o f Moldova’s civil society, i t s impact on 
holding the government o r private interests to account i s quite weak. Although the c i v i l 
society in Mo ldova i s active and diverse in meeting identified social needs and rep resen ts a wide 
array o f c iv ic values ( f rom good governance, social stability, consumer protection, gender and 
minorities, poverty and social protection, environmental standards, and other public in te res ts ) 
almost h a l f o f the NGOs operate in the social sector. The ma jo r i ty o f Mo ldovan NGOs i s 
financially struggling. Desp i te the recognized role o f NGOs in imp rov ing government 
effectiveness and responsiveness in many countries, only 28%25 o f the Mo ldovan public pe rce ive 
NGOs favorably. Donor financed projects remain the ma in source for NGOs funding. NGOs’ 
capacity for monitoring o f specialized or complex reforms i s perceived as l o w also due t o the 
s k i l l s and expertise gaps in conducting advocacy campaigns and engaging the Government 
effectively. 

World Bank’s Governance and Institutional Reform Effort to Date 
9 . The 2004 CAS placed strong attention to governance and anti-corruption and addressed 
public sector governance as one o f the th ree pillars aligned with the government program 
objectives o f the EGPRSP. A considerable po r t fo l io o f lending and analytical se rv ices26 aimed to 
implement the two governance and institutional reform objectives o f the CAS: strengthen the 
capacity o f the public sector to develop and implement public policies; increase the transparency 
and accountability o f P F M and improve public perceptions o f governance. The ma in lending 
interventions and technical assistance targeted P F M reform, c i v i l service reform, reforming 
courts and the engaging c i v i l society in growth and poverty-reduction decisions.

should proceed on a case by case basis, and only i f residual risks after m i t iga t ion are deemed 
acceptable. The present strategy believes, however, that by mov ing in this direction, the 
governance agenda can benefit f rom additional country leadership and ultimately contribute to 
greater development effectiveness. M i t iga t ing fiduciary risks b y imp rov ing fiduciary controls 
and assisting Mo ldova with strengthening the capacity o f the government procurement system, 
as well as f ind ing an optimal P M U implementation model w i l l be one o f the ma in fiduciary 
priorities over the next CPS cycle. 

15. Finding the right im p l em e n t a t i o n m o d e l faces cons ide rab le t rade -o f fs b e tw e e n risks to 
the p r o j e c t and capac i ty and k n ow l e d g e t rans fe r . Mos t investment projects are implemented 
b y traditional project implementation units (PMU) and recent efforts have been made to better 
integrate project implementation with the agents responsible for the overall project execution. 
There are th ree distinct models (Box 1) that apply to investment lending implementation in 
Moldova. However, experience shows that none o f these models can f u l l y protect the project 
f rom manipulation o f b id outcomes or contract awards. Therefore, as part o f the transition 
arrangements for mainstreaming PMUs, a readiness assessment needs to be conducted to iden t i fy 
and address criteria, gaps and a timetable fo r transition towards greater use o f country systems.

needed . Country level due diligence needs to include the management o f state-owned 
en terpr ises , strategic investment pianning, 
and capital budgeting. Increasingly, the 
Bank has been using e lemen ts o f country 
systems and existing 
institutions, 
thus 
reducing the transaction costs in Bank 
investment projects. Further increase in 
the use o f these e lemen ts (including the 
use o f the Treasury, the Court o f Accounts 
for audit and national procurement ru les ) 
wou ld r e s u l t s in the gradual substitutions 
o f the Bank requirements w i t h the full use 
o f country systems and, while this wou ld 
not be feasible w i t h i n the l i f e t im e o f this 
CPS, i t i s expected that steps towards 
readiness wou ld be achieved. 

(i) Comp le te “r ing- fenc ing ,” which means fiduciary 
consultants are not integrated with the implementing 
institution; this model presents the highest resistance to 
undesirable pressures 
from 
the beneficiaries and 
implementing agencies but engenders the lowest degree 
of ownership by the Borrower; 
(ii) 
“Legal agent’’ 
is the extreme version of “ring- 
fencing” in which all powers and authorizations are 
handed over to the PMUs, which are established as legal 
entities solely to implement the projects. The downside is 
total dependence on the integrity of the PMU staff, and a 
complete lack of knowledge and capacity transfer to the 
government agency. 
(iii) “Ou t-sourced f iduc iary func t ion ” is a hybrid model 
in which beneficiaries are in charge of implementation 
and assign staff as project coordinators, and the 
downside is similar to the legal agent model described 
above. 
(iv) “Fully in tegra ted coun t ry sys tems” is a model in 
which the implementation management responsibility is 
with the ministries and the beneficiaries using the flow of 
funds through the treasury system. The most obvious 
downside is the existing procurement risk due to weak 
government capacity.

approach. Although the Government i s

efforts are limited b y the country’s in te rna l po l i t ica l dynamics. Furthermore, earlier Bank e f fo r ts

limited engagement with c i v i l society and p r iva te stakeholders t o generate demand f o r better

Moldova in developing sustainable rule-based governance, which w i l l support the p ro -EU

inc rease this

development and anti-corruption governance reforms (see Table 2). In M a y 2006, the 
Government and key donors signed A Development Partnership Framework to implement the 
2005 Pa r is Declaration on A i d Effectiveness and Harmonization. Thus, the Government

27. The Bank will regard partnerships and donor coordination for governance results as 
another delivery instrument. The Bank needs to: (i) continue to be a lead donor convening key 
stakeholders and mob i l iz ing donors’ resources to address national priorities; (ii) lead in selected 
governance areas where i t has already established programs and dialogue. In areas where other 
donors and partners have proven advantage or implement sizable programs, the Bank w i l l hand- 
over the lead donor role, offering i t s convening role as needed and remaining a provider o f 
analytical support. Areas where the Bank can rely on the lead role o f other donors are: jud ic ia l 
reforms (USA ID /MCC ; UNDP; EC); customs, security, police; 
law enforcement (EC; 
USA ID /MCC ) ; border control, customs, combating corruption and anti-trafficking (CoE, 
U S AID); regional development and empowering c iv ic and local communities (DFID; UNDP ; 
EC, USAID). 

28. Over the implementation period o f this CPS, the Bank will widen its outreach to a 
broader audience o f public and private sector entities, sub-national government, judiciary, 
and c i v i l society to ass is t w i t h anti-corruption campaigns or to support c iv ic group initiatives for 
increased public disclosure o f in fo rma t ion and transparency for reducing the opportunities for 
corrupt practices and fraud. Also, the Bank w i l l need to take a more strategic approach to 
communication, integrating on demand po l i t ica l economy mapping and analysis o f key 
stakeholders’ positions fo r coalition bu i ld ing over the en t i re project cycle. The Bank w i l l also 
increase the transparency o f i t s transactions b y making more information on i t s project activities

the FY07 C A S Progress Report. To identify lessons that a re re levan t f o r the design and

11. MOLDOVA’S 
LONGER TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

2. 
The C A S under r e v i ew f o r this repo r t was developed t o support the objectives o f 
Mo ldova ’s Econom ic G r ow t h and Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (EGPRSP), establishing the 
Bank’s lend ing and non - lend ing support fo r M o l d o v a f r o m FY05 th rough FY08 . The EGPRSP, 
adopted in M a y 2004, was the f i rs t full Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper prepared by the 
government o f M o l d o v a (G oM ) in consu l ta t ion with broad-based stakeholders and c i v i l society. 
This document contained a diagnostic assessment o f pove r ty in M o l d o v a and a v i s i o n f o r 
sustainable and comprehensive pove r ty reduc t ion during the 2004-2006 pe r iod . In 2006, the 
EGPRSP was extended through 2007. 

Overview of the EGPRSP 

3 . 

The EGPRSP identified three pillars to address the country’s main obstacles to 

57 

. . 

longer-term development: sustainable economic growth, human development, and soc ia l 
protection. Using this framework, the government’s strategy ou t l ined a long - te rm v i s i o n f o r the 
development o f Mo ldova , established p r io r i t ies f o r addressing the current obstacles t o 
sustainable g r ow t h and pove r ty reduction, and identified the med ium - te rm objectives that should 
be achieved within the 2004-2006 pe r iod . These objectives were the m a i n focus o f the EGPRSP 
and served as the d r ive rs f o r the prescribed actions and indicators: 
Sustainable and inc lus ive economic g r ow t h 
. H um a n resources development 
Pove r ty and inequa l i ty reduction, and increased pa r t ic ipa t ion o f the poo r in economic 
development 
4. 
Both the medium- and long-term priorities identified by the EGPRSP were 
explicitly linked with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were adapted 
“to the M o l d o v a n reality,” with target ind ica to rs established t o define successful progress by 
2006, 2010, and 2015.34 The strategy therefore ind ica ted b road p r io r i t ies f o r development and 
i d e n t i f i e d spec i f ic targets in some key areas through w h i c h t o gauge success. 

CAS Context and Alignment to Moldova’s Longer Term Strategic Goals 

5. 
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy was presented to the Executive Board 
against the backdrop of a difficult policy environment, and the alignment of the FY05 CAS 
to the strategic goals set forth in the EGPRSP i s best understood by considering the 
country context. Mo ldova ’s t rans i t ion t o a market economy has been challenging, with high 
vu lne rab i l i ty t o external shocks, a vo la t i le in te rna l p o l i t i c a l environment, and m i x e d r e f o rm 
imp lemen ta t ion . Both the IMF (PRGF) and the World Bank Structural Adjustment C red i t I11 
p rog rams had recen t ly been suspended with less than one - th i rd o f the comm i t ted funds under 
these programs being disbursed. In addition, the po l ic ies and actions proposed in the EGPRSP 
re f lec ted a s ign i f ican t departure f r o m Mo ldova ’s 200 1 Econom ic R e v i v a l Program. These 
circumstances raised concern about the G o M ’ s comm i tmen t t o the r e f o rm p rog ram a r t icu la ted in 
the EGPRSP. 

6. 
The CAS prescribed a cautious approach and mainly supported interventions at the 
l o c a l community leve l in areas with the highest concentration of poverty-including rural 
areas and small cities. By design, these targeted in te rven t ions were intended to address the 
needs in one o r mo re o f the three interrelated p i l la rs f o r development defined by the C A S : 

rn P romo t ing compe t i t ive ma rke t environment, stability, and p ro -poo r growth 
rn M i n i m i z i n g social and env i ronmen ta l r isks , building human capital, and p r om o t i n g social 
. Comba t ing co r rup t ion and improving p u b l i c sector governance

These pillars organized the p r io r i t ies d i f fe ren t ly than the m a i n themes f o r development iden t i f ied 
in the EGPRSP, but t h i s approach was designed p rec ise ly to ensure better that Mo ldova ’s 
medium-term development objectives c o u l d be achieved. 

7. 
Each of the CAS pillars was designated strategically to further the goals set forth in 
the EGPRSP. The first C A S p i l l a r supported the G oM ’ s e f fo r t t o e l im ina te the bottlenecks to 
g r ow t h by attaching a high p r i o r i t y t o im p r o v i n g the business environment and investment 
climate. The second p i l l a r p romo ted human development and ca l led for selected interventions to 
focus d i rec t ly o n helping M o l d o v a achieve i t s MDGs, i n c l u d i n g e f fo r ts t o imp rove the quality 
and access o f social services 
fo r education, health, social protection, and commun i ty 
infrastructure. The third C A S p i l l a r hono red the ob jec t ive o f the EGPRSP t o “establish a 
modern, e f f ic ien t p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion system, w h i c h w i l l strengthen democratic processes and 
the ma rke t economy.” This impe ra t ive f o r good governance was perhaps bes t summed up in the 
Coun t ry Econom ic Memo randum (CEM ) w h i c h was comp le ted the f o l l ow i n g year: “Good 
governance i s fundamental f o r economic g row th . An e f fec t ive state must ensure an attractive 
and stable investment c l ima te and allocate scarce resources e f f i c i e n t l y and equ i tab ly . Fa i lu re t o 
de l ive r s e r v i c e s in an e f f ic ien t and transparent manner increases the risk o f co r rup t ion and 
reduces the c r e d i b i l i t y o f p u b l i c p o l i c y in the eyes o f citizens and investors alike.” 

Moldova’s Progress Towards Achieving Development Goals 

8 . 

The country context has changed dramatically during the CAS period, and the new 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) will be developed under much different circumstances 
than this CAS was. At the s t a r t in FY05, the Bank ’s coun t ry p o r t f o l i o f o l l ow e d a Base Case 
lending scenario that p r o v i d e d o n l y investment operations. Howeve r , the C A S also contained a 
series o f key r e f o rm benchmarks that w o u l d p rov ide the basis f o r eva lua t ing r e f o rm in c r i t ica l 
areas. These benchmarks p r o v i d e d triggers f o r a High Case lend ing scenario t o leave open the 
poss ib i l i ty f o r resuming p o l i c y based lending. At the t im e o f the C A S Progress Report, the G o M 
had accomplished o r substantially accomplished mos t o f the r e f o rm benchmarks that were 
established as High Case triggers-allowin 
fo r a Pove r ty Reduc t ion Support C red i t (PRSC) 
p rog ram t o be imp lemen ted starting in F Y 0 7 . 8 5 

9 . 
The Annual Evaluation Report (AER) prepared by the GoM (2006), the CAS 
Progress Report, the PRSC program documents, and project ICRs all provide evidence o f 
notable progress towards Moldova’s longer term development goals. M o l d o v a has increased 
the s tab i l i ty o f i t s macroeconomic f ramewo rk -w i th generally s t rong g row th , reduced poverty, 
and s ign i f ican t reductions in debt. The G o M has also improved the management o f p u b l i c 
finances, launched a s ign i f ican t r e f o rm p rog ram f o r p u b l i c administration, and imp roved i t s 
partnerships with the in te rna t iona l donor commun i ty t o increase the f l o w o f a id . 

10. 
However, progress has been mixed fo r a c o r e set o f indicators linked to the MDGs. 
While the AER identified m o r e than 150 indicators th rough w h i c h t o m o n i t o r EGPRSP progress, 
the Jo in t S t a f f Advisory N o t e t o the EGPRSP h igh l igh ted selected ind ica to rs t i e d t o the MDGs 

3 5 Moldova’s CAS was one o f the last to contain explicit lending scenarios. The IDA14 resource allocation process 
s p e c i f i e s that country allocations are determined annually through I D A ’ S performance-based allocation system, 
which superseded the CAS indicative lending scenarios. The implications o f the transition away from CAS lending 
scenarios for Mo ldova i s explored in the section on Bank performance (Section IV) .

that the strategy's med ium - te rm objectives a imed t o achieve. These ind ica to rs are shown in 
Tab le 1. M o l d o v a did experience strong economic growth, exceeding the target f o r GDP g r ow t h 
until 2006 when external shocks slowed the economy (discussed more in the next section o n 
C A S outcomes). A lso , w h i l e pove r ty was reduced overall, a t r o u b l i n g trend emerged after 2003, 
with pove r ty in the r u r a l areas increasing between 2004 and 2005. Progress within the hea l th 
sector has inc luded decreases in the under-5 and ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y rates w h i c h have exceeded 
the targets. A l t h o u g h the incidence o f HIV-AIDS remains w e l l above the target l e v e l f o r 2006, 
the increase in n ew cases diagnosed reflects imp rovemen ts in detection, with increased testing 
identifying p rev ious ly undiagnosed infections. Educa t ion r e f o rm has advanced mo re s l ow l y than

Overall, a r e v i ew o f a l l EGPRSP ind ica to rs and other evidence o f progress i d e n t i f i e d 
some k e y i s s u e s that pose rema in ing challenges f o r the new CPS: 
. Vulnerability to external shocks: M o l d o v a n exports rema in concentrated in a few commod i t ies 
and are susceptible t o weather hazards (2007 drought) and embargos (2006 ban on wine by 
. Poverty in the r u r a l areas: R u r a l households are inc reas ing ly impove r ished due t o the lack o f 
Russia). The coun t ry also imports nea r ly a l l o f i t s energy and i s vu lne rab le t o in te rna t iona l 
p r i c e f luc tua t ions . These factors have a l l dampened economic g row th . 
access t o p u b l i c se rv ices , the recen t drought, and ma rke t d is to r t ions that have reduced fa rm -

. The need for increased fo re ign and domestic investment: The GoM has a m i x e d t rack reco rd 
f o r economic and structural reforms. An imp roved business env i ronmen t and enhanced

13. 
The fo l low ing paragraphs provide a narrative explanation o f CAS achievements under 
each pillar, their contribution to longer-term development goals, and the steps that a re planned to 
address shortcomings. Various examples illustrate how the m i x o f lending and advisory se rv ices 
have allowed Bank staff to wo rk effectively w i t h client counterparts and other donors to bu i ld 
country systems and achieve resu l ts . Other examples h igh l igh t areas where r e s u l t s have not yet 
been achieved, often fo r multiple reasons. The G o M does not always speak with one voice, so 
an in i t ia t ive could be championed b y one ministry or o f f ic ia l and then impeded b y another. The 
capacity o f country systems or l i n e ministries i s s t i l l limited for implementing projects in some 
cases. 
Implications stemming f rom the turnover o f Bank t e a m leaders and bureaucratic 
processes must be reviewed to avoid any disruptions to the dialogue between the Bank and the 
GoM . Finally, the establishment o f a new strategy or a new law-the ma in focus o f the PRSC 
program-is a potentially c r i t ica l step for sustainable change, but such accomplishments have 
often not yet yielded r e s u l t s during the CAS period. Rather than exploring the resu l ts o f every 
activity pursued under this CAS, this section focuses on each main country outcome and 
explores the degree to wh ich IDA assistance yielded r e s u l t s linked to this outcome. A l i s t o f 
CAS resu l ts i s presented in the appendix along with the planned lending activities and advisory 
se rv ices and the actual deliveries. 

Pillar I: Competitive Market Environment, Stability, and Pro-poor Growth 
14. 
Du r ing the preparation o f this CAS, the consultations w i t h the business community, the 
Trade Diagnostic Study, and the Investment Climate Assessmen t a l l indicated that the h i g h cost 
o f doing bus iness constrained private sector development and j o b creation. The first CAS pillar 
called fo r a broad, crosscutting approach to improve the infrastructure for investment and 
economic activity, simplify bureaucratic controls and licensing procedures, streamline 
enforcement, improve corporate governance, and support the development o f the ru ra l economy 
where most o f the poor l ive . The resulting m i x o f interventions supported b y IDA to further the 
country outcomes l inked to this p i l la r i s shown in Table 3 . 

Outcome I. 1 : S tab le Macroeconomic Framework 
15. 
T h e mac roeconom ic f r a m e w o r k c u r r e n t l y in p lace i s sa t is fac to ry . The G o M has 
maintained a prudent f i s c a l stance during the CAS period, with fiscal su rp luses in 2003-2006 and 
a l im i ted budget deficit target o f 0.5 percen t in 2008. IDA support has played an important role 
b y p rov id ing advisory services and assisting w i t h the establishment o f a credible strategy fo r 
dealing w i t h arrears on external debt (the M a y 2006 agreement w i t h Paris Club creditors). This 
ab i l i ty to reschedule debt has alleviated short-term l iqu id i ty difficulties and provided access to 
resources for addressing development needs. 

16. Mo ldova experienced strong economic growth f rom 2001 through 2005, w i t h rea l GDP 
g row th averaging 7.1 percent. However, since 2006, natural gas p r ices have more than doubled, 
imports o f Mo ldovan wine were banned by Russia, and the Mo ldova agricultural sector was hit 
b y a severe drought. The growth o f real GDP slowed in 2006 to 4.8 percent and with the impact 
o f the drought, growth slowed further in 2007 to 4.0 pe rcen t . Given the severity o f these shocks, 
the economy has proved to be quite r e s i l i e n t and growth i s expected to rebound sharply in 2008- 
2009. 

17. 
Although the country’s economic performance has been positive under this CAS, this 
report highlights factors that could slow g row th and poverty reduction and impede or erode 

62 

in te rna t iona l competitiveness. 
I t must be no ted therefore that any r e v i ew o f the current 
macroeconomic f ramewo rk shou ld inc lude an assessment o f the other outcomes desired under

Outcome 1.2: Reduced N P V o f Public and P u b l i c l y Guaranteed D e b t 

18 . Moldova’s debt outlook i s favorable, w i th a low risk o f debt distress. Ex te rna l pub l ic 
and p u b l i c l y guaranteed (PPG) debt, exc lud ing debt o f state-owned enterprises, has sharply 
decreased under this CAS , f r o m a baseline o f 53 percen t o f GD P in 2003 to an estimated 20 
percent at the end o f 2007. This l e v e l o f PPG debt places M o l d o v a well b e l ow the debt distress 
threshold o f 40 percent (ne t presen t va lue o f GDP ) f o r countries with M o l d o v a ’ s Coun t ry 
Performance Ind ica to r Assessment (CP IA ) ove ra l l score. 

19. 
The r a p i d decline o f P PG debt has been supported by the prudent f isca l po l icy , strong 
economic growth, and favo rab le debt rescheduling operations noted above under outcome I. 1. In 

63 

addition, the G o M has ma in ta ined po l ic ies that did n o t a l l ow the debt s i tua t ion t o deteriorate 
despite severe external shocks. Comm i tmen ts by the Consu l ta t ive G roup and the Millennium 
Challenge Co rpo ra t ion have demonstrated imp roved prospects f o r dono r assistance w h i c h have, 
in turn, bolstered debt sustainability. 
In short, progress reduc ing PPG debt has created the 
oppo r tun i ty f o r add i t iona l b o r r ow i n g f o r in f ras t ruc tu re and other high p r i o r i t y development 
projects. 

20. W h i l e the PPG debt reduc t ion achieved under this C A S i s notable, th is success shou ld be 
considered within the con tex t o f con t inu ing risks. In particular, any in te r rup t ion o f remittance 
i n f l ow s c o u l d a f fec t the sustainability o f debt given the ongo ing reliance o f the economy o n 
wo rke rs l i v i n g abroad. This dynam ic underscores the impo r tance o f im p r o v i n g the investment 
c l ima te to enhance domestic sources o f g row th .

Ou tcome 1.3: I n f l a t i o n in Single Digits 
21. 
High inflation remains a concern in Moldova, and a renewed effort i s needed to 
reduce inflation below 10 percent. A l t h o u g h the target f o r i n f l a t i o n con t ro l was n o t achieved 
during this C A S period, IDA assistance e f fec t ive ly supported the G o M in rema in ing current o n 
budgetary ob l iga t ions . The s ign i f ican t increase in energy p r ices since m id -2005 and the impac t 
o f the d rough t o n domestic f o o d prices have impeded t h e e f fo r ts o f the N a t i o n a l Bank o f 
M o l d o v a t o reduce in f la t ion . The C P I increased 12 percent in 2007, above the 10 percent target 
established in this C A S . In the current context, d is in f la t ion w i l l requ i re ongo ing tight monetary 
p o l i c y and a mo re r a p i d increase in domestic p roduc t iv i ty . 

Ou tcome 1.4: F inanc ia l ly and Soc ia l ly V iab le Pension System 
22. 
Significant progress has been achieved towards reforming the pension system, but 
more work remains to be done. Th rough the support p rov ided by the Social P ro tec t ion 
Management P ro jec t and the Pension P o l i c y Dialogue, the general pens ion l a w (1999) t o r e f o rm 
the pay-as-you-go pens ion system has met the short-term ob jec t ives o f m a k i n g pension payments 
o n time, in -cash (as opposed t o in-kind), and w i t h o u t the need f o r budget transfers. The system 
has 
increased 
transparency-with 
in te rna t iona l accoun t ing standards 
in t roduced and 
imp lemen ted and regu la r f inanc ia l audits conducted (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006). 
The N a t i o n a l Soc ia l Insurance House has also made progress establishing and popu la t ing a 
database with i n d i v i d u a l records t o a l l ow f o r the ca lcu la t ion o f pensions based o n i n d i v i d u a l 
con t r ibu t ions . 

23. 
Despite these advances, pens ion bene f i ts in M o l d o v a are not yet based r e l i a b l y o n actual 
con t r ibu t ions paid. In some cases, G o M laws or po l ic ies have impeded Mo ldova ’s success in 
r e f o rm i n g the pens ion system. 
F o r example, employers have the respons ib i l i ty t o pay 
con t r ibu t ions o n b e h a l f o f the employee, but the recent law o n con t r ibu t ion amnesty created 
incentives f o r emp loye rs n o t t o comp ly . The G o M has also n o t yet successfully e l im ina ted 
pens ion p r iv i leges , but the Ministry o f Soc ia l Protection, F am i l y and C h i l d has d ra f ted a 

un i f ica t ion strategy for a l l categories o f contributors/pensioners.

risk t o the development outcome as substantial f o r the Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Management Project 
(closed Ma rch 3 1 , 2007). Key considerations in this assessment were the con t r ibu t ion amnesty 
law, the long - te rm f inanc ia l sustainability o f the pens ion system, and the limited capacity o f the 
ministry for p o l i c y analysis and m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o n social p ro tec t ion i s s u e s . A ma jo r

The investment climate has improved during this CAS period, but notable risks and

Comprehensive review o f a l l no rma t ive acts (by-laws) was conducted (the so-called G u i l l o t i n e I

40. 
A unified national rea l estate cadastre system fo r u rban and r u r a l land has been 
established, and the credit and technical assistance provided to private farmers has 
exceeded CAS targets. The security o f tenure and ownership rights in Mo ldova has increased, 
w i t h 75% o f rural property in private hands having been f u l l y registered. The average income in 
the bus inesses in the areas covered b y the f i r s t Ru ra l Investment and Services Project (RISP-1) 
increased b y 23 percen t over the project period, and 194 new bus inesses were created in r u r a l 
areas under RISP-2 during 2006-2007. 

41. 
Although these project interventions have had promising resu l ts , the Bank has not yet 
developed a strategy fo r more comprehensively dealing with the various bottlenecks in the 
agricultural sector. Agriculture has underperformed overall economic growth, and this trend has 
contributed to increasing poverty in the rural areas since 2003 (see outcome 11.1 below). Public 
se rv ices and investment in the sector remain inadequate, including measures to reduce 
vulnerability to natural hazards. On ly limited IDA resources have focused on the agricultural 
sector and on imp rov ing access to f inance , knowledge, and technology in rural areas under this 
CAS, but the opportunity ex is ts going forward to leverage this funding in partnership w i t h other 
donors offering considerable funding (particularly S IDA and MCC ) to achieve the desired 
outcomes.

I D A assistance has facilitated and supported continuous improvements to the 
annual Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and increased competition in 
public procurement. The B a n k has aided M o l d o v a in strengthening i t s resource a l loca t ion 
processes th rough the MTEF and expanding the sectors inc luded t o respond t o the EGPRSP. An 
in te rna l f inanc ia l con t ro l and aud i t system based o n European U n i o n standards has been 
developed. The G o M has established a central p o l i c y unit t o a l l ow f o r p o l i t i c a l consensus o n

Ongo ing ac t iv i t ies started under this C A S are expected t o con t r ibu te further t o this 
outcome. F o r example, the PRSC p rog ram i s p r om o t i n g imp rovemen t in p u b l i c inves tmen t

sources o f p u b l i c investment a re integrated i n t o a single c omm o n p u b l i c inves tmen t p rog ram

In te rna t iona l measures ind ica te that the p u b l i c pe rcep t ion o f co r rup t ion in M o l d o v a has

IV . BANK PERFORMANCE 

Quality of Products and Services 
(Energy-2) h a d a satisfactory ra t ing . ’‘ O u t o f s ix projects that closed during the C A S period, 
57. 
I D A performance during the CAS period has been satisfactory. IEG and Q A G 
evaluations and other in te rna l measures o f qua l i ty ind ica te that the quality o f B a n k products and 
services in M o l d o v a has been imp rov ing , and there have been n o projects at risk since FY05. The 
o n l y p ro jec t evaluated by the Qua l i t Assurance G roup f o r Q u a l i t y at Entry in 2004-2007 
five have been rev iewed by IEG and rated as satisfactory. In addition, the recent ISRs o n active 
p ro jec ts suggest tha t a l l are o n t rack to meet their development objectives. 
The Bank’s Moldova Country Team has demonstrated a results orientation f o r 
maintaining and improving the quality o f products and services, continually working to 
strengthen the indicators f o r monitoring and evaluation. As no ted earlier, the team has 
recen t ly adopted the use o f the M o l d o v a C A S Resu l ts Scorecard t o assess better the con t r ibu t ion 
o f C A S ac t iv i t ies t o desired coun t ry outcomes. The 2006 Coun t ry P rog ram R e v i ew no ted that 
the qua l i ty o f the r e s u l t s f ramewo rks f o r i n d i v i d u a l projects ove ra l l has been good, with clear, 
concise, realistic, and measurable ind ica to rs tha t are consistent with projects’ development 
objectives. Add i t iona l ly , M o l d o v a rece ived the highest score f o r r e s u l t s among E C A countries 
in the 2007 ISR review conducted by the E C A Qua l i ty Group. 

5 8 . 

5 9 . 

The Bank has used analytic and advisory w o r k (AAA) effectively during the CAS 
period to complement investment projects and the PRSC. The CEM , poverty update, 
adv iso ry w o r k o n agriculture, and the business environment surveys have d i rec t ly informed the 
development o f the PRSC Program. The P u b l i c Expenditure Review (PER) in 2007 was c lose ly 
linked to p o l i c y notes in hea l th and educa t ion to a l l ow f o r a broader review and t o ensure 
adequate sector specific input. A s no ted in the section o n C A S outcomes, ana ly t ica l w o r k has 
also been mainstreamed i n t o other areas o f engagement, such as agriculture, soc ia l assistance, 
and im p r o v e d access t o hea l th and education. The coun t ry team and other stakeholders 
con t inua l ly p rov ide input t o i d e n t i f y ana ly t ic gaps and develop strategies f o r addressing them; 
f o r example, a current focus i s o n the need t o better understand the drivers f o r econom ic g r ow t h 
and h o w these relate t o poverty reduction-particularly 
f o r r u r a l popu la t ions . 

60. 
The PRSC was developed with strategic links to the investment program and in 
close coordination with other donors. 
Inves tmen t operations p r o v i d e s ign i f ican t techn ica l 
assistance t o enable the imp lemen ta t ion o f po l icy re fo rms supported by the PRSC program. A 
number o f other donor programs are a l igned behind the PRSC: f o r PRSC1, the limited IDA 
resources ($10 m i l l i o n ) leveraged nea r ly $7 m i l l i o n f r o m other donors. PRSC2 w i l l also have 
substantial donor f inanc ing . 

61. 
Plans fo r implementing products and services have been adjusted to strengthen 
results based on portfolio experiences, GoM initiatives, and opportunities f o r leveraging 

3 7 Quality measured through QAG includes quality at entry, quality o f supervision and quality o f ESW 
assessments (the latter two types o f assessments were not completed for Mo ldova projects during the CAS 
period). Other internal measures include I EG reviews o f projects, 
ISRs, the internal review o f resu l ts 
frameworks as part o f the 2006 Country Por t fo l io Review, and a review o f the I S R s conducted by ECA 
Quality Group in 2007.

resources provided by other donors. A road sector project was added in FY07 to provide 
much needed financing for infrastructure. Concerns that emerged from the AER promoted more 
focus on the limited effectiveness o f public expenditure, the uneven poverty reduction, and 
public sector governance. Harmonization between the EGPRSP and the EU -Mo ldova Ac t ion 
Plan (EMAP) and the growing support o f donors for wo rk ing w i th in this framework have created 
opportunities fo r coordination in such areas as AIDS treatment and prevention and social 
assistance p i lo ts among others. 

62. 
The IDA - IM F partnership in Moldova’s development strategy has been excellent 
over the past few years. Bank and IMF staffs have executed j o i n t wo rk and have continued to 
c a r r y out j o i n t missions at least twice a year for macroeconomic po l icy dialogue w i t h the 
Government. The IMF po l icy dialogue w i t h the G oM t a k e s place in the context o f the ongoing 
Poverty Reduction and G row th Facility, covering the 2006-2008 period. The PRSC was 
prepared in conjunction w i t h the PRGF to ensure the consistency o f the macroeconomic and 
structural po l icy reforms supported b y bo th programs. The IMF i s taking the lead on 
macroeconomic issues while IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues . In a number o f 
areas where the mandates o f the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work i s 
being closely coordinated to ensure that consistent advice i s provided to the authorities. The 
existence o f an I M F program i s an important input for the determination o f the adequacy o f the 
macroeconomic po l icy framework fo r the PRSC. 

63. 
Continued efforts a re needed to deepen collaboration within the World Bank 
Group. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has remained active in Moldova, 
supporting power, telecommunications, agribusiness, small and medium en terpr ises , and local 
banks. Bu i ld ing on IDA ’S efforts in the health and infrastructure sectors, IFC w i l l collaborate 
and complement IDA ’S wo rk w i t h public private partnership initiatives. In addition, the 
Mu l t i la te ra l Investment Guarantee Agency (M IGA ) i s active in Moldova, covering part o f a 
large-scale power sector privatization effort that has been supported by IFC . M I G A i s open to 
opportunities to support foreign direct investment in Mo ldova through the provision o f po l i t ica l 
risk guarantees and w i l l coordinate i t s involvement w i t h IDA. 

Portfolio Assessment 
64. 
Portfolio quality has been steadily improving over the CAS period. As shown in 
Table 6, the percentage o f commitments at risk has been reduced f r om 23.5 in 2004 to 0 s ince 
2005. The disbursement ratio has been relatively high, averaging 22 pe rcen t despite the young 
po r t fo l io age (currently, the average project age i s 2.4 years).

The portfolio i s dominated by projects in the 
infrastructure and human 
development sectors. A s o f December 2008, IDA lending operations inc lude a PRSC p rog ram 
and 10 inves tmen t operations (with an add i t iona l 3 GEF projects), f o r a to ta l comm i tmen t o f 
US$159.3 m i l l i o n , o f w h i c h US$100.4 m i l l i o n (63%) remains t o be disbursed. A l l IDA and GEF 
operations cu r ren t ly under imp lemen ta t ion a re p roceed ing we l l , with none in p rob lem status o r at 
risk. 

66. 
Investment loans foreseen in the CAS f o r FY05 (under IDA13), FY06, FY07, and 
FYO8 were approved as planned. They inc luded 6 investment operations in support o f p u b l i c 
f inanc ia l management, competitiveness, education in r u r a l areas, r u r a l investment serv ices , 
hea l th care and social assistance, road sector support, and supplemental f inanc ing f o r the 
Cadastre p ro jec t . Additional operations were also approved, i n c l u d i n g a p ro jec t t o he lp M o l d o v a 
combat the threat o f av ian in f luenza in F Y 0 6 and a N a t i o n a l Wa te r F a c i l i t y in FY 0 8 . M o l d o v a 
used a l l o f i t s IDA a l loca t ion during the C A S pe r iod . 

67. 
However, the volume o f loans delivered and the focus o f lending and non-lending 
activities were different at times than what was originally envisaged in the CAS. The 
d i f fe rence be tween p lanned lend ing and actual deliveries i s exp la ined by Mo ldova 's successful 
progress meeting High Case triggers and adjustments in the Bank 's p rog ram in response t o 
chang ing coun t ry circumstances. These mod i f ica t ions were made t o ensure coherence with the 
PRSC program, p r o v i d e flexible f inanc ing in response t o the new government 's priorities in 
in f ras t ruc tu re (roads) and t o adhere t o the n ew performance-based allocations (PBA ) IDA 
envelope. The full l i s t o f p lanned versus actual lending and non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies i s in the 
appendix (Tables 2 and 3). 

68. 
The transition away from CAS lending scenarios to the PBA approach presented 
difficulties both f o r reaching a shared understanding with the GoM and f o r planning 
lending operations to stay on track. M o l d o v a qua l i f ied f o r the High Case lending scenario but 
no longer h a d access t o this l e v e l o f support under the PBA system. Imp rovemen ts in p o r t f o l i o 
performance and in Coun t ry P o l i c y and Institutional Assessment (CP IA ) ratings in F Y 0 6 led to 
an increase in the a l loca t ion f o r F Y 0 7 and FY08 , but this amount was s t i l l below the o r i g i n a l l y 
foreseen High Case l e v e l . This t rans i t ion appears to be a m a j o r reason why the p rog ram has been 

7 7 

implemented w i t h delays-about 
behind their original timelines. 

h a l f o f the activities have slipped at least one fiscal year 

69. 
The portfolio has included a high number o f projects relative to the size o f the I D A 
allocation, and the associated cost o f supervision has limited the resources available f o r 
ESW and TA . The resu l ts scorecard exercise included a review o f operational efficiency and 
effectiveness and identified that the cost o f supervision for the Mo ldova po r t fo l io was 
substantially higher than for other EC A countries on average. For example, supervision for 
activities in Mo ldova required 52 percen t o f the total country se rv ices in FY07, compared to 3 5 
percent for E C A countries on average. Du r ing the same time period, 10 percen t o f country 
services in Mo ldova supported ESW and on ly 6 percent supported TA, compared to 20 percent 
and 12 percent fo r EC A overall. 

Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination 
70. 
The Bank has strengthened its relationship with the GoM during the CAS period. 
Government authorities have demonstrated their commitment 
to economic re fo rm b y 
implementing the changes called for under the High Case lending scenario, adopting EU- 
Mo ldova Ac t ion Plan (2005), and wo rk ing to build country systems. Among others, such 
systems have included a public debt management function, basic information systems fo r budget 
execution, and a national Court o f Accounts to act as the supreme financial control institution in 
the country. Although government authorities have not always shared a unified v iew regarding 
the means to a spec i f ic development objective, Bank staff have succeeded in fostering effective 
dialogue w i t h c l i e n t counterparts to achieve resu l ts . 

71, 
The development o f the upcoming CPS w i l l rely on a consultative process. The 
country team regularly reaches out to stakeholders to in fo rm them o f lending and advisory 
activities and to receive their input. For example, the Wo r ld Bank Mo ldova Country O f f ice has 
recently hosted roundtable discussions with the media, think t a n k s , and other stakeholders on 
migration and remittances, doing bus iness , youth and energy. The GoM has recently 
implemented a h igh ly consultative process in establishing i t s Na t iona l Development Strategy, 
and the country t e a m expects to f o l l ow a similar process in developing the CPS. 

72. 
Although I D A lending and advisory services represent only a minor share o f official 
development assistance (ODA) each year, the Bank plays a pivotal r o l e in coordinating aid. 
The Bank’s leadership in convening donors was exemplified b y the Consultative Group meeting 
in B r u s s e l s in December 2006. This meeting, hosted j o i n t l y b y the Wo r ld Bank and the 
European Commission (EC), brought together the G o M and international partners to confirm 
commitment to the country’s re fo rm program and development agenda and to iden t i fy additional 
external financing in response to recen t external shocks. Currently, the Bank’s Mo ldova 
po r t fo l io includes US$ 61 m i l l i o n in. active grants from t r u s t funds. There has been particularly 
close collaboration w i t h the EC and several bilateral donors (UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands) 
in the preparation o f the PRSC. The section on CAS outcomes c i tes examples o f where Bank 
staff work w i t h other donors on ind iv idua l lending operations or analytical work. E f fo r ts to 
advance harmonization and donor coordination have resulted in several donors signing the 
Development Partnership Framework (2006), and Bank s ta f f often have the opportunity or 
responsibility to mobilize other donors’ resources to address national p r io r i t ies and to provide a 
predictable f l ow o f aid. This role fo r the Bank in Mo ldova could become increasingly important 
as the aid f rom other donors increases.

V. LESSONS LEARNED 

73. 
Targeted support plays an important r o l e in building country systems, enhancing 
ministry capacity, and enabling the development and implementation o f longer term 
policies and strategies. 
Nume rous examples have h igh l igh ted the con t r ibu t ion o f B a n k 
operations t o coun t ry development outcomes-xpediting 
customs processing, increasing the 
e f f ic iency o f energy use , increasing the qua l i ty and supp ly o f water, deve lop ing a hea l th 
insurance system, and increasing the security o f owne rsh ip rights f o r r u r a l p rope r ty t o name a 
few. Spec i f ic investment operations p rov ide valuable support t o the GoM f o r ach iev ing the 
benchmarks mandated by the PRSC program. 

74. 
Capable and committed government ministries are a critical factor in achieving 
development objectives. N a t i o n a l agencies con t r ibu te e f fec t ive ly t o the development agenda 
when they have the leadership and capacity t o design and implement the needed strategies and 
po l ic ies . This r e v i ew has h igh l igh ted cases-such 
as f o r hea l th and transport-where 
agencies 
have demonstrated owne rsh ip o f and comm i tmen t t o coun t ry development outcomes. In other 
examples, agencies must s t i l l develop the r e q u i s i t e coun t ry systems. As shown b y the 
experiences in education and pens ion re fo rm , weaker ministry capacity o r a l a c k o f clear 
owne rsh ip can impede development e f fo r ts and warrants mo re targeted in te rven t ion . 

75. 
Cross-sectoral approaches improve the effectiveness o f interventions. L inkages 
across multiple themes can h inde r development e f fo r ts that are too n a r r ow l y focused. Energy 
vu lne rab i l i ty and access to healthcare have d i rec t imp l ica t ions f o r soc ia l assistance programs. 
Water qua l i ty and organic po l lu tan ts in f luence hea l th outcomes. T h e weak ministry capacity 
impeding pens ion r e f o rm i s due in pa r t t o s ta f f turnover, an issue d i rec t ly linked t o the c i v i l 
se rv ice r e f o rm agenda. As described above, targeted in te rven t ions can serve an impo r tan t ro le in 
building needed coun t ry systems and fac i l i ta t ing longe r - te rm government ownership, but these 
operations are best p lanned se lec t ive ly as part o f a mo re comprehensive development strategy. 

76. 
Resources from the Bank can be directed strategically to leverage those of other 
donors f o r optimal development impact. H a rm o n i z i n g aid-underscored 
by the Paris 
Dec la ra t ion (2005) and the Deve lopmen t Partnership F ramewo rk (2006)-has 
been a k e y theme 
during this C A S period, and consolidated donor support has been ins t rumen ta l in furthering 
development outcomes. Resources f r o m other organizations have greatly augmented available 
IDA assistance-in health, transport, p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion re fo rm , and in the PRSC p rog ram t o 
name a few examples. The B a n k has developed e f fec t ive re la t ionsh ips with GoM counterparts 
f o r fac i l i ta t ing a cons t ruc t ive development dialogue and targeting resources where they are 
needed, and se rv ing this leadership r o l e i s c r i t ica l f o r ach iev ing coun t ry development objectives. 

77. 
The linkages between economic growth and poverty reduction are not yet 
sufficiently understood f o r Moldova. 
IDA assistance has con t r ibu ted t o a stable 
macroeconomic f ramewo rk and strong economic growth, and the economy has been r e s i l i e n t 
despite severe external shocks. However, reduc ing pove r ty has p r o v e n t o be a mo re cha l leng ing 
objective, pa r t icu la r ly f o r popu la t ions in r u r a l areas. The l a c k o f a d i rec t co r re la t ion between 
sustainable economic g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion suggests an ana ly t ic gap in the Bank ’s 
current p o r t f o l i o . 

78. 

Effective, efficient, and transparent public sector management i s becoming 

7 9 

increas ing ly impo r t an t fo r achieving development objectives. The Bank’s po r t fo l io in 
Mo ldova i s currently dominated b y projects in the infrastructure and human development 
sectors, and there has been a strategic emphasis during this CAS period on imp rov ing the 
investment climate to spur domestic productivity and foreign investment for sustainable 
economic growth. A l l o f these development initiatives re ly o n sound public sector management 
for resource allocation, strategy development, po l icy analysis, project management, and 
monitoring and evaluation. The third p i l la r o f the CAS, Combating Corruption and Imp rov ing 
Public Sector Governance, continues to gain importance with the addition o f the PRSC program, 
the mainstreaming o f project implementation units, and the exploration o f sector wide 
approaches.
