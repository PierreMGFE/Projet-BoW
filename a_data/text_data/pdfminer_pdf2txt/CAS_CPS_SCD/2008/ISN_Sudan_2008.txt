EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1 . 

The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) has provided an historic window 
of opportunity to create apeaceful andprosperous Sudan. The C P A provided f o r a 
cessation o f hos t i l i t ies between the Government o f Sudan (GoS) and the Sudan People’s 
L ibe ra t ion Movemen t / Sudan People’s L i b e r a t i o n Army (SPLM /A ) . I t also contains a 
f ramewo rk o f wealth and powe r sharing t o address t h e r o o t cause o f c o n f l i c t in Sudan- 
the country’s legacy o f inequa l i ty between center and periphery. T h e CPA ’s v is ion o f a 
Sudan that responds t o the needs o f i t s diverse people i s n o w t h e key goa l fo r the country, 
and i s shared by a broad m a j o r i t y o f actors. 

. . 11. 

While the CPA and the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA) have allowed 
peace to take hold i n the South, the transitional Three Areas, and the East, peace i n 
Darfur remains elusive. The core causes o f the c o n f l i c t in D a r f u r are c lose ly related t o 
the region’s isolation, environmental degradation, and lack o f development, pa r t icu la r ly 
in terms o f l ive l ihoods , economic and social infrastructure, governance, and human 
development outcomes. The crisis n o t only a f fec ts Darfur, but also threatens peace, 
stability, and development in a l l o f Sudan and some o f Sudan’s ne ighbo r ing countries. 

iii. 

Real economic growth estimated at 1 0 percent i n 2007 is among the highest i n 
Africa, but as an o i l-r ich economy Sudan now faces a number of new challenges i n 
economic management. While exp lo i ta t ion o f o i l resources has fac i l i ta ted an increase in 
na t iona l wealth, i t has also comp l ica ted macroeconomic management with s ign i f ican t 
pressures towa rd in te rna l and external imbalances, as well as a heightened concern fo r 
balanced g r ow t h in the n o n - o i l sectors w h i c h are key f o r sustainable g r ow t h and pove r ty 
reduc t ion efforts. Un rea l ized o i l revenue p ro jec t ions and con t inued f isca l expansion, 
i n c l u d i n g n ew spending related t o the CPA , have resu l ted in the highest f isca l de f ic i ts 
since s tab i l iza t ion (4 percent o f GD P in 2006 and an estimated 3.5 percent o f GD P in 
2007) after budget s u r p l u s e s as recen t ly as 2004. O n the ex te rna l side, the current 
account has deteriorated sharply and the rea l exchange rate has appreciated rap id ly . The 
la t te r has ra ised s ign i f ican t competitiveness concerns f o r n o n - o i l exports, o n top o f 
ex is t ing supply-side constraints t o p roduc t ion . Sudan’s external debt remains large and 
arrears constrain access t o longe r - te rm development finance. 

i v . 
New household survey data shows that poverty i n Sudan is widespread and 
deep, and the leve l of 
inequality is high. Recent g r ow t h has n o t been broad-based, and 
in fact, i t appears that inequa l i ty has risen, La rge u rban - ru ra l and reg iona l disparities, as 
re f lec ted in p u b l i c spending patterns, are c lose ly related t o con f l ic t , isolation, deprivation, 
displacement, and ch ron ic poverty. At the s am e time, the need t o address pove r ty and 
inequa l i ty t o p romo te peace and stability has been recognized by po l icymake rs , and 
comprehensive p rov is ions f o r mo re equal sharing o f resources characterize the C P A as 
well as the ESPA and the D a r f u r Peace Agreement (DPA ) . 

v. 
Sudan w i l l need to address the interrelated challenges of 
improving 
governance, increasing access to basic services, and promoting pro-poor growth to 
mitigate some of 
the main causes of conflict and ensure development progress. 

i 

Imp roved capability, responsiveness, and accoun tab i l i ty o f b o t h the Gove rnmen t o f 
Na t iona l Unity (GoNU ) and the Gove rnmen t o f Southern Sudan (GoSS) are essential fo r 
development in te rven t ions t o be e f fec t ive and responsive t o the needs o f the poo r and 
ma rg ina l ized populations. Inc reas ing p ro -poo r p u b l i c spending-historically 
l o w even 
by Sub-Saharan A f r i c a n standards-is 
c r i t ica l t o extending basic services and 
ma in ta in ing peace, especially in wa r -a f fec ted and ma rg ina l ized areas. While a mo re p ro - 
poo r a l loca t ion o f expenditures i s v i ta l , this w i l l need t o be accompanied by equitable 
economic g r ow t h t o ensu re sustained reductions in pove r ty and inequa l i ty . 

The Bank began to reengage in Sudan in the early 2000s after being largely 

v i . 
absent for about a decade. Howeve r , IDA f inanc ia l support i s s t i l l n o t possible due to 
Sudan’s outstanding arrears. Since 2005, the B a n k has administered t w o la rge Multi- 
D o n o r Trust Funds (MDTFs) that support the CPA . In addition, the Bank has p rov ided 
direct f inanc ia l assistance th rough various fac i l i t ies : the Fund f o r L ow - I n c om e Countries 
Under S t ress (L ICUS ) , t h e Pos t -Con f l ic t Fund (PCF), and a $10 m i l l i o n con t r ibu t ion t o 
the tw o MDTFs f r o m t h e IBRD’s operational surplus. MDTF -suppo r ted p ro jec ts have 
experienced ma jo r imp lemen ta t ion challenges, as have a l l development and recove ry 
programs in Sudan, but performance has steadily imp roved . S ign i f ican t r e s u l t s are be ing 
seen o n the ground, though daun t ing challenges remain-most no tab ly l o w capacity, 
especially at the state l e v e l and in t h e South. 

v i i . 

The main objective of this In te r im Strategy is to support GoNU and GoSS to 
sustain peace and help reduce conflict by meeting the commitments contained in the 
CPA, DPA , and ESPA particularly in the areas of governance, basic services, andpro- 
poor economic growth--especially in war-affected and marginalized areas. Between 

n o w and December 2009-a pe r iod r o u g h l y corresponding t o the f i r s t p o r t i o n o f the Five 
Year Strategic Plans o f G o N U and GoSS-the 
ISN i s expected t o help Sudan take 
impo r tan t s teps towa rd the achievement o f the longe r - te rm strategic v i s i o n ensh r ined in 
the CPA : p romo t ing peace in Sudan by m a k i n g i t attractive th rough development, shared 
prosperity, and a re fo rmed system o f governance w h i c h serves a l l Sudanese. 

v i i i . 

The entry points for Bank support-through management of the MDTFs and 
non-lending activities-vary according to the diverse conditions facing different 

regions of Sudan. At the Na t iona l level, a focus o n s tab i l iz ing peace entails a ma jo r ro le 
f o r ana ly t ica l w o r k and p o l i c y dialogue o n implementing key p rov is ions o f the C P A (pro- 
poo r growth, good governance and decentralization, empowerment), and-in 
Areas and the East-on pro-peace development projects and building capacity f o r 
commun i ty -d r iven development and l o c a l service delivery. In D a r f u r , the B a n k w i l l 
w o r k with partners, as security allows, t o assess development and recove ry needs and to 
make ready rehab i l i ta t ion and development programs t o be imp lemen ted in the event o f 
peace. In the South, the m a i n focus i s o n he lp ing t o build a competent, responsive and 
stable government based o n good governance, rule o f law, and transparency, while 
p romo t ing e f fo r ts t o empowe r and decentralize service delivery t o the states, counties, 
and communities. Ano the r key ob jec t ive i s to help Southern Sudan develop a long - te rm 
strategy t o t rans fo rm i t s e l f i n t o a well-integrated, s e l f re l ian t , and v iab le economic unit 
that begins t o harness i t s vast and r i c h natural resources f o r the we l fa re o f i t s people.

Substantial f inanc ia l support th rough the MDTFs as well as the Bank ’s ana ly t ica l and 
advisory services w i l l be m o b i l i z e d t o m e e t these objectives. 

IDA ’sfinancial reengagement requires clearance of Sudan’s outstanding 

i x . 
arrears. The clearance o f these arrears can o n l y be undertaken once a firm and 
comprehensive agreement among preferred creditors i s in place. Such a n agreement 
w o u l d also inc lude s ign i f ican t reductions in b i la te ra l debts, so as t o make the to ta l debt 
service ob l iga t ions sustainable. F o l l ow i n g the eventual clearance o f IDA arrears, w h i c h 
cu r ren t ly stand at $480 m i l l i o n , an exceptional IDA a l loca t ion f o r Sudan as a post- 
con f l ic t coun t ry w o u l d be sought, and the B a n k w o u l d prepare another strategy document 
w h i c h w o u l d include, inter alia, a pipeline o f projects. 

This interim strategy assumes the continuation of the status quo in the Bank’s 

x . 
operating environment. In the scenario o f a s ign i f ican t de te r io ra t ion in the operating 
environment in Sudan, the Bank w o u l d consult the Boa rd and f o l l o w the lead o f the 
MDTF donors and the in te rna t iona l commun i ty in reassessing i t s l e v e l o f support. M a j o r 
risks that cou ld resu l t in such a de te r io ra t ion inc lude : a l a c k o f reso lu t ion o r wo rsen ing o f 
the Darfur crisis, con t inued delays in imp lemen ta t ion o f the CPA, governance risks, s low 
progress in building capacity, l a c k o f ava i lab i l i ty o f fu tu re f inanc ing f o r the MDTFs, and 
lack o f ava i lab i l i ty o f Gove rnmen t counterpart funds. O n the other hand, in the scenario 
o f a s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in the environment f o r B a n k support during the time pe r iod 
covered by this strategy, the B a n k w o u l d consult with in te rna t iona l partners, GoNU , 
GoSS, and the B o a r d o n the appropriate s teps towa rd possible arrears clearance and an 
increased l e v e l o f f inanc ia l and ana ly t ica l support t o Sudan.

FOR 
THE REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The largest coun t ry in A f r i c a by land area, Sudan has r i c h na tu ra l resources, but i t s 
development has b e e n held back b y the con f l ic ts that have a f f l i c t e d the coun t ry fo r most o f 
the pe r iod since i t s independence a ha l f -cen tu ry ago. The Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement (CPA), signed o n January 9 , 2 0 0 5 by the Gove rnmen t o f Sudan (GoS) and the 
Sudan People’s L i b e r a t i o n Movemen t / Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLM /A ) , 
created a h is to r ic w i n d o w o f oppo r tun i ty f o r a peaceful and prosperous Sudan. The C P A 
no t o n l y p rov ided f o r a cessation o f hos t i l i t ies between GoS and the SP LM /A , but also 
contains a f ramewo rk o f wea l th and powe r sharing t o address the inequa l i ty between center 
and periphery that has been a r o o t cause o f c o n f l i c t in Sudan. The C P A has served as a 
beacon o f hope f o r peace in Sudan, but the con t inu ing c o n f l i c t in Darfur has also diverted 

attention and resources f r o m C P A implementation. N o t o n l y i s i t a tragedy in i t s o w n 

right, the D a r f u r c r is is also threatens peace, stability, and development in a l l o f Sudan and 
in some o f Sudan’s ne ighbo r ing countries. 

2 . 
The W o r l d B a n k was la rge ly absent f r om Sudan f o r about a decade after i t s 
disbursements were suspended in April 1993 . As pa r t o f the L o w Income Countries under 
S t ress (L ICUS ) i n i t i a t i v e in t h e ea r ly 2000s and with im p r o v i n g prospects f o r peace in 
Sudan, the Bank prepared a Coun t ry Re-engagement N o t e (CRN ) in 2003 . The C R N 
ou t l ined the Bank’s strategy and programs in support o f the conso l ida t ion o f peace and the 
pos t -con f l ic t t rans i t ion t o recove ry and development in Sudan. In 2004 -05 , the Bank and 
the United Na t ions (UN) co - led a Jo in t Assessmen t M i s s i o n ( JAM ) o f Sudan’s recovery, 
reconstruction, and development needs, cu lm ina t ing in the Os lo D o n o r Conference in 
March 2005 . Since 2 0 0 5 , the Bank has administered t w o la rge M u l t i -D o n o r Trust Funds 
(MDTFs) that support t h e CPA , and has scaled up i t s p rog ram o f ana ly t ica l and p o l i c y 
assistance. To help prepare f o r an eventual return t o peace in Da r fu r , the B a n k has 
collaborated with the A f r ican Deve lopmen t Bank and the UN in the conduct o f the Darfur 
JAM , w h i c h i s cu r ren t ly suspended o n account o f security concerns. N o r m a l IDA 

f inanc ia l support i s s t i l l n o t possible due t o Sudan’s outstanding arrears. 

3 , With the l e v e l o f Bank involvement in Sudan hav ing r i s e n s ign i f ican t ly since the 
C R N was prepared, this Interim Strategy lays ou t the Bank’s p lans t o assist Sudan between 
n o w and December 2 0 0 9 , primarily through the MDTFs and ana ly t ica l work. I t also 
describes the process f o r eventual IDA f inanc ia l reengagement once cond i t ions a re 
appropriate.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

4. 
Sudan i s a highly diverse coun t ry that faces un ique challenges. I t s people identify 
with hundreds o f e thn ic and l ingu is t ic backgrounds, and i t s geography ranges f r om 

1 

equatorial moun ta ins in the south, th rough swamp (the Sudd) and savannah, t o desert in the 
north. I t borders nine countries, and i t s s tab i l i ty and economic hea l th have p ro found 
imp l ica t ions f o r i t s neighbors. I t i s home t o some o f the mos t educated and wea l thy people 
in A f r ica , and some o f the mos t destitute and disadvantaged. Sudan’s recent h is to ry o f 
con f l ic t has been the subject o f m u c h in te rna t iona l attention; f irs t with the c o n f l i c t in 
Southern Sudan, and n o w with the Darfur crisis. These con f l ic ts can be seen in t e r m s o f a 
h is to r ica l struggle be tween t h e center (Kha r toum and a d j o i n i n g s ta tes s t radd l ing the N i l e 
River) and the pe r iphe ry (the South, Darfur, the Three Areas’, and the East) driven by 
ethnic, social, and economic r i f t s . The t o l l o f these con f l ic ts has l e f t many parts o f the 
coun t ry with a daun t ing legacy o f low human development, v e r y limited capacity, 
inadequate and decay ing phys ica l infrastructure, displaced populations, and shattered 
social structures that the coun t ry needs t o address, and with w h i c h development partners 
can help.

P o l i t i c a l C o n t e x t 

5 . 

The s ign ing o f the C P A ma rked the end o f decades o f c i v i l wa r in Southern Sudan. 
The s ign ing was rapidly followed by the fo rma t ion o f the Government o f N a t i o n a l Unity 
(GoNU ) and the establishment o f the Government o f Southern Sudan (GoSS), w h i c h has 
extensive and unprecedented autonomy. A key element o f the C P A i s the equal sharing o f 
revenues generated by o i l in Southern Sudan. The C P A also inc ludes special p rov is ions 
fo r the Th ree Areas, f o r im p r o v e d decentralization within the N o r t h e r n States, and fo r 

na t iona l e lec t ions in 2009. Following a six-year interim period, Southern Sudan w i l l vo te 

in 201 1 o n whether t o remain within the Repub l ic o f Sudan. 

6. 
The CPA ’s v i s i o n o f a peace fu l Sudan that responds t o the needs o f i t s diverse people 
i s n o w the key goa l f o r the country, and i s shared by a diverse m a j o r i t y o f stakeholders. 
Despite the b road support f o r this vision, C P A imp lemen ta t ion has been uneven after 
i n i t i a l progress in setting up GoNU , GoSS, and the t w o MDTFs administered by the W o r l d 
Bank . O n the pos i t ive side, G o N U has r a p i d l y increased transfers t o states t o fund 
decentralized respons ib i l i t ies as foreseen in the CPA . Ce r ta in e lemen ts o f the C P A have 
progressed well, no tab ly the r o l l o u t o f the new na t iona l currency, w h i c h i s already 
completed. Howeve r , in many other areas, progress has lagged behind expectations. The 
S P L M suspended i t s pa r t ic ipa t ion in G o N U in October 2007 in protest ove r wha t i t 
perceived t o be s l ow progress in implementing the CPA , in pa r t icu la r the demarcation o f 
the border between n o r t h and south (particularly in the d ispu ted r e g i o n o f Abyei) and the 
w i thd rawa l o f Sudanese A rm e d Forces troops f r o m Southern Sudan. The SPLM has since 
re jo ined government after reaching agreements with the N a t i o n a l Congress Pa r ty (NCP), 
i t s partner in GoNU , o n many po in ts o f contention-though n o consensus was reached o n 
the future status o f Abyei. 

7. 
The signing o f the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA ) by the G o N U and some rebel 
e lemen ts in M a y 2006 held out the p rom ise o f the i n i t i a t i o n o f recovery, reconstruction and 
development e f fo r ts in Darfur t o sustain and consolidate peace. But con t inued violence 
and increasing lawlessness in the reg ion has prevented the D P A f r o m h a v i n g i t s intended

effect. In te rna t iona l concern has remained high as the casualty and displacement t o l l in the 
reg ion has con t inued t o moun t . F ragmen ta t ion o f rebel groups has con t r ibu ted t o the 
d i f f i c u l t y in reining in violence. GoNU , the UN, and the A f r i c a n U n i o n (AU) agreed las t 
year o n the replacement o f the AU peacekeeping force in Darfur with a hybrid UN-AU 
M i s s i o n in D a r f u r (UNAMID) peacekeeping force comp r is ing about 26,000 troops and

Economic Con tex t

Sudan has ma in ta ined a sustained record o f macroeconomic s tab i l i ty since 1997. 
However, performance under the 2006 IMF S t a f f M o n i t o r e d P rog ram was mixed, 
re f lec t ing a number o f new challenges in economic management. F o l l ow i n g the onset o f 
s ign i f ican t o i l exports in 1999, economic g r ow t h averaged r o u g h l y 7 percent per annum 

between 2000 and 2006, and at an estimated 10 percent in 2007, i s among the highest o n 

the continent. Ag r icu l tu re commands the largest share o f GD P ( rough ly one-third), though 
d ow n f r om 42 percent o f GD P in 2000. Fo re ign investment and r i s i n g domestic demand 
have spurred g r ow t h in the cons t ruc t ion and services sectors. While exp lo i ta t ion o f o i l 
resources has fac i l i ta ted an increase in na t iona l wealth, i t has also led t o an increased risk 
o f in te rna l and external macroeconomic imbalances, as w e l l as a heightened concern f o r 
balanced g r ow t h in the n o n - o i l sectors w h i c h are key f o r pove r ty reduc t ion efforts. 

10. 
O i l p roduc t ion and p r ice vo la t i l i t ies experienced in la te 2006 and ea r ly 2007 
highlight the inherent f isca l challenges o f an economy with high dependence o n o i l . 
Un rea l ized o i l revenue p ro jec t ions du r ing this period, comb ined with new spending related 
t o the C P A (e.g., transfers t o GoSS and to N o r t h e r n states, new commissions and 
ins t i tu t iona l arrangements f r om the peace agreements), resulted in the highest f i s c a l 
de f ic i ts s ince s tab i l iza t ion (4 percent o f GDP in 2006) after budget surpluses as recen t ly as 
2004. Imp rovemen ts in o i l p roduc t ion and p r ices in the second h a l f o f 2007 p rov ided 
pa r t ia l r e l i e f t o f isca l pressures, with the d e f i c i t estimated at 3.5 percent o f GD P fo r 2007. 
The f isca l expansion and r a p i d c red i t g r ow t h f o r p u b l i c sector f inanc ing s ign i f ican t ly 
weakened the f inanc ia l sector and required several in jec t ions o f liquidity by the Central 
Bank o f Sudan t o t a l i n g 1.5 percent o f GDP be tween September 2006 and January 2007. 
addition, the O i l Revenue S tab i l iza t ion Accoun t (ORSA ) was exhausted in 2006 t o help 
cover the f isca l de f ic i t , and w i thd rawa ls have con t inued through 2007 depleting rough ly 

In

three-quar ters o f deposits through September 2007. Thus the O R S A i s cu r ren t ly unable t o 
p rov ide r e l i e f f r o m f u t u r e revenue sho r t fa l ls without s ign i f ican t replenishment. To ensure 
s tab i l i ty in a vo la t i le revenue environment, prudent expenditure management i s essential. 

1 1. 
Recent external imbalances inc lude deterioration in the current account as well as 
rap id appreciation in the rea l exchange rate. The la t te r has con t r ibu ted t o competitiveness 
concerns f o r n o n - o i l exports, in add i t ion t o ex is t ing supply-side constraints t o p roduc t ion . 
The in fus ion o f foreign exchange f r o m o i l exports and large i n f l ow s o f f o r e i g n d i rec t 
investment have d r iven a r o u g h l y 40 percent appreciation o f the real exchange rate since 
January 2005. Expo r ts o f k e y r u r a l products such as livestock, gum arabic, and sesame 
have fa l len in large pa r t due t o reduced competitiveness. This has hurt the r u r a l producers 
o f these goods, lead ing in some reg ions t o the pa radox ica l phenomenon o f impove r ish ing 
growth. The ongo ing D iagnos t ic Trade In teg ra t ion Study i s l o o k i n g at competitiveness 
concerns fo r n o n - o i l exports, i n c l u d i n g the l i n k s t o the exchange rate and supply 
bottlenecks. 

12. 
The f isca l p ressu res in Southern Sudan are even mo re acute. GoSS’s actual 
expenditures have deviated s ign i f ican t ly f r o m budget plans, with m u c h higher than 
planned expenditures and large d i f fe rences between sectoral spending p lans and outturns. 
Pay ro l l costs have swollen, and f isca l d isc ip l ine has been an i s s u e . The budge t i s almost 
entirely dependent on o i l revenues , and the GoSS’s cash reserves tha t c o u l d have p rov ided 
a cushion a re n o longe r available, h a v i n g been run d ow n in 2006. In case o f a revenue 
shortfall, the required f isca l adjustment w o u l d have t o inc lude painful cuts in p lanned 
investments and/or in the bu rgeon ing pay ro l l . 

13 . Sudan’s debt overhang constrains access t o concessional finance. Ou ts tand ing 
external debt stands at about $27 b i l l i o n in n e t p resen t value t e rm s , with about $24 b i l l i o n 
in arrearsa2 A j o i n t World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA ) was recen t ly 
prepared and discussed with the authorities. The r e s u l t s o f the analysis forecast continued 
debt d is tress , even assuming p ruden t macroeconomic po l ic ies and further increases in o i l 
revenues. Mo reove r , Sudan i s highly vulnerable t o b o t h o i l p roduc t ion and p r i c e shocks. 
Sudan i s po ten t ia l ly eligible f o r debt r e l i e f under the H I P C i n i t i a t i v e after c lea r ing i t s

14. Despite the scarcity o f recent and re l iab le data o n pove r ty across Sudan, i t i s 
generally accepted that pove r ty i s widespread and deep. Da ta from the 2006 Sudan 
Househo ld H e a l t h Survey (SHHS), the first na t iona l ly representative survey in t w o 
decades, p rov ide new insights about current l e v e l s o f human development, though 
assessing progress over time remains d i f f i c u l t due t o compa rab i l i ty p rob lems . The survey 
shows the disparities among regions and the eno rm i ty o f the challenge o f reach ing the 
MDGs. Fo r example, n e t primary school attendance i s 5 3 percent overall, with the ra t io 

’ O f Sudan’s total outstanding debt, IDA arrears amount to about $480 m i l l ion . IMF arrears stood at SDR 
1,021 m i l l i o n (US$ 1,629 m i l l ion ) as o f January 3 1,2008.

ranging f r om above 90 percent in River N i l e State t o 4 percent in Unity State. In the

15 . The outcomes o n key measures o f human development in Sudan’s disadvantaged 
regions ( inc lud ing Da r fu r , the South, the Th ree Areas, and the East) rank among the lowest 
in the wo r ld , though K h a r t o um and some No r the rn states a long t h e N i l e show performance 
well above the sub-Saharan A f r i c a average. The large u rban - ru ra l and reg iona l disparities 
are closely related t o con f l ic t , isolation, pub l ic spending patterns, displacement, and 
chronic pove r ty . Expand ing access t o basic services, especially in t h e parts o f the country 
where human development ind ica to rs are the lowest, i s a key element o f delivering t o the 
people o f Sudan a peace dividend that can show the benefits o f unity and help prevent 
future con f l ic t . 

16. While a mo re p ro -poo r a l loca t ion o f pub l ic expenditures w i l l help over time to reduce 
pove r ty and inequality, this w i l l need t o be accompanied by broad-based economic g row th 
in order t o ensure sustained pove r ty reduc t ion and imp rovemen ts in the lives o f mos t 
Sudanese. G r ow t h has been strong in recent years, but this g r ow t h has n o t been broad- 
based, and appears t o have been accompanied by rising inequa l i ty be tween regions and 
between r u r a l and u r b a n dwellers. Recent g r ow t h has been concentrated a round Kha r toum 
and ne ighbo r ing central states and in ma jo r u rban centers (e.g., P o r t Sudan, Gedaref, E l 
Obeid, and Nya la ) . This has generated emp loymen t and boosted tax revenues in these 
areas, a l l ow i n g them t o spend m u c h mo re o n service de l ive ry than less r a p i d l y g row ing 
states and r u r a l areas. A m o r e balanced pattern o f g row th -w i th pa r t icu la r emphasis o n 
t rad i t iona l ra in - fed ag r icu l tu re and sma l l business sectors-will be v i t a l f o r enab l ing 
pove r ty reduction, l ow e r i n g inequa l i ty , and m i t i g a t i n g con f l ic t .

17. 
A roo t cause o f con t inu ing pove r ty and inequa l i ty i s weak governance and skewed 
d is t r ibu t ion patterns o f p u b l i c resources. The IMF estimates that per cap i ta GDP f o r 2007 
i s about $1,160 pe r year, putting Sudan at the lowe r th resho ld o f the m idd le - income 
coun t ry c lass i f ica t ion . Per capita G o N U spending i s about $280-but 
re la t ive ly l i t t l e o f 
this reaches the p o o r and the remote ma rg ina l ized regions. Deve lopmen t strategies 
adopted since independence have had a centrist bias, and t rad i t iona l ra in - fed agriculture, 
practiced by the r u r a l poor, has seen neither s ign i f ican t l e v e l s o f investments n o r increases 
in p roduc t iv i ty . Pove r ty - reduc ing expenditures have been l im i ted , p a r t l y o n account o f the 
many years o f No r th -Sou th con f l ic t , deepening the cyc le o f pove r ty . Recogn i t ion o f the

p rov is ions t o address inequa l i ty run th rough the respective peace agreements. Addressing 
these inequalities i s also a central pa r t o f GoNU ’s five year p l a n (2007-201 1). I f 
imp lemen ta t ion o f these p rov is ions accelerates, the re can be a reasonable expectation o f 
a l lev ia t ion o f pove r ty , reduc t ion in inequality, and reduced con f l ic t . 

18. Poverty and Development in Darfur. The core causes o f the c o n f l i c t in Darfur are 

closely related t o t h e region’s iso la t ion and lack o f development, pa r t icu la r ly in t e r m s o f 
l ive l ihoods , governance, phys ica l infrastructure, and i t s lagg ing h um a n development status. 
Env i ronmen ta l degradation (deforestation, desertification, and water scarcity) and poo r 
management o f available na tu ra l resources has p laced enormous p ressu re o n the na tu ra l 
resource base c r i t i c a l t o r u r a l l ive l ihoods and has con t r ibu ted t o t h e increase in c o n f l i c t 
between pastoralists and sedentary farmers. Even be fo re the current c o n f l i c t started in 
2003, D a r f u r was lagg ing behind in terms o f human development. O v e r a l l estimated 
p r im a r y gross en ro lmen t in 2000 was o n l y 50 percent, compared t o a N o r t h e r n state 
average o f about 7 0 percent. Access t o p u b l i c hea l th services in D a r f u r was also b e l ow the 
average f o r the N o r t h e r n states. 

19. A l t h o u g h some s ign i f ican t development projects have been undertaken in D a r f ~ r , ~ 
the l e v e l o f p u b l i c investment in D a r f u r over the last several decades has rema ined 
s ign i f ican t ly l ow e r than the average f o r N o r t h e r n Sudan. The limited p r o v i s i o n o f basic 
infrastructure-roads, water and energy-has exacerbated Da r fu r ’s remoteness, and 
limited i t s g r ow t h prospects. Furthermore, a quintupling o f the popu la t ion in Darfur over 
the past 50 years has increased pressure o n t rad i t iona l l i v e l i h o o d systems, with widespread 
env i ronmen ta l degradation and deterioration o f rangeland and water resources. Ine f fec t ive 
loca l governments and weakened t rad i t iona l dispute reso lu t ion mechanisms have p roven 
unable t o con ta in con f l ic ts over l a n d r igh ts and na tu ra l resources. An unforeseen outcome 
o f in te rna l displacement has been the r a p i d u rban iza t ion o f Da r fu r . As m u c h as 55-60% o f 
Darfur’s popu la t ion n o w l i v e s in urban centers o r in sp raw l ing I D P camps in close 
p r o x im i t y t o urban centers. This r a p i d u rban iza t ion has put add i t iona l s t ress o n 
env i ronmen ta l resources while m a k i n g p rov is ion o f basic in f ras t ruc tu re services-water, 
sanitation, e lec t r ic i ty , and roads-both cap i ta l intensive and expensive. 

Well-known projects include, for instance, the Jebel Marra Rural Development Project and Nyala-Zalingei 
Road (part o f the east-west Salvation H ighway ) .

Sudan’s current borders, inherited f r o m the co lon ia l era, bring together a b road

Ex t rac t ive Industries Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI). In con junc t ion with these ‘supply-

society and the m e d i a have an impo r tan t ro le t o p l a y in p r om o t i n g good governance.

In Southern Sudan, GoSS places accoun tab i l i ty and transparency very high o n i t s 
agenda, but the l a c k o f ins t i tu t iona l safeguards and capacity are a con t inu ing challenge. 
There are signs o f action. F o r example, o n June 27,2006, GoSS Presidential Dec ree 
Number 56/2006 established a number o f commissions i n c l u d i n g the Southern Sudan 
Audit Chamber, Southern Sudan Anti Co r rup t ion Commission, and Southern Sudan Pub l ic 
Grievance Chamber. GoSS acted swiftly t o address recent allegations o f co r rup t ion in the 
Ministry o f Finance, suspending imp l ica ted staff, r em o v i n g the incumben t M i n i s t e r o f 
Finance, and launch ing an in te rna l investigation. A review o f a l l GoSS contracts has been 
carried ou t under the leadership o f the An t i -Co r rup t ion Comm iss ion t o assess the 
appropriateness o f p rocu remen t procedures f o l l ow e d under public funds use . 

Access to Bas ic Serv ices 

28. F o s t e r i n g a m o r e p r o - p o o r state. Sudan’s b o om in o i l revenues has been 
accompanied by a la rge f isca l expansion, with public sector spending inc reas ing f r o m 7 
percent o f GDP in 1997 t o 22 percent in 2007. There i s evidence that p ro -poo r spending i s 
ga in ing p r io r i ty , t h o u g h f r o m a very l o w base. Be tween 2000 and 2004, per capita p ro - 
poo r expenditure averaged r o u g h l y $16. After 2004, G oNU ’ s pove r ty - reduc ing spending

increased s ign i f ican t ly , rising t o $70 per capita in 2006 .5 P ro -poo r expenditure i s slated t o 
r i s e mo re r a p i d l y than ove ra l l expenditures again in the 2007 budget. The con t inued trend 
towa rd an increased share o f the budget devoted towa rds development expenditure i s 
important, especially since p ro -poo r expenditures in 2006 equated t o 5 .1 percent o f GDP, 
well b e l ow the average o f 9 .2 percent o f GDP f o r 23 countries that have reached H I P C 
decision p o i n t e 6 In fact, even with the recent increases, p ro -poo r spending in Sudan 
remains among the lowes t in A f r i c a as a percentage o f GDP . 

2 9 . 

M a k i n g Sudan m o r e o f a p ro -poo r state w i l l con t r ibu te t o m a k i n g i t mo re o f a p ro - 
peace state. With m u c h o f Sudan’s h is to ry o f c o n f l i c t attributable t o economic inequalities 
among peoples and regions, the openness by G o N U t o increasing p ro -poo r p u b l i c spending 
i s a pos i t ive sign. Increased p ro -poo r spending promises n o t o n l y t o help d i rec t ly imp rove 
the qua l i ty and quan t i ty o f basic services f o r the poor, but also t o h e l p over t im e t o address 
roo t causes o f c o n f l i c t by d im in ish ing inequa l i ty . The nex t step i s t o ensure tha t budget 
plans translate i n t o actual p ro -poo r spending increases o n the ground, since execu t ion o f 
budget plans has been uneven. 

30 . M a k i n g fiscal decentralization wo rk . Increasing p u b l i c resources devoted t o p ro - 
poo r spending w i l l n o t have the desired impac t u n l e s s the ins t i tu t iona l arrangements a re in 
place t o u t i l i z e such funds. Since mos t o f the p u b l i c sector ac t iv i t ies that d i rec t ly benefit 
the poo r - health, education, water - are the respons ib i l i ty o f sub-national governments, 
this means that e f fec t ive f isca l decentralization i s c r i t i c a l f o r t rans la t ing increased pub l ic

F ive -Yea r Plan. 

3 1. Despite the s t rong owne rsh ip and GoNU ’s comm i tmen t t o increasing sub-national 
transfers, case studies o f several N o r t h e r n states prepared as pa r t o f the ongo ing PER 
underline the challenges Sudan faces in m a k i n g f isca l decentralization w o r k . Successful 
f isca l decentralization depends o n su f f ic ien t ly autonomous and accountable sub-national 
governments with c red ib le budgets and sound f isca l management practices. The state case 
studies show that by these criteria, f isca l decentralization remains a w o r k in progress and 
requ i res add i t iona l r e f o rm and capacity building efforts. States and loca l i t ies have limited 
f isca l and dec is ion -mak ing autonomy, budget p red ic tab i l i ty i s l ow , the re i s a wide 
va r ia t ion between budgeted amounts and actual outturns, t rans fe rs are n o t predictable and 
transparent, and f inanc ia l management capacity i s l ow . 

Estimates o f pro-poor spending are from the Public Expenditure Review (PER) recently completed by the 
Bank, GoNU, and donor partners. The PER working definition o f pro-poor spending includes: locally 
financed federal development spending on pro-poor projects, federal social subsidies, three-quarters the 
current transfers to Northern states, loca l ly financed development spending in the Northern states, and a l l 
transfers to the Three Areas. Discussions between the Bank and GoNU on this de f in i t ion are ongoing. 
Data on pro-poor spending i s monitored b y the Wor ld Bank and I M F in the context o f the Heav i ly Indebted 
Poor Countries (HIPC) In i t ia t ive . (See H I P C In i t ia t ive - Status o f lmp lemen ta t ion , I M F and Wor ld Bank,

33. Addressing short and long-term sectoral priorities concurrently. The urgency o f 

show ing a peace dividend, and the capacity constraints t o delivering qua l i ty basic services, 
means that increasing access t o service delivery w i l l requ i re addressing b o t h immed ia te 
and long - te rm challenges in pa ra l le l . In the short te rm , t o make headway against the 
c r i t ica l need t o boost access t o services f o r war-affected, displaced, and ma rg ina l ized 
populations, r a p i d impac t in te rven t ions must begin t o rehabilitate service de l ive ry 
infrastructure and p rov ide drugs, textbooks, and other u rgen t ly needed inputs. However, 
the needed capacity improvements, as in te rna t iona l experience shows, w i l l requ i re 
s ign i f ican t time t o achieve r e s u l t s . Therefore, over the longer te rm , a pa ra l le l focus must

Small-scale industries account f o r over 90 percent o f manu fac tu r ing in Sudan, and

36. 
In add i t ion t o existing supply-side constraints, the competitiveness o f Sudan’s non-

11 

cu r ren t ly around 2.04 Sudanese pounds per US dollar, compared t o 2.58 Sudanese pounds 
equivalent in ea r ly 2005, largely due t o i n f l ow s o f fo re ign exchange f r o m o i l exports and 
FDI. N o n - o i l exports have dec l ined sharply in l o c a l currency t e r m s and as a percentage o f 
GDP, though they have rema ined essentially f la t in do l la r t e rm s . Ev idence f r o m the

37 . 

Inadequate infrastructure i s a serious g r ow t h bo t t leneck . The vast size o f the 
coun t ry and i t s f rag i le eco log ica l systems place special demands o n transport facilities, 
communications, and other in f ras t ruc tu re services. A l t h o u g h in f ras t ruc tu re has been one

remote areas by limiting access t o markets and services. Other cen t ra l p u b l i c infrastructure

Persistent c i v i l wars have prevented successive governments f r o m c rea t ing an 
inc lus ive na t iona l long - te rm vision, a l though the CPA , the J A M , and the Pove r ty 
E rad ica t ion Strategy concept no te con ta in elements o f such a v is ion . GoNU has developed 
a F i v e Year Strategic P l a n consistent with these frameworks. GoSS i s con t r ibu t ing t o this 
Five Year P lan in the con tex t o f the preparations f o r the n e x t Sudan Consortium, and also 
envisions p repa r ing i t s o w n f ive year p l a n linked t o that o f G oNU . 

39. W o r k i n g j o i n t l y with the Government o f Sudan and the SPLM , the B a n k and UN co-

issues, including gender integration, institutional development, environmental protection, decentralization, 
H IV IA IDS and conflict prevention.

second phase, ‘Acce le ra t ing Progress towa rd the MDGs’ (2008-20 1 l), where development 
interventions w o u l d be scaled up. 

40. 
The J A M ’ S findings were synthesized by a j o i n t Government, donor, UN and Bank 
team i n t o a F ramewo rk f o r Sustained Peace, Deve lopmen t and Pove r ty Eradication, which 
was presented at a Dono r ’s Conference in Os lo in April 2005. The F ramewo rk focused o n 
key themes that were agreed t o be in teg ra l t o conso l ida t ing the peace and fac i l i ta t ing 
broad-based human and economic development. P r o v i d i n g basic security and human 
rights protections, and ensuring the safe return and re in teg ra t ion o f the wo r ld ’s largest 
displaced popu la t ion , were seen as fundamental p recond i t ions t o rebuilding social capital 
and putting the coun t ry o n a so l id foo t ing f o r development. In parallel, imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the C P A requ i red sweeping re fo rms t o governance, the c rea t ion o f new institutions, and

o f the J A M drawing t o a close, i t was agreed in the M a r c h 2007 Sudan Conso r t ium that a 
detailed review o f performance, and an elaboration o f plans and needs f o r the period f r om 
2008 to 201 1 should be prepared soon. While the Bank and UN were heavily i n v o l v e d in 
the first phase o f the J A M exercise, G o N U and GoSS are expected t o take the p r im a r y ro le 
in driving this process, and in teg ra t ing i t with their ow n development p lann ing . 

41. T h e F i v e Y e a r Strateg ic P lan , 2007-2011. G o N U has developed a Five Year

MDTF-supported projects experienced i n i t i a l imp lemen ta t ion challenges in 
reconc i l ing the n e e d for rapid delivery o f r e s u l t s with the l o w capacity o n the ground, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the South, and the need t o ensure adequate f iduc ia ry con t ro ls and 
government ownership. Imp lemen ta t ion by UN agencies was foreseen as one o f the key 
channels t o deliver MDTF resu l ts . Howeve r , the B a n k experienced d i f f i c u l t i e s in reaching 
consensus with UN agencies o n lega l agreements, pa r t icu la r ly re la t ing t o f raud and

legal, procurement, f inanc ia l management, and disbursement specialists with experience 
w o r k i n g in f rag i le states. The Support M iss ion helped Bank s t a f f in Juba t o address a 
number o f key bottlenecks a f fec t ing the pace o f implementation o f MDTF projects. 

48. 
The performance o f the MDTFs - f rom preparing new projects to delivering r e s u l t s 
f r om ex is t ing ones-is 
steadily imp rov ing . In terms o f the preparation o f projects, MDTF 
projects have been prepared with an average lead time that compares favo rab ly with the 
W o r l d B a n k average f o r emergency operations o f s ix months, and the Bank average f o r a l l 
projects o f 15 months. For the t w o MDTFs, 22 grant agreements f o r p ro jec ts have been 
signed, o f which 20 projects are effective, f o r a to ta l comm i tmen t o f $336 m i l l i o n th rough 
Novembe r 30,2007. GoSS and G o N U have comm i t ted $ 5 5 4 m i l l i o n in pa ra l le l t o MDTF 
programs. Governance and management structures f o r the MDTFs are w o r k i n g well, and 
the large p ropo r t ion o f G o N U and GoSS’s own resources that are co f inanc ing the MDTF 
f ramewo rk i s an impo r tan t sign o f government ownership. F o r the GoSS cofinancing, the 
creation o f poo led funds a l lows government resources t o f o l l o w Bank f iduc ia ry practices 
(especially procurement and f inanc ia l management). 

49. Unlike other dono r - funded programs in Sudan, the M D T F s are fu l ly embedded in the 
budgets o f the G o N U and GoSS and they help leverage sizeable Gove rnmen t resources (as 
m u c h as 2/3 o f total p ro jec t cost) f o r pro-peace, p ro -poo r programs. These attributes, 
however, are also responsible f o r some o f the imp lemen ta t ion delays as projects are 
prepared and implemented by Government agencies and p ro jec t funding i s subject t o 
Government budget allocation, re lease procedures, and in te rna l dec is ion -mak ing . Thus, 
MDTF -suppo r ted p ro jec ts suffer from the same imp lemen ta t ion constraints and d i f f icu l t ies 
as the Government’s o w n p u b l i c investment programs. Conversely, however, engagement 
th rough the MDTF helps t o imp rove the Government capacity f o r imp lemen ta t ion i t s e l f . 

50. 
While the pace o f disbursements has accelerated, with disbursements o f about $164 
m i l l i o n as o f Novembe r 30, 2007, the rea l acceleration in the pace o f MDTF 
implementation needs t o be measured by the r e s u l t s achieved o n the ground. One example 
o f successful delivery o f MDTF r e s u l t s i s the Rapid Impac t Emergency P ro jec t (RIEP). 
The p ro jec t has p rov ided pharmaceuticals and med ica l supplies to ove r 500 l o c a l hea l th 
facilities, and med ica l kits t o over 1000 hea l th fac i l i t ies . R IEP has also f inanced the

At the N a t i o n a l leve l , the new na t iona l currency mandated by the C P A has been 
successfully in t roduced with support f r o m b o t h MDTFs, and the o l d cu r rency has been 
completely phased ou t in a l l o f Sudan, inc lud ing the South and D a r f u r . T h e t w o MDTFs 
have also fully disbursed the funds supporting the preparatory w o r k for the CPA-mandated 
Na t iona l Census, w h i c h i s a key precursor t o the upcoming na t iona l elections. In con f l ic t - 
affected no r the rn states, the C omm u n i t y Development Fund (CDF), supported by a $15 
m i l l i o n MDTF-N grant, has made exemplary progress in suppo r t ing commun i ty - led 
development in the con f l ic t -a f fec ted Three Areas o n the basis o f sub-projects submitted by 
loca l commun i t ies and developed th rough a consultative, pa r t ic ipa to ry p lann ing process. 
The CD F has supported ove r 200 fast t rack sub-projects in education, health, and water- 
o f which over h a l f are already completed. In addition, 392 solar-powered l i g h t i n g systems 
have been ins ta l led in schools, hea l th facilities, and other p u b l i c places in 10 remote ru ra l 
se t t lemen ts . I t i s n o w in tended to scale up the C D F t o cover a ma jor i ty o f con f l ic t -a f fec ted

MDTF-N i s also helping t o rebuild c r i t ica l transport in f ras t ruc tu re in war-affected 
areas. Demining o f the Babanousa-Wau r a i lw a y has been comp le ted with counterpart

assistance p rov ided by the MDTF techn ica l secretariat. Summary desc r ip t ion o f other 
projects supported by MDTF-N i s given in Annex 4. 

54 . Despite recent progress, daun t ing challenges remain. Capac i ty i s a m a i n constraint 
throughout the country, but especially given the near in fancy o f gove rnmen t structures in 
the South. L o w capacity leads t o fo rced trade-offs between ownership, building capacity, 
good governance and sus ta inab i l i ty o n the one hand , and speed o f de l ive ry and visibility 
o n the other but these t rade -o f fs must be ca re fu l ly balanced t o ensure va lue f o r money . 
Capacity shortages are especially severe at the state leve ls , both in the N o r t h (with a few 
exceptions) and in the South-precisely where basic se rv ices are c r i t i c a l l y needed.

Lessons Learned 

55. Manag ing the trade-off between delivering short-term results and long-term 

needs. F o l l ow i n g the signing o f the CPA , there were high expectations f o r a qu ick peace 
dividend t o reve rse t h e soc ia l and economic t o l l f r o m decades o f c o n f l i c t and neglect in 
Sudan. At the same time, donors and Government requested the W o r l d B a n k t o administer 
the MDTFs due t o the Bank ’s greater reliance o n Government’s o w n systems t o implement 
projects, w h i c h has the advantage o f p romo t ing capacity building th rough lea rn ing by 
doing-but also required a great deal o f w o r k i n i t i a l l y t o help authorities, especially in the 
South, take o n new responsibilities. When i n i t i a l r e s u l t s f r o m MDTF projects-many 
o f 
w h i c h focus o n longe r - te rm ins t i tu t iona l building and r e c o n s t r u c t i o n - d i d n o t immed ia te ly 
meet these expectations, the B a n k faced c r i t i c i sm f o r i t s procedures and p ro jec t design. 
There i s n o w a better recogn i t ion o f the need f o r projects t o s t r i k e a better balance between 
the short-term objectives o f delivering visible results o n the g round and the longe r - te rm 
concerns with ownership, capacity building, and sustainability. 

56. Wo rk ing w i th implementing partners. Though n o w la rge ly resolved, contractual 
disagreements with UN agencies se t back the start o f many MDTF -suppo r ted activities. 
Since the MDTFs were designed t o r e l y in the beginning o n the a b i l i t y o f UN agencies t o 
implement recove ry ac t iv i t ies in pos t -con f l ic t countries such as Sudan, i t i s v i t a l t o ensu re 
that inter-agency agreements can be concluded r a p i d l y with invo lvemen t at the highest 
l e v e l s o f management earlier in the process. 

57. Adapting project design to deliver rap id results in a low capacity environment. 

One o f the conclusions o f the M a y 2007 Support M i s s i o n was that different p ro jec t design 
models c o u l d have he lped deliver resu l ts mo re rap id ly . F o r example, m o r e projects that 
m o b i l i z e communities, build phys ica l infrastructure, and create jobs-such 
as commun i ty 
driven development (CDD ) and p u b l i c wo rks p r o j e c t s - c o u l d have helped t o deliver 
r e s u l t s mo re rap id ly . While GoSS i n i t i a l l y favo red other approaches over CDD - type 
programs, the B a n k i s engaging GoSS in rethinking the va lue o f this approach in p roduc ing 
rap id outcomes. 

58 . Manag ing expectations and need f o r effective communications. Desp i te 

s ign i f ican t achievements and results o n the ground, the re i s a strong pe rcep t ion among 
MDTF stakeholders that pos t -con f l ic t recovery and development in Sudan i s f a l l i n g short 
o f expected resu l ts . At the heart o f these perceptions are un rea l is t ic expectations. This 
experience has highlighted the need t o create mo re rea l is t ic expectations th rough a 
strengthened commun ica t ions strategy with appropriate s ta f f ing and resources.

with Sudan’s other in te rna t iona l partners, and tak ing i n t o account i t s comparative 
advantage re la t ive t o them.

stable government in Southern Sudan based o n good governance, rule o f law, and 
transparency while p r om o t i n g e f fo r ts t o empower and decentralize service delivery t o the

While the re i s a need t o be selective in choosing areas f o r B a n k /MDTF support, the 
mass ive recovery and development requirements faced by Sudan at this junc tu re make 
se lec t iv i ty d i f f i c u l t , and argue for a broader rather than na r rowe r focus. T o address the

Imrwoving Governance 

64. Building public sector capacity. Capacity b u i l d i n g i s a major focus o f B a n k 
analytical support and MDTF projects-including dedicated capac i ty -bu i ld ing projects, 
and other projects in w h i c h capacity building e f fo r ts a re mainstreamed. In view o f the 
massive needs, however, capacity building programs need t o be further scaled up and 
accelerated. In the South, the ‘learning by do ing ’ mode l ( th rough in te rac t ion with 
individuals and firms contracted f o r the purpose) together with targeted training appears t o 
be wo rk ing , but needs to be supplemented with mo re attention t o i n s t i t u t i o n building at a l l 
government l e v e l s and sector w i d e techn ica l t ra in ing programs. A study o f governance 
and capacity building in the Sou th i s expected t o eventually lead t o a government-owned 
p lan f o r capacity building. WB I i s a k e y partner w o r k i n g with G o N U t o help develop and 
implement capacity b u i l d i n g programs at national, regional, and state levels. In add i t ion to 
MDTF -suppo r ted programs, the B a n k i s expected t o p rov ide targeted techn ica l assistance 
to GoSS and G o N U o n i n f o rm a t i o n techno logy and o i l sector management. 

65. MDTF assistance i s also being used t o support imp lemen ta t ion o f k e y elements o f the 
CPA t o p romo te and consolidate peace. The G o N U and GoSS have sought MDTF support 
fo r the Fifth Sudan Popu la t ion Census (the f i r s t one since 1993) and f o r the New N a t i o n a l 
Currency P roduc t ion and Exchange Program. The Central Bank o f Sudan, with support 

2 1 

f r om the IMF and the MDTFs, has successfully comp le ted the i n t r o d u c t i o n o f the new 
currency as a s ym b o l o f peace and unity to enhance na t iona l econom ic in teg ra t ion and 
development. The Census, supported by GoNU, the MDTFs, U N F P A , EC , and other 
donors, i s scheduled f o r ea r ly 2008, and i s expected t o p roduce re l iab le and accurate 
demographic, economic, and social data f o r development planning, while unde rp inn ing the 
forthcoming elections in 2009. 

66. Ano the r element o f building capacity t o p romo te peace and development w i l l be t o 
help Southern Sudan deve lop a long - te rm development strategy tha t w i l l app ly regardless 
o f the outcome o f the 2 0 1 1 referendum. This w o u l d l ike ly inc lude a p l a n t o t rans fo rm 
Southern Sudan i n t o an integrated and v iab le economic unit, with primary emphasis o n 
investments in in f ras t ruc tu re (primarily transport, power, and te lecommun ica t ions t o help 
to reduce phys ica l i s o l a t i o n and t o imp rove access t o economic oppo r tun i ty ) and human 
development, supported by a po l icy and incentives f ramewo rk to encourage and attract 
p r iva te investment in areas o f n o n - o i l g r ow t h (comme rc ia l ag r icu l tu re and agro-industry- 
e.g., sugar, p a l m o i l , timber (teak), livestock, fish, fruits and vegetables; cement and 
building materials; tourism; light manufacturing; and handicrafts), and the ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity t o manage a l l this. N o t o n l y w i l l such a p l a n support development in the South, i t 
should also support he igh tened stability in the region through increased in teg ra t ion and 
development o f a m o r e c omm o n identity among Southerners. 

67. Decentralization. The focus o f the Bank’s support i s t o assist G o N U in m a k i n g

increased reliance o n oil-notably 
the reduced competitiveness o f n o n - o i l exports. While 
Sudan i s newly expe r ienc ing the comp l ica t ions o f o i l wealth, in te rna t iona l experience can

Box 2: The Nile Basin Initiative 
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) aims to foster cooperation among the riparian countries sharing 
the Nile, and find win-win opportunities to optimize the productive use of water through 
integrated investments in infrastructure (including irrigation and power), reversal o f land 
degradation, improved environmental management, and creation of policies to facilitate 
regional integration. The World Bank, on request o f the Council of Ministers of Water Affairs of 
the Nile Basin, has been involved in the Nile Basin Initiative process as a facilitator as well as 
financier since 1998; furthermore, it has served as a convener for the donor community and is 
the administrator of the multi-donor Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF). For Sudan, the success of 
the NBI so far in building cooperation among Nile countries has opened the possibility for it to 
draw on the waters of the Nile in new ways reaping benefits beyond those provided directly by 
the river alone. 

For example, GoNU is planning to finance the connection of Sudan 's power grid to that of 
Ethiopia, opening the way for Ethiopia to export surplus power generated from its bountiful 
hydroelectric resources while Sudan provides complimentary thermal power. IDA is planning 
to provide financial support for the connection on the Ethiopia side. An NBTF-financed 
Eastern Nile flood preparedness project under implementation, involving Egypt, Ethiopia, and 
Sudan, will aid Sudanese communities in preparation, prevention and mitigation o f flood 
impacts. The Eastern Nile watershed project, under preparation, will address sustainable land 
management issues during the first phase and is seeking support through the GEF as well as 
bilateral donors. Sudan also hosts a regional unit for a Nile transboundary environmental 
project (funded by GEF and NBTF resources), which addresses environmental awareness, 
transboundary water quality, and wetlands protection issues; supports community micro- 
grants; and, fosters dialogue on the environmental function within a future permanent Nile 
Basin institution. Systematic analytical and sector work is planned to explore options for 
major, joint multipurpose development in the Eastern Nile and to guide the Bank 's medium- 
term role, comparative advantage, and strategic partnerships for investment support in the 
basin.

instruments f o r the W o r l d Bank’s engagement with Sudan. Nevertheless, the re i s likely t o

Multi-Donor Trust Funds 

88. The sectoral mix o f MDTF projects in the first phase (2005-07) was guided la rge ly 
by the priorities established by the J AM , with projects approved by the respective 
Oversight Comm i t tee f o r each MDTF, whose membership inc ludes represen ta t ives o f the 
Government, donors, UN, and the Bank. The 22 signed MDTF p ro jec ts (see Annexes 4 ’5 , 
and 6) under imp lemen ta t ion show a generally good thematic and sectoral balance when 
compared t o the p r i o r i t y expenditure areas se t f o r t h in the J A M . MDTF projects cover 
most m a i n J A M sectors, i n c l u d i n g health, education, water, transport, p u b l i c sector 
capacity building, r u l e o f law , decentralization, and good governance, and support under 
MDTF-N and MDTF-S i s d i f fe ren t ia ted based o n the pa r t icu la r needs and p r io r i t ies o f

in this regard. 

T a k i n g advan tage o f recen t , m o r e f lex ib le W o r l d Bank o p e r a t i o n a l po l ic ies . The 
W o r l d B a n k B o a r d approved a revamped se t o f procedures (OP 8.0) to enable 
accelerated imp lemen ta t ion o f emergency operations on Feb rua ry 27 ,2007 . Under 
these new procedures, a high-level R a p i d Response Committee, chaired by a 
Manag ing D i rec to r in the Bank, a l lows timely access t o senior W o r l d B a n k

financial, and disbursement specialists t o Juba in M a y 2007, m o r e such high-level 
p rob lem so lv ing missions are envisioned under these procedures. In m o r e rou t ine

amount o f time. Howeve r , the re remains room within w h i c h t o shorten the amounts

Part o f this improvement can be rea l ized by m o r e f l e x i b l e Bank policies, and faster 
clearances f r o m the Bank . The Bank i s also con t inu ing t o bring mo re o f i t s o w n 
human resources t o bear in assisting the c l ien t t o build p u b l i c procurement s k i l l s . 
Recent developments such as the newly ins ta l led Procurement Agen t in Southern 
Sudan, and n e w GoSS procurement r u l e s should expedite matters. The focus should 
n o w shift t o inc lude state and l o c a l leve ls . 

B a l a n c i n g sho r t a n d l o n g - t e rm results. Projects must ensure the p rope r mix 
between ach iev ing tangible shor t- term outputs, and the longe r - te rm objectives o f 
owne rsh ip and capacity building t o ensure sustainability. Ob ta in ing the right balance 
w i l l require ca re fu l calibration, close consultations, and ac t ive management. In 
adm in is te r ing the second-phase o f the MDTFs, the Bank w i l l exp lo re with donors 
ways t o consolidate donor interventions in sectors with large recurrent and operating 
cost requirements (e.g. social sectors with a d i rec t bearing o n MDGs) i n t o sector- 
wide programs (s im i la r t o SWAps) with unified plans, operating r u l e s and budgets. 
I f this approach can be implemented, i t w i l l a l l ow a longe r time h o r i z o n f o r

Improving communications. A MDTF communications strategy i s in place and the 
MDTF techn ica l secretariats have attempted in recent mon ths t o adopt a mo re 
p roac t ive commun ica t ions strategy n o t o n l y t o imp rove the understanding o f the 
purpose o f the MDTFs, but also t o help keep expectations rea l is t ic about wha t the 
MDTFs can de l ive r . Rea l ism w i l l be the core value o f a cohesive commun ica t ions 
e f fo r t th rough a tw o -w a y process w h i c h emphasizes listening as well as i n f o rm i n g 
and learning. Commun ica t ions o f f ice rs a re n o w in place in Juba and Kha r toum , and 
e f fo r ts t o further strengthen communications s ta f f ing and p rog rams are unde rway . 
The need f o r an active outreach and dissemination e f fo r t i s recogn ized c lea r ly f r om 
the experience o f MDTFs so far. The Bank w i l l continue t o support sponsor 
workshops, “Project Managers’ Clubs,” and ac t ive ly disseminate eme rg ing best 
practices in order t o foster adop t ion o f successful modes o f ope ra t ion and sharing o f 
innova t ion . In this regard, a successful workshop was h e l d in Novembe r 2006 in 
Addis Ababa, bringing together senior GoNU /GoSS o f f ic ia ls and p ro jec t managers as 
well as representatives f r o m the donor and N G O commun i ty .

Box 3: Consultations on the Interim Strategy 

A range of consultations were held to build broad support for the interim strategy program. 
These consultations included meetings in May 2007 with members of civil society, the UN, 
and donors. Consultations with GoNU and GoSS were held in August and September 2007, 
respectively, followed by a final discussion of the ISN with GoNU and GoSS in December 
2007. 

Among the key conclusions of the consultations and briefings was the general feeling that a 
one-year to 18-month time period for the ISN was short, and only viable if set within a longer 
term strategic framework including the key milestones in CPA implementation, such as the 
2007 Census, 2009 elections, and the 201 1 referendum on political future of the South. 
Leading up to the referendum, many stakeholders recommended that the Bank’s should focus 
on fiscal decentralization, wealth-sharing, and other aspects of the implementation of the 
CPA, which are crucial to making the case for Sudan to remain peacefully unified. 
Stakeholders suggested that a priority should be for the Bank to expand its analytical work, 
particularly on sources o f economic growth and how to achieve a sustainable oil economy 
within Sudan. 

Stakeholders underlined that the new ISN should reflect the lessons learned from past work, 
both in relation to the MDTFs and the Bank’s broader involvement. Stakeholders expressed 
the need for an assessment of progress made under the first phase of the JAM, and also 
emphasized that the Bank should be mindful of transferring more ownership to the Sudanese 
as the MDTFs mature and evolve. Another message that emerged from the consultations 
was that stakeholders value the Bank’s role as a co-coordinator and facilitator. The Bank’s 
ability to fulfill this role should continue to be developed, and within this role, the Bank should 
expand its interaction with civil society. 

At the National level, the authorities argued that debt relief should be a main component of the 
Bank’s ISN, in order to restart IDA lending. The Bank agreed to describe in the strategy the 
necessary steps toward reaching this goal. 

In the South, a number of key challenges in the near future were highlighted, most notably the 
risk of fiscal difficulties and the issue of government payroll. The general consensus was that 
the main focus in the South should be on capacity building within GoSS. However it was felt 
that for capacity building to be truly effective it would have to be formulated within a long term 
framework. There were also calls for the Bank to continue building up its work on fostering 
private sector growth. 

D. Partnerships and Donor Coordination 

97 . La rge vo lumes o f human i ta r ian and development a i d f r o m numerous NGOs, 
bilaterals, and m u l t i l a t e r a l agencies have c lea r ly stretched the a b i l i t y o f GoNU and GoSS 
t o coordinate and manage this assistance. Transactions costs a re increasing f o r authorities 
as they face a p r o l i f e r a t i o n o f projects. F o r example, GoSS i s already w o r k i n g with donors 
o n over 100 ongo ing projects. Increased ha rmon iza t ion i s v i t a l t o ensure manageable 
transaction costs f o r authorities, t o t a k e advantage o f synergies and economies o f scale, 
and t o a v o i d redundancies in various partners’ support.

Ex te rna l partners are m o v i n g towa rd common arrangements f o r p r o v i d i n g

p rog ram management. 

100. Sudan Consortium. T o repo r t o n progress by authorities o n p o l i c y comm i tmen ts 
and to renew donor f inanc ia l pledges, authorities and in te rna t iona l partners have agreed o n 
regular Sudan Conso r t ium meetings. The first meeting o f the Conso r t ium took place in 
Paris o n M a r c h 9 and 10, 2006, with pa r t icu la r attention being p a i d t o the need f o r 
imp roved p u b l i c expenditure and revenue management at a l l l e v e l s o f government as well 
as good governance. The second Sudan Consortium, held in K h a r t o um and Juba f r o m 
M a r c h 19 t o 2 1,2007, conc luded with a c a l l f o r accelerated ac t ion t o implement fu l ly the 
Comprehensive Peace Ag reemen t (CPA), with donors highlighting concerns over the 
D a r f u r crisis. The authorities’ progress reports showed that the pace o f imp lemen t ing the 
p rov is ions o f the C P A has been s l ow in some impo r tan t areas, and that p ro -poo r po l ic ies 
and spending-while 
improving-have been b e l ow expectations. I t was agreed that p r i o r 
t o the nex t consortium, a review o f performance in the first J A M period, and plans f o r the 
remainder o f the Interim Pe r iod should be prepared. Constraints o n a i d de l ive ry w o u l d 
also be reviewed. Preparations f o r the n e x t Consortium-to be organized j o i n t l y by the 
B a n k and the UN-are 
cu r ren t ly underway, with the timing and l o c a t i o n t o be agreed soon 
by the authorities and in te rna t iona l partners.

E. Monitoring Performance 

102. Socio-economic data and statistics are limited in scope and r e l i a b i l i t y . The 
p ro longed c o n f l i c t has worsened the qua l i ty o f data available and weakened the capacity o f 
the na t iona l statistical system t o generate u s e f u l statistics. This limits t o a large degree the 
ab i l i ty t o track progress o n key development outcomes over time. 

103. A na t iona l r e s u l t s m o n i t o r i n g f ramewo rk i s included in the F ramewo rk f o r Sustained 
Peace, Deve lopmen t and Pove r ty E rad ica t ion that was prepared f o l l ow i n g the J A M . This 
f ramewo rk was designed a round the eight c lus ters o f the J A M , and within each cluster key 
indicators were identified re la t ing t o progress o n reconstruction, development and pove r ty 
eradication th rough 2007. These indicators are pe r iod ica l ly updated and reported at the 
Sudan Consortia. G oNU ’ s Five Year Strategic P lan has identified e igh t r e s u l t s areas

104. Due to the need fo r rapid start-up, p ro jec t documentation f o r MDTF projects has

expected t o meet the same standard as no rma l B a n k investment p ro jec ts . 

105. A resu l ts f ramewo rk that aims t o help measure the Bank ’s pe r fo rmance against this 
strategy in working with GoSS and other partners i s presented in A n n e x 1. Given the short 
time pe r iod covered by the I S N , the lack o f timely and re l iab le data, and t h e lack o f a 
na t iona l ly -owned PRSP, the resu l ts f ramewo rk i s necessarily l e s s amb i t ious than a typ ica l 
results-based C A S f ramewo rk . While the ISN framework a ims t o t rack performance at the 
outcome l e v e l where possible, in many cases t rack ing the outputs o f B a n k /MDTF support 
i s the only feas ib le option. With con t inu ing support in MDTF p ro jec ts and B a n k and 
donor TA t o strengthen statistical capacity and develop an inc lus ive national poverty

Country Financing Parameters 

106. O n June 15,2007, the Bank established new country f inanc ing parameters fo r Sudan 
that p rov ide the ove ra l l framework f o r cost sharing arrangements, and the financing o f 
recurrent and l o c a l costs, and taxes and duties, fo r a l l p ro jec ts (see A n n e x 2). In l i n e with 
the p o l i c y framework app roved by Execu t ive D i rec to rs o n April 13 ,2004 gove rn ing the 
e l i g i b i l i t y o f expenditures in W o r l d B a n k financing, the f inanc ing parameters f o r Sudan 
make development ob jec t ives t h e p r ima ry determinant o f B a n k (or Bank-administered) 
financing, while m a k i n g su re tha t risks, such as those t o f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty and the u s e o f 
B a n k o r Bank -adm in is te red funds, are appropriately addressed. As such, the parameters- 
depending o n spec i f ic p ro jec t circumstances-potentially a l low the Bank t o finance up to 
100 pe rcen t o f the cost o f a p ro jec t ; se t n o limit on the l e v e l o f recu r ren t costs the Bank 

35 

may finance (subject t o sustainability criteria); a l l ow f inanc ing o f l o c a l costs in any 
p ropo r t ions requ i red by i n d i v i d u a l projects; and permit the B a n k t o f inance t a x e s and 
duties as l o n g as they do n o t constitute a s ign i f ican t share o f p ro jec t costs. The parameters 
are consistent with the recent p o l i c y revisions o f OP 8.00 to a l low greater flexibility in 
responding r a p i d l y t o emergency situations.

Process f o r I D A Reengagement 

107. N o rm a l i z i n g IDA re la t ions with Sudan can be d i v i d e d i n t o three phases, with 
impo r tan t inter-relations among them: arrears clearance; reac t iva t ion o f Bank f inanc ia l 
instruments (IDA lending and grants); and access t o H I P C debt r e l i e f . 

108. Arrears clearance. The Sudanese authorities have taken s teps towa rds no rma l iz ing 
relations with the B a n k and have been making small, i n t e rm i t t e n t debt service payments 
since mid- 1999. This, however, has n o t been s u f f i c i e n t t o prevent a con t inued 
accumulation o f IDA arrears , w h i c h have r i s e n to $480 m i l l i o n . The clearance o f these 
arrears cou ld o n l y be undertaken within a f ramewo rk o f a firm and comprehensive 
agreement among preferred creditors, i n c l u d i n g s ign i f ican t reduc t ions in b i la te ra l debts, so 
as t o make the to ta l debt service obligations sustainable. Once such an agreement i s in 
place, arrears clearance w o u l d l i k e l y necessitate an IDA Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Ope ra t ion 
(DPO); hence, deepening the W o r l d B a n k -G oNU dialogue o n key p o l i c y re fo rms w i l l help 
t o facilitate the eventual clearance process. The W o r l d Bank i s w o r k i n g with the IMF and 
other mu l t i la te ra l creditors t o ma in ta in timely debt i n f o rm a t i o n in an t ic ipa t ion o f preparing 
a comprehensive arrears clearance plan. 

109. In August 2007, the B a n k and Fund j o i n t l y prepared a D e b t Sus ta inab i l i ty Ana lys is 
(DSA) fo r Sudan. Under the baseline scenariog, the analysis suggests mos t debt ratios w i l l 
rema in above their ind ica t ive thresholds over the medium- to long-term, even assuming 
prudent macroeconomic po l ic ies and further increases in o i l revenues. T h e N P V o f debt- 
to -GDP ra t io i s expected t o decline f r om 47 percent in 2007 t o 34 percent in 2017, w h i c h 
i s s t i l l 4 percentage po in ts higher than the ind ica t ive threshold. The N P V o f debt-to- 
exports i s expected t o f a l l f r o m 284 percent in 2007 t o 203 percent in 2009, but t o increase 
thereafter t o 429 percent in 20 17, w h i c h i s substantially higher than the ind ica t ive 
threshold o f 200 percen t ; this largely reflects p ro jec t ions f o r o i l export revenues that show 
a steady decline after 2009. The N P V o f debt-to-revenue i s p ro jec ted t o decline f r o m an 
average o f about 240 percent a year in 2007 and 2008 t o r em a i n b e l ow i t s threshold o f 200 
percent th rough m u c h o f the forecast pe r iod th rough 20 12, but i s expected t o breach the 
threshold b y 7 percentage points in 2017. The tw o debt service ind ica to rs (debt service-to- 
exports ra t io and debt service-to-revenue ra t io ) are expected to r em a i n below their 
ind ica t ive thresholds th roughou t the forecast pe r iod 2007-2027.

The macroeconomic framework for the baseline assumes servicing o f only new obligations fa l l ing due, and 
no servicing o f the more than US$24 b i l l i o n in arrears.

110. The Bank faces a highly unce r ta in environment f o r p r o v i s i o n o f development 
assistance in Sudan. This Interim Strategy assumes the con t inua t ion o f s ta tus quo . In the 
scenario o f a s ign i f ican t deterioration in the operating env i ronmen t in Sudan, the B a n k 
w o u l d consult i t s Execu t ive B o a r d and f o l l o w the lead o f the MDTF donors and the 
international commun i ty in de te rm in ing the scope and content o f i t s l e v e l o f support. O n 
the other hand, in the scenario o f a s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in the env i ronmen t f o r B a n k 
support du r ing the time pe r iod covered by this strategy, the B a n k w o u l d also consult with 
donors, the authorities, and the B o a r d o n the appropriate s teps t o take towa rd possible 
arrears clearance and an increased l e v e l o f f inanc ia l and ana ly t ica l support t o Sudan. 

1 1 1. Some o f the key r i s k s tha t m a y prevent the full rea l iza t ion o f the objectives o f this 
Interim Strategy inc lude : 

L a c k of resolution o r worsening of the Darfur c r i s i s . While the D a r f u r Peace 

Agreement (DPA ) held ou t the p rom ise o f a reso lu t ion t o the crisis, peace and 
s tab i l i ty in the reg ion have n o t yet been realized. Con t inua t ion o f the c o n f l i c t w i l l 
threaten peace, stability, and development in a l l o f Sudan and some o f Sudan’s 
ne ighbo r ing countries. 

Continued delays in implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 

(CPA). Progress in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C P A has been s l ow in some key areas, 
w h i c h has in turn con t r ibu ted t o increased tensions between the parties t o the 
agreement. Con t inued delays m a y have negative consequences b road ly fo r the 
prospects f o r peace, growth, and pove r ty reduction, as w e l l as mo re n a r r ow l y f o r the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank ’s proposed strategy. 

Governance. Im p r o v e d governance i s c ruc ia l f o r de l ive r ing o n the p rom ise o f the 
CPA . The qua l i ty o f governance w i l l also be a key determinant o f the success o f 
support f r o m the B a n k and other partners. L o w f inanc ia l management and 
procurement capacity, and weak con t ro l systems, carry ma jo r r i s k s - e v e n as 
government, the Bank, and other partners w o r k t o strengthen them in pa ra l le l with 
the imp lemen ta t ion o f development ac t iv i t ies . The 2009 elections, mandated by the 
CPA, h o l d the p rom ise o f m a j o r progress o n the C P A agenda o f peace, development, 
and democracy, but also b r i n g risks o f c o n f l i c t and reversal o f progress i f the process 
i s contested o r perceived t o be f lawed . 

Slow progress in building capacity. Espec ia l ly in the South, r a p i d progress in 
capacity building i s essential t o e f fec t ive and sustainable imp lemen ta t ion o f 
development programs. W i t h o u t increased capacity, the speed and effectiveness o f 
Bank and MDTF support, too, w i l l be limited. 

M D T F future financing. Current MDTF pledges and comm i tmen ts cover the 

pe r iod f r o m 2005 t o 2007 . Given the immense development needs, the MDTFs w i l l 
soon reach the limits o f their comm i tmen t authority. New comm i tmen ts f o r the pos t - 

37 

2007 period are needed. De lays in ra is ing new resources w o u l d nega t ive ly a f fec t the 
f inanc ing o f p ipe l ine p ro jec ts and subsequent phases o f existing projects. 

Availability of Government counterpart funds. The f isca l p ressu res cu r ren t ly 
a f fec t ing b o t h G o N U and GoSS put the ava i lab i l i ty o f counterpart funds f o r MDTF 
projects at risk. Reduced availability o f counterpart funds m a y have the effect o f 
de lay ing p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion , and remov ing a key mechan ism f o r ensuring 
Government ownership o f projects. 

MDTF Implementation Challenges. The B a n k has w o r k e d c lose ly with GoNU , 
GoSS, UN agencies, donors, and N G O s t o overcome i n i t i a l hurdles t o rapid 
imp lemen ta t ion o f p ro jec ts funded by the MDTFs. Howeve r , imp lemen ta t ion 
challenges remain, and w i l l put a premium o n the a l l parties’ a b i l i t y t o deliver rap id ly 
o n their commitments. A c r i t ica l challenge w i l l remain gov t . dec is ion making, and 
the resulting bottlenecks t o implementation. 

1 12. M i t i g a t i o n o f ce r ta in o f these risks i s la rge ly beyond the reach o f the Bank, 
pa r t icu la r ly the Darfur c r is is where a reso lu t ion depends o n l o c a l and na t iona l 
stakeholders, with assistance f r o m UN, AU and bilaterals. F o r other r i s k s , the B a n k can 
pa r t ia l ly m i t iga te the p o s s i b i l i t y o f negative outcomes though: suppo r t ing the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rov is ions o f the CPA, helping t o build ins t i tu t iona l capacity, 
supporting im p r o v e d f inanc ia l management and procurement systems, demonstrating 
tangible r e s u l t s from MDTF imp lemen ta t ion to donor partners, strengthening w o r k i n g 
partnerships with UN, AU, and AfDB, in fo rma t ion sharing and ex is t ing co l labo ra t ion t o 

new donors and development, assisting authorities in managing r i s k s o f revenue vo la t i l i ty , 

and app ly ing B a n k procedures in a f lex ib le manner t o ensure the exped i t ious 
imp lemen ta t ion o f recove ry and development programs.
