EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The overarching ob jec t ive o f this paper i s t o p rov ide a coherent strategic f ramewo rk t o 
guide the W o r l d Bank’s assistance in support o f reg iona l in teg ra t ion and reg iona l programs in 
Sub-Saharan A f r i c a (SSA). Re f lec t ing the p r io r i t ies and flagships o f the rev ised A f r i c a A c t i o n 
P l a n (April 2007), 
the proposed strategic 
f ramewo rk builds o n experiences gained in 
imp lemen t ing the IDA Reg iona l P i l o t P rog ram since 2003 and distills k e y elements o f current 
thinking regarding t h e economics o f integration, inc lud ing the ( fo r thcom ing ) Wor ld Development 
Report 2009. Ac t iv i t ies t o be imp lemen ted th rough the SSA -po r t ion o f the I D A 1 5 Reg iona l 
P rog ram constitute the core pu rv iew o f the proposed strategic f ramewo rk . Howeve r , the strategy 
also aims t o ensure increasingly systematic re f lec t ion o f reg iona l p r io r i t ies in the Bank ’s coun t ry 
assistance strategies and in A f r i c a -w i d e sector strategies. In addition, the strategy proposes areas 
f o r enhanced W o r l d B a n k G roup co l labo ra t ion t o leverage support f o r A f r i c a ’ s reg iona l 
programs and integration. 

Reg iona l in teg ra t ion and the c rea t ion o f a Pan -A f r ican c omm o n ma rke t has been a cen t ra l 
v i s i o n o f A f r i c a n leaders since the ea r ly years o f independence. Early experiences w i th 
reg iona l ism in the 1970s and 1980s la rge ly failed, la rge ly because the i r p o l i c y focus was t ow a r d 
impo r t -subs t i tu t ion . M o r e recently, A f r i c a n leaders have m o v e d towa rd consensus o n three 
po in ts : (i) strengthening and broadening A f r ica ’s g r ow t h requires po l ic ies that are m o r e ou twa rd - 
look ing ; (ii) reg iona l in teg ra t ion i s indispensable f o r A f r i c a t o meet the competitiveness 
challenges o f g loba l markets; and (iii) po l ic ies f o r reg iona l and g loba l in teg ra t ion are 
complementary and need t o be pursued w i th equal v igo r . This v i s i o n o f in teg ra t ion underpins 
mos t reg iona l in i t ia t ives underway in A f r i c a , no tab ly those unde r t h e auspices o f the A f r i c a n 
U n i o n (AU), inc lud ing NEPAD. Howeve r , progress towa rd the v i s i o n has been challenging, w i th 
s ign i f ican t disconnects between stated reg iona l p r io r i t ies and na t iona l po l ic ies , and va r iab le 
fo l low - th rough o n reg iona l commitments. 

The W o r l d B a n k has h a d a long -s tand ing comm i tmen t t o g loba l p r io r i t ies and reg ion - 
w i d e programs. In A f r ica , the t h r u s t o f t h i s comm i tmen t was th rough reg ion -w ide sector 
strategies and programs, plus l im i t e d d i rec t support f o r m u l t i c o u n t r y projects. With t h e launch o f 
t h e IDA Reg iona l P i l o t P rog ram in la te 2003, the a b i l i t y o f IDA t o assist reg iona l in teg ra t ion in 
A f r i c a received a s ign i f ican t boost. Design o f the reg iona l p i l o t p rov ided s t rong incentives to 
IDA - r e c i p i e n t countries 
t o leverage their na t iona l development e f fo r ts th rough reg iona l 
collaborations. The resu l t was a d rama t ic increase in requests f o r IDA t o p r o v i d e f inanc ia l 
support f o r r e g i o n a l p r o j e c t s and p r o g r a m s . E s t a b l i s h m e n t o f t h e Reg iona l In teg ra t ion 
Department in the A f r i c a R e g i o n in 2004 bolstered the Bank ’s a b i l i t y t o respond and p rov ide 
lend ing and non lend ing assistance t o reg iona l integration. F r o m 2004 th rough t h e end o f FY07 , 
to ta l IDA commitments f o r reg iona l p ro jec ts in Sub-Saharan A f r i c a amounted t o nea r ly US$1.9 
b i l l i o n . The 15th replenishment o f IDA, agreed in December 2007, increases the funding 
available f o r reg iona l programs in A f r i c a f r o m app rox ima te ly U S $ 8 lO m i l l i o n unde r I D A 1 4 t o 
US$1 .44 b i l l i o n over the I D A 1 5 p e r i o d o f FYO9 -Ey11 (equivalent t o nea r ly US$2 .1 b i l l i o n in 
to ta l funding when the one - th i rd coun t ry allocations are included). 

T h e proposed Reg iona l In teg ra t ion Assistance Strategy (R IAS ) i s presented in three m a i n 
parts: (i) strategic f ramewo rk t o gu ide Bank engagement in assisting reg iona l in teg ra t ion and 

i 

cooperation, structured around 3 p i l la rs and 1 cross-cutting theme; (ii) k e y guiding p r inc ip les and 
se lec t iv i ty c r i te r ia t o c rys ta l l ize trade-offs and choices (and t o gu ide se lec t iv i ty in the face o f 
demand fa r exceeding resources); and (iii) moda l i t ies f o r imp lemen t ing the strategy, i n c l u d i n g 
th rough subregional imp lemen ta t ion plans. 

Strategic Framework for Regional Integration and Cooperation: Pillars of Support 

P i l l a r I: Regional Infrastructure. Stronger and better-connected in f ras t ruc tu re p la t fo rms 
can he lp un lock economies o f scale and sharpen competitiveness in A f r ica , n o t least f o r A f r i c a ’ s 
15 land locked countries. Reg iona l infrastructure w i l l fac i l i ta te m o r e in t ra reg iona l trade and 
exports f r o m the continent, thus s t rong ly supporting A f r i c a ’ s g r ow t h agenda. B a n k support w i l l 
focus o n t h r e e areas: (a) expanding and upg rad ing selected trade co r r ido rs and transport 
networks, (b) im p r o v i n g access t o clean energy and im p r o v i n g supply re l iab i l i ty , and (c) 
im p r o v i n g te lecommun ica t ion connec t iv i ty . Assistance to trade co r r ido rs and transport ne two rks 
w i l l have a special focus o n im p r o v i n g the connec t iv i ty o f land locked countries. Cu r ren t resource 
needs fa r exceed the development assistance and f isca l resources A f r i c a i s l i k e l y t o b e able t o 
mob i l ize . Thus, m o b i l i z i n g private f inanc ing i s c r i t ica l t o accelerate A f r i c a ’ s pace o f 
infrastructure development. In f ras t ruc tu re programs assisted under RIAS w i l l partner with IFC 
and MIGA t o un lock m o r e o f the po ten t ia l t o leverage p r iva te f inanc ing f o r reg iona l 
infrastructure development. 

P i l l a r 11: Institutional Cooperation f o r Economic 
Integration. T h e benefits o f 
strengthened economic in teg ra t ion inc lude enhancing economies o f scale fac i l i ta ted by reg iona l 
infrastructure, p romo t ing trade d ive rs i f ica t ion , and p r o v i d i n g lea rn ing -by -expo r t ing experiences. 
Comb ined with imp roved reg iona l economic and p o l i t i c a l stability, closer economic in teg ra t ion 
w i l l enhance incentives f o r b o t h domestic and fo re ign investment, spu r r ing ex is t ing industries 
and new business start-ups. B a n k assistance w i l l focus o n six areas: (a) reduc ing A f r i c a ’ s 
external trade ta r i f fs towa rd the r e s t o f the wo r ld ; (b) reduc ing t a r i f f and n o n t a r i f f barriers t o 
intraregional trade; (c) imp lemen t ing customs un ions and free trade agreements, i n c l u d i n g 
analytical w o r k related t o n ew trade agreements and ongo ing W T O - l e d mu l t i la te ra l trade 
negotiations; (d) im p r o v i n g reg iona l environments f o r business, investment and indus t r ia l 
cooperation; (e) deve lop ing reg iona l f inanc ia l markets and re la ted institutions; and (f) 
developing reg iona l dimensions o f in i t ia t ives t o imp rove governance and f inanc ia l management. 

P i l l a r 111: Coordinated Interventions to Provide Regional Pub l ic Goods. B a n k assistance 
w i l l focus o n (a) im p r o v i n g management o f shared water resources, (b) ra is ing ag r icu l tu ra l

Guiding Principles of Engagement and Selectivity C r i te r ia 

In add i t ion t o b road selection c r i te r ia that w i l l b e used t o determine whether and h o w the

the IDA Reg iona l Program, the Bank’s assistance and advocacy f o r reg iona l in teg ra t ion in A f r i c a 
w i l l observe the f o l l ow i n g guiding p r inc ip les : 

1. Open Regionalism concerns b o t h reg iona l and g loba l integration, w h i c h as 
complements need t o be pursued in pa ra l le l and w i t h equal v igo r . 
2. Start Small and Bu i ld on Success. T h e la rge r the numbe r o f participants and/or areas

3 . Credible Mechanisms to Compensate Losers ( o r Redistribute Benefits). Participants

4. Attention 
to

I. AFRICA IN CONTEXT: GLOBALLY AND REGIONALLY 

A. 

Global Perspective 

1. 
Ove r the past three decades, the continued expansion o f t h e g loba l marketplace f o r goods, 
capital, labor, and ideas has fo rged ever-closer in teg ra t ion among countries and regions. G l o b a l 
ma rke ts have served as the mainstays o f economic g r ow t h th roughou t much o f the wo r ld , 
pa r t icu la r ly f o r deve lop ing countries. Be tween 1990 and 2005, l o w - and m idd le - income 
economies doub led their market share o f w o r l d merchandise exports f r o m app rox ima te ly 15 
percent t o almost 30 percent. Trade among deve lop ing economies g rew even faster, at nearly 15 
percent annually, t o reach app rox ima te ly 8 percent o f w o r l d merchandise exports. Ove r the same 
period, in te rna t iona l p r i va te f inanc ia l f l ow s tripled as a share o f w o r l d GDP. Meanwh i le , ne t 
i n f l ow s o f fo re ign direct investment (FDI) t o deve lop ing countries soared 10 - fo ld : f r o m l e s s than 
US$25 b i l l i o n in 1990 t o mo re than $325 b i l l i o n in 2006. 

2. 
T h e increased f l o w o f people across na t iona l borders-as 
t o u r i sm and migration-has 
been another prominent feature o f g loba l integration. In te rna t iona l tou r is t arrivals in SSA have 
nea r ly doubled s ince 1990, bringing revenue exceeding US$SOO m i l l i o n in 2005. The 
destinations o f one - th i rd o f these travelers are deve lop ing countries, w h i c h are a t t rac t ing new 
visitors at faster ra tes than developed-country destinations. S im i la r ly , the rising fo rce o f 
international m i g r a t i o n i s re f lec ted b y the $200 b i l l i o n - p l u s in recorded remittances repatriated 
by deve lop ing economy m ig ran ts in 2006. 

3. 
The forces o f g loba l iza t ion have d rama t ica l ly increased the consequences o f countries’ 
domestic economic p o l i c y choices. Oppo r tun i t ies o f fe red th rough the expansion o f g loba l 
markets have enabled deve lop ing countries that have embraced integration-most 
no tab ly in 
East Asia and the P a c i f i c and mo re recently South Asia-to 
achieve unprecedented economic 
g r ow t h and l i f t hundreds o f m i l l i o n s o f people ou t o f pove r ty . Other deve lop ing countries have 
been mo re reluctant t o embrace opportunities f r o m g loba l and reg iona l in teg ra t ion . Am o n g them, 
pa r t icu la r ly land locked countries and those saddled w i th the disadvantages o f sma l l domestic 
markets t y p i c a l l y have made m u c h l e s s progress in accelerating g r ow t h and pove r t y reduction. 

4. 
Nowhe re i s the need f o r a shift towa rd greater in teg ra t ion m o r e urgent than in Africa-a 
continent s t i l l , despite strong g r ow t h in recent years, la rge ly ma rg ina l ized g loba l ly . H om e t o 
approximately 12 percent o f the wo r ld ’s population, Sub-Saharan A f r i c a accounts f o r less t h a n 2 
percent o f w o r l d income and 2 percent o f g loba l trade, d o w n f r o m app rox ima te ly 4 percent in 
1970 ( f igu re 1). A f r ica ’s share in g loba l ag r icu l tu ra l exports has declined con t inuous ly since 
1970. At the same time, i t s share in g loba l manufactured exports (app rox ima te ly 0.5 percent) has 
hardly changed and i t s sha re o f textiles and c lo th ing exports-the 
spearhead o f a n expo r t push 
f o r many deve lop ing countries-has 
remained stagnant. N e t f o r e i g n d i rec t investment (FDI) 
f l ow s t o SSA have doub led s ince t h e 1990s; they averaged U S $ 1 0 b i l l i o n during 2001-06. 
Nevertheless, this doub l ing pales compared t o the 1 0 - f o l d increase in to ta l FDI i n f l ow s t o a l l 
developing countries during the same pe r iod . Mo reove r , FDI i n f l ow s t o SSA are h e a v i l y skewed

N o t surprisingly, therefore, Sub-Saharan A f r i c a 
lags s ign i f ican t ly behind other 
deve lop ing regions in progress t ow a r d ach iev ing the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs). 
Sadly, w h i l e over the last 2 0 years the incidence o f absolute pove r t y (measured as b e l ow 
US $ l / d a y ) in the w o r l d has been fa l l ing , in Sub-Saharan A f r ica , i t has been g row ing . Today,

resource-scarce. G loba l ly , these three categories have h a d d is t inc t g r ow t h performances. T h e 
bes t -pe r fo rm ing category has been t h e coastal, resource-scarce countries; the wo rs t p e r f o rm i n g 
category has been the landlocked, resource-scarce c o u n t r i e ~ . ~ 

8. 
A f r i c a has b road ly f o l l ow e d this g loba l pattern, w i th three impo r tan t differences. First, 
A f r ica ’s coastal resource-scare countries have under-performed s ign i f ican t ly compared t o other 
deve lop ing regions. During 1980-2007, population-weighted, per-capita g r ow t h in n o w A f r i c a n 
economies in this category exceeded that o f the i r A f r i c a n counterparts by nea r ly 4 percent pe r 
year. The second difference has been in the category o f resource-rich countries. These have been 
the fastest g r ow i n g group in A f r i c a but consistently unde r -pe r fo rm compared t o other deve lop ing 
regions. T h e t h i r d ma jo r d i f fe rence i s that nea r ly one - th i rd o f A f r ica ’s popu la t ion l ives in 
land locked countries, compared t o l e s s than 1 percent o f other deve lop ing regions. This fac t 
results in A f r i ca ’s popu la t ion be ing h e a v i l y skewed towa rd the g loba l ly s l ow - g r ow i n g category 
o f landlocked, resource-scarce countries. In the deve lop ing w o r l d other than A f r ica , nea r ly 9 0 
percent o f the popu la t ion l i v e s in the coastal, resource-scarce countries; app rox ima te ly 10 
percent in the resource-rich countries; but ba re ly 1 percent in the landlocked, resource-scarce 
countries. Indeed, and disregarding p o l i t i c a l borders, nea r ly 80 percent o f A f r i c a ’ s popu la t ion 
l ives mo re than 100 k i lome te rs f r o m the coast compared t o app rox ima te ly 30 percent in the 
OECD countries and 60 percent in L a t i n Ame r ica . The impo r tance o f distinguishing the three 
categories highlights A f r ica ’s un ique comb ina t ion o f challenges and underscores the importance

Africa’s Connectivity and Regional Integration 

9 . 

Inadequate access and connec t iv i ty t o g loba l markets and insu f f ic ien t scale economies 
are at the r o o t o f A f r ica ’s ma rg ina l r o l e in the w o r l d economy, w h i c h in turn i s in t r ins ica l ly 
l i n k e d t o the l i m i t e d s tr ides made in reg iona l integration. A s no ted earlier, t o a la rge extent, the 
considerable challenges o f in teg ra t ion can be traced back t o the continent’s pa r t icu la r human and 
p o l i t i c a l geography. A f r i c a has m o r e countries per square area than any other deve lop ing region, 
and i t s popu la t ion density i s l ow e r than any other deve lop ing region. N ine teen A f r i c a n countries 
have fewer than 5 m i l l i o n people. As a result, except f o r the t w o dom inan t economies-South 
A f r i c a and Nigeria-the 
continent comprises countries that have sma l l domestic markets, l i m i t e d 
economic d ive rs i f ica t ion , and generally poo r connec t iv i ty w i th ne ighbo r ing countries. 

10. 
Inadequate connec t iv i ty (transport and commun ica t ions infrastructure) and cos t ly and 
un re l iab le powe r are severe constraints t o thousands o f A f r i c a n enterprises. W h i l e A f r i c a has 
abundant energy resources (oil, coal, hyd roe lec t r ic i ty , na tu ra l gas, biomass and other renewable 
sources), investment c l ima te surveys ind ica te that un re l iab le p ow e r supply and poo r access t o 
powe r are the m a j o r constraints t o business and in~estment.~ S im i la r ly , a l though roads are the 
dominant transport mode in A f r i c a (accounting f o r 90 percent o f in te ru rban transport), r o a d 
density i s less than 7 k i lome te rs (km) pe r 100 s q km o f land. This figure compares with 12 km in 
L a t i n Ame r i ca and 18 km in Asia. L a c k o f roads i s especially cons t ra in ing f o r the high 
p ropo r t ion o f A f r ica ’s popu la t ion in land locked countries. R a i l transport i s made d i f f i c u l t by the 
coexistence o f three d i f fe ren t r a i lw a y gauges, inhibiting interconnections among regions and 
corridors t o the sea. F o r land locked countries, the ove ra l l impac t i s that transport costs can be as 
m u c h as 75 percent o f the va lue o f exports. These weaknesses in connec t iv i t y comb ined w i th 
poo r powe r supplies s ign i f ican t ly raise the cost o f do ing business in A f r ica , cons t ra in trade, and 
undermine competitiveness. 

11.

1999 with the adop t ion o f the Yamoussoukro Declaration, w h i c h l ibe ra l ized access t o a i r

Box 1. Rationale for regional integration arrangements 
Potential benefits of regional integration 
Increased returns and increased competition. En la rg ing markets through in tegra t ion o f sma l l economies (a) 
promotes poss ib i l i t ies to achieve economies o f scale, (b) improves efficiencies, and (c) increases competition, 
lead ing to lowe r prices and expanded supply. 
Trade and loca t ion effects. Pre feren t ia l reductions in ta r i f fs w i t h i n reg iona l agreements can induce sh i f t s in 
b o t h demand and supplies. N e t effects o n na t iona l income depend on costs o f alternative supply and trade 
po l ic ies toward nonmember countries. 
Investments. Reg iona l cooperation and established agreements can attract more FDI b y (a) enlarging markets 
(par t icu lar ly f o r “ lumpy” 
investment viable on ly above a cer ta in size) and (b) reduc ing d is tor t ion and 
l ow e r i n g ma rg ina l cost o f production. 
Coord ina t ion and collective bargaining power. Reg iona l in tegra t ion agreements may enable countries to 
coordinate nego t ia t ing positions in international 
fora, thus ra is ing v i s i b i l i t y and poss ib ly leverag ing 
barga in ing power. 
Management of shared natural resources. M a n y watersheds, m ine ra l deposits, fisheries, and sensitive na tura l 
environments are shared among countries. N o coun try acting alone can ensure sustainable management, 
w h i c h depends o n collaboration. 
Management of “reg iona l commons. ” E f fec t ive ac t ion to combat m ig ra to ry diseases, such as HIVIAIDS and 
malaria, and vu lnerab i l i t ies ar is ing f r om c l ima te change depend o n co l labora t ive e f for ts among groups o f 
countries. 
Policy lock- in and commitment mechanism. Reg iona l agreements can p rov ide a “comm i tmen t mechanism” 
fo r countries’ domestic trade and other po l icy reforms, reduc ing the l i k e l i h o o d o f p o l i c y reversals. Such 
mechanisms app ly to p o l i t i c a l as w e l l as economic re forms . 
Insurance. In teg ra t ion agreements p rov ide insurance to members against exogenous shocks (terms o f trade 
shocks, con f l ic t , pro tec t ion ism in developed countries, and impacts f r om c l ima te change). 
Security. Risks o f con f l ic t are perceived to be lowered through in teg ra t ion agreements as a result o f imp roved 
in trareg iona l confidence and trust, common defense arrangements, and interdependence in key aspects o f 
countries’ na t iona l development. 

Potential costs of regional integration 
Trade diversion. Displacement o f low-cos t products f r om nonmembers b y h igher cost products f r o m 
countries w i t h i n a reg iona l in tegra t ion arrangement has been a ma jor p rob lem w i t h several reg iona l 
in tegra t ion arrangements. We l fare gains are rea l ized i f trade crea t ion dominates trade diversion, b u t this 
outcome cannot be ensured in advance. 
Revenue loss. Trade in tegra t ion agreements reduce governments’ t a r i f f revenues, b o t h d i rec t ly through t a r i f f 
cuts and ind i rec t ly through shifts away f r om impor ts subject to ta r i f fs f r om nonmembers. N e t costs depend on 
h ow m u c h new trade i s generated f r om the in tegra t ion agreement but can b e h i g h when trade fac i l i ta t ion i s 
d i f f i c u l t . 
Ind i rec t costs. A r i s i n g f r om the freer movement o f peop le and cap i ta l across na t iona l borders (cap i ta l f l i g h t 
and losses o f sk i l led human resources, fo r example) and the extra v ig i lance requ ired to prevent cross-border 
crime.

In considering t h e opportunities and associated challenges o f reg iona l approaches, one 
size does n o t fit a l l . Econom ic geography, na t iona l po l i t ics , and the neighborhoods o f countries 
have c r i t i c a l imp l ica t ions f o r the focus and sequencing o f strategies t o advance reg iona l and 
subregional integration. E f fec t ive ins t i tu t iona l mechanisms and capacities are central ingredients 
o f successful integration. The reg iona l economic commun i t ies (RECs) and the i r membe r states 
have m a j o r roles t o p l a y in deve lop ing and sustaining such effectiveness th rough appropriate

Econom i c in teg ra t ion t y p i c a l l y requires ac t ion o n three fronts: behind-the-border, at-the-

agreements o n techn ica l standards and business procedures, reg iona l trade agreements, and 
log is t ics and transport fac i l i ta t ion in i t ia t ives . These a l l expand the size o f reg iona l markets, and 
are increasingly 
impo r tan t . Domes t ic and fo re ign f i r m s 
inc reas ing ly assess

and needs t o prepare i t se l f f o r add i t iona l changes in the trad ing reg ime as they occur. T a r i f f rates in Sub-Saharan A f r i c a 
are s t i l l the highest among deve lop ing regions. However, some progress has been achieved: average rates have f a l l e n f r om 
22 percent in 1997 t o 15 percent in 2006. The continent’s trade po l ic ies w o u l d ga in c red ib i l i t y f r o m b i n d i n g ta r i f fs at leve ls 
closer t o WTO -app l ied rates. 

The lack o f progress in the D o h a R o u n d i s par t icu lar ly d isappo in t ing f o r A f r i ca . A successful outcome w o u l d reduce

Meanwhile, A f r i c a has bene f i ted f r o m several ex is t ing pre feren t ia l arrangements, no tab ly the Eve r y th ing -Bu t -A rm s (EBA)

possible that A f r i c a n tex t i le exports c o u l d recover f r om the current setback i f p rodu c t ion capacity in A f r i c a n countries can 
be sustained or, mo re probably, i f n iche rather than mass markets are targeted. 

Founded w i t h the spec i f ic objective t o b r i n g trade relations between the EU and A C P countries in to comp l iance w i t h 
WTO-ru les (w h i c h p r o h i b i t d iscr im ina t ion among member countries), the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) w i t h 
the European U n i o n were meant to p rov ide a broader and mo re comprehensive approach to economic relations be tween 
A f r i c a and the EU. Nego t ia t ions o f EPAs in A fr ica , undertaken through f o u r RECs, commenced in 2001 but made l i t t l e 
headway in reso lv ing fundamental disagreements, b o t h between A f r i c a n countries and the EU, and among A f r i c a n 
countries themselves. In October 2007, t h i s stalemate p romp ted the EU t o adop t a new approach to the EPA s . I t added 
add i t iona l f l e x i b i l i t y in three areas: (a) geographic scope (by in t rodu c ing var iab le geometry, in w h i c h nego t ia t ions are 
undertaken pragma t ica l ly at wh ichever l e v e l has the w i l l ingness to proceed); (b) p o l i c y coverage (w i t h WTO - compa t ib le

may elect t o rever t inde f in i te ly t o the EU’s basic Generalized System o f Preferences (GSP) o r i t s Eve r y th ing -Bu t -A rm s

w i t h the EAC , ESA, a subgroup o f SADC , and a number o f i n d i v i d u a l countries (w i t h SADC , cover ing Botswana, 
Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and Mozamb ique ; and i n d i v i d u a l agreements w i t h Cameroon, Co te d ’ I vo i re and Ghana). 

Several factors determine the effectiveness o f an E P A in p romo t ing development. These in c lude the degree o f add i t iona l 
mos t- favored-na t ion (MFN) status, l ibe ra l iza t ion in goods and services; restrictiveness o f ru les o f or ig in ; and the ex ten t o f

essential t o m o v e goods, services, people, and i n f o rm a t i o n across borders and can reduce high 
penalties cu r ren t ly imposed o n A f r ica ’s competitiveness. Such linkages also expand market 
access; reduce economic distance; and fac i l i ta te trade, investment and labo r m o b i l i t y . T h e 
resu l t ing in tens i f ica t ion o f cross-border economic ac t iv i t ies can help t o generate employment, 
pa r t icu la r ly in labor-intensive sectors, thereby p r o v i d i n g add i t iona l opportunities t o t h e poor.g

Strengthening phys ica l connec t iv i ty requires a comb ina t ion o f cross-border h a r d 
infrastructure and related software: ha rmon iza t ion o f regulations, procedures, and standards. 
Technical, project-related software i s always inseparable f r o m hard infrastructure, but t h e 
concept o f software i s broader. Imp rovemen ts in roads and ra i lways can reduce transport and 
log is t ics costs, but they are n o t su f f ic ien t t o encourage cross-border trade. D i f f e r i n g lega l and 
regu la to ry frameworks, ine f f ic ien t systems o f customs clearance, and other ba r r ie rs also need t o

29 . With these considerations in mind, under i t s “Reg iona l ly In teg ra ted Spa t ia l Deve lopmen t 
In i t ia t ives ” (RISDI) o f 2006, the NEPAD Secretariat adopted development co r r ido rs as a k e y 
f ramewo rk f o r con f igu r ing , p r io r i t iz ing , and p romo t ing interrelated in f ras t ruc tu re and large-scale 
investments in de f ined geographic areas (box 3). Based o n preliminary findings, in add i t ion t o 
already iden t i f ied development co r r ido rs in Southern A f r ica , NEPAD has i d e n t i f i e d and ranked 
12 such corridors. They were selected based o n fou r criteria: the i r po ten t ia l t o (a) p romo te trade 
and investment-led economic g row th , (b) op t im ize the u s e o f p r iva te and p u b l i c sector

Box 3. NEPAD’s Regionally Integrated Spatial Development In it iat ives 
NEPAD’s Reg iona l ly Integrated Spatial Deve lopmen t In i t ia t ives (R ISD I) , or “development corr idors” are an 
instrument to configure, pr ior i t ize , and promo te in terre la ted in fras truc ture and large-scale economic and sector 
investments in de f ined geographic areas. The objectives are to promo te trade and investment-led economic 
growth, op t im ize infrastructure use, encourage value-added processing, and enhance competitiveness. Econom ic 
po ten t ia l rather than p o l i t i c a l borders i s the gu id ing p r inc ip le fo r loca t ing development corridors, w i t h the focus 
on m a x im i z i n g a corridor’s aggregate economic benefit. Twe lve prospective development corr idors have been 
iden t i f ied . Each w i l l be vetted to validate economic po ten t ia l b y the A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t B a n k (ADB) and 
NEPAD. This w o r k w i l l be completed in 2009. 

R ISD I s build on the successful experiences w i t h several spatial development in i t ia t ives in Southern A f r ica , 
inc lud ing the i n i t i a l Mapu to Deve lopmen t Co r r ido r (MDC ) between Sou th A f r i c a and Mozamb ique . Launched in 
1995 , M D C i s serv ing as a mode l fo r rep l ica t ion across the region. I t successfully rehab i l i ta ted under-used and 
out-dated transport infrastructure and l i n k e d i t w i t h energy, minerals processing, and indus tr ia l pa rk investments, 
b o t h pr iva te and pub l ic , domestic and foreign. 

R ISD I s generally are anchored b y a large-scale investment, typ ica l ly in resource extraction. Coord ina ted 
investments in infrastructure (power, transport, and communications) and re la ted upstream and downstream 
services and industries along the corr idor help ensure value-added t o r aw materials p r i o r to export, agg lomera t ion 
effects (knowledge spillovers and cost savings), and p romo t ion o f economic d ivers i f ica t ion . B y focus ing scarce 
resources o n coordinated and spatially t ied investments, the cost effectiveness o f infrastructure i s greatly 
increased through mo re intensive use. Upg rad ing infrastructure also prov ides opportunities fo r jobs, investments, 
and d ive rs i f ica t ion beyond those associated w i t h the anchor industry, such as tourism. 

G i v e n A fr ica ’s current commod i ty boom, a focus o n R ISD I s i s t ime ly . They p rov ide opportunities to leverage 
benefits 
f r om the anchor 
indus try in value-added processing,

drop, A f r i c a w i l l have a broader economic p l a t f o rm to underp in con t inued grow th . 

30. 

Howeve r , the development co r r ido r approach also poses several challenges. N o t the least 
o f these relate t o i t s scale and comp lex i ty . E q u a l l y cha l leng ing are the present imp lemen ta t ion 
capabilities o f the reg iona l bodies that w o u l d take lead ro les in coo rd ina t ing ac t iv i t ies reg iona l ly 
to leverage development f r o m the na t iona l “anchor” partner. The approach l i k ew i s e requires 
robus t j u s t i f i c a t i o n o f the proposed anchor inves tmen t and associated investments a long a 
development co r r ido r (in re la t ion t o the oppo r tun i t y costs o f resources employed-power, 
f o r 
example); strong b u y - i n f r o m stakeholders; and c red ib le mechanisms t o ensure coordination, 
implementation, and compensation ( fo r countries o r regions that w i l l n o t benefit). 

31 . 

As the spearheads to accelerate g row th , the effectiveness o f the development co r r ido r 
approach depends fundamen ta l ly o n t w o conditions: (a) progress t o im p r o v e inves tmen t climates 
t o attract the requ i red anchor investment, t y p i c a l l y in resource extraction, and (b) lega l 
arrangements capable o f ensuring equitable sharing o f bene f i ts among sponsors and i n v o l v e d 
hos t coun t ry agencies. E f f e c t i v e co r r ido rs also requ i re standards o f governance and f i sca l 
systems adequate to p ro tec t intermediate rents f r o m the anchor 
investment t o underpin 
infrastructure development throughout the co r r ido r and p romo te linkages and d ive rs i f ica t ion . 
F ina l ly , the approach requires adequate p r i o r progress w i th in teg ra t ion t o fac i l i ta te m o b i l i t y o f 
capital, human resources, and services t o leverage the broadest development possible. 

32. 

Thus, w h i l e an appealing in te l lec tua l construct, the considerable advantages o f the 
development co r r ido r approach do n o t o f f e r shortcuts in tack l ing the fundamen ta l issues o f 

17 

reg iona l integration. Whe the r they can p r o v i d e adequate incentives f o r breakthroughs in 
co l labo ra t ion w i l l depend o n whether the anchor investments secure at the outset tangible 
benefits f o r a l l coun t ry participants, d i rec t ly o r ind i rec t ly .

prospective members, along the l i n e s o f the European Mone ta ry U n i o n . A “big bang” strategy 
entails a m u c h faster t rans i t ion w i t h o u t convergence, as evidenced in the mone ta ry u n i f i c a t i o n in 
Ge rmany in 1990. 

34. Whereas the t rad i t iona l op t ima l currency area analysis does n o t p o i n t t o the i n e v i t a b i l i t y

In short, ove rcom ing t h e f o l l ow i n g fou r ins t i tu t iona l issues are c r i t i c a l s teps in fu r the r

d. Strengthening delivery mechanisms f o r p r i o r i t y programs ( fo r example, reg iona l

48. 
A f r i c a ’ s efforts to strengthen reg iona l in teg ra t ion have focused la rge ly o n the f o u r t h 
challenge. Yet na t iona l support f o r reg iona l programs ove ra l l has been limited in the face o f 
governments’ na t iona l p r io r i t ies . L i m i t e d re f lec t ion o f reg iona l p r io r i t ies in na t iona l plans has 
s lowed p r i o r i t y programs, sapping governments’ willingness t o cede sovereignty t o other 
reg iona l initiatives-a 
v ic ious c i rc le . Be t te r progress requires reba lanc ing e f fo r t among the f o u r 
ins t i tu t iona l challenges. M o r e emphasis i s needed o n strengthening l inkages be tween reg iona l 
strategies and na t iona l development plans, c l a r i f y i n g the roles and respons ib i l i t ies o f reg iona l

Howeve r , the process towa rd in teg ra t ion i s inhe ren t ly comp lex and f raugh t w i th p i t f a l l s that can

advanced and p o l i t i c a l l y prepared than others. Furthermore, la rge economies inhe ren t ly are mo re 
self-reliant than sma l l economies. These a re just tw o examples among webs o f realities in the 
geography and p o l i t i c a l economy o f A f r i c a that countries must nav iga te in m o v i n g fo rwa rd t o 
integrate reg iona l ly . 

51. 

Past experiences, experiences f r o m other regions, and the eme rg ing consensus in 
academia suggest f i v e basic p r inc ip les t o guide A f r ica ’s reg iona l in teg ra t ion : 

Open Regionalism-Think Global. The ma rke t t o conquer i s outside, n o t inside. Thus, 
the u l t ima te goal o f any reg iona l in teg ra t ion p o l i c y should be an ou twa rd - look ing p o l i c y

th rough ma rke t -d r iven integration. Co l labo ra t ion t o expand markets and encourage 
compe t i t ion across borders w i l l sharpen competitiveness and comparative advantage. 
Start Small and Proceed in Increments. Reg iona l in teg ra t ion implies a coo rd ina t ion o f 
p o l i c y actions o f many countries. The larger the numbe r o f participants, the m o r e 
comp lex i s the coordination, making i t the m o r e l i k e l y that in teg ra t ion w i l l fa i l . M o s t o f 
the successful reg iona l integrations t o date (EU, N o r t h America, Eas t Asia) highlight this 
p r inc ip le . Mo reove r , reg iona l economic in teg ra t ion does n o t necessarily requ i re full 
p o l i t i c a l integration. Experiences in L a t i n Am e r i c a and Sub-Saharan A f r i c a demonstrate 
that adop t ing ve ry ambitious, comprehensive agreements at an ea r ly stage o f in teg ra t ion 
m a y resu l t in poo r implementation. In contrast, modest, spec i f ic agreements based o n 
areas o f mu tua l interest can inc remen ta l ly build reg iona l in teg ra t ion by p r o v i d i n g a 
p l a t f o rm f o r mu tua l t r u s t and fu r the r ins t i tu t ion building. Spec i f ic cooperative in i t ia t ive s 
in b o t h trade and nontrade areas can s l ow l y build a stronger ne ighbo rhood and 
~ u b r e g i o n . ’ ~ 

Credible Mechanisms to Compensate Lose rs (or provide incentives fo r those with no 

immediate gains). Reg iona l trade in teg ra t ion o f asymmetric countries i s l ike ly t o lead t o 
winners and losers. l6 Es tab l ish ing credible mechanisms t o compensate losers (or ensure 
the red i s t r ibu t ion o f unequal gains) i s c r i t ica l f o r a m o r e amb i t ious in teg ra t ion t o take 
h o l d and eventually succeed. Building o n A f r ica ’s ex is t ing ins t i tu t iona l architecture, this 
p r inc ip le underscores the importance o f ra t iona l iz ing and strengthening the RECs. 
Mo reove r , strategies should inc lude a transparent, equitable, rules-based system f o r 
sharing gains and reso lv ing disputes. 
The Neighborhood Matters. T h e economic geography and ne ighbo rhood o f countries 
have c r i t i c a l imp l ica t ions f o r the focus and sequencing o f strategies towa rd reg iona l 
integration. F o r land locked countries in particular, 
in teg ra t ion considerations are 
in t r ins ica l ly sensitive t o the pa r t icu la r ne ighbo rhood o f countries that surrounds them. 
Champions of Integration. Rea l iz ing the benefits o f reg iona l in teg ra t ion requires strong, 
sustained comm i tmen t f r o m membe r countries. H a v i n g the na tu ra l lead countries o f 
A f r i c a in the r o l e as “champions” 
f o r reg iona l in teg ra t ion w o u l d p r o v i d e an impo r tan t 
impetus t o the process. P o l i t i c a l leaders shou ld v i e w these arrangements as mo re t h a n 
good “sound b i te ” economics and po l i t ics , ded ica t ing the e f f o r t requ i red t o make t h em 
wo rk . 

l5 Examples o f a focused and incremental approach inc lude the EU, w h i c h began b y p o o l i n g coa l and steel 
resources. S im i la r ly , East Asia’s reg iona l iza t ion began w i t h Japan expor t ing equipment, 
technology, and 
construction materials to Ch ina in re turn f o r coa l and crude o i l . T h e N o r t h Ame r ican Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) started w i t h b i la tera l free trade agreements between the U S and Canada. 
l6 F o r example, reg iona l in tegra t ion among low - income countries tends to lead to income divergence between the 
least developed and the re la t ive ly mo re advanced member countries. Moreover , sma l l countries tend to be mo re in 
favor o f in tegra t ion wh i le large countries prefer in tegra t ing w i t h countries o f equal size because the gains f r om scale 
economies exceed the p o l i t i c a l cost o f integration. F ina l ly , when countries w i t h d i f feren t levels o f domestic 
infrastructure integrate, the countries w i t h the best domestic in fras truc ture tend to attract a larger share o f indus t r ia l 
activities. The deeper the integration, the more t h i s uneven spread o f economic ac t iv i t ies w i l l increase.

The W o r l d Bank’s invo lvemen t in g loba l programs dates back to t h e establishment, in 1972, o f the Consultative 
Group on In terna t iona l Ag r icu l tu ra l Research (CG IAR ) . Since then, the Bank ’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in g loba l programs has

Box 4. Brief o n IDA ’ S Regional Pilot Program 

Based o n the general conv ic t ion that reg iona l in tegra t ion can be a strong engine o f g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion in 
poor countries, IDA ’S Reg iona l P i l o t Program was designed to address issues that had emerged in earlier reg iona l 
development projects. The mos t impor tan t among these issues are summarized be low . 
To anchor ownership o f reg iona l efforts w i t h i n the na t iona l IDA programs o f pa r t ic ipa t ing countries, the Reg iona l 
P i l o t Program requires that coun try IDA allocations cover one- th ird o f the reg iona l pro jec t costs attributable to each 
country. I n recogn i t ion o f the s ign i f ican t pos i t ive externalities o f reg iona l projects, the rema in ing two- th irds i s 
prov ided f r om a separate Reg iona l P i l o t Program fund ing envelope. 
I n cases in w h i c h pro jec t costs or benefits are n o t able to be split in to coun try components, a lega l ly e l i g i b l e 
reg iona l en t i ty can take on the I D A cred i t o n beha l f o f the region. An impor tan t caveat i s that experience w i t h 
reg iona l projects has shown that the least successful projects have re l ied o n new institutions. M o r e successful 
reg iona l projects have b u i l t o n ex is t ing ones. 
F o r reg iona l projects to qua l i fy f o r funding, the P i l o t requires that they mus t demonstrate four cr i ter ia : (a) at least 
th ree countries need to participate; (b) par t ic ipa t ing countries and the re levan t reg iona l en t i ty must demonstrate 
strong commitment; (c) economic and/or social benefits o f the investments mus t “sp i l l over” coun try boundaries; 
and (d) projects are expected to p rov ide a p l a t f o rm fo r p o l i c y harmon iza t ion among countries and be p r io r i t ies 
w i t h i n a well-developed and b road ly supported reg iona l strategy. 
While the P i l o t requires pa r t ic ipa t ion b y at least three IDA countries, i t does n o t ob l ige countries to take on 
investments simultaneously o r f o r iden t ica l purposes. P i l o t funding fo r a reg iona l pro jec t through an adaptable 
program lend ing (APL) instrument, either “hor izon ta l ly” to support the d i f feren t pace o f preparation f o r reg iona l 
members or “ver t ica l ly” to support d i f feren t investments f o r a g iven member, can be considered when the p ro jec t i s 
par t o f a reg iona l program to w h i c h a l l members have comm i t ted ( fo r example, a reg iona l power poo l) . 

55. 

Ove ra l l , imp lemen ta t ion o f the Reg iona l P i l o t in A f r i c a has been gu ided by three m a i n 
objectives: (a) t o scale up assistance t o p r i o r i t y reg iona l programs in l i n e with the strategic 
p r io r i t ies emanating f r o m the NEPAD Sho r t -Te rm A c t i o n P l a n (STAF’); (b) t o f o l d this 
assistance i n t o t h e mainstream o f the Bank ’s A f r i c a program, spec i f ica l ly in the context o f the 
A f r i c a A c t i o n Plan (AAP); and (c) t o de l ive r this assistance within the Bank’s country-based 
approach t o ensure the na t iona l ownership needed t o unde rp in imp lemen ta t ion . Requests f o r 
reg iona l assistance f r o m IDA clients have greatly increased, t o the p o i n t that t h e funding 
envelope available f o r A f r i c a under the I D A 1 4 P i l o t P rog ram has been v i r t u a l l y exhausted 
almost ,a year ea r ly ( f igu re 2). 

56. 

T o imp lemen t the increased ava i lab i l i ty o f IDA reg iona l f inanc ing , the Bank established 
the Reg iona l In teg ra t ion Department (AFCR I ) in the A f r i c a R e g i o n in 2004. In add i t ion t o 
projects financed by the IDA P i l o t P rog ram and a p reex is t ing Reg iona l T rade Fac i l i ta t ion P ro je c t 
( F Y O l ) , 
the department also assumed respons ib i l i ty f o r s ix reg iona l projects funded by GEF 
grants. F o u r H I V / A I D S grant-funded projects also were transferred t o the department’s 
po r t fo l io .2o

T h e p o r t f o l i o has bene f i ted f r o m recent ins t i tu t iona l rev iews o f B a n k -w i d e and A f r i c a 
R e g i o n experiences w i t h reg iona l in teg ra t ion programs, i n c l u d i n g the FY06 IEG report, “The 
Deve lopmen t Po ten t ia l o f Reg iona l Programs: An Eva lua t ion o f W o r l d B a n k Suppo r t o f M u l t i - 
Coun t r y Operations,” and the FY06 A f r i c a Reg iona l In teg ra t ion P o r t f o l i o R e v i ew conducted by 
the A f r i c a R e g i o n Qua l i ty and K n ow l e d g e Services Unit (AFTQK). These rev iews d is t i l led 
valuable lessons learned f o r reg iona l in teg ra t ion programs go ing fo rwa rd , and are discussed in 
de ta i l in appendix 111. T h e m a i n lessons are: 

a. Strategic alignment. T h e impo r tance o f a con t inen t -w ide strategic f ramewo rk f o r 
reg iona l in teg ra t ion t o ensure coherence among subregional strategies, sector 
strategies, and coun t ry programs and t o gu ide choices and trade-offs and fac i l i ta te 
m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o f progress. 

’’ Rev iews conducted b y IEG in FY06, the A f r i c a Region’s Operational Qua l i ty and Know ledge Services unit 
(AJTQK) in FY06, and an in terna l rev iew conducted spec i f ica l ly f o r preparation o f M A S cau t ious ly draw similar 
conclusions; that reg iona l projects can be comparab ly successfully as single-country projects. 

27 

b. Ownership and accountability. Ensuring ownership among reg iona l and na t iona l 
stakeholders i s essential f o r successful imp lemen ta t ion . Im p r o v e d governance 
structures t o c l a r i f y accoun tab i l i ty among governments, the concerned REC , 
imp lemen t ing agencies, and donors are essential t o p ro jec t success. Partnerships are 
pa r t i cu la r ly impo r tan t t o the success o f reg iona l projects. 

c. Financing and instruments. Countries with sma l l IDA allocations have d i f f icu l t ies in 
f inanc ing the i r pa r t ic ipa t ion in reg iona l projects in ID A 1 4 , but this concern was 
addressed by p rov is ions in I D A 1 5 that cap the one - th i rd coun t ry con t r ibu t ions at 20 
percent o f a country’s to ta l IDA resources. IDA can f inance o n l y p ro jec ts in IDA 
countries. Hence, innova t ive solutions and partnerships w i l l b e c ruc ia l t o fac i l i ta te 
reg iona l projects that requ i re the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f IBRD countries. T h e l a c k o f a grant 
w i n d ow f o r reg iona l projects in IDA also presen ts challenges t o f inanc ing 
supranational organizations that cannot b o r r ow f r o m IDA and f inanc ing reg iona l 
H I V / A I D S projects f o r w h i c h many countries are n o t w i l l i n g t o bo r row . F o r la rge 
infrastructure projects, MIGA and IBRD/IDA pa r t ia l risk guarantees and enclave 
p ro jec t structures w i l l b e ins t rumen ta l in fac i l i ta t ing p r iva te sector investment and 
PPP arrangements t o m o b i l i z e the needed f inanc ing . 

d. Bank organization, resources, and skills. Con t inu ing e f fo r ts are needed t o strengthen 
coo rd ina t ion across coun t ry units. Reg iona l projects requ i re mo re resources f o r 
preparation and supervision than do single-country projects. Budge t and s ta f f t im e 
need t o be allocated accordingly. Given the add i t iona l wo r k load requ i red t o prepare 
and imp lemen t reg iona l projects, extra incentives are necessary t o encourage s ta f f 
w i t h t h e requ i red s k i l l s t o manage and w o r k o n them.

Emerging Alignment o f Regional and Country Programs 

68. 

As men t ioned above, imp lemen ta t ion o f the Reg iona l P i l o t P rog ram in A f r i c a has been 
guided by the strategic p r io r i t ies emanating f r o m the NEPAD Sho r t -Te rm A c t i o n Plan (STAP), 

30 

Bank’s A f r i c a A c t i o n P l a n (AAP), and B a n k sector strategies. The FY06 r e v i ew o f reg iona l 
programs by E G concluded that the Bank’s reg iona l engagement in A f r i c a was strategically we l l 
aligned with the p r io r i t ies o f the IDA P i l o t P rog ram and w i t h NEPAD, pa r t icu la r ly the 
infrastructure-focused STAP , no tw i ths tand ing that strategic p r io r i t ies have extended beyond 
infrastructure. 

69 . 

T o guide the Bank’s reg iona l assistance, and f o l l o w i n g the first subregional strategy f o r 
Southern A f r i c a comp le ted in 1998, the Bank p roduced similar strategies f o r Cen t ra l A f r ica , Eas t

UEMOA and E C O W A S o f a reg iona l pove r t y reduc t ion strategy (PRS). A l t h o u g h b road ly 
s im i la r in t h r u s t , the subregional strategies have s ign i f ican t variations in rationale, objectives, 
and p r io r i t ies ; guiding principles; and methodology. M o s t o f these differences arise f r o m spec i f ic

IV . PROPOSED REGIONAL INTEGRATION ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

77. 
The overarching objective o f this strategy i s t o p r o v i d e a coherent and strategically 
focused f ramewo rk t o guide the B a n k Group’s assistance in support o f regional in teg ra t ion and 
reg iona l programs in SSA. With a p o i n t o f departure in t h e experiences gained over the past f o u r 
years under the Reg iona l P i l o t Program, the strategy focuses o n the p r io r i t ies and flagships o f the 
rev ised A f r i c a A c t i o n P lan (AAP). The recent agreements o n the 15* replenishment o f IDA 
doubled the topp ing -up funding available f o r reg iona l programs t o nea r ly US$1 .5 b i l l i o n over 
FYO9-FY 11. This increase s ign i f ican t ly boosts the Bank’s a b i l i t y t o ass is t reg iona l in teg ra t ion 
efforts in A f r i c a (box 7 ) and underpins the importance o f a strategic f ramewo r k t o focus and 
guide that support. 

Box 7. IDA 1 5 Regional Program 
As par t o f the I D A 1 5 replenishment agreement reached on December 14,2007, donors decided to allocate SDR400 
m i l l i o n per year, or SDR1.2 b i l l i o n fo r the 3 years FYO9-FY11, 
f o r the IDA Reg iona l Program. This to ta l 
represents a 100 percent increase compared to the i n i t i a l a l loca t ion under the I D A 1 4 P i l o t Program (SDR200 
m i l l i o n ) and a 60 percent increase compared to the increased a l loca t ion o f SDR2.50 that donors retained at the 
I D A 1 4 m id - te rm rev iew . As prev ious ly mentioned, 80 percent o f this a l loca t ion i s envisaged fo r A f r ica , amoun t ing 
to SDR320 m i l l i o n per year, or SDR960 m i l l i o n in to ta l fo r ID A 1 5 . T a k i n g in to account the requ ired one- th ird 
fund ing con tr ibu t ions f r om country allocations, the to ta l envelope o f IDA f inanc ing available f o r reg iona l pro jec ts 
in A f r i c a du r ing I D A 1 5 w i l l be SDR1.44 b i l l ion , or approximately US$2.1 b i l l i o n . 
As w i t h IDA 1 4 , reg iona l projects w i l l be financed under the 1/3:2/3 formu la . One- th ird o f funds w i l l be con tr ibu ted 
f r om the ind iv idua l countries’ IDA performance-based a l loca t ion (PBA) envelope, and two- th irds w i l l b e me t w i t h 
funds f r om the reg iona l envelope. This split has p roven to b o t h p rov ide incentives f o r reg iona l in tegra t ion and 
ensure country b u y - i n and comm i tmen t to reg iona l projects. W h i l e the 1/3:2/3 split generally has worked we l l , in 
several instances, the 1/3 con tr ibu t ion requirement has constrained the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f countries w i t h a sma l l PBA 
envelope. T o alleviate th is problem, fo r countries w i t h sma l l na t iona l IDA allocations, I D A 1 5 l im i t s aggregate 
na t iona l con tr ibu t ions to reg iona l projects to a ce i l ing o f 20 percent o f the country’s PBA envelope. A d d i t i o n a l 
na t iona l contributions w i l l be covered 100 percent f r om the reg iona l envelope. 
The I D A 1 5 m id - te rm rev iew w i l l present an oppor tun i ty to re f lec t o n the scaling-up o f the Reg iona l P i l o t Program 
and experience w i t h the 20 percent con tr ibu t ion ce i l ing a imed at countries w i t h sma l l IDA allocations to determine 
whether any adjustments are necessary. 

78. 
The proposed reg iona l in teg ra t ion assistance strategy i s set ou t be low , in three m a i n parts. 
First, the strategic f ramewo rk o f the strategy i s presented, structured around th ree strategic pillars 
(regional infrastructure, ins t i tu t iona l cooperation f o r economic integration, and coordinated 
interventions t o p rov ide reg iona l p u b l i c goods) and one cross-cutting theme (strengthening 
reg iona l strategic p lann ing and connections w i th na t iona l development plans). Re f lec t ing this 
structure, a second part outlines key p r inc ip les and c r i te r ia t o gu ide the Bank’s lending and 
non lend ing engagements w i t h i n t h e th ree p i l la rs (and t h e cross-cutting theme). A third pa r t 
outlines h o w imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy w i l l be undertaken th rough subregional plans, in 
pa ra l le l w i t h con t inen t -w ide assistance t o capacity building and e f fo r ts t o strengthen donor 
coo rd ina t ion and ha rmon iza t ion . These imp lemen ta t ion p lans w i l l b e developed in FY 0 9 . In the 
interim, a br ie f discussion o f the proposed F Y 0 9 lend ing and AAA p rog ram i s p rov ided . In

80. 

The architecture o f the proposed strategy i s deliberately open and f lex ib le . In this way, i t

g radua l ly m o v i n g towa rd a comprehensive Bank G roup strategy, these considerations underscore 
the importance o f an open architecture that a l lows adaptations and alignments in response t o 
external developments and imp lemen ta t ion experience.

Deve lopmen t o f the strategy has bene f i ted f r o m extensive inputs f r o m stakeholders: 
reg iona l bodies, na t iona l governments, academia, p r iva te sector representatives, c i v i l society 
representatives and development partners. In add i t ion t o numerous meetings w i th i n d i v i d u a l 
stakeholder groups, stakeholder consultations h e l d in N a i r o b i in January 2007 and in 
Washington, D C in October 2007 were valuable fo ra in w h i c h the B a n k was able t o test e v o l v i n g 
thinking and receive feedback o n h o w t o repos i t ion and rebalance i t s assistance strategy t o best

B e y o n d the economic oppo r tun i t ies o f reg iona l integration, other impo r tan t development

f o r w h i c h an equitable “pay -o f f ma t r ix ” i s m o r e d i f f i c u l t t o 
establish. Because demand f o r assistance with reg iona l programs far exceeds available resources, 
and t o h e l p focus Bank assistance, the f o l l ow i n g broad selection c r i te r ia w i l l b e used t o

In situations in w h i c h there are inadequate incentives f o r a coun t ry to take i n t o account 
t h e needs o r interests o f ne ighbo r ing countries (in other words, a p a y - o f f m a t r i x that i s

incentives necessary t o i n v o l v e a l l the partners. In the case o f transport infrastructure, this

strategically be fo re the development o f clear linkages be tween reg iona l in teg ra t ion strategies and

In parallel, the Bank w i l l seek t o engage in strategic partnerships w i th k e y donors t o

Bank Instruments 

127. W h i l e IDA credits have been made t o reg iona l organizations on at least f ive occasions in

In a departure f r o m t h i s practice, the IDA p i l o t inc luded exp l ic i t p rov is ions f o r l e n d i n g t o

organizations that are unable t o bo r row . Since I D A 1 4 , the sole c r i te r ion f o r making IDA grant

strong partnerships w i th other donors. F ina l ly , some o f the poorest IDA countries are constrained

Results Framework and Risk Management 

Results Monitoring 

128. As men t ioned earlier, results matrices w i l l b e developed f o r each o f the f o u r subregional 
imp lemen ta t ion plans. Fo r purposes of monitoring the ro l l -ou t of 
the strategy, appendix IX sets 
out key pe$ormance indicators related to actions under Bank control. 

Managing Risks 

129. A matrix has been developed that identifies the main risks facing RIAS implementation 
and how these might be mitigated, to the extent feasible (appendix X). The risk m a t r i x and 
m i t i g a t i n g strategies and actions cover eight m a i n risk areas. 

130. Political support constituencies. The m a i n risk fac ing progress in reg iona l in teg ra t ion i s 
that p o l i t i c a l support weakens unde r the con t inu ing f rus t ra t ion o f s low imp lemen ta t ion o f p r i o r i t y

comm i tmen t t o in teg ra t ion i s mos t so l id and at the con t inen ta l - leve l and reg iona l partnerships 
have shown themselves t o be durable. Exposu re t o exogenous risks i s m i t iga ted also by the 
Bank’s assistance t o reg iona l in teg ra t ion in each r e g i o n o f A f r ica . I t i s h i g h l y u n l i k e l y tha t

w o u l d h a r m the effectiveness o f RIAS in the area concerned and p robab ly in t h e CASs

t a k e t ime . I t i s n o t clear that any adjustments a re l ike ly w i t h i n the R I A S imp lemen ta t ion period. 
At s t a k e i s n o t a fa i lu re o f R I A S but l im i ta t ions t o the strategy’s effectiveness i f p r i o r i t y

therefore i s impo r tan t f o r R I A S t o assist ra t iona l iza t ion e f fo r ts b y the AU. T o limit exposure, 
RIAS w i l l base engagements p r im a r i l y o n alignments o f na t iona l p o l i t i c a l support, rather than o n 
R E C strategies. 

132. Capacity development. T h e capacity o f reg iona l ins t i tu t ions , REC s in particular, i s

infrastructure development, and f inanc ia l sector in teg ra t ion i s essential t o im p r o v e a l ignmen t 
between reg iona l and na t iona l p o l i c y p r io r i t ies . Absent im p r o v e d capacity, i t w i l l b e d i f f i c u l t t o 
achieve p o l i c y alignments to u n l o c k add i t iona l in teg ra t ion opportunities. No tw i ths tand ing this, 
R E C capacity i s less a risk t o the effectiveness o f RIAS than an oppo r tun i t y t o leverage further 
impac t . Imp lemen ta t ion o f R I A S w i l l n o t h inge o n R E C programs, n o r does the strategy l o o k 
towa rd RECs t o lead c r i t i c a l activities. A l t h o u g h mo re e f fec t ive RECs w o u l d u n l o c k add i t iona l

opportunities w i t h REC s func t ion ing as they are. Therefore, successful imp lemen ta t ion o f R I A S 
i s n o t predicated o n stronger RECs. 

133. Linkages with country programs. T h e effectiveness o f RIAS w i l l b e determined la rge ly 
by h o w i t i s imp lemen ted at the na t iona l leve l . Cen t ra l t o the strategy’s design i s , first, that m u c h

challenge head-on. 

134. Alignment and harmonization. Partnerships w i t h b o t h the p r iva te sector and o f f i c i a l 
development partners are essential t o leverage impacts f r o m Bank assistance-hence are c r i t i c a l 
t o the effectiveness o f R I A S . T h e strategy therefore places considerable emphasis o n 
partnerships. Pa r t icu la r ly in programs o f reg iona l infrastructure, R I A S w i l l emphasize ca ta lyz ing 
p r iva te k n ow - h ow and investment. Programs 
i n v o l v i n g o f f i c i a l donors w i l l emphasize 
sharpening alignment and ha rmon i za t ion t o leverage the effectiveness o f available resources. 
W h i l e recent progress been encouraging, f o r the mos t part, a l ignmen t and ha rmon iza t ion in 
reg iona l programs have n o t yet ma tched t h e improvements achieved in coun t r y programs. 

135. Program complexity. Mindful o f the capabilities o f a l l partners, i n c l u d i n g the Bank, a 
general challenge t o imp lemen t R I A S w i l l be t o limit the comp lex i t y o f reg iona l programs. By 
the i r nature, reg iona l programs o f t e n are mo re comp lex than na t iona l programs, i n v o l v i n g 
m u l t i p l e clients and arrays o f na t iona l agencies and stakeholders. A l t h o u g h reg iona l programs 
requ i re agreement o n core objectives, the objectives o f participants usua l ly are a l igned l e s s than 
pe r fec t ly . Thus, there i s a tendency f o r reg iona l programs t o inco rpo ra te the na t iona l components

The divergence in popu la t ion -we igh ted per cap i ta g r ow t h performance between A f r i c a 
and other deve lop ing countries has been high, nea r ing an average 4% gap since the 1970s. The 
bulk o f t h i s divergence has come f r o m the resource-scarce coastal countries category, where SSA 
has consistently underperformed in comparison t o other deve lop ing r iva ls . G loba l ly , this has 
been the h ighes t pe r fo rm ing group and accounts f o r nea r ly 88% o f the to ta l popu la t ion f r o m the 
other deve lop ing countries sample, w h i l e in SSA this group accounts f o r o n l y 37% o f the 
popu la t ion and has actually pe r fo rmed worse than i t s resource-rich neighbors. A f r ica ’s 
land locked countries have experienced the least divergence, though this i s m o s t l y due t o the p o o r 
performance o f r iva ls , n o t superior g row th in these countries. In fact, SSA’s high numbe r o f 
land locked countries (15), and large popu la t ion within the Resource-Scarce Land locked 
countries category ( rough ly 34% compared with less than 2% in the sample group o f other

APPENDIX 11. THE EVOLVING INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE FOR 
REGIONAL INTEGRATION IN AFRICA 

1. 

The seeds o f Pan-Africanism-the movement t o u n i t e the A f r i c a n continent econom ica l ly 
and po l i t ica l ly , date back t o the 18* cen tu ry among A f r i c a n visionaries and members o f the 
Diaspora. T h e idea began t o take a mo re concrete shape w i t h the first Pan -A f r ican Congress h e l d 
in 1900, g radua l ly ga in ing momen tum until f o rm a l l y enshrined in the f o u n d i n g charter o f t h e 
O rgan iza t ion o f A f r i c a n Unity in 1963, the precursor t o the m o d em A f r i c a n U n i o n . O r i g i n a l l y 
focused o n supporting independence movements, gradual progress towa rd deco lon iza t ion 
p rov ided the oppo r tun i ty f o r the O A U t o rea l ign i t s p r io r i t ies towa rd Pan -A f r ican in teg ra t ion . 
The Lagos P l a n o f A c t i o n in 1980 articulated the goa l o f a common A f r i c a n market t o be 
achieved by 2000, and expressed n o t i o n that emerging reg iona l bodies and con f igu ra t ions shou ld 
u l t ima te ly converge t o f o r m a single Pan -A f r ican arrangement. 

2. 
Within the context o f t h e movemen t towa rd con t inen t -w ide integration, reg iona l and 
subregional ins t i tu t iona l arrangements have been g r ow i n g in number and comp lex i ty since t h e 
1960s. A f r i c a i s n o w home t o mo re o f these organizations than any other w o r l d reg ion . W h i l e 
these ins t i tu t ions were generally fo rmed t o serve their o w n un ique l o g i c and purpose, they also 
are viewed by many as stepping stones t ow a r d the higher aspiration o f Pan -A f r ican in teg ra t ion . 

3. 
The driving forces beh ind the mu l t i tude o f reg iona l - leve l organizations that ex is t in 
A f r i c a today are b o t h in te rna l t o A f r i c a and in response t o developments elsewhere in t h e wo r ld . 
The ‘first-generation,’ o r ‘first wave’ o f reg iona l l e v e l ins t i tu t ions took shape in the 1970s 
th rough early- 1980s. P reva i l ing impo r t -subs t i tu t ion indus t r ia l iza t ion ( IS I ) po l ic ies o f the t im e 
underscored the necessity o f reg iona l in teg ra t ion as a means t o p r o v i d e su f f ic ien t scale 
economies requ i red t o spur adequate demand f o r domestic (or regional) industries and t o l ow e r 
costs per unit o f output. The success o f the European Commun i ty ’s first enlargement in the 
1970s served as an additional catalyst beh ind the p ro l i fe ra t ion o f reg iona l arrangements. 

4. 
The first-generation reg iona l in teg ra t ion schemes u l t ima te ly fa i led f o r several reasons. 
Built o n weak na t iona l institutions, member countries f a i l e d t o imp lemen t solutions emanating 
f r o m reg iona l commitments. Reg iona l ins t i tu t ions , be ing o f an intergovernmental fo rm , were too 
weak in mandate and capacity t o pursue activities associated w i th membe r states’ deep 
in teg ra t ion objectives. This inwa rd - look ing , state-led reg iona l in teg ra t ion strategy o f the ea r ly 
in teg ra t ion schemes also fa i led f o r the same reasons as the u n d e r l y i n g na t iona l im p o r t - 
subs t i tu t ion po l ic ies . 

5. 

As countries progressively sw i tched f r o m impo r t -subs t i tu t ion t o mo re ou twa rd -o r ien ted 
po l ic ies starting in the early 1980s, the ‘second-generation’ o r ‘second wave’ o f reg iona l 
in teg ra t ion schemes in SSA t o o k ho ld , accelerating i n t o the first h a l f o f the 1990s. T h e second 
generation reg iona l ins t i tu t ions were generally n o t n ew creations, but arose f r o m rev i ta l iza t ion 
and expansion o f the mandates o f preexisting, but la rge ly defunct reg iona l bodies. In ma rked 
contrast to the i r isolationist predecessors, the n ew bodies were t y p i c a l l y characterized by open 
reg iona l arrangements t o increase in teg ra t ion n o t o n l y among member states but also w i th g loba l 
markets. Nevertheless, progress 
towa rd reg iona l in teg ra t ion rema ined s low and A f r i c a 
experienced increasing exc lus ion f r o m economic linkages and bene f i ts o f g loba l iza t ion . Thus, 
the 1991 A f r i c a n Heads o f State Summ i t in A b u j a adopted a treaty w i t h the ob jec t ive o f c rea t ing 

54 

an A f r i c a n Econom ic C omm u n i t y by 2028, and w h i c h set ou t a t ime tab le f o r in teg ra t ion o f the 
continent. A phased process o f progressively deeper and broader in teg ra t ion was envisaged, 
starting w i t h free trade areas and customs unions, m o v i n g t o c omm o n markets, and end ing in an 
economic and monetary u n i o n among the continent’s 53 countries ( inc lud ing N o r t h A f r ica ) . 

6. 

Recogn iz ing changes in the external environment and o n the continent, at the beginning 
o f the new millennium, A f r i c a n leaders reso lved t o adapt t h e i r development strategy and 
accelerate reg iona l integration. F o r this purpose, they changed the O rgan iza t ion o f A f r i c a n Unity 
and the A b u j a T rea ty i n t o the A f r i c a n U n i o n (AU) th rough a Cons t i tu t ive A c t o f 2002. T h e AU 
objectives are m o r e comprehensive than those o f the OAU, while i t s unde r ly ing p r inc ip les

strategy represented b y NEPAD. A ma jo r shift in approach o n sovereignty i s d isce rn ib le th rough

f r o m t h e intergovernmental fo rms o f reg iona l in teg ra t ion espoused in the past. See box A2.1 f o r 

brief description of the AU and NEPAD. 

7. 

S im i la r t o the A b u j a Treaty, t h e Cons t i tu t ive A c t o f the AU recognizes the reg iona l 
economic communities as the p i l la rs o f continental in teg ra t ion and ins t i tu t ions t o w h i c h eve ry 
state should belong, entrenches the i r lega l status as d is t inc t and independent entities and p rov ides 
f o r t h e creation o f a n ins t rumen t t o gove rn relations w i t h RECs . 

8. 

W h i l e the RECs have made substantial achievements in several areas, as described i n box 
A2.2, ove ra l l progress towa rd reg iona l in teg ra t ion and strengthened coope ra t ion i s m ixed . Only a 
sma l l f rac t ion o f the REC s have thus achieved t h e i r targets f o r trade among members and 
s im i la r ly f ew have undertaken concerted e f fo r ts towa rd common labo r laws, f ree movemen t o f 
labor, and rights o f residence and establishment. Moreover, many also are lagg ing o n almost a l l 
c r i t ica l elements necessary f o r the success o f the nex t phases o f in teg ra t ion such as customs and 
monetary unions. E v e n w i th regard t o the sectoral programs needed t o deepen A f r i c a n 
integration, a third t o a h a l f o f the reg iona l economic commun i t ies acknowledge shortcomings in 
the effectiveness o f the i r in i t ia t ives towa rd the in teg ra t ion goals.

Box A2.1 A U and NEPAD 

The African Union (AU ) i s a Pan-A fr ican organ iza t ion o f 53 member countries, aimed at crea t ing a un i ted 
continent through a process o f p o l i t i c a l and economic integration. The AU was launched at the Du rban S umm i t in 
2002, as a successor o f the Organization o f A f r i c a n U n i t y (OAU ) . 

The purpose o f the AU i s to help secure A fr ica ’s democracy, human rights, and to promo te a sustainable economy, 
especially b y b r i n g i n g an end to h a A f r i c a n con f l ic t and creating an e f fec t ive common market. W i t h these aims,

Box A2.2. Successes in African RECs and regional cooperation 
A l though progress in A f r i c a n cooperation and in tegra t ion as w e l l as the effectiveness o f RECs i s m ixed , RECs 
have made progress par t icu lar ly in the area o f marke t integration, infrastructure coopera t ion and sharing o f 
common resources. 

Increased in trareg iona l trade and improvements in in terna t iona l competitiveness are key common objectives 
among A fr ica ’s in tegra t ion arrangements. In ECOWAS , f o r instance, countries n o t members o f the Wes t A f r i c a n 
Econom ic and Mone tary U n i o n (WAEMU) have decided to imp lemen t W A E M U ’ s ex terna l t a r i f f structure b y 
2007 w i t h the ob jec t ive o f establishing a single reg iona l market. In Central A f r ica , a free trade zone l i n k i n g 11 
countries, inc lud ing members o f C E M A C (Central A f r i c a n Econom ic and Mone tary Commun i ty) , has recen t ly 
come in to effect. In East A fr ica , the E A C has established a customs u n i o n in 2005, COMESA , w h i c h created an 
FTA in 2000, intends to create a customs u n i o n in 2008 and S ADC in 2010. The Souther A f r i c a Customs U n i o n 
(SACU) has been renegotiated and the new S A C U Agreement intends to deepen and broaden the customs un ion . 
A l l RECs also are imp lemen t ing trade fac i l i ta t ing measures, no tab ly in the area o f transport. In t raREC 
cooperation i s increasingly tak ing place, e.g. be tween COMESA , S ADC and the E A C to harmon ize trade and 
trade-related regimes. 

Progress in imp lemen t ing and mon i to r ing macroeconomic convergence cr i ter ia i s mo re advanced under currency 
unions, wh ich tend to have a stronger m o t i v a t i o n and ins t i tu t iona l framework f o r p romo t ing convergence, e.g. 
through a common central bank. However , even in these cases a number o f the convergence c r i te r ia are n o t b e i n g 
observed b y the member countries, f o r example in b o t h WAEMU and C EM AC . In reg iona l arrangements w i thou t 
currency unions, such as COMESA , S ADC and the E A C , convergence cr i ter ia are rather loose ly defined, at this 
stage. In general, d i f fe r ing economic structures and performance among members o f subregional groups as w e l l 
as 
the lack o f e f fec t ive ins t i tu t iona l surveillance mechanisms he lp to exp la in the l im i t e d progress o n 
macroeconomic convergence. 

Reg iona l cooperation in infrastructure and other areas o f development can be i l lus tra ted b y the case o f S A D C 
whose early program o f ac t ion focused on transport and communications, agriculture, energy, and human 
development. S im i la r approaches are found in other subregional arrangements, inc lud ing e f fo r ts to harmon ize 
business and regu la tory practices fo r larger markets to attract investment. Cooperation in the area o f in fras truc ture 
i s w e l l i l lus tra ted b y RECs’ endeavours to bene f i t f r om scale economies and m i n im i z e energy cost th rough 
sharing energy across across countries. S A D C has been a pioneer, w i t h 12 members crea t ing the Southern A f r i c a n 
Power P o o l in August 1995 . In ECOW A S the connections between B e n i n and N i g e r i a and among Ben in , CBte 
d ’ Ivo ire , Ghana, and Togo are the mos t impor tan t l i n k s o f the Wes t A f r i c a n Power Poo l . Power Poo ls have also 
been established in Central A f r i c a (2003); and Eastern A f r i c a (2005). 

Coopera t ion o n shared water resources takes place through water r i v e r basin mechanisms and in i t ia t ives such as

Proliferation and overlapping membership: the numbe r o f REC s and other 

reg iona l bodies on the con t inen t has been steadily g row ing , w i t h m a n y countries 
members o f multiple arrangements. E v e n though some RECs (such as E C O W A S 
and UEMOA) have taken s ign i f ican t steps towa rd ra t iona l iza t ion , the issue

remains by and la rge unaddressed, resu l t ing in a comp lex web o f reg iona l 
organizations o f which, o n l y eight are o f f i c i a l l y recogn ized by t h e AU’ (seefigure 
A2.1 and table A2.1 f o r depiction of the “spaghetti bow l ” and description of SSA 
RECs and regional bodies). Such m u l t i p l i c i t y has several drawbacks, inc lud ing : 
fragmented markets and approaches 
t o reg iona l 
integration; 
inconsistent 
objectives and con f l ic t ing operational mandates; con t rad ic to ry ob l iga t ions and 
loya l t ies f o r member countries; increased f inanc ia l cost o f coun t ry membership; 
dup l ica t ion o f programs and efforts; unhea l thy r i v a l r y f o r donor funds; and 
consequently reduced a b i l i t y to pursue coherent and e f fec t ive 
in teg ra t ion 
programs. 
Limited capacity and inadequate funding: the RECs’ a b i l i t y t o p l a y a lead - ro le in 
successful reg iona l cooperation and in teg ra t ion are o f ten limited by inadequate 
mandates, capabilities, insu f f ic ien t and unp red ic tab le funding, p o o r remune ra t ion 
f o r staff members ( resu l t ing in high tu rnove r and extended vacancies), and weak 
capacity in general. In many cases, member countries have expanded the mandate 
o f the reg iona l economic commun i t ies w i t h o u t a commensurate increase in 

funding 
Lack of supranational authority and slow/inadequate implementation of agreed 
plans. A numbe r o f RECs have been unab le t o fu l ly imp lemen t in teg ra t ion 
programs o n a t im e l y basis. De lays p a r t l y re f lec t the l a c k enforcement authority, 
as sanctions are ra re ly app l ied t o countries in b reach o f c omm o n agreements. This 
has opened a substantial gap between the stated aspirations o f membe r countries 
as expressed in t h e treaties and p ro toco ls c rea t ing the reg iona l economic 
communities, and the r e a l i t y o n the ground. T h e poo r and limited t rans la t ion o f 
reg iona l goals i n t o na t iona l plans and budgets and inadequate imp lemen ta t ion o f 
reg iona l programs at the na t iona l l e v e l also can be exp la ined by a general 
reluctance o f countries t o cede the i r na t iona l powe rs t o the reg iona l authorities. 
L o w popular participation in the Regional Integration debate and agenda: 
dialogue o n 
in teg ra t ion

typ ica l ly dom ina ted by governments and 
intergovernmental organizations. As a result, the ins t i tu t ions and consu l ta t ion

As of, February 1, 2008 the A f r i c a Reg iona l In teg ra t ion P o r t f o l i o contains 3 1 IDA and

approved in F Y 0 7 w i t h a to ta l comm i tmen t o f US$730 m i l l i o n , exceeding p ipe l ine projections. 
So far in FY08 (by February 1, 2008), three projects have been approved w i th a comm i tmen t o f 
US$326 m i l l i o n , thereby v i r t u a l l y exhausting the IDA Reg iona l P i l o t funding envelope almost a

and owne rsh ip issues ea r ly in the preparation process. A l t h o u g h t h i s lesson i s

Partnerships are k e y t o the success o f reg iona l projects. Other donors and partners 
are needed n o t o n l y f o r co f inanc ing but also f o r imp lemen ta t ion support. F o r 
example, UNAIDS3 and U N H C R 4 have p layed c r i t i c a l f inanc ing , techn ica l

UN F o o d and Agriculture O rgan iza t ion (FAO ) f o r essential coo rd ina t ion ,

trade fac i l i ta t ion projects developed by the Bank . The B a n k and ADB have also

Bank has collaborated we l l with the European Comm iss ion and b i la te ra l donors, 
inc lud ing DfID, Finland, France, GTZ, No rway , Sweden, and U S A I D , t o ensure 
that each donor’s comparative advantage i s leveraged f o r spec i f ic in i t ia t ives o r

ins t i tu t ions and t o m a x im i z e na t iona l ownership. 

Procurement i s s u e s are t h e most common ly men t ioned barriers t o successful 
imp lemen ta t ion and o f ten con t r ibu te t o effectiveness delays. T h e y include (i)

(i) m u l t i p l i c i t y o f systems and (ii) d i v i s i o n o f respons ib i l i ty . T h e need t o

the social stigma associated with HIV/AIDS in many c l ien t countries mean that

Limitations of 
IDA fund ing f o r regional organizations, supranational 
components and capacity building efforts. Few reg iona l organizations 

qua l i fy t o b o r r ow f r o m IDA. I D A 1 4 guidelines also do n o t a l l ow gran ts t o

These restrictions limit the Bank’s a b i l i t y t o p rov ide c r i t ica l capacity

although the amounts available under these programs a re insu f f ic ien t . 

Diversity of Bank borrowing status. D i f fe rences in Bank Bo r rowe r status

TO SUBREGIONAL INTEGRATION IN AFRICA 

Overview 

1. 
This appendix summarizes t h e ensemble o f analyses, reviews, and p roposed f ramewo rks 
undertaken between 1998 and 2006 t o l a y ou t t h e W o r l d Bank ’s approach t o subregional 
in teg ra t ion in Eastern A f r ica , West A f r ica , Cen t ra l A f r ica , and Southern A f r ica . I t also iden t i f ies 
their k e y commonalities and specificities t o d raw ou t their imp l ica t ion s f o r deve lop ing and 
operationalizing a comprehensive reg iona l in teg ra t ion strategy f o r Sub-Saharan A f r i c a (SSA). 
W h i l e t h e case f o r in teg ra t ion remains equa l ly strong in a l l fou r subregions, the p o l i t i c a l impetus, 
geographical and h is to r ica l circumstances, strategic approach, ins t i tu t iona l capacity, and progress 
t o date have varied considerably f r o m one subregion t o the next. The Bank’s mandate t o support 
reg iona l in teg ra t ion in A f r i c a has been strengthened by recent developments. Consequently, a 
stock-taking o f these experiences shou ld draw lessons learned , reassess p r io r i t ies and 
opportunities, and define n e x t steps t o i n f o r m current discussion o f a coherent and coordinated 
approach t o reg iona l in teg ra t ion in t h e continent. 

2. 
There have been a numbe r o f strategy documents o n reg iona l in teg ra t ion and coope ra t ion 
in A f r ica . This summary i s based m a i n l y o n f o u r subregional papers:

The objectives and methodologies o f these subregional papers differed, re f lec t ing the 
varying extent o f Bank support and invo lvemen t in reg iona l in teg ra t ion at d i f fe ren t times. F o r 
Cen t ra l and Wes te rn A f r ica , strategies approved by t h e B o a r d in 2003 and 2001, respectively, 
were f o l l ow e d up w i t h subregional in teg ra t ion assistance strategies (subRIASs) in 2006. F o r 
Southern A f r i ca , a strategy presented t o the B o a r d as early as 1998 p r o v i d e d the basis f o r a 
comprehensive analysis t o undergird a n ope ra t iona l strategy f o r t h e sub reg ion n o w unde r 
discussion. F o r Eastern A f r ica , an i n i t i a l subR IAS was prepared in June 2006 t o l a y ou t the 
Bank’s strategic approach t o strengthen support f o r in teg ra t ion and i d e n t i f y spec i f ic areas f o r 
support. Acco rd ing ly , the range o f factors and trends analyzed by the i n d i v i d u a l strategic pieces, 
as w e l l as t h e processes o f dialogue and consu l ta t ion that i n f o rm e d them, also d i f fe red .

In p r o v i d i n g a schematic ove rv iew o f the papers (see Tab le A 4 . 1 “Coverage o f W o r l d 
Bank SubRIASs in Africa”), this summary inev i tab ly foreshortens considerable analysis and 
detail. This approach was chosen n o t t o dismiss the relevance o f the individual papers’ 
particularities no r t o validate a pa r t icu la r me thodo logy at the others’ expense, but rather to distill 

86 

the m a i n elements o f each paper according t o comparable ana ly t ica l frameworks. The focus o n

nex t steps w o u l d i n f o r m the Bank’s e f fo r t t o scale up i t s support f o r reg iona l in teg ra t ion in a 
significant, systematic way, and fac i l i ta te p rac t ica l imp lemen ta t ion and m o n i t o r i n g o f agreed 
actions.

The summary also should ind ica te the extent o f strategic re f lec t ion , consultation, and 
even innova t ion that have p romp ted the current e f f o r t t o p r o v i d e an ove ra rch ing strategy f o r 
scaling up B a n k support f o r reg iona l in teg ra t ion in A f r ica . In retrospect, these earlier e f fo r ts 
constituted an i n i t i a l due d i l igence process and p rov ided a baseline o f data and experience t o 
build on. W h i l e updates, revisions, and fu r the r analysis m a y b e needed in some areas, Bank 
assistance f o r in teg ra t ion and cooperation in a l l f o u r subregions i s grounded in a rev iew o f f i v e 
areas. These are ex is t ing mechanisms, processes, and ins t i tu t ions t o p romo te in teg ra t ion and 
cooperation; analysis o f economic and development trends; assessment o f sectoral issues; 
surveys o f ana ly t ica l w o r k and investment operations t o date; and iden t i f ica t ion o f c r i t ica l gaps 
and opportunities. 

K e y Commonalities and Specificities 

6. 

W h i l e b road ly s im i la r in t h r u s t , variations in rationale, objectives, and p r io r i t ies ; guiding 
principles; and me thodo logy emerge f r o m rev iews o f the Bank’s strategic approaches t o 
in teg ra t ion and cooperation in Eastern, Central, Western, and Southern A f r i c a . W h i l e these 
differences stem f o r the mos t part f r o m spec i f ic cond i t ions in each subregion, acknow ledg ing o r 
addressing them e x p l i c i t l y shou ld p r o v i d e a mo re systematic and de ta i led assessment o f 
in teg ra t ion and cooperation issues across the region, and o f the i r imp l ica t ions f o r an ove ra rch ing 
reg iona l strategy. 

7 . 

Rationale. N o t surprisingly, the ra t iona le across the subregions f o r strengthening 
in teg ra t ion and cooperation rests o n the po ten t ia l f o r spurring growth-and 
thereby suppo r t ing 
pove r ty reduction-through gains in trade, p r iva te sector development, and economies o f scale in 
infrastructure and services. I t also rests o n the inc reas ing ly urgent need t o strengthen 
management o f common goods-such as water resources, forestry, and biodiversity-and 
i l l s - 
such as communicable diseases. This ove ra rch ing ra t iona le i s c lose ly a l igned with international, 
regional, and subregional agendas that c a l l f o r greater in teg ra t ion and coope ra t ion in A f r i c a ( f o r 
example, NEPAD and AAP). Howeve r , there are differences in emphasis and appreciation in the 
Bank’s approach to each subregion: 

e 

The degree of 
integration supported by the Bank varies by subregion. In Eas t 
A f r ica , in w h i c h the E A C Customs U n i o n has been launched, e f fo r ts focus o n 
l ibe ra l i z ing the f l o w o f goods and services. In Cen t ra l and West A f r ica , in w h i c h 
each subregion has a customs u n i o n as we l l as a mone ta ry union, add i t iona l 
objectives are economic in teg ra t ion and/or convergence and f inanc ia l sector 
reforms. 
In Southern A f r ica , mu l t ip le , ove r lapp ing 
reg iona l 
in teg ra t ion 
arrangements (RIAs) are nevertheless less developed, and the SADC agenda i s 
e x p l i c i t l y driven by development (rather than by growth-oriented) objectives. In 
t h i s subregion, the scope f o r fo rma l in teg ra t ion at any l e v e l i s mo re l im i ted - 
although the scope f o r deep in teg ra t ion i s large, as i t s economies are r e l a t i v e l y

subregions but does n o t seem t o be a s t rong focus f o r any o f RIAS. 
Different trade-related risks are highlighted f rom one subregion to the next. 
W h i l e the po ten t ia l g r ow t h f r o m trade i s acknowledged as a p ow e r f u l ra t iona le f o r 
integration, the po ten t ia l risks are n o t analyzed systematically across the 
subregions. These inc lude r i s k s w i t h respect t o benefits d is t r ibu t ion , b r i e f l y 
highlighted in the Bank’s strategic approach t o in teg ra t ion in Eas t A f r ica ; 
geographic po la r iza t ion o f economic activities, considered in Wes t and Southern 
A f r i c a (due t o the econom ic dominance o f CBte d’Ivoire, N ige r ia , and Sou th 
A f r ica ) ; and trade d ive rs ion by reg iona l b locs versus globalization, also 
considered in deve lop ing the Bank’s approach t o subregional in teg ra t ion in Wes t 
A f r ica . 
While the Bank’s approach in each subregion is closely aligned w i t h the agendas 
the main coordinating bodies, the Bank’s scope for supporting integration i s 
limited by po l i t ica l and other constraints specific to each subregion. T h e weak 
f inanc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f these bodies as w e l l as p o o r reg iona l 
infrastructure are c omm o n t o a l l fou r subregions. A d d i t i o n a l constraints inc lude 
con f l ic ts and na tu ra l disasters/emergencies in West A f r ica , t h e recent w i n d f a l l s 
f r o m o i l revenues in Cen t ra l A f r ica , and the imbalance in trade f l ow s be tween 
Sou th A f r i c a and i t s neighbors. L a c k o f p o l i t i c a l leadership o r comm i tmen t t o 
in teg ra t ion and cooperation has been i d e n t i f i e d as c r i t ica l . I t remains t o be seen 
whether t h e Bank’s p roposed interventions-with 
the i r emphasis o n dialogue, 
ana ly t ica l wo rk , and capac i ty building-are 
su f f ic ien t ly robus t t o build such 
commitment.

Objectives and p r io r i t ies . Consequently, the m a i n areas f o r support are b road ly similar 
across subregions-trade, 
transport, telecommunications, energy, r i v e r bas in management, and 
capacity building. Howeve r , the specific strategic objectives and sectoral p r io r i t ies vary. 

9 . 

In East A f r ica , subregional trade i s h i g h l y concentrated in a number o f ag r icu l tu ra l and 
value-added goods, as w e l l as services. Thus, e f fo r ts are focused o n increasing ma rke t 
transparency and reduc ing costs; in teg ra t ing ag r icu l tu ra l markets; and building economies o f 
scale in transport, telecommunications, energy, tourism, and higher education services. 

10. 

B y contrast, there i s l o w comp lemen ta r i ty among the economies o f Southern A f r ica , 
limiting the scope f o r merchandise trade, and s ign i f ican t m isma t ch between demand and supply 
f o r strategic na tu ra l resources such as wa te r and energy. T h e subregion also has the h ighes t

development and economic growth. Hen ce evo lved the B a&’ s emphasis o n strengthening

infrastructure projects t o increase water storage capacity. No tab ly , H I V / A I D S p reven t ion e f fo r ts 
are mainstreamed i n t o road transport projects. 

11. Guiding principles. W h i l e t h e Bank’s approach t o in teg ra t ion and cooperation in each 
subregion i s e x p l i c i t l y guided by the p r inc ip les o f open reg iona l ism and subsidiarity, as w e l l as 
im p l i c i t add i t iona l criteria, i t i s unclear h o w consistently these p r inc ip les have been app l ied 

8 8 

across subregions. Besides open reg iona l ism and subsidiarity, add i t iona l c r i te r ia f o r Bank 
support have b e e n applied in one o r m o r e o f the fou r subregions, a l though these have n o t always 
been articulated exp l ic i t ly . These c r i te r ia inc lude :

e x p l i c i t guiding p r i n c i p l e o f the 
Bank’s approach t o in teg ra t ion and cooperation in Cen t ra l A f r ica . 

12. 
Because B a n k support has rema ined anchored in i n d i v i d u a l CASs and coun t r y programs, 
and these as w e l l as imp lemen ta t ion experiences are uneven ly rev iewed in the i n d i v i d u a l 
subregional strategic pieces, the relevance and effectiveness o f these p r inc ip les i s d i f f i c u l t t o 
assess. 

13 . Methodology. As a r e v i ew o f separate e f fo r ts t o develop a strategic approach t o 
in teg ra t ion and cooperation in each subregion shows, Bank assistance has been grounded in f i v e 
reviews. These comprise reviews o f ex is t ing mechanisms, processes, and ins t i tu t ions t o p romo te 
in teg ra t ion and cooperation; analyses o f economic and development trends; assessments o f 
sectoral issues ; surveys o f ana ly t ica l w o r k and investment operations t o date; and i d e n t i f i c a t i o n 
o f c r i t ica l gaps and opportunities. 

14. 

Howeve r , there i s some unevenness in f o u r areas: 

e

The extent o f dialogue and consultation undertaken in each sub reg ion varies 
considerably. The Cen t ra l and West A f r i c a subRIASs appear t o have bene f i ted 
f r o m the mos t in te rac t ion w i th external stakeholders. N o f o rm a l consultations 
appear to have been organized in any o f the subregions. 
N o t a l l o f the strategic pieces inc lude a comprehensive rev iew o f implementation 
experience o r d raw clear lessons lea rned that might be applicable across the 
subregions. W h i l e specific 
issues encountered in individual ac t iv i t ies are 
identified, broader lessons do n o t always emerge c lea r ly . 
W h i l e the re i s a clear emphasis o n the need f o r fu r the r ana ly t ica l w o r k in a l l f o u r 
subregions, discussion o f p lanned lending operations i s l e s s developed.

Bona f i d e regional issue and subsidiarity. Proposed in te rven t ions shou ld address 
genu ine ly regional issues, rather than issues that are me re ly s im i la r f o r several 
countries. Such issues w o u l d necessarily have t o be addressed at a regional, as 
opposed t o t h e national, level-thereby 
adhering t o the p r inc ip le o f subsidiarity. 
H i g h impact and sustainability. T h e impac t o f proposed in te rven t ions shou ld b e 
sustainable and exceed the high transaction costs associated w i th p ro je c t 
preparation and nego t ia t ion across borders and be tween na t iona l and 
supranational bodies. 
Strong commitment by a l l countries. Projects shou ld have s t rong na t iona l and 
supranational comm i tmen t , as re f lec ted by p r io r i t ies in na t iona l and reg iona l 
development strategies as w e l l as e x p l i c i t endorsement by the re levan t bodies o f 
the roles and responsibilities de f ined f o r each. 

Capacity to execute implementation arrangements. T o ensure sustainability, 

projects shou ld take i n t o account capacity constraints b o t h at the E A C Secretariat 
l e v e l and in the imp lemen ta t ion bodies within the countries, and p r o v i d e f o r an 
exp l ic i t dec is ion -mak ing arrangement t o avo id delays. P r i o r i t y shou ld b e g i v e n t o 
programs that reg iona l bodies, either existing o r created ad hoc, have an e x p l i c i t 
mandate t o imp lemen t . 
Emerging partnerships among donors. T h e la rge vo lume o f funds t y p i c a l l y

in te rven t ions ’ effectiveness shou ld be mon i to red at b o t h the a c t i v i t y and t h e aggregated reg iona l 
assistance p rog ram levels. De ta i led indicators shou ld be defined according t o the ac t iv i t ies 
(investment operations, TA, capacity building, ana ly t ica l work). Benchmarking and ta rge t ing

Spec i f ica l ly , the subRIAS identified k e y domains f o r assistance t o reg iona l in teg ra t ion 
and cooperation, and core, noncore, and contingent ac t iv i t ies (Tab le A4.5). P r i o r i t y areas f o r the 
doma in o f reg iona l in teg ra t ion were considered t o be macroeconomic po l ic ies , trade po l ic ies , 
f inanc ia l sector integration, and the business environment, whereas the rema in ing ac t iv i t ie s 
(infrastructure services, forestry/water, human resources) were h e l d t o b e in the d om a i n o f

The subR IAS proposed an envelope o f US$140 m i l l i o n i n c l u d i n g 1 in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec t

In 2006 a f o l l ow - u p repo r t (“Regional In teg ra t ion and Coope ra t ion in Cen t ra l A f r ica ” )

The report also proposed recommendations o n h o w the B a n k strategy might b e rev ised g o i n g 
fo rwa rd , as regards themes t o b e addressed, p r inc ip les gove rn ing B a n k interventions, and 
ins t i tu t iona l arrangements. 

28. 

On the whole, the report found that the Bank’s strategy remains relevant. Nevertheless, 
the large o i l windfalls suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on the careful management 
of 
these resources and their productive use f o r generating economic g row th w i th in CEMAC. 
C EM AC ’ s emphases have been and rema in reduc ing the barriers t o the movemen t o f goods and 
services th rough making t h e customs u n i o n effective, en fo r c ing mac roeconom ic p o l i c y 
convergence, pursuing f inanc ia l sector integration, and p romo t ing cooperation o n sector po l ic ies 
and projects. These emphases r em a i n impo r tan t t o l ow e r transaction costs f o r p r iva te sector 
business development. Howeve r , the la rge i n f l ow s o f o i l revenues t o the sub reg ion in recent 
years and the ensuing v o l a t i l i t y requ i re proper macroeconomic and mone ta ry management and 
development f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion mechanisms t o channel these resources t o p roduc t ive 
investments. 

29 . 

The 2006 repo r t also assessed the degree t o w h i c h the re levan t CAS s support t h e 
in teg ra t ion agenda in the subregion. I t found tha t the pace of 
implementation of the subRIAS has 
been slow and uneven f o r a variety of reasons, i n c l u d i n g “back-loading” 
the strategy ( w i t h the 
bulk o f operations envisaged f o r the la t te r f isca l years). Other reasons were un funded mandates 
f o r k e y pieces o f ana ly t ica l and operational w o r k and t h e lack o f lend ing instruments t o deal with 
a weak reg iona l partner (the C E M A C Secretariat). There h a d not been significant progress on 
the central activities of 
the CEMAC agenda: macroeconomic management, trade and transport 
facilitation, and f inanc ia l sector integration. As o f 2006, none o f the projects inc luded in RIAS 
h a d been approved by IDA. 

30. 
Nevertheless, C E M A C has made modest progress o n a b r o a d number o f f ron ts : ana ly t ica l 
w o r k o n transit fac i l i ta t ion , a reg iona l f inanc ia l sector assessment, a p ro jec t t o im p r o v e t h e

32. 
In light o f the detailed rev iew o f the subRIAS, i d e n t i f y i n g p r i o r i t y areas f o r support i s 
c r i t ica l t o rega in ing momen tum in imp lemen t ing the Bank ’s strategy. E q u a l l y c r i t i c a l are 
addressing t h e funding, commitment, and p rocedu ra l issues tha t have hobb led progress t o date. 
These issues are u rgen t because there are s ign i f ican t oppo r tun i t ies f o r sca l ing up assistance in the 
com ing years. T o e f fec t ive l y support reg iona l in teg ra t ion and cooperation m o v i n g fo rwa rd , B a n k 
activities shou ld focus o n s ix k e y areas: 

1.

5 . 

F i rs t p r io r i ty : Strengthen the core CEMAC institutions. T h e A f r i c a A c t i o n P l a n 
emphasizes strengthening reg iona l integration, and recogn i t ion i s g r ow i n g tha t the 
s low pace o f capacity development remains a binding constraint t o pove r ty 
reduction. Consequently, the Bank’s w o r k needs t o focus o n the development o f 
capacity in C EM AC ’ s ins t i tu t ions by addressing the institutional and f inanc ia l 
weakness of 
the CEMAC Secretariat head on. T h e envisaged US $ 3 0 m i l l i o n 
C E M A C Reg iona l F inanc ia l Ins t i tu t ions Suppo r t p ro jec t w i l l b e v i t a l in this 
regard. 

Second p r io r i ty : Improve the level of 
the macroeconomic dialogue and policy 
advice regarding the management and use of o i l reserves. Together w i t h the IMF, 
the Bank can advise B E A C o n the management o f o i l resources, and t h e possible 
investment o f these resources in higher y i e l d i n g securities o r fu tu re generation 
funds that w o u l d finance econom ica l ly p ro f i tab le investments within C E M A C . In 
parallel, B a n k advice and projects w i l l be needed in the f inanc ia l sector t o h e l p 
e f fec t ive l y manage t h e s e w ind fa l ls and strengthen f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion . 

T h i r d p r io r i ty : Increase the Bank’s wo rk on regional infrastructure-especially 
transport and telecommunications-the most important component of the o r ig ina l 
strategy. As was envisioned, US$100 m i l l i o n i s be ing back - loaded t o 2007 and 
2008 t o he lp finance road projects t o build the k e y rema in ing segments o f the 
Cen t ra l A f r i c a n r o a d ne two rk that l i n k s a l l the Cen t ra l A f r i c a n capitals. In 
parallel, IDA support f o r strengthening the regu la to ry f ramewo r k f o r air transport 
c o u l d imp rove the in f ras t ruc tu ra l foundations f o r the subregion. 

Fou r th p r io r i ty : T h e Bank should fac i l i ta te trade policy and transit. U n d e r t h e 
Bank’s Reg iona l T rade and Transport F a c i l i t a t i o n Project, there c o u l d b e a r e f o rm 
o f some o f the cumbersome customs and t r a n s i t procedures tha t have made the 
costs o f do ing business in the subregion some o f the h ighes t in the wo r ld . 
Mo reove r , the Bank can help prepare the C E M A C countries in the i r negotiations 
o n the EPAs w i t h the European U n i o n by conduc t ing ana ly t ica l w o r k o n the f isca l 
imp l ica t ions o f the trade l ibe ra l iza t ion . 

F i f th area: Bank could wo rk on business environment, especially f o r p r iva te 
sector development. This isue i s n o t as impo r tan t as the other issues , and the B a n k 
m a y n o t have the resources o r a comparative advantage. Nevertheless, t w o areas 
in w h i c h the Bank c o u l d be pa r t icu la r ly e f fec t ive at the reg iona l l e v e l w o u l d b e t o 
advise o n competitiveness i s s u e s and o n the legau jud ic ia l f ramewo rk , as w e l l as 

99

the accounting f ramewo rk , f o r conduc t ing business. This area also i s impo r tan t t o 
t h e f inanc ia l sector, in w h i c h lega l and j u d i c i a l f ramewo rks f o r f inanc ia l contracts 
and t h e i r enforcement need t o b e imp roved . 
F ina l ly , if i t has resources and the instruments, the Bank can play a ro le in 
helping CEMAC countries j o i n t l y address issues pertaining t o pub l ic goods and 
cross-border externalities through enhanced regional cooperation. Nume rous 
cross-border challenges can b e e f fec t ive ly addressed o n l y at the reg iona l leve l , 
especially reg iona l env i ronmen ta l problems. Examples are the shrinkage o f L a k e 
Chad, poo r nav igab i l i ty a long the Congo R ive r , and d i f f i c u l t i e s in fo res t ry 
management. S im i la r ly , with rega rd t o H I V A I D S , cooperation can h e l p c o n t r o l i t s 
spread a long the c r i t i c a l transit corridors. 

3 3 . 

Scaling up support in these areas w i l l need to be undertaken in co l labo ra t ion w i t h other 
donors, notably the EU and the ADB. Scaling up w i l l be successful only if there is an equivalent 
increase in commitment to enhance integration and cooperation on the p a r t of 
the highest level 
of CEMAC. Moreover, security is a sine qua n o n to improved economic pe$ormance. A rev ised 
o r relaunched subR IAS should b e i n f o rm e d b y a tho rough analysis o f this issue.

In addition, an assessment o f t h e f isca l and economic impac t o f the reg iona l EPAs

Background, Rationale, and Objectives 

37. 

The W o r l d Bank’s Execu t ive B o a r d in 2001 approved a subR IAS f o r Wes t A f r i c a a imed 
at creating open reg iona l markets t o reduce risks and transaction costs f o r private-sector 
activities, as w e l l as 
fac i l i ta t ing reg iona l cooperation o n cross-border 
issues such as 
commun icab le diseases and env i ronmen ta l resources. T h e subRIAS was guided by the principles 

106 

of subsidiarity, private-sector primacy, pragmatism and progressivity, and partnership w i th 
other donors. T h e strategy was based on the premise that improving the competitiveness of 
the 
small and fragmented West African economies is essential to enable them to pa r t ic ipa te more 
successfully in globalization. This took account o f the debate on the effectiveness o f trade b locs 
in the context o f globalization. I t did n o t deny the poss ib i l i ty o f some trade d ive r s ion during 
ma rke t integration. Howeve r , deeper factor and infrastructure ma rke t in teg ra t ion we re expected 
t o s ign i f ican t ly reduce costs, thus making countries m o r e compe t i t ive in the g loba l economy, 
w h i c h in turn w o u l d spur g loba l trade, investment, and expo r t - led g row th . T h e risk o f geographic 
po la r iza t ion o f economic activities was expected t o occur w i th o r w i t h o u t integration. Howeve r , 
i ts extent and the consequences were thought t o be m o r e manageable within the ins t i tu t iona l 
f ramewo rk and f inanc ia l safeguards o f fe red by increased in teg ra t ion . 

38 . 

F ina l ly , i t was expected that sound macroeconomic po l ic ies th rough a convergence 
mechanism w o u l d imp rove the f ramewo r k f o r p r iva te investment. Hence came the case f o r 
in teg ra t ion in Wes t A f r ica :

The economies o f the subregion need t o become more competitive and capable o f 
pa r t ic ipa t ing in g loba l iza t ion . Reg iona l in teg ra t ion can p r o v i d e economies o f 
scale and increased compe t i t ion in a larger and open subregional space. This 
reg iona l in teg ra t ion can be achieved by in teg ra t ing goods and factors markets, 
inc lud ing nontrade activities, such as in f ras t ruc tu re services. 
I t i s essential f o r the subregion t o become more attractive to p r iva te investors 
th rough a m o r e open p o l i c y that i s consistently app l ied and credible. Reg iona l 
in teg ra t ion can he lp achieve this by p r o v i d i n g j o i n t comm i tmen ts ac t ing as l o c k - i n 
mechanisms and restraints against unsound and inconsistent po l ic ies . Such 
commitments w o u l d imp rove macroeconomic convergence and s tab i l i ty and 
strengthen na t iona l l ibe ra l iza t ion programs. 
I t i s impo r tan t t o deal mo re e f fec t ive ly and humane ly w i th labor m ig ra t ion issues. 
B y fac i l i ta t ing popu la t ion movements across the subregion, reg iona l in teg ra t ion 
w o u l d p rov ide the f ramewo rk f o r deve lop ing a mo re e f fec t ive supply o f labo r in

Reg iona l in teg ra t ion m a y he lp deal mo re e f fec t ive ly with c omm o n causes and 
cross-border issues, such as shared resources and secu r i ty and health, and t o 
increase ba rga in ing powe r in w o r l d fora. Reg iona l in teg ra t ion can p rov ide the 
f ramewo rk 
f o r dea l ing w i t h pos i t ive (such as conservation,

management) and negative (such as commun icab le diseases, con f l ic ts ) cross- 
border externalities. 

39. 

Despite the clear case f o r in teg ra t ion in the subregion, i t was fu l ly expected that there 
w o u l d be d i f f icu l t ies in s tee r ing in teg ra t ion fo rwa rd f o r three reasons. T h e y are t h e (1) high 
fragmentation o f the subregion (box A5.2), (2) large numbe r o f countries, and (3) l a c k o f a rea l 
economic magnet with su f f ic ien t resources, leadership, and mo t iva t ion . Since the reg iona l 
ma rke t w o u l d rema in too sma l l t o o f fe r a strong stimulus t o increase p r o d u c t i v i t y and 

107 

diversification, the subRIAS emphasized the need f o r the subregion t o re in fo rce i t s po l ic ies o f 
openness t o the rest o f the wo r ld . 

Box A5.2: West African Subregion 

West A f r i c a i s h i g h l y fragmented as a result o f geographic, demographic, and h is tor ica l reasons. I t s popu la t ion o f 
approximately 250 m i l l i o n inhabitants in 2003 i s h i g h l y unevenly d is tr ibu ted among countries. N i g e r i a contains 
over h a l f o f the total, whereas 3 countries (Cape Verde, the Gambia, and Guinea Bissau) have 1.5 m i l l i o n or fewer 
inhabitants. Popu la t ion density i s low , except in the urban ized areas a long the A t lan t ic coast. In te rna l distances are 
enormous, and transport infrastructure i s deficient. Na t iona l markets are t iny , and reg iona l markets are under- 
developed. As a result, infrastructure costs are among the highest in the world, w h i c h translates i n t o an especially 
h i g h cost o f d o i n g business in the subregion. 

The subregion i s among the poorest in the wor ld . In 2003 the 15 countries o f the subregion had a comb ined GDP o f 
approximately US$109 b i l l i o n and a GNP o f approximately US$89 b i l l ion , equivalent to Malaysia's, w h i c h had 10 
times fewer inhabitants ( G N I o f US$93.4 b i l l i o n f o r a popu la t ion o f 24.3 m i l l i o n inhabitants). The comb ined GDP 
o f 4 countries o f the 15 (CBte d ' Ivo ire , Ghana, N ige r ia , and Senegal) represented approx ima te ly 80% o f the to ta l 
GDP o f the subregion (Table A4.6). 

Approx ima te ly 60% o f the popu la t ion l ives o n less than $ 1 per day. L i f e expectancy i s 46 years, and 1 11 in fan ts 
out o f 1000 births d ie before their f i r s t b ir thday . There i s a h i g h d ivers i ty in these indicators. Sierra Leone i s at the 
lowe r end w i t h a l i f e expectancy at birth o f 37 years and an in fan t mo r ta l i ty rate o f 166 per thousand. Cape Ve rde i s 
at the h igher end o f the spectrum w i t h a l i f e expectancy at birth o f 69 years and an in fan t mo r ta l i ty rate o f 26 per 
thousand. The overa l l i l l i te racy rate i s 42%. The subregion has been severely affected b y in terna l con f l ic ts , w h i c h 
had sp i l l-over effects o n ne ighbor ing countries. Three countries are emerging f r om c i v i l war (Guinea-Bissau, 
L iber ia , and Sierra Leone), and three countries have had an unsettled p o l i t i c a l s i tua t ion (CBte d I v o i r e , Guinea, and 
Togo) over several years. 

!O . 

The subRIAS consequently proposed a w o r k p rog ram focused o n the c rea t ion o f an open, 
u n i f i e d reg iona l economic space (OURES), w h i c h was t o absorb 90 percent o f the resources. T h e 
central c r i te r ion f o r dec id ing Bank assistance, b o t h ana ly t ica l and financial, was the extent t o 
w h i c h such assistance w o u l d contribute t o t h e OURES . The w o r k p rog ram f o r FY2002 -04 
allocated 100 percent o f IDA lending t o in f ras t ruc tu re and finance, and 40 percent o f the 
administrative budget t o ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (AAA) in support o f reg iona l 
in teg ra t ion ins t i tu t ions . T h i s central theme w o u l d account f o r over 90 percent o f t o t a l assistance, 
w i t h infrastructure services comp r is ing app rox ima te ly ha l f , concentrated in a i r transport and

t o trade. 

41. 
At t h e same time, in keep ing w i t h the p r inc ip le o f subsidiarity, the subR IAS emphasized 
that coun t ry - leve l assistance should r em a i n the fundamen ta l p i l l a r o f Bank assistance t o the 
subregion and t o reg iona l in teg ra t ion i tse l f . Coun t ry assistance b o t h helps strengthen ove ra l l 
coun t ry performance (an indispensable p recond i t ion ) and can b e used t o he lp countries respect 
the i r reg iona l commitments and handle add i t iona l requirements imposed by reg iona l in teg ra t ion . 
T h e subRIAS ind ica ted that B a n k assistance at coun t ry l e v e l w o u l d con t inue t o he lp countries (1) 
compensate f o r t rans i t iona l f isca l losses arising f r o m increased openness, (2) finance the na t iona l 
po r t ions o f reg iona l public-sector in f ras t ruc tu re networks, and (3) 
imp rove the i r business 
environment f o r reg ion -w ide p r iva te sector investment. Howeve r , i t was recognized that, f o r this 

108 

support t o be effective, i t w o u l d need t o be coordinated across West A f r i c a n countries and made 
coherent with the reg iona l in i t ia t ives . 

42. 
In 2006 the Boa rd approved the A f r i c a A c t i o n Plan, with recommenda t ion t o ma ins t ream 
reg iona l in teg ra t ion in the Bank ’s support programs. A f o l l ow - u p report. “Study o n Reg iona l

F o r t h e B a n k t o strategically support in teg ra t ion in West A f r ica , i t s e f fo r ts must rest on 
th ree “pillars” as ou t l ined in the subR IAS and con f i rmed in the rev iew : 

Founded in 1975, ECOWAS includes 15 countries and has b o t h an economic and a p o l i t i c a l mandate. In 2006 the 
Heads o f State supported the establishment o f a Pro jec t Deve lopmen t and Imp lemen ta t ion Unit (PDIU) in charge o f 
coord ina t ing imp lemen ta t ion o f reg iona l projects. The U E M O A was created in 1994 and includes e igh t countries, a l l 
be long ing to the C F A Franc zone. F o l l ow i n g the devaluation o f the C F A Franc in 1994, emphasis has been put o n 
sound macroeconomic management. A customs un ion was established in 2000 w i t h a common external t a r i f f (CET) . 
ECOW A S and U E M O A have re in forced their cooperation in recent years. A memorandum o f understanding was 
signed in 2004. A j o i n t secretariat i s be ing established. The donors, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank , have s trong ly 
encouraged closer cooperation between the tw o reg iona l institutions. In December 1999, the Heads o f State mee t ing 
decided that ECOW A S was to become a customs u n i o n b y genera l iz ing the U E M O A C E T to a l l member countries 
in 2002, and a monetary u n i o n b y 2003-04. B o t h deadlines have been extended. However , a C E T based on the 
U E M O A t a r i f f has been approved in p r inc ip le fo r f i n a l adop t ion by 2008, and some countries have already begun 
implementation. 
Other reg iona l institutions inc lude the Wes t A f r i c a n H e a l t h Organization, w h i c h serves as a technical unit o f the 
ECOW A S Secretariat, and the Comite‘ In ter-E ta ts de Lu t te con tre l a Se‘cheresse (CILSS). T h e latter was created in 
the wake o f the severe Sahelian drough t in the early 1970s to p o o l resources to deal w i t h a recurrent p r o b l em 
a f fec t ing several countries in West A f r ica . Others ins t i tu t ions have been created to manage a t ime-bound program o f 
activities concerning several countries, such as the onchocerciasis erad ica t ion p rog ram and the Wes t A f r i c a n Powe r 
P o o l (WAPP); or to manage spec i f ic ac t iv i t ies shared b y ne ighbor ing countries, such as the Senegal R ive r V a l l e y 
Au tho r i ty (OMVS ) or the N i g e r Bas in A u t h o r i t y ( M A ) .

Implementation Experience and Issues 

44. 
T h e m a i n challenges t o ach iev ing the objectives o f t h e subRIAS f o r Wes t A f r i c a have 
been re la ted t o imp lemen ta t ion : 

e 

e 

Macroeconomic convergence. Since the 1994 deva lua t ion o f the C F A Franc, 
U E M O A members have adopted 8 convergence criteria, o f w h i c h 4 are 
considered f i rs t -o rde r (en ta i l ing sanctions in case o f noncompliance). The la t te r 
are that (1) the basic f isca l balance shou ld be pos i t ive ; (2) the average annual 
i n f l a t i o n rate shou ld be l ow e r than 3 percent; (3) the r a t i o o f in te rna l and ex te rna l 
debt t o GDP shou ld n o t be h ighe r than 70 percent; and (4) there shou ld b e n o 
accumulation o f in te rna l o r external arrears. Howeve r , experience has shown l i t t l e 
B u r k i n a Faso, M a l i , and 
compliance w i t h these criteria. F o u r countries-Benin, 
Senegal-have me t at least fou r convergence c r i te r ia during the 1998-2003 
period. The other f o u r countries have been unable to meet mos t c r i te r ia . Because 
o f weak revenue performance, a l l member countries have h a d d i f f icu l t ies 
comp ly ing w i t h the f isca l criteria. 
Meanwh i le , five o f the n o n U E M O A members o f E C O W A S (the Gambia, Ghana, 
Guinea, N i g e r i a and Sierra Leone) have postponed plans t o create a second 
monetary zone t o Decembe r 2009. Some observers be l ieve these postponements 
are w e l l founded and tha t t h i s group o f countries i s n o t yet ready f o r a mone ta ry 
un ion . 
Open market. Progress has been made in reduc ing t a r i f f s and e l im ina t ing 
add i t iona l taxes, but even in the U E M O A zone, there are s t i l l deviations f r o m the 
CET . In Ben in , a numbe r o f levies and surcharges o n spec i f ic p roduc ts a re s t i l l in 
place. In several countries, a dec l in ing p ro tec t ion tax i s s t i l l imp lemen ted and a 
cyc l ica l im p o r t tax continues t o be l e v i e d t o g ive add i t iona l p ro tec t ion t o selected 
producers in ag r icu l tu re and agro-industries. Perhaps mos t impo r tan t ly , m a n y 
NTBs remain: 
rules o f o r i g i n that p r o h i b i t m a n y manu fac tu red goods, 
inappropriate use o f standards, adm in is t ra t ive delays and b r ibes at the border, 
u n o f f i c i a l b lockage o f f o o d exports, and, o f course, the ub iqu i tous r o a d b locks . 
As f o r the n o n U E M O A membe r countries o f E C OW A S , in 2000 they comm i t ted 
themselves t o establish a fu l l - f ledged customs u n i o n by a p p l y i n g the U E M O A 
common external tariff by January 2002. Howeve r , the d i f f i c u l t i e s h a d n o t been 
su f f ic ien t ly analyzed. As a result, agreement was n o t reached until the end o f 

112 

2005, with a t rans i t ion pe r iod lasting until January 2008. This n ew C E T w i l l b e 
ve ry difficult f o r N ige r ia , w h i c h in 2005 s t i l l h a d many bans o r p r o h i b i t i v e t a r i f f 
rates (150 percent). N i g e r i a n bans have had a nega t ive impact o n trade f r o m 
Benin, Ghana, and Sierra Leone among others. N i g e r i a has comm i t ted i t s e l f t o 
r em o v i n g t h e s e bans, but insisted o n keeping a spec ia l 50 percent t a r i f f f o r some 
products until 2008. 
Mo reove r , m u c h rema ins t o be done t o fac i l i ta te exports, such as fewer delays at 
customs, faster reimbursement o f the value-added tax (VAT), and the func t ion ing 
o f E x p o r t Processing Zones. The remova l o f in te rna l NTBs t o trade, k n o w n as the 
second l ibe ra l iza t ion agenda, also remains an e lus ive objective. 
As f o r infrastructure services f o r a unified market, experience has va r ied f r o m one 
sector t o another: 
- 
There has been s ign i f ican t progress in the energy sector, w i th the app rova l

Background and Strategic Objectives

In April 1998, a “Southern A f r i c a Strategy” paper presented t o the B o a r d la id the bas is 
f o r the Bank ’s approach t o reg iona l integration. I t argued that reg iona l coope ra t ion in Southern 
A f r i c a cou ld benefit countries in f i v e ways: (a) enhanced visibility t o investors, (b) l ow e r 
p roduc t ion and marketing costs, (c) sharing and dissemination o f development lessons and more 
rapid l ibe ra l iza t ion , (d) closer in teg ra t ion o f ag r icu l tu ra l markets, and (e) better management o f 
transboundary resources. Key focus areas f o r the Bank Group’s support were closer in teg ra t ion 
o f markets and trade fac i l i ta t ion , reg iona l in f ras t ruc tu re development, and the l ibe ra l iza t ion o f 
labo r and cap i ta l f lows . These findings and focus areas were subsequently inc luded in “Towa rd a 
Systematic App roach t o Reg iona l Integration,” presented t o the B o a r d o n April 2, 2001. Key 
lessons also were con f i rmed and re f lec ted in the “Strategic F ramewo rk f o r IDA ’S Assistance t o 
A f r ica : The Emerging Partnership M o d e l ” (W o r l d Bank Repo r t 26217) in 2003 and t h e A f r i c a 
A c t i o n Plan in 2005.

A l t h o u g h the “Southern A f r ica Strategy” paper was n o t a f o rm a l subR IAS as such, 
strategic analysis o f the challenges and opportunities f o r suppo r t ing reg iona l in teg ra t ion in the

dialogue with the foremost reg iona l in teg ra t ion organizations-SADC, 
COM E S A , and E A C . 
Based la rge ly o n spec i f ic requests, the Bank has deepened i t s support in selected areas, including 
reg iona l projects such as t h e Southern African Powe r M a r k e t (APL1) in support o f the first phase 
o f the Southern A f r i c a Powe r M a r k e t Program. These processes have been i n f o rm e d by a ser ies

Bene f i ts , pa r t icu la r ly static and dynam ic gains f r o m trade integration, are ne i the r

agenda. I t includes an exp l ic i t development orientation; market integration; trade and investment 
development, fac i l i ta t ion , and p romo t ion ; economy o f scale gains; add i t iona l i ty (that i s , ac t iv i t ies

increasing importance o f s k i l l s in the g loba l ized economy, in w h i c h know ledge - 
in tens i ty i s c ruc ia l t o enhance competitiveness. 
In terms o f economic structure, the subregion seems t o be struggling t o d i v e r s i f y 
i t s p roduc t ive base. Progressive indus t r ia l iza t ion remains e lus ive f o r mos t 
countries. Overall, economies in the region are largely undiversified, resulting in 
a lack of complementarity, which limits the scope fo r merchandise trade, except 
between South Africa and the rest of 
the region (Tables A4 .10 and A4.11). T h e 
economies are reasonably open, and g iven that mos t countries in the r e g i o n are 
heav i ly dependent o n exports o f primary and semi-processed ag r icu l tu ra l and 
m ine ra l commodities, the reg iona l economy remains excessively vu lne rab le t o

experiences have seen s ign i f ican t convergence in the b road po l ic ies tha t have 
been pursued, a l though the outcomes o f such po l ic ies and programs vary 
s ign i f ican t ly , even w i d e l y in some instances, across countries. Agreements such 
as the M u l t i l a t e r a l Mone ta ry Agreement (MMA) and S A C U are expanding 
convergence among an inner core o f countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Nam ib ia , 
South A f r ica , and Swaziland). 
South Africa’s relatively developed economy and dominance of 
the regional 
market hold risks and opportunities fo r the rest of 
the region. D u e t o i t s size and 
economic linkages w i th the rest o f the economies in Sou the rn A f r ica , Sou th 
A f r ica ’s l o w g r ow t h levels are pa r t ly exp la in ing l o w aggregate g r ow t h in

economic po la r iza t ion within the region. Sou th A f r ica , and i m p l i c i t l y SACU ,

developed countries and m o r e dynam ic markets, rather than b e i n g interested in 
South-South reg iona l cooperation w i t h ne ighbo r ing countries. lo O n the pos i t ive 
side, Sou th A f r ica ’s economic strength and ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty can serve as a 
p ow e r f u l catalyst f o r reg iona l in teg ra t ion and cooperation. Sou th A f r i c a n 
ins t i tu t ions (pub l ic and p r iva te ) already are p l a y i n g a strong capac i ty building r o l e 
in the region. Meanwh i le , in the absence o f reg iona l - leve l f inance and inves tmen t 
agreements, the coun t ry ’s p r iva te sector and quasipublic ins t i tu t ions are de facto 
in teg ra t ing the r e g i o n th rough ou twa rd fo re ign investment. Furthermore, Sou th 
A f r ica ’s water and energy resource constraints are forces f o r closer cooperation 
w i t h i t s neighbors.

I n the wider regional economic space, 
insufficient

linkages and operational and quality inefficiencies, no less due to po l icy ,

hampering competitiveness and development. Transport costs and e f f ic iency o f

than in m a n y other regions o f the wo r ld . S im i la r ly , o n a subregional basis, the 
penetration o f the f i x e d telecommunications n e tw o r k remains l o w at a l e v e l o f

generally poor. Res t r ic t ive p o l i c y and regu la to ry f ramewo rks have resulted in a

insu f f ic ien t reg ion -w ide in te rconnec t iv i ty and connec t iv i t y w i t h the r e s t o f the

The mismatch between demand f o r and supply of natural resources-energy, 
common poo l resources such as transboundary conservation areas, and shared 
marine systems-all po in t to the need fo r close cooperation among countries in 
the region, as we l l as to the potential f o r trade in services. O n aggregate, the 
subregion i s r i c h l y endowed w i t h na tu ra l resources, l1 but these resources are 
uneven ly d is t r ibu ted among countries. In the case o f b iod ive rs i ty conservation 
areas, w h i c h p rov ide a un ique comparative advantage in t o u r i sm development, 
these resources o f ten straddle na t iona l borders o r are shared, such as wa te r 
courses. As f o r t h e subregion’s la rge and diverse energy resources,12 hyd ropowe r 
capacity and na tu ra l gas reserves are fa r f r o m o p t im a l l y exploited. Furthermore, 
Sou th A f r ica ’s reliance o n expensive (at least re la t ive t o hyd ro ) and p o l l u t i n g 
the rma l powe r f r o m domestic coa l i s heavy. Thus, the scope f o r reg iona l

Recommendations and Next Steps 

51. 

Besides the guidelines ou t l ined in I D A 1 4 and the AAP, discussions t o operationalize the 
Bank ’s strategy t o support deep in teg ra t ion and stronger cooperation in Southern A f r i c a have 
been gu ided by fou r recommendations: 

1.

Country work. As in other regions, the Bank’s reg iona l in teg ra t ion approach in 
Southern A f r i c a w i l l con t inue t o b e directed p r im a r i l y at i n d i v i d u a l countries and 
fo rmu la ted th rough the C A S and PRSP processes. This i s pa r t icu la r ly appropriate 
in view o f the extreme d ive rs i t y o f S A D C member countries in eve ry economic, 
social, o r p o l i t i c a l dimension. M o r e specifically, i f S A D C ma in ta ins as i t s p r i o r i t y 
t h e fo rma t ion o f a common market, ra is ing the member countries t o a c omm o n 
m i n im a l l e v e l o f macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and social cohesion becomes a clear 
imperative. 
T h e Bank’s support to SADC should focus on extending and intensifying sectoral 
cooperation issues together w i t h a selective-rather 
than comprehensive-agenda 
toward the long-tenn objective of deep integration. Ana lys is o f the reg ion ’s i n i t i a l 
cond i t ions suggests that the Bank ’s assistance needs t o focus o n i n t e n s i f y i n g 
in t ra reg iona l cooperation. This emphasis w i l l strengthen the reg iona l economy 
and thus fac i l i ta te i t s in teg ra t ion in t h e w o r l d economy in accordance w i th t h e 
n o t i o n o f S A D C as an open reg iona l arrangement. 
Support fo r selected aspects of 
the common market agenda. E v e n though i t i s 
recommended that t h e Bank emphasize sectoral cooperation, i t also shou ld n o t 
igno re the long - te rm ob jec t ive o f a S A D C common market. Past and ongo ing 
dialogue w i t h SADC authorities has focused o n the three p i l l a r s o f deep 
integration: (1) p r i n c i p a l l y trade issues, but also the ( 2 ) f inanc ia l sector, and less 
so (3) macroeconomic p o l i c y convergence. Demand f r o m RIAS continues t o 
pursue these l ines o f ac t iv i ty . Therefore, the B a n k shou ld con t inue ongo ing o r 
already p lanned w o r k o n trade and f inanc ia l in teg ra t ion issues, w h i l e se lec t ive ly 
responding t o RIAs o n elements o f trade and f inanc ia l integration. 
Strengthening existing SADC capacity is needed to achieve stronger cooperation 
among countries across key sectors. Coope ra t ion with Sou th A f r i c a n ins t i tu t ion s 
as vehicles f o r capacity building in i t ia t ives over a w i d e spectrum o f issues has 
wo rked we l l in the past. I t shou ld b e strengthened in fu tu re activities, pa r t icu la r ly 
since Sou th A f r i c a i s a w i l l i n g partner in reaching ou t t o the sub reg ion and 
beyond.

CAS REVIEW FY2000-FYOS 

1. 
This rev iew includes a l l t h e Coun t ry Assistance Strategies (CAS), I n t e r i m Strategy No tes 
( ISN ) , and Coun t ry Partnership Strategies (CPS) f r o m F Y O O t o FY 0 8 ( th rough December 2007) 
available in the Bank’s I R I S system.’ T h e research encompasses the rev iew o f 66 documents ( 3 9 
CASs, 24 I S N s , and 3 CPS), a l l o f w h i c h w i l l b e re fe r red t o as “CASs” in the f o l l o w i n g l ines and 
tables and w h i c h can be divided by year as f o l l ow s : 

2. 
O n l y 3 9 o f 47 Sub-Saharan A f r i c a n countries* c o u l d b e inc luded in the rev iew , as no 
CASs were available f o r 8 countries (Botswana, DRC , Equa to r ia l Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, 
Seychelles, Sou th A f r ica , Swaziland, and Togo). 

3 . 

The c r i te r ia t o establish whether and t o wha t extent reg iona l in teg ra t ion issues and 
considerations appear in the documents become mo re spec i f ic as the r e v i ew goes deeper. We 
begin by simply reviewing whether reg iona l in teg ra t ion considerations a re men t ioned in the 
documents. Second, w e v e r i f y whether reg iona l in teg ra t ion i s spec i f ica l ly men t ioned in the 
Bank’s strategy. T h e n we go a step fu r the r and see i f t h e Bank ’s lending programs also inc lude 
reg iona l projects. Subsequently, w e observe whether reg iona l in teg ra t ion projects’ impac ts are 
re f lec ted in the results m a t r i x andlor in sp i l love r effects. Last, w e see whether reg iona l 
in teg ra t ion considerations also are re f lec ted in other p rog rammed activities. Tab le A 6 . 1
