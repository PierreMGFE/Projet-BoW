EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Past assistance and pa r tne rsh ip strategies of 
the Bank G r o u p have sought t o assist 
Mex ico i n i ts efforts to undertake the la rge economic, soc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l changes of 
the 
last tw o decades. M u c h has been transformed i n Mex ico , and much remains t o be done. The 
challenges a re to increase the r a t e of sustainable and inclusive g r ow t h and t o pu rsue po l ic ies 
that w i l l a l low nea r ly 45 m i l l i o n Mex icans to escape f rom pove r ty . 

2. 

The agenda of 
the Bank fo r m idd le income countries is w e l l adapted t o support the 
development strategy of President Calderon, now i n h is second yea r of o f ice . Tha t strategy 
was set out in the N a t i o n a l Development P l a n 2007-2012. The P l a n focuses on f i v e s t ra teg ic 
p i l l a r s inc lud ing competitiveness, security and the r u l e of 
law , effective democracy, equality 
of oppo r tun i ty and environmental sus ta inab i l i ty . No tw i ths tand ing steady p rog ress i n the pas t 
twenty years, Mex ico s t i l l faces serious p rob lems of pove r ty and i t needs t o imp rove 
competitiveness i n o rde r to accelerate g row th . The Government recognizes tha t continued 
assistance f rom the in te rna t iona l f i n a n c i a l community can he lp Mex ico make headway i n 
reso lv ing those p rob lems . 

3. 

I n recent years, there has been a no tab le change i n the dynam ic of 
the Bank ’s 
re la t ionsh ip w i t h Mex ico . Experience f rom the implementation of 
the last CPS and feedback 
f rom 
the government ind ica te the need f o r 
increasingly f lex ib le , on-demand services, 
especially advisory services and techn ica l assistance. A t the same time, the key r o l e of 
the 
Bank as a lender is also understood. 

4. 

The Bank and the government have agreed on an app roach that w o u l d enhance the 
Bank ’s effectiveness and responsiveness th rough a streamlined IBRD lend ing p rog ram , and 
an expanded p r o g r am of ana ly t ic and advisory ac t iv i t ies (AAA). M o s t lend ing w o u l d be 
consolidated in to a n annua l Development Po l icy L o a n (DPL) tha t supports the government’s 
own na t iona l development strategy. The AAA p r o g r am w i l l be carefully ta i lo red to country 
demands and w o u l d respond rap id ly t o emerging opportunities. F i n a l l y , the CPS intends t o 
reinforce efforts to coo rd ina te development assistance across the W o r l d Bank G roup . T o 
anchor the t rans i t ion t o th is s t ream l ined approach, a p roposed $500 m i l l i o n DPL (w i th 
D e f e r r e d D r aw d ow n Op t ion ) accompanies this CPS. 

5 . 

IFC w i l l con t inue p r o v i d i n g support i n the f i n a n c i a l sector w i t h spec ia l emphasis on 
increasing access t o f inance t o underserved segments of 
the p o p u l a t i o n and continue 
p r om o t i n g the development of 
the housing f inance market. The other p r i o r i t y areas fo r 
investment and advisory ac t iv i t ies include imp rov ing the qua l i ty of hea l th and education 

sectors and phys ica l infrastructure and p romo t ing reforms tha t continue strengthening the 
investment climate. 

6. 

Rat iona le for 

the Streamlined Approach. 

The ra t iona le for moving 
to a 
s t ream l ined app roach is based on p a r t i c u l a r characteristics of Mex ico : (a) an established 
t rack reco rd of sound macroeconomic management; (b) subs tan t ia l rema in ing long term 
development challenges - sustainable and equitable g row th ; (e) continued demand fo r Wo r ld 
Bank G r o u p engagement i n a b road po l icy d ia logue and s p e c i j k , focused advisory services; 
and (d) competitive access to f inance and supe r io r debt management. The new streamlined 
app roach focuses Bank resources on an enhanced p r o g r am of non - lend ing services w h i l e 
m in im iz ing both the f i n a n c i a l and non-financial costs of b o r r ow i n g f rom IBRD. 

7. 

Structure of 

the Streamlined Approach. 

The s t ream l ined app roach w o u l d be 
anchored on a la rge multi-sector DPL that w o u l d fo l low the ope ra t iona l guidelines fo r such 
loans: a focus on the government’s own reform p r o g r am (e.g., N a t i o n a l Development 
P rog ram ) w i t h a set of p r i o r actions. Annua l base lend ing t o the federal government w o u l d 
be $800 m i l l i o n over the next three years. A t tha t time, a mid-term review w o u l d determine 
the fu tu re lend ing amounts. Lend ing amounts cou ld be adjusted depending upon IBRD 
p r i c i n g competitiveness and market conditions. 
I n p a r a l l e l , the Bank and the government 
w o u l d reach agreement on a complementary set of advisory services tha t w o u l d support the 
government ’s development p rog ram . 

8 . 

Risks. The ma in risks to this development pa r tne rsh ip emerge f rom both domestic 
and external factors. Domestic factors a re f i s c a l dependency on o i l revenues, long - run 
competitiveness, soc ia l cohesion and consensus b u i l d i n g f o r reforms and the po ten t ia l fo r 
na tu ra l calamities - i n p a r t i c u l a r , earthquakes and hurricanes. On the external f ron t , the 
h igh degree of co r re la t ion of economic ac t iv i ty w i t h key t r a d i n g pa r tne rs and associated 
declines i n exports and /o r remittances pose a r isk . The government has taken a number of 
impo r tan t actions i n recent years to m i t iga te these risks and actions supported by the CPS 
shou ld serve as m i t iga t ing factors as we l l . 

9. 

Executive D i rec to rs may w ish to consider the f o l l ow i n g issues f o r discussion. 

Does the f l e x i b l e streamlined app roach to IBRD lending, combined w i t h a n 
enhanced p r o g r am of ana ly t ic and advisory ac t iv i t ies , adequately reflect the 
Bank ’s p o l i c y fo r w o r k i n g i n middle-income countries? 

A r e the risks w e l l identified and m i t iga t ing fac to rs sufficient fo r assuring the 
l ike l ihood of successful implementation ?

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

FY08 -FY13 ' 

A. INTRODUCTION 
1. 
The last W o r l d Bank Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) f o r M e x i c o was 
prepared in March 2004. A CPS Progress Repo r t was prepared in January 2007 and 
covers FY07-08. 

2. 
Past assistance and partnership strategies o f the Bank G roup have sought to assist 
M e x i c o in i t s e f fo r ts to undertake the large economic, social and ins t i tu t iona l changes o f 
the las t tw o decades. M u c h has been transformed in Mex ico , and m u c h remains to be 
done. The challenges are t o increase the rate o f g r ow t h in a sustainable and inc lus ive 
w a y and t o pursue po l ic ies that w i l l a l l ow nea r ly 45 m i l l i o n Mex icans to escape f r o m 
pove r ty . 

3. 
The government o f President Fe l ipe Calderbn, n o w in i t s second year o f o f f ice , 
has developed a l o n g t e r m v i s i o n o f M e x i c o f o r the year 2030, as w e l l as po l ic ies f o r 
p r om o t i n g human development in the current administration, w h i c h spans the p e r i o d 
2006-2012. The po l ic ies have been detailed in the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t P l a n (NDP)*. 
The agenda o f the B a n k fo r m i d d l e income countries (M ICs ) i s well adapted t o support 
the development strategy o f President Calderbn. 

4. 
In recent years, there has b e e n a no tab le change in the dynam ic o f the Bank's 
re la t ionsh ip with M e x i c o . Experience f r o m the imp lemen ta t ion o f the las t CPS and 
feedback f r o m the government ind ica te the need f o r inc reas ing ly f lex ib le , on-demand 
services, especially advisory services and techn ica l assistance. At the same time, the k e y 
r o l e o f the B a n k as a lender i s also understood. 

5. 
The B a n k and the government have agreed on an approach that w o u l d enhance 
the Bank 's effectiveness and responsiveness th rough a streamlined IBRD lending 
program, and an expanded p rog ram o f ana ly t ic and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (M). M o s t 
lending w o u l d be consolidated i n t o an annual Deve lopmen t P o l i c y L o a n (DPL) that 
supports the government's o w n na t iona l development strategy. The AAA p rog ram w i l l 
b e c a r e h l l y ta i lo red t o coun t ry demands and w o u l d respond rapidly t o eme rg ing 
opportunities. F ina l ly , the CPS intends t o re in fo rce e f fo r ts t o coordinate development 
assistance across the W o r l d B a n k Group. 

' Mexico i s not currently a member o f M IGA ; however, the government has signed an agreement to j o i n 
M IGA that i s pending Congressional ratification.

B. CURRENT ECONOM IC OUTLOOK 

Economic Developments 

6. 
The average annual rate o f economic g r ow t h over the 2004-07 p e r i o d has been 3.8 
percent. A v igo rous g loba l economic expansion con t r ibu ted t o the enhanced g r ow t h 
performance: the n om i n a l do l la r value o f to ta l exports increased at an annual rate o f 13.4 
percent during this pe r iod . A n n u a l i n f l a t i o n was 3.8 percent at the end o f 2007. 

7. 
Higher-than-expected o i l and tax revenue a l lowed the p u b l i c sector to increase 
current and cap i ta l expenditures and, at the same time, pos t very sma l l f isca l surpluses in 
2006 and 2007. A balanced budget requirement i s part o f a federal budget and f isca l 
respons ib i l i ty law adopted in 2006. In t e rm s o f a broader “public sector b o r r ow i n g 
requirements” that includes off-budget spending, the M e x i c a n public sector also has 
managed to res t ra in i t s debt financing requirements t o about 1 to 2 percent o f GDP. 

8. 
Current macroeconomic po l ic ies a re consistent and sustainable. Mac roeconom ic 
p o l i c y has focused o n f isca l balance, active p u b l i c debt management t o lengthen the 
ma tu r i ty and reduce exposure t o exchange rate risk, mone ta ry p o l i c y based o n i n f l a t i o n 
targeting and a f l e x i b l e exchange rate. S tab i l i ty has been secured with o n l y one 
s ign i f ican t s l ow d ow n (2001-2002), since the crisis o f the mid 1990s and a steady decline 
in in f la t ion . The markets have reacted t o these prudent po l ic ies : sovereign spreads have 
declined and c red i t r a t i n g agencies have upgraded M e x i c o ’ s sovereign debt ra t ing (see 

Figure 1). 

9 . 
Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects. Econom ic g r ow t h i s decelerating 
this year. A sharper-than-expected s low ing o f economic a c t i v i t y in the U . S . i s l i k e l y to 
hit M e x i c o harder than other countries and i s an impo r tan t risk t o the M e x i c a n economy. 
With the increased economic 
in teg ra t ion f o l l ow i n g NAFTA, M e x i c a n indus t r ia l 
p roduc t ion has become highly correlated with indus t r ia l p roduc t ion in the United  state^.^ 
The government has reduced i t s g row th forecast to 2.8 percent in 2008. Depending o n 
the severity o f the deceleration o f the U S economy, g r ow t h c o u l d be even lower. On the 
other hand, several factors c o u l d m u f f l e the impac t o f a s l ow d ow n in the United States, 
re la t ive to h is to r ica l experience: 
(a) the continued conso l ida t ion o f p u b l i c finances and 
the reduc t ion in external indebtedness; (b) the recove ry o f bank l e n d i n g to the p r iva te 
sector; and (c) an inc reas ing d ive rs i f ica t ion o f export destinations (a l though the U n i t e d 
States remains t h e m a i n destination at about 82 percent). Apart f r om these short te rm 
considerations, growth has been modest re la t ive 
t o 
the country’s potential-a 
phenomenon that the Bank has ca l led the “economic development p ~ z z l e . ” ~ 

3 

The Bank has calculated a simple corre la t ion coe f f ic ien t o f about 0.95 in recent years, compared to about 
0.69 in t h e early 1990s. IMF s ta f f has estimated a “ ru le o f thumb” e las t ic i ty o f U S indus t r ia l p roduc t ion 
shocks o n Mex ican quarterly GDP : a one percent shock in U S indus tr ia l p roduc t ion creates a 0.9 percent 
shock o n Mex ican GDP . See IMF Mex ico : Selected Issues, December 2007 . Sw is ton and B a y o um i 
estimate an even larger re la t ionsh ip (“Spillovers Across NAFTA,” IMF W o r k i n g Paper WP/08/3). 
See the W o r l d Bank’s “po l icy notes” publication, Mex ico 2006-2012: Creat ing the Foundations for

D e b t Managemen t . M e x i c o success f i l ly reduced i t s p u b l i c debt-to-GDP ra t io 
and imp lemen ted a debt management strategy that favors domestic cu r rency f inanc ing o f 
p u b l i c debt over the past few years. The government n o w regu la r ly issues f ixed - ra te peso 
bonds up t o 30 years o f ma tu r i ty and the average ma tu r i ty o f domestic debt increased t o 
5 . 5 yea rs by the end o f 2007. The government’s debt management strategy f o r 2008’ 
establishes two m a i n l i n e s o f action: (i) t o con t inue t o finance the federal government’s 
d e f i c i t p r im a r i l y by longe r te rm , domestic cu r rency debt, and (ii) t o strengthen the cost 
and ma tu r i ty p r o f i l e o f external debt and reduce external ma rke t debt by $500 m i l l i o n . 
Desp i te a s ign i f ican t reduc t ion in external debt over the past few years, the strategy 
recognizes the importance o f ma in ta in ing a presence o n in te rna t iona l cap i ta l markets and 
assuring an e f f ic ien t do l la r y ie ld -cu rve as a reference f o r p u b l i c and p r iva te sector 
emissions. Ex te rna l finance p rov ided by mu l t i la te ra l development banks i s e x p l i c i t l y 
exc luded f r om the external debt reduc t ion target. In add i t ion t o adequate f inanc ia l terms 
and conditions, the strategy expresses the interest o f the government to m a i n t a i n an ac t ive

C. LONG RUN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

11. As men t ioned above, Mex ico ’s l o n g run economic performance has been 
puzz l ing . 
T o some extent, economic and social outcomes have p laced M e x i c o 
persistently entrenched between tw o worlds: 
the less developed w o r l d and the high 
income members o f the OECD (see F igu re 2 ) . Average income l e v e l s and social 
ind ica to rs consistently revea l this pattern. M o r e accelerated long - run g r ow t h w i l l be 
needed t o b reak this pattern, but this w i l l requ i re im p r o v e d competitiveness th rough 
l ow e r i n g barriers t o bus iness investment, imp roved infrastructure, expanded f inanc ia l 
sector and faster human cap i ta l accumulation. 

12. 

The other p u z z l i n g phenomenon i s that there a re t w o wo r lds within M e x i c o . 
Income per capita in no r the rn states i s closer t o the income p e r capita o f the Ame r ican 
Sou th than t o the income pe r capita o f the M e x i c a n south. Soc ia l outcomes, access t o 
p u b l i c services and the qua l i ty o f services also revea l a s im i la r geographic pattern. This 
i s exacerbated by sharp differences across ethnic groups as w e l l . 

13. 

These tw o themes cu t across t rad i t iona l sectors, and the re i s inc reas ing consensus 
in Mex ico , b o t h among p o l i c y makers and the general pub l ic , with regards t o the l o n g run 
development challenges fac ing the country. The W o r l d Bank G roup has pa r t ic ipa ted in 
this debate th rough extensive analytic w o r k and p o l i c y dialogue. The debate has centered 
o n the f o l l ow i n g areas: 

e 3 Acce le ra t ing G row th ; 
e 3 Im p r o v i n g Competitiveness; 
e 3 P romo t ing soc ia l inc lus ion and reduc ing pove r ty ; 
e 3 Deve lop ing infrastructure and assuring energy security; 
e 3 Strengthening institutions; and 
e$. Assu r ing environmental sus ta inab i l i ty . 

14. 

B e l ow i s a brief summa ry o f some o f the key issues, based o n recent analytic 
w o r k conducted by the W o r l d B a n k Group. There i s substantial ove r lap across these 
areas. 

15. 

Acce lerat ing g row th . 

One k e y issue, as men t ioned above, i s that per capita 
economic g r ow t h ove r the last quarter cen tu ry has n o t kep t pace with OECD countries, 
n o r has i t kept pace with top p e r f o rm i n g eme rg ing ma rke t economies, as demonstrated in 
F igu re 2. Acce le ra t ing g r ow t h w i l l r e q u i r e improvements in the inves tmen t climate, 
infrastructure, human cap i ta l and the innova t ion system. In b r ie f , i t requires progress in a 
va r ie ty o f complementary areas discussed be low .7

In very general te rms , k e y factors a r i s e in the debate and in b o t h B a n k and l o c a l 
analyses o f competitiveness: (i) high cost o f infrastructure services; (ii) log is t ics costs, 
(iii) compe t i t ion f r om i n f o rm a l f i r m s ; (iv) l o w investment in p roduc t ive innova t ion ; and 
(v) access to f inanc ia l services. The f i r s t issue i s c lose ly related to the ine f f ic iency o f

Secondly, the ex is t ing in te rna t iona l comparisons o f logistics performance (e.g., 
the a b i l i t y o f countries t o deliver goods in t im e and at l o w costs f r om o r i g i n t o destination 
th roughou t the wo r ld ) show that M e x i c o has substantial r o o m f o r imp rovemen t (see 
F igu re 3 above). Thirdly, the investment c l ima te survey o f M e x i c o indicates that f i rm s

Pove r ty has subsequently fallen, but na t iona l and r u r a l p o v e r t y rates did n o t recover t o 
pre-crisis l e v e l s until 2002. 
(See Figure 4.) Ove ra l l pove r ty rates r em a i n high, with 
almost 45 m i l l i o n Mex icans living in pove r ty and with pe rs is ten t and substantial 
differences across regions and ethnic groups. Furthermore, the p o o r m a y be m o r e 
vulnerable t o h t u r e labo r ma rke t shocks, as they have the wo rs t labo r ma rke t inse r t ion 
rates and their human cap i ta l endowments a re g r ow i n g s low ly . The evidence indicates 
that poo r ind iv idua ls have l o w human cap i ta l endowments, and they are m o r e likely t o b e 
employed in the i n f o rm a l sector. The high degree o f in fo rma l i ty , the ba r r ie rs t o access t o

The d is t r ibu t ion o f income in M e x i c o i s skewed - m u c h mo re so than i t s OECD

throughout the system, expand coverage o f secondary education and create m o r e

be s t i f led by hea l th p rob lems and the limited coverage and p o o r q u a l i t y o f hea l th services

D. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT VISION 

30. 

The Ca lde r6n adm in is t ra t ion prepared i t s N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan, and the 
f i r s t annual progress repo r t was presented in September 2007. In addition, the plan 
evolves ove r time with add i t iona l details developed and pre-set objectives. 
The 
government recen t ly presented a na t iona l in f ras t ruc tu re plan that lays ou t a m o r e detailed 
w o r k p rog ram t o address Mex ico ’s infrastructure needs. B e l o w i s a v e r y b r i e f desc r ip t ion 
o f the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t P lan (NDP). 

31. 
Sus ta inab le H um a n Deve lopmen t i s the ove ra rch ing theme o f the N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t Plan. The P l a n describes this as: “The purpose o f development consists o f 
creating an atmosphere in w h i c h a l l can increase their capacity and opportunities can 
expand f o r current and future generations.” 

32. 

The government’s na t iona l development plan i s based o n f ive pillars: 

*:* Ru l e of 
law andpub l i c safety. This p i l l a r i s based o n the fundamental premise 
that people need guarantees o f personal safety and p ro tec t ion o f their p rope r ty f o r 
sustained human development. Objectives and strategies in th is p i l l a r a re 
organized in areas such as compliance with the law, e f fec t ive and equal access t o 
jus t ice f o r all, the fight against corruption, d rug - t ra f f ick ing and organized crime, 
and the p reven t ion o f c r ime and violence. P u b l i c o p i n i o n p o l l s have consistently 
shown that M e x i c a n society places a high p r i o r i t y o n these issues. 

*:* 

Econom ic competitiveness and generation of 
jobs. An enhanced l e v e l o f 
sustained economic growth, at an annual rate o f 5 percent by 2012, and the 
generation, by 2012, o f at least 800,000 f o rm a l sector j o b s annua l ly are the m a i n 
quan t i ta t ive targets identified in this pillar o f the p l a n (pages 82 and 102 o f the 
NDP ) . In order t o achieve these targets, objectives and strategies in a large 
number o f areas and sectors, 
i n c l u d i n g p u b l i c 
finance, 
f inanc ia l sector, 
infrastructure, r u r a l development, sma l l and m e d i um enterprise and compe t i t ion

Equality of Opportunities. The reduc t ion o f inequalities and the p r o v i s i o n o f 
equal opportunities that a l l ow so lv ing the causes o f pove r ty are the focus o f the 
administration’s social p o l i c y . The guiding p r inc ip les o f this p o l i c y are: ta rge t ing 
o f resources o n programs that have demonstrated their effectiveness, extensive 
use o f m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation systems, and the development and use o f a 
unique reg is te r o f government sponsored social p rog ram beneficiaries. 
Government programs and po l ic ies in areas such as pove r ty reduction, health, 
education, indigenous people, gender equa l i ty and vulnerable groups are inc luded 
in this pillar. 

Environmental sustainability. The m a i n in i t ia t ive in this p i l l a r i s t o turn the 
concept o f env i ronmen ta l sustainability i n t o a transversal element o f p u b l i c 
po l ic ies and assure that a l l p u b l i c and p r iva te investments a re compa t ib le with 
environmental p ro tec t ion . Objectives and strategies are structured in areas such as 
water, 
forests, c l ima te change, b iod ive rs i ty , so l id waste and cross-cutting 
environmental sustainability p o l i c y instruments. As pa r t o f the development plan, 
M e x i c o published a comprehensive N a t i o n a l Strategy o n C l ima te Change w h i c h 
includes greenhouse gas emissions reduc t ion estimates as w e l l as measures t o 
adapt to the impac t o f c l ima te change. As a larger, na tu ra l resource r i c h eme rg ing 
ma rke t economy, M e x i c o sees i t s e l f we l l p laced t o take a p rom inen t r o l e in the 
in te rna t iona l agreements and cooperation o n g loba l environment issues. 

Effective democracy and responsible foreign affairs. The last chapter o f the 

na t iona l development p l a n focuses o n democracy as an e f fec t ive system o f 
government that promotes development and we l l -be ing o f the popu la t ion and a 
fo re ign a f fa i rs p o l i c y that leverages development opportunities and we l l -be ing o f 
Mex icans living in the coun t ry and abroad. Conso l ida t ion and strengthening o f 
democracy, mode rn iza t ion o f the p o l i t i c a l system inc lud ing enhancing m o r e d i rec t 
c i t izen involvement, transparency and accountability, as w e l l as the p r om o t i o n o f 
in te rna t iona l trade and investment, the p ro tec t ion o f M e x i c a n m ig ran t wo rke rs 
abroad and the con t r ibu t ion o f M e x i c o in the discussion and cons t ruc t ion o f 
solutions t o g loba l issues a re some o f the p rom inen t themes in th is pillar. 

33 . 

Each chapter o r pillar o f the NDP has a l i s t o f numerous objectives and mo re 
detailed strategies f o r ach iev ing those objectives. The plan represents an amb i t ious 
development p rog ram that requires substantial and complementary e f fo r ts across the 
spectrum o f government ministries and agencies a long with the co l labo ra t ion o f state and 
l o c a l authorities.

E. PRINCIPLES OF BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT 

34. 
M e x i c o has made great strides in economic and social development ove r the last 
two decades. Howeve r , the bene f i ts o f this progress have n o t been shared equally. As 
such, sharp income differences continue to divide the country. The p o l i c y notes 
pub l ica t ion ca l led th is the “two wo r lds ” within M e x i c o . These differences revea l the 
substantial development challenges that the coun t ry s t i l l faces. 
In addition, g loba l 
challenges add t o the development agenda, ranging f r o m in te rna t iona l competitiveness to 
c l ima te change. T o create a partnership t o mee t these challenges, the Bank needs t o d raw 
o n a l l i t s roles: lending, adv iso ry services and conven ing powe r . 

35 . 
Based on c l ien t feedback and the M e x i c a n authorities’ desire t o ma in ta in a strong 
relationship with the Bank, the CPS i d e n t i f i e s the f o l l ow i n g p r inc ip les o f engagement. 
The Bank’s support w i l l be based on: 

0 Flexibility. In keep ing with the M I C strategy, the Bank and the Government have 
discussed a CPS whose compos i t ion and instruments o f support w o u l d re f lec t 
Mex ico ’s developmental and 
f inanc ia l needs . 
Experience 
f r o m 
the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the last CPS and feedback f r o m the government ind ica te the 
need f o r inc reas ing ly f lex ib le lend ing and non - lend ing services t o adapt t o 
emerging opportunities during the com ing years. 

Fast Response. The partnership strategy i s predicated o n strengthening the 
Bank’s a b i l i t y t o respond r a p i d l y to the chang ing demands o f the Government. 
Recently, the Bank ’s AAA ac t iv i t ies have sh i f ted t o m o r e q u i c k response p o l i c y 
notes and other fo rms o f on-demand services, i n c l u d i n g fee-based services. 

0 Selectivity. T h e choice o f instruments f o r B a n k Group support w i l l b e driven 
primarily by c l ien t demand. The instruments w i l l be a l igned with the diagnosis o f 
l o n g t e r m development challenges discussed above. I t shou ld be no ted that the 
Bank would not b e engaged in areas o f the government’s NDP that are n o t under 
the mandate o f the Bank G roup as an in te rna t iona l organization. 

0 Competitive IBRD Pricing. Figure 1 d isp layed that the M e x i c a n government’s 
b o r r ow i n g costs has dec l ined over time. Cu r ren t market cond i t ions and the IBRD 
p r i c i n g r e f o rm approved in September 2007 p lace the cost o f b o r r ow i n g f r o m the 

14 

Bank s ign i f ican t ly b e l ow the government’s external b o r r ow i n g cost (i.e., about 
100 basis points). 

Coordinated World Bank Group Support. IBRD and I F C programs need t o 

con t inue deve lop ing synergies f o r o f f e r i n g development solutions t o Mex ico , as 
has recen t ly been the case in the hous ing and in f ras t ruc tu re sectors. Packages o f 
B a n k G roup support might mix IBRD TA with I F C financing, o r j o i n t e f fo r ts at 
the state l e v e l with a m i x o f b o t h IBRD and I F C ins t rumen ts . 

Box 2: Lessons L e a r n e d f r o m t h e CPS C om p l e t i o n R e p o r t . 
The CPS Comp le t ion Repor t (Annex C) h igh l igh ts the f o l l ow i n g seven k e y lessons learned: 

-F l e x i b i l i t y . Imp lemen ta t ion o f the last CPS has shown an increasing need fo r flexibility so as to respond 
more e f fec t ive ly to changing circumstances and new government requests. This f l e x i b i l i t y comb ined w i t h 
fast responsiveness i s a key factor fo r the Bank’s effectiveness in Mex ico . 
- T im i n g . The B a n k should a l i g n the time-frame o f the coun try strategy w i t h the electoral cyc le t o better 
ensure p o l i c y con t inu i ty du r ing p rog ram implementation. Tha t w o u l d have the add i t iona l advantage o f 
a l ign ing the t ime- frame o f the CPS w i t h the na t iona l development plan. 
-C om p e t i t i v e P r i c i n g . The Bank should communicate c lear ly in M e x i c o that i t has been and continues to 
be a pr ice-compe t i t ive source o f fore ign exchange finance. The B a n k should also make f i l l use o f recen t ly 
introduced, streamlined and lower-cost lend ing instruments in designing i ts lend ing program.’ 
-Resu l ts m o n i t o r i n g . In M I C s such as Mex ico , the B a n k shou ld acknowledge that CPS outcomes p r im a r i l y 
re f lec t the e f for ts o f the Government and t h e country. 
-Ro le o f AAA. Where applicable, the symb io t ic r o l e o f AAA and lend ing should continue t o be used in 
M e x i c o as a framework fo r developing a more complete p rog ram o f B a n k support. 
- F i d u c i a r y Aspects. The B a n k should continue o n s tream l in ing i t s con trac t ing and procurement 
requirements and should incorporate coun try sys tems to the extent possible. 
- I n t e r n a t i o n a l c o o r d i n a t i o n . The Bank should w o r k c lose ly with other in terna t iona l agencies in i t s 
m o m a m o f assistance to Mex ico . 

F. STREAMLINED APPROACH TO IBRD FINANCIAL SUPPORT 

36. 

T o implement these p r inc ip les and t o respond t o c l ien t demand, the B a n k needs t o 
enhance i t s delivery o f know ledge services. T o fac i l i ta te this process, the B a n k proposes 
s t ream l in ing IBRD f inanc ia l support by anchoring mos t lend ing in a large annual DPL 
that supports the government’s ove ra l l development strategy, accompanied by an 
enhanced package o f non - lend ing services. The Bank also proposes t o continue 
env i ronmen ta l investment loans (g iven their link t o pa ra l le l grant financing), and 
f inanc ing at the state leve l . Figure 6 p rov ides a schematic o f the streamlined program.

Rationale for 

the Streamlined Approach. 

The ra t iona le f o r m o v i n g t o a 
streamlined approach i s based o n pa r t icu la r characteristics o f M e x i c o : (a) an established 
track reco rd o f sound macroeconomic management; (b) substantial rema in ing l o n g te rm 
development challenges - sustainable and equitable growth; (c) con t inued demand f o r 
W o r l d Bank G roup engagement in a b road p o l i c y dialogue and specific, focused adv iso ry 
services; (d) compe t i t ive access t o finance and superior debt management; and (e) the 
“non-additionality” o f Bank p ro jec t ‘ f inanc ing t o sectoral ministry budgets. The new 
streamlined approach focuses Bank resources on an enhanced p r o g r am of non-lending 
services w h i l e m in im iz ing both the f i n a n c i a l and non-financial costs of b o r r ow i n g f rom 

37. 

IBRD . 

38 . 

In terms o f the Bank ’s f inanc ia l services t o Mex ico , there i s a challenge t o 
p rov ide this f inanc ing at compe t i t ive interest rates, cu r ren t ly at about LIBOR flat, as w e l l 
as a compe t i t ive ma tu r i ty . Reduc ing the Bank ’s o w n adm in is t ra t ive costs f o r l o a n 
preparation and supervision w o u l d increase the resources available t o p r o v i d e an 
expanded se t o f adv iso ry services. These objectives c o u l d be achieved by: 

(i) S t ream l in ing the bu lk of lend ing in to an annua l Development P o l i c v L o a n 
(DPL) that supports the government’s own na t iona l development 
p r io r i t ies ; and 

(ii) Leve rag ing w a n t resources w h i c h are concentrated in the env i ronmen ta l 
sector in the case o f M e x i c o , hrther reduc ing the ove ra l l cost o f 
bo r row ing . 

39 . 

Structure of the Streamlined Approach. The large annual DPL w o u l d b e multi- 

sector and w o u l d f o l l ow the operational guidelines f o r such loans: a focus o n the 
government’s o w n r e f o rm p rog ram (e.g., N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Program) with a set o f 
p r i o r actions. In parallel, the Bank and the government w o u l d reach agreement o n a 
complementary se t o f adv iso ry services 
that w o u l d support 
the government’s 
development program. 

16 

40. 
A second track o f lending c o u l d b e developed, based on government demand. F o r 
example, the re i s i n t e r e s t in environmental investment loans that w o u l d attract co-

G. PORTFOLIO AND FIDUCIARY CONSIDERATIONS 

46. 
A s o f January 31, 2008, Mex ico 's IBRD p o r t f o l i o consisted o f 14 investment 
projects unde r imp lemen ta t ion f o r a net comm i tmen t o f $1.54 b i l l i o n , o f w h i c h $667 
m i l l i o n rema ined undisbursed. The la t te r represents a s ign i f ican t decrease during the 

p rev ious CPS period, resulting f r o m the fact o f having only minimal new investment 

lending $65 m i l l i o n ) between April 2006 and March 2008. In addition, 5 GEF grants 
($128 m i l l i o n ) were under implementation. T h e disbursement ra t io on investment 
projects was 36 percent and rea l ism ra t io was 67 f o r the f i rs t h a l f o f FY 0 8 . There were 
four projects at risk ( inc lud ing one GEF), o f w h i c h three were p rob lem projects whose 
net comm i tmen ts were equal to 19 percent o f the t o t a l net comm i tmen t amount. Steps are 

18 

being taken t o bring a l l the projects ou t o f p rob lem status by the end o f FY08 , with 
cancellation being considered in one case. Fu r the r details o n the current Bank and I F C 
po r t fo l ios in M e x i c o can b e found in Annexes E, F, G, H, I, M and N. 

47. 
L o o k i n g ahead, the annual p o r t f o l i o rev iew process (CPPR) w i l l b e adjusted in 
two ways: (i) to have a greater results focus; and (ii) t o incorporate AAA products. The 
enhanced resu l ts focus was spec i f ica l ly reques ted by the Secretariat o f Finance (SHCP) 
during the 2007 CPPR. The inco rpo ra t ion o f AAA would be consistent with the new 
bus iness m o d e l w h i c h w i l l resu l t in AAA products ou tnumbe r ing lend ing products. This 
annual r e v i ew o f AAA, prepared and imp lemen ted within a CPPR framework, would also 
add an element o f quality con t ro l that m a y be especially needed f o r re la t ive ly 
unstructured tasks such as fee-based o r just-in-time services. The C M U w i l l w o r k 
c lose ly with the c l ien t and the reg iona l Operations Services unit t o design an appropriate 
mechanism fo r such a results-based rev iew . 

48. 
Fiduciary and Safeguards Systems. The Bank w i l l con t inue t o w o r k with the 
government t o imp rove f iduc ia ry and safeguards systems within Bank - f inanced projects 
and in the p u b l i c sector generally. M e x i c o has w e l l - h n c t i o n i n g PFM systems, but s t i l l 
lags behind OECD - type practices, pa r t icu la r ly at the subnational leve l . The Bank 's 
engagement has progressively sh i f ted f r o m p ro jec t -spec i f ic support t o h e l p i n g t o imp rove 
coun t ry - leve l sys tems and the government's demand f o r the la t te r has increased, thus 
opening opportunities f o r demand d r i v e d f a s t response p o l i c y advice and imp lemen ta t ion 
support. The Bank can also use i t s conven ing powe r t o organize h igh ly - ta rge ted 
workshops t o share in te rna t iona l experiences in these areas. Ana logous opportunities 
exist with respec t t o social and env i ronmen ta l safeguards. The Bank has h a d a l o n g 
engagement with M e x i c o in these areas, d i rec t ly supported by ana ly t ica l work and 
i n c l u d i n g on -go ing assistance t o C F E and C O N A G U A to help them strengthen the i r 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity w i th respect t o strategic env i ronmen ta l and social assessments. 
W h i l e Mex ico 's sys tems in these areas a re sophisticated, 
there i s s t i l l r o o m f o r 
improvement. 
Acco rd ing ly , 
the Bank intends t o continue i t s dialogue with the 
government to explore possible government demand fo r AAA in these areas. Further 
in fo rma t ion o n fiduciary issues can be found in Annex D.

J. RESULTS MONITORING 

63. 

The M e x i c o CPS contains a strong o r ien ta t ion towa rd ach iev ing realistic 
outcomes and a results-oriented m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion system. However, deve lop ing 
a r e s u l t s f ramewo rk that specifies expected linkages between the Bank’s interventions 
and l o n g t e r m development goals f o r a f lex ib le p rog ram o f support such as that described 
in the M e x i c o CPS i s a challenge. This i s p a r t l y because o f the re la t ive ly sma l l scale o f 
the Bank’s f inanc ia l support re la t ive t o GDP. The CPS envisions IBRD lend ing that 
o f ten leverages Bank expertise in areas w h i c h the Government has i d e n t i f i e d as a ma jo r 
p r i o r i t y and t o w h i c h i t i s comm i t t ing substantial resources (e.g. innovation, te r t ia ry 
education). 
I t i s also because o f the nature o f the Bank’s e v o l v i n g r o l e as a know ledge 
partner. An impo r tan t share o f the Bank’s support under the CPS w i l l b e AAA and 
adv iso ry services, the evaluation o f w h i c h presents inherent d i f f icu l t ies . This i s 
especially t r u e in Mex ico , where the Government i s requesting support o n a “real-time” 
basis, and o f ten f o r input t o the p o l i c y process, in w h i c h the authorities are d raw ing o n 
m u l t i p l e sources o f advice, and not, in every case, t o the fo rmu la t ion o r imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the po l ic ies themselves. Th is fluidity in demand, and the fact that the p rog ram w i l l be 
fully de f ined o n l y in i t s later years f o l l ow i n g ongo ing dialogue, makes an ex ante 
iden t i f ica t ion o f inpu ts and r e s u l t s d i f f i c u l t . 

64. 

In this context, the CPS seeks t o meet the core ob jec t ive o f a results-based 
Coun t ry Strategy by presenting a results f ramewo rk that establishes relationships between 
interventions and outcomes; contains measurable indicators; and describes arrangements 
f o r collection, analysis, and use o f data t o m o n i t o r results, w h i l e p ragma t ica l ly re f lec t ing

time during CPS implementation, and i t w i l l be updated at the t im e o f the CPS Progress 
Report. Annex A details the Results M a t r i x .

Competitiveness. Sluggish g r ow t h performance and limited employment

F ina l ly , the re are r i s k s associated with the n ew approach t o Bank G roup

b o r r ow i n g f r om the Bank (as i t has done in the past) and hence jeopa rd ize the Bank's 
ove ra l l p rog ram o f technical assistance and continued relevance. A second r i s k i s that the

t o support a large annual DPL. I f the f i r s t risk i s realized, i t i s likely that the non - lend ing 
p rog ram w o u l d have t o be reduced and an e v e n higher degree o f se lec t iv i ty in t roduced 
i n t o non - lend ing services - o r fee-based services c o u l d b e scaled up. I f the second risk i s 
realized, there are several options: the l o a n amounts o f the annual D P L c o u l d b e reduced, 
the p rog ram redefined and na r rowed t o an area where the p o l i c y dialogue and r e f o rm

Ana lyt ic Underpinnings: Programmat ic Competitiveness and T rade AAA 

4. 

The Bank ’s p rog ramma t ic Competitiveness and Trade AAA had i t s o r ig ins in an 
earlier co l labo ra t ion with the Government o n issues o f competitiveness. The Bank wo rked 
with the O f f i c e o f the President to assist the Government in defining a na t iona l 

29 

Competitiveness Agenda 2004-06. The success o f this assistance led to the elaboration o f the 
Programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA f o r FY05 -FY08 , w h i c h sought t o broaden 
the dialogue on competitiveness t o stakeholders beyond the executive and the p r iva te sector. 

5 . 
The fou r year programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA was i n i t i a l l y structured 
in three phases. The first phase has supported the d e s i g n and imp lemen ta t ion o f the M e x i c a n 
Competitiveness Agenda. 
The a im was no t t o produce an ana ly t ica l p iece o n 
competitiveness, but t o fill some key know ledge gaps that were necessary f o r the 
Competitiveness Agenda and t o p rov ide non - lend ing techn ica l assistance t o m o v e the agenda 
fo rwa rd . The second phase brings key p o l i c y messages i n t o the p u b l i c sphere. P o l i c y No tes 
have also served that objective. 

6. 
A repo r t was published f o r b o t h the f i r s t and second phases o f the p rog ramma t ic 
AAA. The two -vo lume 

f i r s t phase report, Mex ico ’s Challenge of Knowledge-based 
Competitiveness: Challenges and Oppo r tun i t ies , argued that M e x i c o had t o act n o w t o take 

advantage o f the opportunities arising f rom the know ledge revo lu t ion . The second phase 

report, Mex ico ’s Competitiveness: Reaching I t s Po ten t ia l , in fo rmed p o l i c y makers, the 

p r iva te sector, and the p u b l i c at large about competitiveness p r io r i t ies and shortcomings. The 
focus was o n measures t o enhance Mex ico ’s e f f ic iency , generate jobs, and m o v e the coun t ry 
t o a mo re innova t ion -d r iven stage o f development. Focused analytic pieces included: (i) an 
assessment o f the qua l i ty o f infrastructure and k e y weaknesses o f the M e x i c a n innova t ion 
system; (ii) an assessment o f the d ra f t labo r l a w r e f o rm and i t s likely impact o n ind ica to rs f o r

Financial Sector 

12. 
M e x i c o has made great strides towards conso l ida t ing the f inanc ia l sector and has 
in t roduced re fo rms to increase competition. Since the f i r s t debt c r is is o f 1982 and the effects 
o f the f inanc ia l c r is is o f 1994-95, M e x i c o has gone th rough a l o n g process o f f inanc ia l sector 
res t ruc tu r ing and consolidation. G r ow t h o f the f inanc ia l sector i s accelerating with increased 
competition. In the b a n k i n g sector, the re i s s t i l l a need f o r changes t o the C red i t Ins t i tu t ions 
Law. In the non -bank ing sector there i s a need t o deregulate Sofoles and adjust the laws 
re la t ing t o trus t , insurance and pens ion funds. In the b o n d market, n ew debt instruments are 
making i t easier t o ob ta in f inanc ing by issuing domestic debt, w h i l e the Securities L a w 
passed in December 2006 i s expected to improve the func t ion ing o f the stock market. The 
m a i n B a n k instrument f o r support t o the f inanc ia l sector was the F inance and G r ow t h DPL 
(FY06). 
That operation supported a series o f f inanc ia l sector reforms, i n c l u d i n g the 
securities Law and strengthened oversight by corporate boards. T h i s DPL replaced the 
Access to F i n a n c i a l Services p ro jec t o r i g i n a l l y p lanned fo r F Y 0 7 in the CPS. The 2006 
update to the F inanc ia l Sector Assessment P rog ram (FSAP) p r o v i d e d ana ly t ica l support t o 
other reforms, i n c l u d i n g the Banking Reso lu t ion L aw . In FY08 , t h e SHCP has asked the 
Bank to undertake a study o f competition in the bank ing sector. The p r i n c i p a l findings o f the 
study, w h i c h covered such topics as the performance o f development banks, access t o finance 
by SMEs, and micro-insurance, were subsequently inco rpo ra ted i n t o p o l i c y notes prepared 
f o r the i n c om i n g Ca lde ron administration. 

13. 
The B a n k G roup has also supported access t o f inanc ia l services by sectors 
underserved by comme rc ia l banks. The US$505.1 m i l l i o n R u r a l F inance SAL (FY03) 
supported the l i q u i d a t i o n o f B a n r u r a l and the creation o f F i n a n c i e r a R u r a l , a decentralized 
f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ion in charge o f p romo t ing the development o f r u r a l f inanc ia l markets and 
lend ing t o sma l l and m e d i um r u r a l producers. The p ro jec t also supported the Government’s 
broader goal o f reduc ing the f isca l d ra in o f loss-making banks, while enhancing access t o 
f inanc ia l services for sectors not se rved by comme rc ia l banks. A c c o r d i n g t o an IEG 
evaluation, as a result o f the project, the Government has made m a j o r inroads in r e f o rm i n g 
the r u r a l finance ma rke t and in res t ruc tu r ing the f inanc ia l sector. IEG ra ted the p ro jec t highly 

32 

satisfactory. The second phase o f the Savings and Ru ra l Finance Project (BANSEFI) has 
helped the Government strengthen mo re than 400 l o c a l savings and c red i t ins t i tu t ions and 
p lace them o n a sound f inanc ia l footing, thereby a f fo rd ing many low - income fam i l ies with 
access to f inanc ia l services that they w o u l d otherwise n o t enjoy. 

14. 
I F C has complemented B a n k assistance in the f inanc ia l sector with support in a to ta l 
amount o f US$578.8 m i l l i o n over 
the p e r i o d FY 0 5 - 0 8 
f o r mortgages 
( inc lud ing 
securitization), microfinance, banks, trade, and p r iva te equ i ty funds. Making use o f adv iso ry 
services when appropriate, 
I F C focused o n p r om o t i n g access t o f inanc ia l services f o r 
underserved r e t a i l entities wh i le , in the case o f the corporate sector, helping increase the 
access o f M S M E s to debt and equity finance. In addition, I F C he lped develop the ma rke t f o r 
education finance by inves t ing in a sole-purpose dedicated f inanc ia l i n s t i t u t i o n (Sofol) that 
specializes in the education sector. 

The housing finance market has expanded rapidly in recent years. The Federal 

15. 
Mo r tgage Agency, SHF , has fostered the development o f Sofoles, special purpose, non - 
deposit p r iva te c red i t institutions, and has established the lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk f o r 
a f lou r ish ing secondary mortgage market. The Bank supported the strengthening and 
expansion o f the p r iva te mortgage market th rough the F O V I Restructuring p ro jec t (US$505.1 
m i l l i o n , approved FY99), w h i c h extended support t o the Banking Finance Fund f o r H o u s i n g 
(FOV I ) and t o i t s successor ins t i tu t ion the SHF. The I C R f o r th is operation l i s t e d many 
accomplishments i n c l u d i n g assisting a p rog ram o f mortgage lending f r om 2000 t o 2005 that 
financed some 290,000 mortgages fo r a to ta l value o f US$7 b i l l i o n equivalent. Since 2004, 
the SHF has supported asset-backed securities with guarantees f o r timely payment. 

16. 
I F C has p rov ided funding and techn ica l assistance t o hous ing sector Sofoles and other 
mortgage providers, and i t has continued t o fac i l i ta te the development o f a secondary 
mortgage ma rke t development. 
I F C support has inc luded remittance-backed mortgages, 
warehousing lines, pa r t ia l c red i t guarantees and techn ica l and adv iso ry assistance. Since the 
SHF i s scheduled t o stop direct f ind ing f o r Sofoles in the com ing years, IFC ’ s e f fo r ts have

C . Key areas of opportunity for WBG Support Mov ing Forward 

17. 
F o l l ow i n g a t rans i t ion period, the streamlined approach t o IBRD lending w o u l d 
suggest that the focus o f IBRD w o r k w o u l d be t o establish Memo randa o f Understanding 
(MOU) with key government agencies i n v o l v e d in the p r iva te sector enab l ing environment. 
These M O U s w o u l d p rov ide basis f o r con t inued analytic and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (AAA). I t i s 
also l i k e l y that re fo rms and investments t o imp rove p r iva te sector development w i l l b e 
considered under the single DPL in future years. 
I F C w o u l d continue i t s f inanc ia l support 
f o r selected high impac t f i r m s and continue with analytic w o r k l i k e the m u n i c i p a l scorecard 
and adv iso ry services related to the business enab l ing environment (BEE). I t i s expected that 
the re w i l l be increasing co l labo ra t ion between IBRD and I F C o n adv iso ry services. 

18. During the t rans i t ion t o this approach, IBRD has a number o f ongo ing loans and 
activities. In terms o f the business climate, the IBRD i s in the latter stages o f p repa r ing a 

33 

l o a n that would support start-up f i r m s in business process outsourcing and other i n f o rm a t i o n 
techno logy focused activities. A tax adm in is t ra t ion p ro jec t i s also helping t o l ow e r the costs 
o f compliance with tax obligations. Pove r ty analysis - in a fee-based service - i s also 
m o v i n g towards understanding income generation f o r the poor and the func t ion ing o f labo r 
markers. F ina l ly , there i s cu r ren t ly a DPL s e r i e s f o r competitiveness, where one loan was 
already prepared and disbursed. In human cap i ta l development, there i s ongo ing lend ing f o r 
education q u a l i t y na t iona l ly a long with substantial analytic and adv iso ry support to the 
Secretariat o f Education. To imp rove the l i n k s b e tw e e n human cap i ta l development and 
bus iness innovation, the IBRD i s f inanc ing programs in the na t iona l science and techno logy 
counc i l (CONACYT ) . In infrastructure, IBRD i s p r o v i d i n g adv iso ry services on t o l l roads 
and log is t ics - in co l labo ra t ion with the IFC-and an innova t ive state l e v e l in f ras t ruc tu re 
development p ro jec t in the state o f Guanajuato i s under imp lemen ta t ion . A TA l o a n i s also 
supporting re fo rms and ins t i tu t iona l development in the water sector. In the f inanc ia l sector, 
there i s ongo ing advisory w o r k o n compe t i t ion in the banking system, m ic ro - f inance and 
micro-insurance and r e f o rm o f development banks. There i s also a DPL series t o support 
f inanc ia l sector re fo rms - with one l o a n prepared and disbursed (as men t ioned above). 
Housing finance has been supported by DPL loans - the mos t recent disbursed la te in 2007, 
and there i s an ongo ing TA loan that continues in this support. Substantial co l labo ra t ion 
b e tw e e n the IBRD and I F C has been a key factor in this wo rk . 

19. 
The I F C has a b road array o f ongo ing ac t iv i t ies and new p ro jec ts in the p ipe l ine 
which range f r o m the f inanc ia l sector t o health, agriculture and tourism. A d v i s o r y services

in favo r o f the population. I F C / I B R D co l labo ra t ion can p romo te this trend. 

37. 
In addition, IFC ’s support t o the p r iva te hea l th sector results in an increased supp ly o f 
high qua l i ty and affordable hea l th care services t o the general pub l ic , w h i c h relieves some o f 
the burden o n the busy p u b l i c sector fac i l i t ies in a complementary fashion. By absorbing 
m o r e o f the middle-class demand, p r iva te investment a l lows the Government t o allocate

In t e rm s o f adv iso ry services, the I F C recen t ly signed an adv iso ry mandate with the

MEX ICO: CPS Completion Report 
Date o f CPS: March 18,2004 Report N o . 28141-ME 
Date o f CPS Progress Report: January 8,2007 Report No . 37934-MX 
Period covered by the CPS Completion Report: FY05-FY08 

Summary 

T h i s document evaluates the achievement o f CPS objectives in Mexico together with the respective 
contributions o f the Government and the Bank. 

The 2004 CPS was prepared within the framework o f the Bank’s still-evolving agenda for Middle Income 
Countries. 
I t clearly acknowledged that the Bank provides only a sma l l part o f the overall financial 
requirements o f Mexico. Hence, the Bank contribution was not to be assessed i n te rms o f resource transfer 
but rather in t e rm s o f the international expertise that the Bank could mobilize within the context o f projects 
and programmatic analytic work. In that context, the Bank has been a facilitator o f communication that c a n 
effectively foster the t rans fe r o f knowledge and experience. 

T h e 2004 Country Partnership Strategy for Mexico was the first document o f that title to be presented to the 
Board o f the Bank. I t was the product o f outreach and consultation with the Government and other diverse 
stakeholders including c iv i l society and i t was predicated upon a need for the Bank to be flexible and quick 
i n responding to changing country requirements. Consistent with that approach, CPS outcomes in terms o f 
lending and AAA differed significantly from the specific tasks identified in the CPS document because the 
Bank adapted to changing country circumstances. T h e principal strategic objectives o f the CPS were 
successfully achieved. 

T h e CPS was driven by the government’s program and, during the CPS period, the government was 
broadly success fu l i n implementing its National Development Plan. Contributing to that outcome, the Bank 
delivered a substantial program o f knowledge and advisory services drawing upon its world-wide 
experience and access to international expertise. T h e success o f that program i s evidenced by the quality, 
relevance and sustainability o f the AAA delivered as judged by the client and other stakeholders. T h e Bank 
also contributed successfully to country outcomes with a diverse lending portfolio that was progressively 
adapted to the changing situation in Mexico and that performed well in terms o f project outcomes. 

In te rms o f lending volumes, the delivery o f the program was uneven. Lending in the f i r s t two years o f the 
program (FY05-06) was broadly consistent with the recent past. 
In September 2006, however, the 
government prepaid a large part o f i t s outstanding IBRD loan portfolio and that was followed by an abrupt 
drop in new lending with only one single project approved in FY07. 
The prepayment o f Bank loans and the drop i n lending do not imply a rupture in the Bank’s relationship 
with M e x i c o but rather a change i n the dynamic o f that relationship. The re i s s t i l l an active portfolio o f 
Bank-supported projects being implemented as well as an active program o f AAA a l l o f which generate a 
broad range o f Bank-client relationships at both the operational and policy levels. There is, therefore, 
f e r t i l e ground for restoring a strong program o f Bank support consistent with country requirements. 
T h e Bank and Mexico a r e now well placed to move forward with a broad policy dialogue backed b y 
selective lending operations strategically targeted at areas where the Bank can contribute most effectively. 
A more flexible approach to the next CPS i s warranted recognizing the need to respond to evolving c l i e n t 
demands.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY F YO 5 -O S 
COMPLETION REPORT 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The F Y O S - O S Country Partnership Strategy for M e x i c o was designed within 
the still-evolving policy framework of the Bank Group vis-&vis Middle Income 
Countries. I t was the f i r s t paper o f that t i t l e t o be presented t o the B o a r d o f the B a n k f o r 
discussion. In presenting a “Coun t ry Partnership Strategy”, rather than the customary 
“Country Assistance Strategy”, the Reg ion was c lea r ly s igna l ing a shift o f emphasis and 
focus w h i c h subsequently received a mo re general endorsement in a paper prepared fo r 
the Deve lopmen t Committee”. 
The B a n k management and B o a r d have n o t made a 
fo rma l d i f fe ren t ia t ion be tween a Coun t ry Assistance Strategy and a Coun t ry Partnership 
Strategy, but a d is t inc t ion i s emerging with continued usage in middle income coun tr ies 
(M IC ) . A s a partnership strategy, the CPS i s the p roduc t o f outreach and consultation 
with the Government and other diverse stakeholders i n c l u d i n g c i v i l society. The 
p r inc ip les o f Bank engagement with Mex ico ’s development program were based upon 
f l e x i b i l i t y and an ag i le response t o the changing needs o f the coun t ry as i t m o v e d fo rwa rd 
with p rog ram implementation. 
In keeping w i th a greater emphasis o n f l e x i b i l i t y 
consistent with the Bank’s M I C agenda, other recent CPSs, such at that f o r Chile, have 
l e f t undefined the spec i f ic lending operations and AAA t o be undertaken during the 
p rog ram period except f o r those already agreed with the c l ien t f o r the f i r s t year o r so.’’ 
The 2004 CPS fo r M e x i c o did n o t go that far. I t f o l l ow e d the m o r e t rad i t iona l practice o f 
spec i fy ing a complete p rog ram o f lend ing and AAA f o r the en t i re FY05-08 period. As a 
result, the re was a s ign i f ican t discrepancy b e tw e e n the detailed p rog ram specified in the 
CPS and actual outcomes as the Bank strove t o accommodate the chang ing needs o f the 
c l i e n t in the course o f program implementation. 
2. 
This comp le t ion repo r t does n o t fau l t the Bank f o r the discrepancy between the 
detailed CPS p rog ram and actual outcomes. Rather, i t assesses the CPS within the 
f ramewo rk o f the Bank ’s s t i l l evo lv ing M I C agenda. 
evaluated against th ree criteria. Since the CPS was d r i v e n by the Government’s program, 
the f i r s t c r i te r ion i s based o n h o w e f fec t ive ly the Government has achieved i t s 
development v i s i o n as determined by a select se t o f coun t ry development goals. Second, 
the know ledge and adv iso ry services o f the Bank - a k e y element o f the CPS - are judged 
with respect t o the i r quality, relevance and sustainability in con t r ibu t ing t o the p o l i c y 
process rather than by linking them t o specific coun t ry outcomes per se. Third, since the 
lending operations o f the Bank G roup are ve ry sma l l in re la t ion t o Mex ico ’s ove ra l l 
capital requirements, their effectiveness i s no t to b e judged in terms o f resource transfer 
but rather in terms o f the i r success in meeting specific p ro jec t ind ica to rs and by ove ra l l 
p o r t f o l i o performance. By those three criteria, imp lemen ta t ion o f the 2004 M e x i c o CPS 
was satisfactory.

Nevertheless, 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
lend ing p rog ram proceeded 
unan t ic ipa ted step-wise fashion. In the f i r s t tw o years, FY05-06, the vo lume o f lending 
was b road ly consistent with the recent past and w i th the CPS. 
In September 2006, 
however, the government made use o f buoyant fo re ign exchange reserves t o prepay a 
large part o f i t s outstanding IBRD loan po r t fo l io . The prepayment co inc ided with an 
abrupt f a l l in new lending. In FY07 , o n l y one loan was approved in an amount o f US$29

11. MEX ICO ’S NAT IONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND CPS 
OBJECTIVES 

5 . 
The Federal Government laid out its development strategy in the National 
Development Plan (NDP) fo r 2001-2006. The Plan was p roduced at a t im e o f p o l i t i c a l 
change in M e x i c o and i t focused p rom inen t ly o n issues o f democracy and governance. 
The P lan de f ined th ree broad strategic goals: social and human development, qua l i ty 
economic growth, and order and security (see Annex I). I t a f f i rmed the h n d am e n t a l 
importance o f pove r ty reduc t ion as a p r im a r y goa l o f economic development and 
emphasized the importance o f increasing competitiveness and strengthening ins t i tu t ions . 
These underlying goals were supported by the CPS. 
6. 
The monitoring matrix o f the CPS was aligned with country development 
objectives taken from the NDP. The CPS gave emphasis to env i ronmen ta l concerns. 
Howeve r , since the CPS was n o t results-based, the m a t r i x did n o t d i f fe ren t ia te between 
CPS outcomes and coun t ry -w ide outcomes. 

111. CPS OUTCOMES 

The Macroeconomic Context 

7. 
M e x i c o continued o n a pa th o f steady economic g r ow t h averaging 3.5 percent a 
year throughout the CPS pe r iod and g r ow t h has been accompanied by a s ign i f ican t 
decline in pove r ty . Expo r ts have continued t o g r ow in vo lume terms and even mo re so in 
value terms, buoyed by the rising p r ice o f petroleum. Mac roeconom ic management has 
b e e n good with in f la t ion , as measured by the annual r ise in consumer prices, h o l d i n g 
steady at 3 -4 percent in recent years. Unemp loymen t in the fo rma l sector o f the economy 
has l ikew ise rema ined at a l o w 3 -4 percent. An ove ra l l favorable economic performance 
has p romp ted in te rna t iona l c red i t agencies to upgrade their c red i t ratings f o r M e x i c o . 
Standard & Poor’s was the latest t o do so in October 2007 when i t raised Mex ico ’s long - 
t e rm fo re ign debt rating by one no tch t o BBB+ and increased the l o c a l currency rating 
f r om A to A+. However, sustained long - te rm g r ow t h w i l l requ i re a con t inua t ion o f 
structural and p o l i c y reforms, ranging f r o m f isca l and social re fo rms t o competitiveness 
reforms.

The CPS Vision 

8. 
The CPS was designed to: (a) focus o n i s s u e s where the B a n k c o u l d bring 
technical expertise f r om a w o r l d -w i d e perspective in the context o f a re la t ive ly sma l l 
number o f lend ing operations; (b) use p rog ramma t ic ana ly t ica l w o r k in areas where the 
Bank c o u l d p rov ide high value-added expertise; and (c) re ta in f l e x i b i l i t y t o respond t o 
new opportunities that may a r i s e during imp lemen ta t ion o f the CPS. The partnership 
strategy recognized that “Bank lending p rov ides a ve ry sma l l share o f p u b l i c revenues 
and the government has ready access t o alternative p r iva te financing”. 
In addition, the re 
were country-specific ins t i tu t iona l constraints because l i n e m in is t r ies are subject t o an 
ove ra l l budget constraint so that B a n k loans are n o t additional. As a result, the Bank has 
concentrated o n learning and know ledge sharing ac t iv i t ies that con t r ibu te t o the debate o n 
k e y p o l i c y reforms. T h i s strategy a l igned W o r l d Bank and I F C support f o r the 
Government’s p r io r i t ies within the context o f fou r p i l la rs : (i) reduc ing p o v e r t y and 
inequality; (ii) increasing Mex ico ’s competitiveness; (iii) strengthening the country’s 
institutions; and (iv) p r om o t i n g env i ronmen ta l sustainability. L e n d i n g scenarios in the 
range o f US$0.8 t o US$1 .7 b i l l i o n per year we re proposed, with US$1 .2 b i l l i o n a year 
be ing iden t i f ied as the mos t l i k e l y base case outcome. 
9 . 
The CPS predated the Bank’s results f ramewo rk and did n o t identify core

Pillar I: Reduce Poverty and Inequality 

Overview 

11. Mex ico made steady progress in reduc ing pove r ty a n d income inequa l i ty 
du r ing the CPS pe r iod . Considerable gains we re made in reduc ing the numbe r o f 
people b e l ow the o f f i c i a l M e x i c a n food-based pove r ty l i n e . By that measure the number 
o f poo r f e l l f r om 24.1 percent in 2000 t o 13.8 percent in 2006. Urban populations a re 
generally better o f f , with urban pove r ty f a l l i n g f r o m 11 percent in 2000 to 7.5 percent in 
2006. R u r a l pove r ty i s considerably mo re prevalent and i s apt t o fluctuate widely from 
year t o year in l i n e with ag r icu l tu ra l output. In recent years, however, r u r a l pove r ty has 
fa l len ma rked ly from 42.4 percent in 2000 t o 24.5 percent in 2006. 
12. 
As a result, M e x i co rema ins on t rack fo r ach iev ing the MDG goal to ha lve 
the numbe r o f people in extreme pove r ty b y 2015. Poo r households in r u r a l areas have 
bene f i ted f r om a stable macroeconomic environment, income d ive rs i f ica t ion i n t o non - 
ag r icu l tu ra l activities, and increased spending in soc ia l programs i n c l u d i n g cond i t iona l 
cash transfer programs such as Oportunidades and Procampo. The in t roduc t ion o f the 
Ley de Desarollo Social (Law o f Soc ia l Development) and the N a t i o n a l Eva lua t ion 
Counc i l ’s social development strategy p rov ide add i t iona l support f o r such programs.

Bank Support for Poverty Reduction through Programmatic AAA 

In 

13. At the Government’s request, the Bank supported the underlying policy base 
for poverty reduction and assisted with the design, monitoring and evaluation of 
social protection and poverty-related programs. The core ins t rumen t for Bank support 
has been the Pove r ty Programmatic AAA, w h i c h was developed in co l labo ra t ion with the 
Social Cabinet, The work was organized in th ree phases: (i) an ove ra l l pove r ty analysis 
(FY04); (ii) s tud ies o n u rban and r u r a l pove r ty and social p ro tec t ion systems (FY05); and 
(iii) analysis o f decentralized hnding and the de l ive ry o f social services (FY06). 
addition, the Bank approved an IDF grant to assist the Secretariat o f Social Deve lopmen t 
(SEDESOL ) develop an integrated system o f m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation f o r social 
programs. A proposed CONTIGO SAL (US$300 m i l l i o n ) in support o f the Federal 
Government’s social po l ic ies was dropped, because the Government f e l t that the comp lex 
task o f coo rd ina t ing imp lemen ta t ion across m in is t r ies w o u l d present too high a r i s k . 
Subsequently, a loan in support o f con t inu ing the Bank’s p rog ramma t ic analytic work 
and imp lemen ta t ion o f i t s recommendations within SEDESO L was n o t made because 
authorities did n o t be l ieve that external f inanc ing was needed. W h e n a new government 
took office, P o l i c y No tes were emp loyed t o convey the f ind ings o f the w o r k done t o the 
i n c om i n g administration. 
14. 
Three reports were produced: Poverty in Mexico: A n Assessment of 
Conditions, Trends and Government Strategy ( N 0 4 ) , Income Generation and Social 
Protection for the Poor (FYOS) and Decentralized Delivery for the Poor ( N 0 6 ) . The 
f i r s t repo r t was discussed at the highest l e v e l s o f government, cu lm ina t ing in a 
presentation t o the President o f M e x i c o and members o f the Cabinet in June 2004. The 
success o f the f i r s t phase established the Bank as an authoritative reference o n pove r ty in 
M e x i c o . The Government approved the pub l ica t ion and dissemination o f the study, an 
unprecedented step in M e x i c o fo r such a h igh -p ro f i le issue. The repo r t generated na t ion - 
wide med ia coverage. A QAG assessment ra ted the f i r s t phase as highly satisfactory. 
President F o x r e f e r r e d to the recommendations o f the second pove r ty repo r t in his 2006 
budget submission. The reports have also con t r ibu ted t o the design and r e f o rm o f k e y 
social p ro tec t ion programs and t o the debate o n public pens ion re fo rm . 
15 . 
The Bank was also able to draw upon programmatic poverty work in 
responding promptly to other government requests. A n a l y t i c no tes and a presentation 
were prepared f o r the Presidency w i th a comprehensive rev iew o f the social p ro tec t ion 
system, d raw ing u p o n ongo ing w o r k and the Bank ’s broader in te rna t iona l experience. A 
p o l i c y d ia logue o n these issues i s con t inu ing with the Ca lde r6n administration. 
addition, the Bank approved an IDF grant t o assist the Secretariat o f Soc ia l Deve lopmen t 
(SEDESOL) in developing an integrated system o f m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation f o r social 
programs. 
16. 
Complementary t o B a n k efforts, I F C expanded i t s support t o he lp increase c red i t 
t o m i c r o - and small-enterprises th rough f inanc ia l intermediaries. A US$15 m i l l i o n pa r t ia l 
credit gua ran tee was made in support o f Mex ico ’s 
f i rs t -eve r b o n d issued by a 
microfinance ins t i tu t ion . The b o n d issue p rov ided a to ta l o f $43.0 m i l l i o n t o th ree 
f inanc ia l institutions in support o f their m ic ro -c red i t operations. In addition, I F C invested 
US$45 m i l l i o n in a reg iona l bank tha t focuses o n SMEs and agribusiness. These

unde rp r iv i leged popu la t ion t o help alleviate pove r ty and inequa l i ty . 
17. 

Poverty reduction would have been more rapid were i t not for lagging rea l 
wages over the last decade. Creating well paying jobs has been a key government 

priority. With th is in mind, the B a n k in i t ia ted in F Y 0 7 a study en t i t led An Agenda for 
Growth and Employment w h i c h sought t o identify the re la t ionsh ip be tween economic 
g r ow t h in Mex ico , j o b creation and wage g r ow t h in order t o develop p o l i c y op t ions f o r 
the future. The study d raws o n in te rna t iona l experience and o n M e x i c o ’ s o w n experience 
by reg ion and sector. 

Basic Education 

There was steady progress towards country targets in terms of education and

we l l being. The n e t primary en ro l lmen t o f ch i ld ren in r u r a l areas increased f r o m 9 1 
percent in 2002 to 95.8 percent in 2005, suggesting that the 96 percent target m a y be 
surpassed by the end o f the CPS pe r iod . On the other hand, preliminary estimates show 
that l e s s progress i s being achieved in secondary education. Secondary te rm ina l 
e f f ic iency stood at 78.8 percent in 2004-05, making i t u n l i k e l y that the target o f 88 
percent w i l l be me t unless there i s a concerted e f fo r t . 
19. 

The key element of Bank support for education under the CPS was the 
programmatic AAA, 
including policy notes, seminars, and conferences. 
Programmatic AAA on education focused on the quality of educational outcomes. 

The objectives were to: (i) he lp build a consensus o n ways t o im p r o v e the qua l i ty o f 
education in Mex ico ; (ii) help to i d e n t i f y programs that were t o be scaled-up; and (iii) 
he lp build a consensus f o r the p u b l i c dissemination o f i n f o rm a t i o n o n such issues as 
education outcomes, the benefits o f school autonomy, and strategies f o r empowe r ing 
parents. T o that end, discussions were h e l d w i th a h igh - leve l government team. 
20. 
A first phase report, Determinants of Lea rn ing Policy No te , was published in 
FY05. I t analyzed the determinants o f lea rn ing in M e x i c o using data f r o m the OECD’s 
Programme fo r In te rna t iona l Student Assessment (PISA), and complemented the analysis 
with na t iona l assessments, as we l l as new w o r k o n the r e t u r n s t o qua l i ty and b i l i n g u a l 
education. The Bank’s focus o n q u a l i t y o f education b rough t t o the fo re the issue o f 
testing and, in 2006, the government began an annual na t iona l assessment (Prueba 
ENLACE) o f students. T o increase accountability, the results o f tes t ing have been posted 
online. The annual na t iona l assessment i s an impo r tan t achievement, marking the f i r s t 
time that the qua l i ty o f education in M e x i c o i s being assessed in a comprehensive 
manner. 

21. 
The Government i s now putting quality at the top of the agenda, with the 
creation of an independent evaluation institute and by measuring educational 
attainment through national and international assessments. Bank ana ly t ica l w o r k has 

also focused o n the qua l i ty o f education fo r disfavored groups, and in pa r t icu la r 
indigenous groups and they a re n o w mon i to red separately by the government. A 
mechanism has been put in place f o r continued dialogue o n education issues th rough a 
steering committee and meetings at the state leve l . 

49 

22. 

A second phase o f the education AAA led to a report, Mexico: Improving the 

Effectiveness of Education through Compensating for disadvantages, School-Based 
Management and Enhanced Accountability (FY06). An eva lua t ion o f key education 
programs included: (i) b i l i n g u a l education programs in ind igenous schools; (ii) 
compensatory education and i t s interface with the cond i t iona l cash transfer p rog ram 
Oportunidades; and (iii) the school-based management program, PEC. In co l labo ra t ion 
with other institutions, the B a n k organized a conference o n m o b i l i z i n g pub l ic -p r iva te 
partnerships in education, d raw ing u p o n the experience o f both developing and developed 
countries. The Bank was also ac t ive ly i n v o l v e d in meetings with government and the 
p r iva te sector, and made a presentation at a forum o n accoun tab i l i ty in education 
organized by the Instituto de Foment0 e Investigacibn Educativa , a p r iva te business 
group. The Bank continues to be ac t ive ly engaged in the sector and add i t iona l AAA on 
Secondary Educa t ion i s p lanned f o r FY08 . 
23. 
Ana ly t ic findings formed the basis o f Bank assistance for hard-to-reach 
populations th rough an APL in Bas ic Education, w h i c h n o w covers 25 percent o f schools, 
targeting those in poo r r u r a l areas. The w o r k was also used as an input to prepare and 
appraise a School-Based Management APL (FY06) 
that supports Mex ico ’s Qua l i ty 
Schools P rog ram (PEC). The p ro jec t supports Mex ico ’s Qua l i ty in Schools P rog ram 
w h i c h n o w reaches 10 percent o f schools and w h i c h seeks t o imp rove qua l i ty by 
enhancing school autonomy, accoun tab i l i ty and assessment. Support f o r access in higher 
education includes Bank assistance f o r a scholarship p rog ram f o r p o o r students and 
specific in i t ia t ives to encourage indigenous students at secondary and h ighe r l e v e l s to 
stay in school. The Te r t ia ry Education Student Assistance l o a n (FY06 ) supports the 
sustainable and equitable expansion o f tertiary education th rough student loan and grant 
programs, compensatory incentives for disadvantaged students, and the development o f a 
na t iona l te r t ia ry education p o l i c y . Progress under th is ope ra t ion has been s lowe r than 
expected due t o comp lex ins t i tu t iona l and adm in is t ra t ion arrangements f o r the use o f loan 
proceeds. 
24. 
A strategic focus o f the I F C has been t o support inves tmen t in human capital. To 
that end, IFC comm i t ted a to ta l o f US$45.9 m i l l i o n equivalent in two education sector 
projects, i n c l u d i n g (i) US$30.4 m i l l i o n f o r an affordable techn ica l university that targets 
lowe r and middle income students and (ii) US$15.5 m i l l i o n , i n c l u d i n g US$0.9 m i l l i o n in 
equity, fo r a specialized non-bank f inanc ia l i n s t i t u t i o n that focuses o n f inanc ing the 
higher education sector. The latter investment supports the development and expansion 
o f the p r iva te sector student loan market, thereby enab l ing less wea l thy students to 
finance their post-secondary education with long - te rm loans. 

Health Care 

25. 
Steady progress has been made towards health sector targets including H IV 
among the young and malaria-related morbidity. The unde r - f ive m o r t a l i t y rate 
decreased f r o m 20.5 per 1,000 births in 2003 to 15.7 pe r 1,000 births in 2007, close t o the 
target o f 15 pe r 1,000 b i r ths . The ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y rate decreased o n l y slightly t o 60 
per 100,000 births in 2006, f r o m 63.9 pe r 100,000 in 2002 and remains w e l l short o f the 
target o f 45 per 100,000 births by 2008. In that respect, however, M e x i c o i s n o d i f fe ren t 
from other M IC s , a l l o f w h i c h have found i t difficult 
t o make progress with this indicator. 

50 

26. 
Bank assistance in the health sector focused on providing continuing support 
for the 2003 reforms of the National Health L a w which established a universal 
health insurance program, the Sistema de Proteccibn Social en Sa lud (SPSS). The 
B a n k has supported increased access t o healthcare by the p o o r th rough a three-phased 
APL. The Basic Health Care Project 111 (PROCEDES), approved in June 2001 , supports 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the SPSS, spec i f ica l ly with respect to: (i) im p r o v i n g access o f the 
poo r t o the subsidized reg ime o f the Seguro Popu la r ; (ii) res t ruc tu r ing and deve lop ing the 
State H e a l t h System; and (iii) strengthening the Secretariat o f H e a l t h as steward o f the 
SPSS, Early imp lemen ta t ion p rob lems resulted f r o m unanticipated changes in the 
N a t i o n a l H e a l t h L a w w h i c h necessitated amendments to the l o a n agreement. During 
FY07, however, the p ro jec t regained i t s foo t ing and appears o n track f o r successful 
imp lemen ta t ion . Ano the r hea l th sector loan p lanned in the CPS, the H e a l t h System 
SWAP, has been postponed to FY 10. 
27. 
On the part o f IFC , investments f o r a to ta l amount o f US$19.5 m i l l i o n were made 
in two hospitals that complement the p u b l i c sector healthcare. One o f the investments 
supported a hosp i ta l that focused especially o n l ow e r income patients w h i l e the other 
fac i l i ta ted the opening o f an advanced med ica l fac i l i ty . 
28. 
There was progress in efforts to provide broader access for low-income 
households to housing and land ownership. At the s ta r t o f the F o x administration, the 
Government undertook t o double the p roduc t ion o f formal-sector hous ing t o 750,000 
hous ing un i ts a year by 2006; a goa l that was achieved by 2004. A m a j o r success story 
has been the r o l e o f Sofoles, specialized non-deposit taking f inanc ia l institutions, 
supported by the Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), w h i c h was chartered in 2001 as a 
federal development bank. These specialized f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions have made over 
850,000 mortgage loans over the last ten years. 
29. 
The Bank i s supporting broader access to low-income housing and land 
ownership with a three phase Housing and Urban Programmatic DPL as well as 
TAL operations. The f i r s t US$lOO m i l l i o n loan, w h i c h closed in December 2004, 
supported: (i) the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f a n ew na t iona l hous ing p o l i c y and 
accompanying ins t i tu t iona l arrangements; (ii) the establishment o f home loans f o r low 
and moderate-income groups; and (iii) i n i t i a l steps t o harmonize housing subsidies and 
mode rn ize urban p rope r ty reg is t ra t ion systems. In parallel, a coordinated na t iona l u rban 
development p o l i c y was developed and imp lemen ted at the federal and l o c a l leve ls , with 
a focus o n strengthening institutions and deve lop ing land f o r low - income housing. 
A c c o r d i n g t o an IEG evaluation o f the f i r s t phase, the p ro jec t was mode ra te ly satisfactory 
and i t s objectives were pa r t ia l ly achieved. The second hous ing loan, w h i c h closed in 
June 2006, consolidated and deepened re fo rms made under the f i r s t loan. A TAL was 
approved in Novembe r 2004. I t i s proceeding w e l l and there has been good progress in 
the sector. The percentage o f hous ing destined f o r lowe r income groups (households 
earning l e s s than five times the minimum wage) increased f r om 49 percent in 2005 t o 53 
percent in 2006. A third phase o f the D P L p rog ram was presented t o the B o a r d in the 
f i r s t h a l f o f FY08 . I t focused o n hous ing subsidy r e f o m , the ma ins t ream ing o f hous ing

International competitiveness rankings improved over the CPS period. 
M e x i c o c l imbed significantly in the Bank's D o i n g Business index and, in 2008, was

ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses. 

Bank Support with Programmatic M A 

34. 
The Bank's programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA had its origins 
in an ea r l ie r collaboration with the Government on issues o f competitiveness. The 
Bank wo rked with the O f f i c e o f the President t o assist the Government in defining a 
na t iona l Competitiveness Agenda 2004-06. The success o f this assistance led to the 
elaboration o f the P rog ramma t ic Competitiveness and Trade AAA f o r FY05 -FY08 , 
w h i c h sought to b roaden t h e dialogue o n competitiveness t o stakeholders beyond the 
executive and the p r iva te sector.

36. 
A report was published for both the first and second phases of the 
programmatic AAA. The two -vo lume f i r s t phase report, Mex ico 's Challenge of 
Knowledge-based Competitiveness: Challenges and Oppo r tun i t ies , argued that M e x i c o 
had to act now t o t a k e advantage o f the opportunities arising f r om the know ledge

Education for Greater Innovation 

39. 
The Government has made progress in innovation and education to make the 
workforce more competitive. Building o n the 2002 lega l f ramewo rk , M e x i c o has 
established 25 science and techno logy councils at the state level. T h e number o f 
researchers in the na t iona l research system (Sistema Nac iona l de Investigadores, SNZ) has 
grown at an average rate o f 10 percent, increasing f r o m 7,466 in 2000 t o 12,096 in 2005. 
Pub l ic funding t o S N I increased by 13.5 percent in 2005, representing a quarter o f 
CONACYT‘s budget. The Bank has been supporting these e f fo r ts through t h e Innova t ion 
fo r Competitiveness A P L I (FY06) w h i c h aims t o consolidate ongo ing sector re fo rms in 
science and technology by strengthening programs fo r business innova t ion and human 
capital development. That includes: (i) p r om o t i n g business innova t ion ; (ii) financing 
scholarships; and (iii) supporting po l ic ies t o strengthen the f ramewo rk f o r science, 
technology and innova t ion and foster in te rna t iona l linkages. In addition, Bank education 
loans w i l l boost long - run competitiveness by t ra in ing a mo re skilled wo rk fo rce . 

Infrastructure 

40. 
Significant advances have been made in the provision o f roads, electricity, 
and water, though gaps persist in poor, rural and indigenous communities. The 
Bank has been supporting e f fo r ts t o expand the coverage and qua l i ty o f roads through the 
Decentralized Infrastructure Development L o a n (FY04, US$108 m i l l ion ) , a state l e v e l 
loan w h i c h p rov ides f inanc ing t o the State o f Guanajuato t o strengthen i t s in f ras t ruc tu re

analyzed the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c infrastructure spending in water 
supply and sanitation, transport and electricity. 
41. During the CPS period, 
I F C supported Government e f fo r ts t o encourage 
investments in infrastructure w i th the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f the p r iva te sector. 
I F C p rov ided

Financial Intermediation 

42. 
Mex ico has made g rea t strides towards consolidating the f inanc ia l sector and 
has in t roduced re fo rms to increase competition. Since the f i r s t debt c r is is o f 1982 and 
the effects o f the f inanc ia l crisis o f 1994-95, M e x i c o has gone th rough a l o n g process o f 
f inanc ia l sector res t ruc tu r ing and consolidation. G r ow t h o f the f inanc ia l sector i s 
accelerating with increased competition. In the banking sector, the re i s s t i l l a need f o r 
changes to the C red i t Ins t i tu t ions L aw . In the non -bank ing sector there i s a need t o 
deregulate Sofoles and adjust the laws re la t ing t o t rus t , insurance and pens ion funds. In 
the b o n d market, n ew debt ins t rumen ts a re making i t easier to ob ta in f inanc ing by issuing 
domestic debt, while the Securities Law passed in December 2006 i s expected t o imp rove 
the func t ion ing o f the stock market. The m a i n Bank ins t rumen t f o r support t o the 
f inanc ia l sector was the Finance and G r ow t h DPL (FY06). That operation supported a 
series o f f inanc ia l sector reforms, i n c l u d i n g the Securities L a w and strengthened 
oversight by corporate boards. Th is D P L replaced the Access to F i n a n c i a l Services 
p ro jec t o r i g i n a l l y p lanned f o r F Y 0 7 in the CPS. The 2006 update t o the F inanc ia l Sector 
Assessment P rog ram (FSAP) p rov ided ana ly t ica l support t o other reforms, i n c l u d i n g the 
B a n k i n g Reso lu t ion L aw . In FY08 , the SHCP has asked the Bank t o undertake a study o f 
compe t i t ion in the banking sector. The p r i n c i p a l findings o f the study, w h i c h covered 
such top ics as the performance o f development banks, access to finance by SMEs, and 
micro-insurance, were presented t o the Government in December 2007 and January 2008. 
43. 
T h e B a n k G r o u p has also supported access to f inanc ia l services b y sectors 
underserved b y comme rc ia l banks . The US$505.1 m i l l i o n R u r a l F inance SAL (FY03) 
supported the l iqu ida t ion o f B a n r u r a l and the creation o f F inanc ie ra R u r a l , a 
decentralized f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ion in charge o f p r om o t i n g the development o f r u r a l 
f inanc ia l markets and lend ing t o sma l l and medium r u r a l producers. The' p ro jec t also 
supported the Government 's broader goal o f reduc ing the f isca l d ra in o f loss -mak ing 
banks, while enhancing access t o f inanc ia l services for sectors n o t served by comme rc ia l 
banks. A c c o r d i n g t o an IEG evaluation, as a r e s u l t o f the project, the Government has 
made m a j o r inroads in r e f o rm i n g the r u r a l finance ma rke t and in res t ruc tu r ing the 
f inanc ia l sector. IEG rated the p ro jec t highly satisfactory. The second phase o f the 
Savings and R u r a l F inance Project (BANSEFI) has he lped the Government strengthen 
mo re than 400 l o c a l savings and c red i t ins t i tu t ions and p lace them o n a sound financial 
footing, thereby a f f o r d i n g many low - income fam i l ies with access t o f inanc ia l services 
that they w o u l d o the rw ise n o t enjoy. 
44. 
IFC has complemented Bank assistance in the f inanc ia l sector with support in a 
to ta l amount o f US$578.8 million over the p e r i o d FY 0 5 - 0 8 f o r mortgages (including 
securitization), microfinance, banks, trade, and p r iva te equity funds. Making use o f 
advisory se rv ices when appropriate, I F C focused o n p r om o t i n g access to f inanc ia l 
services f o r underserved re ta i l e n t i t i e s while, in the case o f the corporate sector, helping 
increase the access o f MSMEs t o debt and equ i ty finance. 
In addition, IFC helped 
develop the market for education finance by investing in a mo r tgage institution (Sofol) 
that specializes in the education sector. 
45. 
T h e housing finance m a r k e t has expanded r ap id l y in recent years. The 
Federal Mo r tgage Agency, SHF , has fostered the development o f Sofoles, special 
purpose, non-deposit p r iva te c red i t institutions, and has established the lega l and 

56 

regu la to ry f ramewo rk f o r a f lou r ish ing secondary mortgage market. The Bank supported 
the strengthening and expansion o f the p r iva te mortgage ma rke t th rough the FOV I 
Res t ruc tu r ing project (US$505.1 m i l l i o n , approved FY99), w h i c h extended support to the 
Banking Finance Fund f o r Housing (FOVr) and t o i t s successor ins t i tu t ion the SHF. The 
I C R f o r t h i s operation listed many accomplishments i n c l u d i n g assisting a p rog ram o f 
mortgage lending f r o m 2000 t o 2005 that financed some 290,000 mortgages f o r a to ta l 
value o f U S $ 7 b i l l i o n equivalent. Since 2004, the SHF has supported asset-backed 
securities with guarantees fo r timely payment. 
46. 
I F C has p rov ided f h d i n g and technical assistance t o hous ing sector Sofoles and 
other mortgage providers, and i t has con t inued t o fac i l i ta te the development o f a 
secondary mortgage market development. 
I F C support has inc luded remittance-backed 
mortgages, warehousing lines, pa r t ia l credit guarantees and technical and adv iso ry 
assistance. Since the SHF i s scheduled t o stop d i rec t funding f o r Sofoles in the coming 
years, I FC ' s efforts have been geared towards enab l ing Sofoles t o seek fhd ing f r o m the 
market on their o w n account and continue p r o v i d i n g affordable mortgages t o M e x i c a n 
homeowners. 

Pillar 111 Strengthening Institutions 

Overview 

47. 
During the CPS period there was a further development and consolidation o f 
democratic institutions. The p res iden t ia l elections o f 2006 resulted in a very na r row 
electoral v i c t o r y that i n i t i a l l y p rovoked strong protest and resistance f r o m the defeated 
candidate. The strengthening o f democratic ins t i tu t ions i s a declared ob jec t ive o f 
President Calderon. Specific measures to strengthen the democratic f ramewo rk have 
fo l lowed . In June 2007, fo r example, Congress approved a cons t i tu t iona l amendment 
m a k i n g access to in fo rma t ion a cons t i tu t iona l ly protected c i v i l right. 
48. 
The strengthening o f democratic ins t i tu t ions did n o t immed ia te ly lead t o a 
corresponding imp rovemen t in governance indicators. M e x i c o ' s ranking o n the WBI 
Governance Indicators-Voice 
and Accoun tab i l i ty , Government Effectiveness, C o n t r o l 
o f Corruption-have 
n o t changed in s ta t is t ica l ly s ign i f ican t t e rm s . Mex ico 's ranking in 
the V o i c e and Accoun tab i l i ty ind ica to r decreased t o the 52"d percentile in 2006, f r o m the 
55th pe rcen t i le in 2002, making i t unlikely that i t w i l l attain the CPS 70th pe rcen t i le target 
by 2008. The same applies t o other governance indicators f o r w h i c h benchmarks we re 
specified in the CPS. In retrospect i t w o u l d appear that the pe rcen t i le ranking within the 
f ramewo rk o f WBI indicators does n o t constitute an appropriate target f o r i n d i v i d u a l 
countries because the outcome also depends u p o n the performance o f a l l other countries 
across the board.

Public Finance Management 

49. 
Strong institutions must be based on the sound management of public 
finances and the Bank has assisted in that endeavor with programmatic AAA, 
structured in three phases. The B a n k assisted the Secretariat o f F inance and Pub l ic 
C red i t (SHCP ) th rough fee-based ana ly t ica l services a imed at the mode rn iza t ion and 
r e f o rm o f p u b l i c finances. The Bank also supported the federal p u b l i c finances r e f o rm 

agenda through the Convencidn N a c i o n a l Hacenda r ia (CNH ) and the Review of Fede ra l 
Government Procurement, F i n a n c i a l Management and Disbursement Systems (FY06). 

This repo r t evaluated the feas ib i l i ty o f using coun t ry systems within W o r l d Bank 
financed operations. Progress on the recommendations o f the repo r t has been m i x e d t o 
date. However, there has been progress in B a n k - ID B collaboration, especially with 
regard t o p ro jec t procurement and f inanc ia l management. 
States now have an enhanced ro l e within Mex ico ’s decentralized fiscal 
framework, they were the focus of important programmatic AAA. 
In FY05 , the 

Bank completed the State-Level Techn ica l Assistance 
t o Es tab l ish Performance 
Ind ica to rs fo r Procurement, P u b l i c Expend i tu re and F i n a n c i a l Management report. This

Im p r o v i n g F i s c a l Transparency and Adm in is t ra t ive 

assessed the performance o f sub-national f iduc ia ry systems, with the a i m o f p r o v i d i n g 
state governments with a t o o l f o r assessing their performance. 
In F Y 0 6 the B a n k 
p roduced another 
report, 
Performance at the State Leve l , w h i c h was designed as a p o l i c y no te f o r the n ew federal 
administration. A l t h o u g h the recommended state indicators have yet t o b e systematically 
adopted, the w o r k done by the Bank has g iven an impu lse t o reexamine state-level 
accounting and to ha rmon ize reporting. 
In 2006, the I n s t i t u t e fo r the Techn ica l 
development o f Pub l ic Finances ( INDETEC ) , a p u b l i c en t i ty o f the N a t i o n a l System o f

outcomes o f this w o r k has been an IDF grant to the State o f Aguascalientes,

which aims to build capacity f o r ha rmon ized accounting systems. I t i s also supportive o f

An Institutional Governance Review (IGR) was completed in FY07. The IGR 
responded t o a pe rcep t ion that the pace o f economic re fo rms has s lowed in recent years 
and i t considers h o w Mex ico ’s democratic governance m a y b e strengthened over time. I t 
was also designed t o fac i l i ta te the coun t ry dialogue during the p o l i t i c a l t rans i t ion and t o 
con t r ibu te t o the ongo ing debate o n p o l i t i c a l governance. The repo r t has o n l y recen t ly 
been pub l ished and i t i s too ea r ly t o assess i t s impact. A P u b l i c Expend i tu re Review PER 
(FY05) concentrated o n ove ra l l f isca l sustainability, rigidities in expenditure, the 
d is t r ibu t ion o f benefits o f pub l ic spending between households by income leve l , the 
reg iona l d is t r ibu t ion o f spending, and the ins t i tu t ions f o r budgeting and expenditure 
management. O the r outputs inc lude : (i) State Pension Suwey ; (ii) Coun t ry F i n a n c i a l 
Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA ) ; and (iii) Coun t ry Procurement Assessment Report 
(CPAR). The State Pension Suwey examined the sus ta inab i l i ty o f state-level sponsored 
c iv i l -se rv ice pens ion schemes, as these schemes are becom ing a m a j o r f isca l burden o n 
state p u b l i c finances. A C P AR update was ca r r ied ou t during F Y 0 7 and was de l ive red in 
FY 0 8 . At the request o f the new government, i t focuses o n issues o f procurement. C F A A 
resources were re-allocated to the Accoun t ing and Budgetary Ha rmon iza t ion Study 
(FY08-09), g iven the prominence o f this issue within Mex ico ’s p u b l i c finances. 
52. 
The Bank actively supported the Convencidn Nac iona l Hacenda r ia (CNH ) , a 
six-month symposium which aimed to bring about a national consensus o n reforms 
to the fiscal system at a l l three levels o f government. In August 2004 a f i n a l mee t ing 
o f the Conven t ion endorsed a number o f r e f o rm proposals, w h i c h inc luded the devo lu t ion 
o f sales tax to states and municipalities, r e f o rm o f the tax regime o f the na t iona l o i l 
company, PEMEX, and the r e f o rm o f the p u b l i c pens ion system. The B a n k was invited 
to p rov ide p o l i c y papers and strategy notes f o r the CNH and B a n k s t a f f commented o n 
the emerging agenda, focus ing o n key issues o f transfer design, tax assignment and 
transparency in repo r t ing . The Bank also helped organize a seminar o f federalism experts 
w h i c h was broadcast l ive to Congress and t o 3 0 campuses o f Mon te r rey Techn ica l 
U n i v e r s i t y and, together with USAID, rev iewed proposals that were made during the 
CNH. A f t e r the closure o f the CNH, the B a n k p rov ided f o l l ow - u p support, i n c l u d i n g 
non - lend ing techn ica l assistance concerning the des ign o f ind ica to rs f o r state-level

add i t iona l support f o r the ha rmon iza t ion accounting and budge t ing at the federal, state 
and m u n i c i p a l levels, a goa l that was embraced both by the CNH and in the 2007-12 
Na t iona l Deve lopmen t Plan o f the Calder6n administration.

p e n s i o n re form , a n d t o under take needed techn ica l w o r k . 

54. 
The Bank has also made loans in support of the government’s efforts to 
enhance f isca l management. The CPS envisaged a SAL in support o f Strengthening 
Pub l ic Finances but this was dropped when the government p repa id a numbe r o f Bank 
loans and reduced i t s estimated need for add i t iona l qu ick -d isbu rs ing B a n k finance. 
Instead, a loan i s envisaged f o r F Y 0 9 in support o f improved tax adm in is t ra t ion that 
w o u l d f o l l ow up o n the ongo ing Tax Adm in is t ra t ion Ins t i tu t iona l Development p ro jec t 
that was approved in FY 0 2 . Imp lemen ta t ion o f that p ro jec t i s proceeding well. By mid- 
2007, the taxpayer base had been increased f r o m 7.5 m i l l i o n t o almost 9 m i l l i o n and the 
cost o f tax co l lec t ion had b e e n reduced f r om 1.43 cents pe r peso co l lec ted t o 1.17 cents. 

55. 
The Bank has also supported efforts to strengthen fiscal management at the 
loca l level. A mode rn iza t ion o f the p rope r ty registry was supported th rough a Hous ing 
U rban S t ruc tu ra l Adjustment L o a n (HU S A L ) and a Techn ica l Ad jus tmen t L o a n 
(HUTAL), w h i c h emphasized the need t o articulate a na t iona l strategy and establish a 
new m o d e l fo r p rope r ty registries. The strategy and the m o d e l have been de f ined and 
imp lemen ta t ion has begun. In addition, a contract t o p rov ide fee-for-service advice f o r 
the mode rn iza t ion o f the Federal D i s t r i c t Registry was signed in FY 0 7 . 

56. While there was good progress on the public financial management program, 
some planned justice related activities have been postponed o r dropped. 
Nevertheless, a State Jud ic ia l Mode rn iza t ion l o a n was approved in F Y 0 5 f o r US $ 3 0

T h e B a n k made use o f p rog ramma t ic AAA as the ins t rumen t o f choice fo r

de l ive red in FY06 , p rov ides analysis and recommendations t o better understand the 
options f o r imp lemen t ing the n ew water sector l aw . The ana ly t ica l w o r k has im p r o v e d 
understanding o f the imp l ica t ions o f p o l i c y in te rven t ions and enhanced p u b l i c awareness 
o f the seriousness o f water issues. M e x i c o faces a numbe r o f challenges, including the 
need t o address the ove rexp lo i ta t ion o f water resources, as m o r e than 50 percent o f the 
groundwater u t i l i z e d in the coun t ry comes f r om ove rexp lo i ted aquifers, a s i tua t ion w h i c h 
i s n o t sustainable in the long-run. There i s need t o review po l ic ies and subsidies in terms 
o f the i r long - te rm impac t and t o reorient them t o support sustainable water resource 
management. 
In add i t ion there i s a need t o focus o n wa te r access fo r those w i thou t 
service o r with limited access. 
61. 
T h e CPS p lanned a series o f loans to accompany the p rog ramma t ic AAA, no t 
a l l of wh ich have ma te r ia l ized . The Mode rn iza t ion of Water and San i ta t ion TAL 
(US$25 m i l l ion ) , approved in FY06 , ass is ts in deve lop ing the too ls and instruments f o r

in i t ia l ly suffered f r o m a lack o f counterpart funding, but plans are n o w under w a y t o use 

the remaining hnds o f the loan during 2008. The Env i ronmen ta l Services p ro jec t (US$45 

m i l l i o n plus US$15 m i l l i o n GEF), approved in FY06 , aims t o enhance the p r o v i s i o n o f

sustainability. E x i s t i n g programs w o u l d be strengthened and expanded and l o c a l 
payments f o r environmental services w o u l d be in t roduced in selected p i l o t areas. 
62. 
Ongoing operations in the water sector a re proceeding satisfactorily. The 

Decen t ra l ized Infrastructure Reform and Development P ro jec t (US$108 million), 
in the 

approved 
in FY04 , supports operational 
improvements and 
investment 
mun ic ipa l i t ies o f the State o f Guanajuato. T o date, average e f f ic iency o f water and 
sanitation services has increased, and 43 percent o f m u n i c i p a l water operators have 
extended the i r service by 10 percent o r more. The In teg ra ted I r r i g a t i o n Mode rn iza t ion 
(US$303 m i l l i o n ) project, approved in FY04 , assists the Government t o adopt a new 
m o d e l to imp rove the competitiveness o f irrigated agriculture and the e f f ic ien t use o f

coo rd ina t ion within the p u b l i c sector, and the adop t ion o f a demand-driven approach t o 
investment. 
63. 
There has been progress in terms of reaching the CPS quantitative targets 
for the water sector. The numbe r o f pa r t ic ipa to ry water bas in councils in operation 
increased f r om 1 in 2001 t o 16 in 2004. The number o f groundwater committees 
ope ra t ing increased t o 4 1 in 2004, exceeding the goa l o f 40 by the end o f the CPS pe r iod . 
Access t o water and sanitation has also increased. Some 88 percent o f the popu la t ion n o w 
has access t o sa fe water and 85 percent t o sewer services in 2005, reach ing o r surpassing 
the m e d i um - t e r n coun t ry targets o f 88 percent and 78 percent respectively. Howeve r , 
ove rd rawn aquifers continue t o be a p rob lem . 

The Institutional Framework for Environmental Sustainability 

64. 
The main instrument used by the Bank for supporting principles of 
sustainable development in M e x i c o was a Programmatic Environmental DPL. The 
government has made good progress in ma ins t ream ing sustainability p r inc ip les and the 
B a n k has supported this agenda since 2002 through a Programmatic Env i ronmen ta l DPL. 
The f i r s t phase has n o w been completed and a second l o a n (US$200.5 million) was 
approved 
in FY06 . An Env i ronmen ta l Ma ins t ream ing Agenda 
f o r Sustainable 
Deve lopmen t (Agenda de T ransve rsa l idad ) has n o w been adopted in energy, water, 
fo res t ry and tou r ism with a view t o im p r o v i n g t h e e f f ic iency and effectiveness o f l o c a l 
env i ronmen ta l management. 
65. 
The second phase of the Environmental DPL supported the development of 
legal and regulatory frameworks, consolidating and deepening the impact of 
reforms. Progress t o date o n the lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk includes amendments 
t o the Water L a w (approved in 2004), the enactment o f a General L a w f o r Sustainable 
Fo res t ry Deve lopmen t and the passage o f the Ley General p a r a l a P revenc ibn y Gestibn

66. 
A number of GEF and PCF grants have been made in support of measures to 
reduce air pollution, improve solid waste management, promote clean energy 
technologies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. N e w projects undertaken during 
the CPS pe r iod re la te t o Me thane Gas Capture, Large Scale Renewable Energy, and 
C l ima te F r iend ly Measures in Transport. The Me thane Gas Cap tu re p ro jec t has 
supported the design, construction, and ope ra t ion o f the f i rs t ever methane gas p ow e r

To date, approx 0.9 m i l l i o n tons o f C 0 2 equivalent have been e l im ina ted as a resu l t o f

The GEF and PCF have also funded renewable energy projects which have 
contributed to a reduction in pollution. In 2005 cons t ruc t ion was begun o n L a Venta 11,

Forestry 

68. 
The Bank supported Mex ico ’s efforts to address deforestation through the 
ongoing Community Forestry 11 loan. The f i r s t Community Fo res t ry project, which 
closed in F Y 0 4 supported the Government’s na tu ra l resource management strategy and 
increased the scope o f forestry-based income. An in te rna t iona l seminar o n commun i ty

w h i c h p rov ides i n f o rm a t i o n o n such issues as forest inventories, data o n plantations, 
i n f o rm a t i o n o n forest f i r e prevention, pes t control, and legislation. The Community 
Fo res t ry 11 p ro jec t (FY04) has assisted indigenous commun i t ies and ejidos (commun i ty 
managed lands) t o strengthen commun i ty ties and better manage their forest resources in 
order to diversify forest-based production, create and strengthen c omm u n i t y enterprises 
and increase incomes. P ro jec t progress has gene ra l ly been good, although slower than 
expected in some components. A third phase, planned f o r FY09 , w o u l d extend the

IV . OVERALL BANK PERFORMANCE 

A. The Lending Program 

69. 
The CPS was predicated on the premise that Bank lending to middle income 
countries must be flexible and responsive to changing country circumstances. 
Hence , a discrepancy o f detailed content be tween the i n i t i a l CPS p rog ram and actual 
outcomes i s not, in i t s e l f , a cause f o r concern. Howeve r , the lend ing p rog ram f o l l ow e d 
an unforeseen stepwise pa th ove r the pe r iod FY05 -08 . T h e f i rs t t w o years o f lending in 
FY 0 5 - 0 6 were b r o a d l y consistent with the recent past and with the CPS. 
In FY07 , 
however, there was an abrupt d rop in lending with o n l y one l o a n being approved f o r an 
amount o f US$29 m i l l i o n . The ou t look f o r F Y 0 8 i s f o r a somewhat m o r e active lending 
program but the t o t a l i s unlikely t o be m u c h mo re than one quarter o f the US$1,200 
million envisaged in the base case scenario o f the CPS.

70. 
Th e r e a re several reasons fo r the ab rup t FY 0 7 d rop in lending. The elections 
o f 2006 were a source o f exceptional unce r ta in ty in M e x i c o and many adm in is t ra t ive and 
p ro jec t decisions were “put o n hold”. The Government made use o f buoyan t fo re ign 
exchange reserves t o prepay loans from the Bank and the IDB. Prepayments t o the Bank 
in an amount o f US$5 .1 b i l l i o n reduced the country’s outstanding IBRD debt by 56 
percent f r om the outstanding balance o f US$9 .1 b i l l i o n as o f September 2006. A c c o r d i n g 
t o the analysis o f IMF staff, the prepayment operation l e f t unchanged “ the net external 

debt and the net domestic debt of the consolidated p u b l i c sector, w h i l e gene ra t ing interest 
savings (essentially because the interest cost of 
the p repa id external debt exceeded the 

interest earnings on NIR)”. l3 In te rna t iona l r a t i n g agencies have praised the government 
f o r rep lac ing fo re ign currency with l o c a l debt and have upgraded i t s sovereign c red i t 
rating. W h i l e the prepayment was n o t spec i f ica l ly t i e d t o any change o f plan w i th respect 
t o new b o r r ow i n g f r om the Bank, i t c lea r ly affected the ove ra l l dynam ic o f the 
relationship. Furthermore, the Bank i t s e l f was go ing th rough an unsettling p e r i o d at the 
time w i th the resignation o f the president and a change o f coun t ry d i rec to r and that m a y 
also have impac ted the program. 
71. 
The prepayment o f IBRD loans and the F Y 0 7 d rop in lend ing does n o t presage a 
rupture in the Bank’s relationship with M e x i c o but rather a change in the dynam ic o f that 
relationship. 
There i s s t i l l an active p o r t f o l i o o f Bank-supported projects being 
imp lemen ted as w e l l as an active p rog ram o f AAA a l l o f w h i c h engender a b road range 
o f Bank -c l ien t relationships at b o t h the operational and p o l i c y levels. There i s , therefore, 
fe r t i le g round f o r res to r ing a p rog ram o f s ign i f ican t size consistent with coun t ry 
requirements. 
72. 
Furthermore, the Bank has b e e n and remains p r ice -compe t i t ive as a source o f 
external finance f o r Mex ico . D iag ram 1 b e l ow shows that the yield o n M e x i c a n 
government bonds issued in 2005 and 2006 was s ign i f ican t ly higher than the charges o n 
Bank loans. Hence B a n k presented a cheaper alternative source o f finance for the 
government.

F o r i t s part, I F C sharpened i t s focus o n high impac t areas, responding to the 
upg rad ing o f Mex ico ’s sovereign credit ratings and the re tu rn o f liquidity in the M e x i c a n 
market. 
I F C comm i tmen ts were US$266.0 m i l l i o n pe r year o n average in FY05 -07 , 
f o l l ow i n g the h is to r ic high o f US$447 m i l l i o n reached in F Y 0 4 when demand f o r IFC ’s 
assistance was elevated due t o the scarcity o f long - te rm f inanc ing caused by a cap i ta l 
retreat f r om L a t i n Ame r ica in the preceding years. S im i la r ly , funding f r o m international 
banks th rough the B l o a n p rog ram decreased s ign i f ican t ly during this period t o US$17.5 
m i l l i o n . 
75. 
Total lending in FYOS-OS reached US$2.7 billion through the first half of 
F Y O S . I t i s d i f f i c u l t t o compare planned and actual outcomes f o r lend ing by p i l la rs 
because m a n y operations serve m u l t i p l e objectives. Subject t o that reservation, however, 
i t w o u l d appear that actual lending operations f o r the pove r ty and competitiveness p i l la rs 
were close to planned levels, but lend ing f o r the environment pillar was s ign i f ican t ly l e s s 
than o r i g i n a l l y envisaged. T w o loans p rog rammed f o r FY07 , Wa ter P o l i c y Deve lopmen t 
DPL & TAL, and Water R igh ts were dropped and a third, Env i ronmen ta l Managemen t , 
has been postponed to FY 10. 
76. 
There were significant differences between planned GEF and PCF grants 
and actual deliveries during the CPS period. O f ten p lanned ac t iv i t ies f o r FY05 -08 , 
three have been dropped but, at the s am e time, several p ro jec ts that were n o t planned in 
the CPS have been approved in F Y 0 6 and a re p lanned f o r F Y 0 7 and FY 0 8 . Th is 
discrepancy i s consistent with operational needs in cutting-edge areas where the 
requirements o f the c l ien t coun t ry a re constantly reassessed o n the basis o f experience in 
the field. M o r e impo r tan t ly , outcomes o f the ac t iv i t ies supported by GEF and PCF grants 
have been generally very pos i t ive . 

B. Portfolio Quality 

77. 
The quality of the portfolio was satisfactory throughout the CPS period. The 
disbursement ra t io averaged 28 percent during the f i rs t three yea rs covered by the CPS. 
This was h ighe r than the reg iona l average f o r F Y 0 5 and FY06 , and rose considerably in 
FY06 , t o 35 percent, in part because o f fou r development p o l i c y loans disbursed that 
year. The statistics f o r p r o b l em projects, projects at risk and comm i tmen ts at risk are in 
general better than the reg iona l average. 
78. 
Since March 2004 the average lag between loan approval and loan 
effectiveness was 8.8 months which i s somewhat higher than the Regional average of 
8.2 months. F o l l o w i n g the Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performance Rev iews (CPPR) conducted 
in F Y 0 5 and FY06 , actions have been taken t o speed up p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion and 
effectiveness. 
79. 
The portfolio had four problem projects of which three pre-dated the 2004 
CAS. There were also s ign i f ican t cancellations during the CPS period, with US $ 5 9 6m 
cancelled in FY05 , the second highest amount in the Bank in that year. O f pa r t icu la r 
significance were cancellations re la t ing t o a m u n i c i p a l development p ro jec t and an e- 
business project.

C. Programmatic Advisory and Analytical Activities (AAA) 

82. 
The CPS gave prominence to AAA in keeping with the Bank’s M I C strategy. 
The Government’s reform agenda provided the key point of departure for AAA. 

The p rog ramma t ic structure resulted in a coherent approach t o ana ly t ic w o r k and 

69 

fac i l i ta ted the process o f debate and consensus with respect t o the r e f o rm agenda. The 
Government has recognized the h igh -qua l i ty o f Bank analysis. The ca ta ly t ic r o l e o f the 
Bank and the increasingly pa r t ic ipa to ry nature o f AAA have l e d t o greater ownership o f 
the recommendations by key stakeholders. The b road f ramewo rk o f the ana ly t ica l 
agenda has also l e d t o correspondingly b road exchanges between the Bank, government 
o f f ic ia ls , M e x i c a n academia and other institutions. S ign i f ican t e f fo r ts we re made during 
the CPS pe r iod t o imp rove dissemination, with several reports widely disseminated and 
debated. A n a l y t i c w o r k p rov ided opportunities f o r stocktaking and ra is ing awareness o f 
k e y issues , as well as p o i n t i n g the w a y t o approaches that c o u l d b e adopted by the 
Government. The number o f AAA translated i n t o Spanish increased and, in many 
instances when reports were n o t translated, the executive summaries were. This i s a 
ma rked improvement compared with past W o r l d Bank ana ly t ica l w o r k f o r M e x i c o w h i c h 
p rev ious ly suffered f r om weak dissemination and limited translation o f  report^.'^

0 . Fee-based Services 

83. 
The CPS foresaw a continued use of fee-based services. 
In the CPS period, 
paid advisory services were undertaken in support o f (i) ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm o f t o l l roads 
(FY06-07); (ii) analysis o f the mortgage ma rke t at the request o f the Sociedad 
Hipotecaria Federal (FY06); (iii) the Government o f the Federal D i s t r i c t in i t s e f fo r ts t o 
improve competitiveness (FY06); and (iv) mode rn iza t ion o f the accoun t ing i n f o rm a t i o n 
system f o r SHCP (FY06). There are likely t o be add i t iona l adv iso ry services be fo re the 
end o f the CPS pe r iod . The steady increase in the p r o v i s i o n o f fee-based services has 
been c l ien t -d r iven and i s ind ica t ive o f the client’s high rega rd f o r the b read th and dep th 
o f international experience that the Bank i s able t o bring t o the table. 

E. Safeguards and Fiduciary 

84. 
The CPS expressed the desire o f the Bank and the government to move 
towards greater reliance on country processes 
in procurement, financial 
management and safeguards. Coun t ry sys tems a re already b e i n g used in mos t areas o f 
p ro jec t f inanc ia l management and partially emp loyed in procurement, and the Bank i s 
con t inu ing t o w o r k w i th the government and the In te r -Ame r ican Deve lopmen t Bank

have p a r t i a l l y emp loyed the Government’s systems. 

F. Financial Instruments 

85. 
Co l labo ra t ion with the Government during the p rev ious C A S and the current CPS 
p e r i o d has focused o n the use o f the Bank ’s m e n u o f lend ing and non - lend ing products t o 
manage the Government’s f inanc ia l r i s k s within the con tex t o f Mex ico ’s sovereign debt 
management strategy. In this regard, the Bank and the Government have f ina l ized the 
nego t ia t ion o f a Mas te r De r iva t ive Agreement (MDA), t o b e signed ea r ly in 2008, w h i c h 
w i l l enhance M e x i c o ’ s capacity t o manage the f inanc ia l r i s k s in i t s debt p o r t f o l i o by 
having access t o a range o f Bank hedging products. These products can be used n o t o n l y 
f o r Bank obligations, but also t o manage the f inanc ia l r i s k s o f other sovereign l iab i l i t ies . 
In addition, a high p r i o r i t y was g iven t o the u s e o f W o r l d Bank f inanc ia l products in 
order t o t rans fo rm the B a n k ob l iga t ion o f M e x i c a n States and l o c a l governments i n t o 
M e x i c a n Pesos, and p r o v i d i n g access to Bank funding and techn ica l assistance through 
on - lend ing p rog rams v i a Mex ico ’s na t iona l development banks. 
86. 
Mex ico was the first country, bo th reg iona l ly as w e l l as globally, to take 
advantage o f the W o r l d Bank ’s loca l cu r rency f inanc ing fac i l ity . So far the l o a n 
agreements f o r the following projects have emp loyed this feature: 

the Decentralized 
Infrastructure Reform and Development and State J u d i c i a l Mode rn iza t ion (bo th approved 
in FY04), and a U S $ 9 million component o f the Te r t ia ry Educa t ion Student Assistance 

(approved in F Y 0 6 but dropped in FY07). In a l l th ree cases, the u l t ima te bene f ic ia ry o f 
the W o r l d Bank’s f inanc ing i s not the Federal Government, but M e x i c a n states w h i c h can 
access l o n g t e r m peso f inanc ing at compe t i t ive terms th rough this arrangement. By end- 
2007, fou r disbursements in pesos had been made equivalent to US$88 m i l l i o n f o r the 

Decen t ra l ized Reform and Development P ro jec t , a l l ow i n g the Government o f the State o f 

Guanajuato t o ob ta in l o c a l currency fbnding with a f i n a l m a t u r i t y o f 18 years and a 3- 
year grace pe r iod . P r i c i n g was referenced t o 182-day Ce r tz jkados de l Tesoro (Le., 6- 
month M e x i c a n Treasury rate) with a f i x e d spread based o n market cond i t ions when the 
l o a n disbursements took place. 
87. 
In the course o f the CPS pe r iod and with buoyan t fo re ign exchange reserves the 
government became inc reas ing ly cost conscious with respect t o b o r r ow i n g f r om abroad. 
F inanc ia l cost issues were one factor con t r ibu t ing t o the reduc t ion in Bank lending at a 
time when M e x i c o enjoyed buoyan t fo re ign exchange reserves. In September 2007 the 
B a n k s im p l i f i e d i t s loan s truc ture and cut lending rates with the in ten t o f making the 
Bank “better, faster and cheaper”. A s a result, the average cost saving i s about 17 basis 
points f o r DPLs and 32 basis po in ts f o r inves tmen t loans, with the p rev ious comp lex 
system o f charges and waivers hav ing been eliminated. The n ew f inanc ia l arrangements 
shou ld make the Bank’s f inanc ia l products mo re attractive t o M e x i c a n governments, b o t h 
federal and local. The B a n k w i l l also extend ma tu r i t ies available t o borrowers f o r up t o 
30 years, fb r the r im p r o v i n g the competitiveness o f Bank loans.

There are numerous examples o f successh l co l labo ra t ion between the W o r l d 
Bank and the In te r -Ame r ican Deve lopmen t B a n k (IDB), w h i c h i s the mos t active

the education sector, social protection, 
training, procurement, p ro jec t

inc luded j o i n t w o r k t o standardize bidding documents, as w e l l as co l labo ra t ing o n the 
eva lua t ion o f the Federal Government’s procurement po l ic ies and practices. In addition,

Annex D - Fiduciary Aspects 

1. 
Use of Country Systems. Under the G O M i s non -add i t iona l i ty p r inc ip le , B a n k f inanc ing i s 
used to reimburse p rog ram expenditures already budgeted and executed by the sectoral entities. 
Therefore, in M e x i c o the p u b l i c f inanc ia l management (PFM) systems are largely used in Bank 
investment operations, with m i n o r areas o f oppo r tun i ty in the s t ream l in ing o f reports f o r 
disbursement, f inanc ia l mon i to r ing , and audit purposes. Howeve r , PFM objectives go beyond 
those o f specific investment projects. 

2. 
In procurement, s i g n i f i c a n t progress has been made towards bringing M e x i c a n systems 
closer t o in te rna t iona l good practices. C O M P R A N E T was ce r t i f ied f o r use in Bank projects f o r 
b o t h I C B and NC B , and ha rmon ized documents f o r procurement o f goods, c i v i l wo rks and 
consultants in Bank and IDB projects were adopted. These documents inc lude elements o f l o c a l 
l aw and were adopted by M e x i c o as na t iona l documents f o r p ro jec ts f inanced by M u l t i l a t e r a l 
Banks. Sma l l procurement (similar t o shopping) already f o l l ow s l o c a l l a w and Mex ico 's 
regu la to ry b o d y i s one o f the best in the region. M e x i c o i s the f i rs t coun t ry in the reg ion where 
the B a n k has applied the O E C D D A C indicators t o the na t iona l p rocu remen t system, w h i c h w i l l 
serve as the basis f o r making decisions on Coun t ry Systems, in the event that a p o l i c y i s 
approved by the Bank's board. 

3. 
F iduc ia ry Deve lopmen t Issues. In terms o f i t s developmental stage, M e x i c o should a im 
at con t inu ing imp rovemen t o f i t s PFM systems in order t o reach convergence with OECD - type 
good p rac t ice and standards o n budgeting, treasury, accounting, con t ro ls and audits. These are 
areas where, based o n i t s in te rna t iona l expertise, the Bank can add s ign i f ican t value th rough 
lending a n d o r non-lending services, w h i l e at the same time con t r ibu t ing t o support the f iduc ia ry 
underpinnings o f DPL lending, operationalization o f the G A C strategy, and progress towards 
Paris ha rmon iza t ion targets. 

4. 
In procurement, the Bank recen t ly completed 2 CPAR, j o i n t l y with the IDB. The teams 
are adv is ing the Government not only o n typ ica l procurement areas but also o n h o w to ensure 
that the procurement system supports the GOM ' s economic development plan. There i s 
considerable r o o m fo r imp rovemen t in Government's p r i o r i t y areas that w o u l d modernize the 
system and make i t mo re adaptable t o the fast changing ma rke t and procurement environments. 
The recommendations a i m t o a l i g n the system with the Government 's objectives and make i t 
mo re open t o compe t i t ion and mo re e f f ic ien t . The proposed re fo rms would generate s i g n i f i c a n t 
savings t o the Government by reduc ing the transaction costs and, mos t impo r tan t ly , by reduc ing 
prices o f Government purchases. Mo reove r , the proposed re fo rms w o u l d enhance the 
transparency, p red ic tab i l i ty and p u b l i c trust in the system. 

5 . 

A s the CPS p e r i o d matures, and the streamlined lending approach i s fblly implemented, 
the p o r t f o l i o o f Bank investment loans w i l l s h r i n k substantially. F i d u c i a r y issues, however, are 
likely t o b e a part o f the ongo ing p o l i c y dialogue o n p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion re fo rms over the 
com ing years.
