Country Partnership Strategy 
Fiscal Years 2008-201 1 

I. Executive Summary 

1. 
The last World B a n k Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) 
for Co lomb ia was 
presented to the B o a r d in December 2002. At that time, President A l v a r o Uribe h a d just 
been elected with a strong mandate t o restore secu r i ty and economic s tab i l i ty . The coun t ry 
was s t i l l recove r ing f r o m i t s wo rs t economic c r is is in seventy years and g rapp l ing w i th 
sp i ra l ing violence. 

2 . 
During the C A S period, Co lomb ia ’s economy rebounded f r o m near stagnation in 
2002 t o achieve a g r ow t h rate o f around 6.6 percent in 2007. This tu rna round was due 
partly t o a favorable external environment, but im p r o v e d in te rna l security and sound 
macroeconomic management also p layed a c r i t i c a l ro le . High g r ow t h rates have reduced 
pove r ty and raised social indicators, while reduced v io lence and enhanced government 
effectiveness and r u l e o f l aw have resulted in increased consumer and inves to r confidence. 
This comb ina t ion o f economic recovery, increased state presence and success f i l security 
measures against i l l e g a l groups have wo rked together in a v i r tuous cyc le t o s ign i f ican t ly 
improve the qua l i ty o f l i f e o f m i l l ions o f Colombians. 

3. 
During the last C A S period, 
the W o r l d Bank G roup made an impo r tan t 
con t r ibu t ion , m o r e than doubling average annua l bank lending and p r o v i d i n g the new 
adm in is t ra t ion with a strong package o f adv iso ry services. The challenge f o r Co lomb ia 
now i s t o consolidate these impo r tan t gains and the challenge f o r the B a n k G roup i s t o 
con t inue i t s strong partnership and rema in a re levan t partner t o this dynam ic m i d d l e 
income client. W h i l e the immed ia te economic and p o l i t i c a l ou t look i s positive, the 
Government s t i l l faces daun t ing problems. First, i t s t i l l continues to combat various armed 
groups, w h i l e at the same time re in teg ra t ing thousands o f fo rme r combatants i n t o c i v i l i a n 
l i f e , providing them su f f ic ien t incentives n o t t o re-engage in v io len t o r i l l e g a l ac t iv i ty . 
Ex t reme pove r ty and deep i n e q u i t i e s continue t o haunt the coun t ry and could, i f l e f t 
unattended, f i e 1 n ew cycles o f ins tab i l i ty . 

4. 
The Government recognizes these challenges and aims t o address them th rough i t s 
2006-20 10 N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t P lan ( the NDP), 
the outcome o f broad-based 
consu l ta t ive process. The N D P lays ou t a comprehensive se t o f costed programs built 
around s ix m a i n pillars-Peace and Security, Equity, High and Sustainable G row th , 
Env i ronmen ta l Sustainability, G o o d Governance and Transversal Themes. These f o r m the 
basis for the World B a n k Group’s Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) f o r FY08-11. 

5 . 

In l i n e with the Bank’s m idd le - income country (M IC ) strategy a r o l l i n g 
p rog ramm ing approach i s proposed, under w h i c h the CPS pipeline w i l l b e determined 
during annual reviews held in con junc t ion with results-based Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o 

Performance Reviews.’ Results w i l l be measured us ing the Results M a t r i x in Annex I and 
NDP’s mon i to r ing indicators, w h i c h w i l l be tracked th rough SIGOB, the na t iona l 
m o n i t o r i n g system.2 Thus, the success o f the CPS w i l l b e coterminous with the success o f 
the Government’s programs that the WBG i s supporting. P rov ided the Government 
sustains a comm i tmen t t o s t rong macroeconomic management and e f fec t ive poverty 
alleviation, the B a n k G roup proposes t o ma in ta in an active IBRD lend ing p rog ram o f up to 
U S $ 4 b i l l i o n this CPS p e r i o d (about U S $ 1 b i l l i o n per year) and I F C f inanc ing o f up to 
U S $ 300/400 m i l l i o n pe r year, complemented by a diverse set o f ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry 
services and specialized g r a n t s . 

6. 
The CPS embodies the W o r l d Bank Group’s strategy f o r working in m idd le - income 
countries and features many o f the characteristics expected for new CPSs. There i s a focus 
o n f lex ib le p rog ramm ing and exposure management, quick-response and j o i n t l y prepared 
know ledge products; and f ron t ie r products ( inc lud ing in i t ia t ives in sovereign asset 
management, sub-national finance, p r iva te -pub l ic partnerships, con t ingen t lend ing and 
insurance instruments). In addition, strong con t inu i ty with successful operations w i l l be 
ma in ta ined th rough several second and th i rd -gene ra t ion operations. 

7 . 

M o s t o f the r isks i d e n t i f i e d in the 2002 CAS-increased 
con f l ic t , economic 
deterioration, stalled r e f o r m s - d i d n o t materialize; instead the coun t ry made impo r tan t 
gains in growth, secu r i ty and economic s tab i l i ty . Nonetheless, r isks remain. Peace has n o t 
been secured and poverty, corruption, and the drug trade r em a i n s ign i f ican t challenges f o r 
the country. The external environment c o u l d change as a resu l t o f the s low d ow n o f the 
U S economy and/or potential reduc t ion o f trade with Venezuela, w h i c h c o u l d cause a 
deterioration o f Co lomb ia ’s f isca l situation. As the Bank G roup increases i t s engagement at 
the sub-national level, moreover, reputational, f iduc ia ry and safeguard r isks w i l l increase, 
pos ing inc reased p o r t f o l i o management challenges. 

8. 
At present, however, C o l om b i a appears w e l l pos i t ioned t o absorb l i k e l y external 
and in te rna l pressures, rende r ing the r i s k s t o the Bank G roup manageable, i n c l u d i n g IBRD 
exposure risks. Ove r the last f o u r yea rs the Government has made impo r tan t advances in 
addressing the challenges highlighted above and the current N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t P lan 
has comprehensive programs (organized by p i l l a r ) dedicated t o each o f these issues. 
Further, the President’s po l ic ies have b e e n widely debated and app rova l f o r them i s 
reflected in strong, sustained popu la r support. 

9 . 
In sum, w h i l e po l i t ica l , economic, and operational r i s k s a re present, as they were in 
the p rev ious CAS , they appear manageable and warrant Bank G roup comm i tmen ts o f the 
envisaged scale. The po ten t ia l rewards o f con t inued large-scale engagement in Co lomb ia 
are very high, as demonstrated c lea r ly by the successes achieved over the last C A S period. 

’ W h i l e this CPS i s not fully programmed i n advance, there are areas i n which the Government has asked for or indicated 
i t w i l l seek WBG support, including tackling extreme poverty and regional inequality, infrastructure and public services, 
competitiveness, public sector management, the environment, education, social protection, housing, transportation, energy 
and mining, agriculture, and peace-building. 
I n addition, collaboration on financial services, banking and risk 
management products i s likely to intensify.

Introduction 

10. 
The last W o r l d Bank Group’s Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) f o r Co lomb ia 
was presented t o the B o a r d in December 2002. At that time, President A l v a r o Uribe h a d 
just been elected with a strong mandate t o restore secu r i ty and economic s tab i l i ty . The 
coun t ry was s t i l l recove r ing f r o m i t s wo rs t economic c r is is in seventy years and grappling 
with sp i ra l ing v io lence associated with the armed con f l ic t . U n d e r the FY 2003-07 CAS , 
the W o r l d B a n k Group (WBG) mo re than doub led average annual lending t o Colombia, 
p r o v i d i n g the adm in is t ra t ion with a strong package o f adv iso ry serv ices , investment and 
lending in fou r strategic areas-Sustained G row th , Equity, Governance and Peace.3 

1 1. 
Since 2002 a comb ina t ion o f factors-economic 
recovery, an increased state 
presence and successful security measures-have w o r k e d together in a v i r tuous cyc le t o 
s ign i f ican t ly imp rove the quality o f l i f e o f m i l l i o n s o f Co lomb ians . Through i t s support, the 
WBG has been able t o accompany the adm in is t ra t ion in many o f i t s mos t impo r tan t p o l i c y 
in i t ia t ives and continue a substantial p rog ram o f f inanc ia l assistance. 

12. 
This Coun t ry Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers f isca l years 2008 -1 1 and i s a l igned 
with the country’s development goals as expressed in the 2006-2010 N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t P l a n and longe r - te rm development strategy “Co lomb ia V i s i o n 201 9”. This 
CPS proposes t o ma in ta in an active IBRD lending p rog ram o f up t o U S $ 4 b i l l ion (about 
U S $ 1 b i l l i o n pe r year), with an inc reas ing ly ac t ive I F C p rog ram in the range o f U S $ 
300/400 m i l l i o n per year, complemented by a diverse set o f ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry 
services and specialized g ran ts . 

13. 
The CPS embodies the W o r l d Bank’s e v o l v i n g strategy f o r w o r k i n g in m i d d l e - 
income countries and fea tures many o f the characteristics expected f o r new CPSs. 
P rog ramm ing i s done o n an annual basis, synchronized with the na t iona l budget process, 
and based o n a demand-driven “menu” approach. F ron t ie r p roduc ts w i l l feature s t rong ly 
( inc lud ing in i t ia t ives in sovereign asset management, sub-national finance, p r iva te -pub l ic 
partnerships, contingent lend ing and insurance instruments) and emphasis w i l l be p laced o n 
j o i n t l y prepared, quick-response AAA. In addition, strong con t inu i ty with the p rev ious 
C A S w i l l b e maintained, cap i ta l iz ing o n past successes th rough several second o r third- 
generation operations. Examples o f some o f the successful in i t ia t ives w h i c h are expected t o 
continue into th is CPS pe r iod are summarized be low . 

A CAS Progress Repor t was submitted to the Boa rd in September, 2005 (report 32999-CO). I t was at this stage tha t a 
n ew “Peace P i l l a r ” was in troduced at the Government’s request.

The r a p i d g r ow t h o f 2007 i s expected t o subside to m o r e sustainable g r ow t h rates o f 
around 5 percent o f GDP during the remainder o f the CPS period, as domestic demand has 
been g r ow i n g faster than GDP, i n f l a t i o n has accelerated and the current account de f ic i t has 
widened substantially. The m a i n external risk t o the economy w o u l d be a s lowdown in the

the expansion o f the armed forces and the establishment o f state presence throughout 
Co lomb ian te r r i to ry have resulted in a s ign i f ican t reduc t ion o f violence, pa r t icu la r ly in

E lec t ions . In October 2007 free elections were h e l d in a l l o f Co lomb ia ’s 1099

increased their dominance in larger c i t ies and provinces 7 6 (though the mayo rsh ip o f Bogo ta 
went t o the oppos i t ion Polo Dernocratico party). W h i l e these v ic to r ies are a show o f 
p o l i t i c a l support fo r the current administration, the re are uncertainties su r round ing the 201 0 
elections and whether this coa l i t ion w i l l rema in intact. 

l 2 F o r example, i l l i te racy among ind igenous and A f ro -Co lomb ian popu la t ions i s estimated t o be nea r ly doub le the 
na t iona l average, and the in fan t mo r ta l i ty rate among indigenous i s about 50 percent h igher than in the general popu la t ion . 
l3 To i l lus tra te this point, one can compare na t iona l progress o n M D G s w i t h that o f the department o f Choco-whose 
popu la t ion o f 400,000 i s 90 percent A f ro -Co lomb ian and 4 percent indigenous. Acco rd ing t o departmental o f f ic ia ls , 
Choco tra i ls na t iona l averages in nea r ly every MDG category; in fan t mo r ta l i ty na t ionw ide i s 20 deaths pe r 1,000 vs. 44 in 
Choco, maternal mo r ta l i ty i s 9 9 per 1,000 b i r ths na t iona l ly vs. 417 per 1,000 in Choco. Househo lds in precarious

In another measure, the U N ’ s Reg iona l H um a n Deve lopmen t Index places C o l om b i a 73rd f r o m the top, with 
Bogo ta ’s rank ing an even h igher 38th place (s im i lar to Hungary) w h i l e the department o f Choco i s ranked 148th.

Peace Process. Today, over 42,000 ex-combatants have been demobilized, mos t 
f r om paramilitary forces. The Government has taken steps towards peace negotiations with 
a much-weakened ELN (E j k r c i t o de L ibe rac idn National). Recent attempts t o arrange a 
human i ta r ian prisoner exchange w i th the F A R C (Fuerzas A rmadas Revo luc iona r ias de 
Co lomb ia ) have resulted in the l ibe ra t ion o f two impo r tan t p o l i t i c a l figures. However, 
even in the absence o f a negotiated se t t lemen t , the in f luence o f the F A R C and ELN has 
b e e n reduced s ign i f ican t ly as a resu l t o f the military actions by the Gove rnmen t and lack o f 
p u b l i c support. 

28 . Current Challenges. Desp i te i t s remarkable success in pulling the coun t ry back 
f r om the brink o f economic crisis, sp i ra l ing v io lence and social upheaval, the Government 
s t i l l faces daun t ing and simultaneous challenges t o ach iev ing sustained peace, security and 
economic s tab i l i ty . 

29 . As a r e s u l t o f successful demob i l iza t ion negotiations, the Government mus t n o w 
reintegrate thousands o f fo rme r combatants i n t o c i v i l i a n l i f e and p r o v i d e them with

30. 

The gue r i l la and pa ram i l i ta ry ac t iv i t ies and the na rco t ra f f ick ing w h i c h have haunted 
the coun t ry f o r decades continue t o be the lead ing obstacles t o ach iev ing sustainable

” In recent years the FARC, as well as paramilitary forces, have come to fund their activities primarily from the drug 
trade (extortion and kidnapping having diminished under President Uribe). Though some o f the trade has shifted to 
Mexico and other South American drug cartels, narcotrafficking i s s t i l l said to generate enormous revenues per year i n 
Colombia, and constitutes a major source o f continued financing for illegal groups.

1 3ox 2. Stakeholder Consultations and Client Survey 

M a i n Messages: 
I m a g e a n d Ou t r e a ch . The B a n k receives very h i g h ra t ings fo r i ts ove ra l l image in Co lomb ia . 
Stakeholders perceive the B a n k as respectful, responsive, and co l labora t ive with Government and other 
donors. The two m a i n sources o f in fo rma t ion about the WBG are work-related exchanges and the Bank ’s 
website-which 
i s seen t o o f fe r timely and easily accessible in fo rma t ion o n the coun try program. 
However, p o l i c y messages do no t trave l far beyond o f f i c i a l c irc les and academia t o t h e broader popu la t ion 
and better use c o u l d b e made o f alternative med ia (such as periodicals). Stakeholders are in general 
unclear about the procedures t o app ly fo r Bank-re la ted grants, scholarships, and t ra in ing opportunities and 
w o u l d l i k e easier access t o t h i s in forma t ion , pa r t icu la r ly those l i v i n g outside B o g o t i . 
P roduc ts a n d Services. The Bank i s va lued f o r i t s f inanc ia l resources, techn ica l advice, and knowledge; 
though i t i s fe l t that i t should improve the price, terms and processing requirements o f i t s loans as w e l l as 
non- f inanc ia l services. (Note: t h e c l ien t survey was conducted p r i o r t o recent changes in I B R D ’ s p r i c i n g 
po l icy .) Respondents see the B a n k as needing to become mo re compe t i t ive in a M I C coun try that has other 
f inanc ing alternatives. The Bank’s strategies and recommendations, moreover, are n o t always seen as 
realistic or we l l- ta i lored to coun try circumstances. 
C o u n t r y P r io r i t ies . Pover ty reduc t ion and t h e lack o f emp loymen t opportunities are the m a i n 
development challenges f o r Colombia-and 
t h e B a n k needs t o be more i n v o l v e d in pove r ty eradication 
through the p rov is ion o f education, jobs and basic in fras truc ture (although, at the same time pove r ty 
a l lev ia t ion was the area where t h e Bank was seen as re la t ive ly less effective). 
Spec if ic A r e a s o f In t e r v en t ion . The WBG should address l a n d p o l i c y (a p r i o r i t y fo r the r u r a l poor), 
p rov ide more nuanced advice to tackle disparities a t t h e reg iona l l e v e l (a v i ew w i d e l y h e l d by Afro- 
Colombians and indigenous groups consulted), g ive greater focus to p romo t ion o f science and technology 
fo r competitiveness, and focus more o n youth.

Rationale for World Bank Group Support to Colombia 

40. 
The W o r l d B a n k G roup and the Government o f Co lomb ia have built a p roduc t ive 
and dynam ic dialogue o n a wide range o f development i s s u e s and th is has l e d t o a strong 
lending program. IBRD i s currently Colombia’s largest single creditor, i t s market-share 
among mu l t i la te ra ls h a v i n g increased s tead i ly since 2001 f r o m 2 4 percent t o 44 percent 
today. Th rough i t s l o n g engagement, the WBG has gained s ign i f ican t know ledge and 
expertise in the areas mos t c r i t ica l t o the country’s development. The synergies o f fe red by 
the comb ined services o f IBRD, I F C and M IGA constitute an unmatched suite o f coun t ry 
experience and strategic, financial, and techn ica l support w h i c h i s accessible within a stable 
and long - te rm mu l t i la te ra l relationship. 

41. 
Today, there i s s t i l l a s ign i f ican t demand f o r WBG services t o he lp the Government 
consolidate i t s achievements and address ongo ing challenges. Furthermore, a l ign ing the 
CPS with the NDP o f fe rs the WBG an oppo r tun i ty t o fully ha rmon ize i t s p rog ram with the 
country’s o w n plans and budget cycle. Mo reove r , a NDP developed with b road popu la r 
consu l ta t ion i s consistent with Paris Dec la ra t ion commitments. 

42. 
I t i s impo r tan t t o highlight that while there has been an in tens i f ica t ion o f WBG 
engagement with Co lomb ia over the last CPS period, the Government has been ve ry 
successful in changing i t s debt p ro f i le , favo r ing domestic currency debt, and manag ing i t s 
debt strategically, using l o c a l currency instruments and accessing in te rna t iona l cap i ta l 
markets. W h i l e the B a n k remains compe t i t ive in terms o f p r ic ing , the challenge w i l l be t o 

13 

con t inue reducing the non - f inanc ia l transaction costs imposed o n the c l ien t coun t ry and 
ensure that the Bank’s techn ica l expertise and adv iso ry services i s cutting-edge, and 
responsive t o rap id ly -chang ing needs. A sophisticated m idd le - income coun t ry l i k e 
Co lomb ia i s an important test case for demonstrating that the WBG can de l ive r o n i t s M I C 
strategy o f faster, mo re f l e x i b l e c l ien t -d r iven support.

Strategic Elements o f Proposed CPS 

43. When President U r i b e was re-elected in May 2006, the Bank h a d already prepared a 
series o f 18 P o l i c y Notes, “Colombia 2006-201 0: A Window of O p p o r t ~ n i t y ” . ~ ~ These 
were discussed with the President and h i s cabinet sho r t ly after his reelection. In December 
the WBG coun t ry team and senior Government o f f ic ia ls convened f o r a day - long wo rkshop 
in Wash ing ton DC , at w h i c h the Government presented i t s N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan and 
ou t l ined h o w the WBG c o u l d best support i t s goals under a new CPS. 

44. 
The authorities requested WBG support 
f o r 
five pillars o f the N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t Plan-Peace and Secu r i ty f o r Citizens, P romo t ion o f Equity, High and 
Sustainable G row th , A State at the Service o f i t s Citizens, and P r om o t i o n o f Env i ronmen ta l 
Sustainability, as well as support f o r i t s Transversal Themes. U n d e r each pillar i t was 
agreed that the B a n k w o u l d p r o v i d e a f l e x i b l e menu-based m i x o f f inanc ia l and ana ly t ica l 
services ta i lo red t o the country’s e v o l v i n g needs. New f ron t ie r p roduc ts w o u l d also b e 
offered, pa r t icu la r ly in the area o f f inanc ia l and risk management. 

45. 
In l i n e with the Bank ’s M IC agenda, the Government and the WBG have agreed t o 
a r o l l i n g p rog ramm ing approach whereby the CPS p ipe l ine w i l l be determined and adjusted 
o n a yea r ly basis in con junc t ion with results-based CPPRs. Results w i l l be measured us ing 
the m o n i t o r i n g indicators o f the NDP,24 and these ind ica to rs w i l l b e tracked th rough the 
na t iona l m o n i t o r i n g system (S1GOB)-thus 
the success o f the CPS w i l l be coterminous 
with the success o f the Government’s p rog rams that the WBG i s supporting. A m i d - t e rm 
CPS Progress Repo r t w i l l also p rov ide an oppo r tun i ty f o r adjustments. 

46. 
B a n k interventions w i l l be designed in c o n f o rm i t y with Paris Dec la ra t ion p r inc ip les 
o f donor a l ignmen t and ha rmon iza t ion with na t iona l systems. W h e r e coun t ry systems have 
not evolved to international standards, the WBG w i l l p rov ide techn ica l assistance t o help 
build ins t i tu t iona l capacity at the local, p rov inc ia l , and na t iona l levels. 

47. 
The CPS also incorporates the m a i n tenets o f t h e Bank’s Governance and Anti- 
co r rup t ion Strategy and L A C reg iona l p o l i c y as a complement to Colombia’s e f fo r ts o n th is 
front, i n c l u d i n g i t s recent ra t i f ica t ion o f the U N ’ s An t i -Co r rup t ion Conven t ion and the 
Governance P i l l a r goals o f the NDP. WBG support t o governance at the subnational l e v e l 
i s expected t o increase over the CPS period, as discussions have already been initiated with 
several newly elected mayo rs and governors (e.g. Mede l l in , Bogota, Cartagena), w h i c h has

Results Monitoring 

74. 
In add i t ion t o annual CPPRs, the mid-term CPS Progress Report, the Bank intends 
to m o n i t o r the results under the CPS f r o m three add i t iona l angles, in con junc t ion with the 
Resu l ts M a t r i x in Annex I. First, NDP monitoring: The Government o f Co lomb ia i s 
strongly comm i t ted t o m o n i t o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f i t s development program. Towa rds 
this end, the Government developed a system ca l led Sistema de Seguimiento a Me tas de 
Gob ie rno " (SIGOB-Management and M o n i t o r i n g System of 
the Objectives of 
the 

G ~ v e r n m e n t ) . ~ ' I t i s regu la r ly updated and p rov ides the basic f ramewo rk f o r results- 
o r ien ted m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation. Since the CPS i s d r i v e n by the Government 's NDP, 
the Bank would evaluate, as one d imens ion unde r i t s resu l ts -mon i to r ing o f the CPS, h o w 
e f fec t ive the Government i s in ach iev ing i t s o w n development v i s i o n and objectives. 
Those objectives have been detailed in the NDP and the Bank w i l l m o n i t o r the ove ra l l 
progress o f the Government's o w n benchmarks. 

75. 
Second, AAA monitoring. The Bank 's know ledge products are meant t o con t r ibu te 
t o the p u b l i c p o l i c y process. These products w i l l n o t be linked t o the coun t ry outcomes p e r 
se but rather b e judged o n c r i te r ia o f their quality, relevance, and sustainability. The 
qua l i ty o f the Bank's AAA can be assessed based o n (i) the feedback f r o m the client; (ii) 
pe r iod ic evaluations o f a sample o f know ledge products f r om outside experts, from 
Co lomb ia , the region, and g loba l ly ; and (iii) the Bank's in te rna l evaluations. The relevance 
o f the Bank's knowledge products can b e assessed by whether the Government inv i tes the 
B a n k t o contribute t o Colombia 's h i g h - p r i o r i t y p o l i c y issues and whether the po l ic ies that 
the Government pu rsues re f lec t Bank 's advice. The Bank does n o t expect d i rec t ly 
attributable outcomes, but does believe that when advice has been use fu l the Bank 's input 
w i l l b e evident in the resu l t ing p o l i c y re fo rm . F ina l ly , the sus ta inab i l i ty o f the Bank's 
p r o v i s i o n o f know ledge products w i l l be the market test, i.e. whether the Government w i l l 
con t inue demanding the Bank's AAA services. 

76. 
Third, project monitoring. The Bank 's active investment p rog ram constitutes a 
third d imens ion in m o n i t o r i n g CPS results. At the i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec t level, the Bank w i l l 
t rack key results indicators fo r each p ro jec t . 
In this context, o n l y fully satisfactory 
performance w i l l be acceptable with respect t o the Deve lopmen t Ob jec t ives and

Trade. The external environment that has proved so favorable since the last C A S 
(commod i ty prices, interest rates, and strong demand f r o m Co lomb ia ’s two m a i n t rad ing 
partners, the U S and Venezuela) c o u l d change, a f fec t ing Co lomb ia ’s f isca l accounts. In 
particular, any ma jo r d is rup t ion o f trade with Venezuela c o u l d have a significant e f fec t on 
Colombia’s 
trade balance as Venezuela represents the second largest destination o f 
Colombia’s exports (about 2 percent o f GDP). E f f o r t s t o im p r o v e the country’s 
competitiveness, in general, reduce these r i s k s . Co lomb ia i s also ac t ive ly engaged in 
nego t ia t ing b i la te ra l f r e e trade agreements with a number o f large economies w h i l e the 
F r e e Trade Agreement with the United States i s pend ing r a t i f i c a t i o n by the U S Congress. 
Further, despite the rea l appreciation o f last tw o years, the rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate 
remains near h is to r ica l averages f o r the last t w o decades and i t i s substantially less 
appreciated than the l e v e l that preceded the economic c r is is o f 1999.

Finance. T h e ongo ing p rob lems in U S and European f inanc ia l sectors s temm ing 
f r om the subprime mortgage c r is is c o u l d lead t o increased b o r r ow i n g costs by deve lop ing 
countries l i k e Co lomb ia . The current g loba l f inanc ia l environment c o u l d adversely affect 
net cap i ta l f lows t o Co lomb ia and other emerging market economies. T o m i n im i z e external

comb ined external debt o f b o t h the p u b l i c and private sector i s n o w about 30 percent o f 
GDP . In addition, in te rna t iona l reserves have increased substantially and stand at over 
U S $ 20 b i l l i o n at the end o f January, 2008. B a n k debt sus ta inab i l i ty analyses show that 
Co lomb ia i s likely t o be res i l ien t t o a number o f shock scenarios.

countries as diverse as the Philippines and Ecuador. Similarly Colombia’s Social Targeting System i s being replicated i n 
the Dominican Republic and Ecuador, while the Transmilenio Mass Transport System has attracted significant 
international attention and i s being replicated in several large cities around the world.

Ove rhea t ing o f the Economy . Con t inued r a p i d economic g r ow t h brings with i t 
the risk o f overheating-the 
current account d e f i c i t reached about 4 percent o f GDP last 
year. FDI f l ow s last year exceeded the size o f the current account deficit, and t o t a l external 
debt i s b e l ow 30 percent o f GDP, making i t likely that t h e coun t ry w i l l be able t o manage 
this po ten t ia l p r o b l em w i t h o u t serious dislocation. A d d i t i o n a l e f fo r ts at f isca l conso l ida t ion

81. 
Po l it ica l . Peace has n o t been secured th roughou t the en t i re coun t ry and poverty, 
corruption, and the drug trade rema in s ign i f ican t challenges. The Government has recen t ly 
suffered setbacks o n the p o l i t i c a l f ron t with the arrest o f several congressmen and one

pa r t icu la r ly b e tw e e n the Execu t ive and C o n g r e s s - c o u l d unravel. 

82. 
Howeve r , the Government recognizes these challenges and has launched m a j o r 
in i t ia t ives t o address them, pa r t icu la r ly within the con tex t o f the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t 
Plan. The President’s m a j o r po l ic ies a re on s t rong foo t ing and the fact that h e was re - 
elected in M a y o f 2006 with 56 percent o f the popu la r vo te and has ma in ta ined strong 
popular support (around 7 0 percent) signals a f a i r l y strong consensus f o r advancing h i s 
Government’s social/economic re fo rms and f o r con t inu ing his democratic security p o l i c y . 
Also, in the October 2007 elections, the coa l i t ion o f parties that support President U r i b e 
increased the i r dominance over Colombia’s larger c i t ies and provinces. 

83. 
Social Cohesion. W h i l e the immed ia te economic and p o l i t i c a l ou t look i s positive, 
the Government s t i l l faces daunting problems. First, i t must con t inue to combat various 
armed groups, w h i l e at the s am e t im e re in teg ra t ing thousands o f fo rme r combatants i n t o

po ten t ia l risks. 

85 . M I C Strategy . The Government has been very successful in chang ing i t s debt 
p r o f i l e and manag ing i t s debt strategically, using l o c a l cu r rency and accessing in te rna t iona l 
cap i ta l markets, with a clear eye o n competitiveness. W h i l e the Bank remains compe t i t ive 
in t e rm s o f p r ic ing , the challenge w i l l be t o con t inue t o reduce the non - f inanc ia l transaction 
costs t o the c l ien t and ensure that the Bank’s techn ica l expertise and adv iso ry services are 
cutting-edge, and responsive to r a p i d l y chang ing needs. Thus, a sophisticated m i d d l e -

de l ive r o n i t s M I C strategy o f m o r e flexible, focused and fast c l ien t -d r iven support. 

86. 
In summary, po l i t ica l , economic, and ope ra t iona l r i s k s are s t i l l present, making i t 
essential that p rac t ica l m i t i g a t i o n measures are imp lemen ted and that r i s k s are con t inuous ly

impo r tan t t o emphasize that w h i l e r i s k s exist, as they have in p rev ious CASs, the po ten t ia l

Implementing the recommendations c lea r ly represen ts an ins t i tu t iona l challenge- 
especially in t e rm s o f focus ing o n detailed reg iona l o r sectoral in i t ia t ives . 

15. 
That said, o n a na t iona l level, Co lomb ia has made progress in reduc ing the 
administrative cost o f doing business th rough a variety o f reforms, i n c l u d i n g landmark an t i - 
bureaucratic process leg is la t ion (“Ley A n t i - t r h i t e ” ) that was app roved in 2005. The 
Government also established “one-stop shops” to make i t easier f o r f i rm s t o register and 
license their businesses. Progress in f inanc ia l sector stability, regu la t ion and expansion has 
led to lowe r f inanc ing costs and broader access t o credit. The “Opportunities Bank”

16. 
Recent progress was va l ida ted by the D o i n g Business 2008 team, and Co lomb ia 
was named one o f the top 10 reformers. The main areas o f imp rovemen t c i ted were in the 
areas o f p ro tec t ion o f investors, ease o f p a y i n g taxes and trade across borders. I t shou ld b e 
noted, however, that in the latter two categories there i s substantial r o o m f o r imp rovemen t 
with the rankings at 167 and 105 respectively. 

17. 
The Government’s tax re fo rm last year was in tended to p r o v i d e stronger incentives 
f o r p r iva te sector investment. The treatment o f investment expenditures by f i r m s in the 
corporate income tax i s ce r ta in ly favorable. With the comb ina t ion o f pa r t ia l up - f ron t 
expensing and gradual depreciation, the re i s an im p l i c i t subsidy t o n e w cap i ta l investment. 
There remains unequal treatment across sectors due to a wide array o f special exemptions 
fo r pa r t icu la r sectors. 

18. 
In transport and logistics, there i s a m a j o r e f fo r t t o launch a concessions p rog ram

Co lomb ia i s one o f the countries that f o r decades has sought and f o l l ow e d WBG 
advice o n several fronts, i n c l u d i n g p r iva te sector development. For instance, in the 1960s 
the W o r l d B a n k p r o v i d e d support to develop the mortgage sector. In the 1970s and ea r ly 
1980s, a similar approach took place w i th the Deve lopmen t Finance Corporations with the 
World Bank c om i n g in t o advise and establish these f inanc ia l intermediaries, and I F C 
p r o v i d i n g b o t h equity and debt. These ins t i tu t ions p layed a ca ta ly t ic r o l e in channe l ing 
f inanc ing to eme rg ing l o c a l companies and groups during those years. During the la te 
1990s Co lomb ia went th rough a severe recession and the WBG responded with strong 
support. W h i l e the W o r l d Bank p rov ided p o l i c y advice and budget support lending, the 
I F C p rov ided c r i t i c a l support f o r the res t ruc tu r ing o f the backbone o f Co lomb ia 's indus t r ia l

Main Governance Challenges in Colombia 

2. 
The single mos t i n f l u e n t i a l challenge n o t o n l y t o governance but also t o economic 
and social development in Co lomb ia i s the armed con f l ic t , w h i c h has pitted democ ra t ica l ly - 
elected governments against l e f t -w i n g gue r r i l la movements (the F A R C and ELN). Ove r 
the last two decades pa ram i l i ta ry forces have evo lved f r o m self-defense groups assembled 
by landowners, i n t o organized armies living o f f ex to r t ion and drug t ra f f ick ing . The 
g r ow i n g economic and p o l i t i c a l in f luence o f i l l e g a l armed groups, coup led with ruthless 
violence and in t im ida t ion , g radua l ly opened up opportunities t o capture the Co lomb ian 
State, mos t no tab ly at the m u n i c i p a l and departmental levels. 

3. 
Na t iona l - leve l ins t i tu t ions o f eve ry kind a re also susceptible t o capture f r o m i l l e g a l 
armed groups as well as m o r e t rad i t iona l mafias such as d rug - t ra f f ick ing cartels. 
Ins t i tu t ions such as Congress and the na t iona l in te l l igence service have been seriously 
undermined by alleged linkages with pa ram i l i ta ry groups, and recent investigations by the 
Ministry o f Defense have discovered a s ign i f ican t l e v e l o f pene t ra t ion o f drug cartels i n t o 
the armed forces, and cases are b e i n g prosecuted. Th is l e v e l o f state capture disrupts 
governance at every level, unde rm in ing democratic ins t i tu t ions .

The lawmak ing process i t s e l f has frequently been singled ou t as a m a j o r obstacle t o

In t e rm s o f ru les that con t ro l the p rope r use o f p u b l i c funds, C o l om b i a has advanced 
considerably in the mode rn iza t ion o f key na t iona l - leve l ins t i tu t ions . The na t iona l tax 
adm in is t ra t ion has undergone dramatic imp rovemen ts ove r the last five years, n o t o n l y in 
the combat o f tax evasion but also in the imp lemen ta t ion o f in te rna l p r o b i t y regulations. 
Pub l ic expenditure i s in turn subject t o con t ro ls th rough a comprehensive integrated 
financial management system. There i s s t i l l , however, r o o m f o r s t ream l in ing transactional

imp lemen t these n ew f inanc ia l management and con t ro l f ramewo rks can vary among 
entities, pa r t icu la r ly at the subnational level. 

7 . 

Howeve r , there i s a widespread p u b l i c pe rcep t ion among Co lomb ian society that 
co r rup t ion in Co lomb ia ’s coun t ry procurement system i s abundant. The regu la to ry 
f ramewo rk o n f raud and co r rup t ion exists, but co r rup t practices are s t i l l present within the 
system and o f ten mixed with l o c a l po l i t ics . L a c k o f t ra in ing o f auditors and na r row p o l i t i c a l 
mo t iva t ions are impo r tan t obstacles t o the scope and c r e d i b i l i t y o f the i r wo rk . There are 
also issues with the ins t i tu t iona l framework, as there i s n o dedicated, centralized agency in 
charge o f procurement regulation, con t ro l and supervision. 

The Government’s Strategy to Address These Challenges 

8. 

Reestablishing State con t ro l over the en t i re C o l om b i a n te r r i to ry i s a key element o f 
the Government’s Democ ra t ic Secu r i ty Po l icy . As established in the current N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t Plan, the Government w i l l continue i t s f ron ta l fight against drugs, terrorism, 
k idnapp ing and a l l fo rms o f organized crime, as w e l l as strengthening the support 
mechanisms f o r popu la t ions displaced by v io lence and f o r the re in teg ra t ion o f demob i l ized 
members o f i l l e g a l a rmed groups i n t o society. 

9. 

This last p o i n t i s one o f the mos t impo r tan t components o f the p o l i c y t o deal with 
a l l fo rms o f v io lence and organized crime. Re in teg ra t ion o f demob i l ized combatants i s 
done th rough two types o f actions: (a) a peace dialogue with those groups that are w i l l ing 
to cease hos t i l i t ies and (b) a p a t h f o r ind iv idua ls w h o decide t o g i v e up a r m s o n an 
i n d i v i d u a l basis. The f i n a l a i m o f these actions i s t o “create a v i r tuous c i rc le o f recovery, 
presence, and conso l ida t ion o f state control.” 
The Justice and Peace L a w (Law 975 ) 
p rov ides the lega l f ramewo rk f o r the Government t o demob i l ize i l l e g a l armed groups and 
to guarantee the right t o truth, jus t ice and repa ra t ion f o r v i c t im s whose human r igh ts have 
been seriously violated. 

10. 

Congress

improvements t o the procurement system, such as the app l ica t ion o f m e r i t evaluation as the

with in te rna t iona l best practices. F ramewo rk contracts are also foreseen, w h i c h shou ld

The World Bank Group’s Role in Helping Address These Challenges 

12. 
The B a n k has been engaged with C o l om b i a f o r many years in the imp rovemen t o f 
p u b l i c sector management. Th rough several inves tmen t and po l icy -based operations, the 
Bank has supported the imp lemen ta t ion o f re fo rms in jus t ice administration, 
tax

Effect of the Overall Governance Context on the Bank’s Portfolio and Individual 
Operations 

14. 
In general, Bank operations imp lemen ted th rough entities o f the N a t i o n a l executive 
b ranch o r m a j o r l o c a l governments have faced re la t ive ly l o w r isks associated with the 
governance challenges men t ioned above. Desp i te the ongo ing armed con f l ic t , k e y entities 
such as the N a t i o n a l P lann ing Department, the Ministry o f Finance, and sector m in is t r ies 
i n v o l v e d with Bank projects have ma in ta ined a clear o r ien ta t ion re f lec ted in p u b l i c l y - 
available p o l i c y and strategy documents, several o f w h i c h have b e e n ex tens ive ly rev iewed 

48 

and commented by B a n k staff. T h i s open process reduces the p r o b a b i l i t y o f the interests o f 
i l l e g a l groups f i l t e r i n g i n t o the design o f Bank-financed operations. Imp lemen ta t ion o f 
these operations hinges u p o n a ca re fu l r e v i ew o f the capacity o f executing agencies t o 
properly implement f inanc ia l management and procurement processes and con t ro ls . 

15. 
Co lomb ia has made progress ove r t im e in the enhancement o f p u b l i c f inanc ia l 
management (PFM) regulations and systems, pa r t icu la r ly th rough the development o f the 
integrated f inanc ia l management system (S I IF ) . These imp rovemen ts are re f lec ted in 
imp roved f inanc ia l management arrangements f o r Bank - f inanced projects, w h i c h n o w 
make extensive use o f S I I F fo r accoun t ing and reporting purposes at the na t iona l leve l .

and i t s app l ica t ion in Bank - f inanced inves tmen t projects and in t roduce a framework o f

in te rna t iona l ly 
recogn ized benchmarks, 
con t r ibu t ing to the d e s i g n o f f u t u r e re fo rms and t o the Paris ha rmon iza t ion targets’. The 
f ramewo rk c o u l d also be adapted t o the specific needs o f subnational governments. 

16. 
In t e rm s o f po r t fo l io -spec i f ic issues, progress has been made in reducing the use o f 
p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion units, f i n d administrators and p r iva te external auditors. T h e Bank 
and Government have agreed o n a dec is ion f ramewo rk that promotes capac i ty building 
with exceptional use o f separate structures w h e n these a re justified in response t o 
documented r i s k s . 

17. W h i l e procurement in Bank p ro jec ts i s re la t ive ly safe and conducted under Bank 
Guidelines, In te rna t iona l Compe t i t ive Bidding ( ICB ) and N a t i o n a l Compe t i t ive Bidding 
(NCB) are usua l ly n o t compe t i t ive enough due t o the lack o f b idde r participation, 
especially in c i v i l works tenders. In mos t projects, procurement capac i ty in the executing 
agencies i s weak, and p ro jec t s t a f f w h o have bene f i ted f r o m p rocu remen t t ra in ing and 
experience o f ten leave after one o r two year o f practice, sw i tch ing t o d i f fe ren t ac t iv i t ies

when t o app ly na t iona l procurement l a w o r Bank Guidelines is, therefore, n o t unusual in 
Bank - funded projects. 

18. 
The recent amendments to the Procurement L a w inc lude the manda to ry reg is t ra t ion

constitute a barrier f o r the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f fo re ign bidders, and, in terms o f procurement o f 
goods and c i v i l works, there are s t i l l lega l p rov is ions that are n o t consistent with Bank ’s 
con f iden t ia l i ty and b id eva lua t ion po l ic ies . 

19. 
Bank - f inanced p ro jec ts imp lemen ted by l o c a l o r sub-national en t i t ies that are 
susceptible t o capture by i l l e g a l groups face a different se t o f challenges and requ i re 
pa r t icu la r des ign considerations. These must be made o n a case-by-case basis and must 
balance the achievement o f quality results at reasonable costs and t imes with the need to 
establish increased con t ro l mechanisms that p ro tec t the p ro jec t f r o m ex te rna l influences. 
Often, these mechanisms w i l l go against the tendency o f reduc ing re l iance o n external 
adm in is t ra t ion or execution agencies and adop t ing coun t ry systems whe re possible, in order 
t o ensure as m u c h independence as possible f r o m captured Government entities and “ring

Poss ib ly the highest p r o f i l e case has been the L a G u a j i r a Water and Sanitation 
In f ras t ruc tu re and Service Management P ro jec t (P09695), approved by the Bank’s B o a r d o f 
D i rec to rs in 2007. The Department o f L a Guajira, in northeast Colombia, has been 
regularly singled ou t as one o f the mos t severe cases o f capture o f a sub-national 
government, and linkages between elected o f f i c i a l s at the departmental and m u n i c i p a l l e v e l 
and i l l e g a l armed groups a re o f ten cited. Many m i l l i o n s o f do l la rs have been spent there t o 
imp rove basic public services over the last decades but have n o t bo rne fruit, likely

21. 
The L a Gua j i ra P ro jec t a ims t o imp rove the quality o f basic services in the water 
and sanitation sector throughout the Department. L a Guajira, l i k e many departments in 
Co lomb ia - and pa r t icu la r ly in Co lomb ia ’s Caribbean coastal area - has a repu ta t ion f o r

have p reven ted p u b l i c sector e f fo r ts t o meet c i t i z e n needs in an equitable and e f fec t ive 
manner. Ana lys is undertaken during preparation - and the clear messages w h i c h emerged 
th rough dialogue with stakeholders at a l l stages o f P ro jec t p repa ra t ion - c lea r ly indicates 
that corruption, p u b l i c sector malfeasance, capture by elites and special interests, and the 
pauc i ty o f accoun tab i l i ty and transparency in L a Gua j i ra are among the greatest obstacles 
t o economic and soc ia l development in the Department. The Depa r tmen t i s h is to r ica l ly 
among the wo rs t p e r f o rm i n g in t h e coun t ry as regards sectoral achievements. 

22. 
T o address these obstacles t o ach iev ing the P ro jec t Objectives, the operation 
includes 10 concrete design elements w h i c h a i m t o ensure the p ro jec t benefits reach their 
intended beneficiaries and that the B a n k and central Gove rnmen t authorities are well 
pos i t ioned t o take ac t ion in the case o f malfeasance:

without passing through the departmental budget. Such an approach n o t o n l y 
enhances the creditworthiness o f the Department and ensures the ava i lab i l i ty

A ma jo r risk o f co r rup t ion in in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts comes f r o m the upstream 
use o f inappropriate 
techno logy and techn ica l des igns and f r o m p o o r 
supervision and techn ica l oversight during cons t ruc t ion w h i c h can resu l t in 
such p rob lems as poo r q u a l i t y wo rks o r the fraudulent use o f substandard

Fiscal Sustainability and Debt Management 

1. 
A debt sustainability analysis was conducted f o r b o t h the p u b l i c and external debt. 
At 38.3 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2007, Co lomb ia ’s Gove rnmen t has a f a i r l y 
substantial gross debt burden.’ T o reduce r isks associated w i th th is debt, the Government 
has reduced the fo re ign currency exposure by i s s u i n g a greater share o f debt in l o c a l 
cu r rency and en te r ing i n t o “swap” contracts. The fo re ign cu r rency component o f p u b l i c 
debt has been reduced t o 28 percent o f p u b l i c debt, and average m a t u r i t y has been 
increased t o about 3.7 years. T o t a l external debt i s f a i r l y moderate at about 27 percent o f 
GDP at the end o f 2007.

We analyzed the p u b l i c debt prospects in three d i f fe ren t ways: i) a baseline 
p ro jec t ion w i th h is to r ica l average values o f k e y parameters; ii) an analysis o f p o l i c y

c o u l d n o t respond by using f isca l p o l i c y during the time pe r iod o f the shocks. This i s a 
p laus ib le scenario because o f the extent o f the expenditure r ig id i t ies , and also the shocks

External Debt 

5. 
A n a l y z i n g the sustainability o f the external debt requires a m o d e l that 
incorporates a different set o f key macroeconomic variables, such as Co lomb ia ’s current 
account, and a l lows u s to model another set o f d i f fe ren t shocks, f o r example, a reduc t ion 
in n e t in te rna t iona l cap i ta l i n f l ow s . Ex te rna l Debt has fa l len f r o m a high o f about 52.3 
percent o f GDP in 2002 t o m o r e manageable levels o f around 27 percent o f GDP in 2007. 

6. 
Desp i te a sharp increase in the current account de f ic i t th is year, Co lomb ia ’s to ta l 
external debt p r o f i l e (public and private) i s l i k e l y to be sustainable, g i v e n that the recent 
external imbalances have been financed largely by non-debt f lows . T o t a l external debt i s 
expected t o decline t o about 2 7 percent o f GDP under ou r baseline scenario. A po ten t ia l 
risk associated with external debt sustainability i s a sharp exchange rate depreciation. A 
depreciation o f the rea l exchange rate in excess o f 15 percent within one year w o u l d 
increase the to ta l external debt to GDP ra t io from about 27 percent at end-2007, t o over 
30 percent o f GDP, w h i c h i s manageable leve l . In a worst case scenario, where the 
current account deteriorates t o mo re than 5 percent o f GDP w h i l e the non-debt f lows 
decline w o u l d put considerable pressure o n external indebtedness. U n d e r this scenario, 
external debt w i l l jump f r o m about 27 percent o f GD P up t o 35.2 percent o f GDP. 
Although this represents a sharp increase, i t i s n o t l i k e l y t o generate a crisis.

COLOMB IA CAS COMPLET ION REPORT 

EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

In t roduc t ion 

Th is report presents the self-evaluation by t h e Bank G roup C o l om b i a coun t ry t e am o f 
the Coun t ry Assistance Strategy f o r Co lomb ia f o r FY 0 3 -FY 0 7 . I t re fe rs t o the o r ig ina l 
CAS, numbe r 25129-C0, dated December 24, 2002, and the C A S Progress Report, 
numbe r 32999 -C0 , dated September 9,2005. 

C A S Obiectives 

The Bank Group’s 2002 C A S was geared t o support the country’s quest f o r peace by 
helping to: (1) achieve fast and sustainable growth; (2) share the h i t s o f that g row th ; and 
(3) build efficient, accountable, and transparent governance. Operations we re expected t o 
have a tangible impac t o n pove r ty reduction, he lp Co lomb ia mee t i t s Millennium 
Deve lopmen t Goals, res tore mac ro -s tab i l i ty and sustainable growth, and incorporate 
lessons o f ongo ing p i l o t t interventions with impo r tan t demonstration effects. The 2005 
Progress Repo r t extended the CAS by one year, while conso l ida t ing and expanding the 
o r ig ina l focus on the peace process and o n a result-based cu l tu re in the public sector. The 
results o f the C A S are presented below. 

Coun t ry Con tex t 

An impo r tan t d imens ion o f th is self-evaluation i s t o p o s i t i o n the 2002 C A S in the 
context o f cond i t ions in Co lomb ia when the C A S was prepared. 
First, a new 
adm in is t ra t ion was t a k i n g over, just after peace negotiations with the m a i n insurgency 
force b roke down . President Uribe was elected with a sizeable m a j o r i t y and a mandate t o 
address Co lomb ia ’s ever increasing l e v e l s o f violence and armed con f l ic ts . Second, the 
economy has n o t yet recovered f r om the deep d i f f icu l t ies con f ron ted in 1999. Ma rke ts 
f o r emerging markets we re shaken by the c r is is in Argentina; Co lomb ia ’s g r ow t h in 2001 
was s t i l l weak; and pove r ty and unemployed remained high. F isca l discipline, at the end 
o f the p rev ious administration, had deteriorated s ign i f ican t ly in the f i r s t h a l f o f 2002. 
Third, cons t i tu t iona l changes, adopted in 1991 , h a d been t rans fo rm ing Colombia’s 
adm in is t ra t ive and j u d i c i a l structures, giving f isca l and adm in is t ra t ive respons ib i l i t ies to 
sub-national governments and empowe r ing independent j u d i c i a l bod ies that inc reas ing ly 
acted as checks o n executive powers. These three factors in f luenced considerably the 
shape o f the C A S with respect t o the Bank’s ro le and the p lanned support f o r Co lomb ia . 

Coun t ry Outcomes 

In contrast to the s t a r t o f the C A S period, conditions in C o l om b i a have substantially 

73 

improved, even though many ind ica to rs are n o be t te r today than they we re in the ea r ly 
1990s. The greatest ga in has been in the area o f peace and security. As shown in the 
2005 Progress Repo r t and in the Government’s eva lua t ion o f i t s 2002-2006 N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t Plan, v io lence has fa l len sharply, even though the s i tua t ion remains fragile. 
O n the s ide o f economy, growth, emp loymen t and p o v e r t y reduction have seen sizeable 
gains. S t i l l , Co lomb ia faces very high levels o f p o v e r t y and, despite recent progress, 
income inequality remains pervasive. The coun t ry advanced in mee t ing i t s Millennium 
Deve lopmen t Goals, p r o v i d i n g the p o o r with a m o r e extensive safety net and expanding 
access t o social services. In t e rm s o f f isca l performance, a comb ina t ion o f strong g loba l 
markets, high o i l prices, f a l l i n g interest rates, increased domestic confidence because o f 
the que l l ing o f violence, and the Government’s o w n f isca l and tax reforms, supported by 
the Bank and the other I F I s , the s i tua t ion has m u c h imp roved . The m a i n tex t o f the repo r t 
p rov ides details o n these outcomes. 

The G roup Bank ’s Con t r ibu t ion 

The 2002 C A S ou t l ined a p rog ram o f US$3 .3 b i l l i o n , m o r e than doub led average 
annual B a n k lend ing t o Colombia, peaking at close t o US$1 b i l l i o n in FY05 . Similarly, 
IFC ’ s support grew rap id ly , especially as the economy revived. The C A S was n o t 
resulted based but geared towards rea l iz ing a series o f measures expected t o con t r ibu te 
towards the ove ra l l goals which, in turn, were t o support the coun t ry ’s rea l iza t ion o f i t s 
N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan and i t s M D G s o n the l o n g term. I n t e r im M D G s we re set. A s 
shown in the 2005 C A S Progress Report, and updated here , Co lomb ia has done w e l l in 
implementing i t s development p l a n and has progressed in mee t ing mos t MDGs. 
Howeve r , there were few quantitative benchmarks set in the C A S and l i t t l e d i rec t l inkage 
between the Bank ’s interventions and the M D G s per se. A s a resu l t , the Bank’s 
con t r ibu t ion and i t s performance a re assessed o n the basis o f coun t ry l e v e l indicators, 
feedback, p roduc t outcomes, and available quantitative data. 

Eva lua t ion o f C A S Performance 

With the above l im i ta t ions in mind and taking i n t o account the weight that can be 
a t t r ibu ted t o d i f fe ren t dimensions o f the Bank’s w o r k in Colombia, the coun t ry team 
concludes that the Bank Group’s C A S performance was satisfactory, Based o n the 
evidence found, the B a n k G roup has h a d a pos i t ive impac t o n Colombia’s ove ra l l macro- 
situation, the solidness o f i t s f inanc ia l sector, the p r om o t i o n o f the p r iva te sector, and 
access t o better qua l i ty and affordable transport, wa te r and sanitation services. T h e Bank 
was also i n f l u e n t i a l in shaping n ew p u b l i c po l ic ies and programs f o r sustainable 
development and disaster vu lne rab i l i ty reduction. 
Impo r tan t ly , the Bank he lped shape 
Co lomb ia ’s emerging social p o l i c y framework, im p r o v i n g the coverage and q u a l i t y o f 
social services, and dev is ing a mo re cohesive social safety n e t f o r the poo r . T h e Bank 
has further h a d a pos i t ive impact, v i a p i l o t operations, o n finding wo rkab le solutions f o r 
Co lomb ia ’s long-standing problems o f con f l ic t : a notable example i s the sca l ing up o f 
the Peace and Deve lopmen t Program. Also, a l though the route taken by the Bank t o 
demonstrate h o w to incorporate equity and i n c l u s i o n i n t o p u b l i c p o l i c y analysis took a 
different turn, the approach o f inco rpo ra t ing M&E and the concerns o f ma rg ina l ized 

74 

peoples i n t o specific operations, mos t n o t a b l y in the soc ia l sectors and GEF, has spurred 
attention t o these groups. These accomplishments a re described in the m a i n text. 

That i s n o t t o say that there are n o t areas that did n o t advance as o r i g i n a l l y planned. 
T h e Bank ’s support f o r the third pillar o f the p rog ram -bu i ld ing e f f ic ien t , accountable 
and transparent govemance-showed 
the least progress even though the re have been 
advances in establishing a results-based management cu l tu re and in rea l iz ing other areas 
o f the Government’s Adm in is t ra t ive R e f o rm P rog ram n o t d i rec t ly supported by the Bank. 
There was l i t t l e con t rac t ion o f the p u b l i c sector and/or reduc t ion in mandated spending 
p e r se, one o f the goals set under the mac ro - program. Yet, spending has been con t ro l led 
especially at the sub-national level; the re has been a shift in spending towards the soc ia l 
sectors, U S $ 1 b i l l i o n per year o r r o u g h l y 3.4 percent o f t o t a l spending; and the q u a l i t y o f 
this spending has fhrther imp roved v i a targeting. Moreover, the e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c 
services, such as tax administration, has increased considerably. Further, the Bank’s 
planned support t o address co r rup t ion did n o t advance, n o r did anticipated Bank support 
f o r SMEs. Programs focused o n the r u r a l sector were less amb i t ious than planned, while 
progress in the p i l o t j u d i c i a l sector development p ro jec t has been s low t o t r igge r m o r e 
widespread reforms. 

The po r t fo l io , consisting o f 23 operations, has con f ron ted f ew p rob lems during 
imp lemen ta t ion . A l l performance indicators, i n c l u d i n g p ro jec t outcomes, are better than 
Co lomb ia ’s h is to r ica l average and above the average f o r the Bank as a w h o l e and f o r the 
L a t i n Ame r ica and Caribbean Region. The in t roduc t ion o f coun t ry systems has been 
we lcomed by the Government and has fac i l i ta ted imp lemen ta t ion . Generally, Bank 
f inanc ing has been m o r e selective than o r i g i n a l l y planned. Some areas i d e n t i f i e d f o r 
support, men t ioned above, f e l l by the w a y side. Responding f l e x i b l y t o oppo r tun i t ies as 
they arose, new thrusts were added, building o n those areas in w h i c h the Bank has a l o n g 
standing presence. 

Lessons f o r Future Coun t ry Partnership Strategies 

This evaluation demonstrates the bene f i ts o f s o l i d ana ly t ica l w o r k and e f fec t ive and 
f lex ib le coun t ry collaboration. Lessons that might b e u s e f h l f o r the p repa ra t ion and 
design o f the com ing Coun t ry Partnership Strategy are as fo l lows : 

Exe rc is ing F i d u c i a l y Responsibilities 

0 The Bank, along w i th the IMF, has a f iduc ia ry responsibility, especially o n debt 
sustainability, f isca l performance, the f inanc ia l sector, and m o n i t o r i n g o f p u b l i c 
expenditures, pove r ty and the MDGs t o which the B a n k should rema in committed. In 
the case o f Colombia, the Bank was e f fec t ive in keep ing issues o n the f ron t b um e r 
once the worst o f the 1999 crisis was over. 

Tempering Zea l w i t h Realism 

New administrations tend t o have amb i t ious plans, as was the case o f the f i r s t U r i b e 

75 

Adm in is t ra t ion ’s i n i t i a l approach t o f isca l and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms . In retrospect, i t 
m a y not have been rea l is t ic t o agree-in 
the early mon ths o f a n e w administration- 
t o p o l i c y triggers, cove r ing ac t ion fou r years ahead. In fact, many re fo rms confronted 
serious lega l and p o l i t i c a l hu r t les and have taken longe r than o r i g i n a l l y anticipated. 
On the other hand, the Bank cannot stand in the way , so th is lesson i s nuanced t o 
specific coun t ry circumstances. 

Setting Targets and C a r v i n g ou t In te rmed ia te Eva lua t ions of P rog ramma t ic Loans 

Programmatic operations may pose a challenge in terms o f agreeing ex-ante to 
triggers and measuring impacts. T o the extent possible, expected outcomes shou ld b e 
established at the s ta r t . Ex-post, i n d i v i d u a l evaluations o f each l o a n in the series as 
they are completed might be too short t e r m a t im e f rame f o r impac ts t o be realized. 
Some fo rm o f mid-way, intermediate assessment and/or ESW might be needed t o 
recon f i rm the d i rec t ion and/or make m i d - t e rm corrections. 

B u i l d i n g o n What W o r h 

L o o k i n g b road ly at whe re the B a n k has been e f fec t ive in Co lomb ia , w o r k i n g in 
sectors w i th a h is to ry o f Bank invo lvemen t and with established ins t i tu t iona l 
responsibilities and capacities seem t o w o r k best in Co lomb ia . This argues f o r 
con t inu ing an evolving, p rog ramma t ic approach and concentrating on and deepening 
those areas with con t inu i ty f r om one C A S t o another. 

B u i l d i n g Consensus and Ins t i tu t iona l Homes for New In i t ia t ives 

The lack o f progress in areas such as a n t i - c om p t i o n and j u d i c i a l r e f o rm calls f o r 
rethinking the Bank’s approach t o new in i t ia t ives . The ana ly t ica l g round f o r an 
i n i t i a t i v e needs to b e s o l i d l y and conv inc ing ly established and the ins t i tu t iona l base 
established ex-ante. F o r the new CAS , the lesson might b e p r i o r ESW and consensus 
building plus con t inu ing investment t o in form p o l i c y makers and the p u b l i c during 
imp lemen ta t ion o f p i l o t operations so that the g r ow i n g evidence o f wha t wo rks can be 
shared with a larger audience. 

Refocusing on the R u r a l Sector: C los ing the Gaps 

A new approach t o the r u r a l sector, with attendant attention t o Co lomb ia ’s ex t reme ly 
poo r and marginalized, m a y be t ime ly , as the security p ic tu re imp roves . I t was a 
p r i o r i t y in the 2002 C A S but l i t t l e ma te r ia l ized in terms o f specific lending. 
Nevertheless, the Bank unde r took ample analysis o f the sector: the p o l i c y notes fo r 
the C A S and other ana ly t ica l w o r k have p rov ided evidence that the r u r a l sector was 
important, dynamic, and disadvantaged. 
Impo r tan t ly , the Bank has supported a 
number o f successful p i l o t ru ra l development and peace in i t ia t ives w h i c h c o u l d be 
scaled up. L o o k i n g ahead, i t may be helpful t o segment strategies across r u r a l and 
urban sub-groups as was done in education. Other sectors amenable t o this approach 
are housing, water and sanitation-typified 
by the L a Gua j i ra P ro jec t now under 

76 

preparation-and 

transport. 

Re ly ing on L o c a l Capacity 

0 Colombia, as a Middle Income Country, 
i s capable o f assuming the lead in 
deve lop ing and imp lemen t ing the C A S in ways tha t other countries might no t . Th is i s 
pa r t icu la r ly the case in pa r t ic ipa t ion . The Bank can ‘piggy-back” o n those e f fo r ts 
rather than do o w n pa ra l le l exercise. Mo reove r , the case o f C o l om b i a demonstrates 
that M I C s with solid ins t i tu t iona l capacity can b e entrusted t o use coun t ry based 

sys tems . 

Re ta in ing F l e x i b i l i t y 

Ano the r ha l lma rk o f w o r k i n g with a Middle Income Coun t ry i s f l e x i b i l i t y . The Bank 
has been flexible i s responding t o Co lomb ia ’s chang ing economic and social 
cond i t ions especially as the country’s cond i t ions im p r o v e d beyond wha t was expected 
and when some aspects o f the o r ig ina l C A S we re n o t feasible a n d o r did n o t en joy 
full ownership. The C A S Progress Repo r t i s an example o f h o w to accommodate 
M I C needs and conditions. Th is i s an attribute which should be carried over t o the 
nex t CAS . 

Synch ron iz ing T im i n g and M o n i t o r i n g of Development P l a n n i n g Instruments 

The 2002 C A S was prepared at a c r i t i c a l momen t in Colombia, compounded by 
transitions at senior levels in b o t h the Bank and the Government. The bene f i t o f 
p repa r ing the C A S quickly was i t s t im e l y assistance t o the country. But the cost was 
a l a c k o f in te rna l iza t ion and re in fo rcemen t among the k e y development strategy 
instruments that the coun t ry employs, no tab ly t h e N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan, and a 
lack o f common m o n i t o r i n g definitions, 
too ls and benchmarks. Admittedly, 
development i s an evo lv ing process and new needs can b e address over time. The 
new C A S i s the opportunity t o avo id the gaps in timing and t o focus o n results. 

I n t e r n a l i z i n g Equ i ty and Mean ing fu l ly Measu r ing Pove r ty 

0 The Bank’s e f fo r ts at in te rna l iz ing equ i ty considerations i n t o i t s operations and 
ana ly t ica l wo rk , while tak ing a different track, seem t o have energized B a n k s t a f f and 
loca l authorities t o t a k e up the concerns o f the ex t reme ly poo r and ma rg ina l ized as 
part o f a g r ow i n g M&E culture. Th is momentum can b e elevated t o the nex t stage by 
gene ra l iz ing analysis o f equity, n o t j u s t in social sector and GEF operations, but in 
other p roposed po l ic ies . In addition, agreement o n targets presumes agreement o n 
methodologies for measuring poverty, among other indicators, w h i c h i s n o w lacking. 
The focus o f targeted programs, moreover, can b e tightened with con t inued 
re f inemen t o f Colombia’s system o f c lass i fy ing e l ig ib le beneficiaries.

2. Colombia’s Development Strategy 

At the start o f his Adm in is t ra t ion in August 2002 (after elections in M a y 2002), 
President Uribe announced a comprehensive development strategy f o r h i s term. This 
strategy, en t i t led “Towards a Communa l State”, 
l a i d ou t the b r o a d goals f o r the 
Government f r o m 2002 t o 2006. 
I t was re in fo rced by m o r e detailed p rog rams in the 
na t iona l investment p rog ram covering the authorized investments t o be f inanced with 
p u b l i c resources, inc lud ing bo r row ings f r o m the W o r l d Bank and other mu l t i la te ra l 
development banks. Co lomb ia ’s development strategy was further enhanced by the 
Millennium Development Goals A c t i o n Plan and the results o f the 2004 Comm iss ion on 
the Strategy t o Reduce Pove r ty and Inequa l i ty . The strategy emphasized the f o l l ow i n g :

reforms, 

(d) 

These p r io r i t ies re f lec ted Co lomb ia ’s s i tua t ion as o f 2002 and we re designed t o 
address those factors keep ing Co lomb ia f r o m rea l iz ing i t s development potential. The 
f i r s t was the b reakdown o f peace negotiations w i th the m a i n insu rgency group in 
February 2002, after three years o f negotiations, and the con t inu ing escalation o f 
violence. 
D isappo in tmen t and f rus t ra t ion were widespread. Many indicators 
demonstrated the wo rsen ing cond i t ions : the land devoted t o growing coca, the numbe r o f 
persons displaced by conflicts, the number o f armed combatants, kidnappings, murders, 
attacks, and stealing o f cars. A l l had increased during the 199Os, espec ia l ly after 1999. 
Second, the economy, while d o i n g better than in 1999 when C o l om b i a faced i t s wo rs t 
economic c r i s i s in 70 years, was s t i l l struggling: in 2001, g r ow t h was o n l y about 1.4 
percent and decelerated in the f i r s t quarter o f 2002; unemp loymen t was in the range o f 15 
percent; and pove r ty reached 60 percent o f the popu la t ion as compared t o 50 percent in 
1997. Moreover, the f isca l and debt s i tua t ion was o n a d ow nw a r d spiral, exacerbated by 
the economic c r is is in 1999, increased costs re la t ing t o security, and the s low economy 
recovery. 
Impo r tan t ly , t h e 199 1 Constitution, op t im is t ica l ly l o o k i n g ahead t o an i n f l o w 
o f pe t ro leum revenues , h a d se t in m o t i o n a new dynam ic that increased manda to ry 
spending f o r pensions and decentralized social programs. A s a result, the gap between 
revenues and expenses stood at mo re than 6 percent o f GDP as o f 2000, with a 
commensurate increase in Colombia’s p u b l i c debt. 

I t should be no ted that Co lomb ia ’s M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) we re n o t 
e x p l i c i t l y referenced in the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan. Indeed, the Government’s ac t ion 
p l a n t o meet those goals by 2015 was only prepared in M a r c h 2005, w e l l after the 
N a t i o n a l P lan was approved. Further, the country’s Strategy t o Reduce Pove r ty and 
Inequa l i ty was elaborated in a subsequent stage and was approved in September 2005. 
As a resu l t , the re was considerable evo lu t ion o n the s ide o f the Gove rnmen t on i t s 
development p r io r i t ies since the 2002 C A S was prepared. W h i l e many MDGs were 
addressed at that time, such as education, vaccinations and other p u b l i c hea l th issues, 
several areas, no tab ly reduc ing maternal mo r ta l i ty , were n o t e x p l i c i t l y addressed. These 
are areas where the Government’s MDG A c t i o n Plan indicates that a m o r e aggressive and 
concerted stance needs to be taken.

lending, was supportive o f the Government’s strategy and was designed in p a r a l l e l t o the 
preparation o f the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan. B o t h documents shared a numbe r o f

common analyses and bene f i ted f r o m the p o l i c y notes prepared by the B a n k in 
an t ic ipa t ion o f the new administration. 
There was congruence in many areas. 
Neve r the less , the re was d iscon t inu i ty in timing, with the C A S f ina l ized be fo re the 
Na t iona l Plan. This created a gap between the C A S and the Government’s specific p lans 
and limited the a b i l i t y t o ga in a common app rec ia t ion o f wha t i t w o u l d take t o advance in 
n ew areas, such as anti-corruption, where there was n o t already a t rack reco rd and an 
established ins t i tu t iona l base. F ina l ly , there were s ign i f ican t changes in senior pos i t ions 
in b o t h the Bank and the Government that co inc ided w i th t h e p repa ra t ion o f the CAS . I t 
i s therefore n o t su rp r is ing that the C A S p rog ram was m o d i f i e d during imp lemen ta t ion as 
described in subsequent sections. Nevertheless, the core o f the program, especially i t s 
focus o n p o l i c y reforms, rema ined in tact. 

The 2002 C A S established the f o l l ow i n g fou r p i l la rs : 

(a) Achieving Fast and Sustainable G row th

in t roduced mod i f ica t ions t o the thrust o f the o r i g i n a l CAS, ad jus t ing t o the latest coun t ry 
cond i t ions and new emphases. In the case o f the IFC , i t s updated strategy centered on: (i) 
strengthening and deepening o f f inanc ia l sector ins t i tu t ions and l o c a l f inanc ia l markets t o 
better serve the needs o f l o c a l companies, i n c l u d i n g SMEs and m i c r o enterprises; (ii) the

t o sub-national e n t i t i e s in the p r o v i s i o n o f infrastructure, in coo rd ina t ion with the Bank; 
(iii) investment in extractive industries; and (iv) the mode rn iza t ion o f C o l om b i a n 
businesses to he lp imp rove the i r competitiveness and support the i r expansion b o t h 
domes t ica l ly and abroad. O n the side o f the Bank, the f i rs t change was t o expand the 
agenda for supporting improvements t o Co lomb ia ’s competitiveness, with a n ew series o f 
DPLs, not anticipated in the o r ig ina l CAS . In addition, the Progress Repo r t added a 
component under the Governance pillar t o strengthen and systematize the Government’s 
approach and capacity t o m o n i t o r and evaluate public programs. This new component fit 
w e l l within the CAS ’S o r ig ina l emphasis o n instilling results-based management in the 
p u b l i c sector. 

The other m o d i f i c a t i o n was t o add a new p i l l a r e x p l i c i t l y to support the Government’s 
peace e f fo r t . In effect, this n ew pillar consolidated actions anticipated unde r other C A S 
pillars and p rov ided con t inu i ty t o programs that have a imed to support peace and 
development under p r i o r CASs. This change gave an e x p l i c i t focus t o the peace process

Colombia’s Progress towards its Goals 

The Government has made v e r y good progress in rea l iz ing the goals o f i t s 2002-2006 
N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan. 
I t s own eva lua t ion shows that 85-90 percent o f the 
measures and resources under the P l a n have been realized. T h e Gove rnmen t has pursued 
close m o n i t o r i n g o f the Plan’s execu t ion and unde r took dedicated evaluations o f m a j o r 
social programs, with Bank support. Such focus i s evidence o f the g r ow i n g cu l tu re o f

A r e a dedicated t o coca cu l t iva t ion reduced f r om about 160,000 hectares in 2001 t o

Sustainable Growth and Employment 

The economy responded to the greater sense o f peace and s tab i l i ty . S o l i d macro- 
po l ic ies and positive in te rna t iona l economy cond i t ions also helped. Reac t iva t ion has 
been mos t noticeable in the jump in p r iva te sector investment. A s a result, the economy 
has grown faster f r o m 2003 t o 2006 than i t had since the ea r ly 199Os, with attendant 
effects o n unemployment, poverty, and income equality. At the same time, the 
Government has advanced in i t s agenda f o r natural resource management and 
environmental p ro tec t ion and expanding infrastructure services. Some ind ica to rs o f 
progress are:

A b o u t 5.8 million hectares o f land were p laced under t h e system o f p ro tec ted areas, a 
50 pe rcen t increase over the amount in 2002. 

E q u i t y and Social Reac t iva t ion 

A f t e r seeing the e f fec ts o f the 1999 c r is is o n the poor, the U r i b e Adm in is t ra t ion made 
a concerted e f fo r t t o consolidate and expand i t s social p ro tec t ion network, focus ing o n the 
Fam i l ias en Accion P rog ram which p rov ides cond i t iona l grants t o p o o r fam i l ies . I t also 
invested considerable resources in expanding access t o education, decentralizing 
educational services, adding t o the r o l l s o f the poo r w h o obtained subsidized hea l th 
insurance, expanding nu t r i t iona l support and focus ing m o r e a t ten t ion t o displaced 
populations. M a j o r achievements are: 

The percentage o f the popu la t ion b e l ow the pove r ty l i n e f e l l f r o m 57 percent in 2002 
t o 49 percent in 2005. 
The Gini coe f f ic ien t peaked in 1999 at over 0.59 but f e l l t o 0.55 in 2005. 
Some 70,000 f a m i l i e s have been added t o the Fam i l ias en Accion, not i n c l u d i n g 
displaced fam i l ies . In total, 515,000 fam i l ies bene f i ted as o f 2005. 
By 2005, 8 m i l l i o n m o r e p o o r people have been added t o the subsidized system o f 
hea l th insurance since 2002, bringing to ta l coverage o f the b o t t om t w o income rungs

The rate o f vaccinations, w h i c h had fa l len during the 1999 crisis, recovered and 
increased f r o m 82 percent in 2002 to 89 percent in 2005. 
One m i l l i o n p o o r ch i ld ren are n o w served breakfasts, up f r o m o n l y 78,000 in 2002,

T ranspa rency a n d E f f ic iency o f the Public Sector 

The f rag i le f isca l situation, g r ow i n g debt, and wo r r ies about competitiveness and the 
qua l i ty o f public services put the re fo rm o f the p u b l i c sector at the fo re o f the 
Adm in is t ra t ion ’s agenda in 2002. 
The Government embarked o n a p rog ram o f

i n f o rm a t i o n systems, re in fo rce in te rna l controls and reo r ien t the bureaucracy’s cu l tu re 
towards results. W h i l e progress was uneven and expenditures have rema ined re la t ive ly 
f i x e d as a percentage o f GDP, pens ion surpluses have increased as have tax collections, 

83 

thanks t o reduced evasion, increased rates and greater e f f ic iency . There has been progress 
in a numbe r o f areas, as fo l lows : 

Adm in is t ra t ive overheads reduced f r o m 4.4 percent o f GDP t o 4.1 percent f r o m 2001 
t o 2005, albeit short o f the goa l o f 3 percent. 
A lm o s t 30,000 c i v i l service pos i t ions have been e l im ina ted since 2002. 
Red-tape and bureaucracy has been reduced: the numbe r o f steps t o expo r t products 
and the steps to start a n ew enterprise has f a l l e n f r o m 29 to one and from 17 to one, 
respectively. The average t im e t o secure an env i ronmen ta l license d ropped f r o m 130

The share o f p u b l i c investments evaluated ex-post rose from 4 percent in 2001 t o 2 4 
percent in 2006. 
T a x co l lec t ion e f f ic iency has gone up with ove ra l l taxes increasing by 34 percent in

T h e Bank Group’s main focus was on 
encouraging sound macro-fiscal policies, 
stimulating a supply response, and shoring 
up the financial sector after the 1999 c r i s i s . 
T h e economy has responded well and so has 
the financial sector. T h e Bank supported, 
via a se r ies o f Fiscal and Institutional DPLs 
and a TAL, improved fiscal management. 
T h e results were most evident on tax policy 
and administration and keeping spending in- 
check. Pension reforms have led to higher 
surpluses, transfers to sub-national 
governments curbed, and t h e public debt 
burden has fallen as a share o f GDP. The 
Bank worked to strengthen banking 
supervision and resolution and encourage 
development o f the regulatory framework 
for the insurance industry and capital 
markets. Continued support fo r financial 
sector reform, based on recent analytical 
work, i s provided under the Business 
Environment and Competitiveness DPLs 
which also address ways to bolster the 
private sector, complementing IFC and 
M IGA . IFC continues to have a robust level 
o f activity, supporting capital markets, 
SMEs, manufacturing, water and sanitation 
services, and o i l and gas. T h e Bank has 
further provided support to improve and 
expand urban in fras truc ture , especially in 
transport, water and sanitation, 
environmental management, disaster

PROGRESS DUR ING CAS 
W h i l e levels are s t i l l high, and no better than 
they were in the early 199Os, poverty and 
inequality have f a l l e n s ince 2002. Building 
on the Bank’s ea r l ie r work on mitigating the 
social consequences o f the 1999 c r is is , the 
Bank engaged the Government in an 
extensive policy dialogue and financed 
se r ies o f Social and Labor Adjustment DPLs 
that encouraged adoption and 
implementation o f a comprehensive 
approach to social protection, and supported 
reforms in health, education, and labor 
training. In addition, i t complemented this 
support with financing for expansion o f 
higher education, rural education, 
decentralizing education services, and the 
social safety ne t . 
The re has been general but uneven progress 
in the Government’s Public Administration 
reform program, part o f which has been 
supported under the FIALs, T A L and 
investment programs. Efficiency o f some 
public se rv ices (e.g. tax administration and 
education) seems to have gone up and there 
has been a shift to targeted social programs. 
According to the Bank’s Governance 
indicators, Colombia’s relative rating has 
improved during the 2002-2005 period. T h e 
Transparency International index o f 
corruption has also moved in the right 
direction. However, progress in the specific 
areas identified for support from the Bank 
has been mixed. Progress has been slow on 
piloting judicial reforms and Bank support 
has no t materialized for anti-corruption. On 
the other hand, there has been progress in 
results-based management. T h e Bank’s 
support for these efforts has been via the 
ongoing Financial Management I 1 T A L and 
the new M&E operation. 
T h e Government has been effective in 
reducing the level o f violence in the country 
and has made progress in reaching 
agreements with para-military forces. T h e 
Bank’s contribution over the years, starting 
in the mid-l990s, has been to build up a 
knowledge base on the nature o f the 
conflicts and to focus on the people affected 
by the conflicts. T h e successful approach, 
piloted under the two Magdalena Medio 
projects, has scaled up to six regions. T h e 
Bank also helped focus attention on 
integrating social programs for displaced 
persons. More recently, work has begun on 
an expanded agenda agreed with the 
Government in the CAS Progress Report. 
However, the situation remains fragile and i t 
i s too soon to measure further progress in 
implementing the peace pillar. 

Pillar One: Achieving Fast and Sustainable Growth 

Overall. Increasing the pace o f economic g r ow t h was a high p r i o r i t y in the 2002 C A S 
and coun t ry r e s u l t s have been encouraging. A s shown in Tab le 1, the g r ow t h rate 
steadily increased over the 2002-2005 pe r iod with exports, especially non - t rad i t iona l 
ones, almost doub l ing the l e v e l o f exports in 2006 as compared t o 2002. G r ow t h has 
been b road based, l e d by the pe t ro leum -m in ing sector, construction, telecommunications 
and agro-industries. W h i l e the agriculture sector was not among the fastest g r ow i n g 
sectors, i t showed pos i t ive results with a substantial increase in b o t h p roduc t ion and the 
to ta l area cultivated: due t o the lack o f security, the amount o f land be ing cu l t iva ted h a d 
sharply dropped since the ea r ly 1990s. Increased economic g r ow t h h a d pos i t ive impacts 
o n unemployment, pove r ty and income equality.

Mac ro -econom ic Performance. Res to r ing the macro-underpinnings o f Colombia’s 
growth strategy was a fundamental consideration w h e n framing the 2002 CAS . W i t h o u t 
so l id f isca l management, i t was concluded tha t g r ow t h c o u l d n o t b e sustained and, 
without greater growth, the pub l ic ’s lack o f confidence and the grinding effects o f 
pove r ty and v io lence would undermine a successful outcome o f the coun t ry ’s e f fo r ts t o 
achieve peace. T w o dimensions stood ou t in the 2002 CAS : the f isca l d e f i c i t and the 
p u b l i c debt burden. Pub l ic spending h a d increased almost 10 percentage po in ts o f GDP 
since 1990, the resu l t o f cons t i tu t iona l changes tha t mandated transfers f o r pensions and 
to sub-nationals and rising interest charges, w i t h o u t commensurate increases in revenue, 
resulting in g r ow i n g deficits. O n a func t iona l basis, the sectors seeing the largest 
increases in p u b l i c spending were education, health, defense, security and jus t ice . The 
rising p u b l i c sector debt burden fu r the r aggravated the f isca l s i tua t ion by inc reas ing 
interest expenses. There has been considerable progress o n b o t h fronts, thanks in pa r t t o 
the IFIS’ support over this C A S pe r iod and the p rev ious one.

the Government’s r e f o rm e f fo r t : im p r o v i n g the tax system, r e f o rm i n g the soc ia l security 
system, and strengthening sub-national finances under the Cons t i tu t iona l Amendmen t in 
2001 and the 2003 F i s c a l Respons ib i l i ty L aw . These areas were the focus o f B a n k 
support under the FSAL (FY02) and the series o f F isca l and Ins t i tu t iona l Adjustment 
(FIAL) DPLs (see B o x 1). 
Im p r o v e d tax co l lec t ion alone i s estimated t o represent one 
percent o f GDP (see C E M 2005). 
This table further shows that: 
(1) while the 
Government was n o t able to reduce current expenditures as a share o f GDP, i t held the 
l i n e after even a l l ow i n g f o r a modest increase o f 0.2 percent o f GDP f o r military 
expenditures; (2) changes t o Co lomb ia ’s cost o f b o r r ow i n g did n o t have an appreciable 
affect on the n e t result; and (3) increased revenues f r om pe t ro leum roya l t ies and o i l 
p ro f i ts , while h a v i n g a pos i t ive effect, were n o t t h e determining factor in explaining the 
pos i t ive outcome o f Co lomb ia ’s p u b l i c finances in the 2002-2005 pe r iod . 
impo r tan t to no te that, although expenditures did not increase s ign i f ican t ly as a share o f 
GDP, there has been a shift in the sectoral d is t r ibu t ion o f that spending, with about US$1 
b i l l i o n per year o r about 3.4 percent o f to ta l expenditure redirected in favo r o f spending 
in the social sectors, as described in la te r sections.

In addition, I F C

providing US$188 million in to ta l f o r nine transactions, F inanc ing was m o s t l y l o c a l 
currency to better serve the nature o f those projects. 

In housing finance, with the a i m t o deepen the liquidity o f the mo r tgage market and 
foster Colombia’s cap i ta l markets, I F C con t inued t o b a c k the t rans fo rma t ion o f the 
mortgage sector w h i c h was b a d l y hit when the hous ing p r i c e bubb le burst during the 
1999 c r i s i s . Mo r tgage f inanc ing continues to decline as a share o f t o t a l loans. 
IFC ’ s 
primary support was th rough p a r t i a l c red i t guarantees, w h i c h amounted t o U S $ 4 6 m i l l i o n 
enhancing the r a t i n g and enab l ing the leverage in the size o f the b o n d issues. T h i s

As re f lec ted in the C A S Progress report, I F C has also p laced a greater focus on m ic ro

In addition, in FY 0 6 , I F C p a r t i a l l y

The Bank has been an ac t ive partner in the sector, as no ted above, building on the 
w o r k that had been done at the he igh t o f the b a n k i n g c r is is unde r the F inanc ia l Sector

As po in ted ou t by IEG, the primary accomplishment o f the Bank -suppo r ted w o r k in 
the f inanc ia l sector so far has been the establishment o f an appropriate lega l and 
ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk fo r the f inanc ia l markets, even though the effectiveness o f these 
measures has yet t o b e tested under s tress . The 2005 FSAP showed that the banking 
system continues t o b e dom ina ted by f inanc ia l conglomerates; the l e v e l o f p rov is ion ing 
o f non -pe r fo rm ing loans was s t i l l re la t ive ly low ; corporate res t ruc tu r ing remains biased 
against 
f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions ; and the sector s u f f e r s f r o m the taxes o n f inanc ia l 
transactions. The Bank’s latest analysis, we l l rece ived by the Government, con f i rms the 
con t inu ing weaknesses. As pa r t o f i t s ongo ing r e f o rm program, the Government asked 
the Bank in F Y 0 6 t o p r o v i d e techn ica l advice t o assess the o v e r a l l system, i d e n t i f y lega l 
and regu la to ry bottlenecks, r e v i ew c red i to r r i g h t s and inso lvency procedures, c red i t 
reporting, the costs o f f inanc ia l regulations, and the f inanc ia l dimensions o f re fo rms t o 
the pens ion system. Thus, w h i l e there has b e e n considerable progress, the re i s m o r e t o do 
to strengthen regu la t ion o f banking, insurance, pensions, and the security market a long 
with measures 
t o 
imp rove 
the payment system and reduce corporate sector 
vu lne rab i l i t ies . These conclusions have been inco rpo ra ted i n t o in i t ia t ives cu r ren t ly being 
taken by the Government, such as drafts o f a new inso lvency l a w and the habeas data 
law, and a re b e i n g built i n t o the package o f re fo rms supported by the Business 
P roduc t iv i ty and E f f i c i e n c y D P L s (see below). 

In f ras t ruc tu re t o Foster Competitiveness and Im p r o v e Services f o r the Poor. During 
the CAS period, the Bank Group continued t o support decentralized administrations and 
expansion o f basic p u b l i c services, with an attendant impac t o n the p o o r (see B o x 3). 
IFC’s support for in f ras t ruc tu re inc luded two projects undertaken by lead ing l o c a l 
players. A p rom inen t part o f the Bank’s e f fo r ts have been ongo ing support o f the

considered a m o d e l f o r reduc ing commu t ing times, espec ia l ly ove r longe r distances f r om

These e f fo r ts have h a d a pos i t ive impac t on access t o basic in f ras t ruc tu re services. 
As the Bank’s strategy in infrastructure has evo lved over time-first suppo r t ing m a j o r 
u rban centers and n o w reaching ou t t o m e d i um and smaller sized communities-services 
are n o w almost un ive rsa l among the urban popu la t ion . A c c o r d i n g t o B a n k statistics, 
im p r o v e d water and sanitation reaches 99 and 96 percent, respectively, o f the u rban 
popu la t ion . 
Impo r tan t ly , the rate o f im p r o v i n g coverage seems t o b e s l ow i n g with an 
increase o f o n l y one percentage p o i n t in wa te r services, f o r example, since 2002, with 
water u t i l i t i e s keeping pace w i th popu la t ion g row th . 
The rema in ing uncovered 
popu la t ions are n o w l i k e l y t o be living in ex t reme ly poo r pockets. Q u a l i t y o f services, 
however, can s t i l l be a p rob lem that needs t o b e overcome as many locales continue t o 
repo r t shortages and in te r rup t ions in service. Meanwh i le , the gap in service levels 
between urban and r u r a l populations continues: comparable f i g u r e s f o r coverage o f wa te r 
and sanitation in the r u r a l areas are 72 and 66 percent, ind ica t ing considerable r o o m f o r 
expanding access among r u r a l populations. The L a Gua j i ra Wa te r and Sanitation APL, 
cu r ren t ly unde r preparation, i s an example o f g r ow i n g attention t o r u r a l infrastructure. 

The third area o f emphasis in the 2002 C A S was support f o r im p r o v i n g Colombia’s 
capacity t o manage na tu ra l disasters. This p r i o r i t y emerged as a resu l t o f the 1999 
earthquake f o r w h i c h the Bank p rov ided emergency assistance. The Eme rgency 
Recove ry l o a n (US$225 m i l l i o n , approved M a r c h 2000 and closed Augus t 2002) was 
ra ted satisfactory in p r o v i d i n g shelter, rehab i l i ta t ing social and p u b l i c infrastructure, and 
p repa r ing n e w preparedness plans. An impo r tan t con t r ibu t ion was t o demonstrate the 
feas ib i l i ty o f reduc ing hous ing cons t ruc t ion costs and e f fec t ive decentralized 
imp lemen ta t ion . This pos i t ive experience led t o a broader discussion be tween the Bank 

93 

and the Government o n p reven t ive measures, appropriate building codes and con t ingency 
planning, and, as envisaged under the CAS, agreement t o proceed with an APL f o r 
Disaster V u l n e r a b i l i t y Reduc t ion ( f i r s t loan approved in FY05, US$260 m i l l i o n ; the 
second in FY06, US$SO m i l l ion ) . W h i l e i t i s too soon t o measure progress and the n ew 
system has yet to be tested, these operations p o i n t t o the po ten t ia l f o r impo r tan t gains. 

Unlike the Bank, I F C has been active in the o i l and gas sector. 
I t s strategy aims t o 
support l o c a l medium sized companies w h i l e assuring that the i r p ro jec ts meet high 
environmental, social and governance standards, and that revenues are used in a 
transparent and e f fec t ive manner. Consistent with this strategy, I F C has supported, with 
a US$15 m i l l i o n equity commitment, a smaller, 
l o c a l company w i th s ign i f ican t 
experience in Colombia’s energy industry, w h i c h i s dominated by la rge fo re ign and state 
companies. As the company demonstrated strong interest in long - te rm sustainable 
development, I F C i s also p r o v i d i n g techn ica l assistance in: (i) enhancing the use o f o i l 
and gas roya l t ies p a i d t o m u n i c i p a l governments, with the support by the hyd roca rbon 
association, the state regulator, and the company, and (ii) he lp ing company’s adop t ion o f 
the best practice env i ronmen ta l and social program, with a hnding m o b i l i z e d f r o m IFC ’s 
Corporate C i t izensh ip Fac i l i ty . This techn ica l assistance i s expected t o bring about the 
impac t beyond the company, at the sector leve l . I F C has also ventured i n t o the area o f 
na tu ra l gas, with a US$50 m i l l i o n senior loan t o a long - t ime c l ien t and one o f the f ew 
loca l ly -owned , experienced gas transmission companies in L a t i n Ame r ica . 
I F C i s 
supporting the company’s expansion strategy in na tu ra l gas transmission and d is t r ibu t ion 
business in Co lomb ia as we l l as other investments in the region, w h i c h i s expected t o 
he lp achieve enhancement o f basic in f ras t ruc tu re services, p r om o t i o n o f job -c rea t ing 
economic activities, and considerable env i ronmen ta l bene f i ts . 

Other segments o f in f ras t ruc tu re rece ived less support f r o m the Bank G roup during 
the C A S pe r iod f o r a numbe r o f reasons but that s i tua t ion i s starting t o change. First, in 
transport, f inanc ing o f infrastructure, especially roads, has t y p i c a l l y been shared by the 
Bank with C A F and the IDB, exp la in ing in large pa r t why the Bank has n o t h a d a 
presence since the 1990s. Th is s i tua t ion has been reversed and the Gove rnmen t has 
cu r ren t ly requested f inanc ia l support f r o m the Bank f o r n ew r o a d investments. In the 
case o f energy, w h i c h h a d been an impo r tan t pa r t o f the Bank -Co lomb ia engagement in 
the past, the sector has been, by and large, p r iva t ized . As a result, the B a n k has focused 
o n strengthening the sector’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity under the Powe r M a r k e t Deve lopmen t 
and Energy TAL (US$15 m i l l i o n , approved June 1997 and closed December 2002; ra ted 
satisfactory). In te rm o f the e lec t r ic i ty sector, Co lomb ia has advanced in expanding 
e lec t r ic i ty service, reach ing 93.6 percent o f the popu la t ion accessible by the na t iona l grid. 
F o r those o f f -g r id , la rge ly iso la ted r u r a l populations, 35 percent have e lec t r ic i ty , o n l y up 
one percentage p o i n t since 2002. In the case o f ports, the Bank has p r o v i d e d technical 
advice, under Co lomb ia ’s f i rs t fee-for-service agreement, t o rev iew the regu la to ry 
f ramewo rk f o r po r t concessions. T h i s TA he lped t o de f ine p o r t p o l i c y and h o w t o 
imp rove p o r t contracts i f the Government goes ahead with renegotiations. 

There i s ample scope f o r mo re and better investment in infrastructure. These issues 
were b rough t t o light in the Bank ’s F Y 0 4 flag-ship report, en t i t led “Co lomb ia : Recent

upg rad ing Co lomb ia ’s infrastructure base, f r o m b o t h the perspective o f social needs 
(basic water and sanitation, secondary/access roads, commun ica t ions and other services) 
and the needs for the p roduc t ive sectors (roads, ports, airports, telecommunications). 

Increased Productivity Th rough P r iva te Sector Deve lopmen t . This area o f the 2002 
C A S was b road ly in tended t o remove imped imen ts t o the p r iva te sector, addressing 
regulatory, env i ronmen ta l and administrative procedures. M I G A ’ s ac t iv i t ies are 
summarized in B o x 4. In the case o f IFC , beyond the support f o r SMEs and m i c r o - 
finance, c i ted above, I F C p rov ided f inanc ing f o r three manufacturing projects with two 
leading Co lomb ian pulp and paper p roduc t manufacturers ope ra t ing reg iona l ly . These 
companies needed long - te rm f inanc ing and 
faced challenges as 
they expanded 
domes t ica l ly and abroad. T o help with b o t h dimensions, I F C p r o v i d e d US$142 m i l l i o n 
in f inanc ing and supported strengthening competitiveness and f inanc ia l fundamentals by 
ass is t ing w i th m u l t i p l e areas in operational sustainability, such as f inanc ia l repo r t ing and 
restructuring, corporate governance, and environmental, social, hea l th and safety

imp rove corporate governance across d i f fe ren t sectors in C o l om b i a as an in teg ra l part 
o f strengthening coun t ry ’s cap i ta l ma rke t f ramewo rk . 
IFC ’s assistance t o p romo te

Under t h i s C A S period, MIGA’s support f o r Co lomb ia has evolved, re f lec t ing the country’s imp roved

Turning t o the Bank, the anticipated support f o r SMEs and m ic ro - f inance in the 2002 
C A S did n o t come to f r u i t i o n n o r did the Bank carry ou t planned ESW o n SMEs and 
know ledge management. 
Instead, the IDB took the lead o n SMEs, with the Bank 
continuing to w o r k o n the setting up a n d o r strengthening o f regu la to ry ins t i tu t ions f o r 
key areas such as telecommunications, road concessions, wa te r supply, and the powe r 
sector under the U S $ 12.5 m i l l i o n Regu la to ry R e f o rm Techn ica l Assistance loan 

95 

(approved Feb rua ry 1997 and closed August 2004). 
This operation was ra ted 
satisfactory, as con f i rmed by IEG, in inc reas ing p r iva te financing and imp rove 
management o f infrastructure, i n c l u d i n g t o l l roads, water supply, power, na tu ra l gas 
d is t r ibu t ion , and telecommunications. I t accomplished this by strengthening the relevant 
lega l and ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk f o r the d i f fe ren t sectors and by p r om o t i n g p r iva te 
pa r t ic ipa t ion . The p ro jec t was successful in concessioning m o b i l e telephone services, 
attracting U S $ 1.2 b i l l i o n , and shaping the stock i s s u e by the Bogo ta Telephone 
Company. 

N e w p r io r i t ies f o r Bank support f o r p r iva te sector development, however, emerged in 
the la t te r part o f the C A S pe r iod as competitiveness became a greater p r i o r i t y f o r the 
Government, especially as a free-trade agreement with the U S A became a d is t inc t 
poss ib i l i ty . A s a result, the Bank and the Government have engaged in a wider 
exam ina t ion o f Colombia’s a b i l i t y t o compete in te rna t iona l ly than was o r i g i n a l l y 
anticipated. First, the F Y 0 6 C E M deepened understanding o f the issues, i n c l u d i n g those 
in the agriculture sector, one o f the mos t sensitive areas in open ing markets t o 
in te rna t iona l compe t i t ion . Th is assessment was fu r the r deepened v i a other AAA products 
that analyzed the nature and extent o f the d i f fe ren t imped imen ts t o Colombia’s 
competitiveness, i n c l u d i n g labo r markets (see “Labo r M a r k e t Adjustment, Re fo rm , and 
P roduc t iv i ty ” , Novembe r 2005), log is t ics and the q u a l i t y o f Colombia’s infrastructure, 
and the f inanc ia l system. 

These s tud ies have p rov ided the ana ly t ica l unde rp inn ing f o r reach ing agreement in 
the C A S Progress Repo r t o n proceeding with a n ew series o f three proposed DPLs, 
bridging with the n e x t CAS . This series i s designed t o address constraints in the business 
environment, 
fo re ign trade and competitiveness, 
the f inanc ia l sector, q u a l i t y and 
standards, and log is t ics and infrastructure. The f i rs t such l o a n o f U S $ 250 m i l l i o n was 
approved October 2005 and closed M a y 2006. The second l o a n o f U S $ 3 0 0 m i l l i o n was 
approved in December 2006 and closed January 2007. So far, there i s l i t t l e tangible 
evidence o f the outcomes o f these operations but coun t ry trends are in the right direction. 
There have been modest improvements in Colombia’s regulation-governance ind ica to rs 
as demonstrated in the Bank’s Governance Ind ica to rs : in the case o f regu la to ry qua l i ty , 
C o l om b i a imp roved i t s percentile ranking t o 54.0 in 2005, as compared t o 50.2 in 2002. 

T o complement these broader e f fo r ts t o spur Co lomb ia ’s competitiveness, I F C i s 
assisting the Municipality o f Bogotil with im p r o v i n g and s im p l i f y i n g the system o f 
m u n i c i p a l inspections. The project, w h i c h includes a comprehensive diagnostic o f the 
inspec t ion procedures and a technical p roposa l f o r imp lemen ta t ion o f the re fo rm , aims t o 
deepen the i n i t i a l imp rovemen t that the M u n i c i p a l i t y h a d already achieved under a 
business procedures s imp l i f ica t ion p rog ram in 2004. Based o n the considerable impac t

l i v e d in extreme pove r ty as o f 1999. T h e C A S anticipated b o t h ana ly t ica l w o r k and n ew 
lending. First, t o i n f o r m the debate on wha t t o d o in the sector, the Bank devoted 
considerable resources t o ana lyz ing Colombia’s r u r a l sector, i n c l u d i n g the ques t ion o f 
land ownership: land owne rsh ip i s ex t reme ly skewed with a Gini o f 0.86 (1988). The 
Bank ca r r ied ou t several pieces o f ESW , starting with the 2002 P o l i c y No tes and 
f o l l ow e d by reports on r u r a l finance, co f fee production, ag r icu l tu ra l competitiveness, and 
land p o l i c y . As no ted above, the F Y 0 6 C E M spec i f ica l ly analyzed the effects on 
Colombia’s agriculture sector o f a Free Trade Agreement with the U S A . Second, despite 
the fact that a m u c h scaled-back l o a n was approved f o r the sector during th is C A S period, 
the B a n k continued to support innova t ive ways t o address some o f the sector’s k e y 
problems th rough on -go ing operations. 
Three examples stand out: 
the Peasant 
Enterprise Project, the on -go ing P roduc t ive Partnership Project, and the Magda lena 
Med io Peace and Deve lopmen t P ro jec t (see B o x 5). 
In addition, the Bank has supported 
advances in ag r icu l tu ra l techno logy under the comp le ted A g r i c u l t u r e Techno logy 
Deve lopmen t Project (US$46.8 m i l l i o n , approved June 1997 and closed December 2003). 
This operation was ra ted satisfactory, c i t i n g achievements in inc reas ing compe t i t ive 
funding o f research, ra is ing incomes o f 350,000 
farmers and strengthening the 
decentralized planning process. 
I t also p rov ided the base f o r the new A g r i c u l t u r a l 
T rans i t ion p ro jec t (see be low ) . 

lox 5: Pilot Peace and Rural Development Interventions 

Peasant Enterprise Zones Development Project (US$4.2 million, approved June 1998 and closed December 2003) 
T h i s LIL was designed to develop replicable methodologies for operating in Peasant Enterprise Zones in conflict 
areas and areas adjacent to protected rain forests and indigenous territories. Th ree zones were selected for the pilot, 
with assistance provided to local communities to plan and undertake small infrastructure investments, land titling, 
farming, and environmental protection, in an open, participatory fashion. T h e idea was to build local capacity and to 
demonstrate the viability o f working together. T h e project was successful in realizing its goals and the potential for 
scaling up exists. T h e approach developed under the LIL has been adopted by the Rural Development Institute, but 
has yet to receive full scale support for replication. 

Second Magdalena Medio Regional Development Project (USSS million, approved September 2001 and closed May 
2004) T h i s LIL, rated satisfactory, was also intended to test new forms o f managing and implementing t h e region’s 
development plan with the goal o f increasing citizen influence, making institutions more responsive, and 
demonstrating concrete ways to increase economic and social re tu rns . 
I t bu i l t on the f i r s t LIL, approved in June 
1998 and closed in December 2000 (also rated satisfactory), that laid the groundwork in establishing a non- 
governmental entity to lead the process. T h e idea for the second LIL was to complete the investment cycle, as 
investments planned under the first LIL did no t have enough time to materialize, leading to demand for a follow-up 
operation to test out those investments, and to reduce the dependence on the intermediary organization, the 
Corporation for Development and Peace Magdalena Medio (an NGO sponsored by the Catholic Church and 
Ecopetrol). T h e operation has been successful and mobilized funding from the EU. S i n c e its closure, the concept 
has been adopted by the Government and i s being scaled up with Bank support under the Peace and Development 
APL in six regions. 

Productive Partnerships ( U S 3 2 m i l l ion , approved FY02, ongoing) T h i s operation demonstrates the benefits o f 
pairing small-scale producer organizations with modern agro-businesses. T h e intention i s to transfer knowledge and 
generate mutual benefits that made commercial sense in a demand-driven way with limited recourse to the public 
sector. So far, the approach has been working with interim evaluations showing a gain o f 20 percent in incomes and 
employment for farmers participating in the program. T h i s result i s well above the 10 percent gain anticipated at the 
start. T h e operation has been included in the Bank’s Agricultural Investment Handbook as an example o f promising 
innovation. Importantly, the Government has adopted the concept as a main element o f i t s strategy to stimulate the 
agriculture sector. T h e total number o f hectares under the Government’s program has r isen by more than 20 percent 
since 2002, to 1.1 million hectares.

The 2002 C A S anticipated that there w o u l d b e an oppo r tun i ty t o m o v e f o rw a r d on a 
broad agenda o f i s s u e s in the r u r a l sector, related t o access t o land, land markets, forestry, 
and smallholder competitiveness. But the scope o f the o n l y new lend ing operation was 
reduced because a lack o f agreement over the v i s i o n f o r the sector, the limited f isca l 
space available f o r such an operation, and differences within C o l om b i a ove r i t s response 
to the costs o f opening domestic markets. Instead, the Bank and the Gove rnmen t agreed 
to a n a r r ow l y focused program, the recent A g r i c u l t u r a l T rans i t ion L o a n (US$30 m i l l i o n , 
approved FY05), addressing phyto-sanitary standards, techno logy and other issues 
re la t ing to Colombia’s in teg ra t ion i n t o g loba l markets and mee t ing i t s ob l iga t ions under 
the Free-Trade Agreement with the U S A . 

Env i ronmen t and N a t u r a l Resource Management. There i s considerable convergence 
between the Bank and C o l om b i a o n the important o f sound env i ronmen ta l management 
and sustainable development. 
The C A S envisaged a b r o a d based r e f o rm o f 
environmental management, supported by a series o f Sustainable Deve lopmen t DPLs. 
The f i r s t operation o f U S $ l 5 0 m i l l i o n was approved June 2005 and c losed January 2006; 
the second operation o f US $ 8 0 m i l l i o n i s pending meeting o f triggers, i n c l u d i n g the 
passage o f a new Wa te r Resources Management L aw . A compan ion Sustainable 
Deve lopmen t Investment l o a n (U S $ 7 m i l l i o n , approved October 2005), n o t anticipated 
under the o r ig ina l CAS , was added to support targeted investments (ma in ly m o n i t o r i n g 
equipment) and t o strengthen l o c a l capacities to undertake re fo rms . 

These operations address a range o f concerns-urban 
po l lu t ion , water quality, 
environmental health, 
integrated water management-and 
target mainstreaming 
environmental sus ta inab i l i ty and ach iev ing a direct impac t on meeting Colombia’s MDGs 
(notably the targets re levan t t o sustainable development and c h i l d mo r ta l i ty ) , implying 
attendant imp rovemen ts in M&E. They also build on p rev ious lending that encouraged 
the adoption o f sound env i ronmen ta l management po l ic ies and processes in m a j o r urban 
centers (see B o x 6). The programs were re in fo rced by the recen t ly comp le ted Coun t ry 
Env i ronmen ta l Assessment, entitled “M i t iga t ing Env i ronmen ta l Deg rada t ion t o Foster 
G r ow t h and Reduce Inequa l i t ies ” (February 2006), w h i c h p rov ided the ana ly t ica l basis 
and p r io r i t ies f o r the Sustainable Deve lopmen t DP L s . Again, i t i s too soon t o assess 
r e s u l t s but the start i s encouraging, especially in the dep th o f the re fo rms and the shared

A spec i f ic goa l set in the 2002 C A S was t o address the delays in the env i ronmen ta l

receive an env i ronmen ta l license f a l l i n g t o 16 days in 2005, d o w n f r o m 130 days in 2001. 
The Bank helped revise procedures f o r issu ing these licenses as pa r t o f the p repa ra t ion o f 
the Sustainable Deve lopmen t DPLs . In addition, as anticipated in the CAS , the Bank 
advanced the p o s s i b i l i t y o f reduc ing ca rbon emissions: several GEF and PCF operations 
have been approved and/or are in the p ipe l ine with the expectation that they w i l l 
demonstrate concrete ways t o reduce carbon emissions. There i s no spec i f ic evidence as 
yet. A n ew oppo r tun i ty arose to he lp Co lomb ia prepare for c l ima te change with the GEF 
grant f o r the Integrated N a t i o n a l Adap t ive Program. M o r e b road ly , the Bank and 
Co lomb ia have a strong comm i tmen t t o an ac t ive p rog ram o f GEF grants t o address

Co lomb ian peoples (see below). 

Pillar Two: Sharing the Fruits 

Ove ra l l . Econom ic growth has been the p reem inen t factor in exp la in ing the 
reductions in pove r ty and income inequa l i ty since 2002. Howeve r , c red i t also has t o be 
given t o the e f fo r ts by the Government, with Bank support, t o share the bene f i ts o f 
g r ow t h v i a increased opportunity, f inanc ia l secu r i ty f o r those fac ing med ica l problems, 
and greater p u b l i c resources directed t o those with insu f f ic ien t incomes and/or fac ing 
tempo ra ry dislocations. The impetus f o r r e f o rm i n g the social sectors has been l o n g 
standing, with fundamental re fo rms articulated in the 1991 Cons t i tu t ion . These changes 
were accompanied by extensive decentralization in tended t o im p r o v e the qua l i ty and 
quantity o f social serv ices , pa r t icu la r ly hea l th and education. Un fo r tuna te ly , these 
re fo rms we re derailed by the 1999 economic c r is is w h i c h cu t funding and exposed 
deficiencies in social programs and the social safety net. Tha t c r i s i s set the stage f o r 
developing n ew approaches t o protect the poo r and p r o v i d e a social safety ne t . 

The Bank’s support has been c r i t i c a l in helping t o shape and imp lemen t these new 
approaches unde r a series o f L a b o r and Soc ia l Sector Deve lopmen t P o l i c y loans 
(PLaRSSALs), accompanied by targeted investment programs in education and social 
p ro tec t ion t o put these new po l ic ies i n t o effect. T h e results o f this w o r k have been very 
pos i t ive . The f i rs t P L aRSSA L (US$ 150 m i l l i o n , approved September 2003 and closed 
June 2004), the second ( U S $ 200 m i l l i o n , approved Novembe r 2004 and closed M a r c h 
2005) and the third (U S $ 200 m i l l i o n , approved J u l y 2006 and c los ing M a r c h 2007) have 
con t inued and deepened the process o f r e f o rm i n i t i a t e d under the p rev ious CAS, with the 
Soc ia l Sector Adjustment L o a n (US$155 m i l l i o n , approved August 2002 and closed 
December 2002). A T A L o f U S $ 2 m i l l i o n , approved in FY05 , was added t o p rov ide 
techn ica l backup t o the l o c a l teams designing and executing these reforms. L i k e i t s 
companions in the f inanc ia l sector and the f isca l adjustment, the i n i t i a l Soc ia l Sector S A L 
was designed t o ca r ry fo rwa rd the r e f o rm agenda be tween administrations. 

The Soc ia l Sector SAL , the ensuing PLaRSSALs I and I1 and the L aR SD P L I11 
demonstrate con t inu i ty . Acco rd ing t o IEG, the S S A L and t w o comp le ted PLaRSSALs

were successh l in meeting the i r goals, with the f i rs t PLaRSSAL ra ted highly satisfactory. 
They con t r ibu ted towards im p r o v i n g transparency and c i t izen oversight v i a M&E 
measures; deve lop ing a r i s k management approach t o soc ia l protection; expanding hea l th 
insurance coverage; im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency and equ i ty o f resources devoted t o the 
education sector; and enhancing labo r ma rke t poss ib i l i t ies . The third l o a n in the series 
added c h i l d n u t r i t i o n t o t h e agenda a long with the res t ruc tu r ing o f p u b l i c hospitals. 
De ta i ls o f the accomplishments in each o f these areas are p rov ided be low . 

Education. The 2002 C A S anticipated that the f i r s t p r i o r i t y f o r C o l om b i a in the social 
sectors w o u l d b e t o meet i t s goa l o f un ive rsa l education at the p r im a r y leve l . In w o r k i n g 
towards that goal, the C A S set i n t e r im targets o f 9 0 percent f o r b o t h primary comp le t ion 
and ne t primary enrollment as o f 2006. Add i t iona l ly , supported by subsequent ana ly t ica l 
wo rk , attention was d i rec ted t o reach ing those in the 12-17 year age b racke t which, 
according t o the Bank’s F Y 0 3 report, “C los ing the Gap in Educa t ion and Techno logy ” 
(FY03), was c r i t i c a l fo r Colombia’s competitiveness. B e y o n d the expansion o f primary- 
secondary enrollment, the C A S also sought e f f ic iency and qua l i ty gains, p r om o t i o n o f 
innova t ive p i l o t s in decentralizing education management, expansion o f r u r a l education 
opportunities, and enhancing demand f o r h ighe r education by p r o v i d i n g student loans. 
M o s t o f these goals have been met and in some cases exceeded. 

Coun t ry - leve l results are impressive. Da ta show that that en ro l lmen t in p u b l i c 
p r im a r y and secondary education has increased f r o m 7.8 m i l l i o n students in 2002 t o 9.2 
m i l l i o n in 2006 (95 percent o f target). O f the new students, almost one - th i rd came from 
l ow e r income groups. Conce rn ing primary comp le t ion rates, the C A S i n t e r im goa l o f 90 
percent as o f 2006 was surpassed, with 9 4 percent reached in 2004. Preliminary data f o r 
2006 show that the goa l f o r ne t en ro l lmen t was also surpassed, with the ne t en ro l lmen t 
close t o 95 percent. 
I t i s impo r tan t t o no te that th is la t te r f igu re i s based o n the 2005 
census data. When the C A S was prepared, then available i n f o rm a t i o n h a d n e t en ro l lmen t 
f o r p r im a r y students at 87 percent as o f 1998, up f r o m 84 percent in 1992. By 2003, net 
en ro l lmen t had increased t o 88 percent. Howeve r , these data we re based o n interim 
popu la t ion estimates w h i c h were too high. As a result, earlier assessments have 
overestimated the gap in mee t ing these M D G s and i t w i l l now b e necessary t o reassess 
Co lomb ia ’s progress in reach ing the 201 5 MDGs on the basis o f the last census. 

A number o f Bank operations made impo r tan t con t r ibu t ions t o these achievements. 
The series o f PLaRSSALs focused spec i f ica l ly o n expanding access and im p r o v i n g 
qua l i ty , w i th the number o f primary and secondary students surpassing the spec i f ic 
targets se t under the PLaRSSAL , inc reas ing by 743,000 b e tw e e n 2002 and 2004. 
Mo reove r , 9 0 percent o f students-some 
9.5 million-are 
n o w subject t o standard 
p ro f ic iency tests in language, mathematics, and sciences. I t was also expected tha t 90 
percent o f 9 t h grade teachers w o u l d b e sub jec t t o performance evaluations, but the 
Cons t i tu t iona l Cou r t rejected this measure. A lm o s t 8,000 schools have prepared 
imp rovemen t plans, and 77 ou t o f 78 qua l i ty assurance centers h a d been se t up as o f 
2006. 
I t shou ld be highlighted that the cost o f expanding opportunities are la rge ly 
financed by the f isca l space generated by increasing e f f ic iency (Le,, teacher-student 
ratios) and savings redirected f r om other sectors. In addition, one o f the driving forces in 

100 

expanding en ro l lmen t was the n ew incen t ive t o l o c a l authorities t o e n r o l l students, when 
t rans fe rs from the cen t ra l Government were changed to being based o n the numbe r o f 
students, instead o f the number o f teachers. This r e f o rm was adopted unde r the SFAL- 
FIAL development p o l i c y se r ies and i s being imp lemen ted by the N a t i o n a l Planning 
O f f i c e v i a the c r i te r ia t o d is t r ibu te pe t ro leum roya l t ies t o l o c a l governments. 

In add i t ion t o suppo r t ing the sector’s p o l i c y framework, the Bank f inanced separate 
investment operations t o tes t methods to stimulate decentralized education management 
and expand education at the m u n i c i p a l level. T h e goa l was t o demonstrate h o w l o c a l 
authorities could best make use o f the k n d s transferred t o them f r o m the cen t ra l leve l .

address these concerns, the ongo ing H i g h e r Educa t ion L o a n (US$200 m i l l i o n , approved 
December 2002) helps t o finance student loans and grants and expand the number o f pos t 
graduate students. I t i s also supporting ways t o im p r o v e the q u a l i t y assurance system, se t 
up M&E t o measure progress and develop L a b o r M a r k e t Observatories to t rack labo r 
movements and emp loyab i l i ty . According t o supe rv is ion reports, t h i s operation has been 
surpassing i n i t i a l expectations. Coun t ry data, comb ined with supe rv is ion reports, show 
that en ro l lmen t in h ighe r education increased f r o m 1 m i l l i o n students in 2002 t o 1.3 
m i l l i o n in 2006 (about 85 percent o f target) and that student loans rose t o 88,000 in 2006, 
doub l ing the number o f students rece iv ing f inanc ia l support. Surpassing the i n i t i a l target, 
almost 60 percent o f beneficiaries are f r o m income strata 1 and 2, up f r o m 30 percent 
be fo re the p rog ram started. The numbe r s tudy ing at master o r doc to r l e v e l almost 
doub led t o 13,000 in 2006. Equa l ly , the e f fo r ts o n q u a l i t y assurance a re progressing,

target) f o r minimum standards o f qua l i ty . A new loan, expanding the program, gas been 
requested. 

H e a l t h i s the second anchor o f the Bank's w o r k in the soc ia l sectors, focus ing o n 
coverage o f Colombia 's hea l th insurance system, nutritional supplements f o r vulnerable 
populations, and ove rcom ing weakness in p u b l i c hea l th services. The underpinnings o f 
Colombia 's hea l th care system were established by the 1993 l a w that set up a system f o r 
p r o v i d i n g d i rec t subsidies t o those w h o c o u l d n o t a f f o r d hea l th insurance. Howeve r , the 
pace o f imp lemen ta t ion faltered f o r several reasons: decentralization became m o r e 
d i f f i c u l t as con f l ic ts increased during the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ and the resources t o p a y f o r insurance 
subsidies we re in short supply, especially after the 1999 economic crisis. But, restoration 
o f g r ow t h and easing o f the f isca l concerns enabled the reac t iva t ion o f the r e f o rm e f fo r t 
under the cu r ren t CAS . T o support this effort, the Bank f i r s t seconded a senior Bank- 
s t a f f hea l th expert to Co lomb ia f o r two years. Tha t expert engaged in day-to-day 
p r o b l em so lv ing and ass is ted the Ministry o f H e a l t h t o refocus the debate, engage a larger 
audience, and p r o v i d e the technical assessments a l l ow i n g dec is ion makers, i n c l u d i n g 
members o f Congress, t o ga in confidence in the re fo rm 's merits. F inanc ia l support for 
the re fo rms was then p rov ided under the series o f PLaRSSALs . 

These e f fo r ts are p a y i n g o f f . The p r i n c i p a l achievement has been the numbe r o f 
persons rece iv ing subsidies t o acquire hea l th insurance coverage. A c c o r d i n g t o coun t ry 
data, the number o f subsidized beneficiaries n o w amounts t o 18.6 m i l l i o n persons as o f 
2006, up f r o m about 10.7 m i l l i o n in 2002. Currently, 73 percent o f the target popu la t ion 
i s covered, as compared t o 42 percent at the s t a r t o f the C A S pe r iod . An impo r tan t 
change has been the shift t o full subsidy (instead o f partial): 5 .8 m i l l i o n beneficiaries 
n o w receive 100 percent subsidy, up f r o m only 400,000 in 2002. Acco rd ing t o an 
independent evaluation, this i s an outstanding resu l t , as very f ew l o w and m i d d l e income 
countries have achieved almost un ive rsa l coverage o f the i r hea l th insurance schemes. In 
t e rm s o f hea l th outcomes, as po in ted ou t in the independent evaluation, the f i rs t -o rde r 
r e s u l t i s im p r o v e d access t o and u t i l i z a t i o n o f hea l th services as insurance a f f i l ia tes are 
m o r e l i k e l y to u s e the hea l th care system as compared t o those w i t h o u t insurance. This 
ho lds true , f o r example, f o r ch i ld ren su f fe r ing f r o m diarrhea and resp i ra to ry in fec t ions .

Supply s ide problems, nevertheless, can have a negative impac t o n the q u a l i t y o f 
services provided and the impac t o f insurance coverage o n hea l th status. Thus, the 
con t inu ing dual-track o f re fo rms in the health sector remains impo r tan t . Accompany ing 
the expansion o f hea l th insurance are e f fo r ts supported by the PLaRSSALs t o alter the 
w a y hea l th care i s delivered. 
In 2001, a m a j o r decentralization t o o k place, putting 
hospitals and primary care under the respons ib i l i ty o f l o c a l governments. Hospitals were 
also expected t o operate independently and compete with p r iva te p rov ide rs : subsidies 
were inc reas ing ly t o b e sh i f ted t o the demand side. These re fo rms have b e e n taking 
effect, hosp i ta l by hospital, with the results pos i t ive thus far, based o n the experience o f 
7 1 ins t i tu t ions under the IDB’s p rog ram o f hosp i ta l restructuring: service leve ls have 
gone up, s ta f f ing got down, to ta l costs reduced and de f ic i ts narrowed. Nevertheless, 
there i s a l o n g w a y t o go t o e l im ina te operating de f ic i ts in p u b l i c fac i l i t ies . U n d e r the 
PLaRSSALs, some 127 hospitals, as o f 2005, were under management contracts (target 
100). M o r e than 90 percen t o f third l e v e l p u b l i c hospitals have been l icensed (target 70 
percent) as have 27 ou t o f 28 p r iva te insurers. 

The rate o f v a c c i n a t i o n s - o n e o f the MDGs in w h i c h Co lomb ia fa l ls short o f the C A S 
i n t e r im goal-has 
increased t o about 87-90 percent as o f 2005, up f r o m 82 percent in 
2002. The interim target was 92-95 percent. W o r l d H e a l t h O rgan iza t ion statistics show 
that the rate o f vaccinations in Co lomb ia f e l l during the 1996-2000 period, m o s t l y l i k e l y 
because o f security concerns and the f isca l crisis. Under the PLaRSSALs , better 
performance has b e e n hoped for as the resources h a d been su f f ic ien t t o make the target; 
however, con t inu ing con f l ic ts and fo rced displacements have made i t d i f f i c u l t t o reach 
the i n t e r im goal. T o strengthen further the incentives t o vaccinate children, 
the 
Government made an immun iza t ion ca rd a pre-requisite f o r pa r t ic ipa t ing in n u t r i t i o n a l 
programs and school enrollment. Comp lemen t ing the Bank’s PLaRSSALs , the IDB has 
been active in p r o v i d i n g resources f o r the investments f o r b o t h hosp i ta l res t ruc tu r ing and

Building o n these experiences, the Government proceeded t o deepen and re f ine i t s 
social safety ne t system with f inanc ia l support p rov ided under the series o f PLaSSRLs. 
In almost a l l areas, targets under these programs are b e i n g surpassed. The underpinnings 
o f the system were further va l ida ted in the Bank's ESW , "Colombia 's Soc ia l Safety N e t 
Assessment (FY03) and fac i l i ta ted by technical studies under a PHRD grant. A d d i t i o n a l

p i lo t programs, such as Fam i l ias en Accion, have been scaled up and institutionalized, 
and a numbe r o f new p rog rams have been introduced, pa r t icu la r ly in the area o f nu t r i t ion .

M o n i t o r i n g and targeting o f social programs have been tightened. 

Colombia’s restructure social safety ne t has expanded and im p r o v e d targeting o f 
nutritional programs. Ta rge t ing was in t roduced for ea r ly c h i l d development and 
ch i ld ren breakfast programs whose coverage has been increased f i v e fo ld t o 300,000 
families. In total, 1 m i l l i o n ch i ld ren pa r t ic ipa te in the breakfast program as o f 2006 (up 
f r om 78,000 in 2002) and 2.3 m i l l i o n ch i ld ren bene f i t f r o m schoo l lunches (up m a r g i n a l l y 
f r om 2.2 million in 2002). A n ew nu t r i t iona l p rog ram has been added f o r the elderly, 
with some 400,000 n o w served and the numbe r o f e lde r ly rece iv ing cash assistance has 
tripled since 2002, reach ing 200,000 persons, As part o f the move towards results-based 
management, M&E procedures we re in t roduced and ex-post evaluations have been 
undertaken o f the c h i l d breakfast and c omm u n i t y day care programs. 

A m a j o r part o f the e f fo r t o n Co lomb ia ’s social safety ne t has been t o ins t i tu t iona l ize 
and expand F um i l i u s en Acc ion , the successful p rog ram o f conditional grants to poor 
families. As a f o l l ow - o n operation t o the Human Capac i ty P ro tec t ion loan, the B a n k i s 
presently p rov ided support f o r the t rans i t ion o f the Fam i l ies program, under the new 
Soc ia l Safety N e t l o a n (US$86.4 m i l l i o n , approved FY06 ) . Besides expanding coverage 
f rom 320,000 t o 568,000 f am i l i e s as o f 2006 (target 400,000), the l o a n i s assisting the 
Government in concentrating resources o n the ex t reme ly p o o r in ma rg ina l areas and in 
c o n f l i c t zones and inco rpo ra t ing 100,000 displaced f am i l i e s (63,000 en ro l led as o f 2006). 
The 2005 independent evaluation o f the F am i l i e s p rog ram demonstrated i t s effectiveness 
in targeting the poor and im p r o v i n g social indicators. Some 9 1 percent o f beneficiaries 
are b e l ow the pove r ty l i n e . Consump t ion o f basic goods increased by up t o 19 percent. 
Increased in take o f p r o t e i n was noticeable in b o t h u rban and r u r a l populations. Ch ron ic 
m a l n u t r i t i o n reduced by 10 percent among ch i ld ren 0 t o 2 years. Schoo l attendance by 
secondary students increased by 14 percentage po in ts t o 89 percent in r u r a l areas and by 
9 percentage po in ts t o 94 percent in urban areas with a commensurate reduc t ion o n the 
hou rs w o r k e d by children. S t i l l , the eva lua t ion showed that there c o u l d be further 
imp rovemen ts in targeting and the design o f the S I S B EN system, the me thodo logy used 
by Co lomb ia t o i d e n t i f y beneficiaries f o r soc ia l and other targeted programs. 

L a b o r Ma rke ts . The goal in the 2002 C A S was t o h e l p make labo r markets m o r e 
f lex ib le . U n d e r the f i r s t PLaRSSAL, the Government made imp rovemen ts t o labo r 
regulations in o rde r t o make i t easier f o r ha rd - to -emp loy wo rke rs (youths, those ove r 50 
years, the disabled, and unemp loyed heads o f households) ga in access t o the labo r 
markets. L a w 789, passed in 2002, reduced the cost o f f ir ing and p a y r o l l taxes, p rov ided 
incentives f o r businesses t o emp loy mo re peop le and added a safety ne t f o r the 
unemployed. The Bank’s assessment o f those re fo rms (see above men t ioned EWS on 
labo r markets) shows that these re fo rms resulted in greater emp loymen t o f young 
workers, less i n f o rm a l i t y and h ighe r wages f o r the unskilled. At the same time, the 
PLaRSSALs supported the t rans fo rma t ion o f ex is t ing labo r t ra in ing programs, separating 
the regulatory, accreditation and service p r o v i s i o n ro les o f SENA , the N a t i o n a l T r a i n i n g 
Institute. Re fo rms further made the p r o v i s i o n o f training m o r e compe t i t ive by a l l ow i n g 
licensed p r iva te p rov ide rs and f i r m s to p rov ide their own in te rna l t ra in ing . The changes 
in the system have resulted in a dramatic increase in graduates: according t o Government 

105 

statistics, the numbe r o f graduates f r o m p ro fess iona l t ra in ing ins t i tu tes has m o r e than 
tripled to almost 3.9 m i l l i o n as o f 2006 (target was t o double). Graduates f r o m the 
Jovenes en Acc ion p rog ram (mentioned above) have increased e igh t fo ld . 

Empowe rmen t and Inc lus ion , C o l om b i a has impo r tan t popu la t ions o f indigenous and 
A f ro -Co lomb ians that tend t o been marginalized. The approach adopted under the C A S 
was t o heighten awareness among p o l i c y makers o f t h e specific hu r t les faced by these 
groups. The C A S proposed to address e thn ic i ty systematically in the Bank’s o w n AAA 
p rog ram in order t o demonstrate how and why such groups we re important, and t o 
incorporate indigenous and A f ro -Co lomb ian peoples as target popu la t ions under r u r a l 
development, b io -d ive rs i ty , and c l ima te change projects, f inanced by the GEF. The Bank 
comm i t ted i t s e l f t o have a l l ana ly t ica l w o r k inc lude b reakdown by ethnicity, undertake 
AAA o n Colombia’s indigenous peoples and A f ro -Co lomb ians and help C o l om b i a 
inc lude e thn ic i ty in the 2005 Census and househo ld su rveys . This action p l a n has by and 
la rge been accomplished. First, m a n y o f the GEF operations d o target these groups. 
Second, the Bank did ca r ry out an analysis o f the status o f ind igenous and A f r o - 
Colombians: 
this report, entitled “The Gap Matters: Pove r ty and W e l l b e i n g o f A f r o - 
Co lomb ians and Indigenous People” (July 2005) p r o v i d e d an ove rv iew o f the current 
status o f these groups and the gaps in services. Third, the n e w l y ava i lab le 2005 census 
data n o w breaks d ow n i n f o rm a t i o n o n e thn ic i ty with assistance p r o v i d e d under the 
M E C O V I p rog ram supported by an IDF grant (US$290,000, approved FY04). The 
ava i lab i l i ty o f these data has encouraged the Co lomb ians t o ca r ry ou t the i r o w n analysis 
o f three disadvantaged groups-indigenous, A f ro -Co lomb ians and R om a (the latter, n o t 
covered in the Bank’s work). But no t a l l o f the Bank ’s AAA addressed exclusion. 
Instead, the Bank has taken an alternative rou te by using the analyses unde rp inn ing soc ia l 
sector operations t o he igh ten the Government’s interest, f i rs t , in ta rge t ing the poor- 
d isp ropo r t iona te ly members o f indigenous and A f r o -C o l om b i a n groups-and 
general (see B o x 9 ) .

Bo x 9: Ma ins t ream ing Exclusion 
A good example o f mainstreaming exc lus ion i s the FY06 Soc ia l Safety N e t operation. The analysis 
back ing that operation showed that the S ISBEN system, used t o target beneficiaries, m i g h t n o t capture 
w e l l the socio-economic conditions o f indigenous and A f ro -Co lomb ian groups and that the M&E 
system in place fo r the F um i l i u s p rog ram did n o t track t h e i r par t ic ipa t ion . This led to an indigenous

Pillar Three: Building Efficient, Accountable and Transparent Governance 

Overall. The goal o f t h i s p i l l a r was t o support the Government’s e f fo r ts t o make 
governance m o r e transparent and e f f ic ien t and to stimulate accoun tab i l i ty under i t s P u b l i c 
Adm in is t ra t ion R e f o rm Program. E v e n though i t did n o t have m u c h margin f o r 
maneuver o n the expenditure side, especially after the re jec t ion o f austerity measures in 

106 

the 2003 referendum and the rulings by the courts o n va r ious measures, the Gove rnmen t 
embarked o n a r e f o rm p rog ram t o change h o w the cen t ra l agencies operate- 
consolidating m in is t r ies , c u t t i n g authorized pos i t ions in the c i v i l service, reduc ing 
bureaucratic steps, upg rad ing i n f o rm a t i o n systems, imp lemen t ing e-procurement, and 
putting in place a results-based management culture. So far, progress has been quite 
good, even though t h e r e s u l t s are uneven and the bene f i ts are m o r e ev iden t o n the q u a l i t y 
and e f f ic iency o f spending than o n reduc ing spending per se. A m o n g the quantitative 
indicators i s the d rop in wages and salaries as a share o f t o t a l spending f r o m 1 1.1 percent 
in 2002 t o 10 percent in 2006. Co lomb ia ’s re la t ive ra t ings o n the Bank’s Governance 
Ind ica to rs a l l show imp rovemen t : Co lomb ia j um p e d f r o m the 43rd pe rcen t i le to 53rd 
pe rcen t i le on government e f f ic iency and f r o m 36th t o 53‘d o n the c o n t r o l o f co r rup t ion 
between 2002 and 2005. 
I t tends t o rank higher o n government e f f ic iency , regu la to ry 
quality, and con t ro l o f co r rup t ion than other countries in i t s i n c om e category and 
countries in the L A C reg ion . Rule o f law, vo ice and accountability, and violence- 
especially the last measure-are where Co lomb ia fa l ls short. 

As discussed above, the Bank’s m a i n vehicles t o support this e f f o r t have been the 
FSAL, the FIAL series o f p o l i c y based loans and the Second P u b l i c F inanc ia l 
Management Project. Besides supporting the impressive reco rd o f imp rovemen ts t o tax 
p o l i c y and adm in is t ra t ion c i ted earlier, the last operation further he lped t o design and 
ins ta l l Co lomb ia ’s integrated f inanc ia l management system, SIIF, and performance 
m o n i t o r i n g system, SINERGIA. The n ew series o f Business Env i ronmen t and 
Competitiveness DPLs, also c i ted previously, p icks up some o f these themes, pa r t icu la r ly 
o n those areas that affect the business environment, qua l i ty and standards. B e y o n d these 
instruments, the o r ig ina l C A S iden t i f ied t w o specific areas, Jud ic ia l R e f o rm and Anti- 
corruption, f o r attention. The C A S Progress Repo r t expanded a third, M o n i t o r i n g and 
Eva lua t ion . Progress in each o f these areas i s summarized be low . 

Jud ic ia l Re fo rm . The Government’s N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan places considerable 
p r i o r i t y o n im p r o v i n g the q u a l i t y and relevance o f the country’s j u d i c i a l services. F o r 
many years, the high l e v e l s o f violence in society, the l a c k o f phys ica l presence o f the 
state in c o n f l i c t areas, and perceptions o f co r rup t ion and impunity have con t r ibu ted t o a 
l o w l e v e l o f u s e o f and trust in j u d i c i a l services by the general pub l ic . The 1991 
Cons t i tu t ion set in m o t i o n a numbe r o f changes t o the w a y that the j u d i c i a r y i s managed 
and structured. Under i t s development strategy, the Government p laced pa r t icu la r 
emphasis o n increasing access to commun i ty based, alternative dispute mechanisms, 
jus t ice f o r the poor, v i a c omm u n i t y tribunals and “houses o f justice”. These in i t ia t ives 
have b e e n support the IDB and USAID. 

The Bank oriented i t s support, v i a the Jud ic ia l C o n f l i c t Reso lu t ion Imp rovemen t LIL 
(approved FY02 and closed in June 2006, US$3.9 m i l l ion ) , t o test a comprehensive 
approach to j u d i c i a l r e f o rm in c i v i l courts. The in ten t was to devise n ew processes, 
human resource capacities, and organizational set-ups capable o f reduc ing processing 
times, increasing productivity and increasing demand f o r lega l services, starting with a 
sample o f some 80 c i v i l courts in f i v e m a j o r centers (with some labo r courts added 
subsequently). This p i l o t has m o v e d s low ly : the LIL was f i r s t t o close by June 2004 but 

107 

has been extended by t w o years. 
Imp lemen ta t ion was con founded by the in t r ins ic 
comp lex i ty o f the sector, the ambivalence o f the execu t ive b ranch in dea l ing with the 
j u d i c i a l branch, and the lack o f experience o f lead actors. Nevertheless, the experiment i s 
starting t o show some results: one o f the achievements has been the adop t ion o f 
performance eva lua t ion o f judges. Gains have also been experienced in ove ra l l 
efficiency, thanks in large part t o new case t rack ing mechanisms: the pa r t ic ipa t ing courts 
were able t o increase their reso lu t ion rate f r o m 63 percent t o 80 percent; l ow e r their 
congestion ra te f r o m 3.2 to 2.1; and increase the i r case comp le t ion rate f r o m 32 pe rcen t 
to 48 percent. W h i l e n o t u n i f o rm among the pa r t ic ipa t ing courts, average performance i s 
considerably better than that o f non -pa r t ic ipa t ing courts. Qua l i ta t ive feedback f r om users 
shows greater soc ia l leg i t imacy . Because o f the p r i o r i t y p laced o n im p r o v i n g j u d i c i a l 
services, and despite the d i f f icu l t ies so far, the Gove rnmen t i s comm i t ted t o m o v i n g t o a 
second phase o f the process with a Jud ic ia l Sector Deve lopmen t L o a n p lanned f o r FY 0 7 . 

An t i -Co r rup t ion . Since the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ 
successive governments have p laced high p r i o r i t y 
o n reduc ing co r rup t ion in Co lomb ia . In the f i r s t U r i b e p res iden t ia l term, the V i c e 
President was mandated t o spearhead the development o f the N a t i o n a l Plan Aga ins t 
Co r rup t ion . The Commission’s repo r t and ac t ion plan was presented in September 2005, 
building on, among other things, the survey o f co r rup t ion ca r r ied out with the help o f 
WB I in April 2001, the Bank’s Governance Indicators, and techn ica l input f r o m WBI t o 
the commission’s w o r k . During this period, perceptions conce rn ing co r rup t ion have 
imp roved acco rd ing t o W o r l d B a n k Governance Ind ica to rs c i ted above and Transparency 
In te rna t iona l ratings. In the case o f TI’S rating, Co lomb ia ranked 5gth ove ra l l in 2006, 
with a r a t i n g o f 3.9, up f r om 3.6 in 2002. T h i s i s better performance than many other 
countries in L a t i n Ame r ica . Nevertheless, these r a n k i n g are s t i l l low and co r rup t ion 
remains a serious concern: according t o the WEF ’s Competitiveness Repo r t (2004), 
co r rup t ion was ra ted the numbe r one obstacle in do ing business in Co lomb ia . 

B e y o n d the Bank’s techn ica l support p rov ided to the V i c e Presidential commission, 
the assistance envisaged under the 2002 C A S has fa i led t o materialize. Earlier c r i t i c i sm 
by the Bank was that the Government’s focus, t o that po in t , had been n a r r ow l y o n the 
qua l i ty o f lega l and adm in is t ra t ive controls, hand l ing complaints, and the r o l e o f con t ro l 
agencies and did n o t respond to the diagnosis revealed in the 2001 survey. Th is s t i l l 
seems t o be the case, w i th the Bank con t inu ing t o l o o k f o r a broader, m o r e 
comprehensive approach. The alternative o f w o r k i n g at the sub-national l e v e l fa i led 
w h e n central authorities w o u l d n o t agree t o p rov ide au tho r iza t ion fo r the sub-national 
government willing t o collaborate with the Bank to take o n add i t iona l debt. The s i tua t ion 
i s comp l ica ted by the lack o f clear ins t i tu t iona l home f o r any an t i -co r rup t ion in i t ia t ive . 
Nevertheless, the ongo ing discussion o n the P o l i c y No tes (FY07), plus the conclusions o f 
pertinent AAA - Ins t i tu t iona l 
Governance Review (FY07 ) and Decen t ra l iza t ion 
(FY07)-may 
rev i ta l ize the dialogue. 

M o n i t o r i n g and Evaluation. In contrast t o the slow progress in the above areas, the 
Government and the B a n k have advanced fkrther than anticipated in the 2002 C A S o n 
instilling a results-based management cu l tu re in the p u b l i c sector. A s con f i rmed in a 
recent IEG eva lua t ion o f M&E practices and po l ic ies in L a t i n America, Co lomb ia stands 

108 

ou t as a leading case. The ma ins tay o f th is e f f o r t was a dedicated component o f the on- 
go ing Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management I1 project, h e l p i n g the Government t o imp rove and 
extend Co lomb ia ’s performance management system, S INERG IA , t o a l l sector m in is t r ies 
and 170 p u b l i c entities and t o enhance m o n i t o r i n g by c i v i l society. U n d e r the N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t Plan, the Government set the goa l o f inc reas ing the share o f the investment 
budget subject to ex-post evaluations, n o w reach ing 2 4 percent as o f 2006, up f r o m 7 
percent in 2002. The B a n k has supported t h i s e f f o r t by f inanc ing i n d i v i d u a l evaluations 
in social sector operations, as a way o f building a b o d y o f M&E experience that can b e 
rep l ica ted and scaled up. The 2005 Progress Repo r t responded t o th is g r ow i n g interest by 
add ing a new M&E component t o the Governance pillar. The plan n o w i s t o proceed 
with the proposed U S $ 1Om i l l ion M o n i t o r i n g and Eva lua t ion Loan, cu r ren t ly in the 
lend ing program. This p ro jec t i s expected t o increase the l i n k s between‘ results and 
budgeting, complete the ins t i tu t iona l iza t ion o f the SINERGIA system, and upgrade the 
q u a l i t y o f i n f o rm a t i o n and data used in measu r ing performance. 

Pillar Four: Building the Foundations o f Peace 

Overall. The o r ig ina l C A S foresaw the peace process as an essential and in teg ra l pa r t 
o f the Bank’s p rog ram in Co lomb ia with actions embodied in the fou r pillars. There was 
n o separate peace p i l l a r per se. Howeve r , as the coun t ry cond i t ions changed, i t became 
apparent that the Bank cou ld have a r o l e in both dea l ing with the after-effects o f the 
peace negotiations as well as the dislocations caused the ongo ing con f l ic t . Thus, the 
2005 Progress Repo r t consolidated the various actions under separate pillars and added 
n ew ac t iv i t ies t o f o r m a new Peace pillar. As h igh l igh ted in the Progress Repo r t and in 
the Government’s assessment o f i t s N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan, this i s an area o f 
considerable 
improvement, with numerous statistics demonstrating h o w security 
cond i t ions have changed. 

The Bank’s con t r ibu t ion t o that process were ind i rec t but important, b o t h at the 
general 
level-helping 
t o restore mac ro -econom ic confidence-and 
specific-the 
p i l o t i n g o f new ways t o collaborate p e a c e h l l y and t o plan and execute c omm u n i t y 
development programs, focusing o n those mos t affected by the con f l ic ts . The fact that 
approach developed under the tw o Magda lena M e d i o projects have been adopted by the 
Government as i t s na t iona l strategy and has attracted EU f inanc ing unde r i t s Peace 
Laboratories p rog ram attests t o the impac t o f these operations. The new Peace P i l l a r i s 
tentative, subject t o ma in ta in ing imp roved secu r i ty conditions. I t focuses on scaling up 
the Peace and Deve lopmen t approach and o n learning. The f o l l ow i n g describes the m a i n 
elements o f the Peace P i l l a r as i t n o w stands: 

0 Peace and Development: The first ope ra t ion under the Peace and Deve lopmen t APL 
(US$30 million, approved FY04 ) expands the approach to co l labo ra t ive c omm u n i t y 
development p i l o t e d under the Magdalena M e d i o LILs. I t extends the approach t o six 
areas encompassing 3 m i l l i o n persons, as compared t o 800,000 unde r the L I L s . 
Within that population, i t targets vulnerable, p o o r and displaced fam i l ies and p rov ides 
support for r e s t o r i n g h u i l d i n g assets, accessing social services, and im p r o v i n g living 
cond i t ions (e.g. basic f o o d production, sanitation). So far, progress has been s low but 

109 

go ing in the right direction. 
I t i s expected that the second phase, also f o r U S 3 0 
m i l l i o n , w i l l f o l l ow in the coming CAS . Further w o r k i s also anticipated on 
understanding better the needs o f displaced popu la t ions and the impac t o f v io lence on 
vulnerable groups. 
Integrating Former Combatants: The Government’s strategy has focused o n 
encouraging pa ram i l i ta ry groups to g ive up the i r a rm s and reve r t t o c i v i l i a n 
livelihoods, with the expectation that the reduced numbe r o f combatants on one side 
w i l l increase pressure o n the gue r r i l la movemen t commensurately reduce i t s 
engagement. So far, the strategy has p roduced pos i t ive results, as described 
elsewhere, even though the s i tua t ion continues t o b e fragile. Howeve r , the in teg ra t ion 
o f former combatants in Colombia, as in other c o n f l i c t situations, presents challenges. 
The Bank’s response i s t o help the Government devise a strategy based on AAA 
d raw ing ou t the lessons o f other countries and an assessment o f wha t Co lomb ia has 
done so far. These lessons c o u l d fo rm the basis fo r W h e r engagement. The study i s 
cu r ren t ly underway. 
Rebuilding the Presence of the State: One o f the serious nega t ive effects o f the 
ongo ing c o n f l i c t has been the re t rac t ion o f the state f r o m areas o f con f l ic t . People are 
l e f t to their o w n devices. At t h i s stage, the idea i s t o s tudy h o w best t o build capacity 
o f l o c a l administrations p rev ious ly paralyzed by v io lence and soc ia l capital. At th is 
stage, n o specific a c t i v i t y i s underway. 
Forced Displacement: The 2002 C A S envisioned that the Bank w o u l d support a 
p i l o t intervention, using Japanese grant funds, t o he lp the peop le displaced by 
con f l ic ts and ca r ry ou t ESW on their conditions. M o s t o f the 2.8 m i l l i o n displaced 
are poo r (but not exc lus ive ly ) and mo re than l i k e l y t o be ind igenous o r A f r o - 
Co lomb ian descent. The Government faced a conundrum: was i t better t o support 
rese t t lemen t in n ew loca t ions o r t o w a i t until i t might be auspicious t o re tu rn home? 
Ano the r question was h o w t o protect the assets that the displaced l e f t behind. There 
was no generally accepted answer. As a result, the Bank and the Gove rnmen t decided 
on th ree s teps : f i rs t , t o concentrate o n in teg ra t ing soc ia l services ( inc lud ing those 
supported under Bank - f inanced operations in the social sectors as discussed above) 
for the displaced persons; second, p rov ide direct support unde r the Peace and 
Deve lopmen t APL; and, third, t o s t a r t a systematic process o f know ledge building. So 
far, special quotas have been set f o r displaced people t o b e inc luded in the cond i t iona l 
grant program, F am i l i a s en Acc ion , subsidized hea l th insurance and school 
enrollment. Further ana ly t ica l w o r k i s unde rway t o sort ou t the best w a y t o p rov ide 
incentives f o r these peop le t o return to the i r homes and/or t o p ro tec t their assets 
during their absence. 

Measuring Bank Performance 

Overall, the B a n k Group’s performance under the 2002 C A S i s ra ted satisfactory. 
This conc lus ion i s based on: (i) the positive coun t ry l e v e l ind ica to rs t o w h i c h the Bank 
and I F C have con t r ibu ted d i rec t ly and ind i rec t ly ; (ii) the q u a l i t y o f the outcomes o f the 
Bank’s specific products and services; and (iii) the con t inu ing progress o f on-going 
operations and investments. The strength o f the Bank Group’s con t r ibu t ion rests in the 
ove ra l l achievements in the macro-economic sphere, con t r ibu t ing t o p o v e r t y reduction, 

110 

strengthening the f inanc ia l sector, p r om o t i o n o f competitiveness and the p r iva te sector, 
delivery o f urban p u b l i c services, imp rovemen ts t o access t o soc ia l services, p lus 
increased f inanc ing and targeting o f social spending and a t ten t ion t o soc ia l p ro tec t ion . 
N o t least are the Bank’s con t r ibu t ions t o sustainable development and, ind i rec t ly , t o the 
peace process. T h e sca l ing up o f Bank - f inanced p i l o t operations and the na t iona l 
adoption o f po l ic ies and programs that have emerged f r o m the results o f Bank support are 
pa r t icu la r ly strong ind ica to rs o f the impac t o f the Bank ’s w o r k in Co lomb ia . These 
achievements are o f f set by the persistent f isca l imbalances and m isa l ignmen ts , the lack 
o f progress in reach ing Co lomb ia ’s r u r a l and extreme poor, and s low progress in 
addressing 
t h e ch ron ic p rob lems o f co r rup t ion and de f ic ien t j u d i c i a l services. 

D e l i v e w o f Services. The 2002-2006 p e r i o d has been one o f considerable expansion 
o f the Bank Group’s support f o r Co lomb ia . A variety o f instruments we re used: DPLs, 
investment loans, TALs, g ran ts , and AAA. P rog ramma t ic DPLs have cons t i tu ted the 
mainstay o f the program, with qu ick disbursing funds representing about 60 percent o f 
to ta l lend ing ove r the period. In the case o f the W o r l d Bank Institute, C o l om b i a has n o t 
been a reg iona l foca l country; i t s ac t iv i t ies have d im in ished during the C A S period, with 
the exception o f early technical support for the deliberations o f the V ice -p res iden t ia l 
Comm iss ion o n An t i -co r rup t ion . On the side o f the Bank, lending increased f r om 
average o f about US$370 m i l l i o n per year during F Y 9 7 t o F Y 0 2 ( inc lud ing a substantial 
increase in FYOO t o he lp cope with the 1999 c r is is and the earthquake) to an average o f 
US$721 m i l l i o n pe r year f rom FY03 to FY06 , peaking at U S $ 912 m i l l i o n in FY05 . 
Working within the o r i g i n a l C A S envelop o f US$3.3 b i l l i o n , the p rog ram has rema ined in 
the high case. T o t a l lend ing th rough FY 0 6 amounted t o US$2.9 b i l l i o n , keeping the 
Bank’s exposure in Co lomb ia t o about 4 percent o f to ta l Bank outstanding loans. The 
2005 C A S Progress Repo r t anticipated an add i t iona l US$1.2 b i l l i o n o f lend ing in FY07 . 
The qua l i ty o f the p o r t f o l i o i s excellent, as described below, and outcomes, as con f i rmed 
by IEG, a re la rge ly satisfactory with substantial con t r ibu t ions made to ins t i tu t ion 
building. 

Business has s im i l a r l y increased for IFC : between January 2003 and September 
2006, I F C inves ted a t o t a l o f U S $ 413 m i l l i o n f o r i t s o w n account. The investment 
comm i tmen ts in F Y 0 6 reached US $ 291 m i l l i o n , the h i g h e s t l e v e l in any g iven year f o r 
Colombia, as investment a c t i v i t y p i c k e d up due t o favorable domestic prospect and 
external conditions. 
IFC ’s to ta l comm i t ted p o r t f o l i o at the end-FY06 stood at U S $ 504 
million, the fou r th largest coun t ry exposure in L a t i n Ame r ica after B raz i l , M e x i c o and 
Argentina. The q u a l i t y o f the p o r t f o l i o i s good with no non -pe r fo rm ing loans (N P L s ) and 
loss p rov is ions during the last three f isca l years. MIGA, with o n l y one outstanding 
guarantee, similarly does n o t face any p o r t f o l i o problems. 

O u a l i t v o f Products and Serv ices . The reco rd o f Bank operations comp le ted during 
the C A S pe r iod has been good, with outcome ratings h ighe r than Co lomb ia ’s h is to r ica l 
experience and the Bank’s ove ra l l average, and in l i n e with experience in the rest o f the 
L a t i n Ame r ican R e g i o n (re f : 
IEG’s ARDE and Deve lopmen t Effectiveness Reports). 
There also appears to b e synergy and mutual reinforcement between the Bank’s lending 
operations and the AAA program. Several IEG p ro jec t evaluations have commented on 

111 

the importance o f s o l i d A4A underpinning the success o f the Bank ’s l e n d i n g operations. 
An area that warrants comment fo r the n ew C A S i s the lack o f consistency in the w a y the 
B a n k measures and mon i to rs pove r ty and other MDGs. In the case o f Co lomb ia , there i s 
n o consensus o n the mos t appropriate p o v e r t y measure and there have been 
inconsistencies and mistakes in the Bank ’s analyses. T h e Bank ’s latest pove r ty 
assessment (ongoing) reveals differences be tween the w a y that the Bank calculates the 
absolute pove r ty (US$1 and U S $ 2 per day). Different Bank documents, moreover, use 
different measures and these measures are n o t a lways consistent with coun t ry measures. 
The new C A S i s an oppo r tun i ty t o resolve these differences and t o s t a r t o n the basis o f 
popu la t ion f i g u r e s using the 2005 census. 

O f 2 4 Bank operations completed, thus far during the C A S period, o n l y fou r 
operations have been ra ted as n o t mee t ing the i r objectives: 
the C omm u n i t y W o r k s and 
Emp loymen t l o a n (unsatisfactory rating n o t yet con f i rmed by IEG), the FIAL I11 loan, 
after t w o triggers for p o l i c y agreements t o m o v e fo rwa rd with the series we re n o t met, 
and the F inanc ia l M a r k e t Deve lopmen t l o a n and the F inanc ia l Sector Ad jus tmen t loan, 
b o t h o f w h i c h had been o r i g i n a l l y ra ted as satisfactory o r mode ra te ly satisfactory, but 
since been d ow n graded t o mode ra te ly unsatisfactory by IEG in i t s project pe r fo rmance 
audits. Five operations have been ra ted by IEG as h a v i n g mode ra te ly satisfactory 
outcomes: the A n t i o q u i a Educa t ion loan, the FIAL I and I1 loans, the f i rs t p rog ramma t ic 
F inanc ia l Sector Adjustment loan, and the Structural F isca l Ad jus tmen t loan. One 
operation, the f i r s t PLaRSSAL loan, was ra ted as highly satisfactory. 
ICR s are pend ing 
fo r s ix closed operations: 
the P L sRSSA L 111, the Justice LILY the Sustainable 
Deve lopmen t I DP L , the Bus iness P roduc t iv i ty I DPL, the Cundinamarca Educa t ion 
Q u a l i t y loan, and the R u r a l Educa t ion I APL. In the case o f DPLs, there i s some lack o f 
c l a r i t y o n whether or not these operations requ i re simplified ICR s at the close o f each 
one, o r only one comprehensive evaluation at the end o f the series. Either option might 
n o t p rove adequate fo r purposes o f va l ida t ing the ove ra l l d i rec t ion and scope o f the series 
and some f o rm o f i n t e r im evaluation o r accompanying E S W might be exp lo red in the 
n e x t C A S . 

O the r measures o f performance a re equa l ly good. Bank operations are considered as 
h a v i n g made modest t o substantial o r high impac ts on ins t i tu t iona l capacity and, where 
evaluated, a l l are considered l i k e l y o r highly likely to b e sustained with the excep t ion o f 
the Santa F e Water Supp ly loan, as the f imdamen ta l ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms were not 
fo r thcom ing and the C omm u n i t y W o r k s and Emp loymen t loan. Bank performance, with 
the excep t ion o f the Commun i ty W o r k s and Emp loymen t l o a n and the FIAL I11 loan, has 
consistently been considered satisfactory. 

As o f FY07 , a l l 24 ongo ing operations as o f FY07-15 Bank loans, 8 GEF grants, 
and one policy-based guarantee (approved unde r the previous CAS)-are 
we l l . In the case o f the Bank ’s exposure, there d o n o t appear t o be any imp lemen ta t ion 
concerns, as demonstrated in Tab le 4. The p o r t f o l i o i s re la t ive ly young, with an average 
o f 3.3 years since approval. 
Indicators o f the p o r t f o l i o are positive, with a nil l e v e l o f 
p r o b l em projects, r a p i d ra tes o f disbursement, f ew inherent risks-only 
fou r p ro jec ts 
have any risk flags, m o s t l y delays in implementation-and 
compliance with f i d u c i a r y 

performing 

112 

requirements. Feedback f r om the Bank ’s procurement g roup indicates tha t there are n o 
m a j o r procurement concerns unde r Bank - f inanced projects. In t e rm s o f q u a l i t y o f entry, 
there do no t seem t o be any recurring, s ign i f ican t issues. N o r does there seem t o have 
been any adverse impacts o f Bank Group operations: in the case o f the Inspec t ion Panel 
comp la in t concerning the Cartagena Water Supply and San i ta t ion loan, as agreed with the 
Panel, s teps were taken t o fu r the r verify and strengthen the project’s design and t o take 
precautions to ensure that the needs o f a p rev ious ly un iden t i f ied affected popu la t ion were 
addressed be fo re the sewerage plant was completed. 

Imp lemen ta t ion Po l ic ies and Procedures. One o f the m a j o r changes that has occurred 
during the CAS p e r i o d i s the shift t o coun t ry systems and t o 100 percent Bank financing. 
The Bank also dropped the requirement f o r n o m o r e than 60 percent q u i c k d isbu rs ing 
f inanc ing and sh i f ted t o an upper limit o n Bank exposure in Co lomb ia to a m a x i m u m o f 4 
percent o f the Bank’s to ta l l o a n po r t fo l io . Co lomb ia was the f i r s t Bank bo r rowe r t o b e 
e l ig ib le under the 2004 n ew Expend i tu re Eligibility Po l icy . The Bank’s reluctance t o use 
special accounts, a ch ron ic comp la in t f r om the Government, has also been reversed. At 
this po in t , the use o f coun t ry systems f o r procurement i s s t i l l n o t feasible pend ing further 
r e f o rm o f the domestic procurement system t o meet Bank criteria. The reac t ion o f loca l 
authorities t o these changes has been pos i t ive and, while the evidence i s n o t conclusive, 
the upward t rend in disbursement since F Y 0 4 seems t o support the conc lus ion that these 
changes have eased imp lemen ta t ion procedures and processes. The greater f isca l space 
p rov ided fo r investments in Colombia’s budgets i s another factor fac i l i ta t ing t h e pace o f 
disbursement. 

P r om am Costs. Tab le 5 shows that the cost o f the Bank’s p rog ram in Co lomb ia , as 
compared to other large countries in the reg ion and countries w i th s im i la r l e v e l s o f 
development and p rog ram size, i s in the middle o f the road. I t ranked 5th ou t o f eight 
comparators in t e r m s o f average costs o f supervision, lending and AAA products.

Table 5: Comparative Costs o f Bank Program (FY05-06) 

Coun t ry D ia logue and Aid Coordination. Co lomb ia i s a m i d d l e income coun t ry with 
strong ins t i tu t iona l capacity in the core sectors o f i t s administration. This n o t only 
facilitates coun t ry dialogue, but means that the Bank’s ana ly t ica l con t r ibu t ion and 
know ledge sharing, v i a AAA and other instruments, tends t o find a keen audience among 
p u b l i c o f f ic ia ls . I t also means that the Bank ’s p rog ram tends t o b e demand d r iven . The 
central coo rd ina t ion and filtering functions are e f fec t ive ly ca r r ied ou t by the N a t i o n a l 
P lann ing Department and the Ministry o f Finance, with lend ing programs and b o r r ow i n g 
capacity divided among the Bank, IDB and CAF . In that context, the competitiveness o f 
the B a n k b o t h in t e rm s o f f inanc ia l costs and i t s processing t im e and c om p l e x i t y can be a 
determining factor in the demand f o r Bank G roup assistance. In addition, Co lomb ia i s 
highly comm i t ted to c i t izen pa r t ic ipa t ion and has a robus t c i v i l society, reduc ing the need 
f o r the Bank o n i t s own, t o ensure that vo ice o f the peop le are heard. Tha t said, the Bank 
s t i l l needs t o hear f o r i t s e l f concerns and perceptions o f those d i rec t ly affected by Bank 
financed operations and the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S . 

7. Lessons fo r F u t u r e Coun t r y Pa r tne rsh ip Strategies 

This eva lua t ion demonstrates the bene f i ts o f s o l i d ana ly t ica l w o r k and e f fec t ive and 
f lex ib le coun t ry collaboration. Lessons that might be use fu l f o r the preparation and 
design o f the c om i n g Coun t ry Partnership Strategy are as fo l lows : 

Exe rc is ing F i d u c i a r y Respons ib i l i t ies 

The Bank, a long with the IMF, has a f iduc ia ry respons ib i l i ty , especially o n debt 
sustainability, 
f isca l performance, the f inanc ia l sector, and m o n i t o r i n g o f p u b l i c 
expenditures, p o v e r t y and the MDGs to which the Bank shou ld rema in committed. In 
the case o f Co lomb ia , the Bank was e f fec t ive in keep ing issues o n the f ron t burner 
once the wo rs t o f the 1999 crisis was over. 

Tempe r ing Zea l w i t h Rea l ism 

New administrations tend to have ambitious plans, as was the case o f the f i r s t Uribe 
Adm in is t ra t ion ’s i n i t i a l approach t o f isca l and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms . In retrospect, i t 

114 

may no t have been rea l is t ic t o agree-in 
the ea r ly mon ths o f a n ew administration- 
to p o l i c y triggers, cove r ing ac t ion fou r years ahead. In fact, many re fo rms con f ron ted 
serious lega l and p o l i t i c a l hu r t les and have taken longe r than o r i g i n a l l y anticipated. 
On the other hand, the Bank cannot stand in the way, so th is lesson i s nuanced t o 
specific coun t ry circumstances. 

Setting Targets and C a r r y i n g ou t In te rmed ia te Eva lua t ions of P rog ramma t ic Loans 

P rog ramma t ic operations m a y pose a challenge in terms o f agreeing ex-ante t o 
triggers and measuring impacts, To the extent possible, expected outcomes shou ld b e 
established at the s ta r t . Ex-post, individual evaluations o f each loan in the series as 
they are completed might b e too short t e r m a time frame f o r impacts t o b e realized. 
Some f o r m o f m id -way , intermediate assessment and/or ESW might b e needed t o 
r e c o n f i rm the d i rec t ion and/or make m i d - t e rm corrections. 

B u i l d i n g o n What Works 

L o o k i n g b road ly at where the Bank has been e f fec t ive in Colombia, w o r k i n g in 
sectors w i th a h is to ry o f Bank invo lvemen t and with established ins t i tu t iona l 
respons ib i l i t ies and capacities seem t o w o r k best in Co lomb ia . T h i s a r g u e s f o r 
con t inu ing an evo lv ing , p rog ramma t ic approach and concentrating o n and deepening 
those areas with con t inu i ty f r o m one C A S t o another. 

B u i l d i n g Consensus and Ins t i tu t iona l Homes fo r New In i t ia t ives 

0 The lack o f progress in areas such as an t i -co r rup t ion and j u d i c i a l r e f o rm ca l ls f o r 
re th ink ing the Bank’s approach t o new in i t ia t ives . The ana ly t ica l g round f o r an 
i n i t i a t i v e needs t o be solidly and conv inc ing ly established and the ins t i tu t iona l base 
established ex-ante. For the new CAS, the lesson might b e p r i o r ESW and consensus 
building plus con t inu ing investment t o in fo rm p o l i c y makers and the p u b l i c during 
imp lemen ta t ion o f p i l o t operations so that the g r ow i n g evidence o f wha t w o r k s can be 
shared with a larger audience. 

Refocusing on the R u r a l Sector: C los ing the Gaps 

0 A new approach t o the r u r a l sector, with attendant attention t o Co lomb ia ’s ex t reme ly 
p o o r and marginalized, m a y b e timely, as the security p ic tu re improves. 
I t was a 
p r i o r i t y in the 2002 C A S but l i t t l e ma te r ia l ized in terms o f spec i f ic lending. 
Nevertheless, the Bank unde r took ample analysis o f the sector: the p o l i c y notes f o r 
the C A S and other ana ly t ica l w o r k have p r o v i d e d evidence that the r u r a l sector was 
important, dynamic, and disadvantaged. 
Importantly, the Bank has supported a 
number o f successh l p i l o t ru ra l development and peace in i t ia t ives w h i c h could b e 
scaled up. L o o k i n g ahead, i t m a y be helpful t o segment strategies across r u r a l and 
urban sub-groups as was done in education. O the r sectors amenable to th is approach 
a re housing, water and sanitation-typified 
by the L a Gua j i ra P ro jec t n o w under 
preparation-and 
transport.

Relying on L o c a l Capac i ty 

Colombia, as a Middle Income Country, 
i s capable o f assuming the lead in 
developing and implementing the C A S in ways that other countries might no t . This i s 
pa r t icu la r ly the case in pa r t ic ipa t ion . The Bank can ‘piggy-back‘’ o n those e f fo r ts 
rather than do o w n pa ra l le l exercise. Moreover, the case o f C o l om b i a demonstrates 
that M I C s with solid ins t i tu t iona l capacity can be entrusted to use coun t ry based 
systems. 

Re ta in ing F lex ib i l i ty 

Ano the r ha l lma rk o f w o r k i n g with a Middle Income Coun t ry i s f l e x i b i l i t y . The Bank 
has been flexible i s respond ing t o Co lomb ia ’s changing economic and social 
cond i t ions especially as the coun t ry ’s cond i t ions im p r o v e d beyond wha t was expected 
and when some aspects o f the o r i g i n a l C A S were n o t feasible and/or did not en joy 
full ownership. The C A S Progress Repo r t i s an example o f h o w t o accommodate 
M I C needs and conditions. This i s an attribute w h i c h shou ld be ca r r ied over t o the 
nex t CAS . 

Synchronizing T im i n g and M o n i t o r i n g of Development P l a n n i n g Instruments 

The 2002 C A S was prepared at a c r i t ica l momen t in Colombia, compounded by 
transitions at senior levels in both the Bank and the Government. The bene f i t o f 
preparing the C A S q u i c k l y was i t s t im e l y assistance to the country. But the cost was 
a lack o f in te rna l iza t ion and re in fo rcemen t among the key development strategy 
instruments that the coun t ry employs, no tab ly the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Plan, and a 
lack o f common m o n i t o r i n g definitions, 
too ls and benchmarks. 
Adm i t ted ly , 
development i s an evo lv ing process and new needs can b e address ove r time. The 
new C A S i s the oppo r tun i ty t o a v o i d the gaps in timing and t o focus o n results. 

In te rna l iz ing Equ i ty and Meaningfiully Measu r ing Poverty 

The Bank ’s e f fo r ts at in te rna l iz ing equity considerations i n t o i t s operations and 
ana ly t ica l wo rk , while tak ing a different track, seem to have energized B a n k s t a f f and 
l o c a l authorities t o t a k e up the concerns o f the ex t reme ly p o o r and ma rg ina l ized as 
part o f a g r ow i n g M&E culture. T h i s momen tum can b e elevated to the n e x t stage by 
generalizing analysis o f equity, n o t just in social sector and GEF operations, but in
