EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

o 

The W o r l d Bank Group’s FY09-12 Coun t ry Strategy f o r I n d i a p rov ides a f ramewo rk t o deal 
with the challenges o f ach iev ing rapid, inc lus ive growth, ensuring sustainable development, 
and im p r o v i n g service delivery, with a cross-cutting focus o n im p r o v i n g the effectiveness o f 
p u b l i c spending and ach iev ing mon i to rab le r e s u l t s , a l l o f w h i c h w i l l help scale up the impac t 
o f W o r l d Bank G roup (WBG) assistance. The elements o f the strategy are organized around 
these three challenges: 
A c h i e v i n g rapid, inc lus ive g row th : T o assist the government achieve rapid, inc lus ive 
growth, the WBG w i l l support ac t iv i t ies a imed at addressing b o t h c y c l i c a l and 
structural impediments t o g r ow t h and constraints t o making g r ow t h m o r e inc lus ive . 
Th is includes dialogue, AAA, investments, and IFC ac t iv i t ies to : 
o support macroeconomic, fiscal, and f inanc ia l po l ic ies conducive t o inc lus ive 
g r ow t h and s tab i l i ty at the central and state l e v e l ( inc lud ing in the aftermath 
o f the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis); 
o h e l p remove infrastructure and sk i l ls constraints t o g r ow t h in b o t h urban and 
r u r a l areas, i n c l u d i n g th rough fos te r ing p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion ; 
im p r o v e ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty , r u r a l connec t iv i ty , and r u r a l l ive l ihoods in 
states and regions supported by WB operations. 
Ensuring development i s sustainable: T o help ensure that development i s sustainable, 
the WBG w i l l help I n d i a t o better manage i t s na tu ra l resources (pa r t icu la r ly water) 
and reduce the bu rden that env i ronmen ta l degradation imposes o n the popu la t ion 
(pa r t icu la r ly vulnerable groups). The WBG’s assistance w i l l also help t o increase the 
resilience o f people and the economy t o nature-related and man-made shocks, in l i n e 
with the p r io r i t ies identified in the N a t i o n a l A c t i o n P l a n o n C l ima te Change as w e l l 
as in support o f India’s comprehensive e f fo r ts t o reduce the country’s vu lne rab i l i ty 
t o cyclones, earthquakes and other na tu ra l perils. 
Increasing 
the effectiveness o f service delivery. 
The WBG w i l l support 
improvements in the organization and de l ive ry o f pub l ic ly - f inanced services that 
w o u l d enhance the development effectiveness o f p u b l i c spending, pa r t icu la r ly in 
education, health, soc ia l p ro tec t ion (w h i c h w o u l d acquire pa r t icu la r importance 
should a p e r i o d o f s lowe r g r ow t h resu l t f r om the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis), urban 
development, and wa te r supply and sanitation. 
The emphasis w i l l be o n 
imp lemen ta t ion procedures and ins t i tu t iona l arrangements that focus on: i) getting 
r e s u l t s ( inc lud ing demand-side accoun tab i l i ty th rough beneficiary, c i v i l society and 
commun i ty invo lvemen t ) : ii) strengthening capacity f o r pub l ic ly -p rov ided services; 
and iii) enhancing p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion . This imp l ies w o r k i n g primarily o n 
systems and the “how” o f good service de l ive ry . 
IFC ’s FY09-11 strategy, centering o n im p r o v i n g inclusion, manag ing the impac t o f c l ima te 
change, and p r om o t i n g reg iona l integration, i s an in teg ra l part o f th is ove ra l l WBG strategy.

India 's size and d ive rs i ty c a l l f o r a d i f fe ren t ia ted approach wherein the l e v e l o f engagement, 
instruments, and objectives take i n t o account the stages o f development, capacity, and needs 
o f states and the center, as w e l l as the i r constitutionally-mandated ro les and responsibilities. 
In l ow - i n c om e states and lagg ing reg ions o f mo re advanced states, the WBG's focus w i l l b e 
o n pove r ty reduc t ion and helping t o achieve the MDG s , relying p r im a r i l y o n IDA resources, 
non - lend ing TA , and IFC's adv iso ry services. In m o r e advanced states and at the cen t ra l 
level, the focus w i l l b e r em o v i n g constraints t o sustaining high g r ow t h and o n helping t o 
strengthen ins t i tu t ions so they can deal with emerging m idd le - income challenges, r e l y i n g o n 
IBRD lending, cutting-edge ana ly t ica l w o r k and IFC ac t iv i t ies f o r p r iva te sector clients. 

Se lec t iv i ty poses a pa r t icu la r challenge given Ind ia 's size and d ive rs i ty and yet remains an 
c ruc ia l goa l i f the WB i s make the mos t o f i t s l im i t e d resources. The CAS acknowledges 
that p rev ious strategies have la rge ly fa i led t o make su f f ic ien t headway towa rd this goal. At 
the sector level, IDA resources are targeted t o MDG - re la ted sectors: education, health, social 
protection, water supp ly and sanitation, r u r a l connec t iv i ty . IBRD lend ing has b e e n and w i l l 
continue t o b e demand-driven. The CAS proposes that se lec t iv i ty in IBRD lending therefore 
b e achieved th rough a m o r e r igo rous p ro jec t selection process, t o b e imp lemen ted j o i n t l y 
with the government. The k e y factors guiding th is process w i l l be strengthening ins t i tu t ions 
f o r a m idd le - income Ind ia . Specific p ro jec t c r i te r ia w i l l inc lude the strength o f measures t o 
ensure effectiveness o f p ro jec t expenditures and an assessment o f exposure and r isks 
associated with the sectorhtate po r t fo l io . 

The vo lume o f WE3 lending t o I n d i a w i l l continue t o be de f ined by the f ramewo rk f o l l ow e d 
under the 2004 CAS. B a r r i n g any dramatic unforeseen de te r io ra t ion in performance, i t i s 
expected that, based o n the to ta l amount o f the IDA15 replenishment, IDA w i l l p r o v i d e SDR 
2,937 m i l l i o n (US$4,405 m i l l i o n equivalent at the current exchange rate) ove r FY09-11. 
The ava i lab i l i ty o f IDA past FY11 w i l l depend o n Ind ia 's g r ow t h performance as w e l l as 
decisions t o b e taken in the IDA 1 6 replenishment. Under current IDA graduation policies, i f 
a country 's GNI per capita exceeds the IDA operational c u t o f f f o r at least t w o years in a row , 
a case-by-case de te rm ina t ion i s made by IDA management. Ind ia 's pe r capita GNI, at $950 
in FY09, c o u l d po ten t ia l ly exceed the IDA c u t o f f o f $1,095 in FY 10 o r FY 1 1 , a l though this 
prospect appears less l i k e l y i f g r ow t h fa l ls b e l ow 7-7.5% as a resu l t o f the current g loba l 
crisis. IBRD lending w i l l b e subject t o the Single B o r r ow e r Limit, w h i c h at the momen t i s 
debt outstanding o f US$15.5 b i l l i o n . This w i l l support a p rog ram with an upper b o u n d o f an 
average US$2.9 b i l l i o n o f comm i tmen ts a year in th is CAS period, p r o v i d e d qu ick - 
disbursing lend ing i s l im i t e d t o less than 10% o f the total. Within the ceiling, actual IBRD 
investment lend ing w i l l b e d r iven by the W B ' s capac i ty t o implement the ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o 
comb ined with the need t o respond in the short te rm t o the f inanc ia l crisis. 
I n d i a i s IFC 's 
second-largest coun t ry exposure in terms o f disbursed and outstanding p o r t f o l i o with 
investments (as o f October 31, 2008) in over 112 companies to ta l ing $1.6 b i l l i o n f o r IFC 's 
own account and $606 m i l l i o n f o r the account o f participants. 
IFC made i t s largest 
comm i tmen ts o f $1.05 b i l l i o n in I n d i a in FY07 and again in FY08 and expects t o m a i n t a i n a 
s ign i f ican t investment and adv iso ry p rog ram while rema in ing within Coun t ry Exposu re 
L im i t s .

In l i n e with the approach t o se lec t iv i ty discussed above and the W B ’ s goa l t o become a 
stronger know ledge partner, the AAA p rog ram unde r the CAS w i l l focus o n a l im i t e d 
number o f multi-year, cross-sectoral ana ly t ica l 
themes cove r ing 
impo r tan t 
issues 
con f ron t ing po l icymake rs (such as p o v e r t y and exclusion, sk i l ls and j o b creation, l o w - 
carbon growth, the challenges o f r a p i d urbanization, the management and development o f 
water resources) complemented by on-demand p o l i c y and imp lemen ta t ion advice (such as 
o n land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, o r social secu r i ty f o r the unorganized 
sector), and by due-diligence rev iews (such as w o r k o n strengthening procurement in the 
hea l th sector). 

The W strategy faces r i s k s l i n k e d t o the impac t o n India’s economy o f the g loba l economic 
s lowdown and t o a lesser extent p o l i t i c a l developments. W h i l e I n d i a m a y have been 
re la t ive ly insulated f r om g loba l trends until recently, thanks t o the size o f i t s in te rna l ma rke t 
and i t s high savings ratio, th is “de-coupling” 
f r o m trends in developed economies has 
reached i t s limits given the depth o f the e v o l v i n g g loba l crisis. The risk o f a m a j o r domestic 
c r is is in I n d i a i s n o t substantial, but t h e imp l ica t ions o f the p robab le s l ow d ow n in India’s 
g r ow t h w i l l need t o be mon i to red closely. In the event o f a p ro longed g loba l recession, r i s k s 
w i l l escalate and the strategy w i l l need t o be reassessed. O n the p o l i t i c a l side, na t iona l 
elections are due by M a y 2009 but, whatever t h e outcome o f the elections, the Eleventh 
Plan’s m a i n p o l i c y d i rec t ions and the government’s expectations f o r WBG support t o the 
Plan a re u n l i k e l y t o change. 

In terms o f imp lemen ta t ion o f the W B ’ s program, at the l e v e l o f outcomes, r isks a re related 
t o ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses in de l ive r ing programs, unclear policies, and inadequate attention 
t o results, r i s k s w h i c h are l i k e l y t o b e h ighe r in low - income states. So an increase in the 
share o f the p o r t f o l i o go ing t o low - income states i s likely t o raise the ove ra l l risk p r o f i l e 
(while at the same time o f f e r i n g the p o s s i b i l i t y o f h ighe r returns in terms o f progress in 
pove r ty reduction). The r i s k that imp lemen t ing agencies w i l l n o t focus su f f ic ien t ly o n results 
can b e m i t iga ted by w o r k i n g o n m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation f ramewo rks in close partnership 
with government counterparts and by inves t ing in capacity building, as well as w o r k i n g with 
beneficiaries and c i v i l society t o strengthen demand f o r accountability. 

M i s u s e o f p u b l i c resources, i n c l u d i n g those p rov ided by the WB, affects the p r o b a b i l i t y that 
the necessary inputs w i l l be available f o r project/program imp lemen ta t ion and that outputs 
w i l l actually b e delivered; howeve r pu rsu ing a strategy o f r ing - fenc ing a l l WB operations 
c o u l d lead t o irrelevance. F o r in te rven t ions that can make a s ign i f ican t impac t in India, the 
so lu t ion must l i e in stronger coun t ry sys tems . Strengthening coun t ry systems requ i res 
w o r k i n g in close partnership with government counterparts as well as strengthening citizens’ 
capacity t o demand transparency and accountability. Th is takes t im e and comm i t ted 
counterparts, and in the meantime there w i l l be imp lemen ta t ion risks. The W B ’ s response 
w i l l be swift and tho rough when f i d u c i a r y r isks do materialize. 

F ina l ly , the re i s a risk that p ro jec t p repa ra t ion and supervision costs w i l l turn ou t to be 
s ign i f ican t ly higher than in the past, because o f add i t iona l time and resources needed t o 
ensure b road agreement o n governance measures. Th is risk i s substantial and can o n l y 
p a r t l y b e m i t iga ted in the short t e rm by r e l y i n g o n add i t iona l resources. Ove r time,

The Government's Vision. The Government o f Ind ia 's (GoI) recen t ly l a i d ou t i t s

l i fe of 

"The central vision of 
the Eleventh P lan is to bu i ld on our strengths to trigger a 
development process which ensures broad based improvement in the quality of 
the people, especially the poo r , Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, 
Other Backward Classes, minorities and women. This broad vision of 
the 
Eleventh P lan includes several interrelated components: rap id g row th that 
reduces poverty and creates employment opportunities, access to essential 
services in health and education especially for the poo r , equality of opportunity, 
empowerment 
through education and s k i l l development, employment 
opportunities underpinned by the Na t iona l Ru ra l Employment Guarantee, 
environmental sustainability, 
recognition of women 's agency and good 
governance." 

The challenges o f inclusive, sustainable g r ow t h and service de l ive ry are at the center o f the 
government's p r io r i t ies . Ac t ion , w h i c h i s less o n p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion and the passage o f laws 
and mo re on imp lemen ta t ion and enforcement, l i e s as m u c h with the U n i o n as with the state 
governments. 

A. Sustaining high growth and making i t inclusive 
5. 
Ind ia 's GDP grew at mo re than 9% pe r annum over the past fou r years with high 
rates o f inves tmen t and savings and strong expo r t growth, and r a p i d g r ow t h generated 
substantial public and p r iva te resources f o r investment and development programs. But 
I n d i a has made less progress than other countries in reduc ing pove r ty and resentment about 
the unequal distribution o f the benefits o f g r ow t h contributes to social con f l ic t . Mo reove r , 
structural factors and n o w t h e s lowdown and v o l a t i l i t y o f the g loba l economy constrain 
f u t u r e growth. The Eleventh P l a n establishes 9% as the target f o r GDP g r ow t h f o r 2007- 

2012 (see box 1) and states that " the target is not j u s t faster growth but also inclusive 
growth, i.e. a g row th process which yields broad based benefits and ensures equality of 
opportunity for a l l " .

E x c l u s i o n has geographic and social dimensions. O f the 300 m i l l i o n people who 
lived b e l ow the o f f i c i a l poverty l i n e in 2005, nearly 60% we re in the seven so-called 
"lagging" (or low - income ) states-Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, M a d h y a Pradesh, Orissa, 
Rajasthan, and U t t a r Pradesh. The richest states in Ind ia already have incomes that are f i v e 
t imes h ighe r than those o f the poorest states-a 
gap higher than in mos t other democratic 
societies. R u r a l areas are o n average poorer than urban areas, and the le f t is t N a x a l i t e 
movemen t has been g r ow i n g in some o f the ma rg ina l r u r a l areas.4

Ind ians f r o m "scheduled" castes and tribes, women, and peop le with d isab i l i t ies are 
overrepresented among the poor.5 Scheduled tribe-dominated d is t r ic ts are among the wo rs t -

Scheduled castes are h is to r ica l ly ma rg ina l ized . Gender inequa l i t ies a re endemic despite 
considerable progress in outcomes f o r w om e n and girls. In many states, the r a t i o o f females

f o r instance in

a c ruc ia l and unavoidable challenge. 

Structural constraints t o sustainable g r ow t h 

9 . 
On the structural side, 
the three m a i n constraints 
t o con t inued g r ow t h are 
infrastructure and sk i l ls shortages, b o t h exacerbated by the fast g r ow t h o f recent years, and 
s low ag r icu l tu ra l g row th . On the in f ras t ruc tu re side, inadequate p ow e r supp ly remains a 
c r i t ica l constraint t o Ind ia 's sustained growth; ove r the last five years, w h i l e GDP g r ow t h 
averaged about 8% p e r year, g r ow t h in e lec t r ic i ty gene ra t iodsupp ly averaged o n l y 4.9% p e r 
year. The na t iona l and state h i g hw a y ne two rks have fa i led t o keep pace with the 
tremendous g r ow t h in demand f o r r o a d transport: only about 30% o f state h ighways are tw o - 
lane, mo re than 50% are in p o o r condition, and the average t rave l speed i s about 30-40 
km/h. U r b a n infrastructure i s a severe constraint t o the expansion o f key g r ow t h centers. 
I n d i a needs t o continue addressing i t s infrastructure gaps with major investments in power, 
transport, water, and urban development, while at the same t im e con ta in ing the f isca l de f ic i t . 
The E leven th P lan foresees a m a j o r role f o r the p r iva te sector th rough PPPs, but these m a y 
n o t ma te r ia l ize t o the extent hoped f o r in the aftermath o f the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis and

fac i l i ta ted by ve ry good monsoons, greater p roduc t ion o f h igh -va lue ag r icu l tu ra l products 
(fruits, vegetables, and da i ry products), an increase in the minimum support p r i c e f o r grains, 
and the sudden increase in g loba l p r ices f o r ag r icu l tu ra l products. But sustaining this l e v e l o f

governance issues, as w e l l as tiny landholdings and years o f underinvestment. Weaknesses 
in basic r u r a l infrastructure-from 
roads t o electrification-have 
constrained the g r ow t h o f 
o f f - f a rm activities. With 60% o f the popu la t ion depending o n agriculture, faster ag r icu l tu ra l

Recent external shocks and g r ow t h 

13. 

In add i t ion t o structural constraints, recent g loba l shocks are h a v i n g an impac t o n 
India’s g r ow t h prospects. The r ise in o i l prices, and t o a lesser extent in f o o d and other 
commod i ty p r ices in the f i r s t part o f 2008, hit I n d i a hard. I n d i a re l ies o n o i l impo r ts f o r over 
70% o f consumption. A s a resu l t o f the sharp h i k e in prices in the course o f FY08, the 
im p o r t b i l l f o r o i l j um p e d from about $41 b i l l i o n in the p rev ious f isca l year (FY07) t o about 
$77 b i l l ion , a r i s e equivalent t o about 3% o f GDP. On other commodities, I n d i a i s n o t 
nearly as dependent o n impo r ts : i t i s a n e t exporter o f foodgrains and a large impo r te r o f 
fertilizers, metals and other commodities, with gains in one o f fse t t ing some o f the losses in 
the other. 

14. 

Impac t of c omm o d i t y p r i c e shocks. The impac t o f h ighe r commod i ty p r ices was fe l t 
primarily th rough three m a i n channels: the current account, f isca l balances and in f la t ion . 
Thus far, the current account impac t has been modest. W h i l e the recent decline in o i l and 
other commod i ty p r ices w i l l help t o moderate pressures, the current account de f ic i t i s 
expected t o widen f r o m about 1.4% o f GDP in FY 0 8 t o about 2.7% o f GDP in FY 0 9 (down 
f r om e a r l i e r estimates o f 3.6% o f GDP) and then g radua l ly dec l ine ove r the next few years. 
The impac t o f h ighe r c omm o d i t y p r ices o n f isca l balances has, o n the other hand, been 

5 

substantial. M u c h o f the r ise was cushioned by the Government by escalating o f f -budge t 
subs id ies . As a result, the consolidated f isca l de f ic i t o f the general government i s estimated 
to have increased sharply f r om 7% o f GDP in FY08 to about 8.5% o f GDP in FY09.6 W h i l e 
the incomp le te pass-through o f p r i c e increases p ro tec ted producers and consumers t o some 
extent, i t did n o t fully insulate them f r o m rising energy and r a w ma te r ia l costs, and the 
average WPI i n f l a t i o n rate jumped sharply f r o m a h is to r ica l l e v e l o f about 5% annua l ly to a 
peak o f about 12.6% in Augus t 2008. 

15. 
The Go1 and the Rese rve Bank o f I n d i a (RBI) responded p r om p t l y t o rising 
c omm o d i t y prices. W h i l e n o t fully passing o n the p r ice increases, w h i c h was considered 
p o l i t i c a l l y too risky with approaching state and na t iona l elections, the Government did make 
some sma l l adjustments t o domestic o i l prices. The RBI repeatedly ra ised in te res t ra tes in 
sma l l increments, simultaneously t igh ten ing the cash reserve ra t io requirements (CRRs), 
thus signaling the in ten t to reduce rapid monetary and c red i t expansion, w h i c h h a d earlier 
been r i s i n g because o f massive i n f l ow s o f cap i ta l f r o m the rest o f the world. In a tight 
ba lanc ing act, interest rates and higher CRRs targeted in f la t ion , while greater flexibility in 
exchange ra te po l ic ies and the re la t ive degree o f tightness o f cap i ta l controls we re used t o 
manage cap i ta l f lows . So, when the f inanc ia l c r is is hit, I n d i a found i t s e l f in a pos i t ion o f 
comparative weakness, with a sizeable and g r ow i n g current account de f ic i t and a la rge f isca l 
de f ic i t , a tight mone ta ry p o l i c y in p lace t o con t ro l i n f l a t i o n and very l im i t e d f isca l space (but 
at least with com fo r tab le reserves). 

16. 
Impac t ofthe g l o b a l j h a n c i a l c r is is . The g loba l f inanc ia l c r is is i s h a v i n g an impac t 
o n I n d i a primarily th rough th ree channels: trade, cap i ta l outflows, and investment. On trade, 
exports, w h i c h h a d been g r ow i n g in rea l t e rm s at an average o f around 15% ove r the last few 
years, are l i k e l y t o weaken. Sectors that are already fac ing a sharp s l ow d ow n inc lude 
t rad i t iona l ly buoyan t sectors such as cu t diamonds, textiles and garments, and bus iness 
process outsourcing. E x p o r t g r ow t h in n om i n a l U S $ s lowed t o 10% in September 2008 o n 
an annualized basis compared t o 35% ove r the p rev ious five months. Consequently, exports' 
con t r ibu t ion t o GDP g r ow t h i s l i k e l y t o d rop sharply. 

17. 
Add i t iona l ly , I n d i a i s n o w fac ing a tightening o f c red i t markets. 
Ind ia 's f inanc ia l 
system, w h i c h i s largely state-owned, i s re la t ive ly well-capitalized, regulated, and well-run, 
with l i t t l e o r n o d i rec t external exposure. Stress tests suggest that banks are in a strong 
pos i t ion t o handle the shocks. Moreover, I n d i a does n o t face p rob lems with p r iva te external 
debt and cu r rency mismatches o n the balance sheets o f corporates, comme rc ia l banks, and 
households to the extent o f other emerging countries. But c red i t markets are t igh ten ing up 
because o f cap i ta l ou t f lows . Much o f the massive n e t cap i ta l i n f l ow s reco rded in FY08 
($108 b i l l i o n ) was re f lec ted in increasing reserves, but ind i rec t ly i t encouraged faster 
domestic g r ow t h because o f the exchange ra te appreciation, w h i c h lowe red the cost o f

The RBI again acted p romp t ly , accommodating a depreciation o f the rupee t o 
increase expo r t competitiveness and using i t s la rge reserves (about US$253 b i l l o n as o f Oct. 
31, 2008, d ow n f r o m a peak o f US$316 b i l l i o n in M a y 2008) t o supp ly adequate fo re ign 
exchange t o the markets. Reserves are s t i l l ve ry com fo r tab le at ove r 8 mon ths o f impo r ts 
and well over three times short-term debt ~ o v e r a g e . ~ Further, the I n d i a n economy does n o t 
face the same degree o f r i s k s f r om high p r iva te external debt and cu r rency mismatches o n 
the balance sheets o f corporations, comme rc ia l banks, and households that have led t o 
serious vu lne rab i l i ty in other eme rg ing markets. Nevertheless, under pressure f r o m large 
ou t f lows and a widening trade and current account deficits, the rupee depreciated by about 
25% between April and October 2008. W h i l e mone ta ry t igh ten ing was an e f fec t ive t o o l t o 
con t ro l i n f l a t i o n (w h i c h was and remains a k e y objective), the sudden pressure o n domestic 
liquidity, massive declines in equity markets, and concerns about a possible g r ow t h 
s lowdown have since led the RBI t o concentrate o n p ro tec t ing the liquidity and safety o f the 
banking system, similar t o wha t other cen t ra l banks have done. 
I t has therefore in jec ted 
large add i t iona l liquidity (estimated at US $ 5 0 b i l l i o n as o f N o v . 5, 2008) i n t o domestic 
markets t o fence o f f a f reez ing o f inter-bank c red i t markets

Economic expansion in I n d i a has been accompanied by rising demands o n already

Env i ronmen ta l problems, pa r t icu la r ly urban and i n d o o r a i r po l lu t ion , indus t r ia l and 
tox ic contaminants, and lack o f water supply, san i ta t ion and hyg iene are associated with 
increased m o r b i d i t y and m o r t a l i t y and reduced p roduc t iv i ty . Vu lne rab le groups tend t o be

are also associated with ch ron ic ma lnu t r i t ion , w h i c h m a y limit children’s cogn i t ive

vulnerable groups can lead hea l thy l ives and have greater chances o f escaping pove r ty . 

23. 
Sound env i ronmen ta l management and sustainable use o f na tu ra l resources have the

India’s 
competitiveness. Comp l iance with env i ronmen ta l 
requirements i s inc reas ing ly becom ing a cond i t ion t o compete in g loba l  market^.^ Increased 
e f f ic iency in the use o f energy, water and other inputs can strengthen indus t r ia l 
competitiveness w h i l e also im p r o v i n g l o c a l env i ronmen ta l conditions. Moreover, Ind ia ’s 
unique endowment o f na tu ra l resources cou ld be used as a source o f compe t i t ive advantage

In addition, increasing average and extreme temperatures w i l l have po ten t ia l ly s ign i f ican t

H O W I S THE WORLD BANK GROUP BEING ASKED TO HELP? 

29 . 

Different Views on the World Bank Group's Role.12 Ove r the last year, WBG s ta f f 
have h e l d extensive consultations b o t h in te rna l ly and with partners. Ex te rna l consultations 
have inc luded interactions with the government at various levels, with development partners,

and forge the ins t i tu t ions needed t o help I n d i a t rans i t ion i n t o a m idd le - income coun t ry . 
During consultations, the Finance Ministry requested the WBG t o p lace a special emphasis

The WBG has been engaged with I n d i a f o r nea r ly 60 years, and i t s presence in many

place t o the extent foreseen, and results a re o n l y beg inn ing t o show. The current 
C A S rea f f i rms the importance o f this engagement, devotes m o r e resources t o

The W B ’ s engagement with b o t h the central and state governments o n these

Addressing the challenges o f better M&E in the W B ' s p rog ram and, mo re 
impo r tan t ly , in India, w i l l requ i re a comprehensive approach. First, the WB w i l l make i t a 
priority t o help build demand f o r M&E b o t h in government and in c i v i l society by using 

2 0 

“monitoring” t o foster p u b l i c debate and using “evaluation” t o i n f o r m p o l i c y . Second, while 
demand f o r M&E i s necessary, i t i s ce r ta in ly n o t su f f ic ien t . Weak capacities can constitute a 
serious constraint t o the development o f stronger M&E systems. Howeve r , the WB must b e 
conscious o f i t s own l im i ta t ions in seeking t o build capacity f o r M&E in a coun t ry as la rge 
and sophisticated as Ind ia . Trying t o do too m u c h m a y lead t o n o t d o i n g enough. WB 
efforts w i l l therefore b e focused o n activities w i th a high ‘pub l ic good’ content and f o r 
w h i c h i t cu r ren t ly has a technical advantage v is -a -v is other actors (private sector, other 
donors, etc.). F o r example, two such areas are the p r o d u c t i o n o f househo ld surveys and the 
app l ica t ion o f p rog ram evaluation methods ( inc lud ing impac t evaluations). Third, neither o f 
the two p rev ious actions c o u l d conce ivab ly be imp lemen ted w i t h o u t stronger in te rna l 
incentives and WB s t a f f capacity t o de l ive r o n the results agenda.

India’s diverse context and counterparts’ v iews c a l l f o r a d i f fe ren t ia ted approach

development, capacity, and needs o f states and the center, as w e l l as the i r cons t i tu t iona l ly -

low - income and mo re advanced states, and cen t ra l agencies and entities (see table 2 f o r a 
c lass i f ica t ion o f Indian states based o n income). In low - income states and lagg ing regions o f 
mo re advanced states, t h e focus w i l l be o n helping t o achieve the MDG s , r e l y i n g p r im a r i l y

and at the central level, the focus w i l l be o n h e l p i n g t o strengthen ins t i tu t ions so they can 
deal with emerging m idd le - income challenges, r e l y i n g o n IBRD lending, cutting-edge

A m o n g the low - income states, this degree o f engagement i s envisaged in Bihar,

th rough the Bihar Strategic Partnership and a j o i n t Bihar strategy to support the government; 
a Deve lopmen t P o l i c y L o a n was approved in December 2007. The W B ' s engagement in 
Orissa dates back t o the second h a l f o f the 1990s, w h e n the state began unde r tak ing in -dep th 
reforms; a second DPL i s under imp lemen ta t ion . In U t t a r Pradesh, whe re the WB did i t s 
f i r s t sub-national Structural Ad jus tmen t Loan in India, i t i s re-engaging after a gap o f some

Orissa t r u s t funds, especially the DFID-WB t r u s t fund, have p layed an impo r tan t r o l e in 
supporting capacity building, and a re expected to con t inue t o do so.18

objectives. T h i s cou ld inc lude r u r a l roads, l i v e l i h o o d projects, and sma l l wa te r projects. In 
Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the W B ' s engagement has been m o r e limited and s ign i f ican t

At the central level, the WB w i l l continue i t s engagement with b o t h central

The WB has been supporting cen t ra l ly sponsored schemes (CSSs) f o r decades, 
pa r t icu la r ly after the i r r a p i d expansion during the Ten th Plan p e r i o d and their association 
with some o f the k e y MDGs. WB support has taken va r ious forms: support at t h e na t iona l 
level, i n i t i a l l y o f schemes already designed and then inc reas ing ly with an input i n t o scheme 
design ( fo r example, the Sawa Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) Educa t ion f o r A l l scheme); support t o

states in pa ra l le l t o the na t iona l scheme ( fo r example o n r u r a l water supply and sanitation) 
(see Annex 9 f o r a f u l l e r discussion o f the W B ' s experience with CSSs). W h e r e the WB has 
been able t o contribute t o improvements in the management o f funds, transparency, and

$600 million ou t o f a to ta l o f about $10.5 b i l l ion ) . Future engagements w i l l only take p lace

Ind ia 's agenda o n inc lus ive g r ow t h and sustainable development cannot be fully 
addressed w i thou t active reg iona l cooperation in South Asia, as many lagg ing areas are

Pak is tan i Prime M in is te rs (that paved t h e way t o some trade across the Line o f C o n t r o l 
dividing the two countries) and be tween the Indian and N e p a l i P r im e M in is te rs (that

Program-wide Action P lan to follow up on the D IR . The DIR acted as a catalyst t o

the WB went back ove r the f i v e hea l th projects covered by the DIR ( fou r o f w h i c h h a d 
already closed) and the nine on -go ing operations in t h e hea l th sector and adopted stringent 
measures t o ensure p rope r use o f WB resources. Nex t , recogn iz ing tha t the weaknesses 
revealed in the DIR were likely systemic and c o u l d well have occurred in other sectors, the 
WB developed a P rog ram -w ide A c t i o n Plan. The A c t i o n Plan, w h i c h a ims t o achieve 
rea l is t ic behav io ra l change in a number o f areas rather than just in t roduce check l is ts and 
boxes t o t ick , has a bearing o n several aspects o f WB activities:

Risk assessments: The WB i s in t roduc ing a new project-based COS0 assessment

0 S ta f f ing and capacities: WB s ta f f ing in the f iduc ia ry areas h a d lagged behind the 
recent r a p i d g r ow t h o f the I n d i a p rog ram and has been increased, while o the r sk i l ls , 
such as contract management and forensic accounting, are in short supply. Task 
teams need t ra in ing in detecting f raud and corruption, just-in-time support, and 
c l a r i t y o n roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities.

Portfolio Managemen t . O v e r a l l p o r t f o l i o performance was m i x e d over the 2004 
CAS period, with impressive results in the f i rs t h a l f o f the p e r i o d and less than satisfactory

which was above the WB average o f 24%, but also the highest f o r I n d i a ove r the last 2 0 
years. Since then, the ra t io has been dec l in ing and i s p ro jec ted t o reach i t s p re -2004 CAS 
l e v e l o f around 17%, re f lec t ing the impac t o f the scaling-up in lending, the entry o f new, 
slow-starting p ro jec ts in the po r t fo l io , and greater risk ave rs ion in imp lemen ta t ion support. 
The percentage o f comm i tmen ts at risk, d ow n t o 9% in FY05 , touched a f ive -yea r high o f

71. 
Lend ing . A greater focus o n supervision within a g iven budge t envelope and s ta f f ing 
complement w i l l mean relatively fewe r resources t o b e inves ted in l e n d i n g p repa ra t ion and

WBG t o focus o n low - income states, but also stressed that other states shou ld n o t b e 
excluded f r om the WB program. At the sector level, IDA resources are targeted t o MDG- 
related sectors: education, health, social protection, water supply and sanitation, r u r a l 
connec t iv i ty . IBRD lend ing has been demand-driven. The CAS proposes that se lec t iv i ty in 
IBRD lending b e achieved th rough a m o r e r igo rous p ro jec t selection process, to be 
imp lemen ted j o i n t l y with DEA. The k e y factor guiding this process w i l l b e strengthening

measures t o ensure effectiveness o f p ro jec t expenditures and an assessment o f exposure and 
r i s k s associated with the sectorktate po r t fo l io . F o r example, in sectors where current 
exposure i s high and the re a re la rge undisbursed amounts (e.g. hea l th o r roads), o r whe re 
compe t i t ion i s l o w and contractor performance h is to r ica l ly poor, new lending w o u l d b e

Ove r -p rog ramm ing w i l l b e b rough t d ow n t o about 20% during FY10 -12 , resulting in a

The DFID TF stood ou t f o r p r o v i d i n g s ign i f ican t resources in a flexible w a y t o

expected t o be about $19 m i l l i o n (the recipient-executed w i n d ow rema ined la rge ly

ANNEX 3 : SUMMARY OF CONSULTATIONS 

Beginning in the summer o f 2007, M s Isabe l Guerrero, who was then the W o r l d Bank I n d i a 

Coun t ry D i r e c t o r and i s n o w Sou th A s i a Vice-president, consulted widely with government 
counterparts, c i v i l society organizations, think t a n k s , research organizations, donor partners, 
and s ta f f o n wha t the W o r l d Bank shou ld do in I n d i a in the n e x t f ew years. At the 
consultations with c i v i l society in New Delhi in August-September 2007, pa r t ic ipan ts 
suggested that further consultations b e h e l d in some states. C i v i l society consultations were 
thus held in April 2008 in Mumba i , Maharashtra and Hyderabad, A n d h r a Pradesh and in 
September 2008 in Bhubaneswar, Orissa. Consultations with l i n e m in is t r ies were held in 
September-October 2008. Consultations with state authorities we re h e l d in Orissa in Sept. 
2008. 

CSO Consultations 

Many CSOs a i m to "democratize" the development process by suppo r t ing r igo rous systems 
o f accoun tab i l i ty and empowe r ing the p o o r t o pa r t ic ipa te in dec is ion making. From the WB, 
they l o o k f o r a long - te rm strategic partnership that gives them p roac t ive encouragement and 
support th rough p o l i c y advice and resources-the 
la t te r p re fe rab ly made available t o them 
directly. At c i v i l society consultations, CSOs expressed a n e e d to develop co l labo ra t ive 
ways o f w o r k i n g j o i n t l y with the WB in mon i to r ing , eva lua t ing and assessing the impac t o f 
projects. T h e y also expressed a desire t o b e considered as 'private ' entities when i t comes t o 
thinking about pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships in service de l ive ry . 

The CSOs made several recommendations regarding the W B ' s strategy: 
The W o r l d B a n k shou ld increase i t s focus o n the p o o r and vulnerable, pa r t icu la r ly o n 
ex is t ing pockets o f poverty, exc lus ion and dep r iva t ion in b o t h lagg ing and m o r e 
advanced states. 
Greater emphasis shou ld be placed on the governance agenda with appropriate systems 
o f accoun tab i l i ty t o imp rove the de l ive ry o f services. 
Space shou ld be created fo r p roac t ive pa r t ic ipa t ion by CSOs in a l l WB projects t o e n s u r e 
accoun tab i l i ty and transparency. M o n i t o r i n g o f p r o j ects th rough third-parties shou ld b e 
considered, and evaluations and impac t assessments shou ld be shared with key 
stakeholders in multi-stakeholder consultations. 
T o reduce pove r ty in the r u r a l areas, the World B a n k shou ld p romo te ag r icu l tu re and 
related activities, and engage with sma l l and m a r g i n a l farmers, the i r associations, as well 
as c i v i l society organizations working with them. 
The W o r l d Bank shou ld factor in the impac t o f c l ima te change on p o o r peop le w h i l e 
deve lop ing and c omm i t t i n g t o any i n i t i a t i v e f o r adaptation to and/or m i t i g a t i n g the 
impac t o f c l ima te change in the country. 

The CSOs we re o f the o p i n i o n that the W o r l d Bank shou ld increase i t s know ledge sharing 
interactions with grassroots organizations. I t i s impo r tan t f o r the Bank t o lea rn f r o m those at 
the grassroots as many innova t ive practices in ag r icu l tu re and wa te r management are based 
upon l o c a l knowledge. The Bank can then help scale up these innova t ions and disseminate 
t h i s know ledge g loba l ly .

Consultations w i t h government 

In addition to discussions with Ministry o f Finance o f f ic ia ls , w h i c h took place throughout 

the C A S preparation, consultations with l i n e m in is t r ies were held in Sept.-Oct. 2008. These 
consultations were generally held with the relevant secretary and h i s h e r staff, and focused 
o n b o t h the ove ra l l WBG strategy and the sector strategy. As o f end-October 2008, 
consultations h a d been h e l d with nine l i n e m i n i s t r i e s and the Planning Commission, with 
several more planned in November 2008, t o be focused o n issues related to implementing 
the C A S (should any major issue emerge from the rema in ing consultations, i t w i l l b e flagged 
t o the Board). 

At the state level, the WBG team presented the eme rg ing thrusts o f the strategy to 
representatives o f f i v e eastern states (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa, West Bengal) 
at a workshop organized by the MoF 's Department o f Econom ic A f fa i rs in June 2008 in 
Ranchi, Jharkhand. The strategy was also discussed with top o f f ic ia ls o f the Orissa 
government in Sept. 2008; similar consultations with Bihari o f f ic ia ls we re postponed 
because o f the August 2008 floods.

T h i s Comp le t ion Repo r t i s a self-assessment o f the I n d i a C o u n t r y Strategy (CAS) 
f o r FY05-08 (henceforth re fe r red t o as the 2004 C A S o r the CAS).’ The 2004 
C A S was presented t o the B o a r d in Augus t 2004, sho r t ly a f te r na t iona l elections 
at a t im e when the Indian economy was beginning t o g r ow at a r a p i d pace. The 
new government was successful in accelerating r a p i d growth through m id -2008 
with high leve ls o f investment; but progress 
towards 
Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) was s lowe r than hoped-for. M o r e recen t ly the

In this context o f rapid g r ow t h but s t i l l high levels o f poverty and human

impact, the W o r l d Bank (WB) strategy sh i f ted f r om the p rev ious “focus state” 
strategy, w h i c h had targeted support t o o n l y those states willing to adopt 
comprehensive m a j o r reforms, t o a broader and mo re inc lus ive strategy a imed at 
p r o v i d i n g in-depth support t o Ind ia ’s 12 poorest states. The expanded state 
approach was t o b e complemented by greater support at t h e na t iona l level, 
i n c l u d i n g an emphasis o n ana ly t ica l wo rk . T o scale up impact, the C A S adopted 
th ree strategic principles: (i) a stronger focus on outcomes; (ii) se lec t iv i ty in 
app ly ing resources t o m a x im i z e a i d effectiveness; and (iii) an expansion o f the 
WBG r o l e as know ledge generator and p rov ide r . Section I11 discusses the 2004 
approach in the context o f the W B ’ s strategy in I n d i a ove r the p rev ious decade 
and a half, and rev iews the effectiveness o f the t h r e e strategic p r inc ip les . 

W h i l e the geographical focus o f WB assistance sh i f ted somewhat, the WBG ’ s 
p rog ram p r io r i t ies , a l igned with Ind ia ’s ow n p r io r i t ies and development goals, 
remained unchanged f r o m the 2001 I n d i a CAS : (i) im p r o v e government 
effectiveness; (ii) inves t in peop le and empower communities; and (iii) p romo te 
private sector-led g row th . Progress against C A S outcomes i s discussed in 
Section I V and WB performance v is -$v is i t s instruments i s rev iewed in Section

The m a i n conc lus ion o f th is Comp le t ion Repo r t i s that the WB was successful in

large and comp lex as India’s, where the WB i s but a sma l l player, i s ex t reme ly

judgment based la rge ly o n qua l i ta t ive in fo rma t ion . 
Second, even where

11. Progress towards Ind ia ’s Long -T e rm Strategic Goals 

7. 

Wha t were the goals that I n d i a was a im ing t o achieve ove r the C A S period, and 
h o w m u c h progress was made? India’s development goals are set ou t in i t s Five 
Year Plans, comprehensive development f ramewo rks that re f lec t key p r io r i t ies 
and strategies based o n current development thinking, on -go ing rev iews o f 
progress under p rev ious plans and consideration o f p o l i t i c a l economy issues. The 
P lan periods do n o t correspond with leg is la t ive and executive mandates, thus 
p r o v i d i n g some con t inu i ty th rough p o l i t i c a l cycles. 
Ind ia ’s Ten th P l a n (2002- 
2007), w h i c h also served as Ind ia ’s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy, p rov ided the 
basis f o r the 2004 CAS . The C A S identified fou r key p r i o r i t y goals f r o m the 
Tenth P l a n t o w h i c h the W o r l d Bank (WB) w o u l d contribute:

(i) accelerate g r ow t h with increased p u b l i c investment and f isca l adjustment; 

(ii) s ign i f ican t ly enhance p r o v i s i o n o f infrastructure services 

(iii)reduce poverty, with special emphasis o n the lagg ing states and o n education 
and hea l th outcomes; and 

( iv ) imp rove governance, i n c l u d i n g accountability, transparency, service de l ive ry 
and anti-corruption. 

8. 

These goals p roved t o be b o t h robust ove r t im e - they have la rge ly been ca r r ied 
over 
i n t o the Eleventh P l a n (2008-2013) - and su f f ic ien t ly f l e x i b l e t o 
accommodate e v o l v i n g circumstances and experiences. An extensive array o f 
p o l i c y and p rog ram in i t ia t ives was imp lemen ted during the 2004 C A S p e r i o d t o 
make progress towards these goals (Attachment A4.2 
l i s t s k e y Go1 in i t ia t ives 
during the C A S period). T h e remainder o f t h i s section rev iews Ind ia 's progress t o 
achieve these goals. 

Accelerate growth 

9. 

10. 

India 's recent ove ra l l g r ow t h performance exceeded expectations. Aggregate 
g r ow t h accelerated f r o m 6.8% p e r year average during 2002 -04 t o about 9.2% p e r 
year during 2004-08. T h i s acceleration was associated with a s ign i f ican t increase 
in the rate o f investment, 
f r o m around 28% t o 36% o f GDP. 
Industry, 
manufacturing, and services a l l averaged 10 -1 1% annual g r ow t h f r o m 2005 
onwards. This ma rks a pa r t icu la r acceleration f o r manufacturing, w h i c h h a d been 
lagg ing other industry and the services sector. 

C loud ing this bright p ic tu re i s the lackluster performance o f agriculture, w h i c h 
has grown at less than 3% pe r year during b o t h the 9* and l o t h Plan pe r iods 
(although with good ra ins since 2006, recent g r ow t h has been at the high end o f a 
quite vo la t i le range). T h i s performance he igh tened concerns about the linkages 
between Ind ia 's g r ow t h process and pove r ty reduction, in terms o f generating 
incomes for the r u r a l poor, w h o are ove rwhe lm ing ly dependent o n agriculture. 
W h i l e there have been many success stories in the r u r a l sector, i t seems 
increasingly clear that the po l ic ies needed t o achieve sustained h ighe r ove ra l l 
ag r icu l tu ra l g r ow t h are n o t f i l l y in p lace , suggesting that there m a y be both 
analytical and imp lemen ta t ion gaps. With th is caveat, I n d i a made v e r y s t rong 
progress towa rd the goa l o f accelerating growth, with f isca l adjustment p r o v i d i n g 
the space f o r increased investment and expenditure res t ruc tu r ing suppo r t ing 
g r ow t h oriented re fo rms and programs. . 

Enhance provision of 

infrastructure 

11. 

M a j o r e f fo r ts wen t i n t o im p r o v i n g Ind ia 's roads, railways, ports, p ow e r 
availability, and commun ica t ions and progress was significant, but n o t su f f ic ien t 
to keep up with demand, so a la rge gap s t i l l remains. In the energy sector, the 
Ten th P lan targeted an increase in p ow e r generating capacity o f 41,100 MW, an 

CAS ANNEX 4: FY05-08 CAS Completion Report 
Page 4 o f 2 9 

ambitious 40% above ins ta l led capacity in 2001. In the event, o n l y about 25,000 
M W were b rough t o n stream. W h i l e this s t i l l represents the la rges t inc remen t in 
capacity under any five year pe r iod in Ind ia 's history, i t s inadequacy re la t ive t o 
the demands o f a r a p i d l y g r ow i n g economy i s apparent. Peak shortages 
deteriorated ove r the p e r i o d and were estimated t o b e 14% in 2006. The 
inadequacy o f e lec t r ic i ty supply i s con f i rmed by the 2007 Investment C l ima te 
Assessment ( ICA ) : p ow e r shortages were i d e n t i f i e d as the mos t severe constraint 
t o f i rm s in 2006. Go1 analysis suggests that delays in techn ica l t ie -ups by the 
m a i n (public sector) equipment supplier, BHEL, were one m a j o r cause o f delays 
in capacity c om i n g o n board; other factors were delays in clearances f o r 
hyd ropowe r p ro jec ts and p o o r sequencing in p ro jec t p lann ing . In add i t ion t o 
shortfalls in p lanned capacity increments, 
there was l i t t l e imp rovemen t in 
aggregate e f f ic iency across State E lec t r ic i ty Boards. 

12. 

Progress in transport has been somewhat better. During the Ninth and Ten th 
Plans combined, I n d i a added almost 35,000 k m s t o the na t iona l h i g hw a y network, 
e f fec t ive ly doub l ing i t s size. The mos t s ign i f ican t achievement during the m o r e 
recent pe r iod was the substantial progress towa rd comp le t ion o f the "go lden 
quadrilateral" four-lane ne two rk connecting Ind ia 's m a i n comme rc ia l centers. 
R a i lw a y t ra f f ic (bo th passenger and f re igh t ) also grew at unprecedented rates, and 
the re were s ign i f ican t e f f ic iency gains b o t h in the u t i l i z a t i o n o f wagons and

fewer f i r m s than t w o years earlier (7% versus 12%) ind ica ted transportation as a 
severe constraint. 
R u r a l road connec t iv i ty also

imp rovemen t during the C A S period, but s t i l l f e l l w e l l short o f t h e amb i t ious 
goals se t ou t in the Ten th Plan under the Bha ra t N i r m a n p rog ram and the 
accompanying PMGSY p rog ram f o r r u r a l r o a d upg rad ing and construction. 

13. 

Overall, progress in the p r o v i s i o n o f infrastructure services was moderate with the 
improvements in transport services offset by a widening gap be tween demand f o r 
and supply o f energy. In addition, the extension o f r o a d in f ras t ruc tu re t o r u r a l 
habitations lags behind. Ind ia 's longe r t e rm goals f o r in f ras t ruc tu re rema in 
appropriate; but issues o f implementation, especially p ro jec t and p rog ram 
management, w i l l need greater attention. 

Reduce poverty 

14. 

The mos t recent data o n pove r ty and several MDGs date back t o around 2005, so 
progress ove r the C A S pe r iod cannot r e a l l y be assessed. Nevertheless, i t i s 
impo r tan t t o r e v i ew the trends over the p e r i o d f r o m the m id -1990s t o the mid- 
2000s, as this p rov ides the baseline f o r the current p o l i c y debate and strategy 
design. Ove r the decade f r om the m id -1990s t o the mid-2000s, I n d i a made less 
progress in reduc ing pove r ty and achieving the M D G s than was hoped fo r . The

about 6% annually. This i s re la t ive ly weaker performance than was anticipated in

the 2004 CAS . The 2004/05 N S S data d o c o n f i rm the high incidence o f p o v e r t y 
in those states identified in the C A S as being the poorest. 

Da ta f r o m the 2006 N D H S and other sources show that some human development 
ind ica to rs imp roved : An impressive 25 m i l l i o n add i t iona l ch i ld ren en ro l led in 
school between 2002 and 2006; infant m o r t a l i t y dec l ined markedly f r o m 68 pe r 
thousand in 1998 t o 57 in 2005. O the r ind ica to rs did n o t show imp rovemen t : 
d ropou t rates rema ined high and there was l i t t l e evidence that lea rn ing outcomes 
imp roved ; immun iza t ion rates and c h i l d m a l n u t r i t i o n ba re ly im p r o v e d during this 
period. F o r these la t te r outcomes, , imp rovemen ts in the lowe r - income states 
exceeded those in several m i d d l e and higher i n c om e states, although the r iche r 
states s t i l l ou t -pe r fo rmed the poo re r states o n average,. This suggests that 
p rob lems o f access t o and qua l i ty o f p u b l i c services are by n o means con f ined t o 
l o w income states and that poo r fam i l ies in m i d d l e - and higher income states are 
affected in the same w a y as the commensurately la rge r number o f poor fam i l ies in 
the lagg ing states. 

Improve governance 

16. 

Governance ind ica to rs imp roved s ign i f ican t ly during the CAS . The basis f o r th is 
imp rovemen t lay, inter a l ia , with the passage o f the Right t o I n f o rm a t i o n A c t in 
2005, the amendment o f the A l l I n d i a Service Ru les t o p r o v i d e f o r f ixed - te rm

VAT; and rev is ions in po l ic ies gove rn ing vo lun ta ry organizations w h i c h 
recognize the importance o f their r o l e in p r om o t i n g pa r t ic ipa to ry systems. Partly 
as a resu l t o f these actions, several governance ind ica to rs imp roved :

0 Evidence f r om the 2007 I C A indicates a decline ( f r om 37% in the 
p rev ious I C A ) t o 28% in the p r o p o r t i o n o f f i r m s repo r t ing co r rup t ion as a 
ma jo r obstacle. S im i l a r l y s ign i f ican t declines were reco rded in p o l i c y 
uncertainty, licensing, crime, and an t i -compe t i t ive behavior. 

These improvements notwithstanding, governance shortcomings r em a i n a m a j o r 
obstacle t o ach iev ing b e t t e r development outcomes in Ind ia . The government's 
own rev iew o f experience during t h e Ten th Plan acknowledges that, in spite o f 
re la t ive improvements, the scale o f the rema in ing governance challenges remains 
daunting, pa r t icu la r ly as they relate t o de l ive r ing services t o the urban and r u r a l 
poor. 

Overall, India 's m i x e d reco rd o n progress towards long - te rm goals suggests that 
t w o aspects o f imp lemen ta t ion warrant hrther attention. The f i r s t aspect i s the 
r o l e and effectiveness o f centrally-sponsored schemes (CSSs) as a p r im e 
mechanism t o in f luence outcomes in matters that are primarily o r p a r t i a l l y the 
respons ib i l i ty o f state g ~ v e m m e n t s . ~ CSSs have mush roomed during recent years, 
g r ow i n g f r o m $7 b i l l i o n in 2002-03 t o $20 b i l l i o n in 2007-08. The Eleventh Plan 
i t s e l f presents a c r i t ica l assessment o f the performance o f CSSs, n o t i n g the lack o f 
integration, w i th even m u t u a l l y c o n f l i c t i n g aspects, rigidity, m u l t i p l i c i t y o f l o c a l 
delivery structures, inadequate p ro fess iona l and techn ica l support and a lack o f 
outcome-based evaluation (but even so goes o n t o propose a m a j o r expansion o f 
CSSs). 
In add i t ion t o the shortcomings identified in the E leven th Plan, CSSs 
make very inadequate u s e o f l o c a l government structures 
in engaging 
communities in their o w n development and indeed m a y even w o r k t o unde rm ine 
l o c a l capacity. CSS funds also inc reas ing ly bypass state treasuries, presenting 
s ign i f ican t f iduc ia ry r isks and l a c k o f accountability. G i v e n th is analysis, the 
effectiveness o f CSSs in scaling up development impac t in Ind ia 's inc reas ing ly 
decentralized p o l i t i c a l and ins t i tu t iona l environment needs c a r e h l consideration 
and mon i to r ing . Nevertheless, CSSs have p roved t o b e the primary veh ic le by 
w h i c h the na t iona l government intercedes in key areas a f fec t ing Ind ia 's p o o r 
fam i l ies (and thereby promotes the MDGs as well). 

19. 

The second aspect o f imp lemen ta t ion that warrants attention i s the v i r t u a l absence 
o f any e f fec t ive m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o f development programs at b o t h 
center and state levels. Again, the Eleventh Plan p rov ides a clear diagnosis, 
i d e n t i f y i n g the lack o f baseline data, fa i lu re t o identify appropriate process and 
outcome indicators, inadequate mechanisms f o r data analysis, and fa i lu re t o 
f o l l ow - u p when M&E does occur. An unavoidable challenge f o r the nex t C A S i s 
h o w t o in t roduce outcomes-based M&E in a scaled-up, sustainable manner.

The m a i n ob jec t ive o f the 2004 CAS-to 
“max im ize and leverage the diverse 
resources o f the W o r l d Bank G roup t o d rama t ica l ly scale up our impac t . . . [to] 
he lp I n d i a m o v e closer t o ach iev ing the MDGs ’ -shou ld be seen in the con tex t o f 
the evo lv ing strategy o f t h e WB in I n d i a ove r the past decade and a ha l f . 

In the early 1990s, the WB he lped I n d i a s tab i l ize i t s economy th rough p o l i c y 
reforms supported by IDA adjustment lend ing and investments in power, water, 
and the soc ia l sectors. With the success o f s tab i l iza t ion measures, complemented 
by exchange rate adjustments and industrial, 
trade, and f inanc ia l sector 
liberalization, in res to r ing growth, the scope f o r WB engagement in the p o l i c y 
fo rmu la t ion and imp lemen ta t ion process at the na t iona l l e v e l na tu ra l ly shrank. 
But i t was apparent t o b o t h the WB and Go1 counterparts that s ign i f ican t 
adjustments we re s t i l l requ i red at the state l e v e l t o l a y the basis f o r sustained r a p i d 
growth. 
However, the WB h a d h a d very limited experience engaging state 
governments in p o l i c y dialogue supported by po l icy -based and investment 
lending. 

Beginning in the m id - l99Os , the Bank began supporting state-level interventions 
in those states that we re w i l l ing t o engage in comprehensive p o l i c y dialogue and 
reform, thus demonstrating that i t c o u l d w o r k e f fec t ive ly at the state l e v e l and that 
comprehensive state-level re fo rms were associated with im p r o v e d outcomes in 
t e rm s o f f isca l performance, growth, pove r ty reduction, and, less un i fo rm ly , 
pub l ic sector performance and governance. 
The state-level approach also 
p rov ided clear lessons o f experience in the p o l i t i c a l economy o f linking WB 
assistance with comprehensive r e f o rm packages. The concentration o f WB 
programs in a few r e f o rm i n g states (Andh ra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, 
and later Tamil Nadu ) carried with i t the predictable r i s k s o f p o r t f o l i o 
concentration in a highly p o l i t i c i z e d context, w h i c h resulted in s ign i f ican t swings 
in the vo lume o f lending and spending o n ana ly t ica l wo rk . Espec ia l ly during the 
ea r ly years o f the shift t o state-level engagement, the res idua l r o l e o f the WB at 
the na t iona l l e v e l was n o t we l l -de f ined and dialogue with the center suffered. 

The 2001 C A S re in fo rced the “focus state” emphasis with a comm i tmen t t o 
support r e f o rm i n g states with sizable packages o f policy-based lend ing linked t o 
investment lending in key sectors. Re f lec t ing Go1 concerns, there was a stronger 
comm i tmen t t o g ive p re fe ren t ia l access t o poorer, r e f o rm i n g states. In the event, 
the substantial step up in WB lend ing foreseen in r e f o rm i n g states did n o t occur, 
g iven the ups and downs o f p o l i t i c a l commitment, with the resu l t that n o ‘lagging’ 
states we re able t o satisfy the c r i te r ia f o r engagement. WE? p o l i c y dialogue and 
new lend ing therefore concentrated o n the th ree southern states, which, although 
home t o la rge numbers o f poo r households, were generally regarded as hav ing 
good prospects. 

26. 

The imp lemen ta t ion r e v i ew o f the 2001 CAS, prepared in 2004, drew fou r lessons 
from the experience with state-level engagement: i) C A S goals h a d been achieved 

C A S ANNEX 4: FYOS-OS C A S C om p l e t i o n R e p o r t 
Page 9 o f 29 

in the focus, r e f o rm i n g states; ii) the ‘‘focus state” approach was too na r row and 
l e f t t h e bulk o f the p o o r unaffected by WB activities; iii) measures we re needed t o 
deal with the unp red ic tab i l i ty o f engagement; and iv) a concern with g r ow t h and 
pove r ty reduc t ion requ i red invo lvemen t with cen t ra l Go1 programs, especially in 
infrastructure and human development. Contemporaneous developments in I n d i a 
and g loba l ly re in fo rced this reassessment o f the W B ’ s approach. Center-state 
relations h a d been s ign i f ican t ly affected by a 
renewed emphasis o n 
the Panchayati R a j institutions, by the 
decentralization and strengthening 
p rov is ions o f the 12th Finance Commission, and by changes in the on - lend ing 
t e rm s t o the states f o r external f inanc ia l support. By the ea r ly 2000s, the pace o f 
na t iona l r e f o rm h a d s lowed and g r ow t h rates appeared t o have plateaued w e l l 
b e l ow Ind ia ’s pe rce ived potential, giving r ise t o renewed interest in na t iona l 
p o l i c y dialogue and engagement. F i n a l l y the development o f the MDGs and the 
adop t ion by I n d i a o f amb i t ious targets l e d t o the rea l iza t ion that im p r o v i n g the 
performance o f those lagg ing states with la rge concentrations o f pove r ty w o u l d b e 
essential t o ach iev ing the MDGs, a goa l t o w h i c h b o t h I n d i a and the WB we re 
s t rong ly committed. 

As a resu l t o f th is a l ignmen t o f na t iona l and g loba l developments with the W B ’ s 
own assessment o f the 2001 C A S imp lemen ta t ion experience, the core strategic 
issue f o r the 2004 C A S became h o w t o scale up impac t in a na t iona l context 
bea r ing in mind that, even with a s ign i f ican t s tep up in lending, WB resources 
w o u l d continue t o b e a tiny p o r t i o n o f the who le . The 2004 C A S proposed that 
the WB tackle the challenge o f ‘scaling up’ th rough f o u r measures: 
0 m o d i f y the g round ru les f o r enga ement with the states and center in order 
t o increase lending opportunities F

The remainder o f th is section t a k e s stock o f the lessons learned in app ly ing these measures 
as a means o f sca l ing up impact. 

Engagement w i t h states and center 

28. 

In their recent retrospective, Howes, M i s h r a and Ravishankar (2008) summarize 
the 2004 CAS approach t o the states as fo l lows : “The 2004 C A S proposed two 
m a i n new ways t o g i v e mo re emphasis t o p o o r states. First, t o dedicate greater 
resources t o engagement with them, and t o p r o v i d e techn ica l assistance.

A l t h o u g h increased l e n d i n g was n o t the m e t r i c f o r increased impac t , a n increase in l e n d i n g v o l um e was

Regardless o f performance, m o r e resources fo r these ac t iv i t ies we re p rom ised f o r 
the fou r poorest states o f Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and U t t a r Pradesh. Second, a 
greater spread o f resources was promised fo r states that c o u l d develop r e f o rm 
plans o r mee t good practice gu ide l ines fo r at leas t the sector concerned. N o longe r 
w o u l d decisions o n investment projects t a k e i n t o account the ‘general p o l i c y 
framework’ o f the state; rather proposals f r o m a l l states w o u l d be considered o n 
In add i t ion t o the focus o n the fou r poorest states, the 2004 

the i r o w n  merit^."^ 

C A S also ma rked a hrther sh i f t away from a limited number o f focus states in 

favo r o f opening up dialogue with a l l t w e l v e o f Ind ia ’s largest and poorest states 
o n the cross-cutting p o l i c y issues that constitute the basis f o r state-level 

adjustment . 

29. 

T h i s approach h a d some success. The engagement with Orissa deepened during 
the C A S period, and from 2007 t h e WB engagement with Bihar began t o develop 
m o r e s t rong ly (in partnership with DFID and ADB), lead ing t o a Deve lopmen t 
P o l i c y L o a n (DPL). After a p o l i t i c a l b reak th rough in UP in 2007, there has been 
some uptake in the dialogue after a l o n g hiatus, and discussions are cu r ren t ly 
underway o n a possible D P L . The emphasis o n DPLs in the poorest states has 
reinforced the bene f i ts o f sub-national p o l i c y engagement as described in greater 
de ta i l in C A S Annex 6 and has generated a separate se t o f lessons f r o m this type 
o f engagement (stretching back ove r the last three C A S periods). In Jharkhand, 
the B a n k prepared an economic report, but there has been l i t t l e interest in 
discussion o r fo l low -up , partly as a resu l t o f p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty . Desp i te these 
achievements, by June 2008 about 10% o f the W B ’ s p o r t f o l i o was accounted f o r 
by single-state loans t o the four poorest states (see A t tachmen t Tab le A4.3) in 
contrast t o 14% o f the p o r t f o l i o in June 2004.’ 
In contrast, the stock o f 
outstanding commitments directed t o the t h r e e p rev ious focus states o f TN, 
Ka rna taka and AP increased from 22% t o 24% between these t w o dates. As o f 
June, 2008, 12% o f single-state loans we re d i rec ted towa rd states n o t among the 
12 largest and poorest (a s l igh t increase ove r the June 2004 figure). A notable 
example o f the latter i s the s ign i f ican t increase in WB p o l i c y lending and 
operational engagement in H im a c h a l Pradesh, a state n e i t h e r large nor poo r . 
Au tho r i t ies have pressed the WB to increase i t s invo lvemen t in the m o r e f rag i le 
sma l l states at the periphery. These states pose a clear development challenge but 
c o u l d push the p rog ram h r t h e r f r o m i t s goa l o f sca l ing up in re la t ion t o pove r ty

The clear lesson i s that a change in emphasis (e.g. t ow a r d the four poorest states) 
i s easier said than done. The ine r t ia in the WB program i s considerable (given 
ana ly t ica l gaps in new areas, p ro jec t preparation 
lead times, established 
relationships, etc); therefore i t t a k e s determined e f fo r t and t im e to implement new 
p r io r i t ies . There w i l l also be, in the p o l i t i c a l economic con tex t o f India, pressures 
t o deviate f r o m any l i m i t e d set o f p r i o r i t y states, o f ten f o r good reasons. The 
oppo r tun i ty costs o f such deviations shou ld howeve r b e m o r e e x p l i c i t l y i d e n t i f i e d 
rather than s im p l y accommodated th rough spreading the ava i lab le resources 
across an inev i tab ly la rge r number o f ac t iv i t ies . 

The 2004 C A S e x p l i c i t l y recognized that the goa l o f sca l ing up necessarily 
entailed not just expanding i n t o the poorest states but also inc reas ing operations at 
the na t iona l level, pa r t icu la r ly in infrastructure and human development. M u c h o f 
t h i s operational engagement was l i n k e d t o the s ign i f ican t expansion o f CSSs 
during the Ten th Plan. The impac t o f WB invo lvemen t in na t iona l l e v e l schemes 
i s d i f f i c u l t t o document. Partly this i s due t o va r ia t ion in the w a y in w h i c h the 
WB has engaged with CSSs and partly t o great v a r i a b i l i t y in the ava i lab i l i ty o f 
data f r om the CSSs themselves. Some schemes a re ach iev ing considerable 
success in terms o f outcomes, f o r instance primary education, HIV-AIDS, TB and 
lep rosy control; others are n o t ( inc lud ing the In teg ra ted C h i l d Deve lopmen t 
Scheme and the scheme t o r e f o rm state p ow e r u t i l i t ies ) . The ove ra l l ques t ion ing 
o f the effectiveness o f CSSs discussed under na t iona l strategies above suggests 
that success in sca l ing up impac t th rough support f o r na t iona l - leve l CSSs cannot 
be assumed and that 
ins t i tu t iona l issues related 
t o decentralization and 
imp lemen ta t ion issues re la ted t o 
f iduc ia ry con t ro l and management pose 
between the ends o f F Y 0 4 and F Y 0 8 (Attachment Tab le A4.3). ’’ C A S Annex 8 
s ign i f ican t risks. In the event the share o f the p o r t f o l i o suppo r t in CSSs declined 
describes in greater de ta i l the d i f fe ren t moda l i t ies o f WB invo lvemen t with CSSs 
and the pa r t icu la r issues which have been i d e n t i f i e d as a result. O v e r a l l th is 
experience suggests that a d i f fe ren t ia ted approach i s necessary. CSSs vary greatly 

and the WB engagement shou ld re f lec t the needs o f the particular sec tor and the 

variety o f state experience and needs. However i t does seem clear that ce r ta in 
generic c r i te r ia need t o b e in place: an a b i l i t y t o t rack the m o n e y d o w n t o the l e v e l 
o f service p r o v i s i o n and verify outputs, satisfactory f ramewo rks f o r governance, 
accoun tab i l i ty and M&E, and a r igo rous assessment o f f inanc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l 
sustainability tak ing account o f the convergence o f multiple CSSs at the d is t r ic t 
leve l . Whe re these elements a re not h l l y in p lace the WB shou ld b e cautious 
about invo lvemen t unless i t s engagement i s c lea r ly l i n k e d t o strengthening these 
aspects.

As with state shares, this comparison i s sensitive to time l i n e s o f particular operations supporting CSSs. 
In t h i s case the US$521m operation supporting Vector Born D isease Control approved in July, 2008 would 
inc rease the CSS share by over 6 percentage points to about t h e same level as June, 2004.

sense: scaling up impac t must en ta i l bringing increased know ledge t o bear o n t h e 
development challenges 
I n d i a faces and f lagsh ip reports a re an obv ious 
mechanism t o fulfill this goal. Ce r ta in reports c lea r ly qua l i fy : f o r example, t h e 
2006 Deve lopmen t P o l i c y R e v i ew (DPR), with i t s emphasis o n service delivery, 
had a pa rad igm -sh i f t ing impac t o n h o w this issue was pe rce ived in I n d i a and 
therefore o n a b road range o f government as w e l l as WE3 programs. In th is case 
the process began with the 2004 W o r l d Deve lopmen t Repo r t o n service de l ive ry 
w h i c h h a d a special focus o n South A s i a with several key s t a f f ac tua l ly posted t o 
the R e g i o n (and located in the Delhi office). T h i s enabled a strong engagement 
with l o c a l stakeholders that was fo l lowed up in the DPR and consequently h a d 
excep t iona l ly b road synergy with I n d i a n thinking o n this i s s u e (as re f lec ted in the 
llth Plan f o r example) S im i l a r l y the repo r ts o n d i s a b i l i t y and safety ne ts 
s ign i f ican t ly affected the awareness o f these i s s u e s among policy-makers, WB 
staff, and citizens at large. These no tab le successes suggest that even m o r e 
attention needs t o be g iven t o i d e n t i f j m g top ics f o r mu l t i -yea r thematic AAA as 
f r e e standing WB outputs independent o f lending and l i n k e d t o a set o f 
mon i to rab le outcomes. A mo re exp l ic i t results focus t o AAA, i n c l u d i n g flagship 
reports, w o u l d fac i l i ta te the dissemination and f o l l ow - u p o f k e y findings that 
characterized the DPR and social p ro tec t ion reports. 

Strategic p r inc ip les : selectivity, knowledge p rov is ion , and focus on outcomes 

33.

Selectivity. A l t h o u g h ‘selectivity’ i s a man t ra in WB strategy documents, there i s 
o f ten too l i t t l e attention t o wha t se lec t iv i ty means in a pa r t icu la r coun t ry context 
at a given p o i n t in time, h o w se lec t iv i ty i s intended t o b e achieved, and h o w 
se lec t iv i ty w i l l con t r ibu te t o the strategic objective. The 2004 C A S did define 
h o w se lec t iv i ty w o u l d operate geographically, by i d e n t i f y i n g the fou r ‘lagging’ 
states and the twe lve large, p o o r states as p r io r i t ies f o r WE3 activities, but i t l e f t 
open the p o s s i b i l i t y o f lend ing in other states as l o n g as ce r ta in c r i te r ia were met 
and i t also inc luded support t o na t iona l programs as a p r i o r i t y . As a resu l t there 
were n o binding geographic constraints o n the WB p rog ram . 

In t e rm s o f sectors, support t o infrastructure and the M D G s was p r io r i t ized , but n o 
sectors were excluded. The primary mechanism t o achieve th is rather b road 
deg ree o f se lec t iv i ty i n v o l v e d the app l ica t ion o f guidelines o r “rules o f 
engagement”. The rules o f engagement we re meant t o ensure that that lending 
(and t o a lesser extent AAA) in each sector took p lace unde r those cond i t ions 
w h i c h were, given ex is t ing knowledge, considered necessary t o achieve the 
intended outcomes. Thus, by ensuring that WB ac t iv i t ies w o u l d n o t go fo rwa rd 
unless the (presumed) cond i t ions fo r success were in place, the gu ide l ines were 
intended t o con t r ibu te t o scaling up impact. The i m p l i c i t assumption was that the 
app l ica t ion o f the guidelines w o u l d limit the numbe r o f successful lending 
proposals by ra is ing the en t ry ba r and thereby p r o v i d e a “self-enforcing” 
mechanism t o achieve higher impac t th rough mo re selective lending.

Expe r ience with the guidelines has been m ixed . 
In the absence o f m o r e 
systematic M&E than cu r ren t ly exists at the p ro jec t level, i t i s d i f f i c u l t to draw 
general conclusions about the con t r ibu t ion o f the guidelines towa rd be t te r p ro jec t 
outcomes. However, i t does appear that the guidelines have h a d greater impac t o n 
the quality o f the operations when they have covered specific elements o f p ro jec t 
design than w h e n they focused on m o r e generic sector-wide factors. 
In those 
sectors with high c l ien t demand f o r operations (especially at the state level), WB 
s t a f f have po in ted to the va lue o f the guidelines in ensuring p ro jec t readiness and 
quality at entry. 
Indeed some proposed p ro jec ts were n o t taken up because they 
did n o t meet the guidelines (e.g. r u r a l e lec t r i f ica t ion and r u r a l water supply and 
sanitation (RWSS)). 
In those sectors with a sma l l number o f operations or 
operations developed in response t o special “one -o f f ’ challenges, the usefulness 
o f sector specific guidelines has been less clear. 

Guidelines we re also developed by Go1 f o r DPLs, t o ensure that states wishing t o 
access po l icy -based lending h a d in place appropriate f isca l management p rog rams 
in l i n e with na t iona l f isca l goals. Th is se t o f guidelines did func t ion e f fec t ive ly to 
in terms o f im p r o v e d 
f isca l performance, but did l i t t l e t o p r i o r i t i z e across ac t iv i t ies o r states in re la t ion 
t o the C A S pove r ty objectives (as the HP p rog ram attests). 

e n s u r e that state D P L s achieved their goals, especially 

In a p rog ram as b road as the Ind ia program, se lec t iv i ty i s usua l ly taken t o imply a 
reduc t ion in the numbe r o f ac t iv i t ies with the presumed in ten t ion o f ach iev ing a 
greater concentration o f resources t o enhance design and imp lemen ta t ion and 
thereby achieve higher quality operations. The guidelines have made o n l y a 
limited con t r ibu t ion t o such a resu l t . 
Incen t ives f o r inc lus ion in t h e w o r k 
p rog ram have continued t o dominate mechanisms f o r se lec t iv i ty resu l t ing in a 
la rge numbe r o f projects under p repa ra t ion at mos t po in ts in time during t h e C A S 
period. D e l i v e r y ra t ios also declined (for AAA, f o r instance, 77% o f tasks planned 
in 2005 we re completed, while in 2007 the r a t i o was 58%). In some cases, the 
guidelines c o u l d have ac tua l ly wo rked in a perverse manner as s t a f f “nursed” 
a long po ten t ia l ac t iv i t ies in an t ic ipa t ion that they w o u l d eventually qua l i fy . I f the 
goa l o f selectivity i s in fact t o free up resources t o im p r o v e implementation, fund 
M&E adequately, strengthen dissemination and fo l low -up , then the k e y lesson 
f r o m the experience with guidelines w o u l d seem t o b e that there i s l i t t l e substitute 
f o r m o r e e x p l i c i t and transparent gate-keeping f o r the operational and AAA 
program. 

Knowledge prov is ion . The p r inc ip le o f know ledge p r o v i s i o n and generation has 
h a d no tab le successes in the approach t o sca l ing up. The r o l e o f f lagsh ip reports 
has been no ted above. In addition, there have b e e n no tab le synergies be tween 
AAA and l e n d i n g - e . g . , the state economic repo r ts and DPLs , the AAA on c red i t 
and f inanc ia l markets f o l l ow e d by re la ted l e n d i n g and TA. WB I also made 
con t r ibu t ions t o know ledge p r o v i s i o n and generation in a diverse se t o f areas 
including the sensitive link between CSSs and RTI, benchma rk ing I n d i a in the 
con tex t o f the 2005 Know ledge Assessment, and enhancing the qua l i ty o f t ra in ing 
through, e.g. capacity ce r t i f ica t ion programs. With the expansion o f the W B ’ s 

CAS ANNEX 4: FY05-08 CAS Completion Report

invo lvemen t across states and at the center, demand-driven p o l i c y adv ice has also 
assumed a mo re s ign i f ican t r o l e in the f o r m o f b o t h p o l i c y notes and NLTA. The 
latter has g r ow n d rama t ica l ly during the C A S period, f r o m 7% o f AAA in 2005 t o 
33% in 2008. QAG ’s assessment o f the I n d i a AAA p rog ram in 2006 ra ted the 
ove ra l l p rog ram as satisfactory but po in ted ou t several areas f o r improvement, 
focus ing pa r t icu la r ly o n a l a c k o f coherence in the ove ra l l p rog ram . Further 
analysis by the C M U suggested that th is was due in pa r t t o the l a c k o f a 
systematic outcome-based approach t o the iden t i f ica t ion o f AAA activities, lack 
o f a c lea r ly defined AAA p roduc t mix linking audience and purpose, and muddled 
relationships between lend ing and AAA w h i c h can ta in t p o l i c y recommendations. 
In addition, Q A G suggested better app l ica t ion o f in te rna t iona l experience, mo re 
exp l ic i t attention t o fo l low -up , greater use o f l o c a l research capacity, and greater 
attention t o cross-sector know ledge sharing. These factors have l i m i t e d the 
con t r ibu t ion that the AAA p rog ram has made t o scaling up impac t . U l t ima te ly , 
transferring and generating know ledge and app ly ing i t th rough e f fec t ive 
imp lemen ta t ion i s the k e y t o sca l ing up impac t . Expe r ience during the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the 2004 C A S indicates that ach iev ing this goa l i s m u t u a l l y 
dependent o n i t s sister p r inc ip les o f focus ing o n outcomes and selectivity. 

Focus on outcomes. T o wha t extent did the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S indeed 
focus o n development outcomes, as anticipated in the C A S outcomes ma t r ix? 
The 2007 P o r t f o l i o Rev iew analyzed in de ta i l the degree t o w h i c h WB ac t iv i t ies 
c o u l d b e linked in a results cha in t o mon i to rab le outcomes and f o u n d marked 
differences across sectors in d e f i n i n g CAS outcomes, i d e n t i f y i n g indicators, and 
reco rd ing progress. W h i l e mos t sectors h a d identified elements o f a results chain,

This was pa r t icu la r ly a sho r tcom ing o f ac t iv i t ies w h i c h focused o n p o l i c y

A third measure proposed in the CAS t o scale up impac t was w o r k i n g mo re 
c lose ly with external partners. The WB did engage with several partners in the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the CAS, primarily DFID. Based o n their shared objectives, 
the WB and DFID entered i n t o a Strategic Partnership in 2005. The Partnership, 
whose m a i n instrument was a $35 m i l l i o n Trust Fund, was e x p l i c i t l y geared t o 
support imp lemen ta t ion o f the CAS , especially in lagg ing states, and in pa r t icu la r 
Bihar, w h i c h was a focus state f o r b o t h the WB and DFID. An independent 
evaluation o f th is partnership concluded that the T F resources executed by the 
WB had p layed a s ign i f ican t r o l e in enhancing WB ana ly t ica l work, but that they

the WB shared the ove ra l l strategy o f the CAS, a m o r e strategic use o f partnership

L e n d i n g and AAA. The targets set ou t in the 2004 C A S f o r lend ing and AAA 
were achieved, with average lend ing o f U S $ 2.6 b i l l i o n per year during the C A S 
period. The 2004 C A S did n o t put any limits o n the g r ow t h o f lending (other than 
those imposed by IDA ava i lab i l i ty and the S ing le -Bo r rowe r Limit f o r IBRD) and 
lending expanded f r o m US$7 .6 b i l l i o n unde r the 2001 C A S t o US$10.2 b i l l i o n . 
H ow e v e r the C A S imp lemen ta t ion experience suggests that, w h i l e scaling up 
lending was necessa ry t o ensure a con t inu ing “seat at the table”, there i s n o 
necessary link between sca l ing up lend ing and sca l ing up impact. There w i l l need 
t o b e a con t inu ing strong emphasis o n r em o v i n g other constraints t o scaling up 
impact. 

The lend ing and AAA programs as executed were f i l l y consistent with the 
p r io r i t ies se t in the CAS . W h i l e there we re considerable delays in p ro jec t 
preparation, these were, in many cases, l i n k e d t o the app l ica t ion o f the “guidelines 
f o r engagement” wh ich , as discussed, encouraged p ro jec t teams t o maintain 
p ro jec ts in the p o r t f o l i o in an t ic ipa t ion that the guidelines would even tua l ly b e 
met. In terms o f numbers, dropped projects we re concentrated in the f i rs t year o f 
C A S imp lemen ta t ion as the n ew focus o n states with high concentrations o f p o o r 
fam i l ies took hold. L a c k o f actual state demand re la t ive t o the i n i t i a l l y anticipated 
state uptake in p r i o r i t y areas also p layed a r o l e as did delays in the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Government’s in f ras t ruc tu re p rog ram and in the emergence 
o f an operational dialogue around c l ima te change and env i ronmen ta l issues. 
F i n a l l y the p rog ram o f urban lending that h a d been foreseen in the C A S was se t 
back by the controversy w h i c h erupted a round the W B ’ s proposed l o a n t o the

ensuring clear progress towards full cost recovery, strong au tonomy o f service

the unsatisfactory operational outcome highlighted several important lessons 
which have broad app l icab i l i ty t o the W B ’ s ac t iv i t ies in India: (i) the necessity

high o f 25.3% in FY06 , but then dec l ined to a 5-year l o w o f 18.3% in FY08 , and 

are now lagging beh ind the WB average. The down tu rn in disbursement in F Y 0 8 

was due t o a comb ina t ion o f p o o r performance in some sectors (Ag r icu l tu re & 
R u r a l Development, Finance, Health, and Urban), in some states (H imacha l

(e.g. R C H 2, NAP) and f inanc ia l intermediaries (notably, the $600 m i l l i o n R u r a l 
C red i t Cooperatives project, which has had a s low start).

P o r t f o l i o r i s k i n e s s , in terms o f ne t commitments at r i s k , has increased ove r the

de l ive r ing i t s mandate o f p o v e r t y reduc t ion th rough p r iva te sector development. 
I n d i a i s IFC’s second largest coun t ry exposure with investments in ove r 112 
companies to ta l ing $3.01 b i l l i o n f o r IFC’s o w n account and $606 m i l l i o n f o r the 
account o f participants (as o f August 31, 2008) - a substantial increase f r o m the 
U S $ 1.3 1 b i l l i o n in June, 2005. IFC made i t s largest comm i tmen ts o f $1.05 b i l l i o n 

in I n d i a in FY07 and FY08, up f r o m $412 m i l l i o n in FY05. 

The qua l i ty o f IFC’s l o a n p o r t f o l i o im p r o v e d with the hea l th o f the corporate 
sector and with l ow e r interest rates w h i c h reduced the burden o f debt service o n 
the corporate sector over mos t o f the CAS p e r i o d (though i n t e r e s t rates have r i s e n 
in the recent past as the central bank has sought t o con t ro l in f la t ion ) . During 
FY05-08, IFC investments we re spread across a number o f m a j o r sectors, with 
infrastructure becom ing the largest exposure f o l l ow e d by the f inanc ia l sector and 
general manufacturing. IFC’s in f ras t ruc tu re exposure i n c l u d i n g energy ( a l l power, 
inc lud ing captive p ow e r generation, gas transmission, renewable energy etc), 
logistics, 
transport, water and sanitation and so l id waste management) has 
increased f r o m 14% o f IFC’s p o r t f o l i o at the end o f FY 2006 t o 23% in 2007 and 
33% at the end o f June 2008. W h i l e r a p i d l y deve lop ing indus t r ia l sectors such as 
pulp and paper, s t e e l products and chemicals f o r m a la rge part o f the 
manu fac tu r ing po r t fo l io , investments we re inc reas ing ly made in sectors such as 
infrastructure, IT , pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, in areas where reg iona l 
demand was g r ow i n g o r new businesses we re be ing established (see Annex 1 f o r 
mo re detail). 

Qua l i ty of p roduc ts and services. Ove ra l l the qua l i ty o f WB p roduc ts and 
services as measured by QAG and IEG during the CAS p e r i o d can be assessed as 
satisfactory and we l l in l i n e with WB averages. A t tachmen t Tab le A4.8 
summarizes IEG ratings f o r I n d i a projects during the p rev ious two CAS periods. 
WB and bo r rowe r ove ra l l performance were ra ted somewhat m o r e highly during 
the later period. A mo re thematic ove rv iew suggests t h r e e areas in w h i c h WB 
performance evo lved s ign i f ican t ly during the CAS pe r iod in re la t ion t o the qua l i ty 
o f WB products and services, namely: i) the risk-reward t rade -o f f ; ii) the 
specification o f results chains i n c l u d i n g M&E; and iii) the r o l e o f knowledge. 
Each o f these key qua l i ty issues opened up s ign i f ican t ly during the CAS p e r i o d 
and remains t o b e resolved. Perhaps the mos t salient o f these i s the reassessment 
o f the risk-reward t rade -o f f in i n d i v i d u a l operations and the p o r t f o l i o ove ra l l . As 
WB s ta f f sh i f ted their focus t o lagg ing states and MDG-linked CSSs during th is 
CAS period, they became aware o f an increased se t o f r isks associated with weak 
p ro jec t management, fiduciary and procurement systems especially in the lagg ing 
states and in those CSSs w h i c h used imp lemen ta t ion arrangements l a c k i n g in 
transparency and accountability. The DIR heightened and sharpened this

awareness with i t s analysis o f b o t h bo r rowe r and WB sho r t fa l ls in p ro jec t design, 
management and supervision. This ratcheted up the w h o l e r i s k s ide o f the 
equation both at p ro jec t and p o r t f o l i o l e v e l s . At the same time, the po ten t ia l 
development outcomes l i n k e d t o im p r o v e d pe r fo rmance in l a g g i n g states (such as 
Orissa and Bihar) and successes such as primary education enrolment and T B 
eradication suggested tha t at least in some areas the C A S p r io r i t ies we re ach iev ing 
higher impact. Nevertheless i t became apparent that program imp lemen ta t ion 
required a m u c h m o r e systemic approach t o the n ew classes o f risk that had been 
identified, i n c l u d i n g f raud and corruption. The WB responded with a s ign i f ican t 
sh i f t o f resources i n t o FM and procurement support and a rethinking o f the basic 
approach t o p ro jec t supe rv is ion con t r ibu t ing t o a possible new business model. 
Howeve r this process o f change and adaptation t o new circumstances was n o t 
altogether smooth. At ce r ta in points c l ien t responsiveness su f fe red as the basis 
f o r reassessing r isks in pa r t icu la r sectors o r states was less w e l l commun ica ted 
pa r t icu la r ly at t h e ea r ly stages. During the n e x t C A S p e r i o d the WB w i l l need t o 
integrate a rev ised r isk - rewa rd calculus i n t o the ove ra l l WB strategy th rough new 
ways o f d o i n g business. 

63. W h i l e the C A S was clear that sca l ing up impact o f WB ac t iv i t ies requires a mo re 
systematic and r igo rous iden t i f ica t ion o f the results cha in running f r o m WB 
ac t iv i t ies as inpu ts th rough t o u l t ima te impact, the q u a l i t y o f WB performance 
was o f ten affected by the fact that the WB r o l e in I n d i a w i l l o f ten be at the 
margins o r in a suppo r t ive r o l e t o core processes. Th is seems pa r t icu la r ly true f o r 
adv iso ry services and capacity building ac t iv i t ies fo r w h i c h outputs have been 
o f ten confused with outcomes, as documented in the‘2007 P o r t f o l i o Rev iew . The 
inadequate spec i f ica t ion o f outcome ind ica to rs and co l lec t ion o f baseline data i s a 
serious compound ing factor. In the absence o f a p rog ram - wide comm i tmen t t o 
deve lop ing and imp lemen t ing an M&E system, th is sho r t fa l l i s l i k e l y t o persist 
with a con t inu ing negative 
impac t o n the W B ’ s ove ra l l development

f o r WB operations. 

64. 

The third aspect o f WB performance w i th a strong link t o q u a l i t y i s the increasing 
recogn i t ion o f the r o l e o f know ledge as a key d r ive r in the I n d i a -W B re la t ionsh ip 
whether as embodied know ledge in the p ro jec t p o r t f o l i o o r free-standing

VI. Conclusions

The m a i n conc lus ion o f th is Comp le t ion Repo r t i s that the WB was successful in a 
modest scaling up o f lending (p r ima r i ly in states in w h i c h the WB had already 
established a w o r k i n g relationship) and in deepening i t s engagement in selected 
low - income states while con t inu ing t o w o r k with na t iona l - leve l programs and 
entities and development partners. I t e f fec t ive ly supported central and state e f fo r ts 
t o strengthen f isca l management, expand k e y programs a imed at reaching the 
M D G s (pa r t icu la r ly p r im a r y education and r u r a l empowerment programs), and

encourage private sector-led growth. There was also progress in sca l ing up 

impac t as foreseen in the 2004 C A S particular but t h i s was mo re limited than 

anticipated. The key lesson i s that in i t ia t ives in a large, comp lex and largely 
c l i e n t driven p rog ram take can have o n l y inc remen ta l impact in a single C A S 
period and need t o be sustained over the l o n g t e r m t o generate s ign i f ican t impact. 
The strong focus o n se rv ice de l ive ry t o w h i c h the WB made m a j o r con t r ibu t ions 
during the 2004 C A S p e r i o d has taken r o o t b road ly in Ind ia . I f buttressed by 
fo l low - th rough o n the i n i t i a l steps t o enhance M&E, s treng then imp lemen ta t ion 
i n c l u d i n g p ro jec t management and accountability, focus AAA services better, and 
exercise greater se lec t iv i ty around C A S goals, the 2004 C A S w i l l have made a 
strong start towa rd greater development impact in the con tex t o f the i n t r i n s i c a l l y

ANNEX 7: A DECADE OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY LENDING I N INDIA 

Introduction 
1. 
W h i l e na t iona l Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Loans (DPLs) have been a u s e f u l B a n k 
ins t rumen t across the w o r l d t o support po l icy -based re fo rms with fast-disbursing budget 
and/or balance o f payments support, in I n d i a they have not been requested since the ea r ly 
1 9 9 0 ~ ~ ~ ~ 
given the generally prudent macroeconomic setting. State-level D P L s ( fo rme r ly 
ca l led Sub-national Adjustment Loans, o r SA LS ) have instead been impo r tan t . An 
innova t ive instrument within a federal setting in la rge countries, they a re designed t o 
p rov ide qu ick -d isbu rs ing budget support t o state governments to undertake f isca l and other 
p o l i c y re fo rms . I n d i a was among the f i r s t countries within the Bank t o rece ive sub-national 
SA L sDP L s , and i s p robab ly the mos t advanced in terms o f design. 

Origin and Context 
2. 
Ove r the course o f the 1990s, f o l l ow i n g the l ibe ra l iza t ion o f trade, inves tmen t and 
macro-economic policies, states in I n d i a began t o seriously compete f o r private investment. 
F isca l management and the investment c l ima te at the state l e v e l grew in importance. In l i n e 
with this development, the focus o f World Bank assistance t o I n d i a g radua l ly sh i f ted 
towards the states. The 1997 C A S stated: "As the focus of 

the reforms has shifted t o the 
states over the pas t few years, the Bank G roup 's assistance strategy is itself be ing reo r ien ted 
t o focus ma in ly on those states tha t have chosen t o embark on a comprehensive p r o g r am of 

economic reforms." Andh ra Pradesh (AP) , whose C h i e f Minister, Chandrababu Na idu , was 
fast eme rg ing as the pioneer among state reformers, was selected by the B a n k as i t s i n i t i a l 
focus state. 

3. 
A s i f t o underscore the g r ow i n g impo r tance o f states in ca r ry ing f o rw a r d economic 
re fo rms in India, the decade o f the 1990s closed with a serious f isca l c r is is a f fec t ing the vast 
m a j o r i t y o f states. The increased cost o f f isca l ly irresponsible p o p u l i sm h a d l e d t o steady 
deterioration in state finances ove r the decade, and the large p a y h i k e f o l l o w i n g the cen t ra l 
Fifth Pay Comm iss ion award announced in 1999 was the las t straw. The Gove rnmen t o f 
I n d i a (GoI) faced increasing p ressu re f r o m states f o r special ba i l -ou t packages. Go1 sought 
the Bank's he lp in res to r ing state f isca l responsibility, Le., in i n d u c i n g them to accept and 
abide by a hard budget constraint in exchange f o r qu ick -d isbu rs ing and r e l a t i v e l y cheap 
financing. The context was thus created f o r re fo rm - l inked budget support operations t o 
q u a l i f y i n g states, consistent with the state focus approach o f t h e CAS . 

Historical Overview 
3. 
Be tween 1998 and 2008, the Bank p r o v i d e d about US$2.5 b i l l i o n in budge t support 
th rough 11 operations in six States (Andh ra Pradesh, Bihar, H im a c h a l Pradesh, Karnataka, 
Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh) (see table A7.1). T w o operations to ta l ing US $ 4 5 0 m i l l i o n we re 
dropped in two states (Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), after s ign i f ican t p repa ra t ion efforts. The 
2004 C A S ind ica ted that state D P L s shou ld n o t n o rm a l l y exceed 15% o f annua l lending and 
that there w o u l d be tw o such operations in a given year. 

23 T h e o n l y n a t i o n a l S A L (in 1991) h e l p e d I n d i a unde r take exchange ra te ad jus tmen ts a n d indus t r ia l , trade 
and f inanc ia l sector l ibe ra l iza t ion . 

I n d i a Coun t ry Strategy A n n e x 7, Page 2 o f 7 

4. 
A l though Andh ra Pradesh was the f i r s t focus state, i t was n o t the f i r s t rec ip ien t o f 
Sub-National Ad jus tmen t Lending (SAL), as this ins t rumen t was n o t yet ava i lab le in 1998. 
So the f i r s t attempt at p o l i c y based lend ing t o an I n d i a n state was a US$450 mu l t i -sec to r 
investment project, the Andh ra Pradesh Econom ic Res t ruc tu r ing P ro jec t (APEFU?), approved 
in 1998, w h i c h was underpinned by an agreed multi-year f isca l f iamewo rk . This was 
f o l l ow e d by the f i rs t SAL, the U t t a r Pradesh F isca l R e f o rm and P u b l i c Sector Res t ruc tu r ing 
L o a d c r e d i t o f US$250 m i l l i o n , approved in April 2000. The third state t o become a ‘focus 
state’ was Karnataka in 2001. 

5. 

UP ’S reforms, especially in the p ow e r sector, faltered in a context o f p o l i t i c a l 
ins tab i l i ty and sho r t - l ived coa l i t ion governments, and the state’s partnership w i th the Bank 
weakened. T am i l N a d u j o i n e d Andh ra and Ka rna taka as a focus state. The fact that by 
2002/03 the B a n k had as i t s m a i n focus in p o l i c y dialogue t h r e e states w h i c h we re b o t h 
re la t ive ly h igh - income and regarded as h a v i n g better prospects ep i tom ized a tens ion 
between supporting re fo rme rs and focus ing o n pove r ty reduction. There was g r ow i n g 
concern that lagg ing states were b e i n g ove r looked in the Bank’s focus.24 T h e 2001 C A S 
recognized this tension and addressed i t by i n i t i a t i n g a dialogue with Orissa, starting in 
2002, w h i c h u l t ima te ly led t o t w o SALLDPL operations, in 2004 and 2006 respectively. 

6. 
The 2004 C A S proposed a change o f approach f r o m the ‘focus states’ strategy t o a 
broader focus o n the twe lve la rges t and poorest states. I t stated: “Though the B a n k G r o u p 
strategy w i l l re ta in an essentially reform- andperformance-based app roach t o the states, it 
w i l l also change in ways tha t a re intended to g o as fa r as poss ib le i n opening u p new 
engagements w i t h these largest and poorest states. I t M o r e resources were envisaged f o r the 
fou r poo r states o f Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh. 

7 . 

The en t ry o f Bihar i n t o the set o f states rece iv ing DPLs was a development o f great 
significance. F o r many decades, B i h a r h a d ep i tom ized poo r governance, caste-based 
po l i t ics , poo r l aw and order and the absence o f development f i o m the p o l i t i c a l agenda. This 
changed in 2005 with the e lec t ion o f a n ew coa l i t ion and p o l i t i c a l leadership s t rong ly 
comm i t ted t o a developmental agenda. With Bihar and Orissa emerging as t h e m a i n DPL 
states, the Bank’s comm i tmen t t o supporting re fo rms in low - income states appears t o be o n 
track. Renewed dialogue with UP around a possible DPL f o l l ow i n g the 2007 e lec t ion o f the 
state’s f i r s t stable m a j o r i t y government in over a decade po in ts t o a possible further 
expansion o f D P L engagement in low - income states. 

8. 

The D P L t o H im a c h a l Pradesh (HP) in FY08 represented an exception t o the trend o f 
focusing DPLs o n the lagg ing states. HP i s mo re prosperous than the average and has 
s ign i f ican t ly better-than-average human development indicators. The m a i n ra t iona le f o r th is 
exception was the fact that HP was the f i r s t state t o comm i t t o develop a comprehensive 
state-wide environmental ac t ion plan, and the Government o f I n d i a expressed strong interest 
in a D P L operation t o this state, in the hope that i t cou ld s e r v e as an example f o r other 
mountainous, less developed states a long Ind ia ’s border regions. 

24 

This was o f ten r e f e r r e d to as t h e “What about B iha r? ” question.

Resu l ts and E f fec t iveness 
9. 

An analysis o f f isca l outcomes suggests that, since 2000, DPL states h a d o n average 
better f isca l performance and made mo re progress in reduc ing p ow e r losses than other states 
(see f igu re A7.1). T h e n o n -DP L states also started t o adjust, albeit with a lag. A v is ib le 
concrete impac t o f DPLs was that “reform champions w i t h i n a state found the add i t iona l 
pressure of meeting milestones agreed w i t h the Bank useful f o r ove rcom ing p o l i t i c a l or 
bu reauc ra t ic resistance t o reforms. ... A n d i n a chao t ic democracy whe re there a r e any 
number of <reform d is t rac t ions ’ (scandals, n a t u r a l disasters, p o l i t i c a l challenges), th is was 
a va luab le 

10. 

D P L s b rough t about other benefits in add i t ion to f isca l co r rec t ion and reduc t ion in 
powe r sector losses, but these are harder t o quantify. The DPL states we re frontrunners in a 
numbe r o f r e f o rm areas, with s ign i f ican t demonstration e f fec t o n a l l states. F o r instance, 
Andh ra Pradesh was the f i rs t t o in t roduce a s ing le -w indow clearance system f o r n ew 
investments, w h i c h was then emulated by many . Ka rna taka was the f i rs t state t o enact a 
F isca l Respons ib i l i ty law, f o l l ow e d by Go1 and other states. B i h a r has taken p ionee r ing 
in i t ia t ives in p o l i c e r e f o rm and in teacher management.

Am o n g the low - income states, the B a n k has h a d t h e longest D P L engagement in 
Orissa, with s ign i f ican t v is ib le impact. Orissa has achieved the mos t remarkable f isca l 
co r rec t ion o f a l l Indian states since 2000, starting f r o m an acute c r is is situation. I t has also 
achieved faster comp le t ion o f investment projects th rough im p r o v e d p r i o r i t i z a t i o n within a 
constrained cap i ta l budget during the f isca l co r rec t ion pe r iod . I t i s the mos t v i s i b l y active 
state in terms o f an t i -co r rup t ion actions and has r i s e n t o the f i r s t p o s i t i o n in terms o f p r iva te 
investments under imp lemen ta t ion . Lessons f r o m t h e experience in Orissa highlight the 
importance of: (i) patience and persistence f o r the WB t o serve as a re l iab le partner th rough 
d i f f i c u l t t im e s building o n a base o f strong ana ly t ica l wo rk , (ii) consistency in ma in ta in ing 
f isca l targets, (iii) a consultative approach as taken by the Orissa authorities in exp la in ing 
the f isca l crisis t o the p u b l i c t o build consensus around the necessary adjustments, and (iv) 
as no ted in the IEG I C R assessment, comp lemen t ing the f isca l ob jec t ive with other 
investments and ac t iv i t ies addressing the state’s k e y developmental challenges. 

Strategic Importance o f DPLs 

12. 
The share o f state-level DPLs in to ta l WB lend ing t o I n d i a has b e e n quite small- 
l e s s than 6%. The D P L s have, however, h a d a strategic impo r tance in terms o f fou r m a i n 
aspects: (a) they enhanced state-level cross-cutting engagement in p o l i c y making and 
re fo rms across a b road front, i n v o l v i n g engagement across state government departments 
and across WB sectors; (b) they supported state-wide cross-cutting re fo rms ( f isca l po l icy , 
f isca l respons ib i l i ty and f inanc ia l management, p u b l i c procurement, government efficiency, 
accountability, transparency and anti-corruption) and accompany ing sector p o l i c y re fo rms 
(d i f fe ren t in each state, but i n c l u d i n g re fo rms in inves tmen t climate, education, health, 
agriculture, social safety nets, power, roads, etc.); (c) they enhanced AAA, TA f o r capac i ty 
building, and investment lend ing as the p o l i c y and governance environment imp roved ; and 
(d) they stimulated partnership with other donors, such as DFID and ADB. 

13. 

F r o m the v iewpo in t o f t h e central government, DPLs strengthen the Centre’s own 
efforts t o induce f isca l ly responsible behav io r and im p r o v e d governance in the states. The 
p r im a r y i n t e r e s t o f the Ministry o f Finance i s t o ensure that states t a k e the i r comm i tmen t t o 
f isca l respons ib i l i ty seriously; but Go1 i s also interested in m o r e states emba rk ing o n re fo rms 
t o imp rove the effectiveness o f expenditures and enhance service delivery in those areas 
w h i c h a re state responsibilities, thereby im p r o v i n g development outcomes (and reduc ing the 
need f o r central outlays th rough related CSSs). 

Government o f India Guidelines 

14. 
The Go1 has an established process gove rn ing a l l state-level DPLs, and approves the 
i n i t i a l request and the au tho r iza t ion t o appraisal, in add i t ion t o pa r t ic ipa t ing in negotiations. 
The designated counterpart department f o r a l l DPLs i s the Depa r tmen t o f Expenditure (DOE) 
within the M i n i s t r y o f Finance. In October 2005, the G oUD oE established new guidelines 
f o r states wishing t o a v a i l o f SALS / DPLs, supplementing earlier guidelines that were issued 
in December 2002 and taking i n t o account the context o f the recommendations o f the 
Tw e l f t h Finance Comm iss ion (see table A7.2). The b igges t changes were: (a) an e x p l i c i t l y 
de f in i t ion o f the f isca l targets (zero revenue de f ic i t and 3% f isca l d e f i c i t by 2008-09), and 
the in t roduc t ion o f multiple tranches as a d e s i g n requirement so that states have t o 

Ind ia Country Strategy Annex 7 , Page 5 o f 7 

demonstrate sustained f isca l imp rovemen t t o q u a l i f y f o r the full amount o f the loan; (b) 
requ i r ing enactment o f F isca l Respons ib i l i ty and Budget Management (FRBM) A c t s in 
states and f o rm a l letters o f comm i tmen t and milestones; and (c) at the same time, p r o v i d i n g 
greater flexibility and ownership by states o f the i r other r e f o rm directions and paths. 

15. W h i l e the 2005 Guidelines o f Go1 remain largely relevant and appropriate, some 
rev is ions m a y b e required in the n e x t phase o f DPL engagement. First, the guidelines 
requ i re states t o use a la rge part (in practice over 50%) o f DPL finds to re t i re old expensive 
debt through debt swaps. There i s n o t m u c h old expensive debt l e f t o n the books o f state 
governments, except fo r the N a t i o n a l Sma l l Savings Fund l iab i l i t ies , w h i c h Go1 i s n o t 
willing t o swap. In the fu tu re , Go1 w i l l need t o a l l ow states t o use DPL financing as a 
substitute fo r other sources o f d e f i c i t financing. Second, the requirement o f m u l t i p l e 
t ranch ing m a y also merit reconsideration in cases where a t rack reco rd o f r e f o rm has been 
established and where single-tranche operations m a y be m o r e appropriate g i v e n 
considerations o f p o l i t i c a l economy o r r e f o rm sequencing. 

Future Challenges 
16. W h i l e the f isca l s tress fac ing Indian states eased considerably during 2000-2008, the 
year 2008/09 begun with several r isks looming, i n c l u d i n g rising f i e 1 and f o o d subsidy bills, 
the impac t o f the Sixth Pay Comm iss ion award o n state salary bills, and a s l ow i n g d o w n o f 
GDP g r ow t h and hence tax revenues. This suggests that Go1 w i l l continue t o we lcome Bank 
assistance t o help states rema in o n a f isca l ly sustainable p a t h w h i l e pursuing the i r 
development objectives. The demand f o r DPLs w i l l likely r em a i n strong during 2008-12. 

17. 
Experience during the 2004 C A S pe r iod con f i rms that DPLs are one o f the W B ’ s 
primary i n s t r um e n t s t o engage with p o o r states. The lessons learned f r o m the p o s i t i v e 
the progressing dialogue in UP, and the p rob lems 
experience in Orissa and Bihar, 
encountered in HP are the fo l low ing : (i) designing D P L s with strong c l ien t ownership takes 
time, especially so in the poorer states with weak capacity; (ii) the electoral cyc le and 
government s tab i l i ty are impo r tan t : DPL discussions shou ld begin early in the tenure o f a 
government and should b e broadly based in states with c o a l i t i o n governments; (iii) c l ien t 
efforts t o accelerate preparation need t o be channeled toward demonstrating c red i tab le 
comm i tmen t and building a r e f o rm t rack record; (iv) DPLs shou ld be pursued in the con tex t 
o f a state strategy w h i c h uses the full range o f WB instruments t o help tackle the k e y 
development challenges fac ing the state. 

18. DPLs are complementary t o GoI’s in i t ia t ives in p r om o t i n g state-level re fo rms 
th rough na t iona l schemes that p r o v i d e f inanc ia l support t o states f o r p re - iden t i f ied p o l i c y 
and ins t i tu t iona l reforms. This suggests that the re m a y b e scope f o r the Bank and G o 1 t o 
w o r k together to: (a) focus o n lagg ing o r weak-capacity states t o support the i r capacity t o 
u t i l i z e m o r e e f fec t ive ly the re fo rm - l inked centrally sponsored schemes; and (b) support 
broader re fo rms o f such schemes at the na t iona l o r state levels, u s i n g sectoral DPLs. The 
Statistical Strengthening p ro jec t developed toward the end o f the 2004 C A S pe r iod and s t i l l 
under consideration by Go1 i s the f i rs t proposed Sector DPL in I n d i a and c o u l d tes t the

2005 DPL Guidelines 

N ow referred explicitly to the 12" Finance 
Commission (TFC) proposals and achievement o f 
a zero revenue deficit and a 3% fiscal deficit by 
2008-09 
States are required to enact a Fiscal 
Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) 
Ac t as a condition for accessing DPLs, using 
2005-05 levels as starting bases and fiscal 
correction path from that base 
States furnish: (a) a Letter o f Commitment w i th 
fiscal correction path and outcome indicators and 
milestones; and (b) Submits a Concept Note on 
the proposal. 

(a) established a definition o f 
debt-stressed states as 
consolidated debt and 
liabilities to total revenues 
that exceeded 300%; 200% 
for special category states; 
and @) stipulated that any 
external borrowing proposals 
from debt-stressed states 
would require concurrence o f 
DOE. 

(a) following TFC recommendations, revised the 
debt-stress t e s t to define the threshold as in te res t 
payments to revenue receipts ratio that exceeded 
20%; and (b) continued the general guidance that 
debt-stressed states would need the concurrence 
o f DOE (with some guidelines for approval) for 
external borrowings, including DPLs. As long as 
state borrowing within overall borrowing ceiling, 
DOE would have no objection; i f in excess, 
examined on case-by-case basis and DOE would 
discourage any such borrowing b y debt-stressed 
state.

BIHAR 

With a popu la t ion o f 83 m i l l i o n , Bihar i s India’s third mos t popu lous state. I t i s also one o f 
India’s poorest states, with one in seven o f the nation’s p o o r res id ing in Bihar and about 
41.4% o f the state’s popu la t ion in pove r ty compared t o 27.5% f o r all-India. Ave rage state 
per capita income in Bihar i s Rs. 8,838, w h i c h i s about a quarter o f the a l l - Ind ia level. 
Bihar’s social ind ica to rs are amongst the lowes t in Indian states, and at present trends i t w i l l 
attain o n l y t w o o f the eight MDG targets by 2015 ( reduc t ion in c h i l d m a l n u t r i t i o n and access 
t o safe drinking water). 

Since Novembe r 2005, t h e Government o f B i h a r (GOB) has undertaken a comprehensive set 
o f re fo rms a imed at growth, governance and f isca l adjustment. The m a i n sectors covered 
have inc luded p u b l i c expenditure management; infrastructure, especially roads; changes in 
the hea l th de l ive ry system; decentralization o f adm in is t ra t ion and devo lu t ion o f powe r t o 
l o c a l government; techn ica l and ins t i tu t iona l fillip t o agriculture, and education. The Bank 
has been supporting these th rough a broad-based re la t ionsh ip encompassing techn ica l 
assistance, investment lending and a DPL. The Bihar R u r a l L i v e l i h o o d p ro jec t (US$63 
m i l l i o n ) was approved in June 2007 and the f i rs t Bihar Deve lopmen t P o l i c y L o a n / C red i t 
(US$225 m) in December 2007. A mu l t i -sec to r capacity building techn ica l assistance 
p rog ram (approx $ 5 m i l l i o n , comp l imen ta ry t o the DPL) has begun implementation, and 
other areas o f techn ica l assistance inc lude p u b l i c expenditure management and f l o o d 
forecasting. Several na t iona l projects supported by the Bank a re cu r ren t ly b e i n g 
imp lemen ted in Bihar, i n c l u d i n g one - th i rd o f the Bank’s Lucknow -Muza f fa rpu r H i g hw a y 
p ro jec t (US$620 m). Altogether, B iha r ’s sha re in the Bank ’s t o t a l n e t comm i tmen ts in I n d i a 
i s about 6 percent. 

At the j o i n t South A s i a Retreat o f the W o r l d Bank, DFID, ADB and Japan in Novembe r 
2006, i t was agreed t o p i l o t a strategic partnership between donors in Bihar. Since then, the 
ADB, DFID, and the Bank have developed a j o i n t strategy f o r Bihar w h i c h was presented t o 
the Bihar C h i e f M i n s t e r in February 2008. This partnership has enabled the donors t o be t te r

L o o k i n g ahead, the Bank i s deve lop ing i t s strategy t o intensify and scale up i t s engagement 
with Bihar. Th is w i l l inc lude capacity building, scaled-up investment lending, as w e l l the

MADHYA PRADESH 

F o l l ow i n g the division o f the p rev ious M a d h y a Pradesh (MP) state i n t o a new MP and 
Chhattisgarh in 2000, the state n o w has an estimated popu la t ion o f about 6 0 m i l l i o n (Census 
2001). Estimates f r o m the 61“ r o u n d o f the N a t i o n a l Sample Survey ind ica te that in 
2004/05 about 38% o f the popu la t ion l i v e d b e l ow the na t iona l p o v e r t y line, making the state 
the fou r th in t e r m s o f numbe r o f poo r . Ag r icu l tu re accounts f o r 35% o f state GDP and ove r 
70% o f employment. M o r e than one - th i rd o f the popu la t ion belongs to soc ia l ly and 
econom ica l ly disadvantaged groups consisting o f scheduled tribes (20%) and scheduled 
castes (1 5%), amongst the highest such shares in Ind ia . The t r i b a l popu la t ion i s iso la ted in 
phys ica l t e r m s since i t l ives in forests and re l ies o n subsistence ag r icu l tu re and co l lec t ion 
and sale o f forest products. Pove r ty and human development outcomes f o r the t r i b a l 
popu la t ion are lowes t than f o r other groups in the state. The state also has high gender 
inequa l i ty as measured by access t o health, education and employment. On the pos i t ive 
side, in the last decade MP accelerated i t s push towards educational r e f o rm and the results 
are evident in the dramatic g r ow t h in l i te racy f r o m 44% in 19991 t o 64% in 2001, close t o 
the na t iona l average. A l t h o u g h gender disparities in l i te racy remain, these have na r rowed 
considerably during the decade. Serious bottlenecks r em a i n with rega rd t o hea l th sector 
outcomes, despite the state’s increased focus o n human development. 

With pove r ty reduc t ion and sustainable economic g r ow t h as i t s primary objectives, G o M P 
has also embarked o n far-reaching p o l i c y re fo rms in the p u b l i c sector, encompassing f isca l 
management, governance and decentralization, with support among others f r o m the P u b l i c

Resource Management Project p rov ided by the ADB. A l t h o u g h these re fo rms repo r ted ly 
have accelerated economic growth, i t remains b e l ow the na t iona l average. A w i d e n i n g 
d ispa r i ty between agriculture and non -ag r icu l tu re g r ow t h rates has pushed MP’s d u a l i t y 
index above the na t iona l average, suggesting that MP’s overarching ob jec t ive shou ld n o t be

Currently, the Bank has t w o active p ro jec ts in M a d h y a Pradesh focused o n putting in p lace

ORISSA 

Orissa, with a popu la t ion o f 38 m i l l i o n , i s one o f India’s poo re r states. O r i y a society i s

(compared t o 8% in Ind ia ) and 40% o f the p o o r in the state. The present Government, l e d

Orissa has stood ou t among Indian states in terms o f p rosecu t ing and conv ic t ing co r rup t

percent f o r I n d i a as a whole. R a p i d economic growth, spurred by investment in m e t a l 
industries, has had a m u l t i p l i e r effect throughout the economy. Oppo r tun i t ies f o r 
nonag r icu l tu ra l self-employment, as we l l as wage employment, have expanded. A 
remarkable f isca l turnaround, achieved th rough the state’s own e f fo r ts and complemented by 
perfonnance-linked support f r o m the cen t ra l government and external donors, has created 
space f o r developmental in i t ia t ives and h i g h - p r i o r i t y p u b l i c investments by the government

G oUP has succeeded in enhancing i t s investment and development budget s ign i f ican t ly , 
while at the same t im e reduc ing the ove ra l l f isca l de f ic i t . 
The qua l i ty o f p u b l i c spending, however, rema ins p o o r and b e l ow the average f o r other

ANNEX 9 : WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE W I T H CENTRALLY SPONSORED SCHEMES 

1. 

Cen t ra l ly sponsored schemes (CSSs) have been in place f o r several decades in 
Ind ia . They arose as a mechanism by w h i c h the central authorities c o u l d support pa r t icu la r 
programs in sectors w h i c h we re cons t i tu t iona l ly under state respons ib i l i ty . The schemes 
have evo lved with a wide variety o f fo rms depending o n the pa r t icu la r objectives and 
ins t i tu t ions invo lved . T y p i c a l l y the schemes i n v o l v e disbursement o f resources f r o m t h e 
central budget t o various imp lemen t ing agencies at the state o r l ow e r l e v e l s . The Centre i s 
n o t t y p i c a l l y i n v o l v e d in imp lemen ta t ion w h i c h therefore m a y v a r y w i d e l y f r o m state t o 
state even within u n i f o rm parame ters . In many cases even the f l o w o f resources m a y 
bypass state f isca l mechanisms th rough the u s e o f o f f -budge t societies w h i c h rece ive the 
central finds and disburse t o imp lemen t ing agencies. 

2. 

The W o r l d B a n k has b e e n engaged with CSSs f o r a l o n g time. Howeve r , o n l y with 
the r a p i d expansion o f such schemes during the Ten th P l a n p e r i o d and the i r association with 
some o f the k e y MDGs did the CSSs ga in p rom inence in the WB p rog ram as a k e y 
ins t rumen t t o scale up impact. During the p e r i o d o f the 2004 C A S some 28 operations were 
l i n k e d in some w a y t o CSSs (table A9.1). 

3. 

1. 

In order t o assess WB experience with CSSs as an ins t rumen t t o scale up impac t i t 
i s use fu l t o recognize at least three d i f fe ren t t y p e s o f WB support t o CSSs: 
The WB m a y engage with direct budget support t o the central ministry o r agency 
sponsoring the scheme, w h i c h m a y either cover an en t i re subsector in a l l states such 
as primary education o r a na t iona l ve r t ica l p rog ram such as TB con t ro l . In these 
cases the WB accepts the parameters o f the scheme as app l ied across a l l 
pa r t ic ipa t ing states and m a y e i the r j o i n an on -go ing scheme (such as SSA1) o n 
w h i c h the WB w i l l have l im i t e d influence, at least in i t ia l ly , o r m a y w o r k with the 
central sponsor o f the scheme t o help fo rmu la te the parameters o f the scheme (such 
as S S A 2 ) . In e i the r case the WB f o l l ow s a u n i f o rm approach t o f inanc ia l 
management, procurement and m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation across states; howeve r in 
imp lemen t ing th is u n i f o rm approach, the WB m a y o r m a y n o t use coun t ry systems 
(or state sys tems i f procurement i s done at the state o r l o c a l level). The WB m a y 
also p o o l i t s support with other partners in a SWAP - type ope ra t ion (SSA1 and 2). 
(WB operations f o l l ow i n g this type o f engagement a re listed in t h e f i r s t section o f 
table A9.1.) 
The WB m a y support a CSS o n l y in ce r ta in states o r finance o n l y a specific se t o f 
investments. I f the WB limits i t s support t o pa r t icu la r states i t m a y p r o v i d e support 
t o the CSS counterpart funds i f those are requ i red f r om the state. The f inanc ia l 
management and procurement arrangements are generally “ring-fenced” 
in these 
operations but the re i s a u n i f o rm approach across the who le scheme. Support t o 
r u r a l roads i s an example o f this type o f engagement (operations o f this type are 
l is ted in the second section o f the table). 
F i n a l l y the WB m a y also support a CSS th rough i n d i v i d u a l state operations tha t run 
pa ra l le l t o the CSS but are n o t f o rm a l l y part o f i t . In these cases the WB m a y 
r e q u i r e add i t iona l actions at the state l e v e l o r o n l y finance states w h i c h agree to

India Country Strategy Annex 9, Page 2 o f 4 

f o l l ow the guidelines that the WB has i d e n t i f i e d f o r engagement in the sector. In 
these cases f inanc ia l management and procurement are ‘ring-fenced’ and f o l l o w WB 
procedures. The r u r a l wa te r supply and sanitation (RWSS) operations are t y p i c a l o f 
this approach (third section o f the table). 

4. 

M o s t WE3 operations suppo r t ing CSSs have f o l l ow e d the f i r s t mode l , p r o v i d i n g 
support t o na t iona l schemes, usua l ly f o l l ow i n g WE3 procurement guidelines. Support t o SSA 
has b e e n exceptional in i t s use o f coun t ry systems under a SWAP . A l t h o u g h this remains 
the goal, the findings o f the DIR, w h i c h re fe r red t o several operations suppo r t ing CSSs in 
the hea l th sector, have resu l ted in the WB tak ing a m u c h m o r e res t r ic t ive v i e w o f central- 
l e v e l engagement in CSSs with co r respond ing ly greater emphasis o n t h e robustness o f 
f inanc ia l management, procurement, and p ro jec t management capacity at the state level, 
w h i c h w o u l d suggest fu tu re CSS invo lvemen t m a y b e m o r e o f the second o r third type . A 
state-by-state approach as in the D i s t r i c t P r ima ry Educa t ion p ro jec ts o r R W S S a l lows the 
WE3 t o f o l l ow f iduc ia ry systems m o r e easily but at the cost o f reduced leverage in 
con t r ibu t ing t o the p o l i c y parameters o f the CSS and therefore t o impact. 

5 . 

CSSs also suffer f r o m p o o r M&E frameworks. The cen t ra l government has so far 
m a i n l y tracked disbursements f r o m the central budget t o a state o r d is t r ic t - leve l entity, w i th 
limited systems t o track h o w the m o n e y i s being spent and t o m o n i t o r outputs at the p o i n t o f 
service de l ive ry and, with a few exceptions, ve ry l i t t l e attention t o intended outcomes. T h i s 
lack o f a results culture has emerged as a s ign i f ican t sho r tcom ing as the resources devoted 
t o CSSs have mushroomed. One consequence has been l i t t l e feedback i n t o des ign 
mod i f ica t ion o r improvements in resource a l loca t ion during imp lemen ta t ion . T h e p o l i t i c a l 
economy o f CSSs i s l i n k e d t o spending and pays scant attention t o the incen t ives w h i c h the 
scheme either creates o r i s in tended t o change. A recent exception i s the N a t i o n a l R u r a l 
Emp loymen t Guarantee Scheme f o r w h i c h Go1 requested WE3 support in se t t ing up a robus t 
M&E with top in te rna t iona l expertise (this has been supported as part o f the W B ’ s AAA 
p rog ram and therefore i s n o t covered in the table). Howeve r , delays l i n k e d b o t h t o the 
conceptual f ramewo rk f o r evaluation and access t o data have severely h inde red this ac t iv i ty . 

6. 

Ano the r key issue a f fec t ing the capacity t o scale up impac t th rough CSSs i s 
sustainability. CSSs usua l ly have h a d their o r i g i n in the desire at the cen t ra l l e v e l t o 
p romo te a specific ob jec t ive by augmenting the resources o f the states. W h e n th is goa l has 
a we l l -de f ined de l ive ry mechanism and c lea r ly measurable target (e.g. e rad ica t ing TB o r 
po l io ) there has b e e n considerable success, in part because once the target i s achieved there 
i s l i t t l e mo re that the state needs t o do. But other goals (e.g. im p r o v e d ea r ly c h i l d n u t r i t i o n 
o r de l ive r ing p r im a r y hea l th care) are m u c h mo re comp l ica ted with s ign i f ican t recu r r ing 
responsibilities at the state leve l . In such instances the incentives generated by CSSs have 
perversely resulted in the states abdicating respons ib i l i t ies in those areas cove red by the 
CSSs and concentrating the i r resources elsewhere (o f ten in areas o f l ow e r impact, e.g. 
d is t r ic t o r state hospitals). As a resu l t the f inanc ia l sustainability o f the a c t i v i t y continues t o 
depend on central allocations. This b i fu rca t ion o f funding sources also reduces the 
l i k e l i h o o d that any en t i ty w i l l develop a comprehensive and integrated ove rv iew o f 
programs and activities in the sector, w h i c h fiuther erodes sustainability. 

India Country Strategy Annex 9 , Page 3 o f 4 

7 . 

A key d imens ion o f sustainability in t e r m s o f impac t i s the effect o f CSSs on 
capacities and respons ib i l i t ies across levels o f government. In theo ry the p r o v i s i o n o f 
add i t iona l resources t o l ow e r leve ls o f government shou ld im p r o v e t h e capacity t o de l ive r 
services; but in practice CSSs have come t o rely on agencies outside t h e o f f i c i a l ins t i tu t ions 
charged with imp lemen ta t ion at the state and l o c a l leve l . CSS funds are o f ten disbursed 
th rough special societies w h i c h bypass state and l o c a l f isca l agencies. Further the 
b i h r c a t i o n o f sector respons ib i l i t ies (primary hea l th vs. hospitals) means that l o c a l 
ins t i tu t ions w h i c h should b e deve lop ing an integrated approach t o key challenges (ach iev ing 
an MDG, f o r example) are n o t able t o do so. 

8 . 

These considerations suggest that the WB c r i t i c a l l y assess i t s future engagement 
with CSSs ex ante t o ensure that the f o l l ow i n g factors a re adequately addressed: 
a results cha in f o r the CSS with clear linkages be tween inputs, outputs and 
outcomes (service delivery goals), 
a governance and accoun tab i l i ty f ramewo rk w h i c h inc ludes measures t o f o l l ow the 
money and v e r i f y outputs, consistent with a risk-based approach t o WB 
imp lemen ta t ion support, 
adequately funded M&E t o mark progress t ow a r d outcomes, 
des ign flexibility t o ensure responsiveness t o l o c a l cond i t ions and evo lv ing 
circumstances, 
imp lemen ta t ion structures and arrangements w h i c h support 
Ind ia ’s on -go ing 
decentralization recogn iz ing that multiple CSSs converge at the d is t r ic t l e v e l 
resulting in a s ign i f ican t ins t i tu t iona l burden.

Key Portfolio D a t a . I n d i a remains the largest IDA bene f ic ia ry and the third-largest 
IBRD bo r rowe r o f the B a n k Group. The to ta l ne t comm i tmen ts at end-June 2008 stood at 
around $13.8 b i l l i o n ( o f w h i c h IBRD was $8.2 b i l l i o n and IDA $5.5 b i l l i o n ) and the un- 
disbursed balance at about $9.2 b i l l i o n (IBRD $5.3 bln and IDA $3.9 bln). Currently, 18 
projects, o r almost a third o f the po r t fo l io , with a comb ined n e t comm i tmen t o f around $3.5 
b i l l ion , o r 25% o f the to ta l po r t fo l io , a re m o r e than f i v e years o ld . Twelve p ro jec ts 
( inc lud ing a D P L ) closed in FY08 , three with unsatisfactory development outcomes and/or 
imp lemen ta t ion progress. F o r investment lending projects, the average age at c los ing was 
7.3 years and t e n ou t o f eleven projects h a d at least one extension t o the o r ig ina l c los ing 
date. By sector, sustainable development (comp r is ing the agriculture/rural, energy, 
environment/social, r u r a l water, transport, and urban sub-sectors) has the largest share o f 
the p o r t f o l i o with 44 projects amoun t ing t o US$6.9 b i l l i o n , o r 50% o f to ta l n e t 
commitments. H um a n Deve lopmen t i s the second-largest sector in the p o r t f o l i o (1 1 p ro jec ts 
w i th 17% o f to ta l n e t commitments), f o l l ow e d by Finance (two projects; 5%) and P R E M 
(three projects; 5%). By borrower, about 62% o f the Bank’s current p o r t f o l i o i s 
concentrated in 19 state-level operations. Pub l ic undertakings, cen t ra l ly sponsored schemes 
(CSSs) and f inanc ia l intermediaries account f o r the rema in ing 38% o f the po r t fo l io , 
e f fec t ive ly cove r ing a l l the states and u n i o n te r r i to r ies in Ind ia . 

2. 
Portfolio performance. With the downg rad ing o f p ro jec t ratings in a number o f 
cases, 
the percentage o f commitments-at-risk reached a five-year high o f 23% at the end o f 
FY08 , 
w e l l above the B a n k average o f 17%. This, together with a f ive -yea r l o w 
disbursement ra t io o f 18.3%, has raised concern. S l ow disbursement i s a cause o f concern 
in Ag r icu l tu re & R u r a l Development, Health, and Urban Deve lopmen t among subsectors 
and in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Ka rna taka among m a j o r b o r r ow i n g states. In 
addition, in sectors, states, o r entities that have otherwise pe r fo rmed well, some large 
projects (e.g. M u m b a i Urban Transport, R u r a l C red i t Cooperatives, Pun jab R u r a l Wa te r 
Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) and Uttarakhand RWSS ) have h a d a re la t ive ly s low t a k e - o f f 
in FY 0 8 . In terms o f riskiness, the percentage o f commitments-at-risk constitutes around a 
fou r th o f the to ta l ne t commitments in some sectors (e.g. RWSS, Transport, Hea l th ) and 
some states (e.g. Maharashtra, Tamil N a d u and Karnataka). Risk flags re la ted t o F inanc ia l

The Ind ia P rog ram has embarked on a numbe r o f actions t o fac i l i ta te imp rovemen ts 
in the ove ra l l effectiveness o f the p rog ram in mee t ing objectives, and t o begin t o address 
some o f the challenges h igh l igh ted above. These actions are also a imed at f o rm i n g 
reasonable responses t o the deeper and m o r e systemic issues raised in the DIR o f health 
operations. This set o f actions (known as the Imp rovemen t P rog ram (IPE)) also draws u p o n 
the observations and recommendations made in the recent IAD audit report, w h i c h 
examined e i g h t investment operations, as w e l l as ins t i tu t iona l analyses such as the IDA 14

a. Supervision. A number o f f o l l ow - u p actions a re b e i n g put in p lace t o fac i l i ta te 
improvements in supervision planning and practices, and encourage h ighe r levels o f 
e f fo r t . A s highlighted above, there has been a trend towa rds slower disbursement 
and longe r imp lemen ta t ion pe r iods with a concentration o f r isks in ce r ta in sectors 
and states. This ca l ls f o r a targeted approach that inc ludes actions such as: 
(i) ca r ry ing ou t a baseline r i s k assessments o f the en t i re po r t fo l io , using a risk 
me thodo logy that e x p l i c i t l y integrated r i s k s , i n c l u d i n g f raud and 
corruption, by state, sector and project; 
(ii) shifting m o r e resources t o implementation, i n c l u d i n g mo re support f o r the 

projects identified as high-risk projects, as required; 

(iii) f lagg ing persistent imp lemen ta t ion p rob lems and high-risk operations t o 
management, v i a p re -m iss ion and pos t -m iss ion meetings chaired by the 
Coun t ry D i rec to r ; 
(iv) p roac t ive ly f o l l ow i n g up o n m i t i g a t i o n actions i n c l u d i n g th rough 
res t ruc tu r ing and cancellations; and 
(v) strengthening o r deve lop ing GAAPs and other means t o i n s t i l l demand 
s ide accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms in ongo ing projects. 

In addition, the approach i s t o b e mo re p ro -ac t ive in an t ic ipa t ing changes, especially 
in the p o l i t i c a l economy, that m a y affect p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . This w i l l be done 
th rough greater use o f the Ex te rna l Commun ica t ions Team t o m o n i t o r ea r ly warning 
s i g n s . Other innova t ions are expected t o b e in t roduced t o bo ls te r economies o f scale 
and t o identify cross-cutting concerns that requ i re a systemic response by the Bank, 
such as selective expansion o f thematic supervision, either by sector (e.g. 
livelihoods, transport) o r cross-cutting theme (e.g. f inanc ia l management, 
environment, M&E, GAAP implementation). App rox ima te ly tw o thematic 
supervision m iss ions are p lanned t o b e undertaken each year. Ano the r t o o l that i s 
p lanned t o be in t roduced o n a p i l o t basis invo lves reviewing and adapting ce r ta in 
aspects o f supply-chain o r l i f e cyc le methodologies t o detect vu lne rab i l i t ies in

and im p r o v i n g the f l o w and d ive rs i ty o f i n f o rm a t i o n rega rd ing imp lemen ta t ion

basis in ce r ta in sector po r t fo l ios . SASSD, with the largest p o r t f o l i o o f p ro jec ts 
under implementation, has already adopted such guidelines t o enhance supervision 
planning. One o f the k e y changes made thus far in this r e a lm i s the use o f “red 
flags” t o detect anomalies in procurement processes. 

b. C la r i f i ing roles and responsibilities of Sector Managers (SMs) and Lead Specialists
