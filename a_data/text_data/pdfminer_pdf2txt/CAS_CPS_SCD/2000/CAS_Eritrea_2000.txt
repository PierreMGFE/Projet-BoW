INTERIM SUPPORT STRATEGY FOR
THE STATE OF ERITREA

1. 

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This document sets out an Interim Support Strategy for Bank assistance to Eritrea
as part of a multi-donor effort to assist Eritrea in addressing its most immediate needs in
the face of a serious humanitarian and economic crisis. The massive population
displacement and destruction of property resulting from the last round of fighting has
prompted a significant shift in new development assistance towards urgent humanitarian
and reconstruction interventions. Bank assistance therefore focuses on emergency
reconstruction and health. Subsequently, a Transitional Support Strategy will be
prepared to elaborate on the Bank's medium-term strategic response. During the coming
months, Government will also prepare an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(I-PRSP) outlining its long-term development strategy, which will serve to underpin the
Transitional Support Strategy.

2. 
The Board has been briefed several times on the Eritrea-Ethiopia conflict. At the
most recent briefing on July 18, 2000, the Board was apprised that Eritrea and Ethiopia
had signed a Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in June 2000, an important step towards
ending two years of conflict which erupted in May 1998 as a border dispute. It is
encouraging to note that the agreement signed in June 2000 is holding, and that the
leaders of both Eritrea and Ethiopia reaffirmed their commitment to finding a lasting
solution to the conflict at the recent UN-sponsored Millennium Summit in New York. At
the July 18 briefing, it was agreed that the Bank would prepare an Interim Support
Strategy for Eritrea to accompany the Emergency Reconstruction Credit for Board
discussion. Although the situation remains fragile, Bank management feels the time is
right to move forward with emergency assistance. A strong effort by the international
community will support and reinforce the peace process, particularly as peace talks
resume on October 23, 2000.

2. 

COUNTRY BACKGROUND

3. 
Eritrea is a coastal country of about 118 thousand square kilometers in the Horn
of Africa, bordered by the Red Sea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Djibouti. It has a population of
about 4 million and a gross national product of about US$200 per capita.

4. 
Eritrea became formally independent following an internationally supervised
referendum in April 1993, two years after the Eritrean People's Liberation Front assumed
control of the country following a thirty-year struggle for independence. The new
Government pursued policies, strategies and investments to dismantle the dirigiste
economic policies of the former regime and promote rapid, widely-shared economic
growth. It limited its own role mainly to creating an enabling policy environment and

1

investing in infrastructure and strategic industries in which the private sector had neither
capacity nor interest. It adopted an investment code that opened up the entire economy to
private 
investors, and acted 
to 
rehabilitate, upgrade and expand 
transport,
communications, power, and water supply facilities; improve the capacity of government
and development institutions in health, finance, education; and restore the productive
capacity of the economy, particularly in agriculture and fisheries, tourism, construction,
mining and manufacturing.

5. 
Real progress was made in all sectors of the economy. Transport and
communication services were restored and expanded. Markets for labor, capital and
products started functioning more efficiently. Broad-based fiscal, monetary, and trade
policy regimes aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, mobilizing government
revenue, and facilitating efficient allocation and utilization of resources were established.

6. 
By early 1998 most of the transition issues had been successfully addressed,
investor confidence was beginning to grow and private investment in a number of sectors
was increasing. The economy was growing at an annual average rate of 7 percent, among
the highest in Africa. The fiscal deficit (including grants), which had increased sharply to
22 percent of GDP in 1995, declined to 20 percent in 1996 and to 6 percent in 1997.
Inflation declined from about 11 percent in 1995 to about 9 percent in 1996 and to about
one percent in 1997 as the Government cut spending to build up intemational reserves to
prepare for the introduction of its new currency, the Eritrean Nakfa (ERN). Foreign
reserves reached over five months of imports of goods and services and income payments
in 1997.

3. 

POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE

7. 
Since liberation, the country has been ruled by the Provisional Government of
Eritrea, formed by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (which changed its name to the
People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) in 1993), and led by President Isaias
Afwerki. There is a National Assembly made up of the 75 members of the Central
Council of the PFDJ, 60 zoba or regional representatives and 15 representatives of
Eritreans living abroad. The National Assembly is not a full-time body but meets when
called into session.

8. 
A Constitutional Commission was established in 1994. It embarked upon an
elaborate process of popular consultation and drafting of a Constitution. The draft
Constitution was ratified by a Constituent Assembly in May 1997. Because of the
outbreak of the conflict with Ethiopia, the general elections expected to be held under the
new Constitution have not yet taken place. At its thirteenth session in September 2000,
the National Assembly decided to hold parliamentary elections in December 2001. The
laws governing multi-party elections will be promulgated in early 2001.

9. 
The Govemment has demonstrated real ownership of development programs,
based on Eritrean authorship of its strategy and programs. Despite the need for
government officials to devote most of their time to resolving the conflict and dealing

2

with the problems it caused, Government has successfully managed to implement most of
its development programs during the past two years. Another notable feature of
governance in Eritrea is the Government's zero tolerance of bribery and corruption.
Although Eritrea has not yet established a system for ex-ante review and approval of the
annual budget by the National Assembly, there is a strong culture of financial discipline
within Government. The budget for 2001 is under preparation, and will be presented to
the National Assembly.

4. 

DEVELOPMENTS DURING 1998-2000: THE WAR WITH ETHIOPIA AND DROUGHT
CREATE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

War With Ethiopia

10. Unfortunately, Eritrea's initial promising growth was disrupted by the outbreak of
a border conflict with Ethiopia in May 1998 which quickly escalated into war in several
border areas. While little fighting took place from June 1998 to January 1999, Ethiopia
expelled some 70,000 Eritreans or Ethiopians of Eritrean descent from its territory. In
addition, civilians close to the border area were obliged to relocate because of the
potential risks involved.

11. On May 12, 2000 there was a major escalation in the fighting on several fronts,
resulting in Ethiopian troops advancing into the Eritrean regions of Gash Barka and
Debub. This created a major humanitarian crisis, as about 750,000 people (80 percent
women and children) fled their homes. This brought the total number of internally
displaced people to 1.1 million.

12. On June 18, 2000, the parties signed a Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and
agreed to resume talks on the basis of the existing OAU Peace Framework Agreement.
The agreement calls for the withdrawal of the Ethiopian army from Eritrean territory and
the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force along a 25 kilometer buffer zone
inside Eritrea until the UN can demarcate the border. On July 31, 2000 the United
Nations Security Council authorized the establishment of a UN Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE). During August through October, the UN deployed liaison officers in
each capital city and 100 UN military observers who will maintain contact with military
headquarters in each country and the field units. On September 15, 2000, the UN
Security Council authorized the deployment of a peacekeeping force of up to 4,200
personnel. 
It is expected that the peacekeeping mission will be fully deployed by
December 2000.

13. 
The 36th Ordinary Session of OAU Heads of State and Government, held in
Lome, July 10-12, 2000, called for Ethiopia and Eritrea to negotiate the outstanding
issues to achieve lasting peace. The OAU Summit gave the President of Algeria the
mandate to continue the peace negotiations. These negotiations, centering on the issues
of delimitation and demarcation of the border and compensation, are expected to resume
in Algiers on October 23. The Governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia are cooperating with
the OAU, the UN and the President of Algeria to find a lasting solution to the conflict.

3

Drought

14. 
Eritrea is also suffering its worst drought in many years. There has been little or
no rain for the past three years in the Anseba, Northern Red Sea and Southern Red Sea
areas, which produce about 24 percent of the nation's annual grain output. The poor
rains of the 1999 winter resulted in widespread crop failure. About 335,000 people
require assistance in obtaining basic food supplies adding to the already overwhelming
burden on the Government. Although widespread famine and disease outbreaks have not
yet occurred, partly owing to government efforts to mitigate the adverse impact by
supplying food and other assistance, there is a growing concern that the situation will
deteriorate in the coming months.

5. 

HUMAN AND ECONOMIC 

IMPACT OF THE CONFLICT

Human and Social Impacts

15. 
The conflict has had devastating social and economic impacts in Eritrea. Some
1.1 million people have been driven from their homes. Most left on foot, leaving all their
possessions behind. The conflict has also strained the housing, educational and public
service systems of the villages and towns where the internally displaced people have
resettled. The natural environments of these areas are also rapidly being degraded.
Overcrowding increases the risk of epidemics. It is estimated that around 170,000 people
in host communities are at risk. Mendefera, Tessenay, Adi Keih and Senafe have borne
the greatest burden, but all towns and cities have been affected, including Asmara.

16. According to the last rapid assessment in August 2000, about 160,000 people had
been able to return to their homes in Gash Barka, Debub and Anseba, but many villages
have been heavily damaged and returnees have limited resources with which to rebuild.
However, returning home is not yet a safe option for most of the displaced. The
Ethiopian Army still occupies large areas south of the Gash River and Upper Gash and
Guluj sub-zones as well as areas close to the border where landmines pose risks to
returnees.

17. 
Because almost all men of ages 18-40 have been called up for military service,
most of the displaced people are women and children. They have been receiving minimal
services such as education and health care. Many are living in the hills without shelter
and sanitation and many are seeking safety in remote areas, making access by the relief
agencies extremely difficult. Because of the sparseness of trees and shrubs in these areas,
most people living here are exposed to extreme heat, and, since the beginning of the rainy
season, to rain. Most of the country's social indicators, already below the average for
Sub-Saharan Africa before the conflict, will likely deteriorate further.

4

Economic Impact

18. 

The main economic effects of the war on the Eritrea are:

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

Direct war damage. Direct war damage to roads and bridges,
power and telecommunications installations, schools, clinics, water
supply and sanitation facilities, factories and farms is estimated to
total some US$582 million, about 90 percent of 1999 GDP.

Loss of agricultural output. The areas most affected by the war,
Gash Barka and Debub, are also the nation's most agriculturally
productive, responsible for about 70 percent of total grain output.
The fighting and widescale displacements have prevented farmers
from planting their crops. Grain output is expected to fall by 75
percent and livestock production by 30 percent in 2000 compared
with 1999. This has exacerbated an already critical food shortage
arising from the drought.

Loss of port revenues. Port revenues have declined by about two-
thirds as a result of the loss of transshipment trade with Ethiopia.
The port of Assab has been particularly hard hit, as Ethiopia was
responsible for 90 percent of its business. Port revenues averaged
about 8 percent of GDP and 20 percent of annual government
revenues in 1995-1997. In 1998-2000 they represented only about
1 percent of GDP and 4 percent of government revenues.

Decline in private sector activity. Uncertainty arising from the
war, a decline in aggregate demand and a shortage of manpower
have led to sharp declines in private sector activity. Many private
investments, including foreign direct investments, have been
postponed. Promising planned joint ventures to develop fisheries,
mineral resources and tourist facilities have also been delayed

indefinitely.

Decline of exports. Exports of food and livestock, beverages, salt,
other commodities, manufactured goods, and machinery and
transport equipment have declined sharply because of the cessation
of trade with Ethiopia. In 1997 exports of goods totaled about
US$54 million, in 1998 they amounted to US$28 million and in
1999 they were only US$20 million. They are projected to remain
at about US$20 million in 2000 (see Table 1).

Macroeconomic impact. Direct war damage, the mobilization of
250,000 men and women, increases in military spending, declines
in private sector activity and loss of port revenues have combined

5

* 

to depress the economy. In 1998 and 1999, Eritrea's real GDP
growth rate fell to well below its 1994-97 average of 7 percent. It
is likely to decline by 9.5 percent in real terms in 2000. The
overall fiscal deficit (including grants) ballooned from an average
of 15 percent of GDP during 1994-97 to 48 percent in 1999. It is
projected to be about 40 percent of GDP in 2000 owing in part to a
resumption of international aid. The increase in the deficit resulted
from increased spending for national defense and a decline in
revenues. Defense expenditures rose from an average of about
ERN 800 million during 1995-97 (12 percent of GDP) to about
ERN 1,600 million during 1998-2000 (29 percent of GDP).

Debt, inflation and international reserves. The deficit has been
financed by a sharp increase in domestic and external borrowing.
Total external debt is expected to reach US$281 million by the end
of 2000 (about 48 percent of GDP). The ratio of the net present
value of external debt to the three-year average of exports of goods
and services is expected to jump from 130 percent in 1999 to 218
percent in 2000. (Present value of debt to exports rose from 38.4
percent in 1998 to 78.8 percent in 1999.) The ratio of debt service
to exports of goods and services (including workers' remittances)
has risen from virtually nothing in 1996 to nearly 5 percent in
2000. During 1998-2000, the money supply expanded rapidly,
triggering inflationary pressures, depreciation of the national
currency and depletion of foreign reserves. Inflation is expected to
reach 18 percent in 2000. Gross international reserves declined
from an average of three months of imports of goods and services
and income payments during 1994-1997 to one month in 1999 and
are estimated to fall to less than one month in 2000.

GOVERNMENT'S POST-CONFLICT STRATEGY FOR 2000-2001

19. 
The Eritrean Government's overriding objectives following the signing of the
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement are to reach a peace agreement with Ethiopia, rebuild
the economy and restore social services. This will require rehabilitating infrastructure
and buildings damaged by the war, assisting the displaced to reestablish their homes,
farms and businesses, and restoring macroeconomic balance, among other actions.
Therefore over the next year or so, the Government will focus on:

Meeting immediate needs for emergency humanitarian assistance.
War and drought have left about 1.7 million Eritreans with
inadequate resources to meet their basic needs. The situation is
likely to remain extremely difficult for the next 18-24 months,
during which the country will depend on emergency food
assistance. It will also rely on international donors for shelter,
water and sanitation 
infrastructure, agricultural 
inputs, and
education, health care and transportation services. Donors,
including Italy, the United States, Denmark, the United Nations
agencies (World Food Program, United Nations High Commission
for Refugees, UNDP, FAO, WHO, UNFPA, and UNICEF), have
supplied funds, goods and logistical assistance. 
International
NGOs, including OXFAM, Save the Children (U.K.), Africare,
ACORD, the International Committee of the Red Cross, CARE
International and others, are working through the Eritrean Relief
and Refugee Commission to provide water and sanitation facilities,
tents and tarps, and essential food and medicines to the refugee
camps. The Bank has contributed to the humanitarian effort by
reallocating resources from ongoing projects for emergency drugs
and other health care supplies, nutritional supplements, agricultural
inputs and cooking utensils, water and sanitation needs, and
transportation services.

Reconstructing infrastructure and assisting displaced people to
resume their economic activities. Direct war damage 
to
infrastructure and displacement of people has affected the
country's most agriculturally productive regions, so it is imperative
to reconstruct damaged roads, bridges, 
irrigation and other
infrastructure immediately to enable farmers to obtain the inputs
they need to cultivate their crops and ship them to markets. It is
also critical to reconstruct facilities for power and water supply,
roads, health clinics and schools. Provision must also be made for
maintenance of recently completed infrastructure projects. Finally,
it is essential to assist displaced people, many of whom have lost
their homes and all of their possessions, to rebuild their lives.

* 

7

Restoring a stable and supportive macroeconomic framework.
Bringing fiscal, monetary and balance of payments positions back
into balance is critical for restoring investor confidence and
reinvigorating economic growth. Cutting government spending by
demobilizing the soldiers and reintegrating them into the economy
is the first step. Balance of payments support to help finance
critical imports will also be needed. The Government sought
assistance 
from 
the IMF 
in September 
to assess recent
developments and explore policy options, and has expressed
interest in accessing assistance through the IMF's facility for
Emergency Assistance Related to Post-Conflict Situations.

7. 

WORLD BANK'S INTERIM SUPPORT STRATEGY FOR ERITREA

20. 
Although the Bank did not provide new lending to Eritrea during the two years of
war, it remained fully engaged through nonlending activities, supervision of ongoing
projects and preparation of programs that would support peace once hostilities ceased. In
June 2000, the Bank restructured its existing portfolio to the extent feasible to provide
assistance for immediate emergency needs. The Bank agreed to reallocate US$1.2
million from the Health Project for emergency drugs and other medical supplies; to
reallocate US$3.7 million from the Eritrea Community Development Fund (ECDF)
Project for emergency water and sanitation needs; and to restructure the Human Resource
Development (HRD) Project to release US$20 million for emergency nutritional
supplements, kitchen utensils, cooking stoves, agricultural inputs and transport services.2
In addition, as a result of loss of port traffic at Assab, the Bank had earlier restructured
the Ports Project.

21. While the restructuring has been helpful in meeting some urgent needs, the
magnitude of destruction and human suffering calls for a shift in Bank strategy to enable
it to address the country's critical requirements. Therefore, during the coming months,
the Bank is proposing to resume lending for two critical projects: emergency
reconstruction and HIV/AIDS. The Bank will also work with the Government on
developing a program for demobilization and, together with the IMF, a potential balance
of payments support program. Decisions on other important programs will be deferred
until a full Transitional Support Strategy is prepared, a process that will be carried out in
close consultation with Government and other development partners.

Portfolio Management

22. 
Six Bank-financed projects are under implementation in Eritrea. The newest is
the Integrated Early Childhood Development Project approved by the Board on July 27,

2 An amendment to the Human Resource Development Credit (IDA/R2000-125) which specified the
restructuring measures of the credit to provide immediate assistance for emergency needs was circulated to
the Board in June 2000. At that time, the Board was also informed of the restructuring measures for the
other two credits, which were fully consistent with the original development objectives of these projects
and thus required no amendments to the original development credit agreements.

8

2000 which has been designed with special attention to the needs of Eritrea's most
vulnerable groups and which is already effective. As of October 17, 2000 the
undisbursed balance for all six projects was US$100 million. Prior to the conflict,
Eritrea's project implementation performance was ranked in the top quartile among the
Bank's borrowers. Even with disrupted supervision activities owing to the war,
implementation of the existing portfolio has been commendable. The country team has
been proactive in addressing problem projects. 
Implementation of the emergency
activities supported with funds reallocated from ongoing projects is proceeding
satisfactorily.

New Lending

23. 
The level of the Bank's proposed lending program for the Interim Support
Strategy period (FY2001) reflects the relatively strong performance of the portfolio
during the past year, as well as Eritrea's history of sound economic, social, and
institutional performance. World Bank lending for Eritrea during the period covered by
this Interim Support Strategy and the first half of fiscal 2002 would support two projects:
the Emergency Reconstruction Program (US$90 million), and the HIV/AIDS-Malaria-
Tuberculosis Project (up to US$40 million).

24. 
Emergency Reconstruction Program. This Bank-led multi-donor program will
provide about US$288 million to assist Eritrea to rapidly rebuild its physical and social
infrastructure, help displaced and drought-affected people rebuild their lives and resume
their economic activities, and assist the Government to procure essential imports through
balance of payments support. The program has five components. The first component
will support agriculture through the supply of inputs, including seeds, fertilizer, farm
tools and machinery and livestock. The second will support infrastructure reconstruction
and rehabilitation, including roads, bridges, power plants, schools, health clinics, water
supply, and houses. The third will support private sector development through the
provision of both micro credit and regular bank loans and the cleanup of the war-affected
bank loan portfolio. The fourth will support social protection by providing funds for
community-level health, education, access roads, water and sanitation facilities, and
micro credit, among others. The fifth will provide import support based on a positive list
of imports; IDA is not financing this component. IDA is providing US$90 million
equivalent. The remainder is being provided by the European Union (US$50 million),
Italy (US$58.7 million), Denmark (US$11.million), France (US$3 million), and the
African Development Bank (US$21 million) with the balance (US$24 million) being
provided by the Government.3

25. HIV/AIDS-Malaria-Tuberculosis Project. HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis
are three of the most deadly infectious diseases affecting Eritreans. The Bank-financed
project is based on the Government's HIV/AIDS strategy. This strategy provides an
effective response to HIV/AIDS and the related health issues facing Eritreans. Between 3

3The EU has indicated that it is seeking approval for an additional Euro 35 million to complete the
financing package.

9

and 4 percent of adults are estimated to be infected with HIV/AIDS.4 But given the
large-scale mobilization of young adults for military service, there is considerable risk
that, without well-designed and implemented programs for HIV/AIDS prevention, the
disease could spread fast. Malaria is a serious problem in the Eritrea lowlands,
accounting for 32 percent of outpatient illnesses and 28 percent of all hospital
admissions. It contributes to early death of people infected by HIV/AIDS. Tuberculosis
(TB), one of the major opportunistic infections affecting people living with HIV/AIDS,
also poses a significant public health risk. It spreads readily among people living in
overcrowded and unhygienic conditions. Treating TB improves the quality of life for
people living with HIV/AIDS and reduces the chances of infecting people who are not
HIV positive. The project will collect and analyze information on the three diseases;
implement multisectoral prevention programs; strengthen diagnostic, health care and
counseling services; and pilot community-driven programs.

Preparation of Priority Programs for the Next Phase of the Transitional Support
Strategy

26. 
Eritrea intends to move quickly to restore macroeconomic and fiscal balance and
create the conditions for long-term growth. The Bank will provide technical assistance
and prepare programs for the next phase of the transition strategy, to be implemented
during 2002-04. There are two immediate priorities: demobilization and support for
macroeconomic management.

27. Demobilization. The Government recognizes that demobilization is crucial to
achieving macroeconomic and 
fiscal balance and 
for building confidence.
Demobilization will also contribute directly towards relaxing the manpower constraints
that Government and businesses face. The Government has already indicated that it
would like assistance in designing and mobilizing financing for a demobilization
program. It is currently putting together a team to work with the Bank and other donors
in developing the program. The scope and likely cost of demobilization are not yet
known. The Bank is exploring the possibility of establishing a trust fund supported by
donors to fund the demobilization process.

28. 
Support for macroeconomic management. The Bank is working with the IMF to
assess Eritrea's macroeconomic and growth prospects and help the country develop an
external debt management strategy. In the context of a Fund-supported program, the
Bank may also consider providing balance of payments support to complement the
proposed project-based interventions.

29. Development projects. The Government is preparing an Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, which will guide our future assistance strategy. It is envisaged
that, over the medium term, the Bank will resume lending for key projects which support

underestimate.

the Government's program to restore growth and social services. However, we would
need to carefully review the pipeline of projects with the Government to ensure that
projects address priority needs. In addition, the implementation experience of this first
phase of conflict-related emergency support will need to be considered in determining the
phasing and level of our future project activity. The transition support strategy will also
build on the recently completed ESW in agriculture, finance and export development, and
upcoming education and health sector reviews and a PER/CEM. It is anticipated that
future lending will focus on community-based development, education, and key
infrastructure, such as power and roads. In parallel, a program for restarting the private
sector, particularly exports, may be necessary to generate growth and employment.

30. 
IFC. Over the past two years, IFC has been providing technical assistance for the
marble and granite industry, the Chamber of Commerce and the fisheries sector. IFC's
medium-term strategy is to complement Eritrea's development of the export sector. IFC
is therefore exploring investment opportunities focusing on export-oriented industries,
fisheries and tourism.

8. 

DONOR COORDINATION

31. 
The Government of Eritrea has established a close working relationship with its
development partners in recent years. In November 1998, it sponsored a conference with
its development partners to discuss its vision and programs for the short and medium
term. Building on the conference, the Government has been highly effective in
coordinating donor assistance for humanitarian needs and donor support for the
Emergency Reconstruction Program. The preparation of the Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper will further strengthen Government's relationships with its partners. A
major Government-partners meeting is being planned for early 2001, assuming
substantial progress is made on the peace process. The Government plans to present its
proposed fiscal 2001 budget and its medium-term strategy for recovery and development
at this meeting.

9. 

RiSKS

32. Although the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is holding and deployment of
UN troops is on track, there is still a risk that the war will resume. However, this looks
increasingly less likely as both countries are now seeking international support for
reconstruction, recovery, and demobilization, all of which will reinforce progress towards
peace. To further minimize risks to the Bank during this period of uncertainty, a limited
program is proposed to defer longer-term commitments until a transition support strategy
has been prepared. If hostilities resume, management will reassess the program. 
It
should be noted that the reconstruction program that the Bank is proposing will
contribute to the establishment of peace by helping Eritrea rebuild its economy and
provide essential social services. The peace process is also supported by proposing
similar programs for Ethiopia and Eritrea, encouraging both to move forward with
negotiated solutions to the dispute.

11

33. Aside from the risk that the war resumes, there is the risk that Government lacks
capacity to prepare and implement subprojects satisfactorily. Bank staff believe this risk
is quite small. Eritrea has an excellent track record of implementing Bank projects. Prior
to the conflict Eritrea was in the top performance quartile of IDA borrowers and it has
continued to implement development projects throughout the war. Both the Emergency
Reconstruction Program and the HIV/AIDS-Malaria-Tuberculosis Project build on
successful models. 
Implementation of these projects will also benefit from well-
coordinated donor support. To manage macroeconomic risks, the Bank is working
closely with the IMF.

34. While the risks of supporting Eritrea are considerable, the risks of not responding
are far greater. Without external assistance, Eritrea simply could not rebuild its economy.
This could set off an even worse humanitarian crisis than already exists and heighten the
level of tension in the region. By the end of the fiscal year the Bank will have a better
idea of progress being made in the peace negotiations. It should also be possible to form
a judgment on the level of support Eritrea may need from the international community,
and have a clear view of the macroeconomic framework that will be developed as part of
the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. These considerations will guide Bank
programs for the longer term.

10. CONCLUSIONS

35. Given the extremely difficult circumstances the country is facing in the aftermath
of the conflict, Eritrea requires exceptional assistance for the next several years. The
lending program and advisory services proposed for the period covered by the Interim
Support Strategy aim to address Eritrea's most pressing needs through new lending for
emergency reconstruction and a health project to address HIV/AIDS and the related
burdens of malaria and tuberculosis. The Bank intends to be proactive in supporting the
Government's development partner coordination efforts as part of the interim poverty
reduction strategy process.

36. 
Following the preparation of the Government's I-PRSP and before proceeding
with additional lending beyond the emergency reconstruction and HIV/AIDS projects
discussed above, management will submit a Transitional Support Strategy to the Board.
The report will focus on progress made towards achieving peace, steps being taken by the
Government to restore macroeconomic stability, portfolio implementation, capacity
constraints that Government faces, donor coordination, and the Bank's proposed strategic
response.
