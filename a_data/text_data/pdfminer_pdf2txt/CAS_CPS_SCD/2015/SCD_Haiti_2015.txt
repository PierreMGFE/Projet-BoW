We would like to thank the members of 
the Haiti Country Team from all Global 
Practices, CCSAs, IFC, and MIGA, as well as 
all the partners and stakeholders in Haiti 
who have contributed to the preparation of 
this document in a strong collaborative pro-
cess. We are very grateful for the generosity 
exhibited in providing us with substantive 
inputs, knowledge and advice, particularly 
given the time limitations. The table below 
identifies the full list of team members who 
have contributed their time, effort and ex-
pertise, and their affiliations.
The team was led by Raju Jan Singh 
(Program Leader, LCC8C). The work was 
carried out jointly with the IFC (Sylvain 
Kakou) and MIGA (Petal Hacket) under 
the overall guidance of Mary Barton-Dock 
(Special Envoy for Haiti, LCC8C) and Jun 
Zhang (Senior Regional Manager for the 
Caribbean, IFC).
We wish to thank for their helpful sugges-
tions and insights the Systematic Country 
Diagnostic (SCD) peer reviewers, Nancy 
Benjamin, Senior Country Economist 
(GMFDR), Oscar Calvo-Gonzalez, Program 
Leader (LCC2C), and Philip Keefer, 
Principal Advisor (IDB), as well as Rolf Parta 
for moderating our two-day Country Team 
retreat, and Augusto de la Torre (LCR Chief 
Economist) and Daniel Lederman (LCR 
Deputy Chief Economist) for their advice 
throughout the stages of the SCD process.
The SCD not only draws on existing liter-
ature from within and outside the Bank, but 
benefitted from the results of the recent 
household survey (ECVMAS 2012), as well 
as access to the MINUSTAH data on crime 

events across Haiti. In this regard, we wish to 
express our gratitude to the ONPES, IHSI, 
and MINUSTAH for making this possible. 
This report also draws heavily on the recent-
ly-completed Poverty Assessment and the 
ongoing Public Expenditure Review. In 
 addition, a number of background papers 
have been written by the Country Team on 
specific themes. In this respect, the Team 
is appreciative to Prof. James Robinson 
(Harvard University) and Prof. Suresh Naidu 
(Columbia University) for discussions on the 
role of Haitian business elites in Haiti’s de-
velopment, and particularly to Lauren Young 
(Columbia University) for presenting pre-
liminary results of their research at the 
World Bank. We wish also to thank Prof. 
Cristina Bodea and Masaaki Higashijima 
(both from Michigan State University) for 
their work on public spending and conflict.
The analytical work was validated by 
wide consultations. In this regard, we wish to 
thank Bernard Craan, Executive Director of 
the Private Sector Economic Forum for orga-
nizing a meeting with the members of his as-
sociation; Delphine Colbeau, UNDP, who 
coordinated a workshop on violence with the 
heads of all UN agencies present in Port-au-
Prince; Gilles Damais, IDB, for inviting us to 
present our work at one of its Wednesdays 
of Reflection with members of the academia, 
civil society, private sector, and Haitian ad-
ministration; Kesner Pharel to provide us 
with the opportunity to share our ideas on 
his TV show ; and Mariam Yazdani from 
Vivario for interesting discussions on gang 
dynamics. We are also very grateful to

Executive Summary

Haiti has a vision to become an emerg-
ing economy by 2030. Haiti’s geography, 
 resources, and history provide it with oppor-
tunities. The country has comparative advan-
tages, including its proximity and access to 
major markets; a young labor force and a 
 dynamic diaspora; and substantial geo-
graphic, historical, and cultural assets. Areas 
of economic opportunity for Haiti include 
agribusiness, light manufacturing and tour-
ism. Building on these opportunities, the 
Government of Haiti issued in May 2012 a 
Strategic Development Plan (PSDH), aiming 
at building a new modern, diversified, resil-
ient, competitive and inclusive economy, re-
spectful of its environment and in which 
people’s basic needs are met. This objective 
would require ambitious double digit growth 
rates, a significant break from the past, based 
on an expansion of agriculture, construction, 
manufacturing, and tourism.
Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in 
the last four decades has been disappointing, 
however, and poverty remains endemic. A 
history of vested interests, political instabil-
ity, and natural disasters has prevented the 
country from realizing its aspirations, trap-
ping the country in a low equilibrium and 
keeping it as one of the poorest and least 
equal countries in the world. GDP per capita 
fell by 0.7 percent per year on average be-
tween 1971 and 2013. As a result, in 2012 
59 percent of Haitians remained poor and 
24 percent suffered from extreme poverty, 
indicating that almost 6.3 million Haitians 
could not meet their basic needs and 2.5 mil-
lion could not even cover their food needs.

This Systematic Country Diagnostic 
(SCD) seeks to identify the most important 
constraints to and opportunities for inclusive 
and sustainable growth in Haiti. To identify 
the key constraints to Haiti’s growth and 
shared prosperity, an extensive review of the 
literature (from both within and outside the 
World Bank) was first carried out. Economic 
and sector work on Haiti produced in 1980s 
and the early 1990s had already identified 
most of the country’s challenges and demon-
strated that better functioning institutions, 
stronger human capital, and improvements 
in infrastructure were all needed for Haiti’s 
economic growth and shared prosperity. 
Rather than listing these again, this report 
attempts to provide some prioritization 
and identify the most binding constraints, 
both quantitatively and through a series 
of consultations with stakeholders and the 
country team.

Country Profile: What 
Makes Haiti Haiti?

A social contract is missing between the 
State and its citizens. While overall income 
growth is a necessary condition for increas-
ing shared prosperity, it is not sufficient. 
Growth that is inclusive of the poor requires 
additional mechanisms such as a pro-poor 
fiscal regime, as well as targeted social pro-
grams and expenditures, not only to redis-
tribute resources towards the poor but also 
more importantly to ensure that the less 
well-off are an integral part of the process

and that opportunities improve for all. 
Previous reports have noted, however, that 
Haiti has never had a tradition of providing 
services to the population or creating an en-
vironment conducive to sustainable growth. 
Haiti’s tax system generates limited resources 
for the government and tends to be regres-
sive. Furthermore, public spending in health, 
education, and social protection remains 
limited, constraining the government’s abil-
ity to provide services and offer equal oppor-
tunities to its citizens. In the absence of 
government, basic services such as health 
and education are mainly provided by non- 
government actors, placing a substantial fi-
nancial burden on households and delivering 
achievements closely linked with household 
income.
The reliance on non-government actors 
has also weakened public investment 
 management. Haiti’s public investment man-
agement exhibits a number of distinctive fea-
tures and practices common to countries 
that are aid-dependent, including weak 
 appraisal capacity and reliance on donors 
to design good projects, hampering the 
 effective use of public resources. Sectoral 
strategies to guide the prioritization of 
 projects are lacking. This leads to a Public 
Investment Program composed of projects 
that are neither fully assessed nor prioritized. 
Furthermore, there is no effective ex-ante 
control on disbursements based on the phys-
ical progress of projects against plans. While 
progress is being made in fiscal reporting by 
rolling out the use of a single treasury ac-
count, domestically-funded capital expendi-
tures are not yet properly accounted for, 
tracked and reported, creating an environ-
ment conducive to a lack of transparency 
and accountability.

The structure of the private sector shows 
signs of high degrees of concentration, 
hampering the entry of new actors and re-
sulting in high prices for consumers. From 
the beginning of the twentieth century, au-
tocratic leaders in Haiti have traded politi-
cal support from the elite for economic 
advantages to this elite. Though publicly 
available information on privately held 
businesses is limited, many of the same 
families who dominated the Haitian econ-
omy during the era of Duvalier in the 1970s 
and the 1980s seem to remain in control of 
large segments of the economy today, re-
sulting in high concentration in a number 
of key industries, distorted competition, 
and non-transparent business practices in 
many instances. Several of the most impor-
tant food products in the Haitian consump-
tion basket are sold in concentrated 
markets, and a preliminary analysis indi-
cates that the prices of these products are 
on average about 30–60 percent higher in 
Haiti than in other countries from the re-
gion. This translates into limited opport-
unities for a substantial expansion of the 
formal private sector across most sectors. 
Few of Haiti’s established private firms have 
modern capital and governance structures 
with professional management, limiting 
their access to long-term financing.
Political violence has occurred regularly 
throughout Haiti’s history, leading to insta-
bility. At Independence in 1804, Haiti was 
at the forefront of history, being the first na-
tion to abolish slavery. Since then, however, 
with some exceptions such as the 30-year 
 period of autocratic rule under Francois 
Duvalier (Papa Doc) and his son Jean-
Claude Duvalier (Baby Doc) (1957–86), 
Haiti has known a succession of short-lived 

2 

Executive Summary

governments. Lacking sufficiently long peri-
ods of stability, the country has struggled 
to develop the institutional mechanisms 
and policy fundamentals essential to eco-
nomic development and the rule of law. 
Disenfranchised and without effective chan-
nels to voice needs and demands, citizens 
have taken to the streets in protest, some-
times violently. While violent airing of griev-
ances in Haiti’s early history generally took 
place in the rural areas, contemporary unrest 
tends to break out in the cities, reflecting the 
country’s demographic evolution and urban-
ization over the years. Against this backdrop, 
the post-earthquake period has been com-
paratively stable.
Furthermore, the Haitian population is 
one of the most exposed in the world to 
 natural disasters—hurricanes, floods and 
earthquakes. Between 1971 and 2013, Haiti’s 
economy has been subjected to natural di-
sasters almost every year with adverse effects 
on growth. The country has a higher number 
of disasters per km2 than the average of 
the Caribbean countries. In 2008, tropical 
storms and hurricanes caused losses esti-
mated at 15 percent of GDP. The earthquake 
on January 12, 2010 killed 220,000 people, 
displaced 1.5 million people, and destroyed 
the equivalent of 120 percent of GDP.
In this unfavorable environment, migra-
tion has become a key avenue for Haitians 
seeking a better life. Substantial internal mi-
gration is taking place, particularly from 
rural to urban areas, as people seek better 
economic opportunities and better services. 
In addition, for both political and economic 
reasons, large numbers of Haitians have emi-
grated throughout the twentieth century 
building an important diaspora. A vast ma-
jority of Haitians who continue to emigrate 

now seem to do so because they cannot find 
work opportunities in Haiti. This large dias-
pora is a significant source of remittances: 
remittances received by Haiti are the highest 
among Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) 
countries in terms of GDP and the fourth 
highest in the world in terms of export 
earnings.

Trends and Profile in 
Poverty and Shared 
Prosperity

While remaining high, poverty has de-
clined in Haiti. Recent findings indicate that 
extreme poverty has declined in Haiti from 
31 percent of the population in 2000 to 24 
percent in 2012. Progress was mainly con-
centrated in urban areas, however. This trend 
is confirmed by both monetary and non-
monetary poverty indicators, with the big-
gest non-monetary progress recorded in 
education. All school-age children go to 
school in about 90 percent of the households 
compared to about 80 percent in 2001. 
Immunization rates are also up.
Recent evidence suggests that this decline 
in extreme poverty was driven by labor 
 income, private transfers, and aid. Non-
agricultural labor income increased by about 
3½ percent on average per year, especially 
among men, with expansions in construc-
tion, telecommunication and transport, all 
concentrated in urban areas. Formal employ-
ment remains small (13 percent of the labor 
force) with agriculture and urban informal 
sectors still providing most of the employ-
ment with about 40 percent and 47 percent 
of the labor market, respectively. Workers’ 
transfers from abroad have represented more

than a fifth of Haiti’s GDP in recent years, 
and the percentage of households receiving 
private transfers (domestic transfers or re-
mittances from abroad) in Haiti increased 
from 42 percent to 69 percent between 2000 
and 2012. Furthermore, the 2010 earthquake 
resulted in unprecedented aid flows in the 
form of money, goods and services. These 
external flows have also contributed in re-
ducing poverty over the period, especially 
in the metropolitan area which attracted 
most of the assistance (in large part because 
Port-au-Prince was hit hardest by the 
earthquake).

Trends and Drivers of 
Growth

Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in 
the last four decades has been disappointing. 
From 1971 to 2013, GDP growth averaged 
1.2 percent a year, much lower than the aver-
age of the LAC region (3.5 percent) and the 
average of economies at the same level of de-
velopment (3.3 percent). The few periods of 
positive growth were short-lived, often fol-
lowed by a contraction in economic activity. 
Furthermore, in light of the country’s impor-
tant demographic growth, the level of GDP 
per capita even fell by 0.7 percent per year 
on average between 1971 and 2013. Whereas 
low income countries (LICs) have on average 
seen their GDP per capita taking off since 
the mid-1990s, Haiti was left behind.
Political instability and natural disasters 
have taken a toll on growth. Despite invest-
ment and increases in the labor force, Haiti’s 
growth performance has remained weak, re-
flecting the natural disasters and political in-
stability the country has experienced. The 
departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier initiated 

a period of intense political instability in 
Haiti. Between 1986 and 2014 the country 
had 18 changes of president and important 
changes in regime. Such political instability 
has often been accompanied by violence and 
a continuous weakening of state institutions, 
the rule of law, and the investment climate, 
undermining investor confidence. 
Uncertainty as to whether investors can ob-
tain returns from their investments rep-
resents one of the main constraints to growth 
in Haiti. Political instability has also resulted 
in a trade embargo in the first half of the 
1990s that crippled private sector activities.
Haiti’s business environment is hampered 
by institutional weaknesses. Although gover-
nance indicators have improved, Haiti still 
ranks lowest in the region in control of 
 corruption or government ef fectiveness. 
Ef f icient mechanisms for international 
 arbitration and mediation are lacking . 
Guarantees for the protection of investors’ 
private property rights are insufficient. Legal 
and regulatory frameworks are fragmented 
and dysfunctional. In particular, a real prop-
erty cadaster and land registry system is 
needed. Furthermore, access to finance is 
challenging for both, households and me-
dium- and small-sized enterprises.
Haiti’s infrastructure also falls short. 
Island economies are extremely dependent 
on the quality, frequency and cost of the 
means of transport that link them to markets 
which represent both outlets for their prod-
ucts and supply sources for the needed im-
ported goods. The efficiency and effectiveness 
of transport, whether by road, by sea, or by 
air, therefore strongly affects their competi-
tiveness. The quality of transport and logistics 
services in Haiti is low, however, with large 
parts of the territory still poorly connected. 
Recent evidence indicates, for instance, that 

4 

Executive Summary

only 40 percent of people living in rural areas 
have access to all-weather roads. Haiti is also 
less integrated into the global shipping line 
network than many developing countries, 
and the costs of loading and unloading a 
standard container at Port-au-Prince are by 
far the highest of the Caribbean ports.
In particular, the provision of electricity 
is problematic. The supply of electricity cov-
ers only a small proportion of the country, 
with rural areas being particularly neglected. 
Only 35 percent of Haitians have access to 
electricity (11 percent in rural areas). The 
provision of electricity in Haiti is also unsta-
ble and there are frequent power cuts and 
surges, which can result in serious damage to 
industrial equipment. Business owners cite 
the lack of reliable electricity supply as the 
most binding constraint to private sector de-
velopment. Despite this poor service, the 
cost of electricity is among the highest in the 
region. Furthermore, per capita consump-
tion of electricity in Haiti is substantially 
lower than in other Caribbean countries, for 
example, it is only two percent of the level 
observed in the Dominican Republic.
Surveys also point to the lack of qualified 
labor. One major constraint faced by enter-
prises in Haiti is the difficulty to find techni-
cians that are well qualified, particularly in 
new technologies and trained managers for 
middle management. This forces the country 
to position itself as a low cost producer for 
goods and services requiring limited skills. 
The level of education among the adult pop-
ulation remains low : 45.7 percent of the 
adult population (60.5 percent of house-
holds’ heads) have never attended school or 
have not completed primary education. Not 
mastering basic skills such as literacy and 
numeracy when starting work represents a 
major impediment for their insertion in the 

labor market and, more importantly, for 
their ability to absorb post-school training 
either on or off the job, and to adapt to 
changing job requirements.
The constraints discussed above seem 
to be particularly present in the agriculture 
and the non-agriculture informal sector, 
where most Haitians are likely to continue 
working for the foreseeable future. The for-
mal manufacturing and service sectors have 
the potential to be an important source of 
employment, but because they hire such a 
small share of the labor force, even with very 
high growth rates, they will not be able to 
absorb more than a fraction of the new en-
trants. The agriculture sector in Haiti has 
been declining for many years, the result of 
neglected rural infrastructure, weak research 
and extension, poorly defined land tenure, 
limited access to credit, and under-investment 
in human capital. With regard to the infor-
mal non-agriculture sector, empirical evi-
dence suggests that a little investment in 
years of education or remedial training for 
skills acquisition among people who have 
been out of the school system for a long 
time, as well as improved access to inputs, 
such as electricity and water, are associated 
with substantial increases in income.

Sustainability

Urbanization is increasing Haiti’s vul-
nerability to natural disasters. As a safety 
valve, migration probably contains poverty 
and provides relief to many families through 
private transfers. However, moving to urban 
areas is putting pressure on the environment, 
and leading to the settlement of large popu-
lations in vulnerable places. Urban areas 
have experienced an explosive expansion 
in the past two decades with a near total  

Executive Summary 

5

absence of urban planning and growth regu-
lation. This unplanned urban growth has 
created vulnerabilities for both the physi-
cal environment and those who live in it. 
Furthermore, settlers tend to occupy areas 
that are not only prone to risk from disasters, 
but are also sometimes nature’s protection 
from risks such as coastal ecosystems. Slow 
degradation of the environment in such 
areas in turn increases the country’s vulnera-
bility as a whole to natural disasters.
Rapid urbanization could also be feeding 
greater violence. Youth violence is often ex-
pressed as a reaction to perceived social and 
economic exclusion—grievances that can 
easily be mobilized by political interests. 
Rapid migration to urban neighborhoods, 
associated with poverty, unemployment, po-
litical and social marginalization, limited 
 access to services, and weak governance, 
could fuel the formation of gangs that engage 
at-risk youth and draw them in. Evidence 
suggests that migration is associated with 
greater violence, as social ties erode. New 
migrants are likely to have less access to local 
social networks which provide economic and 
social support. These grievances have also 
contributed to intergenerational conflict, un-
dermining social cohesion and hindering the 
capacity of many communities for produc-
tive collective action.
Macroeconomic stability has been main-
tained in the aftermath of the earthquake. 
Haiti’s macroeconomic environment has sig-
nificantly improved over the past decade. 
Inflation was brought down to single digits 
and international reserves built up to ade-
quate levels. Between 2009 and 2011, Haiti’s 
stock of external debt drastically shrank fol-
lowing debt relief. In addition to benefiting 
from the HIPC and the MDRIs, Haiti re-
ceived additional debt cancellation in the 

aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. The real 
effective exchange rate remained aligned 
with fundamentals.
Budget constraints are becoming tighter, 
however, and could put at risk some of the 
recent progress achieved in human develop-
ment. The country has taken the opportunity 
of its greater borrowing space to contract 
loans on concessional terms with Republica 
Bolivariana de Venezuela through the 
Petrocaribe agreement. While the availability 
of this concessional financing has allowed 
higher levels of public investments and 
spending on social programs, it has also al-
lowed a widening of Haiti’s twin fiscal and 
current account deficits, increasing the coun-
try’s level of indebtedness, although keeping 
it at a sustainable level. The decline in aid 
and in international oil prices (which affect 
the availability of Haiti’s concessional re-
sources) is reducing the country’s fiscal 
space. These tighter constraints could put at 
risk some of the recent progress achieved in 
poverty reduction and human development, 
making the country’s balancing act between 
developmental needs and fiscal sustainability 
even more challenging.

Priorities

A quantitative approach would suggest 
a policy mix including higher investment in 
human and physical capital, which would 
also support greater political stability. Faster 
economic growth alone will not be enough 
to bring significant improvements in the liv-
ing standards of most Haitians. Without any 
change in the income distribution, reducing 
extreme poverty to 3 percent by 2030 would 
require a two- to three-fold acceleration in 
Haiti’s growth rate with respect to its best 
performing years: a very ambitious outcome. 

6 

Executive Summary

Policies to ensure more inclusiveness are 
thus needed to allow the incomes of the bot-
tom 40 percent to grow faster than the aver-
age. In this regard, estimations suggest that 
the bottom 40 percent of the income distri-
bution would see their incomes grow faster 
than the average if Haiti were to invest in 
health, education, and infrastructure, as well 
as achieve greater political stability. In turn, 
simulations for Haiti indicate that political 
stability could be increased—or more 
broadly conflict risk reduced—through 
higher welfare spending (education, health, 
and social protection).
Qualitative research based on consulta-
tions brought additional important insights. 
Broad consultations were carried out with 
stakeholders and the country team. In this 
regard, the general story line was validated, 
but in addition the consultations highlighted 
that:

•	 Maintaining the stability of the macroeco-
nomic environment called for immediate 
attention. The decline in donor assistance— 
returning to pre-earthquake levels—and 
lower availability of concessional financ-
ing following the drop in international oil 
prices raised concerns about the sustain-
ability of many social programs and of the 
recent progress in improving access to 
some basic services. In this regard, greater 
mobilization of own fiscal revenue and 
improved efficiency in public expenditure 
management were seen as critical.
•	 Turning to more medium-term chal-
lenges, progress needs to be made simul-
taneously on several fronts. For Haiti to 
break from its past and achieve meaning-
ful progress towards poverty reduction, a 
piecemeal approach to reform focusing on 
one sector only would not work.

•	 State capacity needs to be strengthened. 
Poor governance and the need to 
strengthen the State were generally viewed 
as the most important constraints. The 
lengthiness of the process should not 
deter immediate action, but call for more 
realistic expectations. In this regard, many 
stakeholders perceived that donors by-
passing the Haitian government in favor 
of non-State actors, while providing per-
haps a quick and short-term response, 
continued to undermine the public sector 
and could not bring a long-term solution 
to the lack of government capacity.
•	 Restoring the social contract was flagged 
as particularly important. Most modern 
democracies use fiscal revenue to finance 
the State, regulate private activity, and re-
distribute wealth. In return for these reve-
nues, the State is expected to provide key 
services and a level playing field for the 
private sector. In Haiti, both sides of this 
contract are very weak—few people or 
businesses pay taxes, and the State strug-
gles to provide services and appropriate 
regulation.
•	 Barriers to market entry need to be 
 removed, competition enhanced, and 
small private sector actors supported. 
Representatives of the established private 
sector recognized the lack of competition 
existing in Haiti’s economy, a reflection 
in their view of the country’s unfavorable 
business environment. In this regard, 
civil society expressed concern about the 
higher prices and the possible lack of 
 innovation that limited competition 
implied.
•	 There was not only a need for more jobs, 
but also for better jobs. It was pointed 
out that the private sector in Haiti 
was not only limited to a couple of large 

Executive Summary

enterprises. Most people in Haiti were oc-
cupied in a less visible private sector : in 
the agriculture and informal sectors, two 
sectors that had been neglected so far.
•	 The importance of reducing vulnerabilities 
was also stressed. In the face of recurring 
shocks and vulnerability, better risk man-
agement strategies and better targeting in 
social protection should be a priority to 
protect households and individual liveli-
hoods. Disaster risk management should 
be strengthened. Risks need to be identified 
and understood better, as well as reduced 
in the future through greater awareness 
when investing. Financial protection needs 
to be designed in case risks materialize.
•	 Finally, the consultations made it clear 
that there was limited evidence to inform 
planning and targeting of programs and 
policies. Discussions with stakeholders, as 
well as discussions with the country team 
confirmed that it is difficult to carry out 
effective development policies without ap-
propriate statistics or analytics.

Policy packages—or buckets—rather 
than independent act ivit ies in sectors were 
thus recommended. The SCD points out 
f ive broad themes around which act ivit ies 
need to be organized in order to ignite a 
process whereby Hait i cou ld set itself on a 
new development path : (a) ba lancing mac-
roeconomic stabi lity with developmenta l 
needs ; (b) improving stat ist ics and ana lyt-
ics ; (c)  creat ing greater economic oppor tu-
nit ies and better jobs , including through 
infrastructure and human capita l ; (d) (re)
bui lding the socia l contract ; and (e) re-
ducing vu lnerabi lit ies and bui lding resi l-
ience. Progress on a l l these themes is 
needed simu ltaneously. In light of the 
t ighter budget constraints facing the gov-
ernment , maintaining the stabi lity of the 
macroeconomic environment , and im-
proving know ledge and stat ist ics to in-
crease the ef fect iveness of public policy 
(including more transparent f isca l repor t-
ing) ca l l more par t icu larly for immediate 
attent ion .

Opportunities and a 
Vision

Haiti’s geography, resources, and his-
tory provide it with opportunities. Haiti oc-
cupies the western, smaller portion of the 
island of Hispaniola, which it shares with the 
Dominican Republic. Both by area and pop-
ulation, Haiti is the third largest Caribbean na-
tion (after Cuba and the Dominican Re public), 
with 27,750 square kilometers and an esti-
mated population of 10.4 million people. The 
country has comparative advantages, includ-
ing its proximity and access to major mar-
kets; a young labor force and a dynamic 
diaspora; and substantial geographic, histori-
cal, and cultural assets.1 There is a pent-up 
demand and many untapped markets that 
the private sector can explore. Areas of eco-
nomic opportunity for Haiti include in agri-
business, light manufacturing and tourism. 
Furthermore, Haiti possesses mineral poten-
tial. According to the World Economic 
Forum, Haiti’s economic fundamentals could 
allow the country to become a vibrant econ-
omy and grow by 6–8 percent a year if ade-
quate policies were in place World Economic 
Forum (2011).
Building on these opportunities, the 
country has a vision to become an emerging 
economy by 2030. In May 2012, the Govern-
ment of Haiti issued a Strategic Development 
Plan (PSDH), building on the Action Plan 
for the Recovery and Development of Haiti 
(PARDH) prepared following the 2010 
earthquake. The PSDH details the PARDH’s 
vision and strategic plan for the country’s 
long-term development, and four major 

areas of work for the recovery and develop-
ment of Haiti: territorial reform, economic 
reform, social reform and institutional re-
form. The Plan aims at building a new mod-
ern, diversified, resilient, competitive and 
inclusive economy, respectful of its environ-
ment and in which people’s basic needs are 
met. This objective would require ambitious 
double digit growth rates, a significant break 
from the past, based on an expansion of agri-
culture, construction, manufacturing, and 
tourism.
Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in 
the last four decades has been disappoint-
ing, however, and poverty remains endemic. 
A history of vested interests, political insta-
bility, and natural disasters has prevented 
the country from realizing up to now its as-
pirations, trapping it in a low equilibrium 
and keeping it as one of the poorest and 
most unequal countries in the world. GDP 
per capita fell by 0.7 percent per year on av-
erage between 1971 and 2013. As a result, 
the overall poverty headcount amounts to 
about 59 percent and extreme poverty to 
24 percent in 2012, indicating that almost 
6.3 million Haitians cannot meet their basic 
needs and 2.5 million cannot even cover 
their food needs.

A Broken Social 
Contract

While overall income growth is a neces-
sary condition for increasing shared prosperity, 
it is not sufficient. Growth is not a cure-all, 
but it is essential to allow Haitians to escape

poverty. Unfortunately, Haiti has yet to achieve 
a sufficiently strong growth momentum. How-
ever, even the modest resources the country 
has generated in the past have not been dis-
tributed in an inclusive manner. Growth that 
is inclusive of the poor requires additional 
mech anisms such as a pro-poor fiscal regime, 
as well as targeted social programs and expen-
ditures, not only to redistribute resources to-
wards the poor but also more importantly to 
ensure that the less well-off are an integral part 
of the process and that opportunities im-
prove for all.2
A social contract is missing between the 
State and its citizens. Haiti is not very inclu-
sive. The Bank’s 1998 Poverty Report noted 
that “Haiti has never had a tradition of gov-
ernance aimed at providing services to the 
population or creating an environment con-
ducive to sustainable growth.” A number of 
Haitian and international observers broadly 
agree that the Haitian State remains ineffec-
tive and delivers little to its population. To a 
large extent, this results from the particular 
winner-takes-it-all nature of Haitian politics 

Figure 1.1 

inclusiveness

and economics which creates little incentive 
for broad-based coalition building. “Haitian 
institutions have never provided justice, edu-
cation or healthcare to the majority of the 
population” (Lockhart and Forman 2013). 
Instead, a small economic elite has supported 
a state that makes only negligible invest-
ments in human resources and basic infra-
structure (World Bank 1998). “Governance 
and state capacity to effectively formulate 
and implement sound policies, and to deliver 
core public services to the population, are 
weak. The state is present largely in the major 
urban centers and has been unable to pro-
vide basic services or infrastructure to large 
portions of the population” (Buss 2013).
Haiti’s tax system generates limited re-
sources for the government and tends to be 
regressive (figure 1.1). Despite recent im-
provements in tax collection, Haiti col-
lects fewer domestic revenues in terms of 
GDP than comparable countries in the 
Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC). 
Furthermore, Haiti’s tax revenues rely heav-
ily on indirect taxes which affect consumers

independently of their income level. The 
ratio of direct to indirect taxes stood at about 
30 percent in 2011, a level inferior to that of 
most countries in LAC and to the average of

explained by the sizable share of Haiti’s 
 revenues coming from international trade.

differently on economic agents of varying in-
come levels.
Furthermore, social spending remains 
limited and the delivery of basic services 
strongly inequitable. Public spending in 
health, education, and social protection 
amounts to 5 percent of GDP, below com-
parator countries, limiting the government’s 
ability to offer equal opportunities to its citi-
zens. At the same time, many large spending

items such as fuel subsidies clearly favor the 
rich. In this regard, the rise in fuel prices in 
October 2014, as well as the recent decline in 
international oil prices, could be conducive 
to more inclusiveness in public spending. In 
the absence of government, basic services 
such as health and education are mainly pro-
vided by non-government actors. Eighty to 
ninety percent of primary school students 
attend non-public schools, placing a sub-
stantial financial burden on households and 
delivering achievements closely linked with 
household income. Outcomes are equally 
unfavorable to the poor in the health sector : 
in 2012, infant mortality was 62 per 1,000 
live births for the richest quintile compared 
to 104 for the poorest quintile.3
In the absence of public services, non- 
State service providers have stepped in. In 
 response to limited government services, 
foreign assistance—as well as a growing 
number of international non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) since the 1950s—has 
provided a broad range of dispersed public 
services. In many remote rural areas, the 
State has extremely limited delivery capac-
ity, and NGOs provide services to the popu-
lation. Their services are also important 
among the urban poor. In health, about 50 
percent of total health expenditure is pro-
vided by NGOs, which for the most part 
 deliver primary health care services and 
NGOs or private, for-profit institutions run 
over 80 percent of all primary and second-
ary schools. In water and sanitation, while 
the National Water and Sanitation Director-
ate (DINEPA) has greatly improved its pres-
ence in remote rural areas by creating, 
training and supporting local water com-
mittees, interventions are often funded 
through NGOs. These non-state actors are 
largely disconnected from the state system 

and fragmented among themselves, leading 
to highly uneven service provision.
The reliance on non-State actors, par-
ticularly donors, has also weakened  public 
investment management. Haiti’s public in-
vestment management exhibits a number of 
distinctive features and practices common to 
countries that are aid-dependent, including 
weak  appraisal capacity and reliance on do-
nors to design good projects. These hamper 
the effectiveness of public investments 
(box 1.1). While the government’s Strategic 
Development Plan (PSDH) provides broad 
guidance on government priorities, sectoral 
strategies to guide the prioritization of proj-
ects are lacking. This leads to a Public Invest-
ment Program (PIP) composed of projects 
that are neither fully assessed nor prioritized. 
Furthermore, there is no effective ex-ante 
control on disbursements based on projects’ 
physical progress against plans. More impor-
tantly, although progress in fiscal reporting 
is being made by rolling out the use of a sin-
gle treasury account, domestically-funded 
capital expenditures are not yet properly ac-
counted for, tracked and reported, creating 
an environment conducive to a lack of trans-
parency and accountability, as well as to mis-
management of scarce public resources. 
Fi nally, even though the existing legal frame-
work is acceptable for the management of 
public investments, its requirements are 
rarely respected, with numerous processes 
and  procedures that, when not redundant, 
are  excessively elaborate.

BOX 1.1 Common Features of PiM in Donor-Dependent Countries

Public investment management (PIM) systems in donor-dependent settings tend to exhibit the 
following distinctive features:
Investment guidance, project development and preliminary screening: government strategy docu-
ments, such as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), tend to be directed towards the donors, 
rather than covering both external and domestic investment in an integrated and coherent manner. 
They are at a level of generality that limits the extent to which they can provide a basis for prelimi-
nary screening of projects, and are often not supported by effective sector strategies.
Formal project appraisal: there is a reliance on donors to conduct appraisal, with a serious lack of 
appraisal capacity within government; and a lack of guidance on defining the project preparation 
process and on how to appraise domestically-financed projects and PPPs. Donor capacity-building 
on appraisal tends to be agency-specific, with little or no domestic training capacity.
Independent review of appraisal: reflecting reliance on donors, there is a lack of capacity for inde-
pendent review, either of donor projects or domestically-financed projects.
Project selection and budgeting: the budget is divided into a recurrent and a development budget, 
with weak integration between the two and substantial off-budget aid. The use of Public Investment 
Programs (PIPs) remains quite common, but these can be poorly connected to fiscal policy and the 
budget. In practice, a PIP tends to be more a coordination tool than a tool to manage the project port-
folio strategically or to help enforce review of individual project proposals before they can be consid-
ered for budget funding. Agreement by a donor to finance a project is tantamount to the project being 
included in the budget—subject to basic screening for consistency with a PRSP (which is not difficult 
given their generality) and any required counterpart financing being affordable.
Project implementation: unpredictability of donor funding (especially budget support) interrupts 
project implementation due to lack of alternative financing. Weak project management capacity 
induces donors to set up multiple Project Implementation Units (PIUs) within implementing 
agencies that initially help to speed implementation and compliance with fiduciary standards, 
but which cut across and negatively impact on in-line capacities and accounting and reporting 
systems. Procurement is undertaken by PIUs or donors to donor standards rather than national 
procurement standards.
Project adjustment: reliance on donors to trigger review of any projects that are off-track. No simi-
lar mechanism for domestically-financed projects.
Facility operation: formal hand-over procedures on completion of donor projects, but inadequate 
asset registration systems; and inadequate funding for operations and maintenance, in part due to 
weak integration of recurrent costs of donor projects in fiscal policy and budgets.
Basic completion review and evaluation: reliance on donors to undertake reviews and evaluations of 
their projects. Otherwise, little or no systematic basic post-project review, let alone evaluation, and 
little systematic use made of findings from donor evaluations to  improve future project design and 
implementation.

known—was considered the world’s richest 
and most productive colony. It was also re-
puted to be the most violent, with the ma-
jority of its population working as slaves 
in plantat ions (Acemog lu and Robinson 
2012 ; Dubois 2013). Brutal punishments 
were common , and slaves died at stagger-
ing rates . In 1804 , Hait i emerged from 
13  years of revolut ion as the second nat ion 
in the Western Hemisphere to attain inde-
pendence from a European colonia l power 
(after the United States) .
Independence did not lead, however, to 
the development of inclusive institutions. 
The country’s successful revolt left the new 
 republic isolated on the international stage, 
as evidenced by the early lack of diplomatic 
recognition from Europe and the United 
States. This had a negative impact on the 
willingness of foreigners to invest in Haiti. 
It is also argued that there were insufficient 
checks and balances on the power of post- 
independence leaders who set themselves 
up as a new elite, exploiting Haiti’s people 
through the very means as the French had 
earlier. Furthermore, to gain recognition, 
Haiti had to agree to compensate France for 
the property losses faced by colonial plant-
ers during Haiti’s revolution (1791–1804). 
Payments began in 1825 and only stopped 
122 years later, in 1947, draining the econ-
omy of much needed capital.
An elite, often of foreign descent, build 
important economic interests. Beginning in 
the mid-nineteenth century, Haiti’s economy 
had grown increasingly dependent on im-
ports, and wealth was accumulating in the 
families of importers. With looser restric-
tions on foreign merchants in the mid-1840s, 
migrants primarily from Britain, France and 
Germany began to establish themselves on 
the island to meet the demand for European 

goods. The migrants typically stayed in Haiti 
as resident aliens to maintain the protection 
of foreign governments, but often married 
into elite Haitian society to circumvent re-
strictions on foreign ownership of Haitian 
property (Plummer 1988). These families 
of mixed Haitian and European descent 
were followed beginning in the 1890s by 
Syrian and Lebanese immigrants. By the 
early turn of last century, these immigrants 
owned the major trading houses, as well as 
transportation and communication systems 
(Plummer 1988).
From the beginning of the twentieth 
centur y, autocratic leaders in Haiti have 
traded politica l suppor t from the elite for 
economic advantages to this elite. Dur ing 
the 1910s, presidents began f loating do-
mest ic loans that were largely subscr ibed 
by the foreign commercial community 
(Rotb e rg 197 1 ) . P lumm e r (198 8 ) w r i te s 
t h at “merchant-bankers had to cooperate 
with of f icia l requests for funds if they 
wished to continue conducting business 
unhindered, but they were frequent ly re-
warded for their pains by favors at the cus-
tomhouses.” François Duvalier (‘Papa Doc’) 
continued this tradition of cutting dea ls 
with the economic elite. In 1958, for in-
stance, fol lowing a f irst abor tive coup at-
tempt, Duva lier demanded “displays of 
loya lty—especia l ly from wea lthy business-
men, who made the f irst of many specia l 
contr ibutions to the defense of the rea lm” 
(Rotberg 1971). The practice was contin-
ued in the early 1960s, when Haiti was si-
mu ltaneously hit by an economic slump 
and cut of f from U.S. aid. “Foreign-owned 
companies and men of wea lth with impor-
tant stakes in the country shared the  burden: 
they were encouraged to contr ibute to the 
stabi lity of the regime by subscr ibing to 

14

nationa l bonds, government lotter ies” 
(Rotberg 1971).
In return, statutory monopolies and ex-
clusivities were usually granted for coopera-
tive economic elites. A long list of industries 
 became monopolies by presidential decree 
during the 1950s and 1960s: “mineral and 
petroleum exploration and exploitation, the 
construction and operation of television 
stations, the planting and processing of ses-
ame, the processing of guano, the manufac-
ture of  chocolate, a fertilizer industry, the 
development of casinos and hotels, the con-
struction of a sugar factory, the improve-
ment of the telephone system…” (Rotberg 
1971). By 1985, some 19 families held al-
most exclusive rights to import many of 
the most commonly consumed products 
in Haiti, as detailed in table 1.1. Another 
twenty to thirty families held import  licenses 
for another 92 items (Fass 1990). Though 
publicly available information on privately 
held businesses is limited and import quotas 
has been dismantled, many of the same elite 
families who dominated the Haitian econ-
omy during the era of Duvalier in the 1970s 
remain in control of large segments of the 
economy today.
Against this backdrop, the structure of 
the private sector shows signs of high de-
grees of concentration, hampering the 
entr y of new actors. The established private 
sector is dominated by a number of fami-
lies, resulting in high concentration in a 
number of key industries, distorted compe-
tition, and non-transparent business prac-
tices in many instances. In practice, this 
translates into limited opportunities for a 
substantial expansion of the  formal private 
sector across most sectors. Few of Haiti’s 
established private firms have modern 
 capital and governance structures with 

professional management, limiting their 
access to long-term financing.
The open institutions needed to create a 
level playing field for economic actors and 
underpin a rule of law based on impersonal 
exchanges have not emerged. To prosper, 
economies need institutional arrangements 
to resolve disputes among firms, citizens, 
and governments, to clarify ambiguities in 
laws and regulations, and to enforce compli-
ance (World Bank 1998). A State needs to 
use its coercive power to enforce property 
rights at low cost without abusing it and 
 exploiting its citizens in order to develop 
mechanisms to enforce effectively imper-
sonal agreements (North 2010).4 In such 
agreements, an economic operator’s decision 
to transact is independent of his partner’s 
personal past history. It is made without 
knowledge of that partner’s past conduct, 
or the expectation of future transaction with 
him or her, or the ability to report miscon-
duct to future trading partners (Greif 2006). 
In particular, mechanisms of arbitration are 
required to settle possible disputes between 
traders and ensure contract enforcement. 
The inability of the Haitian State to manage 
its power appropriately has not allowed the 
emergence of these mechanisms and the es-
tablished private sector had little incentive to 
create a level playing field that would have 
primarily favored new entrants.
In the absence of effective contract en-
forcement, economic operators tend to re-
main within their family or social networks. 
Without effective legal systems making low 
cost enforcement of contracts possible, 
 operators have to rely on personal knowl-
edge, reputation, or the possibility of some 
form of retaliation in selecting their busi-
ness  partners. Family, ethnic or social net-
works have been shown to be able to impose

effective informal sanctions and enforce con-
tracts in weak institutional environments, 
and thereby foster economic transactions 
that would  otherwise not take place (Greif 
1989, 1993; Rauch 2001). Empirically, the 
presence of migrant networks, for instance, 
has been shown to compensate for the lack 
of good  institutions and is associated with 
greater  international trade (Ehrhart et al. 
2014). While these relationships are useful, 
they are not conducive to greater inclusion. 
This  social organization tends to undermine 
collective action by providing alternative, 
non- collective avenues for ensuring individ-
ual and family survival.
As a result, competition is perceived as 
low in Haiti. According to the Global Com-
petitiveness Report of 2014–15, Haiti ranks 
low in terms of competition: Haiti ranks 140th 
out of 148 countries in terms of intensity of 
local competition and ranks 140th in terms 
of extent of market dominance (a high rank 

indicates few firms dominate key markets) 
(figure 1.2). This suggests that in Haiti, prices, 
availability and quality of goods and services 
are perceived to be determined by a small 
number of firms rather than by market mech-
a nisms and that these incumbent firms ap-
pear to face little competitive pressure from 
new entrants or smaller domestic firms. This 
situation could be the result of high legal or 
behavioral entry barriers in the market that 
prevent new competitors from participating 
in key markets. These market structures 
could facilitate tacit agreements among fami-
lies/groups to allocate markets among them-
selves, which may harm productivity and 
incentive to innovate.
Weak competition contributes to a high 
degree of operational business risk. Accord-
ing to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s op-
erational risk model (2013), investors in 
Haiti perceive that the risks associated with 
discriminatory policies favoring

incumbents and unfair business practices 
are higher than in other countries in the 
 Caribbean region and only comparable to 
those in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicara-
gua (figure 1.3). The sources of these risks 
are mainly related to: a) pr ice control and 
the control of other market variables that 
both limit the benefits that firms could ob-
tain by competing effectively and harm the 
incentives to invest; and b) vested interest 
and discrimination against foreign firms 
that appear to play the most important role 
in generating distortions of the level-playing 
field, hinder innovation, and preclude more 
efficient firms from competitively gaining 
market shares.

Trade data seem to confirm these per-
ceptions about limited competition. Ac-
cording to a produc t market concentrat ion 
ana lys is based on available import data 
(see box 1 .2) , Hait i impor ts most of its 
f ina l produc ts and most of the impor ted 
goods so ld in Hait i are provided by few 
large firms. About 70 percent of total im-
ports in value are in goods whose markets 
are either high ly or moderately concen-
trated according to common thresholds 
used by the U.S . Depar tment of Just ice and 
Federal Trade Commission ( figure 1.4). 
While market concentration is not unusual 
given the size of the economy, high and 
stable market shares (above 40–50 percent 
of the market) may increase the potential 
risks of firm abusive behavior with negative 
impact on consumers. Highly concentrated 
product markets (representing around 40 
percent of imports with a Herfindahl- 
Hirschman Index [HHI] exceeding 2,500) 
include petroleum, food and consumer 
goods markets (telephone sets, motorcy-
cles). Imported goods in moderately con-
centrated markets (representing another 30 
percent of imports with an HHI between 
1,500 and 2,500) include food, consumer 
goods (electric generating sets, motor 
 vehicles) and cement.
The concentrated nature of the Haitian 
market may be leading to higher consumer 
prices. The market analysis aims at detect-
ing the market characteristics that favor 
the existence of market power and its po-
tential risks in terms of abusive practices. 
For instance, the r isk of potent ia l ant icom-
pet it ive behavior g iven high market con-
centrat ion may translate into high prices 
for consumers, which may be particularly 
damaging in Haiti where more than half of 
the population lives on less than US$2 per

BOX 1.2 Product Market Concentration analysisa

An analysis of product market concentration was conducted jointly between the World Bank and 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Haiti with the collaboration of a team of 
researchers from Harvard and Columbia Universities.
The analysis was based on Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHI), calculated using customs im-
port data based on the Harmonized Coding System (HS) disaggregated at a four-digit level. The 
HS is a multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs 
Organization.
The HHI is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration based on market share esti-
mates for each firm in the market. It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm com-
peting in a market (showing the relative space they occupy in the specific market being analyzed), 
and then summing up the resulting numbers for the fifty largest firms (or overall firms if the indus-
try counts fewer than fifty companies). The HHI is preferred to other concentration measures (such 
as concentration ratio) because it accounts for the heterogeneity in the size of the firms in the mar-
ket, giving more weight to larger firms.
The HHI can range from close to zero to 10,000. The closer a market is to being a monopoly the 
higher the HHI. If, for example, there was only one firm in an industry (a monopolist), that firm 
would have 100 percent market share, and the HHI would be equal to 10,000 (100^2). Conversely, 
if there were thousands of firms competing in an industry, each firm would have nearly 0 percent 
market share, and the HH index would be close to zero.
For the purpose of this analysis, the concentration levels based on the Horizontal Merger 
Guidelines (U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission) were used. As such, three 
HHI levels help identify the characteristics of product market concentration:
•	 Unconcentrated Markets: HHI below 1,500.
•	 Moderately Concentrated Markets: HHI between 1,500 and 2,500.
•	 Highly Concentrated Markets: HHI above 2,500.

a. Based on a background paper prepared for the SCD jointly by the World Bank (Georgiana Pop, Tanja Goodwin, Martha Martinez 
Licetti, Lucia Villaran, and Joaquin Zentner) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Jimy Dorsainvil, Clifford Reginald Nau, Edward

day. Several of the most important food 
products in the Haitian consumption bas-
ket are sold in concentrated markets. A 
preliminar y analysis over time of prices for 
such products seems to suggest that on av-
erage, prices in Haiti are approximately 
30–60 percent higher than in other coun-
tries from the LAC region, even taking 
into account dif ferences in income levels 
and purchasing power of the population, 

as well as the cost to import containers and 
import tarif f levels (see appendix A for 
further details).5

government instability. At Independence in 
1804, Haiti was at the forefront of histor y, 
being the first nation to abolish slaver y. 
Since then, however, w ith some except ions 
such as of the 30-year per iod of autocrat ic 
ru le under Francois Duvalier (Papa Doc) 
and his son Jean-C laude Duva l ie r (B aby 
Do c ) (1957–86), Hait i has known a suc-
cession of shor t-lived governments. 
Lacking sufficiently long periods of stabil-
ity, the countr y has struggled to develop 
the institutional mechanisms and policy 
fundamentals essential to economic 
development.

The past decade has been nevertheless 
comparatively stable. Over the past ten years, 
with security provided by a large United 
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MI-
NUSTAH), two presidents have been chosen 
by election and the current President, Michel 
Martelly, was the first to accede to the Presi-
dency by election from a party in the opposi-
tion. However, stability remains fragile, 
with frequent changes in government and 
 repeated delays in electoral calendars. Such 
delays led to the lapsing of Parliament in 
 January 2015, leaving the executive to try to 
broker a deal with the opposition and agree

on a transitional government who would or-
ganize elections.
The distribution of resources seems to 
feed grievances. From the early days of inde-
pendence until the end of the nineteenth 
century, almost all of Haiti’s heads of state 
granted land to the military and to high pro-
file civil servants, stripping peasants of their 
land rights (Dubois 2013). As a result of this 
history, calls for and conflicts over land re-
distribution repeatedly emerge as a source of 
instability and uncertainty, with serious con-
sequences for growth. Many observers agree 
that Haitians perceive political and economic 
disputes as a zero sum game with only win-
ners and losers, each with very long 
memories.
Grievances lead to conflicts. Distribu-
tional conflicts arguably have as a corollary 
inhibited the development of social capital 
and hampered the building of trust within 
Haitian society further preventing agreement 
across groups and the emergence of social 
cohesion at the national level. Disenfran-
chised and without effective channels to 
voice needs and demands, citizens have 
taken to the streets in protest, sometimes 
 violently. The Bank’s 1998 Poverty Report 
noted “the absence of a culture of democratic 
decision making and peaceful consensus 
building … has generated tensions…and 
hampered Haiti’s rehabilitation effort.” While 
violent airing of grievances in Haiti’s early 
history generally took place in the rural 
areas, contemporary unrest tends to break 
out in the cities, reflecting the country’s de-
mographic evolution and urbanization over 
the years.
Violence in turn hampers economic op-
portunities. A report on governance and so-
cial justice in the Caribbean (Dollar 2000) 
argued that Haiti is an “extreme case of a 

country caught in a vicious circle in which 
unemployment, inequality, and poor educa-
tion feed into lawlessness and violence, 
making it difficult for the economy to grow 
and create jobs, thus perpetuating unem-
ployment and inequality.” For instance, the 
political turmoil of the late 1980s and 1990s, 
coupled with a US embargo, severely de-
pressed Haiti’s exports. Exports of assem-
bled electronic goods virtually disappeared 
and never recovered. External aid flows 
have also been highly volatile, responding 
to political events. All of these elements 
have negatively affected employment of a 
very young, and increasingly urbanized and 
disenfranchised population, the level of 
public investments, and the overall sustain-
ability of the social and political situation in 
the country.

Natural Disasters

The Haitian population is one of the most 
exposed in the world to natural disasters—
hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.6 Haiti 
has a higher number of disasters per km2 
than the average of the Caribbean countries 
(table 1.2). In 2008, tropical storms and hur-
ricanes caused losses estimated at 15 percent 
of GDP. The earthquake on January 12, 2010 
killed 220,000 people, displaced 1.5 million 
people, and destroyed the equivalent of 120 
percent of GDP. These disasters tend to affect 
disproportionally the poorest and marginal 
pop u lations settling in flood zones and 
coastal areas, in particular in the case of 
tropical storms where almost 50 percent of 
damages and losses to the productive sectors 
have been concentrated in the agricultural 
sector.7 Overall, based on available historic 
data, weather-related disasters are estimated 
to have caused damages and losses

amounting to about 2 percent of GDP on av-

Moreover, the ef fec ts of these natura l 
disasters are much larger in Hait i, indicat-
ing higher vu lnerabi lity and inst itut iona l 
weaknesses . Whi le Hait i appears to be 
somewhat more exposed to natura l haz-
ards than some countr ies in the Car ib-
bean , it is a lso more vu lnerable . Even 
when the ear thquake of 2010 is excluded 
from the statistics, the numb e r o f c a su a l -
t ie s to the popu l at ion i s ver y large, simi-
lar only to Honduras and Nicaragua 
(table 1.2). In Haiti, population density and 
lack of coping capacity have translated into 
large numbers of people affected by natural 
disasters  (figure 1.5). In this regard, the 
comparison between Haiti and the Domin-
ican Republic, both sharing the same is-
land, is instructive. The number of 
weather-related disasters from 1971 to 
2014 has been more than double in Haiti 
than in the Dominican Republic, mostly 

because Haiti experienced more than twice 
as many f loods, as a consequence of a 
storm, and three times the number of 
drought periods than the Dominican Re-
public. Floods are one of the most com-
mon weather-related events that affect 
Haiti and are partly related to the countr y’s 
severe deforestation. Haiti’s greater vulner-
ability is ref lected in the consequences of 
these events in terms of losses, both 
human and economic, ref lecting the inade-
quacy of drainage, large populations set-
tling in f lood zones, and the lack of sound 
buildings or building codes.

Migration

In this unfavorable environment, mi-
gration has become a key avenue for Haitians 
seeking a better life. Substantial internal mi-
gration is taking place, particularly from 
rural to urban areas, as people seek better 
economic opportunities and better services.

In addition, for both political and economic 
reasons, large numbers of Haitians have emi-
grated throughout the twentieth century 
building an important diaspora (figure 1.6). 
A vast majority of Haitians who continue to 
emigrate now seem to do so because they 
cannot find work opportunities in Haiti 
Orozco (2006). They move mostly to the 
United States, the Dominican Republic, 
 Canada and France  (figure 1.7).9 According 
to the Global Bilateral Migration Matrix, one 
million Haitians were estimated to be living 
abroad in 2010. About 540,000 of those 
were in the United States, 280,000 in the

This large diaspora is a source of signifi-
cant remittances. Remittances received by 
Haiti represent a large share of GDP, the 
 largest share among LAC countries, and the 
fourth highest in the world in terms of export 
earnings (figure 1.8). For every year in the 
period 2000–09, remittances were larger 
than official development assistance (ODA), 
foreign direct investment (FDI) and the total 
exports of goods and services ( figure 1.9).12 
 Despite the sharp increase in development 
assistance in the year after the earthquake, 
in 2012, remittances once again surpassed de-
velopment assistance, representing the equiv-
alent of 20.4 percent of GDP vs. 16.1 percent 

of GDP for ODA, 13.2 percent of GDP for ex-
ports and 2 percent of GDP for FDI.
Remittances are, however, predominantly 
an urban phenomenon and migrants tend to 
be better educated. Emigration is relatively 
costly and accessible mainly to urban and 
wealthier families. While for the country as 
a whole, about a third of all households re-
ceive remittances, this share reaches over 35 
percent for urban households and drops to 
20 percent for households in rural areas. 
 Migrants tend also to be better educated, 
representing an important “brain drain.”13 
Overall, the profile of Haitian migrants 
is ver y simi lar to those of the average 
 Car ibbean migrant. However, individua ls 
with advanced education represent only 3

percent of Haitians with a college degree 
currently live outside of the country.14
Remittances have tended to f inance the 
consumpt ion of foreign goods . Remit-
tances represent an impor tant source of

Limited Data

There is limited evidence to inform 
 planning and targeting of programs and 
policies. According to the Statistical 
Capacity Indicator (SCI), a composite index 

that takes into account statistical methodol-
ogy, source data and periodicity, Haiti 
ranks below comparator countries (figure 
1.13). As a result and despite the progress 
that has resulted from surveys such as the 
Demographic and Hea lth  Survey (MSPP, 
IHE, and ICF International 1994, 2000, 
2006, 2013), Haiti is still characterized by 
a dearth of data and  reliable statistics. The 
census is being  continuously delayed, for 
 instance. Notwithstanding improvement in

recent years data provision has ser ious 
shor tcomings that severely hamper IMF 
sur vei l lance (IMF 2014a). The most af-
fected areas are the nationa l accounts, f is-
ca l data, and externa l sector statistics. In 
par ticu lar, constant pr ice GDP data are 
sti l l being  published using a base year of 
1986–87, which does not adequately re-
f lect the structura l economic changes re-
su lting from the var ious civi l conf licts 
and natura l disasters Haiti has experienced 
over the recent decades, and thus intro-
duce major uncertainty in policy analysis. 
Equally problematic are estimates of the 
 informal sector and no labor statistics are 
disseminated.

Notes

 1. Haiti has 
traditionally enjoyed substan-
tial preferential market access to the United 
States and Canada, but has not succeeded in 
fully exploiting this advantage. For exam-
ple, the country has not been able to fill its 
quota for exports to the United States under 
the Hemispheric Opportunities 
through 
Partnership Encouragement II (HOPE II) 
initiative or under the Haiti Economic Lift 
Program (HELP) Act. These laws allow Haiti 
to assemble textiles, whatever the origin of the 
imported fabrics, and to export them to the 
United States duty free and tax free but are due 
to end in 2020, unless renewed.
 2. For a discussion on the policies needed to 
greater inclusion, see for instance Narayan, 
Chanduvi, and Tiwari (2013).
 3. MSPP, IHE, and ICF International 2013.
 4. For an example of how such institutions 
could  develop, see Greif (1989, 1993, 2006). 
The study compares the evolving structure of 
political and economic institutions of Genoese 
traders, which ultimately provided the essential 
institutions for impersonal exchange, and the 
practice of the Mahgribi (Jewish merchants but 
in a Muslim culture), who fail to make the nec-
essary institutional adjustments and lose out in 
the competitive trade of the Mediterranean.
 5. The availability of data to carry out a simi-
lar exercise for LICs is limited, but including 
Kenya and Mauritius in the sample suggests 
that prices in Haiti are 35–50 percent higher.
 6. From 1993 to 2012, Haiti has experienced 
two  droughts, one earthquake, 31 floods and 
26 tropical storms/hurricanes.

Needs Assessments (PDNAs).
 8. Estimations based on EM-DAT and existing 
Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNAs). 
According to the probabilistic model used by 
the CCRIF, tropical cyclones cause an esti-
mated US$118 million in damages each year, 
which is equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP for 
2013, while earthquake-related damages aver-
age US$26 million each year (0.31 percent of 
GDP in 2013). The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk 

Insurance Facility (CCRIF) is a joint reserve 
mechanism that allows member countries, 
including Haiti, to quickly access liquidity for 
infrequent, high-impact disasters. The proba-
bilistic model used by the CCRIF to calculate 
insurance premiums offered to the countries 
and reinsurance markets is the MPRES model 
developed by the Kinanco firm: http://www.ki-
nanco.com.
 9. For a more detailed discussion on these flows 
see Orozco (2006) and Jadotte (2008).
 10. Extrapolation from older data and migrant 
flows suggest that the actual number of 
Haitians living in the Dominican Republic 
should be between 380,000 and 500,000 
(Wooding and Moseley-Williams 2004).
 11. For details on the methodology of the esti-
mates see Ratha and Shaw (2007).
 12. All data for remittances and GDP aggregates are 
from the World Development Indicators (WDI).
 13. For more evidence on the education attain-
ment of Haitians migrants in the US (in the 
city of NY, more specifically), see the survey 
on remittance senders discussed in Orazco 
(2006).
 14. This estimate considers the share of col-
lege-educated residents 
from ECVMAS 
2012; OECD data for education attain-
ment of  migrants as of 2010–2011 and es-
timates for education of Haitians living in 
the Dominican Republic. Niimi and Ozden 
(2006), based on data from Docquier and 
Marfouk (2006) and Barro and Lee (2000), 
reported that 80 percent of Haiti born peo-
ple with college degrees lived abroad as of 
2000. This result is driven by the estimates 
that only 0.7 percent of Haiti residents had 
college degree in that year.
 15. Econometric analyses carried out for the 2014 
Poverty Assessment tend to show that a 10 
percent increase in remittances would be asso-
ciated with an 8–13 percent increase in spend-
ing on education and health, and a 5 percent 
increase in food expenditures.
 16. An estimated 60 percent of food consumed in 
Haiti is imported.

Country Profile

2. Trends and Profile in Poverty and 
Shared Prosperity1

Trends

Recent findings would suggest that ex-
treme poverty has declined in Haiti over the 
past decade (figure 2.1). Extreme poverty 
decreased in Haiti from 31 percent in 2000 
to 24 percent in 2012 (World Bank and 
ONPES 2014).2 Progress was mainly concen-
trated in urban areas, however. The share of 
extreme poor has declined from 21 percent 
to 12 percent and from 20 percent to 5 per-
cent in other urban and metropolitan areas, 
respectively, while it has stagnated in rural 
areas.3 This trend is confirmed by both mon-
etary and non-monetary poverty indicators, 
with the biggest non-monetary progress 
recorded in education (table 2.1). All school-
age children go now to school in about 90 
percent of the households compared to 
about 80 percent in 2001. Immunization 
rates are also up. While data is not available 
to assess trends in moderate consumption 
poverty, it is also expected to have improved 
in the last decade.
Poverty remains, however, endemic in 
Haiti and varies widely. Haiti is the poorest 
country in Latin America and among the 
poorest in the world in terms of per capita 
GDP and human development.4 The overall 
poverty headcount amounts to about 59 per-
cent and extreme poverty to 24 percent in 
2012, indicating that almost 6.3 million 
Haitians cannot meet their basic needs and 
2.5 million cannot even cover food needs.5 
Geographically, poverty and extreme poverty 
are considerably higher in rural areas. More 
than 80 percent of the extreme poor live in 

rural areas, where 38 percent of the popula-
tion is not able to satisfy its nutritional needs, 
compared to 12 percent in urban areas and 5 
percent in metropolitan areas (i.e., the capital 
city). The poorest regions are the furthest 
from the capital city and the most isolated. 
The poorest departments are geographically 
concentrated in the northern region of the 
country where the extreme poverty rate ex-
ceeds 40 percent in the North East and North 
West, compared to 5 percent in metropolitan 
area of Port- au-Prince (map 2.1).
Furthermore, income inequality is the 
highest in the region and has widened in 
rural areas. The Gini coefficient stagnated at 
about 0.6 between 2001 and 2012. This re-
sult hides, however, important regional dis-
parities: while inequality widened in rural 
areas (from 0.49 to 0.56), it narrowed in 
urban areas (from 0.64 to 0.59). Preliminary 
evidence would suggest that increases in 
labor income and private transfers could 
have contributed to the narrowing of in-
equality in urban areas. On the other hand, 
the contraction in agricultural production 
caused by  repeated weather-related shocks 
could explain the widening of inequality in 
rural areas, reducing earnings for agricul-
tural labor and increasing the prices of food, 
both factors affecting the poorest dispropor-
tionately. As a result, in 2012 the top one 
percent of the population lived on almost 
50 times the resources of the bottom 10 per-
cent.6 This result makes Haiti the most un-
equal country in Latin America and one of 
the most unequal in the world.

a. According to the international definition (WHO), access to improved drinking water is the proportion of people using improved drinking 
water sources: household connection, public standpipe, borehole, protected dug well, protected spring, rainwater.
b. The expanded definition includes the international definition (WHO), plus treated water (purchased).
c. Includes electricity, solar, and generators.
d. Rate of open defecation refers to the proportion of individuals who do not have access to improved or unimproved sanitation. 
This indicator is part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and is a key element of discussion for the post-2015 agenda.
e. Improved sanitation is access to a flush toilet or an improved public or private latrine.

Despite improvements in access to basic 
services since 2001, the poor still face sig-
nificantly larger barriers. Poverty is an im-
portant barrier to both school enrollment 
and health service utilization, for instance. 
According to the most recent household 
survey, cost is the main reason for keeping 
children out of school or not consulting a 
doctor if they are sick in 83 percent and 49 
percent of cases,  respectively.7 As a result, in 
2012, while 87 percent of 6- to 14-year-olds 
in poor households were in school, this ratio 
reached 96 percent for non-poor house-
holds. In turn, this more limited access to 
education perpetuates poverty : the poor live 
in households in which the heads have an 
average of three times fewer years of educa-
tion, and as many as 61 percent of the heads 
of poor households are illiterate, compared 

with 34 percent among non-poor house-
holds (table 2.2). The poorest also have lim-
ited access to maternal health services and 
are more likely to die during delivery, with 
fewer than one woman in ten in the lowest 
quintile benefitting from assisted delivery 
(compared to seven out of ten among the 
better off ).8 These obstacles are even greater 
in rural areas, where the supply of services 
is more limited.
Most of the poor work, but their earn-
ings are insufficient to lift them out of pov-
erty. Almost 70 percent of poor households 
have heads holding jobs (against 73 percent 
among the non-poor). However, among 
the former, 61 percent work in agriculture, 
where average earnings are less than 20 
percent of the earnings in the formal sector. 
Among the remainder, 35 percent work in

the informal sector, where earnings are less 
than half those in the formal sector. As a 
 result, more than half of poor households 
undertake two or more income generating 
activities. This underscores the urgent need 
to create higher labor productivity jobs.
The poor suffer from poor nutrition early 
in life and from food insecurity. Food insecu-
rity is significant in Haiti, at 28 percent na-
tionwide and 34 percent in rural areas.9 Poor 
household members are much more likely to 
report frequent hunger or lack of food at bed 
time relative to members of nonpoor house-
holds ( figure 2.2). Households with children 
under the age of 5 are much more likely to 

experience repeated food shortages World 
Bank and ONPES (2014). As a result, one-
fifth of under-5-year-olds are chronically mal-
nourished (MSPP, IHE, and ICF International 
2013). This is a particular cause of concern 
because proper nutrition in early life is crucial 
for brain development and subsequent life 
outcomes (Alderman and King 2006).
The poor in Hait i are par t icu larly vu l-
nerable and access to soc ia l safety nets is 
l im ited. A typica l Hait ian household faces 
mu lt iple shocks annua l ly : nearly 75 per-

poverty are even more vulnerable, particu-
larly those in extreme poverty : among poor 
households, 95 percent experience at least 
one economically damaging shock per year. 
The poor and vulnerable have limited access 
to public support, given the low capacity of 
the State.10 Most assistance arrives to them in 
the form of remittances or support from 
churches, other nongovernmental institu-
tions, and donors. Despite recent efforts to 
expand social assistance provision under the 
EDE PÈP framework since 2013, the pro-
grams remain too fragmented, too small, and 
not targeted enough to make a significant 
difference. The majority of the poor continue 
to lack access to formal safety nets that could 
allow them to smooth their consumption 
over time, prevent irreversible loss of human 
capital, and avoid destitution.
Coping strategies perpetuate poverty. In 
the absence of formal instruments to manage 
risk effectively, the poorest households are 

unable to cope with shocks and adopt coping 
strategies that damage human capital. 
Overall, 23 percent of households in extreme 
poverty changed their nutritional profile in 
response to a major shock. In particular, if 
the shock hits the entire community, a stag-
gering 56 percent of households in extreme 
poverty change their nutritional behavior, as 
opposed to 37 percent of resilient households. 
The extreme poor are also more likely to re-
move their children from school, particularly 
if the household is experiencing a change in 
composition (such as the birth or death of a 
household member) or a decline in the mon-
etary support from outside the household, 
which is often used to pay school fees.
Women and girls are particularly vulner-
able. Although poverty does not differ by 
gender, despite sizable progress in both edu-
cation and health outcomes, adult women 
are still less well educated than adult men 
and are more likely to be illiterate. Their use 
of health services is also still very limited. 
Women in Haiti are also significantly less 
likely to be employed and earn significantly 
less than men (box 2.1). Finally,   gender-based 
violence and low participation in the public 
sphere are widespread in Haiti.

Drivers

Recent findings suggest that the decline 
in extreme poverty was partly driven by 
 rising non-agricultural labor income. Labor 
income increased by about 3½ percent on 
average per year, especially among men. 
GDP data suggest that the sectors that grew 
the most over the recent past were construc-
tion, telecommunication and transport, all 
concentrated in urban areas, partly explain-
ing the improvements of urban living con-
ditions. As a result, employment probably

bOX 2.1 gender inequalities in Haiti

Women and girls in Haiti still face greater obstacles to attend school. Despite progress in school en-
rollment among younger cohorts, adult women are still worse educated than adult men and are more 
likely to be illiterate. Adult men have, on average, two more years of education than women and are 
over 10 percentage points more likely to be literate. Early withdrawal from school can have lifelong 
consequences. Underage marriage and teen pregnancy, for instance, represent additional risks for 
girls who do not attend school: 17 percent of Haitian women are married in adolescence, compared 
with 2 percent of men, this number dropping among girls with higher education (Cicmil 2013).
They deal with greater health challenges. Maternal mortality, at 380 deaths per 100,000 live births, is still 
five times higher than the regional average (WHO 2014)a, partly because a high percentage of birth de-
liveries take place outside a health care facility (65 percent). Poor nutrition is a threat for both children 
and mothers: according to the MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 22 percent of children are 
stunted or too short for their age, while nearly half of women aged 15–49 have anemia. The prevalence 
of HIV/AIDS is higher among women (2.7 percent) than men (1.7 percent), reflecting both knowledge 
differentials among other factors: only 15 percent of young women have correct information on how to 
prevent sexual HIV transmission compared to 28 percent of young men (Boesten and Poku 2009).
Women are significantly disadvantaged in the labor market. Holding constant several social and de-
mographic characteristics, one finds that women are 20 percentage points more likely than men to 
be unemployed and, if working, 6 percentage points more likely to be in the informal sector. Wages 
among women are also 32 percent lower than wages among men. Over two-thirds of this difference 
is unexplained by observable characteristics, suggesting that discrimination could play a role.
Gender-based violence is widespread. Gender-based violence is a chronic problem: according to the 
MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 13 percent of Haitian women have experienced sexual vio-
lence, and 29 percent of women who have ever been married have experienced spousal violence, 
whether emotional, physical, or sexual. Vulnerability is particularly high among internally displaced 
people in camps and areas affected by the 2010 earthquake: a survey in 2011 indicated that 64 percent 
of interviewed pregnant adolescent girls had become pregnant after being raped (PotoFi 2012).
Female participation in the public sphere is low. Only 4 percent of all parliamentary seats were occupied 
by women in the most recent legislature, placing Haiti well below the regional average of 26 percent and 
among the countries with the lowest rate (136th out of 142 countries). At the national level, as of April 
2014, 8 of 23 ministers and 3 of 20 secretaries of state were women.b At the local level, women account 
for only 12 percent of all mayors. The government has taken steps to expand women’s representation, 
including by creating the Gender Equality Office in Parliament and amending the Constitution to stip-
ulate a quota of at least 30 percent women in all public offices, but enforcement is problematic.

a. This number is not recognized by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP).

experienced a structural shift over this pe-
riod towards non-agriculture activities, con-
tributing to better living standards: the 
average monthly salaries in the formal or 
informal sectors are two to four times 

higher than in the agricultural sector 
(ECVMAS, 2012).11
Most of the labor force remains em-
ployed in the agriculture and urban infor-
mal sectors. Reliable data on employment

in Haiti are scarce. Available employment 
and household sur veys would suggest, nev-
ertheless, that since 2007 the share of for-
mal employment in total employment has 
increased by about 3 percentage points, 
driven mainly by jobs in the administra-
tion and NGOs (f igure 2.3).12 Despite this 
expansion , forma l employment remains 
sma l l with agr icu lture and urban  informa l 
sectors st i l l providing most of the emp loy -
ment w ith about 40 p ercent and 47  per-
cent of the labor marke t , respec t ive ly 
( f igures 2 .4 and 2 .5) . 13 Wh i le wages have 
tended to increase in the small formal sec-
tor over that period, they have stagnated in 
agriculture and in the informal sector, and 
overall 70 percent of workers still earn less 
than the minimum wage.
The persistence of rural poverty reflects 
households’ reliance on a low-performing 
agricultural sector. Rural livelihoods are 

highly dependent on agriculture: almost 
80 percent of households engage in farming. 
Moreover, for half the households, farming 
is the sole economic activity. Unfortunately, 
the returns to agriculture are low and unreli-
able, and the activity resembles a subsistence 
 strateg y rather than reliance on a produc-
t ive economic sector.14 Labor product ivity 
is par t icu larly low among the poor with 
on ly 20 percent of them using fer t i lizers 
and pest icides. Moreover, even though the 
area of cultivated land is only slightly 
smaller among the poor than among the 
non-poor (1.2 hectares versus 1 .6 hec tares , 
respec t ively) , the poor spend two to four 
t imes less on fer t i lizers , pest icides , seeds , 
and labor. Increased produc t iv ity is cor-
related to greater access and use of inputs, 
as well as crop diversification for both poor 
and non-poor agricultural households 
(World Bank and ONPES 2014).

Participation in the nonfarm sector would 
seem critical to emerge from poverty in rural 
Haiti. Engaging in the nonfarm  sector in 
rural areas reduces the probability of being 
poor by 10 percentage points. The typical 
nonfarm job in rural areas is a one- or 
two-person shop engaged in small retail. 
Although still low paying, this type of activity 
yields better returns than those accruing to 
farming. About 40 percent of non-poor 
households participate in the nonfarm sector, 
a participation rate that is 1.5 times higher 
than the participation rate among the poor.
Private transfers and international aid, 
have also contributed to the decrease in pov-
erty. The percentage of households receiving 

private transfers (domestic transfers or remit-
tances from abroad) in Haiti increased from 
42 percent to 69 percent between 2000 and 
2012. Workers’ transfers from abroad have 
represented more than a fifth of Haiti’s GDP 
in recent years, and originate mainly from the 
United States and the Dominican Republic 
(DR). While remittance flows from the U.S. 
are larger, transfers from the DR are more 
likely to reduce poverty since they tend to 
benefit poorer households located in rural 
areas. Furthermore, the 2010 earthquake 
 resulted in unprecedented aid flows in the 
form of money, goods and services. These 
 external flows have also contributed in reduc-
ing poverty over the period, especially in the

Metropolitan area which attracted most of 
the assistance (in large part because Port-au-
Prince was hit hardest by the earthquake).
In addition to migration abroad, domes-
tic migration is highly prevalent, with a clear 
bias towards urban areas. While one million 
Haitians are estimated to live abroad (see 
Chapter 1), almost two million Haitians have 
migrated internally. Indeed, 24 percent of the 
population has moved from their place of 
birth (compared to 20 percent in 2001).15 In 
terms of areas of residence, it is clear that the 
flow of migrants has an urban bias, and espe-
cially the Aire Metropolitaine. Over half of 
the current population of the Metropolitan 
area is composed of migrants, against less 
than 30 percent in other urban areas and less 
than 10 percent in rural settings (figure 2.6). 
In terms of departments, 65 percent of the 
total migrant population now resides in the 
Ouest, followed by 9 percent in Artibonite 
and 8 percent in the Nord. This pattern sug-
gests the attraction of migrants to urban cen-
ters: Gonaïves in Artibonite and Cap Haitian 
in the North are the two largest centers after 
Port-au-Prince.

Migrating, both domestically and abroad, 
seems to be a profitable income generation 
solution for many households. In many devel-
oping countries, households turn to migration 
as a way to increase available income, in a 
context of limited economic opportunities or 
returns to education. In particular, the deci-
sion of a household to educate or send one of 
its members abroad can be seen as an invest-
ment: families incur upfront costs (such as ed-
ucation fees, transport tickets, seed money, 
network mobilization, visa) in order to reap 
future income gains from better labor oppor-
tunities.16 Data suggests a strong link between 
schooling and mobility in Haiti ( figure 2.7). If 
the initial costs of international migration 
are too high for poorer households, moving 
within the country represents a second-best 
option: when controlling for individual and 
households characteristics, educated migrants

in urban areas earn on average between 20 
and 30 percent more than their counterparts 
in rural areas.17
People have been moving to urban areas 
also to seek better public services. The State 
being absent in many places outside the main 
urban centers (as discussed in Chapter 1), peo-
ple have been migrating to the Metropolitan 
areas and to other urban areas to seek better 
access to services. Although, the quality of 
 sanitation remains low (only 31 percent of the 
population had access in 2012 to improved 
sanitation), the ratio for rural areas is even 
much lower (16 percent).18 Access to im-
proved sources of drinking water is similar in 
urban and rural areas, at 55 and 52 percent, 
 respectively. However, most of the remainder 
of the urban population (36 percent) pur-
chases safe water directly from vendors, while 
most of the remainder of the rural population 
(44 percent) does not have this option and 
uses unimproved water sources (river water 
or unprotected wells) with a high probability 
of contamination. Access to energy (electric-
ity, solar, or generators) expanded only 
slightly because of gains in urban areas, 
 accompanied by stagnating levels in rural 
areas, which remained at 11 percent.
Private transfers have played an impor-
tant role in supporting households’ income 
in Haiti. Larger private transfers coming 
from domestic and international migrants 
have played a significant role in raising in-
come in urban areas, together with more 
nonagricultural employment opportunities. 
The share of private transfers in total house-
hold income has increased from 20 to 42 
percent in the first and from 15 to 20 percent 
in the second quintile of the income distri-
bution. In rural areas, where poverty has 
stagnated and inequality increased, the share 
of private transfers also rose for the bottom 

40 (from 10 to 15 percent in the first quintile 
and from 7 to 12 percent in the second).
Private transfers are associated with lower 
poverty levels. Since over 60 percent of poor 
and extreme poor households rely on some 
kind of transfers, excluding those has a size-
able effect on poverty headcounts.19 If private 
transfers were to stop flowing, extreme pov-
erty would increase 5 points (from 23.8 per-
cent to 28.9 percent), and moderate poverty 
would rise 4 percentage points (from 58.5 
percent to 63 percent). As poor households 
have less access to remittances, excluding 
them from the total budget has a smaller im-
pact on poverty rates: extreme poverty rises 
to 25.4 percent and moderate poverty to 60.3 
percent.20 Some regions like the South East 
or the South benefit particularly from private 
domestic transfers, while in the North, the 
North East, and the Nippes remittances from 
abroad play a greater role in reducing pov-
erty (figure 2.8).

 1. All statistics in this section come from 
ECVMAS 2012 and ECVH 2001, unless oth-
erwise indicated.
 2. Pedersen and Lockwood (2001) based on the 
1999/2000 Budget and Consumption Survey. 
As a point of comparison, Azevedo et al. 
(2013) studies 16 countries having substan-
tially reduced poverty over broadly a decade, 
ranging from a 10 percentage points decline 
(Costa Rica) to more than 40 percentage 
points (Romania).
 3. Although not completely comparable, the 
monetary poverty indicator from 2000 was 
calculated using a methodology similar to the 
new official one, including the use of a national 
food poverty line against per capita household 
consumption. The reduction in consumption 
poverty is also confirmed by trends in non-
monetary well-being indicators. Income based 
measures of moderate poverty suggest that 
it declined from 77 percent in 2001 (ECVH 
2001) to 72 percent in 2012 (ECVMAS 2012). 
Consumption based poverty measures are 
considered the most accurate in capturing 
welfare levels, especially in countries with high 
levels of rural poverty and significant income 
volatility. The new official Haitian poverty 
measure is consumption based.
 4. Haiti’s GDP per capita amounted to US$1,575 
(PPP) in 2013 and ranked 161 out of 186 coun-
tries in the UNDP Human Development Index.
 5. These rates are based on per capita consump-
tion and were calculated using the 2012 official 
Haitian moderate and extreme poverty lines of 
82.2 HTG (US$1.98) and 41.7 HTG (US$1), 
respectively.
 6. Based on per capita income data.
 7. According to the 2012 demographic and 
health survey ([DHS] MSPP, IHE, and ICF 
International 2013), 7 in 10 women aged 
15–49 years do not seek medical support for 
lack of money, while 43 percent do not do so 
for lack of transport (see chapter 3).
 8. In 2012, the coverage of deliveries within insti-
tutions was 8.4 times greater among the high-
est income quintile (76 percent) than among 
the lowest quintile (9 percent).

 9. According to the National Food Security 
Coordination Unit, the food insecurity rate 
was 28 percent nationwide and 48 percent in 
rural areas in 2011. To measure food insecurity, 
the unit uses a composite indicator composed 
of both quantitative and qualitative measures. 
The numbers contained in this chapter, on the 
other hand, refer exclusively to the food se-
curity indicator of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, which is 
based on food intake.
 10. Only about 8 percent of the Haitian popula-
tion received non-contributory social assis-
tance benefits (such as scholarship, food aid, 
or other transfer) in 2012 (World Bank and 
ONPES 2014).
 11. The 
informal sector 
is defined by 
the 
International Labor Organization as unincor-
porated enterprises (household businesses) 
that are not registered, do not keep formal 
accounts, and are not in the primary sector 
(agriculture).
 12. The increase in the share of employment in 
agriculture stems from a rise in family aid. 
The intuition would be that in dire times, 
young people and women who would not have 
worked were called into the labor force.
 13. The private informal sector in figure 2.5 in-
cludes non-farm self-employment, non-farm 
business owners, and the informal non-farm 
wage work in figure 2.6.
 14. Since 2000, the sector has performed poorly, 
contracting by 0.6 percent annually as a con-
sequence of repeated adverse climatic shocks. 
In 2012, agricultural production narrowed 
by 1.3 percent following a series of droughts, 
heavy rains, and hurricanes, which generated 
crop and seasonal income losses of 40–80 
percent. See “Haiti Food Security Outlook”

 16. Clemens (2011) estimates that unskilled 
Haitian farmers migrating to the US could 
increase their annual incomes by a factor 
of 20.
 17. Clemens (2014) gathers evidence that mi-
gration tends to increase with income until 
a certain threshold, suggesting that poorer 
households would like to migrate, but do not 
have the means to afford it.
 18. Improved sanitation 
includes flush 
toi-
lets and  improved latrines. According to 
the United Nations Children’s Fund and 
the World Health Organization, an im-
proved  sanitation latrine is one that hygien-
ically separates human excreta from human 
contact.

 19. Official poverty rates are based on consump-
tion, not on income. The exercise above 
consists on subtracting transfers from total 
consumption and recalculating poverty rates, 
thus relying on the assumption that house-
holds consume all of income received from 
transfers (no savings).
 20. Acosta et al. (2006) use the 2011 ECVH to 
estimate the effect of remittances on pov-
erty. Using an income-based welfare measure 
and  the international poverty lines of U$1 
and U$2 a day for extreme and moderate 
poverty, respectively, they find that excluding 
 remittances increased extreme poverty from 
53 percent to 60 percent and moderate poverty 
from 71 percent to 76 percent.

3. Trends and Drivers of Growth

Trends

Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in 
the last four decades has been disappointing. 
From 1971 to 2013, GDP growth averaged 1.2 
percent a year, much lower than the average of 
the LAC region (3.5 percent) and the average 
of economies at the same level of develop-
ment (3.3 percent) ( figure 3.1). The few peri-
ods of positive growth were short-lived, often 
followed by a contraction in economic activity. 
Furthermore, in light of the country’s impor-
tant demographic growth, the level of GDP per 
capita even fell by 0.7 percent per year on 
 average between 1971 and 2013. While Haiti’s 
GDP per capita has expanded in line with the 
average of LAC during the 1970’s, it has lost 
ground ever since (figure 3.2). Even low income 
countries (LIC) have on average seen their 
GDP per capita taking off since the mid-1990s, 
leaving Haiti behind.
Haiti’s growth has been largely driven by 
an expanding labor force. Looking at the fac-
tor decomposition of Haiti’s growth, one no-
tices that labor has been the main driver of the 
country’s economic expansion (table 3.1). 
Increases in life expectancy and reductions of 
fertility rates (from 5.7 births/woman in 1971 
to 3.2 in 2012) have contributed to the increase 
in the share of the working age population: 
population ages 15–64 represented in 2012 
59 percent of the total population, up from 
54 percent in 1971. Capital accumulation, al-
though timid for most of the period, has been 
picking up since 2000. Even if overestimated, 
capital accumulation is likely to have been lifted 
by the re-engagement of  donors and the aid 
flows following the 2010 earthquake to  rebuild 

lost infrastructure.1 Access to concessional 
borrowing has also  financed a higher level of 
public investment (box 3.1).
The economy’s performance has,  however, 
been held back by negative productivity 
shocks. Real GDP growth in Haiti during the 
period was disappointing, despite  increases in 
the factors of production, implying negative 
total factor productivity (TFP). This negative 
con tribution could  reflect the natural disasters 
and political instability Haiti has experienced.2 
Only during a limited period of time after the 
 return to democracy (1995–99), growth in TFP 
was positive. During these episodes, improve-
ments in productivity could have stemmed 
from the reallocation of factors towards eco-
nomic sectors with higher productivity, higher 
“quality” of inputs (labor and capital) or the 
adoption of new technologies (IMF 2004).
Natural disasters have indeed hampered 
Haiti’s economic performance over the last 
forty years. Between 1971 and 2013, Haiti’s 
economy has been subjected to numerous 
shocks with adverse effects on growth. While 
natural disasters have occurred almost every 
year during this period ( figure 3.3), the ex-
tent of the economic consequences depends 
on the nature of the disasters: the effects of 
floods tend to be limited to certain areas, with 
fewer people affected, while those of hurri-
canes tend to be more widespread ( figure 3.4). 
In 2008, for instance, Haiti was hit by four 
hurr icanes , causing a contrac t ion in agr i-
cultural production by more than 7 percent. 
The 2010 earthquake was also destructive 
and led to a significant loss of human life 
and displacements, as well as damage to

infrastructure, dwellings, and, to a lesser extent, 
jobs. In 2012, the country was hit by two hurri-
canes (Isaac and Sandy) and one drought, 
leading to negative growth of 1.3 percent in 
the agricultural sector.
Political instability has also taken a toll 
on growth. The departure of Jean Claude 
 Du valier initiated a period of intense politi-
cal instability in Haiti (figure 3.5). Between 

1986 and 2014 the country had 18 changes of 
president and important changes in reg ime 
(table 3.2). In ad dition, according to the Cross-
National Time Series data archive, there were 
20 major cabinet changes in Haiti from 1986 to 
2006 (meaning a change of Prime minister or 
50 percent of the cabinet posts are assumed 
by new ministers). Empirical investigations 
have shown that such cabinet changes are

bOX 3.1 Petrocaribe and Haiti

The Petrocaribe initiative, created in 2005, has 18 members.a The agreement aims to promote 
cooperation among state energy operators, in terms of technology, energy policy, joint exploration, 
refining, sales and investment in the energy sector. The most relevant aspect of the Petrocaribe 
agreement is the stable supply of oil from Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela to other members, 
at favorable financing conditions. Through the agreement, Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela 
commits to providing oil to the members based on quotas established bilaterally at international 
market prices. Haiti joined the initiative in March 2007 and started benefiting from the agreement 
in October 2007, with a quota of 14 thousand barrels per day (b/d). However, only a fraction of the 
bill needs to be paid in cash, the remaining is financed on concessional terms.

The sale of these oil products in the domestic market creates considerable resources for 
the government. Since 2008, the Petrocaribe flows have amounted cumulatively to 
25 percent of GDP. An autonomous agency of the Ministry of Finance (the Bureau de 
Monétisation du Programme d’Aide au Développement, BMPAD) manages these resources 
on behalf of the Haitian government. BMPAD plays an intermediary role between Haitian 
fuel purchasers and the Venezuelan supplier.
Petrocaribe resources have been used to finance investment and social projects, as well as 
support the electricity sector. Whenever the government decides that new projects will be 
financed using these resources, it publishes a resolution listing these projects and the 
amounts to be financed in the official gazette. Disbursements into the projects are re-
ported in BMPAD’s webpage on a regular basis. These projects suffer nevertheless from 
the same shortcomings than the rest of the Public Investment Program, notably a lack of 
proper assessment, prioritization and monitoring (see box 1.1). A recent audit of these in-
vestments by the CSCCA highlights serious shortcomings in the procurement and super-
vision of contracts, including over-priced infrastructure and abandoned projects.

from 5.1 to 10.2 homicides per 100,000 in-
habitants.4,5 Crim inal activity has been espe-
cially widespread near the industrial areas of 
Port-au-Prince and in urban slums, forcing 
businesses to absorb high security costs and 
periodically shut down or move their opera-
tions. The effects of violence are felt most 
deeply on the most vulnerable members of 
the population. Residents of poor, marginal-
ized neighborhoods are 40 times more likely 
to be murdered than other urban dwellers.
These events have significantly reshaped 
the structure of the Haitian economy over the 
last four decades. The US embargo (1991–94) 
triggered a strong decline in manufacturing 
(figure 3.6). This sector represented 18 percent 
of GDP in 1990, shrunk to 10 percent in 1994 

when the embargo ended, and never returned 
to pre-embargo levels afterwards.6 In the be-
ginning of the 1970, agriculture was the most 
important sector, representing almost 40 per-
cent of the value added, but fell to less than 
20 percent in 2012. Authors have argued that 
the embargo, because it hampered access to 
important inputs such as seeds, contributed 
to the decline of productivity in the sector 
(IICA 1997). High fragmentation of land, low 
levels of technology applied in the sector, and 
soil deterioration have also constrained agri-
cultural produc tivity. As seen above, the sec-
tor is also very vulnerable to natural disasters. 
Some of those factors have also contributed 
to the great volatility in the contribution of 
the agricultural sector to GDP growth while

construction and services have been more 
steady drivers of growth, especially since the 
earthquake. (figure 3.7).
The decline of agriculture has been ac-
companied by an acceleration of urbanization 
(figure 3.8). An increase in population con-
centration in the cities has also pushed the 
demand for services. Together, the activities 
of transport and communication, commerce 
and other services currently represent almost 
half of the value added in Haiti. Another sec-
tor that has risen in importance is construc-
tion, also driven by urbanization. Growth in 
construction was the main driver of the rise 
in the share of secondary activities in GDP.

political stability after the low-point of 2004 
came with an improvement in a number of 
governance indicators (figure 3.10). The im-
plementation of the Automated System for 
Customs Data (ASCUYDA) was stepped up, 
for instance, after the earthquake.7 Indicators 

for control of corruption, rule of law, govern-
ment effectiveness, as well as voice and ac-
countability have all registered improvements 
in Haiti over that period, although remain-
ing low compared to the average of the LAC 
region and to that of low-income economies

(figure 3.9). Haiti still ranks lowest in the re-
gion in control of corruption or government 
effectiveness.
In particular, a real property cadaster and 
land registry system is needed. Less than five 
percent of Haiti’s land has been surveyed, 
and more than 75 percent of rural land con-
tracts are drawn up according to traditional 
procedures and are not officially registered. 
The situation is just as complicated in urban 
areas. The courts are clogged by numerous 
land disputes. Increased legal security of 
land rights is essential to protect both indi-
vidual households and investors (who hesi-
tate to engage in investment projects that 
might end up being challenged in court), 
and to develop and maintain a real estate 
market. Several attempts have been made at 
the national level to develop a registry sys-
tem, without success.
Access to finance is challenging for both, 
households and medium- and small-sized en-
terpr ises . The ver y sma l l number of 
branches and ser v ice points of forma l 
 institutions in the country (6.35/100,000 

inhabitants) results in a low level of usage of 
financial services. Today, only 27 percent of 
all adults in Haiti have an account at a formal 
financial institution (compared with 45 
percent in LAC). Coupled with limited credit 
information availability, unclear property 
rights and weak contract enforcement, ac-
cess to credit is problematic, particularly 
for small- and medium-sized enterprises, lim-
iting their capacity of taking advantage of op-
portunities, growing their operations and 
generating employment. Furthermore, 
competition to provide f inancia l ser vices is 
limited. The sector is high ly concentrated, 
with close to 80 percent of bank assets 
being held by the three largest banks, and—
according to the 2008 FSAP—10 percent of 
 individual borrowers receiving approximately 
80 per cent of total loans. Roughly 40 percent 
of tota l credit is extended to commerce and 
services activities, whereas agriculture re-
ceives less than 0.2 percent (figure 3.11).
Haiti’s infrastructure also falls short. Island 
economies are extremely dependent on the 
quality, frequency and cost of the means of 
transpor t that link them to markets which 
represent both market outlets for their prod-
ucts and supply sources for the needed im-
ported goods. The efficiency and effectiveness 
of transport, whether by road, by sea, or by 
air, therefore contribute to the competitive-
ness of these countries. The quality of trans-
port and logistics services in Haiti is poor, 
however, the country ranking 144th out of 
160 countries on the World Bank’s logistics 
performance index (LPI) in 2013 and trai l-
ing behind its compet itors (f igure 3.12).8 
The road network in Haiti is in poor condi-
tion and many parts of the territory are not 
well connected: 60 percent of people living 
in rural areas do not have access to main 
roads during the rainy season.9 Haiti is also

network than many developing countries.10 
Furthermore, the costs of loading and unload-
ing a standard container at Port-au-Prince 
are by far the highest of the Caribbean ports 
(figure 3.13).11
In particular, the provision of electricity is 
problematic. The electricity current is unsta-
b le and there are f requent power cuts and 
surges, which can result in serious damage to 
industrial equipment. Despite this poor service, 
the cost of electricity is among the highest in 
the reg ion . In 2011 , industr y was charged 
$0.32/Kwh, compared to $0.18 in Nicaragua, 
$0.17 in the Dominican Republic and $0.06 in 
Bangladesh IFC (2011). These countries are 

Haiti’s competitors in light manufac tur ing 
and apparel industry. Since reliability is low, 
Haitian industries must have backup power 
sources, generally diesel generators. Fur ther-
more, the supply of electricity covers only a 
small proportion of the country, with rural 
areas being particularly neglected. Per capita 
consumption of electricity in Haiti is substan-
tially lower than in other Caribbean countries, 
for example, it is only two percent of the level 
in the Dominican Republic (figure 3.14).
Access to clean water and improved sani-
tation in Haiti also remains limited. Access to 
quality water is a significant challenge in 
rural areas and small towns of Haiti (table 2.1). 
Rural areas are generally served through water

points equipped with hand pumps, while small 
towns are served with gravity-fed piped sys-
tems from which water is delivered through 
stand posts, kiosks and household connec-
tions. A substantial portion of the system is 
not operational, however, for lack of suffi-
cient funds for operation and maintenance, 
and less than ten percent are equipped with 
chlorination devices.12 Sani tation is equally a 
challenge with only 16 per cent of households 
having access to improved sanitation in rural 
areas. Both urban and rural populations 
mostly rely on individual on-site sanitation 
solutions, as sustainable collection and treat-
ment of sewage are practically non-  existent. 
Due to low access to improved sanitation fa-
cilities, open defecation is frequent. In this 
fragile environment, facilitated by flooding 
and heavy rain, cholera broke out and rapidly 
spread through Haiti in 2010.
Sur veys also point to the lack of quali-
f ied labor ILO (2010). One major con-
straint faced by enterprises in Haiti is the 
diff iculty to f ind techn ic ians that are we l l 
qua l i f ied , particularly in new technologies. 
This forces the country to position itself as a 
low cost producer for goods and ser vices 
requiring little skills. An opaque labor 
market may be at fault, with no institutional 
mechanism to enable the ex change of in for-
mat ion be tween labor demand and sup-
ply. More generally, the level of education 
among the adult population remains low : 
45.7 percent of the adult population (60.5 
percent of households’ heads) have never 
attended s choo l or have not comp le ted 
pr imar y education. Not master ing basic 
ski l ls such as l iterac y and numerac y when 
s tar t ing work represents a major imped i-
ment for the ir insertion in the labor mar-
ket and, more importantly, for their ability 
to absorb post-school training either on or 

off the job, and to adapt to changing job 
requirements.
Against this backdrop, light manufactur-
ing is a success story, but with challenges. The 
apparel industry has expanded rapidly since 
2009 with exports especially to the US mar-
ket helped by preferential access agreements. 
These exports have been growing at 18 percent 
per year. The industry is estimated to employ 
about 30’000 workers at present and is ex-
pected to expand further in the future. It is by 
far the largest formal employer. Wages remain, 
nevertheless, low, while rapid migration and 
informal housing settlements around these 
firms can rapidly create developmental chal-
lenges due to limited infrastructure and gov-
ernment ser vices to meet workers’ needs. 
Nonetheless, apparel wage-earners have a 
vested interest in stability, and could be a 
source of poverty reduction and shared pros-
perity. However, as long as port and electricity 
costs remain high compared to its com pe-
titors, Haiti’s comparative advantage rests on 
cheap labor, which will force wages to re-
main low.
Tourism has a long way to go, but could 
contribute significantly to growth. Haiti’s s 
potential in tourism is rich, not only because 
of beautiful nature and beaches, but also be-
cause of its world-class cultural and natural 
heritage, such as the Citadelle, Palais Sans 
Souci, and Ramiers, classified as World 
Heritage sites by UNESCO. Demand for 
tourism services is growing with close to 
one million visitors registered in 2013 ac-
cording to the World Tour ism Organization. 
Most of these visitors are from the Haitian 
diaspora in the US and cruise ship visitors, 
with overnight visitors in some of the emerg-
ing tourist resorts and high-end hotels repre-
senting a much smaller number, thus limiting 
the economic impact of tourism so far. 

Trends and Drivers of Growth 

55

24,000 people arrive by cruise ship every 
week, but there are no excursions within Haiti 
organized. Haiti’s performance also pales in 
comparison to its neighbor, the Dominican 
Republic, where 90 percent of its more than 
five million visitors annually stayed overnight 
and expenditure amounted to about 8 percent 
of GDP in 2013. Overall, while the potential 
is significant, Haiti’s tourism industry has a 
long way to go, including overcoming the 
image of a dangerous country, marred by vio-
lence and cholera, and, once again, its weak 
transport and electricity infrastructure.
Mining holds potential, but comes with 
social and environmental challenges. Haiti 
shows significant potential in mineral and 
metal mining. Based on preliminary explor-
atory activities, Haiti is expected to have sub-
stantial deposits, especially in gold, silver, 
copper, and aluminum bauxite. Given the 
limited information available, determining the 
economic potential of mining in the country 
has to be approached with caution. Estimates 
suggest a reserve value of about US$5–6 
 billion at current market pr ices . Success fu l 
exploitat ion of th is wea lth w i l l , however, 
requ ire a much more concer ted e f for t by 
the government to put in place the appro-
pr iate pol ic y, regu lator y and inst itut iona l 
f ramework . At present , the f ramework for 
award ing exploration and exploitation li-
censes suffers from a lack of transparency, 
leading some larger mining companies to 
halt their exploration work. Most impor-
tantly, managing the environmental and 
social impact of mining will need to be ad-
dressed, including through an open and 
transparent community and stakeholder 
engagement mechanism to ensure that 
local communities affected by these opera-
tions can help shape these operations and 
benefit from them.

How could the earnings of the under-
employed and those employed in the in-
formal sector be improved? The formal 
manufacturing and ser vice sectors have the 
potent ia l to be an important source of em-
ployment, but because they hire such a 
sma l l share of the labor force, even with 
very high growth rates, they w i l l not be able 
to absorb more than a fraction of the new 
entrants. Figure 3.15 simulates the share of 
the labor force in the informal and agricul-
ture sectors. Even with a ten percent annual 
growth rate—in line with the strong job cre-
ation observed over the past five years, im-
plying about 30,000 new formal jobs a 
year—forma l employment wou ld on ly ac-
count for about 20 percent of the labor 
force in a decade. Most Haitians are thus 

56 

Trends and Drivers of Growth

likely to continue working in low-productiv-
ity agriculture and non-agriculture informal 
sector activities over the foreseeable future. 
The challenge is thus to enhance the pro-
ductivity—hence the earnings—of those al-
ready employed, while at the same time 
creating more formal jobs.13
The constraints discussed above seem to 
be particularly present in agriculture. Haiti’s 
agricultural potential has yet to translate into 
commercial agribusiness. Notwithstanding 
the fact that 40 percent of jobs in Haiti are in 
agriculture, the country is far from develop-
ing a commercial agribusiness sector. The ag-
ri culture sector in Haiti has been declining 
for many years, the result of neglected rural 
infrastructure, weak research and extension, 
poorly defined land tenure, limited access to 
credit, and under-investment in human capi-
tal. Even in potentially successful niches such 
as coffee, cacao or mangoes, the vast majority 
of agricultural production continues to be re-
lated to low-productivity subsistence farm-
ing. There has been a general shift out of long 
cycle towards short cycle production (annual 
cereal cultures and vegetables). These factors, 
along with high population growth, have con-
tri buted to shrinking parcel sizes; complex, 
informal tenure systems that discourage long-
term investment; and cultivation of marginal 
lands with steep slopes, encroaching on for-
ests, destroying watersheds, and aggravating 
the tenuous environmental situation.
Limitations in logistics are particularly 
constraining for agriculture supply chains. 
Firms in the agriculture sector do not get to 
choose where to set up shop and need to 
transport their products to the markets. 
Supply chains analyses carried out on six 
products showed that transport-associated 
losses could be extremely high .14 For infor-
ma l produc ts , loss leve ls cou ld be in the 

range of 40 percent. Transport services are 
often unavailable, and Haiti’s two rainy sea-
sons often make roads impassable. When 
factoring in mangoes that spoil in the f ield 
before they can be transported, one ex-
porter estimated that losses could reach up 
to 50 percent. In production zones with poor 
accessibility, producers and traders are forced 
to transport goods on horse back or by foot. 
The first segment of transport, from the farm 
to the first point of collection, is the most 
costly in terms of actual and implicit trans-
port costs and losses. Lastly, poor storage 
conditions reduce the shelf-life of pro duce, 
making producers anxious to sell at any 
price and cutting the season down to its 
min imum time range.
Regarding the informal sector, improve-
ments in skills and access to inputs could en-
hance income prospects. Most of the nonfarm 
enterprises in Haiti operate on a small scale 
and are in the informal sector. Nonfarm busi-
nesses are micro in nature and have an average 
of 1.5 workers, including the owner. An analy-
sis of correlates of successful self-employed 
performance was carried out, using three mea-
sures: revenues per worker (in log), revenues 
per worker in the top 30 of the distribution, 
profits per worker in the top 30 of the distri-
bution (results are presented in appendix B). 
With the caveat that this exercise indicates a 
conditional correlation rather than a causal 
relation, the analysis helps nevertheless iden-
tify the characteristics and inputs that could 
be significantly more relevant to improve 
 understanding of what will it take to elevate 
productivity and generate jobs in the self- 
employed and small business sector. The re-
sults suggest that human capital (experience, 
skills), and access to physical capital such as 
electricity and water, are associated with 
higher returns.

Notes

 1. There are reasons to believe that investment 
figures in Haiti are over estimated. Both trea-
sury financed and donor’s financed projects 
have a significant share of current expendi-
tures recorded as investment.
 2. A simple regression would suggest that natural 
disasters and Cabinet changes could account 
for 60 percent of the variance in TFP.
 3. Calculations based on a background paper 
prepared for the SCD by Kassia Antoine, Raju 
Singh, and Konstantin M. Wacker.
 4. UNODC Homicide data.
 5. The main state penitentiary collapsed follow-
ing the earthquake, allowing most of the crim-
inals to escape. Combined with a still weak 
law enforcement and justice system, this event 
enabled criminal gangs to grow, as well as po-
litical assassinations, carjackings, and kidnap-
pings to continue.
 6. The 
Inter-American Development Bank 
(2009) mentions for instance that in 1984 the 
vast majority of U.S. baseballs were assembled 
in Haiti. The same seems to have been true for 
the Rubik’s Cube. 125,000 workers were em-
ployed in the sector at the time and the em-
bargo brought this number close to zero ten 
years later.
 7. Customs provides about 30 percent of bud-
get resources. In addition to fraud preven-
tion, the customs department also has the 
responsibility of stopping unfair competition 
and unwarranted earnings, while at the same 
time facilitating fluid and transparent trade 
transactions. The main entry point for indi-
viduals and merchandise is Port-au-Prince. 
The customs services situated at the port and 
the airport of Port au Prince cover respec-
tively more than 90  percent of imports and 
70 exports of the country. They also generate 
84 percent of customs receipts. In addition, 
eight customs posts are situated around the 
perimeter of the country and there are also 
mobile brigades.
 8. The LPI is based on six core dimensions of 
trade-related services, including customs, 

infrastructure, international shipments, lo-
gistics competence, tracking and tracing, and 
timeliness.
 9. The sharp deterioration of Haiti’s road net-
work, the inadequate packaging of fruit 
and  vegetables and the use of vehicles un-
suited to the transport of agricultural goods 
are responsible for considerable commer-
cial  losses. In the North West, for instance, 
transport costs for a stem of bananas from 
the farm to the primar y market are esti-
mated  to represent 25  percent of the sale 
price or 45 percent of the prof it margin 
(World Bank 2013).
 10. According 
to UNCTAD’s 
liner shipping 
 connectivity index (LSCI), Haiti ranks lower 
than the main players in the Caribbean: 
Haiti’s score of 5 is much lower than scores 
by Jamaica (21) and the Bahamas (27), and 
the Dominican Republic (23) that host 
 transshipments ports. The 
liner shipping 
 connectivity index (LSCI) is made up of five 
components: 1) the number of companies that

the size of the largest ship providing services 
from/to a country’s port (measured in Twenty 
foot Equivalent Units–TEU); 3) the number 
of services that connect the country’s port(s)

of ships operating from/to the country’s port; 
and 5) the total container carrying capacity of 
those ships.
 11. According to a 2009 study mandated by the 
Haitian Chamber of Commerce, costs in 
Port-au-Prince are five times higher than 
in  the ports of the Dominican Republic 
(World Bank 2013).
 12. DINEPA’s performance monitoring system, 
which monitors roughly half of the water sup-
ply systems, estimates that 41 percent of the 
stand posts and 45 percent of the kiosks do not 
deliver water.

Trends and Drivers of Growth

 14. Supply chain analysis shows how the effects of 
constraints (costs, times and losses) are distrib-
uted throughout the logistics chain. In case of 
Haiti, surveys and semi-structured interviews 
have been conducted with government offi-
cials, shipping companies, exporters for three 
formal supply chains: mangoes (Artibonite, 

Gros-Morne), 
rice 
(Estère, Pont Sondé, 
Desdunes, Verrettes, Artibonite) and vetiver 
(Les Cayes, Sud). In addition, three informal 
supply chains have been examined: mangoes 
(Carice and Capotille, Nord-Est), and coffee and 
avocadoes (Central Plateau Region—Savanette, 
Baptiste—Centre).

Trends and Drivers of Growth

4. Sustainability

Environment

Urbanization is increasing Haiti’s vul-
nerability to natural disasters. As a safety 
valve, migration probably contains poverty 
and provides relief to many families through 
private transfers. However, moving to urban 
areas is putting pressure on the environment, 
and leading to the settlement of large popu-
lations in vulnerable places (figures 4.1 and 
4.2). Their settlement in urban areas takes 
place usually in the cheapest, less accessible, 
and least serviced land, more often than not, 
in disaster-prone areas . Floods , hurr icanes 
and ear thquakes have cons iderable inten-
s ity in urban areas that make the precarious 
and informal urban dwellers particularly 
vulnerable. In terms of the number of com-
munes, urban areas are the most prone to 
suffer floods. Twenty-seven communes lay 
within the highest risk of flood-prone area. 
The severity of hurricanes seems also to be 
more acute in urban areas. Two-thirds of 
urban communes and over 70 percent of 
urban population are affected by hurricanes 
with medium to high impact.
This unplanned urban growth has created 
vulnerabilities for both the physical environ-
ment and those who live in it. Settlers tend 
to occupy areas that are not only prone to 
risk from disasters, but are also sometimes 
nature’s protection from risk. Coastal cities 
are throughout the world seeing an increase 
in shoreline retreat, which exposes them to 
a greater risk of flooding partly due to de-
graded coastal ecosystems by human activity 
(Sanchez-Reaza and Carletto 2013). This slow 
degradation of the environment in turn 

increases the country’s vulnerability as a 
whole to natural disasters. The metropolitan 
area of Port-au-Prince, for instance, is a 
coastal plain surrounded by the mountain 
chain Morne l’Hôpital, which severely limits 
the availability of land for growth. However, 
the urban area has experienced an explosive 
expansion in the past two decades w ith a 
near tota l absence of urban planning and 
growth regulation, much of it on precarious 
terrain. The trees and other vegetation that 
used to cover the Morne have now almost 
completely disappeared, giving way to a 
spontaneous and anarchic urbanization oc-
curring on both state-owned and private 
land.
Furthermore, natural disasters imply sig-
nif icant f isca l costs . Work was carr ied out 
jointly with the Ministry of Economy and 
Finance (MEF) to develop several hypothe-
ses regarding cont ingent liabi lit ies for the 
government in the event of disasters. The 
results suggest that the annual average fiscal 
cost for the government can be estimated at 
around one percent of GDP. This estimated 
cost was based on modeling used by the 
CCRIF, and is linked to damages caused by 
tropical hurricanes (0.8 percent of GDP) and 
by earth quakes (0.2 percent of GDP). In the 
absence of a financial strategy to manage 
this risk and provide appropriate fiscal buf-
fers, natural disasters will require reallocat-
ing public funds and involve high 
opportunity costs.
Less frequent, higher-impact events can 
pose a real threat to the sustainability of public 
finances. While frequent, low-impact events

constrain fiscal space, less frequent, high er-
impact events can imply significant fiscal 
shocks and pose a real threat to the sustain-
ability of public finances. Although with large 
opportunity costs as discussed above, the gov-
ernment can mobilize a portion of its financ-
ing with respect to low-impact events through 
budget reallocations or the use of its deposits. 
However, these funds will not be sufficient to 
address major events that give rise to costs 
that far exceed the government’s financing ca-
pacity. The fiscal shock associated with a hur-
ricane that occurs once every 50 years, for 
instance, is estimated at about 10 percent of 
GDP, representing a much greater risk for fis-
cal sustainability and macroeconomic stability.

Social Tensions

Rapid urbanization could also be 
feeding greater violence. Youth violence 
is often expressed as a reaction to perceived 
social and economic exclusion—grievances that 
can easily be mobilized by political interests.1 

Rapid migration to urban neighborhoods, 
associated with poverty, unemployment, po-
litical and social marginalization, limited 
 access to services, and weak governance, 
could fuel the formation of gangs that en-
gage at-risk youth and draw them in. These 
gr ievances have a lso contr ibuted to inter-
generationa l conflict, undermining social 
cohesion and hindering the capacity of many 
communities for productive collective action 
Marc et al. (2012).
Violence in Haiti tends to be predomi-
nantly an urban phenomenon. Looking at 
the number of politically violent events 
across arrondissements between 2000 and 
2010, one observes that urban centers are 
by far the arrondissements with the largest 
number of conflict events per capita (map 4.1, 
figure 4.3). This obser vat ion is conf irmed 
using the MINUSTAH data for the most 
 recent period covering criminal events 
(map 4.1, figure 4.4). Even when controlling 
for relevant variables, our empirical work 
suggests that the share of urban population

in the arrondissement is positively and sig-
nificantly correlated with conflict intensity 
(box 4.1).
Migration is associated with greater vio-
lence, as social ties erode. The share of im-
migrants in the arrondissement’s population 
is also positively correlated with conflict in-
tensity. New migrants are likely to have less 
access to local social networks which pro-
vide economic and social support in case of 
negative shocks. Such buffer mechanisms 
are an effective way to reduce tensions in 
Haiti. Controlling for the presence of ex-
tended families confirms this interpretation. 
Given the dearth of data at the arrondisse-
ment level on such measures, we resort to 
the 2001 household survey which enables us 
to construct department-wise share of ‘ex-
tended families’ and ‘extended kinship’ 
combined. The former is a household com-
posed of more nuclear fam i lies and the latter 
is a network of more families not necessarily 
linked by blood re lations. Add ing th is 
var iab le to the reg ress ion explains the mi-
gration variable away : a denser social net-
work can help prevent or resolve disputes 
through non-violent means.

Macroeconomy

Macroeconomic stability has been 
maintained. Haiti’s macroeconomic envi-
ronment has significantly improved over the 
past decade, as was noted in the most recent 
IMF ex post assessment (IMF 2014c). 
Inflation was brought back to single digits 
and has remained contained at these levels 
since 2009, reaching 4.5 percent at end-FY14 
(figure 4.5). International reserves have been 
built up and maintained at an adequate level, 
covering about 5 months of imports. 
Domestic revenue mobilization has also im-
proved, although it is still low by regional 
standards (13 percent of GDP in 2012). 
Between 2009 and 2011, Haiti’s stock of 
 external debt drastically shrank following 
debt relief. In addition to benefiting from the 
HIPC and the MDRI, Haiti received addi-
tional debt cancellation in the aftermath of 
the 2010 earthquake. As a result, total exter-
nal debt fell from 29.4 percent of GDP to 
8.9 percent of GDP in 2011.
The IMF in its most recent assessment es-
timated that the exchange rate remains 
broadly in line with its medium-term

BOX 4.1 Drivers of Conflict in Haiti—An empirical Analysisa

In order to understand better the role of various socio-economic factors in explaining the ebbs and 
flows of conflict across Haiti in the 2000s, a cross-sectional analysis across the 42 Haitian arron-
dissements was run. This strategy has the advantage of allowing us to control for national level fac-
tors that may not be properly observable in cross-country analyses and may be endogenous to 
conflict. In addition the within-country analysis relies on a more homogenous definition of con-
flict events than a cross-country analysis, although coming at a cost of not allowing for the investi-
gation of the role of factors that do not vary across spatial units or over the period of analysis, such 
as the political regime and the oligopolistic nature of the economy.
We used data on conflict events from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project, 
which collects and codes media reports on civil and communal conflicts, militia interactions, vio-
lence against civilians, rioting, and protests across various countries since 1997. In the case of Haiti 
the data is available between 1997 and July 2010. We aggregated the individual conflict events at the 
department and sub-department (“Arrondissement”) level to construct time varying conflict inten-
sity measures at our unit of analysis.
We complement these data with data on crimes collected by MINUSTAH mainly on the basis of 
Haiti National Police (HNP) reports. These data are more recent, covering the period 2010 to 
September 2014, although not strictly comparable with the conflict events data as they include a 
broad variety of criminal activities, such as robberies, thefts, homicides, rapes, illegal possession of 
firearms. Most of these events are not related to political violence or political actions as it is the case 
for the events recorded by ACLED. Nevertheless, they provide a useful additional dimension and 
allow us to gauge the latest developments in violence in Haiti.
The results of our analysis suggest that violence in Haiti in the last decade tends to be predomi-
nantly an urban phenomenon. Both political violence and criminal activities are concentrated in 
urban centers. A higher share of immigrants from other areas of the country is also associated with 
higher conflict intensity. This result is mainly driven by the fact that a higher migrants’ share is as-
sociated with a lower presence of social networks (measured as extended families and kinship), 
which reduce conflict. The analysis would also indicate that past conflict and land ownership are all 
important correlates of violence.
In addition, the results suggest that economic shocks matter a great deal in explaining the pattern 
of conflict in Haiti. In particular, increases in remittances are associated with a reduction in conflict 
intensity, consistent with the idea that by raising incomes they raise the opportunity cost of partici-
pating into violent activities. Finally, the evidence suggests that election periods amplify the effect 
of economic shocks on conflict.

rate appreciated by about 23 percent during 
2006–14, against the background of large re-
mittances and external aid inflows (figure 
4.6). IMF Staff analysis accompanying the 

2007, 2010, and 2013 Article IV 
Consultations concluded that, on balance, 
the Haitian gourde was not misaligned with 
fundamentals, and that the economy experi-
enced an equilibrium response to large

Since 2010, a moderate depreciation of the 
nominal effective exchange rate coupled with 
inflation above that of key trade partners has 
led to a gradual real appreciation of the 

Haitian currency. Enhancing competitive-

 reforms to boost productivity through im-
proving infrastructure and the business envi-
ronment, as discussed later on.2

Haiti’s twin fiscal and current account 
deficits have, nevertheless, widened. The 
fiscal deficit averaged 2.2 percent of GDP 
during 2006–09, but widened to 7.1 per-
cent and 6.3 percent of GDP in 2013 and 
2014, respectively (figures 4.7 and 4.8). 
This widening fiscal deficit mainly reflected 
transfers to the public electricity company 
(EDH), which amounted to about 1.5 per-
cent of GDP in 2013, and the fuel retail 
price freeze that had a fiscal cost of almost 
2 percent point of GDP (box 4.2). The coun-

BOX 4.2 electricité d’Haïti (eDH)

Due to poor management, the performance of the national, vertically integrated electricity utility 
Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) has deteriorated over time. Worsening commercial performance has led 
to a lack of infrastructure maintenance and has rapidly deteriorated the quality of electricity ser-
vice, including frequent service interruptions and large voltage fluctuations. The sector’s institu-
tional framework is obsolete (e.g., not allowing EDH to tap into important renewable energy 
potential), sector policies are out of date, planning and monitoring of sector activities is inade-
quate, and vested interests have hampered reform efforts. The effect of the earthquake on power 
generation, transmission, and distribution further aggravated EDH’s weak performance by delay-
ing key modernization activities (e.g., new billing system and the rehabilitation of the Peligre hy-
dropower plant). In 2015, EDH’s losses stood at 57 percent of the electricity generated (of which 
commercial losses represented nearly 35 percent).
EDH’s weak grid infrastructure, poor commercial performance, and inadequate controls over sub-
contracted electricity generation by independent power producers (IPPs) have led to a financial 
drain on government resources. Due to its inability to meet electricity demand and in an attempt 
to expand electricity availability, EDH has subcontracted part of the production of electricity to 
IPPs.a Unable to cover its operating expenses, including fuel costs and power purchases in part be-
cause of low bill collection rates, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers from the Treasury averaging 
US$200 million annually in recent years (equivalent to 10 percent of the national budget and 1–2 
percent of GDP).b
Past governance reforms to preserve the integrity of public resource management in the electric-
ity sector have produced modest results. Achievements to-date include: (a) EDH Commercial 
Recovery action plans (2012–2013; 2013–2014; and 2014–2015); (b) a National Directions Paper 
(endorsed by Cabinet on September 15, 2013); and (c) a government Energy White Paper (in 
draft). Since 2014, an active dialogue on the management and reform of the energy sector has 
been initiated within the government’s Energy Commission and with the strategic partners in the 
sector.

a. IPPs provided 60 percent of total electricity generation in 2011.
b. Electricity transfers are unbounded due to their dependence on international oil prices, electricity supply, unsanctioned theft and

government deposits needed to be drawn 
down (figure 4.10). Wider fiscal and current 
account deficits are also raising concerns 
about a crowding out of private sector credit 
with a monetary stance becoming tighter to 
contain the mounting pressures on Haiti’s 
currency.
The recent decline in international oil 
prices is further tightening fiscal resources. 
According to the Petrocaribe agreement, 

lower international oil prices imply a higher 
payment rate and less concessional financ-
ing. With lower international oil prices, Haiti 
has experienced a substantial decline in the 
availability of concessional financing. 
International oil prices are expected to re-
main low in the near future, making it even 
more challenging for the country to balance 
the need to ensure macroeconomic stability 
while protecting the social and investment

growth (figures 4.11 and 4.12).
Against this backdrop, poverty could rise 
again. As mentioned in Chapter 2, increases 
in non-agriculture income linked to sectors 
related to aid or reconstruction have driven 
part of the poverty reduction observed in 
Haiti. In 2012, more than 80 per cent of the 
population lived with less than four dollars a 
day (PPP) and only two percent lived with 
ten dollars or more. These numbers indicate

5. Priorities

Prioritization Process

The systematic country diagnostic 
(SCD) seeks to identify the most important 
constraints to and opportunities for inclusive 
and sustainable growth in Haiti. The previous 
chapters on Haiti’s growth performance and 
lack of inclusiveness, as well as the diagnostic 
of poverty and growth, are the first steps in 
identifying priority areas and opportunities to 
increase growth and welfare. The report now 
attempts to provide a sense of prioritization 
and identify the most binding constraints to 
faster economic growth and greater shared 
prosperity, both quantitatively and through a 
series of consultations with stakeholders and 
the Country Team (figure 5.1).

Quantitative Assessment

While overall income growth is a neces­
sary condition for reducing extreme poverty, it 
is not sufficient. The obstacles to faster eco­
nomic growth and greater poverty reduction 
have been described above, but faster economic 
growth alone will not be enough to bring sig­
nificant improvements in the living standards 
of most Haitians. Simulations show that if 
growth in Haiti up to 2030 were to follow its 
historical performance, poverty would hardly 
decline. Under the more sustained perfor­
mance of one percent real per capita growth 
rate observed in Haiti over the 2005–09, pov­
erty reduction would still fall significantly 
short of reaching the goal of extreme poverty 
of 3 percent or less by 2030 (figure 5.2). Re­
ducing extreme poverty by almost half in 15 
years, to about 14 percent, would require an 
overall GDP growth of 3.3 percent per year, 

the average growth registered in post­earth­
quake/reconstruction years (2011–14). As­
suming unchanged income distribution, per 
capita GDP would need to grow by about 7 
percent per year for extreme poverty to fall 
to 3 percent by 2030. This would require a 
two­ to three­fold acceleration in Haiti’s growth 
rate with respect to its best performing years: 
a very ambitious outcome.
Policies to ensure more inclusiveness are 
needed. Increasing growth of the bottom 40 
percent by around one percentage point more 
than the best observed average growth rate 
(2005–09) would add considerable impetus 
to poverty reduction. In this scenario, per 
 capita real GDP of the bottom 40 percent 
would grow twice as fast as the mean. Such a 
performance would cause poverty to  decrease 
by 5 percentage points more than in the dis­
tribution neutral growth scenario, coming 
closer but still falling short from reaching the 3 
percent target for extreme poverty by 2030. To 
achieve the 3 percent target, a combination of 
faster and more inclusive growth would be 
needed: a growth of about 4 percent per year 
with the income of the bottom 40 growing at 
twice that speed. But what would be the mea­
sures needed to deliver this faster growth in 
lower income groups? Once identified, could 
they be ranked to assist the setting of priorities?
Human capital and political stability mat­
ter more for lower income groups. First, the 
correlation between potential drivers of income 
and the income growth of the poorest 20 and 
poorest 40 percent of households were esti­
mated, using household data for a sample of 
100 countries (box 5.1). This measure gives us 
the expected impact of changing one of these

drivers on the income growth of the poorest. 
Second, following Araujo et al. (2014), the stan­
dard deviation of each variable is taken to il­
lustrate the magnitude of possible or realistic 
change one could expect in this variable. A vari­
able with a higher standard deviation would 
be expected to be “easy to change.” Multiplying 
the two gives a rough estimate of the expected 
effect of a regular change in a variable for in­
come developments. The analysis finds that 
health (proxied by life expectancy), as well as 
education (measured by school enrollment) 
are important for increasing income genera­
tion at the bottom of the income distribution 
(figure 5.3). Reasonable changes in political 
stability (measured by the number of cabinet 
changes and within­regime instability) 

matter slightly more to the lower income 
groups. Infrastructure (measured by mobile 
phone usage, a common measure in the lit­
erature) and transparency, although not dis­
proportionally favoring the lowest income 
group, are nevertheless  important for overall 
income growth.
As an alternative, Haiti’s performance in key 
variables was benchmarked to a reference group. 
As a reference group, the average of an aspi­
rational group of countries was taken (Belize, 
the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Jamaica, Paraguay, and Peru). In terms of in­
come levels, these LAC countries broadly 
stand today where Haiti aspires to be after 
2030, i.e., beyond a threshold of US$2,310, 
taken to illustrate economic emergence.

BOX 5.1 Benchmarking the Drivers of Shared Prosperity: An Application 
to Haitia

We estimate economic magnitudes for key correlates of income growth at the mean, the bottom 40 
and 20 percent of the income distribution across a set of about 100 countries. While econometric 
exercises investigating determinants of GDP growth have been numerous, less is known about fac­
tors influencing household incomes at different segments of the income distribution. Empirical 
work by Dollar and Kraay (2002) and Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013) broadly rejects the 
idea that other factors than mean income growth would influence incomes of the poor, thus sug­
gesting that growth would be mostly distribution neutral, whereas other studies have attempted to 
outline key drivers of pro­poor growth (e.g., Bourguignon 2003; Ravallion and Chen 2007; 
Christiaensen, Punam, and Sanoh 2013). Our results add to this discussion and suggest that some 
factors indeed allow growth to be more beneficial for the bottom 40 or 20 percent of the income 
distribution.
Our data set is mainly based on Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). The data covers household data 
from the World Bank’s POVCALNET and the Luxembourg Income Study databases. Household 
income data is organized in “spells,” i.e., income changes between two survey years, calculated as 
average annual log differences.b These are calculated for average income, income at the bottom 20 
percent or the bottom 40 percent. We focus on those non­overlapping spells that are at least five 
years long, providing 299 spells for 117 countries with a median spell length of 6 years, which is 
also the preferred sample of Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). To this data, we add macroeco­
nomic variables, especially measures of political stability or institutions that are of particular inter­
est for Haiti.
Based on a fixed effect estimation, the results confirm that the income at the bottom 20 and 40 
percent grow with mean income. The estimated effect is a little smaller than previously thought, al­
though the estimated elasticity around 0.85 is statistically not significantly different from one. We 
also find that better health and education outcomes, as well as lower political instability, have an 
economically relevant effect for income growth that goes beyond the effect via mean income (i.e., it 
is stronger at the bottom of the distribution).

a. Based on a background paper prepared for the SCD by Kassia Antoine, Raju Singh, and Konstantin M. Wacker.
b. POVCALNET data is either income or consumption, LIS data is disposable income. We still refer to “income” in our paper.

Figure 5.4 illustrates Haiti’s position relative to 
its aspirational peers with respect to life ex­
pectancy. It shows that the country is in the 
lowest third percentile of the health distribu­
tion and lags behind the group average by 
approximately ten years. Figure 5.5 does the 
same for cabinet changes, highlighting that 
other peers suffered from comparable political 
instability (especially Peru, Ecuador, and 
Paraguay).

Again, closing the gaps in human capital 
and achieving greater political stability seem 
to have the highest potential for lower income 
groups. Multiplying the gap in the indicators 
between Haiti and the reference aspirational 
group by the unconditional effects estimated 
above captures the potential income gains Haiti 
may experience from closing the gap in these 
key variables. This idea, based on Araujo et al. 
(2014), not only highlights the areas where the

country lags behind most but implicitly weights 
this gap by the economic relevance of closing 
it.1 Figure 5.6 shows the income effect from 
closing the gap relative to the reference aspi­
rational group for different parts of the income 
distribution. Variables relating to health, edu­
cation, political stability clearly stand out. Again, 
closing Haiti’s gap in infrastructure, although 
not disproportionally favoring the lowest in­
come groups, is important for overall growth.
In turn, political instability—and conflict 
risk more generally—could be reduced through 
higher spending on social services and social 
protection. Security and political instability 
seems to be taken very often as exogenous fac­
tors, but recent international evidence suggests 
that these factors may at least partly be under 
the control of policy makers. Common sources 
of conflict include grievance, injustice, and

lack of economic opportunities Cederman, 
Weidmann, and Gleditsch (2011) or Wimmer, 
Cederman, and Min (2009). A growing liter­
ature on public spending and conflict show 
evidence that spending on education or health, 
for instance, could contribute reducing these 
sources of conf lict Singh, Bodea, and 
Higashijima (2014). Based on an empirical 
analysis that covers 148 countries from 1960 
to 2009, simulations for Haiti suggest that higher 
welfare spending (education, health, and so­
cial protection) is associated with lower risk 
of small­scale conflict onset (box 5.2).
Lack of economic opportunities seems to 
be driving violence and instability within Haiti. 
Building on the work presented in box 4.1, the 
spatial differences in conflict intensity across 
Haiti’s territory were examined to shed empir­
ical light on drivers of conflict. The results sug­
gest that economic shocks matter a great deal 
in explaining the pattern of conflict in Haiti. 
In particular, increases in remittances appear 
to reduce conflict intensity, consistent with the 
idea that by raising incomes they raise the op­
portunity cost of participating into violent ac­
tivities. Similarly, the study finds that an increase 

in agricultural and textile exports appear to 
reduce violence in departments which employ 
many people in these sectors. At the same time, 
incidents of violence are also clustered around 
political events such as elections and transi­
tions, suggesting the combination of economic 
and political factors contributing to violence.

Qualitative Assessment

The next step in the prioritization pro­
cess was a series of consultations with stake­
holders and the Country Team. Recognizing 
the data limitations and the difficulty to un­
tangle association and causality, any quanti­
tative assessment needed to be validated and 
comple mented by a qualitative assessment. The 
results of cross­country regressions are not to be 
interpreted mechanically, but serve as a starting 
point for a discussion about policy priorities. For 
this purpose, a two­day Country Team retreat 
was set up. In addition, continued consulta­
tions with the authorities and other stakeholders 
(including representatives of the established 
private sector and civil society) were carried out.2 
The Team also reached out to the Haitian dias­
pora and to beneficiaries of the Kore Fanmi 
program.3 Furthermore, a Bank­sponsored 
competition of academic papers was launched 
(“The Twin Goals Awards”) to foster research 
and debate, as well as identify any issue that 
may have been over­looked (box 5.3). These 
discussions led to the identification of broad 
themes or opportunities going forward.
Consultations validated the overall story 
line. Discussions confirmed that institutions, 
human capital, and infrastructure all mat­
tered for Haiti’s economic growth and shared 
prosperity. It was pointed out that economic 
and sector work on Haiti produced in 1980s 
and the early 1990s had already identified 
most of the challenges presented in the

Azam (2001) observed that “the occurrence of civil conflict is intimately related to the failure of gov­
ernment to deliver the type of public expenditure that people want; i.e., with a strong redistributive 
component such as health and education.” Governments could thus foster their legitimacy, and thereby 
reduce the risk of conflict, by signaling that they care about their population. This could be done in a 
variety of ways, such as increased spending for water sanitation, securing basic health needs, or provid­
ing a strong system of education (Stasavage 2005).
Through welfare policies that influence positively the 
living standards of citizens, governments can out­
spend the opposition, help ing gain support from a 
broad segment of the population, co­opt political 
opposition, and decrease the incentives for organiz­
ing a rebellion. Social safety nets, transfers and in­
vestment in public goods show people that the state 
cares, and prevents disadvantaged members of soci­
ety from falling below a certain level of poverty and 
experiencing absolute desperation. Positive encoun­
ters with frontline service officials is argued to pro­
vide a source of legitimacy for the state, particularly 
in fragile and conflict­affected situations where the 
state was previously mistrusted, or outright feared 
(Brinkerhoff, Wetterberg, and Stephen 2012). Thyne 
(2006) suggests that education promotes social cohesion by encouraging students to cultivate interper­
sonal skills and thus learn how to resolve disputes peacefully.
Our empirical analysis covers 148 countries over 1960–2009 and uses a random effects logit model 
with regional dummies and a set of standard control variables to predict the probability of conflict. 
To measure the onset of violent conflict, we used the Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) from the 
Uppsala Conflict Data Program PRIO for years 1960–2009 (Gleditsch et al. 2002, Version 4.1.) to 
generate a dichotomous variable that takes the value of one in years with a new conflict onset and 
zero otherwise. This dataset has become the standard reference for cross­country analyses of con­
flict determinants. The onset of conflict was defined with those above a threshold of 25 battle 
deaths per year.
The results suggest that higher welfare expenditure (education, health and social) is associated with 
lower risk of conflict. In order to simulate the effects for Haiti, the coefficients of the cross­country 
regression were taken and all variables in the model set at their average for Haiti with the exception 
for welfare spending that we let vary. The Figure above illustrates the reduction in the risk on con­
flict onset associated with higher welfare spending.

previous sections. It was thought already at the 
time unlikely that much economic progress 
could be achieved without an improvement in 
educational quality and access. Infrastructure 
had deteriorated badly. Migration to urban 
areas had strained water and sanitation facil­
ities, and increased urban vulnerabilities and 
people exposures. It was argued that it would 
be difficult to tackle these problems effectively 
without first addressing the issue of gover­
nance. In addition, the consultations high­
lighted a number of other dimensions.
Maintaining the stability of the macroeco­
nomic environment called for immediate at­
tention. There was a broad recognition that 
progress had been made in restoring macro­
economic stability and this did not seem to be 
at the moment a constraint to faster growth or 
greater shared prosperity. This assessment was, 
however, backward looking and concerns were 
expressed going forward. The decline in donor 
assistance and lower availability of concessional 
financing following the drop in international 
oil prices raised questions about the sustain­
ability of many social programs and of the re­
cent progress in improving access to many basic 
services. Even the established private sector 
expressed concern about the tighter mone­
tary stance being followed.
Turning to more medium­term challenges, 
it was stressed that progress needed to be made 
simultaneously on several fronts. For Haiti to 
break from its past and achieve meaningful 
progress towards poverty reduction, a piece­
meal approach to reform focusing on a spe­
cific sector would not work. Actions or reforms 
should not be seen as independent from each 
other, but needed to fit within a package. Vio­
lence and political instability, for instance, are 
seen as a binding constraint to faster growth 
and greater economic opportunities. However, 
both the UN forces and NGOs dealing with 

gangs recognized that greater economic op­
portunities were in turn needed to reduce vi­
olence. Improving education without better 
economic opportunities fed greater emigra­
tion. Discussions in villages highlighted that 
improving seeds or production techniques 
without better transport or access to markets 
just depressed prices and could make farmers 
worse off.
Controlling cholera illustrates the need for 
a multi­sectoral approach. Cholera control will 
contribute to improving the health of Haitians, 
particularly of the poor, and fostering the long­
term development of the country. The most 
effective way to achieve this involves multi­sec­
toral interventions aimed at improving health 
care, hygiene, an access to clean water and im­
proved sanitation. Cholera cannot be con­
trolled without addressing primary vectors of 
transmission of the disease such as the lack of 
safe water supply, inappropriate excreta man­
agement and the absence of sanitation. Health 
interventions are critical to eliminate deaths 
from cholera, but to sustainably prevent new 
cases of cholera from emerging, these alone 
will not be enough. Concurrent and substan­
tial improvements in water supply and sani­
tation coverage, including medium­term 
invest ments in this sector targeted at high 
incidence and high risk zones are essential.
Building the social contract was flagged as 
particularly important. Most modern democ­
racies use fiscal measures to finance the State 
and redistribute wealth. In return, the State is 
expected to provide key services. In Haiti, both 
sides of this contract are very weak—few peo­
ple or businesses pay taxes and the State 
struggles to provide services. State institutions 
are needed to provide security and public ser­
vices, and to write the regulations that will allow 
a market economy to operate. The established 
private sector complained about the power

BOX 5.3 Bank-Sponsored Competition of Academic Papers

In order to foster research and debate, a call was issued for research papers identifying the most 
critical constraints and opportunities facing Haiti in accelerating progress toward the goals of end­
ing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The competition was 
open to all Haitian scholars and was intended to provide a Haitian perspective to the debate, as well 
as identify any issue that the existing literature may have over­looked.
This proposal and the rules were prepared with the Deans of the universities present in Port­au­
Prince. The competition was widely advertised in academic circles and in regular newspapers, and 
submissions were received from Haiti (Port­au­Prince and Cap Haïtien), Canada and the United 
States. The papers were reviewed by a panel of World Bank researchers and leading Haitian figures, 
including the Presidents of the Association of Haitian Economists, the Haitian Arbitration and 
Mediation Division, and the North­East Chamber of Commerce, as well as professors from the 
American University and the Autonomous University of Mexico.
The three winners were awarded cash prizes for their contributions and presented their work at a 
conference at the State University of Haiti in November, 2014. The event was attended by represen­
tatives from academia, civil society, government, and the international community. This was an 
opportunity to discuss issues related to inequality, inadequate competition and economic opportu­
nities, and the absence of a social contract between the State and its citizens which, among other is­
sues, were identified by the participants as impediments to growth.
More particularly, while the papers submitted varied in approaches and emphases, they converged 
on a common set of themes underscoring Haiti’s scarcity of human and institutional capital. Most 
authors agreed that Haiti’s history of violence, exclusion, and foreign interference explained the 
country’s difficulty in developing a shared national vision for its future, as well as the needed insti­
tutions and social capital to implement it. All papers argued that aid dependence and the interfer­
ence of external governmental and non­governmental actors continued to prevent Haiti from 
developing home­grown solutions and institutional capacity. In this regard, authors stressed the 
State’s ineffectiveness in fulfilling basic functions, such as enforcing the rule of law, collecting taxes, 
and delivering services. Poor outcomes in education were seen by most as a principal cause of 
Haiti’s poor governance, lack of competitiveness, low productivity, and high unemployment. 
Urbanization and population growth were identified as major contributors to vulnerability, and the 
need for a more balanced spatial organization of the country was underscored.

surges and outage, the poor road infrastruc­
ture, or health conditions that forced it to pro­
vide the missing services that it would expect 
from the State. In line with the results of the 
2010 report entitled “Voice of the Voice less,” there 
was a feeling that there was a need to foster a 
greater sense of civic responsibility, overcome 
social divisions, and establish a more 

accountable State. There was a very strong 
social demand for a balanced and coherent de­
velopment of the country, easier access to 
public services as well as more job and edu­
cational opportunities outside what is often 
referred to as the “republic of Port­au­
Prince.” A very large majority wanted to be 
able to live near places of origin without

having to relocate to the capital to study, 
make a living or access public services. For 
this to happen, civil society and representa­
tives of the private sector stressed the need to 
hold regular elections. There also needs to be 
more productive citizen engagement, includ­
ing mechanisms that effectively channel citi­
zens’ voice and demands to the State so that 
their concerns can be addressed.
State capacity needs to be strengthened. The 
most binding constraints are probably also 
those that would take most time to fix. Poor 
governance and the need to strengthen the state 
were generally viewed as the most important 
constraints. Without improvements in these 
areas, it was thought that little else could be 
achieved. Even for the fastest transforming 
countries, improving institutional quality from 
the level of a country like Haiti to that of Ghana 
takes in the range of 15–30 years (World Bank 
2011). Relatedly, Pritchett, Woolcock, and 
Andrews (2013) find that rates of improvement 
in measures such as quality of bureaucracy 
and administrative capacity are typically very 
low in developing countries, even with sub­
stantial donor effort. They conclude that “coun­
tries like Haiti or Liberia will take many decades 
to reach even a moderate capability country 
like India.” The lengthiness of the process 
should, however, not deter immediate action, 
but only call for more realistic expectations.
In this regard, there was a lot of criticism 
about the limited aid effectiveness and ca­
pacity building. The international community 
was criticized for not contributing enough to 
build the needed capacity. There was a rec­
ognition that in the immediate aftermath of 
the earthquake, the Haitian government had 
very limited capacity as almost all government 
buildings were destroyed and agencies were 
operating in a state of emergency. Yet years 
later, it was observed that donors continued 

to be reluctant to fund the government. 
Concerns about the lack of capacity within 
the Government of Haiti, as wel l as en­
trenched systems of patronage, corruption, 
and inefficiency could be valid. However, 
government capacity will never be built or 
improved if donors continue to bypass local 
institutions in favor of non­State actors. By 
circumventing the Haitian government, do­
nors were perceived by many as prolonging 
this process and continuing to undermine 
the public sector.
To foster greater competition, barriers to 
market entry needed to be removed and 
small private sector actors supported. 
Representatives of the established private 
sector recognized the lack of competition ex­
isting in Haiti’s economy, a reflection for 
them of the country’s unfavorable business 
environment. Without proper contract en­
forcement, business had to be kept between 
trusted partners, from credit to the whole lo­
gistics chain. Civil society expressed concern 
about the higher prices and the possible lack 
of innovation that limited competition im­
plied. Consultations flagged thus the impor­
tance of supporting domestic informal and 
smaller private sector actors in strengthening 
their capacity to add value to the Haitian 
economy. This included facilitating access to 
available capital, stronger business manage­
ment capacity, better linkage of producers to 
markets and improved infrastructure to sup­
port such links. Direct connections with eco­
nomic partners outside of Haiti were also 
suggested as an avenue to explore. The need 
for developing such access for agribusiness, 
tourism, and manufacturing, among others, 
outside of Port­au­Prince was underlined as 
particularly important to encourage growth 
that would be geographically better balanced 
and more pro­poor. Such growth could also 

Priorities

contribute to reducing migration to overly 
crowded and vulnerable urban environ­
ments, particularly in Port­au­Prince.
Furthermore, there was not only a need 
for more jobs, but also for better jobs. There 
was a call to recognize where people actually 
worked. It was pointed out that the private sec­
tor in Haiti was not only limited to a couple 
of large enterprises. Most people in Haiti 
were occupied in a less visible private sec­
tor : in the agriculture and informal sectors, 
two sectors that had been neglected so far. 
The potential contribution of the formal sec­
tor in creating jobs was recognized, but it 
was not seen as becoming the main employer 
in Haiti any time soon. Incomes generated in 
agriculture or in the informal sector are, 
however, not sufficient to pull people out of 
poverty. The challenge is thus to enhance 
the productivity—hence the earnings—of 
those already employed in agriculture and 
the informal sector, while at the same time 
creating more formal jobs. Providing greater 
economic opportunities was also flagged as 
a critical factor to reduce criminal or political 
violence, especially in urban areas, as this 
would decrease grievances and frustrations 
while increasing the opportunity costs of 
joining gangs.
The importance of reducing vulnerabilities 
was also stressed. In the face of recurring shocks 
and vulnerability, better risk management strat­
egies and targeting in social protection should 
be a priority to protect households and indi­
vidual livelihoods. Disaster risks need to be 
identified and understood better. Risks need 
to be reduced through better awareness when 
investing. One million people are vulnerable 
to shocks that could push them into poverty. 
Despite the significant expansion of social as­
sistance provision within the EDE PÈP frame­
work, the system remains very fragmented and 

untargeted. Furthermore, it was argued that 
it would be important to continue strength­
ening and mainstreaming disaster risk man­
agement activities and make sure disaster risk 
management becomes a core component of a 
sustainable poverty reduction and economic 
growth strategy. Financial protection strate­
gies, particularly if they are designed to meet 
the needs of the population in extreme poverty, 
can help protect the government and house­
holds from the economic burden of shocks and 
disasters.
Finally, the consultations made it clear that 
there was limited evidence to inform planning 
and targeting of programs and policies. The re­
cently finalized Poverty Assessment conducted 
jointly by the Bank and the Haitian authorities, 
as well as the ongoing Public Expen diture 
Review, are filling some of the knowledge gaps, 
but many more remain, making the conclu­
sions of this SCD tentative. Dis  cussions with 
the Country Team and with stakeholders con­
firmed that it was difficult to carry out effec­
tive development policies without appropriate 
statistics or analytics (see appendix C for a 
list of gaps). For instance, the knowledge and 
monitoring of the actual situation of WSS 
services—critical to contain water­borne dis­
eases such as cholera—in Haiti is limited and 
fragmented, hampering the efficient prioriti­
zation and programming of investments.
Policy packages—or buckets—rather than 
independent activities in sectors were thus rec­
ommended. Consultations identified five broad 
themes around which activities needed to be 
organized in order to ignite a process whereby 
Haiti could set itself on a new development 
path: (a) maintaining macroeconomic stabil­
ity, while meeting developmental needs; (b) im­
proving statistics and analytics; (c) creating 
greater economic opportunities and better jobs, 
including through infrastructure and human 

80 

Priorities

capital; (d) (re)building the social contract; and 
(e) reducing vulnerabilities and building resil­
ience. Progress on all these themes is needed 
simultaneously. In light of the tighter budget 
constraints facing the government, maintain­
ing the stability of the macroeconomic envi­
ronment, and improving knowledge and statis tics 
to increase the effectiveness of public policy 
(including more transparent fiscal reporting) 
call particularly for immediate attention. Further 
work will be needed to flesh out in more de­
tail what would need to be included in the pack­
age of reforms and actions to achieve these 
objectives, but the possible content of these 
buckets are spelled out in a bit more detail in 
the next section.

Five Priority Areas for 
Policy Action

Short-Term

Maintaining macroeconomic stability, 
while meeting develop ment needs. 
Fiscal policy needs to find a balance between 
contributing to higher and more inclusive 
growth while maintaining sustainability. 
Haiti’s dependence on external assistance 
at a time of declining aid is a challenge, but 
could also be seen as an opportunity for the 
country to reduce its reliance on the donor 
community. The reduced availability of con­
cessional financing following the decline in 
international oil prices has added urgency to 
this need. In this regard, achieving a greater 
mobilization of own fiscal revenue will be im­
portant as already initiated, as well as identi­
fying options to improve the composition of 
public spending (reduce fuel subsidies and 
transfers to the state­own electricity company) 
as well as its efficiency (especially public 
investment).4

More particularly, there is an urgent need 
to increase tax revenue and to diversify the rev­
enue base away from trade taxes. Despite a rise 
in revenue of the past decade, Haiti has one of 
the lowest revenue mobilization ratios in the 
region. Furthermore, Haiti’s tax system also 
tends to be regressive, relying heavily on in­
direct taxes. Corporate and personal income 
tax rates are largely comparable to the regional 
average. A large share of corporate income 
tax revenue is, however, lost because of exemp­
tions. Anecdotal evidence suggests a number 
of taxes that generate little revenue but impose 
high compliance costs on businesses (“nui­
sance” taxes) and reducing them would be a 
better alternative to attract investors. The per­
sonal income tax brackets are also not well 
aligned with the country’s socio­economic struc­
ture with top income tax brackets only apply­
ing to a very small share of taxpayers. Ongoing 
work to move from the current turn­over tax 
to a simple VAT is welcome.
Fuel price subsidies have been eliminated, 
but could return. The rise in retail fuel prices 
in October 2014, combined with a decline 
in international oil prices has allowed the 
government to eliminate the fuel price subsi­
dies that were burdening the budget (about 
2 percent of GDP in 2013). Such subsidies favor 
the rich, more so than subsidies on food, health 
or education. International oil prices are, how­
ever, volatile and without the introduction of 
an automatic price adjustment mechanism for 
petroleum products, fuel price subsidies could 
return to haunt the budget, this time under 
tighter financing constraints. Fuel price sub­
sidies are, however, only one dimension of 
broader development challenges: more gener­
ally, the overall policy framework to develop 
urban transport, and promote more sustain­
able and cost effective energy needs to be 
strengthened.

Priorities 

81

Despite rising public investment, eco­
nomic growth has not accelerated so far in 
Haiti. Haiti still performs poorly for selected 
infrastructure indicators, such as access to 
electricity, roads or ports. Against this back­
drop, high public investment should have 
been expected to contribute to reducing bot­
tlenecks to faster growth. This paradox is, 
however, nothing new in Haiti. Several rea­
sons have been put forward, ranging from 
deficiencies in the country’s national ac­
counting system to chronic lack of mainte­
nance or simply the unproductive nature of 
the investment itself. Poor past donor coor­
dination and the high volatility of external 
aid have been argued to have affected the 
impact of investments in Haiti. This disap­
pointing outcome stems also in part from 
very weak public investment management, 
hampering the effectiveness of public 
investments.

Improving statistics and analytics. 
Statistical and analytical capacities would 
need to be strengthened. Access to timely 
and consolidated fiscal data would be 
 important to monitor appropriately public 
spending, especially with tighter budget 
 constraints. More regular statistical surveys 
on critical sectors for the Haitian economy 
will enable better analysis on poverty and 
growth, as well as allow the government to 
monitor progress and adopt appropriate pol­
icies. In particular, the absence of a recent 
census hampers the design and costing of 
policies for basic services such as health or 
education. Regular monitoring of poverty 
and living conditions is a necessary step to 
promoting evidence­based and effective pol­
icy making. In this regard, strengthening the 
national statistical system through invest­
ments in this sector will be critical.

Medium-Term

(Re)building the social contract. 
Rebuilding or building the social contract 
between Haiti’s state and its citizens will re­
quire greater transparency and accountabil­
ity. More resources and time should be devoted 
to build capacity within the Haitian adminis­
tration rather than use non­State actors to de­
liver services. Developing an appropriate fiscal 
revenue base will require a renewed climate 
of accountability and transparency from both 
the government and the private sector. This mu­
tual accountability should be centered around 
the private sector’s commitment to full tax com­
pliance, and the government’s commitment to 
meeting minimum service levels and manag­
ing budgets, decision­making and funding in 
full transparency. More broadly, it will require 
a well­functioning civil society and set of in­
stitutions, including regular elections and 
greater autonomy at the community level al­
lowing for the emergence of local leadership.
Greater legitimacy will also be needed, 
through the provision of basic services across 
the country. The provision of services for which 
people do care would enhance the legitimacy 
of the State and provide more equal economic 
opportunities. In particular, the public provi­
sion of services to increase the human capital 
accumulation capacity of the poor—such as 
health or education—will be essential in break­
ing the vicious circle of intergenerational pov­
erty. Expanding access and the quality of 
services, while reducing costs among house­
holds, will be critical to improving health and 
education outcomes, particularly among chil­
dren and women. Achieving universal primary 
enrollment will also require a short­ to medi­
um­term financing plan and an improved co­
ordination with social protection programs. 
On the health care front, policies should aim 

82 

Priorities

at improving the accountability of service pro­
viders, increasing service utilization and qual­
ity, and expanding prevent ive hea lth care 
services to reduce costs. In both sectors, fur­
thermore, the establishment of an informa­
tion system allowing for better identification 
and targeting of vulnerable populations, as well 
as for services quality control, will be critical 
in optimizing the use of available resources.

Creating greater economic opportuni­
ties and better jobs. Private economic 
 activities are the engines for faster and more 
inclusive growth. More vibrant private eco­
nomic activities will be critical to create 
greater opportunities to escape poverty. In 
this regard, macro­economic stability has to 
be maintained, as well as vulnerabilities con­
tained and resilience strengthened. More gen­
erally, the business environment should be made 
more favorable. All stakeholders, including the 
government, the established private sector, and 
donors, should agree and adhere to a consis­
tent and comprehensive private sector devel­
opment strategy to maximize the positive role 
of the private sector in channeling investment 
into viable and productive sectors to create jobs 
and generate income.
Foreign direct investment, encouraged by 
a more favorable business environment, could 
provide new players and enhance competition. 
Haiti has had a limited, but broadly positive 
experience with FDI, especially in infrastruc­
ture. The entry of Digicel in the telecommu­
nication sector in 2006 has resulted in widening 
access to 2.4 million people. The E­Power proj­
ect introduced a lower cost producer while 
increasing power generation capacity in Port­
au­Prince by 35 percent. These successes are 
few, unfortunately, hampered by a lack of trans­
parency in existing sectoral policy and regu­
latory environments, and limited institutional 

capacity in Haiti’s public sector, further com­
pounding the overall difficult business 
environment.
Policies to boost households’ income—
wherever they work—are essential to sustain­
ing and accelerating welfare gains. In urban 
areas, achieving this objective will have to in­
volve the creation of economic oppor tuni­
ties and better jobs . A higher level of 
education and skills, for example, is cor­
related with higher labor income. In rural 
areas, the stagnation of both extreme pov­
erty and income inequality observed be­
tween 2000 and 2012 reflects the increas ing 
rel iance on the low­produc t iv ity agricul­
tural sector. Because 80 percent of the ex­
treme poor live in rural areas, it will be 
necessary to develop this sector by means of 
policies that support income diversification. 
Such a diversification could contribute at 
spreading risk, strengthening food security, 
and preserving biodiversity. Furthermore, 
both in urban and rural areas, it is neces­
sary to promote expanded access to inputs 
(e.g., seeds, electricity, finance, water) and to 
product markets (e.g., transport), as well as 
improve the business environment in order 
to increase the profitability of employment. 
Greater economic opportunities and better 
jobs, especially in urban areas, would contrib­
ute in reducing crime and violence, further 
improving the business climate.
To reduce poverty and increase productiv­
ity in a more balanced manner across Haiti’s 
territory, a multipronged approach is critical. 
Opportunities and advantages presented by 
various regions outside of the  capital should 
be developed. This approach would aim to 
broaden the pool of economic actors and 
support their contribution to  productive ac­
tivities and growth, in an environment en­
compassing most of the poor and the poorest. 

Priorities 

83

Multipronged investments in physical and ser­
vice connectivity between rural communities 
and producers, and small and regional town 
markets and consumers, would add value to 
the local economy, help limit post­harvest 
production losses, reduce the isolation of local 
populations and their disconnection from the 
State, and stimulate  economic activity. If con­
ceived as a set of invest ments in a given geo­
graphical space, together with the productivity 
support discussed above and the expansion of 
services discussed below, such an approach 
would provide an avenue for accelerating 
growth for the bottom 40 percent, for building 
greater confidence of the poor in a better fu­
ture, and, in the medium term, possibly pro­
vide alternatives to migration.

Reducing vulnerabilities and building 
resilience. Institutional arrangements for 
emergency preparedness and disaster preven­
tion and mitigation would need to be strength­
ened. A key initial step toward upgrading the 
management of disaster risks involves improv­
ing the identification and understanding of 
 disaster risks in Haiti by quantifying and antic­
ipating the potential impacts of natural haz­
ards on Haitian society and the economy. It 
would also be important to reduce existing 
risks and avoid the creation of new risks by in­
tegrating risk awareness in public policies and 
investments. In light of the vulnerability of ag­
riculture and its volatile contribution to eco­
nomic growth, efforts to make production 
more resilient to adverse weather conditions 
are called for. Given the potential threat natu­
ral hazards pose to the sustainability of public 
finances, developing an integrated disaster risk 
financing and insurance strategy would also 
help ensure greater fiscal capacity in the after­
math of a disaster, while managing the volatil­
ity on fiscal accounts.

Progress made thus far in understand­
ing and analyzing urban resiliency needs to 
be supported. Fol low ing the work on urban 
growth and resi liency recent ly carr ied out , 
more research is needed to document (a) 
urban demographic trends, (b) rural to 
urban migration trends, (c) urban surface 
growth and possible sprawl including land 
tenure, (d) the determinants of urbaniza­
t ion and the role of secondar y c it ies , (e) 
urban­rura l l inkages and the limitat ions 
imposed on the rura l economy by urban 
spraw l, (f ) investments and public­ser vice 
delivery needs for urban areas to address 
the double­challenge of poverty and risk, (g) 
the role of cities in reducing poverty and 
through which channels it is occurring, and 
(h) the link between economic and disas­
ter­r isk vu lnerabi lit ies , i.e. , whether the 
group of people that just came out of pov­
er ty are st i l l vu lnerable to poverty reversals 
as a result of future disasters.
Social protection would also need to be 
less fragmented and better targeted. The 
foundational blocks of social protection 
should be built, starting with a targeting sys­
tem. Deve loping a targeting system is an es­
sential step to enhancing human capital 
accumulation among the poor and vulnerable 
using, among others, a national poverty map 
allowing for the identification of pockets of 
poverty. This would include moving forward 
with the development of a unique registr y 
of social protection beneficiaries in priority 
areas. In this regard, the Haitian authorities 
have developed a national targeting tool and 
are in the process of establishing a national 
registry of beneficiaries. Both of these mea­
sures will improve the efficiency and effec­
tiveness of social protection programs. In a 
second stage, the coverage of social safety 
nets could be increased, especially among

households with children, while ensuring 
sound targeting and improving the quality 
of relevant programs, particularly those able 
to enhance human capital.

Data Gaps

The SCD has highlighted a number of data 
gaps that would call for attention:
•	 Consolidation and access to timely fiscal 
data: tighter financing constraints make it 
even more urgent to track public spend­
ing appropriately. Differences in budget 
classifications and the absence of an effec­
tive single treasury account lead to a frag­
mentation of fiscal data and prevents a 
comprehensive monitoring of public 
spending from budget appropriation to 
payment.
•	 A new census: the last census dates back to 
2003. Many events have taken place since, 
and the dynamics and location of people 
may have substantially changed. Without 
knowing the size of the country’s popula­
tion and its distribution across the national 
territory, it is very difficult to design and 
cost any public policy.

Notes

•	 Employment and labor productivity: a bet­
ter understanding of the dynamics of job 
creation and the factors behind low labor 
productivity is needed, especially in the in­
formal sector.
•	 Agriculture census: the last census dates back 
from 2008. A better idea of what is pro­
duced where and factors preventing peo­
ple moving out of subsistence farming is 
needed.
•	 Single registry of beneficiaries: the social 
protection system in Haiti is fragmented 
and lacks transparency. A single registry 
of beneficiaries is needed to improve the 
efficiency of the system through a better 
targeting of its beneficiaries.
•	 Survey on governance and corruption: the 
survey measures the perception of corrup­
tion and governance from households, pub­
lic servants, the private sector, and NGOs, 
but the last one dates back to 2007.
Rebasing the National Accounts and revis­
ing the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM): the 
most recent available SAM dates back to 1986. 
Haiti’s economic structure has evolved and 
a better understanding of its current inter­
sectoral linkages is needed.

 1. While it is implicitly assumed that a one­unit 
improvement in closing a large gap demands 
less effort than an equivalent one­unit im­
provement in a small gap, this might not nec­
essarily be the case. Our exercise hence does 
not explicitly take into account the costs or 
efforts of closing this gap.
 2. These stylized facts, or parts of them, have 
been discussed with the authorities and vari­
ous stakeholders, particularly at the Conference 
on Growth and Employment organized by 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance in Port­
au­Prince on March 17, at the Central Bank’s 

37th Anniversary Conference on June 9 and at 
the launch of the Competitive Industries and 
Innovation Program Training Program at the 
Limonade Campus on June 17. These facts were 
also presented to representatives of the private 
sector on May 19, at the occasion of the 35th 
Haitian Business Delegation visit to Washington 
DC. They have also served to frame the discus­
sions with the government, donors, and the rep­
resentatives of the private sector during the MD 
and the RVP’s recent visit to Haiti, July 7–9, 2014.

Appendix A: Price Comparison Analysis

The price comparison analysis uses three 
data sources to explore whether food prices in 
Haiti are higher than other countries from 
Latin America and the Caribbean region (as 
well as North America): (a) “Numbeo,” an on­
line database of user contributed data on cost 
of living, (b) Ministry of Economy and Finance 
of Haiti and (c) FAO GIEWS Food Price Data.
The first database applies a common 
methodology in gathering price data across 
countries, thus strengthening the comparabil­
ity of price information used in this analysis. 
However, since price data for Haiti is only avail­
able for 2014 at “Numbeo,” this only  allows for 
cross­section analysis. Data provided by the 
Haitian Ministry of Economy and Fi nance on 
Haitian prices for 2010–2013 is com bined with 
“Numbeo” data for the panel data analysis. 
Finally, for additional robustness, the analysis 
is replicated with prices from the FAO 
GIEWS database for the available food prod­
uct (rice).

The baseline empirical specification for 
the price comparison analysis follows the 
equation: Ln(Priceijt) = β1GDPit + β2Ln(Xit) + 
β3Haiti + ηj + δt + εijt
where: i = country ; j = product; t = year ; 
Xit = GDP per capita, cost of imports, and 
 duties imports (as control variables); and 
ηj = product fixed effects. The Haiti dummy 
variable captures the relative price levels in 
Haiti compared to the average across other 
countries after adjusting for the differences 
in per capita GDP PPP, import costs, cus­
toms duties, and product type as well as 
time­specific effects.
The food products were selected based 
on availability across databases, the rele­
vance in the Haitians consumption basket 
and product characteristics. For example, 
products were selected that are relatively 
similar (or homogeneous) across countries 
in order to minimize the differences associ­
ated with product differentiation.
