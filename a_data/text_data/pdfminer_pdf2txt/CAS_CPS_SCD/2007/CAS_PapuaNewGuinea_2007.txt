EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Fo l low ing a pe r iod of po l i t ica l stabilization and economic recovery, Papua New Guinea 
(PNG ) has emerged f rom the climate of uncertainty that precipitated the 2005 In te r im Strategy 
Note (ISN). Pos i t ive developments inc lude the passage o f leg is la t ion t o strengthen con t inu i ty in 
government, reco rd -h igh prices for the coun t ry ’s expo r t commodities, sound macroeconomic 
policies, im p r o v e d f isca l discipline, and a mo re pos i t ive a i d environment. Though the B a n k 
G roup and Government o f Papua N e w Gu inea (GoPNG ) have faced d i f f icu l t ies in the past, the 
re la t ionsh ip has im p r o v e d and b o t h parties are c omm i t t e d t o w o r k i n g together and w i t h other 
development partners t o achieve the country’s development objectives, as expressed in the 
M e d i um -T e rm Deve lopmen t Strategy (M TD S ) f o r 2005 -20 10 and the na t iona l M i l l e n n i u m 
Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs). 

ii. Despite 
these achievements, important challenges remain 
in fostering 
inclusive, 
sustainable development in PNG . Though the economy has g r ow n in recent years, this g r ow t h 
has been concentrated in the f o rm a l sector w i t h l i t t l e impac t o n the l ives o f p o o r people, mos t o f 
w h o m l i v e in r u r a l areas and depend o n ag r icu l tu re and i n f o rm a l ac t iv i t ies f o r the i r l ive l ihoods . 
I t i s estimated that m o r e people are l iv ing in pove r ty n o w than a decade ago, and the creation of 
j o b s and other income-earning opportunities i s n o t keep ing up w i t h the needs o f a g r ow i n g 
popu la t ion . W om e n and young people are pa r t icu la r ly disadvantaged by unequal access t o jobs 
and services. T h e ava i lab i l i ty and qua l i ty o f basic in f ras t ruc tu re and social services have 
declined, h o l d i n g back business g r ow t h and human development outcomes. The r a p i d spread o f 
H IV IA IDS poses a serious threat t o fu tu re p r o d u c t i v i t y unless the ep idem ic i s b rough t unde r 
con t ro l th rough decisive, coordinated action. Y e t systems f o r distributing resources and 
coo rd ina t ing across levels o f government are weak, and p o l i t i c a l leaders face incentives t o place 
the interests o f the i r l o c a l group above those o f the na t ion as a whole. Within the coun t ry ’s r i c h 
cu l tu ra l d ive rs i ty , there i s a po ten t ia l f o r social fragmentation and exclusion, and a l a c k o f 
security in some areas o f the coun t ry deters p r iva te investment and f reedom o f movement. 

iii. The Wo r ld Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) seeks to address these 
challenges through a long-term partnership w i t h the government, people, and development 
partners of Papua New Guinea. The CAS f o r 2008-2011 i s designed as the first in a series 
cove r ing the n e x t 15 t o 2 0 years, w h i c h w i l l a l l ow the B a n k G roup and G o PNG t o take ac t ion o n 
challenges that can be addressed in the short term, w h i l e starting t o w o r k o n issues that requ i re a 
long - te rm approach. 
In an e f fo r t t o support coun t ry ownership, the CAS i s aligned t o the 
Government’s M T D S , wh ich seeks t o alleviate pove r ty th rough economic g row th and social 
development. The CAS emphasizes close coo rd ina t ion w i t h development partners, i n c l u d i n g 
p rog ramma t ic support in specific sectors, t o m a x im i z e a i d effectiveness w i t h i n each donor’s 
comparative advantage and available resources. Partnerships w i t h c i v i l society and the p r iva te 
sector w i l l also be strengthened t o enhance p rog ram relevance and sustainability. The strategy i s 
a results-based CAS, de f in ing expected outcomes ove r the nex t fou r years as w e l l as the B a n k 
Group’s proposed con t r ibu t ion t o longe r - te rm na t iona l development goals. 

i v . 
The CAS has been prepared jo in t ly by the Wo r ld Bank and Znternational Finance 
Co rpo ra t ion ( IFC ) . The first j o i n t strategy f o r PNG, this CAS recognizes the c r i t i c a l importance 
o f p r iva te sector development in PNG and the substantial scope f o r co l labo ra t ion o n this agenda. 
T h e B a n k and IFC w i l l w o r k t o integrate the i r coun t ry programs, f r o m upstream analysis t o 
comp lemen ta ry investment and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies in areas such as forestry, fisheries, ex t rac t ive 
industries development, agriculture, infrastructure, and the ove ra l l business environment.

Executive Summary 

11 

v . 
The overarching goal of 
the CAS is to support poverty reduction in PNG . T h e B a n k 
G roup w i l l focus i t s in te rven t ions o n t w o strategic pillars: (I) P romo t ing and ma in ta in ing sound 
economic and na tu ra l resource management, and (11) Im p r o v i n g l ive l ihoods and service de l ive ry , 
especially f o r the r u r a l poo r . This dua l focus w i l l a l l ow the CAS t o support con t inued g r ow t h 
under the current na tu ra l resource-based economy, w h i l e putting in p lace the cond i t ions f o r a 
mo re diversified, sustainable g r ow t h pa th in the future. Within Pillar I, ac t iv i t ies w i l l focus o n 
strengthening governance, ma in ta in ing sound management o f the ex t rac t ive industries, and 
p romo t ing e f fec t ive and sustainable management o f na tu ra l resources. Pillar II w i l l inc lude 
targeted in te rven t ions t o support p r iva te sector development, enhance r u r a l l ive l ihoods , im p r o v e 
l o c a l service delivery, expand access t o infrastructure, and support mu l t i -dono r approaches in 
hea l th and education. E f f o r t s t o im p r o v e governance and empowe r w om e n and you th w i l l be 
mainstreamed across b o t h pillars. T h e CAS i s designed t o be de l ive red o n t w o p la t fo rms , 
supporting p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l development at the na t iona l l e v e l w h i l e w o r k i n g t o imp rove 
p lann ing and service de l ive ry at the l o c a l level. The B a n k G roup ’s engagement in PNG w i l l be 
gu ided by the p r inc ip les o f long - te rm partnership, Government leadership, coun t ry ownership, 
results focus, and openness and transparency. 

v i . 
The CAS aims to leverage the Bank G roup ’s modest f inanc ia l resources for PNG by 
supplementing a focused country p rog ram w i t h regional and global resources. The annual I D A 
a l loca t ion i s ten ta t ive ly estimated at U S $ 45 m i l l i o n f o r FY08 and U S $ 30-32 m i l l i o n thereafter, 
depending o n PNG’s performance re la t ive t o other I D A borrowers. G i v e n these resource 
l im i ta t ions , the CAS aims t o res t r ic t new I D A operations t o a m a x im um o f three in a typ ica l 
year; “core” ana ly t ica l pieces w i l l be l im i t e d t o t w o per year. Coun t ry p rog ram interventions 
w i l l focus on areas where the B a n k Group has pe r fo rmed w e l l in the past o r where i t can d raw o n 
g loba l know ledge and experience t o complement the w o r k o f other development partners. I n 
addition, the CAS w i l l d raw u p o n reg iona l and g loba l funds such as the G l o b a l Env i ronmen t 
Fac i l i ty , In f ras t ruc tu re f o r G r ow t h Fac i l i ty , and Forest Ca rbon Partnership Fac i l i ty . 

v i i . 
The program presented in Table 6 (page 28) is ambitious in relation to the Bank G roup ’s 
budgetary and lending resources. I t shou ld be understood mo re as a m e n u o f v a l i d assistance 
ac t iv i t ies than a l i t e r a l roadmap, and w i l l a l l ow f l e x i b i l i t y t o focus o n issues and areas where 
B a n k G roup assistance appears t o h o l d the mos t promise. Each year a f o rm a l CAS progress 
rev iew and p rog ramm ing mee t ing w i l l be h e l d w i t h GoPNG , w i t h a v i ew t o s o l i d i f y i n g the 
com ing year’s lend ing and AAA . 

v i i i . 
The lending p rog ram fo r FY08 includes three I D A credits: 
the Second M in ing 
Development TA, the Smallholder Ag r icu l tu re Development Project, and a Ru ra l Electrification 
Project. Thereafter, depending o n coun t ry conditions, Government preferences, eme rg ing 
opportunities, and available resources, possible areas o f I D A support m a y inc lude p rov inc ia l 
reconstruction and development, 
r u r a l telecommunications, oversight and accoun tab i l i ty 
institutions, d is t r ic t service de l ive ry and l o c a l governance, r u r a l development and l ive l ihoods , 
r o a d maintenance and rehab i l i ta t ion , you th integration, and p rog ramma t ic support t o the hea l th 
and education sectors. In addition, reg iona l and g loba l resources m a y be ca l led upon t o p rov ide 
assistance o n c l ima te change m i t i g a t i o n and adaptation, and avo ided deforestation. In add i t ion t o 
supporting microfinance, the IFC w i l l consider inves t ing in gas f i e l d development, mining, 
telecommunications, agribusiness, f inanc ia l markets, and renewable energy.

The Bank Group’s non-lending program w i l l consist of advisory assistance in support of 
MTDS objectives, as we l l as analytical wo rk to examine development challenges and underpin 
the design of lending activities. T h e C A S w i l l support con t inued and strengthened dialogue o n

current p rog ram o f successful commun i ty outreach ac t iv i t ies w i l l also be continued.

x . 
The eflectiveness of the proposed program and attainment of CAS objectives is subject to 
a number of risks. P o l i t i c a l c o n f l i c t c o u l d lead t o a deterioration in the governance environment, 
and a steep d rop in c omm o d i t y prices w o u l d l i k e l y t r igge r a r a p i d decline in economic 
performance. Econom ic and social disruptions c o u l d also arise as a resu l t o f g r ow i n g 
unemployment, especially among youth, o r in the event o f a na tu ra l disaster. The r i s k s t o 
p rog ram imp lemen ta t ion inc lude a l a c k o f owne rsh ip o f re fo rm , weaknesses in pub l ic f iduc ia ry 
systems, 
ine f fec t ive dono r coordination, and an i n s u f f i c i e n t l y large-scale o r long - te rm 
engagement o n the part o f the Bank G roup t o achieve t rac t ion on d i f f i c u l t development issues. 
The C A S i s designed t o m i t iga te these r i s k s t o the extent possible, tak ing a long - te rm approach 
t o governance and j o b creation w h i l e w o r k i n g t o imp rove l ive l ihoods and service delivery, and

Papua New Guinea enjoys substantial natural wealth and has recently experienced an

Na t iona l po l i t ica l institutions and processes are beginning to stabilize after decades of 
vo la t i l i ty and uncertainty. Leg is la t ion passed in 2001 restricts post-election changes in pa r ty 
allegiance, w h i c h has he lped strengthen p o l i t i c a l con t inu i ty . In 2007, parliamentary elections 
were conducted successfully under the new l i m i t e d p re fe ren t ia l v o t i n g system, in w h i c h 
candidates need t o attract a greater percentage o f votes t o be elected. The Government o f P r im e 
M i n i s t e r M i c h a e l Somare was the first since independence in 1975 t o serve a full f ive -yea r te rm 
and was re-elected in 2007. I t i s , however, ea r ly t o t e l l whether this stability w i l l resu l t in greater

7. 
Concepts of national identity, legitimacy, and authority are rooted in the country’s 
distinct social and cu l tu ra l fabric, w i t h profound implications fo r politics, governance, and the 
distribution of economic benefits across the country. PNG i s home t o a h i g h l y diverse

iden t i ty , PNG has experienced n o such ga lvan iz ing event, and mos t people today see themselves 
p r im a r i l y as members o f local, clan-based groups rather than as citizens o f Papua N e w Guinea. 
This perspective i s re f lec ted in a style o f na t iona l po l i t ics in w h i c h p o l i t i c a l leaders tend t o focus 
on securing benefits f o r the i r l o c a l allegiance groups, rega rd ing na t iona l considerations as 
secondary in importance. This c lea r ly complicates the pursuit o f a clear na t iona l v is ion and o f 
po l ic ies and practices supporting the same. 

8. 
In te rna l stability has improved w i th peace in Bougainville, but law and order is a serious 
national issue. F o l l o w i n g a nine-year secessionist con f l ic t , the B o u g a i n v i l l e Peace Agreement

External relations are relatively stable. Papua N e w Guinea’s re la t ionsh ip w i t h Aus t ra l ia

H i g h international prices fo r key export commodities have created s ign i jkan t surpluses

I n 2007, the Government is expected to maintain an overall f isca l su rp lus for the th i rd

13. 
As in many other resource-rich nations, PNG remains highly dependent on the extractive 
industries. PNG i s endowed w i t h substantial deposits of m ine ra ls (ma in ly g o l d and copper), oil, 
and gas. M ine ra ls and pe t ro leum alone account f o r over 20 percent o f GDP and nearly 80 
percent o f exports, and this t rend i s l i k e l y t o continue in the near t o m e d i um t e r n . Once 
considered a sector in decline, the mining industry in PNG has experienced a resurgence in 
exp lo ra t ion and investment in response t o rising m ine ra l prices, imp rovemen ts in the ava i lab i l i ty 
o f geo log ica l data, and tax adjustments enhancing PNG’s competitiveness. N e w m i n e r a l 
exp lo ra t ion and investment w i l l be c r i t i c a l in the years ahead since the coun t ry w i l l l i k e l y face 
the closure o f the O k T e d i m ine , i t s biggest mining operation, as early as 2013. T h e expo r t o f o i l 
has also con t r ibu ted s ign i f ican t ly t o PNG’s economy, though i t i s expected that current o i l f ie lds 
w i l l be la rge ly depleted b y 2015. Recoverable natural gas resources are estimated t o be 
substantial, and are l i k e l y t o be an impo r tan t source o f economic g r ow t h and comme rc ia l 
development in the years ahead. (See A t tachmen t A f o r a rev iew o f the ex t rac t ive industries in

15. 

Yet PNG’s natural resources - and their role in economic g row th - remain vulnerable to 
institutional and management weaknesses, unsustainable practices, and na tu ra l disasters. T h e 
p o l i c y and lega l f ramewo rk f o r na tu ra l resource management i s unc lea r and incomplete. 
Management agencies are under-resourced, and the data needed f o r e f fec t ive planning and

16. 
Pub l ic f inanc ia l management in PNG is based on a sound legislative and procedural 
framework, but weaknesses in implementation undermine accountability and budget c red ib i l i ty . 
A 2005 P u b l i c Expend i tu re and F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty assessment f o u n d that PNG has 
established adequate systems and processes f o r p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, but that they are 
n o t always f o l l ow e d and that breaches o f procedure are n o t e f fec t ive ly penalized. A l a c k o f 
transparency in budget execu t ion makes i t d i f f i c u l t to track expenditures. Considerable d ive rs ion 
o f budgeted resources and reliance o n non-transparent extra-budgetary t r u s t funds o f ten translate 
i n t o insu f f ic ien t resources and s ta f f f o r impo r tan t services. Conversely, the Government’s a b i l i t y

recurrent budgets together w i t h compression o f recurrent spending, resu l t ing in insu f f ic ien t 
recurrent funds t o de l ive r services and development budget programs. T h e alignment o f the 
budget w i t h b road M T D S p r io r i t ies has im p r o v e d in recent years, but there i s a con t inued need t o 
develop specific, costed p r io r i t ies so as t o strengthen links between na t iona l and sector strategies, 
available resources, and budget p lann ing . 

17. 
Procurement processes have improved considerably on paper, but improvements in 
practice w i l l depend on strong leadership, capacity bu i ld ing , and the consistent use of 
standardized documentation and procedures. 
I n 2006, a C o u n t r y Procurement Assessment

but that waivers o f compe t i t ive processes rema in widespread. This l a c k o f transparency 
contributes t o perceptions o f co r rup t ion in procurement. U s e of the appropriate manuals i s 
constrained by insu f f ic ien t dissemination and training, w h i l e standard bidding documents 
consistent w i t h the amended leg is la t ion need t o be developed, and clear tender evaluation 
processes introduced. 

18. 
Flaws 
in 
the decentralization framework 
fu r the r 
impede service delivery and 
accountability. The system o f f isca l transfers t o the provinces has never wo rked we l l , and grants 
mandated under the 1995 Organic L a w o n P rov inc ia l and L o c a l - L e v e l Governments have n o t 
been fu l ly imp lemen ted as intended. Though loca l - leve l governments are f o rm a l l y responsible 
f o r c r i t i c a l services (such as the construction and maintenance o f schools, health posts, and 
housing f o r teachers and hea l th workers), they have l i t t l e rea l con t ro l ove r the i r budgets and thus 
l i t t l e accoun tab i l i ty f o r de l ive r ing services. P lann ing and budge t ing practices are n o t w e l l

and w h o have e f fec t ive con t ro l over s ign i f ican t loca l - leve l funds using D i s t r i c t Support Grants. 
H i g h l y unequal access t o resources re la t ive to needs across p rov inces exacerbates this situation.2 

19. 
Con t ro l l ing co r rup t ion should be a much higher p r i o r i t y in PNG. Co r rup t ion i s w i d e l y

A. Country Priorities and Agenda 

35. 

Papua New Guinea’s Medium Term Development Strategy for 2005 to 2010 lays out a 
vision of 
the country’s development goals and the Government’s approach to achieving them. 
The u l t ima te a i m o f the MTDS i s t o foster sustainable imp rovemen ts in the qua l i ty o f l i f e o f a l l 
Papua N e w Guineans b y p romo t ing economic g r ow t h and social development. D r aw i n g f r o m 
the Government’s P rog ram f o r Recove ry and Development, announced in 2002, the M T D S 
promotes three strategic p r io r i t ies : good governance, i n c l u d i n g p u b l i c sector r e f o rm and 
enhanced p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty ; export-driven economic growth, focus ing o n sectors in w h i c h PNG 
has a comparative advantage, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, supported b y 
mining, petroleum, and gas; and ru ra l development, poverty reduction, and empowerment 
through human resource development. T h e strategic approach i s unde rp inned b y the M e d i u m 
T e r m Resource F ramewo rk and the Strategic P lan f o r Suppo r t ing P u b l i c Sector Re fo rm ,

Strategy w h i c h i s cu r ren t ly under preparation. 

36. 
The Government’s development strategy prioritizes p ro -poo r spending. 
In hopes o f 
ach iev ing m a x i m u m development impac t f r o m available resources, the strategy defines seven 
p ro -poo r expenditure p r io r i t ies : (i) rehab i l i ta t ion and maintenance o f transport infrastructure; (ii)

i n f o rm a l adu l t education; (v) p r ima ry hea l th care; (vi) H IV /A IDS prevention; and ( v i i ) l a w and 
justice. G o PNG has made progress in reo r ien t ing b road p u b l i c expenditure categories towa rd

Development partners have endorsed the MTDS and are defining their assistance

UNDP i s suppo r t ing G o PNG in i t s e f fo r ts t o re f ine these targets. 
The 
Gove rnmen t has adopted an M T D S performance f ramewo rk , but there i s a need t o c l a r i f y and

B. Medium-Term Econom ic Outlook 

39. 
PNG’s macroeconomic outlook is expected to remain positive if the current direction of 
f isca l and monetary policy is maintained (Table 3 ) . Rea l GDP g r ow t h rates ove r the C A S pe r iod 
are p ro jec ted b y the staffs o f the Bank and In te rna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) t o be around 4

surplus w o u l d na r row considerably f o l l ow i n g an anticipated decline in prices o f k e y expo r t 
commod i t ies and an increase in demand (both f o r the impo r ts needed t o construct new mines, 
and f o r domestic consump t ion and investment). Fo re ign exchange reserve accumulation w o u l d 
continue, although mo re s l ow l y than in recent years. F isca l surpluses are also forecast t o decline 
as m ine ra l revenues f a l l and spending, especially o n investment projects, increases. The non - 
m ine ra l f isca l de f ic i t shou ld rema in b road ly stable, however, w i t h e f fo r ts t o sustain non -m ine ra l 
tax revenue collections. The cen t ra l bank i s expected t o con ta in the in f la t iona ry pressures 
emanating f r o m reco rd -h igh na tu ra l resource revenues and expanding domestic credit, w i t h 
i n f l a t i o n l i k e l y t o rema in in the l ow e r t o m i d d l e single digits.

I n addition to sustained formal sector growth, significant reductions in poverty and 
unemployment w i l l require the expansion of opportunities fo r income generation and improved

PNG is considered to be at low to moderate risk of debt distress, and sustained vigilance

C. Papua N ew Guinea’s Development Challenges and Opportunities 

43. 

As described above, PNG faces a number of formidable challenges on the road to 
enhanced g row th and poverty reduction, but there are also considerable opportunities fo r 
progress. In responding dec is ive ly t o these challenges and establishing partnerships w i t h k e y 
stakeholders, PNG’s dec is ion makers have the oppo r tun i ty t o harness considerable resources in 
pursuit o f im p r o v e d economic and social development in the years t o come.

Diversifying economic growth to broaden the potential for livelihood improvements. 
There i s a need t o use the w i n d ow a f fo rded by today’s high m i n e r a l prices t o d ive rs i fy PNG’s

the domestic market, h igh -va lue expo r t crops, p lan ta t ion fo res t ry and downstream agro-industry, 
small-scale manu fac tu r ing , tourism, and the service industry. Prospects are also good f o r 
artisanal and small-scale ac t iv i t ies in fishing, mining, and village-based forestry. Harnessing the 
po ten t ia l fo r economic g r ow t h in the non -m ine ra l sector requires increased investment e f f ic iency 
and urgent efforts t o im p r o v e the investment env i ronmen t and p romo te entrepreneurship. 

The to ta l (external and domestic) pub l ic sector debt ra t io i s pro jec ted to dec l ine f r om 39 percent o f GDP in 2006

There is considerable room to improve donor coordination in PNG, but steps are being 
taken to enhance dialogue and a l ign donor programs w i t h national goals. Deve lopmen t partners 

w o r k under d i f fe ren t ins t i tu t iona l arrangements, and as in m a n y other countries there have been 
inconsistent messages and p rog ramm ing overlaps. T o address this concern, G o PNG ins t i tu ted an 
annual j o i n t Gove rnmen t -Dono r Consu l ta t ion F o r um in 2005 and has established a series o f 
Thema t ic W o r k i n g Groups. A Techn ica l W o r k i n g G roup o n Aid Effectiveness has been created, 
and G o PNG and a l l i t s development partners have issued a j o i n t statement c omm i t t i n g t o loca l ize

V. B A N K GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. Lessons o f Experience 

Lessons from Previous World Bank Involvement 

54. 
I n 2000, a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE ) rated the outcome of 
the Wo r ld Bank 
Group’s assistance p rog ram to PNG in the 1990s as “unsatisfactory, w i t h modest institutional 
development impact and uncertain sustainability.” O n the pos i t ive side, the C A E recognized the 
coun t ry team’s focus o n p o l i c y issues, high qua l i ty economic and sector wo rk , and pos i t ive 
e f fo r ts in engaging NGOs. Pa r t ly in response t o the CAE ’s recommendations, the B a n k scaled 
back i t s lend ing program, m a k i n g no new loans t o PNG between June 2002 and April 2007. T h e 
coun t ry team focused on in tens i fy ing commun ica t ion w i t h Gove rnmen t and c i v i l society on the 
basis o f an expanded p rog ram o f ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (AAA) and outreach 
programs. The Bank l i a i s o n o f f i c e in Po r t Mo resby was upgraded t o a full Coun t ry O f f ice , and 
in January 2006 I F C established a fu l l - t ime in -coun t ry presence th rough i t s P r iva te Enterprise 
Partnership f o r the Pac i f ic (PEP-Pacific). D ia logue w i t h Government, donors, and c i v i l society 
continues t o broaden and deepen as a resu l t o f these measures. 

55 . 

The 1999-2002 CAS focused on governance and ru ra l development. The B a n k f lagsh ip 
under this C A S was a Governance P romo t ion Ad jus tmen t Loan , supported by investments in 
health, education, sma l lho lde r o i l p a lm development, rehab i l i ta t ion o f the Gazelle Peninsula, 
solar power, and techn ica l assistance in mining and petroleum. G o o d progress was made in the 
smaller investments, but t w o structural adjustment loans and the Fo res t ry and Conservation 
P ro jec t (FCP) did n o t achieve the i r in tended outcomes. P rob lems encountered inc luded 
Government capacity 
l im i ta t ions and bureaucratic delays, corruption, 
ine f fec t ive dono r 
coordination, d i f f icu l t ies rece iv ing counterpart funds, and inadequate Government engagement 
w i t h p r iva te sector and c i v i l society. Perceptions o f the Bank ’s r o l e in PNG turned dec ided ly 
negative in some quarters. A d d e d t o this, controversy attached i t s e l f t o the FCP. In August 
2003, the Bank suspended disbursements due t o noncomp l iance w i t h lega l covenants and w i t h 
the country’s o w n leg is la t ion rega rd ing the awa rd o f forest concessions. The loan, w h i c h 
comprised a US$ 17.36 m i l l i o n IBRD loan and t w o GEF grants o f SDR 13.31 m i l l i o n each, was 
even tua l ly cancelled at the Government’s request in June 2005, w i t h o n l y U S $ 2.6 m i l l i o n o f 
US$40 m i l l i o n disbursed.

56. 
I n the face of growing po l i t ica l and economic uncertainty and a deterioration in its

This e f f o r t was set aside in v i ew o f the Government’s concern that the JCS was a means f o r 
donors t o exert coordinated pressure o n the Government, and b y Australia’s in t roduc t ion o f the

decline in social ind ica to rs and building the foundations f o r recove ry and im p r o v e d governance. 

57. 
The approach taken under the ISN has shown promise, but there is a need to fu r the r 
refine dialogue, strengthen communication, and improve outcomes at both the national and local 
levels. Sustained dialogue w i t h G o PNG and other development partners has b rough t p roduc t ive

Feedback from Stakeholder Consultations 

I n preparing the CAS, the Bank team received valuable advice f rom consultations w i t h a 

61. 
broad cross-section of stakeholders. During 2001-2003, be fo re m o v i n g t o an I S N approach, the 
PNG coun t ry team conducted extensive C A S consultations at na t iona l and sub-national levels, 
w i t h b o t h government and non-government stakeholders. These consultations (pa r t icu la r ly those 
ca r r ied ou t in r u r a l areas) po in ted t o a consistent set o f p r io r i t ies : (i) reduc ing co r rup t ion and

62. 

I n refining the CAS, the Bank consulted widely w i th Government, c i v i l society, the private

consultations, c i v i l society representatives encouraged the Bank and other development partners

Key Features of the CAS for 2008-2011 

63 . 

The CAS seeks to foster a constructive, long-term partnership w i t h the government, 
people, and development partners of Papua New Guinea to fu r the r the goals se t out in the MTDS 
and MDGs. PNG’s development strategy embodies a tension between a longe r - te rm capacity 
and ins t i tu t ion -bu i ld ing agenda, and a need t o de l ive r man i fes t ly im p r o v e d services in the near 
term. The CAS , accordingly, i s structured t o address short-term service de f ic i ts w i thou t i g n o r i n g 
the l o n g e r - t e r n ins t i tu t iona l and p o l i c y challenge. As no ted above, the fou r -yea r C A S shou ld be 
seen as the f i rs t in a series that w i l l cover the nex t 15 t o 20 years, a l l ow i n g the B a n k G roup space 
t o tackle immed ia te concerns w h i l e w o r k i n g at a mo re appropriate pace o n issues that w i l l 
requ i re a generation o r longe r t o bear rea l fruit. I t i s also a results-based CAS , establishing 
targets and ind ica to rs by w h i c h rea l is t ic progress ove r the C A S p e r i o d can be measured. 

64. W i th poverty reduction as its overarching objective, the CAS consists of 
two p i l la rs : 
(I) Promoting and maintaining sound economic and natural resource management, and 
(11) Improving livelihoods and service delivery, especially for the ru ra l poo r . The tw o pillars 
respond t o the dua l is t ic nature o f the PNG economy, and t o the m a i n M T D S goa l o f fos te r ing 
sustainable qua l i ty o f l i f e imp rovemen ts by p r om o t i n g economic g r ow t h and social development. 
Ac t iv i t ies under Pillar I w i l l focus on three k e y areas: strengthening governance, pa r t icu la r ly 
pub l ic f inanc ia l management and core oversight functions; maintaining sound management of 
the extractive industries th rough im p r o v e d exploration, revenue management, and env i ronmen ta l 
and social sustainability; and promoting effective and sustainable management of natural 
resources, b o t h as a s ign i f ican t basis f o r ru ra l l ive l ihoods and as g loba l p u b l i c goods. A c t i v i t i e s 
under Pillar I1 w i l l address f i v e m a i n topics: supporting development of the private sector as the 
engine of g row th , focus ing o n the business environment, n iche industries, and pub l ic -p r iva te 
partnerships; enhancing ru ra l livelihoods, pa r t icu la r ly in the o i l p a lm and artisanal and sma l l - 
scale mining sectors; improving local service delivery th rough commun i ty -d r iven development 
approaches and other innova t ive service de l ive ry models that strengthen l o c a l governance; 
expanding access 
to 
infrastructure services, pa r t icu la r ly r u r a l roads, electricity, and 
telecommunications; and supporting multi-donor approaches to human development, focus ing 
o n expanded access t o basic education, im p r o v e d health system performance, and e f fec t ive 
responses t o H I V I A I D S .

Activities under each p i l l a r w i l l be selected and p r io r i t ized according to their role in 
alleviating poverty, together w i t h the Bank Group’s comparative advantage among development 
partners. As cross-cutting issues, improving governance and empowering women and youth w i l l 
be mainstreamed across b o t h pillars. 
(See Attachment G f o r a rev iew o f governance and 
an t ico r rup t ion approaches under the CAS.) 

66. 

To better a l ign the CAS w i th PNG’s key institutional arrangements, the CAS is designed 
to be delivered at both the national and local level. The B a n k w i l l a im t o support the efforts o f 
na t iona l - leve l ins t i tu t ions t o fac i l i ta te economic g row th and pove r ty reduction, w h i l e at a sub-

The CAS represents a j o i n t Bank-IFC strategy, recognizing the substantial scope fo r 
synergy between pub l ic and private sector development activities. The B a n k and I F C w i l l w o r k 
t o integrate the i r coun t ry programs, f r o m upstream analytical w o r k t o complementary investment 
and advisory ac t iv i t ies in areas such as na tu ra l resource management, r u r a l development and 
agriculture (especially agro-industries), infrastructure, and the ove ra l l business environment. As 
an example o f this, I F C plans t o support the expansion o f microfinance, w h i l e the B a n k w i l l 
address infrastructure constraints t o sma l l business g row th (such as poo r roads and l o w access t o 
electricity). The B a n k and I F C w i l l also l o o k f o r opportunities to co-finance w o r k in areas l i k e 
a i rpo r t and av ia t ion development, r u r a l telecommunications, fisheries development, gas field 
exp lo i ta t ion , and forestry. 

Wo r ld Bank Group Instruments and Selectivity

Today’s small but efective po r t fo l io provides a good basis fo r a fresh start in PNG. The 
current p o r t f o l i o i s l im i t e d to three projects: the Second Gazelle Restoration Project; the RMRP, 
w i t h supplemental financing; and the GEF-supported TSLP . A l l three projects are pe r fo rm ing 
satisfactorily. 

Bank Group Ass is tance Strategy

69. 
Selectivity is c r i t ica l to maximizing impact w i th in a limited resource envelope. The 
estimated IDA a l loca t ion f o r F Y 0 8 i s about US $ 45 m i l l i o n ( inc lud ing about U S $ 18 m i l l i o n in 
unused ca r ryove r f r o m F Y 0 6 and FY 0 7 ) . F o r F Y 0 9 - F Y 1 1, the ind ica t ive IDA a l loca t ion i s mo re 
modest, at about U S $ 3 0 - 3 2 m i l l i o n pe r year, though actual amounts w i l l be determined annually 
o n the basis o f PNG’s performance re la t ive t o other I D A borrowers. 
I t i s expected that B a n k 
f inanc ing w i l l be p rov ided o n IDA terms. As a b l e n d country, PNG c o u l d also poss ib ly tap i n t o 
IBRD resources, though this w o u l d requ i re ca re fu l sc ru t iny o n a case-by-case basis and w o u l d be 
subject t o a creditworthiness eva lua t ion by IBRD. Coun t ry p rog ram funds w i l l also inc lude the 
comb ined resources o f IFC ’ s PEP -Pac i f ic and the Fo re ign Inves tmen t A d v i s o r y Service (FIAS). 
G i v e n the resource l im i ta t ions , the CAS aims t o res t r ic t new IDA operations t o a m a x im um o f 
three in a typ ica l year. S im i la r ly , “core” AAA tasks w o u l d be l i m i t e d t o t w o pe r year in an e f fo r t 
t o ensure adequate ana ly t ica l and p o l i c y depth. 

Box 1: Principles o f Engagement in PNG 

The C A S sets ou t f ive gu id ing pr inc ip les f o r fu ture engagement in PNG. 
1. Long-term Partnership: Partnering w i t h Government and key stakeholder groups, recogn iz ing that 
comprehensive development w i l l take time, and managing expectations o n a l l sides 
2 . Government Leadership: P rov id ing (and encouraging other donors to prov ide) development assistance in 
l i n e w i t h the Government’s o w n p r io r i t ies and strategies, and engaging in mo re consistent p o l i c y dialogue 
w i t h the G oPNG 
3. Country Ownership: Fos ter ing rea l ownersh ip o f r e f o rm and development programs b y strengthening 
ex is t ing G oPNG structures and processes; encouraging sustainable, affordable, and e f fec t ive government 
decisions; and he lp ing to strengthen imp lemen ta t ion capacity, avo id ing expensive dup l ica t ion o f structures 
and p ro l i fe ra t ion o f external consultants 
4. Results Focus: Seeking t o de f ine intended results no t on ly over the C A S period, but also over the longer 
term, to support strengthened data co l lec t ion and analysis, and to develop and imp lemen t comprehensive 
mon i to r ing and evaluation mechanisms 
5. Openness and Transparency: M a k i n g a concerted e f fo r t to communicate w i t h and reach ou t to broader 
society, inc lud ing the pr iva te sector, NGOs, and CBOs such as Women’s Associations, you th organizations, 
and church-based service de l ivery groups; and to support the GoPNG’s o w n e f for ts in this area 

70 . 

The CAS aims to focus the Bank Group’s comparatively modest country p rog ram 
resources as we l l as draw on regional and global funds to PNG. Coun t ry - leve l interventions 
w i l l focus o n areas where the B a n k has established a good t rack reco rd in PNG (mining, 
telecommunications, transport, and r u r a l energy); where the B a n k can d raw o n i t s g loba l reach t o 
complement other donors’ ac t iv i t ies (in sectors such as education, health, u t i l i t y reform, and 
env i ronmen ta l management); o r where the I F C can leverage p r iva te sector inves tmen t ( f inanc ia l 
markets, extractive 
industries, agribusiness, manufacturing, and 
telecommunications). 
Operations w i l l be complemented b y AAA that draws o n experience f r o m a round the wo r ld , and 
by e f fo r ts t o he lp strengthen PNG’s data bases (e.g. o n the effectiveness o f p u b l i c expenditures 
and o n poverty). T h e C A S w i l l also continue t o support the current c rop o f successful 
commun i ty outreach programs (footnote 22). In add i t ion t o coun t ry p rog ram resources, the B a n k

To amplify the impact of

Successful implementation of the proposed CAS w i l l require a new Bank G roup approach 
to doing business i n PNG. T h e B a n k w i l l g ive a stronger dec is ion -mak ing r o l e and greater

o f ex t rac t ive indus t ry revenues, the ins t i tu t iona l strengthening o f k e y oversight agencies, and 
commun i ty -d r iven development approaches that emphasize good governance. In order t o build 
coa l i t ions f o r im p r o v e d governance, the C A S w i l l also support dialogue among k e y stakeholders, 
i n c l u d i n g na t iona l and sub-national government, 
the p r iva te sector, c i v i l society, and 
development partners. 

90. 
A fall i n commodity prices may trigger a rap id decline in economic performance. T h e

91. 
G row ing unemployment, especially among urban youth, may lead to increased violence 
and c r im ina l activity, and to deteriorating social stability. The C A S w i l l support the a r t icu la t ion

responsible and sustainable na tu ra l resource management practices. 

Implementation Risks 
93 . 

Lack of ownership of pub l ic expenditure and governance refonn and lack of support f o r 
national oversight agencies may stall the progress of CAS implementation. The C A S attempts t o 
m i t iga te this risk by suppo r t ing e f fo r ts t o build broad-based constituencies f o r change, reach ing

ins t i tu t ions t o ca r ry ou t the i r func t ions e f fec t ive ly and t o communicate w i t h citizens about the i r 
wo rk . 

94. 
The Bank’s engagement w i l l either be too short-lived o r too small-scale to affect 
governance over the long term. The C A S o n l y intends t o take a first step in dea l ing w i t h 
comp lex soc io -po l i t ica l issues o f this kind. Ove r time, and w i t h persistence and consistent 
engagement, the B a n k expects t o be able t o assist s ign i f ican t ly in spite o f i t s l im i t e d f inanc ia l

95. Weaknesses in pub l ic f iduc ia ry systems may impede project implementation. Th rough the

Th e Development Fo rum . PNG has established i s o w n un ique and h i g h l y e f fec t ive 
process f o r E1 p ro jec t approval. At the t im e a license app l ica t ion i s made f o r m ine ra l

are c i rcu la ted t o a l l interested government departments and i n v o l v e d parties (in pa r t icu la r 
landowne r groups). These documents are then considered at a Deve lopmen t F o r um where the 
p ro jec t developer presents the proposed p ro jec t t o a l l interested parties and departments and,

between the inves to r and the landowners rega rd ing compensation, and a multiparty agreement

Inc luded in these agreements are social and 
env i ronmen ta l p ro tec t ion plans. 

11. 
Environmental Impacts. E1 p ro jec ts have s ign i f ican t env i ronmen ta l impacts. These 
tend t o be mo re severe f o r mining than o i l and gas because mining causes greater g round 
d is rup t ion and requires m o r e waste r o c k disposal than o i l and gas. T h e mos t s ign i f ican t mining 
impac ts in PNG i n v o l v e the disposal o f waste and ta i l ings at Ok T e d i and Porgera i n t o the loca l 
r i v e r system and at Lihir i n t o the ocean. F o r o i l and gas, the env i ronmen ta l issues re la te mos t ly 
t o po ten t ia l o i l spills-at 
transshipment po in ts o r due t o p ipe l ine ruptures. There are serious 
env i ronmen ta l legacy issues at b o t h the Panguna and Ok T e d i mines, where tailings disposal in 
the l o c a l r i v e r systems w i l l l i k e l y i n v o l v e s ign i f ican t impacts over a l o n g p e r i o d o f t ime . 

12. 
Social Impacts. E1 projects have substantial social impacts, but these have been better 
managed in PNG than in many other countries because due t o customary l a n d owne rsh ip and 
usage rights, landowners have b o t h de fac to and de j u r e con t ro l over wha t happens o n the i r land. 
Thus, w i t h the exception o f the armed uprising o n Bouga inv i l le , PNG has avo ided the mo re 
severe human rights incidents that have occu r red in some other countries. Howeve r , l o c a l 
commun i t ies suffer f r o m a numbe r o f nega t ive social impacts i n c l u d i n g the c rea t ion o f “haves” 
and “have riots"-the latter t y p i c a l l y inc lude the poorest members o f the popu la t ion (especially

A l l o f the E1 operations in PNG are m a j o r i t y owned and

m a j o r i t y owner and operator i s the Chinese state-owned China Mining and Me ta l lu rg ica l

a l l E1 projects at cost o n a con t r ibu t ing basis, and the state has taken a m i n o r i t y shareholding in

14. 
Mac roeconom ic M a n a g em e n t o f E1 Revenues . Countries w i t h la rge E1 sectors re la t ive 
t o the rest o f the economy face three main mac ro economic challenges. T h e f i rs t challenge i s t o 
use the E1 revenues t o develop the non -E1 sector in pa ra l le l w i t h the E1 sector and t o the extent 
possible d ive rs i fy the economy in order t o a v o i d over dependence o n E1 and the r i s k s o f “Du tch 
disease.” Ove r the past twen ty years, PNG has n o t been successful in g r ow i n g the non -E1 sectors 
o f the economy re la t ive t o EI. T h e second challenge i s t o manage po ten t ia l ly la rge swings in EI- 
related government receipts re la t ing t o the v o l a t i l i t y o f c omm o d i t y prices. Twen ty years ago, 
PNG h a d a M i n e r a l Resources S tab i l iza t ion Fund (MRSF), w h i c h was ins t rumen ta l in pa r t ia l ly 
cush ion ing the na t iona l l e v e l economic impacts o f the closure o f the Panguna m ine . Howeve r , 
the MRSF was discontinued. T h e third challenge i s t o successfully use the income f r o m E1 t o 
support im p r o v e d development outcomes inc lud ing , in pa r t icu la r , hea l th and education. But, 
over the past twen ty years, hea l th and education outcomes have tended t o deteriorate n o t 
imp rove . At the present t im e PNG i s experiencing a s ign i f ican t upsw ing in government receipts 
f r o m the w o r l d c omm o d i t y boom . T h e Government’s p o l i c y at present i s t o use the surpluses t o 
pay d ow n i t s in te rna t iona l debt, w h i c h i s bas ica l ly a sound po l icy , p r o v i d i n g that adequate funds 
are available f o r the Government’s recurrent budget needs. Howeve r , the challenge of 
deve lop ing the non -E1 sector remains s ign i f ican t . The sound use of E l income to diversify the 

economy and improve development outcomes, wh i le at the same time managing volatile income 
streams, is a key focus of 
the Bank’s macroeconomic and development dialogue w i t h the 
GoPNG, including the Country Economic Memorandum, the Pub l ic Finance Review, and the 
Pub l ic Expenditure Tracking Survey.

M i t iga t ing Environmental R i s k s . 
A l l o f the E1 operations in PNG operate in 
compliance w i t h government regulations and contract terms and conditions, w h i c h are generally 
based o n good in te rna t iona l practice w i t h the exception o f the con t rove rs ia l methods related t o 
waste disposal (i.e. disposal o f m i n e overburden and concentrator ta i l ings ) used at the larger 
m i n e sites. The use o f r ive r ine waste disposal methods at Ok T e d i and Porgera i s generally 
considered unacceptable practice today. In the past the substantial harm down r ive r from the O k 
T e d i m i n e was n o t w e l l addressed o r compensated, but this been recogn ized and better addressed 
in the past ten years and considerable imp rovemen t has been made t o reduce the d ow n r i v e r 
impacts th rough dredging. T h e present arrangements at b o t h Ok T e d i and Porgera are generally 
w e l l accepted b y b o t h the affected landowners and the Government, and p re fe r red t o the 
alternative o f c los ing d o w n the operations, w h i c h w o u l d have severe adverse impacts f o r the 
l o c a l communities, the province, and the na t iona l economy. Ocean disposal o f ta i l ings and 
waste, w h i c h i s used at Lihir, i s also controversial, though po ten t ia l ly less harmful than r ive r ine 
disposal p r o v i d i n g disposal i s undertaken at depth and consistent w i t h best practice. At Lihir, the 
alternative w o u l d be t o have waste disposal sites o n land, but the is land i s so sma l l that deep 
ocean disposal i s p re fe r red by b o t h landowners and the Government. Deep-sea waste disposal 
was used at M i s i m a a long w i t h regu la r m o n i t o r i n g b y D EC , and the impac ts were considered 
acceptable. 

16. M i t iga t ing Hea l th and Safety Risks. With rega rd t o hea l th and safety, there have been 
n o serious o i l s p i l l s t o date and the government and the operators have ensured that good practice 
p ipe l ine design and safety procedures are in place t o a v o i d any rup tu re due t o technical factors 
and t o m i n im i z e the impacts shou ld the p ipe l ine be damaged b y a sever earthquake o r seismic 
event. O i l and gas pipelines and other p lan t and fac i l i t ies are at r i s k o f exp los ion but the 
Government requires and the companies adhere t o s t r ic t safety standards in l i n e w i t h good 
in te rna t iona l practice and there have been n o ma jo r safety inc iden ts o r fatalities. M i n e health 
and safety standards are also generally in l i n e w i t h good in te rna t iona l p rac t ice although there was 
a m a j o r exp los ion in the explosives preparation p lan t w i t h loss o f l i f e at Porgera in 1994. 
Though m i n e health and safety 
inspections were p rev ious ly 
inadequate, support

17. 
M i t iga t ing Social Risks and Imp rov ing Social Impacts. 
T h e strong vo ice o f the 
landowners hav ing de j u r e control over development in the i r areas, comb ined w i t h the 
Deve lopmen t F o r um process, has he lped l o c a l commun i t ies t o receive substantial benefits f r o m 
the E1 sector. In addition, E1 companies have made s ign i f ican t e f fo r ts t o increase l o c a l sourcing 
o f goods and services in order t o reduce the enclave nature o f the E1 sector as compared t o 
twen ty years ago. This has been achieved partly th rough the agreements that are signed w i t h 
l o c a l people, and p a r t l y th rough the recogn i t ion b y E1 companies that pos i t ive relationships w i t h 
l o c a l commun i t ies and outsourcing business t o l o c a l companies i s n o t just good f o r development 
but i s also good fo r business. While communities can ga in benefits f r o m EI, i t i s o n l y in the past 
decade that the disparities in social benefits and r i s k s between d i f fe ren t groups have started t o be 
w e l l recogn ized and addressed in PNG. W o r k o n gender issues under the Mining TA p ro jec t has

18. Mitigating Social Risks: Closure o f E1 Operations. Closure o f E1 operations can result 
in loss o f income and emp loymen t and s ign i f ican t con t rac t ion o f the l o c a l economy. This 
happened at the M i s i m a m i n e when i t closed, and the Government i s concerned t o see the 
impac ts managed as w e l l as possible at b o t h the O k T e d i and Porgera mines, b o t h o f w h i c h m a y 
close w i t h i n the nex t decade due t o exhaustion o f presently k n ow n reserves. The Government 
intends t o put in place good practice m i n e closure and oil/gas decomm iss ion ing po l ic ies 
supported b y sound p lann ing and s o l i d imp lemen ta t ion procedures. Some in i t ia l wo rk on mine 
closure was conducted under the f i r s t M i n i n g TA, and additional wo rk to support improved 
planning and implementation of mine closure activities w i l l be supported under the second 
M i n i n g T A operation, including assistance to MRA and D oMPGM fo r a M is ima M ine Closure 
Review and to D oMPGM for preparing a M ine Closure Policy to better manage mine closure 
impacts. 

19. 
Sustainable Local Community Development. I f E1 are t o make a greater con t r ibu t ion 
t o development in PNG, then sustainable ins t i tu t ions w i l l need t o be established in mining and 
pe t ro leum affected communities. The government i s presently considering h ow E1 development 
can be better integrated w i t h commun i ty -d r iven development (CDD), and p i l o t w o r k w i l l be 
supported b y the Mining TA 2 p ro jec t . T h e c omm u n i t y related activities o f the MWAs represent 
a p rac t ica l s t a r t and, as part o f i t s support f o r imp lemen t ing the Women in Mining Program, the 
T A operation w i l l provide support to the MRA Coordination Department to support development 
of j o i n t programs by the MWAs and local/district level government agencies.

and to build the know ledge and capabilities o f the A S M m ine rs so tha t they can operate in a

environmental, and social issues associated w i t h small-scale mining. The new M in ing T A w i l l 
take this effort fu r the r by p rov id ing support to MRA ’s ASM Department to expand the 
ava i lab i l i ty of 
information and to expand the reach and scope of 
technical assistance services, 
t ra in ing and development activities on a p i l o t basis to other small-scale mining areas in Papua 
New Guinea, through support for the newly formed Small Scale Miners Association. 

C. E1 Governance Issues 

21. E1 Revenue Transparency. T h e larger E1 operations are a l l operated in a f u l l y 
comme rc ia l manner by mu l t i -na t iona l mining o r o i l companies, and the smaller operations b y 
we l l -qua l i f ied , competent l o c a l companies. A l l produce and publish f inanc ia l accounts, and 
there i s good transparency rega rd ing payment b y companies t o a l l leve ls o f government- 
although there i s l i t t l e dissemination o r p u b l i c discussion o f such payments and n o p u b l i c l y 
available reconc i l ia t ion o f wha t the companies say they p a y w i t h w h a t Government says i t 
receives. There i s also good transparency rega rd ing transfers o f E1 and other funds by the 
na t iona l government t o p r o v i n c i a l governments, w h i c h inc lude n o t o n l y general budgetary funds 
but also m ine ra l roya l t ies and special support grants t o m ine ra l p roduc ing provinces. There i s 
l i t t l e o r n o ind ica t ion o f co r rup t ion in the m ine ra ls sector at the na t iona l leve l . Howeve r , there i s 
ve ry poo r transparency rega rd ing the receipt and use o f funds at the p rov inc ia l and loca l 
government leve ls due t o l a c k o f pub l ished budgets, lack o f pub l ished accounts, and lack of 
audits o f sub-national government funds. Improving the transparency of collection and use of E I 
funds to support g rea te r f inanc ia l accountability of E l revenue f lows at national, p rov inc ia l , and 
d is t r ic t levels w i l l be addressed through the Bank’s macroeconomic and development dialogue, 
including AAA wo rk on pub l ic expenditure management which w i l l also support 
the 
Government’s possible pa r t ic ipa t ion in E IT I . 

22. E1 Licensing. One o f the mos t impo r tan t E1 governance 
issues i s l icens ing 
arrangements. As ind ica ted p rev ious ly , PNG has a sound system f o r l icens ing E1 projects, but 
the ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f the government in general and b o t h D o M and D o P E in pa r t icu la r has 
eroded ove r the past ten years, and recurrent budgets f o r D o M and D o P E have been inadequate 
t o support e f fec t ive oversight o f E1 operations. The establishment o f the M R A i s he lp ing 
imp rove m ine ra l licensing. First, because the MRA i s se l f - fund ing f r o m mining sector fees, i t 
shou ld be able t o attract su f f ic ien t s ta f f w h o have good qua l i f ica t ions and experience (this was a 
p rob lem f o r DoM , w h i c h los t some o f i t s best s ta f f t o mo re attractive emp loymen t elsewhere but 
was h e l d back f r o m f i l l ing vacancies b y the Department o f Personnel Management) and 
su f f ic ien t recurrent funding t o undertake necessary m i n e site visits and inspections (wh ich D o M 
lacked). Second, the MRA ’s governance structure has a clear separation between B o a r d 
membership and management, and B o a r d members are appointed b y d i f fe ren t constituencies 
(wh ich prevents the B o a r d f r o m be ing p o l i t i c a l l y influenced). A mining adm in is t ra t ion w i l l also 
need to be established fo r Bouga inv i l le . Efforts to strengthen the institutional structure of EZ 
sector bodies and the i r capacity t o license and administer the sector ( inc lud ing in Bougainville) 
w i l l be supported under the new M i n i n g TA 2 operation.

Attachment A 

23. E1 Fiscal Regime and T a x Assessment and Collection. A l l o f PNG’s m i n i n g and 
oil/gas projects are subject to a common fiscal regime that i s in l i n e w i t h good international 
practice, w i t h the exception o f the recently approved Ramu N i c k e l project where a ten year tax 
holiday was granted b y the Government. Tax holidays fo r E1 projects are considered h igh ly 
undesirable because they create the risk o f distorted production decisions whereby an operator 
w i l l maximize production p r io r to the expiration o f the tax holiday, resulting in sub-optimal 
development o f the ore body and sacrifice o f lower-grade resources. The M i n i n g TA 2 operation 
w i l l assist DoMPGM in encouraging Government negotiating teams to avoid o f fe r ing special 
treatment through tax holidays. The PNG fiscal regime i s implemented through we l l designed 
tax regulations wh ich are generally w e l l enforced b y the JRC, w i t h the important exception that 
the JRC lacks sufficient staff and s k i l l s to conduct field audits o f E1 companies. As a result, 
there are missed opportunities fo r revenue collection f r om existing mining and petroleum 
operations. Some p i l o t wo rk carried out under the M i n i n g TA project resulted in significant 
additional assessments, and i t i s expected that E1 tax revenues wou ld increase substantially i f the 
IRC were able to conduct f i e l d audits o f a l l companies lodg ing income tax returns. Additional 
substantial support to bu i ld the IRC capabilities to undertake f i e l d audits w i l l be provided under 
the M i n i n g TA 2. 

24. 
D is t r ibu t ion o f E1 Royalties and Compensation to Landowners. There are significant 
concerns about the distribution and use o f landowner royalties, w i t h a reported tendency fo r men 
to keep the bulk o f the income and compensation fo r themselves and spend i t on their own 
priorities. The situation i s most severe regarding landowner compensation fo r o i l and gas, which 
i s pa id to landowners not at the s i tes near their homes but in Port Moresby, and stories abound o f 
landowners returning w i th most of the funds already dissipated on good l i v i n g in the capital’s 
hotels. The Government has not made this a p r io r i ty , but under the M in ing T A 2, support w i l l be 
provided to the Policy D iv is ion of D oMPGM to improve the accountability systems fo r transfer 
of mining compensation and benefits to landowners. 

25. 

Rights o f People Affected by E1 Projects. As noted previously, there are no known 
ma jo r human rights abuses or violations associated w i t h E1 projects in PNG. Some NGOs have 
raised concerns that loca l people’s views are no t sufficiently taken in to account b y E1 operators, 
but this concern has no t been raised b y landowners per se. T o the extent that there are rights 
issues , they largely relate to the impact o f E1 on women. This i s being addressed through m in ing 
and EI-gender related wo rk as outlined in Paragraph 14 above.

This attachment summarizes the debt sustainability analysis @SA ) 
f o r Papua N e w 
Guinea prepared using the f ramewo rk f o r low - income countries. The baseline macroeconomic 
scenario unde r ly ing this DSA was prepared b y the In te rna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund in September 
2007 f o r the 2007 A r t i c l e I V Consu l ta t ion m iss ion and envisions a sustained imp lemen ta t ion of 
the government’s med ium - te rm f isca l strategy. T h e DSA also assesses the impac t o f various 
exogenous shocks o n the sustainability o f pub l ic sector debt and external debt unde r the baseline 
scenario.

Real GDP i s p ro jec ted t o g row at about 4 percent in 2007-12 as several mining projects 
come o n stream, ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty improves, and con t inued gradual progress i s

F isca l p o l i c y remains in l i n e w i t h the government’s med ium - te rm f isca l strategy; ove ra l l 
budget surpluses are expected t o decline and turn i n t o de f ic i ts by 2010 due t o f a l l i n g 
m ine ra l prices and inc reas ing government spending, but the non -m ine ra l f isca l balance i s 
expected t o be stable. 
Papua N e w Gu inea w o u l d have access t o external concessional f inance and continue t o 
f o l l ow a prudent debt strategy. 
Structural re fo rms ou t l ined unde r the authorities’ M e d i um -T e rm Deve lopmen t Strategy, 
i n c l u d i n g those o n p u b l i c sector re fo rm , are imp lemen ted at a gradual pace. 

B. To ta l Public Sector Deb t Sustainability 

The public sector debt ra t io declined f rom the high o f 76-77 percent o f GDP in 2001- 

2. 
02 to 39.2 percent o f GDP a t end-2006 (Table C-1). This imp rovemen t re f lec ts prudent f isca l 
po l icy , favorable m i n e r a l sector developments (in particular, strong prices o f k e y expo r t 
commod i t ies in recent years), k i n a appreciation, l ow e r interest rates, and a sustained economic 
recove ry since the current government took o f f i c e in mid-2002. Ex te rna l p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y - 
guaranteed debt accounts f o r just ove r h a l f o f to ta l pub l ic debt. M u l t i l a t e r a l debt, p r im a r i l y t o 
As ian Deve lopmen t Bank , Papua N e w Guinea’s largest creditor, and the W o r l d Bank, accounts 
f o r two - th i rds o f ex te rna l p u b l i c and pub l ic ly -gua ran teed debt. Japan i s the m a i n b i la te ra l 
creditor, accounting f o r mo re than 80 percent o f b i la te ra l debt. Unde r the authorities’ M e d i um - 
T e rm D e b t Strategy, foreign-currenc y loans are considered o n l y i f they are highly concessionary 
(grant element of 35 percent or more). 

27 The f o l l ow i n g analysis draws on the I M F ’ s D S A analysis prepared f o r the M i s s i o n B r i e f f o r 2007 A r t i c l e I V

3. 

Unde r the baseline scenario, the public sector debt-to-GDP ra t io i s projected to 
decline to 29.5 percent by 2012 and 14.6 percent by 2027. The p ro jec ted imp rovemen t o f the 

ra t io stems m a i n l y f r o m the expectation o f a prudent f isca l p o l i c y con t inu ing i n t o the m e d i um 
term, as w e l l as f r o m favorable automatic debt dynamics. T h e NPV o f p u b l i c debt w o u l d decline 
f r o m around 40 percent of GDP in 2006 t o 3 0 percent b y 2012 and to l e s s than 16 percent b y 
2027. The NPV o f p u b l i c sector debt-to-revenue ratio, w h i c h has fa l len s ign i f ican t ly ove r the 
past 4 years due t o high w i n d f a l l revenue, i s expected t o r ise somewhat b y 2010 -11 as m ine ra l 
revenue moderates. Howeve r , in the longer t e rm the ra t io i s expected t o s ign i f ican t ly decline. 
The debt service-to-revenue r a t i o w o u l d s im i la r ly r ise s l i g h t l y ( f r om 10.3 t o 14.9 percent 
between 2006 and 2010) be fo re dec l in ing . 

The standard analysis indicates that the paths o f the debt ratios a re particularly 

4. 
sensitive to changes in rea l GDP growth (Tab le C -2 and F igu re C-1). A decline in rea l GDP 
g r ow t h in 2008-09 by one standard dev ia t ion b e l ow i t s h is to r ica l average w o u l d raise the NPV o f 
pub l ic deb t - to -GDP ratio by mo re than 20 percentage po in ts o f GDP in the l o n g term. A one- 
t ime 3 0 percent deva lua t ion in 2008 w o u l d also increase the debt bu rden in the m e d i um te rm (by 
6 percentage po in ts o f GDP w i t h i n a year), but the ra t io w o u l d decline ove r the longe r term. 

C. Ex te rna l Deb t Sustainability 

5 . 

Papua New Guinea’s external public and publicly-guaranteed debt has declined in 
recent years, f r om the h igh o f 52.4 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 21.4 percent in 2006 (Table 

C-3). During the same period, to ta l external debt dec l ined f r o m 76.8 percent o f GDP t o 34.0 
percent. As a percentage o f exports o f goods and services, to ta l external debt dec l ined f r o m 
127.5 percent in 2002 t o 41.7 percent in 2006. Based o n available data, p r iva te external debt 
accounted f o r 37 percent o f to ta l external debt at end-2006 and stood at 13 percent o f GDP. 

6. 

Ex te rna l public and publicly-guaranteed debt dynamics a re sustainable under the 
baseline scenario, and Papua New Guinea faces a low to moderate risk o f debt distress 
under the IMF-WB D S A f ramewo rk for L I C S . ~ ~ A l l the k e y debt ind ica to rs (the NPV o f 

pub l ic and pub l ic ly -gua ran teed external debt in percent o f GDP, the NPV o f debt in percent o f

and fo r debt service: (i) 15 percent o f exports o f goods and services and (ii) 25 percent o f f isca l revenue.

distress risk i s moderated b y the fac t that the coun t ry has an excellent external repayment record, 
hav ing never defaulted in the past. 

D. Conclusions 

8. 
Papua New Guinea has made significant progress in reducing its public debt 
burden, but i t w i l l need to continue its prudent management o f debt over the medium-to- 
long term in order to mitigate risks to public debt sustainability. Cu r ren t ly , mos t ind ica to rs 
show that the p u b l i c and external debts are manageable, and Papua N e w Gu inea faces a l o w t o 
moderate risk o f debt distress. The ou t look , however, i s sensitive t o changes in rea l GDP g r ow t h 
and expo r t performance, highlighting the vu lne rab i l i ty o f the debt dynamics t o po ten t ia l shocks 
f r om l ow e r w o r l d ma rke t prices o f the country’s k e y expo r t commodities. This requires the 
p o l i c y a imed at accumu la t ing su f f ic ien t precautionary fo re ign exchange reserves a n d o r p a y i n g 
d ow n ex te rna l debt during the periods o f high c omm o d i t y prices, and a con t inua t ion o f 
conservative b o r r ow i n g p o l i c y . T o fu r the r he lp gua rd against vulnerabilities, Papua N e w Gu inea 
shou ld ensure that any external b o r r ow i n g i s obtained o n concessional terms, as env is ioned in i t s 
M e d i um -T e rm D e b t Strategy.

I t was 
unclear i n i t i a l l y h ow the ECP’s hands-on approach w o u l d alter the a i d pa rad igm in PNG. The

objectives: expo r t -d r iven growth, r u r a l development, and pove r ty reduc t ion and empowerment. 
There were questions, however, as t o the degree o f coun t ry owne rsh ip o f this document, as w e l l

During this time, the Bank’s re la t ionsh ip w i t h the G o PNG was becom ing inc reas ing ly

Box F-1: Voices fo r Change - Giving Women a Say in Mining Community Development 
“You can’t eat the stones when the m ine i s gone,” said Scho l la Wa ra i Kakas at a Papua N e w Guinea’s 
Women in M i n i n g Conference, h e l d Ju ly 11-14, 2005. Ms. Wa ra i was one o f 140 women f r om m i n i n g areas 
across the coun try who gathered in Madang to voice their concerns about the impac t o f m i n i n g ac t iv i t ies o n their 
l ives and communities. 
The Women in M i n i n g in i t ia t ive grew out o f a recogn i t ion that women and ch i ld ren tend t o bear the 
heaviest social costs o f m i n i n g development and closure, but because they o f ten rema in outside forma l dec is ion 
mak ing structures, they have had l im i t e d opportunities to speak ou t about their concerns. 
In 2003, the f i r s t W om e n in M i n i n g conference, en t i t led “Voices fo r Change,” p rov ided an oppor tun i ty fo r 
women w i t h diverse backgrounds and experiences t o meet o n common ground and ta lk about h ow m i n i n g 
ac t iv i t ies have affected them. They discussed the negative impacts, inc lud ing the disproportionate employment 
and social representation o f men, increased work load fo r women, destruction o f homes and gardens, p o l l u t i o n o f 
water sources, alcoholism, violence, and the spread o f H I V I A I D S . They also iden t i f ied a variety o f pos i t ive 
effects o f m i n i n g activities, such as the p rov is ion o f housing, m icro-cred i t programs, imp roved health services, 
school scholarships, adu l t l i teracy and vocational t ra in ing programs, H I V / A I D S education, and counseling fo r 
v ic t ims o f violence. Together, conference participants developed a v is ion statement focus ing o n f i v e themes 
they considered p r io r i t ies f o r attention, especially f r om the Government: health and education, economic 
empowerment, social empowerment, safety and security, and sustainable artisanal and small-scale m in ing . This 
w o r k was fo l lowed up du r ing the 2005 conference, wh ich resulted in the design o f a five-year ac t ion p l a n t o 
support economic and social development in m i n i n g communities. 
By g i v i n g women a stronger voice in expressing their needs and concerns, the Women in M i n i n g in i t ia t ive 
has empowered women t o take ac t ion in deve lop ing their commun i t ies and p lann ing fo r the future. There i s a 
strong sense that women w i l l be the dr ivers o f sustainable development in PNG, based o n research show ing that 
women are more l i k e l y than men to use f inanc ia l resources fo r the education and health o f their ch i ldren . The 
greater invo lvemen t o f women in commun i ty development also promises to strengthen the demand fo r good 
governance, b o t h at the loca l leve l and nationwide. As such, this impor tan t in i t ia t ive serves as a mode l fo r

Fo l low ing country relationship challenges and recalibration o f the country program under 
the I S N , there was no new Bank lending to PNG between June 2002 and Ma rch 2007. Tw o 
projects (M in ing TA and Petroleum TA) closed and one (FCP) was cancelled. As a result, the 
number o f projects under implementation f e l l f r om six in 2005 to three in 2007 and the volume 
o f commitments dropped f r om U S $ 116.7 m i l l i o n to U S $ 72.3 m i l l i o n . At the time, the po r t fo l io 
was plagued b y d i f f icu l t ies w i t h overdue audits, lack o f counterpart funding, and problems w i t h 
special accounts. 

25. 
Po r t fo l io performance imp roved significantly during the I S N pe r iod and after. 
As 
Government revenues improved, counterpart funding, wh ich had slowed down the disbursements 
f r om the Bank’s loanskredits in the past, was n o longer an issue . T w o out o f the f ive projects 
(Gazelle Restoration and Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation) in the po r t fo l io were previously 
rated as being at risk o f no t achieving their development objectives. They have since turned 
around, and their status has been upgraded to indicate that they are expected to achieve their 
development goals. However, due to their historical performance, the tw o operations have long- 
t e rm risk flags against them. The tw o projects that closed during the pe r iod (M in ing TA and 
Petroleum TA) were rated satisfactory at the time o f closing. 

26. 
The current po r t fo l io i s small, but effective. 
There are no fiduciary, safeguard, 
mon i to r ing and evaluation, counterpart funding, or legal covenant issues facing any o f the active 
projects in the po r t fo l io . O n l y the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP) had 
and s t i l l has a slow disbursement flag, However, in spite o f the improvements, the po r t fo l io s t i l l 
has country record f lag over wh ich ind iv idua l projects have no control. One project, the TSLP, 
has been approved s ince the I S N came i n t o place. Add i t iona l funding f o r the RMRP was also 
approved. Another addition to the po r t fo l io was a regional GEF project fo r Sustainable Energy 
Financing, a U S $ 9.5 m i l l i o n fac i l i ty covering Fiji, PNG, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, and 
Vanuatu. The SADP i s expected to go the Boa rd in early FY08 . With the warming up of 
country relations, the po r t fo l io i s expected to grow gradually. 

What Worked Less Well 

27. While most aspects o f the I S N exceeded expectations, there were a few areas where 
planned programs were not f u l l y implemented. Plans to conduct an updated poverty analysis 
on the basis o f a new household survey and Demographic and Health Survey were not achieved 
due to a number o f factors. 
I t was i n i t i a l l y envisaged that a new national household survey 
wou ld b e carried out in support o f the wo rk on the Poverty Assessment. However, despite a l o t 
o f preparatory work, an agreement cou ld no t be reached w i t h the Department o f National 
Planning or w i t h other donor partners, especially the ADB, on carrying out such a survey. In 
addition, the Bank f e l t there was a need fo r additional wo rk on tracking pub l ic expenditures and 
service delivery. The PESD was planned as part o f a special focus fo r the poverty assessment. 
However, as the PESD generated a wealth o f information, i t became a stand-alone report, wh ich 
was completed at the same time as the poverty assessment in 2004. The most recent household 
survey on which estimates o f poverty in PNG can be directly based, the 1996 National 
Household Survey, i s now more than a decade o l d and in urgent need o f being updated through a 
new nationwide survey. This issue w i l l be taken up in the context o f the new CAS.

Programs designed o n the basis o f high qua l i ty economic and sector w o r k and small,

tend t o succeed in situations where t rad i t iona l

reaching governance re fo rms that are sustainable; this i s especially t rue at the sub- 
na t iona l l e v e l where capac i ty i s thin. 
Deve lopmen t o f a constructive long - te rm partnership w i t h the Gove rnmen t and other 
development partners in pursuit o f development objectives i s essential in a coun t ry l i k e

1. 
The Wo r ld Bank Group has recently adopted a strategy f o r addressing governance and 
anticorruption as an integral p a r t of its wo rk on reducing poverty and promoting growth.31 The 
strategy aims to help developing country governments iden t i fy their own priorities fo r imp rov ing 
governance, and implement effective and sustainable programs. Recognizing the importance o f 
country ownership and leadership, the Bank Group’s engagement w i l l vary b y country. The 
strategy aims to strengthen, not bypass, country systems, and to wo rk closely w i t h development 
partners. The Bank Group intends to engage w i t h a broad range o f government, business, and 
c i v i l society stakeholders. 

2. 

I n line w i t h the Bank G roup ’s overall governance and anticorruption strategy, the Papua 
New Guinea CAS includes a number of measures to support GoPNG’s efforts to strengthen 
governance as a means to reducing poverty, enhancing growth, and improving service delivery. 
At the national level, the CAS w i l l support imp roved governance and public expenditure 
management to promote accountability and transparency in the use o f public resources, 
especially through the use of country systems fo r procurement and financial management. Loca l 
leve l operations w i l l focus on supporting decentralized systems o f planning and budgeting-the 
poor functioning o f wh ich i s a major constraint to effective service delivery. 

Ongoing Support fo r Governance and Anticorruption Efforts in PNG 

Assisting GoPNG to improve its procurement system. An action program has been 
agreed under the recently completed Country Procurement Assessment Report, focusing 
on bu i ld ing the capacity o f tender boards and developing standard bidding documents. 
Supporting better pub l ic f inanc ia l management through the implementation o f the Public 
Expenditure Review and Rationalization (PERR) recommendations. 
Strengthening the capacity of 
the In te rna l Revenue Commission ( IRC ) to improve the 
quality of 
tax audits. The Mining TA I supported two p i l o t tax audits o f m in ing 
companies, and support fo r the IRC w i l l continue under the M i n i n g TA 11. 
Helping ensure sound governance in the extractive industries. The Bank has provided 
support to the establishment o f sound m in ing and oil/gas licensing and fiscal regimes 
under the recently closed M i n i n g TA I and Gas TA. 

Proposed Governance and Anticorruption Actions under the CAS 

Pillar I: Promoting; and Ma in ta in inp Sound Economic and Natural Resource Management 
Support fo r improved macroeconomic stabilization and f isca l discipline through multi- 
donor dialogue on the PERR, combined w i t h technical assistance, po l icy notes, and 
reports that respond to client needs and address knowledge gaps. A Public Finance 
Review and Country Economic Memorandum are envisioned.
