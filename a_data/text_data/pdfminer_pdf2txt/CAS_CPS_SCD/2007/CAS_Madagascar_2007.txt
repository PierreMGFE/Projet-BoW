i. 
Since the current government took charge in 2002, it has embarked on an ambitious 
transformation path that has brought improvements in social, economic and governance 
indicators. The economy grew at an average of 5 percent per year and poverty has declined to 
69 percent from its peak 80 percent in 2002. These positive developments and the smooth 
presidential elections in December 2006 offer hopeful signs that Madagascar has stepped 
firmly onto a path to sustained development, breaking with the history of economic 
mismanagement and periodic crises that impoverished the people. Madagascar's recent 
performance shows how rapidly the right policies and additional resources can propel a 
previously lagging nation ahead. 

. . 

11. 

But Madagascar still has a long way to go. The macroeconomic situation remains 
fragile. Governance continues to be weak. And social indicators are still low and far from the 
Millennium Development Goals. Magnifying these challenges is population growth, now 2.7 
percent a year, placing enormous demands on the government and the economy-first 
to 
educate people, then to generate income opportunities for them. Furthermore, Madagascar 
faces the challenge of preserving its unique environment and biodiversity which are of global 
significance. 

... 

111. 

To address these challenges, the Government of Madagascar has put in place a bold 
development strategy for 2007-2012-the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), a second- 
generation Poverty Reduction Strategy. The MAP envisages accelerated and well coordinated 
reforms to achieve faster growth and poverty reduction. The immediate breakthrough areas of 
the MAP are: (i) reforming public finances; (ii) significantly increasing investment to promote 
high growth; (iii) sowing the seeds of a green revolution; (iv) transforming public security; (v) 
implementing bold new measures for health and family planning; and (vi) transforming the 
judiciary. But Madagascar has limited resources to address its enormous challenges and needs. 
A stepped-up effort by the international community will be required to make its 
transformation a success. 

iv. 
The World Bank Group already has a solid base in Madagascar, with a well 
performing portfolio, and a critical mass of knowledge and experience. The Country 
Assistance Strategy, designed to help achieve the MAP objectives, builds on this base and on 
lessons learned and is organized around two main pillars: 

The f i r s tp i l la r concentrates on activities that will help remove key bottlenecks to 
investment and growth in rural and urban areas. 

The secondp i l la r brings together activities geared toward improving access to, and 
quality of, services. 

v. 
A critical crosscutting element is improving governance and reducing corruption. The 
CAS will build on the ongoing efforts in support of the government's far-reaching program to 
improve governance. It will seek to consolidate progress on improving the legal and 
regulatory framework and will focus on critical implementation aspects of the governance 
agenda in: (i) resource mobilization (tax and customs); (ii) public expenditure management; 

(iii) management of natural and mineral resources; and (iv) decentralization. In addition, the 
CAS will continue supporting the efforts on capacity building. 

vi. 
The International Development Association's (IDA) indicative annual allocation 
during the CAS period is about SDR99 million. These resources will be complemented by 
debt relief of over US$30 million a year provided by IDA through the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative (MDRI). The Bank Group and the government will need to be creative to ensure that 
these limited resources produce a sizeable impact. To increase the CAS's impact in a 
resource-constrained environment, the Bank Group will act as a catalyst to attract scaled-up 
external support for Madagascar and to improve efficiency in the use of domestic and donor 
resources. 

vii. 
In line with the government's request and consistent with the Paris Declaration on 
Harmonization, Bank Group assistance to Madagascar is aligned with that of other donors to 
provide a package of coordinated support around the government's MAP. CAS preparation 
was closely coordinated with other partners to facilitate maximum harmonization with other 
donors, such as the European Commission, French Development Agency, the African 
Development Bank, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. 

... 

vlii. 

This CAS carries significant risks. The main external risk is Madagascar's 
vulnerability to economic and natural shocks. The main internal risks are its fragile 
macroeconomic environment, possible political instability, especially if the government fails 
to create enough jobs for its youthful and rapidly growing population, and capacity 
constraints. The main reputational risk to the Bank Group is that donor assistance may not be 
sufficient to help Madagascar overcome its formidable development challenges. Unless the 
international community is prepared to increase its support to Madagascar, this risk will 
persist, even if implementation of the current CAS program proceeds as planned. 

ix. 
The CAS includes elements that help to mitigate these risks. Furthermore, if political 
instability were to seriously impair the capacity of the government to manage the economy, or 
if the quality of governance deteriorates, or if significant implementation constraints emerge, 
IDA will adjust its program in line with the new circumstances. 

x. 

The following questions are proposed for discussion by the Executive Directors: 

Does the proposed strategy adequately contribute to achievement of priority objectives 
of the government's Madagascar Action Plan? 

Is IDA'S role as a catalyst to attract additional resources plausible? 

Are the risks properly identified and mitigated? 

MADAGASCAR: 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR FY2007-11 

Introduction 

1. 
Madagascar has done remarkably well since it emerged from a political and economic 
crisis in 2002. The post-crisis government of President Ravalomanana has embarked on 
courageous reforms to address corruption, improve governance, and create an environment 
conducive to private investment and growth. As a result, the economy has grown at about 5 
percent a year since 2002, and social and welfare indicators have improved. 

2. 
Stepped-up efforts by the government, the Malagasy people, and the international 
community are needed to build on this momentum, to consolidate progress, and to move forward, 
as spelled out in the government's new reform program, the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP). 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) lays out how the Bank's program intends to support the 
implementation of the MAP. 

I. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK 

Background 

3. 
In the 1960s Madagascar was among the better-off African countries; it had an educated 
elite, strong institutions, good infrastructure, and an income per capita above the developing 
country average. But it lost this position after several decades of economic mismanagement. 
From the 1970s until the second half of the 1990s annual growth of Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) averaged only 0.5 percent compared with population growth of about 2.8 percent. Per 
capita income declined from US$473 in 1970 to US$290 in 2005, placing Madagascar among the 
world's poorest countries. 

4. 

Yet, Madagascar's economic potential is enormous: 

It is the environmental treasure of the world, with unique flora and fauna. Nearly 40 
percent of the birds and 91 percent of the reptiles are endemic, and Madagascar is home 
to 25 percent of all African plants. Its unique nature and beautifid beaches make it an 
attractive tourist destination. 

Its abundant and diversified natural resource base offers strong potential in agriculture, 
fisheries, and mining. 

It is located near prosperous markets such as Mauritius, Rkunion, and South Africa, is a 
member of both Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and 
Southern African Development Community (SADC), and it enjoys preferential access to 
the European and U.S. markets. 

Although Madagascar has had difficulty capitalizing on its potential, its prospects of doing so 
have improved. The recent progress has shown how rapidly the right policies and additional 
resources can propel a previously lagging country ahead. 

A. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Improved social indicators and access to services 

5. 
Since 2002 Madagascar has improved dramatically its basic social indicators, albeit from 
a low base. More children are in school today than ever before, with net primary enrolment rates 
above 90 percent, up from 70 percent in 2002.' The country increased its literacy rate to 70 
percent in 2005, above the 61 percent average for Sub-Saharan Africa. But only 57 percent of 
children complete primary school, 15 percent complete lower secondary school, and only 5 
percent complete upper secondary school. As more children complete primary education, the 
country will need to respond to the growing demand for secondary education, which is already 
pressuring existing capacity. Moreover, major inequalities exist by region and income groups, 
and the quality of instruction is poor at all levels. 

6. 
Child mortality rates declined significantly, from 159 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1997 
to 94 in 2004, and today more women give birth in health centers than ever b e f ~ r e . ~ 
Immunization rates improved from 46 percent in 1997 to 61 percent in 2004. Rural access to safe 
drinking water also improved from 12 percent in 2003 to 16 percent in 2005. Madagascar's 
health indicators are better than other African countries of a similar income level, but they remain 
low, particularly among the rural population and the urban poor. For example, the 2004 maternal 
mortality ratio was below the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 830 deaths per 100,000 live births, 
but it is still very high at 469 (per 100,000 births). The social indicators are discussed further in 
the section on Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (paragraphs 17-24). 

7. 
Since reaching a peak level of 80 
percent at the 2002 crisis, poverty incidence 
has declined to 68.7 percent and is at about 
the 200 1 level.3 Rural poverty declined to 
73.5% in 2005 and is now even lower than it 
was in 200 1 (figure 1). Moreover, the 
intensity of poverty4 in rural areas declined 
from an estimated 53 percent in 2002 to 
34.8 percent in 2005, below the pre-crisis 
level of 39.7 percent. It is also encouraging 
that the rural population's access to reliable 
transport rose from 45 percent in 2003 to 57 
percent in 2005 as a result of the roads 
program. Box 1 describes the poverty 
situation in Madagascar.

' The Malagasy social data are not fully reliable. Different sources give different numbers. However, all sources confirm the 
ositive trends. 
'The rate o f prenatal consultation was 80 percent in 2004, ranging from 78 percent in rural areas to 91 percent in large 
urban centers. 
' The national poverty line has been used. It is defined as the amount of money needed to buy 2133 calories and includes an 
allowance for essential non-food needs. In 2005, the poverty line was 305,300 ariary per person per year. Numbers are based 
on the 2004105 household survey. 
The intensity o f poverty measures the average consumption shortfall of the poor relative to the poverty line. 

Box 1. Poverty in Madagascar 

Poverty in Madagascar is widespread. According to the 2005 household survey more than two-thirds of 
the population (68.7 percent) live below the poverty line. The poverty rate in rural areas is significantly 
higher than in urban areas: while almost three-quarters (73.5 percent) of the rural population is poor, just 
over half (52 percent) of the urban population is poor. Poverty rates also differ by region, with the highest 
rates in the coastal regions of the east and south, where over 80 percent of the population is poor. Poverty 
is lowest around the capital Antananarivo. 
Between 2001 and 2005 poverty declined more rapidly in rural areas than in urban areas, in marked 
contrast to 1997-2001, when the small decline in poverty was largely the result of declining urban 
poverty. Growth in 1997-2001 was driven largely by the export processing zone sector, based in 
AntananarivoIAntsirabe, which improved job opportunities and reduced poverty in urban areas. The 
decline in poverty in rural areas between 2001 and 2005 is linked to greater emphasis on rural 
development, accelerated implementation of the roads program, and higher rice prices, which gave 
incentives to rural farmers. Also, the economic shocks in 2004105 (strong depreciation, high international 
oil and rice prices) may have affected the richer segments of society more adversely. 
I The poor have more limited access to education opportunities. Net primary enrolment rates for the poorest 
quintile (70.8 percent) are lower than for the richest quintile (99.1 percent). The gap is widest for higher 
levels of education-for example, the net secondary enrolment rate is 1.4 percent for the lowest quintile 
compared with 14.1 percent for the richest quintile. 

8. 
Improved policies, economic growth and improvements in the quality o f public sector 
governance have contributed to the above results on the ground. 

Better growth performance 

9 . 
ARer the 2002 crisis GDP growth rebounded to 9.8 percent in 2003 from a 12.7 percent 
plunge a year before and continued to grow at an average rate of about 5 percent per year (figure 
2). Growth came largely through higher tourism receipts (tourism an iva ls in 2005 were 2 1 
percent higher than in 2004), improved performance in agriculture, especially higher rice 
production (rice productivity increased from 2.3 tons per hectare in 2003 to 2.6 in 2005), and 
continued public investments. In 2005 the economy grew a t 4.6 percent despite a sharp increase 
in world petroleum prices. and a financial 
crisis a t the state-owned electric enterprise 
Jirama that disrupted economic activity 
through power cuts and tariff increases.

10. 
Good macroeconomic management 
has contributed to this solid growth 
performance. The government contained 
inflationary pressures and brought year-on- 
year inflation down from a high o f 27 percent 
at end-2004 to 10.8 percent at end-2006. In 
addition, improved foreign exchange policy 
has smoothed the high variability o f the 
exchange rate. Improved macroeconomic 
stability and business climate led to increased 
investment as a share of GDP from 14 percent in 2002 to over 22 percent in 2005 (figure 2).

1 1. 
But Madagascar continues to face fiscal problems. Revenue forecasts have consistently 
proved too optimistic because efforts to increase revenue have been less successfU1 than 

expected. The resulting revenue shortfalls have increased the uncertainty of resource availability 
because midyear expenditure cuts were needed to meet fiscal targets. This uncertainty has 
diminished the government's ability to implement its programs. 

Good progress on governance 

12. 
Progress on governance has also been good even though the agenda ahead is still huge. 
Madagascar's governance ranking has improved according to several sources. The World Bank 
Institute's governance indicators place Madagascar ahead of most low-income countries, 
especially on controlling corruption (figure 3). It is among very few low-income countries to be 
in the 50'-75' 
percentile of Composite Governance Indicator, along with Ghana and Mongolia, 
up from the 48th percentile rank in 2 0 0 3 . ~ Madagascar's good standing is also confinned by its 
2006 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment scores: its overall score is 3.6, with the quality 
of public administration, accountability and transparency in the public sector rated 3.5. 
Moreover, the 2006 Transparency International Conuption Perception Index for Madagascar is 
3.1, ranking it 84th of 163 c ~ u n t r i e s . ~ This is an improvement over the 2005 ranking of 97th out of 
158 countries. 

Figure 3. Worldwide Governance Indicators, 2005 

13. 
These governance improvements are the result of the government's efforts to fight 
conuption and improve transparency since 2002. The country passed anticorruption and anti- 
money laundering legislation, adopted clear rules for public sector recruitment, and requires 
elected and public officials to declare their assets. It also created an independent Anti-Corruption 
Commission and an 
anticorruption agency, 
Bureau Independent 
~ n t i - c o r r u p t i o n 
(BIANCO), which has 
investigated scores of 
allegations of 
corruption by public 
officials and 
spearheaded audits of 
large investment 
vromams such as 
education and 
transport.

Simplified expenditure management procedures have reduced red tape and discretionary 
decision making. A modem integrated financial management system, deployed in main 
treasuries, captures about 80 percent of government expenditures. In addition, a new procurement 
code and procurement oversight authority are important steps in ensuring the integrity of the 
budget system. On the demand side of governance, a public expenditure tracking survey in 
education and health is being used to evaluate the impact of public expenditures. A citizens' 
scorecard exercise has been launched to evaluate the efficiency of primary health care delivery. 
Finally, efforts are under way to strengthen the subnational tiers of government. 

In 1998 Madagascar's Governance percentile was only 30 . 
Madagascar is ranked higher than Tanzania (93), Mali (99), Mozambique (99), Uganda (105), and Nigeria (142) but lower 
than Mauritius (42), South Africa (5 I) , and Ghana (70). 

15. 
However, governance gains remain fragile, and the challenges ahead are formidable, 
especially in natural and mineral resources, where reform efforts are sometimes undermined by 
powerful vested interests. Also, despite recent progress, pockets o f corruption remain in customs, 
licensing and some other areas. Transparency o f government operations remains inadequate, and 
the accountability relationships between service providers or local officials and citizens remains 
weak. Justice reform is significantly behind expectations mainly because o f strong resistance to 
change within the judiciary. Finally, perceptions about potential conflicts o f interest, in particular 
among elected officials, reflect negatively on Madagascar. 

16. 
Recent progress on the social, economic, and governance fronts is encouraging and 
demonstrates that the economy can respond quickly to improved policies. Also, it shows that 
much can be achieved even in an environment of imperfect institutions. This is very pertinent 
because in Madagascar the task o f building stronger institutions is enormous and the road ahead 
is long. The macroeconomic situation remains firagile, overall governance continues to be weak, 
and social indicators are still poor. In fact, Madagascar is far from meeting many MDGs. 

B. CHALLENGES MOVING FORWARD 

Reaching the MDGs 

17. 
Sustaining recent progress will not be enough to meet the MDGs, especially given the 
ground lost during 1990-2002. A recent assessment shows that to come closer to meeting the 
MDGs, economic growth rates must be higher and more resources must be mobilized and used 
more e f f e ~ t i v e l ~ . ~ 

18. 
A complicating factor is population growth, currently a t 2.7 percent a year. If the 
population continues to grow a t this pace, in 2050 Madagascar will have a population of over 40 
million people. The rapid population growth will make the provision of basic services more 
difficult-especially 
in health, education, and food security-and will make it more difficult for 
poor households to escape poverty. Under these circumstances, GDP per capita growth will be 
inadequate unless the economy grows much faster than before or the population growth rate 
decreases significantly (for example, after a rapid decline in fertility). Fortunately, there are 
encouraging signs that fertility may have started to decrease in ~ a d a ~ a s c a r . ~ 

19. 
The prospects of meeting the individual MDG targets vary. With recent progress on 
primary school enrollment, universal enrollment by 2015 is within Madagascar's reach if the 
current level o f effort can be sustained. However, universal primary completion will be more 
difficult to achieve, requiring attention to high repetition and dropout rates. At the same time, the 
male-female gap in primary education has been closed: 56.8 percent o f girls and 56.2 percent o f 
boys completed primary school in 2005. 

20. 
The government has successfully piloted approaches to bringing clean water to the rural 
population. Assuming the current level of effort, Madagascar will fall short o f the target access 

' World Bank, "A M M S Approach to Analyzing the MDGs in Madagascar, 2006" (draft) 
* Current Malagasy demographic da ta are not fully reliable. A comprehensive population and housing census is urgently 
needed, followed by a high quality demographic and health survey. This would shed more light on the country's fertility 
determinants and the demographic transition process. 

rate of 70 percent of the population by 10 percent in 20 15 and at best reach the target by 2 0 2 0 . ~ 
Increased resources, however, could help reach the target by 20 15. 

2 1. 
The MDGs for health will be difficult to reach. Child and maternal mortality will remain 
high in particular-in 
part due to very slow progress in improving water and sanitation coverage. 
In addition, hospital overcrowding and a shortage of health personnel continue to place serious 
constraints on the accessibility and quality of services. At the same time, Madagascar has 
successfully kept the prevalence of HIVIAIDS below one percent thanks to concerted efforts by 
the government. But surveys show that prevalence has increased slightly among high-risk 
groups-a 
situation that requires careful monitoring and vigilance. Fortunately, the country has a 
broad-reaching HIVIAIDS prevention strategy that to date has proven to be effective. 

22. 
Halving poverty is the most difficult MDG to reach. Recent progress has merely helped 
the country to recover the 1990 poverty rate. Given that the poverty rate stands at slightly under 
60 percent today, the 34 percent target is most likely unattainable by 20 15." To reach it, 
Madagascar's economy would have to grow much faster, at over 8 percent a year between 2006 
and 2015, which translates into per capita growth of over 5 percent. 

23. Madagascar is facing up to the challenge of reversing the deterioration of its unique 
environment. The rapidly growing population puts tremendous pressure on the environment, as 
Madagascar's fragile environment can only support a limited number of people in the rural areas, 
especially given current farming practices." The government has committed to tripling the 
surface of protected areas to 6 million hectares (10 percent of total land area) fiom 1.7 million 
hectares in 2005. This creates the need for alternative income generation activities to meet the 
immediate economic needs of the local population. An additional challenge is the high incidence 
of forest fires, illegal extraction of forest products, and weak enforcement of protection rules 
inside and outside the protected areas that appear to be increasing. 

24. Madagascar can get closer to meeting the MDGs if it manages to grow faster, mobilize 
more resources, and use them more effectively.I2 So far, Madagascar has faced a shortage of 
public and private resources to finance development (box 2), but things are beginning to change. 
Investment is on the rise, and the country's record in using external aid is good. The performance 
of the IDA portfolio has improved, and the European Commission ranks the performance of its 
Madagascar program among the best. Most important, Madagascar's progress in improving 
governance is an encouraging assurance that it can put additional resources to good use. The 
challenge for the country will be to create conditions that encourage investment needed to 
generate higher rates of growth. Especially, much more foreign investment will be needed given 
the low level of domestic savings. Also, it will need to continue improving the quality of its 
public expenditure and strengthen the mobilization of domestic revenue. 

The overall access rate to clean water was 46 percent in 2004. 
' O These numbers are based on the US$I /day Purchasing Power Parity poverty line. 
' l Farmers prefer to expand land under cultivation (often through slash-and-bum) rather than invest in increasing 
productivity. Scarcity of capital prevents farmers from investing in mechanization and other inputs; and government 
interference in the fertilizer and seeds markets has constrained their use by farmers. 
l 2 The government can also reduce the funding needs if it can capture the externalities that result from spending on different 
MDGs. For example, improving child and maternal health helps education achievement, while the latter creates a more 
productive labor force. In turn, growth and higher incomes create more funding for services and increase demand. The result 
is a cycle of growth and development that reduces overall funding needs than if each MDG were pursued separately (A 
MAMS Approach to Analyzing the MDGs in Madagascar, 2006). 

Box 2. The resource challenge 

Resources have been inadequate in Madagascar both for the government to provide services and for 
investment to generate growth. Gross fixed capital formation averaged only 11.4 percent of GDP during 
1970-2003 compared with 18.9 percent for all low-income countries. Consequently, real per capita 
capital stock declined by over 40 percent over this period. Very low total factor productivity growth 
further suggests that the investment that was undertaken was not well chosen or was of low quality. 

In addition, the country has one of the lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios (about 10 percent), far below the 
average mobilization rate for sub-Saharan Africa. The government has used tax holidays and exemptions 
to stimulate the economy in the recent past, eroding the tax base. Efforts to collect more resources did not 
prove sustainable, even in the context of recent high growth. Revenues increased to 10.9 percent of GDP 
in 2004 but declined to 10.1 percent in 2005. More recently, the government made progress on reforming 
customs, but improvements in taxation are yet to come. 

Private investment-foreign 
and domestic-has 
also been low. Private investment averaged 8.9 percent 
during 1996-2005 with foreign direct investment averaging only 0.9 percent of GDP during the same 
period. However, the recent reforms are beginning to have an impact. Private investment has increased 
recently to 12 percent in 2004-2005 with investments in mining, tourism, and light manufacturing taking 
the lead. Hopeh l ly the mobilization of domestic resources will follow suit. 

Achieving higher rates of growth 

25. 
If Madagascar is to achieve better development outcomes, it must find ways to achieve 
high rates of growth for an extended period and make sure that it is inclusive of all segments of 
its population. Madagascar's challenges are amplified by the rapidly growing population that 
demands new jobs: 300,000 new entrants join the labor force every year.13 But these challenges 
are not unmanageable. 

26. Madagascar has good potential for agricultural growth as local output is generally 
competitive at the farm gate. Its rich natural environment makes it an attractive destination for 
tourism. Madagascar also has a natural competitive strength in low-wage, low-to-moderate skill, 
and labor-intensive goods such as handicrafts, textiles, and clothing. Overall efficiency is low, 
but current wage rates more than compensate for this, making unit labor costs very competitive 
with other sub-Saharan Africa countries, and even India and china.I4 In textiles and clothing, 
Madagascar continues to benefit from preferential access to the U.S. market under the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and to the European Union market under the Everything 
but Arms program (EAP), both of which have clearly been an essential element of the success of 
the export processing zones.15 Madagascar is also well positioned to gain from SADC 
preferential access to regional markets, especially South Africa. Finally, it has wide possibilities 
to profit from the opportunities offered by the Indian Ocean Community (IOC). 

27. 
The upturn in the late 1990s and the rapid turn around since 2002 (see figure 2 on page 3) 
offer encouraging signs. The economy responded very well to policy changes in macroeconomic 
management, governance, investment climate, and to investments in infrastructure. Private 
investment increased, leading to higher and more diversified production, which was absorbed by 
increased exports and domestic demand. New activities around the export processing zone 

I 3 Out of the 300,000 youth that enter the job market every year, 75 percent are in rural areas. Historically, new rural labor 
was absorbed by the rice cultivation expansion, but this has reached its Limits. Textiles and tourism are absorbing about 
30,000 new entrants per year. This leaves 270,000 entrants per year that will need new jobs. 
14 Integrated Framework 2001, table 4.1, p. 44 
'' The recent extension of the AGOA third party fabric provision to 2013 is good news for the Malagasy textile sector. 

attracted substantial foreign direct investment to textiles and clothing. Shrimp and more recently 
tourism and mining also grew impressively. These activities will continue to generate 
opportunities and employment, but they are not likely to provide enough jobs for the country's 
growing labor force. 

28. 
Achieving high rates of employment and income generating growth will also depend on 
improving performance elsewhere in the economy. In this regard, rural development will require 
an increased focus (box 3). Despite strong potential in agriculture, the sector's contribution to 
GDP is low, only 14.8 percent in 2005, and declining. Between 1997 and 2005 the sector grew a t 
2 percent a year, well below the population growth rate o f about 2.8 percent. However, recent 
performance improvements in agriculture, in part in response to public investments, offer hopeful 
signs but call for a more concerted effort building on the current momentum. 

Box 3. Rural growth 

Output and capital per worker 

Generation of employment and income in the rural areas, where 77.3 percent of the population and 73.5 percent 
of the poor live, remains the biggest development challenge in Madagascar. In the middle of the last century 
Madagascar had a relatively thriving agriculture sector. 
Today, most households live off subsistence activities of 
very low productivity, with rice as the main staple food. This 
decline can be attributed to poor policies resulting in low 
investment and declining capital per worker (see figure). In 
addition, rapid population growth led to an expansion of land 
under cultivation rather than productivity increases.

Areas with high growth and employment potential in rural 
areas include: (i) promoting export-oriented agriculture and 
agro-industries: particularly promising are exports of fruits, 
vegetables, honey, essential oils, shrimp, rice and livestock 
(especially live goats and sheep); (ii) expanding eco-tourism: 
currently tourism is primarily linked to visits to national 
parks but it has also been expanding rapidly along the coastal 
areas of the dry west; (iii) servicing growing towns: rural 
areas can supply food as well as services- carpentry, masonry, mechanics, tailors, repair shops, handicraft 
shops-to urban markets; and (iv) improving distribution of rents derived from natural resource management: 
particularly from forestry and small scale mining.

To profit from these opportunities and bring higher income and employment to rural areas, some important 
barriers will have to be removed, many of which lie outside the rural sector. 

@, free competition in key agriculture products and inputs is essential for increasing the profit margins to 
farmers. Farmers need better information on production techniques and prices, better organization and 
marketing skills, as well as access to competitively priced fertilizers and seeds. Contract farming should be 
encouraged and information dissemination be used aggressively to inform farmers of their options. 

l - 

Second, rural communities need better links to markets by improving national and local roads. Rice yields are 
significantly higher in areas in proximity of roads. In addition, other infrastructure, such as irrigation, is in dire 
need of repair. 
Third, farmers and emerging agro-businesses in rural areas need better access to finance. Economic actors in 
rural areas are starved of financial resources today. 

Fourth, the preservation of natural resources can be combined with the provision of opportunities to rural 
population to unleash the huge potential for eco-tourism and small-scale mining. 
Fifth, policies for the rural sector have to be adapted to fit the local circumstances, as well as to facilitate 
migration to areas of opportunity by fostering clear property rights and providing basic services in these areas. 

29. 
To achieve higher rates of growth inclusive of all sectors of the economy, Madagascar 
needs to consolidate recent achievements and deepen the policy reforms. An initial analysis of 
the constraints to growth in Madagascar points to the need of removing bamers that limit 
(i) access to domestic and international markets (transportation, communication, domestic and 
foreign monopolies); (ii) access to finance and factor markets (credit, electricity, land); and (iii) 
access to effective government (regulations, judiciary). 

Access to domestic and international markets 

30. Madagascar is an open economy, and it enjoys preferential access to the European, U.S. 
and regional markets. It currently exports textiles and agricultural commodities (table I), but 
could potentially export a wider range of products and increase the volume of exports. For 
example, it is puzzling that despite high demand for fruits and vegetables in the nearby markets 
Mauritius and Rkunion, Malagasy farmers have not geared up to respond to this demand. It is 
even more puzzling that they do not even satisfy the local market demand for agricultural and 
dairy products.'6 The answer lies in supply constraints-such 
as inadequate transport 
infrastructure, high transportation and telecommunication costs, trade monopolies, deficiencies in 
accessing market information, and an inability to meet basic quality and phytosanitary standards 
that limit opportunities.

3 1. 
For a country as remote as Madagascar, good transportation and communication links are 
vital to its better integration into the global and regional markets as well as to profiting from the 
existing market opportunities at home. The country has an extensive transport infrastructure (roads, 
ports, and airports), but the quality is highly deficient (box 4). The progressive deterioration of 
infrastructure, such as the loss of about 1000 kilometers of roads per year during 1970-2000 has 
narrowed the scope for profitable investment especially in rural areas, where potential returns are 
very high and growth has been particularly weak. Transport from Antananarivo, where the main 
productive capacity is located, to the port of Toamasina is expensive and time consuming. 
Inefficient management of cargo at ports further increases the cost of maritime transport. For 
example, the cost of handling a transshipment container in Toamasina is more than twice that in 
Port Louis (Mauritius). 

l 6 For example, the increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables in Fort Dauphin (due to a new mining development) 
cannot be met locally due to poor roads, lack of refrigeration services, inadequate quantity and quality of products, and the 
absence of collection and marketing services. As a result these products are brought all the way from the capital. 

Box 4. The state of infrastructure in Madagascar 

Roads. Many parts of the island have no road access during the rainy season. When it became 
independent, Madagascar had 50,000 kilometers of roads, but due to poor maintenance and 
underinvestment the national road network now consists of only 31,612 kilometers, of which 4,074 
kilometers are paved and 5,855 kilometers are in good or fair condition. Even primary arteries, such as 
Antsirabe-Antananarivo and Toamasina-Antananarivo, are inadequate to handle current traffic. 
Ports. Madagascar has 17 ports. Toamasina, the primary port, handles more than 70 percent of total port 
traffic. It is the least efficient port in the Indian Ocean-loading 
and unloading are slow, less than 6.3 
containers per hour. The port is overstaffed by a factor of six, resulting in high costs despite low wages. 
However, there have been some positive developments since the concessioning of the container terminal 
two years ago. 
Airports. Madagascar has 55 airports, 26 with paved runways, but only one, in Antananarivo-Ivato-is 
longer than 3,047 meters. Air service to the rest of the country fiom Ivato is inefficient and uncompetitive 
because Air Madagascar has a monopoly on domestic flights and ground handling throughout the country. 

IT and telecommunications. Both are limited and expensive. Tele-density stands at only 6 percent and 
coverage remains poor, mostly limited to the urban centers. Absence of a reliable and affordable national 
backbone significantly limits coverage of telecommunication networks. A new regulator with increased 
accountability has been put in place, but the transition has been slow, resulting in a regulatory void. 

32. 
Air transport and telecommunication links are expensive. Despite an announced policy of 
open skies, there is no evidence of increased competition on key air routes (both passenger and 
freight). For example, the air freight cost between Antananarivo and Paris is almost twice as 
expensive as the cost between Mauritius and Paris. Similarly, the cost of local calls in 
Madagascar is very high, the second most expensive in Africa after Kenya. International calls are 
also expensive: a three-minute call from Madagascar to the United States costs twice as much as 
a call from Mauritius to the United States and four times as much as a call from South ~ f i i c a . ' ~ 
The telecom company Telma still holds the monopoly in a number of market segments (such as 
backbone and provision of public phones). This creates severe obstacles for other private sector 
investors to come in, making it paramount to ensure the opening of the sector after Telma's post 
privatization exclusivity period ends in June 2008. All this increases Madagascar's isolation from 
the rest of the world. 

33. 
Better logistics to access domestic and external markers are important, but so is free 
competition. Monopolies in key sectors hamper growth. In addition to monopolies in 
transportation and communications discussed above, trade in key agriculture inputs and products 
such as fertilizer, vanilla, cattle, milk, and precious wood is controlled by entrenched networks of 
oligopsonists, often with links to influential politicians and, in the case of cattle trade, to 
organized crime. As a result, profit margins for farmers tend to be low and barriers to entry 
(whether perceived or real) high.'' 

34. 
Finally, poor access to information on prices, technology, standards, and the like h r the r 
limit growth---especially in rural areas. The inability to meet basic quality and phytosanitary 
standards required in advanced markets is a serious impediment to exploiting Madagascar's 
comparative advantage in agricultural exports. The dismantling of public agricultural extension 
services left a critical institutional vacuum that the private sector and nongovernmental 
organizations have yet to fill. Many farmers have simply reverted to subsistence farming with 

17 Development Policy Review, World Bank, 2005 
'' See Minten & Bart: "How to alleviate rural poverty through agriculture growth" (2006). 

occasional local sales or barter. The government has recently tried to disseminate price 
information. But knowledge of market prices, quality standards, and veterinary practices remains 
scarce. It is thus unsurprising that Malagasy exports of processed foods (as well as other product 
categories) tend to have very high import content, and backward links to upstream raw materials 
producers are weak. 

Access to finance and factor markets 

Businesses in Madagascar struggle with access to finance, electricity, land, and skilled 

35. 
labor. 

36. 
Although sound, the financial sector in Madagascar is shallow and undiversified.I9 Credit 
to the private sector stands at only 10 percent of GDP, below the 14.8 percent average for low 
income countries. Only the largest enterprises have access to credit from the formal financial 
sector, while small and medium-size enterprises have to rely on alternative and more expensive 
means of financing. Access to long-term finance is even more restricted, preventing investment 
activities by businesses and especially small and medium-size enterprises. The small insurance 
sector is weak and poorly supervised. 

37. 
The recurrent episodes of 
political and macroeconomic 
instability are reflected in the high risk 
premiums that banks charge for credit. 
Access to credit is further constrained 
by deficiencies in the legal framework, 
in land and pledge registries, and in 
the judicial system. Therefore, it is 
unsurprising that firms cite access to 
finance and cost of finance among the 
most severe constraints to doing 
business in Madagascar (figure 4).

38. 
The national electricity coverage rate is only around 15 percent of households; tariffs are 
high by regional standards; and the service is unreliable. Many enterprises operate their own 
generators. Moreover, expanding the system to accommodate demands from new businesses is a 
major challenge due to the difficult financial situation of the public power and water utility 
Jirama. Notwithstanding the recent near-doubling of electricity tariffs, Jirama continues to rely 
on budget transfers of over US$30 million a year.20 Unless this situation is dealt with, the country 
will likely continue to experience power deficits and power outages that disrupt economic 
activity and increase the cost of doing business, hampering the prospects of future growth, 
especially in manufacturing and tourism. 

39. While land tenure does not appear to be a major constraint to agricultural productivity,2' 
it is a major obstacle to private investors, particularly in tourism-because of the absence of a 

l 9 The banking sector is highly uncompetitive, with seven banks, six of which are foreign affiliated or controlled. Lack of 
new entrants can be explained by a history of macroeconomic and political instability and small market size (see 
Madagascar Financial Sector Assessment Program, 2005). 
20 The tariffs are still below cost recovery and the efficiency of Jirama is low.

transparent and predictable land allocation process. It also constrains the ability of farmers to use 
land as collateral to access credit. 

40. 
Labor is abundant, and education outcomes are a s good or better than those in many sub- 
Saharan Africa countries. However, projections indicate that employers will encounter a 
substantial shortfall of more educated workers, making it difficult to achieve growth of 6-7 
percent a year sought by the government. The Development Policy Review (2005) projects that 
78 percent of new jobs in 2004-08 will demand secondary or higher education and that 25 
percent of that demand will not be satisfied. Some shortages of advanced technical and 
managerial skills already hamper the growth of industrial (textiles and clothing) and more high- 
tech sectors. In addition, government vocational training schemes are inadequate, and the training 
provided by individual firms is undersupplied because of high turnover. 

Access to effective government 

41. 
It almost goes without saying that Madagascar's future depends on the quality of its 
governance. So far, inconsistent policies, corruption, and a dysfunctional judiciary have 
depressed returns to economic activity and created a climate of uncertainty for private 
investment. They have also increased the degree of informality in the economy. Despite recent 
progress in these areas, more needs to be done to achieve high levels of private investment 
needed to fuel high rates of growth. 

I

indicators, Doing Business 2006 

42. 
Government regulations still remain burdensome, and the bureaucracy is unresponsive. 
Madagascar ranks 14gth out of 175 countries in ease of doing business (figure 5). For example, 
senior management of enterprises spend more than 20 percent of their time with regulators.22 Tax 
rules are also burdensome. 
Although Madagascar's 
overall revenue effort is low, 
it is unfairly distributed, 
since only large-scale civil 
firms pay taxes while export 
processing zone and 
informal sector producers 
remain outside the tax base. 
For firms that pay taxes, the 
burden is onerous. In 
addition to the high rates, the 
private sector complains 
about a lack of stability. 

43. 
On a positive note, it has become easier to start a business in Madagascar: it now takes 10 
steps and an average of 21 days at a cost of 35 percent of annual income per capita to register a 
new business compared with the regional average of 11 steps, 62 days, and 163 percent of annual 
income per capita. Clarification of rules and rights has recently motivated investment into mining 
and tourism. The new proposed changes to investment legislation and the newly established 
Economic Development Board of Madagascar, an apex body managed by a joint public-private 
board and responsible for investment promotion, is expected to further improve the investment 
climate. 

22 World Bank, Madagascar Investment Climate Assessment, 2005 

44. 
The performance o f the judiciary remains inadequate, mainly because o f procedural and 
institutional inefficiencies. Moreover, its credibility is undermined by perceptions of widespread 
corruption, confirmed by a recent government anticorruption survey. Despite recent efforts, 
progress in addressing these issues has been mixed. On the positive side, the backlog of cases a t 
the lower courts was reduced in Antananarivo and in some other jurisdictions. However, little 
progress has been made on the introduction of service standards. The standards for the lower 
courts, developed in 2005, have yet to be validated, and standards for the higher courts have yet 
to be developed. Also, efforts a t dealing with corruption in the judiciary through the disciplinary 
commission in the Ministry o f Justice have been ineffective. A key problem is resistance to 
change within the judiciary, as well as the lack of a consistent and credible reform strategy. 

45. 
Efforts are under way to improve the government's policymaking capacity. Concerns 
remain, however, that concentrating power in the presidential administration has led to weak 
mandates in line ministries. Rebalancing power between the office of the president and the 
ministries would strengthen the capacity o f ministries, enabling them to support the development 
and implementation of national and local agendas. To date, the government has put a priority on 
buttressing the technical capacity of the Ministry of Finance and priority sector ministries, such 
a s transportation, education, and now health. This strategy seems to have worked. 

46. 
Finally, the government faces the formidable challenge of strengthening the mechanisms 
of accountability for state actions.23 Domestic and foreign perception is that the country lacks a 
clear delineation between the public office and the private interests in certain sectors. As a result, 
conflicts of interest can arise even if they do not contravene norms. Regardless of the validity of 
these concerns, Madagascar will benefit from strengthened institutions of checks and balances. 
The experience of African countries demonstrates that political and economic stability is 
endangered when power and wealth are in the hands of a privileged few. The challenge is to 
reduce the scope for the use of state power for economic gain. In addition, there is also the 
perception that recent efforts a t rooting out corruption (BIANCO, for example) have stopped 
short of addressing concerns on grand corruption. The consequences of these governance 
problems are clearest in the forestry and mining sectors, where political and vested interests 
undermine progress (box 5).24 

47. 
Improving transparency and equity o f public institutions and of public services also 
requires strengthening the "demand" side of accountability, which remains weak both because of 
cultural traditions and because of a lack of information dissemination to citizens in a form that 
would enhance their involvement in holding service providers accountable. 

Improving service delivery 

48. 
As demonstrated in numerous countries, high economic growth alone is not enough to 
improve poor people's access to basic services or achieve positive development outcomes more 
generally.25 Nor is the availability of additional resources generated domestically or received 
from abroad. Effective public policy and action are also needed. 

*' Past reform efforts were hampered by political instability deriving partly from the failure of the leadership at the time to 
complement reform with openness and accountability. Political crises every 10 years or so have had a tremendous negative 
impact on Madagascar's economy and the lives of Malagasy people. Reversing this historical trend is critical to future 
success. 
24 An analysis of the country's political economy and sociopolitical factors has been carried out to inform CAS preparation. 
2 5 See the World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People. 

Box 5. Governance issues in forestry and mining 

Forestry. Weak governance has been a chronic problem in Madagascar's forestry sector. A progressive 
decline in both quality and efficiency of the forestry administration, formerly proud and well trained, 
coupled with a lack of checks and balances in issuing forestry permits contributed to this situation. The 
multiplicity of agents entitled to grant tree cutting permits (as well as the diversity of permits) further 
complicates monitoring. After cyclone Gafilo in 2005 permits granted to use wood for local construction led 
to widespread illegal logging, which resulted in over US$30 million in exports of precious woods, mostly 
from protected areas. 

There have been recent important efforts to strengthen governance in the forestry sector, including the 
creation a new tripartite Forestry-Justice-BIANCO commission, the seizing of significant quantities of 
illegal wood, simplification of judicial procedures to treat illegal cases, development of a system for 
tracking forestry permits, streamlining of responsibilities for permit allocation, the establishment of mobile 
control units, and the first ever granting of permits under competitive adjudication processes. However, it is 
too early to judge the success of these efforts. 

Mining. Governance in the mining sector is equally challenging. The government collects only a small part 
of the potential revenues from small-scale mining activities, mainly because of a lack of monitoring and 
control and because of widespread corruption, despite continuous efforts to improve sector governance. The 
Office des Mines Nationales et des Industries Strategiques (OMNIS) has been particularly resistant to 
modernization. 

Recent reform efforts include the update of the institutional and procedural framework governing the 
mining sector in 1999 and 2005. However, the framework needs further improvement, especially in light of 
growing interest in Madagascar by major mining operators. Rio Tinto is developing an ilmenite mine in the 
Fort Dauphin region, and two other large mines are being considered by potential investors (Ambatovy 
nickel mine and Tulear ilmenite mine). To increase transparency in this sector, the government is 
considering joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and has expressed its commitment to 
improving the legal and regulatory framework, strengthening capacity to manage mining and petroleum 
resources, and building the capacity of small-scale miners. However, the seriousness of these efforts 
remains to be seen. 

49. 
The challenges are many. Today, poor people are scattered and difficult to reach, 
particularly in rural areas. In addition, rapid population growth makes it difficult to maintain 
access to basic services nationwide. Moreover, the poor in Madagascar are exposed to recurrent 
economic and nature shocks. Finally, decades of neglect before the mid- 1990s led to poor 
coverage and quality of service delivery below the sub-Saharan Africa average (for example, in 
clean water and sewerage). Recent progress in service delivery must be consolidated, and the 
initiatives under way to improve the capacity of the state to deliver services must be improved by 
allowing local governments and communities to participate and by opening the space to third- 
party service providers. This should help the country get closer to meeting the MDGs. 

Public sector capacity to deliver sew ices 

50. 
To improve the state's capacity to deliver services, there is a need to mobilize a greater 
share of internal resources, put in place a modern system of public expenditure management, 
allocate a greater role and resources to the local governments, and increase the voice and 
accountability of local communities. 

5 1. 
The government is aware of the need to overhaul its tax policies and tax administration to 
improve the mobilization of internal resources (see box 2) and reduce compliance costs for 
enterprises. In addition, the process of improving the management of public resources is 
underway. The April 2006 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment 

confirms improvements in the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and advances in setting the 
needed legal framework, but it also points to a broad agenda ahead. This includes the 
introduction of a definitive budget classification; improvement of treasury management based on 
timely reporting by spending agencies and proper commitment control; strengthening internal 
and external control; and implementation of the new procurement legislation. Improvements in 
the quality of public expenditure are critical for more effective use of public resources and for 
greater mobilization of external support. 

52. Madagascar remains a highly centralized country, both administratively and fiscally, 
despite the early 1990s decentralization reform effort to empower communes.26 Commune 
competencies are limited to the basic function of administrative services and waste management 
and some cofinancing of social services through conditional grants. Local governments manage 
directly only 3 percent of total public resources. Moreover, their authority to raise taxes is 
severely limited. Some donor financing reaches communities to help build basic infrastructure 
and to meet some immediate needs, but the coverage is limited. 

53. 
Decentralization in Madagascar will have to go along with building the necessary 
financial and administrative foundations at the local level, which will require time. With the help 
of donors the government is working on the legal framework for decentralization. Two issues 
will need to be resolved in the short term to allow h r the r progress in this area: clarification of 
competencies of different levels of government and assignment of revenue and expenditure 
responsibilities. 

54. 
Service delivery efforts will have to be complemented by a strong emphasis on partnering 
with beneficiaries and clients in the monitoring and evaluation of services, including 
dissemination of information on service quality at the local level and strengthening the 
accountability links between service providers and users. Strengthening the capacity of civil 
society to hold the government accountable and demand stronger institutions will help to fine- 
tune service delivery to the needs of the people, leading to better results. 

55. 
Another area demanding urgent attention is the government's capacity to deal with 
economic and natural shocks. Madagascar's economy is vulnerable to price fluctuations of key 
commodities, such as vanilla and rice. In addition, it is among the countries with the highest risk 
level of natural disasters, such as droughts, cyclones, locust plagues, floods, etc. This situation is 
exacerbated by climate change. Madagascar has traditionally responded to these shocks after they 
happen, which involves costly repairs of roads, irrigation systems, schools, and other 
infrastructure since almost none of the major infrastructure in Madagascar is built according to 
cyclone or flooding norms and standards.27 

56. While equipping the state and society with mechanisms to cope with these challenges is a 
long-term task, much can be done over the short and medium term to improve the knowledge of 
the risks and to develop adaptation measures, particularly climate-proof norms and standards that 
minimize the cost of rebuilding. International experience shows that the cost of rebuilding tends 
to vastly exceed the cost of climate-proofing in the firstplace. In addition, efforts can be made to 
minimize the impact of trade volatility, shielding public expenditures (especially public 
consumption) from shocks. 

Territorial administration in Madagascar comprises five main levels: provinces, regions, districts, communes and villages. 
'' IDA'S Community Development Project has used anti-cyclone construction norms for schools, health facilities, etc. None 
of the infrastructure build under this project was destroyed by Gafilo (2004), the most violent cyclone in Madagascar in the 
last 4 0 years. 

Involving o the r a c t o r s in serv ice delivery 

57. 
To achieve better service delivery in an environment of limited public capacity and 
resources, nonstate actors must be involved. For example, churches have been involved in the 
delivery o f education and health services. The private sector has been partially filling the gap in 
secondary and higher levels of education, and it i s instrumental in financing and managing 
infrastructure. Already, Madagascar has made good progress in engaging the private sector 
thorough public-private partnerships in power, ports, and railways. Still, there is substantial scope 
for increased private sector participation, especially i n power and transportation. 

11. 

THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM 

58. 
To deal with the challenges discussed above, the government has put in place a bold 5- 
year development plan-the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP+which 
is the second-generation 
Poverty Reduction Strategy. The MAP envisages accelerated and better coordinated reforms, and 
outlines the "strategies and actions that will ignite rapid growth, lead to the reduction of poverty, 
and ensure that the country develops in response to the challenges of globalization and in 
accordance with the national vision-Madagascar Naturally-and 
the Millennium Development 
~ o a l s . " ~ ' 

59. 
The MAP was prepared in a participatory way, with workshops organized in all 22 
regions that culminated in a national launch workshop in November 2006. The MAP includes 
eight commitments: (1) responsible governance; (2) connected infrastructure; (3) educational 
transformation; (4) rural development and a green revolution; (5) health, family planning, and the 
fight against HIVIAIDS; (6) high growth economy; (7) cherish the environment; and (8) national 
solidarity. For each commitment, the government identified key challenges, goals and strategies, 
priority projects and activities, and key monitoring indicators. The MAP identifies six 
"breakthrough initiativesm-that 
is, areas requiring immediate attention: public finance reform; 
significant increase in investment to promote high growth; sowing the seeds of a green 
revolution; transforming public security; implementing bold new measures for health and family 
planning; and transforming the judiciary. 

60. 
The programs for implementing the MAP commitments are being elaborated in greater 
detail in sector strategies. Some of these strategies are already in place-such 
as the strategies in 
rural development, health, primary education, rural water, transport, and HIVIAIDS. The 
government is working on a risk management and social protection strategy, a financial sector 
strategy, and is revising the education strategy, including post-primary education, in line with the 
MAP. Implementation of the MAP is guided by the annual budget laws, which include annual 
results agreements between the president and cabinet ministers. 

61. 
The MAP recognizes the importance of public participation, fighting corruption, building 
leadership capacity and skills, and mobilizing resources (financial, technical, material, and 
human) to make it a success. Two key new institutions have been put in place to support MAP 
implementation: the Economic Development Board of Madagascar to facilitate and promote 
private domestic and foreign investment and the National Leadership Institute o f Madagascar to 
build capacity in government and other sectors of society.

Bank assessment 

62. Madagascar's decision-makers face a classic and immensely difficult tradeoff. Of course, 
Madagascar needs to do many things a t once: reduce corruption in the judiciary and customs 
service, privatize inefficient and loss-making state-owned enterprises, build roads, increase 
access to education, improve availability o f credit, reduce tax and customs evasion, enhance 
tourist infrastructure, increase labor flexibility, ensure environmental sustainability, strengthen 
public sector management and budget execution, and so on. However, in light of the 
government's limited capacity and resources, it must focus on areas where significant progress is 
possible a t relatively low cost-such 
a s streamlining the regulatory environment, improving 
public sector efficiency, and rooting out corruption. Elsewhere, reforms must attract donor 
support or make use o f public-private partnerships to expand the resource envelope. 

63. 
The MAP objectives are linked to the high growth scenario, with growth o f 7-10 percent, 
which is linked to significantly higher donor assistance, higher domestic revenue mobilization 
and higher public and private investment than currently projected. The baseline scenario, 
supported through the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility, includes a more realistic scenario based on identified external assistance flows and more 
conservative levels of domestic revenue and investment. For 2007, the MAP growth objectives 
are identical in both scenarios, reflecting the most up-to-date information. The annual finance 
laws provide the opportunity to update the medium-term macroeconomic framework in light o f 
identified foreign assistance flows, improved domestic revenue mobilization and progress in 
growth enhancing structural reforms. The base case medium term economic outlook is presented 
in attachment 5, and the 2006 joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis is presented in 
attachment 6. 

111. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY 

A. LESSONS FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TH E 

2004-06 COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

64. 
The 2 0 0 4 4 6 CAS offers valuable lessons. The CAS was h l l y aligned with the PRSP, 
including the existing portfolio that was re-oriented to ensure that it supported the PRSP. This 
alignment was key in ensuring that good progress was achieved. 

65. Most progress was made in areas with high government ownership (for example, 
education). Progress was also made in areas where the Bank has been engaged over a long-term 
period with a concerted effort on improving capacity and providing reliable and continuous 
financial support (for example, nutrition, environment, health, and roads). However, with the 
benefit o f hindsight, one can note that the CAS was somewhat optimistic about the government's 
capacity to implement reforms. In some instances, the goals were too ambitious; in others, 
commitments to reform were constrained by capacity in the government. The Bank's work on 
capacity building has been well targeted and is showing incipient results but this is a long-term 
undertaking given the enormity of the task. 

66. 
The introduction of the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) during the CAS 
provided an important forum for policy dialogue and significantly improved many aspects o f how 
the Bank and other donors supported the country. The credits increased the focus on 
strengthening o f country systems, greatly improved the reliability and predictability o f foreign 

aid, and strengthened donor collaboration. However, reliance on PRSCs for the transition o f 
programs related to human development to the government's budget proved premature because 
the failure to mobilize planned resources had a negative impact on the execution of these priority 
programs (e.g., nutrition). As a consequence, the Bank has become more cautious with regard to 
transferring sector programs to budget support. 

6 7 . 

The use of the sectonvide approach in specific sector interventions has worked well, 
particularly in education, HIVIAIDS, and transport. This approach has allowed for better 
institutional strengthening and greater donor-government harmonization around agreed sector 
strategies. In addition, the growth poles approach-focusing 
assistance on specific geographical 
areas to ensure the complementary o f initiatives on the ground-seems promising, but it is too 
early to ascertain its fbll effectiveness. 

6 8 . 

The Bank undertook a broad range of analytical and advisory work to ground its 
interventions, especially the PRSCs. With hindsight, a greater emphasis on dissemination could 
have increased its impact. Also, certain areas remained relatively undeveloped, such as the link 
between growth and poverty and key strategic growth priorities. This work is now under way. 

69. 
During implementation of the CAS, the Bank and other donors adopted a more results- 
oriented approach, led by the PRSP, gradually increasing focus on critical indicators and key 
results in selected areas. However, the weakness of the statistical system has been a serious 
impediment to accurately assessing impact. In addition, some IDA-financed interventions were 
designed to test new policies and approaches (for example, rural water and microfinance). To 
move fiom these successfbl pilots to nationwide coverage, the new strategy will need to scale up 
the program and increase the impact of donor and government resources. 

70. 

An important lesson is that the increased staff presence in the Bank's Country Office 
strengthened the relationship with the government, facilitated timely responses, improved 
coordination with other donors, and improved the quality o f implementation through 
empowerment o f Country Office staff and through a strong local fiduciary and safeguards team. 

7 1. 
Integration within the World Bank Group improved. IDA and the IFC are working 
particularly closely in the energy and financial sectors, with emphasis on innovative guarantee 
mechanisms, microfinance, and leasing. The World Bank Institute (WBI) and IDA have worked 
together on various fionts, including public expenditure management, leadership training, and 
public private partnerships. The experience confirms that WBI learning activities work best when 
they are fblly integrated with IDA programs. The full CAS Completion Report can be found in 
attachment 8. 

72. 
The Independent Evaluation Group completed a Country Assistance Evaluation in July 
2006 of IDA'S involvement in Madagascar for 1995-2005. While the Country Assistance 
Evaluation provides a valuable assessment of IDA'S program, its 10-year horizon does not, by its 
nature, allow for a separate assessment o f the last CAS. Still, it provides relevant 
recommendations to: (i) include a CAS response in case of renewed political instability; (ii) 
better understand the determinants of growth, especially in rural areas; (iii) focus governance 
interventions on a few critical areas; (iv) limit the role o f budget support until there is a sustained 
improvement in collecting and managing public resources; and (v) pay greater attention to 
monitoring and evaluation. 

7 3 . 

Based on these lessons, there are some important implications for the new CAS: 

Align the CAS to the government's program (MAP) and increase focus on results and on 
tracking impact. However, be realistic about what can be achieved given the capacity 
constraints and the limited financing envelope. 
Sharpen understanding of the underpinnings for shared growth, especially in rural areas, 
and focus on removing the main constraints to growth. 
Support the government in its efforts at scaling up and leveraging additional resources- 
internal and external, public and private (expanding on positive donor harmonization 
experiences and public-private partnerships). 
Focus governance interventions on a few but critical areas (for example, public 
expenditure management, forestry, mining, tax, and customs). 
Increase efforts at knowledge dissemination of existing and future analytical work. 

74. 
This CAS comes at a propitious time. Capitalizing on the successes of the last few years, 
the country has embarked on a new ambitious reform program-the Madagascar Action Plan- 
spearheaded by President Ravalomanana, who won reelection for another five years in December 
2006. The CAS seeks to build on this momentum and, jointly with other donors, support 
Madagascar's efforts to solidify its gains and make further progress in transforming the economy. 
Fortunately, the World Bank Group has a solid ongoing program in Madagascar and has a critical 
mass of knowledge and experience. While building on this solid foundation, the CAS recognizes 
the inherent risks. A critical challenge to the government and the donor community is how to 
align the country's vast development needs with its limited financial and institutional resources. 

75. Madagascar has an absorptive capacity well beyond the existing IDA envelope. The 
government has requested IDA advice and assistance in many aspects of the MAP, especially 
given that there are few donors engaged in Madagascar to the point that in some areas IDA is the 
only relevant external player. Therefore, it is difficult for IDA to exit some areas, a challenge also 
recognized in the Country Assistance Evaluation (2006). The assistance strategy presented in this 
document has been formulated with regard to these constraints. To increase the strategy's impact 
in a resource-constrained environment, the Bank Group will build on its convening power to act 
as a catalyst and attract additional external support to Madagascar. However, this is a risky 
strategy in that it assumes that Madagascar will be able to attract more attention from donors than 
before. 

Country Assistance Strategy principles and approach 

76. 

The CAS will be guided by the following set of basic principles: 

77. 
Aligning with the governmentprogram (Madagascar Action Plan): As the review of the 
last CAS suggests, government ownership remains essential to successful implementation. To 
strengthen ownership, the CAS was designed in parallel with the MAP in terms of timing, 
duration and substance. This included sustained discussions with the government during 2006, 
including the presidential administration, cabinet, sector ministries and civil society. The CAS 
covers almost the same time period as the MAP (2007-12) and supports the attainment of the 
MAP results. In doing so, the CAS supports the aspects of the government program that are of 
the highest priority and where the Bank Group has a comparative advantage. 

78. 
Harmonizing and aligning with other donors: In line with the government's request and 
consistent with the Paris Declaration on Harmonization, the Bank Group's assistance to 
Madagascar is aligned with that of other donors to provide a package of coordinated support 
around the government's MAP. Specifically, the preparation o f this CAS was closely coordinated 
with other partners and is designed to facilitate maximum harmonization with other donors and 
the use of the country systems. The work on the latter will build on the ongoing efforts to 
strengthen the public expenditure management, public procurement and other fiduciary aspects of 
the country systems. The use of the sectorwide approach in policy and investment lending and 
phasing out of project implementation units will contribute to moving this agenda forward. 

79. 
Acting as a catalyst for scaling up results: The Bank will help the country position itself 
to profit from scaling-up opportunities as they arise and play a catalytic role in leveraging 
additional resources (public and private) for Madagascar. In this regard, it will work through two 
channels: (i) the World Bank's Africa scaling-up initiative and (ii) direct mobilization of donor 
resources to concrete sectors and programs (this channel is expected to yield more results). 
Building on its convening authority and comparative advantage a s a global knowledge 
institution, the Bank will assist the government with the development of credible sector 
strategies and programs which are important for attracting donor and private sector support. In 
addition, IDA will help improve the country's own capacity to mobilize resources and to spend 
them effectively. The CAS approach to scaling up is described in box 6. 

Box 6. The Country Assistance Strategy approach to scaling up 

Four issues are critical to Madagascar's scaling up agenda, all of them supported by the CAS. 
First, the government needs to increase internal resource mobilization. But more transparent public 
procurement and monitoring of program results are also critical. 

Second, the government needs to attract more private resources. To do so, it should continue to improve 
the investment climate and attract private-public partnerships in infrastructure. 
Third, the Bank Group and other development partners will help the government develop sector strategies 
and programs and put in place pilot programs that can serve as a platform for harmonizing and scaling up 
donor programs. To this end, the CAS will seek ways to increase donor collaboration, including the 
promotion of the sectorwide approach and of the menu of options (syndication model) proposed in the 
Africa Action Plan. Under the latter, IDA will prepare projects that would be financed by other 
development partners. 

Fourth, the Bank will work with the government to increase the capacity for program implementation in 
ministries and agencies. 

Several areas are ready for scaling up today. In these areas, the sector programs are in place, the 
institutional framework is functioning, and the approach is successfully piloted. By and large, the only 
element missing is funds to replicate these successful programs at a national scale: 
Rural water supply: sector strategy and institutional structure in place and piloted. 
Microfinance: approach successfully piloted, a good basis for scaling-up. 
Transport: strong institutions in place, good donor coordination. 
In addition, there are several potential areas such as health, environment and the local development fund 
that should become ready for scaling up during the CAS period. 

80. Moving gradually to greater selectivity: Given the difficulty of exiting abruptly some of 
the areas of IDA involvement presently, the strategy is to move gradually to greater selectivity as 
part of the scaling up process. During the CAS period, a special emphasis will b e placed on 

gradually building the basis for transferring initiatives to the government and other partners in 
areas such as nutrition, finance, and Local Development Fund. 

8 1. 
Using an integrated approach: The CAS will use an integrated approach to deliver 
results at the national and regional levels. This approach will work in two ways. To deliver 
nationwide results in areas such as health or education, it will combine various instruments 
(PRSC, investment operations, technical assistance, community interventions, analytica1,and 
advisory assistance) needed to meet the sector objectives. And to deliver results in specific 
geographical areas with high growth potential, it will focus on removing the key bottlenecks to 
unleashing the area's growth potential. A good example of this latter approach is the Growth 
Poles Project started under the previous CAS (box 7). In both cases, the interventions will work 
at both national and local levels and seek to involve all key stakeholders. 

Box 7. Using an integrated approach: The Growth Poles Project 

The Integrated Growth Poles Project (US$129.8 million, FY2005) is a joint IDA, IFC, Foreign 
Investment Advisory Service, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency effort that aims to stimulate 
growth in three geographical regions with high potential by addressing the key bottlenecks to investment. 
The three poles are: Nosy Be for tourism-led growth, Fort Dauphin for mining and tourism-led growth, 
and Antananarivo-Antsirabe for export-led growth. 
In Nosy Be, the project invests in minimum infrastructure (road network and urban infrastructure) to kick 
start growth and supports the creation of a regulatory environment conducive to tourism expansion. 
In Fort Dauphin, it focuses on the development of a new port to support tourism and the ilmenite mining 
operations and to facilitate market access for local production, upgrading of the road network and urban 
infrastructure and strengthening capacity of the municipality. 
In Antananarivo-Antsirabe it supports export-led growth through technical assistance to potential 
industrial and agribusiness zones, private-public partnerships to establish an ICT business park in 
Antananarivo, and support to the municipalities of Antananarivo and Antsirabe through technical 
assistance and training. 

In addition to specific activities in each growth pole, the project supports cross-cutting activities critical to 
all three growth poles such as business climate and access to finance. 

1 

CAS approach to governance and capacity building 

82. 
A critical cross-cutting element of this CAS is improving governance and reducing 
corruption. The CAS will build on the efforts started under the previous CAS in support of the 
government's far-reaching program to improve governance in a holistic and consistent manner. 
Future governance interventions will seek to consolidate the current gains and continue to 
support the governance agenda in a more targeted and selective manner. At the regulatory level 
efforts will focus on closing the gaps in the legal and procedural framework to combat 
corruption, in particular on regulating conflict-of-interest issues. At the same time, support will 
focus on critical aspects for the implementation of the governance agenda in (i) resource 
mobilization (tax and customs); (ii) public expenditure management; (iii) management of natural 
and mineral resources; and (iv) decentralization. 

8 3 . 
In each of these areas, the Bank Group and the government will work to improve 
government capacity and efficiency by emphasizing measures that increase transparency, reduce 
discretionary controls, encourage the participation of users in the provision of services, and 
involve citizens in monitoring the quality of service delivery. For example, in health and 

education, it will particularly emphasize transparency of public financial transactions through 
public expenditure tracking exercises and participation and oversight by users, and dissemination 
of information on services to allow for greater citizen involvement in monitoring services. 
Details on specific governance interventions are included in the description of CAS pillars 
presented in the next section. 

84. 
Building on the ongoing capacity building efforts that include both supply and demand 
side, the World Bank Group will continue to integrate specific training and capacity building 
measures across sectors, projects, and analytical and advisory activities, in line with the Capacity 
Development Management Action Plan (CDMAP) of the Africa Action Plan. It will continue to 
strengthen local training institutions and help the government further develop the capacity of the 
National Leadership Institute, the civil service training colleges and the justice training school. 
To improve cross-sector collaboration it will continue to support the 'rapid results' methodology 
as an important tool to improve administrative efficiency. It will pay special attention to building 
capacity in the key ministries involved in implementing CAS programs such as the Ministries of 
Finance, Health, and Education. 

C. BANK GROUP PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE STRATEGIC OUTCOMES 

Strategic objectives 

8 5 . 
As the earlier analysis suggests, this CAS will continue the Bank Group's focus on 
removing the bottlenecks for sustainable and shared growth, anchored in good governance, with 
corresponding improvements in welfare indicators, in line with the MAP goals. The specific sets 
of results supported by the CAS have been organized around two main pillars. The first pillar 
concentrates on activities that will help remove constraints to investment and growth in rural and 
urban areas. The second pillar brings together activities geared toward improving the scope and 
quality of service delivery to people. A brief outline of the expected CAS results and proposed 
program to deliver them follows. 

CAS results 

86 . 

The CAS results framework developed by the government and the Bank Group supports 
the MAP objectives. The results matrix (attachment 1) summarizes the MAP objectives that the 
CAS seeks to support, the results that the Bank Group hopes to achieve through its interventions, 
and the instruments that the Bank Group will use to implement the program. The government is 
h l l y committed to achieving these goals, but it is also aware that meeting them will be a 
challenge given resource and institutional constraints. The results framework does not reflect 
possible acceleration of outcomes as a result of scaling up donor assistance. If additional 
resources become available, the framework will be revised accordingly in the CAS Progress 
Report. 

87. 
The instruments and programs that the Bank Group will use to deliver the CAS results are 
discussed below. The ongoing World Bank Group portfolio will play an important role in the 
delivery o f the CAS objectives (box 8). 

Box 8. The current World Bank Group program 

As of January 3 1,2007, the IDAIGEF portfolio consists of 16 IDA and one GEF project with total 
commitments of US$974 million. Of that, a total of US$368 million remains undisbursed. The portfolio 
quality is good with all projects rated Satisfactory. About one third of the portfolio is concentrated in the 
human development sectors and one quarter in infrastructure. The Madagascar Country Office is in charge 
of portfolio management with a decentralized team covering fiduciary and safeguards issues, a portfolio 
manager and cluster leaders for each Bank network. The portfolio continues to disburse strongly with the 
disbursement ratio averaging about 33 percent. The table below shows how the current portfolio supports 
the CAS pillars.

IFC has a strong program that includes a full range of investment and technical assistance services mainly 
in support of the first CAS pillar. IFC's committed portfolio is US$26.6 million. It is building an 
investment pipeline in mining, infrastructure and financial sectors. IFC is a major player in the energy 
sector. In the financial sector, IFC and IDA are working together to improve access to finance through 
guarantees and credit lines, and support new lines of business, such as leasing. The IDA-IFC Risk Sharing 
Facility, approved in April 2006, was the first joint IFC and IDA instrument developed in the history of the 
Bank. In addition, IFC established a Small Medium Enterprise (SME) Solutions Center and has put in place 
a US$10 million SME Fund, which should be l l l y operational soon. In infrastructure, the LFC Advisory 
Services conducted the successful concession of the container terminal of the Toamasina port in June 2005. 
It is now helping the government to attract the private sector to the 12 main country airports. Private 
Enterprise Partnership (PEP) Africa is implementing programs in entrepreneurship development, leasing 
and export promotion and is currently developing proposals covering tourism and rural electrification. 

MIGA 's outstanding portfolio in Madagascar consists of five guarantee contracts, issued to French and 
Mauritian investors in agribusiness, power generation and tourism. The total gross exposure is US$6.3 
million. In addition, MIGA is finalizing an insurance project with a French investor for a small hydropower 
project, a second investment in this priority sector. The anticipated gross exposure is up to U S 2 0 million. 
Madagascar is one of 11 African countries participating in MIGA's Enterprise Benchmarking Program, 
which gauges a country's ability to compete with other potential locations for foreign investment. All these 
activities support the first CAS pillar. 

The WBI program is increasingly integrated with IDA, especially after the selection of Madagascar as a 
focus country three years ago. WBI and IDA have worked together on leadership training and capacity 
building in public expenditure management, public private partnerships, social protection, health, and 
education. The focus is now shifting to building capacity in regional trade integration and social 
accountability, while the attention to public-private partnerships and social risk management continues. 

CAS instruments 

8 8 . 
The CAS will make use of all available World Bank Group instruments. A brief 
description on the use of some of the instruments is presented below. 

The next Poverty Reduction Support Credit cycle 

89. 
The PRSCs will continue to serve as a forum for policy dialogue with the government and 
as a platform for donor harmonization. The next series will h r t h e r emphasize removing the main 
policy bottlenecks to achieving the MAP and CAS objectives. Given the breadth of the potential 
agenda, the PRSCs will seek to avoid dispersion and focus on a few critical issues (such as 
governance and public resource management). It will provide US$40-50 million a year, which will 
complement the IDA debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative of over US$30 
million a year during the CAS period. In response to the lessons learnt from the previous PRSC 
cycle that transition to budget support needs to happen more gradually, budget support will be 
scaled up gradually to encompass other sectors in tandem with improvements in the public finance 
system. 

Use of sectonvide approaches 

90. 
The CAS will increase the use of the sector-wide approach that has proven effective in 
Madagascar-especially in areas that require joint efforts by the government and donors to 
strengthen the strategic framework and enhance capacity building. 

Public-private partnerships and guarantees 

9 1. 
The limited availability of public and donor resources to cover the country's immense 
infrastructure needs calls for greater involvement of the private sector. IDA, IFC, and the 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will use a variety of instruments to attract 
private sector investment-such as political and partial risk guarantees, equity investments, as 
well as support the creation of an environment conducive to private sector participation. Special 
attention will be paid to public-private partnerships (PPP) for promising infrastructure projects. 
This work will build on the positive experience with PPPs, ports, electricity and railways sectors. 

Analytical and advisory services 

92. 
Important analytical work needed to support the key objectives of this CAS is still under 
way. A Country Economic Memorandum on growth, a programmatic Public Expenditure 
Review, a Tax Policy Note, and studies on labor markets and post-primary education will provide 
the basis for strengthening the dialogue and the design of CAS programs. 

93. 
The CAS will seek to improve the effectiveness of its analytical and advisory activities as 
an important component of the Bank's institutional and capacity building effort in Madagascar. 
The interaction with counterparts and dissemination of analflcal and advisory activities will 
receive the same level of attention, if not more, than the analytical part of the work. 
Dissemination will also cover work completed under the previous CAS. This means that the 
Bank will produce fewer high-end reports and more just-in-time short policy notes focused on 
answering the questions of the day. The high-end reports will be carried out only on key 
strategic, forward-looking issues and disseminated more effectively. The analytical and advisory 
activities will also serve to improve working with other donors, including joint preparation of 
analytical work. 

Proposed CAS lending and AAA program 

Pillar I: Remove the bottlenecks to investment and growth in rural and urban areas 

94. 
Based on the diagnostics in the first part of the CAS, IDA will assist the government's 
efforts to attract investment to Madagascar and to set the basis for long-term economic prosperity. 
In doing so it will support the following MAP commitments: high growth economy; rural 
development and green revolution; connected infrastructure; cherished environment; and 
responsible governance (see figure 6 for pillar I contribution to MAP goals and attachment 2 for a 
mapping of the MAP goals and CAS interventions). The upcoming Country Economic 
Memorandum on growth will enrich the current growth diagnostics and help fine-tune future 
World Bank Group interventions in support of growth. The Country Economic Memorandum will 
emphasize the determinants of employment-based growth, especially in rural areas. 

95. 
Eliminate the barriers that limit access to domestic and international markets. The Bank 
Group will step up its assistance to better integrate the economy into the global and regional 
markets and to profit from the existing market opportunities at home. This will include continued 
technical assistance to build government capacity and to help producers adopt improved quality 
standards under the ongoing Trade Integrated Framework Program. In addition, the World Bank 
Group will finance investments in irrigation infrastructure and support marketing and other 
services to increase agricultural productivity and diversification. The Bank Group will also help 
the government to reduce the cost of the logistics in the economy. In this regard, the World Bank 
Group, in cooperation with the European Commission and other donors, will continue to support 
policy reforms and investments in transportation - roads, railways, ports, etc. In doing so, it will 
place special emphasis on the sustainability of the investments (for example, road maintenance 
rather than road construction) and on involving the private sector through public-private 
partnerships. Finally, the Bank Group will continue its programs aimed at lowering air transport 
and telecommunication costs and improving accessibility through an open sky policy and 
upgrades to the telecommunications sector, including through the development of a national 
backbone, connected to the regional communications network via a East Africa submarine system 
(EASSy). 

96. 
As to instruments, IDA will continue to provide assistance in an integrated fashion 
through ongoing o p e r a t i o n s 4 r o w t h Poles Project (FY06), Watershed and Irrigation Adaptable 
Program Loan (FY07), and two transport operations-followed by new planned transport and 
growth operations. If the ongoing growth pole approach shows good results, the new growth 
operation could support its replication in other regions in collaboration with development 
partners and private sector. The PRSCs will complement, as needed, the implementation of pro- 
growth policies, help sort out priorities, address coordination issues, and provide budget support. 
Analytical work will supplement these efforts by carrying out a comprehensive infrastructure 
review to identify the main bottlenecks and develop a strategic vision as well as to evaluate the 
impact of the undertaken investments. Cross-cutting technical support on strengthening the 
demand side of governance through social accountability mechanisms will be carried out by IDA, 
with additional support from WBI on capacity building. WBI will also help improve 
communication and information sharing with the rural areas through a community radio program. 
To facilitate public private partnerships (PPP), WBI will help restructure the current privatization 
agency into a PPP unit.

Improve access to f inance and factor markets. IDA, working with the IFC and the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation as well as other donors, will increase its support to the 
financial sector, addressing bottlenecks that are preventing the emergence of a financial services 
industry that meets the needs of all market segments, from microfinance to large enterprises. For 
IDA, this work will include the provision of technical assistance to improve the supervision and 
regulatory framework, payment and credit information systems, and the institutional capacity o f 
the sector. The cooperation between IDA and the IFC will continue to facilitate access to credit 
and other financial services including such emerging areas as guarantees and leasing. In addition, 
building on the FSAP recommendations and the successful implementation of the on-going 
microfinance pilot project, the Bank Group will continue assisting the government to develop the 
strategy and programs for scaling up and expanding coverage of the financial sector interventions 
using a sectonvide approach with other donors. Given the IDA resource constraint, IDA will look 
into alternative possibilities to support this priority sector, such as the Africa Action Plan menu 
of options (syndication model) under which IDA would develop a financial sector project that 
would be entirely financed by other partners. A supplemental IDA credit for the ongoing 
microfinance project will be put in place in FY07 to provide bridge financing until the multi- 
donor sectonvide support is in place. 

98. 
The Bank Group will continue its efforts at improving the situation in the energy sector. 
To this end, the IFC and IDA will work together with the government on a concession 
arrangement for the power company Jirama and on attracting private agents to generate and sell 
electricity. The main instruments are the Energy and Water Adaptable Program Loan 1&2 
(FY07109) and an IFC-IDA Partial Risk Guarantee for public-private partnership investments in 
hydropower (FY09). Additionally, MIGA intends to support its second guarantee in the energy 
sector in FY08. WBI will help strengthen the capacity of Jirama in carrying out its mission. 
Access to land for investors will be tackled under the Growth Poles Project. 

99. 
Reduce regulatory burden and foster competition. IDA will continue to assist the 
government's efforts to improve its business climate and bring in higher levels of foreign direct 
investment. This will include continued assistance to the Economic Development Board and 
other agencies to improve the regulatory environment, achieve greater transparency in issuing 
licenses and concessions (especially in mining, fishing, tourism, and forestry), and improve the 
quality of governance in extractive industries, including the country's joining of the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). A key objective is to balance the economic potential in 
these sectors with sustainable development. IFC, Foreign Investment Advisory Service, and 
MIGA assistance will complement these efforts. Some important areas such as the reform of the 
judiciary will be mainly covered by other partners such as the European Commission and the 
U.S. Agency for International Development in line with agreed division of labor among donors. 
The IDA instruments will include the ongoing and new Growth Poles, Mining, and Governance 
and Institutional Development projects. Through its Radio Learning Program WBI will support 
the fight against corruption by providing a learning platform for municipal officials, mayors, and 
representatives of civil society on anti-conuption and good governance. 

100. Achieve sustainable development and minimize the impact of shocks. IDA will build on 
the progress made so far to preserve Madagascar's unique natural environment by supporting the 
expansion of the System of Protected Areas of Madagascar to 6 million hectares. It will 
encourage development of a concession policy to engage the private sector in managing the 
protected areas. In addition, IDA will help the government develop national capacity to increase 
the country's resilience to frequent natural calamities. During the CAS period, implementation of 

the government's strategy in this area will begin on a pilot basis. The Bank Group will start with 
reinforcing climate modeling, developing climate-proof standards and adhering to them in its 
own projects. It will also help the government assess the feasibility a Risk Insurance Scheme and 
its piloting. The ongoing as well as a follow-on IDA project in the environment sector, together 
with Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects and analytical and advisory activities, will 
support these ongoing efforts. 

Pillar 11: Improve access to, and quality oJ services to people 

101. The World Bank Group will complement the growth-generating activities under the first 
CAS pillar with activities aimed at increasing the availability of, and facilitating access to, 
services. Specifically, it will seek to assist the government in improving revenue mobilization 
and budgetary practices to help address the resource shortage and to scale up the social programs, 
achieve better outcomes in health and education, improve the management of weather shocks, 
and gradually move service delivery closer to people. In doing so it will support the following 
MAP commitments: educational transformation; health, family planning and the fight against 
HIV/AIDS; and good governance (see figure 8 for pillar I1 contribution to MAP goals and 
attachment 2 for a mapping o f the MAP goals and CAS interventions). 

102. 
Increase internal resource mobilization and transform the budget into an effective 
instrument of developmentpolicy. Helping to improve all aspects of public finances will be a 
high priority for the CAS. Working jointly with other partners, such as the IMF and France, IDA 
will continue to assist the authorities' efforts to increase the level o f internal resource 
mobilization. Work on taxation and customs will seek to streamline the rules, create a level 
playing field for all taxpayers by reducing tax exemptions, and facilitate compliance with tax 
norms. In addition, IDA, jointly with other donors, will continue to help the government better 
align the allocation of resources with MAP priorities. Further assistance will be provided to 
institutionalize the public finance and procurement reforms with the focus on timely budgetary 
reporting by spending agencies and proper commitment control, strengthening internal and 
external control and implementation of the new procurement law. Periodic PEFA assessments 
will monitor progress. IDA instruments will include Poverty Reduction Support Credits, the 
ongoing and new Governance and Institutional Development projects, and complementary 
analytical and advisory work such as the programmatic Public Expenditure Review, the Country 
Financial Accountability Assessment, social accountability program, as well as continued close 
portfolio management. 

103. Achieve better outcomes in education and health. IDA, jointly with other donors, will 
continue to assist the government in its efforts to reach universal enrollment in primary 
education, increase completion rates, and improve the quality of education at all levels to better 
prepare the workforce for a more advanced economy. The primary avenue for assistance will be 
the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative with Africa Catalytic Fund resources. IDA assistance 
will also include advice and investments in post-primary education and review of the labor 
market. 

104. 
In health, it will help the government make further progress on reducing child and 
maternal mortality by offering access to reproductive services, reducing child malnutrition, 
improving the availability of clean water and sanitation services, and keeping HIVIAIDS and 
sexually transmitted disease rates under control. This will be achieved through the ongoing 
operations in health and HIV/AIDS as well as a new series o f health operations using a

sectorwide approach. In addition, IDA will continue to work with the government on 
institutionalizing the nutrition program and the extension of nutrition support sites nationwide 
initially through the ongoing nutrition project and then through general budget support. Progress 
in service delivery both in health and education will be measured through public expenditure- 
tracking exercises, audits, surveys, and direct participation and oversight by beneficiaries. 

105. Gradually move service delivery closer to thepeop le . IDA will assist the authorities in 

decentralizing the provision of basic services. The assistance will focus on fine-tuning and 
implementing the decentralization strategy, including assigning revenues and expenditure 
responsibility across different levels of government. IDA, the European Union, and other donors 
will provide financial support for the Local Development Fund (FY08) which is a new 
harmonized and government-led mechanism for infrastructure finance at the local level that 
builds on the experience of the ongoing Community Development Project. The technical 
assistance will be provided through the Governance and Institutional Development Project, 
Community Development Project, and sector dialogue. The Poverty Reduction Support Credits 
will provide budget support to key sectors and assist with identifying priorities and tracking the 
implementation agenda. The social accountability technical assistance will identify opportunities 
for enhancing citizen involvement, support regional exchange of experience on social 
accountability and technical support to national level learning and awareness raising on social 
accountability initiatives. W I will support this overall strategy directly (through links with 
regional programs such as the African Network for Social Accountability) and through support 
for workshops and regional learning and by helping build the capacity of the parliament, media 
and other national bodies to exercise their oversight functions and increase the demand for good 
governance. W I will also continue supporting the implementation of the social protection 
strategy. 

Monitoring and evaluation 

106. Monitoring and evaluation will receive special attention given the results-based nature of 
the CAS and the MAP. Establishing credible baselines in Madagascar is a big challenge. The 
Bank Group will work in close cooperation with other donors to help the government improve its 
monitoring and evaluation capacity. Currently, the government is developing a MAP monitoring 
system. The government is also elaborating a national statistics strategy to rationalize the 
statistical system, strengthen statistical capacity, improve the quality of statistics, ensure greater 
access and use of data for policy making, and coordinate external assistance. An ongoing 
Institutional Development Fund grant for monitoring and evaluation and the Governance and 
Institutional Development Project are supporting the development of a results framework for the 
MAP and the national statistics strategy. IDA, through the Governance and Institutional 
Development Project, will help the Statistical Agency implement the national statistics strategy 
and to undertake preparatory actions for conducting a population census in the near future. 

107. The Bank Group will strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of its own projects, 
including beneficiary surveys to evaluate user satisfaction. IDA and the IFC will continue their 
surveys of the business environment to monitor progress in that area. They will also seek to 
involve local communities in monitoring and evaluation, which will also require greater 
dissemination, in appropriate forms, of information on norms of service, targets, and resource 
transfers. Table 2 summarizes the main CAS indicators expected during the next five years. 
Progress on meeting the CAS indicators will be reviewed annually jointly with the government 
and development partners in tandem with the review of the MAP implementation.

Indicative IDA program 

108. Table 3 summarizes IDA'S proposed lending program for the CAS period. The size of the 
program is driven by the IDA performance allocation system. If the government slips on core 
elements of reforms, such as governance or structural policies, this will adversely affect its 
performance-based allocation under IDA. The quality of the IDA portfolio, particularly as 
regards procurement, will also be an important determinant of the IDA allocation. The indicative 
annual IDA envelope during the CAS period is projected at around US$145 million (SDR 99 
m i l l i ~ n ) . ~ ' 
In addition, the government will benefit fiom the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative 
(MDRI) supported by IDA in the amount of over US$30 million a year.30 The FY07-08 IDA 
lending program presented in table 3 is slightly higher than the currently estimated allocation in 
anticipation of an increased IDA allocation in FY08 due to improved country performance. The 
FY08 project amounts will be adjusted based on the availability of IDA resources. 

109. The IDA allocations to each project should be seen as indicative. Given the need to be 
catalytic, the CAS program will necessarily be flexible in the choice and number of instruments 
and will try to maximize prospects for cofinancing. As mentioned before, the ongoing World Bank 
Group program (see box 8) will play an important role in the delivery of the CAS objectives as 
most of these projects will continue to be implemented during the CAS period. 

29 The IDA allocation may be reduced if Madagascar is classified as a country with moderate debt distress for IDA grant 
allocation purpose in the future. The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis will be produced jointly with the International 
Monetary Fund in the first half of 2007. 
' O This year, thanks in part to resources freed up by MDRI, the share of priority spending (health, education, infrastructure, 
justice, agriculture and environment) in total government spending has increased.

E. THE REGIONAL DIMENSION 

1 10. 

Improved regional cooperation is critical to Madagascar's economic prospects. As 
mentioned before, Madagascar is a member of several regional organizations including the 
African Union, the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, the Southern Afncan 
Development Community, and the Indian Ocean Commission. The World Bank Group will step 
up its assistance to enhance regional cooperation and to enable the country to profit from the 
trading opportunities in the regional markets. Through the ongoing Trade Integrated Framework 
Program and the new Diagnostic Facility for Shared Growth, IDA will continue to help the 
government harmonize its trade and economic policies with the regional frameworks. It will also 
mobilize grant funding to help build capacity in the government (effective participation in 
regional forums, stronger commercial relationships with region partners, programs to assist 
potential exporters) so that Madagascar can take fuller advantage of its participation in regional 
organizations. IDA will work closely with the European Commission which is also active in this 
area. The fact that Madagascar is now part of the country department in the Bank that also covers 
South Africa and other countries of the Southern Africa Customs Union should help facilitate 
greater regional integration. 

11 1. The Bank Group will supplement its programs outlined in this CAS with additional 
initiatives through the Africa regional program in such areas as telecommunication, trade, 
fisheries, and environment. IDMIFC support to Madagascar to participate in the East Africa 
Submarine System (EASSy) cable project through the proposed Regional Communications 
Infrastructure Program is an example of such regional initiatives (box 9). In addition, Madagascar 
is one of eight countries in the proposed regional Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Project, 
supported by the GEF, NonvaylFAO, and the French GEF, totaling about US$26 million. This 

3 ' IDA is also planning to put forward additional financing for several ongoing successful operations such as 
Mineral Resource Governance, Environment 111, Governance and Institutional Development and Private Sector 
Development if more IDA money becomes available. 

Box 9. Regional Communications Infrastructure Program 

The proposed Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP) is a World Bank Group effort in 
partnership with seven other development partners (African Development Bank (AfDB), Development 
Bank of South Africa (DBSA), French Development Agency (AFD), European Investment Bank (EIB), 
Kreditanstalt fiir Wiederaufbau (KfW), and Swedish International Development Association (SIDA)) to 
leverage investment for improving international connectivity in Eastern and Southern Africa. 
RCIP will bring together 23 countries and 30 telecommunications operators A consortium comprised of 
IFC, EIB, DBSA, AfDB, AFD and KfW will contribute private investment alongside the 
telecornmunications operators to finance the East Africa Submarine System cable, which will link Durban 
and Port Sudan and connect South Africa, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and 
land-locked African countries to the rest of the world. A programmatic engagement by IDA will finance 
roll-out of sub-regional and related national backbone linkages as well as finance pre-purchase of capacity 
for use by governments, for example by schools and universities. A first phase of support under the project 
is expected to be presented to the Bank's Board in FY07 and will include Kenya, Burundi and Madagascar. 

could be followed by a sub-regional or national fisheries project for Madagascar closer to the end 
of the CAS period. The Bank will also work closely with the regional organizations (e.g., Indian 
Ocean Commission) to improve their capacity to offer specialized technical assistance to member 
countries, including Madagascar. The mid-term review of the CAS will take stock of the progress 
made in promoting regional integration and put forward suggestions for scaling up this effort. 

F. CONSULTATION 

PROCESS 

112. The Bank team carried out extensive consultations on this CAS with the government and 
civil society. This work was done in tandem with the MAP preparation process, including a two- 
day high level workshop with essentially the entire team of government decision makers and 
donors. The World Bank Group held several rounds of consultations with representatives of civil 
society organizations (including religious groups and media) and the private sector. The objective 
of these discussions was to receive feedback on the Bank's current program and to hear views 
about the country's main challenges and priorities and what role they see for the World Bank 
Group in Madagascar. The participants identified rural development, water and sanitation, 
agriculture, roads, education, health, investment climate, and microfinance. IDA also carried out 
a web-based survey which asked several question on the Bank's program in Madagascar, 
including a question on the priority areas for the Bank future involvement. Infrastructure (roads, 
power, telecommunications), education, rural development, and good governance came at the top 
of the list. Attachment 4 describes the consultation process with civil society. 

G . ALIGNMENT AND HARMONIZATION 

1 13. The success of this strategy will depend on working closely with the government and 
other donors; Madagascar's difficult development challenges and limited resources demand a 
coordinated donor response. The main goal will be to attract scaled-up assistance to Madagascar 
while improving the effectiveness of existing resources. To date, the government has been 
moving toward a leadership role in development assistance coordination. It has asked donors to 
align their programs with the MAP and is strengthening its own capacity to coordinate donor 
assistance primarily through its efforts to lead dialogue on a common policy framework for 
budget support. External partners have established sector groups with rotating chairmanship that 

meet monthly to coordinate activities. The alignment and harmonization agenda is being 
streamlined on a pilot basis in the rural and environment sectors, with good results to date. 

1 14. Moving forward, however, much greater efforts at harmonization will be necessary to 
ensure effective implementation of the ambitious goals of the MAP. The government has asked 
IDA and the European Commission (the two largest donors in Madagascar) to assist with 
organizing a MAP Financing Conference. This conference is expected to be held in mid-2007 
and will include donors, private sector and other development partners. 

1 15. Work will continue on developing common arrangements and procedures with 
development partners, building on several existing examples. The partnership agreement signed 
by the government, AfDB, European Commission, France, and IDA outlines modalities for a 
multipartner approach to budgetary support that includes joint missions. For the Education for 
All Fast-Track Initiative, external partners are using a common results framework, financial 
management and procurement procedures. In addition, a sectorwide approach arrangement is 
operational in the transport sector, and other sectorwide approaches are under development in 
water, agriculture, and health. Finally, efforts are underway to establish sectorwide approach in 
environment that would use a harmonized monitoring and evaluation system. 

116. 
Increased attention will be paid to harmonizing the analytical work. There are already 
several examples of analytical work undertaken through partnerships. IDA completed a Country 
Financial Accountability Assessment in 2003 with the participation of the European 
Commission, the IMF, and the AfDB. In addition, the PEFA initiative is a joint undertaking by 
the government and donors. IDA and the government are conducting a programmatic Public 
Expenditure Review and have invited all other external partners to participate. As of October 
2006, external partners have posted 25 documents on the Country Analytic Work website 
(www.countryana1yticwork.net). 

117. 
It is important to note that this strategy is coordinated with the European Commission, 
which is developing its own strategy at the same time. The Bank and the European Union have 
harmonized the strategy preparation schedules, shared the diagnostics, and coordinated the 
proposed assistance programs. More information about the donor programs in Madagascar can be 
found in attachments 3a and 3b. 

IV. 

RISKS 

1 18. There are some important risks that may hamper progress in Madagascar and may affect 
the results of this strategy. A brief discussion of these risks and CAS mitigation measures 
follows. 

1 19. Macroeconomic instability. The country's macroeconomic stability can come under 
pressure from low revenue collection and overly optimistic fiscal programs. Attention to realistic 
revenue forecasting and public finance management reforms should help mitigate this risk. 

120. Shocks. As discussed, Madagascar has a high risk of external economic and natural 
shocks. Major shocks could slow economic growth, with an ensuing threat to domestic stability. 
Madagascar already has some experience on addressing the macroeconomic consequences of 
shocks, and IDA, jointly with the IMF, will continue providing advice in this area. In addition, 
the CAS' emphasis on preventive mechanisms should help minimize the consequences of natural 
shocks in the longer term. 

12 1. Political instability. Although a new political crisis is not imminent, the possibility of 
political instability should not be discarded, especially given Madagascar's history. Highly 
concentrated economic growth that does not benefit the broader population could lead to 
instability, particularly given Madagascar's growing and youthful population that presents both 
an opportunity and a looming threat. On the one hand, healthy, well educated youth could drive 
future development. On the other hand, if the economy creates too few jobs for the emerging 
generation, disappointed and disillusioned youth could become a formidable source of instability. 
The CAS strategic emphasis on employment-generating growth and improved basic service 
delivery seeks to lower these risks, but its effectiveness will depend on implementation. 

122. Governance. Lack of progress in addressing the perceived unclear delineation between 
public office and private interests, as well as high levels of corruption and red tape may block the 
badly needed investments critical to Madagascar's future prosperity and stability. The experience 
of African countries demonstrates that political and economic stability is endangered when power 
and wealth are in the hands of a privileged few. The government's demonstrated commitment to 
improving governance and the strong focus of this CAS on governance should help mitigate this 
risk. 

123. Weak implementation capacity. In low-income countries such as Madagascar there is a 
perennial risk that weak implementation capacity will slow the program. The Bank Group is 
working to mitigate this risk by strengthening the focus on capacity building at the project 
implementation level, supported by a strong team of national and international staff based in the 
country. While there has been significant success to date, the challenge will be to maintain 
standards in program implementation. 

124. Country Assistance Strategy risk. There is a risk that IDA, even with other donors, may 
not generate a level of support sufficient to help Madagascar overcome its development 
challenges. Failure to mobilize additional funds (private, donor, government revenue) may 
jeopardize the country's efforts to implement the MAP. The Bank Group will continue to work 
with the international community to attract additional resources to Madagascar. To begin, IDA 
will assist the government in organizing a MAP Financing Conference to gather support for the 
implementation of the MAP. 

Program adjustment 

125. The Bank will make adjustments in the program (i) if political instability were to 
seriously impair the capacity of the government to carry out the program, (ii) if the quality of 
governance deteriorates, or (iii) if significant implementation constraints emerge. The quality of 
governance will be tracked using the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) 
ratings, especially regarding the transparency, accountability and corruption in the public sector. 
The quality of the portfolio will be used to determine whether the government's implementation 
capacity remains adequate. If more than half of the portfolio becomes at risk, the CAS program 
will be adjusted. Examples of program adjustment may include project restructuring as well as 
shifts in the allocation between policy lending and project financing within the existing envelope. 
A special CAS Progress Report would be prepared if more serious program adjustments would 
be needed.

Attachment 3a. Donor Programs 

1. 

The main external partners are the European Commission, France, the 
International Monetary Fund, and the United States. Together with IDA, they accounted 
for approximately 86 percent of gross official development assistance to Madagascar in 
2004. The matrix in attachment 3b presents the full picture of donor involvement in 
Madagascar. 

2. 
European Commission. The European Commission has a very large program 
in Madagascar. The 9th European Development Fund, which is closing at end-2007, 
encompasses a program of 447 million euros, a substantive increase over the original 
projected 345 million euros as a result of strong performance reflected in the 2004 
midterm review. The current program concentrates on budget support (approximately 30 
percent of the total program), transport and infrastructure, rural development, food 
security and decentralization, good governance, support to nonstate actors, and the 
Education for All Fast-Track Initiative. The European Commission is currently preparing 
its strategy for the 1 oth ~ u r o ~ e a n Development Fund covering 2008-1 3; it intends to 
continue with the same focus areas. 

3 . 

European Investment Bank. In 2006, the European Investment Bank's 
portfolio covered 16 loans totaling 117.5 million euros, focused on private sector 
investment and public infrastructure, including JIRAMA. 

4. 
France. The priority sectors for 2 0 0 6 1 0 are education, rural development, 
infrastructure, health, and private sector development. In addition, three cross-sector 
themes targeted are governance, strengthening capacity for higher education and 
research, and cultural diversity. The indicative financial envelope for the five-year period 
is 249-278 million euros. 

5. 
United States. Madagascar was the first country to benefit from the U.S. 
Millennium Challenge Account in May 2005. Financial support of about $100 million is 
focused on three areas: land tenure, financial sector, including payment system and 
microfinance, and agricultural investment projects. 

6 . 
African Development Bank. In September 2005 the African Development 
Bank approved its new strategy for 2005-09, which focuses on budget support, rural 
development (especially rural infrastructure), governance and decentralization, and water 
supply and sanitation. Other sectors covered by the current portfolio include education, 
health, and HIV/AIDS. Capacity building is a cross-cutting element of the program. 

7. 
Germany. Germany supports environment and natural resource management, 
governance, and HIV/AIDS. The environment and natural resource management 
activities are integral elements of the Third Environmental Plan, collectively supported 
by IDA and other donors. The German program comprises financial support of about 
10.5 million euros and technical support of 8 million euros. 

Attachment 3a 
Page 2 of 2 

8. 
Other bilateralprograms. Switzerland and Norway are focusing on 
governance and human development issues-mainly education (Education for All) and 
health. Norway is also financing the transport sector in collaboration with other donors 
active in that sector. Japan is supporting Education for All, rural development, fisheries, 
and private sector development. And the Kuwait Fund finances small infrastructure 
investments. 

9. 
Other International Organizations. The United Nations Children's Fund, the 
United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, and the 
World Health Organization all have programs in Madagascar, although their financial 
assistance is relatively limited, except for the United Nations Children's Fund, which has 
a relatively large program.

Attachment 4: Consultations with Stakeholders 

1. 
During the CAS preparation the World Bank Group held several rounds of 
consultations with representatives of civil society organizations (including religious groups) 
and the private sector. The objective of these discussions was to receive feedback on the 
Bank's current program and to hear views about the country's main challenges and priorities 
and what role they see for the World Bank Group in Madagascar. 

2 . 

The participants identified the following areas as main priorities, in order of 
importance: 

Rural development 
Water & sanitation 
Agriculture 
Roads 
Education 
Health 
Investment climate 
Microfinance 

3. 
To achieve the above priorities, a wide range o f opinions were expressed falling under 
three broad categories: 

improving productivity: rice and sugar, land reform, markets for agricultural 
produce, access to finance (even a 2 percent monthly interest rate is unaffordable), 
investment climate and agricultural competitiveness, sustainable social protection 
strategy for the vulnerable population, quality education, improved recruitment 
policy for teachers. 

involving local communities: local communities should be empowered to 
implement and make decisions, improve effective decentralization, work within the 
country's biodiversity and prioritize, integrate faith-based organizations into 
donors' decisions making process, donors should trust the Churches more. 

improving transparency in Bank's processes: observe Bank's evaluation 

meetings, better understanding of Government's budget process for an average 
person, better information flow on Bank's projects, studies, and the Bank itself. 
Involve civil society in monitoring governance, anti-corruption and service 
delivery programs. Collaboration between the Bank and the IMF on joint 
performance criteria. 

4. 
The private sector stakeholders stressed that private sector investment faces major 
constraints, including access to finance, lengthy and costly business procedures, lack of skilled 
labor force and transparency, poor law enforcement and absence of good governance. The 
participants emphasized the importance of sustainable economic growth and sound fiscal 

Attachment 4 
Page 2 of 3 

policy as prerequisites for investment. The energy gap for the next five years and slow 
progress in decentralization constitutes h r t h e r bottlenecks to improving investment. They 
further stressed the need for secure property rights and investment in human capital 
(education). Finally, the private sector representatives felt that it made sense to focus on 
specific high growth potential sectors such as tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness and 
mining. 

5 . 

On the Bank support, the private sector representatives felt the Bank could play a role 
in promoting dialogue and consultations between public and private sectors. Support to local 
investors was also highlighted as an area for Bank intervention. 

6 . 
In the area of collaboration between the civil society and the Bank, the participants 
expressed a wish for improved communication with the Bank and increased role of civil 
society in project preparation and implementation. Monitoring was highlighted as potential 
area for greater involvement of civil society organizations. Finally, the stakeholders urged the 
Bank to invest more in training and capacity building of civil society organizations. 

7 . 

As part of consultations, IDA also carried out a web-based survey1 that included the 
following questions: 

What are the most urgent development challenges in Madagascar? 

Where do you think the World Bank can be most effective? 

How familiar are you with World Bank activities in Madagascar? 

What value does the World Bank involvement add to Government programs? 

Should Government of Madagascar borrow from the World Bank? 

8. 

The chart on the next page shows that infrastructure (roads, power, 
telecommunications), education, rural development and good governance came at the top of 
the list of priorities for the future World Bank Group involvement.

Attachment 5. Medium Term Economic Outlook 

Macroeconomic forecast 

1. 
The medium term growth prospects are optimistic. The post-2002 recovery has shown that 
the economy has diversified its sources of growth, and is more resilient to shocks, having grown at 
around 5 percent despite negative exogenous shocks. Madagascar is investing wisely in upgrading 
its infrastructure network, particularly roads, is encouraging greater public-private partnerships in 
infrastructure provision (energy, airports, ports etc), and is investing in educating its young, thereby 
solidifying further the foundations for growth. 

2. 
Baseline macroeconomic projections forecast an average growth rate of about 5.6 percent 
over 2007-1 1, assuming that the government stays the course on macroeconomic and structural 
reforms (table A).' The main sources of growth include tourism, mining, construction, and, most 
important for the poor, improved prospects in agriculture. Tourism is expected to continue to grow, 
given the ongoing investments under the Integrated Growth Poles projects, private investment in 
hotels, and the increasing number of tourists. Improving the backward linkages in the tourism 
sector, such as sourcing products from the local economy by hotels, is a key aspect in the strategy 
for the sector. In mining, the ilmenite project financed by Rio Tinto in the Fort Dauphin region is 
under way and two other large-scale mining investments are being considered. Agriculture will 
continue benefiting from investments to improve the irrigation systems and the surrounding 
watersheds in four most promising sites and from additional support for agri-business development 
in five regions in the country with support from the Millennium Challenge Corporation. At the 
same time the export processing zone sector is going through a consolidation phase and is not 
expected to grow in the short term. However, a hopeful sign that the sector can remain a source of 
growth is that textile exports have been stronger than expected because the industry is diversifying 
and moving toward higher value-added products.

1 This macroeconomic framework is based on currently identified external financing and realistic progress on 
domestic revenue mobilization. The macroeconomic scenario is explicitly designed to be realistic to avoid 
the pitfalls of over-optimism in the macro-economic framework, which in 2004-06 led to mid-year 
expenditure cuts, generated unpredictability and hampered budget execution.

Investment needed to generate this growth will average 22 percent of GDP, driven mainly 
by an increase in private investment, which is expected at 12.1 percent of GDP during 2007-1 1. 
Exports are projected to increase by 6 percent a year over the same period. Overall, investment is 
expected to be facilitated by the new investment code and the newly established Economic 
Development Board of Madagascar. Emphasis on governance through more transparent issuance of 
licenses, the creation of a fair playing field-free of political interference-and 
access to land 
should facilitate further investments in mining, tourism, manufacturing, and ago-industry. 
Continued investment in transport and irrigation infrastructure by government and donors should 
increase rural income. Tax reform is also planned for the next year, including simplifying the tax 
system and administration and raising revenues while facilitating investment. Over the medium to 
long-term these investments should contribute to a stronger and more dynamic export sector. 

4. 
The Madagascar Action Plan foresees a higher growth scenario, where growth gradually 
accelerates to 7 to 10 percent over 2007-1 1. Higher growth is driven by implementation of 
breakthrough policy initiatives, including tax and public finance reform, a green revolution, bold 
action on health and family planning, and transforming the judiciary. Higher internal revenue 
mobilization, higher levels of donor support, and an improved environment for the private sector 
are all expected to expand the resource base, leading to higher levels of investment and improved 
factor productivity, and translating into higher sustained growth. This CAS lays out a program 
based on the baseline scenario. 

Debt situation 

5 . 

Madagascar's outstanding external debt has been reduced significantly-from about 
US$4.8 billion at end-2003 to about US$1.2 billion at end-2006. Two major initiatives contributed 
to this result: the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Debt Initiative concluded in 
October 2004 and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, supported by the International Monetary 
Fund, African Development Bank, and IDA. 

6 . 
Presently, Madagascar's risk of debt distress is moderate. If Madagascar implements sound 
macroeconomic and structural policies, as the baseline assumes, the debt sustainability analysis 
undertaken in mid-2006 shows that Madagascar's external debt indicators will remain well below 
the HIPC thresholds throughout the projection period. 

7. 
But external debt indicators could deteriorate with inappropriate policies or adverse 
shocks. For instance, the recent global trade liberalization trends render exports highly vulnerable 
due to the high export share of textiles and clothing. The baseline projections assume that structural 
weakness in this sector will be somewhat offset by export increases in mining and diversification. 
The rapid response of exports to the devaluation in 2004 has shown that export supply i s highly 
elastic in Madagascar. Borrowing at nonconcessional terms as well as new borrowing beyond the 
levels assumed in the baseline scenario could also raise Madagascar's risk of debt d i ~ t r e s s . ~ The 
full analysis of the debt situation appears in attachment 6. Overall, foreign assistance is expected to 
remain important in macroeconomic management and poverty reduction in Madagascar. This 
includes assistance under the enhanced HIPC Debt Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative. 

Some reliance on debt may be unavoidable given the investment needs in sectors like energy. This points to 
the urgent need for the government to develop a strategy based on their contracting external debt on 
concessional terms, keeping internal borrowing low and fully accounting for contingent liabilities.

Attachment 6. Madagascar: Joint World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis 

Madagascar's risk of debt distress is moderate, albeit in the low range of the moderate category. 
Madagascar's external debt burden indicators under the baseline scenario remain below the 
relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds. The stress tests, however, reveal that external debt 
sustainability is sensitive to export shoclrs. The inclusion in the analysis of the small domestic debt 
does not change the assessment of country S risk of debt distress. 

A. Introduction 

1 . 

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) has been prepared jointly by IMF and World 

Bank staff. It is based on the framework for low-income countries approved by the respective 
Executive Boards. The framework takes into account indicative thresholds for debt burden 
indicators determined by the quality of the country's policies and institutions.' It comprises of a 
baseline scenario (which assumes, among others, implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative (MDRI) by the African Development Fund, IDA and the IMF) and a set of alternative 
scenarios. 

B. Recent Developments and Current Debt Situation 

Madagascar reached its completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in 

2. 
October 2004. The resulting debt relief, including additional bilateral debt relief from most Paris 
Club creditors, reduced the end-2003 net present value (NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio to an 
estimated 137 
' At that time, the ratio was projected to increase to 154 percent in 2004 
and decline thereafter. 

At end-2005, Madagascar's external public debt (including arrears) amounted to 

3. 
US$3.5 billion in nominal terms. The decline from the end-2003 level (US$4.8 billion) was due 
to debt write-offs granted by most Paris Club creditors, and has consequently been accompanied by 
a drastic change in the creditor composition. As of end-2005, bilateral and commercial creditors 
represented only 23 percent of total outstanding obligations (with Paris Club creditors accounting 
for less than 5 percent), compared to about 46 percent by end-2003. The bilateral Paris Club debt 
that remains is mainly to Russia. Conversely, the share of multilateral creditors has increased to 
more than 75 percent at end-2005 from 54 percent at end-2003.' 

1 According to the World Bank Country and Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index, Madagascar is 
rated as a medium performer. The indicative thresholds applicable for that category of countries are: (i) 150 
percent for NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, (ii) 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, (iii) 250 percent 
for the NPV of debt to fiscal revenues ratio, (iv) 20 percent for the debt service to exports ratio and (v) 30 
percent for the debt service to revenue ratio. 
Total debt relief to Madagascar under the Initiative amounts to U S 8 3 6 million in NPV terms. To date, 
Madagascar has secured about 90 percent of that amount through agreements reached with all multilateral 
and Paris-Club creditors, as well as some non-Paris Club creditors. 
Most Paris Club creditors have written-off their outstanding claims after full delivery of HIPC debt relief, 
reducing claims on Madgascar by further U S 4 6 6 million in NPV terms. 
As of end-2005, Madagascar has estimated U S 4 0 5 million in arrears towards non-Paris Club and private 
creditors that are not delivering HIPC debt relief (Algeria, Libya and Iraq are the largest). Madagascar 
continues to make efforts to contact these creditors, regularize the payments and obtain full debt relief under 
the HIPC Initiative. 
The change in creditor composition also reflects the fact that multilateral creditors deliver their share of 
HIPC debt relief primarily trough debt service reductions instead of debt write-offs.

4. 
Full delivery of debt relief 
under MDRI will significantly reduce 
Madagascar's external debt. IMF's 
debt relief under the MDRI became 
effective in January 2006 and amounts 
to US$197 million.6 MDRl debt relief 
from IDA is expected to be 
implemented starting in July 2006 
through the 100 percent reduction of the 
debt outstanding and disbursed as of 
end-2003. Total MDRI debt service 
relief from IDA is estimated at SDR1.2 
billion (equivalent to about US$1,878 
million).' As for the African 
Development Fund, debt relief under the 
MDRI will be delivered though a write- 
off of the outstanding obligations as of end-December 2004, with retroactive application to January- 
2006. Estimated MDRI debt relief from the African Development Fund amounts to US$327 
million. The implementation of MDRI by the lMF, IDA and the A h c a n Development Fund is 
expected to reduce Madagascar's outstanding debt at end-2006 by almost two thirds compared to 
end-2005.

C. Baseline Medium- and Long-Term Scenario 

5. 
The baseline scenario is built on a number of key macroeconomic assumptions, the 
implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies and external financing that 
is through grants and highly concessional loans. Key macroeconomic assumptions are indicated 
in Box 1. With respect to external financing, new borrowing is projected to remain largely at highly 
concessional terms. External assistance as a share of GDP which had climbed very rapidly to close 
to 14 percent as a share of GDP in 2004 due to large inflows of external aid and borrowing to 
finance recovery after the 2002 political crisis, will remain relatively high in the short term (close to 
8 percent on average of GDP in 2005 and 2006 based on recent information from donors) and 
gradually decrease to about 6 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. The borrowing is 
largely for financing infrastructure projects, improvements in ports and other facilities aimed at 
lowering costs and enhancing competitiveness, and to help Madagascar attain the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). 

6. 
Under the baseline scenario which includes MDRI, Madagascar's external debt 
indicators remain well below the thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure l a and 
Table la). The debt indicators drop sharply (by about 50 percent) in 2006 as result of the MDRI 
(Table la ) . The NPV of debt to GDP ratio which was at about 36 percent in 2005 (a level already 
below the threshold for moderate performers) drops to 15 percent in 2006 (Figure 1 a and Table 1 a); 
it increases subsequently to peak at 24 percent in 2016 and drops after to about 20 percent in the 
outer years. The NPV of debt-to-exports and NPV of debt-to-revenue ratios (Table 2a) exhibit a 
similar profile. The increase in these ratios in the initial years (from the low post MDRI levels) 
reflects relatively high new borrowing albeit at concessional terms to finance needed investment 
expenditures. The slow performance of the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) sector due to the textile 
shock and also the weak performance of agricultural prices for the projection period, limits the

increase in the value of exports and the improvements in the debt indicator based on exports. Given 
the highly concessional nature of the existing debt and new borrowing, the debt service ratios are 
well below the indicative thresholds throughout the projection period but show a rising trend due to 
the accumulation of new debt. 

7. 

Madagascar's total public debt ratios, including domestic debt, also stay well below 
the external debt sustainability thresholds under the base case scenario (Figure 2a and 

Table 2a). The domestic debt is projected to remain under 10 percent of GDP through the projection 
period, as primary expenditure is assumed to be broadly kept in check with available financing 
from tax revenue and external assistance, and the fiscal deficit is projected to remain predominantly 
financed by external assistance on concessional terms. 

External public debt indicators 

D. Sensitivity Analysis 

8 . 
The sensitivity analysis suggests that the external debt indicators could deteriorate 
with inappropriate policies, and/or if confronted by adverse  shock^.^ 

The debt indicators in the historical scenario (Scenario A1 in Figure 1A and Table l b 
based on the average of the years 1999-2005) follow a lower trajectory than under the base line It 
should be noted, however, that the years leading up to 2005 include years of political turmoil, large 
terms of trade shocks, cyclones and natural disasters. Given the above and the limited availability of 
data, only the last five years have been kept for the purpose of this scenario. During that period, real 
growth averaged only about 3 percent, imports and the current account deficit were also low a as 
the EPZ sector (recently put in place) was growing at very high growth rates from a very small 
base. These factors explain the relatively benign trajectory of the debt indicators under the historic 
scenario. If the years of the political crisis (decline of 12.7 percent in 2002) and the recovery from 
this (growth of 9.8% in 2003) are excluded, the average growth is significantly higher at 5 percent, 
which is much closer to the baseline scenario. 

The financing scenario (Scenario A2) reveals that Madagascar's external debt indicators 
are particularly sensitive to the terms of new borrowing. Under this scenario, the NPV of debt to 
GDP remains below the threshold but peaks at 34 percent in 2016, and remains at about that level 
through 2026. The NPV of debt to exports ratio, however, does breach the threshold and remains 
above it, stabilizing at about 155 percent in the outer years i.e. 2025 and 2026. The projected path 
of these two ratios, together with the continuous rising trend of the debt service ratio, points to the 
risks to debt sustainability from new borrowing at less favorable terms than assumed in the baseline 
scenario. 9 

The bound tests also reveal some underlying vulnerabilities. These are underscored 

under the most extreme stress tests represented by the combined exports and growth shock 
(Scenario B5) on the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, and the exports shock (Scenario B2) on the NPV 

8 The stress tests performed under the sensitivity scenario assumed permanent modifications of key 
baseline assumptions ("alternative scenarios") as well as temporary deviations ("bound tests"). The 
"alternative scenarios" include a "historical scenario", under which the main variables that determine the 
debt dynamics are assumed to remain at their historical average, and a "financing scenario" that depicts the 
impact of lower concessionality in new borrowing. The "bound tests" are designed examine the impact on 
debt and debt service indicators of shocks, based on the country's historical volatility, to key variables. 
This scenario is similar to a sharp decline in grant financing, compared to the baseline, compensated by 
loans. 

Attachment 6

of debt-to-exports ratio. The NPV of debt-to-GDP increases significantly (to 36 percent) but does 
not cross the threshold level. On the other hand, the export based indicator--the NPV of debt to 
exports, crosses the threshold and remains above the threshold throughout the period. The shock to 
exports is somewhat extreme (the standard deviation is about 35) as it is influenced by the rapid 
increase in exports in the historical period from textiles exports in the export processing zones, and 
the large decline in exports that took place during the political crises and the subsequent rapid 
recovery . The implications for vulnerability are nevertheless to be noted, as it illustrates the impact 
of shocks to certain export commodities (such as textiles) which have become large as a share of 
total exports in Madagascar (about 40 percent in 2005), as a result of exogenous factors such as the 
termination of the Agreement on textiles and Clothing (ATC) and AGOA. The risks stemming from 
the potential volatility to exports is also demonstrated by the result that the debt indicator based on 
exports would reach the threshold even if the standard deviation is reduced to a third of that in the 
above extreme bound test (i.e., to 10 as opposed to 35-Scenario ~ 7 " ) . While declines in textile 
exports (largely from the export processing zones) could in reality have offsets in terms of imports 
(which are not captured given the partial nature of the shock), the bound tests point to some real 
potential risks. 

Total public debt indicators 

9 . 

Total public debt indicators are most sensitive to economic growth shocks. A 

temporary or permanent deviation from the baseline real GDP growth path would put the total 
public debt on an unsustainable path, if spending plans were kept unchanged, which is unlikely in 
view of past experience (Table 2b, Scenarios A3 and B l ) . 

E. Debt Distress Classification and Conclusions 

10. Madagascar's risk of debt distress is moderate, albeit in the low range of that 

category. In the baseline scenario Madagascar's debt indicators are below the thresholds. The debt 
situation, however, appears vulnerable to shocks. The export based indicator reaches the threshold 
i f borrowing is undertaken at non-concessional terms. Debt sustainability also appears vulnerable if 
large export shocks materialize, which is a risk in the medium term given the expected termination 
of AGOA. 

In conclusion, the debt situation seems under control but is not exempt of risks. In that 

11. 
regard, there is a need not only for implementing the policies underpinning the baseline scenario, 
but also for careful monitoring of borrowing policies and export performance. The latter is critical 
given the concentration of exports in textiles and clothing and the termination of the ATC and 
AGOA renders exports highly vulnerable given the concentration of exports in textiles. The 
baseline projections assume that the current structural weakness in this sector will be offset by 
export increases and diversification, given a positive response to the large depreciation which has 
taken place in 2004 and from the policies put in place which would enhance competitiveness. 
Borrowing at non-concessional terms as well new borrowing beyond the levels assumed under the 
baseline could also raise Madagascar's risk of debt distress.

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions 

Real GDP growth is projected at a little under 6 percent on average, accelerating fkom 
5.5 percent in the initial years to 6 percent subsequently as the reform measures take hold. 

Inflation as measured by the GDP deflator averages about 6 percent, with higher rates 
8 percent in the initial years and decelerating to 5 percent subsequently. 

Export volumes grow a little under 6 percent on average and support GDP growth, despite a 
sharp slowdown in the initial years to about 4.5 percent due to a slowdown in textiles exports 
(impact of the shock related to the termination of the AGOA and ACTA). Subsequently 
exports accelerate to slightly above 6 percent, supported by exports of commodities related to 
mining, agro industry products, shrimps, gems and other commodities. 

Import volumes average about 6 percent for the period. Imports slow down to under 4 percent 
in the initial years due to declines in 2005 and 2006 largely in response to the winding of tax 
related effects which raised the levels of investment related imports to very high levels in 
earlier years. After this initial slowdown, imports grow at a higher pace than GDP, reflecting 
disbursements of external support for infrastructure and other projects and the associated high 
levels of investment activity. 

The current account deficit is projected to gradually decline from its high level of over 
12 percent in 2005 to about 1 1 percent by 20 1 1 and further to about 7 percent by the end of the 
projection period. 

Tax revenues are projected to increase fkom 10.1 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 
16.4 percent of GDP in 2026, owing to the termination of ad hoc tax and import duty 
exemptions and steadfast improvements in tax and custom administration. 

Non-interest expenditures are broadly kept in check with available financing fkom tax 
revenue and external assistance, resulting in a moderate increase of about 1.5 percent of GDP 
over the projection period. 

External assistance progressively unwinds from the exceptionally high level of about 
11 percent of GDP reached during the period 2004 to 2006 to about 6 percent of GDP observed 
during the late 1990s. The share of grants gradually increases from less than half in the initial 
years to more than half in the later years.

'Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. 
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the 
same as in the baseline. 
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline 
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels). 
Includes official and private transfers and FDI. 
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent. 
'Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

No country-

RemarksIExplanation 

At the project level, 100 percent financing is 
expected to be used taking into account (i) the 
Government's financing of the development 
program for the sector concerned; (ii) high 
transaction costs or anticipated delays in project 
implementation due to counterpart funding; and 
(iii) co-financing by development partners. Project 
teams will be encouraged to seek co-financing 
from other development partners in all projects. 
Cost-sharing for individual operations will be 
discussed and determined on a case-by-case basis 
at the Project Concept Note stage after 
consultations with the Government. 

The Bank will continue to monitor the aggregate 
fiscal and debt situation and its implications for 
recurrent cost financing. The Bank will take into 
account sustainability at the sector and project 
levels, including future budgetary outlays, in 
determining the Bank financing of recurrent costs 
for individual Bank projects. 
The criteria for Bank financing of local costs are 
met. Therefore, the Bank may finance local costs 
in any proportion needed in individual projects. 

Local cost financing 
Are the requirements for Bank 
financing of local expenditures 
met, namely that (i) financing 
requirements for the country's 
development program would 
exceed the public sector's own 
resources (e.g. from taxation 
and other revenues) and 
expected domestic borrowing; 
and (ii) the financing of foreign 
expenditures alone would not 
enable the Bank to assist in the 
financing of individual projects. 
Taxes and duties 
Are there any taxes and duties 
that the Bank would not 
finance? 

None 

Taxes or duties are judged to be reasonable. At the 
project level, the Bank would consider whether 
taxes constitute an excessively high share of 
project costs.

Madagascar: Country Financing Parameters 

1. 
The Country Financing Parameters for Madagascar were first established in May 
2005, and reviewed during the preparation of this CAS. The policy on expenditure 
eligibility (OPIBP 6.00) moves the focus from restrictive policy framework to an enabling 
one by creating flexibility in financing expenditures that are appropriate in the country 
context and necessary to meet the development objectives o f operations supported by Bank 
loans. Thus far the experience from the added flexibility has been positive allowing to 
address implementation issues more effectively. 

2 . 

Cost sharing. In Madagascar, government counterpart funding is not an accurate 
proxy o f the Government's commitment to its development program. The quality of the 
Government's reforms and dialogue with the donors leave little doubt of its commitment 
and ownership. Currently, the Government h n d s over half o f its overall development 
program while the donors, including the Bank, finance the remaining 45 percent. The 
Bank's portfolio performance has been satisfactory further reflecting the government's 
commitment to its development program. Hundred percent financing improves project 
implementation by (i) providing more flexibility for projects to achieve their development 
objectives; (ii) abolishing implementation delays caused by counterpart funds; and (iii) 
ensuring full payment to project service providers. The increased flexibility also reduces 
transaction costs and supports the Government's move to a programmatic budgeting. Given 
the above, Bank financing for individual operations will continue to be up to 100 percent. 

3. 
The Bank's overall financing envelope as well as allocations to individual 
operations will continue to be determined in the Country Assistance Strategy and portfolio 
implications will be carefully considered as the IDA envelope will remain unaffected. At 
the project level, 100 percent financing is expected to be used taking into account (i) the 
Government's financing of the development program for the sector concerned; (ii) high 
transaction costs or anticipated delays in project implementation due to counterpart funding; 
and (iii) co-financing by development partners. Project teams will be encouraged to seek 
co-financing from other development partners in all projects. Cost-sharing for individual 
operations will be discussed and determined on a case-by-case basis a t the Project Concept 
Note stage after consultations with the Government. 

4. 
Recurrent cost financing. Foreign financing will remain an important element for 
financing Madagascar's development program for the foreseeable future. However, with a 
prudent debt management strategy, and borrowing only on concessional terms or grant 
financing, Madagascar's debt situation is likely to remain sustainable. Bank projects are 
also integrated into the Government budget, and are therefore included in the fiscal and debt 
sustainability analysis. Madagascar has made efforts, and is continuing public finance 
reforms, to better align its investment and recurrent cost budgets. Nevertheless, in some 
sectors the level of recurrent spending is insufficient and the Bank may, as needed, finance 
recurrent costs. Likely levels of recurrent cost financing would not create undue fiscal 
burden or compromise Madagascar's ability to service its debt. This principle will be 
applied on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration impact on medium term fiscal 
sustainability as well as sustainability issues on project and sector levels, including the 
implications for future budgetary outlays. 

Attachment 7 
Page 3 of 3 

5. 
Local cost financing. The local cost financing as share of total disbursements has 
been significant: 7 1 percent, 57 percent and 70 percent of Bank financing in FY02, FY03 
and FY04 respectively was local expenditure. In Madagascar, the financing requirements 
for the country's development program exceed the Government's capacity to raise 
resources through taxation and domestic borrowing. Based on the latest IMF estimates, the 
total expenditures for Madagascar's development program in 2005 were estimated a t 2 145.5 
billion Ariary, of which 1102.7 billion Ariary (or 5 1 percent) was financed by tax and non- 
tax revenues, and the remainder largely through external project grants and concessional 
loans. Financing of foreign expenditure alone would not be sufficient to enable the Bank to 
finance individual projects. Furthermore, the Bank and the Government encourage the use 
of local contractors as this creates employment opportunities and builds local capacity. In 
view of the above, Madagascar meets the two criteria for local cost financing. Therefore, 
the Bank may finance local and foreign cost in any proportion needed in individual projects. 

6 . 
Taxes and duties. There are no taxes and duties that are considered as 
unreasonable or discriminatory and there is no discriminatory adverse treatment of Bank- 
financed projects. The Madagascar tax system is dominated by low distortion taxes such as 
the VATIretail taxes (which formed 40 percent of the taxes in 2005), and personal income 
taxes (1 9 percent). Property taxes are low (1.2 percent), and continued trade liberalization 
has reduced the share of trade taxes to around 27 percent in 2005. In 2006, the tariff 
structure included 3 non-zero tariff bands (5, 1 0 , 2 0 percent) a reduction from 4 bands 
ranging from 5 to 25 percent in 2004. The VAT has been reduced from 20 percent to 18 
percent. In line with continued simplification, in 2005, the customs and import taxes were 
merged into a single tax. The personal income tax brackets range fiom 0 to 30 percent. 
Taxes on profits for enterprises are 30 percent. The Bank may finance all taxes and duties 
associated with project expenditures. At the project-level, the Bank would consider whether 
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share of project cost.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The Madagascar Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) reviews the 
implementation experience and the overall effectiveness of the Country Assistance Strategy which 
covered the FY04-06 period. The conclusions of this report are based on: 

A critical review of the Bank's previous CAS to determine the Bank's strategic objectives and 
their link to the country's PRSP. 
A series of meetings with project teams in the Bank and in government. 
An analysis of portfolio performance, the annual Country Program Reviews and the Region's 
overall portfolio monitoring reviews. 
Feedback and analysis from government, donors, stakeholders and other development 
partners to ensure a broader assessment of the Bank's program. 
Finally, the CASCR draws from the Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG) Country 
Assistance Evaluation (CAE) report, which was discussed by the Committee on Development 
Effectiveness in October 2 0 0 6 . ~ 

11. MADAGASCAR CONTEXT AND CAS OBJECTIVES 

A. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 

2. 
The 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlined three key priorities (i) 
improving governance; (ii) promoting broad-based growth; and (iii) providing human and material 
security. The first PRSP priority of improving governance aimed to create an institutional framework 
for good governance to foster fast and sustainable development and allow the State to assume its role 
as the facilitator and driving force of the economy. The main activities under this pillar included anti- 
corruption, democracy, the rule of law and decentralization. The second PRSP priority sought to 
foster macroeconomic stability and broad-based growth through revitalizing the private sector and 
promoting the development of new growth sectors. The main focus was on improving the road 
network with the goal of fighting rural poverty through connecting farmers to markets. The third 
PRSP priority focused on the social welfare system encompassing food security, health, education, 
nutrition, housing and the environment. 

The CAE report covers a ten-year time period (1995-2005) and its conclusions are thus different from this CASCR which 
covers a three-year period (2003-2006).

B. Political context 

3. 
The FY04-06 CAS was elaborated as the country just had emerged from a deep political and 
economic crisis in 2002. The new government of President Marc Ravalomanana embarked on 
reforms that marked a break with the past. The willingness and commitment of the new government to 
change and to act quickly brought hope that Madagascar was finally moving to a new chapter in its 
development. Donors responded enthusiastically to these political developments, expecting real 
changes. 

4. 
During CAS implementation, the political scene was quiet, with the exception of some 
cabinet reshuffles. The main constraints to the implementation of the reform agenda came from the 
shortage of qualified personnel in public office and silent foot-dragging from vested interests. 
Because past attempts at reform had proven short-lived, the bureaucracy and the general public were 
initially skeptical of the likelihood of successful reform. These complications slowed down the reform 
drive and tempered the initial optimism. President Ravalomanana was re-elected in December 2006, 
in what international observers have considered to be fair elections. 

C. The Millennium Development Goals 

5 . 
The PRSP objectives were consistent with the MDG targets. However, due to hardly any 
progress made towards the MDGs from 1990 to 2002, the prospects of reaching the MDGs looked 
daunting. In 2003, Madagascar was among the poorest countries in the world with a national per 
capita income at around US$240 and approximately 80 percent (2002) of the population classified as 
poor. Seventy percent of the rural population could not afford to buy a basic food basket even if they 
spent all their income on food; almost half the population of children under five was stunted. Only 
about one third of children completed primary school and just over half the population could read and 
write. Electricity connectivity was extremely low at 15 percent. Madagascar ranked 149 out of 175 
on the UNDP's Human Development Index. See Annex 2 for an update on the MDGs. 

D. CAS objectives 

6. 
The main objective of the FY04-06 CAS was to support the implementation of the PRSP's 
three key priorities (i) improving governance; (ii) promoting broad-based growth; and (iii) providing 
human security. The CAS laid out five guiding principles for the strategy: 

(i) 

(ii) 

focusing Bank interventions on having a much larger impact on rural poverty through support 
to agricultural diversification and intensification, as well as rural infrastructure; 
tackling governance and capacity building centrally and in all the Bank's operations through a 
specific governance and institutional development project, as well as through specific targeted 
improvements to all on-going and planned lending operations; 
(iii) continuing to place the environment at the center of the strategy by building on the positive 
linkages between poverty reduction and environmental management through the envisaged 
Environment Project as well as through special attention to environmental safeguards in all 
Bank projects; 
transitioning to programmatic lending with a focus on education, nutrition, health and water; 
and 
linking loan amounts to performance and continuing to reduce the number of active lending 
operations by FY06. The goal was to have just 14 active lending projects, the loan amounts 
and scope of which could be adjusted in line with performance. 
The existing portfolio at the time of the CAS was re-oriented to better support the PRSP.

E. CAS results framework 

7. 
The FY04-06 CAS was a well-prepared strategy but, as was the case with most Country 
Assistance Strategies at that time, i t was not a results-based CAS. Nevertheless, the CAS developed a 
detailed policy matrix that outlined (a) the main objectives of the PRSP; (b) the PRSP's key policy 
actions and programs that were specifically supported by the Bank; and (c) the timing and intended 
outcome of these actions and programs. Furthermore, it distinguished itself from the previous CAS 
through its stronger emphasis on achieving country-wide rather than project specific outcomes. At the 
strategic level, the Bank selected a few key PRSP monitoring indicators to evaluate the success of the 
CAS implementation. Section IV of this report evaluates progress on the policy matrix and these 
indicators. Annex 4 also provides details. 

111. MADAGASCAR'S PROGRESS TOWARDS ITS GOALS 

A. Economic progress during CAS implementation 

8. 
Growth: During the CAS period, good macro-economic management created a solid basis for 
economic growth of around 5 percent p.a. despite significant exogenous shocks from high oil prices, 
collapse of the electricity supply, and two cyclones in 2004. Growth came largely through improved 
performance in agriculture, especially higher rice production, htgher tourism receipts, and a higher 
level of public investments. However, the textile sector stagnated with the phasing out of the Most 
Favored Nation (MFN) status agreement. 

9. 
Rural development: Following the 2004 rice crisis, the rice market stabilized after the 
government removed a 10 percent tariff on imports. Since then, production has increased steadily (an 
estimated 13 percent growth in 2005 according to official figures), and Madagascar i s close to 
becoming a net rice exporter. Rice productivity increased from 2.3 tonshectare in 2003 to 2.4 
tonshectare in 2004, and is now officially at 2.57 tonshectare (surpassing the CAS target of 2.4 
tonshectare). 

10. 
Impact on poverty reduction: The 2004/05 household survey shows a decline in poverty 
from 80 percent in 2002 (estimated at the peak of the crisis) to 68.7 percent in 2005, slightly lower 
than the level of 2001 (69.7 percent). The decline in rural poverty from 77.2 percent in 2001 to 73.5 
percent in 2005 is impressive, as is the decline in the intensity of poverty in rural areas, which went 
from an estimated 53 percent in 2002 to 34.8 percent in 2005, below the level in 2001 (39.7 percent.) 
Various factors appear to have contributed to the reduction of rural poverty: (a) the increase in 
agricultural productivity through improved rice cultivation practices; (b) better roads that improved 
linkages to markets; and (c) public programs in the rural areas. 

1 1. 
Governance: Today Madagascar ranks well amongst its peers on the quality of its 
governance. Transparency International ranked Madagascar 84 out of 163 countries in 2006. 
Madagascar out-performs a host of Afiican countries often referred to as best performers-it 
ranks 
higher than Tanzania (93), Mali (99), Mozambique (99), and Uganda (105). A broad effort to improve 
governance contributed to achieving these results. The government embarked on a multifaceted 
strategy that covered public expenditure management, fight against corruption, de-regulation, and 
improved service delivery. The implementation proceeded at a pace slower than anticipated, but still 
the efforts generated substantive results. 

Attachment 8 
Page 4 of 3 3 

12. 
Infrastructure: Since 2003, nearly 2,000 km of national roads have been improved, 
increasing the percentage of the national road network in fair and good condition from 49 percent in 
2003 to 61 percent in 2005. The percentage of the rural population with reliable access to transport 
has increased from 45 percent in 2003 to 57 percent in 2005. In 2004 and 2005, the Road 
Maintenance Fund contracted for the maintenance of 6,800km and 7,000km respectively. In addition, 
the government initiated an institutional overhaul of the Ministry of Transportation and its executing 
agencies to assure permanent attention to the maintenance of road infrastructure. 

13. 
Investment. Traditionally the level of investment in Madagascar has been quite low at 11.4 
percent of GDP on average between 1970 and 2003. During this CAS period investment has increased 
to 22.5 percent in 2005, driven by public and private investment and by increasing foreign direct 
investment, which as a percentage of GDP increased from 0.2 percent in 2002 to 1.7 percent in 2005. 
It must be noted, however, that there have been a number of firm closures and the free zone 
(garments) sector is still going through a period of adjustment in the face of increased competition 
from Asian exporters in the post-MFA environment. However, there is quiet optimism amongst the 
garment industry that prospects to consolidate and grow in Madagascar are amongst the best in sub 
Saharan Africa taking advantage of established market linkages and a skilled labor force. With the 
launching of the QMM mining investment in Fort Dauphin, the prospects for growth of the mining 
sector are promising and there is considerable interest from new investors. 

B. Progress on social sectors and MDGs 

14. 
Annex 2 compares the MDGs at the time of CAS preparation and their estimated status today. 
While the analysis is not comprehensive due to lack of updated data, it shows that Madagascar is 
progressing towards the MDGs -particularly in education and nutrition. Progress on the health- 
related MDGs is also encouraging. Nevertheless, Madagascar is unlikely to reach most of the MDGs 
even if this trend continues. A scaled-up and more intensive effort will be needed to consolidate and 
build on the gains achieved to date. 

15. 
Health and nutrition services: The 2005 Demographic and Health Survey provides broad 
evidence of Madagascar's success in improving many health indicators. Immunization rates improved 
from 62 percent in 2002 to 87 percent in 2005. Infanuchild mortality has decreased from 164 per 
thousand in 1997 to 123 in 2004. A well-designed malnutrition program has helped reduce chronic 
malnutrition from 43 percent in 1997 to 35 percent in 2004105. Policies favoring the empowerment of 
women have shown positive changes in reproductive health behaviors leading to good progress to 
lower fertility. Recent data (Demographic and Health Survey, 2005) shows for instance that 
contraceptive prevalence rate for modem methods has increased from 9.7 percent (1997) to 18.3 
percent in 2004. The gap in the use of contraceptives between the capital and rural areas has been 
reduced by half. The rate of antenatal consultation for pregnant women has increased from 63 percent 
in 200 1 to 80 percent in 2004 and approximately half of the births (5 1 percent) have been attended by 
skilled staff. 

, 

16. 
Education: Since the government's declaration on free and compulsory primary education in 
2002, the net enrollment rate has increased significantly from 70 percent in 2002 to more than 90 
percent in 2005 and the completion rates increased from about 40 percent to 60 percent.5 Such 
successes contributed to donors' agreement to mobilize additional funds for Madagascar from the 

Still, repetition and drop out rates remain high (around 30 percent), teaching and learning conditions are still problematic, 
with an average ratio of 60 students per teacher, and even higher ratios in remote areas.

Education for All Fast Track Initiative in July 2005. In general, there is no major gender disparity in 
terms of access to education. 

17. 
HIVIAIDS: Thanks to the government's commitment to the fight against HN /A IDS 
Madagascar has been able to keep the threat at bay (HIV prevalence rate is below one percent). 
Awareness of the disease and knowledge of ways of avoiding infection has increased, and significant 
institutional gains have been made. The multi-sectoral HIVJAIDS Secretariat created within the 
President's office is fully operational. Implementation of the national strategy is progressing well and 
harmonization among bilateral and multilateral partners has been strengthened. Collaboration with 
numerous NGOs, community-based organizations and Faith-Based Organizations has also improved. 
The national monitoring and evaluation system is being strengthened. 

IV. HOW THE CAS CONTRIBUTED TO MADAGASCAR'S GOALS 

18. 
The FY04-06 CAS was closely aligned with the PRSP and supported effectively the 
implementation of the PRSP priorities. The CAS developed a detailed policy matrix that linked the 
PRSP's objectives with the Bank's program and also included monitoring indicators with the baseline 
values and the expected targets for the end of the CAS period. A review of the PRSP and CAS Policy 
Matrix below shows that the expected outcomes for 2006 have, been achieved for the most part. 
Annex 4 provides a comprehensive update on the monitoring indicators, as well as an assessment of 
performance and lessons learnt.

(0 Improving Governance 

19. 
The IDA strategy to improve governance in Madagascar was broad and ambitious, reflecting 
the aspirations of the authorities and the expectations of the international community. The 
government program evolved into a comprehensive strategy emphasizing the rule of law, ethical 
standards, anti-conuption and transparency and accountability of government actions. Bank assistance 
focused on both developing the legal and regulatory frameworks and its implementation. IDA'S 
assistance focused primarily on anti-conuption, improving public expenditure management, 
developing leadership in government and removing targeted capacity constraints. In the second part of 
the CAS period, the Bank's assistance also focused on customs, taxation and decentralization. 

20. 
The PRSC series and the Governance and Institutional Development Project (PGDI) provided 
support in the area of governance. These interventions were complemented by a broad range of 
analytical work, including: Public Expenditure Review (FY05), H P C tracking (FY03, FY04) and 
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (FY05). 

21. Most progress has been made in developing and approving required regulatory frameworks. 
In the area of public expenditure management IDA, jointly with other donors, has supported the 
implementation of a comprehensive reform program, which included actions to improve budget 
preparation, budget execution, and internal and external controls. A recently concluded PEFA took 
stock of the status of public expenditure management practices. Out of 28 chapters, the PEFA 
assigned three As and six Bs. During the CAS period, the government set a legal and institutional 
basis for a modem public expenditure system. Procurement legislation is in place and a Procurement 
Oversight Authority was created. Madagascar's budget is comprehensive, with very limited off- 
budget items, and incorporates a very large percentage of donor activities. The budget is prepared in 
consultation with the spending ministries although more efforts are needed to improve quality and 
timeliness of the consultation process. Partial progress has been made in aligning the budget 
allocations with national priorities, but it still remains to be fully aligned to national and sector 
priorities. On budget execution, integrated financial management has been put in place in the six main 
treasuries and basic budgetary procedures have been streamlined. Control over budget execution, and 
transparency are the weakest links. Lastly, the central government continues to control most of the 
public resources; only 3 to 4 percent of the national budget is managed by the communes. 

22. 
Several factors slowed down the pace of public expenditure management improvement: (a) 
the introduction of sophisticated budgeting procedures (program budgeting) in mid-course and at an 
accelerated pace6; (b) the initial lack of technical skills in key ministries; and (c) conflicting advice 
provided by donors. To harmonize donor support, annual Action Plans (2004,2005,2006), with the 
agreement of all stakeholders, now guide the public expenditure agenda. The pace of improving 
public expenditure management has to pick up in order not to curtail the ability of the international 
community to support Madagascar through budget support and, likewise, the ability to scale up 
successful pilot interventions by using domestic and/or international resources. 

23. 
Efforts to increase the relative levels of customs and tax collection did not prove sustainable; 
in fact, the share of tax revenues in GDP declined from 10.9 percent in 2004 to 10.1 percent in 2005. 
The persistent problems in revenue mobilization have hampered the government's ability to 
implement its ambitious Poverty Reduction Strategy, with mid-year expenditure cuts necessary to 
maintain overall fiscal discipline. These developments complicated the transfer of social programs to

In 2005 Madagascar introduced a program budget framework which intends to project public expenditures over the 
medium term and to link all expenditures to specific activities and outcomes.

the budget as intended in the CAS. Towards the end of the CAS period, IDA and other donors have 
assisted the authorities in the development of detailed action plans to improve performance in customs 
and taxes. More accurate revenue forecasts should help improve budget implementation. 

24. 
To fight corruption the government developed a modem legislative framework, in particular 
it passed an anti-corruption umbrella legislation and an anti-money laundering law, instituted 
regulations for the declaration of assets of public officials, and put in place decrees to regulate 
transparent recruitment and promotion of the public sector. IDA supported the development and 
implementation of this framework. A key development included the establishment of the Independent 
Anti-Corruption Bureau (BIANCO) in 2004. Implementation of the new anti-corruption program has 
commenced-focused on the examination of corruption complaints (roughly 7,500 in 2005.) At the 
same time the National Integrity Committee continued to review and strengthen the regulatory and 
administrative framework for the fight against corruption by streamlining legal proceeding and by 
preparing to increase transparency and accountability. Corruption does not rank as high on surveys as 
it had in the past; however, several areas of high concern remain: customs, taxes, natural resource 
management and the judiciary. IDA reduced its support to reforming the judiciary as the EU has 
taken the lead in this area. Overall, the work on reforming the judiciary is just beginning. The efforts 
in reforming customs have been perhaps the most notable. 

25. 
IDA also supported efforts to improve the capacity of government to design and implement 
policy. Two efforts stand out. First, IDA provided leadership training for senior management within 
government aimed at strengthening consistency and cohesion of the core government team. With the 
support of the Bank's PGDI project, the government has set up a National Leadership Institute to 
provide high quality training for h t u r e managers in the public and private sectors. Second, IDA has 
focused its assistance on strengthening the capacity in key ministries such as finance, education, 
health, transport and the environment, with emphasis to ensure adequate application pf the new public 
finance regulations. The objective has been to address existing bottlenecks in policy planning and 
implementation. The assistance to capacity building contributed to preparation of the development 
strategy (the MAP). 

26. With hindsight, IDA support for the governance agenda can be considered satisfactory, even 
if was ambitious and dispersed. Given that improving governance is a long-term undertalung and 
success in all areas cannot be expected in the short time-frame of the FY04-06 CAS. The assessment 
of this CASCR is similar to that of the CAE which recognized that significant efforts at improving 
governance have been launched by the government and are being supported by the Bank but that the 
results in great part are still to come. Future efforts should acknowledge far more explicitly the 
technical limitations, seek more forceh l ly the political commitments to reform, and prioritize 
engagements to guarantee achievement of concrete results that help the reform process move forward. 

(ii) Promoting broad-based growth 

27. 
As noted above, the rebound of the economy after the 2002 crisis met the expectations set in 
the CAS, despite natural and economic shocks. Economic growth contributed to reducing poverty, 
notably in rural areas. Both existing and emerging lines of economic activity-tourism, mining and 
non-traditional expo r t scon t r ibu ted to growth. Also, there is increasing awareness of the need for 
improving the capacity of the government to handle the periodic shocks that affect Madagascar. IDA 

A t tachmen t 8 
P a g e 9of 3 3 

has supported the authorities to set the basis for sustained growth through a wide range of 
interventions: policy and investment lending, analytical work, as well as debt relief.' 

28. 
IDA supported investment and institutional reform in transportation through three 
operations, with one of them completed. Organizational changes in the Ministry of Transportation 
introduced by the government in 2003 and problems encountered in the operation of the project 
implementation unit slowed down the ability of IDA to support the transportation sector in the early 
stages of the CAS period. Despite these early difficulties, the accomplishments during the current 
CAS period have been considerable. First, IDA supported an institutional rehrbishing of the state 
agencies responsible for transportation including the Ministry and the creation of the road agency and 
transport agency.' Second, IDA supported the government in bringing the private sector to 
infrastructure (railways, ports), thus showing that public-private partnerships can help the country in 
managing and building needed infrastructure. Madagascar's progress in public-private partnerships is 
remarkable in the A h c a n c ~ n t e x t . ~ WBI provided technical assistance to build government capacity 
to negotiate and manage publiclprivate partnerships. Third, IDA operations have directly contributed 
to the repair of part of the road network, especially in rural areas. The coordination between IDA and 
the EU, the main donor in the road sector, has been effective (see Section V.E.). 

29. 
IDA'S support has brought results in improving the business environment. For instance, the 
registration of enterprises is far easier now. A one-stop shop for enterprise creation - GUIDE - was 
established and within a year the number of days to open a business decreased from 60 days to about 
20 days. The IEG CAE recognized that the Bank support has been of critical importance in helping to 
improve the investment climate and support growth in some export-oriented sectors. Despite these 
improvements, as revealed by surveys, many factors still constrain economic activity: dealing with 
customs and the tax authorities, access to land (especially, for foreign investors), and a weak 
judiciary. For these reasons, Madagascar continues to rank low overall in the Cost of Doing Business 
database-1 3 1 out of 155 for the 2007 report.'' 

30. 
IDA has supported the reform of the energy sector for some time now without significant 
success." The poor administrative and financial practices in JIRAMA, the electricity and water state- 
owned utility, have contributed to the poor quality and reliability of the electricity supply and the 

' After having reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative Completion Point in October 2004, Madagascar is now 
benefiting from the G8 Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), with significant debt relief and improved prospects to 
maintain sustainable debt levels in the medium term. 
Marked progress has been made in setting up the autonomous sub-sector agencies. The Ports, Maritime, and River Agency 
has been operational since October 2004. The Civil Aviation Agency, which has been operational since 2000, has been 
restructured based on an organizational audit, to be more efficient and to enhance the capacity of the technical personnel. 
Laws creating the Roads Authority and the Land Transport Agency were voted by the Parliament during 2005 but were not 
ratified during the CAS period. Lastly on the institutional front, two separate ministries were created: the Ministry of Public 
Works and Transport and the Ministry o f Decentralization and Regional Planning. This reorganization has provided a better 
focus for transport sector policy and planning. 
Air Madagascar is operating under a management contract and is performing well and thus the privatization of the 
company can now be considered. The concession of the airports is under way. The Northern Railway was concessioned in 
2002 to Madarail. Government, in agreement with the donors, has decided to delay the concession of the Southern Railway 
because the tender d id not result in an acceptable offer. It will be under management contract with Madarail for the next two 
years at which time a new tender will be issued. The main port of Toarnasina, which handles more that 80 percent of the 
country's total traffic, has been restructured,: its container terminal was concessioned and is now operated by the Pilipino 
company MICTSL. The operations of the secondary ports TulCar, Mahajanga, and An ts iranandNosy BelAnkify will be 
concessioned soon. 
' O The privatization o f the telecommunications company TELMA in 2004 has led to significant improvements in 
communications coverage and has reduced costs by about 30 percent in 2005. 
11 Some of this work was supported by the Private Sector Development Project 11. 

Attachment 8

limited nationwide coverage. Some progress had been made by the end of the CAS period. JIRAMA 
presented a financial recovery plan in January 2006 and implemented two tariff increases for 
electricity. The government turned over the management of JIRAMA to a private operator, and is 
committed, after the contract ends in April 2007, to a longer-term public-private partnership solution 
(e.g. a concession or affermage) for JIRAMA. The IFC and the Bank have been actively advising the 
government on these matters and are preparing options for future assistance, which will include 
emphasis on reducing the dependence on diesel generated electricity by relying more on hydro-power. 

3 1. 
The joint IDA-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) showed that the bank ing 
system is generally adequately capitalized, highly profitable and liquid, with low-risk short-term 
assets. Stress tests suggest that the banks are relatively resistant to market risks, and most of them 
could withstand substantial shocks in exchange or interest rates. However, the financial system could 
be vulnerable to sector- or economy-wide downturns (e.g. from periodic cyclones, changes in world 
prices for Madagascar's exports, or changes in international trade arrangements), On the other hand, 
small and medium enterprises have only limited access to finance; with access virtually non-existent 
in rural areas. To remedy this, donors are supporting the development of the micro-finance sector. 
IDA'S pilot operation in micro-credit has exceeded expectations. The IFC is also catering to the 
financial sector, in some areas in collaboration with the IDA-supported Growth Poles Project. Overall, 
observers point to the positive progress in the micro-credit sector in Madagascar; however, the efforts 
are at an incipient stage and at a level below the country's needs. 

32. 

In agr icu l ture a n d r u r a l development, rice productivity increased faster than foreseen by 
the CAS (see Table 1). However, direct IDA lending for rural development was dispersed and lacked 
an integrative framework. The rural development support project (close to completion) provided 
investment grants to increase incomes and reduce poverty in rural areas. The micro-credit pilot 
project created a good institutional framework and improved access to financing in the rural areas it 
serviced. Rural roads, funding of local projects through the Bank-supported Community Development 
Project and other interventions had an impact on the rural sector. The lessons from an evaluation of 
the impact of the Community Development Project is underway and should allow improved 
integration of the work on community driven development, transportation (especially rural roads) and 
rural development to generate synergies and break the isolation of the rural areas. 

33. 
To support increases in rice productivity, IDA prepared a Watershed and Irrigation project 
(that was approved just after the CAS period, in 4 2 of FY07) which covers the chain from 
infrastructure maintenance to production and distribution for markets. It also emphasizes the need for 
diversification beyond rice. How best to assist the country in the development of the rural sector 
continues to be a challenge for the authorities, IDA, and the donor community. The recent CAE 
highlights the need to support rural development in order to reduce poverty. 

34. 

IDA has supported the effort of the authorities and the country to manage and protect its 
precious n a t u r a l resources. IDA was quite successful in meeting the targets set in the CAS (re- 
forestation, protected areas, etc.) and good progress was made on improving natural resource 
management. Support was provided through the Third Environment Support Program. Also, IDA has 
assisted the country in carrying out new mining activities in a sustainable way through the Mineral 
Resources Governance Project under implementation. 

35. 
To build synergies across interventions, the IDA Growth Poles Project (FY06) supports a 
wide-range of inter-connected activities (infrastructure such as ports and roads, business regulation, 
labor practices, training, etc.) around three growth poles in the country. This operation only began 
implementation late in 2005 and the full results will accrue during the next CAS. Economic and 

Attachment 8 
Page I 1 of 33 

sector work related to growth has been limited relative to other pillars.1z The forthcoming Country 
Economic Memorandum will seek to cover this gap. 

(iii) Providing human and material security 

36. 
The IDA program has contributed directly to the positive progress in the social sectors 
discussed earlier (see Table 1 and Annex 4). IDA assigned a high priority to improving the overall 
service delivery capacity in the social sectors through the PRSCs, the Governance and Institutional 
Development Project, the Health and Nutrition investment projects and the AAA program, in the 
context of the public expend i ture reform . As a result, pro-poor expenditures increased, especially in 
education and some in health. Since 2001, traclung surveys indicate that the execution rates have 
been high (99 percent for 2003) and that one in two beneficiaries report to be satisfied with the 
services delivered. Geographical distribution of expenditures, however, still shows a strong urban 
bias. 

37. 
The Bank supported institutional reforms in primary education, building on the lessons 
learned from previous operations, such as the Education Sector Development Project (which closed at 
the end of March 2005.) This support contributed to the development of a coherent strategy for the 
Education for All initiative. The development of this strategy paved the way for the SWAP in the 
education sector adopted through the Fast-Track Initiative and Education for All Catalytic Fund. 
Education for All has been the main contributor to reaching over 90 percent of effective primary 
enrollment. Completion rates, however, hover around 60 percent, and progress in the quality of 
education has been slow. The elaboration of a post-primary education strategy is also advancing and 
should be completed in FYO8. 

38. 
In the hea l th sector, as noted, indicators improved, despite the challenges of inefficient and 
unequal service delivery (also highlighted in the CAE). The Bank's Second Health Sector Support 
Project supported reform of the institutional delivery mechanism, but progress has been slow. The 
health sector's transition toward direct budget support through the PRSCs has been more difficult than 
anticipated13. Budget execution, while improving, is still low compared to other sectors, and the 
planning and budget management functions must be further strengthened at all levels of the health 
system administration. Bank's analytical work (a results-based health policy, national health accounts 
study, equity and efficiency of public health facilities studies) to identify bottlenecks in budget 
execution, and monitoring and evaluation provided recommendations to help reform budget 
management. The results of this analytical work are incorporated in the design of the forthcoming 
health sector SWAp. 

39. 
The Bank also supported efforts at malaria prevention and control with positive results. IDA 
has been b d i n g indoor spray ing on the highlands with insecticides other than DDT and targeted 
distribution of 3.9 million bed-nets financed by the Global Fund. The Tuberculosis control program 
continues to ensure adequate supplies of drugs. The successful implementation of a pilot rural water 
supply program also had a positive impact on the health outcomes by improving access to safe potable 
water.14 

40. 
Results on nu tr i t ion have been truly commendable, setting Madagascar apart from many 
other countries. If this trend continues, Madagascar will achieve the nutrition MDG. At the national 

I Z Development Policy Review (FYO5);Export Processing Zone Report (FY03); Tourism Sector Study (FY03) 
l 3 IDA approved a supplemental credit o f $ 1 8 million in FY05. 

l 4 The African Development Bank is supporting the water sector in the southern part of the country.

level, underweight rates went from 43 percent to 35 percent between 1997 and 2005. The PRSC and 
the Second Community Nutrition Project (which received a supplemental credit of $10 million in 
FY05) were the main instruments of IDA support. The latter supported improvements in the 
nutritional status of children under three, primary school children and pregnant and lactating women 
in the target areas. The impact evaluation reveals that malnutrition rates have been reduced by 10 
percentage points in the areas where the project has been implemented for 2 years. Nutrition activities 
have been gradually migrating to the general budget with mixed results to date, despite the support of 
the PRSCs. It took over two years to create a functioning institutional setting and reach an acceptable 
level of budget implementation. This necessitated the provision of the IDA supplemental credit to the 
project to ensure continued financing until such time as satisfactory budget implementation was in 
place. 

The government allotted a high priority to fighting HIVIAIDS . Prevalence rates have 
41. 
remained low at the national level but have reached a critical threshold in some regions, which require 
special vigilance. Consciousness-raising through mass media communication and through local 
response activities is considered to be quite successful. The Bank supported the government through 
the Multi-Sectoral HIVIAIDS Project which concentrated on hot spots areas and aimed to scale up the 
national response to both HNIAIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The latter is a key 
risk factor and contributor to the spread of HNIAIDS. 

42. 
The Commun i ty Development Project, (US$110 million FYO1) funded the Fonds 
d 'Intervention pour le Dhelopprnent (FID), an executing agency created in 1993. During the CAS, 
FID supported local development on a large scale through funding community sub-projects such as 
schools, health facilities, feeder roads, potable water schemes, small scale irrigation, markets, etc. 
Also, FID has been the main instrument for responding to natural shocks. In 2004105, the Bank 
provided US$50 million in supplemental financing to the project to cover the additional costs for 
emergency work to rehabilitate/reconstruct infrastructure that was destroyed during the cyclones. 
While it is clear that the FID is having an impact at the local level, there are concerns about the 
sustainability of its activities without IDA, especially given the highly centralized public finance 
system. 

V. BANK PERFORMANCE DURING THE CAS PERIOD 

A. Lend ing volume, ins trumen ts a n d scenarios 

43. 
Nearly all the projects envisioned at the time of the CAS were delivered in the period 
reviewed for this CASCR . '~ The modifications to the program were the following: (i) the Watershed 
and Irrigation Project was originally planned for FY06 but was approved in the second quarter of 
FY07; (ii) supplemental credits were provided in FY05 to the Health Sector Project (US$] 8 million), 
the Nutrition Project (US$10 million) and the Community Development Project (US$5O million); (iii) 
support to education was mainly channeled through the Education For All Initiative which began in 
2004 but which was not foreseen at the time of the CAS; and (iv) the Integrated Growth Poles project 
was delivered in early FY06 instead of FY05. 

44. 

As shown in the table below and in Annex 1, the CAS proposed US$505 million in the Base 
Case and US$650 million in the High Case. The triggers for the high case were met (see Table 2) 
which was the main driving factor ensuring increased availability of resources for Madagascar. 

" Annex I (a) presents the planned lending program and actual delivery (FY04-06) 

- 84 - 

Attachment 8 
Page 13 of 33 

Moreover, the amount lent (US$663 million) exceeded the amount for the high case due to important 
changes that took place during the CAS implementation period. First, sharp improvements in the 
CPIA ratings led to significant top ups at the beginning of the CAS period under IDA 13 (impacting 
FY04 and FY05). Second, the resources available to Madagascar from IDA 14, although smaller than 
in IDA 13, were front-loaded heavily in FY06.

As of June 2006, the Bank's portfolio consisted of 14 IDA projects and one GEF project with 
total commitments of US$906 million. Of that, a total of US$463 million remained undisbursed. A 
summary of the portfolio indicators is provided in Annex 3. These portfolio indicators show that the 
portfolio by-and-large performed well although there were some problem projects at various points in 
time. Throughout the CAS period, however, an important achievement of the portfolio was that it 
continued to disburse strongly with the disbursement ratio averaging about 3 3 percent. Total 
disbursements to Madagascar were also very high as shown in the table below.

In 2005, the Quality Assurance Group selected Madagascar as one of the countries for a 
Portfolio Improvement Program due to the fact that the performance of the portfolio had deteriorated 
from 2004. In addition, there was one case of misprocurement in FY06 which was appropriately 
addressed. Since then, the efforts to improve the quality of the portfolio have yielded positive results: 
(i) the number of problem projects was reduced to one at the end of the CAS period; (ii) the 
percentage of problemlpotential problem projects was reduced from 28 percent to 7 percent; (iii) the 
amount of commitments at risk was reduced from US$3 19 million to US$90 million (40 percent to 10 
percent); and (iv) the disbursement ratio continued to be high at 33 percent. The restructuring of two 
Transport Sector APLs in late-2005learly-2006 was key to achieving these improvements. 

47. 
The Bank carried out joint Country Program Reviews in 2004 and 2005. The reviews were 
effective in drawing the attention of senior government officials to portfolio issues, particularly to 
thematic weaknesses such as procurement problems, delays in counterpart funds and weak monitoring 
and evaluation. The Bank intensified efforts to improve implementation capacity with regular 
workshops and hands-on training, as well as independent procurement audits on several projects. 
These efforts were greatly facilitated by the presence of senior financial management and 
procurement specialists in the Madagascar office and the hiring of a safeguards specialist at the Bank 
office. 

48. 
Despite the intensive management of the portfolio, project implementation continued to be 
hampered by delays in the availability of counterpart funds due mainly to weaknesses in revenue 
generation on the part of the Government. These delays are not a sign of lack of ownership or 
commitment on the part of government. The application of the new Country Financing Parameters in 
May 2005, allowing for 100 percent Bank financing of projects, is already solving the problem of 
counterpart funds. 

C. Use of instruments 

49. 
Some important trends emerged regarding the use of instruments during CAS 
implementation. First, as noted, the number of active operations was reduced to 14 in line with the 
target set in the CAS. Second, IDA moved to provide assistance in an integrated fashion rather then 
through a narrow sector approach (e.g. the Growth Poles Project). Third, the attempt to move some 
project-supported activities to the PRSC proved premature. This experience plus the drop in the IDA 
envelope called for a re-alignment between investment operations and budget support. As a 
consequence, PRSC financing declined from US$120 million in FY05 to U S 8 0 million in FY06 
(though the provision of additional debt relief through the Multi-Lateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) 
is helping to off-set the decreased PRSC amounts). Fourth, the Bank has increasingly been using the 
SWAP approach for sector involvement (transport, health). Fifth, the Bank showed flexibility by 
adapting to changing country circumstances; it helped Madagascar deal with the devastating impact of 
the 2004 cyclones through the approval of the US$50 million supplemental credit to the Community 
Development Project. 

Attachment 8

50. 
The PRSC has become a central piece of the policy dialogue between the Bank and the 
government. It also has become an important instrument of donor harmonization, especially in critical 
areas like governance and public expenditure management. The PRSC dialogue has also served to 
better structure work across all areas of IDA involvement. The AAA program (see Annex lb ) has 
supported the policy dialogue and project design. As noted, an ample range of analytical work had 
supported assistance on governance. The PGDI has provided additional resources to undertake needed 
diagnostics and to respond quickly to emerging needs. The on-going Country Economic 
Memorandum will provide more insights into the underpinning of employment generating growth in 
Madagascar. 

D. The World Bank Group 

5 1 . 
IDA and the IFC have established productive partnerships, most notably in the financial 
sector and the power sector. The IFC program is broad. In the financial sector, it seeks to cover all 
ranges of the market through guarantees, finance to SMEs and credit lines; it also seeks to introduce 
new lines of business, like leasing. In infrastructure, the IFC Advisory Services conducted the 
successful concession of the container terminal of Toamasina in June 2005. It assists now with the 
involvement of the private sector in the 12 main airports of the country. The IFC is actively exploring 
participating options in the oil and mining sector. As noted, IFC is a main player in the reform of the 
energy sector, hoping to conclude a PPP for JIRAMA. Madagascar is one of the few countries in 
Africa where the IFC is deploying its full range of products and services, both technical assistance and 
investment. 

52. 
The designation of Madagascar as a WBI Focus Country in FY04 led to a better integration of 
WBI and IDA activities and a substantial increase in WBI activities. During the CAS period, WBI 
has worked especially closely with IDA project teams as follows: 

Support to the PGDI Project Team: WBI's support aimed at introducing a framework that links 
capacity with development outcomes, and aligning and coordinating resources to meet identified 
needs. This framework is being applied for strengthening local training institutes and training 
newly appointed Chefs de Rkgions. 
Education: The support to the ministry of education aimed at improving financial management, 
the monitoring system, coordination with the Ministry of Finance, donor coordination, and 
evaluation and assessment. There has also been support for higher education sector reform. 
Health: WBI supported the development of alternative financing mechanisms to better protect 
populations from the impoverishing effects of illness and the introduction of the main concepts, 
instruments and strategies for improving the financing of health services. WBI also focused on 
equipping participants with the knowledge and tools needed in their work on developing hospital 
policies in relation to the health related MDGs, so that these would be better adapted to on-going 
or projected health sector reforms, to shifts in donor support from projects to programs, and to 
poverty-reduction strategies. 
Social Protection: In the Social Protection area, WBI's support consisted of developing the 
country's Risk Management and Social Protection Strategy and the National Social Protection 
Policy. 

Regulation and Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure: The main objective has been 

to share and disseminate knowledge on PPP options in delivering sustainable and affordable 
infrastructure in Madagascar. 

Attachment 8 
Page 1 6 o f 33 

53. 
The number of people trained by WBI increased from 74 in FY03 to 485 in FY04, and stayed 
at that high level since then. The rapid increase in the number of participants came mainly as a result 
of efforts to organize Madagascar-specific activities in the country, as opposed to inviting selected 
numbers of Malagasy nationals to attend regional events held elsewhere as was the case before FY03. 
Although WBI's efforts to customize its support to Madagascar are yielding good results, more can be 
done to better integrate WBI activities with IDA operations. This will be a key objective under the 
next CAS. 

E. Donor coordination 

54. 
Donor coordination greatly improved during the CAS period, particularly with respect to 
budget support, education and transport. The donor community is supporting Madagascar through a 
range of technical assistance grants and training initiatives designed to enhance the implementation of 
the PRSP. The key donors involved include the World Bank, European Union, UNDP, French Co- 
operation, the African Development Bank (AfDB), GTZ, USAID, and the MCC. 

55. 
Budget support and fighting corruption: Lack of initial donor coordination delayed 
progress in improving public expenditure management. To remedy this situation, the government and 
the key budget support donors-World Bank, European Union (EU), France (Agence Franqaise de 
Dheloppernent, and the French Co-operation), and the AfDB-signed 
a partnership agreement 
(Cadre de Partenariat) in 2004 to provide a framework and to lay out procedures and modalities to 
work together. The agreement has been implemented through yearly action plans and periodic 
reviews of results undertaken in joint supervision missions for the PRSC and the EU's program of 
budget support. Key reforms in public financial management and fighting corruption are being 
supported by financing from IDA together with technical assistance from the EU, GTZ and the French 
Cooperation. Donor coordination around implementing customs reforms has also improved. 

56. 
Education and health: The Ministry of Education has continued to lead the dialogue with 
donors in the education sector (UNICEF, French Co-operation, AfDB, AFD, Japan, USAID and 
World Bank), mainly around the Education for All initiative. Whilst they support diverse activities, 
donors take a holistic approach and coordinate well overall progress under the Education for All as 
well as under individual projects. In addition, the key donors are coordinating their support in health 
and are moving towards a sectonvide approach starting in 2007. HIV/AIDS, water, agricultural and 
environmental sector reforms and investment continue to be approached together with other partners. 

57. 
Transport: The Bank is collaborating closely with the EU in the transport sector to support 
the implementation of the country's Transport Sector Strategy. The Bank provides support to all sub- 
sector activities- in roads, ports, railways and airports - while the EU is the main financier of the 
national road network. The EU and Bank provide coordinated and consistent advice on institutional 
and sector reforms and there are flexible financing arrangements in place with agreements on the 
financing of Technical Assistance and recurrent costs. 

58. 
IMF: The Bank closely collaborates and coordinates activities with the IMF. The staffs of 
the two institutions conduct regular joint assessments of the PRSP implementation and also work 
closely together on (i) public finance management; (ii) tax and customs; (iii) privatization program; 
and (iv) trade.

VI. LESSONS LEARNT FOR SUBSEQUENT CAS DESIGN 

59 . 
Assistance is more effective in the areas that are true priorities of government. Alignment 
with the PRSP was a critical factor in ensuring that the Bank's program supported the development 
priorities of the country. Still, the contribution to results varied. Assistance was most effective in the 
areas that the government put on top of its agenda, such as transportation, education and the fight 
against HIVIAIDS. Difficulties arose in other areas, particularly with regard to rural development 
where more progress could have been made had the government provided stronger leadership. 

60. 
In a highly uncertain environment,flexibility during implementation favors effectiveness. 
The experience of the CAS implementation showed that dealing promptly and adequately with 
unforeseen events requires a flexible and adaptive approach. For instance, the Bank adapted its 
lending program in response to the two cyclones of 2004 by providing a supplemental credit to the 
Community Development Project to deal directly with the impacts of the cyclone.'6 Also, CAS 
implementation reduced the weight of budget support to accommodate the slow pace of improving 
public expenditure management. 

61. 
Overly ambitious goals lead to an uneven performance. The CAS reflected the high 
expectations generated by the political changes and reform commitments of the new government. 
Some of these expectations have materialized (as in the social sectors), while others have progressed 
at a slower pace (as in rural development and governance). Several factors have contributed to this 
uneven performance. First, goals in some areas (e.g. governance) were ambitious and covered a wide 
range of initiatives. Second, Madagascar has limited capacity to accompany political commitment 
and the country is left over-extended and pursuing multiple initiatives. Third, the capacity of the Bank 
and other donors to adjust their strategies is limited by the quality of data, as well as by donors' 
bureaucratic procedures. Fourth, in some cases there may be a gap between the open and the true 
commitment of the authorities, for political economy reasons. 

62. 
When the Bank is the largest donor in certain sectors, it is very difficult to be as selective as 
it should. The scarcity of donors in Madagascar has left the Bank as the main external actor in several 
critical areas. Therefore, the Bank's project portfolio and AAA continued to encompass a wide range 
of activities,17 lacking the focus of other donors (e.g. the EU). The result from this approach has been 
that the Bank has implemented some very successful projects but often their impact has been confined 
to limited geographical areas (rural water, microfinance). 

63. 
Transferring investmentprojects to the budget required greaterpreparation. The gradual 
transition of programs related to human development and governance issues to the government's 
budget through the support of the PRSC was not smooth. The original agenda was over-optimistic at 
the design stage, with insufficient prioritization of actions, and under-estimation of the capacity 
constraints and implementation lead times. The failure to increase the mobilization of internal 
resources made it difficult to secure adequate resource allocation to ensure sustainability of programs 
transferred to the budget (e.g., nutrition), as well as to support capacity building in areas where 

l 6 It is recommended that, in the future, the CAS treat these risks as an integral risk to the country's development and the 
Bank's program, given that natural disasters such as cyclones are quite prevalent in Madagascar. The OED's CAE concluded 
likewise. 
" In some respects th is was unavoidable as the Bank was either already engaged in sectors from which it could not exit as it 
was one of the only donors active, e.g. health, or it engaged in activities at the urgent request o f Government and when called 
upon as lender o f last resort, e.g. Community Development Project supplemental to respond to the cyclone, support to 
Madarail. 

Attachment 8 
Page 18 of 33 

assistance moved from sector projects to the general budget.'' In addition, the slow progress in 
modernizing the public expenditure system made it difficult to track the final use of resources as 
opposed to budgetary allocations. 

64. 
Bank presence in th e f i e ldp ro v ed timely and contributed significantly to achieving results. 
The Bank (IDA and IFC) built up its decentralized team in the Antananarivo office throughout the 
CAS period. The greater presence in the field led to a strong relationship with the government, based 
on trust and openness. In this manner, the Bank has been effective in leveraging its comparative 
advantage as a knowledge institution, responding on a timely basis to the requests from government. 
Likewise, the Bank presence on the ground has allowed it to react faster to unforeseen events like the 
two cyclones of 2004 and the JlRAMA energy crisis. There is a strong fiduciary team and a 
safeguards expert based in the Country Office which has ensured a concerted and timely focus on 
these issues as part of overall portfolio management. The field presence facilitated the dialogue and 
the coordination with the private sector and civil society. 

65. 
Lack of information limits monitoring and evaluation. During the course of the CAS, as the 
Bank and other donors jointly adopted results-oriented programs, the need arose to define a few 
critical indicators. In parallel, it was recognized that better statistics and M&E systems were critical 
in order to be able to monitor the results, follow the impact of the interventions and introduce 
corrections as needed. Unfortunately, the quality of the statistics in Madagascar is poor due both to 
the institutional weakness of the National Statistical Office and the lack of a recent national 
population census. 

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 

66. 
Support the government strategy but be realistic. The strategy to align the CAS with the 
PRSP worked and should be continued with the MAP. The Bank will do well to heed IEGYs caution 
against over-optimism presented in the Country Assistance Evaluation. Consequently, it is important 
for the Bank to move early and advise the government on the realism of the expected results under the 
MAP to ensure that unrealistic ambitious do not drive the strategy. In this regard and as already 
recommended in the IMF program, a preferred approach would be to outline several scenarios. 

67. 
Focus on only a few but strategic objectives. As noted, Bank assistance to Madagascar 
cannot be as selective as desired, because the Bank is now involved in a broad range of areas and 
there are few donors active. However, it can move gradually to greater selectivity. To begin, the new 
CAS could identify more sharply the strategic objectives it seeks to support and the results it seeks to 
achieve. Greater precision here will help to ascertain the relevance or priority of existing and future 
Bank engagements. Then, as the on-going portfolio ages, as certifiable progress is made even on a 
pilot basis, and as the available envelope expands the Bank program can gradually gain selectivity. 

68. 
Support the government in its efforts to scale up successful initiatives. The Bank should 
develop a comprehensive strategy to support scaling-up. Progress in using the budget as an effective 
instrument of development policy will be the basis for scaling up. This implies attention to credible 
sector strategies, continuing to improve the delivery capacity of sector agencies, improving the 
capacity to track expenditure, and malung definite progress in the implementation of the new 
procurement legislation. In addition, a higher level of internal domestic revenue will signal to donors 

18 The Implementation Completion Report of PRSC-I assesses the achievements and experiences to date of providing budget 
support and these lessons are informing the design of the future PRSCs. 

Attachment 8 
Page 19 of 33 

the government's commitment to its own agenda. Increasing domestic resource mobilization will 
support sustainability without the Bank. 

69. 

Sharpen the strategic agendas. As noted in the CAE, the agenda on growth needs to be 
further developed, especially to improve the understanding of linkages across sectors and 
interventions and to help bring dynamism into the rural sector where most of the poor live. Such 
work should help steer policy towards the promotion of employment generating growth. In addition, a 
better understating is needed of the impact of the rapid population growth and the prospects for a 
demographic transition. Also, as noted by IEG, the governance agenda should focus its interventions 
on the most critical areas -customs, procurement, licensing, etc. Again, the available international 
experience shows that governance improves faster when targeted to key priorities. In this regard, 
assistance to address issues of high corruption or conflict of interest should be a priority. 

70 . 

Follow apragmatic approach regarding the use of instruments. Moving forward it is 

advisable to increase the use of SWAps. The experience of SWAp-type approaches has been positive 
in education, HIV/AIDS, transport, water and sanitation sectors as they have allowed for better donor 
harmonization. The next CAS can continue with sector-wide programs in the following areas: (i) 
assistance to the on-going Education for All initiative in primary education; (ii) a proposed SWAP in 
the health sector; and (iii) further harmonizing the transport sector projects with those of other donors. 

Put greater emphasis on dissemination of the results of analytical work. IDA has 

71. 
undertaken a broad range of analytical work, some in the context of project implementation. This 
analytical work can be utilized more effectively to broaden the development dialogue in Madagascar 
and involve all local development partners. 

7 2 . 

Emphasize results and monitoring of outcomes. The next CAS will necessarily be results 

based: the effectiveness of the results approach for the MAP and the CAS will hinge to some extent 
on the quality of the information. Hence, the next CAS should address the issue of the quality of 
information in cooperation with the development community and the authorities.

Good performance: m 

Total budget for the sector has 
continued to substantially increase 
over the past years, confirming the 
importance of the sector for the 
government. Expenditures increased 
from US.Sl0.6 million in 2004 to 
US$15.9 million in 2005, providing 
respectively 324.00 and 233.000 
persons with potable water. In 2006, 
the sector total budget is estimated 
at US$21.1 million, representing an 
increase of 33 percent 

1 microfinance networks ranges between 65 
percent and 200 percent, greatly exceeding 
the 60 percent initial goal set by the project 
and comparing favorably against 
performance of microfinance institutions of 
the same age globally 
The legal, judicial and regulatory 
framework for microfinance has been 
developed and strengthened 
The competence of the Secretariat for 
Banking Supervision Commission for 
microfinance supervision has been 
strengthened 
A pilot training program for microfinance 
practitioners has been successfully 
implemented

About 400.000 people have gained 
access to safe water through the 
construction of 627 boreholes equipped

service delivery arrangements to expand 
sustainable and cost effective water supply ; 
ii) medium term results oriented program 
budget, iii) national manual of procedures;

Presidential declaration 
(Durban Vision) has been a 
positive motivation to reach 6 
million ha of protected areas by 
2010 

BUT 
Rush to meet Durban Vision 
has surpassed institutional 
capacity and neglected other 
critical areas (such as resource 
management outside protected 
areas) 

Illegal exploitation of forest 
products has increased in 2005106 
following a ban on legal permits and 
2004 permits 

Target has been slightly 
surpassed with the preliminary 
establishment of new protected areas 
covering 1,050,000 ha 
BUT 
Much remains to be done to 
finalize the establishment of new 
protected areas 
The Ministry of Environment, 
Water and Forestry is undertaking a 
reform program focusing on 
strengthened forestry and 
environmental governance. 
Although many challenges remain, 
this includes the establishment of a 
Forestry Observatory and a Mobile 
Control Unit, development of a 
more competitive and transparent 
forest exploitation adjudication 
system, recruitment of new staff for 
the deconcentrated forestry offices 
and establishment of new 
environmental units in the 22 
regions (on-going) 
The area reforested increased 
only minimally since the last CAS 
(from 348,000 ha to 360,300) due to 
delays in the reforestation activities.

on a regular basis and (iii) 
better communication about

needed both for teachers, 
education administrators and 
parents 

Lessons 
It is not sufficient to monitor 
the indicator at the national 
level. The planning and 
distribution of textbooks must 
be improved, with greater 
monitoring and reporting by 
school committees and paren ts 
There is still a debate on the 
reliability of recent data. Still 
progress seems evident 
question remains on the scale

Prevention is just a first step.

indicator (long-term commitment needed) 
Good performance: 
Firstly, by transferring large amount of 
resources to rural areas, the project has 
contributed to reduce the gap in basic 
social and economic service delivery 
between rural and urban areas, thus 
reducing rural poverty and inequities, 
especially in remote and underserved 
areas 
Secondly, the project has allowed to 
restore basic services delivery 
(transport, education, health, potable 
water etc.), quickly after the major 
2004 cyclones 
Thirdly the project has provided a 
flexible safety net instrument to help 
the population cope with major 
weather and economic risks, 
preventing them from falling deeper 
into poverty. Finally, by successfully 
piloting the transfer of block grants 
communes, the project has paved the 
way and guided the process of 
mainstreaming support to communes, 
planned under the Local Development 
Fund
