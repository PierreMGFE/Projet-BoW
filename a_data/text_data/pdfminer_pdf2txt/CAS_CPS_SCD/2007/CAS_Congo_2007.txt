PREFACE 

1. 
This document presents both the multi-donor Country Assistance Framework (CAF) and the 
World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Democratic Republic o f Congo 
(DRC). The CAS i s derived from the broader CAF, which i s designed to harmonize donor support to 
DRC’s recovery effort and the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The other 
donors participating in the CAF ’ are expected to present the CAF document as a framework for their 
respective assistance programs. 

2. 

The CAF, derived from the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and presented in Part 
A, articulates donors’ common strategic approach to economic assistance for DRC in the post-election 
period (2007-2010). The CAF i s a first step toward harmonization o f donor assistance, which, as 
donors have agreed, i s important to rationalize their support for the recovery effort. Part A 1 
summarizes recent developments in DRC . Part A2 diagnoses the key challenges facing the country as 
outlined in the PRSP, and articulates how those challenges w i l l be addressed under each PRSP pillar. 
Part A2 also presents the medium-term outlook for the country. Part A3 discusses seven key risks 
common to a l l donors operating in DRC, and the corresponding risk management strategies. 

3 . 

The CAS, presented in Part B, i s the Wor ld Bank Group’s program o f support for DRC. I t 
lays out a coordinated strategy for the Bank Group’s three key entities - the International 
Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency (M IGA ) . 
In a country w i th a strong potential for private sector 
development and where private investment i s key to complementing relatively meager flows o f 
O f f ic ia l Development Assistance (ODA), the articulation o f a coordinated strategy, including 
complementary actions b y these t h r e e en t i t ies , i s critical. Part B 1 reviews past assistance by IDA , 
IFC, and M IGA , inc lud ing the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), and summarizes lessons learned. 
Part B2 lays out the Bank Group’s strategy for FY07-FY11, and Part B3 discusses risks that are 
specific to the Bank Group, along w i th proposals for how they are to be managed w i th in the context o f 
the overall CAF risk management framework. 

4. 

The CAS was prepared against the backdrop o f the Bank’s grow ing experience in post- 
conflict countries. The proposed strategic direction reflects recent analytical work by the Bank’s 
Development Economics V ice Presidency Group (DEC),* as w e l l as lessons and good practices

DEMOCRAT IC REPUBLIC OF CONGO: COUNTRY ASSISTANCE 
STRATEGY FYOS-FY 11 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

With the gradual return to peace and a new, democratically elected Government in place, 
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has a strong opportunity to reduce poverty and promote 
broad-based, sustainable, and pro-poor growth, provided the authorities strengthen the institutional 

framework and improve governance. DRC i s endowed w i th a wealth o f natural resources which, i f 
managed properly, can help the country recover from the devastation created by years o f conflict and 
mismanagement that have made i t one o f the poorest countries in Africa. 
DRC’s Human 
Development Index declined by more than 10 percentage points in the last ten years - and DRC 
now ranks 167 ou t o f 177 rated countries, w i th the great majority o f the population without access to 
the most basic human services. About 70 percent lives below the poverty l ine , and in some parts o f the 
north and east, poverty levels are above 80 percent. Given their experiences over the past few 
decades, the Congolese people place renewed hope in the ab i l i ty o f the new Government to improve 
their l iv ing conditions. 

2. 

The Government strengthened policies and institutions over the period 2001-2006, leading 
to D R C attaining the HIPC Decision Point in 2003. S ince 2001, w i th the support o f the Bretton 

Woods institutions and others, the Government has implemented a solid program o f economic 
reforms, including new investment, labor, mining, and forestry codes designed to make these 
traditionally opaque sectors more transparent, able to attract reputable foreign investors. DRC recently 
joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), as a further effort to increase 
transparency in the m in ing and forestry sectors. Private investment has been relatively high, mainly in 
the natural resource sector (about US$2.7 b i l l ion in new investments s ince 2003), and now constitutes 
a significant share o f the overall private capital flows to Sub-Saharan Africa. Better management o f 
public finance has helped break hyper-inflation and stabilize the exchange rate. As a result, economic 
growth returned in 2003, after a decade o f decline, and i s estimated to have been about 6 percent 
between 2003 and 2006. 

3. 
The challenges ahead remain daunting. The Government recently adopted a Governance 
Compact w i th the people o f DRC, under which i t promises to work on a broad front. In the short-term 
the focus i s on reforming the security sector, strengthening the judiciary, strengthening po l i t ica l 
governance (through decentralization and the increased role o f the women in public l i fe) , and 
improving economic governance (through public finance management and anti-corruption efforts). 
The key challenge w i l l be to implement this ambitious program - a long-term effort for which a 
substantial amount o f external support w i l l be necessary. 

4. 
Ensuring shared and sustainable growth. The country’s history suggests that economic 
growth alone w i l l no t necessarily translate into better l iv ing conditions for the majority o f the 
Congolese people. The country’s abundant natural resources make i t particularly important to ensure 
better governance o f these sectors. In the short term, DRC w i l l also need to make further progress in 
economic management and maintaining key infrastructure. This w i l l help to reestablish i t s credibility 
w i th i t s population, as we l l as externally, and allow i t to negotiate a new Poverty Reduction Grant 
Facility (PRGF) w i t h the IMF . Significant investments coupled w i th po l icy and institutional reforms 
are required to rehabilitate and expand key transport and energy infrastructure, and improve the 

- 11 - 
.. 

business environment. In addition, a significant increase in public spending in support o f key social 
sectors i s necessary to alleviate dismal social conditions. I f these challenges are not met, DRC w i l l 
have l i t t l e chance o f even coming close to achieving the M i l lenn ium Development Goals (MDGs) by 
2015. 

Performance o f the Bank Group’s 2004 -2006 Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) 

5. 
Performance under the 2004-2006 TSS is rated as moderately satisfactory. The TSS aimed 
at consolidating the transition and restoring the foundation for effective poverty alleviation efforts, 

in close collaboration with other donors. The TSS program was h igh ly relevant to DRC’s needs and 
aligned w i th the Governments’ priorities, as expressed in the I-PRSP and the economic program. I t 
had four strategic e lemen ts : security and social stability, h igh and shared growth, governance and 
institutional strengthening, and social development. The period was characterized by a strong dialogue 
between the Bank and Congolese authorities, as we l l as w i th non-government stakeholders. The Bank 
played a major role in donor coordination, and together w i th other donors initiated a move toward 
greater harmonization o f donor activity. Implementation was overall satisfactory; however, i t was 
hampered by mis-procurement and project management issues. Results, as measured against the TSS 
indicators, were mixed. The resu l ts framework consisted o f 19 performance indicators, o f which 11 
were partially or completely achieved as elaborated in para. 48 . 

Planned Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 

6 . 
part of 

This CAS aims to define the business p lan for World Bank Group’s support to D R C and is 
the multi-donor Country Assistance Framework (CAF), an effort through which 17 donors 

have developed a common strategic approach for economic assistance to DRC . The CAF provides a 
framework for each donor’s assistance strategy for DRC. The Bank Group’s assistance strategy, the 
CAS, was designed through extensive consultation w i th the Government, c i v i l society, and private 
sector actors. Bu i ld ing on Bank experience working in post-conflict and transitional countries, i t 
proposes an agenda that includes: (i) effective management o f the existing Wo r ld Bank Group 
portfolio; (ii) analytical work; (iii) I D A financing; (iv) scaling up the activities o f the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC); and (v) expansion o f the activities o f the Mu l t i la tera l Investment 
Guarantee Agency (M IGA) . The main anticipated outcomes - adherence to good governance 
principles and improved emphasis on poverty reduction - are expected to lead to improvements in 
governance, better management o f natural resources, better procurement o f public goods and services, 
improved health and education indicators, and improved rural incomes. 

7. 

The CAS w i l l focus ma in ly on three o f the f ive pillars o f the Government’s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP): 

Promotion of good governance and consolidation of peace. The Bank Group’s efforts 
support of 

the Governance Contract w i l l focus on natural resources management, public 
financial management, and public administration reform, through the full range o f i t s support 
- advisory and analytical work, technical assistance and capacity building, and financing. 

in 

Achievement of 
sustained and shared economic growth, 
through 
infrastructure 
rehabilitation and expansion; and private sector development to foster economic 

diverszjication. I D A also expects to provide the full range o f i t s support to this pillar, IFC 
w i l l provide advisory se rv ices and financial support; and M I G A w i l l provide advisory 
services and guarantees. 

Improved implementation of poverty alleviation programs, w i th emphasis on health, 

education and H IV /A IDS ; underserved communities, inc lud ing indigenous communities; and 
the rural sector. 
Other donors are expected to take the lead in supporting the remaining two PRSP pillars - combating 
H IV /A IDS and promoting community dynamics, although ongoing I D A activities w i l l continue. 

8 . 
Theproposedprogram is complementary to the activities of other key donors and builds on 
the Bank’s strength in delivering advisory and analytical activities within the multi-donor 
assistance framework. The Bank expects to take the lead in:

public expenditure management (together w i th the IMF) ; 
public administration and c iv i l service reform, and local governance apd decentralization 
(together w i th EC); 
investment climate, public enterprise reform, and natural resources management (w i th 
increased support from IFC and M IGA , and w i th the I M F and EC); and 
Infrastructure sectors4 (together w i th EC and A fDB) . 

Risks 

9 . 
World Bank Group engagement in DRC has high risks. I t potentially has even higher 
returns not only for the Bank but also for other countries of 
the sub region. Research and 

experience have shown that external assistance can play a key role in promoting the type o f 
governance reforms needed for consolidating economic growth and po l i t ica l stabilization, and hence 
for escaping the conflict trap. Through consultations w i th a l l stakeholders and donors, Bank staff have 
identified the fo l low ing main risks: (i) po l i t ica l instability and resurgence o f armed conflict; (ii) fragile 
macro-economy; (iii) obstructed or slowed implementation o f cr i t ica l economic and governance 
reforms; (iv) corruption; (v) centrifugal tendencies that could result from mismanagement o f the 
decentralization process; (vi) poor donor coordination; (v i i) operational risks to the portfolio; and 
(v i i i) reputational risk. To help donors and the Bank manage these risks, the CAS focuses on 
improving governance, decentralization, public expenditure management, natural resources 
management, and the effective delivery o f shared growth and poverty-focused projects, including 
infrastructure and rura l development. 

Results 

Expected results. The CAF and CAS provide a framework to assist the Government in 

10. 
creating the conditions for improved governance and shared growth. The main expected outcomes 
from the CAS are adherence to good governance principles, shared growth and access to improved 
social services. 

The Bank Group’s assistance to the in f ras t ruc tu re sectors might need t o be adjusted in view o f the recent 
protocol o f understanding that the Government o f DRC signed with the Government o f China, reportedly 
up to $ 5 b i l l ion o f financing for transport in fras truc ture , mining concessions, and other investments.

PART A. THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK 

1. 
The Country Assistance Framework (CAF) i s a process by which a number of donors have 
developed a common strategic approach for economic assistance to Democratic Republic of 
the 
Congo (DRC) in the post-elections period. The C A F i s derived f r om the p r io r i t ies articulated in the 
Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) and covers the pe r iod 2007 t o 2010. I t i s expected that it 
w i l l prov ide a so l id basis fo r harmon iz ing approaches and programs. 

2. 
The CAF is born from the recognition that the issue of aid harmonization is at the core of 
the recovery challenge in D R C . Assistance t o D R C i s characterized by the paradox ica l combination 
o f a re la t ive ly large number o f donors (with more than 20 agencies p rov id ing assistance through a 
broad var ie ty o f operational partners, bo th governmental and non-governmental), and a re la t ive ly 
limited to ta l amount o f assistance (about US$SOO m i l l i o n in annual disbursements). A id i s inadequate 
g iven the scale o f challenges that D R C faces (about US$15 per capita per year). This situation carries 
significant risks with regard to the actual capacity o f a id agencies to e f fec t ive ly con tr ibu te t o s tab i l i ty 
and recovery: (i) by absorbing limited Government capacities in the d ia logue with a large number o f 
partners; (ii) by mak ing the achievement o f synergies d i f f icu l t , in a con tex t where ind iv idua l projects, 
even if each one i s successful, may no t be enough to yield an impac t at the coun tryw ide leve l ; and 
(iii) by disconnecting economic assistance f rom other in terna t iona l e f for ts (po l i t ica l , security, 
humanitarian) and hence limiting i t s po ten t ia l impac t on the ove ra l l s tab i l iza t ion agenda. 

3. 
The CAF has generated intense interest among donors as an effort 
to coordinate and 
harmonize approaches. S tar t ing f r om a sma l l core group, par t ic ipa t ion has rap id ly expanded to 17 
members, inc lud ing bo th mu l t i la te ra l organizations - the W o r l d Bank G roup (WBG), the European 
Commission (EC), the In terna t iona l Mone tary Fund (IMF), the A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t Bank (ADB), 
and the United Na t ions (UN) system - and key bilaterals: Belgium (Be lg ian Cooperation), Canada 
(Canadian In terna t iona l Deve lopmen t Agency, C IDA ) , France (French Cooperation), Germany, 
Japan, China, the Netherlands, I ta ly , Spain, Sweden (Swedish In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t Agency, 
SIDA), the United K i n g d om (Department fo r In terna t iona l Development, DFID), and the Un i ted 
States (US Agency fo r In terna t iona l Development, USAID). 

4. 

The CAF process aims to harmonize donor approaches and instruments at a minimum 
transaction cost. As in many harmon iza t ion efforts, the C A F challenge has been to overcome 
bureaucratic comp lex i t ies and differences o f ins t i tu t iona l cultures t o reach a consensus around key 
pr ior i t ies . Potential bureaucratic issues stem f r om the m u l t i p l i c i t y o f review and approval mechanisms 
across institutions, wh ich can easily result in adding layers upon layers o f comp lex i ty to any j o i n t 
decision-making. D i f ferences o f ins t i tu t iona l cultures are sometimes as basic as different meanings 
fo r what an assistance strategy i s (e.g., fo r the W o r l d Bank Group i t i s essentially a se t o f decisions 
guiding the a l loca t ion o f existing resources, while fo r the United Na t ions it i s an e f fo r t aimed at 
mob i l iz ing new f inanc ing - wh ich calls fo r different approaches). The C A F hence consists o f a l igh t 
and pragmatic process a imed at ensuring a consensus on the substance o f the strategy, while leav ing 
ample f lex ib i l i ty t o each par t ic ipan t o n process issues . 

5 . 
The C A F has focused to date on building consensus around three key elements of any 
strategy: a jo int diagnosis, coordinated programming, and a common results m a t r k . In practical 
terms , this has translated in the produc t ion o f a ser ies o f “ jo in t chapters” tha t w i l l be incorporated in to 
each donor strategy. C A F donors have comm i t ted to incorporate these chapters verba t im in their 
respective strategies, although it i s agreed that some pa r t ic ipa t ing agencies may add to these chapters 
complementary ma ter ia l ( to meet their ins t i tu t iona l requirements). The j o i n t chapters are: (i) country 

context; (ii) key challenges and medium-term prospects; (iii) r i s k s ; (iv) thematic annexes for each o f 
the f ive PRSP p i l la rs (Governance, Growth, Basic Soc ia l Services, HIV/AIDS, and Commun i ty 
Dynamics); and (v) a resu l ts ma t r ix . 

6 . 
The CAF was a complexprocess. The wo rk has proceeded through a ser ies o f several day 
long meetings, interspaced with regular and in tense consultations among donors in Kinshasa. 
Wo rk ing groups developed common chap ter a n d common annexes after in-depth consultations with 
the Government. Discussions helped to sort out differences in approaches. W h i l e challenging t o 
manage, the process was quite successful, in that participants have remained enthusiastic (with new 
participants j o i n i n g in) despite the number o f actors, ins t i tu t iona l needs, and differences in operating 
modes, and in that a strong consensus has been forged on key pieces o f the CAF . The election o f the 
new Government has spurred consultations be tween the Government and the donors, and donor 
coordination has been added to the docket o f the Ministry o f P lann ing . The C A F was prepared 
through in-coun try j o i n t consultation with the new authorities and other stakeholders (private sector 
and c i v i l society) that took place in Kinshasa in September 2007. 

7 . 
Looking forward, next steps in the donor harmonization process include discussions 
regarding j o i n t mechanisms fo r supporting pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion (a j o i n t mon i to r ing and evaluation 
matrix), on the mos t e f fec t ive way fo r further harmon iza t ion o f donors in DRC ; and on strengthening 
o f the Government’s ow n coord ina t ion capacities.

PART A.1. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

The situation in D R C exemplifies many of the challenges faced by post-conflict countries. 

8. 
D R C i s endowed with a boun ty o f na tura l resources that give it the po ten t ia l to g row quickly in a 
sustainable manner out o f i t s pos t-con f l ic t state - prov ided that the resources are managed properly. 
S ign i f ican t progress has been made over the last years, but the challenges rema in daunting. Physical 
and social devastation caused by decades o f mismanagement and con f l ic t in one o f the most r ich ly - 
endowed A f r ican countries i s extreme. Living conditions fo r mos t o f the 58 m i l l i o n Congolese are 
extremely difficult, and the sharp deterioration o f social indicators jeopardizes the prospects fo r 
A f r i c a as a who le t o make decisive progress towards the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) 
(see Annex 1). The contrasts are stark, in a country the size o f Wes te rn Europe, between districts 
where the situation i s comparable t o other A f r ican countries and areas where extreme violence and 
urgent humanitarian needs pers is t . The po l i t ica l environment remains comp lex and fluid - and the 
reg iona l stakes are high, with seven out o f DRC 's nine neighbors hav ing experienced a ma jor con f l ic t 
over the last decade. 

A. Political Background 

D R C is emerging from a dreadful period of mismanagement, political instability, and 

9. 
conflict. After about eighty years o f co lon ia l ru le , several secessionist con f l ic ts in the post- 
independence period, and a l o n g pe r iod o f corrup t ion and mismanagement under President M o b u t u 
Sese Seko, D R C entered the 1990s in a state o f quasi-collapse. Tha t decade was marked by 
successive episodes o f increasing violence: loo t ing by the armed forces in 1991 and again in 1993, a 
first con f l ic t in 1997 (with the invo lvemen t o f seven fore ign countries and a number o f militias), and 
a second con f l ic t between 1998 and 2003 during wh ich a reported 3.5 m i l l i o n people died, and many 
more were displaced. 

the peace and reconciliation process. Since 

The recent elections mark the culmination of 

10. 
2001, and the appointment o f President Joseph Kab i la , considerable progress has been made, within 
the context o f the 1999 Lusaka ceasefire agreement and the inter-Congolese dialogue. Large-scale 
m i l i ta ry ac t iv i ty ceased in ear ly 200 1. Fo re ign forces fo rma l ly withdrew in 2002. The Un i ted Na t ions 
(UN) peacekeeping m iss ion (M iss ion des Nations Unies en Rkpublique De'mocratique du Congo, 
MONUC ) has deployed more than 17,000 troops in the country. The pace o f progress accelerated 
after June 2003 and the establishment o f a Trans i t iona l Government (and a Parliament) o f na t iona l 
unity: communications were re-established be tween areas wh ich had long been d iv ided along 
frontlines, key techn ica l ins t i tu t ions were re-unified, exchange rates were harmonized across the 
country, and a new cons t i tu t ion was approved by referendum in December 2005. D e s p i t e form idab le 
log is t ica l challenges (and loca l ized episodes o f violence), general elections took place in a 
satisfactory manner o n Ju ly 30, 2006 ( f i r s t round o f Presidential e lec t ion and Parliamentary elections) 
and October 29, 2006 (second round o f Presidential elections and loca l elections). 

1 1. 

For thef irst time since 1960, the Government, Parliament, and local authorities have been 
selected through democratic elections, and new institutions are now in place. President Joseph 

Kab i la w o n the presidential elections with 58 percent o f the vote against his challenger Jean-Pierre 
Bemba who obtained 42 percent o f the vote. President K a b i l a announced the compos i t ion o f his 
government on February 5, 2007. Led by Pr ime Minister Gizenga, this government comprises 60 
members, inc lud ing six ministers o f state, 34 ministers and 20 deputy ministers. I t i s a coa l i t ion 
representing the broad po l i t ica l p la t fo rm wh ich supported President K a b i l a during t h e 2006 elections 
and i t includes the Presidents party (Pa r t i du Peuple pou r l a Reconstruction et la De'mocratie, 

- 3 - 

PPRD), the Pr ime M i n i s t e r ’ s par ty ( P a r t i Lumumb is te Unifie‘, PALU ) , and the U n i o n des De‘mocrates 
Mobu t is tes (UDEMO). The Par l iamen t and Senate are in place as we l l as P rov inc ia l Assemblies. 

12. 
Still, much remains to be done to further consolidate the peace and reconciliation process. 
There i s insecurity in the East due t o rema in ing m i l i t i a ac t iv i ty . In Ituri, approx ima te ly 4,500 m i l i t i a 
members are s t i l l harassing the c iv i l ian popu la t ion and f igh t ing with the weak army and the over- 
stretched M O N U C . In N o r t h Kivu, negotiations be tween r e b e l leader Lauren t Nkunda and the 
Government o f D R C resulted in an agreement to mix brigades l o y a l t o Nkunda with regular army 
brigades. Loca l ized r io ts sporadically a f fec t other parts o f the coun try (e.g., in Bas Congo, at the end 
o f January) and deadly clashes occurred in Kinshasa in M a r c h between Senator Bemba’s guards and 
government forces. Wh i le a ma jo r reversal o f the achievements o f recent years seems unlikely, ma jor 
challenges rema in ahead. E f fo r ts w i l l be needed to prevent the disenfranchisement of key 
constituencies and po l i t ica l leaders. Reg iona l differences may have been crys ta l l ized by the elections 
process, inc lud ing be tween the Western and Eastern parts o f the coun try . V io lence that s t i l l affects 
several districts a long the Eastern borders, inc lud ing widespread human rights abuses, w i l l need to be 
contained to avo id i t s spreading to ne ighbor ing countries, and eventually reduced. The demob i l iza t ion 
and reintegration o f former combatants, the un i f ica t ion o f a l l armed forces, through the integration o f 
the Government’s and rebe l armed forces in to a restructured na t iona l military w i l l be key to restoring 
s tab i l i ty throughout the coun try . 

13. 
Overall, the po l i t ica l context i s fluid, and external partners w i l l need t o mon i to r the situation 
closely, to best adjust their programs to the evo lv ing circumstances. The elections have transformed 
the environment in wh ich assistance w i l l be prov ided in many ways, but the new po l i t ica l landscape i s 
on ly starting t o take shape. F o r donors, the key i s s u e i s whether the new po l i t ica l context w i l l be one 
where ambitious re forms can be implemented - o r no t . In this context, donors w i l l pay particular 
attention to mon i to r ing developments in the fo l low ing fou r areas: 

First, the Government’s commitment to reforms. B o t h the President and the Pr ime Minister 
have emphasized the importance o f good governance since the elections. In February 2007, the 
Prime Minister prepared and presented a government program t o Par l iamen t wh ich included a 
Governance Contract between the authorities and the people o f DRC . This contract, wh ich 
covers March-December 2007, i s an important f i r s t step in ou t l in ing much-needed reforms in a 
broad range o f areas: security sector reform, transparency, pub l ic finance management, the 
management o f na tu ra l resources, pub l ic adm in is tra t ion reform, loca l government, and the 
investment c l ima te and pub l ic en te rp r ise re form . The key challenge w i l l be t o implement this 
ambitious program - a task fo r wh ich a substantial amount o f external support w i l l be 
necessary . In i t s f i r s t few mon ths in office, the Government took impor tan t s teps towards the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Contract, in particular in the area o f decentralization, but much remains 
to be done. 

Second, the effectiveness of 
the decision-making structure. The years o f trans i t ion have been 
marked by comp lex dec is ion-mak ing arrangements. W h i l e this has fac i l i ta ted consensus around 
key decisions, i t has also translated in to delays and second-best compromises. The challenge 
w i l l be to find ways t o strengthen the decision-making process, w i thou t los ing the ab i l i ty to 
reach broad support on key decisions. 

Third, the Government’s actual authority over specific constituencies. The i s s u e i s whether 
the Government w i l l be in a pos i t ion to break with the constant need fo r compromises that has 
characterized the last years and to take on powe r fu l constituencies wh ich may have vested 
interests in the status quo. 

- 4 - 

And fourth, the role of the opposition. As the po l i t ica l environment develops, the constitution 
o f po l i t ica l alliances (or the permanence o f divisions) be tween oppos i t ion groups, and their 
comm i tmen t to due process (e.g., challenging the Government in Parliament rather than in the 
streets), w i l l be key factors to watch. The M a r c h 2007 clashes in Kinshasa a re evidence that the 
social s i tua t ion remains tense in many parts o f the country and the need fo r the Government to 
deliver peace dividends i s cr i t ica l . Particular attention w i l l also be needed to ensure the s tab i l i ty 
o f those areas wh ich vo ted massively fo r the opposition. In addition, i t w i l l be important to 
wa tch the ways in wh ich the po l i t ica l environment created by the Government fosters 
engagement with the oppos i t ion in the nascent democracy. In bo th the short and medium te rms , 
it w i l l be necessary t o rev iew the way in wh ich the oppos i t ion functions, the space they have to 
operate, and the re la t ionsh ip they have with the Government. 

B. Economic Background 

D R C is one of 

the poorest countries in the world, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 

14. 
per capita of at about US$139 in 2006 . Despite i t s r i c h endowments in na tura l resources and the 
dynamism and entrepreneurship o f i t s population, D R C has been affected by a se r ies o f economic 
crises since independence, w h i c h were exasperated during the years o f con f l ic t . GDP per capita 
dropped f rom US$380 in 1960 t o US$224 in 1990 to the current US$139 (in constant dollars). 

The decade of conflict, compounded by the legacy of sustained mismanagement, has had 

15. 
devastating effects. P r io r to the con f l ic t , the Congolese economy was dominated by extractive and 
export ac t iv i t ies (mining, agriculture, forestry, energy), w h i c h fueled a system o f poo r governance 
and large-scale corrup t ion . The vast ma jo r i ty o f the popu la t ion remained poor, and derived i t s income 
f rom trad i t iona l agriculture and in fo rma l activities. Wa r and c i v i l disturbance have taken a high t o l l 
on the country. In fras truc ture has suffered f rom lack o f maintenance and considerable phys ica l 
damage. M a n y ins t i tu t ions are in shambles. M i l l i o n s o f people have los t their assets, inc lud ing 
buildings, livestock, and tools. M a n y en te rp r ises have los t assets, staff, and commerc ia l networks. 
Overall, the economy has been transformed, and i s n o w centered o n subsistence agriculture and 
in fo rma l activities, with a collapse o f export and value-adding ac t iv i t ies . 

16. 
Since Ap r i l 2001, the Government has implemented a solid program of economic reforms, 
supported by the Bretton Woods Institutions. This program aims b o t h to spur pr iva te- led economic 
g row th and to tack le some o f the deep-rooted structural i s s u e s wh ich have hampered DRC ’s 
economic development in the past. In terna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) support was p rov ided through 
a S ta f f Mon i to red Program (SMP), between June 2001 and M a r c h 2002; access to the Pover ty 
Reduction and G r ow t h Fac i l i ty (PRGF) fo r the per iod April 2002 t o M a r c h 2006; and a new SMP 
between April and December 2006, renewed until end June 2007. Bank support was prov ided through 
a ser ies o f budget support and investment operations, as we l l as substantial ana ly t ica l w o r k and po l icy 
advice. 

1 7. 

Overall, implementation was satisfactory unt i l about mid-2005. I t deteriorated during the 
pre-election period, but recovered again in early 2007 following the appointment of 
the new 
Government. Fou r perioals can be distinguished 

- 5 - 

Throughout 2001, vigorous measures were taken to break hyper- in f la t ion , stabilize the 

exchange rate ( fo l low ing the decision to f loa t the Congolese Franc in April 2001), restart 
revenue collection, and launch key structural reforms. 

F rom early 2002 to mid-2005, efforts succeeded in further stabilizing the macroeconomic 

situation - with 12-month in f la t ion at about 12 percent; a re la t ive ly stable exchange 
(although with substantial short-term fluctuations, in a large ly do l lar ized economy, where the 
monetary basis i s ve ry small); and a gradual increase o f f isca l revenues, f rom about 5.9 
percent o f GDP in 2001 to about 11.4 percent o f GDP in 2005. Para l le l e f for ts were made on 
the structural side, with s ign i f ican t achievements in a broad range o f areas, inc lud ing the 
strengthening o f the cha in o f expenditure; the adop t ion o f new investment, mining, and 
forestry codes; and the comp le t ion o f pub l ic en te rp r ise audits. 

F rom mid-2005 to end-2006, performance deteriorated, la rge ly as a result o f po l i t ica l 

uncertainties and the absence o f a func t ion ing executive during the e lec t ion period. End-o f- 
year in f la t ion reached 2 1.3 percent at the end o f 2005, and dec l ined s l igh t ly t o 18.2 percent at 
the end o f 2006. The Congolese Franc registered 17 percent depreciation during 2006. S t i l l , 
s ign i f ican t e f for ts were made by the authorities to manage this d i f f i c u l t period, inc lud ing 
en forc ing a mo ra to r ium on key transactions by pub l ic companies. 

Since early 2007, after the elections were held successfully and the new Government 
appointed, macroeconomic stability has been restored. The Government has prepared i t s 

program, inc lud ing a Governance Contract, expressing i t s de term ina t ion t o fight corrup t ion 
and imp lemen t strong governance policies. An IMF mission w i l l visit Kinshasa during 
December 4-18 to initiate discussions on a three-year arrangement under the Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) . 

1 8 . 

These actions have elicited a strong private sector response. Abou t US$2.7 b i l l i o n in new 

investments (a s ign i f ican t share o f pr iva te cap i ta l f lows t o Sub-Saharan A f r ica ) have been registered 
by the Government since early 2003, wh ich reflects the pr iva te sector’s interest in the country’s 
immense na tura l resources and prov ides an ind ica t ion o f i t s g row th po ten t ia l . Inves tmen t t o date has 
been focused on rap id-re turn activities, mos t ly in Kinshasa and Katanga, in a broad range o f sectors 
(e.g., telecom, services, agro-business, construction, and na tura l resource exploitation). 

As a result, economic growth returned in 2002 after ten years of contraction. Wh i le the 

19. 
available statistical data have limited re l iab i l i ty , a l l indicators give a convergent p ic tu re o f progress. 
G row th has been pulled by the resump t ion o f economic ac t iv i ty w h i c h fo l lowed the re-establishment 
o f security and the reun i f ica t ion o f the coun try (a pattern typ ica l o f pos t -con f l ic t countries), especially 
in the trade, transport, construction, and agriculture sectors; by a boom in selected manufacturing 
(agro-business, cons truc t ion materials); and by the restart o f mining ac t iv i t ies ( f rom a very l o w basis).

to the Bank, the IMF, and the A f r ican Development Bank), and resumed timely service o f i t s debt, 
after almost t e n years o f in terrup t ion . In September 2002 the Paris C lub granted s ign i f ican t b i la tera l

Boards o f the Bank and the IMF agreed on a f loa t ing Comp le t ion Point, with triggers related to : (i)

(v i) adoption o f satisfactory sectoral strategies and related imp lemen ta t ion plans fo r health, education, 
and ru ra l development; and (vii) improvements in pub l ic debt management. The date fo r reaching the 
Comp le t ion Po in t w i l l depend o n the new Government’s comm i tmen t to re fo rm and i t s

23 . The deterioration of 

infrastructure has also reached proportions that make economic 

development almost impossible in many areas. In a c o u n t r y the size o f Wes te rn Europe , there are 
less than 600 km o f p a v e d roads. Out o f t e n p r o v i n c i a l capitals, o n l y one can b e accessed by l a n d

arrangements were not known, including the concessionality o f the loan. As long as the borrow ing i s on highly 
concessional te rms , the funds are used for productive purposes in l i n e w i t h the Government’s priorities, and the 
disbursements are in line w i t h the country’s absorptive capacity, this arrangement could be beneficial to the 
country, triggering a higher grow th rate and accelerating export growth, at least in i t ia l ly .

C . Soc ia l B a c k g r o u n d 

25. Progress toward peace and recovery is taking place within the context of an acute social crisis, 

wh ich constitutes a ma jo r risk fo r the country’s recovery. While po l i t ica l progress, economic reforms, 
and the r e t u r n o f g row th have produced some v is ib le resu l ts , the soc ia l s i tua t ion remains appalling. A 
large number o f Congolese communities have been forced in to autarky and are living in dreadful 
conditions, due to the collapse o f the transport system and widespread insecurity. Women and girls 
have been disproportionately affected by violence and pover ty and their numbers among the poor 
have increased. A l though detailed data are missing, specialized agencies repor t a large number o f 
v ic t ims o f sexual violence and a g row ing number o f orphans and s t ree t ch i ldren . Overall, an estimated 
16 m i l l i o n people have c r i t ica l food needs, and the vast ma jo r i ty o f the popu la t ion consumes less than 
tw o thirds o f the da i ly calories needed t o ma in ta in good hea l th - with 71 percent o f the people living 
on l e s s than one do l lar a day. 

26. Part of the impact of the conflict i s not directly visible, but nonetheless devastating. Large-scale 

displacements, violence, and human rights abuses, as well as 
impover ishmen t have caused 
tremendous psycho log ica l suffering and a deterioration o f the social fabric, break ing up fam i l ies and 
other so l idar i ty networks. As a result, many trad i t iona l safety ne ts are n o longer func t ion ing 
e f fec t ive ly , and some o f the social ne tworks wh ich are key fo r economic recovery have been severely 
disrupted. The deterioration o f education and health services during the war years have dealt a 
powe r fu l and las t ing b l o w to the we l l -be ing o f the popu la t ion and i t s capacity to recover. 

27. Overall, D R C is likely to miss most of the M i l lenn ium Development Goals by 2015 (see B o x 1). 

W h i l e detailed statistical in fo rma t ion i s lacking, available indicators suggest tha t the con f l ic t has 
caused “development in reverse” in the social sectors. L i f e expectancy stands at 43 years, under-5 
mo r ta l i ty above 205 per thousand. DRC ’s Human Development Index dec l ined by more than 10 
percentage po in ts in the last t e n years - and D R C n ow ranks 167 ou t o f 177 rated countries. Progress 
made be tween independence and the ear ly 1990s has large ly vanished.

D. Dono r Activities 

28. The ma in donors (see Char t 2 and Chart 3) are the W o r l d Bank, European Commission, the UN 
Agencies, IMF, AfDB and some key bilaterals (the UK, the United States, Belgium, and the 
Netherlands). Other bilaterals in terven ing in DRC are Canada, Sweden, France, South A fr ica , Japan, 
Germany, I ta ly , Switzerland, China, and Spain. 

29. Since 2001, DRC has received a growing inflow of externa l economic a id - with annual 

disbursements increasing f r om less than US$200 m i l l i o n in 2001, t o about US$SOO m i l l i o n a year in 
2004 and 2005 each. This i s on ly a frac t ion o f international assistance t o DRC - wh ich also includes 
the f inanc ing o f a sizable peacekeeping force (over US$3 b i l l i o n a year), support t o the po l i t ica l 
process (the 2006 elections cost over US$450 m i l l ion) , as we l l as human i tar ian assistance (about 
US$300 m i l l i o n a year).

30. Ex te rna l assistance, however, has been concentrated only in a few sectors and has left wide 

gaps. Support has been d irec ted towards emergency (non-humanitarian) a id (25 percent), health and 
other social services (14 percent), budget support (12 percent), commun i ty development (1 1 percent), 
demob i l iza t ion and re in tegra t ion ( 9 percent), democracy (8 percent), and capacity building (7 
percent). Support to in fras truc ture and the produc t ive sectors has been negligible compared to the 
needs. L o o k i n g forward, ind ica t ions are that a s ign i f ican t po r t ion o f funding w i l l be channeled to 
growth-related ac t iv i t ies (e.g., the extractive industries) and to areas that w i l l support g row th such as 
power and roads.

3 1. The Bank represents a significant share of donor support in some key economic sectors. The 

Bank i s the ma in donor in a l l infrastructure sectors (transport, energy, and water). Until now , i t has 
prov ided a large p ropo r t ion o f budget support (although the re la t ive share o f the Bank’s con tr ibu t ion 
in this area has been decreasing as other donors moved t o this area), and i t p lays an impor tan t ro le in 

capacity building. 

32. A id harmonization remains a challenge. Dono r coord ina t ion has s ign i f ican t ly increased since 
2002. The scale o f needs in D R C and the challenges o f fulfilling those needs have necessitated an 
increased leve l o f coord ina t ion in fund ing and programm ing to ensure t h e bes t use o f available 
resources. Consultative Group meetings organized under the leadership o f the Government and the 
Bank (five since 2002) have helped to mob i l ize funds and create a consensus within the international 
community. Coo rd ina t ion has been further enhanced through the preparation o f the j o i n t CAF . 
W i t h i n the coord ina t ion framework that the C A F represents, the Bank w i l l continue p lay ing a leading

PART A.2. KEY CHALLENGES AND MEDIUM-TERM PROSPECTS 

A. Country Vision and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 

33. The Congolese leadership has set out an ambitious vision for the country’s development. This 
v is ion i s articulated in the PRSP, wh ich was presented in Ju ly 2006. I t emphasizes the need to break 
w i t h past practices and t o ensure a dramatic improvement o f living cond i t ions throughout the country, 
as a cond i t ion fo r sustained peace and eventual economic recovery. The PRSP bu i lds on the 2001 
Interim PRSP, and like the Interim PRSP (wh ich was endorsed by a l l Congolese po l i t ica l forces at the 
onset o f the peace process) i t enjoys broad support among a l l key constituencies. 

34. The PRSP was prepared through a genuine and extensive consultation process. Each d is tr ic t 
prepared a d is tr ic t- leve l PRSP through an extensive grassroots consu l ta t ion process managed by 
specialized non governmental organizations (NGOs). These documents were consolidated in to 
prov inc ia l- leve l PRSPs, and eventually in to the na t iona l PRSP. C i v i l society ( inc lud ing faith-based 
organizations, 
labor unions, NGOs, women groups, you th associations, and commun i ty 
representatives), 
the p r iva te sector, pub l ic 
ins t i tu t ions (na t iona l and 
local), and po l i t ica l 
representatives - in total, about 35,000 people - participated in this exercise. This process increased 
ownership o f the re fo rm agenda by a broad par t o f the popu la t ion . 

3 5 . I n a post-conflict environment, this process has provided a framework for refocusing the 
national dialogue toward a forward-looking agenda. The breadth o f the PRSP consultation process 
made i t possible no t on ly t o develop ownership o f the pover ty reduc t ion agenda among a l l key 
constituencies, but also t o mob i l ize the country’s energy in support o f a soc ia l ly oriented, fonvard- 
look ing agenda - w h i c h i s essential as the coun try moves away f r om the years o f con f l ic t and 
mismanagement w h i c h have l e f t a legacy o f acute po l i t ica l and social tensions. 

36. I n the face of a formidable set of constraints, the Congolese have articulatedpriorities around 
f ive strategic pillars: (i) p romo t ing good governance and conso l ida t ing peace; (ii) consolidating 
macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and economic growth; (iii) imp rov ing access to social services and reducing 
vu lnerab i l i ty ; (iv) comba t ing H I V / A I D S ; and (v) p romo t ing commun i ty dynamics. These p i l la rs are 
closely related and inter-dependent, and progress in one area i s cond i t iona l to advances in others - 
e.g., be tween g row th and state reform; among social services delivery, state reform, and commun i ty 
dynamics. Wh i le the ar t icu la t ion o f key pr ior i t ies around these themes prov ides a u s e f u l ana ly t ica l 
framework, they need to be understood as complementary parts o f a single, ho l is t ic strategy. 

37. The PRSP sets an ambitious development policy agenda, t o be implemented with pub l ic capital 
and pro-poor spending estimated at US$3 .4 b i l l i o n fo r the f i r s t three-year pe r iod (2006-08). Pub l ic 
investment i s pro jec ted t o increase f rom US$236 m i l l i o n (3 percent o f GDP) in 2005 to US$1.3 
b i l l i o n (13 percent o f GDP) in 2008. Even with f inanc ing o f this magnitude, however, i t i s no t clear 
that the coun try has the capacity to absorb such a rap id expansion in pub l ic investment. The 
Government now needs t o develop a wo rk ing p lan with specific p r io r i t ized actions, costing, timing, 
and de f in i t ion o f the en t i ty in charge at least fo r the f i r s t year, and pre ferab ly fo r the f i r s t few years. 
The p lan should be developed by the existing en t i t ies fo r p lann ing and budgeting, so as to integrate 
the poverty reduc t ion process in to the country’s na t iona l and loca l systems. This p lan should: (i) take 
in to account the rea l is t ic amount o f f inanc ia l and human resources available, wh ich means that the 
re form agenda inc luded in t h e PRSP should be p r io r i t ized and p rope r ly sequenced; (ii) assign 
pr ior i t ies even among the actions inc luded in this plan, so that less urgent programs can be postponed, 
should the available f inanc ing f a l l short (the Government has already started this p r io r i t iz ing 
exercise); (iii) c la r i fy the links among the ove ra l l goals, proposed programs, macroeconomic 

- 13 - 

framework, and progress indicators; ( iv) develop a ma t r ix o f goals, programs, progress indicators, and 
the entity in charge, wh ich the PRSP does no t have currently; and (v) inc lude an external debt 
management strategy 
in an t ic ipa t ion o f po ten t ia l add i t iona l space 
fo r bo r row ing post- 
H I PCM u l t i l a t e r a l Debt R e l i e f In i t ia t ive (MDRI). Preparing the wo rk ing plan w i l l also help p r io r i t ize 
the needed capacity reinforcement program. 

B. K e y Challenges 

The five pillars se t out in the PRSP together articulate mos t o f the ma jo r challenges fac ing DRC : 

3 8. P i l lar 1. Promoting Good Governance and Consolidating Peace 

Achieving the goals of P i l lar 1 involvesjlve major sets of challenges: 

- 
- 
- 

Reforming the secur i ty sector (m i l i tayy , po l ice , jus t ice system), b y : 
comp le t ing the in tegra t ion o f a l l armed forces ( former regulars and rebels), and the 
demob i l iza t ionhe in tegra t ion process; 
ensuring a regular payro l l , strengthening professionalism and d isc ip l ine o f bo th the 
m i l i ta ry and the police, and in i t ia t ing c i v i l i a n oversight; 
Strengthening the organizational and ins t i tu t iona l capacity and professionalism o f the 
jud ic iary , inc lud ing through pay re form . 

- 

Im p r o v i n g the management o fpub l ic resources, by: 
imp rov ing the transparency o f budgeting and contracting, strengthening watchdog 
en t i t ies , building mechanisms fo r pub l ic participation, and sanctioning fraud through 
j u d i c i a l action; 
increasing government revenues, focus ing on revenue sources such as the m in ing sector 
and customs, broadening the tax base, and re in fo rc ing the tax adm in is tra t ion fo r sma l l 
and medium enterprises; 
enhancing t h e compos i t ion and execution o f pub l ic expenditure, by dec is ive ly increasing 
pro-poor budget allocations; imp rov ing execution o f the budget; and strengthening pub l ic 
f inanc ia l management systems and the capacity o f the second t i e r o f government, in light 
o f decentralization. 

- 

- 

- 

Reforming the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion , by: 
beg inn ing the long- term process o f rebuilding an e f fec t ive pub l ic service, to inc lude the 
creation o f a c i v i l service register, a func t ion ing pay ro l l management system, and a high- 
leve l c i v i l service; 
- managing the decentralization process, with p r io r i ty 
focus on 
imp rov ing the 
imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing capacity o f loca l governments (see B o x 2).

Box 2. Managing Decentralization 

The new Cons t i tu t ion allocates 40 percent o f domestic f isca l revenues co l lec ted in each p rov ince to p rov inc ia l 
authorities, and also de f ines the respons ib i l i t ies o f p rov inc ia l and other sub-national authorities, inc lud ing ma jo r 
service aspects o f p u b l i c service de l ive ry in p r im a r y and secondary educa t ion and p r ima ry health care. 
However, the PRSP does n o t re f lec t these f isca l t r a n s f e r s in the macroeconomic f ramewo rk or discuss h ow the 
devo lu t ion o f respons ib i l i t ies w o u l d be carr ied out. Whereas key lega l acts regu la t ing f isca l and administrative 
decentralization had been scheduled f o r adaptation be fore the 2006 Pres iden t ia l and Parliamentary elections, 
this proved t o be imposs ib le due t o a lack o f p o l i t i c a l consensus. This subsequently led t o a situation in w h i c h 
p rov inc ia l assemblies and governors were elected in early 2007 in the absence o f the necessary lega l framework 
fo r the operation o f p r o v i n c i a l ins t i tu t ions . 

Risk m i t iga t ion measures in troduced by the central government around the p r o v i n c i a l elections reduced f isca l 
t r a n s f e r s to the prov inces f r om a prev ious l e v e l o f 15 percent t o 6 percent. Democ ra t ica l ly elected p rov inc ia l 
institutions were therefore expected t o func t ion w i thou t the necessary lega l f ramewo rk o r f isca l resources, 
generating p o l i t i c a l tensions between p r o v i n c i a l and central government authorities. 

The urgency brough t about by the r a p i d imp lemen ta t ion o f p o l i t i c a l decen tra l iza t ion created a highly po l i t ic ized 
decentralization debate in the f i r s t h a l f o f 2007, focused around the issue o f f isca l resource allocation, p i t t i n g 
elected governors and heads o f p r o v i n c i a l assemblies against the cen tra l government. The former ins is ted o n the 
immediate and d irec t app l ica t ion o f cons t i tu t iona l pr inc ip les w h i l e the latter argued that m o r e technical w o r k i s 
required t o ensure t h e equitabIe a l loca t ion o f resources as w e l l the e f fec t ive management o f competency 
transfers. 

The debate f ina l ly cu lm ina ted in a compromise between central and p r o v i n c i a l authorities, c o n f m e d at the 
Na t iona l Decen tra l iza t ion Forum, held f r om 3-5 October 2007, w h i c h b rough t together a l l stakeholders in the 
process. I t has been agreed that January 2008 i s the target date fo r the imp lemen ta t ion o f cons t i tu t iona l 
prov is ions o n decentralization, in par t icu lar those regard ing the provinces. However , techn ica l arrangements, 
no tab ly the broad architecture o f in tergovernmen ta l relations, 
i n c l u d i n g clear revenue and expenditure 
assignments and f isca l transfers, as w e l l as key leg is la t ion rema in to be adopted, pu t t ing this target date at risk. 

W i t h the compromise reached o n t h e imp lemen ta t ion o f cons t i tu t iona l provisions, the nex t immediate objective 
i s t o ensu re that the decen tra l iza t ion process does n o t fur ther weaken pub l ic expenditure management and 
se rv ices delivery. The Governmen t w i l l therefore need t o rap id ly formu la te an ac t ion p l a n t o build personnel 
and f inanc ia l management capacity at p r o v i n c i a l level, w h i c h w i l l require s ign i f ican t donor support. 

Furthermore, it i s impor tan t t o no te tha t the decentralization o f functions and finances t o p r o v i n c i a l l e v e l i s on ly 
the f r s t step in the decen tra l iza t ion process. E lec t ions fo r decentralized authorities t o b e established at sub- 
p rov inc ia l leve l a re scheduled f o r 2008. Adm in is t ra t ive - te r r i to r ia l re fo rms t o d iv ide the ex is t ing 1 1 prov inces 
in to 26, mos t ly new prov inces are t o be imp lemen ted in 2010, 
f o l l ow i n g cons t i tu t iona l provisions. 
Decentralization i s there fore a theme tha t w i l l a f fec t re forms in a l l k e y sectors throughou t the CAS per iod . 
Whereas in p r inc ip le the process cou ld generate s ign i f ican t bene f i ts in imp roved pub l ic service delivery, as w e l l 
as in enhanced p o l i t i c a l accoun tab i l i ty , the process also poses serious risks ( f iduc ia ry as w e l l as po l i t ica l ) in

Box 3. The Fores t R e f o rm Agenda 

The DRC harbors the second largest rainforest in the world. These forests are a v i ta l source o f food, income, 
medicine, fuel, and shelter, and they fulfill cultural needs for m i l l ions o f ru ra l poor, including indigenous 
peoples. They harbor unique biodiversity and store large amounts o f carbon, and provide valuable ecologicial 
se rv ices . 

In 2002, 43 m i l l i o n hectares, i.e. h a l f the country’s rainforest had been awarded irreguraly and without due 
process w i t h no loca l consultation, no environmental measures, and no consideration for alternative uses . The 
risk o f an unregulated expansion o f logging w i t h the r e t u r n o f peace and improved infrastructure, in a context o f 
institutional collapse needed to be addressed uregtnly and forcefully. Under the TSS, the Government addressed 
this legacy o f mismanagement to lay the foundation o f more equitable and sustainable models. S ince 2002, w i t h 
support from the international community, the government has:

Increased the annual area fee to dissuade further speculation on forests lands, in 2004; 
Launched a legal rev iew o f a l l concessions including those awarded in breach o f the moratorium, engaged 
an international independent observer w i t h the active participation o f loca l community representation - 
ongoing; 
Established an independent logg ing monitoring system to help f igh t i l lega l logging, in 2007. 
Adopted a Forest Code that replaces the 1949 colonial r u l e , protects loca l peoples’ traditional rights, and 
introduces the principles o f benefit-sharing, management plans, and environmental se rv ices . 

Although this re form agenda faced resistance from many vested in teres ts , the area under concessions dropped 
f i om 43 m i l l i o n hectares in 2002, to 21 in 2007. This work helped restore forest people’s rights, and fieed up 
space to implement community-based management, create new protect areas, and develop innovative models 
that reward the DRC for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation, and other services their forests provide to the 
global community. S i n c e 2004, public debate about forest management in DRC has intensified w i t h broad and 
l ive ly stakeholder participation. The consensus that emerged around this forest agenda i s reflected in the 
B r u s s e l s Declaration o f February 2007 and in a report “Forest in Post-Conflict DRC” coauthored w i th 14 c i v i l 
society and research organizations. 

Look ing forward, the p r io r i ty w i l l be to consolidate the in i t ia l achievements and provide continued support to 
reformers. The Bank w i l l : (a) continue to support the reform agenda especially the moratorium and the legal 
review as core-elements to any effort to reduce poverty and improve governance in DRC; (b) continue to help 
develop innovative forest management and protected area models; and (c) help strengthen the capacities o f 
public institutions, c i v i l society, and loca l communities to implement, enforce, and monitor the new policies in 
the field. These progressive policies have attracted international support f rom a wide range o f donors including 
the Bank in the context o f country as we l l as regional intiatives such as the Congo Bas in Forest Partnership, 
through two IDA and GEF g ran ts and a Mu l t i-Donor Forest Trust Fund that i s being established w i t h the 
European Union, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Germany and Luxembourg and innovate ve landscape 
management planning processes supported b y the U S and NGO partners.

Bo x 4. R e f o rm i n g Public Enterprises 

Public en terpr ises are the cornerstone o f the DRC economy: in particular, they dominate the m in ing 
sector (GECAMINES, M IBA ) , they control the transport (airports, railways, ports), water and power 
sectors. They represent the vast ma jor i ty o f formal employment in DRC. In the transport sector alone 
they employ 33,000 persons and s t i l l generate in excess o f U S $ 250 m i l l i o d y e a r in revenues despite 
an outdated and dere l ic t infrastructure. Likewise, they a re responsible for prov id ing a very large 
por t ion o f the health and education serv ices o f the country. 

As public monopolies, they have not been subjected to adequate oversight for many decades resulting 
in huge losses to the community at large bo th in t e r m s o f misdirected investment, s k y h igh tariffs, 
revenues leakages, etc. SNCC (the railway company) provides an illustration o f the conditions o f the 
public en te rp r ise sector: SNCC counts over 13,000 employees, on ly 500 km o f railways a re 
operational (out o f 3,600 km) and - on average - one out o f t h r e e trains derail. 

As o f today, pub l ic en te rp r ises represent bo th a burden and a l iab i l i ty to the State and potentially 
important tools for economic development as they are active in the areas that are the most l ike ly to 
attract investments and/or generate revenues in the foreseeable h t u r e (including power, extractive 
industries and transport). 

S ince re-engaging in DRC, the W o r l d Bank came to the conclusion that public en terpr ise re form i s a 
cr i t ica l element to ensuring sustainable and equitable economic development. As such, assistance to 
these en te rp r ises has been t ied to a clear re form agenda whereby investment i s subordinated to re form 
steps to ultimately a l low for private sector participation. 

P i l lar 2, Consolidating Macroeconomic Stabilitv and Economic Growth

Box 5. The Post-Conflict Economic Rebound in DRC 

A n economic rebound i s typ ica l in post-conflict countries, and i s linked to the resumption o f economic 
activity, improved secu r i ty , access to serv ices , and renewed confidence. In most countries, the rebound 
translates into an average grow th rate o f 6 percent a year for a per iod o f 7 years, before starting to subside. 
In DRC, though the medium-tern macroeconomic objectives in the PRSP are based on this average, they 
may be overly ambitious, s ince real GDP grew by only about 5 percent in 2006, and i s projected to grow b y 
6.5 percent i s 2007. As a result, the average growth rate for 2006-08 i s unlikely to be more than 6.5 percent. 
The Government needs to put greater emphasis on stabilizing the macroeconomic situation in the short 
te rm , to lay the foundation for growth.

P i l la r 3 involves three sets of challenges:

source o f well-distributed growth across provinces. 
Extractive industries, wh ich currently represent about 13 percent o f GDP, have the potential to be a key source 
o f both fiscal revenues and foreign exchange. 
The PRSP identifies four categories o f population which should be pr imary targets o f social protection 
programs: vulnerable women and children; disabled persons; the elderly; and the displaced. A se r ies o f 
targeted social protection measures w i l l be introduced for these groups aimed at reducing risk and promoting 
their economic and social integration in to society.

Box 6. Challenges in the Health and Education Sectors 

Hea l th 

The crisis o f the past decades have severely affected the health status o f the population and degraded the health 
system. Mo re than 1,200 people dy ing per day, most from preventable diseases such as malaria and respiratory 
diseases. In 2001, under-five mor ta l i ty was estimated at over 200 per 1,000 l ive births, and maternal mortality at 
greater than 1,200 per 100,000 l ive births, among the highest in the world. Such rates, combined w i t h the country’s 
population o f 64 m i l l i o n wh ich i s the th i rd largest in Sub-Saharan Africa, means that DRC represents a significant 
proportion o f the burden o f i l l n e s s and mortality on the continent. Wh i le overall health status and service u t i l iza t ion 
i s poor, there are also significant disparities between the poor and better-off. Barriers to health service u t i l iza t ion 
include lack o f geographic access, poor functionality and quality o f services, and the cost to households. The focus o f 
health service development has been on the Health Zone system, wh ich integrates a network o f primary health 
services w i t h a referral fac i l i ty . Based on a history o f public-private partnership w i t h church-based providers, non- 
governmental organizations have a significant ro le in sector development. Since 2002, combined w i t h greater social 
and economic stability in most parts o f the country, significant improvement in health sector financing levels, both 
domestic and international, are expected to have improved the health status o f the population. However, many areas 
remain w i t h l ow or no external supports, so that adequate financing for a l l Health Zones, from domestic and 
international sources, i s needed to expand coverage o f service and reduce barriers to care. W i t h l im i ted government 
capacity, particularly at the prov inc ia l level, this could be achieved through the financing and supervision o f resu l ts - 
based contracts w i t h governmental and non-governmental providers, as we l l as support for basic high-impact 
preventive interventions such as fam i ly planning and anti-malaria bednets. Measures for ensuring acceptable 
standards o f service delivery and the consistency o f standards in diagnosis and treatment -particularly b y non-state 
partners - also need to be implemented. 

Education 

A key objective in the education sector i s to move systematically and as rap id ly as i s feasible towa id achieving the 
constitutional commitment to universal, quality primary education. A t the same time, the higher education system 
also needs to be developed, to produce the professional class that DRC needs for its future development. Du r ing the 
PRSP cycle, the Government i s expected to decide on a financing p lan and align the budget allocation.with sector 
priorities; and also to adopt measures to ensure that allocated funds reach their intended recipients. External partners 
are prepared to step up their support to meet the financing gap in the sector, provided that the financing p lan i s 
credible and that there i s evidence o f improved efficiency. The recently completed Education Sector Review, and 
ongoing analyses o f teacher financing and the elimination o f school fees, w i l l provide guidance on how to pr ior i t ize 
among the many objectives.

Pillar 4, Combating H I V / A I D S 

Pillar 4 addresses four sets of challenges: 

Reducing the transmission rates of HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), 

par t icu lar ly among women and youth, by p romo t ing behav ior change; and adopting a national 
strategy to make an t i-re trov ira l therapy un iversa l ly available; 

Speeding up treatment and improving the quality of 

l i fe ofpersons l iv ing w i th HIV/AIDS; 

Attenuating the negative socioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS o n ind iv idua ls , families, and 

communities; and 

Strengthening the mechanisms for coordinating a l l stakeholders and partners wo rk ing on 
HIV/AIDS, and fo r mon i to r ing and evaluation o f ac t iv i t ies (see Box 7 ) . 

Box 7. Challenges in Combating H IV /A IDS 

With prevalence estimated at 4 percent and l e s s than 3 percent o f men and women (age 15-24) knowing how 
H IV /A IDS i s transmitted and what can be done t o avoid exposure, the H IV /A IDS epidemic poses a huge public 
health problem. Prevalence among pregnant women i s particularly high in urban areas (5.2 percent) and in 
conflict-affected areas where specific studies indicate that in fec t ion rates o f victims o f sexual violence can reach 
20 percent. The number o f persons infected i s estimated at 1.23 m i l l ion in 2006, and the number o f those 
affected, including orphans and other vulnerable children i s relentlessly rising, creating more soc ia l distortions. 
Counseling and testing i s s t i l l llimited to a few hundred s i tes , and anti-retroviral therapy (ART), provided f i e e o f 
charge through several donor-financed projects, i s only available to 10 percent o f the 220,000 who are eligible 
for treatment. Further, there i s no national policy to make ART universally accessible. 

Pillar 5. Promoting Communi& Dvnamics6 

Pillar 5 encompasses four sets of challenges: 

Facilitating the effective involvement of communities in preparation, implementation, and 

mon i to r ing that may a f fec t them; 

Consolidating peace and laying the groundwork for recovery, through commun i ty- leve l 

projects focused o n income generation, loca l governance, commun i ty security, infrastructure 
and reconc i l ia t ion . 

Promoting area-based development in impoverished communities, in order to jump-s tar t m icro- 

economies and build soc ia l capital; compensate fo r insu f f ic ien t pub l ic goods; empower the poor 
and vulnerable, pa r t icu la r ly women; and strengthen democratic practices; and 

Over the last 40 years, strong grassroots organizations have emerged in many communities, largely as a 
response t o the absence o f a functioning public sector; but successive Governments have not included them in 
t h e dialogue and decisionmaking on key development priorities. The current Government aims to ha rness the 
collective contributions o f these organizations to help implement poverty-reduction activities at the l o c a l 
level. 

- 2 1 - 

Ensuring the efJicient dispersion and use of scarce resources, by developing cr i ter ia for 
commun i ty activities, inc lud ing ownership, sustainability, e f f ic iency , and complementarity 
with coun try-w ide programs; and for a l loca t ing external resources t o commun i ty activities. 

C. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook 

3 9. The baseline scenario? assumes that prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms 
w i l l continue to attract strong foreign-direct 
investment and f inanc ia l support from 
the 
international community. As a result, rea l GDP g row th i s expected t o increase f rom 6 percent p.a. 
be tween 2002-2006 to 7.3 percent p.a. on average over the 2bO7-2011 pe r iod (see Table l), fue led by 
strong pr iva te investment driven by FDI. High FDI g row th o f about 25 percent, mos t ly to the mining 
sector, i s expected t o be sustained over the same period. These h i g h FDI g row th projections are 
plausible, given tha t D R C has A f r ica ’s largest deposits o f copper, cobalt, and coltan, as well as 
s ign i f ican t reserves o f diamonds and petroleum. The l o n g years o f mismanagement and insecurity 
caused mining sector ac t iv i t ies to g r ind to a halt, reduc ing the share o f the mining sector in GDP f rom 
25 percent o f GD P in the mid-1980s to l e s s than 10 percent in the early 2000s. However, w i t h the 
stabilization o f the security and macroeconomic conditions, the recent successful trans i t ion to 
democracy, and high commod i ty prices, investors have already began to f lock back to DRC . The 
authorities estimate that to ta l investments in copper and cobalt projects cou ld reach U S $ 3 b i l l i o n 
through 2012, a l low ing ou tpu t to return to levels no t recorded since the 1980s. 

40. Under this scenario, the current account deficit including official transfers is expected to 
increase from lpe rcen t of G D P in 2006 to 1 0 percent of G D P in 2011, reflecting DRC ’s need for 
external capital. D R C i s expected to reach the H IPC Comp le t ion Po in t in 2008. Accord ing ly , it i s 
assumed to benefit f r om debt r e l i e f under the H IPC and MDR initiatives, lead ing to a s ign i f ican t 
dec l ine in i t s debt-to-GDP ratio, f rom 120 percent in 2007 t o 3 8 percent in 201 1. Debt service i s also 
expected to decline as a r e s u l t o f these in i t ia t ives . I t i s assumed that the Government w i l l use the 
f isca l space gained through debt r e l i e f and improved revenues fo r pro-poor programs, wh ich cou ld 
take the fo rm o f reduced fees fo r school and basic health care. Even with these transfers, the f isca l 
balance i s pro jec ted to reach ing a de f ic i t o f on ly 1 percent o f GD P on average between 2007 and 
201 1. Government’s recurrent spending i s projected to increase f rom 16 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 18 
percent in 2011 as pub l ic consumption increases, wh i le cap i ta l spending i s expected to more than 
double f rom 3 percent o f GD P in 2006 t o 8 percent as the share o f GD P over the same period. 

’ The macroeconomic analysis presented here uses a dynamic general equilibrium model (MAMS) t o explore 
the e f f e c t s o f different scenarios on debt burden and other macroeconomic indicators.

4 1. Alternative scenarios have been analyzed to assess the risk of adverse circumstances. These 

projected scenarios have been produced using MAMS. Under the no re fo rm scenario, average real 
GDP g row th i s assumed to be i t s h is tor ic average (1 percent), FDI i n f l o w w i l l be much lower 
(g row ing at about 10 percent), and debt re l ie f w i l l no t be attained. The government w i l l no t ga in any 
f isca l space, and the scope fo r imp lemen t ing pover ty-reduc ing programs i s severely compromised. 
D R C w i l l run in to a debt crisis, as i t s pub l ic access to external f inanc ing i s severe ly limited and i t s 
debt-to-GDP ra t io reaches an unsustainably high l e v e l (141 percent). Moreover , under this scenario, 
pr iva te consumption in rea l terms w i l l be about h a l f o f the corresponding amounts under the baseline 
at the end o f the p ro jec t ion period; even i f the government manages t o pay i t s employees, there w i l l 
be discontent among the popu la t ion at large. 

42. Another scenario assumes borrowing on less concessional terms. This scenario obv ious ly leads 

to a substantial deterioration in DRC ’s pub l ic debt indicators. Debt service payments to the res t 
wou ld increase, lead ing to an increase in recurrent spending, wh ich w o u l d need to be financed by 
add i t iona l new borrow ing . U n l e s s the r e t u r n on the investments financed with l e s s concessional 
fore ign loans i s high, this strategy risks that the government w i l l allocate more resources to servicing 
i t s debt rather than o n i t s p r io r i ty programs 

43. F ina l ly , an alternative scenario assumes large bo r row ing on concessional t e rm s (Ch ina scenario). 
Under this scenario, a $3 b i l l i o n bo r row ing o n concessional t e rm s accompanied by a $2 b i l l i o n FDI 
(‘joint venture) i s assumed, in l ine with the recent announcement by the authorities o f their intension 
to en ter in to such an arrangement. As l o n g as the bo r row ing i s on highly concessional te rms , the 
funds are used fo r produc t ive purposes in l i n e with the government’s pr ior i t ies , and disbursements are 
in l i n e with the country’s absorptive capacity, this arrangement cou ld be bene f ic ia l to the country, 
tr igger ing a higher g row th rate, accelerating expor t growth, and larger f isca l space, at least in i t ia l ly . 
In the medium term , the government saving wou ld decline substantially as the increase in n e t in te res t 
payments on fo re ign debt outpaces the increase in recurrent receipts. I t shou ld also be noted that 
DRC ’s debt stock w o u l d increase substantially reaching 94 percent o f GD P by 2026 even i f the loan 
i s concessional.

PART A.3. MANAG ING R I S K S - CAF DONOR GROUP 

Overall Approach 

44 . Engagement in apost-conflict context i s a high-risk, high-gain enterprise, but the risks of non- 

engagement exceed the risks of engagement. The situation in DRC remains difficult, but experience 
has shown that external assistance can yield disproportionate benefits in post-conflict countries, 
provided i t i s well targeted and efficiently provided. Consistent w i t h the donor strategies since 2001, 
the approach suggested here is based on pro-active r isk management rather than r isk avoidance. The 
risk management strategy i s three-fold: (i) warning mechanisms, to detect problems at an early stage; 
(ii) response mechanisms, to mitigate their immediate impact; and (iii) risk reduction mechanisms, to 
gradually reduce their likelihood and potential impact over time. I t should be emphasized, however, 
that in a post-conflict environment such as DRC, external assistance is aimed f i r s t and foremost at 
addressing the broader r isk of renewed conflict and instability. Risks should not be seen as external 
factors that may a f f e c t performance o f donor programs, but rather as the justification for and the focus 
o f such programs. In other words, reducing risk i s not only a way to improve performance; i t i s the 
main objective of donor support. I t should also be emphasized that the key to effectively managing 
risk i s a constructive relationship between donors and the Government. 

45 . Donors participating in the CAF w i l l be responsible for managing the risks to their own 

assistance programs. While the CAF provides a joint analysis o f key risks and a coordinated 
definition o f the risk management strategies, each donor w i l l implement i t s own risk management 
strategy, in terms o f defining what events or conditions may trigger a response and what exactly such 
a response would entail. CAF donors would engage in extensive consultations prior to making major 
decisions; however, the option o f a j o i n t action by a l l CAF donors has been deemed impractical in 
view o f their different decision-making and reporting arrangements. Table 4 i n Part B.3 lays out the 
risks, response actions, and risk reduction mechanisms common to a l l donors under the CAF, as well 
as those specific to the World Bank Group under the CAS.

PART B. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

PART B . l . REVIEW OF PAST BANK ASSISTANCE 

A. The Second Transitional Support Strategy 

46. Since reengaging with DRC in 2001, the Bank has provided assistance within the framework of 
two successive Transitional Support Strategies (TSS). The f i r s t , cove r ing the per iod 200 1-2003, 
focused on s tab i l iz ing the frag i le peace.8 The second strategy, wh ich d i rec t ly preceded the CAS, 
supported fou r key areas o f the Government’s program t o consolidate peace and economy recovery: 
(i) security and soc ia l stability, (ii) j o b creation through economic g row th and diversification; (iii) 
governance and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening; and ( iv) social development. Wh i le the program 
o r ig ina l ly covers FY04-06 , due t o elections, wh ich slowed down donor funding, the TSS e f fec t ive ly 
extended to also cover F Y 0 7 . 

B. Overall Assessment and Results o f TSS (Annex 4 fo r a detailed evaluation) 

47. Imp lemen ta t ion o f the second TSS was rated moderately satisfactory. The program was h igh ly 
relevant t o DRC ’s needs and a l igned with the Government’s pr ior i t ies , as expressed in i t s I-PRSP and 
economic program (see Annex 4.1). The Bank completed 11 ou t o f 13 Ana ly t ic and Adv iso ry 
Ac t iv i t ies (AAA) during the pe r iod (see Annex 4.2), cover ing a broad range o f sectors. Ou t o f 10 
projects, 2 are already closed and 8 are ongoing. The planned F Y 0 6 program was postponed beyond 
the TSS ho r izon because o f the elections. The current po r t fo l io stands at US$1 .7 b i l l ion , o f wh ich 
US$891 m i l l i o n has yet to be disbursed. The second TSS was also characterized by strong dialogue 
between the Bank and the Congolese authorities, as well as with c i v i l society and pr iva te sector 
stakeholders. The Bank also p layed a ma jor ro le in donor coordination, and together with other 
donors in i t ia ted a move towa rd harmonization. 

48. With regard to results, performance against the TSS indicators was mixed (see Annex 4.3). 
The TSS proposed a results framework consisting o f 19 performance indicators. Resu l ts were 
achieved pa r t ia l ly o r comp le te ly fo r 11 o f them. In the absence o f re l iab le statistical data, most 
indicators were defined in such as way that made quan t i f ica t ion d i f f icu l t , many r e s u l t s are 
never the less no tewor thy , inc lud ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty throughou t the period; a substantial leve l 
o f pr iva te investment; a mora tor ium on forestry concessions and a lega l rev iew o f those awarded in 
the past; the reopen ing o f key roads; and successful HIV ac t iv i t ies . These results are likely to be 
sustainable, but the i r eventual impac t w i l l depend on the success o f the peace process and the 
commitment o f the new Government. 

49. The Bank Group’s engagement has also had significant indirect results. As in other post- 
con f l ic t countries, the return o f donors and the launch o f large-scale assistance programs have sent a 
strong signal to the pr iva te sector about investment opportunities, to the protagonists in the con f l ic t 
about possible peace dividends, and to the popu la t ion at large about the poss ib i l i ty t o hope again. 
These developments have con tr ibu ted t o the stabilization o f the social s i tua t ion and to the resurgence 
o f economic ac t iv i ty .

50. Particular efforts have been devoted to livelihood and cultural issues facing people living in 

DRC forests, including Pygmies. The Bank began outreach e f for ts in 2004 and has expanded them 
since then. The Bank team regu lar ly : (i) meets with Pygmy groups t o exchange in fo rma t ion and seek 
their advice; (ii) inv i tes Pygmy representatives to events in wh ich issues tha t a f fec t their social and 
cu l tura l situation are discussed; and (iii) promotes the inc lus ion o f Pygmy groups in relevant forest 
regulations, ins t i tu t ions and decision-making bodies. Starting in 2005, Bank teams v is i ted Pygmy 
communities in Beni, Mutsora, Epulu and Rumangabo in the newly reun i f ied eastern provinces, in an 
e f fo r t to establish d irec t l i n e s o f communication. In 2006, the Bank fac i l i ta ted the collaboration o f 
D R C Pygmy representatives in a forest sector review in ne ighbor ing Repub l ic o f Congo. In April 
2007, the Bank helped organize the First In terna t iona l Central A f r ican Indigenous Peoples Meeting, 
in Brazzaville, Congo, and fac i l i ta ted the par t ic ipa t ion o f Pygmy representatives f r om D R C at this 
event. As par t o f the Bank’s enhanced engagement with Pygmy communities, a special study was 
undertaken in 2007 that w i l l support in tegra t ion o f these concerns in to the ove ra l l program o f the 
Bank . 

5 1. The Bank has wo rked closely with the Government to ensure that the new Forest Code recognizes 
and protects t rad i t iona l rights o f loca l communities, inc lud ing the Pygmies, in a l l produc t ion forests. 
W i t h the encouragement o f the Bank, the Government has inc luded Pygmy representatives in the 
In ter-m in is ter ia l Comm i t tee in charge o f the lega l rev iew o f concessions. This par t ic ipa t ion aims to 
help guarantee preservation o f the rights o f Pygmies in produc t ion forests and ensure that boundaries 
and management plans take in to account their social, economic, and cu l tu ra l needs. Bank e f for ts are 
intended to defend the in te res ts and rights o f the Congolese people, inc lud ing Pygmy populations, by 
canceling i l lega l concessions, strengthening the moratorium, supporting the services o f independent 
observers in the lega l review and in field controls, and p romo t ing the par t ic ipa t ion o f Pygmy 
representatives in the lega l review. This i s par t icu lar ly impor tan t in a coun try with serious 
ins t i tu t iona l and po l icy weaknesses. 

C . Review o f I D A Activities 

M a jo r Achievements o f the TSS 

52. The IDA program has had three objectives - reconstitute the country’s knowledge base, 
support the preparation of key sector reforms, and provide the analytic underpinning for 

financing. The Bank has delivered most o f the lend ing and AAA program proposed in 2004. Some 
delays were caused by problems typ ica l o f a pos t-con f l ic t environment, inc lud ing capacity constraints 
on the Borrower ’s side, the form idab le log is t ica l challenges associated with the size o f the country, 
and the s low-down o f ac t iv i t ies in t h e po l i t ica l environment lead ing up to t h e 2006 elections. Delays 
have also been caused by IDA allocations constraints, especially in FY05.

5 3 . The program has been satisfactory in strategic relevance (clear objectives, good alignment with 
TSS); internal quality (good analytic quality); coherence and integration (strong integration w i th 
lending); 
likely impact (effective reconstitution o f the knowledge base and ownership o f 
recommendations by the authorities); dialogue (strong engagement w i t h clients); and dissemination 
(with substantive managerial 
attention).

Box 9 . E a r l y Results o f Ongoing Projects 

O f the 10 ongoing projects in the portfolio, one i s yet to become effective, and the remaining 9 have an 
average age o f 3.2 years. O f those 9 projects, one - the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration 
Project - i s 99 percent disbursed, and 3 others - the Emergency Multisector Rehabilitation and 
Reconstruction Project, the Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project, and the Emergency 
Reunification Project - are more than 70 percent disbursed. 
These projects, based on mon i tor ing and supervision reports, have had the fo l low ing early impacts: 

Infrastructure - rehabilitation o f the ma in road, feeder roads, schools, and water treatment facilities; 
improved quality and coverage o f health serv ices ; reduction in environmental impacts f i om soil erosion. 
P r iva te sector development - re form o f legal, administrative, and jud ic ia l environment; adopting o f 
Investment Code and establishment o f commercial courts.

5 8 . The Bank has worked closely with other donors to ensure coordination in assistance. Toward 
the end o f the period, this coord ina t ion transitioned to harmonization, with the development o f a j o i n t 
strategy and programm ing document, the CAF , the basis o f donor funding in D R C fo r the com ing 
years. The Bank has also wo rked co l labora t ive ly on the pro jec t l e v e l - on demob i l iza t ion and 
reintegration under the Mu l t i -Coun t ry Demob i l iza t ion and Re in tegra t ion Framework; and forestry 
sector re fo rm under the Mu l t i -Dono r Trust Fund framework. This poo l ing o f resources and exper t ise 
has proven essential in comp lex projects. 

5 9 . Based on its increasing knowledge of operational issues in conflict-affected countries, the 
Bank has pu t in p lace a number of mechanisms to scale up assistance in countries in recovering 
f rom conflict. D R C has benefited, in particular, f rom the Bank’s alternative se t o f indicators for 
measuring the performance o f con f l ic t-a f fec ted countries (Pos t-Con f l ic t Performance Indicators - 
PCPI); i t s mechanisms fo r arrears clearance; pre-arrears grants; and f r om access to the enhanced 
H I PC in i t ia t ive . I F C and MIGA are also deve lop ing instruments to scale up their ac t iv i t ies in con f l ic t- 
affected countries. These have been highly e f fec t ive in DRC . Con t inued engagement i s necessary, 
especially as D R C moves in to a pos t-con f l ic t s tab i l iza t ion per iod . 

Difficulties and Challenges under the T S S 

60. Despite these achievements, 70 percent of 
D R C automatically have tw o flags ( fo r

and i t on ly takes a single pro jec t-spec i f ic

flags; two projects have one pro jec t-spec i f ic 
flag; and four have more than two pro jec t- 
specific flags, with the r e s u l t that more than 
50 percent o f the active po r t fo l io has three 
or more flags (coun try environment and

62. The evaluation of the three projects closed during the TSSper iod was mixed One project (the 
Post-Reunification Econom ic Recovery Credit) was rated unsatisfactory f o r qua l i ty at entry, Bank 
performance, and Bo r rowe r performance. The Emergency Ea r ly Recovery Pro jec t was rated 
satisfactory across the board; and the Transitional Support fo r Econom ic Recovery was rated 
unsatisfactory. 

63. A number of projects have come under scrutiny from the Bank’s Inspection Panel. An 
inspection was carr ied between 2005-2007 with regard to compliance with safeguards related to 
indigenous peoples and emergency projects. Env ironmen ta l and soc ia l safeguards guidelines have 
been developed f o r the existing por t fo l io . ’o 

64. The sensitive nature of certain sectors in D R C - particularly forestry and mining - have 
created reputational risks for the Bank, and brought heavy scrutiny from outside stakeholders. In 
the m in ing sector, IDA and I F C have been encouraged t o be much more fo rce fu l with regard to 
transparency. In MIGA, there have been tw o in terna l investigations. A f t e r a rebe l l ion against D R C 
authorities in the t ow n o f K i l w a (in Katanga Province), du r ing w h i c h about 100 Congolese were 
k i l led , several NGOs alleged that A n v i l M i n i n g S.A. - the bene f ic iary o f a MIGA guarantee - was 
comp l ic i t in these deaths by a l low ing the use o f mining vehicles by the F A R D C (DRC’s army) to 
help put down the rebe l l ion . T w o in terna l investigations took place to consider MIGA’s invo lvemen t 
in the project; one inves t iga t ion found n o wrongdo ing by MIGA, and the other inves t iga t ion has no t 
yet been closed.

E. Review o f M I G A Activities 

66 . MIGA’s engagement in DRC has been relatively limited, but this w i l l likely change in the near 

term. Since 200 1, MIGA has supported on ly one project, with US$15 m i l l i o n in guarantee support to 
A n v i l Mining SA, a copper-cobalt fac i l i ty in Katanga prov ince . With the project’s commercial 
success, MIGA n ow has a strong pipeline o f mining projects go ing forward . MIGA has also been 
asked to support projects in the IT, rea l estate, and heavy equipment sectors. In addition, MIGA 
through FIAS (wh ich n ow includes the ex-MIGA technical assistance team) has been complementing 
IDA’S f inanc ia l support to ANAP I , DRC ’s investment p romo t ion agency. 

F. Lessons Learned and Recommendation f o r I FC and M IGA 

67. The lessons learned through the implementation of 

the TSS program point to a series of 

recommendations, wh ich have been discussed extensively by the coun try team and are incorporated 
in the proposed strategy. These recommendations are: 

Early engagement is c r i t ica l . The Bank ’s qu ick engagement in 200 1 sen t a strong message to the 
Government, responsible investors, and to the Congolese popu la t ion at large that there i s hope fo r 
a better future. The speed with wh ich the f i r s t Emergency pro jec t was prepared ( two months) 
was essential to ensuring s tab i l i ty . Tha t pro jec t showed that progress can be made even in the 
early stages o f engagement. 
Engagement must be sustained. Consistent engagement at the sector l e v e l provides support t o 
reformers, necessary t o overcome ine r t ia and prevent po l icy reversal. In-and-ou t interventions 
may inadver ten t ly send a message that a c r i t ica l sector is , in fact, no t an impor tan t p r io r i ty fo r the 
Bank and thus need no t be a p r io r i ty fo r the country. Bank support o f governance reforms has 
been cr i t ica l , especially in naturaVpublic resources management. However, re forms in these areas 
take time, vested interests are strong, and progress in a pos t-con f l ic t context i s frag i le . 
Implementation is possible. Despite s ign i f ican t challenges, projects can be implemented in a 
d i f f icu l t pos t-con f l ic t environment. 
Strong dialogue w i th Government is vital. Bank-Governmen t dialogue has been v i t a l to 
launching the re fo rm agenda. Hands-on po l icy advice has been essential in helping Congolese 
authorities t o define and implement in-depth economic and governance re forms despite their l o w 
administrative capacity. Hav ing s ta f f present in-coun try i s impor tan t to so l id i fy the relationship. 
Donor collaboration and coordination are imperative. Due t o the wide range o f pressing 
concerns and the vast amount o f resources required, it i s necessary to w o r k c lose ly with other 
development actors o n strategic planning, to ensure that resources are consolidated and that 
donors p rov ide support in areas in wh ich they have a comparative advantage. 
There needs to a gradual shiftfiom donor coordination to harmonization, in order to improve a id 
effectiveness in an environment where administrative capacity i s limited. 
Collaboration w i th c iv i l society is important. C i v i l society and loca l commun i t ies are the u l t ima te 
beneficiaries o f Bank interventions. Engagement with c i v i l society can be very productive, and 
o f ten c i v i l society has expe r t ise and access that the Bank does n o t have. In DRC , i t has been 
important t o tap in to this know ledge base in comp l ica ted sectors such as mining and forestry t o 

counterbalance vested interests and strengthen the po l i t ica l de term ina t ion fo r reforms. I t i s also 
c r i t ica l that in fo rma t ion on the Bank’s processes be shared among and well-understood b y 
different stakeholders. A proac t ive commun ica t ion strategy i s key, especially in complex and 
sensitive sectors. 
I n post-conflict countries, M IGA should deploy resources earlier, in order t o contribute to the 
peace dividend. 
IFC should also coordinate more closely w i th I D A and M G A , especially as 
pr iva te sector ac t iv i ty increases over the com ing years. 
Special efforts are needed to manage fiduciary risks in a post-conflict environment. Except in the 
very early stages, the Bank needs t o begin to use and strengthen the key government f inanc ia l 
management, procurement and oversight systems needed fo r the longer t e rm . W h i l e there w i l l 
always be projects requ i r ing stand alone f iduc iary arrangements, mos t projects need to have an 
agreed p lan o f ac t ion to mainstream these arrangements fo r successor ac t iv i t ies and programs. As 
the amount o f resources deployed on the ground increases, Bank capacity to prov ide 
implementation support outside Kinshasa also needs t o keep pace, recogn iz ing the special 
log is t ica l and security challenges this presents. 
Focus on results is always useful, but not always as easy to predict in apos t conflict environment. 
Wh i le the Bank team has consistently demonstrated a strong comm i tmen t t o resu l ts , these resu l ts 
have been somewhat disconnected f rom the performance 
indicators against wh ich TSS 
implementation has been measured. The CAS Resu l ts M a t r i x has been designed t o more closely 
re f lec t the expected r e s u l t s f rom our combined ana ly t ica l wo rk and f inanc ing and as a means o f 
mon i to r ing progress. 
Capacity constraints remain a major barrier to development in DRC. T o max im ize the effective 
use o f scarce government capacity, a rev iew o f the po r t fo l io i s p lanned in ear ly 2008, and any 
necessary adjustments and related capacity development and techn ica l support w i l l be proposed 
as a result. Dono r harmon iza t ion around sector wide approaches and strategies w i l l also help 
make more e f fec t ive use o f government’s ins t i tu t iona l capacity. 
Better data gathering capacity is required. E f fo r ts must be made to increase data-gathering 
capacity across imp lemen t ing agencies, to fac i l i ta te po l icy mak ing and program implementation. 
The W o r l d Bank G roup intends to enhance i t s focus on resu l ts by suppor t ing development o f a 
Na t iona l Strategy f o r the Deve lopmen t o f Statistics with a Trust Fund fo r Statistical Capacity 
Building. This w i l l be coordinated with other Bank Group e f for ts (e.g. techn ica l assistance, bo th 
freestanding and through projects) and with other donors (e.g. A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t Bank. 
Joint implementation support together w i th other donors is being explored This i s par t icu lar ly

PART B.2. BANK STRATEGY FOR FYOS-FY11 

A. Objective and Expected Results 

6 8 . The overall objective of 
the proposed Bank Group’s program is to lav the foundation for a 
medium-term Dover& reduction effort, with a strong focus on governance and shared growth. 

6 9 . The CAS has been articulated around a results framework derived from the jo int C A F results 
framework (see V o l . 2 , Annex 5). The results-based approach i s designed t o help focus the Bank 
Group’s e f for ts and i t s dialogue with the authorities and other partners o n a clear se t o f measurable 
objectives. A ma jo r challenge i s t o select adequate performance ind ica tors in a coun try where there i s 
no re l iab le statistical system. 
In this context, the CAS proposes a se t o f second-best indicators 
selected on the basis o f the i r s imp l ic i ty and easy measurability, comb in ing outcome and output 
measures. Progress against these indicators w i l l be assessed o n a regular basis through consultations 
with the Government, key Congolese stakeholders, and donors, t o ensure that Bank Group programs 
are managed fo r r e s u l t s and focused o n mak ing a measurable d i f ference o n the ground. 

B. Key Principles 

7 0 . The CAS is derived from the PRSP, and actions proposed under the C A S are closely aligned 
w i t h PRSP pr ior i t ies . The C A S proposes t o focus on ac t iv i t ies with the highest po ten t ia l impac t in 
areas in wh ich the Bank G roup has a mandate and expertise. 

7 1 . The CAS is part of 
the multi-donor Country Assistance Framework, a broader international 
e f fo r t that has clear objectives and mon i to r ing indicators. This w i l l p rov ide increased leverage fo r the 
Bank effort, a l low fo r the e f f ic ien t use o f l im i ted resources, and help m i t iga te the r i s k s to the Bank. 

7 2 . The CAS i s based on an assessment of 
the Bank Group’s comparative advantage in DRC , 
wh ich consists o f a comb ina t ion o f analytic strength, f inanc ing capacity, and conven ing power. 

7 3 . F ina l ly , the CAS is prepared in the broader context of 
the Africa Action P lan (AAP), wh ich 
defines an outcome-base strategic framework built around three p r inc ip les - imp rove governance and 
b u i l d capable states; accelerate economic growth; and ensure tha t the poo r and women are able to 
participate in and bene f i t f r om grow th . C A S i s based on these same three pr inc ip les . 

C. Planned Activities by Other Dono rs 

7 4 . Not a l l donors have confirmed their funding for the CAF . However, it appears that the Bank, 
together with the African Development bank, the European Commission, the Republic of Ch ina 
and the UK w i l l be key donors. I n d i a and South A f r i c a may p rov ide support to the forestry, mining, 
energy and infrastructure sectors. Human i tar ian assistance i s expected to continue at least through 
part o f this pe r iod f r om the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and the United States. 

7 5 . Funding estimates are about US$3 billion over the CAF period, inc lud ing some ongo ing 
projects. This assistance s t i l l fa l ls short o f the country’s needs, but with increased coordination, 

- 33 - 

available funds a re likely to be used more cost effectively i n a more efficient and cost-effective 
manner." 

D. Strategic Elements o f the Bank Group Program 

76 . Given its comparative advantages, the Bank Group w i l l play a lead role, jointly with other 
the f ive core areas outlined in the CAF - good governance, shared and 
donors, in three of 
sustainable growth, and improved social services. On governance, this w i l l be together with the EC 

and UNDP; on the macro-economy, together with the IMF; and on facilitating private sector 
development (investments i n transport and energy, access to credit, institutional and regulatory 
reforms), this w i l l be together with EC and ADB. The Bank Group w i l l play a supportive role in 
other areas, such as basic social services, HIV/AIDS, and community dynamics, although help lead 
and coordinate donor efforts toward development o f sector wide approaches (SWAps) in education 
and health. 

77 . Although the Bank w i l l focus mainly on three pillars, we have outlined Bank Group assistance 

aroundf ive strategic elements that reflect the five pillars o f the PRSP. A l l five areas are closely 
inter-related, so that progress in one area depends closely on progress in the others. While the Bank's 
ongoing portfolio covers a l l five pillars, the new program w i l l focus more selectively on three pillars 
going forward. 

Strategic element I : Promote good governance and consolidate peace. 

78 . The Bank Group w i l l support implementation of 

the Governance Contract, by helping to 

improve transparency, strengthen public finance management, reform the public service and ass is t the 
government in the decentralization process. 

He lp improve transparency. 

IDA w i l l focus on: (i) enhancing transparency in public 
f inanc ia l management, through regular publication o f budget execution data; (ii) building 
open and inclusive systems o f provincial level governance, through capacity building, and 
advisory support; and as an element o f public sector enterprise reform; (iii) financing a se r ies 
o f audits (e.g. o f public enterprises) and surveys; and (iv) assist in developing and 
implementing the E IT I action plan for DRC. 

Strengthen public f inance management. IDA i s expected to share the lead with the IMF, 
focusing in implementing the recommendations o f the 2007 Public Expenditure Review, 
especially: (i) strengthening the expenditure chain; (ii) introducing a Medium Term Budget 
Planning system, including capacity building in l i n e ministries; (iii) building systems and 
strengthening capacity for public financial management at provincial level; (iv) strengthening 
the capacity o f revenue agencies, and; (v) completing the ongoing procurement reform. I n 
this area activities w i l l be implemented in c lose cooperation with DfID and the French 
Cooperation. 

Support public service reform. 

IDA, together with the Belgian Cooperation and South 
Africa, intends to focus on: (i) supporting wage system reform, to enhance transparency and 
predictability o f public sector wages; (ii) creating a roster o f civil and public servants; (iii) 

l1 The Bank Group's assistance to the in f ias t ruc tu re sectors might need to be adjusted in view o f the recen t 

protocol o f understanding that the Government o f DRC signed with the Government o f China, reportedly up t o 

$5 b i l l ion o f fmancing for transport in f ias t ruc tu re , mining concessions, and other investments. 

- 34 - 

implementing and ro l l ing out the new payroll system, including in the provinces; (iv) 
redefining the roles, mandates, and organizational s t ruc tu res o f selected key public 
institutions; (v) assisting w i th development o f mechanisms and systems for the transfer o f 
public servants to provincial and sub-provincial level, and; (vi) developing effective 
personnel management systems a t provincial level. 

He lp manage the decentralization process. I D A in close collaboration w i th the EC, UNDP 
and bilateral donors w i l l focus on: (i) helping to develop the legal, financial and regulatory 
framework for a success fu l decentralization process, including for the planned administrative- 
territorial reorganization process; (ii) building capacity a t provincial level, especially as 
regards public expenditure management; (iii) creating a professional and effective public 
service system a t the provincial and local levels, and (iv); supporting provinces in the design 
and implementation o f development projects at provincial level, under financing by the 
Caisse Nationale de Pe're'quation. 

7 9 . The Bank Group w i l l continue to support demobilization of ex-combatants and their successful 
reintegration into civilian life. 

Strategic element 2: He lp consolidate macroeconomic stability and economic growth. 

80. The Bank Group w i l l support efforts to achieve high, sustained, and shared economic growth, 
by helping to: 

Improve debt, inflation andf isca l management. I D A working closely w i th the IMF, w i l l 
focus on increasing revenues and strengthening f i s c a l discipline in spending ministries; 
Ensure that the ground i s la id for medium-term growth in the agriculture sector. The 
African Development Bank i s taking the lead in this area. IDA 'S assistance w i l l focus on (i) 
reducing insecurity (through reintegration o f former combatants); (ii) providing targeted 
support to farmers, including inputs and assets, to help increase production and productivity; 
and (iii) the delivery o f key agricultural services. IFC may also provide investments in agro- 
business. 
Improve natura l resource management - in the forestry sector, through support to 
government policies and agencies for enforcement o f strong environmental standards for 
logging and the involvement o f communities in monitoring forestry activities; and in the 
mining sector, by support for implementation o f a sound regulatory framework, improving 
transparency, reform o f GECAMINES, and defining a strategy and implementing a p i lo t 
program to deal w i th artisanal mining. 
Ensure that economic growth is not achieved at the expense of the long term environment 
damage. IDA w i l l manage a multi-donor trust fund to support forest governance, and support 
Government in i t s implementation o f the Forest and Na tu re Conservation Sector Program, in 
order to bring more transparency and public participation to forest management and ensure 
more equitable sharing o f benefits. 
Rehabilitate transport infrastructure. 
I D A w i l l focus f i r s t on the physical rehabilitation o f 
roads to major urban centers, and on export corridofs from mining areas; and then on 
reforming the transport state-owned en te rp r ises (SOEs), in coordination w i t h ADB, AFD, the 
Belgian Cooperation, as we l l IFC, M IGA , and the Republic o f China. 

- 35 - 

Increase the availability of electricpower. The Bank Group w i l l play a prominent ro le in the 
rehabilitation and expansion o f generation, transmission and distribution systems and the 
reform o f the state-owned power company. IDA w i l l also support central DRC’s r o l e within 
the development o f regional networks, and IFC and M IGA w i l l support private investment in 

the sector. 

Increaseprivate investment. IDA, with advisory support from IFC and MIGA, w i l l focus on 
modernization o f the legal and regulatory framework, and working with business associations 
to identify and remove regulatory or enforcement bottlenecks. 
Increase access to f inanc ia l services. IDA w i l l support completion o f the ongoing financial 
sector reform; and w i l l also set up transitional mechanisms to provide credit to the private 
sector in the interim period. IFC and MIGA w i l l provide support to private banks interested 
in investing in DRC. 
Support private sector-led growth in manufacturing and services. The Bank Group i s 
expected to play a prominent role, to help leverage private finance for the massive 
investments needed. IDA w i l l focus on key infrastructure and regulatory constraints to private 
sector activity; IFC w i l l continue to provide financial support t o reputable private investors, 
with a view to significantly scaling up its interventions; and M IGA w i l l continue to offer 
guarantees to reputable private investors. 
Reform of public sector enterprises. Many o f these enterprises have not been subject to 
adequate oversight for many decades and a well designed and implemented public enterprise 
reform program i s central to ensuring sustainable and equitable economic development, and 
for crowding in the necessary private investment. As such, Bank Group assistance to this 
reform, including t o individual enterprises, would be tied to a clear reform agenda whereby 
investment i s subordinated to reform steps that introduce commercial practices, and envisage, 
if possible, public private partnership. 

Strategic element 3: He lp improve the provision of social services and reduce vulnerability. 

8 1. The Bank Group w i l l support the social development priorities articulated in the PRSP, by 
helping to increase public spending in support o f key social sectors. In particular, IDA w i l l help to : 

Improve the overall education system in Congo, with support to Government to articulate 
its overall education strategy, and to identijy efforts 
in secondary, technical and tertiary 
education that complement the continued focus on primary education quality and coverage 
by strengthening the institutional and financial capacity o f the sector and designing a r e s u l t s - 
oriented and fundable strategy fo r sector development. 
Increase access to health care by contracting independent service providers to oversee the 
delivery o f essen t ia l health services in targeted health zones; and developing a system to 
monitor and evaluate the performance o f service providers. IDA w i l l also help to identify 
financing options fo r the health system, strengthen the capacity o f provincial and district 
health authorities, support malaria control interventions in coordination with the Global Fund, 
and help the Government promote family planning. 
Increase access to clean water and sanitation in urban areas, by supporting reforms to 
strengthen the performance, accountability, and f inanc ia l viability o f the state-owned water 
company; and by financing the rehabilitation o f damaged systems in selected c i t ies . 

- 36 - 

0 Stabilize the social situation and improve the lives of vulnerable populations in urban 

areas, by f inanc ing the rehabilitation, development, and upgrad ing o f key mun ic ipa l 
infrastructure; enhancing the de l ivery o f basic services in the poorest urban areas; supporting 
improvements in mun ic ipa l management; and p rov id ing emp loymen t opportunities for urban 
poor through labor-intensive activities. 

Strategic element 4: He lp combat H IW A I D S . 

82. Other donors w i l l take the lead in this a rea I D A w i l l work closely with the Global Fund t o 

ensure e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion o f i t s operations, with a focus o n supporting prevention efforts; 
imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i f e o f in fec ted persons; and m i t iga t ing the impac t o f the epidemic on 
vulnerable populations. Bank support w i l l be prov ided through the ongo ing IDA - funded H I V / A I D S 
Project. 

Strategic element 5: He lp promote community dynamics. 

8 3 . The Bank Group w i l l support the work of other institutions with more experience in this area, 
such as the UN agencies. The Bank Group, through the ongo ing IDA-funded Social Fund Project, 
w i l l focus on ensuring the e f fec t ive invo lvemen t o f communities 
in the preparation and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank Group ac t iv i t ies that may affect them; and o n helping to prevent the 
dispersion o f donor efforts, through active IDA par t ic ipa t ion in donor coord ina t ion mechanisms. 

84. The Bank group is giving special attention to Indigenous Peoples.'2 As pa r t o f this broader 

e f fo r t t o reach Pygmy populations, the Congolese authorities, together with the Bank, have been 
analyzing the Emergency Social A c t i o n Project's experience in p rov id ing access o f poor and 
vulnerable groups t o social and economic services - this i s be ing imp lemen ted through the Social 
Fund. During the f i r s t phase o f the pro jec t (2002-2006) i t had become clear tha t Indigenous Peoples 
were ha rd ly benefiting f r om these investments. Consultations were undertaken with 655 Indigenous 
Peoples and representatives f r om NGO s in the context o f 19 workshops a l l over the country. The 
project i s n ow putting in place an outreach and capac i ty-bu i ld ing program t o assist Indigenous 
Peoples' communities access and u t i l ize pro jec t funds to obtain schools, hea l th clinics, ru ra l roads, 
and water points, based o n their demands. I t i s also analyzing ways in w h i c h the pro jec t can 
strengthen the vo ice and par t ic ipa t ion o f Pygmy communities. 

85. The for thcom ing IDA - f inanced Forest Project, GEF Grant fo r Na t iona l Parks, and the MDTF w i l l 
seek to ensure that Pygmies en joy equal access t o rights and socio-economic opportunities resu l t ing 
f rom the new Forest Code, such as the right t o manage commun i ty forests and to benefit f rom social 
respons ib i l i ty contracts. The fo r thcom ing Ag r icu l tu re Project i s expected to inc lude s im i lar prov is ions 
with regard to agriculture rehabilitation, while the new Road Sector Rehab i l i ta t ion Project i s expected

to include an Indigenous Peoples Framework that builds on and expands work initiated under the 
Emergency Recovery Project. 

E. Instruments f o r Bank Group Assistance 

Managing the existing I D A portfolio 

86. Achieving better synergies with the existing Bank porifolio. Most o f the ongoing projects are 
multisector emergency operations prepared under OP 8.00 (Rapid Response to Cr ises and 
Emergencies). Under this CAS, IDA expects to fully transition from emergency to more standard 
financing and institutional arrangements. I n this context, early on in the CAS period, IDA s t a f f w i l l 
work with the authorities to restructure the portfolio, with the objective o f strengthening capacity 
utilization, putting in place fiduciary controls that increasingly rely on government systems and 
institutions. This should help streamline project and program implementation, and f r e e up both 
government and Bank resources to support new analytical activities and operations, and intensify 
IDA ’S advice and technical support to mainstreamed government  institution^,'^ i n order to build more 
sustainable capacity for effective implementation. 

87. Support for implementation of ongoing activities w i l l remain the f i rs t and foremost priority for 
IDA. With about US$1 .7 billion in commitments, the DRC program i s the third largest in Africa, and 
i t s effective implementation i s critical to getting results in the CAS period (projects already underway 
provide the most scope to translate in to results on the ground in the coming years). As for other post- 
conflict countries in Africa and elsewhere, the portfolio i s being implemented in an environment 
where intense hands-on implementation support i s essen t ia l to achieve results and ensure 
transparency. Efforts w i l l focus on improving overall portfolio performance and helping turn-around 
problem projects. While efforts to coordinate this work with other donors may lead to reduced IDA 
administrative costs over time, donor collaboration i s not expected to produce any n e t savings over 
the CAS period. 

8 8 . Particular attention w i l l continue to be pa id to fiduciary issues, including during the planned 
portfolio restructuring exercise. Bank management w i l l highlight governance and corruption in its 
dialogue with the authorities, including ensuring that agreed recommendations from both the draft 
Public Expenditure Review and the INT report and the planned management audit o f BCECO are 
implemented in a timely fashion. The Bank takes a zero tolerance approach to misuse o f i t s 
resources, and would ask the Congolese authorities to severely sanction cases o f fraud. 

8 9 . I n this context, during the porifolio restructuring exercise I D A expects to review how best to 
mainstream project implementation, while safeguarding fiduciary oversight. To date, a l l IDA- 
financed projects a re implemented through P IUs . One o f these, the Bureau Central de Coordination 
(BCECO), has played a major role in implementation and in providing project implementation advice 
to other units. L i n e ministries have been involved in the design phase and as beneficiaries, but so far 
have been granted very limited fiduciary responsibilities during implementation. While the transfer o f 
responsibilities to l i n e ministries i s desirable i n principle, their current capacity i s generally 

13 

We w i l l be experimenting, in some o f the new projects (e.g., Pro-Routes, Education), with the u s e o f PIUs 

integrated within the ministries. 

- 3 8 - 

inadequate to provide su f f ic ien t comfort on fiduciary issues . 
In an environment where the 
overwhelming priority i s to maintain fiduciary integrity, the CAS recommends a continued re l iance 
on skilled and ring-fenced structures for a l l fiduciary matters. To the extent possible, l i n e ministries 
should benefit from capacity building programs and gradually play a stronger role (e.g., for techn ica l 
aspects o f design or supervision, on a case-by-case basis) - but no fiduciary responsibility should be 
transferred before sufficient capacity i s in place. 

90 . IDA also intends to increase its implementation support in DRC, especially outside of 

Kinshasa. W i th a growing number o f activities underway in the provinces, regular field visits are 
c r i t i c a l to ensure proper oversight o f IDA-financed activities. This is , however, no minor endeavor in 
a country w i th formidable logistical constraints. As indicated above, while direct Bank oversight i s 
feasible o f large contracts (typically road works), i t i s much l e s s practical for e i ther cen tra l 
government or financing agencies to oversee implementation o f a mu l t ip l ic i ty o f relatively small 
contracts (e.g., rebuilding a school in a rural district). Therefore, IDA w i l l leverage oversight in a 
number o f ways, including agreement w i th the authorities on financing independent techn ica l audits; 
mobilizing the provincial authorities’ support in making sure projects in their provinces deliver 
results; reaching out to other donors for jo in t oversight and providing support to networks such as 
religious organizations capable o f channeling feedback from beneficiaries. 

9 1. I n parallel, IDA w i l l strengthen its Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems. In l i n e w i th the 

AAP recommendations, I D A intends to update the M&E frameworks for ongoing projects during the 
planned portfolio restructuring exercise in 2008, w i th a view to making u s e o f new information, 
processes and performance measurement, s ince their approval. IDA w i l l continue to pay attention to 
improving the reliability o f the r e s u l t s framework o f new operations, bearing in mind that data and 
data gathering are not optimal and system wide improvements w i l l take time. 

92 . Effective portfolio management requires a strong presence in the j i e l d . The Country Office i s 

playing a key role in this respect. Finding the right internationally- and locally- recruited professional 
s t a f f for the workprogram, based in Kinshasa, has proven d i f f icu l t . While the re has been progress, 
more can be done to get more high qualified staff, and ensure they have the authority and the support 
to do their work. 
IDA i s committed to a three- t ier approach: locating in Kinshasa the Country 
Director, along w i th additional experienced techn ica l staff, eg 
in infrastructure, portfolio 
management, financial management, share techn ica l s t a f f already in the region w i th in easy travel 
distance from DRC, and maintain a strong support capacity at Headquarters. The CAS evisages that 
the DRC office staffing w i l l grow gradually along these l i n e s and w i th due attention to maintaining 
the quality o f the team. 

Carrying out I D A analytical work 

93 . As recommended in the AAP, IDA w i l l deepen its analytical and advisory work in DRC, 

together w i th development partners, to support strengthened, result-oriented national strategies.

In the immediate re-

the authorities on broad strategic approaches for each sector. A key focus o f IDA’s ana ly t ica l 
resources w i l l be devoted to governance-related work in FY08, specifically f inance public 
management and decentralization (see Table 2). Starting also in FY08, IDA w i l l broaden the 
analytical focus to general economic work, to help the country update i t s medium-term development 
strategy, w i th an average o f t h r e e deliverables per year, comparable to the average o f three for past 
three years.

96. The preferred strategic choice is to continue to provide a high level offinancial assistance to 

D R C consistent with IDA rules. A l t e r n a t i v e op t ions c o u l d emerge as a r e s u l t o f b a c k s l i d i n g o n 
governance o r o n econom ic management, o r an a l terna t ive deve lopmen t strategy pursued by 

l5 T im ing o f budget support operation depends on authorities’ progress in imp rov ing fiduciary controls and 
strengthening pub l ic fmancial management, as demonstrated b y concrete re form resu l ts . The draft PER (08) 
provides u s e f u l milestones over an 18 - 24 month period for this purpose: (i) compliance with budget calendar 
and preparation o f realistic budget reflecting sector priorities; (ii) removing manual s teps to expenditure c i rcu i t 
( l a chaine de l a dkpense) to reduce the processing time for normal expenditures; and (iii) l im i t ing the use o f 
emergency procedures to t r u e emergencies.

mor tgag ing i t s fu ture na tura l resource revenues. Depending o n the seriousness o f the backsliding, 
this cou ld result in the WBGroup ’s pa r t ia l or full disengagement. Absent s ign i f ican t backsliding, 
pa r t ia l disengagement i s no t a recommended option, as i t wou ld reduce IDA’S leverage and impact, 
w i thou t substantially reduc ing i t s exposure in the short-term (since the re i s a large po r t fo l io under 
implementation). I t cou ld be seen t o contribute to weakening the peace process and reg iona l stability. 
Full disengagement w o u l d send a strong signal o f disconnect between the authorities and the Bank on 
i t s development strategy and performance, something no t warranted by the economic reforms and - 
albeit limited - progress, and also unnecessarily weaken a ye t untested Government. I t wou ld likely 
have a s ign i f ican t impac t on p r iva te sector behavior and on other in terna t iona l partners who wou ld be 
hard pressed to understand such action. 
I t wou ld s ign i f ican t ly weaken wha t has been an 
internationally-supported and re la t ive ly successful po l i t ica l process at a c r i t ica l moment. The risks 
associated with this approach are very h i g h fo r D R C as well as fo r the Bank ’s reputation. Neither 
op t ion i s recommended. 

97. As recommended in the CAS, the appropriate leve l o f IDA support during this per iod wou ld 
s tr ic t ly adhere to the IDA a l loca t ion r u l e s . As a pos t-con f l ic t country, D R C receives exceptional 
f inanc ia l support f r om IDA, above wha t i t wou ld receive under IDA’S Performance Based A l loca t ion 
System. Beginning in FY07 , however, exceptional support started t o be phased out. In FY08 , IDA i s 
p rov id ing around SDR 148.5 m i l l i o n to DRC , after accounting f o r some fron t- load ing o f resources 
under IDA 14. Go ing forward, IDA pos t-con f l ic t supplemental a l loca t ion t o D R C w i l l continue to be 
phased out, to reach no rma l performance-based allocations during the C A S per iod . l6 F ina l ly , since 
D R C i s in debt d is tress , i t w i l l receive i t s a l loca t ion in the f o rm o f grants. T o the extent D R C became 
eligible fo r add i t iona l forms o f IDA f inanc ing under IDA 16, the f inanc ing envelope wou ld be 
adjusted accordingly. 

9 8 . A second strategic choice is to adjust thefinancing instruments used in DRCgo ing forward, on 
the basis o f lessons learned and changes in the overa l l environment. Firstly, a l l new IDA - f inanced 
programs and projects i s expected to incorporate a strong re fo rm component (beyond reconstruction 
activities). As a consequence, i t i s expected to have few o r no mu l t i-sec tor operations beyond the 
poss ib i l i ty o f general budget support, and focus on sector specific programs and projects. Secondly, 
there appears to be n o foreseeable rationale fo r new emergency projects processed under OP8.0 (on 
rap id response to crises and emergencies), un less the s i tua t ion in eastern Congo deteriorates 
s ign i f ican t ly . Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) may be used, with care taken to avo id ma jor 
imp l ic i t commitments fo r the post-CAS per iod when the IDA a l loca t ion w i l l be reduced. Also, to 
build on success, add i t iona l f inanc ing w i l l be systematically considered fo r we l l-per form ing 
operations in need o f f o l l ow up. Thirdly, in order to focus limited Bank adm in is tra t ive resources, i t i s 
un l ike ly that sma l l grants (under the Pos t-Con f l ic t Fund or the Ins t i tu t iona l Deve lopmen t Fund) w i l l 
be used. And f ina l ly , pro jec t and program design w i l l make full u s e o f the f l e x i b i l i t y a l lowed under 
the new Coun try F inanc ing Parameters, and place a strong emphasis on p romo t ing transparency and 
accountability. 

99. Overall, I D A expects to f inance a series of operations in the years FYO8-FYI1 in support of the 
CAS strategic objectives. A l i s t o f these operations i s prov ided in Table 3, w h i c h may be adjusted 

16 

Under IDA 15, the post-conflict phase-out period may be extended from the current t h r e e t o six years. I f this 

happens, DRC may r e c e i v e exceptional support fiom I D A for another t h r e e years, in l i n e with i t s performance.

sector po l icy component, each o f these projects i s expected t o incorporate governance concerns, 
as relevant. Planned operations inc lude the fo l low ing : 
Governance Capacity Enhancement (FY08). This w i l l support the Government in 
addressing fou r cross-cutting governance issues by: (i) enhancing accountability at 
central and p rov inc ia l government leve l , (ii) strengthening pub l ic f inanc ia l management

o f the I FC Strategic In i t ia t ive fo r Sub-Saharan A f r i c a approved by the boa rd in August 2003, namely: 
(i) imp rov ing the investment climate, (ii) pro-active pro jec t mob i l iza t ion , and (iii) enhanced support 
fo r micro, small, and med ium-s ized en te rp r ises (MSMEs). I t s m a i n features are as fo l lows : (i) 
launching qu ick ly , but staying f o r the longer term ; (ii) imp rov ing access t o finance through MSMEs 
and Trade Finance Programs; (iii) wo rk ing through partnerships and co l labora t ion with donors, NGOs 
and other partners to build synergies and m in im ize overlaps, to attract investors. 

The post-conflict initiative has three phases. Phase I , w h i c h i s completed, consisted o f 

101. 
identifying short, medium and longer t e r m pr ior i t ies and actions t o rebuild the pr iva te sector w i t h 
j o i n t scoping missions undertaken by sector teams in infrastructure, f inanc ia l markets, m in ing , 
general manufacturing, MSME development, investment c l ima te and adv isory services. Phase 2 has 
begun with the fo rma t ion o f a new government and w i l l invo lve , security permitting, a small I F C 
team located in W B o f f ices in Kinshasa with the p r ima ry ob jec t ive o f refining the proposed in i t ia t ive 
and judg ing timing t o move in to the nex t phase. Phase 3 w i l l invo lve the actual pos t ing o f an I F C 
team to fully imp lemen t programs resu l t ing f rom opportunities identified in Phase 2. 

A number of opportunities have been identified by jo in t scoping missions and the fo l low ing 

102. 
programs are curren t ly at an advance stage o f preparation and/or being implemented: 

An a irpor t advisory p ro jec t has been approved by IFC ’s corporate investment committee, 
pav ing the way fo r I F C t o seek an advisory mandate fo r pr iva te-pub l ic partnership (PPP) in 
management o f Kinshasa’s a irpor t fac i l i t ies . This w i l l f o rm par t o f broader Bank Group

I n the implementation of this initiative, I FC anticipates synergies as well as cooperation to 

103. 
enhance Bank Group assistance to DRC in a number o f areas, inc lud ing : (i) pursuit o f j o i n t W o r l d 

- 4 5 - 

Bank, IFC and M IGA collaboration to support the energy sector; (ii) consolidation o f work being 
undertaken by the World Bank, IFC PEP-Africa, FIAS and MIGA with ANAPI and to expand WBG 
scope with a joint effort to help improve the business environment; (iii) coordination in the financial 
sector and MSME development assistance by consolidating work undertaken under IDA ’S private 
sector enterprise support project and IFC’s PEP Africa and Financial Markets operations to support 
investment and non investment activities in the two sectors; (iv) consolidation o f joint IDA and IFC 
support to the mining sector with focus on implementation o f the mining code and the E IT I initiative, 
and the development o f a supply chain program; and (v) pursuit of,joint IFC and MIGA promotion in 
the telecommunications and mining sectors to support planned investments by mobile phone 
operators and mining companies. 

G. Expanding M I G A activities 

I n the 2008-2OI1 Period M I G A w i l l need to step up its activities in the areas of both 

104. 
guarantees and technical assistance. In terms o f guarantees, M IGA has spent much o f the last year 
putting together a growing pipeline o f potential future projects. Prominent sectors o f likely guarantee 
support are infrastructure (power, telecommunications), mining, agribusiness, manufacturing, and 
services. M IGA hopes to supports i t s f i r s t project in the infrastructure sector (power, 
telecommunications) in FY08. The largest part o f MIGA’s growing pipeline is, however, in the 
extractive area (specifically mining). Experience to date in this sector i s mixed. Going forward, 
MIGA w i l l be working very closely with the Bank and IFC on mining projects to ensure that a l l 
aspects o f the Extractive Industries Review (EIR) and E IT I initiatives are met before bringing such 
projects to Board fo r consideration. On the technical assistance front, MIGA w i l l be stepping up i t s 
engagement with ANAPI to increase fo re ign investment in the country. M IGA w i l l do this through 
working with ANAPI to expand i t s capacity as well as improve i t s on- l ine services to potential 
investors. 

H. Strengthening Donor Coordination 

The CAS proposes that I D A continues to play a leading role in efforts aimed at donor 

105. 
mobilization and harmonization. Such efforts are key to ensuring adequate financing can be 
provided to face the challenges o f economic recovery, and deployed in ways that make synergies 
possible, and hence enhance effectiveness. IDA ’S ro le includes organization and co-chairmanship o f 
annual Consultative Group meetings, participation in various donor groups (including sector and 
thematic groups) in Kinshasa, as well as contributing to the institutional mechanisms that may be put 
in place by the Government to follow up on implementation o f the Governance Contract. 

The CAS envisages IDA support to the Government to strengthen its capacity to coordinate 

106. 
donors. The shift o f coordination responsibilities from external partners to the Government i s an 
objective o f the overall assistance program, and i s critical to the eventual success o f the recovery 
process - in this context the mainstreaming o f PIUs i s a necessary if insufficient step. Additional 
e f fo r ts are needed to strengthen and consolidate the Government’s policy analysis, program design, 
budget implementation and monitoring and evaluation capacity. IDA support, while expected to 
remain modest in size, i s designed to help build the necessary skills and institutional mechanisms for 
the Government to take over the coordination o f external partners in a professional and effective 
manner. 

- 46 - 

107. 
F ina l ly , the CASproposes that I D A make a determined effort 
to harmonize activities at 
both the general budget and sector levels. A t the strategic level, this could be realized by building 
on the CAF process to help deepen the definition o f Government-led, common strategy around which 
donors would align their sector support, as well as eventually and potentially, general budget support. 
A t the operational level, it could be achieved through development and generalized u s e o f SWAPS, 
joint financing mechanisms, including Trust Funds (as i s already the case i n the forestry sector, and i s 
expected to be developed also in the roads sector), joint implementation and oversight activities and 
joint reporting mechanisms. In addition, the joint CAF results matrices w i l l be used as a monitoring 
tool throughout the CAF period. The specifics o f the monitoring processes are expected to be 
decided, collaboratively, in coming months. 

I. Monitoring and Evaluation: The Results Agenda 

108. The focus o f this CAS on governance reforms should resu l t in significant improvements in 
the management and transparency o f na tura l resources and other public revenues. The focus on shared 
growth and poverty reduction should lead to enhanced income opportunities and access o f 
disadvantaged groups to social services. As i s usual in post-conflict countries, time inconsistencies 
and lags, and the lack o f a strong monitoring and statistical framework, make the choice o f 
quantitative outcome indicators quite difficult. 

109 . 
Taking these factors into account, progress in these two strategic elements during the CAS 
period w i l l be monitored as follows: 

Improving Governance. Improvements in the management and transparency o f natural 
resources w i l l be measured by the increase o f revenues from the natural resources, 
improvement o f transparency in the management o f natural resources (e.g. publication o f 
mining/forestry concessions t i t les) , a restructured public service (delivers public services in 
key sectors), increase o f functioning decentralized entities, functioning o f public enterprises. 
Progress on public expenditure management w i l l be evaluated by yearly Public Expenditure 
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments, using the review completed i n 2007 as the 
baseline. 

0 Shared growth. Progress in this area w i l l be measured through a combination o f output and 
outcome indicators. Among the most important w i l l be the proportion o f government 
resources used for pro-poor programs, using 2008 budget execution figures as a baseline; 
access to health services in targeted areas; primary school enrollment and completion rates, 
using 2005 data as the baseline; and data on access to services i n ru ra l and urban areas, using 
the 2006 Poverty Note as baseline. Progress w i l l also be assessed on the basis o f functioning 
infrastructure systems (e.g., roads, ports), increased in the level o f investment from the 
private sector (including in the mining and forestry sectors) 

110. Tracking these results indicators w i l l depend on the existence of a robust monitoring and 
evaluation system i n the key ministries and sectors responsible for implementing the development 
interventions. The monitoring framework o f the PRSP i s being strengthened and Bank support to 
improve the country’s currently weak statistical capacity i s envisaged. The CAS r e s u l t s framework i s

1 1 1. As noted in Part A.3, engagement in DRC is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, and though 
the same set of risks is common to a l l donors under the CAF, each donor w i l l manage the specific 
risks to its own assistance p rog ram 
In the case o f the Bank Group, risk management w i l l be 
proactive and integrated in to the design o f every operation. Risks w i l l be m i t iga ted through strong 
supervision and f iduc ia ry controls; an increased presence o f Bank G roup s ta f f on the ground, 
intensive and ongo ing dialogue with stakeholders; par t ic ipa tory decision-making in pro jec t des ign 
and implementation; and attention to the needs t rad i t iona l ly marg ina l ized groups that cou ld be a 
source o f social unres t , inc lud ing small-scale operators in forestry and mining. Table 4 shows the

ANNEX 1: POVERTY PROFILE ANALYSIS - Summary 

POVERTY IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO @RC) 

. 

1. 
This summarizes a report by Bank staff as a contribution to the Poverty Reduction Strategv 
of the D R C government. The D R C authorities have made a substantial e f fo r t over the last few years 
to co l lec t data at household leve l in order t o prov ide in fo rma t ion on pover ty and other MDG - re la ted 
indicators and thereby i n f o rm the PRSP. The Bank has prepared a pove r ty diagnostic bu i ld ing on 
those data. Five key findings emerge f r om this analysis. 

2. 
First, the report confirms that poverty is massive in D R C . Pover ty measures based on the 
123 survey imp lemen ted in 2004-2005 indicate that close to t h r e e fou r th o f the popu la t ion i s poor 
(Table 1). In terna t iona l comparisons also show that the D R C i s one o f the poorest countries in the 
world, with mos t people in ru ra l areas no t on ly poor, but also likely t o su f fe r f r om l o w levels o f 
education and high hea l th risks. Da ta on food consumption c i rca 2000 are strikingly low , even i f one 
wou ld expect the s i tua t ion t o have improved somewhat in recent years, at least outside con f l ic t-prone 
areas. Ano ther ind ica t ion o f mass pover ty i s the fact that hea l th and education indicators have been 
fa i r ly f la t across the bo t tom three or four quintiles, pa r t icu la r ly in ru ra l areas, suggesting a s im i la r ly 
bad socio-economic situation fo r the overwhe lm ing ma jo r i ty o f the popu la t ion . Even some indicators 
in the highest quintile are s t i l l l o w by any in terna t iona l standard. Given that pover ty i s much more 
likely i f heads o f household o r spouses are wo rk ing in agr icu l ture (versus self-employment or salaried 
work), one cannot escape the conclusion that ru ra l pover ty i s highly generalized.

Secondly, although poverty is massive, there are differences between geographic areas in 
terms of 
its intensity. Reg iona l differences in indicators are presented in several places in the report. 
The analysis o f wea l th conducted with the 2001 M IC S 2 survey suggests that households res id ing in 
Kinshasa and Bas-Congo were be t te r -o f f than the r e s t o f the coun try , w h i c h i s in l i n e w i t h most 
perceptions and other data. Ru ra l areas o f the K i v u s in the M I C S 2 survey also seem t o be be t ter-o f f 
than at least some other ru ra l areas. 

4. 
Thirdly, lack of education and employment are key determinants of poverty. Emp loymen t 
and education are two m a i n determinants o f the wages o r earnings o f individuals, and o f the overa l l 
consumption l e v e l o f households. However, the re turns to education appear t o be low , especially in 
ru ra l areas. In addition, mos t o f the popu la t ion i s self-employed, due to the weaknesses o f the fo rma l 
sector, bo th in pub l ic adm in is tra t ion and in pr iva te f i r m s . Unemp loymen t i s high, especially in urban 
areas and among young workers, and i s a source o f concern bo th fo r pover ty and social stability. 

5 . 

Fourthly, the impact of the conflict (and of the prolonged economic decline of 
the last few 
decades and the lack of security) has been large. As expected, the popu la t ion has been severely 
affected by the war, bo th in t e r m s o f past economic, social, and hea l th effects, but also in t e rm s o f 

current psychological wellbeing and perceptions o f t h e future. Ending the war i s one o f the most 
frequently-cited ways poverty can be reduced, and increasing security i s one o f the more frequently 
cited priorities for the state. 

6 . 

F i f ih ly , both the high private cost of education and health services and the lack of quality 

warrant government intervention. The private costs o f education and health are high, especially for 
the poor. Affordability repeatedly comes up as the main reason for not sending children to school, 
not maintaining them in school regularly, or having them drop out. This does not mean that 
affordability i s the only i s s u e as important questions are raised about quality as well. The findings for 
health are similar: affordability comes up as the main reason for not seeking care, or not following up 
on prescribed medical treatment. Again, there are also quality issues, but improving affordability i s 
essen t ia l for households in poor areas. Better affordability could also y ie ld large externalities in 
t e r m s o f other benefits, given the negative impact o f bad health on a range o f other outcomes. 

7 . 
Future analytical work and monitoring and evaluation of PRSP implementation w i l l need 
continued efforts 

in terms of data collection and analysis. The Bank’s report on poverty provides a 
basic diagnostic and an analysis o f the perceptions and priorities o f the poor that has been used in the 
PRSP. The analysis remains limited however. W h i l e the available sources o f data provide c lear 
pointers, additional efforts need to be implemented to improve the information base on poverty, 
vulnerability, and the social and productive sectors. Two Poverty Assessments are planned over the 
CAS period, one to be published in FY09, the other in F Y 1 1.

Completion o f a full PRSP through a 
participatory process and i t s

documented in the DRC’s annual 
progress report, and confirmed as 
satisfactory by a j o i n t staff advisory note 
(JS AN).

4. Public expenditure management 
(a) Implementation o f a modernized 
budget-execution system, p rov id ing 
information f i om commitment to 
payment, and a l low ing for the mon i tor ing

Ongoing. The full PRSP was completed through a 
participatory process, and was adopted b y the government in July 2006. The 
PRSP and the JSAN were presented to the Bank Board in M a y 2007 and the 
Fund Board in September 2007. The document i s being disseminated: flyers 
in four local languages are being prepared; dissemination workshops were 
held. The implementation p lan for the strategy was endorsed b y sectoral 
ministries, NGOs, and c i v i l society. A p r io r i ty action program (PAP) 2007- 
08 was developed in collaboration w i t h development partners and sectoral 
ministers. to s tar t imdementing the PRSP. 
Improving. Macroeconomic stability deteriorated during the 
period leading up to and after the elections. After the duly-elected 
government took office in early 2007, macroeconomic indicators improved 
as the new government tightened the f isca l discipline. However, the State 
Budget 2007 (promulgated mid-2007) used unrealistically high revenue 
projections to jus t i fy higher expenditures, notably for Parliamentarians’ 
salaries. Even though the government announced i t s intensions to stick to 
the more realistic budget that was agreed w i t h the IM F , the fiscal discipline 
started to weaken in the second h a l f o f 2007 as social pressure mounted. The 
government i s work ing to improve the situation, and i s discussing the 2008 
budget w i t h the Fund team, w i t h the poss ib i l i ty o f starting negotiations for a 
new PRGF arrangement as earlv as December 2007. 
Satisfactory. The use o f budgetary savings f i om the enhanced 
H IPC In i t ia t ive i s aligned w i t h the pr ior i t ies expressed in I-PRSP and PRSP. 
The government continues i t s efforts to u s e H IPC savings to f inance 
spending in the areas o f health and education. These social sectors have 
received a large share o f the pro-poor spending s ince 2003 : the budget 
executed for these sectors has increased f rom 0.7% o f GDP in 2003 to 2.6% 
in 2006. An external audit o f the H IPC account was completed recently. 

Ongoing. (a) The budget-execution system i s improving. A

o f the service (iii) inaccessibility due to lack o f roads and distance to the 
nearest fac i l i ty as major problems. In particular, user fees were found to 
cover not just the service providers (e.g. schools and clinics), but also to 
subsidize the (extremely low) remunerations and operating costs o f loca l 
administrations. A budget tracking exercise for these tw o sectors are 
planned to be completed in 2008. However, neither the user surveys nor 
budget tracking exercise has been conducted or even planned for rura l

guaranteed debt. The debt management agency (OGEDEP) does not yet 
publish the debt s e r v i c e projections. OGEDEP also does not play the role o f 
the single debt information center. Ministry o f Finance must exert further 
efforts to sensitize a l l parties invo lved in any matters concerning public and 
pub l ic ly guaranteed debt to treat OGEDEP as the single information cen ter 
(or to designate another entity to fulfill this task).

1. 

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is in debt distress. At end 2006, debt s e r v i c e 

on pub l ic and pub l ic ly guaranteed (PPG) external debt amounted t o 26 percent o f exports while the 
net present value (NPV) o f PPG external debt exceeded 300 percent o f exports, 90 percent o f GDP, 
and 700 percent o f government revenue. As a result, most debt burden indicators substantially exceed 
their policy-based thresholds under the baseline scenario.2 Further, the D R C has n o t serviced any o f 
i t s debt service obligations t o Paris C lub creditors since Ju ly2006 . Even i f the security situation 
stabilizes and macroeconomic and structural po l ic ies improve substantially as assumed under the 
baseline scenario, external debt indicators w i l l rema in above the relevant policy-based thresholds for 
many years t o come and even worsen in the event o f adverse exogenous shocks. Accord ing ly , the 
D R C should seek external f inanc ing ma in ly in the fo rm o f grants. I t shou ld strengthen i t s track record 
o f po l icy imp lemen ta t ion with a view t o reaching the comp le t ion po in t under t h e enhanced H IPC 
in i t ia t ive as soon as possible, wh ich wou ld a l low it to benefit f r om substantial stock-of-debt r e l i e f 
under this in i t ia t ive as well as the Mu l t i la te ra l Debt Reduc t ion In i t ia t ive (MDRI).

This i s the first debt sustainability analysis fo r the DRC prepared under t h e jo in t World Bank/IMF Debt 
Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries. Bank and Fund s t a f f s also completed a HIPC DSA

Under the jo in t World Bank/ I M F debt sustainability framework, the corresponding thresholds a re 30 percent 
fo r the NPV o f external PPG debt to GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV o f external PPG debt to exports 
ratio, 200 percent for the NPV o f external PPG debt t o revenue ratio, 15 percent for the external PPG debt 
service to exports ratio, and 25 percent for the external PPG debt service to revenue ratio. 

(“OperationalFramework for Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries - Fur ther 

Considerations”, SMl05/109,3/29/05 and IDNR2005-0056). Assuming the DRC reaches the HIPC 
completion point by mid-2008 and benefits from debt r e l i e f under enhanced HIPC and the MDR initiatives, 
debt burden indicators would fa l l below policy-based thresholds.

Background 

2. 
Three decades of economic mismanagement, culminating in civil strye, led to the 
accumulation of a large stock of external arrears3 A t end-2001, the DRC’s a r rea rs on PPG external 
debt amounted to US$10.6 b i l l ion . Clearance o f close to US$2 b i l l i o n o f arrears to multilateral 
institutions and progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, followed by the approval o f a 
PRGF arrangement in July 2002, paved the way for the HIPC decision point in 2003. A t the decision 
point and based on the outstanding stock o f debt at end-2002 o f US$8.4 b i l l ion in NPV  term^,^ HIPC 
debt r e l i e f to the DRC was estimated at US$6.3 b i l l ion in NPV t e rm s . 

3 . 
A t the time of the decision point, it was assumed that the DRC would reach the completion 
point shortly afier the end of 
the PRGF arrangement, in the th ird quarter of 2006 . However, 
substantial policy slippages towards the f ina l phase o f the democratic transition prevented the 
completion o f the las t review under the PRGF arrangement, which had been extended to end- 
March 2006. S ince then, Fund s t a f f has helped the authorities design and monitor two S t a f f 
Monitored Programs ( S M P s ) ’ , w i th a view to strengthening economic policy implementation and 
allowing for the development o f a credible medium-term program to be supported under a successor 
PRGF arrangement. The DRC also completed and adopted o f f ic ia l ly a full PRSP in July 2006 and has 
made progress towards meeting the HIPC completion point triggers. Completing the f i r s t review 
under a new PRGF and satisfying the HIPC completion point triggers would pave the way for the 
DRC to reach the completion point, possibly by mid-2008, and hence the delivery o f the remaining 
HIPC and MDRI debt re l ie f . 

~~ 

The DRC faced negative growth ra tes over 13 consecutive years, leading to a dramatic decline o f GDP per 
capita (in constant 2000 U S dollars) from US$400 at independence in 1960 to U S $ l O O in 2001.

While the long-term macroeconomic projections in this DSA are in line with the decision 
point DSA,” the medium-term growth prospects have improved. T h e recen t p o l i t i c a l t rans i t ion and 

high c omm o d i t y p r i c e s have sparked inves to r in teres t in the mining sector. N e w inves tmen ts in the

The N P V o f debt in this DSA also differs fkom decision point data as a result o f methodological d i f ferences 
between the jo in t Bank-Fund L I C DSA framework and the H IPC methodology. These are using: a) a f ixed 
5 percent discount rate instead o f currency-specific discount rates under HIPC; b) WE0 exchange rate 
projections instead o f f ixed exchange rates as o f end-of the base date; and c) annual exports instead o f a th ree -

DSA have been updated reflecting the change in the expected H IPC completion po in t date and updated 
information on commercial debt.

g row th in 2008 and 2009 w o u l d s ign i f ican t ly and adversely a f fec t the DRC ’s debt to export 
indicators, ra is ing i t s N P V o f debt to exports ra t io to 3 10 percent and i t s debt service to exports ra t io 
to 23 percent in 2017. 

1 1. 

The DRC’s debt burden indicators are projected to fa l l below their thresholds if it benefits 
from debt relief under the enhanced H IPC and the MDRZ initiatives. Under an alternative scenario, 

wh ich assumes the D R C reaches the H IPC comp le t ion po in t in mid-2008, the N P V o f government 
and government-guaranteed external debt wou ld f a l l t o the equivalent o f 16.0 percent o f GDP, 
48 percent o f exports, and 114 percent o f government revenue by 2008. 

12. 
Even after the completion point is reached, the DRC’s debt sustainability is likely to remain 
vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks. Applying the stahdardized s t ress t e s t s to the post- 
comp le t ion po in t scenario, it can be shown that under the mos t extreme stress tes ts a l l debt stock 
indicators wou ld breach their thresholds, two o f them over sustained pe r iod o f time.14 

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis 

The DRC’s domestic debt is estimated to be relatively low following its restructuring in 

13. 
2005. Identified government domestic debt15 was equivalent t o 0.5 percent o f GDP at end 2006 and i s 
expected to be pa id o f f by end-2007. Thereafter, t h e baseline f isca l framework assumes zero ne t 
domestic borrow ing . 

As a result, the above sustainability analysis for external debt broadly applies for total 

14. 
government and government-guaranteed debt (Tables 2a and 2b). Under the baseline scenario, the 
N P V o f public debt t o GDP ra t io decreases on ly gradually t o the relevant po l icy thresholds towards 
the end o f the 20-year p ro jec t ion per iod . 

Conclusions 

15. 
The DRC is currently in debt distress. Even i f the security s i tua t ion stabilizes and 
macroeconomic and structural po l ic ies lead to robust recovery, as assumed under the baseline 
scenario, the external debt indicators wou ld breach policy-based thresholds. Moreover, even after 
reaching the H IPC comp le t ion po in t and benefiting f rom debt r e l i e f under the enhanced H IPC and 
MDRI initiatives, the D R C remains vulnerable to shocks that cou ld lead to lowe r exports and 
economic growth. I t i s therefore essential that the D R C adheres t o prudent macroeconomic po l ic ies 
and implement s ign i f ican t structural reforms far reaching structural reforms, while seeking external 
f inanc ing mos t ly in the f o rm o f grants o r loans on highly concessional terms. I t should also strengthen 
i t s track record o f p o l i c y imp lemen ta t ion with a v iew t o qu ick ly reach ing the comp le t ion po in t under 
the enhanced H IPC In i t ia t ive .

A combination o f different shocks leads to the largest increase in NPV o f debt t o GDP and NPV o f debt t o 
exports ra t io . The most extreme shock for the NPV o f debt t o exports ra t io i s the shock on export growth.

Box 1: Democratic Republic o f the Congo - Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the Baseline 

Since 2002, rea l G D P growth has averaged 5.5 percent. Construction and telecommunications 
contributed significantly to growth, reflecting a recovery o f economic activity after years o f c iv i l s t r i fe . 
Aggregate demand rebounded on the back o f large international support f o r reconstruction and the political 
transition and favorable terms o f trade. 

Assuming that the DRC maintains security and strengthens its record o f policy implementation, including 
major improvements in governance, rea l G D P growth i s projected to increase to 8 percent a year during 
2007-12 led by a mining rebound and a continuation o f the reconstruction efforts o f the past years. Large 
investments in copper and cobalt are expected to increase their output to historical production levels by 
2012. Consequently, the mining sector i s expected to grow at on average 17 percent between 2008 and 
2012 i n real terms.u Over the long run, real GDP i s projected to stabilize at around 5 percent a year as the 
strong recovery tapers o f f over time. 

Inflation i s projected to decrease from 18 percent at end 2006 to 8 percent in 2008 and i s projected to 
remain at that rate over the long run. With a view to reducing the DRC’s vulnerability to external shocks, 
gross international reserves a re projected to be gradually rebuilt from the equivalent o f 3 weeks o f non- 
aid related imports in 2006 to about 9 weeks i n 2012. The nominal exchange rate relative to the US dollar 
i s assumed t o depreciate i n line with the inflation differential between the DRC and the United States. 
However, potentially large capital inflows that the DRC could attract i f the security situation and 
governance improve, could lead to a real appreciation o f the currency, which in turn could lead to lower 
than projected debt burden indicators. 

Exports o f goods and services a re projected to increase on average by 11.4 percent per year in 2007-12 
and by 6.0 percent over the long run. The in i t ia l export boom reflects the coming on stream o f important 
projects to rehabilitate the DRC’s large mining sector. The rehabilitation o f the DRC’s infrastructure could 
also contribute to the development o f other exports, including agricultural products. Imports are expected 
to increase sharply in 2008 related to large mining and infrastructure projects, continuing to grow at 
10 percent t i l l 2012 before assuming a long-term growth rate o f 5 percent. 

The non-interest current account deficit was estimated to be equivalent to 4.9 percent o f GDP i n 2006 
and projected to peak at about 9.0 percent o f GDP in 201 1. The fluctuations o f the current account balance 
reflect the lumpiness o f imports related to mining projects. Thereafter, i t w i l l gradually narrow as exports 
pick up and imports decline. The widening current account deficit during the 2008-12 period i s assumed to 
be financed mainly by foreign direct investment, with net FD I inflows averaging 9 percent o f GDP 
between 2008 and 2012. 

The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) i s projected to shift from near balance i n 2006 to a deficit o f 
some 2.8 percent o f GDP by 2012. This assumes the execution o f reforms to widen the tax base, strengthen 
tax and customs administration, which would help raise revenue by some 3 percentage points o f GDP over 
the next five years. On that basis, public expenditure could increase by 7 percentage points, particularly to 
help address the DRC’s substantial social and infrastructure rehabilitation needs, on a non-inflationary and 
sustainable basis. 

Donor support i s assumed to increase subject to significant improvement in governance and 
macroeconomic policies. Under the baseline, external grants would increase, as a share o f GDP, from 
2 percent in 2004 to 6 percent in 2012 and remain at around this level going forward. 

Achieving the macroeconomic objectives will, however, be a challenge. Beyond t h e fragile security and 
political situation, risks include: (i) fiscal slippages that could destabilize a fragile economy; ( i i ) significant 
adverse terms o f trade shocks; ( i i i ) slower than projected private-sector led growth; (iv) lower-than- 
anticipated donor support if governance does not improve markedly; and (v) slow progress i n s truc tura l 
reforms, possibly due to limited implementation capacity. 

1/ The DRC has Africa’s largest deposits o f copper, cobalt and coltan, and significant reserves o f diamonds and o i l . 
After years o f economic mismanagement, poor governance and conflict, the contribution o f the mining sector to 
GDP declined from 25 percent o f GDP in the mid-l980s, to less than 10 percent o f GDP in the early 2000s.
