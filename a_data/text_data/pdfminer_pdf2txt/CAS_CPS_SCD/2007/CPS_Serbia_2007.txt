E X E C U T I V E S UMM A R Y 

1. Background. Serbia has made significant progress on a wide ranging reform program since 2000. 
Macro-economic stability has been restored, and incomes have risen strongly. GDP per capita, estimated at 
$2,200 in 2002, i s now approaching $5,400. Poverty has fa l len fkom 14.6 percent o f the population to about 
8 .8 percent. Growth has been underpinned by structural reforms to improve the business environment and 
the functioning o f the enterprise sector. Public debt has almost halved as a proportion o f GDP and reserves 
stand at over 30 percent o f GDP. A t the time o f Serbia’s accession to Bank membership in 2001, analysis 
was focused on the importance o f breaking with the past. Now, however, the theme o f this partnership 
strategy might more appropriately be to build on the success o f recent economic gains and seize the future. 

2. Completing the Transition Agenda and Moving Toward Europe. Due to the turmoil o f the 1990s 
Serbia was one o f the last countries in the Western Balkans to embark on the transition agenda. Strong 
progress has been made, particularly in expanding private sector participation in the f inanc ia l and r e a l 
sectors. The reform program has helped to underpin the country’s strong economic performance and 
reductions in poverty. Nevertheless, risks remain. Serbia faces a challenging agenda if it i s to fu l f i l l i t s 
potential and participate in a wider Europe. Further reforms to spur private sector led growth, while 
protecting and better managing the environment, w i l l be critical to ensure living standards and quality o f l i f e 
continue to converge with those in Europe. Particular efforts w i l l be required to ensure that a l l people in 
Serbia have the opportunity to participate in and benefit from growth. Further strengthening o f democratic 
institutions and overcoming remaining political legacy issues w i l l also be required in the European 
stabilization and association process. Serbia concluded technical negotiations with the European Union on a 
Stabilization and Association Agreement ( S A A ) in September 2007. However the political situation and the 
EU accession process in Serbia remains influenced by recen t history. 

3 . The World Bank Group has actively supported Serbia’s transition since re-engagement in 2001. 
The Bank has had a discrete program o f lending and analytical work for Serbia. Total IDA credits and 
grants committed to Serbia s ince 2001 amount to almost $740 million, with $145 million in IBRD 
commitments. As well as IDNIBRD support, the Bank Group provided technical assistance from both IFC 
and M IGA to improve the business environment. IFC has invested over $325 million in Serbia, and MIGA 
has provided guarantees o f over $425 million, in both cases predominantly in the financial sector. The 
objectives o f the las t CAS’S three pillars to: (i) create a smaller, more sustainable, more e f f i c i e n t public 
sector, (ii) create a larger, more dynamic private sector, and (iii) reduce poverty levels and improve social 
protection and access to public services, were largely met. The economy has grown at an average o f 5 .5 
percent per annum, driven by the private sector. The proportion o f the population living in poverty has 
fallen by 5 percent, and the Government i s already close to meeting their 2010 target o f reducing poverty to 
6.5 percent. Consistent f isca l deficits in the early part o f the decade were reduced as a result o f significant 
consolidation o f public expenditures in 2004 and 2005, although spending increased in 2006 as a proportion 
o f GDP in the run-up to the election. Current projections for 2007 suggest that spending has stabilized. 
This was accompanied by significant structural public sector reform, and the effectiveness o f public 
spending has improved, with the share o f public investments rising as a proportion o f total government 
spending. Despite recent progress, there i s the need to continue improving the effectiveness o f public 
spending by strengthening the Government’s Public Expenditure Management system. The World Bank 
Group support i s widely recognized by the authorities as having strengthened the business environment 
while maintaining and improving service sustainability and quality in key sectors such as health, transport 
and energy. The CAS FY05 was noticeable for the country’s graduation from ID A to IBRD financing due 
to Serbia’s relatively strong economic performance since 2000. 

4. The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). This CPS reflects the coordinated support able to be 
provided to Serbia from a l l parts o f the Bank Group. Interventions from IBRD, IFC, MIGA, and WBI, w i l l 

i 

be coordinated closely and are expected to have strong synergies. Over time, a l l parts o f the Bank Group, 
including IFC, MIGA, and WB I are likely to play an increasingly central role in the Bank Group’s program. 
Given Serbia’s relatively strong economic progress to date and the country’s graduation to IBRD this CPS 
envisages the Bank working even more closely with t h e Authorities to ensure that the Bank program i s 
demand driven and focused on supporting the Government’s own reform program. The four year CPS i s 
designed to ensure that the World Bank programming cycle i s consistent with the anticipated political cycle 
in Serbia. Following Parliamentary elections in January 2007, the normal Parliamentary term in Serbia 
would run until the end o f 2010. The CPS consequently coincides with the current Parliamentary mandate. 
Within the overarching framework o f European integration and poverty reduction, the CPS supports three 
Government identified priorities. 
i. encouraging dynamic private sector led growth to ensure incomes continue to converge with 
European levels; 
ii. providing opportunities and broadening participation in growth; and 
iii. managing emerging environmental and disaster risks. 

5 . A focused program o f investment operations, support fo r reform efforts, deployment of a range 
o f financial instruments beyond traditional lending and technical assistance i s planned. The CPS 

envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope o f $600 million over four years. Within the strategic 
framework outlined in the CPS, mechanisms have been introduced to ensure that support i s able to be 
tailored and adjusted to meet emerging needs and the rapidly changing circumstances o f a middle-income 
country situated in a region still on the road to political stability. This CPS outlines a set o f agreed 
investments and analytical support for FY08 and FY09. Indicative areas for potential engagement in the 
second half o f the CPS period are also set out. Nevertheless, decisions on interventions in the la t ter half o f 
the CPS period w i l l be made as part o f a mid-term review process anticipated for late calendar 2009. Scope 
i s also available to calibrate lending to reflect changes in Serbia’s overall creditworthiness compared to 
current projections, and lending volumes w i l l be considered again in the mid-term review. The Government 
recognizes the value added and comparative advantages that can be brought by the Bank Group. The Bank 
will, however, need to continue to adjust its business model to remain responsive to Serbian requirements 
and a rapidly changing environment. This i s likely to require the deployment o f a range o f financial 
instruments beyond traditional lending, including possibly deferred drawdown financing and catastrophic 
risk insurance. Greater involvement by a l l parts o f the Bank Group to work with the Authorities to 
encourage public-private partnerships, including at the sub-national level, offers particular scope to 
encourage further investment in the delivery o f important infrastructure and social services. 

6 . Partnerships. The Bank Group w i l l work in partnership with the authorities and other members o f the 
international community. Given the over-arching ro le o f the EU, Bank interventions w i l l be aligned with 
EU programs to help Serbia reach European standards. Specific rural and regional development 
investments w i l l also be undertaken in close coordination with the EC. The Bank continues to work closely 
with the IMF, although Serbia does not currently have a program. The Bank w i l l cooperate closely with the 
range o f multilateral and bilateral partners active in Serbia. In light o f Serbia’s prevailing strong resource 
position the Bank w i l l increasingly seek to leverage loca l resources in support o f investment activities. 

7. R i s k s . Risks remain, particularly given the increasingly uncertain situation in the region arising from 
unresolved Kosovo status issues. Serbia also remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Managing risks 
w i l l require that the Bank Group work cooperatively with the Serbian Authorities in a highly flexible 
manner in order to encourage Serbia’s continued international engagement and integration at a 
particularly sensitive time. At the same time, Bank Group support i s necessarily dependent on Serbia 
meeting international responsibilities. The Bank w i l l need to be agile in responding to changing 
circumstance and the demands o f a sophisticated middle income client with a range o f options fo r both 
financial products and advisory services.

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA 

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. Serbia has made significant progress since beginning a wide ranging program o f democratic and 
economic reforms in 2001. Macro-economic stability has been restored, and incomes have r isen strongly. 
GDP per capita, estimated at $2,200 in 2002, i s now approaching $5,400. Poverty has fa l len from 14.6 
percent o f the population to about 8 .8 percent. Serbia i s now well placed to move forward toward 
integration with Europe, having completed technical discussions on a S tab i l iza t ion and Association 
Agreement. At the time o f Serbia’s accession to Bank membership in 2001, analysis was focused on the 
importance o f breaking with the past. Now, however, the theme o f this partnership strategy might more 
appropriately be seizing the future. 

2. A challenging reform agenda remains i f Serbia i s to fulfill its potential. Increasing competitiveness 
and attracting further investment i s key to creating more jobs while maintaining strong growth. Serbia was 
one o f the last countries in the Western Balkans to embark on the transition agenda. Progress has been 
significant, as evidenced in the major improvements in the business environment that saw Serbia ranked as 
the top reformer globally in D o i n g Business 2006, fo r reforms in 2004-2005. This reform program has 
helped to underpin the country’s strong economic performance and reductions in poverty. S t i l l , further 
reforms to strengthen the environment for sustained private sector led growth - including structural reforms 
and privatization - w i l l be vital to ensure living standards continue to converge with those in Europe. 
Particular e f for ts w i l l be required to ensure that a l l people in Serbia have the opportunity to participate in 
and benefit from growth, including the large number o f poor in rural areas, among minority groups, and in 
depressed regions formerly home to large industrial and mining industries. Further strengthening 
democratic institutions, public spending, the rule o f law, and overcoming remaining political legacy issues 
w i l l also be required. 

3 . The proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds on the experience o f the World Bank 
Group in supporting Serbian Government led reform efforts since 2001. The CPS aims to harness a l l 
parts o f the World Bank Group, including IFC and MIGA, to support Serbia build on the progress o f the 
past few years. Reflecting Serbia’s strong economic progress, this CPS comes at a time o f Serbia’s 
graduation to IBRD. This w i l l require the Bank to work even more closely with the Authorities to ensure 
that the Bank program i s demand driven and focused on supporting the Government’s own reform program. 
Over time, a l l parts o f the Bank Group, including IFC, MIGA and WBI, are likely to play an increasingly 
central ro le in the Bank Group’s program. The CPS aims to support the Government’s key priorities, and i s 
focused around the key, and inter-related, themes o f (i) convergence with EU living standards through 
private sector led growth, (ii) broadening participation in growth; and (iii) managing emerging 
environmental and disaster risks. 

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Political Background and Recent Developments 

4. The past few years have seen a degree o f relative political stability in Serbia. Parties from the 
‘democratic bloc’ - in varying combinations - have provided the foundation for government s ince 
President Milosevic was forced to step aside in 2000. Democratic institutions have been strengthened. 
The current Government includes President Tadic’s Democratic Party (DS), Prime Minister Kostunica’s 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

Democratic Party o f Serbia (DSS ) and the G17+. Th is fo l lowed Presidential elections in 2004, and 
Parliamentary elections in January 2007. The Government i s based on a new Serbian Constitution, 
adopted b y national referendum in November 2006, fo l low ing the dissolution o f the State Un ion o f Serbia 
and Montenegro in June 2006. Re f lec t ing a grow ing po l i t ica l ma tur i ty in the Balkans, the dissolution o f 
the State Un ion i t s e l f fo l lowed a democratic process, was generally smooth, and entirely peaceful - unlike 
the break-up o f the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Under the t e rm s o f the new Constitution, 
Presidential elections need to be called before the end o f 2007, and this cou ld result in a degree o f 
po l i t ica l uncertainty i n the short term. 

5 . Still, political differences remain evident. The formation o f a Government in early 2007, for 
instance, took several months o f d i f f icu l t negotiations between the parties. S im i lar ly , although President 
Tadic and Prime Minister Kostunica have each been in their current offices since elections in early 2004, 
the changing formation of the governing coalition over the past few years (this i s now the fourth 
Government since 2000), highlights the differences between the parties o f the ‘democratic bloc’. 
D iv is ions in society are also reflected in overtly nationalist parties continuing to w i n a significant 
m ino r i ty o f seats in Parliament, w i th the Serbian Radical Party the largest single party in Parliament. 

6 . Advancing European integration i s a stated priority o f the Government, and major progress 
was made w ith the initialing of a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) in early 
November 2007. European integration i s an objective supported by almost two thirds o f society. The 
in i t ia l ing o f the SAA fo l lows almost two years o f negotiations, wh ich started in October 2005. European 
Foreign Ministers in i t ia l ly set out principles fo r a European future for the Western Balkan countries at a 
Summit in Thessaloniki in 2003. Ministers reiterated this v is ion in Salzburg in June 2006, although 
no t ing that the European perspective for the Western Balkans needs to be considered in l igh t o f the 
European Un ion ’s absorptive capacity. Nevertheless, the po l i t ica l situation and the EU accession process 
in Serbia remains influenced by recent history. Wh i le an S A A has been initialed, signing and ra t i f ica t ion 
w i l l s t i l l take several months, and i s likely to require Serbia to demonstrate even closer cooperation w i th 
the International Cr im ina l Tr ibuna l fo r the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) . 
S t i l l , Serbia’s strong 
administrative capacity may a l low qu ick progress towards candidacy status once po l i t ica l issues are 
resolved. 

7. Serbia i s taking an active ro l e in a range o f international and regional initiatives. A t the 
regional level, Serbia i s a signatory to Energy Community o f South East Europe Trea ty , wh ich creates 
legal framework for an integrated energy market in the region. Serbia has recently ra t i f ied the Central 
Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which replaces 32 bilateral f r e e trade agreements and aims to 
establish a f r e e trade zone in the region by the end o f 2010. Serbia participates in the Stability Pact for 
South Eastern Europe. A t the global level, Serbia has recently ra t i f ied the K y o t o Protocol, and i s 
expected to have completed requirements to j o i n the Wo r ld Trade Organization in 2008 

8. The status o f Kosovo has become an increasingly prominent issue i n political discourse in 
Serbia. Under Un i ted Nations Security Counc i l Resolution 1244, Kosovo i s a province o f Serbia under 
the autonomous administration o f the Un i ted Nations (Throughout the CPS the province i s referred to 
as “Kosovo”). E f for ts to reach a long t e rm negotiated solution to KOSOVO’S 
conducted under the auspices o f the Contact Group, w i t h a troika o f negotiators f rom Germany (on beha l f 
o f the EU), the Un i ted States, and Russia. A t this stage, the Kosovo and Serbian sides appear to have 
fundamental differences o f views on how the situation should be resolved. Ach iev ing a negotiated 
solution i s likely to be extremely d i f f icu l t . A l l parties in the Serbian governing coa l i t ion remain united 
that independence for Kosovo i s not appropriate.

B. Recent Economic Developments in Serbia 

9. After significant declines in the economy during the late 1980s and 1990s, reforms in Serbia 
since 2000 have resulted in renewed growth and the restoration of macro-economic stability. In the 
past five years, growth has averaged approximately 5.5 percent per annum, and should reach 7.0 percent 
in 2007. Growth has been driven primarily by strong domestic demand. Consumption has particularly 
underpinned growth over the past five years, although the rate o f increase i s starting to slow. More 
recently, strong export performance has also supported growth. Investment has remained about 22 to 23 
percent o f GDP - a relatively solid performance, although below the level o f the fast-growing transition 
economies, where investment shares have been about 30 percent (Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia) or higher 
(Estonia). Service sectors have particularly grown strongly. Growth in agriculture and industry was 
volatile and on average slower. Key macro-economic figures are set out in Table 1. 

10. Renewed growth has been underpinned by significant reform. Stabilization measures introduced 
after 2000 have brought the hyper-inflation o f the 1990s under control. A series o f tax reforms since 
2001 (including introduction o f VAT in 2005) have created a more e f f i c i e n t and simpler tax system which 
has strengthened the revenue base. Extensive restructuring o f the banking system has helped to improve 
the allocation o f capital, and access to credit. The privatization o f about 1,800 socially owned enterprises 
has given new l i f e to sometimes moribund companies, and reduced the demand for s ta te subsidies. 
Reflecting progress, Serbia was rated by the Bank’s Do ing Business 2006 report as the top reformer in 
2004-2005. Gains are particularly evident in major reductions in the time and cost required to start a 
business, which resulted in 40 percent more businesses being registered in 2005 compared to 2003, as 
well as a new c iv i l procedure code that halved the time required to resolve business disputes. Serbia’s 
rating slipped slightly in the 2008 report, as the reform agenda slowed in the lead up to elections and as 
other countries pushed ahead with reform. Governance indicators for Serbia also continue to improve, 
although from a low base, particularly perceptions o f strengthened r u l e o f law and control o f corruption’. 
There was s ign i f ican t public sector reform including much improved public expenditure management with 
the passage o f a number o f c r i t i c a l laws including on budget systems, procurement and debt management 
and strengthening o f institutions notably in Treasury. A public administration reform strategy i s being 
implemented that lays the foundation for a shift to a merit-based and de-politicized c iv i l service and for the 
rationalization o f government s truc tures . A reform o f the pension system moves the system towards long 
run sustainability, and the ongoing health sector reform i s one o f the best in the region. 

11 . Growth has flowed through to improvements in living standards fo r most Serbians. In USD 
terms, GDP per capita has risen from about $2,700 in 2003 to just under $4,300 in 2006, with GDP per 
capita projected to be over $5,400 in 2007. L a t e s t World Bank poverty measures suggest that the 
proportion o f the population living below an absolute poverty l i n e (roughly $2.15 per day) has fallen 
significantly during the CAS FY05 period, from 14.6 percent in 2004 to 8 . 8 percent in 2006. 
Nevertheless, poverty remains a persistent problem in rural areas, which are home to about two thirds o f 
a l l poor people in Serbia. This i s particularly evident in depressed regions that used to be home to major 
industries (often extractive and industrial) during the Yugoslav period. Poverty also remains very high 
among minority groups, with over half o f the Roma population estimated to live in poverty. Real gains in 
poverty reduction, however, are accompanied by continued pessimism among much o f the population, in 
part because average incomes are just returning to the high point reached during the la te 1980s. 
Unemployment also remains a continuing problem, at about 20 percent o f the labor force.

12. Despite Serbia's strong growth performance, significant challenges remain. External 
weaknesses are apparent in double-digit and expanding current account deficits. External debt remains 
about 60 percent o f GDP, despite past London and Paris Club debt write downs. Although public debt 
has declined significantly, private external liabilities continue to grow quickly. Surging capital inflows 
and large current account deficits have unsettled the focus o f monetary and exchange rate policies, which 
have alternated between disinflation and exchange ra te objectives. Although policy action w i l l be 

4 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FY I1 

required to address external weaknesses, Serbia’s reserves position i s currently very comfortable as a 
result o f strong private sector inflows including foreign direct investment. FD I averaged 6.7 percent o f 
GDP over the last 5 years, resulting in Serbia being among the top countries in Europe and Central Asia 
with respect to attracting such investment. FD I was especially strong in 2006, as a result o f several large 
privatization deals, including the sa le o f a mobile telephone operator. Nevertheless, the privatization 
agenda remains unfinished. Greater greenfield FD I would a lso be useful. 

C . Developments in Poverty Reduction, Social Issues and MDGs 

13 . Poverty has fallen over the past four years, from about 14.6 percent o f the population in 2004, 

to 8.8 percent in 2006. Serbia i s on track to meet the target, set out in its 2003 Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (PRS), to reduce poverty to 6.5 percent by 2010. Despite the significant decline in poverty, 
however, this needs to be seen in the context o f Serbia only recently returning to the income and poverty 
levels enjoyed in the late 1980s. Partly because o f this, a degree o f pessimism i s still evident2. 

14. Serbia seems well-placed to meet most, if not all, the MDG targets by 2015. Primary school 

completion rates are over 95 percent, and in terms o f statistics do not differ significantly by gender. The 
proportion o f the population with access to an improved water source i s higher than the average for ECA 
countries, as i s the share o f the country’s population with access to sanitation systems. Infant and child 
mortality rates in Serbia were quite low to start with in 1990 and have continued to f a l l s ince then, 
indicating the country i s on track to achieve this MDGn3 Finally, with regard to the arresting the spread o f 
communicable diseases, prevalence rates o f diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS are quite 
low, though warrant c lose monitoring, particularly for vulnerable and high-risk groups. 

1 5 . Regional differences in poverty, w ith particularly high levels o f unemployment in former 
industrial centers, remain a particular challenge. Unemployment remains stubbornly high at about 20 

percent o f the labor force, and poverty and unemployment are closely linked. Despite high economic 
growth in the country overall, poverty remains especially evident in ru ra l areas (such as parts o f 
Vojvodina and Central Serbia) and in depressed former mining and industrial regions (such as Bor and 
Resavica). As well as high unemployment, there appears to be a significant number o f “working poor” in 
such regions. A large number o f people in low wage jobs, often in the gray economy, remain just above 
the poverty line, and vulnerable to unexpected economic shocks (such as loss o f employment). Poverty i s 
also strongly correlated with education: highly educated workers enjoy considerable wage advantage 
compared to those with l e s s education and lower skills. Raising employment rates, and worker 
productivity and wages, through a comprehensive approach, including by promoting mobility o f workers 
from declining to growing sectors, and upgrading the education and training system to produce a highly- 
skilled and flexible workforce, are important challenges facing policymakers in the countryO4 Other 
challenges include very high levels o f poverty among minorities, especially Roma, as well as a rapidly 
aging population, which w i l l have implications for the healthcare system and the f i s c a l sustainability o f 
the pension system. 

111. C O U N T R Y DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND OUTSTAND ING PRIORITIES 

16. The key economic priorities o f the new Government are set out in the Memorandum on the 
Budget and Economic and Fiscal Policy for the Year (July 2007) and the 2008 Budget (November 

2007). Priorities outlined in these documents are set within the Serbia’s strategy for EU integration, 

I n Serbia, for instance, only 20 percent o f the population currently f e e l s that the economic situation i s better than in 
1989 , compared to almost 40 percent in other Eastern European transition economies.

i. Macro-Economic Stability 
18 . The Government recognizes that maintaining macro-economic stability i s critical to underpin 

Serbia’s continued growth and development. In order t o m a i n t a i n h a r d w o n macro-econom ic s tab i l i ty , 
the Governmen t has comm i t ted i t s e l f t o ma in ta in appropr ia te f isca l and mone tary p o l i c y and accelerate 
s truc tura l re fo rms in the f inanc ia l and p u b l i c sector. T h e Governmen t ’s Budge t M em o r a n d um recognizes 
the prob lems associated with increas ing ex terna l vu lnerab i l i t ies , ev iden t p a r t i c u l a r l y in the persistent and

exchange rate po l ic ies) t o reduce domes t ic demand, a long with accelerated s truc tura l re forms . 

19. Conservative fiscal policy w i l l help address emerging inflationary pressures and external 
imbalances. 
While mindful o f

imbalances and the r em a i n i n g r e f o rm agenda, the Au tho r i t ies have seen these is sue s as re f lec t ing n o rm a l

that hard w o n macro-econom ic s tab i l i ty i s n o t put at risk. The p u b l i c sector in Serbia s t i l l makes up a 
very s ign i f ican t p r o p o r t i o n o f the t o t a l economy, at about 42 percen t o f GDP . F isca l adjustment over

d e f i c i t o f 1.5 percent o f GDP, with a s im i la r outcome expected f o r 2007. 

20. The Government’s stated fiscal policy aim i s to reduce public expenditure as a proportion o f 

GDP and strengthen the revenue base. The Budge t M em o r a n d um and 2008 Budge t recogn ize the need 
t o reduce the burden o f a r e l a t i v e l y large p u b l i c sector. The Gove rnmen t acknow ledges the reversals in

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

adjustments to productivity increases and the abandonment o f a policy o f equal pay for a l l within the 
public administration, public services and public enterprises. Implementation o f the 2008 budget w i l l 
provide an important indication o f the ability o f the coalition government to realize politically challenging 
economic policies. The Government also plans to reduce f i s c a l pressures through additional reductions in 
subsidies to state and socially owned enterprise. On the revenue side, further reforms should be aimed at 
better capturing o f informal activities, reduction o f tax compliance costs and improved collection o f taxes 
at municipal level. This w i l l be needed stimulate competitiveness and encourage stronger public revenues 
based on a growing economy and a wider tax base. Over the medium term, the Authorities anticipate a 
gradual decline in public expenditures as a proportion o f GDP, with public revenues remaining relatively 
constant as a proportion o f GDP. The IMF has suggested that additional f i s c a l measures beyond those 
currently anticipated may be required. 

2 1. The Government i s committed t o improving the quality of public spending. Public investment 

has increased as a proportion o f GDP over the past 4 years (from 2.4 percent in 2003 to an anticipated 4.3 
percent in 2007). The share o f investment in human capital (health care, education, science) and 
infrastructure (energy, transport environment) are targeted to increase, in order to provide the necessary 
environment to attract private capital and lay the foundations for sustainable economic development. 
Strengthening the operations o f the National Investment Plan (NIP) to ensure that investments are 
appropriately assessed and prioritized, w i l l be particularly important in this regard. 

22. Strengthened public financial management and reform o f public administration remain key 

priorities. The Budget Memorandum acknowledges that “management o f public finance i s subject to 
permanent improvement”. Ensuring that the independent State Audit Institution (SAI) established in 
September 2007 i s functioning effectively w i l l be central to improve controls on public financial 
management. Although the Serbian Government’s treasury system i s relatively strong, there i s a need for 
improvement in procurement and internal and external audit. Additional public administration reform i s 
intended to continue the ongoing public administration reform program with a focus on creating a more 
efficient public administration, based on 
the principles o f decentralization, depoliticization, 
professionalization and rationalization o f the c iv i l service. 

23. Monetary and exchange rate policies are targeted at stabilizing inflation and ensuring that the 
D ina r rate i s established based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The National 

Bank o f Serbia (NBS) w i l l continue to implement a policy o f a gradual reduction o f core inflation and its 
stabilization at a level that i s comparable with that o f EU countries. Tensions in macro-economic policies 
do persist, however, as the authorities try to balance objectives o f short-term price stability with the 
competitiveness o f the Dinar. 

ii. Promote dynamic economic growth, through accelerated economic reform 
24. Serbia’s growth rate o f 5.5 percent per annum over the past five years is , by international 
standards, a strong but not outstanding performance. Despite impressive achievements, Serbia 

remains at an early stage o f the transition process, having started later than most other countries in the 
region. Further reform efforts w i l l be required to ensure that incomes can continue to converge with 
European averages. The Government has stated its commitment to encourage dynamic private sector led 
economic growth through further structural reform to improve the business environment and strengthen 
the enterprise and financial sectors, and by undertaking needed investments and reform to improve critical 
infrastructure bottlenecks. 

7 

Serbia C o u n t y Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY l l 

Improving the Business Environment 

25. The Serbian Authorities have made significant progress toward improving competitiveness by 
improving the business environment. As noted above Serbia was a top reformer in 2004-2005. Still, 
Serbia ranks only 86 out o f 178 countries overall. The Government i s committed to undertaking 
additional reform to streamline business entry, including by reducing the time to register a business to 5 
days and introduce a one stop shop for business registration. The Government acknowledges the need to 
reduce the regulatory compliance burden, with the costs associated with the licensing and permit regime - 
and especially construction permits - highlighted by Do ing Business as a particular problem in Serbia and 
much o f the rest o f the Western Balkans. Competition legislation w i l l continue to be harmonized with 
EU regulations and strengthened, through the establishment i n 2006 o f a Competition Protection 
Commission, to ensure greater competition for public enterprises, particularly in the telecoms and energy 
sectors. A comprehensive regulatory reform strategy and “guillotine” process should also help to reduce 
compliance costs fo r business. 

26. Strengthening the capacity o f the judicial system to address business issues w i l l be important. 
Contract enforcement and the bankruptcy procedures remain cumbersome and expensive. Doing 
Business suggests that enforcing a contract in the courts still takes 21 months, while bankruptcy cases 
take over 30 months, are very costly, and generally result in a recovery rate o f le ss than 25 percent. 
Surveys continue to indicate that Serbia citizens are l e s s than fully confident about the impartiality o f the 
court system. The Government has prepared a strong judicial reform strategy, which w i l l inter a l ia help 
to address key issues affecting the business environment, including contract enforcement and bankruptcy 
proceedings, as well as significantly reduce the current case backlog and delays. As with most reforms, 
however, implementation w i l l be critical. As well as strengthening the impartiality o f the judicial system, 
streamlining jurisdictions, and ensuring a capacity to deal with complex business and economic cases, 
significant infrastructure investments are likely to be required to modernize the court system. 

Enterprise Sector Reform 

27. Further corporate reforms remain the key challenge outstanding from the pre-2000 period. 
Despite the impressive progress evident in the sale o f over 1,800 socially owned enterprises, more than 
1,000 enterprises so far remain unsold ( in some cases because they have not found buyers after one or 
more market tests). There appears to be a reluctance to date to use modern bankruptcy procedures 
introduced in 2005, even with the longer-term benefits such actions could generate by freeing up 
underutilized but productive assets. 
In addition, many large utility companies, such as the Naftna 
Industrija Srbije (NIS), Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), the railway company Zeleznice Srbije (ZS), 
Telecom Srbije, and JAT Airways, remain in public ownership. According to Serbian Government 
figures, remaining state, socially-owned, and mixed enterprises still require direct f i s c a l subsidies o f about 
2 percent o f GDP, in addition to indirect subsidies provided through non-payment o f arrears to state 
owned utilities. Subsidies are especially concentrated on a few companies, including RTB Bor and 
Zastava Group, which together accounted for nearly one-third o f the subsidies paid in 2006. 

28 . The Government has stated its strong commitment to continue w ith enterprise restructuring 
and privatization to improve the overall competitiveness o f the Serbian economy. 
I n the new 
Government’s first five months the privatization program for socially-owned enterprises has continued 
(all remaining enterprises are expected to have been offered for sa le by end o f 2008, with unsaleable 
companies going into liquidation procedure). The Government has stated i t s commitment to 
strengthening bankruptcy enforcement. Proposals for the privatization o f large state-owned enterprises 
remain under discussion. The Government appears committed to proceeding with the privatization o f 
JAT Airways and the airports. The privatization o f RTB Bor i s almost complete. Options for privatizing 
the o i l company (N IS ) are under consideration. Considerable further reform o f the railways (ZS) i s 

8 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for F YO b F Y l l 

anticipated, with further efforts to improve efficiency - including redundancies. Further reform o f the 
electricity sector i s also anticipated. Restructuring o f EPS to allow for greater private sector participation 
in new generation investments i s well underway. Further efforts to privatize approximately 400 
municipal enterprises, following the adoption o f the relevant legislation, are also anticipated. Overall, the 
Government expects that these measures w i l l allow for a continuing reduction in direct subsidies from 
current levels o f about 2 percent o f GDP. 

Financial Sector Reform 

29. Growing confidence in the economy, and relatively high levels o f global liquidity - at least 
until very recently - has led to an increase in financial intermediation and has drawn large capital 

inflows to Serbia. This has occurred mainly in the form o f foreign exchange deposits in the banking 
system, and more recently o f credits provided by foreign banks to their newly established affiliates 
(including leasing companies). These new resources have allowed banks to sharply increase lending. 
Credit to the private sector rose from about 1 8 percent o f GDP in 2002 to about 28.5 percent o f GDP by 
the end o f 2006. External debt has increased since 2004 (from 57.5 to 61.3 percent o f GDP at the end 
2006), despite significant declines in public debt. This partially reflects a shift in corporate borrowing 
from European banks rather than their Serbian a f f i l ia tes to avoid high reserve requirements imposed by 
the National Bank o f Serbia, leading to a rise in the share o f consumer borrowing from domestic banks. 
While foreign capital inflows have helped fuel Serbia’s economic recovery, they do r a i s e issues o f the 
vulnerability o f the f inanc ia l sector to capital flow reversals and exchange rate r i s k s . 

30. 
I n the past several years the GoS and the National Bank o f Serbia (NBS ) have made 
significant progress in restructuring the financial sector, notably through the resolution o f a number o f 

insolvent banks and insurers, the divestment o f nearly half i t s banking sector holdings and strengthening 
the regulatory regime underlying the banking, insurance and more recently the securities sectors. The 
Government has stated its intention to privatize i t s remaining f inanc ia l sector holdings in nine banks 
representing about 15 percent o f the banking sector, and divest the remaining assets held by the Deposit 
Insurance Agency (DIA) as a result o f previous bank sales and closures. The Government has indicated a 
commitment to insurance sector reform, including by enacting the new Motor Third Party Liability Law 
(MTPL) and amending the Insurance Law in order to ensure a level playing f ie ld between insurance 
companies, as well as to privatize the public owned insurer Dunav and i t s stake in DDOR ( to ta l 
Government holdings currently make up 60 percent o f the insurance sector). Strengthening o f capital 
markets would also help to consolidate and deepen f inanc ia l sector reforms. By improving firms’ access 
to equity and debt financing this could provide new sources o f capital and potentially mitigate credit risks 
toward large enterprises currently held by banks. Enhancing the regulatory and enforcement capacity o f 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) w i l l be especially important. 

Mee t ing Serbia’s T ranspo r t Infrastructure Needs 

31 . 

Improving the management o f Serbia’s transport assets i s critical to increase economic 

growth and regional linkages. Road and rail traffic has been growing significantly, although rail traffic 
has mostly been concentrated in the freight sector and remains well below levels experienced in the 
1980s. I n both cases, significant investment needs are evident. A t the same time, however, there i s also 
an urgent need to strengthen the management o f current assets and improve the efficiency o f public 
spending. Greater involvement o f the private sector in a l l transport sub-sectors may also offer 
opportunities t o encourage the construction o f new infrastructure, where financially viable, and allow the 
Government to increasingly focus public investment on much needed maintenance. Transport 
investments w i l l need to be made within the context o f the European Commission’s overall framework 
for South East Europe. Initiatives include the establishment o f an In fras truc ture Steering Group (ISG) in 
2001, which also includes representation from a l l relevant multilateral development banks and the 

9 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Stability Pact. A Memorandum o f Understanding on the development o f the South East Europe Core 
Regional Transport Network was signed by the ministries o f transports from SEE countries in June 2004 
and a Five Year Multi-Annual Plan was agreed with specific actions for each transport mode. The 
Memorandum o f Understanding also provides the institutional framework fo r cooperation through a 
Steering Committee which i s served by a Secretariat (SEETO). 

32 . 
Investments in the road sub-sector w i l l need to balance the very high priority placed by the 
Government on constructing European Corridor X, with the urgent need f o r maintenance o f 
existing assets. Corridor X, which runs from Austria, through Serbia to Greece has significant potential 
to increase Serbia’s overall integration into the European transport network, and considerable resources 
are being directed at the development o f the road network on this route. At the same time, the overall 
road system i s deteriorating, due to rapid traffic growth and limited maintenance, with about 40 percent o f 
primary roads and 70 percent o f secondary roads estimated to be in poor condition. Possible private 
sector involvement in major highway construction could potentially allow a reorientation o f public 
spending toward road maintenance that could help c lear a significant maintenance backlog and help to 
ensure roads are maintained before expensive rehabilitation i s required. There i s also an urgent need to 
strengthen the management o f assets and improve the efficiency o f public spending. Road quality i s also 
a factor in Serbia’s road safety record, with fatalities per vehicle about five times EU averages, although a 
substantial outreach campaign, a cross sectoral approach, and a strengthened legislative framework are 
also likely to be required to manage this concern. 

3 3 . Railway traffic, especially freight, i s increasing steadily - but a major reform effort remains 
to improve efficiency and to put the railways on a sustainable financial footing. Commercial 
revenues cover only half o f Zeleznice Srbije (ZS) working costs (excluding depreciation). ZS remains 
one o f the largest recipients o f state subsidies, totaling 0.5 per cent o f GDP ( 1 per cent including 
uncompensated asset depreciation). There has been progress in the introduction o f much needed reforms 
in the railway sector: a l l the countries in the region have initiated the process towards the separation o f 
railway infrastructure from operations in accordance with the broad principles set out in EC Directive 
91/440, and some have completed this process. The next stages o f the reform process - the establishment 
o f track access regimes and a common network statement - i s starting, with the support o f the EU and the 
World Bank - with an Addendum to the SEETO Treaty on this issue to be signed by a l l the Ministers o f 
Transport in the region in Tirana on the 4th December 2007. Still, much remains to be done. Efforts to 
increase overall railway revenues and improve efficiency, particularly o f the large labor force, w i l l also 
need to be accompanied by a transparent system o f public service contracts for necessary but loss making 
passenger services as well as a restructuring o f the ZS’s historical liabilities and additional maintenance 
financing to overcome bottlenecks. I n addition, improving the urban transport system i s becoming a 
priority, with the commuter rail services serving Belgrade representing an early priority. There i s scope 
to engage the private sector in such services, which could potentially be undertaken without financing or 
guarantees from the State Government. 

34. The inland water transport system has the potential to play a larger ro l e . Annual traffic 
volumes have increased significantly, reaching 8.4 million tons in 2005, approximately double 2000 
volumes. 
The Government i s moving to finalize the privatization o f river ports. 
Most ports have 
sufficient cargo handling capacity, but o ld and inefficient equipment. Privatization could help to bring in 
much needed investments to improve efficiency and undertake needed maintenance.

Energy Sector Reform and Opportunities 

3 5 . Serbia has considerable scope to benefit from participation in the regional energy market 
established under the Energy Community o f South East Europe (ECSEE) Treaty. Serbia has made 

important progress in reforming and upgrading its energy sector over the last few years. The financial 
position o f the power utility EPS has been strengthened by ta r i f f increases and significantly improved 
payment collection - although further tariff reform w i l l be required to allow EPS to cover its fu l l costs 
including depreciation and return on capital. This w i l l need to be accompanied by strengthening o f 
appropriate soc ia l safety nets to ensure that the poorest consumers are not made more vulnerable. 
Restructuring o f the energy sector consistent with EU guidelines and the ECSEE Treaty has resulted in 
the establishment in 2004 o f an independent regulator (although s t i l l with limited tariff setting authority), 
and the separation o f EPS’s generation, transmission and distribution assets. W h i l e the Government i s 
not currently considering the privatization o f EPS assets, this structure should help to ensure that there i s 
a level playing field to encourage private sector participation in new generation investments, such as the 
Kolubara plant which i s among the least cost generation options in South East Europe. An energy policy 
framework that encourages new private investment in generation capacity w i l l be especially important to 
resolve looming capacity shortages in Serbia, the region, and Europe more broadly, that threaten to 
undermine growth. 

36. 

Increased energy efficiency w i l l be a critical element i n managing future energy demand. 

Relative to its GDP, the Serbian economy i s four times more energy intensive than the EU average. The 
Government acknowledges the need to tap new opportunities for improving energy efficiency and fo r the 
development o f renewable and alternative energy resources. The Government i s introducing programs to 
improve energy efficiency, in particular in the public sector, as well as encouraging private financing 
schemes for energy efficiency investments. Recent ratification o f the Kyoto Protocol could facilitate the 
development o f renewable energy and improved energy efficiency through carbon financing 
opportunities. Expanded use o f natural gas, including gasification o f cen tra l heating for a significant 
number o f cities and towns could also improve energy efficiency. This will, however, require increased 
security o f supply in gas imports. 

3 7 . Further reform of the petroleum industry offers scope f o r significant benefits. The 

Government i s currently reviewing possibilities to privatize N I S . An open and transparent process that 
allows for majority private control o f NIS or a clear path toward majority control, has the potential to 
o f fe r certainty to investors and ensure the best price for the Authorities. Appropriate Government 
influence over the sector could then still be based on regulation. Serbian consumers could also save 
several hundred million Euros per year through import competition in petroleum products, and the 
Government i s considering options to replace the import ban on o i l products with a system o f import 
duties, scheduled to be gradually reduced to low EU levels by 2012. 

iii. Increasing Employment and Living Standards 
3 8 . The Government’s employment strategy i s focused on the private sector as the major 
generator o f new jobs, particularly in competitive export oriented small and medium enterprises. 

With sustained economic expansion the authorities are expecting to reverse the trend in recent years 
whereby employment growth in the “new” industries was counteracted by falling employment in the 
“old” industries. Nevertheless with some 250,000 workers (10 percent o f total employment) still 
employed in state and socially owned enterprises, there i s still likely to be a need fo r further redundancies 
- with up to 40,000 predicted over the next few years. The National Employment Strategy for the period 
2005-2010 se ts out the ambitious targets o f employment growth o f 1.5 percent a year with the 
unemployment rate decreasing from the current level o f 21.6 percent to 15.5 percent in 2010. 

11 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

39 . 

f o r 

Increasing employment, especially higher-productivity employment, w i l l be important 

raising living standards. The Government recognizes that significant reforms are still required to ensure 
that Serbia’s labor market has access to competitive human capital and that labor markets operate more 
efficiently and flexibly. Expanding job opportunities i s one o f the Government’s main economic policy 
priorities until 201 0. Currently Serbia’s employment rate lags well below many successful transition 
countries and EU targets. Recent o f f i c i a l statistics show that unemployment in Serbia remains 
approximately 2 1.6 percent. While improved employment performance w i l l require sustained economic 
growth and the completion o f the restructuring associated with the privatization program, a number o f 
reforms in the labor market w i l l also be crucial. Further reductions in labor taxation w i l l be important, but 
would need to be carried out in a fiscally responsible manner. Labor supply also needs to be upgraded and 
workers w i l l require better opportunities for training and retraining to adjust to ongoing structural changes 
in the economy. Labor market regulations should also be made more flexible, specifically in terms o f 
improving possibilities for fixed-term and part-time employment. This would have a particularly positive 
impact on job opportunities for women and young people. 

40. A particular challenge fo r Serbia w i l l be to ensure education i s linked more strongly w ith 

labor demand. High youth unemployment (including tertiary graduates) and comparatively poor 
performance in international assessments o f student learning, indicate that the education system i s not yet 
providing young people with the most appropriate skills and knowledge for a modern economy. These 
difficulties are compounded by wide differences in access to quality education. The development o f a 
comprehensive education strategy appears to be a high priority for the Government. This w i l l need to 
focus on improving teaching and learning standards, promoting greater education coverage and the reform 
o f resource allocation within the sector. The education system has a unique opportunity to use the 
expected dramatic decline in student numbers (due to falling birth rates) to reallocate resources towards 
improving quality, especially for the most disadvantaged students, including Roma population. At the 
secondary level, an important challenge w i l l be to expand coverage, including by restructuring the school 
network to reflect the changing geographical distribution o f the population, while scaling back the 
dominance o f vocational schools. Tertiary education w i l l need to be aligned along the lines o f the 
Bologna process to ensure better harmonization with EU standards. There i s considerable scope to 
promote greater regional cooperation in higher education, including greater recognition o f degrees from 
regional institutions and by promoting specialized “centers o f excellence” in individual countries. 

4 1 . Strengthening training and retraining to increase the knowledge and s k i l l s o f the labor fo rce 
to adjust to ongoing structural changes in the economy and industry w i l l be important. Adult 

education and training, even for those employed, i s scarce and does not allow for upgrading o f human 
capital in response to market demands. Strengthened programs to support the school to work transition 
would be valuable. Supporting the reform of National Employment Service to reorient active labor 
market programs that advance female and youth participation in the j o b market towards those with a 
proven record o f greater efficiency and success w i l l be a priority. 

42. Ensuring that Serbia’s social protection and pension systems i s better targeted and put on a 
more financially sustainable footing w i l l be important to protect the vulnerable. Poverty has fallen 

from 14.6 percent o f the population in 2003 to 8 .8 percent in 2007. 

43. Estimates suggest that the social insurance and social welfare payments have been critical in 
ensuring that poverty i s not one th ird larger than i t i s . Pension spending makes up the vast bulk - 

over 75 percent - o f total soc ia l protection payments. Nevertheless, ensuring that the system i s 
financially sustainable w i l l remain a challenge given large current deficits (equivalent to about 5 percent 
o f GDP) which w i l l be compounded by anticipated demographic changes and the expected aging o f the 
population. The Government undertook substantive pension reforms in 2005, including parametric 
reforms which w i l l move the pension system from a large deficit into surplus in the long run. As a result, 

12 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

pensions w i l l be linked to inflation rather than wage rises and the relatively low retirement age increased. 
Improving collections, however, remains a key issue to further improve the fiscal sustainability o f the 
current “first pillar” pension system. In the medium to longer-term, the Government i s also considering 
options to introduce voluntary - and eventually compulsory - private retirement savings schemes. 
International experience suggests, however, that the successful introduction o f such “second” and “third” 
pillar pensions schemes, however, are likely to require further strengthening o f the regulatory 
environment, and a deepening and broadening o f financial markets to ensure appropriate longer-term 
investment opportunities are available. 

44. Further efforts may be needed to strengthen the targeting of other social benefits. Soc ia l 

welfare schemes such as the family allowance (MOP) and child allowance cover approximately one in 
five households. Soc ia l welfare schemes in Serbia are o f relatively limited total size relative to 
neighboring countries, and cover roughly h a l f as many households as soc ia l insurance schemes such as 
pension and disability allowances. Except for the family allowance (MOP), social welfare schemes are 
not as closely targeted or as progressive as possible. Be t te r targeting o f such soc ia l welfare schemes, or 
an increase in the relative proportion provided through MOP rather than other mechanisms (possibly 
through the introduction o f a single welfare benefit), could help to reduce poverty. Soc ia l safety nets to 
reduce the impact on poor households o f needed increases in energy tariffs w i l l also be critical. 

45. A good health sector strategy i s in place, and the Government’s focus i s on continued 

implementation. Health outcomes in Serbia are broadly comparable to other middle income countries 
with similar incomes. Costs, however, are high: with public and private payments making up 
approximately 10 percent o f GDP. The Government i s committed to a strategy that w i l l increase the use 
o f primary health care providers and outpatient services, while improving the management o f expensive 
tertiary health care facilities. The reform program i s complicated by the fact that the health care system 
needs to be rapidly modernized and reconfigured to make the system able to more adequately respond to 
the rapid ageing o f the population, the increasing burden o f non-communicable diseases and to meet the 
expectations for quality care o f a well-educated and informed population. The enhancement o f private 
sector participation in the health sector provides potential opportunities to improve overall coverage and 
services. At the same time, the process o f decentralizing primary health care has to be managed carefully 
so as not to overload municipal capacities and to sustain reforms that have started in the rationalization o f 
hospitals and in payment methods at the primary health care level. 

iv. M o r e Balanced Regional Development 
46. The Government i s focused on the need to overcome significant regional disparities i n Serbia. 

The Authorities recognize that economic growth in Serbia, while strong and reasonably broad based, has 
still been characterized by a lack o f opportunities for people in underdeveloped regions in country. 
Despite significant reductions in the proportion o f rural people living in poverty (from 20 percent in 2004 
to 14 percent in 2006), the rural poverty rate remains more than treble the poverty rate in Belgrade 
(4.2%). Two thirds o f poor households in Serbia live in rural areas and depressed regions. Poverty i s 
particularly evident in depressed former mining and industrial centers in Southern and Eastern Serbia. 
Unemployment in parts o f the Bor region, for instance, i s as high as 40 percent o f the labor force. To 
overcome these challenges, a Regional Development Strategy was adopted early 2007. The strategy 
focuses on the upgrading o f regional infrastructure, the provision o f economic incentives and the roll-out 
o f active labor market programs to ensure more balanced country-wide development. The strategy i s 
fully consistent with EU principles o f localization. 

47. The Government recognizes that improved policy and management of Serbia’s natura l 
resources w i l l be critical to improve the welfare of the ru ra l population and to strengthen Serbia’s 

participation in European markets. Serbia i s well endowed with natural resources, including abundant 

13 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

agricultural land, forests and water resources. The authorities have developed and adopted an agricultural 
strategy in 2005 to increase competitiveness. Land consolidation could improve agricultural productivity, 
with over 70 percent o f farms in Serbia smaller than five hectares. While recent trade reforms have 
contributed to the liberalization o f the agricultural sector, more needs to be done to reduce the high levels 
o f tariff protection and subsidies which continue to delay the inevitable transformation process o f the 
agricultural sector. Serbia’s anticipated joining o f the World Trade Organization 2008 i s an important 
milestone in this direction. This transformation w i l l need to be managed in a way that ensures that small 
farmers continue to have opportunities, especially given the importance o f the agricultural sector as a 
“safety net” for many rural families. Early retirement programs and other forms o f income support for 
smaller farmers that encourage land consolidation and create new off-farm employment opportunities 
may be important elements o f such a program. 

48 . Reforms to ensure that EU pre-accession programs and financing can be utilized fully to 
support the transition o f Serbian agriculture w i l l be important. This w i l l require shifting f i s c a l 

support away from price based interventions towards support for on-farm investments. This approach i s 
also consistent with the Instrument for Pre-Accession for Rural Development and the evolution o f the 
Common Agricultural Policy. Further modernizing food safety and quality systems and agricultural 
pollution controls w i l l also be essential to increase farmers’ ability to meet rising consumer preferences 
for quality products and cross compliance requirements associated with Rural Development funds. 

49. Adapting to climate change effects w i l l be especially important f o r ru ra l communities 

dependent on agriculture. Projected climate change effects could potentially allow greater agricultural 
production in Serbia i f irrigation and other infrastructure i s in place. 
Improved water resource 
management and infrastructure can also reduce the variability in agricultural yields, increase productivity, 
and reduce the risk o f flooding. A t the same time, there i s a risk that the frequency and severity o f natural 
disasters, such as floods, droughts, forest f ires , and landslides could increase. A key challenge w i l l be to 
shift public sector intervention from disaster response to disaster risk reduction and climate change 
adaptation. Addressing natural hazards effectively w i l l require coordination within and between countries 
(such as in weather forecasting, early warning, the development o f plans for river catchments, including 
flood protection measures, and coordinated response to disasters). Such cooperation i s o f particular 
importance for the countries sharing river basins such as the Danube. Disaster insurance schemes and 
strengthened building codes could also be a central element in strengthening Serbia’s hazard risk 
mitigation and adaptation strategies. 

50. A t the same time, significant environmental issues associated with the legacies from heavy 
mining and industrial industries in regional towns, as well as in urban areas such as Belgrade w i l l 

also need to be addressed. Mining operations such as Bor and Resavica have significant environmental 
legacies that w i l l need to be addressed as part o f a broader regional development strategy. Attracting 
credible international investors to the 1,000 or so socially or state-owned enterprises that a re slated for 
privatization requires an inventory o f environmental liabilities attached to them and a strategy to address 
these liabilities. The mining and energy sector w i l l need particular attention based on global best practice. 
In addition, Belgrade i s also confronting increasing environmental issues, including air quality. 

5 1. Effective fiscal decentralization and municipal reform and strengthening w i l l be crucial to 

reduce regional disparities. The new Local Government Finance Law that came into effect in January 
2007 has improved the f i s c a l framework for municipalities by improving the transparency and 
predictability o f revenue transfers to loca l governments, and more equitably distributing revenues 
between municipalities. Significant disparities in per capita municipal revenues remain, however. In 
addition, strengthening the capacities o f municipalities and loca l service providers such as schools and 
hospitals to manage and implement their new responsibilities in an environment o f decentralized service 
delivery w i l l be c r i t ica l . Finally, municipalities w i l l need to increasingly take the opportunities available 

14 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for F Y O I - F Y I 1 

to increase financing for investments or to reduce loca l tax burdens to encourage investment. Following 
the approval o f the new Constitution, municipalities now also have more options to generate revenue from 
the sale o f land and companies. Better management o f approximately 400 municipally owned companies 
through restructuring, privatization or modernization could f r e e up significant amount o f resources. 
Currently, a significant share o f municipality expenditure appears to be covering the operating lo sse s and 
capital needs o f municipality owned enterprises 

IV. W O R L D B A N K GROUP PARTNERSH IP STRATEGY 

A. Participation and Partnerships 

i. Participatory Process Followed 
52. A Wo r ld Bank client survey was conducted in June 2007. I n order to actively include clients, 

stakeholders and partners in the World Bank’s strategic planning processes and get feedback on the 
Bank’s track record and future role in Serbia, a client survey was carried out in June 2007. 

53 . The majority o f the respondents assessed the Wo r ld Bank’s ro l e in Serbia as positive. The 

World Bank was seen as most effective in reinforcing the f inanc ia l system. A total o f 291 respondents 
responded to the survey, covering a l l economic sectors, organization types and geographical parts o f 
Serbia. Some 63 percent o f the respondents assessed the efficiency o f the World Bank’s work in Serbia 
in a positive manner, with most positive scores coming from Government representatives and other 
donors, and more negative assessments from academia, the media and NGOs. With regard to past 
activities, the respondents assessed the World Bank as having been the most effective in reinforcing the 
f inanc ia l system. A sizable portion o f respondents thought that the World Bank has not been efficient 
enough in increasing transparency in governance and in reinforcing the education sector. However, the 
World Bank was seen as effective in the reduction o f corruption due to its strict procurement rules. The 
World Bank’s technical expertise, its knowledge (studies and analyses) and its ability to share best 
practices were highly appreciated. 

54. M o r e than ha lf o f respondents thought that economic growth i s the most important 

development pr ior ity fo r Serbia. Economic growth was followed by job creation and improved 
incomes as the most important priorities. Fighting corruption, improving government effectivness, 
reducing poverty and improving the justice system were also seen as important fo c i for Serbia. Increased 
employment possibilities and the development o f the private sector were seen as two key development 
areas likely to contribute most to reduction o f poverty. 

5 5 . Respondents thought that the Wo r ld Bank should play an active ro l e in the future to support 

Serbia’s development efforts. An overwhelming majority (8 1 percent) o f the respondents thought that 
the World Bank w i l l play an important role in Serbia’s economic development and convergence with 
Europe. Respondents agreed that the World Bank’s mission in Serbia, as in other mid-income level 
countries, has yet to be completed. Respondents from governmental institutions attached the greatest 
importance to the World Bank contribution to Serbia’s future development, while respondents from other 
donor organizations saw the World Bank’s role as slowly diminishing. Respondents thought that the 
World Bank should focus its resources mainly on spurring economic growth and in promoting policies 
that stimulate foreign direct investment and create employment. Institutions who have worked closely 
with the World Bank believe that the Bank’s future analytical work in Serbia should focus on job 
creation, enhanced business environment and poverty surveys. I t was widely seen that South Eastern and 
Eastern Serbia are most in need o f the World Bank’s assistance. 

15 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

56 . Consultations w ith the Serbian Government and key partners and stakeholders were held to 
discuss the priorities for the Wor ld Bank’s engagement in Serbia. A set o f roundtable discussions 
were organized in July and October 2007 between the representatives o f the World Bank and the Serbian 
Government to discuss the priorities for future cooperation and how the World Bank could best support 
Serbia in i t s development efforts. Discussions have also been held with other major donors in Serbia. 
The EU has been consulted in the preparatory process o f the CPS, including in consultations on the World 
Bank’s future engagement in Serbia held in Brussels in la te October 2007. 

ii. Donor Coordination and Partner Roles 
57 . The Government manages and leads donor coordination in Serbia. I n order to promote country 
ownership, the World Bank, along with other major donors, has recently been encouraging, empowering 
and supporting the Government to adopt a leading ro le in donor coordination and harmonization. A 
Donor Assistance Coordination Unit (DACU), initially under the Ministry o f In terna t iona l Economic 
Relations, was established in November 2000 to act as a f o c a l point fo r donor assistance coordination. 
DACU was la ter transferred to the Ministry o f Finance which also i s charged with managing EU funds for 
Serbia. DACU i s tasked with facilitating and coordinating a l l donor support for Serbia. Furthermore, an 
informal intra-donor group meets regularly, comprising the 1 5 biggest bilateral and multilateral donors in 
Serbia. This group’s activities are jointly coordinated by UNDP and the World Bank. The Office o f the 
Deputy Prime Minister has also now established a foca l point for EU and PRS implementation, and this 
has helped to ensure a “whole o f government” approach. 

5 8 . 
Increased e f fo r ts are being made to harmonize the activities o f different development 
partners in Serbia and to align their programs w ith the Government priorities. After the adoption o f 
the Paris Declaration on donor assistance harmonization and in line with Serbia’s EU accession goals, 
DACU has been paying more attention to the harmonization o f donor assistance. With Serbia beginning 
to benefit from the EU’s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) funds, greater e f fo r ts are needed 
to strengthen donor coordination. The Government, recognizing this need, i s developing a three-year 
inter-sectoral programmatic planning tool, which w i l l be updated on a yearly basis, aimed at facilitating 
the programming o f donor funds. Donors have welcomed this approach and expressed their willingness 
to seek further alignment o f their programs with the Government’s own priorities and programs. 

5 9 . Serbia has received a significant amount o f international aid since the democratic transition 
in 2000, but aid volumes are decreasing. The Bank and the EC jointly chaired two major donor 
conferences in 2001 and 2003 to support Serbia in i t s development e f fo r ts . Serbia has received a total o f 
4.1 billion Euros in international assistance between 2000 and 2007. A id volumes are, however, expected 
to decline in the medium to long term. The Government’s objective i s to mobilize around 400 million 
Euros annually in external financing until it gains EU membership. The Government has expressed that i t 
hopes to receive half o f the sum in grants and the other half in loans and credits. A Serbia donor matrix 
(annex 4) gives an overview the activities o f different donors in Serbia. 
I n terms o f disbursement 
volumes, the four biggest bilateral donors in Serbia are the USA, Italy, Germany and Sweden. Many 
other European donors also provide valuable EU pre-accession support. Additionally, the UK supports 
the Government’s efforts to implement the PRS in Serbia. The United States, while maintaining a strong 
presence, plans to phase out support in 2010-201 1. The IMF currently has no program with Serbia - the 
previous arrangement between the IMF and Serbia expired in February 2006. Regular Article I V 
monitoring, however, provides a platform for continuing discussion between the Authorities and the IMF. 

60. The European Union i s clearly Serbia’s most important current and future development 
partner. I n this regard, practically a l l World Bank assistance i s aimed at helping Serbia in the process o f 
convergence with the European Union. EC assistance i s going through a transition from being provided 
through the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) to being channeled through IPA, with

countries, whereas the three la t ter components are a imed at EU candidate coun tr ies on ly . There fore 
Serbia, be ing a po ten t ia l candidate coun t ry t o EU accession, o n l y bene f i ts f r om ac t iv i t ies under the two

B. Implementation o f the Last CAS 

61. The previous CAS program from FY05 to FY07 was delivered largely as planned during the 
first half o f the program period, although improvements in the Government’s financial position led 
to the replacement o f an ambitious serious o f planned development policy operations in the second 
ha lf o f the CAS period by additional financing fo r well performing investments. With Serbia s t i l l at 

the ear ly stages o f the t rans i t ion process, con t inued suppor t f o r p o l i c y r e f o rm w i l l be requ i red - a l though 
this m a y need t o be pursued th rough ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry services as well as by the use o f new

W i th Serbia still at an early stage in the transition process, continuing the outstanding 
structural reform agenda must be a critical element in the forthcoming CPS, in order to 
encourage continued growth and increase jobs. Further enterprise reform, financial sector 

reform and improvements in the business environment w i l l be vital to help ensure current levels 
of growth can be sustained. Continuing efforts w i l l also be required to help ensure that a l l parts 
o f the population have the skills and ability to share in and benefit from economic growth. 

Development policy lending can be a useful instrument to support reform, although 
Serbia’s current economic position w i l l require the use o f innovative financing modalities, 
such as potentially deferred drawdown DPLs. The Government has indicated that a Bank 

program with specific benchmarks and timetables could assist them in pursuing a reform agenda, 
particularly on the private sector side. Nevertheless, the Government does not need significant 
balance o f payments support at this stage. While development policy lending can play a valuable 
role, the experience in the last CAS also suggests that i t should not be overused. Investment 
instruments, when well targeted and designed, can also be useful to assist the reform agenda. 

The Bank w i l l need to ensure that assistance i s able to be provided in response to client 

demand. With the transition from IDA to IBRD financing, as well as the range o f financing 
options available to Serbia, i t i s imperative that the Bank be even more responsive to Serbian 
priorities. Care fu l dialog with the client w i l l be required to ensure that the Bank can stay 
relevant, as w i l l greater flexibility. Identification o f new products, including deferred drawdown 
development policy operations, insurance and sub-national lending products w i l l require c lose 
consideration. At the same time, care w i l l be required to balance the need fo r flexibility and 
responsiveness with the need to ensure that Bank financing does indeed help to promote reform. 

Flexibility w i l l be critical given regional uncertainties and risks o f possible political 

instability. Even in a time o f relative stability, as during the past CAS period, the need to replace 
adjustment operations with new and scaled up investments emphasizes the need for flexibility. 

Engagement across the Bank Group, has been strong and w i l l continue to be important in 
meeting varied client demands through combining a depth o f country knowledge with 
global expertise. 

IFC and M IGA w i l l become an increasingly central element o f the Bank 
Group’s engagement in Serbia over the coming years. There i s considerable scope to exploit 
potential synergies between different parts o f the institution to encourage the further development 
o f the financial sector (pensions, insurance, housing), and to support the private provision o f 
infrastructure and social services. 

C. The Wor ld Bank Group Partnership Strategy FYOS t o F Y l l 

i. Key Features and Themes of the Partnership Strategy 
64 . A four year program of support i s designed to ensure that the Wor ld Bank programming 
cycle i s consistent with the anticipated political cycle in Serbia. Following Parliamentary elections in 

January 2007, the normal Parliamentary term in Serbia would run until the end o f 2010. The CPS 
consequently coincides with the current Parliamentary mandate. 

65 . The Wor ld Bank Group w i l l support Government priorities i n three key areas: 

i. encouraging dynamic private sector led growth to ensure incomes continue to converge with 
European levels; 
ii. providing opportunities and broadening participation in growth; and 
iii. managing emerging environmental and disaster risks. 

18 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

6 6 . The Bank Group’s strategy i s broadly structured around the Serbian Government’s 
development strategy as set out in the PRS, EU integration strategy, and the 2008 Budget 

Memorandum and 2008 Budget. The Government’s strategy has the key aims o f : (i) maintaining 
macro-economic stability, (ii) promoting dynamic private sector led growth through accelerated economic 
reform, and (iii) increasing employment and living standards and encouraging more balanced regional 
development. Among the 
international community, key responsibility for supporting Serbian 
Government efforts to maintain macro-economic stability rests with the IMF, although the Bank Group 
w i l l provide advice and support consistent with its mandate. Other themes in the Bank Group strategy 
correspond with the Government’s overall priorities. The Bank w i l l also work with the Serbian 
Government to manage emerging environmental and disaster r i s k s in order to address key global and 
regional public goods. 

6 7 . The Wo r ld Bank Group program w i l l support Serbia i n its efforts to join the European 
Union, consistent w ith the Bank Group’s comparative advantages. 

Integration with Europe w i l l 
require significant efforts to harmonize regulations and standards as well as significant investments, 
including to improve environmental management. EU accession requirements w i l l be integrated into a l l 
aspects o f the Bank Group’s program, and there i s scope for the Bank to assist the Authorities to 
strengthen the structures and systems that w i l l allow Serbia to take fu l l advantage o f the opportunities 
potentially offered by EU IPA financing, should Serbia continue along the European process. At the 
same time, Bank support w i l l need to be carefully targeted to complement the Government’s own 
resources and financing, support available from the EC, and other multilateral and bilateral assistance. 
Bank support i s not intended to address a l l aspects o f Serbia’s outstanding reform agenda. The EU, for 
instance, i s generally best placed among the international community to support overall reform o f public 
administration, with the Bank enhancing capacity and promoting reform at the sectoral level. Similarly, 
the Bank w i l l support the IMF in its lead role in working with the Authorities to maintain macro- 
economic stability. 

6 8 . Support fo r Serbian Government priorities w i l l be coordinated and integrated across a l l parts 

o f the Wo r ld Bank Group. Bank Group support i s intended to be mutually reinforcing and 
complementary. Interventions from IBRD, IFC and M IGA w i l l be coordinated closely and are expected 
to have strong synergies - although i t also needs to be recognized that IFC financing and M IGA 
guarantee products are to some degree driven by private sector demand, investment opportunities 
available through the privatization process, and the scope made available by legislative reform in Serbia 
to widen options for public-private partnerships and expand. MIGA’s involvement w i l l also be affected 
by investors’ perceptions o f political risk. Particular scope exists fo r collaboration on sub-national 
financing, including to the City o f Belgrade. Joint analytical products are also proposed, such as to 
explore opportunities fo r encouraging greater private sector involvement in the delivery o f soc ia l services 
such as health, education, and private pension funds. Scope also exists for complementary support in the 
energy and transport sectors, particularly with the greater use by the Serbian Government o f public- 
private financing arrangements for new infrastructure investments. 

6 9 . Support w i l l need to use a full range o f financial and non-financial instruments to respond to 

client demand. Particularly with Serbia’s graduation to IBRD, the Bank w i l l need to be even more 
flexible to ensure that support i s responsive to Government priorities. New pricing o f IBRD financing 
products w i l l especially help to ensure that the Bank i s competitive with other sources o f financing 
available to Serbia. The Government has expressed its preference for a continued relationship with the 
Bank Group, involving both financial and analytical assistance, as well as support to encourage further 
private sector led investment. The Government recognizes the value added and comparative advantages 
that can be brought by the Bank Group. Nevertheless, given Serbia strong f inanc ia l position, access to 
alternative sources o f financing, and significant EC grant funds, the Bank w i l l need to continue to adjust 
its business model to remain responsive to Serbian requirements. This i s likely to require the deployment 

19 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

o f a range o f financial instruments beyond traditional lending. Options such as deferred drawdown 
development policy operations to support the Government’s reform program while allowing for 
disbursement flexibility are likely to be central to the IBRD program. The Bank w i l l also explore 
innovative financial products, including disaster and catastrophe risk insurance. Options to use fee for 
service arrangements might a lso allow greater scope to respond to Serbian Government requirements for 
analytical support in specialized areas, including privatization. 

70. Wo r ld Bank support w i l l need to be flexible to respond to changing demand and the evolving 
situation in Serbia and the Western Balkans region. Within the strategic framework outlines in this 

CPS, mechanisms have been introduced to ensure that support i s able to be tailored and adjusted to meet 
emerging needs. This CPS outlines a set o f agreed investments and analytical support fo r FY08 and 
FY09. Indicative areas for potential engagement in the second half o f the CPS period are also set out. 
Nevertheless, decisions on interventions in the latter half o f the CPS period w i l l be made as part o f a mid- 
term review process anticipated for late calendar year 2008. Additional financing options also provide 
scope to respond flexibly and sca le up support for well performing investments, within the total financing 
envelope available. Adjustments w i l l be possible within the CPS period. 

71. As well as a co re program o f IBRD and I F C financing and M I G A guarantees, the Wo r ld 
Bank Group w i l l undertake analytical wo rk and advisory services to help encourage an authorizing 

environment fo r reform. A large element o f the World Bank’s analytical work and technical assistance 
w i l l be linked to the proposed lending and investment program. A t the same time, however, ana ly t ica l 
work and technical assistance can also be provided in areas that the Bank Group considers critical, but 
where there may not yet be a clear consensus for reform. The Serb ia Econom ic Memorandum , scheduled 
for FY08, and a Pub l ic Investment and Expend i ture Management Review scheduled for FY09 particularly 
provide vehicles for the Bank to engage the Government in a broad based dialogue on policy issues. This 
w i l l be supplemented by separate analytical pieces considering specific policy issues. Analytical services 
and technical assistance can also potentially be provided in areas in which financing limitations may 
prevent investments in the early years o f the CPS period. IFC advisory services w i l l continue to be 
focused in 4 business lines: SMEs and linkages; business enabling environment; access to finance; and 
infrastructure advisory operations 

P r i o r i t y 1: Dynam ic P r iva te Sector Led G row th to Ensure Incomes Converge w i t h Eu rope 

72. Although Serbia’s economic transition i s relatively recent, the country has come a long way. 

Economic growth has been strong, and average incomes continue to increase. Progress has been 
underpinned by significant structural economic reform, with major improvements in the business 
environment, a vibrant financial sector, and significant enterprise restructuring and privatization. 
Continuing the next stage o f the transition agenda, however, w i l l be vital i f Serbia i s to encourage 
dynamic private sector led growth that w i l l be able to ensure that average GDP per capita, currently about 
$5,400, continues to converge with EU member states. 

73. A proposed se r ies o f development policy operations (DPLs) are intended to anchor I B R D ’ s 
support to Serbia through the in it ia l stages o f the CPS period. While Serbia currently has limited 

financing needs, the Government has suggested that a World Bank DPL program could support the 
overall reform program. A t least in the initial stages o f the CPS period, the Government’s limited 
financing requirements mean that such a DPL se r ie s might be structured as deferred drawdown operations 
(DDOs), although DPLs could also involve direct financing if required (further details o f how DPLs 
might be structured i s provided in paragraph 102 below). A maximum o f one DPL would be disbursed in 
the first half o f the CPS period, and only one DDO would be outstanding at any one time. The potential 
use o f DPLs in the second half o f the CPS period w i l l be considered in the mid-term review. Even i f 
DDOs are not drawn down, Bank engagement could potentially provide an important signaling effect to 

20 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY I I 

other international actors to help demonstrate the seriousness and commitment with which the 
Government plans to pursue reform. As with a l l DPLs, such operations w i l l depend on a satisfactory 
assessment on the overall macro-economic situation in Serbia, and the completion o f appropriate reforms 
to justify financing before operations are brought to the Board. I t w i l l be important that these operations 
are not overloaded and concentrate on supporting reforms which are both critical for Serbia’s overall 
development as well as in which the Government i s committed to moving forward. 

74. 

Initially, DPL operations w i l l focus on supporting Government e f fo r t s to promote private 

sector led growth. This w i l l include: ( i ) further improving the business environment, particularly 
cumbersome licensing and permit arrangements identified by Doing Business as a difficulty throughout 
the Balkans region; ( i i ) completing divestiture o f socially-owned enterprises; ( i i i ) strengthening 
enforcement o f bankruptcy and other mechanisms to ensure the assets o f insolvent socially-owned 
enterprises unable to be sold can be freed up for productive use; (iv) divest remaining financial sector 
holdings; and (v) continuing the process o f privatizing and restructuring o f large state-owned enterprises 
following the sale in 2006 o f the mobile telephone operator. 

75 . There i s scope fo r development policy operations and investments in future years to support 
Serbian Government efforts to strengthen governance, which w i l l facilitate growth. Strengthening 

the functioning o f the State Audit Institution (SAI) w i l l be central to the Bank’s DPL ser ies o f operations, 
and associated technical assistance in this regard w i l l also be provided. The Bank w i l l also engage 
through its analytical and advisory services to highlight areas in which further streamlining o f public 
administration could help to reduce the overall f i s c a l burden in Serbia. This work, however, w i l l need to 
be undertaken in support o f the IMF’s lead ro le in this area. Should the Government demand, DPL 
operations could also increasingly be focused on supporting the public sector reform agenda. A strategy 
to strengthen governance and anti-corruption might focus on: (i) justice sector modernization; (ii) 
controlling corruption; and ( i i i ) improving economic transparency including public sector f inanc ia l 
management, the business environment and the privatization process. The Government has initiated 
e f for ts to improve on a l l three dimensions, and Bank support w i l l work in coordination with other donors 
to accelerate reforms. I n addition, following the completion o f the Accounting and Auditing Report on 
Standards and Codes (ROSC), the Bank w i l l provide assistance, through an institutional development 
fund (IDF) grant, to support the establishment o f a Steering Committee to develop a Country Action Plan 
(CAP) to enhance the quality o f corporate financial reporting. This w i l l need to be done within the 
framework o f the EU body o f law related to companies, financial reporting, auditing, and financial 
institutions complemented by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Standards 
on Auditing (ISA) and good international practice. In addition, consistent with the Governance and Anti- 
corruption (GAC) Strategy Implementation Plan being developed for the Europe and Central Asia region, 
opportunities fo r individual investments to strengthen governance and reduce rent seeking opportunities 
in specific sectors w i l l be considered at the time o f project development. 

76. A l l parts o f the Bank Group, including I F C , M I G A and W B I are likely to play an 
increasingly central ro l e in the Bank Group’s overall e f fo r t s to support the remaining transition 
agenda and stronger growth in Serbia. 

IFC’s focus in Serbia includes two major objectives: (i) 
facilitating restructuring and ownership change in the enterprise sector; and (ii) helping Serbia improve its 
competitiveness. 
IFC, in cooperation with the IBRD, w i l l o f fe r its global expertise and analytical 
capacity to support government’s initiatives to speed up the process o f restructuring and ownership 
change. IFC expect to play a crucial role in infrastructure (airports, ports, and logistics), and the further 
development o f the f inanc ia l sector. A t the national level, IFC advisory services jointly with the Bank, i s 
providing assistance on the regulatory reform to improve the quality o f regulations affecting the cost and 
risk o f doing business in Serbia. In addition, Sweden has provided trust fund financing to assist the 
World Bank Group (including IFC and WBI) to assist in the design and implementation o f a guillotine 
review o f the existing regulations and to provide technical assistance to encourage regulatory reform in 

21 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

order to improve the existing regulatory environment, and to introduce a regulatory impact assessment to 
ensure new regulations are not unduly burdensome for business. A t the sub-national level, IFC has 
embarked on a pilot project to assist 4 municipalities in streamlining and simplifying regulations affecting 
business operations. Through the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program, the stock o f outstanding 
disputes w i l l also be addressed, thereby releasing additional capital for investment. Also, IFC i s 
commercializing through its recycling linkage program the small street collectors who in Serbia are 
significantly comprised o f the Roma population. M IGA w i l l also continue to support foreign investors 
through the provision o f political risk guarantees. 

7 7 . The Bank Group w i l l support further strengthening o f the Serbian financial sector. The 
financial sector i s vibrant, with extensive participation by foreign institutions. Extremely strong credit 
growth, although from a relatively low base, has helped to drive recent economic growth in Serbia. IFC 
w i l l seek opportunities to offer analytical and advisory support for the privatization o f some remaining 
state owned banks and insurance companies though pre-privatization investments and advisory services. 
IFC proposes to partner with its existing and new bank clients to expand access to finance for key 
segments such as energy efficiency, housing, agribusiness and SME sectors. In addition IFC can support 
development o f non-bank financial institutions such as private voluntary pension funds, leasing 
companies, factoring companies and insurance companies. IFC w i l l consider opportunities to support the 
state owned First Mortgage Insurance Company through technical assistance and, if the company i s 
privatized, through an investment. By improving corporate governance, and introducinglsupporting new 
financial instruments, IFC could also play a role in facilitating capital markets development. For 
example, IFC w i l l continue to provide its support to the government to improve the legal framework in 
the financial sector such as the preparation o f the new securitization law. M IGA w i l l consider 
opportunities to support foreign investors in the financial sector, focusing on projects which promote the 
development o f non-bank financial institutions, such as leasing companies, improve SMEs’ access to 
finance, and strengthen banks’ capitalization. 

78. 

Improv ing infrastructure w i l l be important to support economic growth and promote 
regional integration. Greater use o f public-private partnerships (PPPs) o f fe r particular scope to improve 
infrastructure given public sector budgetary limitations, and the scope for greater efficiency in the 
delivery o f infrastructure services. The Bank Group i s providing coordinated advice to the Government 
on options fo r strengthening such engagement in a way that also minimizes contingent liabilities on the 
budget. I n addition, IFC, i n cooperation with the Bank and in coordination with EBRD, EIB and the EU, 
i s open to o f fe r its advice to the Government to structure PPP transactions in a transparent, competitive, 
sustainable and prompt manner. IFC w i l l seek opportunities to o f fer support through its pre-privatization 
investments as well as advisory services in the o i l and transportation sectors. This can build on the work 
undertaken by IFC in the JAT airways pre-privatization process. 

79 . A proposed IBRD railways investment, potentially in the form o f 2 phase Adjustable 
Programmatic Loan (APL), w i l l support key infrastructure needs, as well as supporting the significant 
outstanding reform agenda o f the authorities. Currently, the Serbian railways sector i s a significant loss 
maker, with annual operating losses in the order o f $200m. The “balkanization” o f the former Yugoslav 
railways system has fragmented rail services and led to declining competitiveness and considerable 
i n e f f i c i e n c i e s . As well as financing needed infrastructure investments on the primary rail corridors, this 
w i l l support the rationalization and potential privatization o f parts o f the rail operating system, and 
encourage greater regional cooperation in the Balkans (such as equipment pooling and joint marketing). 

80. Support for the energy sector could assist Serbia to maximize the potential benefits from 
participation in the South East Europe regional energy market. Serbia, with Bank support, i s continuing 
with the restructuring o f Elektroprivreda Srbije, in order to allow an equal playing field for private 
investments and better cost recovery. A potential additional IBRD financed investment to rehabilitate the 

22 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Zvornik hydro-power plant offers scope to increase generating capacity, although Bank support i s likely 
to have to be based on Serbia’s continued participation in the Energy Community o f South East Europe. 
Planned new thermal generation investments are likely to be more appropriately financed by new private 
sector investment, although there may be some need for continued public financing. Subject to 
government’s progress with the reforms in this sector, the Bank Group could potentially support such 
investments through the provision o f a partial risk guarantee, or through a M IGA guarantee or IFC 
financing for potential private sector investors. 
IFC w i l l also actively pursue opportunities for 
investments to support other private sector infrastructure provision. A t the same time, the Bank w i l l also 
provide analytical and advisory support to the Authorities regarding options to strengthen the soc ia l safety 
net to offset the impact o f required ta r i f f increases on the poorest households. 

81 . Financing and analytical support to strengthen Serbia road transport links with the region could be 
provided in the latter part o f the CPS period. In particular, the completion o f Corridor X from Austria, 
through Serbia to Greece remains a very high priority for the Government. This link i s part o f the 
European highway network. Completion i s likely to require some form o f public-private partnership. 
Bank financing could potentially support the public sector engagement in such a development. IFC and 
M IGA could also potentially support private investments. Further support for maintenance, and a much 
needed investment in road safety, have also been requested by the Government o f Serbia. 

82. At the sub-national level, there i s scope for further Bank Group support for needed infrastructure 
investments without a sovereign guarantee. IFC expects to continue its successful cooperation with the 
City o f Belgrade and work on completing the concession o f the Belgrade solid waste services by March 
2008, and w i l l explore opportunities for extending such support to other municipalities, either directly or 
in partnership with banks. There i s also potentially scope for support to strengthen urban transportation 
systems in Belgrade. One o f the impediments to PSP at the sub-national level has been the legislative 
framework, including requirements in the Concession Law for extensive and detailed involvement o f the 
Central Government, including in municipal projects. M IGA could potentially play a role in promoting 
foreign infrastructure investments at the sub-national level through the provision o f political risk 
guarantees, including in the solid waste sector. 

83 . There i s scope for I F C and M I G A to provide additional support fo r successful and growing 
local companies. 
IFC investments are likely to focus particularly in sectors where Serbia has been 
competitive in the regional market such as agribusiness and I T sectors, in sectors that have a multiplier 
affect on economic growth such as rea l estate and construction materials, as well as in sectors which 
generate significant employment. I n addition, IFC w i l l support green-field FDI, including the expansion 
o f regional players in Serbia, which are important to balance the large current account deficit. IFC w i l l 
continue to target SMEs, channeling more financing to them through commercial banks and micro- 
lending institutions. In addition, IFC i s looking for other instruments to support SMEs such as through 
risk sharing facilities and leasing. M IGA i s open to support foreign investment in the manufacturing and 
agri-business sectors. M IGA w i l l also consider opportunities to support SME development through its 
Small Investment Program. 

P r io r i t y 2: Prov id ing Opportunities and Broadening Par t ic ipa t ion in G row th 

84 . Strong and broad-based growth needs to be accompanied by measures to ensure wider 
participation in productive economic activities. Growth in Serbia has flowed through to significant 
increases in average incomes and reductions in poverty. Still unemployment remains stubbornly high. 
Regional differences in poverty remain a challenge, particularly in depressed former industrial and mining 
centers. Providing opportunities and retraining to allow mobility o f workers from declining to growing 
sectors w i l l be important, especially given the urgent need for further restructuring o f the enterprise 
sector. Ensuring young people have the necessary skills j o i n the workforce w i l l be crucial to overcome 

23 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

high youth unemployment and maintain social cohesion. And further efforts w i l l be needed to strengthen 
the provision o f soc ia l services, particularly, but not only, in the context o f decentralization. 

85 . The Bank w i l l support Serbian Government e f fo r t s to strengthen the delivery o f improved 

social services at a decentralized level. The decentralization process in Serbia enjoys broad political 
support, and should help to bring service delivery closer to clients, consistent with European principles. 
Experience elsewhere in Eastern Europe suggests that ca re fu l implementation i s needed to ensure that 
limited capacities at the loca l level do not adversely impact service delivery in the short term. The Bank 
w i l l work with the Authorities to help to ensure that education, health and social protection service quality 
can be maintained as financing and responsibilities are transferred to the municipal level. This w i l l build 
on the Bank’s previous and current engagement in the education, health and pensions sectors. Such an 
investment w i l l help to increase the access o f households - and particularly households from marginalized 
groups - to quality health, education and soc ia l protection services delivered at the loca l level. 

86 . The Bank w i l l respond to Government requests fo r support to provide opportunities fo r 
people in poorer areas in Southern and Eastern Serbia. Bank support w i l l extend the model currently 

being used in the former mining region o f Bor to the Resavica region. In addition to assisting the 
Government to restructure loss-making state owned mining companies and address environmental and 
soc ia l legacies associated with restructuring o f mining and other heavy industries, investments w i l l focus 
on fostering new sources o f economic growth and job creation i n the region. This could include micro- 
finance and SME development, retraining and targeted active labor market programs fo r former mine 
workers. The investment w i l l build on the Bank’s extensive experience in supporting mining sector 
restructuring, including in Poland, Romania and Russia. 

8 7 . Additional support could be provided during the CPS period to support educational reform 
aimed at ensuring that school leavers have the s k i l l s to more easily enter the job market and 

participate in the growing economy. Options might include support to restructure the secondary 
vocational education system to ensure that skills provided better meet the need o f a rapidly changing 
economy, assistance to help school leavers make the transition from school to work, and support to 
refocus active labor market programs toward those activities that have been proven to be relatively more 
effective. This could build on the Bank’s previous engagement in education reform, as well as testing o f 
active labor market approaches. Options are also being explored to encourage greater regional 
cooperation in reform o f the higher education system, possibly including greater specialization between 
institutions, as well as efforts to ensure wider recognition o f degrees, and reform consistent with the 
European Bologna process. Some targeted support may be provided to continue reforms o f hospital 
payment methods, which have just started and need to be sustained over the medium term to result into 
more efficient use o f resources and better quality o f services 

8 8 . 

I FC and the Bank propose to collaboratively explore the opportunities fo r greater private 
participation in social service delivery. 

Introducing private health and education services could 
strengthen overall service delivery. The introduction o f private pension schemes also potentially offers 
scope for greater engagement by the private sector. This work w i l l build on the Bank’s extensive 
engagement in each o f the sectors in Serbia. Such an analysis could provide a platform to support greater 
investments by IFC in these sectors. 

P r i o r i t y 3 : Manag ing Eme rg ing Env ironmen ta l and Disaster Risks 

8 9 . Addressing emerging environmental issues and managing risks o f natura l disasters are 

becoming increasing priorities in Serbia. Since the early 2000s, Serbia has made significant progress 
in reforming its legal and institutional framework for environmental management along EU lines. Also 
notable i s the progress made in incorporating environmental concerns into key economic sectors, through 

24 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

strategies and investment projects, such as in agriculture (sustainable landscape management as integral 
part o f rural development in South-East Serbia and agricultural pollution control) and energy (notably 
energy efficiency and dust reduction at a thermal power plant). Serbia also distinguishes itself in the 
Western Balkans by beginning to address ongoing and legacy environmental issues as part o f the 
privatization process (Bor mining and smelting complex). However, significant policy, implementation 
and enforcement challenges remain with regard to water pollution from municipal and industrial sources, 
air pollution from industry, thermal energy generation and transportation, municipal and hazardous waste 
management, biodiversity and natural resource management. Increasing investments w i l l be needed to 
implement the EU environment Acqu is as i t i s transposed into Serbian legislation. Recent floods, 
droughts and fires have highlighted the need for effective regional disaster preparedness and response 
capabilities. These issues are also thrown into relief by the increasingly apparent need for climate change 
mitigation and adaptation measures. 

90 . A South East E u r o p e Reg iona l D isaster M i t i g a t i o n I n i t i a t i v e has the potential to reduce the 

vulnerability o f countries in the region to natural disasters by building preparation and response capacities 
and promoting a coordinated approach to disaster risk mitigation. Initial investment could potentially 
support hydrological and meteorological forecasting and flood early warning systems, strengthening 
regional disaster response capacities, and using innovative insurance and other f inanc ia l products to 
finance disaster losses and spread risk. A framework fo r such an initiative i s already under discussion 
among regional countries, and there i s scope for the Bank in partnership with other bodies - particularly 
the EC - to support these common efforts. Serbia i s also starting to be affected by climate change. 
Strengthened irrigation facilities w i l l be especially important for Serbia to manage climate change, and to 
potentially increase crop yields. The Bank has been extensively engaged in supporting irrigation and 
f lood control work in Serbia, but this could potentially be expanded even further in the latter period o f the 
CPS through efforts to scale up an initial disaster preparedness investment. 

91. The introduction o f an energy efficiency fund, similar to that supported by the GEF in Bulgaria, 
could provide opportunities for Serbia. Such an investment could potentially support a large increase in 
energy efficiency investments in Serbia through initial grant support to establish a self-sustaining, market 
based financing mechanism that could develop and implement financially profitable energy efficiency 
activities, which could help to ensure sustainable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions without relying 
on public subsidies. Such a fund would be complementary to, and could work in parallel with, potential 
credit lines to commercial banks for energy efficiency activities being explored by EBRD. IFC also 
proposes to play an increasing role in Serbia in commercialization o f new climate friendly technologies 
especially in sectors such as power generation, transportation and energy use. Recently, IFC provided a 
loan and advisory services to Procredit Bank Serbia to implement its energy efficiency improvements 
program. The project, the first IFC’s loan in Serbia promoting energy efficiency improvements and 
facilitating the use o f cleaner and renewable sources o f energy in housing and in micro and small 
enterprises, i s expected to have significant demonstration effect in the market in Serbia. IFC w i l l continue 
to provide both funding and advisory services to lo ca l institutions to develop and mainstream energy 
efficiency focused funding programs. 

92 . Serbian Parliamentary ratification o f the K y o t o P ro toco l in September 2007 sets the stage for the 
country to participate in flexible carbon trading mechanisms. This could potentially allow Serbia to 
benefit from the sale o f emission reduction units associated with new project investments. The ability to 
benefit from the Kyoto Protocol w i l l also provide incentives for the publicly owned forest utility to 
undertake increases re-forestation. Grant funds are available from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) 
to ass is t countries that have ratified or acceded to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organ ic 
po l lutants (POPS). This could potentially assist Serbia to manage obsolete stockpiles o f POPS (such as 
pesticides, industrial chemicals, and unintentional toxic industrial byproducts which are o f global concern 
and which remain active over long periods o f time) and demonstrate best available technologies to

94. The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope o f $600 million over four years, 
distributed relatively evenly between years. Reflecting Serbia’s improved economic position, 
financing w i l l be on IBRD terms , as w i t h other middle-income countries. The ava i lab i l i ty o f IBRD 
financing w i l l a l low an increase in the envelope that wou ld have been available f rom constrained I D A 
resources. A t $150 m i l l i o n per annum, the base case envelope i s equivalent to a 25 percent increase on 
the average provided in the previous CAS period f rom 2004 to 2007. Proposed investments and 
analytical and advisory support dur ing the course o f the CPS are se t out in Table 2 (above). Investments 
in the latter part o f the CPS period w i l l be decided f lex ib ly based on priorities determined in a CPS m id- 
t e rm review scheduled fo r late calendar 2009. 

Creditworthiness Issues 

95. Anticipated lending volumes are based on Serbia’s creditworthiness position continuing to 
improve from the current situation. Serbia’s creditworthiness has improved considerably since i t 
became a member o f the Bank in 200 1. In USD te rms , GDP in 2007 i s more than double that in 2002. 
Grow th has been accompanied by serious structural reforms to improve the business environment and the 
functioning o f the en te rp r ise sector. Public debt has almost halved as a propor t ion o f GDP. Reserves 
have increased significantly, to now stand at $13.7 b i l l i o n - over 30 percent o f GDP, or more than 
Serbia’s to ta l stock o f public external debt. In 2006, Serbia prepaid approximately Euro 320 m i l l i o n to 
the Wo r ld Bank to cover obligations fa l l ing due on 2 o f 3 IBRD consolidation loans until the end o f 2009. 
On the other hand, risks to Serbia’s creditworthiness pos i t ion remain, particularly given external 
imbalances. This i s evident, in the rapid increase in private external debt, resulting in overall ex te rna l 
debt fa l l ing on ly s l igh t ly over the past f ive years despite a significant improvement in the Government’s 
own debt position. Real exchange rate appreciation and, after a significant adjustment between 2003 and 
2005, recent relaxation in fiscal policy, i s also pu t t ing pressure on a persistent double d ig i t current 
account de f ic i t that i s starting to again widen. A n d to ta l Wo r ld Bank ( IDA and IBRD) exposure, at 
approximately $2.8 b i l l ion , remains significant - although i s projected to continue to decline as share o f 
GDP. H is tor ica l data and projections regarding key macro-economic indicators are set out in Table 3.

96. Projections are based on a continuation o f the reform program, as outlined in Serbian 
Government economic policy documents. Growth i s projected to decline from 7.0 percent in 2007 to an 
average o f 5 .5 percent in 2009-1 1, close to historical levels for the f i r s t half o f the decade. Due to modest 
declines in both the tax burden and public expenditures relative to GDP, the consolidated f isca l deficit i s 
projected to remain broadly unchanged. Modest deficits, combined with the e f fec ts o f continued growth 
and availability o f non-debt financing (esp. privatization proceeds), are projected to lead to further 
decreases in public debt as a share o f GDP. Current account deficits are set to decline slightly from a high 
14.6 percent o f GDP in 2007, but to levels which s t i l l remain significantly above those observed in the 
f i r s t h a l f o f the decade. Following their massive buildup in the period to 2007, external reserves are 
projected to remain constant during 2007-1 1, working to curtail external financing needs. Inflows o f 
foreign direct investment are projected to average 4.3 percent o f GDP over the period 2007-1 1, partly 
supported by a s t i l l significant pipeline o f large-scale privatizations, including the Bor mining complex, 
two large insurance companies, half o f the o i l and gas company N I S , and minority stakes in the power 
company EPS, the main telecoms utility, and other large firms. While below levels observed in the recent 
past (FDI averaged 6.7 percent o f GDP over 2002-06), such FD I projections would be sufficient to 
maintain external debt as a share o f GDP at broadly current levels. 

97. The perceived level o f political uncertainties creates scope fo r divergences between these 
projections and actual outcomes. I n the event o f serious regional instability or perceived risks to 
Serbia’s European prospects, capital inflows could become more limited and/or more skewed towards 
debt-creating forms. This could slow growth, 
increase risk perceptions and erode Serbia’s 
creditworthiness. I n contrast, a more favorable evolution in these areas, combined with sustained progress 
in economic reforms, could raise non-debt creating flows above projected levels, leading to reduced risks 
and further improved creditworthiness. Such projections w i l l continue being reviewed. 

98. 
Continued policy reform w i l l be central to the design o f the CPS program. 
The policy 
priorities o f the Government and reform efforts w i l l flow through directly to the DPL program. I n 
addition, individual sectoral investments w i l l be structured to support the Government’s reform program 
and regional integration. Decentralization o f social services and railways reform investments planned in 
2007, for instance, are c r i t ica l , sensitive and complex reforms being undertaken by the Authorities. 
Similarly, engagement in the energy sector i s intended to support, and w i l l be dependent upon, Serbia’s 
continued efforts to position i t s e l f as a supplier o f energy to an integrated South East Europe regional 
market, as established by the Athens Treaty. 

99. A substantive review o f creditworthiness and overall lending volumes w i l l be undertaken 
during the mid-term review in late calendar year 2008. Should creditworthiness improve 
substantially, there i s scope at that stage for the Bank to consider moving to a high case lending program. 
This will, however, require a significant improvement in Serbia’s overall economic position from that 
currently anticipated. Strong implementation o f the Government’s enunciated reform program w i l l also 
be important to ensure that creditworthiness improves. This i s likely to include: (i) public expenditure 
declining as a proportion o f GDP, ( i i ) Serbia’s overall external debt declining as a proportion o f GDP; 
(iii) strengthened f inanc ia l management, particularly the effective functioning o f the newly established 
S ta te Audit Institution and the integration o f the National Investment Plan into the budget process; and 
(iv) continued structural reform, particularly efforts to privatize and restructure large state owned 
enterprises and strengthened resolution to free up the asse ts o f unsold socially owned enterprises through 
bankruptcy and other proceedings. Increases in lending volumes w i l l also need to be dependent on 
increased demand for financing from Serbia. 

100. Any significant deterioration in Serbia’s policy and macroeconomic performance against base 
case creditworthiness considerations would require careful consideration o f lending volumes, and a 
reduction in the financing that could be made available. 

28 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYOI-FYI1 

101. The continued servicing o f obligations associated with IBRD Consolidation Loan C w i l l be 
crucial to allow continued Bank engagement. Loan C i s linked with IBRD loans taken out by the 
former Soc ia l is t Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia (SFRY) for activities in Kosovo. As the borrower o f 
record, Serbia currently has legal responsibility to ensure continued service o f this loan, as well as similar 
Paris and London Club obligations. 

Development Policy Loans, and possible Deferred Drawdown Options 

102. The lending program i s anticipated to be anchored, at least in the in it ia l years o f the CPS 
program, by a s e r i e s o f annual development policy loans (DPLs). While Serbia currently has limited 
financing needs, the Authorities have requested such a program in order to set benchmarks that can 
strengthen the credibility and implementation o f their own reform program. Such operations are most 
likely to be provided as deferred drawdown operations (DDOs), at leas t in the initial stages o f the CPS, 
although the Government has indicated a possible interest in drawing down funds in 2009 and beyond. 
As with a l l DPL instruments, the presentation o f any DPL operation (DDO or otherwise) w i l l be subject 
to a satisfactory macroeconomic assessment by the Bank, and the completion o f appropriate policy 
reforms to justify a DPL prior to presentation o f such an operation to the Board. As DDOs are anticipated 
to be a series o f annual operations, expiring after 12 months i f not utilized, it i s envisaged that only the 
value o f the exposure held by the Bank at any particular time w i l l be counted against the CPS lending 
envelope. While any such DDO DPL i s active, or should financing be drawn down by the Authorities, i t 
would count against the CPS envelope. Should a loan lapse a f ter 12 months without being drawn down, 
however, i t would no longer be counted against the overall envelope. A t this stage, such operations are 
not expected to exceed approximately $50 million per annum. A maximum o f one DPL would be 
disbursed in the first half o f the CPS period, and only one DDO would be outstanding at any one time. 
The use o f DPLs in the second half o f the CPS w i l l be considered in the mid-term review.

103. The measurement o f results i s an essential component to improve accountability and 
effectiveness o f the Bank involvement in Serbia. Box 1 aggregates the major results and outcomes 

expected to be achieved by the Government, with the World Bank support, during the CPS period. A 
more detailed results framework setting out the expected outcomes o f individual interventions under each 
Pillar i s included in Annex 1. The Bank w i l l rigorously monitor the progress made under each pillar 
throughout the CPS period. 

104. The Bank and the Government w i l l engage i n annual consultation process to assess progress 
o f the CPS and make possible adjustments to the Bank program. The authorities have indicated their 

wish to hold annual round table discussions with the World Bank on outstanding sectoral reform issues 
and the overall s ta tus o f the Bank portfolio in Serbia. These discussions provide an opportunity to review 
the status and assess progress o f the CPS, make possible adjustments to both the Government and the 
Bank program and reflect new information and developments that might a f fec t the Bank’s portfolio. 
Consultations w i l l also provide input for updating the CPS results framework to reflect possible 
adjustments to the individual sectoral objectives and milestones. 

105. The Bank w i l l monitor results in the framework o f its own monitoring mechanisms. With 

regard to lending volumes, the Bank w i l l undertake an annual creditworthiness review and adjustments to 
the base case lending scenario w i l l be made on the basis o f the review outcomes, within the lending 
parameters established above. A CPS mid-term review i s foreseen to take place in mid-FY09. This w i l l 
provide an opportunity to assess CPS progress and, as appropriate, move to high case lending, or 
reallocate resources and fine-tune the directions and objectives for the outer years o f the program. I n 
addition, the Bank w i l l carry out results based portfolio reviews on an annual basis to assess the status o f 
the various projects in the portfolio. The results and monitoring frameworks for individual Bank 
interventions w i l l be aligned with the CPS results framework to facilitate portfolio monitoring. 

106. The Bank w i l l primarily depend on Government systems and agencies f o r obtaining statistical 
data f o r the compilation and verification o f CPS results and milestones. Serbia has strong s ta t is t ica l 

capacities and the Statistical Office o f the Republic o f Serbia i s a well organized unit that provides 
reliable and accurate s ta t is t ica l data. The EU and Eurostat are supporting the Statistical Office to adopt 
European standards in data gathering and processing. A British t r u s t h n d administrated by the World 
Bank i s assisting the S ta t is t ica l Office to strengthen i t s capacities in carrying out poverty measurements 
with the aim to produce better quality data on poverty i n Serbia. However, mainly IMF figures w i l l be 
used when assessing the macroeconomic developments in Serbia. 

VI. P O T E N T I A L R I S K S AND M I T I G A T I O N MEASURES 

107. Regional stability. The potential for regional instability and political uncertainty in Serbia arising 
from unresolved Kosovo status issues i s the key risk to the CPS. Efforts to reach a long-term negotiated 
solution to Kosovo’s status are currently being conducted, but the scope for agreement appears extremely 
limited. A t this stage, the Serbian and Kosovo sides have fundamental differences o f views on the basic 
question o f autonomy or independence. Divisions are also apparent within the international community. 
The possibility exists o f a unilateral declaration o f independence by Kosovo. The status o f Kosovo has 
become an increasingly prominent issue in Serbia, to the extent that this may override the Government’s 
other stated reform priorities. Regional uncertainty could potentially deter investment, leading to a 
deterioration in Serbia’s overall economic position. A potential reduction in regional cooperation, 
including in sectors such as energy where Serbia has considerable potential, could have an adverse 
economic e f fec t . A t the extreme, isolated violence associated with continued uncertainty remains a 
possibility. Kosovo i s likely t o be an issue in forthcoming Presidential elections, and have the potential to 
lead to an increasing radicalization o f Serbian society. 

30 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYOS-FY I1 

108. Serbia remains vulnerable to exogenous economic shocks. Economic performance over the past 

few years has been very strong. Nevertheless, rapidly growing credit and associated private external debt 
and a stubborn current account deficit illustrate Serbia’s continuing vulnerability to external shocks. A 
sudden increase in lending spreads or a decrease in liquidity could limit continued growth in Serbia and 
projected improvements in overall creditworthiness. 

109. Continued policy reform w i l l be required t o strengthen macro-economic stability and further 
improve Serbia’s creditworthiness. 

I n particular, the government w i l l need to recalibrate 
macroeconomic policy in order to reduce the imbalances that have emerged over the last tw o years, 
primarily due to f isca l stimulus. Greater f i s c a l restraint, consistent with the Government’s stated 
intentions, w i l l be important to reduce risks, as w i l l continued structural reform. I n addition further 
efforts to ensure rapid domestic credit growth and increases in private external borrowing are put on a 
more sustainable footing, and that credit increasingly finances productive investment rather than 
consumption. If these issues are not tackled, r e a l vulnerabilities remain from the widening current 
account deficit and rapidly growing private external debt. 

110. Managing risks w i l l require that the Bank Group wo rk cooperatively w ith the Serbian 
Authorities in a highly flexible manner in order to encourage Serbia’s continued international 
engagement and integration at a particularly sensitive time. At the same time, Bank Group support i s 

necessarily dependent on Serbia meeting international responsibilities, particularly in relation to debt 
servicing, or an agreement being reached that allows an orderly resolution o f this issue. Given the very 
high level o f uncertainty in the region, this CPS i s perhaps best seen as setting out broad “rules o f 
engagement” rather than as a detailed blueprint for Bank Group support. 

V I I . CONCLUS ION 

1 1 1. Serbia i s well poised to continue its strong economic performance and make progress toward 

the goal o f full European integration. While the transition program began relatively recently, 
significant economic reform has underpinned strong economic growth and real reductions in poverty in 
Serbia over the past few years. The Government has demonstrated a degree o f commitment to undertake 
difficult but necessary “second generation” reforms that should help to ensure a sustainable growth path 
for the economy led by a dynamic private sector. Efforts are also evident to ensure that the benefits o f 
growth are distributed widely, and that opportunities for disadvantaged households to participate in the 
economy are increased. Nevertheless, Serbia and the region have not yet fully moved beyond the difficult 
legacies resulting from the turmoil o f the 1990s. A key challenge w i l l be to ensure that this reform 
momentum i s able to be continued, and that international confidence and regional stability i s maintained, 
at a particularly sensitive time for Serbia. The World Bank Group has the potential to continue to be a 
strong partner fo r Serbia as i t faces these challenges. This will, however, require the Bank Group to be 
even more responsive to the demands o f a sophisticated middle income client. Further strengthened 
cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral partners, particularly but not only the EC, w i l l also be 
critical to strengthen the overall effectiveness o f the support that can be provided. Most critically, the 
World Bank Group w i l l need to be able to respond flexibly in order to calibrate engagement with Serbia 
in an environment o f high uncertainty.

I. 

Introduction 

1. This CAS Completion Report evaluates the impact and effectiveness o f the World Bank Group’s 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) prepared for Serbia and Montenegro approved in November 2004 
(hereafter referred to as CAS FY05). Serbia was the successor state to the Union o f Serbia and 
Montenegro and retained membership o f the World Bank following the dissolution o f the S ta te Union in 
2006. A separate CAS Completion Report was prepared for Montenegro as part o f a new Country 
Partnership Strategy for Montenegro discussed by the Bank’s Executive Board in June 2007. 

2. This CAS Completion Report has been retrofitted to evaluate the results from the previous Serbia and 
Montenegro CAS that correspond to Serbia alone. This i s feasible since a l l new lending and advisory 
services in CAS FY05 were designed separately for each o f Serbia and Montenegro. In volume terms, 
just under 90 percent o f lending during the CAS was for operations in Serbia. 

3 . While the CAS FY05 was not prepared using a formal results-based methodology, this report 
attempts to retrofit a results-based framework in order to provide a basis for a new Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS) covering FY08 to FY 1 1. The retrofitted CAS FY05 Results Matrix has been prepared as 
i f i t had been done when the CAS was originally prepared in FY05.

Country Context 

A . Po l i t ica l Developments 

4. 
The past three years have seen a degree o f relative political stability in Serbia, at least compared 
to the tumult throughout Balkans during the 1990s and early 2000s, and in Serbia following the 2003 
assassination o f President Djindjic. Reflecting a growing political maturity in the Balkans, the dissolution 
o f the State Union o f Serbia and Montenegro in June 2006 followed a democratic process, was generally 
smooth, and entirely peaceful - unlike the break-up o f the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Serbia 
adopted a new Constitution in November 2006, following a national referendum. 

5 . 
Elections in January 2007 resulted in the formation o f a coalition government by the ‘democratic 
bloc’ o f parties, comprising President Tadic’s Democratic Party (DS), Prime Minister Kostunica’s 
Democratic Party o f Serbia (DSS) and the G17+, led by current Minister o f Economy Dinkic. Some 
combination o f parties from this bloc have made the Government in Serbia since la te 2000, when the 
nationalist President Milosevic was forced to step aside following allegations o f electoral fraud. 
Nevertheless, political differences remain evident. The formation o f a Government in early 2007, for 
instance, took several months o f difficult negotiations between the parties. Similarly, although President 
Tadic and Prime Minister Kostunica have each been in their current o f f ices since elections in early 2004, 
the changing formation o f the governing coalition over the past few years (this i s now the fourth 
Government since 2000), highlights the differences between the parties o f the ‘democratic bloc’. 

37 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Annex 2 
Divisions in society a re also reflected in overtly nationalist parties continuing to win a significant 
minority o f seats in Parliament, with the Serbian Radical Party the largest single party in Parliament. 
New Presidential and municipal elections are due, most likely in early 2008.

Advancing European integration i s a stated priority o f the Government, and i s an objective 
supported by almost two thirds o f society. Serbia recently resumed negotiations with the European Union 
on a S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Agreement (SAA). Technical discussions regarding the SAA were 
concluded in September 2007, and initialing o f the SAA occurred in November 2007. European Foreign 
Ministers initially se t out principles for a European future for the Western Balkan countries at a Summit 
in Thessaloniki in 2003. Ministers reiterated this vision in Salzburg in June 2006, although noting that 
the European perspective for the Western Balkans needs to be considered in light o f the European 
Union’s absorptive capacity. 

7. 
Nevertheless, the political situation and the EU accession process in Serbia remains influenced by 
recent history. While technical talks on an SAA have been concluded, initialing o f a document w i l l 
require Serbia to demonstrate cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal fo r the former 
Yugoslavia (ICTY). Recent moves by Serbia on this front did allow the resumption and conclusion o f 
technical discussions, but further efforts are likely to be required. Serbia remains, with Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, one o f only two countries in the region not to have yet signed a SAA. S t i l l , Serbia’s strong 
administrative capacity may allow quick progress along the European path once political issues are 
resolved. 

8. 
The status o f Kosovo has become an increasingly prominent issue in political discourse in Serbia. 
Under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo i s province o f Serbia under the 
autonomous administration o f the United Nations. Efforts to reach a long term negotiated solution to 
KOSOVO’S 
status are currently being conducted under the auspices o f the Working Group, comprising the 
US, Russia, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. This followed an impasse in discussions in the United 
Nations. The “troika” o f negotiators from Germany (for the EU), the US and Russia are to report back to 
the UN Secretary General on progress by December 10, 2007. A t this stage, however, the Kosovo and 
Serbian sides appear to have fundamental differences o f views on how the situation should be resolved. 
Achieving a negotiated solution i s likely to be extremely difficult. 

B. Econom ic Developments 

9 . 
After two decades o f decline, reforms in Serbia s ince 2000 have resulted in renewed growth. 
Since the las t CAS was approved in la te 2004, growth has averaged about 7 percent per annum. Growth 
has been driven by large capital inflows, and significant reform to improve the business environment. 
Nevertheless, external imbalances are widening and remain a potential risk for sustained growth. 

10. 
Renewed growth has been underpinned by significant reform. Stabilization measures introduced 
after 2000, have brought the hyper-inflation o f the 1990s under control. A value added tax (VAT) 
introduced in 2005 has simplified tax procedures and strengthened the revenue base. Extensive 
restructuring o f the banking system has helped to improve the allocation o f capital, and access to credit. 
The privatization o f about 1,800 s ta te and socially owned enterprises has given new l i f e to sometimes 
moribund companies, with a l l small and medium sized socially owned enterprises expected to have been 
offered for sa le by 2008. Reflecting progress, Serbia was rated by the Bank’s D o i n g Business 2006 report 
as the top reformer in 2004-2005. Gains are particularly evident in major reductions in the time and cost 
required to start a business, which resulted i n 40 percent more businesses being registered in 2005 
compared to 2003, as well as a new c iv i l procedure code that halved the time required to resolve business

disputes. 
Governance indicators for Serbia also continue to improve, although from a low base, 
particularly perceptions o f strengthened rule o f law and control o f corruption5. 

11. 

Growth has flowed through to improvements in living standards for most Serbians. 
terms, GDP per capita has r isen from about $2,700 in 2003 to just under $4,300 in 2006 and a projected 
$5,400 in 2007. Latest World Bank poverty measures suggest that the proportion o f the population living 
below an absolute poverty line o f approximately $2.15 per day has fallen significantly during the CAS 
FY05 period, from 14.6 percent in 2004 to 8 . 8 percent in 2006. Nevertheless, poverty remains a 
persistent problem in rural areas, which are home to about two thirds o f a l l poor people in Serbia. This i s 
particularly evident in depressed regions that used to be home to major industries (often extractive and 
industrial) during the Yugoslav period. Poverty also remains very high among minority groups, with over 
half o f the Roma population estimated to live in poverty. Real gains in poverty reduction, however, are 
accompanied by continued pessimism among much o f the population, in part because average incomes 
are just returning to the high point reached during the late 19808 ’ . 

I n USD 

12. 

Despite Serbia’s strong growth performance, significant challenges remain. External weaknesses 
are apparent in double-digit and expanding current account deficits. External debt remains about 60 
percent o f GDP, despite a series o f London and Paris Club debt write downs. Although public debt has 
declined significantly, private external liabilities continue to grow quickly. Large current account deficits 
have unsettled the focus o f monetary and exchange rate policies, which have alternated between 
disinflation and exchange rate objectives. As with much o f the Western Balkans, unemployment remains 
high at approximately 20 percent o f the labor force. 

13 . 

To address these issues, further corporate reforms remain the key challenge outstanding from the 
pre-2000 period. While a l l small and medium sized socially owned enterprises are expected to be offered 
for sale by 2008, buyers have not been found for many o f these. Despite the adoption o f considerably 
strengthened bankruptcy legislation in 2004, there has been a reluctance to use such procedures for 
companies which have not been able to be successfully sold, even with the longer-term benefits such 
actions could generate by freeing up underutilized but productive assets. Many o f the largest and most 
difficult state-owned companies also s t i l l remain in public ownership. Despite restructuring, large state- 
owned enterprises such as the O i l Industry o f Serbia (N IS) , Electroprivreda Srbije (EPS) and the railways 
remain in public ownership. According to Serbian Government figures, remaining state, socially-owned, 
and mixed enterprises generate corporate losses equivalent to 1.9 percent o f GDP in 2006, although this i s 
a significant reduction on 2003 (estimates o f subsidies in 2003 ranged from 3 percent by the Government 
to as much as 5 percent o f GDP by the IMF based on data from the National Bank o f Serbia’s Solvency 
center). In addition, while significant improvements have been made in the overall business environment, 
further gains are possible: Serbia still ranks only 86 out o f 178 countries in overall Doing Business 
indicators, in large part because o f complicated business licensing permit procedures that generate 
opportunities for rent-seeking behavior. 

14. 

The Authorities have been very confident o f Serbia’s prospects. While mindful o f imbalances 
and the remaining reform agenda, the Authorities have seen these issues as reflecting normal transition 
strains. Focused on infrastructure bottlenecks, reflecting inadequate investment over the past 20 years, 
and high labor taxation, the Authorities have used the scope provided by strong V A T receipts and one-off 
privatization revenues to give precedence in their policy agenda to relaxing the f isca l position and 
reducing labor taxation. These policies are likely to have long-term benefits, provided investments are 
carefully prioritized. Nevertheless, care i s required to ensure that hard won macro-economic stability i s 
not put at risk. The public sector in Serbia s t i l l makes up a very significant proportion o f the total

economy. While public expenditure declined from 43.7 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 40.7 percent in 2005 
(with a f i s c a l deficit o f 3.0 percent o f GDP in 2003 being transformed into a small surplus in 2005), 
spending in 2006 and 2007 i s again starting to increase. In 2006, public expenditure reached 42.3 percent 
o f GDP, and i s expected to remain at comparable levels in 2007 - although this i s s t i l l 1 percent o f GDP 
below 2003. After a small surplus in 2005, a limited deficit o f 1.5% o f GDP remerged in 2006, and a 
similar figure i s expected for 2007. S t i l l , deficits are considerable smaller than in the period immediately 
prior to the CPS. There has, however, been a reorientation in spending. Government investment 
spending has increased as a proportion o f GDP over the CAS period, from 2.4 percent in 2003 to a 
projected 4.3 percent in 2007.

15 . 
Serbia’s development priorities are defined by two pillars - the European Integration process and 
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. These are complementary and compatible. 

16. 
I n June 2005 the Government o f Serbia’s Council for European Integration adopted the National 
Strategy o f Serbia for Serbia and Montenegro’s Accession to the European Union. This Strategy was 
subsequently adopted by the Government. Serbia also subsequently completed technical discussions on a 
European SAA in September 2007. 

17. 
Serbia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was completed in l a t e 2003. A new Strategy i s 
currently under preparation. Responsibility for “whole o f government” coordination o f the 
implementation o f the PRS rests with the Deputy Prime Minister, who also has responsibility for 
coordinating European integration efforts. This has ensured a strong degree o f consistency between the 
key strategies. Probably more than anywhere e lse in the Western Balkans, the PRS has been embedded in 
Serbian Government decision-making processes, and has reflected broad government priorities. The PRS 
se ts out three over-arching goals for Serbia: 
( 0 
establishing the conditions for dynamic and equitable economic growth, through the creation 
o f a stable macro-economic environment and favorable investment climate, that w i l l create 
employment and reduce economic vulnerability, as well as the establishment o f key programs 
to directly promote employment among the poor; 
preventing new poverty resulting from the modernization and restructuring o f the economy 
through targeted training and social measures enhancing this group’s ability to take advantage 
o f new opportunities created in the reformed market economy. 
improve access to social services bv the poor, such as health, education, water and other key 
infrastructure needs, through improved targeting o f existing programs, and actions that 
improve the efficiency and quality o f services delivered, particularly to the most vulnerable 
groups in society. The goal o f these activities i s to initiate a long- term process o f 
empowering vulnerable groups to move out o f poverty, through the development o f new 
market-oriented skills, and the provision o f minimum standards o f living. 

(iii) 

( i i ) 

18 . 
Key success measures se t out in the PRS are on track to be met. A t the time o f preparing the 
PRS, the Government noted that the successful implementation o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy should 
result in a reduction in poverty to around 6 .5 percent o f the population by 2010 with average annual 
growth o f around 4 to 4.5 percent, without an increase in overall inequality in society.

Annex 2 

(i) 

( i i ) 

19. 
The CAS FY05 was built around the Government’s complementary European integration 
priorities and the PRS. Reflecting the aims o f the PRS, the CAS was structured to support Serbian 
Government efforts to: 
Create a smaller, more sustainable, more e f f i c i e n t public sector, through: f i s c a l consolidation, 
leaner and more e f f i c i e n t public administration, better delivery o f state services and improved 
financial sustainability o f pensions, healthcare and education. 
Create a larger, more dynamic private sector, through: continued progress on restructuring 
and privatization o f real and financial sector assets, restructuring and resolution o f large loss- 
making state-owned enterprises, improved access to finance, particularly for the SME sector, 
energy sector restructuring and, where appropriate, private participation in infrastructure. 
Reduce uovertV levels. and improving; social protection and access to public services, through 
improvements in support for rural communities, the coverage, targeting, and reliability o f 
transfers for social protection and the quality, access, and f inanc ia l sustainability o f health 
and education for a l l c i t izens . 

(iii) 

A . IDANBRD Engagement 

20. 
CAS FY05 objectives were supported by ID A credits and IBRD loans that utilized the Bank’s 
comparative advantage and experience, backed up by analytical and advisory support. During the period 
from FY05 to FY07, much o f the Serbia portfolio was made up o f continuing activities approved prior to 
the CAS. These pre-CAS FY05 projects include both the trade and transport facilitation program 
(TTFSE) and export finance facilitation (SMECA) IDA credits that supported investments in both Serbia 
and Montenegro, as well as seven discrete IDA credits for Serbia, including: support for reform in the 
education and health sectors, efforts to encourage corporate restructuring, reform o f employment services, 
and property registration, as well as infrastructure investments in transport and energy efficiency. D e t a i l s 
o f lending activities current at the time CAS FY05 was presented to the Board are set out in Table 1.

New financing anticipated during the course o f the CAS FY05 included a m ix o f policy based 
lending and investment operations. Given the outstanding policy reform agenda, as well as Serbia’s 

41 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

Annex 2 

external financing needs at the time of CAS preparation, the CAS envisaged a very substantial program o f 
development policy lending. A ser ies o f programmatic development policy loans (DPLs) were intended 
to anchor the CAS program and World Bank policy dialogue, and were initially envisaged to make up 
over half o f a l l base-case lending. With a high-case linked to Serbia meeting policy triggers, the CAS 
FY05 high case scenario envisaged policy based lending making up as much as 7 0 percent o f the total 
financing package. Supporting policy based finance, the CAS FY05 anticipated investment financing in 
strategic sectors, including: (i) support for Serbia to enter the South East Europe regional energy market; 
( i i ) irrigation and drainage rehabilitation to strengthen food security and flood protection given recurrent 
floods and drought; (iii) investments to promote agricultural production and reform, especially in light o f 
the requirements and opportunities posed by Serbia moving toward the European Union; (iv) pension and 
health sector reform to strengthen the quality o f service and the f inanc ia l sustainability o f these sectors; 
and (v) regional development activities in the depressed former mining region o f Bor. Planned and actual 
lending during the course o f the CAS i s set out in Table 2 .

The CAS lending program was delivered largely as planned during approximately the first 1 8 
months o f implementation, although with some delays associated with preparation fo r the complex Bor 
regional development project. Nevertheless, the increasingly strong financial position o f the Authorities 
as a result o f VAT introduction, strong growth, and privatization receipts resulted in development policy 
lending becoming less relevant during the course o f the CAS. This was compounded by the difficulty o f 
proceeding with development policy loans during FY07, given internal differences between the coalition 
partners, and electoral uncertainty resulting from the Constitutional Referendum in November 2006 and 
subsequent Parliamentary elections in January 2007 . Given this uncertainty, a conscious decision was 
made to reorient lending toward investment activities and to use the flexibility available under the new 
additional financing instrument to scale up well performing energy efficiency, irrigation and drainage, 
and transport rehabilitation activities. The use o f additional financing and adjustment instruments has 
also resulted in a relatively streamlined portfolio o f continuing operations in Serbia: as o f September 
2007 , fo r instance, there are 10 active investment operations, with a total commitment value o f $398 
million (including IDA, IBRD and GEF). This i s both the smallest number o f activities, as well as the 
highest commitment value, for any portfolio in the Western Balkans. 

42 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FYll 

Annex 2 
24. 
The additional financing instrument proved particular useful given the relatively strong 
performance o f the investment portfolio. A Joint Portfolio Performance Review (JPPR) undertaken in 
March 2006, for instance, confirmed satisfactory progress on 10 out o f 12 operations current at that time. 
Operations in the soc ia l sectors, however, have proved to be subject to performance difficulties. 
Performance o f the education, health and pension reform projects, for instance, have a l l been 
unsatisfactory at some period. Nevertheless, significant e f fo r ts have seen a turn around in education and 
health investments identified in the JPPR as experiencing difficulties. The consolidated co l lec t ion and 
pension administration reform project i s now the only activity in the portfolio where performance remains 
unsatisfactory. The portfolio review also highlighted the importance o f strictly assessing project 
readiness, with several investments subject to initial delays in effectiveness and disbursements - although 
performance on almost a l l has subsequently improved significantly. To date, IEG has endorsed 
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory ratings for a l l projects that have closed in Serbia. 

25 . 
The CAS FY05 was noticeable for Serbia’s graduation from IDA to IBRD financing. Serbia had 
previously received exceptional access to IDA on modified terms due to creditworthiness concerns 
resulting from the large external public debt overhang from the former Yugoslavia, compounded by 
significant declines in capacity to service such debt as a result o f the tumult o f the 1990s. Nevertheless, 
relatively strong economic performance since 2000 allowed a transition to IBRD financing during the 
course o f the CAS period. Initially, i t was envisaged that IBRD financing would be made available in 
FY06, although this was ultimately delayed by a year due to delays in project preparation. Serbia did, 
however, gain access to IBRD in FY07. From FY08, a l l new financing w i l l be on IBRD terms. Serbia’s 
successful graduation to IBRD, together with renewed access to financing from international markets, has 
been a particular success during the CAS period. 

26. 
Improvements in Serbia’s credit-worthiness were highlighted during the CAS FY05 period by a 
decision by the Serbian Government to pre-pay outstanding debt to the IMF and the World Bank. During 
2006, Serbia pre-paid approximately $1.2 billion in obligations to the IMF, and now has no outstanding 
liabilities to the Fund. In la te 2006, the Serbian Government also paid Euro 320 million (over $410 
million based on exchange rates at the time) into a trust fund to support payments falling due over the 
next few years on IBRD loans inherited from the former Yugoslavia. As a result, Serbia’s outstanding 
obligations to the Bank are now smaller than at the beginning o f the CAS FY05 period. These pre- 
payments were allowed by significant privatization revenues.

Annex 2 

as planned (Table 3). Analytical work allowed the Bank to prepare a ser ies o f very well received policy 
notes for the incoming Government, discussed in July 2007. These notes, highly commended by the 
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and his colleagues, have formed the basis fo r discussions about the shape 
o f the Bank’s new partnership strategy. Notes covered: ( i ) overall public investment planning and 
priorities, ( i i ) private and financial sector development issues, (iii) decentralization, (iv) governance and 
anti-corruption programs, (v) infrastructure issues, (vi) agriculture, and (vii) health and education. 

B. IFC Engagement 

28. 

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has a significant investment portfolio in Serbia, 
which has contributed to strong private sector led economic growth. As o f June 30 2007, IFC had 16 
projects in its Serbia portfolio, with total commitment o f $321 million. The vast bulk o f this investment 
has occurred during the period o f the past CAS. During FY05-07, IFC committed $264 million in Serbia, 
compared to $41 million during FY02-04 . 
In addition to Serbia specific investments, IFC has also 
invested in three private equity funds, which operate in Southeast Europe, including Serbia. Details o f 
IFC’s investment portfolio in Serbia are provided in Figure 1.

IFC investments have particularly focused on the f inanc ia l sector. 
IFC has supported 
development o f microfinance institutions, the introduction and expansion o f new financial products 
including mortgage financing, consumer finance, energy efficiency financing and SME finance. 
IFC 
contributed to the cleaning-up, rehabilitation and privatization o f the banking sector through restructuring 
i t s claims to a few Serbian banks. IFC’s largest single investment has been made with Banca Intesa,

activities particularly to SMEs, retail c l ien ts and residential mortgages. Other investments have included 
Raiffeisen Bank, Continental Bank, H V B Serbia, and Pro-Credit Bank. Investments have particularly 
encouraged the expansion o f long-term lending, particularly to SMEs, mortgage operations, and lending 
relating to commercial and residential real estate development, and the development o f energy efficiency 
products. IFC has also invested $ 3 7 million in the European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE), $7.4 
million o f which i s for Serbia. This collective debt investment w i l l channel long term resources for on-

In the rea l sector, IFC supported the growth and strategic development o f Tigar, a leading 
regional producer o f high quality car tires. Also, IFC supported Mercator, a Slovenian company, to 
establish a new hypermarket stores in Serbia. This investment i s expected to stimulate competition in the 
sector and improve the variety, price, quality and delivery o f consumer goods. In addition, through its 
investments in regional Private Equity Funds, IFC has supported 3 other companies in the manufacturing 
sector. IFC has been looking for opportunities to support companies in the pharmaceutical and paper 
sectors. Nevertheless, investments being considered in both sectors did no t proceed given issues 
regarding minority shareholder rights and reputational considerations. As a result, IFC’s strategy i s to 
focus selectively on direct investments in mid-sized companies as well as to support reputable investors. 

3 1. 

Serbia i s among IFC’s client countries which most benefit from IFC’s advisory services program. 
To support SMEs, IFC started the Private Enterprise Partnership Southeast Europe (PEP-SE) facility in 
June 2005. This i s focused on: SME support and linkages; business enabling environment; access to 
finance; and infrastructure advisory operations. Through PEP-SE, IFC has also been active in supporting 
judicial reform, particularly alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Three mediation centers in Serbia, 
supported by PEP-SE, have helped to resolve over 1,600 cases. Under the recycling linkage program, IFC 
i s commercializing the small street collectors, who in Serbia are significantly comprised o f the Roma 
population. IFC Advisory Services assistance projects are set out in Table 5 . 

32. 
IFC i s committed to providing advisory services aimed at the participation o f the private sector in 
the infrastructure projects through concessions. PEP-SE Infrastructure (PEP-SE I) was appointed lead 
advisor in the restructuring o f Serbia’s national carrier, JAT Airways. PEP-SE I provided the government 
with a review o f the airline and the sector, identifying critical issues and suggesting recommendations 
aimed at transforming JAT into a viable enterprise through private sector participation. Based on IFC 
study the Government has launched the privatizations o f JAT Airways and JAT Tehnika (the maintenance 
company). The Government has now sought offers for advisory services from commercial institutions, 
and both privatizations are currently being implemented. 

33 . 

I n addition, IFC has been helping the City o f Belgrade with the privatization (concession) o f the 
Belgrade solid waste disposal services, scheduled to be completed this f isca l year after some delays. IFC 
also has a mandate to advise the City o f Belgrade on the implementation o f PPP for the water and 
wastewater sector, although this faces 
legislative impediments associated with the cumbersome 
Concession Law, which requires extensive and detailed involvement o f the Central Government, 
including in municipal projects. The Ministry o f Economy and Regional Development expressed its 
willingness to amend the law. PEP-SEI has offered to help to help the Government to amend the law, to 
establish a PPP unit within the Government, and to implement one or more pilot transaction - although 
this would require the Government to contribute one fifth o f the total cost. 

34. While Serbia has developed its institutions framework to implement the privatization reform in 
the real sector, still i t i s lacking capacity to structure and attract PSP in the infrastructure sectors. The 
institutional bottleneck in this area has been the main reason o f serious issues experienced with the 
concession o f Horgos-Pozega highway. 

3 5 . 

Through the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), analytical and advisory support has 
also been provided to assist the Serbian authorities in their successful efforts to improve the investment 
climate. With support from the European Agency for Reconstruction, F IAS has been engaged in assisting 
the Serbian Investment and Export Promotion Agency, as well as in following up on Doing Business 
reports to analyze investment constraints in Serbia, especially at the sub-national level.

C. MICA Engagement 

36 . The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has been active in providing guarantees, 
mostly in financial sector, and also in providing techn ica l assistance aimed at capacity building. During 
the period o f the CAS FY05, MIGA issued six contacts o f guarantee for investments in Serbia, with a 
total value o f $229 million. Guarantees supported foreign investments to develop and expand the Serbian 
banking and leasing system. MIGA’s focus on finance projects in a country like Serbia with a young 
financial sector are intended to deepen and broaden a market currently dominated by banking. 
Guarantees are especially focused on helping financial institutions to expand the range o f loan options 
available to clients, including SMEs, and particularly to widen options for longer-maturity loans. Four o f 
the guarantees during the CAS FY05 period, totaling $2 13 million, were provided to Raiffeisenbank. The 
fifth, worth approximately $12 million, was provided to Bank Austria Creditanstalt, and the sixth o f 
nearly $4 milion in the manufacturing sector was issued to Alpos, a Slovenian investor. Pr ior to the CAS

V. R e t ro f i t t ing the Resu lts F r a m e w o r k 

A . Goa l 1: Crea te a sma l ler more sustainable, more e f ic ien t pub l i c sector 
Performance: Modera te ly Satisfactory 

37. 
Serbia made progress in the period between 2003 and 2005 in f isca l consolidation, increasing the 
efficiency o f the public sector, providing quality services more efficiently and improving the longer-term 
sustainability o f the pension system. Nevertheless, gains in the overall f i s c a l situation 2004 and 2005 
started to be reversed in la te 2006 and 2007. 

3 8 . 
A significant f i s c a l consolidation in 2004 and 2005, under the auspices o f an IMF program, 
resulted in the overall public expenditure falling from 43.7 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 40.7 percent in 
2005. Persistent f isca l deficits were turned into a modest surplus, due to a combination o f f i s c a l restraint 
in this period and the introduction o f a VAT in 2005, which simplified tax collection and ensured a sound 
revenue foundation. Nevertheless, expenditure pressures remerged in la te 2006 and 2007, with 
expenditures again rising to 42.3 percent o f GDP in 2006, with a similar proportion o f GDP expected in 
2007. The budget has again slipped slightly into deficit, o f about 1.5 percent o f GDP - s t i l l l e s s than half 
the size in 2003. Expenditure pressures have been driven in part by rapid wage growth, with the total 
public sector wage b i l l increasing over the CAS period from 9.5 percent o f GDP in 2003 to an estimate o f 
10 percent o f GDP in 2007. Nevertheless, the budget i s increasingly focused on longer-term investments 
rather than transfers or consumption: public investment, for instance, has increased from 2.4 percent o f 
GDP in 2003 to a projected 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2007. The Authorities are also increasingly moving to 
ensure that investment promises made during the election campaign are integrated into a cohesive overall 
national priority setting mechanism. Partly as a result o f this expansion, inflation i s again starting to 
increase, with the burden for ensuring price stability falling on to monetary policy. 

39 . 
The World Bank’s overall policy dialogue with the Authorities on broad f i s c a l and public 
administration issues was underpinned in the initial stages o f the CAS period by the Structural 
Adjustment Credit 2, approved in December 2004, as well as by a se r ies o f analytical products, including 
the PEIR update PEIR Update (March 2006), and an integrated public financial management analysis 
(November 2006). This dialogue helped to encourage the authorities to undertake a significant public 
administration reform program designed to lay the foundation for a professional, merit-based c iv i l service 
based on European standards, while rationalizing administrative bodies and decompressing salaries to 
better attract high quality professionals. Some gains were made in a l l o f these areas. 

40. 
Through the CAS period, public sector development policy loans (envisaged in the high case in 
FY06 and the base case in FY07) were initially intended to support the authorities to take this agenda 
forward. Reduced need for fas t disbursing financing, governmental reconfigurations and electoral 
uncertainty, the increase in the wage b i l l in la te 2006 (and associated f i s c a l loosening), and the limited 
movement until very recently in establishing a State Audit Institution and strengthening overall f isca l 
oversight, however, meant that these operations did not proceed as planned. Despite these difficulties, 
however, a reasonable degree o f reform continued on the public administration front, including 
substantive pension and health insurance reform that w i l l make these systems more fiscally sustainable 
over the longer term, and continued efforts to promote further c iv i l service reform. Serbia has also not 
had an IMF program s ince the conclusion o f the last arrangement in early 2006. 

4 1. 
Investment operations helped to make a contribution to strengthened f i s c a l sustainability during 
the period o f the CAS FY05. Health service reform, for instance, has helped to improve quality o f se rv ice 

48 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FY I1 

Annex 2 

delivery while containing costs. Similarly, pension reform, including efforts to undertake parameter 
changes and strengthen collections, has significantly improved the medium-term f i s c a l sustainability o f 
the pension system, although the short-term impact has been more modest. 

42. 

The Serb ia hea l th p ro jec t (FY03) has ass is ted the Authorities to restructure health services to 
improve quality (discussed in greater detail under goal 3 ) and to reform health finance and management. 
Expenditures on health in Serbia are relatively high as a proportion o f GDP, with about 10 percent o f 
GDP spent on health, about half o f which i s public financing. On the other hand, expenditures remain 
relatively low in absolute terms when compared with OECD countries. The Bank’s health investment i s 
consequently focused on reducing inefficiencies in the health system to control expenditure growth, while 
also improving care. The central thrust o f the project has been to inc rease the use o f primary health care 
providers, with less o f the burden falling on relatively high cost treatment at tertiary health care 
institutions, such as hospitals and the Belgrade Clinical Centre. A t the same, i t i s also promoting 
improved hospital management, with greater use o f outpatient services and better utilization o f f a c i l i t i e s . 
Performance o f the Health Insurance Fund has also improved, with arrears being cleared in 2006. 
Financial audits o f 1 5 major health fac i l i t ies are underway to help ensure arrears do not reemerge. 
Overall, this project has been successful in assisting the authorities to contain Health Insurance Fund 
expenditures at about 5 .5 percent o f GDP while at the same time increasing c l i e n t satisfaction with their 
health providers. 

43. 

The pension adm in is tra t ion reform p ro jec t (FY05) aims to improve collections and enforcement 
o f pension contributions, including by consolidating pension collection. On the legislative side, a new 
pension law was passed in October 2005 and became effective in January 2006. This w i l l gradually 
eliminate the f i s c a l deficit in the pension system. Parametric changes introduced under this legislation 
eliminate the option o f retiring a t 63/60, reduces indexation to semiannual increases rather than quarterly, 
and reduces indexation o f both the pension post-retirement and the pension point to inflation. These 
changes are significant and w i l l have important impact in the medium and long term. Nevertheless, 
changes have yet to show up in current pension spending. For 2006, the law envisaged a one time 
increase in minimum pension, which raises costs, and which w i l l only gradually be reduced by the other 
measures in the law. Between 2003 and 2005, pension spending fluctuated between 13 percent and 14.5 
percent o f GDP, with no c lea r trend. In addition, implementation o f administrative changes to consolidate 
pension collections have been significantly delayed. Despite these difficulties, however, the medium term 
outlook i s much improved by the passage o f the pension law. 

B . Goa l 2: Crea te a la rge r , more dynamic p r i va te sector 
Performance: Satisfactory 

44. 
Serb ia was one o f the last countries in the region to embark on the transition process, which did 
not begin until 2001. As a country that i s s t i l l in the relatively early stages o f transition, the outstanding 
reform agenda remains significant. Nevertheless, progress over the period o f the CAS FY05 has been 
very strong. 

45. 

Most notably, the business environment in Serbia i s very substantially improved since the CAS 
was presented to the Board in November 2004. Do ing Business 2006 indicates that Serbia was the faster 
reformer globally in 2005. Major reductions in the time (from 5 1 to 15 days) and cost required to start a 
business resulted in 40 percent more businesses being registered in 2005 compared to 2003. A new c iv i l 
procedure code halved the time required to resolve business disputes through court processes (from about 
4 years to l e s s than 2), with IFC support for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms further 
streamlining process for over 1,500 disputes. Improvements in the Labor Law increased labor market 
flexibility. More recently, during the course o f 2007, there have been significant improvements in the 
availability o f credit information, particularly the quality o f information available through private credit 

49 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for F Y O b F Y I I 

Annex 2 
bureaus. S t i l l , business licensing and permits remains a key challenge, as with other countries in the 
Western Balkans. The current Government has indicated a strong willingness to engage on this issue. 

46. 
Enterprise sector reform has been significant. Although again a large reform agenda remains, 
this should be seen in light o f the gains over a relatively short period. The overall scope, pace and 
transaction quality o f the privatization process compares very favorably to similar stages o f reform in 
other transition economies. Over the CAS period, the Privatization Agency, assisted by the World Bank 
and other donors, achieved significant progress in implementing the Government’s privatization program. 
Since mid-2004, more than 1,800 socially-owned SMEs have been sold in open auctions and tenders, 
with a l l remaining socially-owned enterprises expected to have been offered for sa le by end 2008. A new 
Bankruptcy Law passed in 2004 provides a strong instrument for dealing with SOEs for which buyers 
cannot be found. Full utilization o f this instrument, however, w i l l require strengthening o f the capacity o f 
commercial courts to deal with complex bankruptcy cases, and a commitment by the state creditors to 
initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 

47 . 

Over 60 large SOEs have been sold without restructuring, many o f them to international strategic 
investors. The largest was the sa le completed in July, 2006, o f the mobile telecoms network to Telenor o f 
Norway for over Euro 1.5 billion. Another 50 large SOEs were restructured and offered for sale, o f 
which 25 were sold. This includes RTB Bor, the large copper mining and processing complex in eastern 
Serbia, which the Government i s again offering for sale a f ter the first attempt f e l l through in early 2007 
due to the buyer’s failure to come up with adequate financing for the deal. RTB Bor i s one o f the main 
loss making industrial conglomerates and the second largest recipient o f state subsidies, averaging over 
$10 million per annum with approximately the same amount in arrears to state owned energy utilities. 
S t i l l , restructuring and subsequent divestiture o f a number o f large, loss-making industrial conglomerates 
continues to present a major challenge, even following the passage in Spring 2005 o f the debt 
restructuring amendments to the Privatization Law. Privatization o f major companies, such as the O i l 
Refinery o f Serbia (Nis) remains subject to political differences within the governing coalition, while the 
core assets o f the largest recipient o f subsidies, Zastava Group, s t i l l have not found a buyer. Over the 
period o f the CAS, however, the Government has reduced i t s subsidies to loss making SOEs from 
approximately 3 percent to just under 2 percent o f GDP. 

48 . 
Energy Sector Restructuring: Although private sector involvement in the energy utility sectors 
(power and gas) s t i l l i s very small, steps have been taken to f a c i l i t a t e such involvement and competition 
in the future. Consistent with Serbia’s commitments as part o f the Energy Community o f South East 
Europe, establishing a regional energy market, a regulatory agency has been established which works on 
developing adequate ta r i f f structures for incumbents and new entrants. Power transmission services have 
been separated out from EPS into a new transmission company EMS. EPS has been separated into 
individual legal entities for generation and distribution. Commercial losses are moderate for both gas and 
power, and collections are high for virtually a l l consumer groups. The private sector i s present in the o i l 
sector in r e t a i l marketing (notably gasoline stations). The Government also appears committed to 
accepting private investment in generation activities, such as the Kolubara lignite mine and associated 
power plant - although this significant private investments in the sector have yet to be realized. 

49. 

Financial Sector Reform: The Government has divested most o f its banking sector holdings to 
international strategic investors, retaining control over 4 (small) majority owned banks and minority 
stakes in 5 other banks, which respectively total 3% and 12% o f the banking system asse ts at end-June 
2006. I n addition, the Deposit Insurance Agency has launched the sale o f Serbia’s second largest insurer, 
DDOR. The banking sector i s predominantly privately owned, with a large influx o f foreign banks. 
Through implementation o f the recently effective new Law on Banks, the National Bank o f Serbia has 
continued to strengthen i t s bank and insurance supervisory regimes with external inputs provided by a 

50 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO I -FY I1 

Annex 2 
number o f donors. Partly as a result o f these reforms, credit growth in Serbia has been extremely rapid, 
although from a low base, increasing from 20 percent o f GDP in 2003 to over 80 percent o f GDP in 2007. 

50. World Bank Group engagement has played a considerable role in assisting the Authorities 
undertake such reform efforts. Much o f the overarching framework for Bank engagement was set in the 
2004 Serbia Economic Memorandum “An Agenda for Economic Growth and Employment” as well as 
analysis conducted in FY05 on the privatization process and the Investment Climate Assessment. The 
Structural Adjustment Credit 2 (FY05) supported the enactment o f a new Company Law, significantly 
easing business entry by reducing minimum capital requirements and strengthening corporate governance 
requirements, strengthening the scope for creditors to seek redress, and building regulatory impact 
assessment capacity. A private and f inanc ia l sector development policy credit (FY06) supported efforts 
by the Authorities to reduce subsidies to corporate loss makers, continue the privatization program, and 
strengthening bankruptcy procedures, and deepen financial sector reforms. Energy sector reform was 
supported through both the SAC 2 and the PPFDPL, as well as an energy investment operation (FY05) 
supporting unbundling and restructuring o f energy assets consistent with the South East Europe regional 
energy market t rea ty signed in Athens. Technical assistance investments by the Bank have supported the 
work o f the Privatization Agency. IFC has provided technical assistance to help prepare JAT, the s ta te 
airline company, for privatization. IFC investments and M IGA guarantees have significantly expanded 
foreign investment in the financial sector and the scope for SMEs to access credit to build their 
businesses. 

5 1. 
I n addition to support for overall reform efforts, Bank investments (FY02) and M IGA technical 
assistance supported the establishment o f the Serbian Export Credit Agency (SMECA). In 2006, SMECA 
provided insurance to support exports o f over Euro 510 million, or 13 percent o f Serbia’s total exports. 

52 . 
Bank support through a cadastre investment (FY04) has made registering property easier, with an 
associated rapid growth in property transactions and the use o f mortgages. The rea l estate cadastre now 
covers over 80 percent o f the country. Transactions involving land increased from just under 300,000 in 
2005 to 330,000 in 2006, and are likely to reach almost 400,000 in 2007 (the original target for 2010). 
Improved cadastral services have resulted in mortgages being provided for over 5 percent o f a l l land 
transactions in 2007, compared to less than 3 percent in 2006 (exceeding conservative original targets). 
Registration times have fallen from 27 to 23 days for land sales, and from 13 to 9 days for mortgages. 

5 3 . 
The trade and transport facilitation project (FY02) has helped to reduce customs processing times 
by an average o f 73 percent. Revenue collected per s t a f f member increased from $50,000 in 2000 to $1.3 
million in 2006. Declarations per customs s t a f f increased to 3 7 3 . 75 percent o f importers surveyed noted 
an improvement in transparency o f customs services since 2002. BEEPS also highlights significant 
improvements in perceptions by users o f the extent o f corruption at customs. The Transport 
Rehabilitation Project (FY04) has supported the institutional strengthening o f the Public Enterprise 
‘Putevi Srbije’ (PEPS), a f te r i t s establishment following the passage o f the new Law on Public Roads in 
November 2005. The project has assisted the establishment with technical assistance, training, services, 
and goods to strengthen the management and planning o f the road network in Serbia. The project has also 
supported the rehabilitation o f priority sections o f the primary and secondary road network, totaling 140 
km in length, and assisted the PEPS s t a f f to pilot performance based contracts for winter maintenance and 
routine maintenance for 1,200 km o f roads in the MaEva and Kolubara regions. These contracts proved 
so successful, in terms o f the efficiency gains - comparison o f unit costs for pilot regions with average 
costs for Serbia in the winter season o f 2006-2007 reveals salt consumption in the pilot regions was 0.685 
ton/km compared to 2.536 ton/km in Serbia; unit cost o f winter maintenance in pilot territory was 
207.806 Euro/km, while overall in Serbia i t was 572.328 Euro/km - the approach has recently been 
extended to the remaining twenty five regions o f Serbia, starting from Ap r i l 2008.

Annex 2 

C. G o a l 3 : Reduce Poverty and Improve Soc ia l Pro tec t ion and Soc ia l Services 
Performance: Satisfactory 

54 . 
Poverty has fa l len from 14.6 percent o f the population in 2004 to 8 . 8 percent in 2006 - well on 
track to meet Government’s target - set out in the 2003 PRS - to reduce poverty to 6.5 percent by 2010. 

5 5 . 
The Bank’s support for Serbia’s successful efforts to reduce poverty has been provided in the 
framework o f the Government o f Serbia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2003). The PRS 
recognizes the need to focus on economic development and i t represents a plan o f activities aimed a t 
reducing key types o f poverty by creating financial and other preconditions and by offering everyone the 
opportunity to support themselves and their families. Key pillars o f the PRS include: (i) dynamic 
economic growth and development with an emphasis on job creation; (ii) the prevention o f new poverty 
that w i l l result from necessary modernization and restructuring o f the economy; and (iii) the efficient 
implementation o f existing programs and development o f new programs directly targeting the poorest and 
the most vulnerable groups, particularly in the leas t developed regions. Responsibility for implementing 
the PRS currently r e s t s with the Deputy Prime Minister. This has allowed the PRS objectives and 
activities to be integrated into overall Government programs in Serbia more effectively than perhaps any 
other country in the Western Balkans region. A first PRS progress report was submitted to the World 
Bank and IMF in October 2005 and the joint IDA - IMF s t a f f advisory note was issued on February 16, 
2006. The Bank has been actively supporting PRS Team working under DPM ’s office. The Bank has 
been managing a donor supported Trust Fund to support PRS implementation. 

56. 
A particular concern in Serbia, given already high unemployment (which remains a persistent 
problem at about 20 percent o f the labor force) and the correlation between poverty and employment, has 
been to strengthen opportunities for workers made redundant from the necessary but painful process of 
privatization and corporate restructuring. Under the employment promotion learning and investment 
credit (FY03) the Bank supported the establishment o f 13 Work Transition Centers (WTCs) in 10 regions 
established (rather than 10 in 4 regions as planned). WTCs assisted those laid o f f as a result of 
restructuring and privatization. Support to redundant workers included f i n a n c i a l compensation as well as 
the opportunity for redeployment, training and self-employment. An estimated 7,000 workers received 
counseling services and information, 2,000 workers were retrained, and around 800 new jobs were 
created or saved in pilot enterprises. Previously, such services were nonexistent. Government amended 
relevant legislation to recommend that a l l enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization establish 
WTCs. Piloting and testing o f a fu l l range o f employment services under this investment has also 
allowed the Government to restructure ALMPs towards those with greater demonstrated effectiveness. 
The results o f three waves o f tracer surveys o f redundant workers confirm much lower placement rates o f 
non-participants than almost any o f the ALMPs implemented (except vacancy fairs). 

5 7 . 

Despite considerable improvements, poverty remains persistent in r u r a l areas and among 
minorities, particularly Roma. Rural poverty declined from 20 percent in 2004 to 14 percent in 2006, but 
i s significantly higher than urban ( 5 percent). The depth o f poverty i s also more severe in rural areas. 
Responding to this, the Bank has prepared a new investment aimed to ass is t predominantly small farmers 
in Serbia make the most o f the opportunities offered by greater European integration, and to respond to 
increasingly stringent food safety and quality standards being imposed. Scheduled for FY07, this 
investment was approved in June 2007. 
Impact has consequently been limited. Irrigation and flood 
control investments, however, have helped to improve crop yields by approximately 10 percent in 5,000 
hectares under irrigation - especially important given widespread drought in 2007 - as well as to reduce 
the risks associated with floods. Reflecting solid performance, this project was scaled up in 2007. 

58 . 
Financing for social protection schemes in Serbia continued at approximately 17 percent o f GDP 
for the course o f the CAS period (including pensions). Social assistance programs are well targeted. 

5 2 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYOS-FYI1 

Annex 2 
Estimates suggest that poverty would increase by a third on current levels if it was not for such social 
protection programs. Nevertheless, while well targeted, coverage i s limited, and not a l l the poor receive 
social assistance. During the course o f the CAS, SAC2 supported the expansion o f Serbia’s main social 
safety net program, the Ma te r ia l Support to Families program (MOP), allowing a modest expansion o f 
coverage from 43,000 to 56,000 families. SAC2 also supported Government efforts to introduce a new 
scheme to mitigate the impact o f electricity t a r i f f increases on the most vulnerable. Under this program, 
recipients o f child benefits, the minimum pension, and the MOP, receive a 30% discount on the first 
300kW o f monthly electricity consumption. This has provided additional support to between 80,000 and 
100,000 poor families. As discussed under goal 1, changes in parametric pension parameters have also 
increased pensions initially for current retirees, in part by raising the retirement age for current workers. 
Nevertheless, while ensuring the pension system i s more fiscally sustainable, this i s likely to have to be 
accompanied in the medium-term with the introduction o f greater voluntary retirement savings options for 
those currently in the workforce. 

59. 
Health and education investments approved immediately prior to the CAS FY05 period have also 
helped to improve the quality o f social service delivery. Serbia i s on track to meet education MDGs. 
Primary school completion rates are over 95 percent and do not differ significantly by gender. 
Nevertheless, education investments have been particularly important to strengthen curricula and to 
ensure that the skills provided through the school system adequately prepare young people for the 
workforce. There have been some gains in this regard, although further efforts to reform secondary 
schools, particularly the vocational education system, i s likely to be required. Nevertheless, national 
standards have been established for grades 3 , 4 and 8 and sample based assessments have been conducted. 
I n 2006, national average for mathematics was 60 percent, and Serbian 69 percent. Approximately half o f 
Serbia’s 1,600 primary schools have met standards, and were provided with grants under the project - 
exceeding the target o f 700. Serbia i s also track to meet health MDGs. Infant and maternal mortality i s 
low and falling. Communicable disease prevalence i s low, although monitoring i s warranted, especially 
for high risk groups. Building on this, a health investment has helped t o ensure increased use o f primary 
care physicians rather than expensive tertiary c l in ica l centers, while also improving management o f key 
hospitals. This has helped to improve service quality, with higher numbers o f visits to, and better service 
from, primary health physicians, Users surveyed have generally indicated improved satisfaction with 
health services: a NHS survey shows increase in user satisfaction from 74 percent in 2005 to 79 percent in 
2006, and a U S S survey shows increase from 79 percent to 8 1 percent between 2005 and 2006. A 
particular challenge w i l l be to maintain the quality o f health and education service delivery in an 
increasing decentralized system. A new Delivery o f Local Social Services (D L S ) investment, scheduled 
la te 2007, i s intended to ass is t the Authorities with this challenge. 

60. 
Investments have been supported by analytical work, including: (i) annual programmatic poverty 
assessments, (ii) monitoring of, and reporting on PRS implementation, and (iii) notes on social service 
delivery, delivery o f social services in a decentralized environment, and rural and Roma poverty issues. 

V. 

O v e r a l l B a n k Pe r fo rmance 

61. 
Overall Bank performance i s considered to be satisfactory. A t the highest level, CAS indicators 
have essentially been met. Public expenditure has f a l l e n from 47 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 42 percent in 
2006 - although with recent slippages likely to see expenditures creep slightly over the 43 percent target 
in 2007. Growth averaging 7 percent during the CAS period has been strong, underpinned by significant 
structural reforms. While a large reform agenda remains, the extent o f reform at this early stage o f the 
transition period has been impressive. From 2003 to 2006, poverty f e l l from 14.6 percent to 8.8 percent 
o f the population, and the Government i s already c lose to meeting the target o f 7 percent set in the PRS 
for 2010. In a l l cases, although direct causality can sometimes be difficult to determine exactly, Bank 

5 3

Annex 2 

development policy loans, investments and analytical services appear to have made a contribution to these 
outcomes. 

62. 

The CAS FY05 was, in retrospect, overly ambitious in the anticipated delivery o f development 
policy operations at a time when the overall f inanc ia l and economic situation in Serbia improved to the 
extent that Serbia was able to pre-pay the Bank, and given political uncertainty even in a time o f relative 
political stability - at least by the standards o f the Balkans in recent history. On the other hand, the Bank 
was able to respond effectively by meeting demand to scale up well performing activities. Although the 
need to replace development policy operations with new and scaled up investments resulted in some 
delays in the delivery o f operations, the base case program was fully delivered. Delays were also due in 
large part to the political uncertainty in late 2006 and early 2007 associated with the Parliamentary 
elections and the formation o f a new Government. 

63. 

Po r t fo l io performance has generally been strong, with problems that did emerge being quickly 
and, in most cases effectively, addressed. Particular problems identified in the JPPR related to the 
education and health investments, for instance, have been addressed. I n the current portfolio, only one 
investment - pensions reform - i s currently under-performing, although even that has helped to support 
significant legislative and parametric reform. IEG has considered that a l l projects exiting the portfolio 
have had a satisfactory or moderately satisfactory development outcome. Disbursement rates have also 
improved significantly since the JPPR, and the conclusion o f the JPPR that low disbursement rates in 
mid-2006 generally reflected the young age o f the portfolio seems justified. Current disbursement rates 
o f approximately 20 percent suggest that implementation o f the portfolio i s proceeding approximately as 
planned. Nevertheless, further attention w i l l be required to address some o f the reasons for initial delays 
identified by the JPPR in project implementation after Board approval and effectiveness. These include: 
cumbersome effectiveness procedures, projects not being sufficiently ready for implementation at the 
time o f Board approval, inadequate procurement and project management capacity, high turnover o f key 
staff (both Government and Bank), unclear roles and responsibilities, and vested interests. 

64. 
The Bank made good use o f analytical products. The program o f economic and sector work was 
delivered in full. Core ana ly t ica l work, including the Serbia Economic Memorandum, the Public 
Expenditure and Institutional Review update, the integrated public financial management assessment, as 
well as notes on privatization, f inanc ia l sector, and labor market issues, underpinned the Bank’s policy 
dialogue, including that conducted as part o f the successful SAC2 and PPFDPL programs. Other 
ana ly t ica l work, including on decentralization and service delivery, and agricultural competitiveness in 
the European context, have led directly to investment operations. 

65 . 

The work o f different parts o f the Bank Group has generally been mutually complementary. 
Bank engagement on financial sector issues has helped to open the way for financial sector investments 
by IFC and MIGA, and such investments have in turn strengthened the overall banking and financial 
sector in Serbia. At a time when the National bank o f Serbia i s now becoming increasingly concerned 
about overly rapid credit growth, however, there w i l l be continuing needs to ensure that Bank policy 
advice and investments and guarantees by other parts o f the Bank group are well coordinated. Over time, 
new investments by IFC and guarantees by M IGA are likely to become and increasingly central element 
o f overall Bank Group engagement with Serbia. There i s considerable scope for the Bank and IFC to 
work closely as IFC seeks to expand investments beyond a traditional focus on the f inanc ia l sector to 
support private provision o f infrastructure services (including roads and energy), as well as private 
provision o f soc ia l services (including education, health, private pensions). Efforts w i l l be required to 
ensure coordination o f IFC, M IGA and Bank technical assistance, although MIGA’s support to SMECA 
and to analyze business environment issues, IFC ’s engagement on the privatization o f JAT, and Bank 
assistance for SMECA and the privatization agency demonstrate the scope for synergies. 

54

Annex 2 

6 6 . 

Donor coordination has been gradually improved. The cen t ra l ro le being played by the o f f i ce o f 
the Deputy Prime Minister in the coordination o f the PRS strategy and implementation has particularly 
helped to ensure that these issues are better integrated across “whole o f Government” policy than in many 
neighboring countries. Still, there remains space for further enhancement. Given Serbia’s European 
perspective, the SAA agenda and the European Commission i s likely to be taking an increasingly central 
role. Further linking Bank support to EU priorities and improving coordination with the EC w i l l be 
important to ensure complementarity. With the EC, the Bank i s also working with Serbian authorities in 
order to facilitate harmonization and public sector reform. Cooperation with EBRD and EIB i s mostly 
focused on private sector development, while PRS agenda i s supported jointly by the Bank, UNDP, DFID 
and bilateral donors. The Bank has generally worked closely with the IMF, although even c loser 
coordination w i l l be important, especially given the centrality o f the structural reform agenda in Serbia. 

V I . 

Lessons fo r Subsequent CPS Design 

6 7 . 

The areas of focus in the CAS were appropriate, and the mix o f interventions ultimately 

approved supported objectives well. Given the substantial progress made by Serbia, and the 
contributions made by the Bank to that progress, CAS implementation can be considered overall 
satisfactory. 

6 8 . 

Bank support should focus increasingly on Serbia’s integration w ith the EU. With the 

conclusion o f technical discussions on the SAA, support fo r EU integration should be an explicit 
objective for the Bank. Closer integration with the EU w i l l require significant investments to harmonize 
legislation and standards and to meet stringent environment and food safety standards. Support to build 
the capacity o f the Serbian Government to use potential increases in IPA financing w i l l also be crucial, 
given the experience o f other countries in the region, which were not able to utilize an average o f 40 
percent o f the financing made available. 

69 . W i th Serbia still at an early stage in the transition process, continuing the outstanding 
structural reform agenda must be a critical element in the forthcoming CPS, in order to encourage 

continued growth and increase jobs. Further enterprise reform, financial sector reform and 
improvements in the business environment w i l l be vital to help ensure current levels o f growth can be 
sustained. Continuing e f fo r ts w i l l also be required to help ensure that a l l parts o f the population have the 
skills and ability to share in and benefit from economic growth. 

70. 
Development policy lending can prove to be a useful instrument to support reform efforts, 
although Serbia’s current economic position w i l l require the use o f innovative instruments, such as 

potentially deferred drawdown operations. The Government has indicated that Bank program with 
specific benchmarks and timetables could assist them in pursuing a reform agenda, particularly on the 
private sector side. Nevertheless, the Government does not need significant balance o f payments support 
at this stage. While development policy lending can play a valuable role, the experience in the last CAS 
also suggests that i t should not be overused. Investment instruments, when well targeted and designed, 
can also be useful to assist the reform agenda. 

71. 

The Bank w i l l need to ensure that assistance i s able to be provided even more flexibly and in 

response to client demand. With the transition from IDA to IBRD financing, as well as the range o f 
financing options available Serbia, i t i s imperative that the Bank be even more responsive to Serbian 
priorities. Careful dialog with the client w i l l be required to ensure that the Bank can stay relevant, as w i l l 
greater flexibility. Careful exploration o f new products, including deferred drawdown development 
policy operations, insurance and sub-national lending products w i l l require c lose consideration. A t the 
same time, care w i l l be required to balance the need for flexibility and responsiveness with the need to 
ensure that Bank financing does indeed help to promote reform. 

5 5 

Serbia Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1 

Annex 2 

72. 

Flexibility w i l l be critical given regional uncertainties and r i s k s o f possible political 

instability. Even in a time o f relative stability, as during the past CAS period, the need to replace 
adjustment operations with new and scaled up investments emphasizes the need for flexibility. 

73 . 
Engagement across the Bank Group has been strong and w i l l continue to be important i n 
meeting varied client demands through combining a depth o f country knowledge with global 

expertise. IFC and M IGA w i l l become an increasingly central element o f the Bank Group’s engagement 
i n Serbia over the coming years. There i s considerable scope to exploit potential synergies between 
different parts o f the institution to encourage the further development o f the financial sector (pensions, 
insurance, housing), and to support the private provision o f infrastructure and soc ia l services.

2005, but has s ince started to r i s e to just over 42% o f GDP in 
2006 and 2007 (projected). Nevertheless, GDP adjustments 
during the course o f the CAS period lowered the 2003 starting 
point from 47% to 43.7%. As we l l as an overall decline i n total 
public expenditure, strengthened public revenues transformed a 
deficit o f 3% o f GDP in 2003 into a small surplus i n 2005, 
before a l im i ted deficit o f 1 .5% o f GDP re-emerged in 2006. 
Public expenditure i s increasingly oriented toward investment, 
which now comprises 4.3% o f GDP - double the level o f 2003. 

Reduction in public sector

A new Pensions Law passed in October 2005 and made 
effective in January 2006 w i l l gradually eliminate the f i s c a l 
deficit o f the pension system. For 2006, the Law envisaged a 
one time increase i n m in imum pensions, to be offset over time 
by other measures. The number o f retirees has also increased 
faster than anticipated, in part due to j o b losses associated w i th 
privatization. W h i l e the medium-term outlook has been 
significantly improved by the new Pensions Law, short-term 
indicators in the CAS FY05 have proved overly optimistic.

Results 

D o i n g Business 2006 suggests Serbia was the faster reformer 
globally in 2004-2005. Ma jor reductions in the time (from 51 to 
15 days) and cost required to s tar t a business resulted in 40 
percent more businesses being registered in 2005 compared to 
2003. A new c i v i l procedure code halved the time required to

Over 60 large SOEs have been sold without restructuring. The 
largest was the sale in July 2006 o f the mobile telecoms network 
t o Telenor o f Norway for over Euro 1.5 b i l l ion . 
Another 50 large SOEs were restructured and offered for sale, o f 
which 25 were sold. This includes RTB Bor, the large co per 
m in ing and processing complex in eastern Serbia ( the 2 
largest recipient o f subsidies - at over $1 Om per annum) 

.B 

The government has divested most o f its banking sector 
holdings to strategic foreign investors, retaining stake only o 4 
(small) majority owned banks and minority stakes i n 5 other 
banks, which respectively total 3% and 12% o f the banking 
system assets at end-June 2006. 

Total privatization rece ip ts between 2002 and 2006 amounted to 
approximately Euro 3 b i l l ion . 

Overall subsidies to SOEs declined from 2.7% o f GDP in 2004 
to 1.9% in 2006 (Serbian Government Data). 

Access to finance has been markedly improved through the 
entry o f new foreign owned banks. Total banking sector assets 
have more than doubled since 2004. Do ing Business 2008 ranks 
Serbia as 13 globally in terms o f ease o f obtaining credit in

N o data 

Gross agricultural output has increased by about 10% since 
2000 - but remain subject to annual weather variations. Yields 
are increasing, but remain below EU averages. Growth in 
agricultural exports resulted i n an agricultural trade surplus in 
2005. Tar i f f and non-tariff barriers plus market support 
continue to l im i t exposure o f farmers to competitive forces. 
Nevertheless, continued implementation o f the Government’s 
agricultural 
re fo rm program 
i s 
increasingly 
requiring 
predominantly small scale farmers to improve productivity and 
quality and meet stringent EU food safety requirements. 

A regulatory agency has been established to develop tar i f f 
structures for incumbents and new entrants. I n line with Energy 
Community o f South East Europe requirements, power 
transmission services have been separated from EPS into a new 
transmission company, EMS. EPS has been separated into 
individual legal entities 
for generation and distribution. 
Commercial losses are moderate, and collections are high fo r 
virtually a l l consumer groups. Private sector participation i s 
noticeable in the o i l sector i n retail marketing. Privatization o f 
the State O i l Company ( N I S ) i s still being considered. Private 
involvement in new generation investments (such as 
the 
Kolubara mine and plant) i s likely. 

The real estate cadastre now covers over 80% o f the country. 
Transactions involving land increased from just under 300,000 
in 2005 to 330,000 in 2006, and are likely to reach almost 
400,000 in 2007 (the original target for 2010). 
Improved 
cadastral services have resulted in mortgages being provided for 
over 5% o f a l l land transactions i n 2007, compared to less than 
3% 
in 2006 
(exceeding conservative original 
targets). 
Registration times have fallen from 27 to 23 days for land sales, 
and from 13 to 9 days for mortgages.

Results 

Poverty has fallen from 14.6% o f the population in 2004 t o 
8.8% i n 2006. Nevertheless, poverty remains persistent i n r u r a l 
areas and among minorities, particularly Roma. 

Rural poverty declined from 20% i n 2004 to 14% i n 2006. 
Rural poverty rates remain significantly higher than urban (5%), 
and two thirds o f the poor are located in rural areas. Poverty i s 
also more severe i n rural areas. Poverty i n the Bor region i s 
worse than the national average, and shows l im i ted 
improvement (a bank investment scheduled for FY06 was 
approved i n June 2007). Agricultural productivity i s improving 
slightly (see goal 2) although challenges remain. Wor ld Bank 
irrigation investments have helped to improve crop production 
by 10% on over 5,000 ha. 

13 Work Transition Centers in 10 regions established, rather 
than 10 in 4 regions as planned. WTCs assisted those la id o f f as 
a result o f restructuring and privatization. Support to redundant 
workers included financial compensation as we l l as the 
opportunity for redeployment, training and self-employment, 
A n estimated 7,000 workers received counseling s e r v i c e s and 
information, 2,000 workers were retrained, and around 8 0 0 new 
jobs were created or saved in p i lo t en te rp r ises . Previously, such 
s e r v i c e s were nonexistent. Government amended relevant 
legislation to recommend that a l l enterprises undergoing 
restructuring and privatization establish WTCs. 

New menu o f ALMPs

Relations with the European Union and Progress on the 
Stabilization and Association Process ( S A P ) 

I. 

S A P and SAA 

The Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) i s a special regional approach o f the European 
Union (EU) designed exclusively for the Western Balkan countries to pave their way fo r membership 
in the EU. I t i s the cornerstone o f the EU’s policy towards the region and i t aims to promote stability 
while a lso facilitating c loser association with the EU. 

The concept o f SAP dates back to the Zagreb summit in November 2000 when the EU and the 
Westem Balkan countries agreed on the guiding principles o f SAP. These principles include the 
recognition that: i ) the main motivator for reform in these countries i s a relationship with the EU, 
based on the credible prospect o f membership; i i ) the countries need to establish bilateral 
relationships between themselves to allow greater economic and political stability in the region to 
develop, and iii) given the diversity o f the countries in the region, a more flexible approach i s needed 
from the EU’s side to allows each country to move ahead at i t s own pace. 

The EU had previously stated in its Council meeting in Feira in June 2000 that the future o f the 
Western Balkans countries l i e s within the European Union. The Zagreb summit provided the 
necessary instruments for the EU to fu l f i l l the Feira commitments. S ince then the EU has reaffirmed 
on many occasions that i t s ultimate goal i s the fu l l integration o f the Western Balkan countries into 
the EU, once the countries have fulfilled the necessary conditions for membership.’ 

A key element o f the SAP i s the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) which represents a 
far-reaching contractual relationship between the EU and the candidate country, entailing mutual 
rights and obligations. The SAA i s signed with countries that have made sufficient progress in terms 
o f political and economic reform and building administrative capacities necessary for convergence 
with Europe. The SAP also offers a mixture o f trade concessions and a f inanc ia l assistance programs 
to the countries included in the SAP. Once the SAA has been signed and ratified, the country i s 
eligible to become a candidate country. The SAA foresees the establishment o f a f r e e trade area 
between the candidate country and the EU by the end o f a five-year transition period and enhanced 
cooperation in the economic field. The SAA also stipulates increased cooperation in the fields of 
environmental protection, justice and security. 

According to the EU, the main benefits o f the SAA: i) economic development through enhanced trade 
and economic cooperation and the creation o f a business environment facilitating investments, 
encouraging individual entrepreneurial initiatives and generating employment; ii) enhanced political 
stability and security due to good re la t ions with neighbors, greater regional co-operation and deeper 
integration in to the EU; and iii) progress in the process o f political and economic reforms, including 
in the areas o f institution building, public administration reform, respect o f human rights and the rule 
o f law, which are necessary to improve the quality o f l i f e fo r a l l c i t izens . The SAP was expanded to 
include a new instrument, the European Partnership, at the EU Thessaloniki Council meeting in 2003. 

These conditions include the Copenhagen criteria that outlines the core accession conditions for candidate countries: i) 
stability o f institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule o f law, human rights and respect for and protection o f minorities; 
ii) existence o f functioning market economy, as we l l as capacity to cope w i th competitive pressure and market forces w i th in 
the EU; and iii) ability to take on the obligations o f membership, including adherence to the aims o f political, economic and 
monetary union.

11. 

Current status o f the S A P in Serbia 

Serbia initialed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Commission in 
November 2007. 

The SAP process was officially launched in Serbia in 2001. Relations between Serbia and the EU 
followed a generally positive trend until 2006. The country made rapid advances on the EU’s 
political and economic criteria and implemented several key reforms urged by the EU. An EC 
feasibility report recommending the launch o f SAA negotiations with Serbia was endorsed by the EU 
Council in May 2005. This was based on the conclusion that Serbia had advanced sufficiently in key 
areas to start S A A negotiations. 

S A A negotiations were officially launched on October 10, 2005, using a twin-track approach, with 
negotiations conducted with the Serbia and Montenegro State Union and individually each o f the 
constituent republics, depending on the field o f competence. The EC and the EU Council, however, 
stated explicitly that the continuation and the pace o f the SAA talks would depend on Serbia’s 
compliance in highlighted issues, especially with regard to Serbia’s cooperation with the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). During the first eight months o f the SAA 
negotiations the technical talks advanced quickly and large parts o f the agreement text were agreed 
upon. However, following a negative assessment on Serbia’s cooperation with the ICTY, the SAA 
negotiations were put on hold in May 2006. Negotiations resumed in June 2007 following 
improvements in Serbia’s cooperation with the ICTY, including the a r res ts two ICTY fugitives. 
Upon restarting the SAA negotiations, the EC stated that the conclusion o f the S A A negotiations 
would depend on Serbia’s progress in developing the necessary legislative framework and 
administrative capacity to implement i t s obligations under the SAA, as well as on i t s future 
cooperation with the ICTY .’ Technical negotiations were concluded in September 2007. 
The next step w i l l be for the SAA to be signed, which should occur in early 2008, subject to 
continued Serbian cooperation with ICTY. Ratification w i l l then require the SAA to be approved by 
national parliaments in EU member states. The Serbian government has stated that i t hopes to receive 
the status o f candidate country during 2008 and enter the EU between 2012 and 2014. 

I n i t s la tes t progress report released in November 2007, the EU Commission commended Serbia for 
i t s good economic performance, constructive approach to regional cooperation projects and for 
showing that i t has a good administrative capacity to progress towards the EU and to implement a 
future SAA. Progress was also achieved in areas such as f r e e movement o f goods, customs and 
taxation, Industry and SMEs, agriculture and visa facilitation. Nevertheless, the EC i s concerned 
about lack o f process in judicial reform, enforcement o f human rights (especially minority rights), 
high unemployment, lack o f flexibility in the labor market, and widespread c o r r ~ p t i o n . ~ 

111. EU financial assistance to Serbia 

S ince 2001, the EC has provided very significant financial assistance to Serbia. Between 1998 and 
2006, the EC committed nearly 1.3 billion euros to support reforms in Serbia alone, with annual 
commitments between 150 and 220 million euros. These figures include the EC’s macro-financial 
support and funds disbursed under the CARDS program.

Annex 4 

The focus areas o f EC f inanc ia l assistance has evolved s ince the 1990s, switching from humanitarian 
aid, conflict management and post-conflict reconstruction towards supporting political, institutional 
and economic reforms, with the overall objective to facilitate a closer association with the EU. In 
recent years the CARDS assistance program has focused mainly on the European Partnership 
priorities, while taking also into account the requirements Serbia w i l l have to meet to conclude the 
SAA negotiations and implement the agreement. In addition to having its own CARDS program, 
Serbia also benefits from a regional CARDS scheme that supports actions in the interest for the whole 
Western Balkans region in the fields o f infrastructure, institution building and cross-border 
cooperation. 

In order to simplify and harmonize the different external aid components, to facilitate coherence and 
improve consistency and to achieve better results and to improve consistency, the EU i s currently 
adopting a new financial a id mechanism to replace a l l previous external assistance programs for 
candidate and potential candidate countries. The new mechanism, ca l led IPA (Instrument for Pre- 
Accession Assistance) w i l l replace the CARDS program in the Western Balkan region and i t w i l l be 
operative during the period o f 2007-20 13. 

The total f inanc ia l allocation granted to Serbia under IPA amount to 976,8 million Euros during the 
period o f 2007 - 201 1, with average annual allocation o f around 195 million Euros during the five- 
year period." IPA i s made up o f five components: (i) support for transition and institution building; 
(ii) cross-border cooperation; (iii) regional development, (iv) human resources development; and (v) 
rural development. The first two components concern a l l beneficiary countries, whereas the three 
latter components are aimed at EU candidate countries only. Therefore Serbia, being a potential 
candidate country, only benefits at this stage from activities under the two first components. In this 
framework, IPA w i l l support Serb ia to: 
1. Fu lf i l l the political requirements of the S A P and lay foundations f o r the fulfillment o f the 
Copenhagen criteria. In order to achieve this goal, the EC w i l l focus on the following areas in 
Serbia: i) strengthening democratic institutions, decentralization and local governments, budget 
and f i s c a l management, r u l e o f law, reform o f the judiciary and public administration reform; ii) 
intensify the fight against corruption, reform o f the police; iii) advancing human rights and 
protection o f minorities, antidiscrimination; and iv) supporting c iv i l society and the media. 
Improve the socio-economic situation. P A w i l l finance activities in the areas o f i) employment 
generation; ii) education; iii) soc ia l inclusion; iv) health; v) business environment, S M E 
restructuring and competitiveness; vi) infrastructure and inland waterway transport; vii) f lood 
prevention; and viii) rural development. 
3 . Approximate to European Standards in sectors related to 
the 
introduction and 
implementation o f the EU Acquis i n all areas, including the overall coordination o f the 
European integration process. This component aims to strengthen Serbian administrative 
capacities to implement the SAA once i t has been signed. 

2. 

With IPA, the EC also wants to develop loca l ownership in the fund management framework and to 
help prepare the authorities for the introduction o f the Decentralized Implementation System (DIS) to 
self-manage EC funds. However, administrative capacities need to be further strengthened 
throughout the administration in Serbia to implement the IPA program. According to the EC, further 
measures should also be identified to address the continued weak inter-ministerial relations, 
coordination and communication which undermine implementation o f EU policies.
