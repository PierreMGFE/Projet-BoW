I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i 

This is the fourth Country Assistance Strategy for Ma law i , and ou t l ines a p r o g r am o f 

Assistance cove r ing FY07-10 in support o f imp lemen ta t ion o f the M a l a w i G r o w t h and 
Deve lopmen t Strategy (MGDS ) . The C A S outlines a p roposed p r o g r am o f IDA f i n a n c i a l 
support l i k e l y to to ta l a round US$340 m i l l i o n over the period, as w e l l as an in teg ra ted b o d y o f 
A n a l y t i c a l and A d v i s o r y A c t i v i t i e s (AAA) and Econom ic and Sector W o r k (ESW) that w i l l 
unde rp in p lanned f inanc ia l operations. T h e p rog ram also inc ludes ac t iv i t ies in tended by the 
W o r l d B a n k Ins t i tu te (WBI) f o r w h i c h M a l a w i i s a focus coun t ry . The IFC has h a d m i n i m a l 
a c t i v i t y in M a l a w i in recent years due to the highly unce r ta in economic environment, a n d thus 
this i s n o t a j o i n t CAS . Howeve r , with recent imp rovemen ts in the econom ic c l ima te the I F C 
i s n o w ac t ive ly l o o k i n g f o r n ew oppo r tun i t ies in Ma law i , and w i l l b e w o r k i n g c lose ly with the 
B a n k to i d e n t i f y f inanc ing and techn ica l assistance oppo r tun i t ies that are comp lemen ta ry t o the 
Bank ’s efforts. S im i l a r l y i t i s hoped that oppo r tun i t ies can b e i d e n t i f i e d f o r MIGA to leverage 
add i t iona l p r iva te sector support f o r the M G D S . 

ii. 
As a small, densely populated, landlocked country with one of 
the lowest 
GDPskapita in the world, Ma law i faces formidable development challenges. Desp i te 

substantial e f fo r ts ove r the last decade, i n c l u d i n g s ign i f ican t amounts o f deve lopmen t 
assistance, p o v e r t y has rema ined la rge ly unchanged. M o r e than h a l f o f the p o p u l a t i o n s t i l l 
l ives b e l ow the pove r ty line, and m o r e than one in f i v e peop le are unab le t o mee t basic d a i l y 
f o o d needs. A m a j o r i t y o f the popu la t ion i s engaged in ra in - fed subsistence agriculture, and i s 
highly vulnerable t o droughts, wh ich , in con junc t ion with p o o r l y deve loped input and ou tpu t 
markets, leads to ch ron ic f o o d insecu r i ty a n d contributes to widespread ma lnu t r i t ion . T h e lack 
o f economic g r ow t h over the last decade in M a l a w i and the high p o p u l a t i o n g r ow t h rate, 
exp la in the persistent high rates o f pove r ty . Howeve r , the n ew Gove rnmen t o f President 
Bingu w a M u t h a r i k a has managed to c o n t r o l spending and bring mac roeconom ic stability 
since c om i n g t o p ow e r in 2004, w h i c h o f fe rs the p o s s i b i l i t y o f M a l a w i m a k i n g in roads o n 
pove r ty in the med ium - te rm . M a l a w i reached the HIPC Comp le t ion p o i n t in August o f 2006, 
also bene f i t ing f r o m the M u l t i l a t e r a l D e b t R e l i e f In i t ia t ive . 

iii. 
With limited known natural resource endowments, in the short- to medium term 
Ma law i will rely on improving agricultural productivity to drive economic growth. W h i l e 

the M G D S iden t i f ies sectors such as mining and tou r ism as po ten t ia l d r ive rs o f g row th , at 
present l i t t l e i s k n o w n about po ten t ia l f r o m these sectors. With 85 pe rcen t o f the p o p u l a t i o n 
engaged in ag r icu l tu re and the ove ra rch ing impo r tance o f ach iev ing f o o d security t o longe r 
t e rm efforts t o d ive rs i fy the economy, inc reas ing ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i v i t y i s w i d e l y agreed as 
a s ine qua non f o r sustained p o v e r t y reduc t ion in M a l aw i . This w i l l requ i re e f fo r ts t o m i t i g a t e 
the effects o f pe r iod ic droughts, increase i r r iga t ion , develop and strengthen input and ou tpu t 
markets, imp rove infrastructure, and im p r o v e the ove ra l l inves tmen t c l ima te in M a l aw i . 

iv. 

Improving Malawi’s integration with the other economies in the region is also 

crucial. I t i s u n l i k e l y that M a l a w i w i l l ever have su f f ic ien t domestic demand to a l l ow i t t o 
f lou r ish w i thou t strong trade ties t o i t s ne ighbo rs and the broader reg ion . Sustained econom ic 
g r ow t h in M a l a w i w i l l requ i re concerted e f fo r ts t o integrate seamlessly w i th r e g i o n a l and 

in te rna t iona l ma rke ts to take advantage o f the oppo r tun i t ies o f fe red by strong econom ic 
g r ow t h in nea rby economies such as Mozamb ique and Sou th A f r ica . 

V. 

Th e Bank ’s proposedprogram is closely aligned with those of other major partners 
in support of 
the MGDS, and i s designed to further the Pa r is Agenda. The p roposed 

p rog ram has been developed in close coo rd ina t ion with other development partners in 
M a l aw i , a n d i s fu l ly consistent with the Deve lopmen t Assistance Strategy w h i c h has been 
developed by the Ministry o f Finance t o a l i g n donor support t o the M G D S . The p r o g r am 
builds o n a k e y lesson f r o m a recent Coun t ry Assistance Eva lua t ion (CAE ) and C A S 
Comp le t ion Repo r t (CASCR ) and seeks t o support p rog ramma t ic approaches in a l l areas o f 
engagement. The proposed B a n k p rog ram i s selective with a s t rong focus o n agriculture, 
infrastructure, and p r iva te sector development (PSD). W h i l e the proposed p rog ram w o u l d see 
B a n k engagement in the hea l th sector reduce, the B a n k w o u l d r em a i n s t rong ly engaged in 
support o f the H I V I A I D S program, and education. 

vi. 

F o r each CAS outcome, the program defines the contribution to the most related 
M G D S goal, the outcomes and indicators to be achieved du r ing the CAS period, and 

milestones for progress. The fou r C A S outcomes are as fo l lows : (i) im p r o v e sma l lho lde r

INTRODUCTION 

1. 

This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covers the four-year period from F Y 0 7 to 
FY IO . The CAS represents the W o r l d Bank ’s strategic a l ignmen t with the Government’s 
f ive -yea r M a l a w i G r ow t h and Deve lopmen t Strategy (2006 -1 1). I t rev iews recent progress in 
M a l aw i ’ s economic and social development and iden t i f ies the k e y deve lopmen t challenges 
fac ing M a l aw i . The CAS was developed in close co l labo ra t ion with the Gove rnmen t o f 
M a l a w i and proposes a p r o g r am o f assistance that w i l l support the Gove rnmen t ’s e f fo r ts t o 
achieve broad-based g r ow t h and pove r ty reduction. The CAS a ims t o focus o n a sm a l l 
numbe r o f k e y outcomes and t o im p r o v e coo rd ina t ion and cooperation with M a l aw i ’ s other 
deve lopmen t partners. 

2. 
M a l aw i is a small, densely populated, land-locked country, with one of 
the lowest 
levels of pe r capita income in the world (US$164 in 2004). A lm o s t 90 percent o f the 
popu la t ion l ives in r u r a l areas, whe re the m a j o r i t y i s engaged in smallholder, ra in - fed 
subsistence agriculture. M o s t peop le are highly vu lne rab le t o annual r a i n f a l l vo la t i l i ty , a n d 
there i s ch ron ic f o o d insecu r i ty and widespread ma lnu t r i t ion . M o r e than h a l f o f the 
popu la t ion l ives b e l ow the p o v e r t y line, with m o r e than one in f i v e peop le unab le t o mee t 
the i r basic d a i l y f o o d needs. 

3. 

Despite efforts over the last decade, there rema in formidable challenges to Ma law i ’s 
economic growth and development. The impac t o f emigration, H I V / A I D S , de te r io ra t ing 
infrastructure, macroeconomic instability and l im i t e d competitiveness o f M a l aw i a n p roduc ts 
in in te rna t iona l markets has hurt M a l aw i ’ s economy and resulted in widespread pove r ty . T h e 
de l ive ry o f hea l th care, the p r o v i s i o n o f other services such as wa te r supply and sanitation, 
access to sk i l ls training, and emp loymen t have a l l su f fe red because o f these factors. 
In 
addition, vu lne rab i l i ty t o weather shocks, corresponding economic uncertainty, and d i f f i c u l t y 
in a t t rac t ing p roduc t ive investments t o e f fec t ive ly compete in in te rna t iona l ma rke ts threatens 
economic and social development. 

4. 
The Government of M a l aw i has taken encouraging steps to address the challenges 
the country faces. The Gove rnmen t has enforced s t r ic t f isca l d isc ip l ine and, as a result, 
macroeconomic pe r fo rmance since June 2004 has been r a p i d l y imp rov ing . In add i t ion , the 
Gove rnmen t has just f ina l ized a comprehensive m e d i um - t e rm strategy, the M a l a w i G r o w t h 
and Deve lopmen t Strategy (MGDS ) . Th is strategy seeks t o achieve the aspirations o f M a l a w i 
as de f ined in V i s i o n 2020 and the M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals, as loca l ized t o the M a l a w i 
context. The M G D S enjoys the prospect o f be ing owned at the h ighes t l e v e l o f p o l i t i c a l 
au tho r i ty and th rough that the prospect o f w i d e r and m o r e genuine coun t ry owne rsh ip . This 
l e v e l o f comm i tmen t i s coup led with e f fo r ts f o r im p r o v e d coo rd ina t ion o f ac t iv i t ies o f 
development partners by government.

POLITICAL CONTEXT 

111. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

5 . 
The Government is committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability and 
pursuing sustainable fiscal policies. Since com ing to p ow e r in 2004, the Gove rnmen t has 

w o r k e d ha rd t o con t ro l p u b l i c spending and reduce the la rge p u b l i c deb t i t inhe r i ted f r o m i t s 
predecessor. With the n e x t pa r l iamen ta ry and p res iden t ia l elections scheduled in 2009, the 
n e x t tw o years presents a c ruc ia l w i n d ow o f oppo r tun i ty f o r the Bank to engage with a 
re fo rm -m inded government. 

6. 

Continuing divisions between the President and the former ruling party could 
impede reform progress. Ma law i has been a multi-party democracy since 1994. Cu r ren t 

President Bingu wa Mutharika was elected in May 2004, as the ruling U n i t e d Democ ra t ic 
F r o n t (UDF) candidate, but subsequently split f r o m the UDF t o f o r m a n ew party, the 
Democ ra t ic People’s Pa r ty (DPP). 
The Gove rnmen t does n o t command a m a j o r i t y in 
Parliament, whose compos i t ion has been changing frequently, due t o sw i tch ing o f party 
allegiance by MPs. The Gove rnmen t retains about a third o f seats, with the UDF - headed by 
fo rme r president B a k i l i M u l u z i - h o l d i n g rough ly a third and the M a l a w i Congress Pa r ty 
(MCP ) o f fo rme r President Hastings Banda also h o l d i n g abou t a third o f seats. The 
Gove rnmen t has so far been able t o pass leg is la t ion with the support o f va r ious oppos i t ion 
MPs . Howeve r , imp lemen t ing the leg is la t ive agenda i s becom ing inc reas ing ly constrained, 
and passage o f the annua l budge t has been pa r t icu la r ly d i f f i c u l t in the last two years. 

Regionalism and patronage continue to be factors in Ma law i ’s political economy. In 

7 . 
the f i r s t democratic e lec t ion in 1994, p o l i t i c a l pa r ty support was s t rong ly regional: with the 
UDF strong in the South, the M C P s t rong in the center, and the A l l i a n c e f o r Democ racy 
(AFORD) in the N o r t h . Reg iona l ism s t i l l remains a s t rong fac to r in M a l aw i a n society and 
po l i t ics , despite some d im i n u t i o n in recent years, and the apparent widespread support f o r the 
n ew l y created DPP. There are concerns in c i v i l society, that reg iona l ism i s re f lec ted in p u b l i c 
sector appointments and p o l i c y decisions. These issues w i l l con t inue t o b e a challenge in 
Ma law i ’s democratic development, and rema in a risk f o r imp lemen ta t ion o f deve lopmen t 
programs. 

Substantial decentralization has been legislated in recent years, but implementation 

8. 
has been slow. The cu r ren t Gove rnmen t has con t inued a 
t rend towards ministry 
deconcentration and decentralization o f the respons ib i l i t ies t o the 4 0 l o c a l gove rnmen t 
assemblies. These assemb l ies have leg is la t ive respons ib i l i ty f o r adm in is te r ing a substantial 
p o r t i o n o f revenues f o r service p r o v i s i o n (health, education, ag r icu l tu ra l extension), a l though 
in practice cen t ra l gove rnmen t m in is t r ies re ta in substantial in f luence . Wh i le , an ins t i tu t iona l 
f ramewo rk f o r advanc ing the decentralization agenda i s in place, i t lacks the resources, 
capacity and p o l i c y support t o b e fu l ly implemented. A l t h o u g h f i s c a l decen t ra l iza t ion i s b e i n g 
progressively implemented, 
the e f f icacy o f the in te rgove rnmen ta l f isca l architecture i s 
unclear, as i s the scope and d i rec t ion o f fu r the r decentralization. 

The decentralization program has been hampered by several factors. These i n c l u d e 

9. 
weak and ine f fec t ive l inkages be tween decentralization p o l i c y and other p u b l i c p o l i c y 
reforms; persistent p ow e r struggles and con f l ic ts o f ro les be tween elected o f f i c i a l s such as 

2 

Membe rs o f Parliament, counc i lo rs and t rad i t iona l authorities; weak ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty and 
high s t a f f turn over; ine f fec t ive pa r t ic ipa t ion o f l o c a l communities; and inadequate f inanc ia l 
resources. Since 2004, the democratic c r e d i b i l i t y o f the C i ty , Mun ic ipa l , T o w n and D i s t r i c t 
Assemblies has also been ca l led i n t o question f o l l ow i n g the abo l i t ion o f the elected 
Assemblies, 
the i r replacement b y appo in ted assemblies, the transfer o f the i r f inanc ia l 
expenditure powe rs to appointed D i s t r i c t Commissioners and the delay o f cons t i tu t iona l ly 
mandated l o c a l gove rnmen t elections in 2005. 
F ina l ly , the t ime tab le f o r l o c a l elections, 
scheduled t o take place in 2007, m a y b e at risk. Th is i s due to ins t i tu t iona l and capac i ty 
weaknesses and an eme rg ing cons t i tu t iona l c o n f l i c t o n the procedures f o r the appo in tmen t o f 
Comm iss ione rs to the M a l a w i E lec to ra l Comm iss ion (MEC ) . 

10. 

The new Government has made fighting corruption a key plank in its program, and 
has achieved results in tackling high-level graft. Perceived co r rup t ion in M a l a w i i s 

re la t ive ly be t te r than in mos t low - income countries in A f r ica . ’ Howeve r , several ind ica to rs 
measu r ing co r rup t ion in Ma law i deteriorated unde r the p rev ious government. F o r instance, 
Malawi’s i n d e x o n the con t ro l o f co r rup t ion measured by pe rcen t i le ranking dec l ined f i o m 
50.5 in 2000 t o 23.6 in 2004. Ove r the past t w o years, the A n t i -C o r r u p t i o n Bu reau ( AC B ) has 
launched several investigations o f high p r o f i l e persons in gove rnmen t as w e l l as in the 
opposition. These have l e d to arrests and convictions, w h i l e some cases are s t i l l in the courts.

POVERTY PROFILE AND PROGRESS TOWARDS THE MDGS 

11. 
Poverty continues to be widespread in Ma law i , and there has been virtually no 
progress in reducing poverty and inequality over the past decade. The recent M a l a w i 

Pove r ty and V u l n e r a b i l i t y Assessment (PVA) indicates that m o r e than 52 percent o f the 
popu la t ion (6.4 m i l l i o n people) l ives b e l ow the p o v e r t y l i n e and 22 percent (2.7 m i l l i o n 
people) 
i s living in ultra-poverty, such that they cannot a f f o r d to mee t even the i r 
recommended daily f o o d needs. There i s n o s ta t is t ica l ly s ign i f ican t d i f fe rence be tween these 
figures and those in 1998, w h e n 54.1 percent o f the popu la t ion was p o o r and 23.6 pe rcen t

BOX 1: PROGRESS TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

A t cu r ren t rates o f progress, M a l a w i i s l ike ly to achieve only three o f the in te rna t iona l targets set fo r 
the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopment Goads (MDGs) b y 2015. Ma law i i s we l l placed to reach G o a l 3 (to 
promote gender equality and empower women). Good progress has been made in achieving equal 
enrollment in primary education and in reducing the gender disparity in youth literacy. However, more 
needs to be done to reduce the gender gap in tertiary education, and to increase the participation o f women 
in the workforce and in positions o f authority. Advances have also been made towards G o a l 4 (to reduce 
ch i ld mortality), w i th under-five mor ta l i ty projected to decrease b y more than two-thirds, between 1990 and 
2015. Some progress has been made towards G o a l 6 (to combat H IV IA IDS , malaria and other diseases). 
Notably, Ma law i appears to have halted the spread o f H IV iA IDS , as adult prevalence ra tes seem to have 
stabilized at around 14 percent. However, accurate knowledge about H IV /A IDS transmission remains 
weak, and on ly l im i ted progress has been made in reducing r isky behaviors. Good progress has been made 
though increasing the proportion o f population using effective malaria prevention. 
However , achieving the other MDGs i s un l ike ly . Ma law i i s un l ike ly to m e e t G o a l 1 (to eradicate extreme 
poverty and hunger), as efforts have made l i t t l e impact on poverty and inequality over the past decade. 
Hunger i s persistent and over 50 percent o f children under five are stunted in their growth. Good progress 
has been made towards G o a l 2 (to achieve universal primary education) however about a quarter drop out 
before standard five and have no t achieved basic literacy and numeracy. Achieving G o a l 5 (to improve 
ma te rna l health) i s also unlikely; ma te rna l mor ta l i ty ac tua l ly increased between 1992 and 2000, and, while 
i t has recently started fa l l ing again, the current rate o f reduction w i l l not be s u f f i c i e n t to meet the M D G 
target b y 201 5 . Finally, the re has been m ixed progress towards G o a l 7 (to ensu re environmental 
sustainability). Deforestation i s continuing at an alarming rate, and the ma jor i ty o f the population s t i l l use 
so l id fue ls . On a positive note, the proportion o f people who have access to safe dr ink ing water and 
improved sanitation appears to have increased significantly.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT 

Recent Econom ic Developments 

14. Macroeconomic performance under the previous administration was mediocre, as a 
result of both weather shocks and very weak public expenditure management. Econom ic 

g r ow t h has been vo la t i le and weak over the past decade, with GDP g r ow t h averaging b e l ow 3 
percent (be low 2 percent since 2000). As annual popu la t ion g r ow t h has averaged above 2 
percent, th is corresponds t o a modest 1 percent increase in p e r cap i ta incomes ove r the past 
ten years. M u c h o f the p o o r economic pe r fo rmance has been the resu l t o f recu r ren t weather 
shocks o n smallholder ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion (F igu re 2), with an average annual g r ow t h rate 
o f 3 percent, w h i c h has fa l len to less than 1 percent o n average since the year 2000. The 
impac t o f erratic weather patterns has been compounded by high in f la t ion , and high (nom ina l 
and real) interest rates, la rge ly caused by p o o r p u b l i c expend i tu re management. In addition, 
con t inued depreciation o f the exchange ra te over the past decade has increased the cost o f k e y 
imports, such as fe r t i l ize r . 

The new Government took rapid steps to stabilize the fiscal situation and pursue 

15. 
sustainable macroeconomic policies. T h e n ew Gove rnmen t came i n t o o f f i c e in M a y 2004 
and has since en fo rced f isca l d isc ip l ine ; consequently mac roeconom ic pe r fo rmance has 
rapidly imp roved . As a result, the IMF and the new Gove rnmen t agreed o n a S ta f f M o n i t o r e d 
P rog ram (SMP) starting f r o m J u l y 1, 2004. 
F o l l o w i n g s t rong pe r fo rmance in the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the SMP, a n ew Pove r ty Reduc t ion and G r o w t h F a c i l i t y (PRGF) was 
approved in August 2005. Pe r fo rmance unde r the f i r s t year o f the PRGF p rog ram has been 
strong, and M a l a w i has already comp le ted the f i r s t and second reviews, in Feb rua ry and 
August 2006, respectively. The Gove rnmen t reached H I P C c om p l e t i o n p o i n t in August 2006.

However, there has been little noticeable diversification of the economy. Malawi’s 
economy remains based o n agriculture, w h i c h accounts f o r m o r e than 80 percent o f i ts expo r t 
earnings, contributes 38 percent o f gross domestic p r o d u c t (GDP), and supports 85 percent o f 
the popu la t ion . Smallholders make up about three quarters o f ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion and are 
m o s t l y engaged in ra in - fed ma ize p roduc t ion . T h e Performance o f the ag r icu l tu ra l sector 
during the past decade has been weak and highly erratic, with an average g r ow t h rate o f 3 
percent, w h i c h has fa l len t o less than 1 percent o n average since the year 2000. Th is sluggish 
g r ow t h reco rd i s mainly due to the impac t o f recu r ren t droughts, with the mos t recent b e i n g in 
2001 and 2005. Constrained by high r e a l interest rates (around 3 0 percent between 2001 and 
2003), the manu fac tu r ing sector has averaged zero g r ow t h ove r the past decade and accounts 
f o r o n l y 11 percent o f GDP . Manu fac tu r ing i s also inward-oriented, with o n l y 14 percent o f 
manu fac tu r ing ou tpu t exported. 

17. 
Exports remain heavily concentrated in a few sectors, 
leaving the economy 
vulnerable to fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices. Over recent years, Malawi’s 
expo r t pe r fo rmance has lagged b e h i n d the pe r fo rmance o f many other deve lop ing coun t r ies in 
the region. Desp i te b e i n g a re la t ive ly open economy and having non - rec ip roca l trade 
preferences w i th the EU and the US, exports g rew by o n l y 2 percent in M a l aw i in the past 10 
years (compared to 6.4 percent g r ow t h in w o r l d exports). 
In addition, trade remains highly 
dependent u p o n a l im i t e d range o f p r im a r y commod i t ies (ma in ly semi-processed tobacco, tea, 
and sugar), re f lec t ing l im i t e d success in pas t gove rnmen t po l ic ies t o d i v e r s i f y the expo r t base 
away f r o m primary p roduc ts Tobacco alone accounts f o r a round 6 0 percent o f exports. 
Constraints t o expo r t are p redom ina te ly o n the supp ly -s ide in respect t o trade po l ic ies ( t a r i f f 
and n o n - t a r i f f barriers, expo r t support services i n c l u d i n g assistance t o mee t phy to -san i ta ry

infrastructure, structural and sector policies). M a l a w i i s land locked and p o o r l y in teg ra ted i n t o

Medium-Term Prospects 

18. 

The medium-term outlook i s generally positive, provided that the Government9s 
macroeconomic program i s maintained and progress is made in insulating the economy 
against weather risk. The Government’s s tab i l iza t ion p rog ram p rov ides a good basis f o r

percent in the m e d i um t e rm (in l i n e with the reg iona l long - te rm average). Th is p r o j e c t i o n 
a l lows f o r ou tpu t to recover f r o m a p ro longed p e r i o d o f p o o r performance, and assumes that 
measures are imp lemen ted t o insulate the economy from the deb i l i ta t ing impac t o f pe r iod ic

average g r ow t h rate o f abou t 3 percent achieved be tween 1996 and 2005. 

19. While in the medium- to long-term sectors such as mining and tourism may hold 
potential, in the short-term growth in Ma law i w i l l need to come from 
increasing 
agricultural productivity. A g r i c u l t u r e emp loys a lmos t 80 percent o f the popu la t ion , and m o s t

reduction. As a resu l t o f the p rev ious government’s fa i lu re t o c o n t r o l spending, pa r t icu la r ly 
since 2001/02, M a l a w i accumulated a dangerously la rge stock o f domestic debt. This deb t 
threatened macroeconomic and f inanc ia l stability, and with ove r 3 0 percent o f gove rnmen t 
expenditure consumed by interest paymen ts in 2004/05, c rowded ou t spending o n soc ia l 
services and investment. Further, gove rnmen t b o r r ow i n g pushed up interest rates, making 
c red i t p r o h i b i t i v e l y expensive f o r the poo r , thus con t r ibu t ing to p o o r econom ic pe r fo rmance 
and stagnating rates o f pove r ty . 

23. 

Hav ing inherited this potentially unsustainable domestic debt spiral, the new 
Government has managed to reverse the trend, but the situation remains precarious. 

H a v i n g peaked at 25 pe rcen t o f GDP in 2003/04, domestic debt i s estimated to have dec l ined

BANK ANALYSIS OF THE MGDS 

28. 

Th e JSAN concludes that the MGDS broadly provides a comprehensive framework 
for growth andpoverty reduction in M a l a w i The M G D S assumes that g r ow t h w i l l average 6 
percent ove r the med ium - te rm , w h i c h i s high compared b o t h t o M a l aw i ’ s pas t pe r fo rmance 
and to anticipated g r ow t h in the reg ion . In s t a f f s ’ v iew , this g r ow t h i s feasible because 
M a l aw i ’ s p o o r performance ove r the past decade p rov ides some scope f o r ca tch ing up. 
Howeve r , this g r ow t h i s n o t assured: i t also depends o n the Government’s con t inued 
comm i tmen t t o sound mac roeconom ic management, 
the imp lemen ta t ion o f p r o - g r ow t h 
measures iden t i f ied in the MGD S , and e f fec t ive links between ac t iv i t ies f o r deve lop ing an 
enab l ing env i ronmen t f o r p r iva te sector l e d g r ow t h and the ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk tha t i s 
essential t o such an env i ronmen t . I t also cautions that chang ing econom ic circumstances and 
opportunities w i l l necessitate that the government m o n i t o r and act respons ive ly t o the 
chang ing needs o f the p r iva te sector. 

29 . 

Th e JSAN also notes that the MGDS could have benefited from a discussion of the 
risks to macroeconomic performance that could undermine its implementation. M a l a w i 
remains vulnerable t o a numbe r o f exogenous shocks to growth, i n c l u d i n g d rough t and a 
de te r io ra t ion in the terms o f trade. Imp lemen ta t ion o f the M G D S c o u l d s t ra in M a l aw i ’ s 
l im i t e d adm in is t ra t ive capacity and risk d ive r t ing a t ten t ion f r o m core mac roeconom ic 
p r io r i t ies . Unce r ta in and vo la t i le a i d f l ow s are po ten t ia l ly d is rup t ive and w i l l need t o b e 
ca re fu l ly managed. 

30. 

F o r growth to be sustained, it w i l l also need to be shared. The p r i m a r y focus o f the 
M G D S i s o n measures t o spur p roduc t ive ac t iv i t ies in economic sectors. Howeve r , staffs are 
concerned that i t underplays the r o l e o f soc ia l expenditures and soc ia l p ro tec t ion in suppo r t ing 
g row th . 
In countries such as M a l a w i whe re a shortage o f s k i l l e d manpowe r i s a r e a l 
constraint t o growth, spending o n soc ia l sectors can p l a y a c r i t i c a l suppo r t ive ro le . The J S A N 
notes that this w i l l requ i re in teg ra t ing voca t iona l t ra in ing and entrepreneurship i n t o the f o rm a l 
education system and imp lemen t ing change management re fo rms in o rde r t o im p r o v e the 
education sector’s absorptive capacity. 
I t also notes that m o r e sustainable so lu t ions b e 
considered f o r retaining k e y f ron t l ine s t a f f in the hea l th sector. 

31. 

Successful 
implementation of 
the strategy w i l l depend on a number of 
considerations being taken on board. P r io r i t ies w i l l need t o b e fu r the r de f ined within the 
context o f resource constraints. In addition, the a b i l i t y t o de l ive r the expected results in the 
M G D S m a y be l im i t e d by the “real” resources ava i lab le t o M a l aw i . W h i l e M a l a w i bene f i ted

o n ne t f l ow s has been modest o n account o f o f fse t t ing reduc t ions in gross f lows . Further, the 
strategy needs to be m o r e c lea r ly l i n k e d t o the budge t and a system needs t o b e put in p lace t o 
ensure that the budge t i s indeed an ins t rumen t f o r i t s imp lemen ta t ion . P o l i c y re fo rms t o 
emanate f r o m the strategy w i l l need t o b e evidence based and in f ras t ruc tu re expend i tu re 
choices made after due consideration o f alternative options. In order t o ensure tha t the 

10 

authorities are able t o p rope r ly assess progress towards the end p e r i o d targets, there w i l l b e 
need t o have annual targets that can b e rea l is t ica l ly mon i to red . 

32. 
Additional analytical work i s necessary to achieve MGDS objectives. The JSAN 
recognizes that know ledge gaps s t i l l ex is t in a numbe r o f areas: 
G r ow t h diagnostics, focused o n the scope f o r expansion in high g r ow t h sectors and the

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

A. 

i 

KEY DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

Pervasive Risk 

36. 
Ma law i faces widespread risks and uncertainty at the national and household level. 
The 2004 Coun t ry Econom ic M em o r a n d um (CEM ) iden t i f ies the high l e v e l o f risk fac ing 
households and k e y economic p laye rs as the main reason f o r pe rs is ten t ly s low g r ow t h in 
Ma law i . Pervasive risk has also been i d e n t i f i e d in the 2006 PVA as a m a j o r cause o f 
persistent pove r ty in M a l aw i . The three main sources o f risk are: (i) mac roeconom ic 
instability; (ii) f o o d insecu r i ty caused by weather-related shocks to ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion 
and p o o r l y func t ion ing ag r icu l tu ra l markets; and (iii) i l lness o r death, especially f r o m 
H I V / A I D S . Such a risky env i ronmen t creates a pove r ty trap in w h i c h the p o o r s t ick t o l o w - 
risk, low - re tu rn subsistence ac t iv i ty , w h i l e actual shocks, w h e n they happen, push the 
ma rg ina l non-poor back i n t o pove r ty . 

37. Macroeconomic uncertainty undermines growth and poverty reduction. Weak 
p o l i c y performance in the pas t has damaged the economy and depressed p r iva te sector 
investment. Poor f isca l management be tween 2000/0 1 and 2003/04 l e d to substantial domestic 
bo r row ing , w h i c h pushed up interest rates and made b o r r ow i n g una f fo rdab le f o r sma l l farmers 
and businesses. Mone ta ry f inanc ing increased i n f l a t i o n and exchange ra te vo la t i l i ty , w h i c h 
resulted in unpredictable p r ices f o r inputs and outputs f o r farmers and businessmen.’ High 
interest rates ( la rge ly driven by gove rnmen t b o r r ow i n g o n the domestic m o n e y markets) 
c rowded ou t p r iva te sector bo r row ing , and therefore investment. Furthermore, h a v i n g taken 
o n large amounts o f debt, a substantial p r o p o r t i o n o f gove rnmen t spending was d ive r ted t o 
debt service payments, 
lead ing to reduced p u b l i c inves tmen t in human cap i ta l and 
infrastructure. W h i l e the n ew gove rnmen t has managed t o s tab i l ize the situation, interest rates 
and i n f l a t i o n rema in high at 25 pe rcen t and 17 percent respec t ive ly a t end 2005, a l though they 
have begun too f a l l th rough 2006. Con t inued f isca l d isc ip l ine w i l l be requ i red t o bring these 
d ow n t o levels conduc ive t o p r iva te sector growth. In addition, M a l aw i ’ s p ro jec ted fo re ign 
exchange reserve cover i s s t i l l r e l a t i v e l y l o w and the economy rema ins vu lne rab le t o b o t h 
domestic and external shocks. 

38. Macroeconomic stability hinges on successfully managing key fiscal vulnerabilities. 
F isca l r i s k s inc lude a h i s t o r y o f p o o r management o f the pay ro l l . Pens ion ou t lays c o u l d also 
turn ou t t o b e h ighe r i f the demog raph ic assumptions u n d e r l y i n g the cu r ren t re fo rms turn ou t 
to b e incorrect. To reduce these r isks , the gove rnmen t w i l l need t o con t inue strengthening 
p a y r o l l management, in particular, ensu r ing that the c i v i l service database remains up-to-date, 
and im p r o v e the comp i la t ion o f data re la ted t o cu r ren t and h t u r e retirees and deaths. 
Po ten t ia l contingent l iab i l i t ies t o the budge t also need to b e managed by ensu r ing p rope r 
governance in the adm in is t ra t ion o f A g r i c u l t u r a l Deve lopmen t and M a r k e t i n g Co rpo ra t ion 
(ADMARC ) , N a t i o n a l F o o d Reserve A g e n c y (NFRA), M a l a w i Rural Deve lopmen t Fund 
(MARDEF), and other k e y parastatals. 

In the recent Investment Climate Survey, over 70 percent o f managers considered macroeconomic instability 
to be a primary constraint to doing business.

Chronic food insecurity harms growth and productivity and perpetuates poverty. 

Ch ron ic f o o d insecu r i ty continues t o sap the nation’s energy t o achieve s ign i f ican t econom ic 
growth, h inde rs the n u t r i t i o n a l deve lopmen t o f the population, and requires emergency 
responses that deplete l im i t e d f isca l resources. 
In addition, they push peop le back i n t o 
poverty, f o r example w h e n households are fo rced t o se l l p roduc t ive assets, such as f a rm tools, 
to buy food, thereby f rus t ra t ing e f fo r ts t o increase p roduc t iv i ty . The unce r ta in ty and r i s k 
associated with d ive rs i f ica t ion and cash crops also constrains p roduc t iv i ty , as farmers s t ick t o 
low - r isk , l ow - r e t u r n p roduc t ion o f staple f o o d crops. Further, reduc ing M a l aw i ’ s v u l n e r a b i l i t y

p roduc t iv i ty , but also because the substantial mac roeconom ic impac ts o f weather shocks 
con t r ibu te t o unde rm ine macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . 

40. 

H i g h vulnerability to recurrent drought results in chronic food insecurity a t the 

household level. The m o s t severe shocks reported by households are d rough th loods and f o o d 
p r i c e vo la t i l i ty , p a r t i a l l y re f lec t ing consequences o f c l ima te risk. Households are acu te ly 
vu lne rab le to r a i n fa i lu re and other weather shocks. Mo reove r , o w i n g t o pove r ty , l o w leve ls

households cannot p roduce o r buy su f f ic ien t f o o d even in good p roduc t ion years. L i m i t e d 
access t o storage and the pressing need f o r cash resu l t in farmers se l l ing a p a r t o f the i r c rop 
immed ia te ly after the harvest, w h e n p r ices are l ow . M a n y farmers are then fo rced t o buy 
ma ize later in the year w h e n p r ices are high.7 A substantial p o r t i o n o f the popu la t ion i s

translates i n t o a l a c k o f househo ld resources to purchase food, m a k i n g f o o d insecu r i ty an 
endu r ing cond i t ion f o r an ove rwhe lm ing numbe r o f Ma law ians . 

4 1. 
L im i ted and poorly functioning markets keep ag r icu l tu ra l productivity low and 
prevent farmers from getting the best price for their produce. Ma rke ts f o r k e y ag r icu l tu ra l 

inputs such as fe r t i l ize r and hybrid seeds w o r k p o o r l y whe re they ex is t and d o n o t ex is t at a l l 
in m a n y areas. Farmers therefore have l im i t e d access t o inputs with inadequate ag r icu l tu ra l 
extension (bo th f o r f a rm techniques and i n f o rm a t i o n about markets) and thus p r o d u c t i v i t y 
remains l ow . Successive governments have imp lemen ted schemes to address this a n d 
increase fe r t i l ize r use, but these have o f ten set back p r iva te sector deve lopmen t in th is sector. 
Gove rnmen t in te rven t ions are also a p rob lem , f o r example, this year’s setting o f minimum 
p r ices f o r tobacco has damaged ma rke t confidence. The recent P V A notes that markets whe re 
the Gove rnmen t does n o t intervene, such as rice, beans a n d groundnuts, are m o r e e f f i c i e n t 
than the ma ize market, w h i c h i s in f luenced by the p r i c i n g p o l i c y and expo r t res t r ic t ions o f 
A D M A R C (A g r i c u l t u r a l Deve lopmen t and M a r k e t i n g Corporation). Output markets f o r 
ag r icu l tu ra l p roduce are s im i l a r l y scarce and under-developed. M a r k e t deve lopmen t i s 
constrained by the un re l iab le and l im i t e d p r o v i s i o n o f co re in f ras t ruc tu re (e lec t r ic i ty , 
telecommunications, water) and the high cost o r l a c k o f transport, w h i c h impede the f l o w o f 
p roduce a round the coun t ry f r o m areas o f p len ty t o areas o f shortage. 

As a r e s u l t o f rapid population growth, the average landholding size i s very small, at on ly 1.2 hectaredfamily. 
The PVA indicates that home production i s a significant por t ion o f total food consumption; however more than 
h a l f o f the r u r a l population runs out o f own-produced maize (the main staple crop) six to eight months before the 
next harvest.

Weak Institutional Capacity 

52. 

The delivery of public services suffers from a shortage of skilled personnel, and 
limited institutional capacity and accountability at a l l levels of government. M a l a w i faces 

severe h um a n resource constraints in a numbe r o f k e y sectors, i n c l u d i n g health, education, the 
f inanc ia l (accounting, procurement, f inanc ia l services) and lega l professions. T h i s i s due in 
pa r t t o the i n a b i l i t y o f the post-secondary education system t o educate su f f ic ien t graduates and 
has been exacerbated by the im p a c t o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic. Weak ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty 
in the c i v i l service at b o t h na t iona l and l o c a l levels o f gove rnmen t seriously unde rm ines 
government’s capacity t o develop evidence-based strategies, manage resources e f fec t ive ly , 
imp lemen t r e f o rm and translate increased expenditure i n t o imp rovemen ts in the q u a l i t y and 
reach o f p u b l i c services. 
The 2006 IEG C A E notes that reasons f o r p o o r pe r fo rmance o f the c i v i l service i n c l u d e a 
fa i lu re t o deal with incentives f o r the c i v i l service i n c l u d i n g l o w pay, l a c k o f s k i l l s , and 
p o o r enforcement o f standards o f performance. This i s compounded by a y o u n g 
democracy and an inhe r i ted patronage system. 
Desp i te strengthening f isca l discipline, budge t con t ro l and accoun tab i l i ty in p u b l i c 
finances over the past tw o years, f inanc ia l management capacity rema ins a substantial 
p rob lem . Weak capacity also constrains the a l ignmen t and management o f in te rna t iona l 
development assistance (w h i c h finances 4 0 percent o f the gove rnmen t budget). This i s 
compounded by the need t o imp lemen t e f fec t ive establishment and p a y r o l l con t ro ls a n d to 
remove perverse incentives t o seek non-salary remune ra t ion th rough t ra in ing and o the r 
non-service de l ive ry activities. 
W h i l e M a l a w i has embarked o n many re fo rms in p u b l i c expenditure management, the 
linkages between planning, budgeting, p u b l i c expenditure, m o n i t o r i n g and the p o l i c y 
development and rev iew processes are also weak. 
M a l a w i has an appropriate su rvey p r o g r am f o r measu r ing we l fa re and living standards at 
the impac t level-including 
the MDGs-and 
f o r t rack ing trends over t ime . Howeve r , the 
na t iona l survey p rog ram i s fragile, and over-dependent o n ex te rna l funding and techn ica l 
assistance. The 2006 P V A notes tha t the p o l i t i c a l env i ronmen t f o r m o n i t o r i n g and 
eva lua t ion has imp roved recently, but tha t the ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk and m o n i t o r i n g 
systems are s t i l l weak. The l a c k o f adequate i n f o rm a t i o n h inde rs the a b i l i t y o f c i v i l society 
t o m a k e demands o n the system and thus re in fo rce accoun tab i l i ty . 
At the l o c a l l e v e l there are ine f fec t ive l inkages be tween the decentralization p o l i c y and 
na t iona l p u b l i c p o l i c y re fo rms . P lann ing and operational links be tween cen t ra l and l o c a l 
gove rnmen t are weak, especially the f isca l architecture. Weak p u b l i c management

capacity, l o w access t o resources and l o w levels o f c i v i l society and p r iva te sector vo ice at 
l o c a l gove rnmen t and in ministries, 
i s a serious challenge t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
N a t i o n a l Decen t ra l iza t ion P rog ram and the M G D S . Greater co l labo ra t ion be tween the

Box 2: LESSONS FROM PAST BANK ASSISTANCE 

S i n c e FY96, the Bank has provided about $850 m i l l ion to Ma law i and produced a number o f analytical 
products. These efforts have supported various reforms in macroeconomic stability, private sector growth, 
human resource development, and public sector management. W h i l e many o f the efforts b y Government and 
development partners have been positive, they have no t translated in to sustainable reductions in poverty or food 
insecurity. The Independent Evaluation Group’s Country Ass is tance Evaluation (covering 1995-2005) and CAS 
Completion Report (covering 2003-2006) both concluded that wh i le past strategies have been relevant to the 
development challenges facing Ma law i , the performance o f the Wo r ld Bank programs in Ma law i has produced 
l im i ted resu l ts . The CAE suggested that operations had been over-designed for the implementation 
environment, coordination w i th other development partners was limited, and that h igh quality analytical work 
was often not sufficiently disseminated to ensure resu l ts . Other findings o f the CAE included: 
L a b o r intensive a n d broad-based g r ow t h has been elusive. T h e Bank has no t been heavily invo lved in 
agr icu l tura l productivity, and has had l im i ted impact on food security or m i t iga t ing the r i s k o f weather- 
related shocks. 
P u b l i c serv ice de l ivery a n d s o c i a l p ro tec t ion have seen m ixed trends. Bank support was most effective in 
sector-wide programs. 
Macroeconom ic s tab i l i ty a n d p u b l i c sector reform have p r o v e n d f j c u l t ove r the p a s t 1 0 years . Capacity 
bu i ld ing efforts have no t resulted in sustained capacity development or institutional change. 
Lessons Learned . 
The main lessons from the previous CAS can be broken down in to four interrelated 
themes: (i) selectivity and realism, (ii) partnership, (iii) programmatic, integrated approaches, and (iv) 
understanding po l i t ica l and institutional dynamics. 
(i) Selectivity and realism. Past assistance strategies and evaluations have repeatedly stressed the need for 
increased selectivity and more r e a l i s t i c design, given the capacity constraints. However, being selective has 
proven d i f f icu l t for both the Government and donors; due in part to the d i f f icu l ty in pr ior i t iz ing Malawi’s 
extensive economic and social needs. The CAE notes that each successive CAS acknowledged that the previous 
CAS had been too ambitious and non-selective, bu t then failed to specify what wou ld be eliminated. 
(ii) Partnership -A l ignmen t and Harmonization. There has been l im i ted attempts to define the comparative 
advantage o f the Bank against other development partners, and thus to determine the most effective allocation o f 
resources to support Government priorities. In addition, there was no concerted effort to improve harmonization 
and coordination w i th development partners. 
(iii) Programmatic, integrated approach. The CASCR, QAG Country Lending Assessmen t and LEG CAE a l l 
noted the need to bu i ld a more integrated approach to investments and analytical and advisory services. W h i l e 
ana ly t ica l work was h igh quality, i n s u f f i c i e n t attention was pa id to i t s dissemination or u s e in po l icy decision- 
making. 
(iv) Understanding the underlying po l it ica l and institutional dynamics. Evaluations and reviews o f specific 
Bank interventions have indicated the importance o f understanding the impact o f po l i t ica l and institutional 
dynamics on project operations and outcomes. 

62. 
The Bank will continue to support strong policy implementation with Development 
Policy credits and w i l l seek t o fu l ly j o i n the C A B S group12 as a mechan ism t o fu r the r 
integrate p o l i c y d ia logue with that o f other k e y development partners. The proposed p r o g r am 
w o u l d see a gradual scale up o f resources p rov ided th rough p o l i c y credits, assuming

Box 3: MA INSTREAM ING GOVERNANCE WORK IN A L L SECTORS AND 
CAPAC ITY DEVELOPMENT 

The CAS proposes a three-pronged approach to strengthening capacity. First, in l i n e w i th the Afi-ica 
Region’s Management Ac t ion Plan on Capacity Development (ARMAP’), the Bank w i l l focus i t s 
financial resources on strengthening the capacity o f Government to manage the economy and improve 
expenditure management and transparency and bo th the central and decentralized levels. In numerous 
areas in which the Bank i s supporting SWAps the Bank w i l l seek to ensure that capacity development 
forms an integral part o f sector programs. Second, capacity and institutional constraints w i l l be 
addressed b y Bank activities in each o f the outcome areas, particularly through inc lud ing analyses o f 
the po l i t ica l and institutional dynamics o f Bank supported interventions in the project cycle. The Bank 
Group w i l l seek to ensure that capacity development i s an objective o f a l l activities. W B I w i l l launch 
the Country Focus Capacity Bu i ld ing program for Ma law i that has been specifically designed to 
support the planned I D A program. Finally, efforts to improve donor coordination and aid effectiveness 
w i l l be a central feature o f a l l Bank efforts. Careful attention w i l l be given to addressing the sector- 
a n d agency-specific (as w e l l as cross-cutting) incentives that shape the performance o f each o f the key 
p u b l i c 
agencies responsible for helping achieve each o f the outcomes in the CAS. CAS 
implementation (both in upstream A A A and in project design) w i l l involve attention to the incentives - 
in a context o f and in response to repeated earlier generations o f implementation problems. Analytical 
work in the CAS w i l l help in form the specific issues in agencies.

Th e AAA p rog ram is closely linked with p lanned f inanc ia l support and accounts for 

political economy realties. The C A S includes a p r o g r am o f AAA designed t o address

p o l i t i c a l economy o f re fo rms and address governance constraints in the sectors and thema t ic 
areas covered.

Annex 2 - M a l aw i CAS Completion Report 

Date o f CAS: M a y 14,2003 
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: M a y 2003 - April 2006 
Date o f CASCR: May , 200618 

I. Introduction 

1. Th is Coun try Assistance Strategy Comp le t ion Report (CASCR) i s the country team’s self-assessment 
o f the effectiveness o f the 2003 C A S in ach iev ing i ts intended results in Ma law i . I t h igh l igh ts lessons 
learned f r om the Bank’s program o f support, relevance o f the CAS to Ma law i ’s development objectives, 
the Bank’s responsiveness to Ma law i ’s po l i t ica l and economic environment, and the ove ra l l performance 
o f the Bank during C A S implementation. 
I t uses the C A S results f ramewo rk to assess the results 
achieved against each o f the expected C A S outcomes b y trackmg the key indicators and milestones l a i d 
out in the CAS , although measurement o f results was d i f f icu l t because o f lack o f data o n the indicators, 
especially at the CAS outcome level. 

2. Consultations. In prepar ing the CASCR , the Bank’s country team consulted with t h e Government 
and donor partners. The process was launched in January 2005 at the M a l a w i Coun try Program Review, 
when Government o f f ic ia ls f r om a l l l i n e m i n i s t r i e s were invo lved in discussions o f the relevance and 
effectiveness o f the B a n k program. 
The CASCR also bene f i ted f r om in terv iews w i t h key 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Ma law i , and Bank staff; and the findings were further 
in fo rmed b y key in terna l documents, such as the Coun try Program Assessment (May 2005) prepared the 
Bank ’s Qua l i ty Assurance Group (QAG), assessments b y the Independent Eva lua t ion Group (IEG, 
fo rme r ly OED) including the 2006 Coun try Assistance Evaluation, and f ina l ly various external reviews o f 
Ma law i ’s economic and social performance over the last f ive years. 

3. Summary of Ratings. While p rog ram performance and Bank performance are starting to show s i g n s 
o f improvement, this has occurred late in the C A S cycle. The ra t ing fo r ove ra l l p rog ram performance f o r 
the entire C A S pe r iod i s moderately unsatisfactory. W h i l e the C A S was evaluated as relevant to 
addressing the key development constraints fac ing M a l a w i and was consistent with the directions o f the 
previous C A S (1 998 , and the 2000 C A S progress report), i t did n o t achieve several o f the expected C A S 
outcomes. The overa l l ra t ing i s der ived f r om a weighted average o f ratings fo r each o f the expected C A S 
outcomes that were de f ined in the results framework o f the 2003 C A S (Table 1). The ra t ing fo r B a n k 
Performance was also moderately unsutisfuctory, re f lec t ing shortcomings in design and supervision in the 
various outcome areas. 

11. Country Context at the design o f the 2003 CAS 

4. 
In 2003, despite the e f for ts o f the Government and development partners, M a l a w i had experienced 
h a l f a decade o f high in f la t ion , l o w and even negative annual per capita grow th , and substantial 
fluctuations in the g row th o f p r ima ry exports - especially tobacco. W i t h ine f f ic ien t f isca l management 
and a po l i t ica l ly weak adm in is tra t ion in powe r fo r most o f the CAS, the young democracy faced a 
cha l leng ing environment in wh ich to undertake needed structural  reform^'^. Stagnating agr icu l tura l 

Th is CAS Completion Report was prepared b y t h e M a l a w i Country team, l e d b y Elizabeth M. White. Core team members were Ozan Sev im i l i , 
Patricia Rogers, and Jack van Ho ls t Pellekaan. The country team p rov ided significant input to t h e CASCR, the indicators, ratings, and lessons 
leamed. Peer reviewers were Rosalia Rodriguez Garcia and Pedro Arizti. 
l 9 Structural reforms implemented in several sectors had imp roved the business environment, but there were also delays: fo r example, 
monopolies or oligopolies continued to operate in many large industries (sugar, cement, petroleum retailing, tobacco auctioning, and 
transportation), and many small and medium-size enterpnses continued to operate in protected environments that do no t necessarily promote 
Malawi’s long - te rm competitive advantage. 

43 

produc t iv i ty , l o w levels o f pr iva te sector investment, supply-side issues in specific industries and 
subsectors, and high transaction costs fo r exports and impor ts resulted in reduced trade opportunities, and 
l o w economic g row th lead ing to continued widespread pover ty . The effects o f these factors, coupled with 
high levels o f H I V / A I D S , were food insecurity, deteriorating social services, and dec l in ing social 
indicators. 

5 . Dono r Assistance. In 2003, M a l a w i received US$497.9 m i l l i o n in o f f ic ia l development assistance, 
wh ich equaled almost 12 percent o f GDP and about 40 percent o f to ta l Government expenditures. The 
ma jor donors-the European Un ion , W o r l d Bank, Un i ted K ingdom , Canada, Germany, Japan, No rway , 
Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States-supported a var ie ty o f sectors inc lud ing agriculture, 
education, environment, finance, health, H I V / A ID s , and infrastructure. M o s t donor support was p rov ided 
through grants, projects, o r technical assistance, with fou r key donors (the European Un ion , Norway , 
Sweden, and the United K ingdom ) takmg a Common Approach to Budge t Support (CABS) b y p o o l i n g 
balance-of-payments resources. 

6. Concerns about Ma law i ’s Performance. Because o f weak imp lemen ta t ion o f the macroeconomic 
program supported b y an IMF PRGF and governance concerns, the fou r ma jor b i la te ra l donors suspended 
balance-of-payments support to M a l a w i in December 200 1. Denma rk subsequently decided to end i ts 
program in Ma law i . Because o f setbacks in imp lemen t ing the re fo rm agenda, repeated delays in the f i r s t 
rev iew o f the PRGF supported program, , and questions about the progress o f the M a l a w i Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy (MPRS) 2o t h e Bank’s assistance p rog ram fo r M a l a w i was in a low-case scenario 
when the 2003 CAS was being designed. These circumstances l e d the 2003 C A S to conclude that 
“business as usual” w o u l d no t achieve the needed results, and a fresh approach was required. 

6. T h e M a l a w i Poverty Reduction Strategv. The MPRS, launched in April 2002, was b u i l t around fou r 
strategic p i l lars : (a) sustainable pro-poor economic growth, (b) human cap i ta l development, (c) imp roved 
qua l i ty o f l i f e fo r the mos t vulnerable, and (d) good governance; and i t also featured a number o f cross- 
cu t t ing themes. In each o f the p i l la rs there were long- term goals and objectives related to sub-themes. 
The MPRS was consistent w i t h the p o l i c y frameworks o f the 1990s that emphasized g row th with equ i ty 
and sought to achieve the goals in V is ion 2020, and also a imed at ach iev ing such in terna t iona l 
commitments as the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs ) .~~ 

7. Targets. Recogn iz ing that achieving many o f Ma law i ’s MDGs was un l ike ly , the MPRS established 
three-year targets fo r 2005 that were l e s s ambitious, but more rea l is t ic in the M a l a w i context, than the 
international targets fo r the MDGs. As the Jo in t S t a f f Assessment o f the MPRS b y the IMF and t h e

W o r l d Bank22 noted, the lowe r targets in the MPRS meant that i t was l i k e l y that the u l t ima te r e s u l t s in 
2015 w o u l d f a l l short o f the in terna t iona l MDG targets. However, a more serious deficiency was that the 
MPRS was no t adequately l inked to the na t iona l budget. Nevertheless, the Bank ’s 2003 C A S p rog ram 
was a l igned to the MPRS targets fo r some o f the core MDGs, wh ich are shown in Table 1.

The 2003 Country Assistance Strategy 

8. The 2003 C A S was no t on ly a l igned to the goals and pr ior i t ies o f the Government’s MPRS o f 2002, 
i t s design was also in f luenced b y the 2000 Report to the Boa rd in 2000 on the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
previous CAS .23 The new CAS sought to be responsive to the country’s economic problems and to 
changes in the po l i t ica l environment. I t was envisaged as a trans i t iona l program to help t h e Government 
move f r om a re la t ive ly reactive and d is jo in ted development p rog ram that was already overstretching 
capacities, to a more proactive, focused, and integrated p rog ram that w o u l d address key constraints to 
g row th and pover ty reduc t ion and urgent development i s s u e s in Ma law i . In particular, the C A S a imed at 
imp rov ing the se lec t iv i ty o f the Bank’s assistance p rog ram and increasing the focus o n results.

9. 
Increased Strategic Selectivity. The 1998 CAS, the 2000 C A E prepared b y JEG, and the 2000 C A S 
Progress Repor t a l l stressed the need fo r selectivity. Due to t h e range o f Ma law i ’s economic and soc ia l 
problems, being selective was d i f f icu l t fo r bo th the Government and donors; every th ing became a 
p r io r i ty . Choices needed to be made between pro-poor economic po l ic ies wh ich w o u l d require v is ion and 
po l i t ica l courage. The 2003 C A S made an e f fo r t to iden t i fy p r io r i ty pover ty reduc t ion programs. 
de f ined the pr ior i t ies as fo l lows : 
Imp lemen t core reforms to achieve macroeconomic stability, imp rove public expenditure 
management, and establish a basis fo r sustainable pover ty-reduc ing growth. 
Strengthen cruc ia l human development interventions that wou ld achieve results on the ground even in 
a low-case Bank lend ing scenario. 
Des ign interventions that wou ld lead to pover ty reduc t ion in the medium and l o n g te rm ( fo r example, 
creating an attractive investment c l ima te fo r increased employment) rather than short-term pove r ty - 
reduc ing interventions ( fo r example, safety ne ts ) that are probab ly unsustainable. 
Imp rove harmon iza t ion o f development assistance among donors to improve imp lemen ta t ion o f 
assistance programs.

10. ThemesPillars o f the 2003 CAS. The Bank designed the 2003 C A S around three themes o r p i l lars , 
wh ich were reflected in the results framework o f the CAS : 

0 Strengthening economic management and accountability. Expected outcomes: (a) imp roved pub l ic 

expenditure management, and (b) imp roved parastatal effectiveness. 

0 Establishing a platform for 

(a) mo re 
compe t i t ive business environment; (b) imp roved agr icu l tura l p roduc t iv i ty and revenue; and (c)

11. Alignment to Ma law i ’s Goals. Within each p i l lar , the 2003 CAS a l igned B a n k assistance to 
Ma law i ’s development goals as set ou t in the MPRS . I t then de f ined expected outcomes to be achieved 
in the CAS pe r iod (FY04-FY06) that w o u l d be d irec t ly in f luenced by the Bank ’s interventions. W h i l e 
the scope o f the program was s t i l l qu i te broad, selectivity was expected to be achieved through the choice 
o f ac t iv i t ies that wou ld be de l ivered f r om within the broad p rog ram (such as pub l ic expenditure 
management in the hea l th sector). 

IV . Assessment o f the 2003 CAS Imp lemen ta t ion 

12. The overa l l p rog ram performance o f the CAS i s rated moderately unsatisfactory. The CAS was 
relevant to addressing the key development constraints fac ing M a l a w i and consistent w i t h the directions 
o f the previous CAS (1998, and 2000 progress report). The overa l l ra t ing i s b roken d ow n in to a ra t ing fo r 
each o f the CAS outcomes that were de f ined in the r e s u l t s framework o f the 2003 CAS (Table 2). 
addition, the ra t ing for Bank Performance was also moderately unsatisfactory, re f lec t ing shortcomings in 
design and supervision in the various outcome areas. Towa rd the end o f the CAS b o t h Bdnk performance 
and program performance were beg inn ing to improve . The remainder o f this section prov ides a summary 
o f development objectives to wh ich the CAS was con tr ibu t ing as well as an ove rv iew o f the lessons 
learned f r om CAS design and implementation. Th is i s fo l lowed b y an assessment and lessons learned fo r 
each o f the CAS outcomes, which were d i rec t ly in f luenced b y the Bank’s p rog ram o f support.

13. Pove r ty has not changed s ign if icant ly in M a l aw i . A comprehensive rev iew o f the MPRS was 
completed in December 2005 and comp le t ion o f the second Integrated Househo ld Survey (2005) showed 
that pover ty had no t changed s ign i f ican t ly over t h e past seven years. The poo r s t i l l have poo r 
socioeconomic indicators, with food security a con t inu ing threat to nu t r i t ion and a better l i fe . The poor 
s t i l l have d i f f icu l ty ga in ing pa id emp loymen t (though employment statistics are weak), and M a l a w i has

pover ty rates among female headed households, especially in ru ra l areas. (see annex fo r pove r ty 
estimates) Shocks (economic and other), continue to threaten households b y keeping the poor in pover ty , 
and fo r the marg ina l non-poor, pushing them in to pover ty . M o s t households have experienced at least one 
economic shock in the past f ive years, and such short-term crises can lead to dep le t ion o f household assets 
and long - te rm negative effects. Women are more vulnerable than men to economic shocks and ind ica tors 
continue to show s ign i f ican t differences in access to basic services and employment. In addition, women 
have a larger w o r k burden than men, w i t h a considerable share o f the time spent on domestic ac t iv i t ies fo r 
heavy tasks as co l lec t ing water and firewood. 

14. Despite efforts in the MPRS and the earlier Malawi Economic Growth Strategy (MEGS), 
trends show that more needs to be done to stimulate growth and diversification of the economy. 

M a l a w i has experienced f luc tua t ing but generally l o w g row th rates averaging around three percent per 
annum over the last decade, ma in ly because o f the economy’s dependence o n the agr icu l tura l sector.24 
These lowe r than expected g row th rates, coupled with a popu la t ion g row th rate o f nearly 2 percent per 
year, resulted in a decline in per capita income and consumption. In addition, marke t uncer ta in ty and 
s low g row th in demand have resulted in a defensive response f r om loca l farmers and businessmen. 
Because o f uncertainty, many have opted fo r personal and business security as opposed to aggressive 
par t ic ipa t ion in markets where they m igh t achieve higher p roduc t iv i ty and incomes. Th is has resu l ted in 
many fa rm households undertalung low -va lue subsistence farming, manu fac tur ing firms scaling d ow n 
activities, and a less active f inanc ia l sector that has u s e d i t s resources in l e s s r i s k y government paper 
rather than aggressively engaging in bus iness lending.25 In this l o w leve l equilibrium the economy was 
vulnerable to external factors such as drought and other na tura l disasters; l im i t e d cost-effective access to 
domestic, regional, and in terna t iona l markets; high transport costs; and a high leve l o f dependence o n 
external aid. Even sma l l variations in crop produc t ion created food shortages that were devastating fo r 
small-scale fa rm households. G row th was also constrained b y chron ic macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty , high 
f isca l deficits, and s low progress on impor tan t reforms fo r marke t- led g row th ( fo r example, p r iva t iza t ion 
and e l im ina t ion o f government in terven t ion in agr icu l tura l markets did n o t take place). 

15. Domestic food supplies remained a problem during the period, with droughts causing domestic 

food shortages in 2002 and 2005. D r y weather in January-February 2005 led to widespread fa i lu re o f 
the agr icu l tura l harvest in southern A fr ica , with M a l aw i one o f the countries wors t affected. Ag r icu l tu ra l 
p roduc t iv i ty f e l l 7 percent during 2004, and the 2005 maize crop was estimated to be almost 30 percent 
lowe r than this level, resulting in 2005 be ing the wors t maize season in 10 years. The drop in ma ize 
produc t ion corresponded to a shor t fa l l equivalent o f about 20 percent o f na t iona l food consump t ion 
requirements between April 2005 and M a r c h 2006. 

16. There have been limited improvements in trends in social indicators. A l though efforts have been 

made to imp lemen t a number o f actions, M a l a w i s t i l l faces a number o f challenges in the social sectors. 
There has been some progress in social indicators, especially in fan t mo r ta l i ty levels, p r ima ry schoo l 
enrolment rates and the s tab i l iza t ion o f H I V / A I D s prevalence.26 percent. Other ind ica tors have worsened 
or stagnated, such as maternal mo r ta l i ty rates and l i f e expectancy. Chron ic ma lnu t r i t ion i s among the

have persisted fo r at least the last decade and continue to reduce p roduc t iv i ty leve ls in a number o f 
sectors, hampering e f fec t ive learn ing and increasing the severity o f re la ted illnesses and child mo r ta l i ty .

Key Lessons Learned on CAS Design - Bank Performance 

17. Se lect iv ity a n d in t eg r a t ion o f the p rog r am . 

Wh i le the CAS noted that i t w o u l d be mo re 
selective, in retrospect the Bank ’s in terven t ions were quite scattered across a number o f expected 
outcomes. As noted in the 2006 IEG CAE, each o f the prev ious CASs fa i led to specify areas to be 
e l im ina ted or reduced and this resulted in a Bank p rog ram that was spread too th in ly across sectors and 
within adjustment operations. Th is may have diluted the Bank’s ab i l i ty to adjust to weak imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the f i rs t two p i l la rs o f the strategy. There was also l i t t l e apparent attempt to integrate various ac t iv i t ies 
across products. Fo r instance, while the issues o f macroeconomic management, parastatal re form , and 
economic g row th are a l l related, the CAS was spread over several smaller issues (agr icu l tura l 
produc t iv i ty , business reform, na tura l resource management, f isca l discipline, etc.). M u c h o f the e f f o r t in 
the f i rs t tw o p i l la rs dealt with capacity building (in the pub l ic sector, parastatals, and fo r service de l ive ry 
activities). 

18. In ad equ a t e a t ten t ion to capac ity bu i ld ing . The Program did n o t su f f ic ien t ly address ins t i tu t iona l 

capacity issues - either in terms o f t h e comp lex i ty o f ind iv idua l operations, consideration o f the broader 
po l i t ica l economy in enab l ing imp lemen ta t ion o f key reforms, or development o f a strategic p rog ram fo r 
strengthening capacity through a l l operational opportunities. The IEG evaluation o f capacity building in 
M a l a w i (2005) found that while economic analysis has tended to be better than the analysis o f unde r ly ing 
po l i t ica l conditions, the sh i f t in powe r and the con f l ic t ing interests among actors are poo r ly captured, and 
the po l i t ica l incentives fo r p r iva t iza t ion and pub l ic sector re fo rm have been overestimated. Th is has o f ten 
led to simplistic conclusions about “ lack o f comm i tmen t” in B a n k reviews o f the results o f wha t were 
unrealistic strategies and timelines. The Bank m igh t have to recognize that a slower pace o f r e f o rm m i g h t 
ma tch the loca l absorptive capacity fo r change within the scope and objectives o f i ts lend ing 
interventions, thus imp rov ing buy- in , ownership and u l t ima te ly results. 

P i l lar 1: Strengthening Economic Management and Accountability 

19. During the CAS period, M a l a w i made some progress in imp rov ing economic performance including 
in ach iev ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . F isca l slippages, especially in early 200427, and the l o n g reco rd o f 
weak p o l i c y performance, had damaged the economy through entrenched in f la t ion expectations, high rea l 
interest rates, and depressed pr iva te sector investment. The new Government, elected in M a y 2004, 
increased attention to macroeconomic stability, f isca l discipline, and anti-corruption. In the first twe lve 
months o f the new Mu tha r ika adm in is tra t ion a number o f impor tan t reforms were imp lemen ted and 
efforts were made to rein in government spending and tackle entrenched interests and corruption. 

20. The two expected CAS outcomes under th is theme were consistent with the d irec t ion o f the Bank 
program during previous p e r i o d ~ ’ ~ , and were complementary to the IMF’s e f fo r t through i ts S ta f f 
Mon i to red Program (2000-2004) and to the support f r om the Department fo r In terna t iona l Deve lopmen t 
(DFID), the European U n i o n (EU), and the United Na t ions . 

27 Be fo re the M a y 2004 elections, the government had fa i led to keep pub l ic expenditures in check, leading t o the discontinuation o f the IMF 
Pove r ty Reduc t ion Growth Fac i l i ty (PRGF) in April 2004. Sho r t ly after the elections, the new government and the IMF agreed o n an IMF S ta f f 
Mon i to red Program (SMP), lay ing the basis for a new PRGF supported p rog ram agreed in 2005. 
l4 Wh i le macroeconomic s tab i l i ty was an exp l ic i t focus in 1996 and again in 2003, in 1998 i t was subsumed as part o f the focus on economic 
g row th strategies. Economic g row th has also been a constant, though evolving, theme throughout the three CASs. In 1996, private sector-led 
g row th was emphasized, re f lec t ing the optirmsm that pub l ic sector restructunng, privatization, and an enabling environment w o u l d lead to a 
resurgent p r iva te sector. The 1998 CAS focused mo re o n broad-based labor-intensive growth, pa r t ly in response to the lack o f structural 
transformations, but also pa r t ly due to a realization that inuch o f the g row th w o u l d have to come f f om small-scale enterprises and the ag r icu l tu ra l 
sector. The 2003 CAS returned to the un f in ished agenda o f economic restructuring intended to set M a l aw i o n a higher and mo re sustainable 
g row th path. (IEG, M a l aw i case study as part o f a n evaluation o f capacity bu i ld ing , 2005)

Outcome 1: Improved public expenditure management. Relevant and moderately satisfactory. 

21. Th is outcome focused o n imp rov ing pub l ic expenditure management through mo re transparent budge t 
formulation, execution, and reporting. I t sought to strengthen f inanc ia l management and mon i to r ing and 
evaluation (M&E) systems, and accountability ins t i tu t ions (including empower ing communities). At the 
start o f the CAS, each o f these areas was weak, with poor supporting systems. 

22. Results. B y the end o f the CAS , the indicators fo r imp roved expenditure management showed 
m i n im a l improvement, although some o f the milestones were achieved. M o s t progress was no ted in 
“developing accountable institutions,” with increased parliamentary scrutiny o f the budget and with the 
Government ho ld ing commun i ty budget consultations. Several e f for ts were made to strengthen capacity 
in the f i v e dimensions o f expenditure management (defined in the CAS). Towa rd the end o f the C A S 
pe r iod the new Government showed increased comm i tmen t to these reforms. 

0 Imp rov ing expenditure management. The new Government has e l im ina ted extra budgetary spending 
and introduced new expenditure management procedures, which, comb ined with strong p o l i t i c a l 
comm i tmen t to f isca l discipline and sound public expenditure managements, has resulted in immed ia te 
improvements in budget execution. Add i t iona l ly , the Government has recen t ly taken steps to imp rove 
the repor t ing o f donor funding w i t h i n the budget, and this i s expected to resu l t in s ign i f ican t 
improvements starting with 2006/07. 

Budget d isc ip l ine . During 2004/05 the Government l i v e d within i t s budge t fo r the f i rs t time in almost 
a decade. Ac tua l expenditure outturns appear close to budgeted amounts. The Government has been 
rap id ly implementing the Integrated F inanc ia l Management System (IFMIS) since August 2005; the 
new system i s no t yet functional, but i t s con f igura t ion i s well advanced. In October 2005, a B a n k 
m iss ion to rev iew i t s imp lemen ta t ion revealed that i t i s wo rk ing and o n track fo r p i l o t i n g in f i v e 
m in is tr ies in early 2006. F inanc ia l repo r t ing i s improv ing , but there rema in s ign i f ican t gaps. 

0 MTEF. At the beginning o f the C A S period, the Government was deve lop ing a basis fo r a Medium- 
Te rm Expenditure F ramewo rk (MTEF ) as a more strategic approach to budgeting and planning. A t 
completion, M T E F does no t w o r k in practice; i t continues to dependent on cash-based systems w i thou t 
three-year projections and i s no t supported b y an integrated f inanc ia l management system. EU and 
DFID are p rov id ing support to imp lemen t an M T E F Phase 11, to be completed in 2007. 

M a l uw i Grow th and Development Strategy. In April 2005 the new Government began deve lop ing i t s 
second-generation PRSP, the M a l a w i G r ow t h and Deve lopmen t Strategy (MGDS). The process 
invo lved a l l l i n e ministries, and brough t together the various strategies and programs o f Government 
in to a results-oriented approach. The strategy’s resu l ts framework links impacts to outcomes, outputs, 
actions, and expenditures. Plans are to link the MGDS resu l ts f ramewo rk to the budget process, and 
over t ime this cou ld be used as a basis to develop a func t ion ing MTEF. 

New legislation. The new Procurement Act, F inanc ia l Management Act, and Pub l ic Audit A c t have 
been approved b y Parliament and are be ing implemented, lead ing to improvemen ts in transparency and 
accountability in pub l ic expenditure management. Also, the recent cen tra l iza t ion o f accounts, as pa r t o f 
the new epicor-based IFMIS, i s expected to contribute enormously to the Government’s accoun tab i l i ty 
and transparency framework. 

23. Bank Support The Bank’s p rog ram o f support inc luded F D R P I I I and a techn ica l assistance loan 
(200 1/2004); Na t iona l Water Deve lopmen t project; the Road Maintenance project; the Secondary 
Educa t ion project; the F isca l Management Transparency and Accoun tab i l i ty Pro jec t (F IMTAP , 2003); 

49 

two IDF grants (an t icorrup t ion and support to the accountancy profession); “efficiency-enhancing” 
components in sector loans (such as the Soc ia l Ac t ion Fund [MASAF IU I I I ] w i t h a focus on commun i ty 
empowerment; cond i t iona l balance o f payments support (if the C A S moved in to the base case) in the 
F isca l Management and Accelerated G row th Program (FIMAG, 2005); distance 
learn ing in 
macroeconomic management (GDLN, 2004); and two emergency projects to a l lev ia te the impac t o f 
droughts o n macroeconomic s tab i l i ty (Emergency D rough t Recovery Pro jec t [EDRP], 2002, and 
Emergency Recovery Loan, 2005). Relevant economic and sector w o r k (ESW) inc luded the Coun try 
F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessmen t (CFAA , 2004), to complement the 2002 CFAA ; the Coun t ry 
Econom ic Memo randum (CEM , 2004); the Coun try Procurement Assessmen t Repor t (CPAR, 2004); and 
the H IPC Coun try Assessmen t and Ac t ion P lan (H IPC AAP , 2004). In 2005/2006, programmatic ana ly t ic 
and advisory services brough t together the many pieces o f analytic w o r k (by the Bank, the Government, 
and other donors) to support design the M G D S as a results-oriented strategy linked to the budget, and 
h igh - leve l dialogue with donors o n the Paris Dec lara t ion he lped a l ign ma jor donor strategies to the 

MGDS. 

24. The operations to de l iver expected results, wh i le techn ica l ly sound, did n o t adequately take in to 
consideration the po l i t ica l conditions that w o u l d make impor tan t p o l i c y conditions and imp lemen ta t ion 
successful. The FIMAG and F I M T A P were bo th based o n so l id analytic w o r k (such as the Coun try 
Econom ic Memo randum (CEM) and Coun try F inanc ia l and Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA ) ; 
however; imp lemen ta t ion was poor : F I M T A P suffered f rom a comp lex des ign with too many objectives 
and FIMAG f r om inadequate comm i tmen t to reforms and too many conditions. The Bank’s response to 
in fo rma t ion on d i f f icu l t ies in imp lemen ta t ion was la te in the C A S cycle, with inadequate supervision o f 
F I M T A P and FIMAG (rated b y Q A G as unsatisfactory and ma rg ina l ly satisfactory, respectively28). 
Toward the end o f the CAS , more attention was pa id to the d i f f icu l t ies in the po r t fo l io , which resulted in 
res truc tur ing o f F I M T A P and cancellation o f GDLN. The technical and advisory support p rov ided b y the 
Bank to the new Government has been h igh ly valued. Th is support supported development o f the results 
oriented M a l a w i G row th and Deve lopmen t Strategy and in tegra t ion o f various pieces o f Bank ana ly t ica l 
w o r k in to the process o f strategy development 

Ou t com e 2: I m p r o v e d p a r a s t a t a l effectiveness. Relevant bu t moderately unsatisfactory resu l t , 

25. This C A S outcome sought to reduce the burden o f parastatals o n the Government and imp rove the 
operational e f f ic iency o f key parastatals, thereby con tr ibu t ing to imp roved service delivery. To address 
limited access to electricity, unre l iab le energy supplies, the high cost o f telecommunications, and 
inadequate access to water, and to stop t h e dra in on Government revenues f r om increasing parastatal 
losses, the Government moved to p r iva t ize i t s telecommunications, power , and water u t i l i t i e s . 

26. Results. B y the end o f the CAS, commerc ia l parastatal losses had increased and operational 
e f f ic iency was s t i l l low ; the on ly improvemen t in service de l ivery was in the pos ta l services. There was 
some progress in key milestones, such as the unbundling o f the E lec t r ic i ty Supply Corpora t ion o f M a l a w i 
and in p r iva t iza t ion o f telecommunications, but b y and large imp lemen ta t ion was unsatisfactory. The 
M a l a w i Ag r icu l tu ra l Deve lopmen t and Ma rke t ing Corpora t ion ( A DM A R C ) continues to represent an 
impediment to the invo lvemen t o f the p r iva te sector in agr icu l tura l inpu t and ou tpu t markets, and the 
Bank’s program did n o t succeed in reducing the negative effects o f some A D M A R C operations in these 
markets. 

27. Bank Support. The Bank‘s p rog ram o f support inc luded the Na t iona l Water Deve lopmen t Pro jec t 
(NWDP), which closed in 2003; the P r iva t iza t ion and U t i l i t y Re fo rm Project (PURP 2000); and 
conditions in the FIMAG pro jec t . PURP, the ma in operation expected to con tr ibu te to th is CAS outcome,

suffered f r om an ove r ly ambitious pro jec t design and insu f f ic ien t Government b u y - i n and ownership. 
Disbursement was very s low during implementation, b u t the Bank did l i t t l e to imp rove imp lemen ta t ion 
until mid-2005, when i t restructured the PURP. The Bank under took no E SW in support o f the operation 
and po l icy dialogue until late in the C A S pe r iod (w i t h an Investment C l ima te Assessment, o r ICA ) . 

28. Lessons from implementation of P i l la r 1. The assessment concludes that more results cou ld have 
been achieved in the Bank‘s p rog ram had more attention been g iven to ownership, capacity building and 
partnership. 

0 

AAA. While the analytic w o r k was strong, there was l im i t e d Government ownership o f the 
findings, at least pa r t ly because the bo r rowe r was no t su f f ic ien t ly invo lved in preparation and design. 
Weak bo r rowe r ownership o f impor tan t reforms, conditions that were unrealistic g iven the country’s 
capacity constraints, and lack o f spec i f ic i ty in the language o f conditions con tr ibu ted to s low 
performance and con fus ion as to whether the government had me t cer ta in controversial cond i t ions 
(such as A D M A R C res truc tur ing) . 
I t was also no t clear i f l ine ministries, impor tan t in imp lemen t ing 
the reforms, were su f f ic ien t ly engaged in design o f the conditionalities, and thus owned the changes 
that needed to take place. In addition, comp lex d e s i g n w i t h too many objectives was a key factor in 
limiting success. 

0 

Capacity building. N e w s h l l s and capacities were no t put in to practice to imp rove Government 
performance, although the Government and donors supported a variety o f capac i ty-bu i ld ing and 
t ra in ing ac t iv i t ies w i t h accountants, auditors, and f inanc ia l managers. 

0 

Leverage and partnerships. The C A S design, o r later mod i f ica t ions , cou ld have leveraged other 
resources to he lp imp rove service de l ivery a long with p r iva t iza t ion reforms. Such resources cou ld have 
inc luded no t on ly add i t iona l donor resources, but also consideration o f pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships and 
alternative operational models. 

P i l lar 2: Establishing a Platform for Long-Term Sustainable Growth 

29. Th is p i l l a r h igh l igh ted t h e importance o f rapid, broad-based, and sustainable g row th to reduce pove r ty 
in Ma law i . During the period, g row th was be low expectations and continued the pa t tern o f f luc tua t ing , 
h igh ly variable rea l GDP growth, ma in ly because o f the economy’s dependence on the agr icu l tura l sector, 
structural weaknesses, and vu lnerab i l i ty to external factors such as drought and other na tura l disaster. 
Ma law i ’s pr iva te sector remains small, and output i s stagnating because o f l o w capacity u t i l iza t ion and 
dec l in ing investments. There was a high rate o f deforestation adding to so i l erosion and erosion o f the 
na tura l resource base. Th is was coup led with continued dependence o n wood as a source o f househo ld 
energy, and a few monopo l is t ic indus tr ia l producers dependent on pub l ic forests fo r raw materials. 

30. Th is p i l l a r complemented the focus in the f i rs t p i l l a r o n imp roved public expenditure and parastatal 
re fo rm with a focus o n a number o f key requirements fo r g row th in Ma law i . The C A S iden t i f ied three 
expected outcomes to be achieved during the pe r iod o f the CAS : a more compe t i t ive business 
environment, imp roved agr icu l tura l produc t iv i ty , and pro tec t ion o f na tura l resources in the M u l a n j e 
Mass i f . 

Outcome 3: M o r e competitive business environment. Relevant but moderately unsatisfactory result. 

3 1. Th is outcome sought to address key bottlenecks to the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f medium- and large-scale 
pr iva te enterprises in the economy b y reduc ing the cost o f and increas ing access to (a) u t i l i t ies impo r tan t 

5 1 

to pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion (power, water, and telecommunication); (b) transportation; and (c) f inanc ia l 
and po l i t ica l risk service instruments. 

32. Results. B y the end o f the CAS, p r iva t iza t ion efforts were no t p roduc ing expected improvements in 
service de l ivery (see Outcome 2); on ly pos ta l de l ivery and urban water supply had improved . There were 
improvements in the road networks, targets fo r the Road Fund were large ly met, and as o f January 2006 
the Road Fund was rece iv ing su f f ic ien t f inanc ia l resources to cover rou t ine maintenance. W h i l e E G 
found that the program o f Bank support had successfully b u i l t capacity in the road sector, there rema ined 
problems with supporting loca l con trac t ing indus tr ies , since high domestic interest rates o f ten keep loca l 
contractors f r om accessing a f fordab le finance. The Reg iona l Trade and Fac i l i ta t ion Project had l i t t l e 
impac t o n produc t ive ac t iv i t ies in Ma law i , w h i c h continues to be constrained by a perception o f high 
po l i t ica l risk. 

33. Bank Support. The Bank‘s p rog ram o f support inc luded the PURP, Reg iona l Trade and Fac i l i ta t ion 
project, F IM T A P , ROMARP , NWDP , Ru ra l Infrastructure Project, Southern A f r i c a Power Ma rke t (in 
preparation fo r Ma law i-Mozamb ique connector), a F inanc ia l Sector Rev iew in 2003 (a F inanc ia l Sector 
Assessment i s planned f o r FY07), IDF Grant support to the An t i -Co r rup t ion Bureau, a CEM , and an I C A 
(launched in January 2006). Towa rd the end o f the CAS, the B a n k increased i t s dialogue w i t h p r iva te 
sector and government, and proposed innova t ive approaches to address p r iva te sector issues-such 
as 
bringing together po ten t ia l supermarket customers and loca l producers to he lp iden t i fy constraints to and 
opportunities for business development. The Bank also continued i t s more po l icy -o r ien ted w o r k o f 
benchma rhng Ma law i ’s pr iva te sector performance against that o f ne ighbor ing countries. 

Outcome 4: Improved agricultural productivity and revenue, both fo r main cash crop (tobacco) 

and main consumption crops. Highly relevant but unsatisfuctory result. 

34. Th is outcome sought to imp rove agr icu l tura l produc t iv i ty , b y addressing key bottlenecks such as 
inadequate access to input and output markets \ and ine f f ic ien t land markets. 

35. Results. A t the end o f the CAS, agr icu l tura l g row th was l o w wh i le p roduc t iv i ty continued to decline, 
with many o f the bottlenecks to p roduc t iv i ty rema in ing to be addressed. Necessary actions to imp rove the 
supply cha in in tobacco did no t take place, and targets fo r land scarce fam i l ies t o bene f i t f r om l a n d 
acqu is i t ion were no t reached during the C A S period. In 2002 and 2005, droughts nega t ive ly in f luenced 
this CAS outcome, and the Bank responded with a h igh ly successful emergency drought r e l i e f pro jec t . 
However, other operations did n o t de l iver the expected results, and many o f the impor tan t milestones, 
such as devo lu t ion o f service de l ivery to the fron t lines, were delayed. 

36. Bank Support. The Bank’s p rog ram o f support inc luded the Commun i ty-Based Ru ra l L ive l ihoods 
Project (CBRL , 2004), FIMAG, EDR P (2002)’ IRLAD (2005), the Ru ra l In fras truc ture pro jec t (entering

W h i l e operations were a l igned to the C A S outcomes, there was no t a strong ana ly t ica l basis to 
understand many o f the issues fac ing business. The I C A launched in 2006 should p rov ide 
in fo rma t ion o n constraints in the enab l ing environment fo r p r iva te investment, bu t i t may no t 
su f f ic ien t ly address sma l l and medium scale enterprises o r the bottlenecks to m icro f inance and 
domestic savings. In general, there was a lack o f su f f ic ien t focus o n infrastructure to complement 
reforms. 

Projects o f ten gave insu f f ic ien t attention to ma rke t ing and log is t ica l issues ; investments in 
increasing p roduc t iv i ty are un l ike ly to enhance farmers’ incomes unless they address marke t 
development issues simultaneously. Re- inv igora ted extension po l ic ies and interventions need to 
focus o n deve lop ing a p lura l is t ic and demand-driven extension service, and extension shou ld be 
fur ther devolved to the D is t r ic t Assemblies. 

The emergency drought r e l i e f pro jec t was able to start the process o f fo rmu la t ing the food 
security po l icy , but did no t in i t s e l f p rov ide a comprehensive food security strategy, Programs in 
agriculture shou ld be a l igned to efforts to improve food security. 

P i l lar 3: Improving Service Delivery and Expanding the Safety Ne t 

39 . Th is p i l l a r sought to con tr ibu te to improvements in social ind ica tors in Ma law i , especially fo r the 
vulnerable. 
I t h igh l igh ted the importance o f developing and ma in ta in ing a strong human resource base 
and p rov id ing a mechanism to reduce the r isks faced b y vulnerable groups. The three expected outcomes 
iden t i f ied were (a) suppor t ing the vulnerable, (b) imp rov ing expenditure management in hea l th and 

5 3 

education, and (c) reduc ing r isky sexual behaviors that lead to H I V / A I D s . During the pe r iod capacity 
constraints continued to hinder the translation o f increased public social expenditures in to sustained 
improvements in the qua l i ty and reach o f basic social service de l ivery . Th is was exacerbated b y the 
impac t o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic. 

Ou t com e 6: Con t inu ed suppo r t to vu ln e r ab l e groups. H i g h l y r e l e v an t a n d sat isfactory r e s u l t 

40. Th is outcome was expected to con tr ibu te to pover ty reduction, increased food security,29 and the 
MDGs through a community-based response, and was complemented b y the e f for ts under p i l l a r 2 to 
address the structural issues o f food security in terms o f agr icu l tura l production. The CAS outcome 
sought to d i rec t ly in f luence the number households w i t h measurable case incomes f r om programs such as 
o f Pub l ic Works Programs (PWP) and Targeted N u t r i t i o n Programs (TNP). 

4 1. Results. At the start o f the CAS, the demand fo r social and economic services was ove rwhe lm ing 
because o f pover ty levels and continued shocks. Communities were unable to mob i l ize savings, wh ich 
nega t ive ly affected government-community partnership in service de l ivery . B y the end o f the CAS, there 
was s t i l l a high demand fo r social and economic services; however, the program had been successful in 
imp rov ing access to social services. The number o f households with measurable increases in cash 
income rose f r om 260,000 to 1.4 m i l l i o n beneficiaries f r om pub l ic works programs; 220,000 ch i ld ren 
bene f i ted f r om school nu t r i t ion programs; and 115,000 orphans received take-home rations as par t o f the 
emergency drought r e l i e f efforts. Sustainability o f these pos i t ive results i s contingent on ma in ta in ing 
close l inks to the commun i ty level, ensuring that pub l ic works and d irec t welfare transfers complement 
government e f for ts to enhance pro-poor growth, and maintenance o f infrastructure at the d is tr ic t leve l . 
L o o k i n g forward, the impac t o f increased commun i ty development projects on women’s t ime shou ld be 
assessed, as women p rov ide much o f the labor in commun i ty d r iven development (CDD ) projects, and 
they w o r k 15 hours a day compared to 8 fo r men.30 

42. Bunk Support. Th is outcome was d i rec t ly in f luenced b y MASAF I 1 and 111, Bank support to the 
Na t iona l AIDS Counc i l (NAC), a MASAF - re la ted component in the ERDP, and the community-based 
ru ra l lands project. During the C A S period, MASAF I1 was closed and the fo l low -on MASAF I11 (an 
Adaptable Program Loan) became effective. Th is trans i t ion demonstrated a sh i f t in the Bank’s support 
f r om funding infrastructure and cash transfers to assisting loca l government in m o b i l i z i n g commun i t ies to 
undertake activities to contribute to a t ta in ing loca l ized MDGs. Th is trans i t ion was w e l l sequenced, and 
should help m i t iga te the po ten t ia l negative impac t o f social we l fare transfers o n the Government’s 
program. The ins t i tu t iona l structure p rov ided b y the MASAF p rog ram enabled the Government to 
respond qu ick ly to the drought, and strong linkages have been fo rged b e tw e e n MASAF and cer ta in 
sectors (water, sanitation, roads) at the commun i ty leve l . (Several other donors are also ac t ive in 
supporting vulnerable groups, especially in the de l ive r ing programs to enhance nu t r i t ion and welfare.) 

Ou t com e 7: I m p r o v e d expend i tu re managemen t , in s t i tu t ion a l structure , f o r service d e l i v e r y in 

h e a l th a n d education. Relevant but moderately sutisfactory results 

43. This outcome focused on two separate sectors with d i f feren t longer- term goals in the PRSP and 
MGDS-the 
education and the hea l th sectors. In the Educa t ion sector the C A S focused p r im a r i l y o n 
imp rov ing expenditure management and imp rov ing secondary school enrollment. 
In health, the C A S 
sought to imp rove expenditure management and enhance the qua l i ty o f essential hea l th care services. 

z y The Coun t ry Economc Memo randum 2003 distinguished between food security cons t i tu t ing a social safety ne t fo r people w i thou t assets or 
entitlement who requ i red assistance at a l l times, and po l ic ies aimed at assisting p roduc t ive ind imdua ls who had lost their income because o f a 
decrease in ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion resu l t ing f r om weather-related shocks. T h e t w o are interrelated, but t h i s outcome specifically addressed the 
former, w h i l e p i l la r 2 addressed the latter.

44. Results in Expenditure Management. The budget system remains func t iona l ly de- l inked to strategic 
p lann ing in the M i n i s t r i e s o f Hea l th and Education. M T E F does no t w o r k in prac t ice and continues to 
depend on cash-based systems w i thou t three-year projections and i s no t supported b y an integrated 
f inanc ia l management system. Recent e f for ts b y Government to develop a results based second 
generation PRSP (MGDS) l inked to expenditure management p rov ide a good basis to deepen e f for ts fo r a 
func t ion ing M T E F . 
Bank support 
fo r 
imp roved expenditure management included F IM T A P , 
par t ic ipa t ion in t h e hea l th sector SWAp , and several pieces o f ESW: a rev iew o f hea l th f inanc ing and 
human resources, an education status report, and bene f i t incidence analysis in the pover ty and 
vu lnerab i l i ty assessment. 

In the health sector, there i s some prom ise fo r future progress in expenditure management. The 
SWAP framework includes a f inanc ia l improvement p lan and a procurement improvemen t p lan to 
strengthen weak f iduc iary systems. Budgetary re fo rm in i t ia ted under a 1995 MTEF and, more recently, 
support f r om H I P C have a l lowed annual government hea l th expenditures to be increased and protected 
under the “Pro-Poor Expenditure” budgetary category. 

In education, the M in is t ry o f Educa t ion has been s low in building capacities and strengthening the 
management o f the sector. 
However, con t inu ing strong government comm i tmen t to education has 
translated in to increasing budgetary and donor support. 

45. Education Moderately Satisfactory Results. At C A S completion, the ove ra l l comp le t ion rate fo r 
secondary education and the pass rate fo r the secondary school cer t i f ica te exam ina t ion had increased fo r 
bo th girls and boys; however, secondary school enrollment continues to be biased toward r icher 
households, especially fo r girls. The qua l i ty o f secondary education remains weak: ins truc t iona l materials 
rema in scarce, fac i l i t ies are inadequate, and the number o f un tra ined teachers remains high with a l im i t e d 
capacity o f the teacher education systems. The standards fo r secondary school are uneven and inequ i tab le 
deployment o f resources continues to weaken the overa l l qua l i ty o f secondary education where output, 
par t icu lar ly in the areas o f science and technology, remains weak. 

46. Bunk Support for Education. The Bank‘s support consisted o f a US$48 m i l l i o n Secondary 
Educa t ion Project (SEP, 1998); a US$32 m i l l i o n Education Sector Support Pro jec t (ESSUP, 2005); and a 
Coun try Status Repor t (CSR) o n Cost, F inanc ing and School Effectiveness in Ma law i . After seven years 
o f implementation, SEP i s the oldest pro jec t in the M a l aw i po r t fo l io . I t has a t rack record o f uneven 
imp lemen ta t ion performance: at m id te rm on ly one-eighth o f the cred i t had been disbursed; every 
component was in trouble; and serious procurement and f inanc ia l management problems c u t across a l l 
components. Despite a recent turnaround in the imp lemen ta t ion o f some components, i t has become 
evident that the objectives were un l ike ly to be achieved o r measured w i t h i n the expected t ime frame and 
w i thou t additional investments. W i t h ESSUP there have been delays in pro jec t start-up. The ministry has 
n ow fo rma l ly approved a move towa rd a SWAp , wh ich most o f the ministry’s donor partners, inc lud ing 
the Bank, support. 
In terms o f ana ly t ic work, the CSR p rov ided an excellent basis fo r w o r k in the 
education sector and brough t the Government, the donors, and the Bank in to a stronger co l labora t ive 
partnership. 

47. Hea lth - Satisfactory Result. At C A S design, a key challenge fo r the Government was to strengthen 
the performance o f the d is tr ic t hea l th systems and to develop integrated hea l th programs to de l iver the 
Essential Hea l th Package (EHP). Th is was par t icu lar ly impor tan t g iven the government’s in ten t ion o f 
decentralizing the p rov is ion o f pub l ic services. At completion, the hea l th sector s t i l l faced a number o f 
challenges to service de l ivery . The Hea l th SWAP responded to the s i tua t ion with deve lop ing and 
emergency human resource p lan with the Government to assesses the human resource shortage including 
increasing the tra in ing o f hea l th professionals especially med ica l assistants and nurses . Subsequently, 

5 5 

M a l a w i has increased the number o f hea l th care professionals such as n u r s e s in tra in ing . Wh i le there was 
a target o f no t l e s s than 200 nurses, 50 med ica l assistants and 20 radiography technicians to be trained, 
currently, there are over 500 nurses, 130 med ica l assistants and 20 radiography assistants in tra in ing . 
However, the hea l th sector s t i l l faces challenges to service de l ivery . 

48. Bank Support Hea lth . The 2003 C A S made imp roved hea l th status in M a l a w i a p r i o r i t y and 
identified the need fo r renewed engagement o f the Bank in the hea l th sector. The B a n k jo ined the Hea l th 
Sector Support Program (SWAp) with an IDA grant o f US $ 1 5 m i l l ion . The Bank 's interventions within 
the SWAP a imed at imp rov ing the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f hea l th services, and p rov id ing the 
Essential Hea l th Package to poor people, especially women and ch i ldren . The B a n k has e f fec t ive ly 
leveraged i t s ro le as j u n i o r f inanc ing partner in the hea l th SWAP and p lays a c r i t ica l ro le in 
implementation. Other Bank support inc luded FIMAG, p rov id ing loca l authorities with funding fo r 
p r ima ry hea l th care centers; MASAF 111, using a par t ic ipa tory ru ra l approach to assist communities to 
access the hea l th services that they consider essential; and the Ma la r ia Booster Project, a recent p ipe l ine 
pro jec t that i s par t o f the hea l th SWAp . Ana ly t ic w o r k inc luded the Strategic Coun try Gender 
Assessment (2003) dea l ing w i t h gender issues in the hea l th sector, and Human Resources and F inanc ing 
fo r Hea l th in M a l a w i (2004), ana lyz ing the human resource s i tua t ion in the hea l th sector and hea l th sector 
f inanc ing options fo r consideration b y Government and development partners. 

Ou t com e 8: R isky sexual behav io r reduced . Relevant a n d satisfuctory resu l t . 

49. Th is outcome a imed to change the r isky behav ior o f groups at risk fo r H I V / A I D S . The outcome was 
h igh ly relevant to M a l a w i where H I V / A I D S continued to pose a challenge to Ma law i 's people and 
resources - with an estimated prevalence rate o f 14 percent Ma law i 's H I V / A I D S cr is is i s ranked the e igh t 
most severe in the ~ o r l d . ~ ' percent). The Na t iona l Aids Comm iss ion (N AC ) estimates that about 900,000 
Ma law ians were i n f e c t e d with HIV/AIDS b y 2003. 
In addition, H I V / A I D S has gender specific 
characteristics, no t on ly in terms o f prevalence rates, but also in socio-economic impact. The C A S 
outcome expected to con tr ibu te to reductions in prevalence rates by focus ing on changing the behav ior o f 
at risk groups. 

50. Results. A t C A S completion, HIV/AIDS awareness exceeded 90 percent in the general population, 
w i t h some evidence o f behav ior change (between 2003 and 2005, condom u s e has increased f r om 39 
percent to 47 percent in men and 29 percent to 30 percent in women). The number o f people aged 15- 24 
who correc t ly iden t i fy ways o f preven t ing transmission o f HIV and re jec t ma jo r misconceptions about 
HIV has increased during the C A S pe r iod f r om 37 percent to 41 percent in males and f r om 24 percent to 
25 percent in females. In addition, three p i l o t districts supported b y the Bank p r o g r a m x h i t i p a , N tch is i , 
and Chiradzulu-recorded unprecedented increases in contraceptive prevalence rates. 

5 1. Bunk Support. The Bank was engaged in the f igh t against HIV/AIDS in M a l a w i through a cluster o f 
interventions: M A P support fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f the Na t iona l Strategic Framework fo r H I V / A I D S (the 
Bank i s par t ic ipa t ing in poo led funding w i t h other development partners and the Government); the Hea l th 
Sector Support Program, w i t h complementary activities focused o n linkages to the M i n i s t r y o f Hea l th in 
the fight against H I V / A I D s ; MASAF I 1 and 111 support fo r commun i ty proposals fo r vulnerable groups 
w i t h an emphasis o n the chron ica l ly ill, orphans, and the e lder ly ; the Roads Maintenance and 
Rehab i l i ta t ion project, with i t s sector H I V / A I D S strategy; the Secondary Educa t ion Pro jec t (SEP), 
p rov id ing H I V / A I D S materials in secondary schools; and the Irr iga t ion , Ru ra l L ive l ihoods and 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Services Pro jec t ( IRLASP ) wh ich integrates H I V / A I D S preven t ion messages in to extension 
services. Add i t iona l ly , the Bank contributes such fo rma l and i n f o rm a l ESW products as discussions o f

the H I V / A I D S epidemic, i ts impacts on ach iev ing expected sector results, and possible mechanisms to 
address impacts in specific sectors. 

52. Lessons from implementation of P i l la r 3. The assessment concludes that where results were evident 
in this p i l l a r i t was pa r t ly because o f the mu l t ip le instruments that were used and the poo led o r j o i n t 
approaches with other donors. Th is enabled l im i ta t ion o f fragmentation and t h e management burden o n 
the government. 
In addition, several recent Imp lemen ta t ion Comp le t ion Reports emphasized the 
importance o f realistic objectives that can be translated in to operational and mon i torab le terms. The 
Popu la t ion and Fam i ly P lann ing (Pop/FP) p ro jec t demonstrates the importance o f e f fec t ive design, clear- 
cu t indicators, and continuous mon i to r ing in ach iev ing better r e s u l t s . F ina l ly , support under this p i l l a r 
bene f i ted f r om linking ESW preparation w i t h po l icy choices and programmatic support. The recent ESW 
o n the f inanc ing o f hea l th services and human resources fo r hea l th highlighted the importance o f the 
demand side in achieving hea l th outcomes.

53. Active Portfolio. As o f M a y 2006, Ma law i ’s ac t ive po r t fo l io contained 13 projects w i t h a net 
comm i tmen t o f US$399 m i l l ion . Projects ex i t ing the po r t fo l io in F Y 0 6 inc luded Secondary Education, 
Road Maintenance, and F isca l Management and Acce lera t ing G row th (FIMAG). Three projects entered 
the po r t fo l io : I r r iga t ion and Ru ra l L ive l ihoods , and Emergency Recovery, and Integrated In fras truc ture 
Project. As Append ix Table 2 shows, a l l p lanned projects were undertaken during the C A S period, 
a l though there was streamlining o f the po r t fo l io and some changes to the expected start dates. There were 
several add i t iona l projects in the po r t fo l io such as the two Emergency Operations in FY03 and F Y 0 6 
respectively. Add i t iona l ly , projects such as the F inanc ia l Management and Transparency Pro jec t and the 
Integrated Infrastructure Project entered the po r t fo l io during the C A S period. During FY03 and F Y 0 6 the 
amount o f new commitments entering the po r t fo l io amounted to US$407m. N o operations p lanned in the 
2003 CAS were dropped. Some o f the po r t fo l io features include: 

0 Undisbursed balances. Undisbursed balances have increased s l igh t ly f r om a l o w o f about US$135 at 
the end o f FY03 to about US$208 m i l l ion . 

0 Age. The current po r t fo l io i s qu i te young, with an average age as o f December 2005 o f 2.9 years. 

Instrument Mix. The active po r t fo l io i s heav i ly concentrated on trad i t iona l specific inves tmen t 
projects. In the earlier years under review, there was l im i ted u s e o f such other types o f investment 
operations as learn ing and innova t ion loans and technical assistance loans; there were few adjustment 
credits and no pove r ty reduc t ion support credit. Recent trends are toward increased use o f SWAps, 
w i t h poo led funding mechanisms, especially in the human development sectors (e.g., the H I V / A I D S 
project, the Hea l th Sector Support Project, and the education sector operation). MASAF I11 i s an 
Adaptable Program Loan, a fo rma t that has he lped to establish the long- term comm i tmen t (1 2 years) 
requ ired to make progress in deve lop ing sub-national governmental capacity and accoun tab i l i ty and 
to make noticeable progress towards the MDGs.

54. Portfolio Management. Ind ica tors o f po r t fo l io management show improvements during the last year, 
since the in t roduc t ion o f a Po r t fo l io Improvemen t Plan at the end o f F Y 0 5 (see Table 3). Rea l ism and 
p roac t iv i ty indices are high, demonstrating that the team takes ac t ion to address problems. The increased 
number o f r isky projects in the F Y 0 5 po r t fo l io can be attributed to closer scru t iny under the Po r t fo l io 
Improvemen t Plan. In FY05 , task team leaders were asked to pay more a t ten t ion to p rob lem solving, 
focus ing o n results and outcomes, and to re f lec t more rea l ism in assessing progress in their projects and 
programs. Th is was a marked change no ted during the C A S period.

percent o f the rev iewed sample, w i t h such problems as unclear development objectives, ove r ly ambitious 
or complex des igns and imp lemen ta t ion arrangements, insu f f ic ien t treatment o f imp lemen ta t ion capacity, 
governance and incentives issues , and poo r readiness fo r implementation. Q A G also no ted that the design 
and imp lemen ta t ion o f M&E arrangements appeared weak across the board, w h i l e the bene f i ts o f lessons 
learned f r om previous operations in M a l a w i o f ten appeared to have been overlooked. Supervision, again 
as rated b y QAG , was uneven, rang ing f r om excellent (MASAF, ROMARP , HN/AIDS, SEP, and 
Emergency D rough t Recovery) to unsatisfactory (F IMTAP , PURP). In field interviews, Government and 
some donor s ta f f ind ica ted a sense o f frus tra t ion with t h e s low pace o f B a n k actions and decisions that are 
handled f r om headquarters, especially in situations en ta i l ing in tens ive interactions about po l icy and 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms. There have been recent improvements in supervision and increased a t ten t ion to 
partnership at the country level. In addition, operations with poor qua l i ty at en try (F IMTAP , PURP) have 
recently been restructured. 

56. Analytic and Advisory Activities A Q A G pane l rated the in terna l qua l i ty o f mos t o f the ana ly t ic w o r k 
as satisfactory, with the general qua l i ty o f conclusions and recommendations good but variable. QAG ’s 
Coun try AAA assessment found that the ove ra l l impac t o f the Bank ’s AAA p rog ram was l e s s than the 
sum o f i ts ind iv idua l parts; the p rog ram cou ld have been used to better e f fec t i f i t had led to successful 
design and imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank - o r partner-funded operations. In the hea l th and education sectors 
there were good examples o f more programma t ic approaches to AAA that were w e l l received b y partners. 
Recent advisory support fo r the MGDS focused o n bringing in the findings f r om ana ly t ica l work, such as 
the pover ty and vu lnerab i l i ty assessment, and strengthening the r e s u l t s focus o f the MGDS to make i t 
more operational. Linkages to expenditure management were underpinned b y a strong po l icy dialogue at 
the highest levels o f government. AAA was strongest in addressing t h e i s s u e s related to f isca l 
management/accountability and im p r o v i n g service de l ivery but less s trong in dea l ing with social 
assistance and safety nets. Two p lanned ana ly t ica l pieces were dropped; the Hea l th Status Repor t and the 
Ins t i tu t iona l Governance Rev iew . However , e igh t add i t iona l pieces were de l ivered during the C A S 
period. Tw o o f these ana ly t ica l reports are Soc ia l Impac t Analyses o f A D M A R C and the E lec t r ic i ty

FY05-the QAG - led Coun try Program Assessment (CPA, M a y ZOOS), an innova t ive Coun try Program 
Rev iew (CPR, January 2005), and an M&E Rev iew (February 2005)-yielded 
some impor tan t 
recommendations: to s imp l i fy pro jec t design, increase candor in assessment, focus o n capacity building, 
promo te the commun i ty-dr iven development (CDD) approach (as in MASAF) in operations, increase 
selectivity, t igh ten the links between projects’ development objectives and the C A S goals, and ensure the 
ava i lab i l i ty o f in fo rma t ion to measure the achievement o f the development objectives (relating to M&E). 

In-Country Consultation and Coordination 

58. The MGDS provides a framework fo r a l l donors’ interventions in the country over the medium term. 
M a j o r donor coord ina t ion bodies include ad-hoc meetings o f the Consultative Group and the Paris C lub 
(there has no t been a Consultative Group in M a l a w i since M a y 2000). The Bank p layed an impor tan t ro le 
in suppor t ing Government in designing the MGDS and in p romo t ing dialogue with the donor commun i ty 
on the Paris Declaration. Under the 2006-10 CAS, the Bank expects to make further efforts to increase 
coord ina t ion with other donors to he lp avo id dup l ica t ion o f e f for ts and support Ma law i ’s l im i t e d 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity. 

VI. Lessons fo r t h e N e x t CAS 

59 . In retrospect, the fact that the C A S program was scattered across a number o f expected outcomes may 
have d i lu ted the Bank’s ab i l i ty to adjust to weak imp lemen ta t ion o f the f i rs t two p i l la rs o f the strategy. 
The chosen outcomes were no doubt necessary; however, there was l i t t l e apparent attempt to integrate the 
various activities. Fo r instance, wh i le the issues o f macroeconomic management, parastatal re form , and 
economic g row th are a l l related, the C A S spread them over several smaller issues (agr icu l tura l 
produc t iv i ty , business reform, na tura l resource management, f isca l discipline, etc.). Much o f the e f fo r t in 
the f i rs t two p i l la rs dealt with capacity building (in the pub l ic sector, parastatals, and fo r service de l ive ry 
activities). However, as IEG no ted in i t s rev iew o f capacity building and Q A G no ted in i ts Coun t ry 
Program Assessment, w h i l e the solutions were techn ica l ly sound, the C A S made l i t t l e attempt to address 
the broader ins t i tu t iona l setting o r integrate support. Lessons specific to results area inc luded in Annex 1 : 
Results Summary. Cross cutting lessons fo r the nex t C A S inc lude the fo l low ing :

Integration and linkages. Building linkages in the strategy can he lp de l iver results; fo r instance, 
through the C A S design or through mod i f ica t ions during imp lemen ta t ion the Bank c o u l d have 
leveraged other resources to help with service de l ivery , sequenced with the p r iva t iza t ion 
reforms-such 
resources as, fo r example, add i t iona l donor financing, pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships, 
and Government organization to imp rove infrastructure and services. 

Capacity Building. Capac i ty-bu i ld ing e f for ts (training, workshops, and organizational systems) 
need to be coup led w i t h e f for ts that address broader ins t i tu t iona l re forms and better cons idera t ion 
o f the po l i t ica l w i l l that underpins successful imp lemen ta t ion o f capacity building programs. 

0 Project Design. M a l a w i continued to show poor r e s u l t s over several years as a result o f design 
and imp lemen ta t ion deficiencies in investment operations. 

59 

Ownership. Ownership o f the re fo rm agenda se t out in the Bank’s CAS i s always cr i t ica l . QAG 
no ted that the Bank might have to recognize that a slower pace o f re fo rm m igh t ma tch the loca l 
absorptive capacity for change w i t h i n the scope and objectives o f i ts lend ing interventions, thus 
imp rov ing buy-in, ownership, and u l t ima te ly results. E f fec t ive consensus building and 
partnerships, combined w i t h sustained good-qua l i ty technical work, wou ld also contribute to 
p roduc ing better results.

11. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 

5 . 
Reducing the large domestic debt burden i s expected to remain the 
cornerstone of the government’s fiscal strategy through the medium term. Domes t ic 
debt reached almost 25 percent o f GDP in 2003/04 with interest costs o f 9 percent o f 
G D P (or one fifth o f the budget). W h e n a n ew gove rnmen t was elected in ea r ly 2004, i t 
made reve rs ing the domestic debt sp i ra l i t s f isca l p r i o r i t y . By the end o f FY 0 5 / 0 6 the 
gove rnmen t succeeded in reduc ing domestic debt b e l ow 2 0 percent o f G D P and domestic 
interest costs t o about 5.5 percent. This was achieved, despite the severe f o o d crisis, 
through f isca l restraint, l ow e r interest rates, as w e l l as higher program support. Con t inued 
f isca l restraint, fu r the r reductions in interest rates in tandem with a sustained reduc t ion in 
in f la t ion , and debt r e l i e f under the MDRI are assumed t o enable the gove rnmen t t o 
reduce the domestic debt b e l ow 10 percent and interest payments t o abou t 2 percent o f 
GDP . O v e r the longe r term, the baseline scenario assumes that the gove rnmen t w i l l 
target a stable domestic debt bu rden o f abou t 2 percent o f GDP at a cost o f less than 0.5 
percent o f GDP in interest payments. 

6. 
External debt r e l i e f combined with the government’s commitment to reduce 
domestic debt would lead to a substantial decline in Malawi’s public debt stock. 
M a l aw i ’ s p u b l i c debt stock i s expected t o d rop f r o m 159 percent o f G D P in 2005 t o 37 
percent o f GD P in 2006 as a result o f H I P C debt r e l i e f and the imp lemen ta t ion o f MDRI. 
I t i s p ro jec ted to dec l ine and b o t t om ou t a round 32 pe rcen t at the turn o f the decade. 
S im i la r ly , the N P V o f p u b l i c debt w o u l d decline f r o m 7 4 percent o f GDP in 2005 t o 
a round 18 percent o f GDP at the end o f the decade. 

7. 
The projected improvement in the public debt burden i s vulnerable to 
deterioration in either the external o r domestic debt indicators. M a n y o f the factors 
that could cause de te r io ra t ion in the ex te rna l debt b u r d e n w o u l d also threaten domestic 
debt sustainability. A fa i lu re to imp lemen t re fo rms o r insu f f ic ien t dono r f inanc ing in the 
f o r m o f grants c o u l d also lead t o pressures t o accumulate domestic debt. A reve rs ion t o

111. CONCLUSION 

8. 
Even after full delivery of H IPC debt relief, inclusive of “topping-up” and 
implementation of the MDR I , M a l aw i would remain at a moderate risk o f debt 
distress. On reaching the H I P C C om p l e t i o n Point, M a l aw i ’ s NPV o f debt-to-exports 
ratio w i l l d rop f r o m 191 percent in 2005 t o 39 percent in 2006. D e b t service as a share o f 
exports w i l l decline f r o m 2 2 to 16 pe rcen t between 2005 and 2006. Topp ing -up o f H I P C 
assistance decreases the NPV o f debt t o exports ra t io fu r the r to 3 1 percent and the deb t 
service t o exports t o 5.1 percent in 2006, but does n o t change M a l aw i ’ s risk o f deb t 
distress classification. No tw i ths tand ing good p o l i c y performance, the debt stock 
ind ica to rs are p ro jec ted to increase during the p ro jec t ion p e r i o d and t o b reach the i r 
policy-dependant thresholds i f k e y mac roeconom ic variables w o u l d assume the i r 
h is to r ica l average. Mo reove r , the NPV o f debt to GDP ra t io w o u l d b reach i t s th resho ld 
under stress tests. A l t h o u g h p ro jec ted t o decline, M a l aw i ’ s domestic debt i s cu r ren t ly
