EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. T h i s document presents the Belarus Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) f o r the 
pe r iod FY08 t o FY 1 1. The p rev ious strategy concluded in FY04. As l im i t e d progress 
had been made w i th i t s implementation, the B a n k postponed p repa ra t ion o f a n ew C A S 
t o a l l ow further t im e f o r discussion with the authorities o n an agreed f ramewo rk f o r 
cooperation, comp le t ion o f k e y i tems o f ana ly t ica l wo rk , and f ina l iza t ion o f the 
p lanned but delayed Che rnoby l p ro jec t . 
ii. R a p i d and broad-based economic g r ow t h since 2002, reduced pove r ty in Belarus 
t o among the lowes t leve ls in the region. Comprehensive soc ia l secu r i ty and good 
basic hea l th and education services have been sustained since independence and 
rema in available. Be la rus ma in ta ins a strong, centralized state capable o f m o b i l i z i n g 
resources and a l loca t ing them t o (centrally-determined) p r i o r i t y uses in the context o f 
generally p ruden t budge t management. Belarus has access t o la rge and g r ow i n g expo r t 
markets, i s located in a strategic co r r ido r linking Russia t o Europe, and has a sk i l led 
and highly capable labo r force. Howeve r , i t faces several challenges, a numbe r o f 
w h i c h have g loba l o r reg iona l dimensions: 
T w o decades after the Che rnoby l accident, the affected areas are amongst the 
poorest in the coun t ry . Selected rehab i l i ta t ion o f the r e g i o n continues, absorbing 
s ign i f ican t budge t resources. Water supply con tam ina t ion i s widespread and 
f l o o d i n g a permanent threat. 
Be la rus i s b o t h highly energy intensive and dependent, despite s ign i f ican t recent 
gains. R a p i d energy p r i c e increases present challenges t o mac roeconom ic 
s tab i l i ty and unde r l ine the need f o r even stronger e f fo r ts t o reduce energy 
in tens i ty and dependency. Strong ins t i tu t ions a re needed t o he lp preserve the 
ample na tu ra l wea l th o f the coun t ry and p r o f i t f r o m the oppo r tun i t ies o f fe red by 
the K y o t o P ro toco l . 
Expo r ts are highly concentrated and compe t i t ion i s m o u n t i n g in i t s m a i n ma rke t 
T h e Bank considers 
(Russia). 
i t u n l i k e l y that Be la rus can sustain the 
achievements o f recent years and meet the amb i t ious n ew goals i t has set w i thou t 
unde r tak ing t rans i t ion re fo rms that have so fa r p r o v e d elusive. These re fo rms w i l l 
pose many soc ia l and economic challenges. 
Belarus faced challenges since independence similar t o those faced by other C IS 
countries. These inc luded the t rans i t ion f r o m p l a n t o market, the open ing o f the 
p o l i t i c a l process, and the challenge o f con t inued de l ive ry o f basic services in an 
environment o f enormous change. I t has a highly centralized p o l i t i c a l system. M a n y 
external organizations and commentators are highly c r i t ica l o f wha t they describe as an 
absence o f f reedom and fa i lu re t o meet democratic standards. On the other hand, 
r e s u l t s o f in te rna l surveys tend t o be m o r e benign. T h e Bank ’s assessment o f 
transparency, accoun tab i l i ty and co r rup t ion in the p u b l i c sector shows Be la rus as be ing 
among the countries w i th the lowes t r a t i n g in the E C A Reg ion . S t rong central

Be la rus has a r t icu la ted a m e d i um - t e r n economic and social strategy that foresees 
im p r o v e d competitiveness r e l y i n g o n techno logy gains and the dynam ism o f the sma l l 
and m e d i um enterprise sector. I t foresees as w e l l a m o r e comprehensive and e f f ic ien t 
de l ive ry o f social services and an enhanced capacity t o manage environment 
challenges. Reduc ing energy dependency and inc reas ing energy e f f ic iency are k e y 
p r io r i t ies . 
Since 2002, the Bank has h a d an ac t ive ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry program, 
i n c l u d i n g reports o n competitiveness, social issues, p u b l i c expenditure, and the 
environment. Reports were generally w e l l rece ived and served as the basis f o r 
dialogue w i th the authorities. N o n e o f the lend ing p lanned ma te r ia l ized during the 
C A S p e r i o d (the Post Che rnoby l Recove ry p ro jec t was f i n a l l y approved in April 
2006). IFC continued t o de l ive r an active adv iso ry program, w i th several investments. 
The C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t concludes that the W o r l d B a n k G roup (WBG) can make 
a va luab le con t r ibu t ion in a numbe r o f areas. 
T h e WBG has l im i t e d a b i l i t y t o in f luence s ign i f ican t change in either t rans i t ion t o

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. 
Since independence, Be la rus has faced challenges s im i la r t o those faced by other C IS 
countries: the t rans i t ion f r o m plan t o market, the open ing o f the p o l i t i c a l process, and the 
con t inued de l ive ry o f bas ic services in an env i ronmen t o f enormous change. Be la rus 
unde r took l im i ted , yet su f f ic ien t reforms, in an inc reas ing ly b e n i g n external environment, 
t o de l ive r s ign i f ican t econom ic g r ow t h and avo id the sharp d rop in pe r capita incomes 
experienced by many o f i t s neighbors. T h e coun t ry has n o w one o f the h ighes t income 
leve ls among C IS countries. The GN I pe r capita acco rd ing t o the A t l a s m e t h o d increased 
f r o m 1610 dollars in 2002 t o an estimated 3980 do l la rs in 2007. Bas ic services con t inue t o 
b e de l ive red b r o a d l y t o the popu la t ion . 
2. 
T h e success in generating income g r ow t h and ma in ta in ing service de l ive ry he lped t o 
keep in p lace a highly centralized system o f economic management. T h e bulk o f the 
p roduc t ive assets remain the p rope r ty o f the state, even i f f o rm a l l y h e l d by enterprises with 
a separate lega l status. L ikew ise , the p o l i t i c a l system i s concentrated around the O f f i c e o f 
the President w i th l im i t e d delegation o f powe rs and l im i t e d p o l i t i c a l opposition. Ex te rna l 
observers consistently r a n k Belarus l o w rega rd ing p o l i t i c a l and economic r igh ts .

3. 
E c o n om i c G r o w t h . The economy g rew at about 10 percent in 2006, averaging 8.2 
percent in 2002-05. K e y d r ive rs o f g r ow t h were (i) a favorable external env i ronmen t 
( inc lud ing , imp rovemen ts in the terms o f trade); (ii) r a p i d increases in wages and salaries; 
and (iii) structural re fo rms and economic res t ruc tu r ing o f key enterprises.' 
4. Up t o 2007, the increases in the p r i c e o f energy bene f i ted Be la rus in several ways. 
F irs t , the market for Be la rus ian p roduc ts in Russia expanded. Second, Be la rus p r o f i t e d 
f r o m im p o r t i n g Russian o i l at p re fe ren t ia l prices, processing i t and expo r t ing i t s by- 
products at in te rna t iona l ma rke t prices. Third, external prices f o r metals and fe r t i l ize rs 
(bo th re la t ive ly impo r tan t expo r t items) increased as did labo r remittances f r o m Russia. 
T h e merchandise terms o f trade index increased by around 20 percent f r o m 2003 t o 2006. 
5. By t a x i n g the la rge terms o f trade gains the Government supported a p o l i c y o f r a p i d 
salary increases, w h i c h expanded domestic demand bene f i t ing construction, ag r icu l tu re and 
services. In addition, w i th these resources, the Government channelled credits t o industries 
and unde r took investments in areas such as energy e f f ic iency . 
6. 
T h e deva lua t ion o f the cu r rency and the u n i f i c a t i o n o f the exchange ra te set an 
env i ronmen t favourable t o economic growth. In addition, key enterprises we re restructured 
and energy e f f ic iency increased. As a result, labo r p r o d u c t i v i t y has been inc reas ing r a p i d l y 
suppo r t ing rising salaries. S t i l l , since 2000, the currency has been reva lu ing gradually by 
an accumulated 15 percent by ea r ly 2006. 
7. M a c r o e c o n om i c p e r f o rm a n c e . An improved macroeconomic environment also 
supported economic g row th . P r ice con t ro ls and the peg o f the Be la rus Rube1 to the do l la r

8 . D ras t ic Sh i f t in En e rg y prices in 2007 . Russia’s recent p o l i c y o f bringing energy 
prices t o ma rke t leve ls has hit Belarus in th ree ways. F i rs t , the na tu ra l gas im p o r t p r ice 
m o r e than doub led in 2007 t o U $ 1 0 0 pe r thousand cub ic meters (tcm), and, mos t likely, i t 
w i l l be g radua l ly increased t o the European ma rke t l e v e l by 201 1. Second, Belarus began 
t o p a y 29 percent o f Russia’s o i l expo r t tax (rising t o 36 percent by 2009). Third, since the 
expo r t tax rendered p re -ex is t ing consignment arrangements f o r processing Russian o i l 
unprofitable, Be la rus must n o w pre-finance mos t o f i t s crude o i l imports. A l l o f this i s 
reduc ing the p r o f i t a b i l i t y o f the o i l processing industry. As a consequence o f these three 
factors, the 2007 energy terms-of-trade shock i s estimated at over 5 percent o f GDP 
Increasing expo r t p r ices f o r some other impo r tan t Belarus’ exports (such as fe r t i l ize rs and 
metals) o n l y m a r g i n a l l y compensated f o r energy trade losses : ove ra l l merchandise terms o f 
trade index deteriorated in 2007 by about 15 percent. Econom ic g r ow t h i s likely to 
s lowdown o n l y m a r g i n a l l y t o around 7.8 percen t in 2007 due the dynam ism o f the 
economy and the capac i ty o f the coun t ry t o finance the current account de f ic i t , w h i c h i s 
likely t o w i d e n t o about 8 percent o f GDP . The external debt w i l l increase t o 26 percent o f 
GDP .

Governance and Anti-Corruption 
12. T h e r o l e o f the state in the economy has n o t changed m u c h since 2002. T h e state 
continues t o o w n the m a j o r i t y o f the p roduc t ive assets and regulate h e a v i l y the p r iva te 
sector. T h e hikes in energy prices, compe t i t ion in the Russian ma rke t and an appreciating 
exchange ra te are testing this approach t o economic management. T h e authorities are 
respond ing t o these challenges with changes such as re laxa t ion o f the “golden ru le ” 
especially in banking, fac i l i ta t ing the reg is te r ing o f new enterprises and resum ing 
p r iva t iza t ion . The recent 2008 D o i n g Business Repo r t h igh l igh ts and acknowledges these 
reforms, p lac ing Belarus amongst the top t e n reformers in t w o categories. T h e smooth 
t rans i t ion towards a ma rke t economy remains as the m a j o r governance challenge. 
Howeve r , the authorities are l i k e l y t o face th is challenge in a gradual and piecemeal 
fash ion rather than th rough enacting m a j o r overhauls a l l at once. As a consequence, 
Be la rus w i l l mos t l i k e l y con t inue t o b e ranked as a s low re fo rme r by external observers. 
13. Many external organizations are highly c r i t ica l o f wha t they describe as an absence o f 
fi-eedom and fa i lu re t o meet democratic standards. They pe rce ive the p o l i t i c a l s i tua t ion in 
Be la rus as one that has rema ined stable at the cost o f widespread perceptions o f l im i t e d 
p o l i t i c a l freedoms. 
T h e recen t ly adopted European Bank f o r Recons t ruc t ion and 
Deve lopmen t (EBRD) Coun t ry Strategy notes that, in some aspects o f democratic 
governance, Belarus witnessed “s ign i f ican t b a ~ k t r a c k i n g ” . ~ 
14. There are also concerns with the limited vo ice in the coun t ry . W h i l e some non - 
governmental organizations (NGOs) and a f ew independent m e d i a outlets con t inue t o 
function, state agencies have been inc reas ing reg is t ra t ion and ope ra t ing requirements over 
the last t w o years, making i t d i f f i c u l t f o r non-state med ia and c i v i l society organizations t o 
operate. A s a consequence, the numbe r o f independent med ia outlets has dec l ined and the 
ac t iv i t ies o f some c i v i l society organizations have been suspended. S t i l l , c i v i l society in 
Be la rus has demonstrated resilience and adap tab i l i ty and has p layed a c r i t i c a l r o l e in the 
progress that has been made in the env i ronmen ta l and p u b l i c hea l th sectors, especially in 
comba t ing the spread o f H I V / A I D S . 
1 5 . No tw i ths tand ing external assessments o f the non -compe t i t ive p o l i t i c a l situation, 
w h i c h p lace Be la rus l o w among E C A countries6, Be la rus appears t o b e a coun t ry where 
day-to-day co r rup t ion i s kep t w e l l unde r con t ro l . Mo reove r , recen t ly the government has 
been t igh ten ing controls o n co r rup t ion th rough rev ised leg is la t ion and t igh te r enforcement. 
In addition, as noted, the state p rov ides extensive services t o the popu la t ion . N o t 

Belarus has comm i t ted to t h e MDG objectives 
through i t s ‘Na t iona l Strategy f o r Sustainable 
Deve lopmen t fo r the pe r iod up to 2020’, w h i c h was adopted in 2004 and pub l ished in 2005. The

21. T h e Gove rnmen t p o l i c y has been t o increase energy e f f ic iency and reduce energy

In the past s ix years, the

Indeed, the 2008 D o i n g Bus iness 
repo r t places Be la rus among the top 10 reformers in t w o areas: (a) s ta r t ing a business and 
(b) p ro tec t ing investors. Desp i te this no tab le imp rovemen t , in the E C A region, o n l y 
Uk ra ine , Uzbek is tan and Ta j ik is tan rank b e l ow Belarus. T h e 2008 D o i n g Business repo r t

coun t ry ranks p o o r l y though o n p a y i n g taxes (178) and t rad ing across borders (137.) This

Improving the Effectiveness of Government 
(iv) 
42. T h e state absorbs a la rge share o f na t iona l p roduc t ion . 
In 2005, tax revenues 
accounted f o r about 47 percent o f GDP compared t o 35 percent in Russia, 29 percent in 
L i thuan ia , 32 percent in Poland, and 29 percent in Uk ra ine . ” T h e challenge f o r Be la rus i s 
t o open space f o r p roduc t ive ac t iv i t ies by reduc ing the size o f the state w h i l e ma in ta in ing 
and im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f service de l ive ry and social assistance.16 This im p l i e s (a) 
im p r o v i n g the effectiveness o f p u b l i c expenditure, (b) up -g rad ing the capacity o f the p u b l i c 
adm in is t ra t ion and the c i v i l service, and (c) r e f o rm i n g the tax system. 
43. T h e Government has commenced steps t o im p r o v e expenditure and budge ta ry 
practices. Budge t coverage i s broader w i th the i n c l u s i o n o f the Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Fund 
(2004) and sector innova t ion funds (2005). 
T h e func t iona l c lass i f ica t ion i s fully 
compa t ib le with Government Finance Statistics M a n u a l 2001 (G F SM 2001) and the 
treasury system covers a l l central government transactions (except p o l i c e func t ions and 
defence m in is t r ies ) and budgets o f l o c a l governments. 
The Ministry o f F inance 
commenced a “program budgeting” expe r imen t in 2005 and i s expanding i t across 
g ~ v e r n m e n t . ’ ~ The agenda ahead inc ludes a l ign ing the economic c lass i f ica t ion o f the 
budget with in te rna t iona l standards, fu r the r ex tend ing the coverage o f the budget, and 
app rov ing a new budget code. Building o n p rev ious wo rk , the Gove rnmen t i s now in a 
p o s i t i o n t o make imp rovemen ts t o the effectiveness o f public expenditure t o reach in tended 
soc ia l objectives. The effectiveness o f these e f fo r ts can increase with comp lemen ta ry 
actions to decentralize the use o f resources, increase the accoun tab i l i ty o f l o c a l authorities 
and i n v o l v e the communities, w h i c h i s already part o f the government’s agenda. 
44. T h e s t ream l in ing o f pub l ic expenditure needs to p a y attention t o certain p r i o r i t y areas. 
The f i rs t i s the reduction o f quasi-fiscal deficits, especially those that arise in the financial 
sector f r om directed credit. Second, as has already has been noted, Belarus needs t o re th ink 
and redesign the support fo r the productive sectors t o seek a greater impact o n competitiveness, 
sh i f t ing f r om a firm o r sector-specific t o a thematic approach. Third, t igh te r resources make i t 
impe ra t ive t o im p r o v e the effectiveness o f cap i ta l budge t ing (9.6 percent GDP in 2006). 

The S M E survey conducted by I F C in 2006 revealed that 72 percent o f entrepreneurs found c om p l y i n g 
w i t h administrative procedures a ma jo r obstacle to do ing business. O n l y 3 5 percent o f those p o l l e d no ted 
prob lems w i t h securing bank loans. 
Da ta f o r ne ighbor ing countries i s f r om 2004 ( the latest year available) and taken f r om E C A reg iona l 
f isca l dataset. Social security tax, VAT and corporate income tax account f o r 5 5 percent o f to ta l tax 
revenues The rest comes f r om P IT , excises, taxes o n in terna t iona l trade and transactions, sma l l business 
tax and a number o f other sma l l taxes. 
The quality o f the pub l ic goods prov is ion ranks higher in Be la rus than in Russia or U k r a i n e , but t h e de l ivery o f 
social services (health; recreation, cu l ture and re l ig ion ; education; social security and we l fare services) 
account fo r more than 50 percent o f general government expenditures or 25.8 percent o f GDP , mo re than 
in the tw o other countries. 
The assessment i s made based o n t h e conclusions o f the IMF F isca l A f f a i r s Depar tmen t m iss ion o n

Fourth, e f fo r ts at ta rge t ing expenditure n o w unde r w a y have t o b e comp le ted by finding 
e f fec t ive ways o f dea l ing with the m o u n t i n g pressures o f the r a p i d l y ag ing popu la t ion mus t 
b e devised. 
45. Lastly, Belarus needs a ma jo r overhaul o f i t s tax system. I t needs t o reduce rates in l i n e 
with the reforms that neighboring countries have introduced. Belarus r u n s the r isk o f los ing 
competitiveness in the region. I t should also seek the e l im ina t ion o f ex is t ing exemptions and 
special treatments and easier comp l iance t o reduce the cost o f d o i n g business. As 
p rev ious ly noted, acco rd ing t o the 2008 D o i n g Business repo r t Be la rus r a n k s as one o f the 
mos t in t rus ive practices in the wo r ld .

Consolidating Ga ins in F igh t ing H IV /A IDS and Tuberculosis 
46. Belarus, l i k e mos t countries in the region, faced a mounting threa t o f TB and AIDS 
during the second h a l f o f the 1990s. This threat has receded. In 2007 the HIV prevalence 
rate was 0.3 percent (among adults aged 15 to 49)18-a 
ra te comparable w i th that o f 
Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and B e l g i um and one -s ix th that o f Estonia, one - th i rd 
that o f U k r a i n e and almost one-quarter that in Russia. This achievement i s the resu l t o f a 
concerted e f fo r t o f the Government, c i v i l society and the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y that has 
focussed o n (a) active p reven t ive in te rven t ions among high r i s k groups; (b) a massive 
i n f o rm a t i o n and education campaign; and (c) p r o v i s i o n o f an t i - re t rov i ra l treatment and 
pa l l ia t ive care t o H I V / A I D S patients. T h e G loba l Fund t o Fight A ID S , TB and M a l a r i a 
(GFATM) HIV/AIDS P reven t ion and Treatment grant has p rov ided and w i l l con t inue t o 
p rov ide the bulk o f the ex te rna l assistance. Be la rus has successfully imp lemen ted Phase 1 
o f this grant, and rece ived app rova l f o r Phase 2. T h e grant in to ta l amounts t o US$17 
m i l l i o n f o r the pe r iod 2004-2009. 
47. 
In addition, the coun t ry has made progress in fighting TB and inc idence i s l ow e r than 
in Russia, M o l d o v a and Uk ra ine , but i t i s m o r e than doub le the ra te in Europe. T h e m a i n 
concern i s that progress has stagnated. Thus, f r o m 2002 th rough 2006, the TB prevalence 
rate rema ined stagnant at around 62 pe r 100,000 p o p ~ l a t i o n . ' ~ . T h e mos t c r i t ica l situation 
i s in prisons, w i th a risk o f T B / A I D S co - in fec t ion . T h e numbe r o f H IV -assoc ia ted TB 
cases has qu in tup led in the last 5 years. A GFTAM grant t o address the TB s i tua t ion was 
approved in 2006 f o r US$14 .2 m i l l i o n . I t w i l l h e l p extend and strengthen d i rec t ly observed 
treatment, short course (DOTS ) and assist the mos t vulnerable groups. 
48. Some o f the recommended actions f o r the fu tu re are": 
strengthening mu l t i -sec to ra l response t o HIV and HIV/TB th rough ve r t ica l ly

increasing coverage o f p reven t ion and treatment services t o l ow e r the p r o f i l e o f the

51. T h e p ro jec t ions under the Government P rog ram were prepared be fo re the 2007 
substantial increase in energy prices. T h e recent and expected fu r the r increases in energy 
p r ices comb ined with the weakness o f the p r iva te sector c a l l f o r a r e v i s i o n o f the i n i t i a l 
PSED projections. Tab le 3 pu ts f o r t h a rev ised se t o f projections, taking account the 
expected 2007 outturn, where, despite the 15 percent t e rm s o f trade shock the economy i s 
l i k e l y t o g r ow by close t o 8 percent. The carry-over dynam ism f r o m 2006 when the 
economy g rew at close t o 10 percent and the fac t the coun t ry has been able to m o b i l i z e 
su f f ic ien t resources t o finance a current account de f ic i t that w i l l come t o 8 percent o f GDP 
in 2007 w i l l support the high g r ow t h rate. F isca l de f ic i t i s expected t o b e moderate, about 
0.6 percent o f GDP . 
52. T h e impac t ove r the med ium - te rm w i l l depend o n (a) the f i n a l arrangements o n p r ices 
and paymen t moda l i t ies with the m a i n supp l ie r o f gas and o i l , Russia; (b) the ava i lab i l i ty o f 
external finance, (c) progress in open ing opportunities f o r the p r iva te sector and greater 
e f f ic iency in the ex is t ing enterprises, and (d) rea l ignmen t o f the exchange and wage rates. 
53. Based o n the assumptions that energy prices continue 
t o increase t o reach 
in te rna t iona l leve ls by 201 1 (a) the economy w i l l b e able to m o b i l i z e the necessary external 
funds, (b) macroeconomic objectives ( f isca l pos i t ion ) are me t and (c) the current package 
o f measures e f fec t ive ly reduce energy intensity and ma in ta in competitiveness, the economy 
i s l i k e l y t o continue t o sustain a high but decreasing rate o f economic g row th ; i t i s foreseen 
that by 201 1 Be la rus w i l l b e g r ow i n g at around 5 percent. S t i l l , given stagnant l e v e l o f the 
popu la t ion , this mean a high ra te o f per capita income growth-by 
2 0 1 1, Be la rus c o u l d 
w e l l have an GN I per capita ove r 5000 do l la rs by 201 1. A k e y concern over the m e d i um 

14 
te rm i s the expected r a p i d increase in the stock o f external debt, w h i c h m a y reach almost 
50 percent o f GDP by 2 0 1 1 , g i v e n that the current account de f ic i ts are foreseen to rema in 
around 7.5 percent o f GDP . 
54. The coun t ry has a very l o w external debt t o GDP ratio, less than 2 0 percent n ow . 
Hence, does n o t have any s t ruc tu ra l debt p rob lem . T h e forecast current account de f ic i t o f 
around 8 percent o f GDP, ove r the m e d i um term, w i l l present a challenge; but the coun t ry 
has addressed the challenge in the short t o m e d i um term. F i rs t , the pa r t ia l sale o f 
BELTRANGAZ and n o w the second largest m o b i l e telephone operator are p r o v i d i n g 
around U S $ 5 b i l l i o n . Second, some western banks that are f inanc ing purchases o f Russian 
o i l f o r refining and re -expo r t ing . They are p r o v i d i n g short-term trade f inanc ing as w e l l . 
Th i rd , Belarus c o u l d ob ta in s ign i f ican t f inanc ing f r om b i la te ra l sources. Russia w o u l d b e 
the m a i n source, but recent examples inc lude la rge scale inves tmen t p ro jec t f inanc ing f r o m 
China. 
5 5 . T h e high l e v e l o f the current account i s explained n o t o n l y because o f the increasing 
energy prices but m o s t l y because o f the high l e v e l o f investments needed t o increase 
energy e f f ic iency and re fu rb ish the economy. The expectations today are that the coun t ry 
w i l l b e able to finance this l e v e l o f current accounts. The coun t ry has s h ow n this year that 
i t has the capacity t o m o b i l i z e resources in the external markets and selected la rge scale 
p r iva t iza t ions are p r o v i d i n g add i t iona l resources. 
56. In August 2007 f o r the f i rs t t im e Belarus rece ived sovereign c red i t r a t i n g f r o m t w o 
in te rna t iona l r a t i n g agencies Moody ’s Investors Service (B 1 f o r f o r e i g n exchange debt 
ob l iga t ions o f the Gove rnmen t o f Belarus) and Standard and Poo r ’s (B+ as the long - te rm 
fo re ign exchange c red i t rating). B o t h agencies’ estimates o f changes in ra t ings are s im i la r 
(“stable”). A c q u i s i t i o n o f the g rad ing o f the long - te rm government debt i s expected t o 
fac i l i ta te the government and the domestic enterprises and bank accessing in te rna t iona l 
c red i t markets. 
57. T h e foreseen g r ow t h p a t h i s sustainable because the Russian ma rke t w i l l con t inue t o 
expand and the o i l processing business in Belarus w i l l rema in p ro f i tab le . T h e authorities 
are seeking t o m a i n t a i n the competitiveness o f the coun t ry in i t s m a i n markets by 
c o n t r o l l i n g unit labo r costs in fo re ign cu r rency and conserving energy. Emphasis o n

sma l l and m e d i um enterprise sector i s beg inn ing . The IMF last A r t i c l e I V has encouraged 
the government t o consider greater exchange rate f l e x i b i l i t y . 
58 . G i v e n the res i l ience the economy has shown in the past, the gradual approach o f the 
government mos t l i k e l y w i l l in the short- t o med ium - te rm . The success ove r the long - te rm 
w i l l depend o n the i r a b i l i t y t o reduce external f inanc ing t o limit the g r ow t h o f na t iona l 
debt. Shou ld the gradual approach f a i l t o de l ive r the expected resu l ts , the coun t ry w i l l face 
the need f o r a m o r e accelerated adjustment and fundamental re fo rms .

g r ow t h w i l l depend g rea t ly o n the capacity t o generate fu r the r expo r t growth, w h i c h in turn

w i d e r 
treasury coverage, 
im p r o v e d budge t classification, and p i l o t s in budget 
p rog ramm ing . T h e government made selective e f fo r ts in ta rge t ing social expenditure, 
supported by Bank assistance. Some impo r tan t results we re achieved in im p r o v i n g the 
business environment, but substantial scope f o r fu r the r re fo rms remains. L im i t e d progress 
was made in fos te r ing the active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society. 
61. T h e pe r fo rmance o f inves tmen t p ro jec ts was satisfactory and has con t r ibu ted t o 
development objectives. N o m a j o r f iduc ia ry concerns arose. L e n d i n g focused o n 
fo res t ry management, energy efficiency, and Che rnoby l affected areas. AAA w o r k was 
w e l l received, and the government has taken the recommendations i n t o account-if 
n o t 
always accepting them-in 
p o l i c y decisions and imp lemen ta t ion . AAA covered a b road 
range o f themes: social assistance; Chernobyl; p o v e r t y analysis; competitiveness; 
business environment; health; the impac t o f po ten t ia l increases in the p r ice o f energy; 
p u b l i c expenditure management; and the environment. 
62. T h e last CAS set benchmarks o n p u b l i c expenditure management and the business 
env i ronmen t as p re -cond i t ions f o r scaling up assistance. T h e benchmarks were n o t fully 
met, but s ign i f ican t progress was made especially in the area o f p u b l i c expenditure 
management. Less progress was made in im p r o v i n g the business environment o r 
bringing greater f inanc ia l d isc ip l ine t o the enterprise sector. Experience has shown that 
the Bank's leverage t o induce structural change i s at best modest, and this i s u n l i k e l y t o 
change s ign i f ican t ly in the near fu tu re . 
63. T w o m a j o r comp l ica t ions during imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rev ious C A S were: (a) the 
s ign i f ican t abso rp t ion o f resources in the preparation o f the TB and AIDS p ro jec t w h i c h 
never materialized, and (b) the inc lus ion in the C A S p rog ram o f l e n d i n g operations f o r 
techn ica l assistance that did n o t meet the government c r i te r ia f o r bo r row ing . B o t h o f 
these affected the lend ing program, and n o n ew l o a n was approved during the C A S 
p e r i o d (a l though the loan t o support Che rnoby l affected areas, o n w h i c h w o r k 
commenced during the C A S period, was subsequently approved). G i v e n the s low pace o f 
C A S implementation, in 2004 the Bank agreed w i th the government o n a mo re l im i t e d

Lessons f r o m the C A S C om p l e t i o n R e p o r t 

64. T h e C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t (CAS CR ) d rew the f o l l ow i n g conclusions and 
recommendations: 
The Bank can play an important role in Belarus. T h e WBG can make a va luab le 
con t r ibu t ion t o assist Belarus in fac ing current challenges that m a y imply m a j o r 
rearrangement o f economic institutions, and t o manage the associated risk o f possible 
distress t o popu la t ion groups in the short-term. 
Align program with government priorities and Bank mandate. WBG engagement- 
techn ica l assistance, ana ly t ica l wo rk , and lend ing l inves tmen t -w i l l b e m o r e e f fec t ive 
i f a l igned with government p r io r i t ies . As no ted in the last CAS , there i s “ l i t t l e t o b e 
gained by push ing the p o l i c y d ia logue (and cond i t iona l i ty ) beyond wha t the 
government can consider part o f i t s o w n program.” In areas considered by the WBG 
as impo r tan t f o r sustainable we l fa re gains, but where there i s l i m i t e d owne rsh ip o r 
interest o n the pa r t o f the authorities, the WBG c o u l d s t i l l m a i n t a i n an advocacy 
presence. 
Continue AAA and actively disseminate. The Bank’s impac t can be enhanced by 
con t inu ing t o emphasize AAA targeted t o c r i t i c a l areas t o increase the know ledge base 
and t o p rov ide p o l i c y op t ions t o the government. AAA w o r k already has h a d an 
impac t in selected areas l i k e social assistance, pove r ty , Chernobyl, p u b l i c expenditure 
re fo rm , pensions, and environment. T h e Bank, however, must n o t expect that AAA 
w o r k alone w i l l t r igge r any m a j o r structural changes, as the Q u a l i t y Assurance G roup 
(QAG) p i l o t AAA r e v i ew has po in ted 
I t can, however, raise awareness o f the 
op t ions available to face eme rg ing challenges. T h e B a n k has been e f fec t ive in 
dissemination e f fo r ts and shou ld emphasize dissemination even mo re . 
M a in t a in Presence in Lending. A l t h o u g h the scope f o r lending i s narrow, l e n d i n g 
shou ld continue selectively as an ins t rumen t o f B a n k engagement. The re i s clear need 
and demand f o r investment funds. Be la rus k n ow s w e l l h o w t o imp lemen t programs. 
F i d u c i a r y r i s k s are considered manageable. O f the possible inves tmen t opportunities, 
the Bank p rog ram cou ld inc lude p ro jec ts w i th d i rec t impac t o n the poo r o r w i th 
substantial na t iona l and reg iona l benefits. L e n d i n g i s also a doo r t o a broader d ia logue 
in the country. 

Wo rk with others. In d i f f i c u l t p o l i c y areas, l i k e business environment and regulation, 
the WBG shou ld j o i n forces with other I F I s such as the EBRD and the In te rna t iona l 
M o n e t a r y Fund (IMF).

p rog ram alone w i l l make a decisive d i f fe rence in the p e r i o d o f the proposed engagement 
strategy. Consistent w i th the guiding p r inc ip les o f the recen t ly approved strategy, the 
B a n k w i l l r em a i n engaged in Belarus. T h e proposed engagement w i l l (a) inc lude an 
advocacy r o l e f o r re fo rms o n governance and measures t o address corruption, (b) seek t o 
develop areas in w h i c h the government and the Bank have common goals, (c) and ensure 
that appropriate f iduc ia ry oversight i s app l ied t o proposed resource transfers f r om the 
Bank . A m o n g the spec i f ic ac t iv i t ies undertaken by the WBG w o u l d be the fo l low ing : 

Risks and Vulnerability challenges. T h e B a n k w o u l d assist with coun t ry 

readiness t o deal with po ten t ia l external shocks and vulnerabilities, strengthening

res t ruc tu r ing o f the p roduc t ive sectors in tended t o reduce the r isks o f economic 
disruption, w h i c h can affect b road segments o f the popu la t ion . 
Encouraging the private sector. T h e Bank and IFC , as appropriate, w o u l d p l a y

Improving service delivery to help a l l citizens in Belarus. B a n k activities, in 

pa r t icu la r i t s l e n d i n g operations, w i l l seek t o bene f i t the widest g roup o f citizens, 
especially the mos t vulnerable. 
In addition, the B a n k w o u l d con t inue t o p rov ide

especially in t rans i t ion countries. 

Encouraging a broad national dialogue. W h i l e the government w i l l rema in the 

p r i n c i p a l counterpart, the Bank w o u l d con t inue t o engage a b road range o f business

THE BASIC CAS STRUCTURE: OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN 
2. 
T h e 2002-2004 CAS , presented t o the B o a r d in Feb rua ry 2002, was the third C A S 
since Be la rus j o i n e d the Bank, and f o l l ow e d the F Y 9 9 C A S update that ca l led f o r the 
u n i f i c a t i o n o f the exchange rate as a cond i t ion p r i o r t o the B a n k lending t o Belarus. 
Be la rus u n i f i e d the exchange rate in September 2000. T h e C A S was prepared thereafter, 
j o i n t l y with the In te rna t iona l Finance Co rpo ra t ion (IFC). O n a pa ra l le l track, the 
In te rna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) and the Government agreed o n a S t a f f M o n i t o r e d 
P rog ram (SMP), w h i c h r a n be tween April and September 2001, but was n o t imp lemen ted 
in full, a l though the coun t ry m e t the m a j o r i t y o f the SMP conditions. 
T h e design o f the C A S took i n t o account (a) the stated government p o l i c y t o 
advance s l ow l y towards a mode rn ma rke t economy, and (b) eme rg ing dialogue, be tween 
the W o r l d Bank and the Be la rus ian authorities, m a i n l y o n env i ronmen ta l issues and 
social sectors re fo rm . The C A S no ted that there was “ l i t t l e t o b e gained by pushing the 
p o l i c y d ia logue (and cond i t iona l i ty ) beyond wha t the Government can consider pa r t o f i t s

T h e C A S was prepared in a l o w case scenario and focused o n areas compa t ib le

COUNTRY OUTCOMES DURING THE CAS PERIOD 

5. 
Progress towards l o n g - t e rm development outcomes was m i x e d during the period. 
On the pos i t ive side, economic pe r fo rmance was satisfactory-high 
econom ic g r ow t h 
and im p r o v e d mac roeconom ic indicators. In addition, the l e v e l o f pove r ty inc idence f e l l 
t o amongst the lowes t in the reg ion . S ign i f ican t progress was made in the face o f the 
Tuberculosis (TB) and A I D S threats. O n the negative side, however, i t continues t o b e 
d i f f i c u l t f o r c i v i l society organizations t o func t ion in Be la rus and the l im i t e d p o l i t i c a l 
freedoms in the coun t ry are a ma t te r o f considerable in te rna t iona l concerns. This section 
summarizes key long - te rm development outcomes during the CAS pe r iod . 

A. Econom ic Pe r fo rmance 
6. 
F r o m 2002 t o 2005, Be la rus ’ Gross Domes t ic P roduc t (GDP) g rew o n average at 
around 8 percent pe r annum, a s t rong performance o n pa r with i t s  neighbor^.^^ On the one 
hand, the coun t ry experienced im p r o v e d t e rm s o f trade (up t o 2006), high increases in 
wages and salaries, and con t inued support f r o m Russia, v i a discounted energy prices. On 
the other hand, increased capacity u t i l i z a t i o n and r a p i d increases in labo r p r o d u c t i v i t y 
supported h ighe r incomes. A tight f isca l po l icy , the s tab i l iza t ion o f the ma rke t f o r 
fo re ign exchange, the N a t i o n a l Bank o f Belarus’ (NBB) p o l i c y o f ma in ta in ing pos i t ive 
rea l interest rates, and the cessation o f NBB d i rec t f inanc ing o f the budge t de f ic i t since 
2004, lowe red average annual i n f l a t i o n from 42.5 percent in 2002 t o 7.0 percent in 2006. 
7 . 
These results notwithstanding, the economy remains vu lne rab le to shocks (e-g., 
f r o m u pw a r d energy p r i c e pressures). These vu lne rab i l i t ies are roo ted o n the la rge size o f 
the p u b l i c sector, the high dependency o n the Russian ma rke t and vu lne rab i l i t ies in the 
b a n k i n g sector. High quasi-fiscal de f ic i ts have created sizeable amounts o f h idden 
l iab i l i t ies that put f inanc ia l and f isca l s tab i l i ty at risk.37 L im i t a t i o n s on business en t ry 
have prevented the needed d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the economy. The aging popu la t ion i s 
s t ra in ing the f isca l accounts.38 
B. Pove r ty 
8 . 
A pa t te rn o f b road economic growth that covered labor-intensive sectors (such as 
services, food processing and machinery, and generous government wage and income policies, 
spread evenly the benefits o f growth across the population. Poverty rates declined 
(national definition) was mo re than halved -- f r om 30.5 percent o f the population in 2002 to 
substantially, wh i le inequality remained stable and moderate. The poverty headcount ratio 
11.1 percent in 2006; wh ich meant that approximately 3.0 m i l l i o n people moved out o f 
poverty. Based o n pove r ty analysis conducted by the Bank, Be la rus has one o f the lowes t 
leve ls o f pove r ty inc idence in the region.39 T h i s decline in pove r ty inc idence i s in l i n e 

36 The CAS had foreseen much lowe r rates o f economic growth-2.3 percent o n average f o r the 2002-2004 
CAS period. The Bank ’s absence f r om Belarus previous to the C A S weakened i t s understanding o f the 
work ings o f the economy and l e d to ove r ly dim economic forecasts. 
37 The F inanc ia l Sector Assessment Program (FSAP, FY 0 5 ) and t h e Pub l ic Expend i ture Rev iew (PER, 
FY03 ) looked in to t h i s issue . 
38 A t the beg inn ing o f the C A S period, the objective was to reach US$lOO fo r an average m o n t h l y salary by 
the end o f 2002; i t exceeded US$260 / mon th by the end o f 2005.

with the reg iona l trends; t rans i t ion economies have been ga in ing the g round los t during 
the 1990s. Fu r the r growth, th rough p r o d u c t i v i t y increases, i s needed t o s o l i d i f y these 
gains. 
C. Civil Society 
9 . 
T h e status o f c i v i l society deteriorated during the C A S pe r iod . 
In 2003, the 
Government closed 5 1 i n f l u e n t i a l non -gove rnmen ta l organizations (NGOs). 
I t issued 
warnings t o 810 NGOs ; 6 times m o r e than in 2002. Pressure o n the N G O sector 
increased be fo re the p res iden t ia l elections in 2006 and has con t inued since. Taxa t ion o f 
non - fo r -p ro f i t organizations i s high. S t r ic t reg is t ra t ion and r e v i ew procedures f o r NGOs 
are in p lace and a f fec t a l l donors i n c l u d i n g the Bank, T AC I S , the U n i t e d Na t ions (UN), 
the U n i t e d States Agency f o r In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t (U S A ID ) and others. S t i l l , the 
capacity o f the sma l l numbe r (2,200) o f organizations in the coun t ry has g r ow n and they 
are h a v i n g an impac t o n the environment, social issues and l o c a l development. 
10. 
Qu i te o f ten the social rehab i l i ta t ion , t ra in ing and other programs developed by 
c i v i l society organizations have n o analogues in the public sector. F o r instance, 
env i ronmen ta l organizations have succeeded in establishing t w o ins t i tu t ions that m a i n t a i n 
dialogue be tween the Government and c i v i l society-the Non -Gove rnmen ta l C o u n c i l 
under the M i n i s t r y o f N a t u r a l Resources and Env i ronmen ta l Protection, the A d v i s o r y 
B o a r d o f the Jo in t Sustainable Deve lopmen t P ro jec t o f the U n i t e d Na t ions Deve lopmen t 
Programme (UNDP ) and the Be la rus ian Government. 
D. The Relationship with Russia 
11. 
In 1999, Be la rus and Russia agreed t o f o r m a u n i o n and h a d put fo r th an 
imp lemen ta t ion timetable. T h e C A S foresaw that the prospects o f an economic u n i o n 
with Russia w o u l d speed macroeconomic s tab i l iza t ion and fac i l i ta te structural reforms, 
lead ing t o a convergence o f ins t i tu t ions between the t w o countries. T h e t ime tab le for 
u n i f i c a t i o n did n o t ma te r ia l ize as expected. S t i l l , the prospects o f u n i f i c a t i o n p rov ided a 
benchmark that con t r ibu ted t o the macroeconomic s tab i l iza t ion o f the economy. T h e 
fu tu re o f the u n i o n i s unce r ta in today. Howeve r , the issue i s amply discussed in b o t h 
countries.

presents a summa ry o f the resu l ts , compares p lanned and rea l ized ac t iv i t ies and assesses 
the progress in mee t ing expected progress benchmarks during the C A S pe r iod . 
A. Global Public Goods 
13. 
TB/AIDS. Belarus, l i k e mos t countries in the region, faced a rising t rend o f TB 
and AIDS in fec t ions in the m i d d l e o f the 1990s. Today b o t h o f these trends have 
subsided. T h e inc idence o f AIDS, 78.3 pe r 100,000 o f population, i s l ow e r than 
Uk ra ine , Russia, M o l d o v a and Estonia, and s im i la r t o the European average. S im i la r ly , 
the inc idence f r o m TB, 66.2 cases pe r 100,000 o f population, i s l ow e r than Uk ra ine , 
Russia and M o l d o v a , but i s almost tw ice as high as the European average. Moreover, 
the decreasing t rend has s lowed d ow n in recent years. 
Inc idence i s high in prisons, 

32 

whe re the risk o f co - in fec t ion be tween TB and AIDS i s high, Overall, however, 
progress has been substantial. 
14. 
G i v e n the u rgency T B / A I D S represented at the time, the Bank began p repa r ing a 
T B / A I D S ope ra t ion u p o n Government’s request, a lmos t t w o years be fo re the CAS4’. T h e 
Bank redesigned the p ro jec t several t imes t o inco rpo ra te government objections, 
in i t ia t ives and ideas. T h e Bank acceded t o the Government’s request t o d rop the AIDS 
component, once the G loba l Fund Aga ins t Tuberculosis and M a l a r i a (GFATM) 
comm i t ted i t s support,4’ and t o focus o n TB con t ro l and re fu rb ishmen t o f p r im a r y hea l th 
care. T h e Bank assisted in the p repa ra t ion o f the app l ica t ion f o r the GFATM grant. I t 
also he lped t o ob ta in grants t o prepare the project, but the government did n o t use them.42 
15. 
In ea r ly 2004, after issu ing three inv i ta t ions t o negotiate, 
the Government 
in fo rmed the B a n k that the TB C o n t r o l and P r im a r y H e a l t h Care Deve lopmen t p ro jec t 
h a d l o s t i t s i n i t i a l u rgency g iven (i) a 25 percent decrease in the n o t i f i c a t i o n rate in the 
p e r i o d o f 1998-2003, and (ii) the ava i lab i l i ty o f su f f ic ien t budgetary resources t o finance 
TB p rog rams and imp lemen t the P r im a r y H e a l t h Care component. S t i l l , the Gove rnmen t 
re i te ra ted during C A S consultations, that the support o f the B a n k p rov ided t o the 
gove rnmen t and the coun t ry was c r i t i c a l to advance the programs o f AIDS and TB 
con t ro l and t o imp lemen t hea l th re fo rm . 
16. 
In hindsight, neither the Bank n o r the government acted p r om p t l y t o terminate the 
p ro jec t preparation. On the government’s side, a lack o f consensus be tween the Cabinet 
o f M i n i s t e r s and the Presidential Adm in is t ra t ion delayed government decisions. O n i t s 
part, the Bank took the delays and redesigns as normal, g iven that other T B / A I D S 
p ro jec ts in the reg ion fac ing similar d i f f i c u l t i e s during preparation were even tua l ly 
approved. In addition, the Bank took approval o f the proposed T B / A I D S p ro jec t as a 
s i g n o f government comm i tmen t t o w o r k together. Perhaps the Bank shou ld have trusted 
m o r e the capacity o f the government t o w o r k with i t s o w n resources and the support 
p r o v i d e d by GFATM. The grant was imp lemen ted with success and a subsequent grant 
was approved. 
17. 
Environment. 
T h e Bank , the Gove rnmen t and NGO representatives, have 
ma in ta ined a p roduc t ive dialogue and cooperation o n environmental issues with pos i t ive 
results. T h e Bank completed a k e y p iece o f ESW “Bu i ld ing Blocks fo r a Sustainable 
Future: A Selective Review of Environment and Na tu ra l Resource Management” (June 
2002), w h i c h p rov ided the basis u p o n w h i c h t o build the environment ins t i tu t ions in the 
country. The repo r t engaged the Government and l o c a l stakeholders in a dialogue o n the 
l i n k s be tween the techn ica l aspects o f env i ronmen ta l management and the na t iona l p o l i c y 
f ramewo rk . I t rev iewed water, energy, waste and natural resources management-areas 
with po ten t ia l f o r f o l l ow - u p by the Bank. QAG ra ted the repo r t as satisfactory. Based o n 
this report, the Government in 2004 adopted the Second N a t i o n a l Strategy f o r Sustainable 
Development, which places a pa r t icu la r emphasis o n ma ins t ream ing env i ronmen ta l 
concerns i n t o various sectors o f the economy.

T h e coun t ry has made good progress in reduc ing energy

T h e Government

Desp i te the cha l leng ing environment, IFC ’s adv iso ry operations succeeded in

The IMF. T h e IMF and Bank have wo rked c lose ly and e f fec t ive ly in Belarus 
during this C A S pe r iod . T h e t w o ins t i tu t ions cooperated in the p repa ra t ion o f the PER. 
T h e IMF was ac t ive in p r o v i d i n g TA in tax p o l i c y (2003); f isca l reports on the Reports o f 
Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC), 2003; budge t code and budget c lass i f ica t ion

A r t i c l e I V Reports have p rov ided valuable i n f o rm a t i o n and eva lua t ion o f the performance 
and perspectives o f the Be la rus economy. The Government does n o t have an interest in a 
stand-by o r other f inanc ing f a c i l i t y from the IMF. 
57. 
The Eu ropean B a n k for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). T h e EBRD 
ma in ta ined a limited engagement in Belarus, w i th 11 inves tmen t projects cove r ing 
energy, transport, telecoms, communications, general industry and banking, f o r a to ta l 
comm i tmen t o f EUR203 .3 m i l l i o n . T h e new strategy, approved in December 2006, 
focuses o n operations in the p r iva te sector where investments can have the greatest 
impac t in deve lop ing a dynam ic and entrepreneurial class. At the same time, EBRD 
remains ready t o expand i t s operations outside the p r iva te sector, shou ld domestic 
circumstances a l low . T h e strategy iden t i f ied clear and measurable, p o l i t i c a l and 
economic benchmarks that the B a n k w i l l m o n i t o r regu la r ly and spec i f ied the operational 
response that cou ld f o l l o w in the event o f s ign i f ican t progress. T h e WBG, th rough the 
IFC , has coordinated i t s w o r k with that o f the EBRD as the t w o agendas are quite 
complementary. 
58. 
Eu ropean U n i o n (EU). Belarus n o w borders the EU. D u e t o the fa i lu re to 
comp ly in te rna t iona l democratic comm i tmen ts made by Be la rus as a member o f the 
O rgan iza t ion f o r Secu r i ty and Co -ope ra t ion in Europe (OSCE), the EU has n o t negotiated 
an agreement w i th Be la rus in the con tex t o f the ENP .

LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

The majority of the key results set under the CAS to measure success were met. 

59. 
T h e C A S put f o r t h s ix ind ica to rs by w h i c h t o access progress. These are: 
Im p r o v e d f isca l transparency measured by enhancing budget coverage, i n c l u d i n g 
repo r t ing and aud i t ing o f a l l o f the o f f -budge t funds; 
Containment o f the TB and AIDS epidemic; 
Enhanced comp l iance with in te rna t iona l env i ronmen ta l standards; 
In t roduc t ion o f a targeted system o f social protection; 
Be t te r business env i ronmen t as evidenced by surveys; and 
A c t i v e c i v i l soc ie ty pa r t ic ipa t ion in the coun t ry ’s l i f e . 
60 . 
This r e v i ew o f the p rog ram shows that progress made in these areas has been

environment norms. Some imp rovemen ts was made in f isca l transparency and ta rge t ing

o f social assistance and p r o v i d e a good basis f o r fu tu re progress. Belarus’ business 
env i ronmen t remains highly constrained and m u c h m o r e progress cou ld have been made. 
T h e I F C h a d an impac t h e l p i n g the sma l l but dynam ic p r iva te sector w i th finance and 
techn ica l advice, but in tended actions t o fac i l i ta te en t ry o f n ew enterprises did n o t occur. 
T h e p roduc t ive sectors con t inue t o operate under soft budge t constraints b l o c k i n g the 
needed rea l loca t ion o f resources. 
I t i s in regards t o the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society 
where results have fa l len short o f objectives. 
Th e W B G contributed to the achievement of these results through its analytical 
work and TA . T h e good qua l i ty o f the AAA, the invo lvemen t o f l o c a l partners and the 
e f fo r ts at d issem ina t ion con t r ibu ted t o h a v i n g an impac t . T h e absence o f lend ing 
operations did n o t diminish the effectiveness o f the advice, as the government allocated 
i t s o w n resources o r obtained grants f r o m other sources, as was the case o f TB and AIDS. 
T h e o n l y p ro jec t under implementation-SIRP-contributed 
t o increase the energy 
e f f ic iency in schools and hospitals as w e l l as t o im p r o v e the ope ra t ing env i ronmen t f o r 
students and patients. 
Th e decision to postpone preparation of the CAS proved adequate. The m u t u a l 
dec is ion o f the authorities and the B a n k t o postpone p repa ra t ion o f a new C A S until 
approval o f the Che rnoby l p ro jec t and the comp le t ion o f the k e y ana ly t ica l wo rk -CEM 
and FSAP-proved 
correct. T h e approval o f the Che rnoby l p ro jec t d ispe l led concerns 
that i t was i n c r e d i b l y d i f f i c u l t t o prepare operations in the coun t ry as l o n g as they a l i g n 
w i th coun t ry p r io r i t ies and focus o n ha rd investments. At the same time, the ana ly t ica l 
w o r k has p rov ided a clearer understanding o f the Be la rus puzzle, the capacity o f the 
economy t o compete and t o deal w i th the energy p r i c e shocks. 
Th e B an k can continue to play an important role in Belarus. Belarus faces 
m a j o r challenges ahead as the energy prices increase and pressures moun t t o b e m o r e 
compe t i t ive and de l ive r h ighe r incomes. As the coun t ry adjusts t o the eme rg ing 
circumstances, good p o l i c y and qu ick actions w i l l b e needed t o a v o i d hardship among the 
popu la t ion as the funds f o r social assistance are t igh ten ing and ine f f ic ien t companies 
need t o shed labo r t o compete. In addition, the s i tua t ion o f the Che rnoby l areas continues 
t o requ i re a t ten t ion and im p r o v i n g the env i ronmen t continue t o b e a na t iona l and 
in te rna t iona l p r i o r i t y . Belarus has a r i c h ecosystem, with extensive marshes and forests, 
whose p rese rva t ion means gains f o r the region. T h e qua l i ty o f water also benefits the 
coun t ry and the i r neighbors. In these circumstances, the Bank can continue t o p l a y a 
cautious but pos i t ive r o l e building o n the lessons o f the past. 
64. 
T o be effective the W B G must align i ts program with Governmentpriorities that 
f a l l within its mandate. WBG engagement-TA, 
ana ly t ica l w o r k and lending-will be 
m o r e e f fec t ive i f a l igned with government p r io r i t ies . Proposals o f drastic p o l i c y changes 
are n o t l i k e l y t o b e e f fec t ive as a l l recent evidence and d ia logue suggests that the 
authorities are o n l y w i l l ing t o ve ry p a r t i a l l y imp lemen t re fo rms proposed by the B a n k 
and others. I t continues t o b e the case, as po in ted ou t in the CAS , that the re i s “ l i t t l e t o b e 
gained by pushing the p o l i c y dialogue (and cond i t iona l i ty ) beyond wha t the Government 
can consider pa r t o f i t s o w n program.” However, g iven the s ign i f ican t distortions in the 
economy and l im i t e d transparency, the WBG, w h i l e rema in ing within i t s mandate, can 
s t i l l take an advocacy pos i t ion in areas i t deems re levan t t o na t iona l economic and social 
development objectives. Meanwh i le , I F C should con t inue t o respond t o the needs o f i t s

p r o v i s i o n o f adv iso ry services and 

primary stakeholder-the 
p r iva te sector-through 
investments, where possible. 
Quality AAA is a prerequisite for a solid dialogue with Government and to 
effective advocacy. The B a n k shou ld con t inue t o emphasize AAA in c r i t ica l areas t o 
increase the know ledge base and t o p r o v i d e p o l i c y op t ions t o the Government. Bank 
w o r k has t o b e t ime ly , especially in rega rd t o the impac t o f the external economic shocks, 
the competitiveness o f the economy, the e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c expenditure, energy 
e f f ic iency , and the comm i tmen t t o a better environment. 
I t can raise awareness o f the 
op t ions available t o face eme rg ing challenges. T h e B a n k has been e f fec t ive in 
dissemination e f fo r ts and shou ld emphasize these even more. 
M a in t a in presence in lending. A l t h o u g h the scope f o r lending i s narrow, lend ing 
shou ld con t inue t o be an ins t rumen t o f Bank engagement. Be lams k n ow s w e l l h o w t o 
implement programs and a l though f i d u c i a r y matters requ i re continuous vigilance, they 
are n o t today a subject o f s ign i f ican t concern. The government p rog ram includes p ro jec ts 
w i th d i rec t impac t o n the p o o r o r w i th substantial na t iona l and reg iona l benefits. Past 
experience shows that w h e n lending slows down, there i s a sp i l l -ove r effect o n other 
types o f engagement (TA, p o l i c y dialogue, G A C support, c i v i l society outreach). 
67. Work with others. In d i f f i c u l t p o l i c y areas, f o r example, business env i ronmen t 
and regulation, the WBG shou ld j o i n forces with other IFIs such as the EBRD, IMF and 
other b i la te ra l donors w i th s ign i f ican t p rog rams in the country.
