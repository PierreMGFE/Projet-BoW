EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

1. 
By historical and regional standards Senegal has achieved good economic results 
over the past decade even though its performance was weaker in 2006. N o t o n l y did GD P 
g r ow t h average almost 5 percent per year, but pove r ty in households also dec l ined by almost 15 
percentage po in ts be tween 1994 and 2002. Nevertheless, Senegal remains a p o o r country, with a 
GDP pe r cap i ta o f US $ 7 1 0 in 2005, and m a j o r deficiencies in i t s in f ras t ruc tu re and human 
development. 
I t also fa i led t o repo r t m a j o r imp rovemen ts in man-made outcomes such as 
governance, ease o f d o i n g business, and techno logy development, w h i c h are c ruc ia l f o r a coun t ry 
that cannot rely o n s ign i f ican t na tu ra l resources. 

2. 
The Government i s we l l aware that i t needs to do more and better to reach its 
MDGs and reduce poverty by half by 2015. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the new Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS), as w e l l as o f the Accelerated G r ow t h Strategy (AGS), i s expected t o 
lead t o h ighe r economic g r ow t h rates, and t o greater equity th rough imp rovemen ts in the delivery 
o f basic soc ia l services and in the p ro tec t ion o f the mos t vu lne rab le p o p u l a t i o n groups. The 
Gove rnmen t has also announced i t s intent t o imp rove governance and strengthen pa r t ic ipa to ry 
processes and decentralization. T h i s m e d i um - t e r n v i s i o n has been app roved by stakeholders in 
Senegal and i s a l igned with i t s M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs ) . 

3. 
The proposed outcome-based Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 
FYO7-10 seeks to support Senegal’s effort in achieving its ambitious development agenda. 
I t i s the resu l t o f a pa r t ic ipa to ry process th rough w h i c h the W o r l d B a n k G roup (WBG) aims t o 
(i) op t im ize i t s experience in Senegal; (ii) a l i g n i t s support w i th the Government’s PRSP 
p r io r i t ies and the Bank ’s A f r i c a A c t i o n P l a n (AAP); and (iii) find synergies with partners. The 
new C A S recognizes that m o r e e f fo r ts are needed t o address the challenge o f weak governance 
in Senegal, and introduces a “governance f i l te r ” comp r is ing four core p r inc ip les t o ensure that 
governance considerations are mainstreamed i n t o a l l WBG’s programs: (i) im p r o v e transparency 
and e f f ic iency in the use o f p u b l i c resources; (ii) increase p u b l i c sector accoun tab i l i ty ; (iii) 
strengthen and mode rn ize the j u d i c i a l system; and (iv) enhance mechanisms f o r p r iva te sector 
governance. Th is focus shou ld help Senegal t o close the gap with successful eme rg ing countries. 

4. 

The CAS program i s selective by focusing on three pillars: 

a. 

Pillar I: accelerated growth/wealth creation. Strengthening GDP g r ow t h t o an 
annual rate o f 7 percent, w h i c h i s 1-2 percent h ighe r than the h is to r ica l average, i s 
perceived by Senegal as one o f i t s prerequisites f o r reach ing MDGs. WBG support 
w i l l inc lude a series o f IDA and I F C instruments o rgan ized t o achieve the s ix 
f o l l ow i n g outcomes: (i) p r om o t i n g a compe t i t ive inves tmen t climate; (ii) building 
and ma in ta in ing basic in f ras t ruc tu re f o r growth; (iii) fac i l i ta t ing access t o f inanc ia l 
resources by sma l l and medium enterprises; (iv) p r om o t i n g a m o d e r n and 
d ive rs i f ied ag r icu l tu ra l sector; 
fos te r ing sustainable development and 
management o f na tu ra l resources; and (vi) deve lop ing s k i l l e d labo r and u s e o f 
technology.

b. Pillar 11: human developmenthhared growth. Inc reas ing access t o soc ia l services 
and c rea t ing oppo r tun i t ies f o r p o o r and vu lne rab le groups, as g r ow t h pe r fo rmance i s 
imp roved , i s at the heart o f Senegal’s PRS agenda. Im p r o v e d equ i ty i s crucial, n o t 
o n l y t o ensure social and p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty , but also t o achieve long - te rm economic 
g row th . WBG assistance w i l l inc lude a m i x o f f inanc ia l and ana ly t ica l support in 
the educa t ion and hea l th sectors, as w e l l as in the area o f the p ro tec t ion o f 
vu lne rab le groups.

Pillar 111: rural and urban synergies. The r a p i d pace o f u rban iza t ion in Senegal 
ou t o f ten people are p ro jec ted t o l i v e in c i t ies by 2015-raises 
a k e y 
challenge f o r the authorities w h o w i l l need t o find the right balance be tween urban 
and r u r a l development. To support the Government, the WBG w i l l shape i t s 
p rog ram around three m a j o r outcomes: (i) ba lanc ing the p r o v i s i o n o f in f ras t ruc tu re 
be tween u rban and r u r a l areas; (ii) reduc ing the vu lne rab i l i ty o f imm ig ran ts and 
emigrants; and (iii) im p r o v i n g the q u a l i t y o f l i f e o f the popu la t ion th rough better 
management o f na tu ra l resources and im p r o v e d access t o wa te r and sanitation. 

5 . 

As a tangible step toward achieving these medium-term outcomes, the proposed 
CAS recognizes the regional dimension of Senegal’s development as we l l as the importance 
of enhancing gender development and building loca l capacity. Several reg iona l operations 
and ana ly t ica l studies are envisaged in the energy sector, the p r om o t i o n o f the Senegal River 
area, the r o a d sector, w i th the development o f co r r ido rs with M a u r i t a n i a and The Gambia, and 
social sectors th rough reg iona l in i t ia t ives in hea l th and education. Success in the development o f 
Senegal w i l l n o t o n l y depend g rea t ly o n i t s capacity t o p r o v i d e w om e n social p ro tec t ion and 
equal access t o soc ia l services, but also t o secure f o r them m o r e and better jobs . Last, but n o t 
least, the focus o n capac i ty building i s justified because Senegal’s progress w i l l be shaped by the 
qua l i ty o f i t s labo r force and entrepreneurs as well as the effectiveness o f i t s p u b l i c 
adm in is t ra t ion . 

6. 
A focused lending program i s proposed, in the range of US$420 million ove r the 
four-year CAS period, which w i l l complement ongoing operations and seek to optimize 
WBG assistance given government priorities and partner programs. The proposed CAS 
p rog ram w i l l a i m at ba lanc ing WBG lend ing across the above three k e y p i l la rs and the 
governance f i l t e r . I t w i l l seek t o m a x im i z e B a n k assistance in Senegal through: (i) the u s e o f 
various f inanc ia l ins t rumen ts such as budget support, s ing le inves tmen t projects, and c omm u n i t y 
driven development in i t ia t ives ; (ii) leve rag ing f inanc ia l resources beyond the coun t ry I D A 
a l loca t ion th rough partnerships and dono r coordination; and (iii) enhancing reg iona l economic 
externalities. 

7. 
The CAS includes a co re program of AAA which aims at supporting the 
Government’s vision, and focuses on three main issues: (i) labo r ma rke t and p roduc t iv i ty ; (ii) 
p ro tec t ion o f vu lne rab le groups (no tab ly you th and street c h i l d r e n and ac t iv i t ies in rura l areas 
such as in the g roundnu t basin); and (iii) f isca l policies, expenditure e f f ic iency , and c i v i l service 
reforms. In co l labo ra t ion with IFC and WBI, other ana ly t ica l studies are expected t o b e ca r r ied 
ou t o n the development o f the know ledge economy, the reg iona l hous ing finance market, and a 
rev iew o f the f isca l regime o f f inanc ia l operations.

8. 

The program i s designed to mitigate risks that could limit the effectiveness of WBG 

support. These r i s k s can b e grouped i n t o three m a i n categories: (i) l a c k o f governance and 
vested interests; (ii) vu lne rab i l i ty t o p o l i t i c a l and economic external shocks; and (iii) weak 
capac i ty f o r implementing re fo rms . The measurement o f results i s an essential component o f 
im p r o v i n g m u t u a l accoun tab i l i ty and m i t i g a t i n g r i s k s . The WBG w i l l primarily depend o n three 
comp lemen ta ry channels t o m o n i t o r C A S progress ove r t ime . The f i rs t channel i s the current 
PRSP ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk f o r the comp i la t ion and v e r i f i c a t i o n o f results and milestones. The 
second channel consists o f pe r iod ic p o r t f o l i o reviews, in close coo rd ina t ion with the authorities 
and o the r partners. The third channel i s t o ensure that the strategic AAA p r o g r am and

INTRODUCT ION 

1.1 
The proposed CAS activities are clustered around three pillars and one cross-sector 
governance filter. The three p i l la rs are : (i) fos te r ing econom ic g r ow t h th rough support to 
p r iva te sector development; (ii) im p r o v i n g human development th rough be t te r de l ive ry o f social 
services, n o t a b l y t o the mos t vulnerable groups; and (iii) enhancing r u r a l and u rban synergies. 
Transparency w i l l b e mainstreamed in a l l p rog rams and p ro jec ts supported by the C A S t o help 
im p r o v e p u b l i c and p r iva te governance. The C A S w i l l em p l o y a selected m i x o f Bank and IFC

POL IT ICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND 

2.1 
Senegal i s located on the West Coast of Africa and i s part o f the West African 
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). With a p o p u l a t i o n estimated at about 10 m i l l i o n , 
i t s economy i s dom ina ted by a f ew strategic sectors, i n c l u d i n g groundnuts, fisheries, and 
services. The r o l e o f the ag r icu l tu ra l sector has dec l ined ove r time, f r o m almost 15 percent o f 
GDP in 1960 t o 7 percent in 2004. The i n f o rm a l sector accounts f o r about 60 percent o f GDP . 
I t s r u r a l economy f requen t ly su f fe rs f r o m drought, and lacks access t o basic services and 
infrastructure, lead ing t o l o w p roduc t iv i ty , high em ig ra t ion and h ighe r pove r ty rates in r u r a l 
areas. As a result, i t i s estimated that almost h a l f o f the popu la t ion l i v e s in cities.' This ra t io i s 
p ro jec ted t o increase up t o 60 percent by 2015. 

2.2 
Over the past decades, Senegal has enjoyed a stable political climate, and has 
remained largely unaffected by regional instability. A c c o r d i n g t o a recent W o r l d Bank study, 
eve ry year one ou t o f eight countries w i l l su f fe r from an in te rna l p o l i t i c a l c o n f l i c t in Sub-Saharan 
A f r ica .2 By contrast, Senegal has shown a remarkable p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty since independence, 
w h i c h was strengthened by the successful t rans i t ion t o a n ew President in 2000 and the 
Casamance peace agreement at the end o f 2004. This s tab i l i ty i s v iewed as the resu l t o f a

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

2.4 
Today , Senegal i s v iewed as a good p e r fo rm e r in Sub -Saha ran A f r i c a w i th its 
economy g row ing a t a steady r a t e o f abou t 5 pe rcen t since the deva lua t ion in 1994. The 
Gove rnmen t has shown a capacity t o generate economic growth, in spite o f exogenous shocks 
(such as droughts and na tu ra l disasters). I n f l a t i o n has rema ined w e l l under control, at around 1-2 
percent per year. The f isca l p o s i t i o n has been strong, w i th an unprecedented l o w indebtedness 
and g r ow i n g tax revenues. S im i la r ly , the current account d e f i c i t has been ove r - f inanced by 
o f f i c i a l and p r iva te cap i ta l in f lows , resu l t ing in substantial fo re ign exchange reserves equivalent 
t o ove r 3 mon ths o f imports at end-2006. The mone ta ry and exchange rate po l ic ies have been 
k e p t in l i n e with reg iona l agreements. 

2.5 
Senegal has received s ign if icant cap i ta l inf lows over the past decade. I t has con t inued 
t o be one o f the mos t assisted countries in the w o r l d (the l e v e l o f o f f i c i a l a i d pe r cap i ta exceeded 
US$ lOO in 2004). Furthermore, the g r ow i n g numbe r o f Senegalese living in indus t r ia l countries 
(and the inc reas ing fac i l i t ies t o send m o n e y across in te rna t iona l borders) has generated a steady 
increase in remittances, estimated at around US$500 m i l l i o n in 2004,3 w h i c h have helped t o

p romo te economic g r ow t h and soc ia l p ro tec t ion in SenegaL4 Ove ra l l , these two sources o f 
fo re ign cap i ta l are n o w estimated t o b e equivalent t o about 25 percent o f GDP. 

2.6 
T h e weake r economic pe r fo rmance in 2006, w i t h a GDP g row th r a t e p ro jec ted 
a round 3.3 pe rcen t (but l ike ly to b e rev ised downw a rd to 2 percent) and a significant 
increase in the fiscal a n d ex te rna l deficits, i s to a la rge extent exp la ined b y t w o m a i n 
factors. First, Senegal has been hit by the surge in in te rna t iona l o i l p r ices and by f inanc ia l 
d i f f i c u l t i e s in the e lec t r ic i ty sector as w e l l as the largest expo r t ing firm ( Indus t r ies Chimiques du 
S i n i g a l - IC s ) . Second, the latest p o l i t i c a l cyc le has led t o s ign i f ican t increases in p u b l i c wages 
and investments, under the pressure o f l o b b y groups and po l i t ic ians . As a result, the f isca l d e f i c i t 
i s estimated t o have soared f r o m 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 t o ove r 5 . 5 percent in 2006. The 
e lec t r ic i ty company (SENELEC) i s also unde r f inanc ia l distress (with an estimated gap o f around 
US $ 2 0 0 m i l l i o n at end 2006), f o r c i n g the authorities t o increase p r ices and rev ise the i r strategy, 
with the assistance o f the Bank and other donors. I t i s w o r t h n o t i n g that the revenue performance 
exceeded expectations, inc reas ing by ove r 8 percent during 2006, and that the l e v e l o f p u b l i c 
debt dec l ined substantially o w i n g t o the MDRI and the p ruden t management o f the domestic 
p u b l i c debt (see m o r e details in Annex 5). The recent economic pe r fo rmance has been 
associated with a widening o f the current account de f ic i t f r o m 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2002 t o 7.6 
percent o f GDP in 2005 and ove r 9 percent in 2006. This gradual de te r io ra t ion was driven by 
strong domestic demand, m a i n l y f r o m the p u b l i c sector, and lack lus te r expo r t performance. In 
2006, the increase in the va lue o f o i l impo r ts also con t r ibu ted t o a la rge p o r t i o n o f the surge in 
impo r ts . Howeve r , substantial p r iva te cap i ta l in f lows , comb ined with debt relief, a l lowed the 
Cen t ra l B a n k t o m a i n t a i n i t s l e v e l o f net in te rna t iona l reserves. T h e gross o f f i c i a l reserves 
reached about 3.8 mon ths o f im p o r t s at the end o f 2006. 

2.7 
G i v e n the favorable i n i t i a l macro-economic conditions, l o w debt levels, the absence o f 
Cen t ra l B a n k financing, and the beginning o f a n ew p o l i t i c a l cycle, Senegal shou ld be able t o 
re tu rn t o a pos i t ive economic t ra jec to ry in the med ium - te rm , as l o n g as the r i s k s i d e n t i f i e d in the

c . MEDIUM-TERM 
OUTLOOK AND SUSTAINABILITY 
2.8 
The medium-term scenario i s based on r e a l GDP annual growth of about 5 percent 
and continued low inflation during 2007 -11 (see Annex 9 ) . This g r ow t h rate i s at about the 
same l e v e l as the average g r ow t h rate since the deva lua t ion o f the C F A F in 1994, and consistent 
with the l o w base scenario presented by the authorities in the second Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy 
Paper (PRSP-11). 
I t s attainment w o u l d require the con t inuous imp lemen ta t ion o f sound 
mac roeconom ic po l ic ies , ma rke t -o r ien ted structural reforms, and an e f f ic ien t Gove rnmen t 
inves tmen t p rog ram . P r iva te savings shou ld increase moderately, fac i l i ta ted by rising rea l per 
cap i ta income and f inanc ia l sector development. R e f l e c t i n g these trends, the external current 
account d e f i c i t ( inc lud ing o f f i c i a l transfers) w o u l d dec l ine m a r g i n a l l y f r o m the p ro jec ted 12 
percent o f GDP in 2006, t o around 7.5 percent o f GDP by 2010. 

2.9 
The medium-term outlook i s subject to a number of downside risks, but could also 
be upgraded under specific conditions. On the one hand, Senegal’s economy remain‘s 
vu lne rab le t o exogenous shocks, i n c l u d i n g h ighe r o i l prices, severe droughts, locus t invasion, 
and severe p o l i t i c a l s t r i fe in the WAEMU reg ion . I t w i l l also be highly dependent o n the a b i l i t y 
o f the authorities t o address the current c r is is in the energy sector and chem ica l industry (w h i c h 
s t i l l needs t o b e p rope r ly evaluated). The re la t ive f r a g i l i t y o f the current account de f ic i t also 
emphasizes the need t o p romo te p r iva te sector development, especially expo r t -o r ien ted activities, 
w h i c h i s at the center o f the new Accelerated G r ow t h Strategy (AGS).’ On the other hand, the 
r a p i d imp lemen ta t ion o f the A G S m a y accelerate economic g r ow t h t o the range o f 7-8 percent 
assuming i t creates better cond i t ions f o r the development o f p r iva te sector ac t iv i t ies and thus 
stimulates higher p r iva te investment and exports. N e w p r iva te ac t iv i t ies c o u l d also arise f r o m 
oppo r tun i t ies in po ten t ia l sectors such as tourism, I n f o rm a t i o n and Commun ica t ion Techno logy 
(ICT), and agriculture. 

2.10 The second positive feature of the medium-term outlook i s that Senegal has exited 
the recent enhanced H IPC Initiative and MDRI with a good basis for maintaining 
sustainable external debt levels over the medium term, especially i f b o r r ow i n g remains at 
concessional terms and the l e v e l o f the f isca l d e f i c i t rema ins b e l ow 4 percent o f GDP (see A n n e x 
5 f o r details). The recent Deb t -Sus ta inab i l i ty Ana lys is (DSA ) conducted j o i n t l y by the IMF and 
B a n k staffs has s h ow n that the l e v e l o f p u b l i c external debt was as l o w as 13 percent o f GD P at 
the end o f 2006. P u b l i c domestic debt i s estimated at about 3 percent o f GDP, o f w h i c h two - 
thirds i s l o n g t e rm . The DSA highlights the need f o r Senegal t o con t inue t o adopt s t r ic t f isca l 
discipline, a p ruden t strategy rega rd ing bo r row ing .

POVERTY PROFILE AND UNEQUAL PROGRESS TOWARD MDGS 

2.1 1 Senegal remains a poor country, with a GNI per capita o f U S $ 7 1 0 in 2005 .6 The 
latest househo ld survey indicates that the p r o p o r t i o n o f the popu la t ion living in p o v e r t y 
decreased f r o m 67.9 percent in 1994 (61.4 percent o f households) t o 57.1 percent in 2001 
(48.5 percent o f households), w h i c h represents a s ign i f ican t achievement by b o t h h is to r ica l and 

A clear ind ica t ion o f the concentration o f Senegal’s exports i s that in 2002, the top f ive exports at the 8 -d ig i t 
Harmon ized System l e v e l represented over 40 percent o f to ta l exports (petroleum, crude vegetable o i l , phosphor ic 
acid, lobster and shrimps).

reg iona l  standard^.^ This pos i t ive e v o l u t i o n needs t o be qua l i f ied o n three accounts: (i) the 
absolute number o f p o o r households has nonetheless increased; (ii) p o v e r t y rema ins concentrated 
in r u r a l areas as shown by the fact that the decrease was larger in D a k a r and o the r u rban centers 
than in r u r a l areas; and (iii) perceptions o f p o v e r t y show that two - th i rds o f households i d e n t i f y 
themselves as p o o r and one - th i rd o f p o o r and non -poo r a l ike fee l p o v e r t y has substantially 
increased in their c omm u n i t y ove r the last f i v e years. 

2.12 The probability o f being poor in Senegal i s highly correlated with access to basic 
infrastructure services. The reg ions with the highest levels o f p o v e r t y (Z igu incho r , Ko lda , 
Kao loack , and D iou rbe l ) are those with the lowes t access t o water and san i ta t ion and e lec t r ic i ty . 
For the r u r a l popu la t ion , and f o r the p o o r in b o t h the urban and r u r a l areas, access gaps a re la rge 
and re in fo rce the i r vu lne rab i l i ty . * 
2.13 Unequal human development i s both the cause and the result o f poverty. The 
average l i f e expectancy does n o t exceed 56 years in Senegal, as b o t h i n f a n t and ma te rna l 
m o r t a l i t y rates are high (even in compa r ison t o deve lop ing countries). The l e v e l o f education i s 
imp rov ing , no tab ly in p r im a r y education, but secondary and tertiary education suffer f r o m 
nume rous problems, lead ing t o l o w rates o f r e t u r n and high d ropou t rates. 

2.14 Poverty in Senegal i s also linked to the difficulty in finding jobs. Today, fou r ou t o f 
ten po ten t ia l wo rke rs are unemp loyed o r unde remp loyed in Senegal, and this p r o p o r t i o n i s even 
h ighe r f o r young peop le w h o l a c k s k i l l s and experience. Part o f the p r o b l em i s roo ted in the l a c k 
o f dynamism o f the p r iva te sector and the dec l in ing share o f the ag r icu l tu ra l sector in the 
economy (most no tab ly the groundnut sector). 
Indeed, since 2000, p r iva te investment has 
dec l ined in p r o p o r t i o n o f GDP and the numbe r o f new enterprises remains l im i ted , at least in the 
f o rm a l sector, due t o various obstacles such as the d i f f i c u l t access to e lec t r ic i ty at a reasonable 
cost, the lack o f transparency in the business environment, and the p o o r h n c t i o n i n g o f the 
j u d i c i a r y system (as re f lec ted by Senegal’s p o o r r a n k i n g in D o i n g Business). 

2.15 Another determinant of poverty i s the vulnerability of the rural population to 
external shocks (such as climatic conditions), which affects their income negatively. Such 
vu lne rab i l i ty has l e d t o h ighe r em ig ra t ion rates t ow a r d cities, in pa r t icu la r Dakar, con t r ibu t ing in 
turn t o the de te r io ra t ion o f living cond i t ions in urban areas and t o the emergence o f n ew 
vu lne rab le groups (e.g., s t ree t children, see B o x 2.1). These trends have created inc reas ing 
concerns rega rd ing f o o d and water security, n o t a b l y in b o om i n g u rban areas, and sustainable 
economic g r ow t h in a l l regions. This s i tua t ion has fue led higher i l l e g a l em ig ra t ion f l ow s towa rd 
indus t r ia l countries.

Box 2.1: Street Children in Senegal 

M o s t observers agree that the number o f s t ree t ch i ldren increased s ign i f ican t ly over the past two 
decades, but n o data i s available. Pre l im inary estimates o f a 2006 census o f street ch i ldren in the 
me tropo l i tan Dakar area put their number at over 10,000, an 
s t as many are likely t o be 
found in other urban centers throughout t h e coun try and parti 
Ko lda , Kaolak). These ch i ldren are among the mos t vulner 
enab l ing environment p rov id ing the psycho-social support they need. Living in abje 
they are o f ten malnourished, don ’ t go to school, are v ic t ims o f violence and have n o access to 
hea l th care. Barefoot, in rags and tatters, they are n o w pa r t o f the urban landscape. 

The vast ma jo r i ty o f s t ree t children, mos t ly boys o f 3-14 years, come f r om r u r a l areas, and over a 
third come f r om other countries (Guinea Bissau especially). They inc lude ch i ld ren entrusted to 
Ko ran ic teachers by their parents ( t a l i b b ) who are forced to beg fo r a living, ch i ldren whose 
fam i l ies l i v e in the street, and ch i ldren who have broken up with their fam i l ies (e.g., runaways, 
v ic t ims o f fam i ly violence, abandoned children). The talibks are by far the mos t numerous and 
v is ib le group, easily recognized by the tomato cans they carry to co l lec t alms. A 2006 survey 
suggests they ac tua l ly spend very l i t t l e time learn ing the Koran, and there are numerous cases o f 
c h i l d t ra f f ick ing disguised as Ko ran ic schooling. 

2 .16 Progress toward MDGs has been unequal due to the mixed performance of Senegal

SENEGAL’S M A I N DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

3.1 
Senegal has yet to fully l ive up to its development potential. At the current economic 
g r ow t h rate o f 5 percent, i t w o u l d take Senegal m o r e than 12 years t o reach a p e r cap i ta income 
o f US$ l ,OOO (the l e v e l recorded today by countries such as the Philippines o r Paraguay) o r 
nea r ly 25 years t o m o v e ahead o f Tun is ia and B r a z i l (assuming that these countries we re t o 
remain at their present levels). Senegal’s development i s h inde red by serious deficiencies in 
terms o f b o t h human and in f ras t ruc tu re development. F o r example, e lec t r ic i ty consump t ion p e r 
cap i ta remains s ign i f ican t ly l ow e r in Senegal than the average in Sub-Saharan A f r i c a . The road 
n e tw o r k i s underdeveloped and o f p o o r qua l i ty . Senegal was ranked at the 156‘h p o s i t i o n by the 
United N a t i o n O v e r a l l H um a n Deve lopmen t I n d e x in 2006.

3.2 

The international experience has revealed that one pre-requisite for success in a 
country such as Senegal, with limited natural resources, i s to perform better than others 
through a combination of man-made achievements in four main areas: (i) transparency and 
governance; (ii) Gove rnmen t efficacy; (iii) ease in d o i n g business; and (iv) capac i ty t o adapt and 
adopt new technologies th rough innova t ion and human d e ~ e l o p m e n t . ~ Senegal has n o t yet 
repo r ted s ign i f ican t imp rovemen ts in these fou r areas (see Tab le 3.1). Today i t i s ranked at 
app rox ima te ly the same l e v e l as Ghana and Vietnam but l ow e r than successh l eme rg ing 
coun t r ies in the w o r l d (Ireland, Singapore, and Estonia) and in A f r i c a (Mau r i t ius , Tunisia).

The recent economic performance provides Senegal with the opportunity to break 
with its history of relatively mixed results in terms of growth, equity and poverty 
alleviation. Se iz ing this oppo r tun i ty w i l l requ i re determined actions in two key areas: 
(i) im p r o v i n g p u b l i c service de l ive ry ; and (ii) p r om o t i n g p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion . 

A. IMPROVING 
PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY 

3.4 

Senegal enjoys a historical opportunity to increase the ro l e of its fiscal policy owing 
to the sound public management of the Central Government's financial equilibriums in 
recent years, strengthened by the recent external debt relief." 
I t w o u l d nonetheless be 
inco r rec t t o be l ieve that an expansive f isca l p o l i c y w i l l necessarily t r igge r accelerated g r ow t h in 
Senegal. Expe r ience ove r the past two decades shows that p u b l i c spending and economic g r ow t h 
weaknesses in t e rm s o f a l loca t ive and ope ra t iona l e f f ic ienc ies o f p u b l i c spending.' ' I f budgets 
a re n o t necessarily correlated or, at least, n o t as m u c h as p r iva te inves tmen t because o f persistent 

I O 

These four dimensions re f lec t the current l i tera ture o n economic grow th . The emphasis nowadays i s g i v e n to the 
r o l e o f the qua l i ty o f ins t i tu t ions (as re f lec ted by Governmen t effectiveness and transparency). This approach 
complements the mo re trad i t iona l v i ew that has s t ressed t h e r o l e o f technology, human capital, and p r iva te 
investment (w h i c h are captured by techno logy and the bus iness env ironmen t indicators). 
Such an increase shou ld stay w i t h i n reasonable l im i t s in order t o avo id exaggerated pressures o n the current 
account balance, w h i c h cou ld deteriorate in the event o f an ove r ly amb i t ious f isca l p o l i c y . F o r details, see Pub l ic

quantity o f services that are o f fe red w i l l suffer. 

Imp rov ing the allocative efficiency of pub l ic spending 

3 . 5 
The Gove rnmen t has inc reas ing ly recognized that the lack o f a l loca t ive e f f ic iency o f i t s 
spending i s one o f the m a i n constraints t o ach iev ing i t s pove r ty reduc t ion objectives. A recen t ly 
comp le ted B a n k study o n the effectiveness o f p u b l i c investment, prepared in close co l labo ra t ion 
with the authorities, presents a selected se t o f areas f o r reforms.12 

3.6 
The first area i s to consolidate public spending on infrastructure so as to c lose the 
infrastructure gap. Senegal lags in t e rm s o f the development and q u a l i t y o f i t s r o a d and 
e lec t r ic i ty networks, w h i c h are l ow e r than the average in sub-Saharan A f r i c a . The inadequate 
supp ly o f in f ras t ruc tu re services has also con t r ibu ted t o the l o w p r o d u c t i v i t y o f the p r iva te sector, 
no tab ly by r a i s i n g transport and energy costs. W o r l d Bank estimates ind ica te that by 
mode rn iz ing the r o a d n e tw o r k and e lec t r ic i ty grid t o the leve ls achieved by Botswana, Senegal 
c o u l d increase i t s annual g r ow t h rate by almost 3 percentage points.13 

3.7 
In response, the authorities have allocated an inc reas ing share o f expenditure t o 
infrastructure, accoun t ing f o r 40 percent o f to ta l inves tmen t in 2004 and 2005 versus 25 percent 
in 2000 -03 . Building new in f ras t ruc tu re has also become the centerpiece o f the President’s 
v is ion , with the p lanned cons t ruc t ion o f a new a i rpo r t and an indus t r ia l p l a t f o rm located about 30 
k i lome te rs f r o m Dakar, w h i c h w i l l he lp t o decentralize ac t iv i t ies away f r o m the Daka r area. The 
adequate p r o v i s i o n o f in f ras t ruc tu re in r u r a l areas w i l l also help p romo te ag r icu l tu ra l ac t iv i t ies 
and reduce pove r ty , which i s highly correlated w i th access t o wa te r and energy  service^.'^ 
3.8 
Fundamental i s s u e s r em a i n t o be addressed t o meet the inves tmen t challenge in the 
in f ras t ruc tu re sector. N o t o n l y an increasing share o f p u b l i c resources needs t o b e allocated t o 
p r o v i d i n g and ma in ta in ing these services but i t w i l l also be necessary t o attract p r iva te finds t o 
preserve the f isca l space. Such an o r ien ta t ion has already been i n i t i a t e d in the energy and r o a d 
sectors, but with m i x e d results ove r the past few years. The recent adop t ion o f the BOT L a w and 
the creation o f the In f ras t ruc tu re C o u n c i l have p r o v i d e d the basic elements f o r boos t ing p r iva te 
sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts in Senegal. Las t ly , the authorities w i l l have t o

o f large in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts o n the env i ronmen t and land management. 

3.9 
Second, the Government w i l l have to upgrade the intra-sectoral allocation of 
resources within the education and health sectors. The share o f education and hea l th 
expenditure in to ta l p u b l i c expenditures has increased s ign i f ican t ly ove r the past few years, up by 
0.9 and 0.5 percentage po in ts o f GDP respec t ive ly be tween 2000 and 2004. T h i s e f fo r t has

o f p reven t ing in fec t ious diseases and u t i l i z i n g rep roduc t ive hea l th services. 

3.10 
In the education sector, there have been impo r tan t gains in ach iev ing h ighe r en ro l lmen t 
rates and gender p a r i t y in primary schools, i n c l u d i n g a h ighe r reg is t ra t ion ra te f o r girls than f o r

T h e third a rea i s to increase a n d ha rmon ize budge ta ry suppo r t to vu lne rab le

exc luded f r o m f o rm a l social p ro tec t ion systems, soc ia l i n c l u s i o n i s at the center o f the 
development agenda. Howeve r , vu lne rab le groups have o n l y rece ived m a r g i n a l a t ten t ion f r o m 
the Government, as recogn ized by the authorities in their last two PRSP Progress Reports. T h e 
recent r e v i ew rea l ized by the Bank has revea led that the ex is t ing l a c k o f coo rd ina t ion across 
p rog rams reduces their effectiveness, mos t n o t a b l y in r u r a l areas.” As a result, the Gove rnmen t 
has deve loped a n ew Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Strategy tha t was adopted at the end o f 2005. I t s t resses 
three m a i n objectives: (i) strengthening and ex tend ing ex is t ing soc ia l secu r i ty systems; (ii)

3.12 
T h e last a rea emphasizes the need to imp ro v e the a l locat ive efficiency o f public 
spend ing no t on ly across sectors but also across regions. Inequa l i t ies in the d e l i v e r y o f soc ia l

areas, at the expense o f remo te areas where needs are pressing. The Senegalese Gove rnmen t has

( F EC L and FDD) equivalent t o l e s s than 1.5 percent o f the central Gove rnmen t budge t in 2005. 
C lea r ly , the decen t ra l iza t ion process needs t o b e accelerated ove r the nex t f ew years. 

Upgrad ing the operational efficiency of pub l ic spending 

3.13 The lack o f operational efficiency o f public spending appears rooted in cumbersome 
and complex administrative and financial procedures. As a result, in June 2003, the 
Senegalese authorities approved two ac t ion p lans suppo r t ing p u b l i c expenditure management 
re fo rms ( f o l l ow i n g recommendations o f the Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment- 
C F A A and the Coun t ry Procurement Assessment Review-CPAR) 
and in i t ia ted their 
imp lemen ta t ion with the support o f donors, i n c l u d i n g the Bank and the IMF. Senegal has made 
s ign i f ican t progress in the areas o f budge t p repa ra t ion and execution, no tab ly in the p r i o r i t y 
sectors de f ined in the PRSP. However, s ign i f ican t upg rad ing i s s t i l l needed in the areas o f 
in te rna l and ex te rna l con t ro ls and o f budget execu t ion in agencies and state-owned enterprises. 
S im i la r ly , e f fo r ts must be made t o increase transparency in p rocu remen t o f p u b l i c contracts by 
upg rad ing the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk . Those weaknesses we re mos t apparent in mid- 
2004, when a series o f i r regu la r i t ies in in f ras t ruc tu re spending in a secondary c i t y came t o light, 
and seem t o have been exacerbated by mismanagement and lack o f transparency in parastatals in 
recent months, lead ing t o the accumu la t ion o f debt. Such imp rovemen ts w i l l have t o inc lude 
l o c a l Governments (in view o f the expected inc reas ing decentralization) and p u b l i c enterprises. 

3.14 As part of their objective to improve the quality o f public human resource 
management, the authorities have initiated c iv i l service reform. They have rec ru i ted almost 
15,000 new c i v i l servan ts (as agreed u p o n with the IMF and the Bank), w i th an emphasis o n the 
m a i n sectors o f the PRSP, i n c l u d i n g education, health, justice, tax collection, and security. 
Concu r ren t ly , the Government has i n i t i a t e d the imp lemen ta t ion o f a series o f re fo rms in i t s 
remune ra t ion p o l i c y a im i n g at (i) im p r o v i n g the competitiveness o f p u b l i c wages with respect t o 
the p r iva te sector; (ii) simplifying procedures; and (iii) in t roduc ing performance-based 
incentives. The recent audit o f the wage b i l l has revea led that the imp lemen ta t ion o f a n ew 
paymen t system i s requ i red t o mode rn ize the management o f h um a n resources in p u b l i c 
adm in is t ra t ion . The Gove rnmen t w i l l have t o con t inue t o experiment with new p i l o t projects, 
such as the one recen t ly tes ted in 25 hea l th facilities, t o in t roduce performance-based incen t ives 
in key sectors such as hea l th and education. T h e Gove rnmen t w i l l need t o strengthen i t s c i v i l 
service by giving m o r e a t ten t ion t o the development o f adequate t r a i n i n g programs, i n c l u d i n g 
t ra in ing in partnership with the p r iva te sector. An e f fec t ive f isca l p o l i c y requires an increase in 
labo r p r o d u c t i v i t y o f the p u b l i c sector ove r time,

Box 3.1 : Ma in Achievements in Public Financial Management and Remaining Issues 

The Bank ’s f iduc ia ry risk assessment ra ted pub l ic f inanc ia l management as “moderate” in Senegal, in l i n e 
with the r e s u l t f r om the Government’s comprehensive eva lua t ion o f the C F A A and C P AR ac t ion plans 
carr ied ou t in June 2006. Overa l l , progress was judged encouraging, with 70 percent and 44 percent o f 
t h e C F A A and C P AR actions respectively completed by end 2005. M a j o r achievements were rea l ized in 
terms o f prepara t ion and execution o f the budget, no tab ly through the use o f programma t ic budgets in k e y 
m in is tr ies and the gradual decentralization o f budget execution f r om the Ministry o f Economy and 
Finance to l i n e m in is t r ies . The imp lemen ta t ion o f the s o h a r e system S IGF IP was also perceived as a 
ma jo r step forward . On procurement, the f i r s t ever aud i t was published at end 2005 and k e y M in is t r ies 
have started t o develop annual plans to he lp streamline procedures and avo id concentration o f contracts in 
the last quarter o f the calendar year. With regard to controls, i t was no ted that the Treasury had been able 
t o transfer a l l state accounts accumulated f r om 1997 to the Cour des comptes, e l im ina t ing the back log 
accumulated over the years. In turn, the Cour des comptes has evaluated the state accounts fo r 1997, 
1998 and 1999 and i s on the pace to rev iew rema in ing accounts during the nex t 18 months. 

The evaluation repor t recommended that the authorities shou ld focus their e f for ts in the f o l l ow i n g areas: 
(i) imp rove wage and human resources management; (ii) harmonize procedures between pro jec ts funded 
o n in terna l and external resources; (iii) accelerate the use o f programmatic budgets in l i n e M i n i s t r i e s ; (iv) 
imp rove the preparation and execution o f the investment budget; and (v) strengthen in te rna l and external 
con tro ls o f agencies, pub l ic enterprises, and loca l governments. T h e authorities, and partners, were also 
encouraged to launch the Pub l ic Expenditure F inanc ia l Assessment (PEFA), as i t shou ld p rov ide useful 
benchmarks fo r measuring progress in Senegal over t ime and compared t o other countries. Such an 
exercise i s expected to be completed bv October 2007. 

3.15 The Senegalese authorities need to be made more accountable fo r the use o f public

ENHANCING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT 

3.16 The performance of the private sector has been uneven in Senegal as evidenced by 
the decrease in private investment from 17 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 15 percent in 2004 
and the relative stagnation of exports, around 27 percent of GDP. This l a c k o f dynam ism i s 
also re f lec ted at the m i c r o l e v e l since labo r p r o d u c t i v i t y o f manu fac tu r ing in Senegal, w h i l e high 
compared t o ne ighbo r ing countries, i s estimated to have dec l ined ove r the past two decades, and 
i s today equivalent t o one fifth o r one third o f those achieved in K o r e a and Sou th A f r ica , 
respectively. 
Job c rea t ion has been m i n i m a l with the unemp loymen t and unde r -emp loymen t 
rates stagnating at around 40 percent o f the labo r force. Such a pe r fo rmance needs t o be tu rned 
around so that the p r iva te sector can p l a y i t s expected p i v o t a l r o l e in the PRS agenda. 

3.17 Policymakers face major challenges to improve Senegal’s investment climate and 
promote sector development. S t ream l in ing bureaucracy and im p r o v i n g transparency are key 
challenges as i l lus t ra ted by Senegal’s p o o r ranking in D o i n g Business Ind ica to rs and the Bank ’s 
recent ROSC o n accoun t ing practices by the p r iva te sector.” W h i l e some spec i f ic in i t ia t ives 
have been launched, a m o r e concerted, b road based strategy i s requ i red . The Senegalese 
Gove rnmen t f ina l ized i t s new Accelerated G r ow t h Strategy in January 2007, w h i c h i s pa r t o f the 
second-generation PRSP (see n e x t section f o r details). This n ew approach i s expected t o help 
address hrther cross-sector issues related t o the inves tmen t c l ima te and p romo te five specific 
clusters that are pe rce ived by the Gove rnmen t t o have the highest comparative advantage f o r 
Senegal: (i) agribusiness; (ii) tourism; (iii) telecommunications and new technologies; 
(iv) textiles; and (v) fisheries. 

3.18 Many surveys, diagnoses and studies, including those emanating from the Bank 
Group, have already helped to reach a consensus regarding the major constraints faced by 
the private sector in Senegal (Box 3.2).” Building o n recommendations f r o m the Presidential 
Inves to rs ’ Councils, the authorities have im p r o v e d the business env i ronmen t by s t ream l in ing 
regu la t ions conce rn ing business reg is t ra t ion and taxation. In January 2004, the N a t i o n a l 
Assemb ly adopted re fo rms simplifying the corporate income tax and inves tmen t codes. The tax 
basis was broadened by e l im ina t ing several tax exemptions, and a single tax rep lac ing the 
income tax, the value-added tax, patent contributions, and social secu r i ty charges was in t roduced 
f o r sma l l enterprises. T h e new inves tmen t code broadened the scope o f eligible sectors t o take 
i n t o account PRSP p r io r i t ies and i t streamlined the system o f inves tmen t incentives.

3.19 O the r efforts have been launched t o im p r o v e access t o finance f o r p r iva te f i r m s , w h i c h i s 
v i ew e d as the mos t s ign i f ican t constraint f o r a lmos t two - th i rds o f p r iva te companies surveyed by 
the 2004 Inves tmen t C l ima te Assessment. This constraint i s especially s ign i f ican t f o r SMEs and 
micro-enterprises ope ra t ing in the i n f o rm a l sector, m o s t n o t a b l y in r u r a l areas, because o f the i r 
lack o f expertise and i n a b i l i t y t o p rov ide guarantees. This diagnosis was con f i rmed by the j o i n t 
Bank / IMF F i n a n c i a l Sector Assessment (FSAP). The Bank has supported re fo rms in the 
f inanc ia l sector th rough the ongo ing P r iva te Sector Adjustment C red i t (PSAC) with the 
res t ruc tu r ing o f the pos ta l and the pens ion systems. T h e res t ruc tu r ing o f the pos ta l system w i l l 
h e l p m o b i l i z e savings and fac i l i ta te access t o f inanc ing in r u r a l areas th rough i t s extensive 
reg iona l n e tw o r k and the a l loca t ion o f remittances (bo th f r o m Dakar and outside o f the country). 
The r e f o rm o f the pens ion system w i l l m o b i l i z e long - te rm savings and deepen the f inanc ia l 
market in Senegal. I F C i s considering inves t ing in t w o m ic ro f inance ins t i tu t ions geared t ow a r d 
lending t o micro-enterprises. 

3.20 T o enhance p r iva te sector development, Senegal w i l l need to : hrther increase 
p roduc t iv i ty ; boos t the q u a l i t y and p roduc t m i x o f Senegalese exports; increase p roduc t ive 
innovations; p romo te supply chains integration; and expand human cap i ta l th rough education 
achievements and the u s e o f expatriates in l o c a l p roduc t ion . The f o l l ow i n g l i s t suggests a s e r i e s 
o f p r io r i t ies f o r b o t h the short and m e d i um terms. 

3.21 The first priority i s to encourage competition in the formal industrial private sector, 
which lacks dynamism and adaptability to the new international environment. In spite o f 
the adop t ion o f the new West A f r i c a n Econom ic and M o n e t a r y U n i o n (WAEMU) c omm o n 
external t a r i f f in 1999 w h i c h has streamlined Senegal’s t a r i f f structure and reduced tariffs, this 
sector remains protected by high t a r i f f s and n o n - t a r i f f barriers (such as in the agribusiness 
sector). T h e 2003 Integrated Trade Repo r t reca l led that Senegal’s trade reg ime s t i l l deviates 
f r o m the WAEMU f ramewo rk in impo r tan t respects: (i) a 2 0 percent surtax o n impo r ts o f onions, 
potatoes, bananas, cigarettes, and r i c e and a 10 percent surtax o n some cereals such as millet and 
sorghum; and (ii) 798 tariff l ines (out o f 5,863) 
that do n o t have a tariff l i n e in WAEMU’s 
c omm o n ex te rna l ta r i f f . Some l o c a l products are fu r the r protected by d i f fe ren t ia ted excise taxes 

14 

o n im p o r t e d and l o c a l p roduc ts such as ed ib le o i l s and cigarettes.20 In some sectors, co l lus ive 
behav io rs by a few dom inan t f i rm s have p roduced s ign i f ican t costs f o r l o c a l consumers, r a i s i n 
p r ices above the i r in te rna t iona l levels ( fo r example, sugar, transportation, and groundnuts). 2 f 
Such behav io r and weak governance have also led t o f inanc ia l mismanagement in k e y sectors 
( I C s mining and SENE LEC electricity). At this stage, the Gove rnmen t w i l l p u s h f o r the 
e l im i n a t i o n o f the rema in ing specific taxes and n o n - t a r i f f ba r r ie rs in the sectors men t ioned above 
and f o r im p r o v e d governance in p u b l i c and p r iva te enterprises. 

3.22 
T o foster compe t i t ion , the Senegalese Gove rnmen t has p romo ted the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f n ew 
p r i v a t e operators, no tab ly in the in f ras t ruc tu re sector. A f t e r t w o fa i led p r i v a t i z a t i o n attempts in 
1995 and 1999, in M a r c h 2005 the authorities so ld the groundnut processing and vegetable o i l 
r e f i n i n g company (SONACOS ) t o the o n l y bidder that made an o f fe r . In the e lec t r ic i ty sector, 
the Gove rnmen t conc luded the process o f selecting an independent p r iva te p roduce r ( P P ) t o 
increase generation capacity by 67.5 Megawa t ts (MW) (equivalent t o about 14.6 percent). In the 
future, the Government w i l l p romo te h ighe r p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in in f ras t ruc tu re sectors 
(transports and energy). A necessary c o n d i t i o n w i l l b e t o im p r o v e the accoun t ing and aud i t 
systems f o r p u b l i c (and quasi pub l ic ) e n t e r p r i s e s and regulated p r iva te operators w h e n the re are 
res idua l m o n o p o l y powe rs . An e f fo r t w i l l also be pursued t o upgrade accoun t ing and repo r t ing 
practices in the p r iva te sector, a long the l ines suggested in the recent RO SC p roduced by the 
Bank . 

3.23 The second priority i s to support micro and small and medium enterprises, which 
account for more than half o f the Senegalese economy. Perhaps the greatest challenge fac ing 
Senegal, as the coun t ry attempts t o m o v e f r o m economic s tab i l i ty t o accelerated g r ow t h with 
equity, i s t o generate sustainable sources o f oppo r tun i ty f o r the ma rg ina l ized groups in society. 
This e f fo r t w i l l require the expansion o f micro-enterprises and sma l l and m e d i um f i r m s , w h i c h 
are the m a i n p rov ide rs o f jobs . Such f i r m s face a va r ie ty o f constraints, i n c l u d i n g l a c k o f access 
t o capital, weak techno logy and labo r s k i l l s , and poo r in teg ra t ion within supp l ie r and d is t r ibu t ion 
ne two rks . M o s t sma l l and med ium -s ized f i r m s do n o t have access t o p rope r ty r i g h t s ( inc lud ing 
land) and t o inexpens ive con f l ic t - reso lu t ion mechanisms, due t o the l a c k o f e f f i c i e n c y o f the 
j u d i c i a r y system and comp lex adm in is t ra t ive procedures. There i s n o s imp le answer t o these 
challenges but they have t o be at the center o f the new AGS . 

3.24 The third priority i s to optimize the perceived comparative advantage of the 
Senegalese economy in a few strategic sectors, and thus promote exports and/or job 
creation. The business p r i n c i p l e i s t o p u s h “what i s already m o v i n g ” and t o g i v e p r i o r i t y t o the 
sectors that have con t r ibu ted t o two - th i rds o f GD P g r ow t h in the recent past. Those are by order 
o f decreasing importance: communications, 
trade and f inanc ia l services, r e a l estate and 
construction, and ag r icu l tu re and agribusiness (Figure 3.1). Th is focused approach has already 
been adopted in the AGS (at least f o r two sectors) and shou ld be strengthened ove r the nex t few

Ass is t ing sma l l fanners and entrepreneurs in r u r a l areas i s essential because they are among the 
poorest segments o f the popu la t ion and the mos t exposed t o c l im a t i c and na tu ra l shocks. As a 
result, these groups a re the m a i n sources o f em ig ra t ion t ow a r d urban centers, especially Dakar.22 
The emergence o f new exports (such as f r e s h vegetables o f w h i c h exports boomed by 130 
percent be tween 2003 and 2005) appears p r om i s i n g and shou ld help d i v e r s i f y p roduc t ion and 
ag r icu l tu ra l exports away f r o m groundnuts. The recent increase in competitiveness o f the 
ag r icu l tu ra l sector in Senegal i s nonetheless l im i t e d t o a few loca t ions (Niayes, Senegal River 
Va l ley , and Casamance regions) and products. 
I t i s also pena l ized by comp lex relationships 
b e tw e e n t rad i t iona l and m o d e r n powers that make d i f f i c u l t access t o land and discourage site 
development because o f the l a c k o f guarantees and f inanc ia l resources. Furthermore, resource 
degradation i s a g r ow i n g challenge f o r Senegal, ranging f r o m de fo res ta t ion t o land degradation 
associated with p o o r wa te r resources management and the dep le t ion o f fish stocks. T h e

3.26 
T h e fou r th p r i o r i t y i s to increase the leve l o f skills a n d technology used b y the 
p r iva te sector in Senegal. As men t ioned earlier, t o be successful Senegal w i l l have to boost and 
diversify i t s exports, suggesting that i t s l o c a l p roduc t ion in k e y sectors (such as IC T , exports, and 
agriculture) w i l l have t o be a l igned with q u a l i t y standards defined by consumers in indus t r ia l ized 
markets. T h e recent know ledge assessment p roduced by W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te (WBI) o n Senegal 
reveals that i t ranked p o o r l y even among other Sub-Saharan countries (see Tab le 3.1). Senegal

T h e fifth and last p r i o r i t y i s to take advantage o f the presence o f m an y Senegalese

Senegal already bene f i ts f r o m s ign i f ican t remittances sent home by migrant wo rke rs and 
expatriates. W h i l e these funds help generate economic g r ow t h o n a na t iona l scale by f inanc ing 
the purchase o f consumer goods and rea l estate, they also represent a po ten t ia l source o f 
f inanc ing f o r m o r e in f ras t ruc tu re projects and p roduc t ive ac t iv i t ies o n a larger scale. A closer

In parallel, actions shou ld b e taken t o reverse the b r a i n drain23 and t o mo t iva te

and l ives tock sectors a imed at p r om o t i n g ac t iv i t ies in r u r a l areas. The PRSP - I1 discusses the 
la rge in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts that the Gove rnmen t p lans t o put in p lace ove r the n e x t f ew years, 
i n c l u d i n g the D i am n i a d i o indus t r ia l p la t fo rm , the Dakar-ThiBs h ighway , and the n ew airport. 
These p ro jec ts w i l l n o t o n l y p r o v i d e the necessary basis f o r p r iva te sector development, but w i l l 
also help d i v e r s i f y economic ac t iv i t ies away f r o m Daka r and i t s suburbs (w h i c h account f o r 
about 80 percent o f GDP o n less than one percent o f the na t iona l te r r i to ry ) . 

4.4 
The second pillar based on human development will continue to promote access to 
basic soc ia l services by a growing share of the population. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the na t iona l 
strategies in the education and hea l th sectors, as w e l l as new comm i tmen ts t o enhance n u t r i t i o n 
and access t o san i t iza t ion and water are the k e y elements o f the Government’s strategy. 

4.5 
The third pillar o f the PRSP-I1 emphasizes the need to improve the lives of 
vulnerable groups, an area w h i c h has been neglected so far, and prescribes actions t o ensure 
that these groups bene f i t f r o m wea l th c rea t ion and have better access t o soc ia l services. 
Vu lne rab le groups are numerous and diverse in Senegal, i n c l u d i n g children, handicapped, 
elderly, and refugees. T h e recent f ina l iza t ion o f the N a t i o n a l P ro tec t ion Strategy has helped build 
a consensus o n a selected set o f p r io r i t ies , i n c l u d i n g the need t o increase the coverage o f ex is t ing 
safety nets, p r o v i d e d i rec t fillancia1 assistance to targeted groups, and im p r o v e the Government’s 
capac i ty t o respond t o na tu ra l catastrophes and shocks. Such a concerted approach has he lped 
im p r o v e coo rd ina t ion be tween various stakeholders. 

4.6 
The fourth pillar on transparency and participatory processes i s justified by the 
need to strengthen the effectiveness of public spending (through efficient budgetary 
procedures and controls) as we l l as to promote private sector development (through less 
distortion and better access to justice). Imp rovemen t in governance w i l l b e ach ieved th rough 
re fo rms in the areas o f capacity building and f inanc ia l management in the p u b l i c sector. The 
Government intends to pursue imp lemen ta t ion o f two ac t ion plans suppo r t ing p u b l i c expenditure 
management 
reforms, as a 
f o l l ow up t o recommendations o f the C o u n t r y F inanc ia l 
Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (C F A A ) and the Coun t ry Procurement Assessment R e v i ew (CPAR). 
As pa r t o f their ob jec t ive t o im p r o v e the qua l i ty o f p u b l i c human resource management, the 
authorities have in i t ia ted c i v i l service re fo rms . They w i l l strengthen c i v i l servants by p r o v i d i n g 
t ra in ing in education, health, justice, tax collection, and security. Concurrently, the Gove rnmen t 
has in i t ia ted the imp lemen ta t ion o f a series o f re fo rms in i t s remune ra t ion p o l i c y a im i n g at: (i)

in light o f the r a p i d increase o f the wage b i l l in recent years; (ii) simplifying procedures; and (iii) 
in t roduc ing performance-based incentives. The PRSP-I1 also proposes an agenda o f re fo rms f o r

The Senegalese Government has initiated the decentralization o f decision-making 
with rega rd t o the management o f human and f inanc ia l resources, i n c l u d i n g the strengthening o f 
l o c a l governments’ capacities and the gradual transfer o f a number o f respons ib i l i t ies t o l o c a l 
communities, especially in the education and hea l th sectors. I t w i l l pursue the gradual 
decen t ra l iza t ion o f the execu t ion o f the Consolidated Inves tmen t Budget, and strengthening 
capac i ty building at the l o c a l leve l , w h i c h i s a prerequisite f o r successful decentralization. 

4.8 
B e y o n d the f o u r p i l l a r s men t ioned above, the Gove rnmen t has based i t s strategy o n a 
number o f guiding p r inc ip les that can b e summarized as fo l lows : 
(a) Preserve macroeconomic stability and reduce vu lne rab i l i ty to external shocks. 
The 
authorities recogn ize that ma in ta in ing f isca l and ex te rna l balances i s c ruc ia l f o r the 
success o f the i r med ium - te rm v is ion . They i n t e n d t o pursue p ruden t f isca l po l ic ies so that 
i n f l a t i o n and debt leve ls w i l l rema in in l i n e with the IMF and WAEMU targets. At the 
same time, they w i l l con t inue t o give special a t ten t ion t o the management o f external 
shocks by deve lop ing p reemp t ive instruments, by diversifying expo r t revenues, and by 
building up f inanc ia l reserves t o p ro tec t the ag r icu l tu ra l sector and the mos t vulnerable 
groups. 
(b) Promote equity and protect vulnerable groups. 
N o t o n l y w i l l the authorities a i m at 
inc reas ing the d e l i v e r y o f basic social services (education and health), but also at 
reduc ing ex is t ing inequa l i t ies in their access, w h i c h varies s i g n i f i c a n t l y depending o n the 
users’ income levels, gender and loca t ion . T h e y w i l l launch a n ew emp loymen t strategy 
that shou ld help p romo te j o b s f o r you th and women . T h e p ro tec t ion o f vu lne rab le groups 
w i l l rema in at the center o f the agenda, re f lec t ing the need t o b roaden the coverage o f 
ex is t ing social safety nets beyond f i v e percent o f the to ta l ac t ive popu la t ion , and t o secure 
better l iv ing cond i t ions f o r impo r tan t groups o f children, women, elderly, and disabled, 
mos t n o t a b l y in r u r a l areas. 
(c) Balance g row th between r u r a l and urban regions. As o f today, mos t economic ac t iv i t ies 
(about 9 0 percent o f GDP) and a la rge f rac t ion o f the p o p u l a t i o n are concentrated in the 
Daka r area, w h i c h represents less than 1 percent o f the na t iona l te r r i to ry . Such a 
disproportionate ou tcome has resulted in the de te r io ra t ion o f living cond i t ions and 
infrastructures in the D a k a r agglomeration, and has raised issues in t e rm s o f f o o d secu r i ty 
and the env i ronmen t . The Gove rnmen t has launched a tw o - f o l d strategy that aims 
s imu l taneous ly at im p r o v i n g cond i t ions in the Daka r area and p r om o t i n g economic 
oppo r tun i t ies in secondary c i t ies and r u r a l areas. The de loca l iza t ion o f economic 
ac t iv i t ies outside o f Daka r i s unde r preparation, th rough the cons t ruc t ion o f a new 
indus t r ia l p la t fo rm , a t o l l r o a d h ighway , and a n ew airport. The development o f new 
inves tmen t oppo r tun i t ies in the ag r icu l tu ra l sector i s being p romo ted in the Senegal R i v e r 
and Casamance regions. 
4.9 
The Government has stressed the need to increase its capacity to monitor progress 
and remove constraints that may emerge over time. The second PRSP, as w e l l as the AGS , 
p rov ide the roadmap f o r the n e x t few years. At th is stage, this b r o a d p o l i c y f ramewo rk needs t o 
be translated i n t o a strategic se t o f actions, with a precise t ime tab le and c lea r ly assigned 
responsibilities, and a full se t o f mon i to rab le actions and results with an appropriate p ro -poo r 
focus. The authorities w i l l also need t o c l a r i f y the link be tween the i r strategic choices and 
budgetary processes and allocations, n o t o n l y at the sector level, but also within sectors and 

19 

across regions. 
Im p r o v e d p r i o r i t i z a t i o n o f actions, clear leadership by dec is ion makers, and 
con t inued dialogue w i th donors and stakeholders w i l l b e key t o a successful imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the PRSP.

The Government and the WBG share a common vision on the ove ra l l objectives to 
be achieved in Senegal over the next few years . The WBG assistance p rog ram w i l l therefore

LESSONS 

FROM PAST EXPERIENCES AND CONSULTATION STRATEGY 

5.2 
This CAS capitalizes on lessons from the Bank’s past experience in Senegal and 
from a se r ies of directions derived from global and regional assessments. With regard to 
past experience, the recent IEG eva lua t ion suggests that WBG assistance shou ld a i m to : 
(i) strengthen the d ia logue and consensus with the Government; (ii) im p r o v e ha rmon iza t ion with 
donors; and (iii) p romo te syne rg ies be tween r u r a l and urban areas, no tab ly in the in f ras t ruc tu re 
sector. T h e C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t has also i d e n t i f i e d a number o f lessons ( f o r details see 
Annex 2). F i rs t , B a n k programs must be a l igned with government objectives t o a l lev ia te 
pove r ty , especially w i th the fou r th PRSP p i l l a r devo ted t o governance and the need t o p romo te 
further decen t ra l iza t ion and pa r t ic ipa to ry mechanisms. Second, Bank p rog rams must give 
special a t ten t ion t o the design and choices o f lending instruments, i n c l u d i n g clear, measurable 
outcomes. Third, close coo rd ina t ion w i th the Gove rnmen t and partners i s important, since the 
mos t successful Bank p ro jec ts have been those tha t have demonstrated a clear owne rsh ip by the 
authorities and synergies with other dono r programs. 

5.3 
The CAS incorporates guidance from recent experiences at the regional level. F o r 
example, Senegal has been selected as a p i l o t coun t ry in Sub-Saharan A f r i c a t o imp lemen t the 
Paris Dec la ra t ion agenda w h i c h stresses ownership, harmonization, a l i

5.4 
This CAS accounts for progress made in the management of the existing Bank’s 
portfolio in Senegal. The number o f p ro jec ts and the p o r t f o l i o compos i t ion have rema ined

Consu l ta t ion strategy. T h e Bank, in full coo rd ina t ion with the Government, h e l d a 
series o f consultations with va r ious segments o f c i v i l society and development partners in 
Senegal (see Annex 6 f o r details). T h e consultations started at the end o f April 2006, and 
cu lm ina ted in a one-day seminar in D a k a r in m id -June 2006. A p r e l im i n a r y ve rs ion o f the C A S 
was also presented in the qua r te r ly j o u r n a l pub l ished by the Bank ’s o f f i c e in D a k a r and bene f i ted

pillar we re organized t o encourage a discussion o f issues that are o f pa r t icu la r impo r tance t o a 
wide range o f stakeholders, such as governance (no tab ly th rough the G A C consultations). The 
Bank, in close coo rd ina t ion with the authorities and in l i n e w i th the Pa r is Dec la ra t ion agenda, 
also launched a survey o f donors ope ra t ing in Senegal. The su rvey has he lped t o iden t i fy : 
(i) current and p lanned disbursements; and (ii) ideas f o r strengthening cooperation with the 
Gove rnmen t and coo rd ina t ion among donors. T h e results, summa r ized in A n n e x 7 have he lped

PROPOSED BANK PROGRAMS AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES 

5.6 
T h e proposed C A S p l a t f o rm fo r FYO7-10 i s based on one governance f i l te r and 
th ree m a i n p i l la rs . Th is p l a t f o rm a ims n o t o n l y at addressing the country’s challenges but also 
at m a x im i z i n g synergies with the Government’s PRSP and the Bank’s AAP by using the WBG 
comparative advantage. The C A S seeks c o n t i n u i t y with the ongo ing r e f o rm programs, while 
m o v i n g g radua l ly t ow a r d a m o r e p rog ramma t ic approach. I t also p romo tes se lec t iv i ty by leav ing

the p r iva te sector and other donors, i n c l u d i n g in the water and r o a d sectors. In other sectors, 
complementarities are sought in t e r m s o f lending instruments with, f o r example, the Bank 
p r o v i d i n g budge ta ry support in the hea l th sector, while other donors focus o n inves tmen t

areas such as land, p rope r ty rights, labor, and env i ronmen ta l po l ic ies . 

5.8 
The governance f i l t e r w i l l w o r k in two ways in the WBG strategy: First, the proposed 
emphasis w i l l he lp im p r o v e the e f f ic iency o f sectoral operations and m i t iga te their r i s k s . Some 
examples o f the cross-cutting impac t o f this f i l te r are, in te r alia: (a) f iduc ia ry re fo rms o f the 
State, by strengthening budge ta ry procedures and securing better f inanc ia l transfers across 
sectors, w i l l he lp t o im p r o v e the e f f ic iency o f the Bank ’s l e n d i n g operations in the education and

5.9 
Overall, 
the WBG w i l l use three guiding p r inc ip les t o ensure that governance 
considerations are mainstreamed i n t o i t s programs in SenegaL 

1. 
Greater transparency and efficiency i n the use of p u b l i c resources 
5.10 There are several constraints t o ach iev ing greater transparency in the u s e o f p u b l i c 
resources that w i l l b e addressed during the C A S pe r iod . The WBG w i l l support the remova l o f 
these constraints th rough lending support, targeted assistance th rough the use o f trust Funds, and 
A n a l y t i c a l and A d v i s o r y W o r k in key areas, in partnership with the Government, c i v i l society, 
and donors. These constraints and re la ted B a n k support a re described b e l ow . 

5.1 1 Ensuring transparent public expenditure management and procurement procedures 
at both the central and loca l levels. The C F M C P A R ac t ion p lans have been ins t rumen ta l in

Progress was rea l ized in: (i) budget preparation th rough p rog ramma t ic budge t ing in seven k e y 
ministries at end 2006; and (ii) budget execution th rough decen t ra l iza t ion f r o m the Ministry o f 
Economy and Finance t o l i n e M in is t r ies . Coo rd ina t ion between the Gove rnmen t and donors has 
been enhanced by the c rea t ion o f the M u l t i -D o n o r Trust Fund w h i c h aims at im p r o v i n g capac i ty 
building in the above areas. Coo rd ina t ion continues t o be a k e y fac to r with the p repa ra t ion o f a 
new P u b l i c Expend i tu re F inanc ia l Assessment (PEFA), t o be ca r r ied ou t j o i n t l y by k e y donors in

Recent distress in p u b l i c o r quasi-public enterprises (such as I C s , the largest indus t r ia l p lan t in 
the coun t ry ) has revealed weak independent f inanc ia l con t ro ls and audits. T h e WBG has already

5.46 As a tangible step toward achieving these medium-term outcomes, the proposed 
CAS recognizes the regional dimension o f Senegal’s development as w e l l as the importance 
o f enhancing gender development and building loca l capacity. Senegal i s a key p laye r in 
Wes t A f r i c a and i t s economic development w i l l la rge ly in f luence and b e in f luenced by ex is t ing 
and po ten t ia l synergies with i t s neighbors. Several reg iona l operations and ana ly t ica l w o r k s are 
envisaged in the energy sector, the p r om o t i o n o f the Senegal R i v e r area, the r o a d sector with the 
development o f co r r ido rs w i th M a u r i t a n i a and T h e Gambia, and soc ia l sectors th rough reg iona l 
in i t ia t ives in hea l th (Malaria, A v i a n epidemic flu) and education (ne two rk o f te r t ia ry educa t ion 
and research ins t i tu tes ) . 

5.47 Success in the development o f Senegal w i l l also g rea t ly depend o n i t s capac i ty t o 
p romo te women, n o t o n l y in terms o f p r o v i d i n g them soc ia l p ro tec t ion and equal access to soc ia l 
services (education, health) but also in securing them m o r e and better j o b s ( B o x 5.1). 

Box 5.1: Gender Development in the CAS 

Gender development i s a key element o f C A S support in Senegal in various dimensions. First, the 
WBG w i l l support the authorities in the ir e f fo r t t o promo te j o b creation and s k i l l development fo r 
women through the imp lemen ta t ion o f the n ew na t iona l Emp loymen t Strategy ( through the nex t 
C E M and the PRSC series). I t w i l l also promo te credits t o women en trepreneurs and associations, 
mos t ly in ru ra l areas, through the IFC/IDA pa r t ia l guarantees schemes. Second, the Bank 
assistance in the education and hea l th sectors w i l l inc lude specific ac t iv i t ies targeted at women, 
such as increasing enro l lmen t o f girls in p r ima ry and secondary schools and imp rov ing ma terna l 
health. Third, gender equ i ty w i l l be at the center o f the agenda a imed at increasing the p ro tec t ion 
o f vulnerable groups through the res truc tur ing and extension o f ex is t ing soc ia l security systems 
and targeted f inanc ia l assistance programs. 

3 5 

5.48 Last but not least, the focus on capacity building i s justified because, in the absence 
of natural resources, Senegal’s future economic development w i l l be shaped by the quality 
of its labor force and entrepreneurs (training, education, knowledge dissemination) as we l l 
as the effectiveness of its public administration (civil service reform, strengthening 
institutions, decentralization, etc.). This focus i s envisioned in the f o l l o w i n g fou r dimensions: 
(i) development o f human resources that cu t across several areas (e.g., educa t ion p rog rams and 
voca t iona l t ra in ing as supported in the Educa t ion fo r A l l I1 p ro jec t and the PRSC program); (ii) 
enhancement o f spec i f ic s k i l l e d occupations (doctors, nurses, teachers, farmers, etc.) th rough 
ongo ing and p lanned p ro jec ts in the these sectors, the use o f T rus t Funds, and targeted AAA 
wo rk ; (iii) support t o capacity building o n governance issues i n c l u d i n g the j u s t i c e sector ( th rough 
the p lanned Jud ic ia l Governance Project) and ins t i tu t ions recen t ly built t o enhance transparency 
in b o t h the p u b l i c and the p r iva te sectors (such as the Cour des comptes, the Commission against 
co r rup t ion , and the ins t i tu t ions responsible f o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the new procurement 
Code); and (iv) support t o l o c a l Governments th rough the ongo ing and p lanned C D D operations.

DEL IVERY OF THE BANK’S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

5.49 The proposed CAS w i l l aim at maximizing the impact of the WBG’s assistance in 
Senegal through: (i) the use o f va r ious f inanc ia l instruments such as budge t support, single 
inves tmen t projects, and c omm u n i t y d r i v e n development in i t ia t ives ; (ii) m a x im i z i n g syne rg ies 
within the WBG; and (iii) leve rag ing f inanc ia l resources beyond the coun t ry a l loca t ion th rough 
partnerships and dono r coo rd ina t ion . 

5.50 Modalities and lending instruments. The WBG w i l l u s e va r ious mechanisms t o de l ive r 
i t s p rog ram o f assistance. Such a d ive rs i f ica t ion i s consistent with the ob jec t ive o f inc reas ing 
m u t u a l accoun tab i l i ty and a l i g n i n g disbursement procedures with na t iona l systems. I t i s also 
e f fec t ive in enhancing cross-sector externalities in areas such as budge ta ry and f inanc ia l reforms, 
decentralization, and the p ro tec t ion o f vu lne rab le groups. 
I t i s also key for im p r o v i n g the 
performance o f soc ia l sectors, w h i c h are highly dependent o n factors tha t are n o t under their 
d i rec t con t ro l ( fo r example, health-related issues in u rban areas are re la ted t o the lack o f access 
t o sanitation and water, w h i c h are p a r t l y the resu l t o f high imm i g r a t i o n rates). 

5.51 The WBG w i l l con t inue t o de l ive r investment p ro jec ts f o r a va r ie ty o f reasons. First, in 
spite o f recent progress and the cen t ra l p lace g iven by the WBG t o the imp rovemen t o f the 
Government’s budge ta ry procedures, severe weaknesses remain, mos t n o t a b l y in terms o f 
procurement and ex-post controls. This explains the con t inued use o f imp lemen ta t ion units, w i th 
the v i ew t o g radua l ly phas ing them out. Second, investment operations are o f ten considered as 
m o r e e f fec t ive in f inanc ing in f ras t ruc tu re w o r k (e.g., roads and energy) and in p r o v i d i n g 
techn ica l support at the sectoral and l o c a l levels (e.g., jus t ice and education). The Bank’s 
p o r t f o l i o w i l l also rely o n CDD - t y p e operations, w h i c h a i m at inc reas ing empowerment o f l o c a l 
commun i t ies and f i n a l beneficiaries, and strengthening the decen t ra l iza t ion process. 

5.52 
T o increase further the effectiveness o f Bank support, output-based approaches a re b e i n g 
p i l o t e d in the wa te r and the r u r a l e lec t r ic i ty sectors. These w i l l be evaluated during the CAS 
p repa ra t ion process and, based o n the i r resu l ts , w i l l be extended t o other ac t iv i t ies .

the WBG since mos t these instruments are expected to be p r o v i d e d by I F C and MIGA, under the 
f o r m o f guarantees o r fac i l i t ies . MIGA can m i t iga te pe rce ived p o l i t i c a l r i s k s o f p r iva te sector

Partnerships and donor coordination. 
Because o f i t s strategic role, and i t s good 
development outcomes, Senegal’s development p rog ram has bene f i ted f r o m la rge fo re ign a i d 
support. M o s t b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l development agencies have an active presence in 
Senegal, with the Bank, the European Un ion , France and the United States being the largest 
con t r ibu to rs . Considerable progress has been made in recent years in ha rmon iz ing development 
assistance in Senegal. These ha rmon iza t ion e f fo r ts are consistent with the p r inc ip les a r t icu la ted 
in the Paris Dec la ra t ion o n A id Effectiveness and in the AAP. I t has led t o a close co l labo ra t ion 
in the design o f budge t support operations, i n c l u d i n g the Bank ’s PRSC. Fu r the r coo rd ina t ion i s 
expected th rough the adop t ion o f a Memo randum o f Unde rs tand ing (MOU), setting up c omm o n 
eva lua t ion processes o n the macroeconomic conditions, the PRSP progress, and p u b l i c sector 
management re fo rms . At the sectoral leve l , an e x p l i c i t e f f o r t was made by the Bank ’s t o foster 
j o i n t p ro jec ts with other donors in the in f ras t ruc tu re and u rban renewal, the r u r a l sector 
operations and the Educa t ion SWAP. At the end o f 2005, 8 ou t o f 16 o f IDA -suppo r ted 
inves tmen t p ro jec ts we re co - f inanced with other donors, w h i c h i s m u c h h ighe r than the average 
in Senegal (one ou t o f f o u r projects). 

5.55 Nevertheless, as described in Annex 7 , progress s t i l l needs t o b e made o n several fronts, 
i n c l u d i n g better coo rd ina t ion among donors that shou ld lead t o a reduc t ion in the number o f 
p ro jec ts and im p r o v e d a l ignmen t with respect t o PRSP p r io r i t ies . F o r example, the p ro tec t ion o f 
vu lne rab le groups (PRSP third p i l l a r ) o n l y bene f i ted f r o m m a r g i n a l a t ten t ion f r o m donors. There

a i d f l ow s over t im e and m a x im i z e complementarities be tween donors and the Gove rnmen t as 
well as among donors. Seeking partnerships w i l l b e at the center o f the Bank’s agenda ove r the

D. 

LENDING AND THE AAA SUPPORT PROGRAM 

5.57 The CAS proposes a lending program which w i l l aim to optimize the WBG’s 
assistance given government priorities and donor collaboration (Table 5.2). The p rog ram i s 
based o n a to ta l envelope o f IDA resources o f US $ 4 2 0 m i l l i o n over the four-year C A S p e r i o d o r 
an average o f U S $ l 0 5 m i l l i o n a year. G i v e n that I D A - 1 5 resources are ye t t o b e determined, i t i s 
assumed f o r s imp l ic i ty , that the l e v e l o f IDA resources during the IDA-1 5 p e r i o d w i l l correspond 
t o the l e v e l unde r ID A - 1 4 . A c t u a l allocations during the C A S p e r i o d w i l l b e de te rm ined o n an 
annua l basis and w i l l depend on: (i) to ta l IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s pe r fo rmance 
rating3’; (iii) the performance o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the numbe r o f ID A - e l i g i b l e countries; 
and (v) terms o f f inanc ia l assistance (grants o r credits). 

5.58 The IDA financing ove r the CAS period w i l l be constrained, partly as the result of 
the recent multilateral debt reduction initiative (MDRI),32 justifying the search for 
alternative channels to help increase the financial impact of the WBG lending program. 
The f i r s t channel, as exp la ined earlier, w i l l b e t o conceive B a n k p ro jec ts in a w a y tha t 
sys tema t ica l ly max im izes scope f o r pa ra l le l o r co - f inanc ing with donors as w e l l as p r iva te 
pa r t ic ipa t ion , especially in the in f ras t ruc tu re sector, i n c l u d i n g under the innova t ive t o l l - r o a d 
project, and f o r PPs . The second channel w i l l b e t o exp lo re the p o s s i b i l i t y t o access add i t iona l 
funding in F Y 0 8 th rough scale up in i t ia t ives in the A f r i c a region.. 

5 . 5 9 The proposed lending program aims at balancing the WBG’s assistance across the 
three key pillars and the governance filter. Support t o the th ree C A S pillars i s aggregated in 
F i g u r e 5.1, based o n the ex is t ing p o r t f o l i o o f operations and a tentative lend ing p rog ram f o r 
FYO7 -FY10 . I t shows that the Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o w i l l be equa l ly divided be tween p i l l a r s I and I11 
(with a share o f 44 percent and 4 0 percent o f to ta l lending respectively), w h i l e p i l l a r I1 w i l l 
rece ive about 16 percent o f the Bank’s assistance over the C A S pe r iod . This a l loca t ion re f lec ts 
the capital-intensive in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts in the urban infrastructure, energy and wa te r sectors 
and n o t a bias against human development and shared g row th . I t also takes i n t o account (i) the 
g r ow i n g Government’s f inanc ia l invo lvemen t in human development; a lmos t h a l f o f the budget 
i s n o w allocated to soc ia l sectors, and (ii) the cons t ruc t ive d ia logue t o im p r o v e the e f f i c i e n c y o f 
these expenditures. The WBG w i l l con t inue t o ac t ive ly support the education and hea l th sectors

5.60 The F Y 0 7 lend ing p rog ram inc ludes PRSC-I11 and inves tmen t p ro jec ts t o support 
infrastructure, decentralization, and social sectors. PRSC-I11 w i l l con t inue t o p r o v i d e support t o

Pove r ty studies that became available after the comp le t ion o f the p rev ious C A S ind ica te 
tha t the degree o f pove r ty reduc t ion was greater than h a d been estimated, but with greater impac t 
o n the u rban popu la t ion than o n the r u r a l one. Nevertheless p o v e r t y in Senegal remains high and 
there i s n o r o o m f o r complacency i f the p o v e r t y MDG i s t o b e attained. B a n k support o f the 
g r ow t h agenda under the p rev ious C A S constitutes an appropriate response, and bene f i ts f r o m 
added emphasis under the new PRS and the p roposed C A S . In addition, the re have been no tab le 
e f fo r ts t o re in fo rce the impac t o f p u b l i c expenditures o n the poor, n o t a b l y th rough f isca l 
decen t ra l iza t ion and enhanced social protection, w h i c h w i l l be sustained and deepened under the 
p roposed n ew WBG p rog ram . 

6.4 
The debt sus ta inab i l i ty risk has been reduced t o neg l ig ib le levels. H a v i n g reached the 
H I P C C om p l e t i o n Po in t in April 2004, Senegal n o w bene f i ts f r o m MDRI and enjoys a 
s ign i f ican t f isca l space that has led t o the f inanc ing o f co re p rog rams w i t h o u t excessive re l iance 
on foreign b o r r ow i n g . Mo reove r f isca l expansion, m a i n l y la rge in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts in the 
P u b l i c Inves tmen t Program, are being f inanced th rough o w n resources, the p r iva te sector, and 
grant and concessional f inanc ing . Future debt service i s p ro jec ted t o rema in l o w and at 
sustainable levels. 

Em e rg ing Risks 

6.5 
There are several possible r isks associated w i th the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S and the 
Government’s PRSP and AGS, w h i c h can be g rouped i n t o three m a i n categories: (i) governance 
and resistance t o p o l i c y re fo rms f r o m vested interests; (ii) vu lne rab i l i ty t o po l i t ica l , economic, 
and other in te rna l o r ex te rna l shocks, and v o l a t i l i t y o f dono r support; and (iii) insu f f ic ien t 
capac i ty t o imp lemen t re fo rms and sustain g row th . 

6.6 
T h e challenges o f imp rov ing governance. 
Ves ted interests and rent-seekers have 
fo rmed s ign i f ican t obstacles t o re fo rms in the past. Recent p res iden t ia l and f o r t h c om i n g 
leg is la t ives elections in the coun t ry have re in fo rced this tendency, as po l icymake rs have been 
m o r e interested in their p o l i t i c a l su rv iva l than in imp lemen t ing the longe r - te rm economic r e f o rm 
agenda. 
I n f l u e n t i a l groups have thus unde rm ined po l ic ies , n o t a b l y in the energy sector and 
parastatals such as IC s , lead ing to a f inanc ia l c r is is in these two sectors and a f fec t ing the size o f 
the ove ra l l p u b l i c (and quasi-public) de f ic i t . Funding o f p o l i t i c a l pa r t ies and election-related 
expenditures have been longs tand ing un reso lved issues in democratic nations, r i c h and poo r . 
The mitigating factors in p lace inc lude pa r l iamen ta ry ove rs igh t ove r p u b l i c expenditures and 
stricter obse rva t ion o f procurement r u l e s . T h e app l ica t ion o f the Bu i ld ing -Ope ra t ion -T rans fe rs 
(BOT) l a w also p rov ides a transparent f ramewo rk f o r p r iva te -pub l ic partnership. 

6.7 
Encou rag ing ly , experience has shown that the f i rs t part o f the mandate o f a n ew 
administration, m u c h o f the C A S period, p rov ides a g o o d oppo r tun i ty f o r b o l d re fo rms in b o t h 
p o l i c y and governance areas. The many dimensions o f governance range f r o m p u b l i c finance 
management i s s u e s to enab l ing a good inves tmen t c l ima te th rough p u b l i c accoun tab i l i ty and the 
a b i l i t y o f the j u d i c i a l system t o empower i t s citizens, by en fo rc ing the rights and de l ive r f a i r and 
consistent judgments. Based o n ongo ing dialogue in these areas, the p roposed C A S supports 
im p r o v e d transparency and governance in Senegal by ma ins t ream ing these i s s u e s in B a n k 
p ro jec ts and programs, no tab ly as a centerpiece f o r the PRSC. 
Im p r o v e d m o n i t o r i n g and 
eva lua t ion systems ensure that the goals are being attained ove r t ime .

6.8 
Vulnerability to internal and external shocks. Thanks t o the robustness o f reg iona l 
mone ta ry arrangements, the re la t ive ly com fo r tab le 
f isca l situation, and Senegal’s other 
geographic and other advantages, the risk o f s ign i f ican t macroeconomic slippage in the f o r m o f 
unsustainable i n f l a t i o n o r sustained negative g r ow t h i s m i n im a l . There i s the m o r e ins id ious risk 
o f stalled g r ow t h and/or vu lne rab i l i ty t o na tu ra l disasters and external shocks, such as the 2002 
d rough t w h e n GDP g r ow t h dec l ined t o 1.1 percent, the locus t invas ion in 2004, con t inued o i l 
p r i c e increases, the recent f l o o d in the Dakar reg ion (August 2005), and the poss ib le av ian flu 
pandemic. T h e Government and donors have been able t o respond th rough the funding o f 
remed ia l actions. W h i l e v o l a t i l i t y o f dono r support c o u l d also have a nega t ive impact, this r i s k i s 
n o t considered s ign i f ican t and i s la rge ly m i t i g a t e d by MDRI. 

6.9 
An in te rna l risk concerns lack o f economic d ive rs i ty . The l i m i t e d f o rm a l p r iva te sector 
also increases the vu lne rab i l i ty o f the Senegalese economy t o terms-of-trade shock. The C A S 
has p laced an emphasis o n channels a imed at reduc ing this risk by p r o v i d i n g assistance t o the 
ag r icu l tu ra l sector and vu lne rab le groups that are the mos t exposed t o these na tu ra l shocks. I t 
also puts a m a j o r emphasis o n enab l ing p r iva te sector-led g row th . 

6.10 Senegal i s vulnerable t o reg iona l ins tab i l i ty . In Casamance, with a m i n o r i t y o f rebe l 
groups s t i l l n o t signatory t o the peace accord, m i l i t a r y ac t ion p i c k e d up in M a r cW A p r i l 2006. 
Nevertheless, the Gove rnmen t remains comm i t ted t o seeking p o l i t i c a l and economic solutions. 
P o l i t i c a l i n s t a b i l i t y in ne ighbo r ing countries has and i s likely t o con t inue t o a f fec t the economy. 
The re i s also a risk associated with de te r io ra t ion in reg iona l po l ic ies o n k e y areas such as trade 
po l icy , in f ras t ruc tu re projects, and f inanc ia l and compe t i t ion po l ic ies . Senegal’s progress w i l l 
depend o n sustainable progress in these areas because o f the l im i t e d size o f i t s l o c a l ma rke t and 
s ign i f ican t economic reg iona l externalities within WAEMU and E C OW A S . T o th is effect, the 
C A S supports further reg iona l in teg ra t ion . 

6.11 
Capacity constraints. 
A c h i e v i n g the C A S and PRS objectives c o u l d become m o r e 
d i f f i c u l t as a resu l t o f insu f f ic ien t adm in is t ra t ive capac i ty in Senegal, shortages o f s k i l l s and s low 
p rog ram imp lemen ta t ion . This risk i s h ighes t at the sectoral l e v e l and in l o c a l Governments, 
even though the authorities have been a l loca t in m o r e resources t o this objective, especially in 
the i r n ew PRS. To m i t iga te this r isk , the WBG and other donors have inc reas ing ly given m o r e 
a t ten t ion t o this i s s u e by conso l ida t ing the i r strategy towa rd l o c a l commun i t ies and p r o v i d i n g 
d i rec t support t o k e y sectors such as education, health, and governance. Pay and c i v i l service 
r e f o rm w o u l d also help in the re ten t ion o f expertise.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING & EVALUATION 

6.12 The measurement of results i s an essential component o f improved mutual 
accountability and mitigated risks. T h e WBG w i l l p r im a r i l y depend o n three comp lemen ta ry 
channels t o m o n i t o r C A S progress ove r t ime . 

6.13 The first channel i s to use the current PRSP institutional framework for the 
compilation and verification of results and milestones. This f ramewo rk i s built around fou r 
w o r k i n g groups representing the m a i n actors ope ra t ing in Senegal: (i) cen t ra l Gove rnmen t 

33 M o s t r e c e n t l y in the con tex t o f w o r k o n the c a p a c i t y p i l l a r o f the AAP. 

44 

 
m in is t r ies and agencies; (ii) l o c a l governments; (iii) c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector; and (iv) 
donors. These fou r groups are coordinated by the PRSP unit, w h i c h repo r t t o b o t h a techn ica l 
Comm i t tee cha i red by the Minister o f Economy and F inance and an In te rm in is te r ia l Comm i t tee 
chaired by the Prime M i n i s t e r . This f ramewo rk has been ope ra t ing f o r the past two years, 
f u e l i n g the des ign and p repa ra t ion o f the new PRSP. The WBG has p layed a cen t ra l r o l e in co- 
cha i r ing the donors’ w o r k i n g group. 

6.14 The second channel i s to continue to review the Bank’s portfolio on a quarterly 
basis, in close collaboration with the authorities and implementing agencies, to identify 
current constraints and future issues. Such rev iews a re one o f the reasons exp la in ing higher 
disbursements ra t ios ove r the past few years, as po in ted ou t in the C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t 
(Annex 2). Once a year, those reviews w i l l be complemented by a m o r e detailed evaluation 
exercise o f the Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o , i n c l u d i n g with the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f m a j o r stakeholders operating 
in Senegal. 

6.15 The third channel i s to closely monitor the results framework proposed in Annex 1 
in the areas supported by the CAS. A se t o f in te rmed ia ry ind ica to rs o r milestones has been 
identified that shou ld h e l p evaluate progress ove r time, i n c l u d i n g the C A S progress repo r t 
scheduled f o r ea r ly F Y 0 9 . This m o n i t o r i n g w i l l b e re in fo rced by the series o f AAA de f ined in 
Tab le 5.2.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

7.1 
The next four years w i l l be critical for Senegal. T h e coun t ry has made s ign i f ican t 
progress by ach iev ing p o l i t i c a l and macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , m a i n t a i n i n g a strong f isca l position, 
and defining a clear medium-term v i s i o n in i t s PRSP strategy. T h e n e x t step f o r Senegal w i l l be 
t o reach the l e v e l o f emerging countries by taking full advantage o f i t s ins t i tu t ions and people. 
This w i l l requ i re a sustained e f fo r t in man-made areas such as governance, Gove rnmen t efficacy, 
ease in d o i n g business, and the i n c l u s i o n o f vulnerable groups t o ensure that g r ow t h i s shared 
ove r time. The WBG w i l l con t inue t o p r o v i d e full support f o r Senegal’s e f fo r ts t o these ends.

Introduction 

1. 
T h e Senegal C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t assesses the impac t and effectiveness o f the 2003 
C A S in ach iev ing i t s in tended results be tween FY03 and FY06. W h i l e the i n i t i a l C A S p e r i o d 
was FY03 t o FY05, the Coun t ry D i r e c t o r agreed t o assess, w h e n possible, the impac t f o r an ex t ra 
year due t o f ina l iza t ion o f the second Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) o n l y in October 
2006. Furthermore, due t o delays in the effectiveness o f a numbe r o f p ro jec ts and the extension 
o f 10 projects, the ava i lab i l i ty o f i n f o rm a t i o n th rough ICR s o n l y recen t ly became available.34 

2 . 

The 2003 C A S was based o n th ree pillars that m i r r o r those o f Senegal’s f i rs t PRSP: (i) 
wea l th creation; (ii) capacity building and p r om o t i n g soc ia l services; and (iii) im p r o v i n g the 
living cond i t ions o f vulnerable people. The f o u r t h pillar o f Imp lemen ta t ion o f the Strategy was 
n o t evaluated since i t was part and pa rce l o f each p i l l a r and was p resumab ly meant t o emphasize 
the coun t ry management p r i o r i t y . This C A S was prepared p r i o r t o the advent o f the results-based 
approach and thus an attempt was made t o r e t r o f i t the results m a t r i x t o assess progress. 
Baselines we re taken p r im a r i l y f r o m P ro jec t App ra isa l Documen ts and ISRs, and outcomes we re 
ob ta ined p r im a r i l y f r o m ICR s o r ISRs f o r cu r ren t projects. Sector data was inserted where 
available, though n o direet a t t r ibu t ion i s being made that p ro jec t in te rven t ions con t r ibu ted t o 
sector o r coun t ry outcomes o r MDGs. This repo r t bene f i ted f r o m in te rna l consultations with 
selected coun t ry team members and f r o m a b roade r discussion with the full coun t ry team, the 
Government, and p ro jec t coordinators b e t w e e n June and October 2006. 

3. 
The C A S comp le t ion repo r t concludes tha t the Bank’s assistance t o the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f Senegal’s f i r s t PRSP th rough FY03-FY06 has been moderately satisfactory. U n d e r the 
wea l th c rea t ion p i l la r , the Bank p rog ram supported the government’s good mac roeconom ic 
pe r fo rmance where average annual GD P g r ow t h during the p e r i o d was a round 6 percent, tax 
revenues increased dramatically, even while m a r g i n a l income tax rates o n cap i ta l inves tmen t 
dec l ined f r o m 45 t o 28 percent, s ign i f ican t ly im p r o v i n g f isca l space. Progress in ag r icu l tu re 
exports and re fo rms in trade and p r i c e l i b e r a l i z i n g have been m ixed . 
Imp rovemen ts in the 
inves tmen t c l ima te have been modest as evidenced by the lack o f progress in the score o f D o i n g 
Bus iness . The reco rd o f p r iva t iza t ion has also been m ixed , succeeding in wa te r and sanitation, 
airline, ra i l road , but less so in e lec t r ic i ty and the P o r t o f Daka r . 

34 A number o f reports and diagnostic studies have in formed the preparation o f t h i s report: the Independent 
Evaluation Group (IEG) Country Assistance Evaluation FY94-FY04, (2006); 
I E G Project Evaluations; 
Implementation Completion Reports, Implementation Status and Results Reports ( ISRs) o f projects that are 
ongoing; the I M F Ex Post Assessment o f Longer-Term Program Engagement; Qua l i ty Assurance Group Reports; 
Senegal Client Survey Report 2000; Joint I D A - IM F S ta f f Adv isory No te o f the PRSP 2nd Annual Progress Report

U n d e r capac i ty building and support f o r soc ia l services, the substantial investment in 
water and sanitation p r o v i d e d m u c h needed services, attracted p r iva te investment, and made the 
sector m o r e f inanc ia l ly viable. This success s to ry i s likely t o help Senegal achieve i t s M D G s in 
th is sector. 
In the education sector, Senegal i s also likely t o achieve i t s MDG o f primary 
en ro l lmen t rates; though a numbe r o f qua l i ty and equity issues r em a i n in the sector. M a j o r 
p o l i c y reversal in h ighe r education se t back a key re fo rm . Preliminary e f fo r ts t o build the 
capac i ty o f the H e a l t h and Educa t ion m in is t r ies t o manage and imp lemen t re fo rms were n o t 
successful but recent imp rovemen ts occurred th rough the u s e o f the series o f Pove r ty Reduc t ion 
Support C red i ts (PRSCs). Access t o hea l th services have n o t expanded as m u c h as anticipated 
and Senegal i s unlikely t o achieve i t s MDGs in th is sector. Progress in comba t ing H I V / A I D S has 
been m ixed , w i th some success in setting up na t iona l institutions, but u t i l i z a t i o n o f V C T services 
has been s low t o meet expectations (even though s ign i f ican t progress was achieved in 2006). 
The reco rd f o r transportation and urban m o b i l i t y has been m ixed . A s ign i f ican t bottleneck, 
Daka r and other m a j o r c i t ies s u f f e r f r o m extreme congestion with l o n g delays in r o a d w o r k .

On support t o vu lne rab le groups, the B a n k has been successful in building the capacity o f 
l o c a l governments and commun i t ies in imp lemen t ing p ro jec ts that have im p r o v e d service 
de l ive ry and economic ac t iv i t ies ta rge t ing the neediest. The n u t r i t i o n p r o g r am i s a m a j o r success 
s to ry in Senegal, manag ing t o exceed i t s key targets o f reduc ing m a l n u t r i t i o n th rough a comp lex

very sma l l league o f Sub- Saharan A f r i c a n countries l i k e l y t o a t ta in i t s MDG f o r nu t r i t ion . 

6. 
O v e r a l l B a n k pe r fo rmance has been satisfactory and i t continues t o p l a y a key r o l e in 
p o l i c y discussions. Re la t ions be tween the Bank and Government have im p r o v e d ove r the past

continues. I t has also managed t o m o b i l i z e and leverage s ign i f ican t amount o f dono r resources.

The f ina l iza t ion o f the f i r s t PRSP in June 2002 was an impo r tan t step fo rwa rd in 
launch ing a comprehensive development strategy focused o n p o v e r t y reduc t ion in Senegal. The 
strategy was built o n fou r m a i n p i l la rs : (i) wea l th c rea t ion th rough economic r e f o rm and p r iva te 
sector development; (ii) capacity building and development o f soc ia l services; (iii) imp rovemen ts 
in the living cond i t ions o f the poor; and (iv) imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy and m o n i t o r i n g o f i t s 
outcomes. 

K e y strategic elements o f the strategy were: 

P romo te g o o d governance and strengthen the r u l e o f law ; 
Re in fo rce l o c a l development by strengthening decen t ra l iza t ion and good governance; 
Accelerate the development o f basic in f ras t ruc tu re t o enlarge access t o services and t o 
develop human capital; 
Increase inves tmen t and competitiveness o f the p roduc t ive system, by inves t ing in 
infrastructures that support production; 
Pursue reg iona l in teg ra t ion and in te rna t iona l cooperation; 
P rov ide i n f o rm a t i o n f o r development and encourage the use o f m o d em research and new 
i n f o rm a t i o n technologies; 
Ra t iona l management o f na tu ra l resources and the env i ronmen t f o r sustainable 
development; and 
A s s i s t vu lne rab le groups and t o reduce gender inequa l i t ies . 

PRSP implementation. _ . As summarized by the authorities in the i r two PRSP Progress 
Reports in 2004 and 2005,35 progress in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy has been unequal. 
The authorities emphasized the progress rea l ized in strengthening the f i r s t p i l l a r with appropriate 
mac roeconom ic po l ic ies , imp rovemen ts in the inves tmen t c l ima te th rough tax, regu la to ry and 
adm in is t ra t ive reforms, and structural re fo rms in the g roundnu t sector. Yet, they also recogn ized 
that fu r the r imp rovemen ts are needed t o foster a sustained r ise in p r iva te inves tmen t and exports. 
Conce rn ing the second p i l la r , they po in ted t o progress in hea l th and education, but at a pace 
(especially in health) that might n o t b e su f f ic ien t t o a t ta in the MDGs. T h e authorities also 
emphasized their need t o consolidate f isca l transparency, as well as strengthen in te rna l and 
external budge ta ry con t ro ls . Rega rd ing the p ro tec t ion o f vu lne rab le groups, they repo r ted that 
inc reas ing funds we re allocated t o support ch i ld ren and women, but that the re were gaps in 
programs suppo r t ing handicapped and elderly, as well as the development o f in f ras t ruc tu re 
benefiting the poorest segments o f the popu la t ion . The m i x e d pe r fo rmance o f Senegal i s 
re f lec ted in i t s uneven gains towa rd reach ing the long-term MDGs (as repo r ted in Tab le 2.3 o f 
the m a i n text).

10. Macroeconomic performance. Ove r the past decade, rea l GDP grew o n average by 
about 5 percent annually, marking the first sustained increase in average pe r cap i ta g r ow t h in 
Senegal since independence. Econom ic pe r fo rmance was s t rong in 2004 and 2005 but i s 
expected t o be weaker in 2006. W h i l e indus t r ia l a c t i v i t y s lowed d o w n as o i l p r ices rose, the 
impac t o n the ove ra l l economy was limited due t o the dynam ism o f the te lecommun ica t ion and 
cons t ruc t ion sectors. I n f l a t i o n rema ined subdued, with the annual average C P I r i s i n g by about 
0.5 percent in 2004 and about 2.0 percent in 2006, re f lec t ing the l o w weight o f energy in the C P I 
basket and l im i t e d r i s e in some f o o d prices o w i n g t o abundant supply. 

11. 
A l t h o u g h the ove ra l l f isca l d e f i c i t increased t o 3.3 and 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2004 and 
2005 and i s expected t o attain close t o 5.7 percent o f GDP in 2006, the f isca l stance rema ined 
consistent w i th the authorities’ goa l o f p rese rv ing debt sustainability. The good revenue 
pe r fo rmance has he lped t o compensate f o r higher than expected current and inves tmen t spending 
as well as s ign i f ican t transfers t o the energy sector.36 Recent economic pe r fo rmance has been 
associated w i th a w iden ing o f the current account d e f i c i t f r o m 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2002 t o 
ove r 12.0 percent o f G D P in 2006. Th is de te r io ra t ion was d r i v e n by s t rong domestic demand, 
m a i n l y f r o m the p u b l i c sector, higher than expected energy imports, and lack lus te r expo r t

Poverty trend. The latest househo ld su rvey indicates that the share o f the popu la t ion 
living in pove r ty decreased f r o m 67.9 percent in 1994 (61 .4pe rcen t o f households) 
t o 
57.1 percent in 2001 (48.5 percent o f households), t o 54 percent in 2004. T h i s t rend represents a 
s ign i f ican t achievement by b o t h h is to r ica l and reg iona l  standard^.^' T h i s pos i t ive e v o l u t i o n 
needs t o b e qua l i f ied o n th ree accounts: (i) the number o f p o o r households remains ex t reme ly 
high in the country, no tab ly in the r u r a l areas whe re 2/3 o f the p o o r are located; (ii) the decrease 
was la rge r in Daka r and other urban centers than in r u r a l areas; and (iii) perceptions o f p o v e r t y 
show a disconnect with these results, since two - th i rds o f households i d e n t i f y themselves as poo r 
and one - th i rd o f p o o r and non -poo r alike, fee l that p o v e r t y has subs tan t ia l ly increased in the i r 
c omm u n i t y over the last f i v e years.

Evaluating the Results of the 2003 CAS 

13. 
T h e 2003 C A S was o rgan ized t o support three key PRSP pillars: (i) wea l th creation; (ii) 
strengthening the de l ive ry o f soc ia l services; and (iii) im p r o v i n g the p ro tec t ion o f vu lne rab le 
groups. While the 2003 C A S h a d a l i s t o f Results Ind ica to rs in Tab le 8, a long w i th ind ica t ive

shou ld cau t ion against making generalized inferences that p ro jec t outcomes con t r ibu ted d i r e c t l y 
t o sector outcomes o r coun t ry outcomes such as MDGs. 

14. 
In ea r ly 2006, the Independent Eva lua t ion G roup (IEG) prepared a C o u n t r y Assistance 
Eva lua t ion cove r ing 1994-2004. The repo r t conc luded that “the Bank’s strategy during the 
p e r i o d was re levan t t o Senegal’s situation.’’ 
I t added, however, that a s ign i f ican t sho r tcom ing 
was the assumption that urban-based development w o u l d spread i n t o r u r a l areas w h i c h did n o t 
address the u rban - ru ra l inequ i t ies in access t o health, education, wa te r and sanitation. These 
shortcomings, however, were m i t i g a t e d in la rge part by the successful imp lemen ta t ion o f PNIR 
and the r u r a l e lec t r i f ica t ion p ro jec t . W h i l e the issue o f governance was h igh l igh ted , the Bank’s 
e f fo r ts focused la rge ly o n p u b l i c f inanc ia l management, p rocu remen t and j u d i c i a l reform, w h i c h 
as the repo r t highlights are d i f f i c u l t issues t o tack le and the Bank has l i m i t e d experience in 
addressing wo r ldw ide . 

Pillar I: Wealth Creation 

15 . 
Support t o PRSP P i l l a r I was seen as essential t o p romo te economic g r ow t h and diversify 
ac t iv i t ies as a channel t o reduce Senegal’s vu lne rab i l i ty t o ex te rna l shocks. The emphasis was 
g i v e n t o the f o l l ow i n g outcomes: (i) p r om o t i o n o f ag r icu l tu ra l /p r ima ry sector activities; (ii) 
support t o im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t c l ima te / business environment; (iii) developments o f 
e lec t r ic i ty infrastructure; and (iv) ma in ta in ing a sound macroeconomic f ramewo rk . The ove ra l l 
eva lua t ion ranges f r o m unsatisfactory (outcome 3) t o satisfactory (outcome 4). The desc r ip t ion 
o f the expected C A S outcomes, progress ind ica to rs and lessons lea rned a r e summarized in Tab le

ISSUES 
AND LESSONS 

The overa l l strategy has been to establish a framework 
fo r ach iev ing un iversa l p r im a r y education by: (i) 
increasing coverage & equity through the expansion o f 
p r im a r y & l ow e r secondary enrollment, especially g i r ls 
and ch i ld ren in under-served regions; (ii) im p r o v i n g 
qua l i ty & in te rna l e f f ic iency o f p r ima ryheconda ry 
through the reduc t ion o f dropou t and repe t i t ion rates, esp. 
in mayunde r -se rved areas t h r u school grants, p i l o t 
p r im a r y education in na t iona l languages, im p r o v i n g 
teacher tra in ing ; and (iii) strengthening capacity f o r 
decentralized management through imp roved f inanc ia l 
and budget management systems and programs fo r 
teacher career management. 
F o r the QEA , the ob jec t ive t o imp lemen t a f ramewo rk 
f o r qua l i ty educa t ion was achieved. Senegal was able to 
ma in ta in a sustainable increase in terms o f access to 
education th rough cons truc t ing su f f ic ien t number o f 
schools, rec ru i t ing required number o f teachers, 
trans ferr ing enough respons ib i l i t ies f o r manag ing the 
education sector t o decentralized departments. These 
e f for ts were sustained by a favorable budget a l loca t ion to 
p r im a r y education. 
The ob jec t ive in terms o f p r im a r y school enro l lmen t 
was achieved and w i l l a l l ow Senegal t o reach i t s MDG in 
th is sector. P r ima ry school comp le t ion rate imp roved 
f r o m 36.5% in 2000 to 53.9% in 2005 b u t remains l o w by 
in terna t iona l standards. En ro l lmen t in ear ly ch i ldhood 
development programs imp roved considerably, f r o m 
2.7% in 2000 to 6.8 percent in 2005. Schoo l cons truc t ion 
p rog ram was successful overa l l . 
A t the secondary and h igher education levels, few 
s ign i f ican t results were in evidence. The m a i n i s s u e has 
been s low and non-systematic imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
strategy. Progress has been uneven and masks 
u r b a d r u r a l and gender disparities. 
H ighe r educa t ion p ro jec t ra ted unsatisfactory due t o 
p o l i c y reversals a f ter n ew elections in 2000 and 2001.

The po r t fo l io ’s compos i t ion rema ined re la t ive ly stable ove r the 2003 C A S pe r iod . Based

con t inued t o dom ina te the p o r t f o l i o by an average o f 57 percent, 
f o l l ow e d by human 
development at 23 percent, and ag r icu l tu re and r u r a l development and p r iva te sector 
development b o t h at 9 percent. The percentage o f comm i tmen ts in the Human Deve lopmen t 
sector dec l ined from r o u g h l y 28 percent in FY 0 3 t o 19 percent in F Y 0 6 m a i n l y due t o the c los ing 
o f 3 hea l th projects. H e a l t h in te rven t ions are n o w f inanced th rough the PRSC p rog ram . 

19. 
The average age o f the p o r t f o l i o ove r the pe r iod FY03 -FY06 was 6.6 years. At the end o f 
M a y 2006, this average dec l ined t o 2.9 years, though th is masks the high average o f 4.9 and 4.6 
years f o r in f ras t ruc tu re and hea l th respectively. This was in ma rked contrast t o 0.6 years f o r 
r u r a l development programs, re f lec t ing the boa rd app rova l o f three n ew p ro jec ts expected t o be 
e f fec t ive in FY07 . There we re two m a i n reasons beh ind the r e l a t i v e l y l o n g imp lemen ta t ion 
pe r iod . First, the average number o f mon ths f o r projects t o become e f fec t ive was 7.7 due t o 
considerable delays in mee t ing effectiveness conditions. Second, 10 p ro jec ts we re restructured 
o r extended at least once during the p e r i o d FY03 -06 .

20. 
One characteristic o f the p o r t f o l i o was the la rge share o f Adap tab le P rog ram Lending 
(APL) operations. 
In FY06 , they represented about 45 percent o f the po r t fo l io , up f r om 3 0 
percent in F Y 0 3 . The data inc lude t w o n ew operations in the ag r icu l tu ra l sec to r that we re

PRSC also disbursed in FY05 , s ign i f ican t ly inc reas ing average disbursement amounts. The 
sectors with the largest average disbursements were in f ras t ruc tu re and energy, due t o the la rge

unsa t is fac to ry at the end o f M a y 2006, compared with 4 projects in F Y 0 4 . D isbu rsemen t rates

dec l ined t o US$65 m i l l i o n f r o m a high o f US $ 2 1 0 in F Y 0 3 . 

23. 
These imp rovemen ts we re la rge ly due t o the ac t ive invo lvemen t o f the C M U w h i c h

24. 
By M a y 2006, 14 p ro jec ts were closed and h a d ICR s prepared. O f these projects, 11 
we re ra ted High o r Substantial f o r Ins t i tu t iona l Development, representing, app rox ima te ly 80 
percent o f p o r t f o l i o comm i tmen ts . There was considerable evidence o f strengthened capacity in 
the water, te lecommun ica t ion and r o a d sector, while s lowe r progress in hea l th and education. 
On the i s s u e o f governance, IEG cites a range o f stagnating o r d e c l i n i n g measures related t o 
“government effectiveness, regu la to ry qua l i ty , and r u l e o f l aw ” a l l o f w h i c h have been the source 
o f B a n k support p r o v i d e d th rough the ongo ing PRSC program. 

25. 
The three p ro jec ts evaluated as unsatisfactory by IEG (Endemic disease, Higher 
Education, and In teg ra ted Hea l th ) were also deemed t o be u n l i k e l y t o be sustainable with 
neg l ig ib le ins t i tu t iona l development impac t . The keys reasons f o r u n l i k e l y sus ta inab i l i ty were: 
(i) inadequate government ownership; (ii)) lack o f a results focus w h i c h con t r ibu ted t o p o o r 
cho ice o f ind ica to rs tha t h a d incomp le te baselines; (iii) p r o l i f e r a t i o n o f ins t i tu t ions with 
c o n f l i c t i n g interests and f inanc ia l shortcomings hindering imp lemen ta t ion o f projects; and (iv) 
too l i t t l e a t ten t ion t o imp lemen ta t ion support and supe rv is ion compared with p ro jec t preparation. 

26. 
A k e y i s s u e in Senegal relates t o the s ign i f ican t numbe r o f PIUs designed t o manage 
B a n k projects. The Bank’s A f r i c a R e g i o n strategy has encouraged the eliminatiodconsolidation 
o f PIUs arguing they reduce the Government’s o w n capac i ty t o manage projects and are n o t 
l i k e l y t o be sustainable. A closer l o o k at PIUs in Senegal has revea led that the i r type , size, 
func t ion and effectiveness va ry widely. W h i l e some a re c lea r ly candidates f o r e l im ina t ion , some 
l i k e the N u t r i t i o n p rog ram PIU, w h i c h a rguab ly i s the consummate mu l t i -sec to r program, operate 
as highly e f fec t ive coo rd ina t ing unit w h i c h has de l ive red outstanding results. A study o f P ro jec t 
Imp lemen ta t ion Units i s unde rway t o determine whether the p r o l i f e r a t i o n o f investment p ro jec ts 
in Senegal has unde rm ined the capacity o f Government’s agencies t o imp lemen t projects. 
Ev idence t o date indicates that the nature o f PIUs in Senegal i s d i f fe ren t f r o m that o f other 
countries in A f r ica , as the re la t ive ly sma l l numbe r o f peop le emp loyed and the services i t 
p rov ides are spec i f ic and focused. A p ragma t ic and case by case approach shou ld b e taken in 
Senegal. 

27. Mixed instruments. T h e bulk o f projects de l ive red ove r the 2003 C A S p e r i o d we re 
investment projects. Budge t support in the amount o f $30 m i l l i o n in the past two f isca l years

men t ioned earlier (see para. 20), another feature o f the Bank’s p o r t f o l i o has been the high share 
o f the Adaptable P ro jec t L e n d i n g (APLs), w h i c h increased f r o m 30 percent in F Y 0 3 t o 45

p u b l i c l y disagreed w i th the pos i t ion o f the Government, there i s less r o o m f o r m is - in te rp re ta t ion . 

27. Greater emphasis on governance. The authorities recognize the impo r tance o f 
governance and have designed a fou r th p i l la r devo ted t o governance and t o the need t o p romo te 
further decen t ra l iza t ion and pa r t ic ipa to ry mechanisms in the second PRSP. I t i s proposed that 
the B a n k g i v e special attention t o governance in i t s n ew CAS , n o t o n l y th rough spec i f ic 
operations, but also th rough “a governance lens” that w i l l help f i l t e r and m o n i t o r progress ove r 

time. 

28. Greater emphasis on rural development. T h e B a n k shou ld support the Gove rnmen t in 
ba lanc ing the p r o v i s i o n o f in f ras t ruc tu re and soc ia l services across reg ions and across groups 
(women, children, and disabled) and in i t s e f fo r t t o decentralize economic ac t iv i t ies outside o f 
the Daka r area and through the development o f reg iona l poles (e.g., Casamance, Senegal River 
area). 

2 9 . 

Sharpen results orientation. The n ew C A S shou ld identify clear measurable outcomes 
that determine success and are mon i to rab le annually. This o r ien ta t ion shou ld b e re f lec ted at b o t h 
the C A S and p ro jec t /p rog ram levels. Many p ro jec ts do n o t have k e y pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs tha t 
are appropriate o r can b e measured. 
IDA 14 requires baseline data t o be available f o r key 
pe r fo rmance ind ica to rs by the 1’‘ Status report. N o t a l l performance ind ica to rs need t o r e l y o n 
expensive househo ld su rveys and simple mon i to rab le ind ica to rs can b e prepared that g i v e annual 
progress. F ina l ly , as imp lemen ta t ion issues con t inue t o be at the heart o f the po r t fo l io , increased 
emphasis shou ld b e p laced o n suppo r t ing the Gove rnmen t in manag ing f o r results, n o t j u s t 
measu r ing i t . 

30. 
Design and choices of lending instruments. Effectiveness o f the Bank ’s support i s 
p a r t i a l l y de te rm ined by the use o f appropriate l e n d i n g instruments. T h e g radua l shift t ow a r d 
budget support and c omm u n i t y driven in i t ia t ives shou ld h e l p increased owne rsh ip at the d i f fe ren t 
leve ls o f the Governments but i t shou ld be accompanied by imp rovemen ts in f inanc ia l 
management and p rocu remen t procedures. F r o m the r e v i ew o f the recent operations, i t i s also 
recommended that p ro jec t d e s i g n be s im p l i f i e d because they tend t o r e l y o n o v e r l y comp lex 
cond i t iona l i t ies that have resulted in l o n g delays f o r effectiveness and con t r ibu ted t o s l ow 

76 

imp lemen ta t ion (as evidenced by the high number o f projects that h a d t o b e restructured o r 
extended). The number o f effectiveness cond i t ions shou ld n o t o n l y be reduced but ac tua l ly b e in 
p lace by B o a r d date. 

3 1. 
Donor Harmonization. Seeking synergies w i th development partners w i l l help increase 
the Bank ’s leverage and simplify procedures f o r the Government. T h e s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t 
in the re la t ionsh ip with the donor c omm u n i t y i s already bea r ing h i t , compared w i th f r o m the 
tensions in the earlier pa r t o f the C A S pe r iod . This i s evidenced by the increased co - f inanc ing o f 
B a n k projects. Senegal i s one o f the p i l o t countries f o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Paris 
Dec la ra t ion and a numbe r o f in i t ia t ives t o push the agenda f o rw a r d have started bearing fruit. 
T h e B a n k i s generally pe rce ived as an “honest broker.” M a n y donors are m o r e w i l l ing t o engage 
in a sector when the Bank i s invo lved , this i s especially t rue in transport. W h e n Government 
owne rsh ip exists, the B a n k can p l a y a p i v o t a l r o l e in m o b i l i z i n g resources and p r o v i d i n g support 
in areas few others can. The use o f alternative f inanc ia l instruments such as MIGA, I F C and 
Bank ’s guarantees shou ld be pursued, especially f o r in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts given the limited IDA 
a l loca t ion . 

32. 
Communications. The B a n k has made m a j o r s t r ides in imp lemen t ing a commun ica t ions 
and outreach strategy that i s beginning t o bear fruit. The C A S consultations with the 
Government, c i v i l society, the p r iva te sector and donors were w e l l rece ived and appreciated. 
T h e mos t successful projects have been those w i th clear owne rsh ip by the authorities o f the 
re fo rms and outcomes, exemp l i f ied by the water and n u t r i t i o n sectors. In b o t h cases, leadership 
was p r o v i d e d at the highest p o l i t i c a l leve l . This l e v e l o f coo rd ina t ion shou ld ex is t n o t o n l y 
during p repa ra t ion but during execu t ion and evaluation. This i s pa r t icu la r ly t rue f o r sectors 
where the i s s u e s are complex, such as in f ras t ruc tu re and decentralization.

IFC Strategy During FY07-FY10

Development constraints: Senegal has achieved 5-6 percent r e a l GDP g r ow t h in the 
past f ew years and i s a im i n g at higher rates acco rd ing t o the Accelerated G r o w t h Strategy o f the 
Government. Howeve r , g r ow t h i s m o s t l y achieved in the cons t ruc t ion and p rope r ty sectors, 
f inanced by remittances f r o m Senegalese abroad. Mo reove r , g r ow t h s lowed t o around 3 percent 
in 2006 due t o o i l p r ices but also due t o un favo rab le domestic circumstances. Desp i te some 
progress in adop t ing new measures and simplifjmg procedures by the P res iden t ia l Inves to r 
Counc i l , the business c l ima te remains cha l leng ing and i s an imped imen t t o a t t rac t ing f o r e i g n as 
well as domestic investment. 

7. 
The b a n k i n g sector remains the m a i n source o f f inanc ing f o r the economy but i s m o s t l y 
focused o n the larger enterprises. The m ic ro f inance ins t i tu t ions are n o t able t o meet the needs o f 
their c l ien ts as they develop t o become micro-enterprises. As a result, the SMEs r em a i n 
underserved, pa r t icu la r ly f o r f inanc ing the i r g row th . Furthermore, even f o r the larger enterprises, 
m e d i um - and long - te rm financing f o r their development i s d i f f i c u l t t o find as banks are res t r ic ted 
in t rans fo rm ing their short-term funding t o finance longe r te rm loans. 

8. 
In the past year, the c red i t qua l i ty o f the banks’ p o r t f o l i o s has deteriorated as a numbe r o f 
larger companies face f inanc ia l d i f f i c u l t y . This has further reduced the banks ’ appetite f o r risk 
and the i r willingness to finance SMEs . 

9 . 
At the same time, during years o f s t ruc tu ra l adjustment f ew investments have been made 
in in f ras t ruc tu re projects. A s a resu l t , the coun t ry i s in need o f m a j o r investments t o develop 
roads, energy, means o f transportation and bas ic urban and r u r a l infrastructure. Daka r remains 
congested and needs u rban p lann ing . 

10. 
T h e Accelerated G r o w t h Strategy c o u l d address some o f theses issues. The Gove rnmen t 
enjoys s ign i f ican t f isca l space as a resu l t o f recent debt forgiveness and p o t e n t i a l l y s ign i f ican t 
funding th rough donors. In this context, IFC in tends t o imp lemen t a strategy that w i l l address 
the needs o f the coun t ry and supports the ob jec t ives o f the Government. 

11. 
IFC Objectives. During FY2007 -2010 , IFC ’ s strategy f o r Senegal, b o t h in t e r m s o f 
investments and techn ica l assistance, i s focused on: (i) im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t c l ima te ; (ii)

them; and (iii) p roac t ive support t o p ro jec t development in the p r i o r i t y sectors (tourism,

the p u b l i c sector w o u l d p r o v i d e the required suppo r t /m i t iga t ion th rough guarantees (as i t i s the

however, w o u l d r em a i n under Senelec’s owne rsh ip and control, and be f inanced by Senelec with 
the support o f the dono r commun i ty .

The risk of debt distress in Senegal i s low during the period 2006-26, given the 
low current leve l of debt, and assuming the fiscal deficit remains below 4 percent of 
GDP on the average, r e a l interest rates remain below r e a l GDP growth rate and the 
inflow of concessional funds i s sustained at historical levels.38 U n d e r the baseline scenario, 
w h i c h assumes f isca l d e f i c i t and i n f l o w o f concessional funds a l igned with h is to r ica l trends,

Background 

2 . Senegal’s debt sustainability indicators improved substantially after the enhanced 
H IPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Senegal reached i t s 
H I P C f loa t ing comp le t ion p o i n t in April 2004, when i t rece ived debt r e l i e f o f about US$4SS 
m i l l i o n in NPV terms (about U S $ S 5 0 m i l l i o n in n om i n a l terms).39 Debt r e l i e f under the H I P C 
has been granted by K u w a i t and a l l Paris C l u b creditors except Sweden. Ch ina has 
comm i t ted t o cancel a l l Senegal’s debt. In 2005, Senegal q u a l i f i e d f o r further debt 
cance l la t ion under the MDRI when the IMF, the In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t Assoc ia t ion 
(IDA), and the A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t Fund (AfDF) cancelled their c la ims o n Senegal 
amoun t ing t o about US$1 .4 b i l l i o n in n om i n a l t e r m s (19 percent o f 2006 GD P in NPV 
terms) .40 As a resu l t o f these two in i t ia t ives , the NPV o f ex te rna l P PG debt outstanding i s 
estimated t o have amounted t o 13 percent o f GDP at end-2006. P u b l i c domestic debt i s 
estimated at about 3 percent o f GDP, o f w h i c h two - th i rds i s l o n g - t e r n . 

3. 
The exposure of the private sector also appears limited. T h e In te rna t iona l 
Inves tmen t Pos i t ion comp i led by the B C E A O f o r end-2004 indicates that the stock o f p r iva te 
external debt (net o f p r iva te external assets) i s o n l y 9 percent o f GDP . T h e net p r iva te 
external debt inc ludes trade c red i t (2 percent o f GDP), cu r rency and deposits ow e d by 

38 

40 

The risk o f debt distress i s considered low i f a l l debt indicators are well below relevant country-specific debt- 
burden thresholds and s t ress testing does not result in indicators significantly breaching thresholds. 
3 9 See Senegal: Enhanced I n i t i a t i v e fo r H IPC -Comp le t ion P o i n t Documen t (Country Report 04/130) 
MDRI debt r e l i e f from the IMF became effective in January 5,2006, providing stock r e l i e f on debt disbursed 
before end-2004 and s t i l l outstanding at end-2005. IDA and the AfDF started providing debt r e l i e f in July 2006.

a baseline scenario a n d a series o f stress tests.41 The stress t e s t s a re designed t o assess a 
coun t ry ’s p r o b a b i l i t y o f fac ing debt distress in the future.42 The analysis i s guided by 
ind ica t ive , coun t ry -spec i f ic external P PG debt-burden thresholds, w h i c h t a k e i n t o account the 
emp i r ica l finding that the external debt levels that a low - income coun t ry can sustain increase 
with the q u a l i t y o f i t s po l ic ies and ins t i tu t ions . The q u a l i t y o f po l ic ies and ins t i tu t ions i s 
measured by the W o r l d Bank ’s 2005 Coun t ry P o l i c y and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment (CPIA),

External Sustainability Analysis 

6. Under the baseline scenario, Senegal’s external PPG debt-burden indicators 
remain below the thresholds throughout the projection period. The NPV o f external PPG 
deb t - to -GDP ra t io w i l l r ise slightly f r o m 13 percent in 2006 t o 15 percent by 2026 unde r this 
scenario, below the po l icy -dependen t th resho ld o f 50 percent f o r a s t rong pe r fo rme r such as 
Senegal. S im i la r ly , the NPV o f ex te rna l PPG debt-to-exports r a t i o and the ex te rna l PPG debt 
service-to-exports r a t i o are p ro jec ted t o rema in unde r 56 and 6 percent, respectively, during 
the w h o l e p ro jec t ion period, b e l ow their respective po l icy -dependen t thresholds (F igu re 1

The debt indicators are sensitive to borrowing terms. I f a l l new external b o r r ow i n g 
(3.5 percent o f GDP annua l ly o n average) i s concessional with an average grant element o f 
45.3 percent, the NPV o f external PPG deb t - to -GDP r a t i o w i l l r i s e by o n l y 2 percentage 
po in ts in the p r o j e c t i o n period. Howeve r , i t w i l l g r ow by 21 percentage p o i n t s and reach 34 
percent in 2026 i f a l l new external b o r r ow i n g i s non-concessional (Figure 1 and Tab le 2). In 
this case, the debt ind ica to rs rema in b e l ow the th resho ld during the p r o j e c t i o n pe r iod but 
con t inue t o g r ow and even tua l ly b reach the thresholds after the end o f the p ro jec t ion pe r iod . 
I f f inanc ing under the worst-case shock i s non-concessional, the NPV o f ex te rna l PPG debt- 
to -GDP r a t i o in 2008 w i l l be 10 percentage po in ts h ighe r than i f i t i s concessional (Figure 1). 
These results unde r l ine the need f o r the government t o adhere s t r ic t ly t o the p o l i c y o f

Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

Under the baseline scenario, the public debt indicators mirror the external debt 
indicators. The NPV o f to ta l P PG deb t - to -GDP ra t io and the NPV o f t o t a l P PG debt-to- 
exports r a t i o w i l l r em a i n l o w during the en t i re p r o j e c t i o n period, even though the domestic 
p o r t i o n o f the t o t a l p u b l i c debt i s non-concessional. The medium and long - te rm debt service- 
to-revenues ra t io w i l l s im i l a r l y r em a i n l o w under the baseline scenario (Box 1, F igu re 2, 
Tables 3 and 4).

10. 
The government may face ro l love r difficulties over the next 5 to 10 years owing 
to the growing share of short-term domestic debt (Figure 3). I f the current p o l i c y o f 
issuing short-term securities t o close the f inanc ing gap continues in the med ium - te rm , the 
to ta l PPG debt service-to-revenue ra t io ( inc lud ing short-term debt service) w i l l doub le t o 3 0 
percent by 2011 be fo re s tab i l iz ing at a high level, around 42 percent, ove r the rest o f the 
period.47 These p ro jec t ions underline the need f o r Senegal t o extend the ma tu r i t ies o f p u b l i c 
debt securities and to develop a liquid primary and secondary market f o r government debt. 

11. 
Fiscal debt sustainability hinges on the reduction o f the fiscal deficit to below 4 
percent o f GDP on the average. I f the f isca l d e f i c i t remains at i t s 2006 l e v e l o f 5.7 percent 
o f G D P (equivalent t o a primary d e f i c i t o f 5.0 percent o f GDP) during the en t i re p r o j e c t i o n 
period, the NPV o f to ta l PPG debt-to-GDP r a t i o w i l l reach 50 percent in 2021. The f inanc ing 
needs caused by the accumulated de f ic i ts c o u l d c r ow d ou t the p r iva te sector. The NPV o f 
to ta l debt-to-revenue r a t i o and debt service-to-revenue ra t io ( inc lud ing short-term debt 
service) w i l l f o l l ow s im i la r trajectories, reach ing 268 and 197 percent by 2026, respectively. 
This prospect highlights once again the need f o r the authorities t o pursue a p ruden t f isca l 
p o l i c y ove r the med ium - te rm (F igu re 2 and Tables 3 and 4). 

12. 
Temporary adverse shocks will require additional fiscal adjustment to reduce 
domestic borrowing needs and stabilize public debt. The mos t extreme shock f o r f isca l 
D S A , w h i c h invo lves GD P g r ow t h rate f a l l i n g t o 2.3 percent a year in 2007 and 2008 
(equivalent t o one standard dev ia t ion b e l ow i t s h is to r ica l average), w o u l d raise the NPV o f 
t o t a l P PG debt-to-GDP ra t io t o 50 percent by the end o f the p ro jec t ion pe r iod . The NPV o f 
to ta l PPG debt-to-revenues ra t io w o u l d f o l l o w a similar t ra jec to ry and reach 200 percent in 
2022. T h e rea l iza t ion o f a sizeable contingent l i a b i l i t y equivalent t o 10 percent o f GDP in 
2007 i s less severe than the worst-case scenario. T o insure that debt ind ica to rs r em a i n within 
reasonable limits in case o f a shock, the f isca l d e f i c i t shou ld b e reduced b e l ow the l e v e l 
assumed under the baseline scenario (Box 2, F i g u r e 2 and Tab le 4). 

Conclusion 

13. 
The risk o f debt distress remains low. Debt ind ica to rs r ise steeply during the 
p r o j e c t i o n p e r i o d o n l y i f the ove ra l l f isca l d e f i c i t remains at i t s 2006 l e v e l o f 5.7 percent o f 
GDP, o r the average m a t u r i t y o f new domestic debt remains at one year o r less . B e y o n d 
2026, the debt distress m a y arise o n l y i f GD P does n o t g r ow as projected, o r a l l b o r r ow i n g i s 
o n non-concessional terms. In these cases, add i t iona l f isca l adjustment w i l l be needed t o 
ensure that the r i s k o f debt distress stays l o w . This D S A highlights the need f o r Senegal t o 
con t inue t o adopt s t r ic t f isca l discipline, a prudent strategy rega rd ing b o r r ow i n g o n non - 
concessional terms, and appropriate debt management po l ic ies .

2 7 . 
T h e C A S consu l ta t ion process was designed with the ob jec t ive o f l is ten ing and 
ga in ing a better understanding o f the concerns and mo t iva t ions o f stakeholders as well as 
t o get feedback o n the effectiveness o f B a n k G roup assistance. This annex describes the 
m a i n elements o f the process adopted by the Bank ’s coun t ry team t o reach ou t t o the 
Government, the p r iva te sector, c i v i l society and the donors ope ra t ing in Senegal. 
Step 1: January-March 2006 -- the path to the CAS Concept note 
28 . 
The consu l ta t ion process started within the WBG with the o rgan iza t ion o f a 
b ra ins to rm ing session at the end January 2006. This session bene f i ted f r o m a la rge 
representation f r om staffs in Wash ing ton and in the f i e l d as w e l l as f r o m the WBG at 
la rge (WBI, MIGA, and IFC ) . 
I t resulted in a preliminary agreement o n the key 
challenges faced by the WBG in i t s assistance t o Senegal and the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n o f the 
C A S core team, with representatives f r o m the Bank ’s A f r i c a R e g i o n and techn ica l units, 
IFC , MIGA, and WBI. This agreement was transferred t o the C A S ou t l ine tha t was 
subsequently shared with the C A S core team, lead ing t o the f ina l iza t ion o f the concept 
no te that was presented and endorsed by the Coun t ry Team o n M a r c h 2 1 , 2006 . 

29 . 
In pa ra l le l t o the consu l ta t ion process within the WBG, p r e l im i n a r y consultations 
with Government o f f i c i a l s started in Feb rua ry 2006 , no tab ly with the unit in charge o f 
des ign ing and m o n i t o r i n g the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP ove r t ime . K e y challenges 
pe rce ived by the B a n k we re shared by a group o f stakeholders ( rang ing f r o m Gove rnmen t 
o f f ic ia ls , NGOs representatives, donors, and researchers) in a wo rkshop o n p o v e r t y 
o rgan ized j o i n t l y by the Government and the Bank in Daka r o n February 2 7 , 2006. 
D i a l o g u e with other donors began within the con tex t o f the donors’ w o r k i n g group 
o rgan ized around the PRSP, co-chaired by the B a n k and UNDP. T h e p r im a r y purpose o f 
the above consultations was t o l i s t e n and increase common understanding o f coun t ry 
cond i t ions and concerns, and the r o l e and interests o f diverse stakeholders. These 
consultations he lped define the basic structure o f the CAS . 

Step 2: April-May 2006: From the Concept Note to the ROC Document 

30. 
The consu l ta t ion process was in tens i f ied within the WBG with the goa l t o prepare 
the outcome-based m a t r i x presented in Annex 1. The process was sequential. T h e f i r s t 
stage was t o share the proposed results-based me thodo logy with the en t i re C A S team 
th rough a series o f video-conferences with the Dakar o f f ice , l e d by R o n n i e H amm a d 
( A F TQ K ) and moderated by Susan Otis (HRSCE). The C A S TTL and a selected few 
team members also pa r t ic ipa ted in the C A S Academy t ra in ing p rog ram o rgan ized by 
OPCS. The second stage consisted o f four sessions devoted to d r a f t i n g the outcome- 
based m a t r i x around the Governance f i l t e r and the three p i l la rs o n w h i c h the p roposed 
C A S i s built. The third and f i n a l stage helped f ina l ize the d ra f t m a t r i x th rough an 
i te ra t ive process i n v o l v i n g the TTL and the core members o f the C A S team.

I n f o rm a l consultations con t inued in Daka r . A series o f meetings was o rgan ized 
by the Daka r o f f i c e t o exchange i n f o rm a t i o n and op in ions be tween the C A S team and 

104 

representatives f rom : (i) the media; (ii) c i v i l society; and (iii) the p r iva te sector. F o l l ow - 
up meetings were o rgan ized w i th Government representatives, i n c l u d i n g the M i n i s t e r o f 
E c o n om y and Finance, t o share the W o r l d Bank ’s v i s i o n and agree o n a tentative 
t ime tab le f o r in -coun t ry consultations. On June 20, a one-day wo rkshop was o rgan ized 
in Daka r during w h i c h the C A S team shared i t s v iews and discussed the b road l ines o f the 
proposed C A S fo r the p e r i o d FY07-10. This wo rkshop inc luded representatives f r o m the 
fou r w o r k i n g groups suppo r t ing the imp lemen ta t ion o f the second-generation PRSP in 
Senegal, inc lud ing : (i) cen t ra l Government; (ii) l o c a l Governments; (iii) c i v i l society and 
the p r iva te sector; and (iv) donors. 

Step 3: July 2006-March 2007 

32. 
A m o r e f o rm a l consu l ta t ion process was .iunchel 
in the country, f o l l ow e d 
clearance f r o m the R O C meeting. 
I t was p r i n c i p a l l y managed by the C o u n t r y O f f i c e 
(under the respons ib i l i ty o f the I n f o rm a t i o n Coo rd ina to r ) in close co l labo ra t ion with the 
TTL, and w i th the support o f HRSCE . I t i s w o r t h unde r sco r ing that the consultations 
were fully integrated in the pa r t ic ipa to ry process su r round ing the f ina l iza t ion o f the PRSP 
by the Government. N o t o n l y were key stakeholders iden t ica l in b o t h processes, but the 
B a n k was also co -cha i r ing the group o f donors i n v o l v e d in the PRSP. This oppo r tun i ty 
a l lows us t o a l i g n pe r fec t ly the C A S with the PRSP p r io r i t ies . 

33. 
The C A S consultations also bene f i ted f r o m the G A C consultations (December 
2006-January 2007), w h i c h we re an add i t iona l oppo r tun i ty t o go m o r e deep ly in some 
comp lex issues o n governance and co r rup t ion . Participants in a l l sessions we lcome the 
consu l ta t ion as an oppo r tun i ty t o raise and t o discuss o n na t iona l issues, i n c l u d i n g (i) the 
r o l e o f c i v i l society; (ii) greater transparency and e f f ic iency in the use o f p u b l i c

deve lopmen thha red g row th ; (vi) p u b l i c sector accoun tab i l i ty ; (vii) j u d i c i a l system; and 
(viii) mechanisms f o r p r iva te sector governance 

34. 
Las t but n o t least, the consu l ta t ion process inc luded the presentation o f the second 
PRSP t o the Bank ’s B o a r d o f D i r e c t o r o n January 30, 2007, w h i c h has a l lowed the

35. 
Aligning the WBG support w i th the PRSP objectives as well as ha rmon iz ing i t 
with the assistance p r o v i d e d by other partners i s at the hearth o f the C A S agenda ove r the 
p e r i o d FY 0 7 -FY 1 0 . This goa l i s shared by the Senegalese authorities, w h o made clear 
the i r willingness t o increase a i d effectiveness in accordance with the i r comm i tmen t t o the 
Paris Dec la ra t ion . In particular, the dec is ion t o establish an ac t ion p l a n o n harmonization, 
a l ignmen t and a i d effectiveness i s e x p l i c i t l y men t ioned in the PRSP-11. The MEF has set 
up an in te rna l w o r k i n g group, cha i red by the CSPLP, and tasked with the p repa ra t ion o f 
this ac t ion p lan . 

B. 

Recent Developments 

36. 
Remarkable progress has been achieved by the government and its 
development partners in recent years. Dono rs s t rong ly im p r o v e d their coo rd ina t ion in 
the education sector, w i th better a l ignmen t o f p ro jec t cycles and the p repa ra t ion o f a 
procedure manual. The c om p l e x i t y o f the sector and bottlenecks in imp lemen ta t ion 
capac i ty within the Gove rnmen t led t o the dec is ion that d i f fe ren t types o f a i d instruments 
were s t i l l needed at this p o i n t in t ime . Some partners (France, Netherlands, EU and 
Canada) are w o r k i n g o n the imp lemen ta t ion o f a sector budget support, and some decided 
t o j o i n t l y finance capac i ty building ac t iv i t ies (W o r l d B a n k and France). This increased 
ha rmon iza t ion builds o n Gove rnmen t achievements, pa r t icu la r ly a sectoral MTEF, a 
Gove rnmen t l e d p o l i c y framework, a unit within the Ministry o f Educa t ion designated as 
a foca l p o i n t f o r donor-Government relations, and a common m a t r i x o f objectives. 

37. 
S im i la r ly , donors active in p u b l i c f inanc ia l management r e f o rm j o i n t l y support a 
Gove rnmen t l e d p rog ram . The W o r l d B a n k se t up a t r u s t fund t o ha rmon ize the f inanc ing 
o f this p rog ram . A M O U w i l l soon fo rma l ize the s t rong ex is t ing coo rd ina t ion be tween 
the donors p r o v i d i n g general budget support, i n c l u d i n g the Bank th rough i t s PRSC series. 
In decen t ra l iza t ion and l o c a l development, the government designed w i th support f r o m 
the W o r l d B a n k a na t iona l p rog ram (Programme N a t i o n a l de Deve loppemen t L o c a l - 
P N D L ) w h i c h i s designed to serve as a condu i t though w h i c h a l l l o c a l development 
ac t iv i t ies w i l l be channeled. The recen t ly app roved IDA Pa r t ic ipa to ry Deve lopmen t 
P ro jec t w i l l support the P N D L , and a l l donors agree t o pa r t ic ipa te in the PND L as soon as 
the ex is t ing p ro jec ts are closing, thus p rog ress ive ly ope ra t iona l iz ing a Sec to r -W ide 
approach. In the wa te r sector, a l l donors have agreed t o use the in teg ra ted p ro jec t 
coo rd ina t ion unit set up within the Ministry o f Wa te r Resources. In mos t sectors, donors 
coordinate th rough sector w o r k i n g groups and have agreed t o designate a lead dono r f o r 
discussion with the Government. 

38. 
These achievements a r e encouraging but a re still too limited. D o n o r - 
Gove rnmen t re la t ions need t o be substantially imp roved , with actions t o b e taken b o t h by 
the donors and by the Government.

39. 
A su rvey o f the mos t impo r tan t partners undertaken by the W o r l d Bank in the f i r s t 
quarter o f 2006 con f i rms that many donors are very active in Senegal, with a to ta l 
p o r t f o l i o estimated at around US$2.3 b i l l i o n s at the end o f 2005, i n c l u d i n g almost 500

T h e W o r l d Bank survey also

The respons ib i l i t ies within the MEF f o r a i d p rog ram m o n i t o r i n g are unclear and spread

The Monitoring survey o f the Paris Declaration points to very similar 
conclusions. There are strong discrepancies be tween a i d l e v e l s disbursed by donors and 
the amounts they repo r t t o the government, as w e l l as be tween p rev is ions and e f fec t ive 
disbursements. In add i t ion , the survey shows that donors m a i n t a i n a la rge numbe r o f 
pa ra l le l P IUs (60) and coordinate a very sma l l f rac t ion o f the i r m iss ions ( o n l y 22% o f the 
307 annual m iss ions are jo in t ) , and that m a j o r donors s t i l l have a l o n g w a y t o go t o 
undertake j o i n t l y the i r ana ly t ica l wo rk .

43. 

Besides, many bottlenecks within the Senegalese administration a re slowing 
the move towards program and budget support. A j o i n t diagnostic o f these s t ruc tu ra l 
obstacles shou ld b e q u i c k l y undertaken. T h e f o l l o w i n g elements, some o f w h i c h appear 
in the PRSP-11, are likely to come ou t f r o m such a study. Adm in is t ra t ive capacities are 
s t i l l limited, and m a n y donors rely o n pa ra l le l o r independent p ro jec t un i ts t o implement 
their projects, w h i c h fu r the r weaken m in is t r ies ’ capacities. T h e Gove rnmen t has n o t yet 
fo rmu la ted a na t iona l capacity building strategy, w h i c h w o u l d b e re f lec ted in the sectoral 
policies, and o n w h i c h donors w o u l d a l i g n and ha rmon ize their support. Severe 
l im i t a t i o n s in the rec ru i t ing and remune ra t ion po l ic ies o f the Senegalese Gove rnmen t 
prevent the adm in is t ra t ion to de l ive r core basic services, especially outside o f Daka r . 

C . 

Recommendations 

44. 
The harmonization action plan announced in the PRSP-I1 should aim at 
overcoming these difficulties. Consistent with the m u t u a l accoun tab i l i ty p romo ted by 
the Paris Declaration, the l o g i c shou ld n o t be t o l i s t a se t o f cond i t ions (on the charge o f 
the Gove rnmen t o r o f the partners), but t o start a v i r tuous c i rc le where donors and the 
Gove rnmen t w o u l d j o i n t l y build the foundations f o r a m o r e e f f ic ien t aid. M a n y 
countries, i n c l u d i n g in A f r ica , already have such ac t ion p lans (Ghana, Ethiopia), o r have 
started a process t o establish one (Ma l i , Rwanda, Tanzania--where the a i d effectiveness 
agenda encompasses a ve ry r i c h and diverse set o f activities) 

45. 
Such an action plan could be based on the list of indicators o f the Paris 
Declaration, and establish c lear methodologies, stages and targets. I t shou ld f o r m a 
coherent se t o f actions, each pa r t building o n the achievements in the other parts, and 
w i th respons ib i l i t ies shared between the Gove rnmen t and donors. I t s m a i n axes c o u l d be: 

Im p r o v i n g the q u a l i t y o f Government-partners dialogue. 
Im p r o v i n g a i d management and m o n i t o r i n g by the Gove rnmen t (bo th MEF 
and sector ministries). 
Im p r o v i n g a l ignmen t o f a i d o n PRSP p r io r i t ies . 
H a rm o n i z i n g capacity building ac t iv i t ies around a strategy defined by the 
Government. 
Reduc ing a i d dispersion. 
Pu rsu ing p u b l i c f inanc ia l management reform, and m o r e b r o a d l y im p r o v i n g 
governance. 
H a rm o n i z i n g dono r procedures, inc reas ing p rog ram and budget support.

The drafting o f this action plan should build on the monitoring exerc ise o f 
the Paris Declaration. The nume r ica l targets in the ac t ion plan w o u l d be de te rm ined o n 
the basis o f the 2005 baseline as i t results f r o m the Pa r is Dec la ra t ion m o n i t o r i n g 
questionnaire. T h e government c o u l d w o r k t o inc lude in th is exercise some impo r tan t 
donors w h o did n o t t a k e pa r t in the Paris Dec la ra t ion m o n i t o r i n g survey o r reply t o the 
W o r l d Bank questionnaire. Partners shou ld make available the necessary resources f o r 
the p repa ra t ion and imp lemen ta t ion o f this plan. T a k i n g example o f achievements o r 
ongo ing e f fo r ts in countries like Rwanda, Ghana o r M a l i , the Ministry o f F inance shou ld 

109 

designate a foca l p o i n t t o lead the wo rk , with ac t ive support f r o m donors, and a dedicated 
government-donor a i d effectiveness w o r k i n g group shou ld b e established. 

47. 
The W o r l d B a n k shou ld take an ac t ive r o l e in fac i l i ta t ing , and in some cases 
leading, the j o i n t e f fo r t t o se t up n ew p rog ram approaches f o r increased ha rmon iza t ion . 
In sectors l i k e ag r icu l tu re development, transport o r environment, o r in the support o f the 
Senegal River basin, donors and the government are ac t ive ly l a y i n g the b r i c k s f o r the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f sector-wide approaches, and in some cases have already agreed o n 
j o i n t supe rv is ion and j o i n t m o n i t o r i n g requirements. The Bank shou ld b e f l e x i b l e and 
adopt a p roac t ive approach t o p ro jec t res t ruc tu r ing t o support any new sector-wide 
approach and reduce the adm in is t ra t ive bu rden o n the Senegalese adm in is t ra t ion .
