EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

In recent years Panama’s economy has experienced spectacular economic growth. Panamanians’ 
decision t o expand the Panama Canal over the next 6-7 years and conclusion o f a f r e e trade 
agreement with the United States, are expected t o boost and extend economic expansion fo r 
some time. This presents an h is to r ic opportunity fo r Panama to make headway in reducing 
pe rs is ten t poverty and inequality. However, to broaden the base o f po ten t ia l beneficiaries, 
complementary po l ic ies that further increase private sector competitiveness and access t o 
education, s k i l l s , innova t ion and capital w i l l be needed. In addition, the challenges o f reaching 
Panama’s poorest go deeper. 90 pe rcen t o f Panamanians l i v i n g in indigenous areas were l i v i n g 
in extreme poverty in 2003, an increasing share. To reach isolated populations, the t rad i t iona l 
approach to social assistance, w h i c h relied heav i ly o n universal subsidies, requ i res re th ink ing 
and inefficiencies in pub l ic spending also require attention. 

The Strategic V i s i o n articulated by the To r r i jos administration (2004-2009) i s responding t o 
Panama’s development challenges. A fiscal re fo rm package and a pension reform, b o t h passed 
in 2005, fo rm part o f an ambitious development strategy which emphasizes fiscal discipline, 
transparency and greater e f f ic iency t o ensure a sound economic base, accelerate export-led 
economic growth, create more jobs and reduce poverty. T o lowe r pove r ty by one - f i f th du r ing i t s 
t e r m o f office, the To r r i jos administration has p r io r i t ized investments in human capital 
(including a b i g e f fo r t t o modernize education and training) and introduced a flagship targeted 
conditional cash t r a n s f e r p rog ram coupled with the continued expansion o f pre-school education, 
p r ima ry health care and n u t r i t i o n and basic infrastructure, especially in poo r and indigenous 
areas. 

The Bank was one o f Panama’s ma jo r development partners over m u c h o f the 1990s, a pe r iod in 
which the country made steady progress o n structural reforms t o open the economy, imp rove 
competition and modernize the state. However, the Bank’s engagement dropped o f f dramatically 
between 2000 and 2004 and m u c h o f the previous Country Assistance Strategy (FY99-01) was 
l e f t unimplemented. The partnership has been successfully rejuvenated th rough the program o f 
activities that were agreed in the Interim Strategy No te f o r the Republic o f Panama ( I S N FY 0 6 - 
07): po r t fo l io performance has rebounded, the project pipeline has been rebuilt and analytical 
w o r k has contributed to robust p o l i c y dialogue. 

This proposed Country Partnership Strategy (FY08 -FY 10) aims t o p rov ide se lec t ive , demand 
driven assistance that deepens the Panama-Bank partnership and he lps the Government achieve 
i t s poverty and inequality reduc t ion goals du r ing i t s remaining tw o years in office. The program 
i s also s e t up t o p rov ide the new administration (2009-2014) with access t o immediate support. 
The CPS supports fou r objectives which are aligned with the p i l la rs and goals o f Panama’s 2004- 
2009 Strategic V i s i o n (Table 1). 

The CPS has a strong r e s u l t s orientation. 
I t w i l l continue t o support Panama t o develop i t s 
national statistical systems and related t o that, i t identifies and w i l l track specific outcomes that 
the W o r l d Bank program i s designed t o support. The CPS also emphasizes b u i l d i n g capacity in 
partner ministries. This i s be ing done in coordination with the In te r -Ame r ican Development

Bank (IDB). The tw o banks are wo rk ing t o harmonize procedures with each other and with 
those o f the Government, as Government systems and procedures are strengthened with Bank 
and IDB support.

the I S N - g row th has accelerated, debt has fa l len as a share o f GDP, and f isca l balances have

the strategy takes in to account potential risks in th ree areas: economic, po l i t ica l and p o r t f o l i o 
performance. 

Proposed Issue for Board Discussion

Country Partnership Strategy an appropriate strategic response t o the Government o f 
Panama, considering i t s Strategic Development Vision, economic prospects, and the areas in 
w h i c h the Government has asked the Bank f o r support.

I. Country Context and Development Challenges 

1. 

In recent years Panama’s economy has experienced spectacular economic g row th 
averaging over 7.5 pe rcen t du r ing 2004-2006. These gains, combined with the country’s rosy 
economic g row th prospects p resen t an h is to r ic opportunity fo r Panama t o make headway in 
reducing p e r s i s t e n t poverty and inequality. The cu r ren t administration under President M a r t i n 
To r r i jos (2004-2009) i s wo rk ing ha rd t o do just that. In add i t ion t o pursuing policies aimed at 
broadening the base o f economic ac t iv i ty - inc lud ing opening trade markets, reducing regulatory 
impediments t o competition, fostering innova t ion and g i v i n g poo r ru ra l farmers the tools t o 
compete - the Government i s m o v i n g o n a number o f fronts t o increase the e f fec t iveness o f 
social assistance. I t has launched a cond i t iona l cash t rans fe r program, Red de Oportunidudes, 
targeting the country’s poorest t o break the generational pove r ty cycle. I t i s expanding pre- 
schools and basic health care t o be t te r prepare poo r ch i ld ren f o r p r ima ry school and i s w o r k i n g t o 
remove the barriers that prevent them f r om completing secondary school. The Government also 
i s mak ing progress in modernizing public f inanc ia l management systems and institutions, w h i c h 
have been a drag o n e f f ic ien t delivery o f pub l ic programs, infrastructure and services that are 
needed b o t h to help broaden the base o f economic ac t iv i ty and t o redistribute bene f i ts more 
effectively. And, among other initiatives, the President i s overseeing a $50 m i l l i o n a year fund, 
f r om Canal revenues that i s p rov id ing basic infrastructure t o communities - water, roads, and 
even schools - in accordance with their stated preferences. 

2. With a popu la t ion o f about 3.5 m i l l i o n , a w o r l d famous canal, a mode rn f inanc ia l c e n t e r 
and a per capita GDP that ranks i t as an upper-middle income nation, Panama i s a country o f 
stark contrasts. Perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities’ , over one-third o f Panama’s 
popu la t ion was l i v i n g in poverty in 2003 and 16 pe rcen t l i v i n g in extreme pove r ty -- evidence o f 
very h i g h inequality. Poverty p ressu res have also increasingly been threatening Panama’s 
environmental assets. Panama i s one o f the mos t b io log ica l ly diverse countries in the wo r ld . 
M o r e than 12 percent o f the country’s te r r i to ry fa l ls within the Na t iona l Protected A rea System. 
Yet pove r ty p ressu res have pushed the poor t o exp lo i t the Mesoamerican B io log ica l Corridor’s 
natural resources in unsustainable ways. The impac t o f r e c e n t g row th o n pove r ty l e v e l s and the 
success o f efforts t o help ensure that economic bene f i ts are more b road ly shared w i l l be 
measured comprehensively in a 2008 l i v i n g standard measurement household s u r v e 
( LSMS ) . 
What i s already known i s that unemployment has dropped t o h is to r ic l o w 3 and the 
Government’s p o l i c y prescriptions are o n target with what has been p roven to w o r k against 
poverty and inequality in other places. 

Growth Dynamics 

3. 
Panama t rad i t iona l ly has ranked among the faster g row ing economies in L a t i n and Central 
America, with strong l i n k s t o the U S market and w o r l d trade dynamics (Figure la ) . However, 
Panama’s economic development also has been characterized by a h i g h degree o f inequa l i ty 
(Figure 1 b) wh ich was exacerbated by protectionist and distortionary policies, inc lud ing

Wh i le non-poor Panamanian adults (25 and older) averaged 10 years o f schooling in 2003, poor adult Panamanians 
averaged just over 5 years and indigenous adult Panamanians averaged a meager 3 years. 
Open unemployment declined f rom 11 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2006.

i n e f f i c i e n c i e s that have limited p roduc t iv i ty gains and meant that g r ow t h has m a i n l y benefited 
the capital-intensive service sectors. This has put most economic oppo r tun i ty out o f the reach o f 
l e s s skilled members o f society; the country’s poor, inc lud ing those l i v i n g in indigenous 
communities.

F o l l ow i n g a p o l i t i c a l and 
economic debacle that culminated 
with the ouster o f General Manue l 
No r iega at the end o f 1989, 
economic g row th rebounded in 
the early 
1990s as macro- 
economic discipline was restored. 
The 1994- 1999 Perez Balladares 
administration began aggressively 
t o tackle structural weaknesses. I t

to

mented a far-reaching p r iva t iza -

stalled in the early 2000s, h ow - 
ever, am id the global s lowdown o f

Progress has since b e e n rejuven-

In October 2006, Panaman- 
i a n s voted in a national referendum 
overwhelmingly 
in support o f 
expanding 
the Panama Canal 
through the creation o f a third s e t 
o f locks. To ta l investment in the 
Canal expansion, exc lud ing those 
in ancillary activities, i s estimated t o be around 30 percent o f GDP, spread ou t over six o r seven 
years. This endeavor i s expected t o p rov ide a ma jo r boost t o economic g row th (Box 1) with 
direct bene f i ts accruing p r im a r i l y t o the economy’s t rad i t iona l ly dynamic service sectors.

In June 2007, Panama and the United States signed a f r e e trade agreement. Combined with 
past advances in economic opening, implementation o f this agreement i s expected t o limit the

scope fo r app ly ing the protectionist policies that have exacerbated the problems o f dua l i ty in the 
past. However, the bene f i ts o f f ree trade do n o t accrue automatically t o a l l segments o f the 
economy, especially t o those that have t rad i t iona l ly had limited access t o economic opportunity. 
Complementary po l ic ies that further boost competitiveness within the private sector and deepen 
access t o education, s k i l l s and capital w i l l be needed t o broaden the base o f the potential 
beneficiaries. Such po l ic ies w o u l d need to include additional measures t o reduce bureaucratic 
red tape and other regulatory burdens, continue t o lowe r barriers t o domestic competition, 
imp rove the s k i l l s o f the labor force and other measures t o reduce barriers t o fo rma l employment, 
and increase private sector p roduc t iv i ty through investments in innova t ion and technology 
adoption (Box 2). 

Box 1. The Panama Canal 

Built in 1914, the Panama Canal i s the gateway for over 140 mar i t ime routes worldwide, but to ma in ta in i t s 
global importance capacity must expand. Each year more than 12,000 oceangoing vessels (around 30 per day) 
transit the 80km long Canal br ing ing operations close to the capacity limit. So significant i s the Canal to 
international shipping that container ships, at least until recently, were b u i l t to fit i t s dimensions, k n ow n as the 
Panamax standard. Recen t grow th in wo r ld trade, however, places higher demand o n container vessels and has 
led to the development o f the Post-Panamax vesse ls that are currently too large to transit the Canal. 

The “Canal economy”, inc lud ing spillover effects, i s enormously important for the Panamanian economy 
contributing about one- f i f th o f GDP and employment. B road ly defined, the Canal system consists o f direct 
activities related to the Canal operation, indirect activities including services to container ships in transit, and, 
induced activities, such as the Co lon Free Zone or the ports, wh ich are a result o f the existence o f the Canal. 
These three generated 14 percent o f Panama’s GDP in 1999 and accounted for two percent o f employment 
according to calculations by the Panama Canal Au tho r i ty (PCA). The Canal system also has a substantial 
spillover e f f e c t on the r e s t o f the economy (known as the multiplier e f f e ~ t ) . ~ The PCA estimated that this 
mu l t ip l ie r effect added an additional four percent o f GDP and 18 percent o f employment. The Canal has also 
been one o f the most important sources o f government revenue (29 percent o f total) and contributed to 4 1 percent 
o f exports.5 

G iven the capacity constraints o f the Canal, i t s economic importance and expected w o r l d trade growth, feas ib i l i ty 
studies commissioned b y the PCA concluded that expanding the Canal i s economically sensible. The so-called 
‘ th ird se t o f locks pro jec t ’ was overwhe lm ing ly endorsed in a national referendum he ld in October 2006. At an 
estimated cost o f over US$5 b i l l i o n (almost a third o f GDP), the project w i l l expand Canal capacity through three 
components: (1) the construction o f two new sets o f locks, one set each on the A t lan t ic and Pac i f ic sides; (2) the 
excavation o f access channels to the new locks and the w iden ing o f ex is t ing navigation channels, and; (3) slight 
elevation o f Gatun Lake’s max imum operating level. Capacity w i l l be rough ly doubled, as a consequence, and 
w i l l a l low for the passage Post-Panamax vessels. The project, to be completed by 2014, i s to be financed pa r t ly 
b y t o l l revenues and pa r t ly by PCA borrow ing .6 

The expansion i s expected to have a strong positive impact on grow th and employment and w i l l also y ie ld 
considerable advantages fo r international trade and the mar i t ime industry. PCA estimates suggest that GDP may 
grow as much as one percentage po in t more per year, on average, over the next twenty years because o f the 
project. The PCA also expects employment to increase considerably b y around 45,000 in 2010 and 252,000 in 
2025. Independent estimates b y the IMF suggest a more modest employment impact o f around 20,500 in 2010 
and 44,000 in 2025.

W i t h regard to labor regulations, 
Panama exhibits non-salary labor 
costs (taxes and social secur i ty 
contributions) that are lower than 
those o f the average L A C country, 
as w e l l as more f lex ib le regulations 
fo r wo rk ing hours, and lower f i r i n g 
costs. However, f i r i n g regulations 
are 
restrictive b y 
international 
standards and m in imum wages are high relative to average value added per worker. Moreover, the e f f ic iency o f 
Panama’s j u d i c i a l system i s re la t ive ly low, at least in terms o f the monetary costs o f and the time required for 
enforcing commercial contracts. These transaction costs may contribute to Panama’s h i g h in fo rma l economic 
ac t iv i ty (64% o f GDP, 47% o f non-agricultural employment). Other potential culprits o f the h i g h leve ls o f 
in fo rma l i ty observed in Panama are associated w i t h governance and regulatory framework issues. Thus, Panama 
scores s l igh t ly be low the L A C average in con tro l o f corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, 
and po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty (Kau f inan e t al. 2006). N o t surprisingly, according to the W o r l d Economic Forum, the 
three most problematic factors for do ing business in Panama are corruption, an ine f f ic ien t government 
bureaucracy, and restrictive labor market regulations.

The lack o f s k i l l s w i t h i n the labor force i s also considered an impediment. L e s s schooling does no t appear to be 
the cu lpr i t : Panamanian workers are more educated than their L A C peers, w i t h 8.6 years o f average schooling in 
2000, compared to 6 . 1 years average in L A C and more university graduates. However, Panamanians l a g in 
technology use. I n 2004 , personal computer use rates were 5 5 percent behind the L A C average, internet use 
lagged b y 17 percent and leve ls o f f ixed and mob i le phone penetration were also be low the L A C average. 
Research and development (R&D) spending, a p roxy fo r country innovation, was also be low average. In 2002, 
Panama spent 0.38 percent o f GDP on R&D, much lower than the 0.57 percent fo r L A C and 2.5 percent in the 
OECD. 

Poverty and Inequality 

7. 
D e s p i t e Panama’s locational advantages, i t s dualistic economic structure has h is to r ica l ly 
contributed t o pe rs is ten t poverty and h i g h inequality. W i t h support f r om the W o r l d Bank, 
Panama conducted two l i v i n g standard measurement su rveys (LSMS), one in 1997 and one in 
2003 .7 Over that period, overall h i g h pove r ty leve ls , measured by ind iv idua l consumption, 
moved l i t t l e ( f rom 37.3 percent t o 36.8 percent), while extreme pove r ty declined from 18.8 
percent t o 16.6 percent. Fortunately, these weak r e s u l t s are unlikely t o be a good indicator o f 
recen t progress in pove r ty reduction. The 2003 L S M S was conducted just as Panama was

changes in the compos i t ion o f Panama’s poo r

extreme poo r l i v i n g in u rban areas almost doubled t o 16 percent, due at least in part t o m ig ra t ion

Indigenous people in Panama comprise just under 10 percent o f the population. The peoples belong to seven 
groups o f vary ing size. The three most numerous have obtained demarcated semi-autonomous comurcus: Ngobe- 
Bugle near the border o f Costa Rica, Kunu in the San B las archipelago, and Ember-Woonun in Dar ien near the 
Border w i t h Colombia. Other major ethnic groups include people descended f r om Spanish se t t le rs and Afro- 
Panamanians, though estimates put those o f m ixed heritage at 8 5 - 9 0 percent.

Panama made progress o n reducing consumption inequality b e tw e e n 1997 and 2003. The 
Gini coefficient fo r consumption declined f r om 48.5 to 46.9,'' but i t remained above the average 
f o r L a t i n Ame r ica and was h i g h by g loba l norms, especially among countries o f s im i la r wealth 
leve ls . The differences in consumption among various groups o f Panamanians were also s t i l l 
widespread in 2003. People l i v i n g in non-indigenous ru ra l areas consumed l e s s than h a l f o f their 
u rban counterparts, while those l i v i n g in indigenous areas consumed nine t imes l e s s (Figure 3). 
These economic differences are m i r ro red in other social indicators. S l igh t ly more than one - f i f th 
o f a l l Panamanian ch i ld ren were ch ron ica l ly malnourished in 2003, with the l e v e l reaching over 
h a l f fo r indigenous children. In education, while education attainment f o r the popu la t ion aged 25 
o r older was 8.6 years at the national leve l , i t was on ly 3.7 years and 3.1 years among the 
extreme poor and those l i v i n g in indigenous areas. P r ima ry enrollment rates are r is ing among 
the poor t o close the gap with the non-poor, but l e s s than one third o f extremely poo r children 
were enrolled in secondary school in 2003, compared with one-half o f poo r ch i ld ren and 85% o f 
non-poor children. The trends and disparities in social indicators are reflected in the progress 
and l ike l ihood o f Panama's achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Box 3). 

Box 3. Panama: Progress and Prospects f o r MDG Attainment 

Panama i s mak ing good progress toward meeting M D G goals on education, water and sanitation and longer term 
trends in poverty reduction. Extreme pover ty was cut nearly in h a l f be tween 1991 and 2002, approaching the 
M D G target. The poverty trend measured through 1997 and 2003 L S M S s was l e s s reassuring (extreme pover ty 
decreased f rom 18.8% to 16.6% over those f ive years using a national consumption-based pover ty line), but the 
recen t economic boom i s likely to be p ick ing up the pace o f poverty reduction once again. 
N e t pr imary enrollment increased f r om 92.1% in 1997 to 93.9% in 2003, and the ra t io o f g ir ls to boys was 95% 
for pr imary and 105% for secondary education. O n pace w i t h M D G goals, more people have access to an 
improved water source (88% in 2004, up f rom 79% in 1990) and improved sanitation (53% in 2000, up f r om 44% 
in 1990). Prospects also look prom is ing for the M D G on ha l t ing forest degradation as trends are among the 
lowest in the region: to ta l forest area decreased on ly f r om 58.8% in 1990 to 57.7% in 2005. 
However, Panama has no t yet succeeded in mak ing su f f ic ien t progress o n health indicators. The percentage o f 
chronically malnourished Panamanian ch i ldren grew f rom 14% in 1997 to 21% in 2003 (and to over 50% in 
indigenous areas). Maternal mo r ta l i ty per 100,000 l ive births also c l imbed in Panama f r om 55 in 1990 to 160 in 
2000. Panama was able to achieve about a 30% reduction in ch i ld and in fan t mo r ta l i ty f r om 1990 to 2004, bu t the 
pace o f achievement lagged behind the 40% average reduction seen across L a t i n Amer ica and the Caribbean. 

Public Spending and Social Assistance 

10. Pub l ic expenditure inefficiencies in Panama have helped perpetuate inequa l i ty and w i l l 
need attention fo r Panama t o more fu l ly capture the po ten t ia l bene f i ts o f f r e e r trade. Panama's 
pe rs is ten t inequality and the depth o f pove r ty among many o f the extreme poor argue fo r a more 
effective redistributional ro le o f the state. In addition, the private sector r e l i e s o n the state f o r 
p rov id ing and ma in ta in ing infrastructure, educating the workforce, supporting innovation, and 
regulating e f f ic ien t ly - a l l impo r tan t factors fo r ma in ta in ing domestic competitiveness. F o r 
Panama i t i s l e s s a question o f spending more o n social programs, but o f spending well. Panama 
spends 17 percent o f GDP in the social sectors, above the L a t i n Ame r ican average o f 14 percent, 
but outcomes are no t commensurate with the leve l o f investment, po in t ing t o ine f f ic iency . In 

lo The G i n i coefficient i s a measure o f inequality o f a d is tr ibu t ion o f income. I t i s defined as a ra t io w i t h values 
between 0 and 1 where 0 corresponds to perfect income equality (i.e. everyone has the same income) and 1 
corresponds to perfect income inequa l i ty (i.e., one person has a l l the income, wh i le everyone e lse has zero income). 

6 

areas o f infrastructure p rov is ion the most important challenges are negligence in managing 
pub l ic assets; weak p r i c i n g and cost recovery policies; and inadequacy o f maintenance 
expenditures in a l l the state-managed assets. 

1 1. Underdeveloped tools and systems fo r strategic planning, resource allocation, and 
mon i to r ing have limited the impact o f social, infrastructure and agriculture spending. F o r 
example, while Panama’s education and health indicators are f a i r l y good fo r the amount o f 
pub l ic spending devoted t o these sectors, those same social sector outcomes cou ld be achieved at 
a s ign i f ican t ly lowe r cost by f o l l ow i n g bes t practices applied in other countries. In add i t ion t o 
mechanisms t o a l l ow fo r a more strategic use o f funds, the 2007 Panama Country Financial 
Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) indicates that better practices 
should 
include modernized pub l ic 
financial management and procurement 
regimes; 
inefficiencies o f these regimes have contributed t o higher costs fo r observed resu l ts in a l l types 
o f government spending. 

12. F ina l ly , a stronger redistributional ro le can on ly be achieved with better targeting o f social 
assistance. Panama spends about 1% o f GDP annually o n universal subsidies inc lud ing p r i c e 
subsidies fo r electricity, cook ing gas and piped water, luxuries that most poor do no t enjoy. At 
the same time, until recen t ly , few social programs systematically targeted the poor. The 
shortcomings o f weak targeting are illustrated by the huge income-group disparities among 
social sector indicators discussed in paragraph 9 . As progress i s made through Panama’s 
targeted cond i t iona l cash t rans fe r program (Red de Oportunidades) and extremely poo r ch i ld ren 
stay healthier and complete primary school in greater numbers, increased attention w i l l need t o 
be g iven t o secondary education completion, where challenges are even greater. While 60 and 
35 pe rcen t o f new urban and ru ra l adults completed secondary school in 2003, on ly 10 pe rcen t o f 
the indigenous in the s am e cohort were able t o make that achievement. Panama, thus, has the 
opportunity t o achieve more effective public sector interventions by developing and emp loy ing 
tools fo r more strategic use o f public resources, mode rn iz ing public financial management 
institutions and practices, and by careful targeting o f social assistance. 

Summary of Development Challenges 

13. As documented in the W o r l d Bank’s recent Flagship Report f o r L a t i n Ame r ica and the 
Caribbean, Poverty Reduction and Growth: Virtuous and Vicious Circles, in the long - run a l l p ro - 
g row th policies w i l l lead t o lowe r poverty; however, in the short-run, when severe inequa l i ty i s 
no t addressed, the poo r w i l l benefit l e s s and some no t at all. The report finds that h i g h pove r ty 
l e v e l s are also a steady drag o n growth. The findings o f another recent report, Economic Grow th 
in the 1990s (W o r l d Bank, 2006), concurred: the mos t successful g row th experiences had four 
things in common: rap id accumulation o f capital, e f f ic ien t resource allocation, technological 
progress and a sharing of 
the beneJits of growth. Acco rd ing t o the draft Panama Poverty 
Assessment: Toward Effective Poverty Reduction (PA fo r thcom ing in 2007) these general 
findings are also applicable t o Panama. As discussed in the next section under “medium-term 
economic outlook”, the expansion o f the Canal and the prospects o f an FTA are bound t o boost 
economic g row th fo r some years t o come. While f u t u r e strong economic g row th in Panama 
cannot be guaranteed and continued efforts t o realize g row th projections w i l l be needed, 
Panama’s “unequal d is t r ibu t ion o f g row th benefits” stands out as the country’s greatest 

7 

development challenge. As one small-scale fa rme r put i t du r ing i n f o rm a l consultations with 
Bank staff, “there are t w o Panamas: the Canal and us.” F o r a l l Panamanians t o participate and 
b e n e f i t from the expected g row th generated by the Canal and f ree trade agreement, the poo r w i l l 
need greater access t o assets o f a l l kinds: land and capital w i l l be important, but also training, 
access t o markets, risk sharing and, perhaps most importantly, healthy and well educated 
children. 

14. As described in the next section, a ma jo r focus o f the c u r r e n t administration i s dismantling 
the divide between those who have benefited f r om the “Canal system” and those who have been 
a pa r t o f the other Panama. The administration views this as a c r i t ica l element o f i t s social 
contract with the na t ion t o expand the Canal: I f funds equal to about one-third o f GDP are t o be 
invested in the Canal, an equivalent e f fo r t i s needed t o enable Panama’s poo r t o become be t te r 
o f f .

11. Government Strategy and Economic Outlook 

15 . The Strategic V i s i o n articulated by the To r r i jos administration (2004-2009) responds to 
Panama’s development challenges and gives renewed attention t o pove r ty reduction. President 
M a r t i n To r r i jos assumed o f f ice in September 2004 with a strong p o l i t i c a l mandate that gave his 
party’s coa l i t ion a ma jo r i ty in the Leg is la t ive Assembly. Within six months o f tak ing office, the 
Government secu red passage o f a fiscal re fo rm package and a p o l i t i c a l l y difficult pension 
reform. l1 These measures f o rm part o f an ambitious medium-term development strategy, 
Strategic V is ion of Economic a n d Employment Development T ow a r d 2009, w h i c h was unveiled 
by the Authorities in early 2005 (Box 4). B u i l d i n g o n the structural r e f o rm process that was 
suspended after 1999, this strategy emphasizes fiscal discipline, transparency (Box 5) and greater 
efficiency as crucial e lemen ts f o r ensuring a sound economic base, accelerating export-led 
economic growth, creating more jobs and reducing poverty. The To r r i jos administration has se t 
an ambitious goal o f lowe r ing pove r ty by one - f i f th du r ing i t s t e r m o f o f f ice and has p r io r i t ized 
investments in human capital ( inc lud ing a b i g e f fo r t t o modernize education and training) and 
targeted social assistance ( inc lud ing the in t roduc t ion o f a flagship targeted cond i t iona l cash 
transfer program and the continued expansion o f pre-school education and p r ima ry health care, 
especially in poor and indigenous areas) as hallmarks o f this effort. 

Box 4. GOP Strategic V is ion o f Economic and Emp loyment Development Tow a rd 2009 
The Strategic V is ion i s comprised o f five pillars: 
Pillar I - Reduce Poverty and Income Inequality encompasses four dimensions: stimulate g row th and expand 
employment opportunities, especially fo r youth; b u i l d human capital o f the poor; pioneer a flagship conditional 
cash transfer program (Red de Oportunidades) wh ich brings together efforts to improve education, health, 
nu t r i t ion and basic infrastructure access targeting the poorest areas; and invest in produc t ive activities in ru ra l 
areas, inc lud ing land tenure security 
Pillar I 1 - Foster Economic Growth and Employment focuses on efforts to open the economy to international 
competition and promote export-led growth, inc lud ing through f r e e trade agreements, development o f export 
infrastructure (roads, ports, etc.), 
remova l o f distortions and un fa ir sector 
incentives, and targeted 
complementary investments in Canal expansion, irrigation, and urban transport. 
Pillar I11 - Reform Public Finance includes actions to reduce pub l ic debt, achieve f isca l sustainability and 
modernize pub l ic financial management, inc lud ing fiscal and pension reform; measures to improve the accuracy 
and transparency o f national accounting systems; modernization o f procurement and tax administration; and 
improvements in budget management. 
Pillar I V - Develop Human Capital seeks to improve the competitiveness o f Panama’s labor force and reduce 
poverty and inequality through investments in education and health. In i t ia t ives w i l l support national curr icu lum 
reform, expanded coverage o f preschool and secondary education, effective worker training, preventative and 
occupational health and nu t r i t ion programs, and expanded health, water, and sanitation infrastructure in ru ra l 
and indigenous areas. 
Pillar V - Reform and Modernize the State supports activities to help the pub l ic sector and pub l ic institutions 
become better facilitators o f countrywide development. Measures w i l l be taken to reduce corruption, improve 
private participation in infrastructure, increase competition in the e lec tr ic i ty and transport sectors, and foster 
decentralization o f service-delivery. 

These measures were supported by the FY 0 7 Public Finance and Institutional Development Policy Loan ($60 
m i l l ion) .

Box 5. GOP i s Increasing Transparency and Accountability t o Reduce Corruption and Improve 
Public Sector Efficiency 

Du r ing his inaugural speech (September 2004) President Torr i jos announced that f igh t ing corrup t ion wou ld be a 
p r io r i ty dur ing his tenure and f rom the start his administration recognized the need to strengthen pub l ic 
institutional foundations and ensure transparency as essentials to creating an economic grow th environment that 
cou ld eventually move Panama to developed-country status. This p r i o r i t y i s reflected in P i l la r V o f the 
Government’s Strategic V is ion : Re form and Modernization o f the State, w h i c h includes a multi-faceted program 
to improve transparency and fight corruption o f pub l ic institutions and finances. This program calls for 
strengthened pub l ic ethics; 
integration o f good governance principles o f transparency, 
integrity, and 
accountability in to pub l ic operations (through financial management and procurement modernization); and 
simplification o f key business procedures. Specific measures taken by the Government in each one o f these areas 
fo l lows . 

T o strengthen transparency o f Government operations and create a more open c i v i l service culture the 
Government has: (i) abolished regulations to the Transparency L a w that imposed restrictions on, rather than 
facilitated, pub l ic access to information; (ii) approved a law r a t i f y i n g the United Nations Convention Against 
Corruption; (iii) created the Na t iona l An t icorrup t ion Council, and i t s Execu t ive Secretariat, as an advisory body 
to the Executive Branch on pub l ic sector strategies related to good governance, transparency, e th ics and 
anticorruption; (iv) issued regulations establishing general principles for the standardization o f codes o f e th ics 
w i t h i n the central government, and the adoption o f such codes in a number o f pub l ic en t i t ies ; (v) established a 
financial disclosure program for pub l ic sector employees; and (vi) presented a dra f t law protecting 
whistleblowers. 

T o improve fiscal transparency and public financial management accountability, the Government has 
introduced several measures: (i) upgrading tax in forma t ion systems (e-Tax) and fostering on-line presentation o f 
income tax returns, coupled w i t h an awareness campaign and user tra in ing programs; (ii) t ime ly issuance and 
pub l ica t ion o f budget documentation, budget execution reports, financial statements, in forma t ion on debt and 
payroll, and other fiscal data; (iii) reduction o f the stock and time taken to pay accrued expenditures; and ( iv) 
implementation o f a document tracking and management system (SIGUEME) to enhance accountability and 
performance in financial transactions. 

Steps to modernize public procurement include: (i) issuance and implementation o f improved Procurement 
L a w and regulations; (ii) stronger mandate and support g iven to the regulatory body (DGCP) in the context o f an 
inter-institutional coordination e f for t ; and (iii) r o l l out o f the new e-procurement system (PanamaCompra) that 
promotes transparency and competition in pub l ic procurement (a l l central government procurement notices are 
n ow being published in the system).

Medium-term Economic Outlook 

16. Panama’s economy emerged fiom a slump in 2003 and has been booming s ince then, with 
growth rates averaging over 7.5 percent during 2004-06 (Table 2). This boom has been led by 
exports o f goods and services, which benefited fiom a worldwide recovery o f trade during this 
period, and has been accompanied by strong private consumption and investment demand. From 
a sector perspective, the economic recovery has been led by construction, transport and 

10 

commerce activities, and mos t recen t ly by an inc ip ien t recovery in financial intermediation. 
T w o sectors that have n o t exhibited significant signs o f recovery since 2002 are agriculture 
(excluding f ishe r ies ) and manufacturing.

17. D u r i n g the i n i t i a l phase o f this boom, f isca l balances exhibited a deteriorating trend. The 
overall pub l ic sector f isca l de f ic i t reached an a la rm ing 4.9 percent o f GDP in 2004 and raised 
Panama’s pub l ic debt t o 66.1 percent o f GDP, t r igge r ing new concerns about the country’s future 
debt sustainability. l2 This dec l ine p r im a r i l y reflected a deterioration in the finances o f the 
central government and o f the Social Security Institute (CSS), and was mos t ly due t o declines in 
revenues. Then, a ma jo r f isca l correction took place in 2005, reducing the ove ra l l f isca l de f ic i t 
t o 2.6 percent in 2005 t o near ove ra l l balance and a positive p r ima ry f isca l balance in 2006. 
Wh i le part o f this fiscal adjustment reflected a r i s e in revenues induced by the strong economic 
upswing, a considerable part was due t o the change in p o l i c y parameters, as the To r r i jos 
administration moved quickly t o restore f isca l s tab i l i ty (through f isca l and pension r e f o rm 
measures) l3 and reintroduced a broad re fo rm agenda. 

l2 Considering that almost a l l o f this debt i s on market terms, Panama i s ranked as one o f the most highly indebted 
countries in Latin America. 
Tax revenues rose by 3 1% in 2006, or much faster than the growth o f GDP, reflecting the impact o f the 2005 tax 
reforms and improvements in tax administration. The pension reform, in turn, halted the financial deterioration o f 

13

18. Economic g row th in 2007 i s projected t o be 8.5 percent, led by the ongoing b o om in the 
construction, commerce and tou r ism sectors, and fue led by significant capital in f lows . As the 
current dynamism o f the rea l estate markets wanes, investment activities associated with the 
Panama Canal expansion are expected t o take over as the m a i n driver o f growth, together with 
new private 
investments 
in complementary activities. 
Earlier background analyses 
commissioned by the Panama Canal A u t h o r i t y estimated that the Canal expansion w o u l d raise 
economic g row th by rough ly one percentage po in t over the next 25 years. In parallel, the f ree 
trade agreement with the United States should gradually beg in t o exe r t an effect in t e rm s o f 
encouraging export development and fo re ign investment in productive activities. Based o n these 
developments, GDP g row th i s projected t o average around 8.1 pe rcen t th rough 2010 (Table 2) - 
with a trajectory that peaks in 2008 and f a l l i n g gradually thereafter reaching 7.1 percent in 2010. 
Neve r the less , the medium-term ou t look i s s t i l l subject t o risks as explained in paragraphs 50-55. 

19. A debt sustainability analysis carried ou t by the W o r l d Bank in early 2006 under f a i r l y 
conservative medium-term g row th projections had concluded that Panama's consolidated pub l ic 
debt, which stood at 66.1 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2005 (down f i o m 70.4 percent in 2004), 
i s sustainable (in the sense o f p lac ing the public debt ra t io o n a steadily dec l in ing trajectory) i f 
the Government i s able t o ma in ta in a primary fiscal s u r p l u s o f 1.6 pe rcen t o f GDP. Under the 
current macroeconomic settings, with g row th well above the 4 pe rcen t used in baseline 
simulations and with the p r ima ry s u r p l u s well above 1.6 percent, Panama's debt ratios are 
projected t o decline much faster than p rev ious ly anticipated. These pos i t ive projections a r e 
b road ly shared b y IMF s ta f f in the last A r t i c l e I V consultation report (January 2007), w h i c h 
estimated that with the current p o l i c y framework, the consolidated public debt w o u l d fall t o 
about 5 5 percent o f GDP in 201 1 (46.5 percent excluding the estimated P C A debt). (See Annex 
2 fo r more details) 

20. A frequently raised question in t h i s context i s whether Panama's sovereign debt ra t ing w i l l 
be adversely affected by the proposed Canal expansion project. I t should no t be. The authorities 
have excluded the balances o f the Panama Canal Au tho r i ty (PCA) f r om the pub l ic sector fiscal 
accounts and have indicated that they do n o t intend t o p rov ide sovereign guarantees f o r any debt 
that may be issued by the P C A t o finance pa r t o f the Canal expansion project.14 

the Social Security Institute, wh ich reported a sma l l surplus in 2006 and whose finances are projected to improve 
further over the next few years. 
l4 However, one cannot discard the poss ib i l i ty that in a hypothetical worst-case scenario an im p l i c i t government 
guarantee wou ld be called, g iven the Canal's strategic importance for Panama's economy. While this cou ld 
po ten t ia l ly create a source o f f isca l vulnerability, the lack o f a perceptible capital market reaction t o the government 
announcement in June 2006 o f intentions to proceed with the Canal expansion project, suggests that the markets 
v i ew any potential increase in f isca l vu lnerab i l i ty as negligible. The PCA has established a long track record o f 
f inanc ia l ly sound and pro f i tab le business operations, and pre l im inary estimates indicate that the net surplus currently 
generated f rom the Canal operations (net o f t o l l fees and dividends transferred to the central government) are enough 
to service the increase in PCA debt currently envisaged under the Canal expansion project.

111. Panama -World Bank Partnership 

and 

Box 6. The Panama-World Bank Development 
Partnership was Rebuilt through a Two-year 
Interim Strategy 

21. The Bank was one o f Panama’s ma io r development partners over much o f the 199Os, a 
pe r iod in which the country made steady 
progress o n structural reforms t o open the 
economy 
imp rove 
compe-tition, 
strengthen fiscal sustain-ability and modernize 
the state. However, the Bank ’s engage-ment 
dropped o f f dramatically between 2000 and 
2004 as the Government turned away f r om the 
Bank and l e f t much o f the previous Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(FY99 -0 1) unimple- 
mented. The partnership has been successfully 
rejuvenated through the p rog ram o f activities 
that were agreed in the I n t e r im Strategy No te 
fo r the Republic of Panama ( I S N FY06-07) 
(Box 6). 

The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Panama, 
covering FY99-01, was discussed at the Board in 
October 1998. Na t iona l elections were then he ld in M a y 
1999. Over the nex t administration (Sept. 1999-Aug. 
2004), economic g row th and p o l i c y re fo rm slowed and 
the GOP turned increasingly to capital markets for 
financing, leaving much o f the CAS unimplemented. 
Implementation o f ongo ing projects languished and 
po l icy dialogue w i t h the Bank shrank to a few areas o f 
active lending w i t h decreasing attention to cross-cutting 
concerns. By the end o f FY05 , the W o r l d Bank 
po r t fo l io in Panama had shrunk to just three operations 
o f wh ich on ly about $60 m i l l i o n was l e f t to be disbursed. 

A new administration led by President M a r t i n Torr i jos 
took o f f ice on September 1, 2004 and in early 2005 la id 
out i t s five p i l la r development strategy v is ion (See B o x 
4). 
In response to the new administration’s in teres t in 
W o r l d Bank services, a demand-driven 24-month 
program was agreed as an In te r im Strategy No te (FY06- 
0 7 ) . The ISN has proven to be a valuable instrument for 
rebu i ld ing the Bank-Panama development partnership. 
I t allowed the Bank to respond qu ick ly to Panama’s 
renewed in teres t in Bank services and the I S N ’ s focus on 
analytical wo rk has given a so l id and welcomed 
foundation bo th for p o l i c y dialogue and preparation o f 
this results-based Coun try Partnership Strategy. 

22. The Interim Strategy put in to practice 
the W o r l d Bank’s then emerging strategy fo r 
M idd le - Income Countries; i t was d r iven by 
the Government o f Panama’s p r io r i t ies and 
supported selected aspects o f the new 
administration’s development strategy. The 
24-month 
program 
p rov ided 
technical 
assistance and diagnostic analytical reports t o 
generate knowledge and a more robust p o l i c y 
dialogue 
focusing o n areas o f pove r ty 
reduction and pub l ic expenditure efficiency, 
w h i c h helped 
i n f o rm other 
activities, 
inc lud ing a development p o l i c y loan, t h r e e poverty focused investment projects, and several 
ongoing lending operations (Annex 2 elaborates areas o f Bank involvement). The Bank 
determined that i t w o u l d be premature fo r i t t o associate the modest l e v e l o f activities proposed 
in the I S N with the wide-ranging medium-term development targets o f the Government. So the 
I S N indicated that i t s success w o u l d be judged in t e r m s o f “the t im e l i n e s s o f the analytical w o r k 
and qua l i ty at entry o f lend ing provided, the relevance o f Bank services t o the Government’s 
development strategy and p o l i c y formulation, the performance o f the Bank’s po r t fo l io , and the 
Government’s i n t e r e s t in a continued partnership with the Bank.” (p. 2 1 o f the I S N ) . 

23. The success o f the I S N has been reviewed in l i g h t o f the c r i te r ia i t se t forth. The quality, 
t im e l i n e s s and strategic relevance o f I S N analytical reports were assessed by the W o r l d Bank’s 
Qua l i ty Assurance Group (QAG ) through a “Country AAA Assessment” that was completed in 

13 

April 2007.15 The th ree investment projects were prepared. None has been formally reviewed 
for “quality at entry” by QAG; however, a l l received high marks o n quality from in te rna l 
reviewers and also from Government coun terpar ts . The performance o f the portfolio has been 
assessed using standard indicators, including project ratings and disbursement performance. 
From the Government’s perspective, the I S N has contributed to some o f i t s most important 
policy and program initiatives. This section reviews progress made under the I S N , discusses 
what worked well and what worked less well, explores lessons and the Bank’s comparative 
advantages and notes the other development partnerships supporting Panama. 

24. The I S N activities have been supporting key elements and programs o f the Government o f 
Panama’s five pillar strategy to help achieve i t s poverty and inequality reduction targets. Table 3 
highlights recen t Government program advances to which World Bank supported lending and 
non-lending activities have contributed. (Annex 2 elaborates on sec tor challenges, Government 
response and Bank contributions).

What Worked Well 

25. Performance o f projects 
, under implementation imp roved dramatically du r ing the I S N 
period. Credit can be g iven t o 
W o r l d Bank and Government teams fo r acting o n the lessons that 
were identified in the I S N (see 
Table 4). Disbursements hit a l l time highs16 as GOP counterparts

back in to p o l i c y discussions with the Government, as well as the comprehensive C F A P AR which 
was j o i n t l y prepared by the W o r l d Bank and IDB. Bottlenecks and inefficiencies were be ing

26. The program had strategic relevance; analytical reports were o f h i g h qua l i ty and their 
po l icy impac t was enhanced because o f their strategic coherence. The Q A G Coun t ry AAA 
Assessmen t fo r Panama gave h i g h marks t o the I S N analytical w o r k fo r “strategic relevance” and 
“coherence and integration”. l9 The common and inter-related themes o f the analytical w o r k that

assistance that took place du r ing preparation o f several reports w h i c h contributed t o the design o f 
emerging programs and legislation, inc lud ing the Red de Oportunidudes and the procurement 
law, among others. 

27. A t the end o f the day, the success o f the I S N i s best judged by the Government’s i n t e r e s t in 
con t inu ing i t s partnership with the Bank. The Government has asked that the p rog ram continue, 
that annual lend ing be increased and that the Bank expand i t s presence by opening a country 
o f f ice in Panama. In particular, the Government has praised the responsiveness o f the Bank t o 
the administration’s development strategy and the con t r ibu t ion o f analytical and technical 
assistance f r om the Bank. 

What Worked Less Well 

28. Know ledge generated f r om W o r l d Bank supported activities was no t well disseminated 
outside Government circles du r ing the 
I S N period. 
“Consultation, pa r t ic ipa t ion and 
dissemination” rece ived the lowest mark f r om QAG , obtaining o n l y a “moderately satisfactory” 
rating. The Bank agrees that while mos t aspects o f the I S N program exceeded expectations, the 
I S N consultation strategy f e l l short. That said, the potential f o r greater dissemination in the 
f u t u r e i s promising. D u r i n g consultations o n this new CPS , the authorities indicated their in te res t 
in pub l ica t ion o f a l l completed I S N reports by September 2007. 

Development Partners 

29. 

I n recent years, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Agencies o f the 
United Nations have been Panama’s most active development partners, complemented by 

modest, targeted support f r om a few b i la te ra l a id agencies (Annex 3). Panama’s partnership with 
IDB represen ts the largest donor assistance package, with an active p o r t f o l i o in early 2007 
comprising 28 loans with commitments o f US$865 m i l l i o n o f w h i c h US$403 m i l l i o n was 
undisbursed. The IDB i s active in multiple sectors t o help boost country competitiveness, 
develop human and p roduc t ive capital, and strengthen governance and transparency, inc lud ing 
help to build modern pub l ic f inanc ia l management institutions. Ac t iv i t ies supported by the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Panama target democratic governance, 
poverty reduction, energy and the environment, crisis management, and HIV/AIDS. The Andean 
Development Corporation (Corporacidn Andinu de Fomento, CAF ) has directed i t s support t o 
road infrastructure projects, inc lud ing a US$80 m i l l i o n loan in 2005 t o widen the road between 
A r ra i jan and Chorrera and rehabilitate a po r t ion o f the Transisthmian H ighway . B i la te ra l 
assistance has been more modest. Recent grants f r om J ICA and USAID have supported 
agricultural development, imp roved mon i to r ing o f water quality, watershed conservation, anti- 
co r rup t ion programs, f r e e trade, and indigenous communities. S i n c e 2001, the European U n i o n 
has also p rov ided limited a i d t o strengthen Panama’s economy, promote democratic institutions, 
and support social development.

30. The W o r l d Bank together with the In te r -Ame r ican Development Bank and the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP ) have employed an array o f approaches t o 
complement and collaborate with each other. Fo r example, The IDB and the Bank a re 
supporting the Panama Na t iona l Land Administration Program (PRONAT) th rough j o i n t land 
administration projects operating out o f same government p ro jec t coordination unit under 
common technical standards. B o t h institutions a re supporting land t i t l i n g and regularization, but 
in distinct geographic areas. In addition, the IDB i s more invo lved in b i g c i t y urban land p o l i c y 
issues and the Bank mo re in ru ra l and protected area land po l icy . Another area o f close 
collaboration has been in support t o the Red de Oportunidades where the Bank and the IDB are 
p rov id ing pa ra l le l f inanc ing using harmonized fiduciary, procurement, and mon i to r ing and 
evaluation systems. Jo in t preparation missions led t o harmonized p ro jec t designs and the 
synergistic realignment o f ongoing IDB operations in health and education. The Bank and the 
IDB also j o i n t l y prepared the 2007 C F A P AR with technical assistance p rov ided by bo th agencies 
under ongoing TA loans (each covering different beneficiary agencies). Fo r the 2007 Poverty 
Assessmen t , the Bank wo rked closely with UNDP t o harmonize p o l i c y recommendations and 
poverty assessment methodologies and indicators. 

31. The IMF conducts A r t i c l e I V reviews o n a one year cycle. The last review was d iscussed 
by the Fund’s Boa rd o n February 16, 2007. The IMF p rov ided comments o n review drafts o f 
analytical repots and the Pub l ic Finance and Institutional Development Policy L o a n (FY07).

the Bank has supported Panama in some significant way between 1990-2006 ( these are also areas 
where the Bank brings significant expe r ience f r om other countries), and also l i s t s important

Consultations 

33. Panama engages democratic processes in the development o f pub l ic po l icy . In add i t ion t o 
democratic elections - which indicate pub l ic preferences fo r the p o l i c y platforms o f pa r t ies and 
candidates - the Government makes use o f various means o f consultation t o develop reforms and 
reach agreement. Recent examples include the mu l t i -pa r ty negotiations undertaken t o conclude a 
pension reform, the na t iona l referendum o n the Panama Canal and the on-going “Conce r tac ion 
Na t iona l Para e l Desa ro l loyy .20 The proposed CPS program was developed in close dialogue 
with Panamanian authorities over a pe r iod o f about six months, inc lud ing visits, exchanges o f 
le t te rs and reviews o f draft documents. The program i s comprised o f the activities requested by 
the Government, tak ing account o f B a n k administration resources and the importance o f 
ma in ta in ing the program’s strategic coherence and integration (wh ich enhances i t s value t o 
Panama). 

20This forum for Na t iona l D ia logue fo r Development (facilitated by the UNDP ) between the Government and a 
w ide range o f social organizations, inc lud ing representatives o f indigenous peoples, i s aimed at agreeing o n a long- 
term strategy fo r economic development and pover ty eradication. Central to this strategy i s p r io r i t iz ing the use o f 
additional revenue generated by expansion o f the Panama Canal f o l l ow i n g i t s expected completion in 2014. See 
Annex 5 for details.

34. Fo rma l consultations o f the proposed CPS program were held in Panama o n June 28-29. 
These 
inc luded consultations with various stakeholders and meetings with Government 
authorities (see Annex 5). O f note, the authorities explained that the current administration plans 
t o conclude a l l ma jo r p o l i c y undertakings by end-December 2008 (to permit a pe r iod o f 
stocktaking and preparation f o r the transition t o the new administration w h i c h w o u l d take o f f ice 
Ju ly 1, 2009 f o l l ow i n g M a y 2009 elections.) As such, they asked that the D P L se r ies conclude 
with end-2008 outcomes fo r which they w o u l d be accountable. While the CPS cou ld also 
include an op t ion fo r a f o l l ow - o n D P L with the incom ing administration, they noted that any 
p o l i c y actions which m i g h t be undertaken by the incom ing administration cou ld n o t be pre- 
determined by the cu r ren t administration.

IV . Panama -World Bank Partnership Strategy (FYOS-10) 

35 . The Coun t ry Partnership Strategy aims t o p rov ide selective, demand driven assistance that 
deepens the Panama-Bank partnership and helps the Government achieve i t s pove r ty and 
inequa l i ty reduc t ion goals. The CPS supports fou r objectives w h i c h a im m a i n l y t o support the 
t w o less developed facets o f Panama’s three-faceted economy and are aligned with the p i l la rs 
and goals o f Panama’s 2004-2009 Strategic V i s i o n (Table 6). As reques ted by the Government, 
the B a n k w i l l p rov ide technical, financial, analytical and capacity building assistance t o specific 
Government po l ic ies and programs w h i c h contribute t o the partnership objectives. The p rog ram 
i s designed t o consolidate and strengthen the notable strategic in teg ra t ion that wo rked so well 
under the I S N by focusing o n a limited number o f interrelated objectives and by mak ing 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity building a cross-cutting theme. In addition, the p rog ram anticipates that 
the re w i l l be a change in Government o n Ju ly 1, 2009 , and i s se t up t o help p rov ide the new 
Government with i n f o rm a t i o n o n p o l i c y issues as well as access t o immediate f inanc ia l and 
technical support to bridge until a new Partnership Strategy i s agreed.

Results Orientation and Monitoring 

36. The resu l ts orientation o f this CPS i s present in tw o dimensions. One dimension i s 
continued support in the development o f Panama’s na t iona l statistical systems, inc lud ing help to 
strengthen national monitoring systems and support be t te r coordination in collection and use of 
data by line-ministries. Strong national statistics sys tems are an essential b u i l d i n g b lock o f 
development accountability. H e r e the Bank w i l l continue t o support the Controller General and 
the Ministry o f Economy and Finance under the Pub l ic Po l icy TA loan t o imp rove the qua l i ty o f 
macro-economic indicators and the content o f budgetary and fiscal data in l i n e with international 
best practice and t o conduct and institutionalize the household l i v i n g standards measurement 
survey. The Bank, w h i c h has been executing mu l t i -dono r funds t o support national statistics 
development in the past, w i l l also continue to help build a comprehensive national statistical 
system with support f r om the UK Department f o r International Development (DFID) (Box 8). 
D i rec t support w i l l also be p rov ided t o the M i n i s t r i e s o f Education, Health, Social Development 
and Ag r icu l tu re t o strengthen their abilities to collect and use data in coordination with Panama’s 
Na t iona l Department o f Statistics and Census through ins t i tu t iona l strengthening components in 
the Bank-financed loans. Progress in this dimension w i l l be mon i to red in the context o f the 
ind iv idua l operations, 

Box 8. Panama’s National Strategy f o r Development Statistics Advances with Bank Support 

Over 2005-2006, Panama’s Na t iona l Department o f Statistics and Census, w h i c h operates under the Con tro l ler 
General (The D i recc idn de Es tad is t ica y Censo or DEC ) has worked to prepare a Na t iona l Strategy fo r 
Development Statistics w i t h support f r om the W o r l d Bank’s M E C O V I Program.’l 
The national strategy i s 
p rov ing a use fu l t o o l to promote greater use o f evidence-based policies through better measurement o f living 
conditions and stronger linkages among the national M&E systems, bu t much wo rk remains to fully implement 
the strategy. 

One o f the ma in challenges to modernizing Panama’s national statistical system i s to update the legal framework. 
The existing Law , wh ich i s 47 years old, i s outdated and insu f f ic ien t to regulate the new and complex challenges 
o f statistical development. A new law has been prepared that wou ld help underpin the new Na t iona l Strategy and 
wou ld provide for clearer coordination w i t h i n the institutions that comprise the national system. D E C expects 
that the new L a w w i l l be approved b y the end o f 2007. 

37. The second related “resu l ts” dimension i s the iden t i f ica t ion and t rack ing o f specific 
milestones and outcomes that the W o r l d Bank program i s designed t o support over the next 2-3 
years. This dimension i s intended t o help assess the impact o f Bank-financed operations. A

inc lud ing support t o the Red de Oportunidades and supporting sustainable increases in ru ra l 
p roduc t iv i ty . The f i r s t area i s supported by the recently approved Social P ro tec t ion project 
and Pub l ic Po l icy R e f o rm TA loan. A Poverty Assessment w i l l complement w o r k planned 
under the TA loan and i t s impact w o u l d be captured through the TA loan indicators. The 
area o f sustainable ru ra l p roduc t iv i ty i s supported by the on-going L a n d Adm in is t ra t ion 
p ro jec t and the recently approved Ru ra l P roduc t iv i ty Project and i t s GEF counterpart, w h i c h 
funds sustainable use o f the A t lan t ic Mesoamerican B io log ica l Co r r ido r . A Ru ra l 
M ic ro f inance p ro jec t w i l l be designed t o support sustainability o f outcomes in the land and 
ru ra l p roduc t iv i ty programs. F o l l ow - o n social protection and land projects w i l l be prepared 
t o build f r om impacts that are achieved in this CPS period. 

Promote broad-based economic growth. The Bank program w i l l be active in th ree b road 

areas that contribute t o this objective: he lp ing t o make the national-level business 
environment more competitive (focusing regulation - inc lud ing more transparent and 
streamlined regu la t ion processes, wo rke r t ra in ing and innova t ion support), urban transport 
p lann ing in Panama C i t y inc lud ing mass transit infrastructure, and sustainable tou r ism 
outside Panama C i t y w h i c h w o u l d focus o n policy, the business environment and 
infrastructure needs in particular loca l areas. The f i r s t area w i l l be supported by the D P L 
se r ies and the on-going Pub l ic Po l icy TA loan, w h i c h are underpinned by the 2008 C EM . 
The programmatic D P L se r ies w i l l be used t o further develop and track progress towards, 
and attainment o f specific milestones and outcomes. U rban transport i s expected t o be 
influenced by the recently completed TA and mon i to r ing o f i t s impacts w o u l d be done in the 
context o f the planned loan. The planned Sustainable Tou r ism p ro jec t w o u l d develop the 
framework fo r assessing impact, and i s expected to be in part guided by the planned Coun t ry 
Environmental Analysis and i s also likely t o have l i n k s t o the Ru ra l M ic ro f inance project. 

Establish modern public f inanc ia l management (PFM) systems and institutions. The 

various interrelated areas covered by this objective and the expected outcomes that the Bank 
program i s designed to support w i l l be tracked through the programmatic D P L ser ies . 
Imp roved P F M systems are an important foundation fo r reaching the poo r th rough more 
e f f ic ien t delivery o f social assistance, fo r broadening economic opportunity th rough more 
e f f ic ien t p rov is ion o f services needed fo r bus inesses t o compete, and f o r reducing 
opportunities fo r co r rup t ion t o occur. Technical assistance w i l l come th rough the Pub l ic 
Po l icy TA loan and the Debt Management Technical Ass is tance p rog ram (provided by the 
Bank’s Treasury Department), d raw ing f r om the CFAPAR . B o t h TA activities include 
impact indicators and mon i to r ing frameworks.

Improve the health, nutrition, and education attainment of 

the poor. The CPS program 

w i l l contribute to this objective in fou r ways: expanding access t o basic health and nutrition 
se rv ices fo r poor families (through the recently approved Social Protection p ro jec t and 
th rough the planned Hea l th project), increasing the supply o f sustainable clean water and 
sanitation in low - income communities (through the recently approved Water Supply and 
Sanitation t o Low - Income Communities project), and various interventions t o imp rove 
education and access f r om pre-school through secondary school (through the on-going 

22 

Second Basic Education and the planned new education project). Panama i s also a 
beneficiary o f the Central Ame r ica regional AIDS p ro jec t w h i c h focuses o n enhancing 
regional diagnostic and surveillance capacity. H um a n development interventions are be ing 
designed to help the country imp rove performance o n lagg ing MDGs as they relate t o 
Government targets. In a l l cases, specific milestones, r e s u l t s indicators and mon i to r ing 
frameworks are built in to t h e lend ing operations. 

Capacity Building for More Effective Public Spending 

3 8 . A l igned with the W o r l d Bank’s middle income strategy and the expectations o f the 
Government (Box 9 ) , the CPS emphasizes bu i ld ing loca l capacity in l ine -m in is t r ies and agencies 
as a cross cutting theme. This ranges f r om f o r t i f y i n g counterpart ministries’ capacities’ t o p l a n 
strategically and mon i to r fo r resu l ts , t o executing projects more e f f ic ien t ly while ensuring their 
sustainability. The approach t o capacity bu i ld ing draws f r om the full range o f CPS i n s t r um e n t s . 
O n the one hand, the Bank w i l l continue t o assist the Government th rough analytical reports and 
capacity assessments t o understand the strengths and weaknesses o f sys tems and institutions i t 
seeks t o modernize generally and support the Government in implementation o f i t s re fo rm plans 
with lending and non-lending technical assistance and p o l i c y advice ( inc lud ing o n the P F M f ron t 
with assistance to MEF, the DGCP and CGR; o n the M&E f ron t with support t o DEC ; and o n the 
environment f ron t through the planned Country Environment Analysis). At the same time, the 
Bank w i l l continue t o assess the specific capacities and possible needs o f agencies and ministries 
that are counterparts in Bank-financed operations, bu i ld ing in p ro jec t components and designing 
project implementation approaches that make u s e o f their s treng ths and help shore-up 
weaknesses. He re , the Bank w i l l also give special attention t o capacity b u i l d i n g as part o f 
supervision. Over time, this two - t ie red approach aimed at strengthening country systems and 
bu i ld ing capacity within M i n i s t r i e s t o implement them e f f e c t i v e l y i s a l low ing fo r increased 
reliance o n those very systems, creating a virtuous cyc le . U s i n g l o c a l systems t o implement 
fo re ign financed projects has the potential o f mak ing them stronger as a consequence. F o r 
example, recen t ly approved Bank-financed lend ing operations w i l l u s e Panama’s national 
accounting instrument, SIAFPA, f o r project accounting, which, in turn, with Bank support, i s 
leading t o more e f f ic ien t u s e o f this t o o l in the M i n i s t r i e s . 

Box 9 . GOP Favors Building Local Capacity Over U s e o f Financial Agents 

The strategic focus o f the Ministry o f E c o n om y and F inance and the Con t ro l le r Genera l o n b u i l d i n g e f f i c i e n t and 
mode rn p u b l i c finance systems and ins t i tu t ions gave r ise t o a Governmen t re-think o n the use o f f inanc ia l agents 
t o support fore ign- f inanced p r o j e c t imp lemen ta t ion . B o t h en t i t ies conc luded tha t use o f agents was n o t o n l y 
costly, but was also perpe tua t ing weak Governmen t capacity. D r a w i n g f r o m g l o b a l experience, the Bank has 
p rov ided techn ica l assistance t o MEF and the C G R t o support the deve lopmen t o f a s tra tegy t o sys tema t ica l ly

o f pa ra l le l systems wou ld , in step, b e g radua l ly phased out. B e f o r e the end o f 2007, MEF and the C G R are 
expected t o requ ire p r i o r app rova l and j u s t i f i c a t i o n f o r use o f f inanc ia l agents in fu tu re f o r e i g n funded operations, 
revers ing wha t had become standard opera t ing procedure. 

World Bank Lending 

39. Given Panama’s status as a h igh -pe r fo rm ing middle-income country, l o w exposure t o 
IBRD and strong p o r t f o l i o performance, the Bank w i l l make available $390-$465 m i l l i o n over 

23 

FY08 -10 . These resources are expected t o rebuild Panama’s p o r t f o l i o o f W o r l d Bank financed

22 Low World Bank lending exposure in Panama i s a result o f periods o f low lending activity, including the recen t 
2000-2004 hiatus. Lending envelopes and their composition f o r future CPSs would take account o f portfolio size 
and exposure as they grow, among other factors. 
23 As circumstances unfold, the Bank together with the Government may agree to modify the lending pipeline t o 
ensure that Bank support i s adding value to the Government’s program. Should c r i t i c a l reforms in one sector stall, 
the Bank and Government could agree to shift Bank resources to another area showing more immediate promise. I n 
the highly unlikely event o f severe adverse developments on the macroeconomic or policy front, lending would be 
reduced. Any adjustments would be noted in the Progress Report.

through the f i n a l full f isca l year o f the current administration. An optional FY 10 D P L w o u l d be 
made available t o the new administration. Should the new administration choose t o access the 
optional FYlO DPL , i t w o u l d be based o n p r i o r actions that w o u l d be designed t o extend some 
key outcomes in areas supported by this CPS. The new administration would, o f course, also 
have the op t ion o f developing a new D P L se r ies with the Bank in the context o f a new CPS, o r o f 
pursuing other forms o f support as i t w o u l d see i t s requirements. 

Box 10. Public Financial Management 

The performance o f pub l ic financial management (PFM) systems including pub l ic procurement i s a c r i t ica l 
factor for f isca l discipline, strategic allocation, operational e f f ic iency and transparency in use o f pub l ic finds. 
The Bank’s 2007 Country F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty and Procurement Assessment Report (CFAPAR) concludes 
that the P F M system in Panama possesses a number o f strengths that contribute to fiscal discipline control, such 
as legal powers to contain budgeted expenditures, timely mon i to r ing o f budget execution data and cash flows, 
centralization o f revenues, and adequate debt management. However, as imp l ied b y the Government strategy’s 
p i l lar 111, Re form o f Public Finance, certain key ins t i tu t iona l issues require and are also n ow getting attention. 
The cited qualities provide a good base to continue advancing in the areas where there i s room for improvement. 
W i t h respect to the f isca l ly sustainable strategic allocation o f resources, the in i t ia t ives underway to develop a 
medium-term budget framework should continue, w i t h particular emphasis on the operational and transparent 
reconciliation o f the “top-down” fiscal framework and the “bottom-up” budgeting process (Le., costed strategic 
plans w i t h aligned investment programs), and on better con tro l o f in-year budget modifications to enhance the 
cred ib i l i ty o f the or ig ina l budget as the ma in t o o l for p o l i c y implementation. 
In terms o f operational efficiency, government procurement cou ld be optimized under the framework o f a 
comprehensive pub l ic procurement strategy comprising, among others, cost reduction strategies (price 
benchmarking, consolidation for economies o f scale) and more e f f ic ien t procedures ( inc lud ing basic tools such 
as standard documents, manuals and guidelines). The Government i s actively mov ing in that d irec t ion w i t h the 
a id o f a recently approved modern legal procurement framework. O n the other hand, transactional controls (both 
ex-ante f isca l con tro l and the en t i t ies ’ ow n procedures) cou ld be streamlined and applied o n the basis o f risk 
management considerations, and complemented b y strengthening external audit capacity. The O f f ice o f the 
Controller’s General (CGR) i s pay ing increasing attention to modernization o f ex-ante and ex-post controls as 
central pieces to i t s multi-annual strategic plan. The Ministry o f Finance, in turn, i s strengthening treasury and 
in forma t ion systems to reduce payment arrears. 
Concrete actions have been taken recently to enhance transparency o f pub l ic finances, such as the increase in 
in forma t ion that i s made pub l ic ly available and the legal pro tec t ion g iven to rights o f access to that in forma t ion . 
These are good foundations to continue imp rov ing pub l ic f inanc ia l information, w i t h a v i ew to reaching 
convergence w i t h international practice, in areas such as tax and payment arrears, qua l i ty o f f inanc ia l statements, 
and coverage o f financial audits. Progress has also been made w i t h the operation o f the electronic procurement 
system (Panamacompra), which, under the adoption o f a strategic p lan to complete i t s development and 
implementation, w i l l help ensure a smooth transition to an electronic pub l ic procurement marketplace. 

43. A l o n g with a technical assistance package o n debt management and debt ma rke t 
development, the Treasury Department w i l l advise the Government o n h ow t o take advantage o f 
the full array o f IBRD financing and risk management products. Fo r example, IBRD banking 

25 

products cou ld p rov ide flexibility to Panama in managing i t s debt, inc lud ing the ab i l i ty t o change 
the financial characteristics o f existing and f u t u r e loans to better manage the f inanc ia l risks 
relating t o in te res t rates, ro l love r and commod i ty p r i c e vo la t i l i ty . Panama has an increasing 
p o r t f o l i o o f fixed-spread loans (FSLs) with the Bank, but has yet t o t a k e full advantage o f the 
embedded risk management tools inc luded in the FSLs that address interest rate r i s k s and 
commod i ty p r ice vo la t i l i ty . Furthermore, as Panama’s loan po r t fo l io with the B a n k inc ludes 
fixed-rate single currency loans and variable-spread loans, the Government may want t o consider 
signing an International Swaps and De r iva t ives Association (ISDA) Agreement with IBRD, thus 
ga in ing access t o a range o f bank ing products t o manage the i n t e r e s t rate and currency risks o f 
these types o f loans. An ISDA Agreement may also p rov ide Panama access t o hedg ing products 
f o r debt contracted with other f inanc ia l institutions. 

Analytical and Advisory Services 

44. Given the breadth o f analytical w o r k done over the last tw o years, this stage o f the 
partnership aims t o build more in-depth sectoral analysis in to programs that are supported by 
loan financing, as part o f the emphasis o n loca l capacity bu i ld ing . Such s tud ies w i l l address 
various education and hea l th topics. 
In addition, the preparation o f tw o new cross-cutting 
analytical reports w i l l be led by W o r l d Bank s ta f f in FY09, a Poverty Assessment and an U rban 
Development Study. The u rban study w i l l focus o n poverty and related infrastructure, service 
delivery and potential social issues o f urban development. As has been the t rad i t ion with past 
Poverty Assessments, 
these studies w i l l be done t o support capacity within Government 
counterparts, inc lud ing direct technical assistance related t o immediate p o l i c y priorities. A 
Country Environmental Analysis w i l l review the state o f existing country environmental 
safeguards and help support the preparation o f a sustainable tou r ism project. Panama w i l l also 
be inc luded in at least one regional study that i s planned fo r FYOS-FY10: a study o f r u r a l 
m i c r o f inance . 

45. The analytical and advisory p rog ram also includes preparation o f p o l i c y notes that w i l l 
cover areas o f W o r l d B a n k engagement as a t o o l fo r in fo rm ing p o l i c y discussions leading up t o 
and f o l l ow i n g the 2009 na t iona l elections. The goal i s t o p rov ide objective technical views o n 
progress, challenges and p o l i c y options. The W o r l d Bank w i l l seek t o coordinate p o l i c y 
messages with other key donors, inc lud ing the IDB, IMF and UNDP . F ina l ly , with the opening 
o f a Coun t ry Office, the B a n k w i l l wo rk to foster closer t i e s t o c i v i l society and other non - 
government institutions t o en r ich the qua l i ty and po ten t ia l impact o f analytical reports and 
advice. 

IFC Activities 

46. 
I F C w i l l continue t o focus i t s operations in the f inanc ia l and infrastructure sectors t o help 
imp rove access to finance f o r underserved segments o f the population, and o n projects that 
promote g row th in l i n e with the second CPS objective (promoting broad-based economic 
growth). I F C w i l l also l o o k fo r opportunities in the extractive industry sector where I F C w o u l d 
b r i n g value-added in t e r m s o f imp roved environmental and social practices, be t te r revenue 
generation, and good bene f i ts f o r loca l and surrounding communities also in l i n e with promo t ing 
broad-based economic grow th . F ina l ly , I F C w i l l ma in ta in i t s ove ra l l i n t e r e s t in supporting 

26 

institutions that have a reg iona l focus rather than a country l e v e l focus, so that small economies 
in the area wou ld benefit f r om economies o f scale in various aspects, inc lud ing physical and 
financial infrastructure. 

Donor Harmonization and Coordination 

47. The Directorate o f Technical Cooperation at the Ministry o f Economy and Finance i s 
responsible fo r donor coordination. This Directorate also se rves as the l ia ison fo r non- 
reimbursable technical assistance used in the preparation o f Bank - f inanced investment projects. 
S ta f f f rom the Directorate o f Technical Cooperation regu la r ly engages in w o r k program p lann ing 
with Panama's various development partners o n an ind iv idua l basis, ensuring that the 
Government's strategic needs are be ing met. Donors then coordinate amongst themselves in 
complementary o r overlapping program areas. 

48. As the size o f the W o r l d Bank program in Panama grows, coordination and harmonization 
w i l l become an increasing focus, especially with the IDB t o ensu re synergies among the lend ing 
programs. This w i l l be aided by the opening o f a W o r l d Bank Coun t ry o f f ice in Panama C i ty . 
As part o f the consultations fo r preparation o f this CPS, the Bank and IDB have gone through the 
CPS program t o identify areas o f potential synergy and agreed o n collaboration approaches in 
bo th lending and non-lending activities. These range f r om consultation between IDB and W o r l d 
Bank teams t o support program synergies, to j o i n t p ro jec t preparation o r supervision o f projects 
in a common sector. (See Table 3 in Annex 3). 

Risks 

49. The staged approach o f stepped up partnership with Panama, b u i l d i n g f r om an Interim 
Strategy (FY06-07) t o a full Country Partnership Strategy, has fac i l i ta ted the ta i lo r ing o f 
program commitments t o evo lv ing developments while reducing risk. Panama i s in a stronger 
macroeconomic pos i t ion than i t was when the I S N was agreed, and the p o l i t i c a l situation has also 
proved conducive to advancing o n p o l i c y reforms in l i n e with the administration's Strategic 
Vision. In addition, the ma jo r i ty o f activities proposed in this CPS have a strong foundation in 
on-going work, inc lud ing strong po r t fo l io performance. 

50. Though macroeconomic vulnerabilities have diminished as g row th has accelerated, debt 
has fa l len as a share o f GDP, and f isca l balances have improved, the medium-term ou t look i s n o t 
completely w i thou t r i s k s . The strategy takes in to account po ten t ia l risks in th ree areas: 
economic, po l i t ica l and p o r t f o l i o performance. 

5 1. Economic: Panama i s currently experiencing a ma jo r economic boom, in part fue led by 
external resource in f lows , especially in the rea l estate market. This raises the poss ib i l i ty o f 
overheating the economy and o f in t roduc ing various distortions in the f o rm o f rea l exchange rate 
over-valuation and ra is ing rea l wages above l e v e l s supported by p roduc t iv i ty growth. But, by 
keeping the economy open and extending the openness through f r e e trade agreements, inc lud ing 
with the United States, the p ressu res o n the economy are expected t o be relieved. The Bank i s 
supporting the Government in analysis o f economic challenges and possible actions in the 
Country Economic Memorandum, a d ra f t o f w h i c h w i l l be discussed with Government in late 

27 

2007 f o r comp le t ion in 2008. At the sector level, there i s the risk o f rap id urbanization that i s 
outpacing the Government’s u rban p lann ing and regulatory capacities, as well as i t s ab i l i ty t o 
p rov ide adequate pub l ic infrastructure. As requested by the Government, the Bank w i l l prepare a 
study o f U r b a n Development t o contribute t o the discussion o f possible actions and priorities. In 
addition, just as the country’s openness and economic structure have a l lowed Panama t o benefit 
f r om the recent g loba l upturn, the country i s vulnerable t o an economic g loba l s lowdown w h i c h 
cou ld have a negative impac t o n canal trade, exports and related economic activities. 

52. The expansion o f the Canal i s a large undertaking and thus raises the poss ib i l i ty that 
comp le t ion o f the p ro jec t w i l l exceed the budget, or that Panama Canal Au tho r i ty revenues w i l l 
f a l l short. This cou ld po ten t ia l ly increase bo r row ing needs and increase demand f o r materials 
and labor in what i s already expected t o be a t igh t market. However, the authorities are 
confident that the thorough preparations m i t iga te strongly against this poss ib i l i ty and ensure that 
construction costs w i l l n o t surpass projections. The budget estimates inc lude contingencies o f 20 
percent t o deal with unforeseen even ts and price escalations. In addition, e f f e c t i v e Ju ly 1, 2007, 
the Canal Au tho r i ty raised tolls. This w i l l generate an estimated $1.3 b i l l i o n in additional 
revenue be tween 2007-2014 (beyond o r ig ina l financing plans) with scope f o r f u t u r e increases as 
needs a r ise . The B a n k w i l l support the Government in mon i to r ing f isca l sustainability and 
po ten t ia l vulnerabilities through the C E M and the D P L ser ies . 

53. Another po ten t ia l source o f vu lne rab i l i ty i s Panama’s re la t ive ly h i g h l e v e l o f external debt. 
This po ten t ia l ly renders the country vulnerable t o increases in international i n t e r e s t rates o r 
otherwise tighter capital market conditions. This risk, however, i s offset t o a considerable extent 
by th ree factors: 

0 

0 The Government’s sound fiscal management w h i c h has led t o substantial p r ima ry s u r p l u s e s 
causing debt t o decline. The Bank w i l l continue t o support the Government in these areas 
through the D P L ser ies . 
Panama has considerable rese rves and assets w h i c h offset i t s debt l iab i l i t ies . Fo r example, 
Panama’s Trust Fund f o r Development (Fondo Fiduciario), w h i c h was established in 1995 
with funds collected f r om p r iva t iza t ion o f pub l ic en te rp r ises and the sale o f some reverted 
areas had assets equivalent to 8.5% o f GDP in 2004. The Canal i t s e l f i s another significant 
Government asset. These contribute t o a substantially lowe r net debt. 
The Government has been imp rov ing debt management and w i l l continue these efforts with 
technical assistance f r om the Bank’s Treasury.

As noted under t h e lend ing discussion (para. 39-43), in the h i g h l y unlikely even t o f severe 
adverse developments o n the macroeconomic o r p o l i c y front, development p o l i c y lend ing w o u l d 
be recalibrated and ove ra l l lend ing w o u l d be reduced. 

54. Political: President To r r i jos enjoys wide popu la r i ty and i s supported by a m a j o r i t y in the 
Leg is la t ive Assembly. H i s Government will complete i t s t e r m o f o f f ice o n June 30, 2009. 
Under Panama’s Constitution, 
the president may n o t be elected t o a consecutive t e rm . 
Traditionally, new administrations have upon tak ing o f f ice made substantial changes within the 
c iv i l service, especially in l i n e ministries. These staffing changes can make an o rde r ly transition 
challenging and can be disruptive t o on-going programs, inc lud ing those where the Bank i s 

28 

p rov id ing support. The Bank is , o f course a sma l l actor in t h i s process. As recommended by 
QAG, the Bank w i l l support the transition by preparing a se t o f p o l i c y notes t o p rov ide 
presidential candidates with an additional source o f in fo rma t ion about development challenges 
and on-going policies and programs. 
In addition, the Bank w i l l coordinate with the new 
administration o n t ra in ing needs, especially with respec t t o p ro jec t implementation. 

5 5 . P o r t f o l i o P e r f o r m a n c e : The composition o f the po r t fo l io i s changing in tw o important 
ways w h i c h are likely t o affect disbursement rates in the short-term. First, many new projects 
are be ing added t o the po r t fo l io , inc lud ing new projects with ministries that have l i t t l e experience 
in project execution. Projects tend t o disburse at lowe r rates over the f i r s t 1-2 years. Secondly, 
executing agencies are fo rgo ing the use and support o f pa ra l le l systems and agencies, which i s 
also likely t o temporarily s low the pace o f p ro jec t implementation and disbursements. The Bank 
and Government are prepared f o r these changes and are wo rk ing t o m i t iga te against the r i s k s 
through in tens ive capacity bu i ld ing efforts and more active Bank presence in Panama through 
the opening o f a Country O f f ice . Moreover, the r i s k s o f a short-term s lowdown in the rate o f 
p ro jec t implementation are considered acceptable in l i g h t o f the substantial up-side po ten t ia l o f 
b u i l d i n g more e f f i c i e n t pub l ic f inanc ia l management institutions and capacity in the l i n e 
ministries that are tasked with b r ing ing imp roved social assistance and services t o the poor.

Under t h e framework o f the Interim Strategy N o t e (FY06-07) 
the Bank p rov ided 
analytical, technical and financial support t o select government in i t ia t ives w h i c h formed 
part o f the To r r i jos administration’s 2004-2009 Na t iona l Strategic V is ion . The Country 
Partnership Strategy builds f r om w o r k in those areas and also includes support in selected 
new areas where the B a n k offers a comparative advantage. 

This annex provides additional background in fo rma t ion o n development challenges 
facing sectors in w h i c h the Bank program i s active, inc lud ing what was done under the 
ISN and what i s planned under the CPS. Table 1 (on the f o l l ow i n g page) maps out the 
p i l la rs o f the Government’s Strategic Vision, specific sectoral challenges where the Bank 
i s supporting the Government response, relevant Government programs, and related Bank 
ISN and CPS activities. The f o l l ow i n g text elaborates each o f these topics by p i l la r . 

P i l la r I: Reduce Poverty and Income Inequality 

A. W e a k T a r g e t i n g o f S o c i a l Ass is tance and I n e f f e c t i v e P r o g r a m s 

As assessed in the d ra f t Panama Poverty Assessment: Toward Effective Poverty 
Reduction (forthcoming in 2007), Panama’s expenditure o f 1.7% o f GDP o n social 
assistance surpasses the L a t i n Ame r ica average by 70%, but the resu l ts , in t e r m s o f 
supporting greater economic equality, have no t been commensurate with the l e v e l o f 
spending. Two-thirds o f Panama’s social assistance spending in 2005 went t o universal 
subsidies f o r electricity, utility p rov ided water, cook ing gas and gasoline - luxuries that 
are usua l ly beyond the reach o f poo r families. At the same time, poo r people, especially 
those l i v i n g in indigenous areas have lacked access to basic social services due t o b o t h 
demand and supply s ide constraints. The historic lack o f coherence in social assistance 
programs has contributed t o weak pove r ty impact. This impac t w o u l d be substantially 
strengthened by consolidating programs, imp rov ing the targeting o f social assistance t o 
benefit ma jo r at-risk groups, pa r t icu la r ly the extreme poo r and those l i v i n g in indigenous 
areas, and systematically mon i to r ing and evaluating t o make sure money i s getting 

desired resu l ts . 

E f fo r ts t o build Panama’s capacity in mon i to r ing and analyzing pove r ty data and trends, 
and app ly ing data t o social assistance have begun to fac i l i ta te better targeting o f 
resources, but challenges remain. The Na t iona l Census and Statistics Directorate (DEC) 
faces capacity constraints to ins t i tu t iona l iz ing regular L i v i n g Standard Measurement 
Su rveys (LSMS) as pa r t o f i t s ro le as the focal p o i n t coordinating na t iona l statistics. An 
additional challenge i s t o ensure the transfer o f knowledge in data p roduc t ion and pove r ty 
analytics f r om the MEF t o s ta f f in D EC and the new Social Po l icy D i v i s i o n in the 
Ministry o f Social Development (MIDES), created in 2005 t o oversee social p o l i c y

B. High Rural Poverty Due to Insufficient Economic Opportunity 

D e s p i t e be ing at the fo re f ron t o f Central Ame r ica in per capita income, Panama’s ru ra l pove r ty 
remains high; 54% o f ru ra l non-indigenous res iden ts were poor and 22% extremely poo r in 2003. 
Among the indigenous, a staggering 98.4% were poor, and 90% extremely poor. Progress o n 
ru ra l poverty reduction i s impeded by limited economic opportunity p a r t l y generated by the 
poor’s lack o f access t o land, land t i t l e s and microfinance, and structural constraints o n 
competitiveness in t h e agricultural sector. 

Annex 2 

Page 4 o f 14 

Panama’s ru ra l sector has one o f the most skewed distributions o f land in the Central America, 
and efforts t o equalize land access f o r the ru ra l poo r have been impeded by land administration 
hurdles. In 2001, the poor, who accounted fo r two - th i rds o f the r u r a l population, owned on ly one 
third o f the land. O n l y one-third o f agricultural land was titled, and o f those 85% o f t i t l e s 
belonged t o the non-poor. Today, 20,000 t o 30,000 families s t i l l lack access t o land, which has 
increased p ressu re t o occupy land in forests and protected areas, threatening b iod ive rs i ty and 
long-term environmental sustainability. Panama has in recent years made headway in imp rov ing 
land administration, r u r a l land regularization, and protected area management. However, these 
efforts need strengthening, as land administration services, inc lud ing t i t l ing , registration and 
cadastre services, are s t i l l under-funded and fragmented, and b iod ive rs i ty remains threatened. 

Structural inefficiencies and sector management challenges in the agricultural sector have 
contributed t o weak g row th in agriculture, l im i t i n g pove r ty reduction. Sector expenditures under 
the Ministry o f Ag r icu l tu re (MIDA) are no t e f f ic ien t ly aligned with Panama’s comparative 
advantages, w h i c h has dragged d ow n agricultural performance. The ru ra l sector i s dominated by 
isolated small-scale farmers inadequately linked t o extension se rv ices , ru ra l finances and 
markets, preventing farmers f r om modernizing their practices and se l l ing more products under a 
more open trade environment. MIDA’s management structures and operations also need 
modernization, inc lud ing mon i to r ing and evaluation o f sector interventions t o enhance sector 
learning. 

Government Response: 

Enhance landsecu r i ty and access for the r u r a l poor . In l i n e with Panama’s 2004-2009

P i l la r 11: Promote Economic Growth and Development 

A. Restricted Market Access and Insufficient Competitiveness 

In the early 1990s Panama had one o f the most distorted trade regimes in the region. As late as 
1996, ta r i f fs ranged f r om zero t o 90%, basic grains had even higher ta r i f fs and quotas and other 
non - ta r i f f barriers (NTBs) were used extensively, resu l t ing in h i g h food prices and extremely l o w 
agricultural p roduc t iv i ty and incomes. Over the next few years, the Government lowe red ta r i f fs 
and eliminated a l l NTBs. Tariffs were reduced t o a max imum o f 15% (with the exception o f 
cars, milk, r ice and sugar). Certain ta r i f fs were subsequently increased by the incom ing 
administration (1999-2004). As o f January 2007, Panama's median tariff remained l o w at 3%, 
with an average o f 6.6%, but with a re la t ive ly h i g h dispersion across products. T w o percent o f 
t a r i f f l i n e s face ta r i f fs greater than 15% (v i r tua l ly a l l o f them affect f o o d products, inc lud ing 
chicken parts (260% tariff), milk products (up t o 155% tariff) and sugar (144%)). The 
Government has continued the d isuse o f core NTBs (e.g., quotas, impo r t l icenses , an t i -dump ing 
and countervailing duties). Furthermore, in late 2006 the GOP implemented an impo r tan t 
ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm that imp roved the transparency o f the pub l ica t ion and enforcement o f 
phytosanitary standards fo r the impo r ta t ion and commercialization o f agricultural and f o o d 
products. 

In 1996, the government passed a compe t i t ion l a w w h i c h removed rema in ing p r ice controls and 
established an anti-trust and consumer p ro tec t ion framework, 
inc lud ing creation o f the 

Annex 2 

Page 6 o f 14 
Compe t i t ion and Consumer A f fa i rs Comm iss ion (CLICAC). ' This f ramewo rk has begun t o take 
hold, but important areas o f deregulation w o u l d contribute t o e l im ina t ing rema in ing distortions. 
F o r example, compe t i t ion in o i l re f in ing and marketing has continued t o be restricted, inc lud ing 
through d i f fe ren t ia l taxes, administered prices and other measures. 
In addition, the breach 
between the h i g h minimum wages and skill l e v e l o f many in the labor force i s an obstacle t o 
achieving g row th po ten t ia l under more open markets. Education and t ra in ing disparities w i l l 
need attention t o help close this gap. Compe t i t ion w o u l d also benefit f r om app ly ing bes t 
practices t o support innovation. Pub l ic R&D spending as a percent o f GDP t ra i ls 30% behind 
L A C averages. F ina l ly , streamlined and imp roved regulations and procedures f o r SME start-up

B. Growth and Urban Poverty Reduction Impeded by Inadequate Transport Network I n 
Panama City 

Congestion and strained pub l ic transport services in Panama C i t y have increased costs o f do ing 
business and are an obstacle t o urban pove r ty reduction. 46% o f Panamanians live in Panama 
C i ty , but inadequate transport investments and policies have led t o da i ly congestion and t ra f f ic 
bottlenecks, poo r t ra f f ic management, and de f ic ien t road and public transport s e r v i c e s , 
particularly o n key trunk l ines . In 2004, congestion delays in Panama C i t y cost an estimated 
$300 m i l l i o n in p roduc t iv i ty losses, equivalent t o 2.2% o f Panama’s nom ina l GDP. Congestion 
and limited mass transit alternatives have also reduced economic opportunities fo r the urban poo r 
who disproportionately rely o n ine f f ic ien t pub l ic transportation requ i r ing hours t o reach j o b 
centers. U rban pove r ty g rew f r om 15.3% in 1997 t o 20.0% in 2003, even as ove ra l l pove r ty 

declined. 

Government Response:

careful land use planning, infrastructure development with attention t o environmental safeguards 
and capacity b u i l d i n g and t ra in ing o f loca l laborers. 

Government Response: The Government, th rough I P A T (Instituto Panamenio de Turismo), has 
undertaken a systematic inven to ry o f areas with tou r ism potential and with assistance f r om 
UNDP , IDB and O M T (Organizacion Mund ia l de Tursimo) i s preparing a l o n g t e r m master p l a n

A. High Fiscal Deficits and Debt Threatened Long-Term Sustainability 

Panama’s fiscal balance began t o deteriorate rap id ly after 2000, resulting in primary d e f i c i t s in 
2003 and 2004. This decline r e f l e c t e d deterioration in finances o f the central government and 
the Social Security Institute (CSS), mos t ly due t o declines in revenues, rather than increased 
expenditures. In parallel, the ranks o f c iv i l servants swelled, pa r t icu la r ly in the CSS, creating 
additional budget p ressu res . F isca l administration also became less transparent; f o r example, 
increasing recourse was taken t o de f ic i t f inanc ing v i a payment arrears, w h i c h obscured the 
qua l i ty o f fiscal information. Panama’s ove ra l l pub l ic sector fiscal d e f i c i t reached an a la rm ing 
4.9 pe rcen t o f GDP in 2004, ra is ing Panama’s pub l ic debt t o 66 pe rcen t o f GDP, and t r igge r ing 
new concerns about the country’s f u t u r e debt sustainability. 

Government Response: T o strengthen f isca l discipline, the To r r i jos administration adopted 
f isca l and pension reforms that put Panama’s debt trajectory back o n sustainable pa th and 
medium-term fiscal targets (2009) within reach.2 Bank Contribution over the I S N . The F Y 0 7

medium-term progress. 
Develop medium-term, policy-based budgeting. The Government has established a 2006- 
2009 medium-term budgetary framework and aims t o strengthen pub l ic investment p lann ing 
and forecasting. The Government has also begun wo rk t o develop a medium-term f isca l and 
budgetary framework, inc lud ing preparation o f fiscal projections and draft mu l t i -annua l 
budgets t o achieve more p roduc t ive investments and be t te r allocate pub l ic resources in l i n e 
with national objectives and f isca l po l icy . Bank Contribution ove r the I S N . The d ra f t 2007 
CFAPAR d iscusses the importance o f imp roved medium-term budgeting integrating accurate 
sector and ins t i tu t iona l budgets, and o f imp roved compliance with public investment 
programming procedures. The F Y 0 7 D P L supported advances in medium-term budgeting 
and helped identify medium-term indicators. 
Modernize public procurement. T o generate savings, Government has taken steps t o 
modernize the procurement system, inc lud ing re fo rm ing the Pub l ic Procurement Directorate 
(DCP), developing a comprehensive procurement strategy, launching an e-procurement 
system (PanamaCompra), and adopting a new procurement l a w (Ley 22) that modernizes 
procurement practices. Bank Contribution over the I S N . The 2007 C F A P A R assessed the 
re fo rm strategy and p rov ided just-in-time p o l i c y advice, inc lud ing t o the d ra f t procurement

Pillar I V : Develop Human Capital 

A. Education Attainment Lowe r Among Rural Poor, Especially Indigenous Groups 

Education attainment increased among a l l demographics in recent years, but attainment in r u r a l 
and indigenous areas t ra i ls that in urban areas, and the gap between indigenous and non- 
indigenous i s widening. Acco rd ing to the draft 2007 Poverty Assessment, average schooling 
among young adults i s 10.5 years. U rban areas lead the w a y averaging nearly 12 years, but 
attainment falls t o about nine years in ru ra l areas and six years in indigenous areas. D i f f e r i n g 
attainment rates are attributable t o lack o f schools in ru ra l and indigenous areas, weak qua l i ty o f 
basic and secondary education, and school-related costs that continue t o put education ou t o f 
reach fo r poor households. Preschool enrollment, a key factor favo r ing retention in later years, 
increased f r om 33% in 1997 t o 50% in 2003, but 60% o f poo r ch i ld ren are s t i l l no t enrolled due 
t o poor coverage and lack o f human resources fo r expanding fo rma l programs. In 2003, na t iona l 
primary enrollment reached 94% and secondary enrollment reached 70%.3 Am o n g the extreme 
poor, primary enrollment lagged at 88% in 2003 and secondary enrollment was dramatically l e s s

Primary enrollment figures in the CPS are based on the draft FY07 Poverty Assessment calculations from the 1997 
and 2003 L iv ing Standards Measurement Surveys. Government data shows that primary enrollment grew from 
91.4% in 1990 to 100% in 2005; however, LSMS data i s widely considered more comprehensive as i t i s based on a 
representative sampling o f households, and r e f l e c t s widely observed enrollment issues for children o f the extreme 
poor and the poor, and in rural and indigenous areas. 

Page 12 o f 14 
at 32%, despite hav ing r i s e n s ign i f ican t ly f r om 19% in 1997. P r ima ry school coverage needs 
expansion, but secondary schools are pa r t icu la r ly lack ing in ru ra l and indigenous areas. 
Suboptimal qua l i ty and relevancy o f curriculums and language barriers also lowe r attainment by 
fue l ing h i g h repe t i t ion and drop-out rates. 

Annex 2 

Government Response: T o boost education attainment among Panamanians, GOP i s w o r k i n g 
t o expand coverage o f preschool, primary and secondary education especially in r u r a l and 
indigenous areas, inc lud ing through innovative approaches, such as b i l ingua l education and 
video-based d is tance education fo r secondary students. 
Expand non-formal preschool education to reach poor children. Panama’s N a t i o n a l 
Strategic V i s i o n p r io r i t izes increasing preschool enrollment f r om 50% t o 75% f r om 2004 t o 
2009. Given cost and human resource hurdles, Government i s expanding in fo rma l programs 
in ru ra l and indigenous areas to p rov ide equal access t o the poorest. Bank Contribution 
over the I S N . The ongoing Basic Education I1 p ro jec t has established non - fo rma l preschool 
education and home-based i n i t i a l education programs serving nearly 100,000 children, 
representing over 50% o f to ta l enrollment. 
Improve quality and expand coverage of pr imary and secondary education to reach poo r . 
Government has p r io r i t ized increasing primary and secondary enrollment and comp le t ion 
rates between 2004 and 2009 by expanding coverage in poo r and ru ra l areas and re fo rm ing 
curriculums. Bank Contribution ove r the I S N . The Bank’s d ra f t 2007 Poverty Assessment 
analyzed education trends. The ongoing Basic Educa t ion I1 p ro jec t has built 167 new 
p r ima ry schools, p rov ided scholarships t o over 30,000 poo r students, and introduced over 90 
video-based distance education programs (telebasicas) b r ing ing secondary education t o over 
4,500 students in ru ra l areas. 

The CPS w i l l continue t o support these areas and p rov ide assistance t o promote sector re fo rm : 

> Expand non-formal approaches to preschool education. Add i t iona l f inanc ing under the 

ongoing Education I1 p ro jec t w i l l support more than 500 additional non - fo rma l and home- 
based preschool education programs. 

> Expand coverage in primary and secondary education and improve s k i l l s training, 

including through sector reform. The ongoing Education I1 p ro jec t w i l l continue 
rehab i l i ta t ion o f p r ima ry school infrastructure and expand video-based secondary education 
programs in ru ra l and indigenous areas. Sector re fo rm w i l l be addressed in current and 
fo l low -on education projects with a focus o n im p r o v i n g sector planning, and establishing and 
imp lemen t ing a comprehensive management in fo rma t ion system t o strengthen regional and 
sector oversight. The planned third p ro jec t w i l l a im t o institutionalize advances in the second 
education p ro jec t and p rov ide greater support f o r imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f secondary 
education and j o b t ra in ing t o help ensu re l i n k s t o the j o b market. 

B. Increasing Malnutrition Rates, Especially Among Poor And Indigenous Groups 

Panama’s ma lnu t r i t ion rates have c l imbed in recent years, pa r t icu la r ly among poo r and 
indigenous groups. The national ma lnu t r i t ion rate (height f o r age) among ch i ld ren under f i v e 
increased f r om 14.3% in 1997 t o 20.6% in 2003. Within this trend, however, are clear 
demographic disparities. In 2003, on ly 10% o f non-poor and 14% o f urban ch i ld ren under f i v e 
were ch ron ica l ly malnourished, but these rates c l im b t o nearly 19% in ru ra l areas, 40% among 
the extremely poor, and over 50% in indigenous areas. Con t r ibu t ing factors t o ma lnu t r i t ion are a 

Page 13 o f 14 
lack o f awareness and knowledge o f nutrition, inappropriate food preparation practices, and a 
lack o f simple o ra l re-hydration solutions t o help alleviate diarrhea i l l n e s s e s . In addition, the 
poo r and indigenous lack o f access t o adequate and va r ied diet and the means t o acquire needed 
supplements, 

Annex 2 

Government Response: 
Introduce nu t r i t ion p rog rams ta rge ted to extreme p o o r . T o reduce chronic ma lnu t r i t ion in 6- 
9 year olds f r om 22% in 2004 t o 15% in 2009, the Government has introduced new early 
nu t r i t ion intervention programs targeting the extreme poo r under the R e d de Opo r tun idades 
(RDO). Bank Contribution over the I S N . Demographic analysis o f n u t r i t i o n status was 
part o f the draft 2007 Poverty Assessment. 

The CPS w i l l support targeted n u t r i t i o n programs in ru ra l and indigenous areas: 

> Introduce nutrition programs targeted to extreme poor. The recently approved Social 

Protection Project w i l l support the development and integration o f a comprehensive p ro toco l 
t o prevent ma lnu t r i t ion i n t o the Ministry o f Health’s basic package o f hea l th services and the 
delivery o f this enhanced package in poo r indigenous areas bene f i t ing f r om cash transfers 
under the RDO. 

C. Key Health Outcomes L a g Behind Panama’s Peers And Deteriorated Among the Poor 

Trends in key health outcomes have no t matched progress in middle income countries in the 
L A C and have worsened among Panama’s poor. Panama’s c h i l d and in fan t mo r ta l i ty rates 
between 1990 and 2004 f e l l about 30% but dropped l e s s than rates in other middle income 
countries in the region. Between 1990 and 2000, Panama’s middle income pee rs in L A C 
achieved reductions in maternal mo r ta l i ty , but in Panama maternal mo r ta l i ty appeared t o climb 
f r om 55 to 160 per 100,000 live births (at least part o f this change may be attributable t o 
imp roved data collection). Am o n g non-poor children, immun iza t ion rates rose between 1997 
and 2003, but rates dropped among poo r and extremely poo r children. Diarrhea i l l n e s s among 
non-poor ch i ld ren f e l l about 6% f i o m 1997 t o 2003, but among the extreme poo r increased about 
14% t o reach nearly 30% in 2003. 
Suboptimal o r worsening health outcomes are driven by multiple factors. The Ministry o f H e a l t h 
(MINSA) and the Social Security Institute continue t o support fragmented and overlapping 
programs, imped ing e f f i c i e n t delivery o f qua l i ty s e r v i c e s and pharmaceuticals in ru ra l areas. 
Contracts with NGOs assigned t o deliver MINSA’s package o f basic hea l th services (Paque te 
I n t e g r a l de Serv ic ios de Sa lud - PAISS) in ru ra l areas have been inadequately monitored, 
con t r ibu t ing to spotty performance o n coverage and s e r v i c e targets. Hea l th c l in ics and services 
are lack ing in comarcas and isolated ru ra l areas, and the inab i l i ty t o pay f o r services remains a 
challenge fo r the poor. L a c k o f appropriate consideration o f indigenous peoples’ d i f fe r ing 
cu l tu ra l perspectives o n healthcare has also complicated service delivery. Ch i ldhood i l l n e s s has 
been exacerbated by limited access t o water and sanitation. In 2004, access t o imp roved water 
supply was estimated at 75% in ru ra l areas and 56% in indigenous areas, and sanitation coverage 
was estimated at on ly 39% in indigenous areas. E f fo r ts t o imp rove water and sanitation coverage 
have been impa i red by the lack o f a na t iona l p o l i c y framework and insu f f ic ien t coo rd ina t ion 
among sector stakeholders, inc lud ing the Na t iona l Water and Sewer Agency, the Social 
Investment Fund, and MINSA.

Government Response: 
Expand coverage of healthcare services in rural and indigenous areas. Based o n the 
national Strategic Hea l th Plan, Government i s wo rk ing t o imp rove healthcare services and 
coverage in ru ra l and indigenous areas. GOP i s focusing pa r t icu la r ly o n increasing the 
supply o f health se rv ices available to poo r households under the Red de Oportunidades CC T

between the poo r and non-poor and between urban, ru ra l and indigenous areas. 
Improve water and sanitation coverage in rural areas. T o imp rove water and sanitation 
coverage and boost the number o f ru ra l households with access t o potable water f r om 75% in 
2004 t o 82% in 2009, Government introduced commun i ty -d r iven water programs under the 
Red de Oportunidades, and established an inter-institutional committee chaired by MINSA t o 
imp rove program coordination and services, Bank Contribution under the I S N . As part o f 
the preparation o f the Water and Sanitation project, the B a n k supported a national dialogue 
o n water p o l i c y that brought together key stakeholders. 

The CPS (FY08-10) w i l l continue t o support these areas: 
> Expand coverage o f healthcare services in ru r a l and indigenous areas. The recently 
approved Social Protection Project w i l l p rov ide support t o imp rove the management and 
mon i to r ing o f the Red de Oportunidades, enhance beneficiary pa r t ic ipa t ion in the CC T

CPS Consultations with Panamanian Stakeholders 

As part o f the preparation o f this Country Partnership Strategy, fo rma l consultations were 
held in Panama C i t y o n June 28-29, 2007. These consultations included p r ima r i ly sectoral 
government representatives as well as representatives f r om bus iness , the international donor 
commun i ty and think tanks. The Bank team was led by Jane A rm i tage (Country D i rec to r ) 
and inc luded s ta f f and sector leaders f rom each key sector. Ea r l ie r rounds o f more in fo rma l 
consultations were held in b o t h M a y and June 2007 du r ing a se r ies o f meetings with loca l 
stakeholders (in the provinces o f Veraguas and Bocas del Toro, and the indigenous comarca 
o f K u n a Yala) t o so l ic i t views o n h o w ongoing and future Bank activities cou ld more 
e f fec t ive ly support the Government's development agenda. In addition, in M a y 2007 the CPS 
team convened discussions with a range o f Panamanian opinion-makers t o ta lk about 
Panama's development challenges and prospects. Key po in ts f r om these earlier discussions 
were already reflected in the CPS document. 

The methodology f o r fo rma l consultations in Panama C i t y (with over 70 participants) 
inc luded introductory remarks by the Bank Coun t ry D i rec to r and a PowerPoint presentation 
o f proposed CPS areas o f emphasis and a l is t ing o f proposed lend ing and non-lending 
activities in support o f the Government's development plan: Visidn Es t ra tkg ica de D e s a r r o l l o 
Econdmico y de Emp leo H a c i a 2009. F o l l ow i n g the presentation, participants broke in to fou r 
smaller thematic groups based o n the m a i n areas o f Bank involvement: social development; 
ru ra l development; pub l ic sector modernization and governance; and competitiveness and 
investment climate. Each o f the fou r groups then reported back t o the plenary o n the r e s u l t s 
o f i t s discussions. Stakeholders p rov ided feedback on: (i) h o w the Bank has most e f fec t ive ly 
supported the Government and what approaches have wo rked l e s s well; (ii) methods that 
other organizations in Panama have used e f f e c t i v e l y that the Bank m i g h t consider; (iii) 
specific advice fo r the incom ing W o r l d Bank Resident Representative; and (iv) h o w they see 
the evo lu t ion o f the Bank's interactions with Panama as the national economy continues t o 
grow. This approach facilitated productive and f rank discussions with the various 
stakeholders. 

The f o l l ow i n g i s a summary o f views expressed by stakeholders du r ing the fo rma l 
consultations (views are aligned t o the p i l la rs o f the Government's Strategic Vision). The 
groups raised a number o f general concerns with respect t o p e r s i s t e n t h i g h pove r ty leve ls , 
weak ins t i tu t iona l capacity, pub l ic sector management, p rov is ion o f social se rv ices , ru ra l 
development, land p rope r ty r igh ts and the environment, competitiveness and the impact o f the 
f r e e trade agreement with the United States, as well as broader c i v i l society pa r t ic ipa t ion fo r 
consideration by the Government and the Bank's CPS team. Table 1 (below) summarizes the 
p r inc ipa l recommendations f r om this round o f consultations and h o w the CPS program i s 
responding. 

Pillar I - Reduce Poverty and Inequality 

Participants agreed that sustainable rura l development i s a central factor in reducing 
inequality in Panama. Participants acknowledged that r u r a l development requ i res a multi- 
sectoral approach. Key e lemen ts o f a multi-sectoral strategy should include land tenure, 
imp rov ing access t o basic services and markets, and increasing access t o credit by the poor. 

Annex 5 
Page 2 o f 4 

Ru ra l development plans should also strive t o promote and empower Panama's small-scale 
ru ra l producers t o compete in a pos t -FTA environment. Participants stated that much remains 
t o be done to imp rove conditions in ru ra l areas and welcomed the Bank's interventions in this 
area, while also encouraging stronger linkages among projects. 
Pillar I 1 - Promote Economic Growth and Employment 
Participants h igh l igh ted the importance o f p romo t ing broad-based economic growth and 
competitiveness as a way t o reduce pove r ty and promote employment. The i s s u e o f h o w t o 
rema in competitive (especially in l i g h t o f the impacts o f the Panama Canal expansion and the

transportation i s s u e s and innova t ion capacity were o f highest i n t e r e s t t o participants. I t was 
also recommended that b o t h Government and the Bank develop stronger mechanisms t o 
ensu re that the bene f i ts o f economic g row th reach the poor, pa r t icu la r ly indigenous 
populations in ru ra l areas. 
Pillars I11 and V - Reform Public Finances and Modernize the State 
Participants s t ressed the importance o f increasing Bank support fo r institution building t o 
strengthen the e f fec t iveness o f key pub l ic institutions. In addition, participants h igh l igh ted 
the importance o f supporting reforms and in i t ia t ives t o promote the establishment o f mo re 
mode rn and transparent pub l ic f inanc ia l management systems. 
Imp roved e f f ic iency and 
transparency in Government spending w o u l d a l l ow fo r better delivery o f social services and 
encourage an imp roved investment climate. Participants also recommended that the Bank 
p lay a greater ro le in strengthening the ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f the Government, thereby 
con t r ibu t ing t o a more e f f e c t i v e pub l ic sector. 

Participants indicated that, despite the Government's s u c c e s s f u l l y reducing the f isca l deficit, 
there rema in unresolved issues related t o the qua l i ty o f spending o n social services. In this 
context, participants emphasized the need to imp rove the p rov is ion o f se rv ices through a mo re 
e f f ic ien t system. 
Pillar I V - Develop Human Capital 
Participants consider soc ia l protection a p r i o r i t y item fo r investment - i t i s a c r i t ica l e lemen t 
in reducing pove r ty and o f fe r ing opportunity t o f u t u r e generations. 
Imp roved health and 
education (including b i l ingua l education) were also h igh l igh ted as important vehicles t o 
stimulate economic g row th and imp rove income distribution. 

Other Concerns 

Lastly, participants in the various groups h igh l igh ted their des i re t o make p ro jec t design and 
implementation procedures more i n c l u s i v e and participatory (particularly by inc lud ing 
women). In their view, such a s h i f t w o u l d enhance the link between development processes 
and their beneficiaries. 
In turn, a more inc lus ive p ro jec t culture w o u l d also r e s u l t in 
permanent and transparent mechanisms fo r mon i to r ing and ensuring accountability o f b o t h 
projects and pub l ic policies.

Representative groups o f Panamanians are in the midst o f a na t iona l dialogue (facilitated by 
UNDP ) t o agree o n a long-term strategy fo r development and pove r ty eradication. Central t o 
this strategy i s determining h o w best t o use the additional income that i s expected t o be 
generated by the expansion o f the Panama Canal after i t s comp le t ion in 2014. While the Bank 
i s no t a participant in this exercise, Bank s ta f f are f o l l ow i n g i t s course. B o x 1 (below) 
elaborates the process and the areas in which various focus groups a re focused. 

Box 1. Na t iona l Dialogue f o r Development 

O n August 16, 2006, President Torr i jos inaugurated the fo rum for a Na t iona l D ia logue for Development 
(ConcertacMn Nac iona lpa ra e l Desarro l lo) , aimed at designing a p lan that w i l l help transform Panama in to 
a more democratic, equal, and prosperous society, p r ima r i ly though the correct p r io r i t iza t ion o f the use o f the 
additional revenue generated b y expansion o f the Panama Canal. This dialogue (facilitated b y UNDP ) 
between the Government and a w ide range o f social organizations ( inc lud ing representatives f rom c i v i l 
society, business, academic institutions, po l i t ica l parties, indigenous organizations, women's and you th 
groups, as w e l l as sectoral government representatives) seeks to establish long-term strategic objectives and 
specific actions in key areas o f development. This forum was o r ig ina l ly organized around four thematic 
wo rk ing groups: (i) pover ty reduction and equality; (ii) economic g row th and competitiveness; (iii) 
education; and (iv) ins t i tu t iona l strengthening. I t was later agreed to expand the dialogue to include two new 
thematic wo rk ing groups: (v) health; and (vi) jus t ice and personal security. These six wo rk ing groups are 
expected to present their conclusions and suggested actions to President To r r i jos later this year. 

The following are the focal areas that each working group has designated: (i) Poverty reduction and 

equality: expansion, focalization and improved mon i tor ing and evaluation o f public social expenditure; 
strengthening o f social pro tec t ion programs that target vulnerable and indigenous groups; and development 
o f sustainable professional 
tra in ing that considers gender equality; (ii) Economic growth and 
competitiveness: guarantee f isca l and macroeconomic stability; expand environmentally sustainable 
infrastructure to support economic diversification; promote access to services and markets; support policies 
that help generate employment; stimulate public-private partnerships to de l iver basic services; and encourage 
technological innovation; (iii) Education: increase school coverage (both in terms o f enrollment as w e l l as 
years o f schooling); improve qua l i ty o f education b y strengthening curricula; improve teacher tra in ing and 
pedagogic methods; and expand mu l t icu l tura l and multiethnic education; (iv) Institutional strengthening: 
improve transparency and accountability in the prov is ion o f pub l ic services; improve access to in forma t ion 
and stimulate c iv i l society participation; professionalize the c i v i l service; and enhance inter-institutional 
coordination among pub l ic en t i t ies ; (v) Health: develop a mode l for the pub l ic health system inc lud ing 
management, financing, social participation, and M&E; (vi) justice and personal security: increase access 
to jus t ice ; re fo rm the j u d i c i a l system; and increase accountability and transparency.
