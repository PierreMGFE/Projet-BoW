Background. 
Mon teneg ro has made s ign i f ican t strides in the past year, b e c om i n g 
independent in June 2006, and i n i t i a l i n g a S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Agreement (SAA) with 
the Eu ropean Comm iss ion in Ma rch 2007. Recent gains have built o n a s o l i d reco rd o f t rans i t ion 
and r e f o rm ove r the past decade, and since the conc lus ion o f reg iona l con f l ic ts during the 1990s. 
Mon teneg ro has successfully l a i d the founda t ions for a ma rke t based economy, strengthened 
democratic ins t i tu t ions , and g radua l ly built capac i ty in p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion to cope w i th 
p o l i t i c a l and economic transformation. These e f fo r ts have res to red mac ro -econom ic stability, 
and encouraged a r a p i d increase in g row th , w h i c h i s n o w the strongest in the Wes te rn Ba lkans . 
Nonetheless, fu r the r r e f o rm e f fo r ts w i l l b e requ i red t o ensure tha t there i s a so f t - land ing t o the 
current econom ic boom, and t o con t inue t o m o v e t ow a r d full in teg ra t ion with Europe.

E U Accession. Even tua l membe rsh ip o f the EU i s Mon teneg ro ’s cen t ra l p r i o r i t y . T h e 
signing o f the S A A was the f i rs t f o rm a l s t e p in the accession process. Eu ropean F o r e i g n 
M in is te rs have reiterated that Mon teneg ro has a Eu ropean perspective, a l though the pace o f 
progress w i l l depend n o t o n l y o n Mon teneg ro ’s a b i l i t y t o ha rmon ize with Eu ropean standards but 
o n the EU ’ s absorptive capacity. Pa r t icu la r challenges f o r Mon teneg ro i d e n t i f i e d by the E C 
inc lude : (i) r e i n f o r c i n g democratic ins t i tu t ions , i n c l u d i n g adop t ing a Cons t i tu t ion in l i n e w i th 
European standards; (ii) comprehensive re fo rms t o ha rmon ize po l ic ies and leg is la t ion ; and (iii) 
strengthening l i m i t e d adm in is t ra t ive capac i ty t o imp lemen t lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk . 

iii. The World Bank Group has actively supported Montenegro’s transition since 2001. 
W h i l e Mon teneg ro j o i n e d the W o r l d B a n k G roup o n l y in January 2007, the Bank has h a d a 
discrete p r o g r am o f l e n d i n g and ana ly t ica l w o r k f o r Mon teneg ro f o r m o s t o f the p e r i o d since 
Serbia and Mon teneg ro became a membe r in 2001. T o t a l IDA credits c omm i t t e d t o Mon teneg ro 
during this p e r i o d amount t o almost S D R 6 0 m i l l i o n ( rough ly U S D 90 m i l l i o n ) . As w e l l as IDA 
support, the Bank G roup p r o v i d e d techn ica l assistance f r o m b o t h I F C and MIGA t o im p r o v e the 
business environment, while I F C continues t o h o l d f inanc ia l sector investments in Mon teneg ro . 
Bank G r o u p support, 
i n c l u d i n g b o t h f inanc ing and adv iso ry services, has assisted the 
Gove rnmen t t o undertake r e f o rm t o encourage s t rong p r iva te sector l e d g r ow t h (incomes ove r 
t h i s p e r i o d have almost doub led in U S D te rms t o j u s t ove r $3,900 in 2006). Bank support has 
also he lped the Au tho r i t ies t o streamline p u b l i c expenditure w h i l e m a i n t a i n i n g o r i m p r o v i n g 
service q u a l i t y in k e y sectors such as hea l th and education, and he lped t o ensure that some 
inroads have been made in reduc ing persistent pove r ty , a l though r e a l gains o n th is f ron t appear t o

Partnerships. T h e Bank G roup w i l l w o r k c lose ly in pa r tne rsh ip with the authorities and

p rog rams w i l l t a k e Eu ropean standards i n t o account. Spec i f ic r u r a l and reg iona l development 
investments w i l l also b e unde r taken in close coo rd ina t ion with the EC . T h e Bank i s also

Mon teneg ro . 

vii. Risks. The p rog ram i s designed t o m i t iga te r isks that c o u l d limit the effectiveness o f 
Bank in te rven t ions and impede achievement o f outcomes. R isks are p a r t i c u l a r l y associated with 
the scope f o r reg iona l ins tab i l i ty , the p o s s i b i l i t y o f Mon teneg ro suffering a “hard landing”, and 
the po ten t ia l for l im i t e d capac i ty t o adversely a f fec t p o r t f o l i o performance. S t rong p o l i t i c a l

presence in Mon teneg ro w i l l also support even stronger engagement in p o r t f o l i o management

conducted in l i n e with OSCE and other in te rna t iona l s t a n d a r d ~ ” ~ . Re fe rendum results we re 
w i d e l y accepted in te rna t iona l ly . 

4. A degree o f continuity in Government policy can be expected over the coming four year 
Parliamentary session. Mon teneg ro conducted Pa r l iamen ta ry and m u n i c i p a l elections 
(elections we re held in 14 ou t o f 2 1 mun ic ipa l i t ies ) in Oc tobe r 2006. At the na t iona l level, the 
gove rn ing and pro-independence c o a l i t i o n o f the Democ ra t ic P a r t y o f Socialists (DPS) and the 
-Soc ia l Democ ra t ic P a r t y (SDP) w o n a m a j o r i t y o f 41 seats in the 81-seat Parliament. The same 
c o a l i t i o n w o n in 11 ou t o f the 14 mun ic ipa l i t ies at the l o c a l election. The other p a r t y ga in ing a 
s ign i f ican t numbe r o f Pa r l iamen ta ry seats in the elections was the econom ica l ly l i b e r a l 
Movemen t f o r Change (PZP). F o l l o w i n g elections, fo rme r P r im e M i n i s t e r D j u k a n o v i c stepped 
d o w n as P r im e M in is te r , and was rep laced by fo rme r M i n i s t e r o f Justice Sturanovic. The new 
Gove rnmen t has m o v e d t o streamline mach ine ry o f government arrangements. 

5 . The Government, with strong popular support, i s making progress toward European 
integration. M o n t e n e g r i n Prime M i n i s t e r Sturanovic i n i t i a l e d a S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion 
Agreement ( S A A ) in M a r c h 2007 with European Comm iss ione r f o r En la rgemen t Rehn. This i s 
the f i r s t f o rm a l step in the EU accession process. With this, Mon teneg ro has j o i n e d A l b a n i a in 
the S A A process and i s o n l y a step behind ne ighbo rs such as C roa t ia and FYR Macedonia, w h i c h 
have been granted cand idacy status. F o l l o w i n g Mon teneg ro ’s independence, the Aus t r ian EU 
Presidency re i te ra ted tha t Mon teneg ro ’s future, as w i th a l l the Wes te rn Ba lkans countries, i s 
within the EU, in l i n e with p r inc ip les l a i d d o w n by EU F o r e i g n M i n i s t e r s at the Thessa lon ik i 
Summ i t . Nevertheless, M i n i s t e r s also stressed in Sa lzbu rg in M a r c h 2006 that the Eu ropean 
perspective f o r a l l o f the countries in the r e g i o n needs t o b e considered in light o f the EU’s 
absorption capacity. Pa r t icu la r challenges f o r Mon teneg ro i d e n t i f i e d by the E C inc lude : (i) 
re in fo rc ing democratic ins t i tu t ions , i n c l u d i n g adop t ing a Cons t i tu t ion in l i n e with European 
standards; (ii) comprehensive re fo rms t o ha rmon ize po l ic ies and legislation; and (iii) 
strengthening limited adm in is t ra t ive capac i ty t o imp lemen t lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk . 

6. Montenegro became a member o f the World Bank Group on January 18, 2007, 
immediately following membership in the IMF. 

7. The Government recognizes that inclusion efforts w i l l be required. Desp i te the success 
o f the referendum, v o t i n g patterns suggest that the electorate i s t o some extent split across 
reg iona l lines. Many o f the p o p u l a t i o n identifying themselves as e thn ic Serbs, pa r t icu la r ly in the 
poo re r no r the rn r e g i o n o f t h e country, r em a i n skep t ica l o f the bene f i ts o f independence. T h e 
adop t ion o f a Cons t i tu t ion that g ives appropriate recogn i t ion t o m i n o r i t y r igh ts in l i n e with 
European standards w i l l b e impo r tan t t o ensure that the range o f m i n o r i t y groups in Mon teneg ro 
fee l inc luded in the n e w state. The Government anticipates that a Cons t i tu t ion w i l l b e in p lace in 
la te 2007, a l though the d r a f t i n g process has p r o v e n protracted, and the r a t i f i c a t i o n process has 
n o t yet been determined.

8 . Encouraging greater inclusion w i l l be especially important given risks o f regional 
instability. Nego t ia t ions o n Kosovo ’s status are, perhaps inev i tab ly , p r o v i n g highly sensitive. 
A l t h o u g h c l a r i t y o n this issue i s p o t e n t i a l l y impo r tan t f o r longe r - te rm reg iona l stability, the

and con f l ic ts during the 1990s and the ea r ly 2000s. But n o coun t ry in the r e g i o n i s likely t o be

B. Recent Economic Developments 

9 . Montenegro i s a small, open, middle-income economy. T o t a l GDP i s app rox ima te ly $2.4 
b i l l i o n . GDP p e r capita o f j u s t unde r $3,900 i s comparable t o o r h ighe r than other Wes te rn

Bu lga r ia . T h e economy i s open, w i th t o t a l trade m a k i n g up app rox ima te ly 130 percent o f GDP. 
Mon teneg ro i s in the process o f j o i n i n g t h e W o r l d Trade O rgan iza t ion (WTO), and has j o i n e d the

countries o f Sou th East Europe, and w h i c h guarantees f r e e trade f o r app rox ima te ly 90 percent o f 
indus t r ia l products. Re f lec t ing i t s sma l l size, the economy i s v e r y n a r r ow l y based. Services 
make up about 60 percent o f economic ac t iv i ty . A l t h o u g h o n l y m a k i n g up perhaps a quarter o f 
the services sector, tou r ism i s a key component o f the economy, and a m a j o r source f o r growth, 
especially a long the A d r i a t i c coast. Manu fac tu r ing , p a r t i c u l a r l y the a l um i n um industry, makes

1 1. S t rong economic pe r fo rmance has been unde rp inned by the res to ra t ion o f mac ro - 
economic stab i l ity . Reg iona l con f l ic ts during the 1990s c r ipp led the economy, and delayed the 
start o f the t rans i t ion process. Since 1997, however, Mon teneg ro has embarked o n an amb i t ious 
p rog ram o f mac ro -econom ic s tab i l iza t ion and ma rke t -o r ien ted s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms . A l t h o u g h the 
agenda rema ins incomplete, s ign i f ican t progress has been made. 

12. M o n e t a r y po l icy has been ancho red by the “Eu ro iza t ion” o f the economy. I n f l a t i o n has

13. The Government has pursued conservative f isca l policies, with the overall fiscal 
balance moving from a deficit o f 5 percent o f GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 3 percent o f GDP 
in 2006. The f isca l reso lve o f the Au tho r i t ies i s re f lec ted in the fact tha t such a surplus was 
achieved despite 
inev i tab le spending pressures during the re fe rendum and subsequent 
Pa r l iamen ta ry election. At a t im e w h e n Mon teneg ro i s in the midst o f a c y c l i c a l upswing, 
however, surpluses shou ld be expected. I t w i l l b e impo r tan t that f i s c a l d isc ip l ine i s maintained. 
E f f o r t s t o im p r o v e f isca l data and con t ro l f o r state ow n e d enterprises and mun ic ipa l i t ies w i l l b e 
required. Gove rnmen t e f fo r ts t o resolve res t i tu t ion c la ims in a f i s c a l l y sustainable fash ion w i l l 
also be c r i t i c a l t o ensure tha t f isca l d isc ip l ine can b e maintained. 

14. Despite prudent macro-economic policies, some signs a re emerging that the economy 
may be starting to overheat. Asset p r ices have soared. R e a l estate p r ices have increased 
dramatically, and p a r t i a l data suggests p r ices in tou r is t areas are already comparable t o those in 
Croatia. S im i la r ly , the ma rke t cap i ta l iza t ion o f b o t h M o n t e n e g r i n stock exchanges has jumped 
ex t reme ly r a p i d l y ove r the past f ew years. A f t e r weak g r ow t h in f o rm a l emp loymen t f o r several 
years, the unemp loymen t ra te dec l ined s ign i f ican t ly in 2006 f r o m about 19 percent t o about 14 
percent. Co r re la ted with the dec l ine in unemployment, r a p i d wage g r ow t h i s perhaps the clearest 
s ign that strains are increasing. Ac ross the economy, wages g r ew by 16 percent in 2006, and 
have c lea r ly ou ts t r ipped p r o d u c t i v i t y gains f o r several years. Wage g r ow t h i s mos t evident in the 
construction, t o u r i sm and energy sectors. Public sector wage res t ra in t has been lax, with raises 
close t o those across the economy as a w h o l e - a l though s t rong g r ow t h and some l a y o f f s have 
s t i l l ensured that the t o t a l p u b l i c sector wage b i l l has been reduced f r o m slightly ove r 13 percent 
o f GDP in 2003 t o about 11 percent o f GDP in 2006. 

15. The strong economic upswing i s especially evident in a widening current account 
deficit. Y e t w h i l e the cu r ren t account d e f i c i t reached a lmos t 2 9 percent o f GDP in 2006, th is 
shou ld n o t necessarily b e a cause f o r undue alarm. L a r g e cu r ren t de f ic i ts are n o t unusua l f o r 
small, open economies during b o o m periods. No tab ly , Mon teneg ro ’s current account i s fblly 
fhded, and appears l a r g e l y driven by fo re ign d i rec t inves tmen t equ iva len t t o ove r 34 percent o f 
GDP. V e r y high investment, pa r t icu la r ly in construction, has sucked in imports, w h i l e the 
wea l th effects o f rea l estate inves tmen t has encouraged high domestic demand. The E u r o i z a t i o n 
o f the economy also removes r i s k s o f a cu r rency crisis, a l though with the c o r o l l a r y that any sharp 
decline in f o r e i g n inves tmen t w i l l d i r e c t l y impac t o n g row th . 

C . Poverty 

16. Poverty in Montenegro appears limited, but remains a persistent problem. A n n u a l 
living standard measurement surveys (LSMS ) in Mon teneg ro be tween the p e r i o d 2002 and 2004 
suggest that be tween 9 and 12 percent o f the p o p u l a t i o n l i v e in p o v e r t y . F igu res suggest tha t

23. While a “soft landing” i s likely, continued prudent macro-economic policies and 
renewed structural reform efforts would help to reduce risks. T h e Gove rnmen t has made

with l o w taxes and m i n i m a l state interference. But the un f in ished r e f o r m agenda rema ins 
substantial. A “soft land ing ” scenario presumes a con t inued conso l ida t ion o f Gove rnmen t 
finances, and a b o l d p u s h o n s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms . 

B. Montenegro’s Long-term Vision and Policy Priorities 

24. The over-arching strategic goal f o r the new Government i s Euro-Atlantic integration, 
particularly greater integration with the European Union. Within this framework, the 
Government has i d e n t i f i e d three k e y p r io r i t ies5 : 
(i) enhancing sustainable econom ic growth, th rough inc reas ing economic freedoms and 
strengthening the r o l e o f the p r iva te sector; 
(ii) building ins t i tu t ions and the r u l e o f law; and 
(iii) im p r o v i n g the standard o f living o f citizens, th rough e f f ic ien t education, hea l th and 
soc ia l p ro tec t ion systems. 

25. Overall Government policy i s set out in the EU Stabilization and Association program 
and a new Economic Reform Agenda 2007-11, currently being prepared to replace the 
previous 2002-07 plan. A new Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) i s unde r development 
by the Ministry o f Hea l th , L a b o r and Soc ia l We l fa re t o support these broader plans, and a range

presents a c o n t i n u i n g challenge.

Enhanc ing Sustainable Economic G row th 

26. I n order to encourage growth, the Authorities intend to consolidate further the size of 
Government. T h e size o f the p u b l i c sector in Mon teneg ro has dec l ined f r o m 45 percent o f GDP 
in 2003, but s t i l l remains r e l a t i v e l y large, with expenditures j u s t u n d e r 42 percent o f G D P - 
a l though t h i s does n o t take i n t o account a large i n f o rm a l economy e s t im a t e d at app rox ima te ly 30 
percent o f GDP. T h e Au tho r i t ies have a stated comm i tmen t t o further r e d u c e the econom ic drag 
o f the p u b l i c sector, and t o reduce ove ra l l p u b l i c debt f r o m 40 percent to 3 0 percent o f GDP b y 
2012. 
In o rde r t o encourage inves tmen t and g row th , the G o v e r nm e n t reduced the personal 
i n c om e tax ra te in 2007 t o 15 percent, and i s r e v i ew i n g some labo r and o t h e r taxes. At the same 
time, the Gove rnmen t i s an t ic ipa t ing an increase in cap i ta l spending, p a r t i c u l a r l y to imp rove 
transport l i n k s and r o a d maintenance. Recu r ren t expenditures c u r r e n t l y m a k e up a very 
s ign i f ican t p o r t i o n o f t o t a l spending. 

27. Additional reductions in current outlays w i l l be required to meet Government policy 
priorities, while maintaining a prudent fiscal position. A f isca l s u r p l u s o f 3 percent, as 
ach ieved during 2006, appears b r o a d l y appropriate at this stage o f t h e economic cyc le . 
I f a 
p ruden t f isca l p o s i t i o n i s t o be ma in ta ined at the same t im e that other p o l i c y goals are me t , the 
Gove rnmen t w i l l need t o consider ca re fu l ly the scope f o r savings o n r e c u r r e n t expenditures. In 
pa r t icu la r , a l i d w i l l need t o b e k e p t o n p u b l i c sector wage g row th , w h i c h averaged 16 pe rcen t in 
2006, and w h i c h the Gove rnmen t i s an t ic ipa t ing c o u l d increase by a f u r t h e r 10 percent in 2007. 
U l t im a t e l y con t inued wage g r ow t h o f this magn i tude has the s t rong p o t e n t i a l t o put other policy 
goals at r isk . Res t ra in t o n .recurrent expenditures and wages w i l l also b e c ruc ia l t o a l l o w the

and t o strengthen capac i ty t o imp lemen t EU standards. 

28. Effective planning, landscape and watershed management, and environmental 
investments w i l l be key for the sustainable development o f the higher end tourism market. 
The Government, with support f r o m donors, i s m o v i n g t o ha rmon ize the L a w o n Env i ronmen t 
with EU standards and regulations. The Gove rnmen t i s also d e v e l o p i n g a Spa t ia l Plan for the

29 . Further privatization o f state-owned enterprises could help to improve economic 
performance, and provide an opportunity fo r the Government to raise further revenues to 
reduce debt. Mon teneg ro has made considerable strides in p r i v a t i z i n g state owned enterprises 
in recent years: the sale in 2005 o f Mon teneg ro telecom, the Aluminum plant (KAP), Podgo r icka 
B a n k a and a range o f o the r companies generated receipts o f app rox ima te ly Euro 200 m i l l i o n , and 
almost the same again in comm i tmen ts f o r fu r the r investment. R em a i n i n g companies include, 
inter a l ia , Mon teneg ro A i r l ines , res idua l f inanc ia l sector ho ld ings , Plantaze wines, shipyards and 
the Po r t o f Ba r . 

30. The Government recognizes that reform o f the energy sector i s the key remaining issue 
in terms o f reforming state-owned enterprises. Con t inued energy sector r e f o rm w i l l b e 
especially impo r tan t g i v e n the impo r tance o f th is sector in economic ac t iv i ty . Mon teneg ro 
cu r ren t ly impo r ts app rox ima te ly one third o f i t s p ow e r needs. T h e p ow e r supply s i tua t ion in 
Montenegro, as with m u c h o f the Wes te rn Ba lkans and Eu rope m o r e generally, i s an t ic ipa ted t o 
t igh ten s ign i f ican t ly . S ign i f ican t capac i ty add i t ions w i l l b e required, and are consistent with the 
least cost generation study supported by the W o r l d Bank and the EC, as w i l l generation and 
transmission investments. W h i l e e lec t r ic i ty demand i s g r ow i n g fast, p r o d u c t i o n i s hampered by 
o l d structures, l i m i t e d investment, and the running d o w n o f assets in the state-owned e lec t r ic i ty 
company, EPCG . E P C G has repo r ted annua l losses o f about 1 pe rcen t o f GDP since 2002. 
Pa r t ic ipa t ion in the Sou th East Eu rope reg iona l energy ma rke t o f fe rs considerable po ten t ia l f o r 
Mon teneg ro . This will, however, requ i re fu r the r market o r ien ted re fo rms ; i n c l u d i n g giving 
scope t o the independent regu la to r t o establish tariff p r ices that cove r costs and w h i c h m i n im i z e 
cross-subsidies be tween d i f fe ren t groups. In pa r t icu la r ly , ta r i f fs f o r res iden t ia l consumers and 
f o r the v e r y largest indus t r ia l consumers, such as the recen t ly p r i v a t i z e d a l um i n um plant KAP, 
w i l l need t o con t inue t o increase. In addition, requ i red t a r i f f increases w i l l also requ i re well- 
targeted and adequately funded o f fse t t ing soc ia l safety ne t p rog rams t o m i n i m i z e the impac t o n

EPCG, the p r i v a t i z a t i o n o f d i s t r i b u t i o n assets, and the further comme rc ia l iza t ion o r p r i v a t i z a t i o n

the p u b l i c and p r iva te sectors, w i l l b e needed t o reduce demand. 

31. Renewed efforts to improve labor market flexibility w i l l be needed to ensure 
Montenegro remains competitive. Desp i te re fo rms t o the L a b o r L a w in 2003, Mon teneg ro ’s 
labo r market remains characterized by excessive emp loymen t p ro tec t ion , a r e l a t i v e l y high tax 
wedge, and l o w wage f l e x i b i l i t y . R i g i d i t i e s resu l t f r o m the legacy o f the “self-management”

32. Perhaps inevitably given the relatively small size of the country, the capacity o f the 
public administration i s limited. The Gove rnmen t recognizes the need t o mode rn ize p u b l i c 
administration, and the recent conso l ida t ion o f m in is t r ies at the t im e the n ew Government came 
t o p ow e r in la te 2006 demonstrates a degree o f comm i tmen t . Fu r the r e f fo r ts t o strengthen the 
cen t ra l C i v i l Service A g e n c y and t o link p a y t o pe r fo rmance w i l l b e essential. The Gove rnmen t 
w i l l need t o focus p a r t i c u l a r l y o n strengthening the capac i ty o f p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions c r i t i c a l f o r the 
EU accession process, such as in te l lec tua l p rope r ty rights, standardization and accreditation, 
na t iona l statistics, bo rde r management and customs. Other k e y p r i o r i t i e s w i l l be: (i) t o im p r o v e 
the imp lemen ta t ion o f business regulations, p a r t i c u l a r l y at the m u n i c i p a l level, and; (ii) t o 
con t inue t o p u s h ahead with e f fo r ts t o im p r o v e ove ra l l governance, i n c l u d i n g p rocu remen t 
r e f o rm and, perhaps m o s t impo r tan t ly , management o f v e r y la rge pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships and 
concessions. 

33. There have been significant improvements in the business environment in Montenegro 
over the past few years, but more could be done. The Bank ’s D o i n g Business survey f o r 2006 
ind ica ted that Serbia and Mon teneg ro was one o f the top r e f o rm pe r fo rme rs durilig 2005: 
reduc ing business reg is t ra t ion f r o m 5 1 t o 15 days by m o v i n g reg is t ra t ion f o r business start-ups 
f r o m the courts t o a n ew adm in is t ra t ive registry; and h a l v i n g the t im e t o enforce a s imp le 
contract in the courts. T h e latest survey, f r o m 2007, w h i c h p rov ides Mon teneg ro spec i f ic data, 
suggests that the ease o f d o i n g business in Mon teneg ro compares favo rab ly with the Western 
Ba lkans region, but s t i l l fa l ls behind other countries in the w i d e r Ba lkans region, such as 
Romania, Bu lga r ia , and Slovenia. K e y rema in ing d i f f i c u l t i e s appear t o be primarily loca ted at 
the m u n i c i p a l level, and with the h n c t i o n i n g o f the j u d i c i a r y . In pa r t icu la r , l icens ing and p e rm i t 
requirements r em a i n comp lex (1 80 days t o build a warehouse), contract enforcement continues 
t o b e d i f f icu l t , despite imp rovemen ts (49 procedures and 18 months), and procedures f o r 
reg is te r ing p rope r ty are cumbersome (8 steps and 86 days). 

34. Plans by the authorities to explore the scope fo r significant public-private partnerships, 
particularly concessions to construct and operate major highway investments offer 
opportunities, but also present serious governance risks. Limited in f ras t ruc tu re i s a 
constraint t o deve lopmen t in Mon teneg ro . Pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships (PPPs) p r o v i d e s ign i f ican t 
oppo r tun i t ies t o encourage m a j o r investment, and t o strengthen in f ras t ruc tu re th roughou t the 
country. Pursued appropriately, PPP and concessions can bring r e a l benefits, and are t o be 
encouraged. At the same time, however, PPPs need t o b e pu rsued within a compe t i t ive and 
transparent f ramewo rk in w h i c h i n d i v i d u a l investments are app rop r ia te ly p r io r i t ized . Although 
the Au tho r i t ies are cons ide r ing op t ions to strengthen the cu r ren t leg is la t ive f ramewo rk f o r 
concessions, any n e w Concessions L a w w i l l need t o b e r i g o r o u s l y exam ined t o ensure tha t i t i s 
consistent with such f imdamen ta l p r inc ip les . 
Independent, extensive and r igo rous feas ib i l i ty 
studies w i l l also b e requ i red t o ensure that investments are viable, and tha t the Gove rnmen t does 
n o t wind up h o l d i n g s ign i f ican t con t ingen t l i a b i l i t i e s - or, at least, that such l i a b i l i t i e s are 
quantified in advance and re f lec ted within the ove ra l l budge t f ramewo rk and p r io r i t ies . T h i s i s 
especially c r i t i c a l g i v e n the very large size o f some the inves tmen ts being considered: 
p r e l im i n a r y estimates, f o r instance, suggest that the t o t a l inves tmen t requ i red f o r an A d r i a t i c

35. Continued implementation of financial sector reforms, as suggested by the joint World 
Bank-IMF financial sector assessment program (FSAP) w i l l be important. The Cen t ra l 
Bank o f Mon teneg ro has prepared an ac t ion plan focused o n strengthening supervision, similar t o 
the approach adopted in addressing in te rna l c o n t r o l issues i d e n t i f i e d by the p rev ious 2005

37 . The E U accession process provides significant opportunities f o r rural and regional

require institutional investments and regulatory adjustments. The EU accession process has

minimizing the number o f people in poverty in Montenegro. Estimates suggest tha t p o v e r t y

I V . WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR MONTENEGRO 

A. Past Bank Assistance and Quality and Management o f the Current Portfolio 

41. Montenegro became a member of the World Bank Group on January 18, 2007, 
immediately following membership in the IMF. Mon teneg ro became the 185th membe r o f 
IBRD, the 166th membe r o f IDA, the 179th membe r o f I F C and the 170th membe r o f MIGA. 
Mon teneg ro has n o t at th is stage dec ided t o j o i n IC S ID . With the endorsement o f the Board, 
Bank G roup ac t iv i t ies con t inued in Mon teneg ro during the i n t e r im p e e o d be tween independence 
and membership, a l though n o n ew loans o r g r a n t s we re c omm i t t e d f o r Mon teneg ro during this 
pe r iod . 

42. While Montenegro’s independence i s recent, the Bank has since 2002 identified discrete 
operations and a separate program of analytical and advisory work f o r Montenegro, within 
the framework of the overall Serbia and Montenegro program. In total, $42 m i l l i o n in IDA 
credits w i l l b e p r o v i d e d f o r Mon teneg ro ove r the p e r i o d f r o m F Y 0 5 t o FY 0 7 , b road ly in l i n e with 
the base case f inanc ing scenario set ou t in the last CAS7 . T h i s i n c l u d e d a development p o l i c y

i n c l u d i n g the energy sector, s o l i d waste management, and r e f o rm o f education, hea l th and 
pens ion services. O n the ana ly t ica l side, a separate Mon teneg ro Econom ic Memo randum and a 
separate Mon teneg ro P u b l i c Expend i tu re and I n s t i t u t i o n a l R e v i ew (PER) we re conducted, a long 
with a separate F i n a n c i a l Sector Assessment P rog ram (FSAP) and associated Repo r t o n

43. W o r l d Bank G roup support unde r the p rev ious C A S was able t o assist the M o n t e n e g r i n 
Government t o undertake re fo rms under three broad, inter-related, med ium - te rm goals: 
(i) 
Create a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector. The Gove rnmen t 
made g o o d progress in t h e area, with t o t a l p u b l i c expenditure f a l l i n g f r o m 47 percent 
o f GDP in 2003 t o 42 percent in 2006. T h e Bank ’s S A C 2 adjustment ope ra t ion 
supported Gove rnmen t e f fo r ts t o mode rn ize the c i v i l service, reduce hea l th and 
pens ion arrears, and strengthen the f inanc ia l p o s i t i o n o f the la rge state owned energy 
company (EPCG). T h i s was supported by spec i f ic energy, hea l th and pensions 

Despite income levels, Mon teneg ro has b e e n e l ig ib le f o r excep t iona l access t o IDA o n hardened te rms . W h i l e 
Mon tenegro became c red i two r thy f o r IBRD lend ing in FY 0 7 , the Governmen t has requested that IBRD f inanc ing 
opportunities iden t i f ied in the last CAS be r o l l e d over t o FY08 , in order n o t to exceed i t s s tr ic t b o r r ow i n g l i m i t s

and specific advice t o the Au tho r i t ies o n add i t iona l measures t o strengthen p u b l i c 
adm in is t ra t ion and reduce h e a v y recu r ren t costs. 
(ii) Create a larger, more dynamic private sector. G o o d progress was also achieved, 
with g r ow t h su rg ing during the C A S p e r i o d t o 6.5 percent in 2006. The Bank G roup 
was especially engaged in suppo r t ing the res t ruc tu r ing o f t h e f inanc ia l sector: S AC 2 
support f o r the p r i v a t i z a t i o n o f Podgo r icka Banka, the last m a j o r bank in p u b l i c 
hands, was comp lemen ted by I F C res t ruc tu r ing investments i n t o equ i ty in Podgo r icka 
B a n k a p r i o r t o p r iva t iza t ion , as w e l l as n e w investments t o encourage SME f inanc ing 
by Oppo r tun i ty Bank. A trade and transport f a c i l i t a t i o n p r o g r am f o r b o t h Serbia and 
Mon teneg ro h a d considerable success reduc ing customs processing t imes and costs. 
Env i ronmen ta l investments, pa r t icu la r ly in so ld waste, were also designed t o h e l p 
encourage tourism. A n a l y t i c a l and techn ica l assistance by IDA, I F C and MIGA also 
supported M o n t e n e g r i n e f fo r ts t o strengthen the Inves tmen t P r om o t i o n Agency , 
expand expo r t finance and insurance, and rev ise k e y leg is la t ion . 
(iii) Reduce poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public 
services. M o r e l im i t e d progress has been made in reduc ing pove r ty , with the p o v e r t y 
headcount be tween 2002 and 2004 r em a i n i n g f a i r l y constant be tween 10 and 12 
percent o f the popu la t ion . Nevertheless, recent strong g r ow t h and a s ign i f ican t 
reduc t ion in unemp loymen t suggest that fu r the r gains m a y have been made ove r the 
past year. Bank support th rough S A C 2, backed up by hea l th and pensions 
investments, as w e l l as a m o r e recen t educa t ion credit, 
i s helping further 
imp rovemen ts in soc ia l service de l ive ry . 

44. Capacity constraints have hampered the implementation of the World Bank program, 
but the portfolio i s now performing relatively strongly. A lm o s t a l l inves tmen t operations 
have run i n t o d i f f i c u l t i e s soon after beg inn ing , and the r e f o rm p r o g r am supported by S A C 2, 
w h i l e completed, was delayed. A j o i n t p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance r e v i ew in June 2006 suggested that 
three o f f o u r inves tmen t operations we re n o t p e r f o rm i n g at that time (a l though with the educa t ion 
p ro jec t p e r f o rm i n g strongly). The Gove rnmen t has undertaken s ign i f ican t e f fo r ts t o im p r o v e 
p o r t f o l i o performance, supported by strengthened supe rv is ion f r o m Bank teams. The p o r t f o l i o i s 
n o w p e r f o rm i n g well, with o n l y one ope ra t ion n o t satisfactory. P rob lems are s t i l l b e i n g 
experienced with the Mon teneg ro E n v i r o nm e n t a l l y Sustainable T o u r i sm Project, w h i c h has been 
designed t o help address the s ign i f ican t p r o b l em o f s o l i d waste in coastal mun ic ipa l i t ies . 
Squabb l ing be tween mun ic ipa l i t ies about the l o c a t i o n o f waste sites resu l ted in l a n d f i l l s n o t 
rece iv ing necessary pe rm i ts . The l a c k o f p r o p e r l y managed landfills i s l i k e l y t o increase the 
p rac t ice o f “wild dumps”, and c o u l d p o t e n t i a l l y hurt Mon teneg ro ’s a b i l i t y t o attract h i g h e r end

B. Lessons Learned from the CAS Completion Report 

45. The C A S C om p l e t i o n Repo r t (Annex 2) i d e n t i f i e d a numbe r o f lessons that fo rmed the basis 
o f this CPS. These lessons inc lude : 

The areas o f focus in the CAS were appropriate and the mix o f interventions 
supported the objectives well. Given t h e substantial progress Mon teneg ro has made 
and the con t r ibu t ions that the Bank p r o g r am made t o that progress, the in te rven t ions 
appear t o have app rop r ia te ly re f lec ted p r io r i t ies . A c t i v i t i e s a l l con t r ibu ted t o the 
desired outcomes. 

Bank support should increasingly focus on Montenegro’s integration with the EU, 
and assist in building the capacity of state institutions fo r better utilization o f IPA 
funds. With t h e i n i t i a l i n g o f a S A A , the support t o EU in teg ra t ion process m u s t take o n 
a sharper focus. A s l a c k o f capac i ty i s one o f the k e y constraints o f Montenegro, the 
Bank and o the r donors must ensure tha t capac i ty building i s a k e y element o f the 
fo r thcom ing strategy. 

Encouraging sustainable economic growth should be a key focus f o r future 
support. Mon teneg ro has successfully ma in ta ined mac ro -econom ic s tab i l i ty during the 
past f ew years. S t ruc tu ra l re fo rms and e f fo r ts t o m a i n t a i n and im p r o v e the env i ronmen t 
w i l l b e c r i t i c a l t o ensure that g r ow t h i s able t o continue. At the same time, future 
assistance w i l l also need t o p a y e x p l i c i t a t ten t ion t o e f fo r ts t o ensure that the bene f i ts 
f r o m g r ow t h have a w i d e impac t . 

Engagement across the Bank Group, while strong, could be strengthened even 
further. There i s scope f o r n ew I F C investments ove r t h e short t o medium t o exceed 
n ew IDMIBRD investments - especially as the Bank moves t o IBRD l e n d i n g and in an 
env i ronmen t whe re the Gove rnmen t i s seeking t o reduce o v e r a l l p u b l i c debt. There i s 
considerable scope t o ensure synergies in the. p r o v i s i o n o f techn ica l assistance, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the transport, t o u r i sm infrastructure, and e lec t r ic i ty sectors. 

The Bank’s knowledge and expertise must be integrated fully into future 
assistance. The Bank’s compa ra t ive advantage in Mon teneg ro i s o f f e r i n g bund led 
lend ing and f inanc ia l products. Bank expertise, a long w i th financing, can b e especially 
u s e h l t o assist Mon teneg ro g i v e n capac i ty constraints. Support in c r i t i c a l sectors, such 
as tou r ism planning, energy re fo rm , im p r o v i n g the business environment, s t ream l in ing 
and im p r o v i n g soc ia l service de l ive ry , and app rop r ia te ly manag ing m a j o r PPPs/ 
concessions w i l l requ i re adv ice as w e l l as f inanc ing . Similarly, Bank adv ice w i l l also 
b e c ruc ia l t o support any IMF program, w h i c h i s l i k e l y t o have a s t rong s t ruc tu ra l 
element. 

Donor coordination has to be intensified. G i v e n the s t rong need t o focus the 
assistance f o r Mon teneg ro , the Bank needs t o put m o r e emphasis on dono r 
coordination. Stronger coo rd ina t ion with the EU c o u l d espec ia l ly h e l p t o in teg ra te B a n k 
investments with the considerable E C f h d i n g f o r techn ica l assistance. Coo rd ina t ion

with other m a j o r financiers, i n c l u d i n g the IMF, EBRD, and EIB w i l l also b e crucial, as 
w i l l even stronger engagement with s ign i f ican t b i la te ra l donors. 

(vii) The next CPS needs to be realistic about implementation capacity. L e n d i n g 
p repa ra t ion c o u l d b e assisted by unde r tak ing appropriate analysis t o ensure owne rsh ip 
and gauge comm i tmen t be fo re deve lop ing operations, and with greater a t ten t ion t o the 
readiness f o r imp lemen ta t ion o f the projects. At the same time, however, the Bank 
shou ld n o t l o o k o n l y at “easy” activities: shareholders and o the r donors are l o o k i n g f o r 
t h e Bank t o engage o n m o r e comp lex and sensitive issues, whe re the ins t i tu t ion ’s 
a b i l i t y t o bund le know ledge and l e n d i n g services p rov ides a compa ra t ive advantage. 

C. Montenegro’s Country Financing Parameters 

46. Separate country financing parameters fo r Montenegro were established in M a y 2007 
(see A n n e x 6)’. C o u n t r y f inanc ing parameters (CFPs) h a d p r e v i o u s l y been established f o r Serbia 
and Mon teneg ro in Ma rch , 2005. A s with CFPs f o r o the r r e g i o n a l countries, the CFPs f o r 
Mon teneg ro p r o v i d e f o r added f l e x i b i l i t y in a l l ow Bank f inanc ing o f up t o 100 percent o f p ro jec t 
costs, a l though the ac tua l l e v e l o f Bank f inanc ing w i l l b e de te rm ined o n a case by case basis and 
the Bank w i l l s t i l l in m o s t cases encourage cost sharing as a demons t ra t ion o f coun t ry ownership. 
The CFPs also a l l ow f o r recurrent cost f inanc ing o n a selective basis, and Bank f inanc ing o f 
l o c a l and fo re ign costs in any p ropo r t ion . The CFPs have g rea t ly fac i l i ta ted Bank operations, 
and reduced the transaction costs o f im p l em e n t i n g Bank - f inanced operations by reduc ing 
comp lex i ty . The add i t iona l f l e x i b i l i t y p r o v i d e d w i l l support p ro jec t implementation, and i s f i l l y 
consistent w i th the approach o f t h e CPS in emphas iz ing Gove rnmen t owne rsh ip o f u n d e r l y i n g 
p ro jec t objectives. The m a x i m u m f l e x i b i l i t y a l lowed by the CFPs, however, w i l l b e app l ied 
selectively, and with due rega rd t o sus ta inab i l i ty issues and f i d u c i a r y oversight.

(iii) im p r o v i n g the standard o f living o f citizens, th rough e f f ic ien t education, hea l th and 
soc ia l p ro tec t ion systems. 

50. World Bank Group support w i l l be coordinated, integrated, and increasingly focused 
on key challenges. W h i l e investments and ana ly t ica l w o r k are structured a round the three k e y 
p r io r i t ies ou t l ined above, Bank G roup p rog rams w i l l be m u t u a l l y

B. The Financing Framework: Scenarios, Creditworthiness and Terms 

69. Montenegro’s financing needs a re limited, although the Bank’s ability to bundle 
knowledge and lending products provides an opportunity fo r the institution to add value. 
T h i s will, however, require that the Bank rema ins highly responsive t o Mon teneg ro Gove rnmen t 
p r io r i t ies - w h i l e also o f f e r i n g im p a r t i a l and robus t advice where necessary. A d v i s o r y services 
w i l l need t o b e o f high q u a l i t y t o mee t the needs o f a sm a l l but inc reas ing ly sophisticated c l ien t . 

70. The CPS suggests a base case financing program o f $19 million in IDA and $50 million 
in IBRD over the four year period. IDA f inanc ing w i l l be l i m i t e d t o FY07, and re f lec ts 
uncomm i t ted IDA funds rema in ing f r o m the t o t a l IDA a l loca t ion o f $ 4 2m i l l i o n f o r Mon teneg ro

Au tho r i t ies in o rde r t o fit within the i r ow n b o r r ow i n g limits. 

71. Higher lending support could potentially be offered, although this w i l l depend on the 
continuation o f the Government’s reform program. An add i t iona l $20 m i l l i o n as the uppe r

Development Policy Lending 

73. Given the Government’s strong fiscal position, development policy lending i s not 
expected in the current CPS. Nevertheless, there w o u l d b e scope t o in t roduce development 
p o l i c y loans, within the ove ra l l f inanc ing l i m i t s set out, in the event that exogenous factors l e d t o 
Mon teneg ro requiring fast d isbu rs ing lending, and p r o v i d e d that the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
ove ra l l r e f o rm agenda rema ined appropriate t o justify such support. P r im e respons ib i l i ty f o r 
assisting the Gove rnmen t in respond ing t o any po ten t ia l mac ro -econom ic shock w i l l rest with the 
IMF, a l though Bank assistance could, i f required, supplement support f r o m the Fund. 

i i . Creditworthiness and Lending Terms 

74. Montenegro has received exceptional access to IDA lending, on hardened terms, since 
Bank programs resumed to the former Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia (subsequently 
Serbia and Montenegro) in 2001. Excep t iona l access t o IDA was granted, despite incomes 
w e l l above the usua l threshold, as c red i two r th iness considerations did n o t at that stage p r o v i d e 
scope f o r BRD lend ing . 

75. Strong recent growth and reform performance, together with Paris Club and 
associated debt rescheduling, has significantly improved Montenegro’s creditworthiness 
position - although risks remain. Mon teneg ro ’s long - te rm c red i t r a t i n g was upg raded in 
M a r c h 2007 by Standard & Poors t o BB+. Mon teneg ro ’s p u b l i c debt, at about 40 percent o f 
GDP, i s l o w and dec l in ing . Nevertheless, unce r ta in ty rema ins regarding the debt o f p u b l i c 
enterprises, w h i c h c o u l d become l i a b i l i t i e s f o r the Government. 
In addition, w h i l e the 
Gove rnmen t i s c omm i t t e d t o a sensible strategy t o limit res t i tu t ion c la ims w h i l e p r o v i d i n g 
compensation f o r exp rop r ia ted property, f isca l r isks persist. 
IMF estimates suggest that the 
p lanned package c o u l d increase debt stocks by as m u c h as 10 percent o f GDP, at an annual cost 
o f perhaps 0.5 percent o f GDP. A fa i lu re t o imp lemen t t h e p lanned package c o u l d p o t e n t i a l l y 
increase costs v e r y s ign i f ican t ly - t o as m u c h as 50 percent o f GDP. Since debt res t ruc tu r ing by

Pa r is C l u b and b i l a t e r a l creditors in 2003, and a further debt w r i t e - o f f by Paris C l u b c red i to rs in 
2006, Mon teneg ro ’s ex te rna l p u b l i c debt has f a l l e n t o about 27 percent o f GDP. IMF baseline 
scenarios suggest that Mon teneg ro ’s t o t a l ex te rna l debt and ove ra l l p u b l i c debt t o GDP ra t ios 
w i l l b o t h con t inue t o decline t o b e l ow 3 0 percent o f GDP ove r the n e x t five years t o 2012. 
Standard stress tests also suggest a continued, a l though slower, dec l ine in p u b l i c debt levels. 
Stress tests d o u b l i n g the shocks, and add ing 2 0 percent t o debt stocks t o re f lec t the effects o f 
poss ib le con t ingen t l i a b i l i t i e s and restitution, suggest that debt dynam ics in this case w o u l d b e

76. Despite Montenegro’s reasonable ove ra l l public debt position, liabilities to the World 
Bank a re very large. Associated with i t s membership o f the Bank Group, f o r instance, 
Mon teneg ro assumed respons ib i l i t ies f o r IBRD loans t o t a l i n g E u r o 2 7 0 m i l l i o n that h a d been 
p r o v i d e d t o the fo rme r Socialist Fede ra l Repub l ic o f Yugos lav ia p r i o r t o the outbreak o f reg iona l 
con f l ic ts in the 1990s. 
In addition, Mon teneg ro assumed l i a b i l i t i e s f o r IDA comm i tmen ts 
to ta l ing SDR 59 m i l l i o n (not a l l o f w h i c h has been fully disbursed). T h e t r ipa r t i te agreement 
signed by the Governments o f Mon teneg ro and Serbia, as w e l l as the Bank, regarding 
Montenegro’s assumption o f t h i s debt i s cu r ren t ly be fo re t h e M o n t e n e g r i n Parliament. Given the 
impo r tance o f absolute c l a r i t y o n Mon teneg ro ’s debt p o s i t i o n in determining creditworthiness, n o 
n ew IBRD l e n d i n g t o Mon teneg ro w i l l b e able t o b e comm i t ted until Pa r l iamen t has r a t i f i e d this 
agreement and i t becomes e f fec t ive . On a pe r cap i ta basis, the Bank ’s exposure t o Mon teneg ro i s 
among the highest in the wo r ld . W o r l d Bank l iab i l i t ies a re equ iva len t t o j u s t under 4 0 percent o f 
Montenegro’s t o t a l p u b l i c debt, and about h a l f o f Mon teneg ro ’s ex te rna l p u b l i c debt. The 
Mon teneg r in Gove rnmen t i s cons ide r ing p re -pay ing a l i m i t e d amount o f inhe r i ted IBRD debt in 
FY 0 8 . The Gove rnmen t m a y also decide t o make add i t iona l pre-payments depending o n 
revenues that m a y b e achieved f r o m con t inued p r iva t iza t ion . 

77. Anticipated reductions in external public debt a re likely to be offset by further 
increases in private external debt. D a t a o n p r iva te ex te rna l debt i s weak, a l though estimates 
by the Au tho r i t ies and the IMF suggest that p r iva te external debt j u m p e d f r o m about 16 percent 
o f GDP in 2005 t o 2 2 percent in 2006. Some o f this, however, m a y re f lec t h i d d e n FDI, with debt 
la te r converted t o equity. W h i l e p u b l i c sector external debt continues t o decline, the increase in 
p r iva te sector l i a b i l i t i e s has resu l ted in Mon teneg ro ’s ove ra l l ex te rna l debt inc reas ing fi-om just 
ove r 40 percent o f GDP in 2003 t o 49 percent o f GD P in 2006. 

C. Partnerships and Participation 

78. Preparation o f the CPS was undertaken following consultations with a wide range o f 
stakeholders (Annex 3). The CPS has been prepared in consu l ta t ion with the Au tho r i t ies , and 
re f lec ts the p o l i c y p r io r i t ies o f the Government. A wo rkshop was h e l d t o discuss the proposed 
strategy with a w i d e range o f c i v i l soc ie ty stakeholders in Podgo r ica in April 2007. 

79. The EU accession process plays a central r o l e in defining Montenegro’s development 
agenda. The Bank enjoys a close re la t ionsh ip with the E C in Brussels, as w e l l as with the 
European A g e n c y f o r Reconstruction, w h i c h cu r ren t ly manages E C assistance in Mon teneg ro . 
T h i s CPS was p repa red in con junc t ion with the EC ’s M e d i um - T e rm Inves tmen t Plan fo r 
Mon teneg ro . A c t i v i t i e s are c lose ly designed t o support the accession p rog ram . T h e Bank and 
the E C in i t ia ted annual “coun t ry day ” discussions o n Montenegro, focus ing o n coo rd ina t ion o f 
ove ra l l strategic directions. T h e inaugu ra l discussion in April 2007 focused especially o n 
coo rd ina t ion in the k e y areas o f agriculture, r u r a l and reg iona l development, and energy. 

80. Close coordination with the IMF will be especially critical. The p roposed IMF 
precautionary S B A i s l i k e l y t o have a s ign i f ican t s t ruc tu ra l element. In the absence o f W o r l d 
Bank development p o l i c y lending, the p roposed p rog ram p rov ides an o p p o r t u n i t y f o r the Bank t o

especially c lose ly w i th the IMF o n labo r ma rke t r e f o rm issues, as w e l l as energy and pens ion 
issues. 

81. Coordination and harmonization with other donor partners i s an integral element in 
both designing and implementing the CPS. Key m u l t i l a t e r a l ins t i tu t ions and donors in 
Mon teneg ro include, inter a l i a , the EC, EIB, EBRD and UN, as w e l l as the German and U S 
Governments. A d v i c e o f other donors was ac t ive ly sought, the CPS ou t l ine was shared with 
donors in April 2007, and the strategy incorporates an analysis o f o the r dono r ac t iv i t ies in 
des ign ing the spec i f ic in te rven t ions f o r po ten t ia l B a n k support. The scope t o leverage techn ica l 
and f inanc ia l resources p r o v i d e d by other dono r partners, o f t e n o n a concessional basis, i s 
crucial. In l i n e with p r inc ip les under the Paris agenda o n a i d effectiveness, the Gove rnmen t i s 
taking an inc reas ing ly ac t ive r o l e in a i d coordination, o rgan ized th rough the Secretariat f o r EU

84. R i s k s o f a “Hard-Landing”. W h i l e a so f t - land ing f r o m the current economic b o o m seems

85 . Continued economic exuberance reducing reform commitment. The current economic

86. Capacity constraints and portfolio performance. Capac i ty constraints, pa r t icu la r ly g iven

IX. Introduction 

1. This C A S Comp le t ion Repor t evaluates the impac t and effectiveness o f the W o r l d Bank ’s Coun try 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Serbia and Mon tenegro discussed by the Boa rd o f D i rec to rs in November 
2004 (hereafter re ferred to as CASOS). Given Montenegro’s independence and subsequent membership 
t o the W o r l d Bank, the Bank w i l l prepare a n ew C A S fo r Mon tenegro cover ing F Y 0 7 - F Y 10 in 2007. 

2. This C A S Comp le t ion Repor t w i l l therefore evaluate the r e s u l t s f r om the prev ious Serbia and 
Mon tenegro C A S that correspond to Mon tenegro alone. This i s feasible since the ma jo r i ty o f the lending 
p rog ram in CAS05 was designed separately fo r Mon tenegro and Serbia, with the exception o f two 
operations (a reg iona l trade and transport p ro jec t (TTFSE) and an export finance p ro jec t (SMECA)) . 

3. W h i l e the CAS05 was n o t prepared using a Results-Based methodology, this repo r t attempts to 
re t ro f i t a results-based. The re t ro f i t ted CAS05 Resu l ts M a t r i x has been prepared as i f i t had been done 
when the C A S was o r ig ina l ly prepared in F Y 0 5 . 

X. Country Context 

A. Po l it ica l Developments 

4. Mon tenegro proc la imed independence f r om the U n i o n o f Serbia and Mon tenegro (S aM ) on June 3, 
2006 after independence. F o l l ow i n g independence, Serbia was declared the successor state to SaM and 
succeeded t o the membership in the UN, the IMF, the W o r l d Bank and other in terna t iona l ins t i tu t ions . 
Mon tenegro became a n ew member o f the W o r l d Bank and the IMF in January 2007. 

5 . A degree o f p o l i c y con t inu i ty i s expected. In the short pe r iod since independence, Mon tenegro 
carr ied ou t parliamentary and mun ic ipa l elections (elections were held in 14 ou t o f 2 1 mun ic ipa l i t ies) . At 
the na t iona l leve l , the govern ing and pro-independence coa l i t ion o f the Democra t ic Pa r ty o f Socialists 
(DPS) and the Social Democra t ic Par ty (SDP) l e d by then Prime M in is te r D jukanov ic w o n a ma jo r i ty o f 
4 1 seats in the 81-seats Parliament. T h e same coa l i t ion w o n in 11 out o f the 14 mun ic ipa l i t ies at the loca l 
election. A f t e r the elections, Mr. D jukanov ic stepped down as Pr ime M in is te r , and was replaced by 
former M in is te r o f Justice Sturanovic. The new Government appointed in Novembe r 2006 streamlined 
the structure o f government, reduc ing the number o f Deputy P r ime M i n i s t e r s to two (responsible for 
Econom ic Development and European In teg ra t ion respectively) and the number o f M i n i s t r i e s f r om 15 to 
13. These changes gave some ear ly ind ica t ion o f the Government’s comm i tmen t to con t inue with pub l ic 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms.

6. Advanc ing European in tegra t ion i s a key p o l i c y p r i o r i t y fo r the Government, as emphasized during 
the referendum and the subsequent e lec t ion campaign. U l t ima te accession to the EU i s an ove r r id ing 
p o l i c y goal, en joy ing b road public support. 
In i t s declaration o f independence the Mon teneg r in 
Parliament ' I . . .con f i rmed as i t s strategic p r i o r i t y an accelerated in tegra t ion in to the European Un ion , and 
i s determined to continue to e f f ic ien t ly fulfill the cond i t ions and requirements inc luded in the 
S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Process". F o l l ow i n g strong progress in techn ica l discussions, Mon tenegro 
in i t ia led a S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Arrangement ( S A A ) with European Commissioner Rehn in 
March , 2007. 

B. Economic Developments 

7. Fo r near ly a decade f o l l ow i n g the breakup o f the former Socialist Federal Repub l ic o f Yugoslavia, 
reg iona l con f l ic ts and in terna t iona l iso la t ion c r ipp led the economy and delayed the start o f the trans i t ion 
t o a marke t economy. Since 1997, however, Montenegro, with the support o f the in terna t iona l 
commun i ty , has been engaged in a l o n g s e r i e s o f macroeconomic stabilization, and market-oriented 
structural reforms. 

8. The authorities began implementing a p rog ram o f macroeconomic s tab i l iza t ion in the late 1990s, 
anchored in the adop t ion o f the Deutsche M a r k (and then the Euro) as sole lega l tender. As a result, 
in f la t ion has been reduced f r om 25 percent at the end o f 2000 to about 2.1 percent in 2006. 

9. F isca l retrenchment, supported by an IMF program, he lped trans form sizeable f isca l de f ic i ts (about 8 
percent o f GD P in 2000) to a surplus o f 3 percent o f GD P in 2006. The f isca l conso l ida t ion i s 
approx ima te ly equa l ly split between expenditure reduc ing and revenue increasing measures and pa r t ly 
r e f l e c t s the economic cycle. The in t roduc t ion o f VAT in 2003 has supported a re la t ive ly high revenue-to- 
GDP ra t io while reductions in transfers and interest payments helped lowe r public expenditures. Go ing 
forward, fur ther cuts in the wage bill, transfers to households and pub l ic enterprises, and interest 
payments are needed to reduce aggregate demand pressures . Such cuts w i l l also create the f isca l r o om fo r 
increased pub l ic investment, e f for ts to s treng then capacity in EU re la ted areas, and to ensu re that the 
Government has the capacity to respond t o increased f inanc ing demands (such as fo r restitution), as well 
as to ma in ta in prudent f isca l po l ic ies through the economic cycle. 

10. In pa ra l le l with the currency and f isca l po l icy reforms, the Government has also imp lemen ted a range 
o f structural reforms, inc lud ing p r ice and trade l ibera l iza t ion , pr iva t iza t ion , public adm in is tra t ion re form , 
f inanc ia l sector reform, pens ion re form , and labor marke t and business environment reforms, w h i c h have 
supported modest economic g row th and transition. T h e s e e f for ts were supported by the f i r s t S truc tura l 
Adjustment C red i t (SAC l ) . The S A C l was in l i n e with the Bank's Trans i t iona l Support Strategy ( fo r 
Serbia and Montenegro) prepared in June 2001 and updated in August 2002 and February 2004. The 
S A C l focused o n re forms t o enhance f isca l sustainability and help create cond i t ions fo r pr iva te sector-led 
g row th through re forms o f pub l ic expenditure management, pensions, the energy sector, labor markets 
and the bus iness environment. The SAC2 sharpened the focus o f B a n k support in t h e f i r s t th ree o f these 
areas, while inc lud ing support fo r re forms in the f inanc ia l sector and the public administration. The 
Government i s in the process o f upda t ing i t s 2007-2010 Econom ic R e f o rm Program, t o guide the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the rema in ing structural reforms. The new strategy i s expected t o be completed by 
mid 2007. 

11. Par t ly as a r e s u l t o f reforms, recent macroeconomic developments have b e e n highly favorable. 
F o l l ow i n g sluggish g row th rates in the ear ly 2000's, the Mon teneg r in economy g rew by an average o f 
around 5 pe rcen t over 2004-2006 with g row th accelerating to 6.5 percent in 2006. I t s p r inc ipa l human 
welfare indicators such as pover ty , l i f e expectancy, and adu l t l i teracy have rema ined moderate and stable, 

40 

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10 

Annex 2 

with a recent reduc t ion in unemployment f r om a s tab i le leve l o f 19 percent in the past f e w years t o 14 
percent in 2006. 

12. The recorded current account de f ic i t (before grants) remains one area o f concern, a l though this needs 
to be viewed in the context o f very high fore ign d irec t inves tmen t . Though declining f r om about 20 
percent o f GD P in 2002 to slightly be low 10 percent in 2005, the current account de f ic i t appears to have 
again w idened s ign i f ican t ly in 2006 to around 28 percent o f GDP.15 Montenegro’s merchandise exports 
are no t d ive rs i f ied and rema in large ly dominated by the expor t o f aluminum, which accounts fo r over 50 
pe rcen t o f merchandise exports. Impo r ts increased t o around 66 percent o f GD P in 2006 d r iven by strong 
FD I but also boom ing domestic consumption. Nevertheless, u n l i k e mos t other countries in the region, 
Montenegro’s current account de f ic i t has b e e n fully funded, and in large pa r t driven by, FDI - w h i c h in 
2006 was equivalent to 34 pe rcen t o f GDP. W h i l e i t i s n o t unusual fo r sma l l trans i t ion countries such as 
Mon tenegro to run a high cu r ren t account de f ic i t to fac i l i ta te capital replacement, there i s a need fo r 
Mon tenegro to adjust over time to a lowe r c u r r e n t account de f ic i t , especially in v i ew o f a con t inu ing shift 
to non-concessional loan f inanc ing f r om donors. With regard to debt, Montenegro’s to ta l pub l ic debt 
l e v e l s imp roved considerably over the last few years due to large debt r e l i e f and l im i t e d new debt 
issuance . As a result, pub l ic debt levels have fa l len to around 40 percent o f GDP, with fore ign debt 
accounting fo r about two- th irds o f the total. Standard & Poor ’s recen t ly upgraded Mon tenegro ’s cred i t 
ra t ing to BB+. 

13. L o o k i n g ahead, Mon tenegro faces the challenge o f ma in ta in ing g row th within the framework o f 
“euroization”. The l ike l ihood o f a “soft land ing” f o l l ow i n g very s ign i f ican t current i n f l ow s w i l l depend in 
large pa r t on con t inu ing structural re form . Inadequate s truc tura l f l e x i b i l i t y in the economy, inc lud ing in 
labor market, business environment, and in fras truc ture m a y limit further g row th and reductions in 
unemployment and pover ty . Further structural re forms focused o n these areas w i l l therefore be c ruc ia l t o 
speeding up g row th and reduc ing unemployment, while further enhancing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty 
through a tighter and sustainable f isca l po l icy . The Bank programs w i l l continue to support these goals. 

14. Risks persist. The coun try has benefited f r om strong g loba l metals prices, pa r t icu la r ly a lum inum . 
Montenegro’s heavy reliance o n tou r ism (a highly compe t i t ive industry in terna t iona l ly) as a source o f 
g row th makes the coun try vulnerable to sudden shocks tha t cou ld easily downgrade the med ium - te rm 
g row th prospects and worsen f isca l sustainability. On the other hand, even i f tou r ism continues t o 
develop, the strong d i f f e r e n c e in the development o f the n o r t h and south cou ld pose fur ther challenges to 
the ins t i tu t ions to balance the development. In addition, there are s i g n s that strong cap i ta l i n f l ow s are 
nega t ive ly a f fec t ing the economy’s competitiveness; wage g row th exceeds p roduc t iv i ty gains and rea l 
estate pr ices have increased dramatically. In the absence o f an exchange rate mechanism to adjust fo r 
these imbalances, fbrther structural re forms are c ruc ia l in order to ensure that the economy has o f the 
necessa ry f l e x i b i l i t y to be able t o respond to shocks and also create conditions fo r diversifying the sources 
o f grow th . Rap id credit expansion in recent years - a l though fully funded f r om domestic deposit g r ow t h - 
as w e l l as the need to imp rove security o f energy supply, pose r i s k s that w i l l requ ire the con t inued 
attention o f the authorities. 

XI. Montenegrin Government Priorities 

15. The p o l i c y p rog ram o f Montenegro’s Government i s built on two complementary strategies: the 
European U n i o n S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Process ( S A P ) and the Econom ic R e f o rm Agenda 2002- 
2007, o f w h i c h the Government’s Deve lopmen t and Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (DPRSP) has been 

l5 Montenegro’s Balance o f Payments data are o f p o o r qua l i ty . 

41 

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10 

Annex 2 

par t . With a shared u l t ima te objective o f EU integration, these tw o strategies encompass a comprehensive 
re fo rm agenda. 

A. The Stabilization and Association Process 

16. The S A P outlines three k e y challenges fo r Montenegro: 

0 Re in fo rc ing democratic institutions, including adopting a Cons t i tu t ion in l i n e with European 
standards; 

0 Comprehensive re forms t o harmonize po l ic ies and legislation; 

0 Strengthening limited administrative capacity to implement lega l and regu la tory fi-amework. 

17. W i t h i n this broad context, the S A P process envisages the maintenance o f macroeconomic s tab i l i ty 
and a number o f economic reforms, inc lud ing P u b l i c sector r e f o r m (e f fec t ive func t ion ing o f the state 
institutions; pub l ic adm in is tra t ion r e f o rm and imp lemen t ing the tax re fo rm package, inc lud ing VAT; 
establishing an e f fec t ive pub l ic procurement regime; and deve lop ing re l iab le statistics) and P r i v a t e 
sector deve lopmen t (speeding up restructuring, p r iva t iza t ion a n d o r l iqu ida t ion , deve lop ing a f h c t i o n i n g 
rea l estate market, promo te employment; abo l ish ing export duties and impo r t lev ies and modernize 
customs; and imp rov ing bus iness registration). 

B. Economic Reform Program and D PR S P 

18. The Government o f Mon tenegro l a i d ou t i t s development p r io r i t ies in the Econom ic R e f o rm Agenda 
fo r Mon tenegro 2002 - 2007 w h i c h aims t o trans form the Mon teneg r in economy. The paper recognizes 
that a wide range o f re forms (legal, regulatory, s imp l i f ica t ion o f adm in is tra t ive procedures and incentives) 
are needed to create an enabling env ironmen t fo r business. Specifically, the Agenda ca l ls fo r measures 
that wou ld promote b o t h fore ign and domestic investments, such as re forms in the jud ic ia ry , a 
consolidated and regulated f inanc ia l sector, tax re form , d im inu t ion o f the grey economy and reduc t ion o f 
administrative bamers. Competition, competitiveness and j o b creation are also cen tra l themes in the 
Agenda. 
I t ca l ls fo r inter a l ia ending subsidies and recons truc t ion o f state owned companies, 
s imp l i f ica t ion o f procedures fo r bus inesses t o enter and ex i t the market, a complete review o f existing 
bus iness regu la tory and securities legislation, and adop t ion o f a market-based, f lex ib le labor law . 

19. Within the overa l l Econom ic Re fo rm Program, the DPRSP lays out a strategy f o r pove r ty reduc t ion 
a imed at imp rov ing living standards fo r the poo r through re forms focused o n establishing the cond i t ions 
fo r dynamic, equitable growth. In add i t ion to eventual accession to the EU and W o r l d Trade Organ iza t ion 
(WTO ) membership, the DPRSP has i t s core objectives: (i) pub l ic sector r e f o rm consistent with 
macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and development o f a marke t economy; (ii) development o f the p r iva te sector 
through fur ther p r iva t iza t ion o f f inanc ia l and produc t ive assets and improvemen ts in the bus iness 
environment; and (iii) pove r ty reduc t ion (based o n strong pover ty diagnostics), improvemen ts in the 
effectiveness o f social programs, and attainment o f the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals. 

X I I . CAS05 Ob ject ives 

20. The CAS05 comm i t ted the W o r l d B a n k to support Mon teneg r in Government re fo rms under t h r e e 
broad, inter-related, med ium- term goals:

. Create a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector, through: f isca l consolidation, leaner 

and more e f f ic ien t pub l ic administration, better de l ivery o f state services and imp roved f inanc ia l 
. Create a larger, more dynamic private sector, through: con t inued progress on r e s t r u c t u r i n g and

Reduce poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public services, through 

improvements in support fo r ru ra l communities, the coverage, targeting, and re l iab i l i ty o f transfers fo r 
social pro tec t ion and the quality, access, and f inanc ia l sustainability o f hea l th and education f o r a l l 
citizens. 

21. These objectives were supported by IDA credits that have u t i l ized the Bank ’s comparative advantage 
and experience, backed up by ana ly t ica l and advisory support. 

22. During the pe r iod f r om F Y 0 5 to FY07 , the ma jo r i ty o f IDA operations active in Mon tenegro were 
approved p r i o r to the CASOS. These pre-CAS05 pro jec ts include b o t h the trade and transport fac i l i ta t ion

25. I F C i n v e s tm e n t s in Mon tenegro have been focused p r ima r i ly in the f inanc ia l sector. 
Investments 
include f inanc ing in F Y 0 5 - subsequently prepa id - fo r Oppor tun i ty B a n k Mon tenegro to expand i t s 
m ic ro - and small-business e n t e r p r i s e loan po r t fo l io . In addition, in F Y 0 5 non -pe r fo rm ing loans were 
restructured in to an investment in Podgor icka B a n k Mon tenegro (FY05). 
In F Y 0 6 Societe General

I F C i s 
considering n ew investments pa r t icu la r ly in the tourism, tou r ism infrastructure, energy/energy e f f ic iency , 
transport, mun ic ipa l finance and m icro- f inance sectors. 
I F C also has scope t o support the possible 
p r iva t iza t ion o f unbundled components o f the ene rgy company (EPCG) and possible ma jo r new 
pub l ic /pr iva te partnerships in the transport sector. I F C assistance cou ld include b o t h technical assistance, 
and pa r t icu la r ly the possible p rov is ion o f a transaction adviser through the Pr iva te En te rp r ise Partnership 
fo r Southeast Europe (PEPSE), as w e l l as po ten t ia l f inanc ing fo r investors. As Mon tenegro graduates to 
IBRD f inanc ing and moves towa rd European integration, i t i s expected that I F C w i l l p l a y an increas ing ly 
impor tan t ro le in the ove ra l l support that the W o r l d Bank Group can p rov ide t o Montenegro. Given 
syne rg ies between IBRD engagement and IFC , stronger co l labora t ion w i l l be c r i t ica l in the fo r thcom ing

26. MIGA has also been active in Mon tenegro p rov id ing technical assistance and ana ly t ica l work . On 
beha l f o f the European Agency fo r Recons truc t ion (EAR), MIGA p rov ided techn ica l assistance t o the 
Government regard ing the establishment and capacity building o f the Mon teneg r in Inves tmen t P romo t ion 
Agency (MIPA), which was established in April 2005. T o that end the MIGA team, under a short TA 
program, helped to develop a professional investment p romo t ion agency with the requ is i te s k i l l s , tools, 
resources and strategic d i rec t ion to raise the p ro f i le o f Mon tenegro as a compe t i t ive investment loca t ion 
and to stimulate and s u s t a i n a su f f ic ien t f l o w o f fore ign d irec t inves tmen t to act as an e f fec t ive catalyst fo r

o f the program, i t appears to have he lped f o r t i f y the ins t i tu t iona l status o f MIPA and he lped enhance the 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f MIPA to more responsively mee t the needs o f fo re ign investors. As with IFC , 
greater engagement between MIGA and IBRD i s envisaged in the fo r thcom ing CAS . M I G M I A S w i l l

X I I I . Retrofitting the Results Framework 

A. Goa l 1: Create a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient pub l ic sector 
Performance: Satisfactory 

27. Mon tenegro made substantial progress in this area. Expenditures were reduced f r om 47 percent o f 
GDP in 2003 to 42 percent o f GD P in 2006. At the same time, with government revenues increasing to 
around 45 percent o f GDP in 2006 re f lec t ing measures to broaden the tax base and imp rove compliance 
and the cyc l ica l upswing, the f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty o f the Mon teneg r in Budget imp roved s ign i f ican t ly and 
moved to a general government surplus o f 3 pe rcen t . To ta l public debt l e v e l s also dec l ined f r om 50% o f 
GDP in 2003 to around 40 percent in 2006. At the same time, ongo ing re forms in education, pensions 
and hea l th have started t o imp rove e f f ic iency o f service delivery. 

28. The CASOS’S Goa l 1 was supported by the Second Structural Adjustment Cred i t (SAC 2), a multi- 
sectoral pro jec t that has con tr ibu ted to each o f the three CAS05 goals. The SAC2 supported the 
authorities’ r e f o rm p rog ram in the energy, pens ion and hea l th sectors and in revamp ing t h e pub l ic

Annex 2 

administration. By strengthening the v iab i l i ty o f the ene rgy company (EPCG), the SAC2 con tr ibu ted to 
the decrease o f budgetary transfers needed to cover any losses o r contingent l iab i l i t ies . In the area o f 
hea l th and pensions, the re forms under the SAC2 supported the government's e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the pension re forms in troduced in 2003 and he lp advance the agenda fur ther by d ra f t ing a new l a w on 
vo lun tary pens ion funds. The government's hea l th strategy supported by the SAC2, helped ensure the 
f inanc ia l sustainability, e f f ic iency and imp roved governance o f hea l th insurance and hea l th care by 
helping the enactment o f a L a w o n med ic ina l products, adop t ion o f imp lemen ta t ion p lan re la ted to the 
L a w o n Med ic ina l Products, the L a w o n State Adm in is tra t ion , Pub l ic Procurement Law , Hea l th Care 
Law , and Hea l th Insurance Law , and other re la ted laws, cover ing changes required in the organization 
and operation o f the Ministry o f Health, Mon te farm , and the Med ic ines Agency o f the Government o f 
Montenegro, satisfactory to the Association. 
I t has also ensu red that the 2005 budget l a w p rov ided 
adequate budgetary transfers to the hea l th and pens ion systems, and adopted an ind ica t ive three year f isca l 
framework. In the area o f pub l ic administration, the SAC2 supported the authorities in adop t ing laws o n 
the c i v i l service that brough t Mon tenegro closer t o European standards by c lear ly defining the boundaries 
b e tw e e n po l i t ica l appointees and c i v i l servants and establishing t h e m a i n cond i t ions fo r the development 
o f a pro fess iona l c i v i l service. The L a w o n Salaries o f C iv i l Servants was intended t o foster 
decompression o f pub l ic wages, but macroeconomic concerns and differing p o l i c y p r io r i t ies have l im i t e d 
i t s impact. The base salary compression ra t io increased f r om 4.1 t o 5.1 in 2005, but 2006 increases were 
f la t rate fo r a l l positions. The wage b i l l as percentage o f GD P dec l ined f r om 13.2 percent in 2003 to just 
over 11 percent in 2006. Nevertheless, the ove ra l l wage b i l l remains re la t ive ly high, and has increases in 
Eu ro terms between 2003 and 2006, although dec l in ing as a p ropo r t ion o f GDP . Recen t increases in 
pub l ic sector wage rates, a l though o f fse t in pa r t by redundancies, re f lec t b o t h the s treng th o f the trade 
un ion movement, as w e l l as ove ra l l wage increases as a r e s u l t o f the very strong economy. 

29. The ongo ing Pens ions System Adm in is tra t ion Investment P ro jec t seeks to imp rove the f inanc ia l 
sustainability o f the pens ion system by increasing tax and con t r ibu t ion compliance; res truc tur ing and 
modern iz ing the key ins t i tu t ions o f the pension system; and strengthening capacity fo r eva lua t ion and 
analysis o f the pens ion system and pension re forms . W h i l e the e n t i r e leg is la t ive framework fo r the 
ex is t ing pens ion system and consolidated co l lec t ion have been enacted, pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion has been 
slower than expected due p r ima r i ly to i n i t i a l prob lems encountered in procurement o f large packages. As 
a resu l t , the targets fo r the end o f 2006 have no t been reached. W h i l e the re are slight improvements in the 
co l lec t ion o f pens ion con tr ibu t ions (2 percent higher in 2005 compared to 2004), reach ing the targeted 
improvements b o t h in the l e v e l o f compliance and in the adm in is tra t ive e f f ic iency w i l l on ly be achieved 
once the new co l lec t ion system i s fully implemented. The ac t iv i t ies supported by the pro jec t in these 
areas have recen t ly intensified and i t i s expected that the system w i l l be comp le ted by m id-2008 . O n e 
area where progress i s rea l ly s ign i f ican t i s the development o f a long - te rm pens ion mode l and capacities 
fo r i ts use. The mode l has been f ina l ized and i t i s n o w regu la r ly used by the MHLSW's Pensions 
department to identify v iab le re fo rm options fo r fu ture mod i f ica t ions o f the pens ion system. A lso , the 
L a w on vo lun tary pens ion system has been enacted and the ac t iv i t ies o n the preparation o f the requ i red 
regulations, development o f the supervisory capacities and pub l ic education are in tens i fy ing . 

30. The m a i n objectives o f the ongo ing Hea l th System Improvement P ro jec t are to improve the f inanc ia l 
sustainability o f the healthcare sys tem by strengthening ins t i tu t iona l capacity and in fo rma t ion systems 
and to imp rove quality, e f f ic iency , and access to p r ima ry healthcare services. T h i s has been pa r t icu la r ly 
impor tan t as b o t h pub l ic sector spending o n hea l th (at about 6.6 percent o f GDP) and to ta l spending on 
hea l th (at about 8.6 percent o f GDP) in Mon tenegro i s re la t ive ly high compared b o t h to countries with 
s im i lar income l e v e l s and compared to hea l th outcomes. With regard t o the hea l th f inanc ing component, 
a new payment me thodo logy was prepared and has been p i lo ted in Podgor ica since June 2006, resulting 
in the in t roduc t ion o f the new payment system with electronic invo ic ing .

fo r the res truc tur ing o f pub l ic finances envisaged under Goa l 1, i s p rov ided by the 2003 Pub l ic 
Expend i ture and Ins t i tu t iona l Review (PEIR) and Mon tenegro PE IR Update, and the 2002 Coun t ry 
Procurement Assessment Repor t and Coun try F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment. Over the C A S 
period, the Bank ’s know ledge base has been strengthened through the Mon tenegro Econom ic 
Memo randum (MEM). The MEM (completed in FY05 ) focused o n macroeconomic i s s u e s (par t icu lar ly 
pub l ic expenditure), labor marke t reform, and the bus iness climate. A Debt Sustainability Ana lys is 
update fo r Mon tenegro has been completed in CY2007 . Add i t iona l support fo r imp rov ing the e f f ic iency 
and effectiveness o f the pub l ic sector in Mon tenegro has been p rov ided through an Ins t i tu t iona l 
Deve lopmen t Fund (IDF) grant that has strengthened the ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f t h e Cen tra l Bank as 
relates to governance, in terna l control, in terna l audit, risk management and ethics. 

B. Goal 2: Create a larger, more dynamicprivate sector 
Performance: Satisfactory 

32. The economy responded pos i t ive ly to the b o l d p r iva t iza t ion and l ibe ra l iza t ion e f for ts and the 
conso l ida t ion o f the f isca l balance. Gross pr iva te sector investments surged t o around 36 percent o f GDP 
by 2006, up f r om be low 12 percent o f GD P in 2003, re f lec t ing reco rd FDI l e v e l s o f around 34 percent o f 
GDP in 2006, g row ing compe t i t ion in the f inanc ia l sector and e f for ts to promo te the coun try as a tour is t 
destination. As a r e s u l t the g row th rate o f the economy accelerated t o around 6.5 percent in 2006. 

33 . The B a n k and I F C have p rov ided substantial ongo ing support fo r the p r iva t iza t ion and res truc tur ing 
o f rea l and f inanc ia l assets in the country. In general, the p r iva t iza t ion process in Mon tenegro i s well 
advanced, including the sale o f very large companies such as Mon tenegro Te lecom in 2005, the 
p r iva t iza t ion o f the a lum inum p lan t (KAP) in 2005, the sale o f 67 percent o f the Steelworks in N i k s i c , as 
w e l l as a range o f smaller sales. In 2005 alone, p r iva t iza t ion receipts topped Eu ro 200 m i l l i o n (equivalent 
to almost 10 percent o f GDP), with associated comm i tmen ts o f almost the same amount again in new 
investments fo r p r iva t ized industries. P r iva t iza t ion i s p robab ly 80 percent complete - a l though some 
ma jo r assets, inc lud ing the ene rgy company (EPCG), Mon tenegro airlines and others rema in in ma jo r i ty 
government ownership. 

34. The Bank, together with IFC , has supported the f inanc ia l sector r e f o rm th rough S AC 2, pa r t icu la r ly 
the p r iva t iza t ion o f Podgoricka Banka and the subsequent reso lu t ion by the Ministry o f Finance o f bad 
loan assets f r om several poo r ly pe r fo rm ing banks. 
I F C has also p rov ided $5.2 m i l l i o n through 
Oppo r tun i ty Bank Mon tenegro to expand i t s m ic ro - and small-business enterprise loan po r t fo l io . The 
f inanc ia l sector i s n o w large ly owned by the p r iva te sector, a l though the Government s t i l l re ta ins some 
sma l l stakes. 

35. SAC 2 also he lped to promo te g row th through increased (and increas ing ly e f f ic ien t) f inanc ia l 
in termed ia t ion and ene rgy sector re forms that have supported b o t h g row th and f isca l conso l ida t ion by 
overcom ing episodes o f supply sho r t fa l l and ensuring the f inanc ia l se l f-su f f ic iency o f energy u t i l i t ies . 
With support under b o t h SAC2 and the Emergency Stabilization of Electricity Supply Project, collections, 
as a percentage o f billing, have imp roved considerably over the past few years, f r om 80 percent in 1997 to 
90 percent in 2005, and are expected t o reach 94 percent o r more in 2008. Payment d isc ip l ine by the 
largest indus t r ia l consumer (Komb ina t A lum in i juma Podgor ica - JSAP) has also imp roved s ign i f ican t ly 
after i t s p r iva t iza t ion in 2005 and as pa r t o f the Bank ’s S AC 2, EPCG and KAP have executed a multi- 
year Power Purchase Agreement fo r the supply o f e lec t r ic i ty that prov ides fo r a phased increase in the 
p r i c e o f e lec tr ic i ty . Desp i te an improvemen t in collections, losses in EPCG’s d is t r ibu t ion ne tworks 
rema in very high at around 30 percent, o f w h i c h t w o thirds i s estimated to be commerc ia l losses and the 
, rema in ing one third i s technical losses. As pa r t o f the Bank ’s Emergency Stabilization of Electricity 
Supply Project, EPCG has been implementing a p i l o t p rog ram fo r loss reduc t ion that inc ludes the

in t roduc t ion o f automatic meter read ing in p i l o t areas to examine impac t o f app l ica t ion o f advance 
me ter ing technology o n reduc ing commerc ia l losses. The ins ta l la t ion o f the p i l o t system i s expected to be 
completed by the end o f M a y 2007, and the assessment o f i t s r e s u l t s w i l l assist EPCG in deve lop ing an 
ac t ion p lan for rehab i l i ta t ion o f the d is t r ibu t ion ne two rk and consumer me ters . The ac t ion p l a n w i l l be 
pa r t o f a three phase strategy fo r loss reduc t ion in the d is t r ibu t ion ne two rk that EPCG i s developing in 
order to reduce the unacceptably high leve l o f ne two rk losses. 

36. Fur ther support fo r the energy sector w i l l also be p rov ided through the Energy Commun i ty o f South 
East Europe (ECSEE) adaptable programmatic loan (APL). This project, i n i t i a l l y approved by the Bank 
just p r i o r to Montenegro’s independence but never made effective, w i l l be reapproved in 2007 n o w that 
Mon tenegro has fo rma l ly become a member o f the Bank. The reg iona l energy pro jec t w i l l support 
Mon tenegro in implementing i t s p rog ram fo r powe r market l ibe ra l iza t ion and reg iona l powe r market 
accession. M o r e specifically, the p ro jec t w i l l support necessary investments to help ensu re the s e c u r i t y 
and re l iab i l i ty o f the e lec tr ic i ty supply to the popu la t ion wh i le the marke t i s be ing l ibe ra l ized and 
integrated t o an even greater extent with the reg iona l power market. I t i s expected that this w i l l reduce 
ene rgy costs for indus t r ia l consumers, thereby boos t ing competitiveness, and compe l na t iona l u t i l i t i e s to 
be more e f f ic ien t by subjecting them to compe t i t ive p ressu res . Nevertheless, likely increases in 
res iden t ia l ta r i f fs w i l l r e q u i r e compensating social assistance fo r poo r households, as the Government i s 
doing. Bank support i s consistent with an unbundling o f the d is tr ibu t ion , transmission and generation 
assets o f EPCG, and the anticipated p r iva t iza t ion o f at least the d is t r ibu t ion and poss ib ly the generation 
assets. 

37. In the area o f trade and expor t promo t ion , the Bank has p rov ided support through t w o credits, 
cover ing b o t h Serbia and Mon tenegro . The Trade and Transport Fac i l i ta t ion in Southeast Europe Pro jec t 
(TTFSE) i s one o f e igh t pa ra l le l coun try pro jec ts under the reg iona l Trade and Transport Fac i l i ta t ion 
Program, w h i c h aims to lowe r non - ta r i f f costs o f trade and transport, reduce smuggling and corrup t ion at 
border crossings, s treng then reg iona l partnerships and expand trade. O r ig ina l ly designed fo r the U n i o n o f 
Serbia and Montenegro, TTFSE continues to support modern iza t ion o f the Customs Adm in is t ra t ion o f 
b o t h countries, establishment o f modem in fo rma t ion systems shared across border agencies (with the 
u l t ima te objective o f establishing a s ing le electronic w indow fo r tiaders), transparency o f in fo rma t ion on 
o f f ic ia l requirements, and imp lemen ta t ion o f n ew customs procedures at selected border crossings. In 
June 2006, a Customs Survey, camed ou t in the context o f p ro jec t supervision, ind ica ted that s ign i f ican t 
progress has taken place regard ing the e f f ic iency o f Customs between 2002 and 2006. A l l aspects o f the 
pro jec t (transparency, equality, standardization o f procedures, ab i l i ty t o lodge a complaint) imp roved 
markedly. Acco rd ing to the survey organized by Mon tenegro Customs Agency in June 2006, corrup t ion 
in Customs i s assessed as Low -med ium (2.26 ou t o f a 1 to 5 scale) in Mon tenegro by respondents. 

38 . The Expo r t Finance Fac i l i ta t ion Pro jec t supports the e f for ts o f the Serbia and Mon tenegro Expo r t 
Cred i t Agency (SMECA ) to fac i l i ta te and expand cross border trade by o f fe r ing po l i t ica l r i s k insurance, 
wo rk ing cap i ta l loans and guarantees, and export performance and cred i t insurance. The credit insurance 
par t o f the SM EC A pro jec t insured expor t transactions o f Eu ro 190 m i l l i o n at the end o f 2006. The 
fac tor ing fac i l i ty o f the project, used in con junc t ion with cred i t insurance, i s p rov id ing clients with

in fac tor ing increased f r om Euros 3.9 m i l l i o n in 2005 to Euros 10.8 m i l l i o n fo r 2006. 

39. In so l id waste management, the Mon tenegro Env i ronmen ta l ly Sensitive Tou r is t Areas Project 
(MESTAP) supports the development o f the tou r ism sector by deve lop ing eco log ica l ly and commerc ia l ly 
sustainable so l id waste co l lec t ion and disposal services in Mon tenegnn coastal mun ic ipa l i t ies . At this

44. D e s p i t e s ign i f ican t increases in pe r capita GDP in Montenegro, ove ra l l reductions in pove r ty over the

45. Mon tenegro has t w o d is t inc t data sources in t e rm s o f mon i to r ing pover ty : Living Standards 
Measurement S u r v e y s (LSMS) fo r 2002-2004 and Househo ld Budget Surveys (HBS) starting in 2005. 
The L S M S s were conducted over one mon th each year and use different methodologies f r om year to year. 
This makes the pove r ty numbers difficult to compare (e.g. the 2002 data are n o t fully representative o f the 
population, the 2003 data p rov ide insu f f ic ien t number o f records to estimate the statistical precision). 
S t i l l , even in these cond i t ions pove r ty rema ined approx ima te ly stable. F o r the pe r iod 2002-2004, the 
estimated pove r ty rates (headcounts) f r om various sources are: 9.4 in 2002, 12.2 in 2003, and 10.9 in 
2004. Nevertheless, the s ign i f ican t drop in unemp loymen t in 2006, f r om about 19 percent t o about 14

In contacts with B a n k staff, government o f f ic ia ls 
consistently state that they value the ir re la t ionsh ip with the Bank highly. 

5 1. Ove ra l l C A S outcome ind ica tors were genera l ly met. In l i n e with C A S Goa l 1, pub l ic expenditure 
dec l ined f r om 47 percent to 42 percent o f GD P as pro jec ted in the 2007 budget, wh i le the ove ra l l service

In l i n e with Goa l 3, pove r ty measures show some slight 
improvement, a l though mos t no t iceab ly in the fas t-grow ing coastal regions, and l e s s so in the n o r t h o f the 
country. Unde r the new p r ima ry care package and “My Doc to r ” reforms, wa i t ing t imes have fa l len and 
there i s widespread pub l ic support fo r the re forms . A l though d irec t causality can be ha rd t o determine, in 
a l l cases Bank interventions appear to have con tr ibu ted to these gains.

52. Nevertheless, imp lemen ta t ion o f the CAS05 program suffered delays. These were caused in part by 
the referendum and subsequent elections and the limited focus o n r e f o rm tha t almost inev i tab ly occurs in 
such an environment. 
In addition, the very limited capacity o f many Government ins t i tu t ions also 
con tr ibu ted to delays. This was con f i rmed by the Joint Po r t fo l io Rev iew (JPR), completed in M a r c h 
2006, which c lear ly emphasizes a number o f imp lemen ta t ion problems, r e f l e c t e d in very l o w 
disbursements. A l though this l o w disbursement percentage pa r t ia l ly re f lec ts the re la t ive young average

Mon tenegro being ra ted Unsa t is fac tory fo l low ing the JPR. 

53. S ign i f ican t attention. t o po r t fo l io issues , and supervision in particular, has helped to turn around 
performance. A renewed push o n the re fo rm f ron t in b o t h Pension and Hea l th projects, and especially 
e lec tr ic i ty p r i c i n g and the ins ta l la t ion o f me te rs has ensured that b o t h the SAC2 and Emergency 
S tab i l iza t ion o f E lec t r ic i ty Supp ly loans have turned around -w i th SAC2 disbursed in la te 2006 after full 
compliance, and the e lec tr ic i ty investment expected to do so in early 2007. At the time this CAS 
Comp le t ion Repor t i s finalized, Mon tenegro po r t fo l io has on ly one p ro jec t ra ted U o n Imp lemen ta t ion

54. A f te r i n i t i a l d i f f i c u l t i e s in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Pension System Adm in is t ra t ion Investment 
P ro jec t (PSAIP), the ac t iv i t ies have r e c e n t l y intensified under a l l components o f the pro jec t . The 
progress i s pa r t icu la r ly evident with respect to capacity building fo r pens ion p o l i c y development in the 
MHLSW, where the long - te rm pens ion mode l has been developed and the s ta f f tra ined in using i t to 
identify possible future r e f o rm options fo r the pension system, and the pub l ic education campaign f o r the 
vo lun tary pension system. A lso , t w o ma jo r software development undertakings in the D irec tora te fo r 
Pub l ic Revenues and Pension and D isab i l i ty Fund have recen t ly started. T h e s e shou ld be fo l lowed by the 
procurement o f hardware and imp lemen ta t ion o f the new pension adm in is tra t ion system. 

55. The Mon tenegro Hea l th System Improvement Pro jec t (HSIP), approved in 2004, has experienced 
severe d i f f i c u l t i e s and delays in the beginning o f i t s imp lemen ta t ion due t o d iv is ions between m a i n 
stakeholders in the hea l th sector. These d iv is ions were due to po l i t ica l tensions and the ongo ing 
red is tr ibu t ion o f ro les and respons ib i l i t ies betiveen the regu la tory bod ies (MOH, IPH), the purchaser 
(H IF) and the prov iders (PHC). After the M id Term Rev iew m iss ion in 2007, the p ro jec t has b e e n 
refocused and some subcomponents were restructured to re f lec t a more log ica l group ing o f the ac t iv i t ies 
financed by the Credit. Even though the pro jec t did n o t progress with the p lanned speed, results achieved 
so far m i r ro r the ove ra l l comm i tmen t t o hea l th sector re forms . This i s pa r t icu la r ly t r u e fo r the 
in t roduc t ion o f F am i l y Med ic ine in Podgorica, where fo r instance 72 percent o f adults have already 
chosen their fam i ly doctor, the m a i n Hea l th Care Ins t i tu t ion (Dom Zdrav l ja) i s imp lemen t ing a new

56. The Mon tenegro Educa t ion Reform P ro jec t has fully bene f i ted f r om the strong comm i tmen t o f the 
Government and the close a t ten t ion o f the pro jec t team. A l though re la t ive ly new (it was approved in

57. As a resu l t , at the time o f prepar ing this CASCR, o n l y the M E S T A P pro jec t remains in serious 
d i f f icu l ty . 

58. The Bank has made good use o f the Economic and Sector Work and AAA. The ana ly t ica l w o r k 
complemented the adjustment and investment projects pa r t icu la r ly in the areas o f energy, labor market, 
f isca l p o l i c y and p r iva te sector. The Bank’s understanding o f pove r ty i s s u e s in Mon tenegro w i l l be 
imp roved by the ongo ing Pover ty Assessmen t Update, and the w o r k i s well integrated i n t o the program. 
The po r t fo l io has also benefited f r om thorough ana ly t ica l w o r k o n pub l ic expenditure, which has been 
mainstreamed i n t o the sectoral interventions, such as education and pub l ic sector management. 

59. Delivery o f products. As Table 2 shows, by the end o f FY07 , the planned IDA lend ing p rog ram 
w i l l have been de l ivered in full. The Deve lopmen t Po l icy C red i t 3 was dropped because o f improvements 
in Mon tenegro ’s ove ra l l pub l ic finance pos i t ion . Nevertheless, IDA funds have been reor ien ted t o 
increase the IDA po r t ion o f the sustainable tou r ism operation. Stringent bo r row ing c e i l i n g s led to the 
Au thor i t ies dec id ing n o t to proceed with IBRD bo r row ing in FY07 , a l though a second component o f the 
sustainable tou r ism pro jec t has been r o l l e d over t o F Y 0 8 at the request o f the Au thor i t ies . 

60. The w o r k o f d i f feren t parts o f the W o r l d B a n k Group has been mu tua l ly complementary, though IDA 
has dominated. The I F C has on ly a sma l l p rog ram in Mon tenegro and has had d i f f icu l t ies finding 
indus t r ia l inves tmen ts o f s u f f i c i e n t scale. Overa l l , I F C i s likely to become an increas ing ly impo r tan t actor 
in Montenegro, given the continued p r iva t iza t ion process as well as opportunities in the fast g row ing 
tourism, tou r ism infrastructure, r e t a i l and f inanc ia l sectors, as well as the scope fo r p r iva te f inanc ing o f 
ma jo r transport sector investments. Over the next C A S period, n ew investments by I F C are l i k e l y to 
exceed n ew investments by IDNIBRD. I F C and W o r l d B a n k technical assistance w i l l need to be 
integrated we l l , pa r t icu la r ly given the scope fo r syne rg ies in the e lec tr ic i ty and transport sectors, where 
I F C might be able to p rov ide a transaction adviser fo r the po ten t ia l sale o f e lec tr ic i ty generation o f 
d is t r ibu t ion assets, as w e l l as fo r po ten t ia l concessions fo r ma jo r road infrastructure. 

61. Mon tenegro has received substantial donor support o f around 300 m i l l i o n Euros since 2001. In t e r m s 
o f donor coordination, there were substantial and compe t ing p r io r i t ies fo r development assistance in 
Montenegro. Accord ing ly , the Bank’s coun try p rog ram re l ied o n development partners to take the lead in 
some sectors, in par t icu lar those in wh ich the S A A agenda and the complementary EU p rog ram were 
focused. The B a n k has wo rked c lose ly with EAR, as the m a i n imp lemen ta t ion veh ic le o f the EC, in the 
ene rgy sector, and with USAID in public sector re form . As anticipated, this approach resu l ted in a more 
concentrated p rog ram and emphasized reliance o n the Bank ’s partners. Fur ther l inkage o f B a n k support 
to EU p r io r i t ies and imp rov ing coord ina t ion with the EU w i l l in troduce synergies be tween the tw o 
institutions, fac i l i ta te the country’s move to full IBRD cond i t ions and increase government comm i tmen t 
to reforms. The B a n k has also coordinated c lose ly with the German Government, EBRD and EIB in the 
preparation o f the sustainable tou r ism development pro jec t . 

A. Overa l l assessment of CASperformance 

62. The team judges the CAS05 performance as Satisfactory in those areas where the B a n k in f luenced 
results directly. Mon tenegro made progress towards a l l o f the p lanned CAS05 outcomes and the B a n k 
p layed a s ign i f ican t ro le in helping the coun try achieve these r e s u l t s . 

XV. 

Lessons fo r subsequent CAS design 

63. The areas o f focus in the CAS were appropriate and the m i x o f interventions supported the 
objectives well. G iven the substantial progress Mon tenegro has made and the con tr ibu t ions that the B a n k 

52 

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10 

Annex 2 

p rog ram made to that progress, the team concludes that the goals were selected appropriately. The 
ac t iv i t ies a l l con tr ibu ted t o the desired outcomes and n o ac t iv i t ies were redundant. G iven resource and 
capacity constraints b o t h in IDA and in the Government, i t i s ha rd to see wha t add i t iona l ac t iv i t ies the 
B a n k shou ld have undertaken. 

64. Bank support should increasingly focus o n Montenegro’s integration with the EU, and assist in 
building the capacity o f state institutions for better utilization of I P A funds. With the in i t ia l ing o f a 
S A A , the support to the EU in tegra t ion process must take o n a sharper focus. As l a c k o f capacity i s one 
o f the k e y constraints o f Montenegro, the B a n k and other donors must ensure that capacity building i s a 
k e y e lemen t in assistance during the nex t C A S per iod . 

65. Encouraging sustainable economic growth must be a key focus o f the next CAS. Mon tenegro 
has successfully ma in ta ined macro-economic s tab i l i ty during the past few years. S truc tura l re forms and 
e f for ts to ma in ta in and imp rove the env ironmen t w i l l be c r i t ica l to ensu re that g row th i s able t o continue, 
given con t inu ing pover ty . The fu ture CAS w i l l need to pay exp l ic i t a t ten t ion t o ensuring that t h e bene f i ts 
f r om economic g row th have wider impac t among the d i f fe ren t parts o f the popu la t ion . 

66. Engagement across the Bank Group, while strong, could be strengthened even further. There i s 
scope fo r new I F C investments over the short- to medium-term to exceed new IDNIBRD investments - 
especially as the Bank moves to IBRD lend ing and in an environment where the Government i s seeking 
to reduce ove ra l l pub l ic debt. There i s considerable scope tb ensure syne rg ies in the p rov is ion o f 
techn ica l assistance, pa r t icu la r ly in the transport, tou r ism infrastructure, and e lec tr ic i ty sectors. 

67. The Bank’s knowledge and expertise must be integrated fully into future assistance. The 
Bank ’s comparative advantage in Mon tenegro i s o f fe r ing bundled lending and f inanc ia l products. 
Mon tenegro has benefited f r om several impo r tan t pieces o f ESW during CASOS. B a n k expertise, a long 
with financing, can be especially u s e f u l t o assist Mon tenegro given capacity constraints. Support in 
c r i t ica l sectors, such as tou r ism planning, ene rgy re form , imp rov ing the business environment, 
s tream l in ing and imp rov ing social service de l ivery , and appropriately manag ing ma jo r PPPsl concessions 
w i l l requ ire advice as well as financing. S im i la r ly , Bank advice w i l l also be c ruc ia l t o support any IMF 
program, which i s likely to have a strong structural element. 

68. Donor coordination has to be intensified. G iven the strong n e e d to focus assistance fo r 
Montenegro, the B a n k there i s a scope t o put more emphasis o n donor coord ina t ion . Stronger 
coord ina t ion with the EU cou ld especially help t o integrate Bank investments with the considerable E C 
funding fo r technical assistance. Coord ina t ion with other ma jo r financiers, including the IMF, EBRD and 
EIB w i l l also be crucial, as w i l l even stronger engagement with s ign i f ican t b i la te ra l donors. 

69 . The next CAS should be more realistic about the implementation capacity o f state institutions. 
The lack o f imp lemen ta t ion capacity took i t s t o l l in CASOS, with many pro jec ts running i n t o d i f f icu l t ies 
soon after approval. Lending prepara t ion cou ld be assisted by under tak ing appropriate W E S W p r i o r 
to ensu re ownership and gauge comm i tmen t be fo re deve lop ing operations, and with greater a t ten t ion to 
the readiness f o r imp lemen ta t ion o f the projects.

I. CONSULTATIONS AND OUTREACH 

Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CPS. In te rna l ly , the w h o l e 

coun t ry team has been ac t ive ly i n v o l v e d in the p repa ra t ion o f the strategy i n c l u d i n g I F C 
and MIGA members o f the team. Early consultations begun in October 2006, w h e n the 
members o f the coun t ry team go t together f o r t w o day retreat in Mon teneg ro and, j o i n t l y 
with the M i n i s t e r o f F inance and other Gove rnmen t representatives, discussed the 
development p r io r i t ies o f the coun t ry and the general f ramewo rk o f the C o u n t r y 
Partnership Strategy. 

I n Montenegro, the B an k team has embarked on focused consultations with 

stakeholders. The team started the consu l ta t ion process by mee t ing and consu l t ing a 
range o f stakeholders, w h i c h inc luded the non -gove rnmen ta l sector and academia. T h i s 
consu l ta t ion process was f ina l ized by an o rgan iza t ion o f a wo rkshop in Podgorica, the 
cap i ta l o f Montenegro, w h i c h inc luded the CPS Co re Team and representatives o f c i v i l 
society2'. The results c lea r ly show ove ra l l endorsement o f the p r i o r i t y areas o f the Bank 
and i t s effectiveness in de l ive r ing the support. 

The M in is te r of F inance led the government counterpart team to guide the preparation 

of the strategv. T h e B a n k and the government teams discussed the Bank operations in 
Montenegro, i n c l u d i n g the lessons d r aw n f r o m the Bank support so far. T h e y rev iewed

Specific consultations were organized for donors for the CPS priorities and donor 

coordination. On April 23,2007, discussions we re h e l d in Brussels be tween members o f 
the coun t ry team and representatives o f the Eu ropean Comm iss ion . The purpose o f the

F o l l o w i n g the re fe rendum h e l d o n M a y 21, 2006 and the subsequent declaration o f

Conclusions stating that Yhe EU and i t s M em b e r States dec ided t o develop f k t h e r the i r

The Gove rnmen t o f Mon teneg ro has declared Eu ropean in teg ra t ion t o b e one o f the

The idea o f a S A P as a t o o l o f ancho r ing the countries f r o m the Wes te rn Ba lkans towa rds

F o l l o w i n g independence, the EU has started t o adapt the ins t rumen ts o f the S tab i l iza t ion

F o l l o w i n g s ign i f ican t recent improvements, Montenegro’s debt p o s i t i o n i s moderate, and 
compares favo rab ly t o ne ighbo r ing countries in the reg ion . 

Mon teneg ro ’s pub l ic debt has dec l ined f r o m almost 9 0 percent o f GDP in 2002 t o just

savings in Banks outside Mon teneg ro and t o assume i t s sha re o f wage arrears f r o m the 
fo rme r State U n i o n . M o s t seriously, as the process o f res t i tu t ion was b e i n g f ina l ized in 
2006, the Au tho r i t ies rea l ized tha t c la ims granted by independent m u n i c i p a l committees, 
w h i c h estimates suggest c o u l d b e as m u c h as 50 percent o f GDP, c o u l d threaten ove ra l l

countries in the reg ion . T h i s c o u l d limit t o t a l exposure t o 10 percent o f GDP, with annua l

Paris C l u b restructurings and debt w r i t e - o f f s in 2003 and 2006 have p a r t i c u l a r l y he lped t o

Estimates by IMF s t a f f and the Au tho r i t ies suggest that ex te rna l p r i v a t e debt j u m p e d 
f r o m 16 percent o f GDP in 2005 t o 2 2 percent o f GDP in 2006. As a result, 
Mon teneg ro ’s t o t a l ex te rna l debt has increased f r o m j u s t ove r 4 0 percent o f GDP in 2003,

strong r e a l g r ow t h s l ow i n g gradually, with the current account s i tua t ion im p r o v i n g as 
FDI also slows. Scenarios also assume a reso lu t ion o f res t i tu t ion c la ims consistent with 
the p roposa l cu r ren t ly being considered by the Au tho r i t ies . P r iva t iza t ion revenues, w h i c h 
have he lped the authorities t o reduce r e l a t i v e l y expensive domestic debt, are also 
p ro jec ted t o f a l l ove r time, as the p r i v a t i z a t i o n process moves towa rds comp le t ion . 

Under baseline scenarios, p u b l i c debt and t o t a l ex te rna l debt are b o t h p ro jec ted t o 
con t inue t o dec l ine t o b e l ow 30 percent o f GDP by 2012. U s i n g h i s t o r i c a l averages, t o t a l 
external debt declines even faster, a l though p u b l i c ex te rna l debt, w h i l e declining, does so 
at a s lowe r pace. 

Rega rd ing p u b l i c sector debt sustainability, standard IMF stress tests resu l t in a s lowe r

m o r e conservative than that o f the IMF (more moderate growth, weaker s t ruc tu ra l

tests suggest that Mon teneg ro ’s debt dynam ics are p a r t i c u l a r l y susceptible t o a sudden
