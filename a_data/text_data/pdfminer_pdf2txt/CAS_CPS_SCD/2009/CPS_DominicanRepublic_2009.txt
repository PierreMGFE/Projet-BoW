c o n t i n u e d r a p i d p r o g r e s s . Among the main sources o f vulnerability are: (i) a d i f f icu l t f i s c a l 
situation n ow worsened by the global economic financial c r i s is ; (ii) extremely h igh levels o f 
poverty and inequality and limited capacity to implement counter-cyclical social policies; (iii) 
competitiveness challenges deriving mainly f rom an inefficient energy sector and l o w s k i l l s 
levels; and ( iv ) the negative implications o f climate change fo r the country’s important tourist 

industry. 
T h e DR and t h e B a n k G r o u p h a v e l o n g m a i n t a i n e d a c lose p a r t n e r s h i p , but the

Government requests for knowledge services and financing, but implementation has been slow - 
affected b y significant effectiveness delays fo r new operations and slow execution o f the 
portfolio, largely due to fiscal constraints and capacity limitations. Nonetheless, Government 
believes that the Wo r ld Bank Group continues to be we l l positioned to help in addressing the 
important development challenges that the country faces, and has been actively partnering w i t h 
the Bank in exploring the menu o f instruments that could most appropriately respond to the 
country’s needs .

priorities set fo r th b y the Fernandez Administration and the key elements o f the National 
Development Strategy wh ich i s currently being finalized through a broad, participatory process. 
I ts ma in objective i s to support the country in reducing i t s vulnerability to internal and external 
shocks wh i le producing results for its citizens. This new CPS w i l l promote synergies between 
the wo rk programs o f the en t i re Wo r ld Bank Group - the IBRD, the IFC, and M I G A .

c o u n t r y . This objective and p r io r i t y areas w i l l be addressed b y implementing actions to achieve 
4 strategic objectives: (i) strengthen social cohesion and improve access to and quality o f social 
services, (ii) promote competitiveness in a sustainable and r e s i l i e n t economic environment, (iii) 
enhance quality o f public expenditures and institutional development, and ( iv ) build capacity and 
constituencies for reform. 
T h e p r o p o s e d s t r a t e g y w i l l k e e p a f l e x i b l e a p p r o a c h and b e b a s e d o n a c o m b i n a t i o n

t e r m s o f E S W and N o n - L e n d i n g T e c h n i c a l A s s i s t a n c e (NLTAs). The proposed strategy w i l l 
support the Government in producing r e s u l t s wh i le strengthening accountability between public 
sector agencies. B y wo rk ing w i t h non-traditional actors and focusing on strengthening oversight 
mechanisms in the public sector, the proposed model w i l l also focus on demand-side governance 
interventions to generate the r igh t incentives for increasing accountability levels to the public 
while strengthening checks and balances w i t h i n the public sector. However, should the 
Government’s re fo rm program stall, macroeconomic conditions deteriorate significantly, or the 
Bank fails to secure a credible po l icy ma t r ix to underpin budgetary support lending, the Bank 
v i

w o u l d rethink the balance between policy-based and investment lend ing . WBG synergies w i l l 
enhance this f l e x i b l e approach a l l ow i n g f o r the u s e o f diverse instruments. 

6. 

IFC’s approach during the upcoming CPS period w i l l be two-fold. First, I F C w i l l 

con t inue w o r k i n g with the underserved segments o f the market, the ones hav ing the highest 
impac t o n the b o t t om o f the py ram id . Reaching ou t t o microenterprises and sma l l and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) w i l l be a key objective. Implied areas o f in te rven t ion w i l l inc lude access t o 
finance (trade, microfinance and SMEs), im p r o v i n g the business env i ronmen t (D o i n g Business 
Re fo rm , Corporate Governance), access t o basic 
infrastructure, and sustainable 
tou r ism 
development. Oppo r tun i t ies in other g r ow t h and income generating sectors (agribusiness, general 
manu fac tu r ing and so on) w i l l be supported when lead ing t o sustainable p r iva te sector 
inves tmen t . 
I F C w i l l also respond to the current f inanc ia l crisis, with a pa r t icu la r focus o n 
ex is t ing c l ien ts and shorter term f inanc ing (no tab ly trade f inanc ing ) . 
I F C investment and 
adv iso ry actions w i l l inc lude c l ima te change m i t i g a t i o n (e.g. energy e f f ic iency and renewable 
energy), ra is ing sustainability standards (environment, social, and corporate governance), and 
l inkages (e.g. sma l l and medium enterprises). 

7 . 

The new CPS will rely on donor coordination. The proposed approach i s f u l l y 

consistent with the p r inc ip les agreed in the Paris Declaration, o f 2005: (i) ownership, (ii) 
,alignment, (iii) harmonization, ( iv) manag ing f o r r e s u l t s and (v) mu tua l accoun tab i l i ty , In l i n e 
with these p r inc ip les and acco rd ing t o the concrete recommendations emerging f r om the A c c r a 
mee t ing in 2008, the proposed strategy p rov ides special emphasis t o increasing the scope o f 
development p o l i c y dialogue at the na t iona l level, strengthening and tak ing advantage o f coun t ry 
systems (when possible), we lcom ing and w o r k i n g with a l l the actors i n v o l v e d in development, 
deepening the w o r k i n g re la t ion with c i v i l society, concentrating in ach iev ing resu l ts , inc reas ing 
resu l ts ’ transparency and accountability, and con t inu ing t o base cond i t iona l i t y o n the countries’ 
development strategies. 
Risks. The m a i n risks t o this CPS emerge b o t h f r o m domestic and external factors. 
Domes t ic factors inc lude the need t o have closer coo rd ina t ion between p u b l i c sector agencies in 
order t o ensu re a mu l t i -sec to ra l approach t o development. Ex te rna l factors are the risk o f m a j o r 
external shocks that m a y inhibit the unde r tak ing o f p o l i c y changes. The Gove rnmen t has made 
progress over the recent years in m i t i g a t i n g m a n y o f these factors and the proposed CPS w i l l 
support actions t o fu r the r strengthening these m i t i g a t i o n actions. 
Execu t ive D i rec to rs m a y wish t o consider the f o l l ow i n g i s s u e s f o r discussion: 
I s the focus given to improving performance and p romo t ing accountability in the 
social sectors adequate in l igh t of 
the adverse effects that international f inanc ia l 
crisis may have in the DR? 
Are the risks we l l identiped and m i t iga t ing factors sufficient for assuring the 
likelihood of successful implementation?

situation n ow worsened b y the global economic financial c r i s i s ; (ii) extremely h i g h levels o f 
poverty and inequality and limited capacity to implement counter-cyclical social po l ic ies ; (iii) 
competitiveness challenges derived ma in ly from an i n e f f i c i e n t energy sector and l o w s k i l l s 
levels; and ( iv ) the negative implications o f climate change fo r the country’s important tourist 
industry. Moreover, the weakness o f public institutions - particularly w i t h respec t to their ab i l i ty 
to produce demonstrable resu l ts - adds to l ow levels o f t r u s t in Government. 
The DR a n d the B a n k Group have l o n g m a i n t a i n e d a close pa r tne rsh ip , but the 
t r a d i t i o n a l moda l i t ies o f engagement emp loyed so f a r have y ie lded only m i x e d r e s u l t s - 
suggesting the n e e d f o r new approaches. The Bank has generally been responsive to 
Government reques ts for knowledge services and financing, but implementation has been slow -

opportunity to move forward on a reform agenda. President Fernandez i s well pos i t ioned to 
imp lemen t a r e f o rm agenda that focuses o n addressing the energy c r i s is , fighting co r rup t ion and 
building ins t i tu t ions , and im p r o v i n g competitiveness and the inves tmen t c l ima te . 
6. President Fernandez recently convened a National Summit to define a long-term 
national development strategy. The process p rov ides a good oppo r tun i ty f o r consensus 
building and f o r a l ign ing the Bank ’s new CPS t o the coun t ry ’s priorities - as re f lec ted in the new 
na t iona l strategy. 
7. I n the context o f an ongoing Constitutional Reform, President Fernandez has signed an 
agreement with leaders of the opposition parties. This has he lped create consensus among 
p o l i t i c a l actors o n k e y i s s u e s inc luded in the Cons t i tu t iona l Re fo rm . Important e lemen ts include 
a l ignmen t o f the coun t ry ’s electoral calendar and e l im ina t ion o f the p res iden t ia l reelection clause‘ 
In order to a l i g n electoral calendars, those elected f o r Congress in 2010 w i l l serve f o r 6 years 
(instead o f 4). The e l im ina t ion o f the presidential ree lec t ion clause was approved in con junc t ion 
with the p o s s i b i l i t y o f the return o f presidents t o o f f i c e after one period outside Government.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

Recent Macroeconomic Developments 
8. I n the t w o years prior to the current international financial c r i s i s , the DR enjoyed 
strong economic growth - 10.7 percent in 2006 and 8.5 percent in 2007 - well above the Latin 
Ame r ican and Caribbean Reg ion (LCR ) reg iona l average (Tab le 1). G r ow t h in 2008 was about 
5 . 3 percent, s t i l l above the reg iona l average o f 4 .6 percent. Pos i t ive in te rna l and external factors 
supported this economic expansion. In te rna l ly , the Government implemented structural reforms 
t o enhance f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty : ra t iona l iz ing spending, im p r o v i n g revenue co l lec t ion and debt 
management, ins t i tu t iona l iz ing the budgetary process, and strengthening the f inanc ia l system. 
Fuelled by strong private consump t ion and investment demand, manu fac tu r ing and services - 
communications, commerce, tou r ism - grew strongly. Pos i t ive external factors inc luded strong 
g loba l growth and amp le fo re ign exchange i n f l ow s f r o m tourism, remittances, and foreign d i rec t 

investment. 

9 . During 2005-2007, the DR achieved positive results in terms of f isca l balances, debt and 
international reserves ratios, and inflation. The p r im a r y f isca l surplus reached 1 . 3 percentage 
po in ts o f GD P in 2007, up f r o m 0.6 percent and 0.4 percent in 2006 and 2005 respectively (Table 
1). This imp rovemen t was p r im a r i l y due t o increased revenues , boosted b y tax re fo rms and better 
revenue administration, as well as increased n i c k e l exports in 2007. Nonetheless, the tax base 
remained narrow, and p u b l i c expenditures have been s l ow l y rising as a percentage o f GD P s i n c e 
2005. La rge and p o o r l y targeted subsidy programs (for e lec t r ic i t y and l i q u e f i e d gas) were among 
the m a i n causes o f increased spending. 
10. 
For 2008, the ove ra l l deficit was 3.0 percent of GDP, and the primary deficit was 
estimated at about 1.2 percent of GDP, m a i n l y due t o increased subsidies starting in ea r ly 
2008 and t o increased spending in the run-up t o the M a y P res iden t ia l elections. T o a v o i d the full 
pass-through o f rising in te rna t iona l prices, the Gove rnmen t granted subsidies on f o o d i tems 
(bread, milk, rice, beans, eggs, and pou l t r y ) in the free trade zones, and on f u e l fo r un ion ized 
p u b l i c transportation and the transportation o f goods. These measures h a d high f isca l cos ts and 
undermined mac roeconom ic s tab i l i ty . The cost o f energy subsidies a lmos t doub led from 1.7 
percent o f GD P in 2007 to an estimated 3 percent in 2008, p r im a r i l y as a resu l t o f the spike in

in te rna t iona l o i l prices. A l t h o u g h n o precise measure i s available, energy transfers appear t o have 
been regressive and did not benefit the mos t vulnerable groups because wealthier people 
consume m o r e fue l . 
Although public-debt-to-GDP reached a high o f 49.3 percent o f GDP in 2003 
following the banking c r is is , this ratio has since declined significantly. B y 2008, i t was down 
t o 32.5 percent, because o f the 2005 res t ruc tu r ing o f sovereign external debt, r a p i d recent GDP 
growth, f a l l i n g real in te res t rates, and rea l exchange rate appreciation. Better basic f isca l 
management o n l y p layed a modest ro le . In add i t ion t o a lower debt leve l , the structure o f pub l ic 
debt has im p r o v e d with leng then ing ma tu r i t ies (especially f o r the certificates o f the Cen t ra l 
Bank ) and a higher share o f f i x e d in te res t rate debt. The Government’s target for the debt t o GDP 
r a t i o i s 25 percent b y 201 5, and this seemed read i ly attainable until the g loba l economic c r i s i s . 
12. 
Inflation declined from 51.5 percent in 2004 to 7.4 percent in 2007 and 8.3 percent in 
2008. In the a f te rma th o f the 2003 bank ing crisis, i n f l a t i o n was driven by excess liquidity 
f o l l o w i n g the bank ing collapse and subsequent ba i lou t , and was exacerbated b y the peso’s 
dep rec ia t ion due t o currency substitution. Prudent mone ta ry p o l i c y b rough t the r a p i d re tu rn to 
s ing le -d ig i t in f la t ion . I n contrast with this earlier period, external cond i t ions have been more 
impo r tan t f o r recen t in f la t ion . Since late 2007, when in te rna t iona l p r ice i n f l a t i o n accelerated, 
p r ices in the DR increased mo re r a p i d l y than the reg iona l average. Bes ides the pass-through f r o m 
in te rna t iona l prices, the increase in domestic f o o d prices was also related t o the t rop ica l storms 
N o e l and O l g a that hit the coun t ry at the end o f 2007 . 
13. Market capital inflows in 2003 to mid 2008 were sufficient to finance the current 
account deficit, which has widened recently, International reserves have improved relative 
to the period o f the banking c r i s i s and the exchange rate has been fairly stable since early 
2005. The current account de f ic i t has w idened considerably since 2006 because o f the 
comb ina t ion o f s low ing expo r t g r ow t h and rising im p o r t bills. Rea l expo r t g r ow t h averaged o n l y 
around 3 percent between 2003 and 2008, m a i n l y due t o dec l in ing n e t exports o f the Free Trade 
Zones (FTZ ) . Other exports have become m o r e diversified, as non - t rad i t iona l products and 
tou r ism services have substituted fo r tex t i les and other t rad i t iona l exports. Impo r ts grew r a p i d l y 
in 2006-07 and early 2008, due t o b o om i n g investment and consump t ion demand, a long with 
high in te rna t iona l prices. The DR remains h e a v i l y dependent o n energy impo r ts : o i l impo r ts 
equaled about ten percent o f GDP in 2007. Assuming f i x e d impo r ted quan t i t ies , a dec l ine o f 
U S $ l O in the average p r i ce o f a ba r re l o f o i l saves about U S 4 8 0 m i l l i o n in the im p o r t b i l l . 
14, 
After the domestic financial c r i s i s in 2003, foreign direct investment (FDI) made a 
robust recovery. I n f l ow s went p r im a r i l y t o the tou r ism , communications, commercial, and rea l 
estate sectors, FDI was the most s ign i f ican t component o f the cap i ta l account once again in 
2008, reach ing U S 2 . 9 b i l l i o n and cove r ing about th ree -qua r te rs o f the current account de f ic i t . 
FDI and other capital inflows compensated f o r a larger current account de f ic i t , and rese rves 
le ve ls did no t suffer. Strong remittance f l ow s (estimated at around ten percent o f G D P in re cen t 
years) have also been an impo r tan t source o f f o r e i g n exchange - a l though they contracted 
slightly in late 2008.

Med ium Term Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability 
15. Growth projections have been revised downwards as a result of the ongoing 
global economic c r i s i s and the slowdown in the US economy. Gove rnmen t estimates 
foresee a gradual s l ow d ow n t o about 2.5 percent GD P g r ow t h in 2009, with a recovery t o 
about 3.5-4.5 percent by 2010. Howeve r , this scenario m a y be op t im is t ic as recent data 
point t o a further de te r io ra t ion o f g loba l growth and trade. The Government i s w o r k i n g 
o n a l e s s op t im is t ic scenario w h i c h i s in line with the W o r l d Bank s ta f f forecasts reported 
in Tab le 1. A more rea l is t ic forecast f o r the DR i s about 0.5 percent g r ow t h in 2009 and, 
cond i t iona l o n an im p r o v e d external environment, o f about 2.3 percent f o r 2010-to be 
f o l l ow e d by a gradual return t o the l o n g t e r m g r ow t h po ten t ia l o f 5-6 percent in the outer 
years. P re l im ina ry data f o r the first quarter o f 2009 show g r ow t h o f 1 .O percent; however, 
this growth was achieved b y the expansion o f n o n tradable services w h i c h have reached 
capacity constraints and, given the s lowdown in investment ac t iv i t y , m a y not sus ta in 
g r ow t h g o i n g fo rwa rd . A c t i v i t i e s linked t o external demand and investment contracted 
s ign i f ican t l y during first quarter o f 2009: mining was down 74 percent, F T Z 
manu fac tu r ing 13 percent, hotels and restaurants ( tou r ism services) 8 percent, and 
cons t ruc t ion 22 percent. 
16. 
The economy’s performance i s highly dependent on external economic 
conditions. The coun t ry i s ve ry open as impo r ts plus exports equals 87 percent o f GD P 
(data corresponding t o 2007). I t depends heav i ly o n f o o d and energy impo r ts . The U.S. i s 
i t s mos t impo r tan t t rad ing partner, i t s m a i n source o f FDI (accounting f o r a third o f the 
total), t h e p redom inan t o r i g i n o f remittances, and a m a j o r source o f tourism revenues. 
Consequently, the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic g r ow t h cyc le i s s t rong ly correlated with that o f 
the U S . W o r l d B a n k s t a f f estimates suggest that a 1 percent reduc t ion in US g r ow t h 
leads o n average t o a 0.25 percentage p o i n t reduc t ion o f the DR’s growth, with a l a g o f 
about three quarters. 
17. 
External conditions also affect domestic inflation dynamics. Due t o the 
declines in the in te rna t iona l prices o f o i l and other commod i t ies , and in contrast t o the 
i n f l a t i o n spike o f the f i rs t h a l f o f 2008, i n f l a t i o n in the DR i s expected t o be in the range 
o f 5 and 7 percent f o r 2009 -1 1. 
18. Going forward, the external environment w i l l probably have more negative 
than positive effects on the DR’s external balances. Although dec l in ing in te rna t iona l 
commod i ty p r ices w i l l r e l i e v e pressure o n im p o r t costs, the g loba l economic s lowdown 
and l ow e r demand from N o r t h Ame r ica and Eu rope w i l l reduce revenues from exports, 
remittances, and tou r ism . 
19. While the Dominican Republic received large inflows of foreign capital 
during 2008; lower global growth, tighter international liquidity conditions, and 
greater risk aversion o f investors may substantially reduce capital inflows in the 
near future. During the f i r s t pa r t o f 2009, the s ign i f ican t reduc t ion o f the value o f 
impo r ted commod i t ies has counterbalanced the pa ra l le l decrease o f fo re ign exchange 
i n f l ow s and, in recent months, the D om i n i c a n peso has ma in ta ined a stable course vis-a- 
vis the US do l la r and other currencies. Howeve r , given i t s s t ruc tu ra l ly la rge trade d e f i c i t s , 
the coun t ry has t o rely heav i ly o n cap i ta l inflows t o balance i t s ex te rna l accounts. 
Acco rd ing t o o f f i c i a l sources, a la rge investment p ro jec t in the mining sector i s in the 
pipeline f o r 2009. I f realized, this investment should help in weathering the global

environment. The degree o f uncertainty around this investment i s l im i ted given that the 
2 0 0 9 inflows are part of a much larger investment plan: across several years, the m in ing 
investment p lan amounts to about US $ 3 . 6 b i l l i o n and US$700 m i l l i o n have already been 
invested 
in 2 0 0 8 . Nonetheless, uncertainty remains: when compared w i t h the 
corresponding period of 2008 , FDI in the first quarter o f 2009 contracted b y 41 percent. 
2 0 . 
T h e e x t e r n a l f i n a n c i n g needs fo r 2009 a n d f u t u r e yea rs a r e subs tan t ia l but 
they c o u l d b e m e t . The situation remains delicate: international l iqu id i ty i s s t i l l scarce 
and bo r row ing costs for the D R are high; the country i s vulnerable to external price 
shocks, and f i s c a l expenditures in excess o f what can be securely financed could c rea te 
additional pressure . Given the l im i ted amount o f reserves and their current loose 
monetary po l icy (adequate to counter the slowdown o f the economy), authorities are 
aware o f the limits of their current macroeconomic po l icy stance and are monitoring 
economic developments closely. 
21. 
G i v e n i t s fiscal s i tua t ion , t h e DR has l i t t l e r o o m f o r m a n e u v e r t o coun te r t h e 
i n t e r n a t i o n a l f i n a n c i a l c r i s i s a n d t h e g l o b a l s lowdown . For 2 0 0 9 , the Government, in 
accordance with the I M F Post Program Mon i to r ing mission o f November 2008 , has 
targeted an overall fiscal deficit o f 1.7 percent o f GDP, but the deficit w i l l most l ike l y be 
larger and in the range o f 2 .5 -3 percent o f GDP. This deficit i s consistent with: (a) slower 
economic activity causing lower tax revenues, (b) forecasted lower international 
commodity prices, (c) forthcoming debt servicing, and (d) the financing available f rom 
international financial organizations. Maintaining f i s c a l discipline should crea te some 
space to ease monetary po l icy . Du r ing the f i rs t months o f 2 0 0 9 , the Central Bank has 
already reduced i t s po l icy rates four times; currently (June 2 0 0 9 ) the po l icy rate 
(overnight ra te) i s at f ive percent, down f rom 9 .5 percent at the end o f 2 0 0 8 . Add i t iona l 
measures to increase l iqu id i ty in the economy include a lower legal reserve amount in 
banks. This change 
in the macroeconomic po l icy m i x should provide some 
countercyclical stimulus, but the e f f e c t s o f a looser monetary po l icy come w i t h a lag and 
private credit, a f te r more than 15 months o f negative growth has just recently (June 2 0 0 9 ) 
shown some positive signs o f expansion. The other ma in direct consequence o f the more 
flexible monetary po l icy has been the reduction o f market in te res t rates which decreased 
f rom around 14 percent at the end o f 2 0 0 9 to about ten pe rcen t b y end o f Ma rch 2 0 0 9 . 
Further reductions may be possible but external conditions may limit the po l icy o f 
reducing in te res t rates, especially given the commitment o f the Central B a n k to stability 
o f the peso and control in f la t ion (see also paragraph 2 0 ) . 
2 2 . 
As expected , g iven t h e con t rac t ion o f g l o b a l and domes t ic econom ic ac t iv i ty , 
f isca l revenues dec reased in t h e first m o n t h s o f 2009 ; this coup led w i t h a l a r g e r than 
b u d g e t e d e lec t r ic i ty sector de f ic i t has c rea ted conce rns a b o u t a f isca l f i n a n c i n g gap . 
The budget for 2 0 0 9 was designed w i t h the fo l low ing assumptions (annual ra tes for 
2 0 0 9 ) : (i) real GDP growth o f 2 .5 percent, (ii) in f la t ion o f 5 to 6 percent, (iii) o i l p r ice o f 
69 .8 US$/barrel, and ( iv ) US GDP growth o f -0 .6 percent. Under these assumptions the 
overall deficit was projected at 1.7 percent o f GDP. However, the situation has 
deteriorated and these i n i t i a l assumptions may need to be revised. As shown in Table 2 , 
revenue flows fo r the first quarter o f 2009 are w e l l be low those o f the same period a year 
earlier and below what authorities had expected. I f current trends continue fo r the r e s t o f 
the year, the gap in total revenues i s estimated to reach about US$400 m i l l i o n (Table 3 ) . 
On the expenditures s ide the downside scenario has a larger deficit for the electricity

sector. The Government budget f o r the e lec t r ic i ty sector in 2009 includes about US$350 
m i l l i o n f o r current expenditures and US$70 m i l l i o n f o r inves tmen t expenditures, to ta l ing 
about U S 4 2 0 m i l l i o n . The latest estimates put the e lec t r ic i ty sector d e f i c i t in the range 
o f US $ 5 5 0 t o US$700 million. 
23. 
Expenditures have fallen in the first half o f 2009 , notably in goods and 
services and public investments (almost 50 percent reduc t ion acco rd ing t o the data 
reported in Tab le 2). This reduc t ion in expenditures may have helped t o a v o i d a cash 
f l o w p rob lem ; however, i t may also act as a p ro - cyc l ica l f isca l cut wh ich , in turn, m a y 
further hamper economic g row th . F inanc ing sources have also changed; the 2009 budget 
requ i red about US$2 b i l l i o n in f inanc ing (Table 3), t o be covered b y domestic b o r r ow i n g 
(about US$500 million) and external b o r r ow i n g f r o m IFIs and b i la te ra l institutions. The 
external f inanc ing f r o m PetroCaribe i s likely t o f a l l short by an estimated US$65 m i l l i o n 
due t o l ow e r than anticipated o i l prices. The cumu la t ive e f fec t o f these changes amounts 
t o a f isca l f inanc ing gap o f about US$700 m i l l i o n f o r 2009. 
24. 
The Government has taken some initial steps to fund its financing gap. 
Nonetheless, there i s short term uncertainty and medium term viability i s yet to be 
ascertained. The Government’s p l a n consists o f (i) comp le t ion o f the sale o f p u b l i c 
assets; the Government has p u b l i c l y announced that i t has entered the f i n a l phase o f a 
nego t ia t ion f o r the sale o f a refinery to the Government o f Venezuela f o r the p r i c e o f U S $ 
130 m i l l i o n ; (ii) imp lemen ta t ion o f e lec t r ic i t y sector reforms-which 
the Government 
estimates t o con ta in the e lec t r ic i ty sector’s d e f i c i t within US$150 million; (iii) increase in 
the f l ow s o f b i la te ra l loans; authorities have mentioned a possible agreement with the 
Government o f Co lomb ia t o finance purchases o f coal; and (iv) issuance o f sovereign 
bonds f o r an amount o f up to US$1 b i l l ion , US$500 m i l l i o n t o be p laced in 2009 and the 
res t in 2010. The Au tho r i t ies have ind ica ted that they w i l l consider maturity in the range 
o f 5 t o 10 years and that they expect interest rates in the range o f 10 t o 15 percent. The 
current y i e l d fo r D om i n i c a n sovereign bonds i s o f about 1 1 percent. L a t i n Ame r ican and 
Caribbean countries have issued sovereign bonds in 2009 f o r a to ta l o f about US $ 7 
b i l l i o n : Co lomb ia (3 issuances in April and January f o r a to ta l o f US$ 3 b i l l i o n at 10 
years, at an average in te res t rate o f 450 basis po in ts above US treasury), B r a z i l ( 1

M e x i c o (1 issuance in Feb rua ry f o r US$ 1.5 b i l l i o n , at 5 years, at 425 basis points above

UST) and Panama (1 issuance f o r US$ 323 m i l l i o n , at 6 years, at an i n t e r e s t rate o f 7.04

26. 
I n terms o f long term sustainability, the viability o f the plan to cove r the 
fiscal financing gap, and in particular the issuance o f sovereign bonds will depend 
on (i) future growth, (ii) further improvements in the quality and control of public

I n summary, declining revenues, a higher energy sector deficit, and declining 
funding from PetroCaribe imply a risky situation. The Government understands these 

risks and recognizes that the control and quality o f spending i s a key too l to prevent a 
hard landing. However, at least in the recent past, imp rov ing the quality o f spending has 
been a challenge.

Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the DR public debt appears to 
be on a sustainable path. At about 34 percent in 2008, the pub l ic -deb t - to -GDP ra t io i s 
not h i g h by reg iona l standards, but the Government aims t o continue o n a pa th t o b r i n g

debt t o G D P ra t io w i l l no t be reduced in 2009, a year during w h i c h the f isca l stance w i l l 
be counterbalancing, in a measured manner, the g loba l s lowdown . A f t e r 2010, however, 
when g loba l external cond i t ions are p ro jec ted t o imp rove , the Gove rnmen t shou ld be able

In the medium te rm , external debt w i l l p robab ly decline as a share o f GDP, 
because the current account should imp rove as a result o f (a) l ow e r in te rna t iona l pr ices , 
(b) slower economic ac t iv i ty reduc ing demand f o r impo r ts , (c) prudent macroeconomic 
po l ic ies and (d) a stable real exchange rate. F inanc ing from IFIs and FDI shou ld be 
su f f ic ien t t o cover the forecasted current account de f ic i t in the nex t few years.' 
30. 
The domestic financial system i s vulnerable to the possibility o f further 
deterioration in the domestic o r international environment. The sector was r e s i l i e n t in 
2008, in the face o f rising in te res t rates f r o m a res t r ic t ive mone ta ry p o l i c y . With l ow 
in te rna t iona l reserves , a large f isca l d e f i c i t and ve ry high peso in te re s t rates, however, the 
authorities have l i t t l e r o o m t o dampen the impac t o f the c r is is on the coun t ry 's p roduc t ive 
and f inanc ia l sectors.

The banking system's low-cost funding base does not face a significant threat 
o f sudden deposit withdrawals, because deposits a r e mostly small and domestic. 
Howeve r , i f the central bank were fo rced t o raise in te re s t rates d rama t ica l ly in response t o

Government authorities are engaged in a dialogue with the IMF on the 
medium-term macroeconomic situation. An IMF m iss ion was in the coun t ry the week

macroeconomic s i tua t ion and exp lo re the poss ib i l i t ies o f IMF support t o the coun t ry .

Two macroeconomic scenarios can be envisaged f o r medium-term. A first 
scenario i s that a pos i t ive outcome o f the dialogue men t ioned in the above paragraph w i l l 
result in to a mu l t i yea r support p rog ram o f the IMF w h i c h w i l l help the coun t ry reduce the 
short-term macroeconomic risks. A second scenario w i l l be one where the authorities w i l l 
no t have negotiated a p rog ram with the IMF, but they w i l l s t i l l have been able to secure 
enough f inanc ing t o cover their f isca l and external needs and thus achieved a medium 
t e r m sustainable mac ro balance. In b o t h cases the mac ro s i tua t ion w i l l be adequate for the

34. 
I n summary, on the one hand, the country i s facing a downturn and serious 
short-term risks - including facing liquidity constraints to balance its fiscal and 
external accounts - associated with the difficult global environment. I t s sma l l open 
economy, high dependency o n commod i t y impo r t s and strong economic l i n k s with the 
US make the coun t ry pa r t i cu la r ly vulnerable t o a p ro longed g loba l recession and swings 
in c omm o d i t y prices. Under these circumstances, a challenge f o r the authorities w i l l 
consist o f securing f inanc ing t o cover their f isca l and external needs and that this 
add i t iona l debt w i l l not compromise the medium t e r m mac ro f ramewo rk . On the other 
hand, the DR has recorded growth rates well above the regional average and, as in 
the recent case o f the bank ing c r is is o f 2003, has been able to quickly regain sustained 
economic expansion after a down tu rn . I n the recent period, i t has been able to greatly 
reduce i t s deb t - to -GDP ratio, t o con ta in in f la t ion , t o attract exceptional l e v e l o f FD I f l ow s

GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS: CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES 

35. While progress was made during the 
last 5 years, the governance 
environment in the DR i s complex and singled out by many as one o f the country’s 
main overarching obstacles to achieving sustainable, equitable and inclusive growth. 
As exp la ined in greater de ta i l in Annex 7 , the DR has made good progress in passing 
impo r tan t re fo rms that redefine the r o l e o f the institutions i n v o l v e d in the planning and 
budge t ing process (e.g. 2006 Organic L a w o n the Pub l ic Sector Budget, 2006 Creation o f 
State Secretariats f o r Treasury and Economy , P lann ing and Deve lopmen t , 2007 F inanc ia l 
A dm i n i s t r a t i o n System o f the State Law , 2006 Pub l ic C red i t L aw , 2006 P lann ing and 
Investment Law , 2006 Government Procurement and Con t rac t ing Law , 2007 
Establishment o f the In te rna l C o n t r o l System Law ) . 
Howeve r , the coun t ry i s 
characterized b y a strong Presidential system with few checks and balances o n the 
executive and where c r i t i c a l re fo rms are being implemented t o strengthen the pub l ic 
f inanc ia l management f ramewo rk . Congress and the Supreme Audit Institution have 
limited technical capacity t o p l a y their ove rs igh t func t ion , med ia sc ru t iny i s s t i l l weak, 
independence o f the j u d i c i a r y cou ld be strengthened, and c i v i l society (although 
inc reas ing ly active) has limited powe r t o h o l d the government accountable. 
The limited capacity of public institutions to produce tangible results - added 
36. 
to a public perception of corruption, in public institutions - may contribute to low 
leve ls of trust in Government. While progress has been made, especially in the design 
o f a new ins t i tu t iona l architecture f o r the State, imp lemen ta t ion o f these re fo rms i s s t i l l 
limited and there are few related tangible benefits f o r the popu la t ion . The imp lemen ta t ion 
o f many o f these laws has been s low and seems t o depend very much on the spec i f ic 
in te res t o f the concerned Ministry. This s i tua t ion and a pe rcep t ion by many citizens o f 
co r rup t ion and impunity m a y be further e rod ing an a l ready - low trust in Government, 

This assessment w i l l need to be confirmed closer to the Board date with particular reference t o the 
implementation results o f the authorities’ plan to c lose the financing gap - a key element in this judgment.

DR lags behind in average years o f education, despite a h i g h number o f years spent in

Mo r eo v e r , while some pro-poor programs a re showing good results, soc ia l 
safety nets continue to be pro-cyclical making it difficult to protect the poor during 
periodic economic downturns. Solidaridad - a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) 

program - has made progress in targeting the poor and has demonstrated value added for 
p rov id ing poor fam i l ies w i t h targeted subsidies. The program needs to continue 
strengthening i ts targeting mechanisms, expand coverage, ensure additional levels o f 
transparency, and put sound monitoring and evaluation schemes in place. Similarly, the 
education and health sector need to strengthen their o w n contribution to the goals o f the 
program in t e r m s o f the supply o f adequate services and mon i to r ing o f co-responsibility. 

44. 
I n soc ia l protection, key pending challenges and areas of reform w i l l need to 
be addressed, i f the Government’s soc ia l assistance response to the c r i s i s i s to be 
more inclusive, effective, efficient and transparent. First, the amount and coverage o f 

existing and new safety n e t s may be insufficient to mitigate the impact o f the c r i s i s on the 
poorest and vulnerable and second, the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency o f the 
social assistance system c a n be improved. Recent process evaluations f rom the IDB and 
UNDP point to a program which i s at risk o f losing i t s focus as a result o f multiple 
demands suggesting the need to further revamp Solidaridad. The program needs a 
strategic redefinition o f goals, priorities and a full process o f de-concentration (by 
p rov id ing more autonomy and strengthening coordination mechanisms to service 
providers at lower levels) to wo rk more effectively at loca l level. 

45. 
Gender. Problems remain in the inequitable access of men and women to 
health, education, and labor market participation. Even though the country has 

adopted a s e r i e s o f legal and institutional measures aimed at imp rov ing the legal status o f 
women in terms o f labor law, c i v i l law and land reform, as w e l l as protection f rom 
domestic violence b y special provisions in the c r im ina l law, active programs to enforce 
and promote these regulations are s t i l l very much needed. M u c h remains to be done in 
terms o f enhancement o f reproductive and maternal health, especially fo r young women, 
as we l l as more intensive campaigns to prevent and reduce the incidence o f H IV , fo r both 
sexes. Special programs are needed to promote the permanence at school o f boys and 
girls f rom poor households so that they escape the vicious circle o f early adoption o f

46. 
Broadening the current menu of labor-based interventions i s necessary with 
a strong focus on vulnerable youth. The DR has one o f the most success fu l youth 
employment training programs in the region, but more needs to be done. Active labor 
market responses for vulnerable groups who currently are not targeted are needed 
(current programs only target youth), as we l l as the improvement o f intermediation 
services fo r employment and placement o f labor. In addition, emergency income 
generation for low -sk i l led workers (mostly in the in fo rma l economy) who may be hit b y 
the c r i s i s need to be explored. These actions should include a strong emphasis on 
targeting the youth Unemployment o f those 16 to 24 years o ld i s 30 per cen t compared 
to an already h i g h national unemployment ra te o f 15 per cen t . There i s also a gender 
dimension to labor markets. Labor fo rce participation i s much lower among women (49.6

depends directly on future growth and the willingness and ab i l i ty o f the Government to 
effectively direct resources to address social i s s u e s . MDG projections (Table 5) indicate 
that the country w i l l probably be able to halve the number o f people l i v i n g under U S $ 1 
PPP per day, but i t i s un l ike ly that poverty, as defined b y the national poverty l ine , w i l l 
also be reduced in half. I t i s also un l ike ly that the country w i l l be able to achieve a l l 
MDGs simultaneously because i t wou ld require a sweeping increase in health and 
education expenditures beyond the current trends in these variables (base scenario). An 
alternative scenario that assumes a r i s e in total health expenditures f rom 1 per cen t o f 
GDP in 2004 to 5 .3 percent o f GDP in 2015 wou ld render resu l ts very c lose to the goals 
in bo th education and heath, but i t s impact on poverty and economic growth w i l l depend 
on how the surge in social expenditures i s financed.

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

49, 
In addition to the macroeconomic, governance, and poverty and inequality 
challenges discussed above, the DR faces other significant development challenges. 
50. 
Strengthened financial sector supervision and regulation and what appears 
at present to be a well capitalized and profitable banking s e c to r a r e notable 
achievements. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) are at modest l e v e l s , and are adequately 
provisioned. Twenty eight application norms o f the Monetary and Financial L a w (MF L )

51. 
The energy sector continues to pose 
important challenges to 
f isca l 
sustainability and competitiveness. W h i l e losses dec l ined between 2004 and 2008 and 
the cash recove ry index o f d is t r ibu t ion companies imp roved f r o m 45 percent to 64 
percent over the same period, key aspects o f the powe r sector deteriorated. Ta r i f fs were 
f rozen in September 2006 and t a r i f f increases were imp lemen ted in June and Ju ly 2009 
amoun t ing to 12.5 percent. Howeve r , as o i l prices rose s ign i f ican t ly , the gap between the

Looking forward, recently, progress has been made in implementing a se r ies 
of key reforms in the context of a high-level dialogue with the President, the IDB 
and the World Bank. In addition to the adjustment in ta r i f fs , the regionally defined 
subsidy (PRA) was eliminated and the Government i s creating a targeted subsidy fo r the 
poor. However, challenges remain. On ly 3 8 per cen t o f the consumers are “typical” 
payers - wh i le 62 per cen t o f them either are heavily subsidized or use electricity without 
paying for i t . Ac t ion i s needed in key areas, notably to ensure the financial sustainability 
o f a l l agents in the power chain - f rom generation to distribution - by : (i) rationalizing 
the t a r i f f scheme to promote efficiency, imp rov ing cost recovery, and p rov id ing revenues 
to f inance investments; (ii) consolidating and deepening loss reduction and efficiency 
gains in distribution companies; and (iii) promoting investment in lower cost generation 
in order to reduce o i l dependency. Imp rov ing the investment c l ima te and the DR’s ab i l i ty 
to attract new investments w i l l be important. A comprehensive action plan to r e f o rm the 
electricity sector in the DR i s currently being discussed with Government counterparts. 
This plan includes actions in seven areas: (i) tariffs, (ii) subsidies, (iii) loses , ( iv ) u t i l i t i e s 
efficiency, (v) institutional design to improve governance o f the sector, (v i ) a new 
payment mechanism for the country’s electricity b i l l (escrow mechanism) to increase 
levels o f transparency, and (v i i ) supply-side investments. 
53 : 
The f isca l position o f the Government has suffered for years from the cost o f 
subsidies to the energy sector, and the policies supported by a Public Finance and 
Soc ia l Sectors DPL will help reduce those costs. E lec t r ic i ty subsidies in recen t years 
took five-to-ten percent o f public spending (close to 3 pe rcen t o f GDP), and the latest 
reforms w i l l reduce the cost b y ha l f . Subsidies for l i q u i d gas were costing over 0.6 
percent o f GDP, and projected down to 0.2 percent in 2009 w i t h the latest reforms. 
Specifically, this loan supports measures in electricity tariffs and subsidies aiming at

reducing the size o f the d e f i c i t o f the e lec t r ic i ty sector by supporting fou r k e y actions: (i) 
increase tariffs t o reduce the gap between r e t a i l prices and the current costs o f service; (ii) 
simplify the t a r i f f structure; (iii) reduce the consump t ion threshold f o r t a r i f f subsidy; and 
(iv) re tu rn t o a flexible t a r i f f system in w h i c h prices re f lec t chang ing costs. An increase in 
t a r i f f s o f around 12.5 percent accompanied by the actions proposed in terms o f 
s im p l i f i c a t i o n o f t a r i f f b locks and reduc t ion in the consump t ion threshold for t a r i f f 
subsidy, shou ld generate add i t iona l revenues f o r system o f around US$ 120 m i l l i o n a 
year (some US $ 6 0 million f o r the second h a l f o f 2009). In addition, the imp rovemen t in 
the Cash Recove ry Index (CR I ) represen ts US$ 15 m i l l i o n f o r each p o i n t in C R I increase. 
Hence, 3 add i t iona l C R I points before the end o f the year, w o u l d r e s u l t in a reduc t ion o f 
the d e f i c i t o f about US$45 m i l l i o n . In addition, this D P L supports re fo rms to 
adm in is t ra t ion o f in te rna l revenues (including the l i n k s with Customs) w i l l also have a 
modest pos i t ive impac t o n the f isca l picture, a l though in the short t e r m this i s be ing 
ove rwhe lmed b y the decline in ove ra l l taxable ac t iv i ty , due t o the economic c r is is . Ove r

economic g row th . 
54 . 
Improving trade facilitation and logistics i s another key challenge if the DR i s 
to take full advantage o f the recent DR -CAFTA agreement and improve the 
country’s overall competitiveness. Log is t ics pe rcep t ion ind ices demonstrate that DR 
fa l ls behind m a n y Caribbean and Cen t ra l Ame r ican countries in terms o f customs, 
infrastructure, ease o f entry and monitoring. Econom ic analysis con f i rms the rea l i t y o f 
this perception. A comparative analysis has shown that g iven i t s l e v e l o f economic 
development, DR performs b e l ow i t s expected performance l e v e l in terms o f log is t ic s (in 
“Connecting t o Compete” - Jean-Francois Arvis et al, The W o r l d Bank , 2007). This 
translates i n t o high log is t ics costs, larger inventories, a h ighe r percentage o f goods that 
d o n o t a r r ive at their destined markets and l ow e r ove ra l l connec t iv i ty . This, in turn, leads 
t o p r i c e d is to r t ion o f goods and shipping costs and u l t ima te ly affects the demand f o r

Climate change i s increasing vulnerability, affecting one o f the country’s 
main engines for growth. The D om i n i c a n Repub l ic ’s re la t ive ly weak watershed

The contribution o f agriculture, the fourth-largest sector, has fallen in the

The FY05-FY09 CAS had an “overarching focus on improving governance 
and strengthening institutions” to help restore confidence in the country and restore 
growth. The IBRD lending p rog ram was US$260 m i l l i o n in the base case (plus US$15 
m i l l i o n f r o m GEF, n o t inc lud ing a Carbon Finance proposal). Th rough FY08, the B a n k

LESSONS 

FROM THE FY06-FY09 CAS AND STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION 

61. 
Several lessons m a y be derived f r o m the Bank ’s engagement in the DR, no tab ly 
f r o m the C A S Comp le t ion Report, the Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performance Review (CPPR), 
the consu l ta t ive process with c i v i l society and p r iva te sector leaders, and the ongo ing 
dialogue with other in te rna t iona l development agencies. W h i l e Annex 3 p resen ts a 
broader analysis o f these lessons, the f o l l ow i n g key messages emerge. 
The lessons that emerge f r om the CAS Completion Report include the need to : 
60. 
(i) focus on a few k e y sectors where there i s po ten t ia l for success and where B a n k advice 
i s appreciated; (ii) se t rea l is t ic and measurable ob jec t ives and targets; (iii) focus pub l ic 
sector r e f o rm o n ma in ta in ing accoun tab i l i ty and transparency in Gove rnmen t operations, 
i n c l u d i n g budget fo rmu la t ion and execution, and inc reas ing the vo ice o f c i v i l society; ( iv ) 
adopt a comprehensive approach and inc lude p o l i t i c a l economy dimensions when dea l ing 
with the energy sector, (v) use ESW t o focus o n in t rac tab le p rob lems l i k e co r rup t ion , 
drugs, money laundering, c r ime and violence, and p u b l i c sector reform; (vi) conduct 
ESW coope ra t ive ly with partners in country, so as t o build ownership and l o c a l capacity, 
(vii) strengthen c i v i l society capacity t o build a cons t i tuency f o r re fo rms and strengthen 
the B a n k engagement with Congress t o deal with comp lex development challenges in the 
country; and ( v i i i ) strengthen donor coo rd ina t ion by mapp ing donor’s in te rven t ions and 
p r i o r i t y areas as well as a l ign ing e f fo r ts f o r p o l i c y re fo rm . D u r i n g this period the 
Government has pa r t icu la r ly recognized B a n k support in the f o l l ow i n g areas: (i) the ro le 
played b y the B a n k during the 2003 f inanc ia l c r is is and in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
Pub l ic I n f o rm a t i o n L a w and, (ii) the support given t o Gove rnmen t in the preparation o f

the development strategy through the delivery o f 9 po l icy notes and the identification and 
t ra in ing on methodologies for p r io r i t iz ing po l icy options. 
6 1 . 
In February 2008 , the Bank and the Government engaged in a j o i n t (CPPR). This 
exercise highlighted clearly implementation issues , such as delays in effectiveness and 
disbursement. The CPPR also identified ways to address i s s u e s related to investment 
operations. Specifically, a taskforce was created comprising representatives o f Finance, 
Economy and Planning, the Bank - and as needed - f rom ind iv idua l executing agencies. 
This taskforce i s now mapping both Government and Bank procedures and w i l l propose 
recommendations to streamline these procedures where possible. The group i s also 
exploring ways to inc rease the technical capacity o f project implementation units and to 
reduce personnel turnover. Look ing forward, given their strategic value in the context o f 
the new CPS, the next CPPR w i l l incorporate A A A as part o f the review. 
6 2 . 
A se r ies o f consu ltat ions w i t h c i v i l society on the CPS took place in the DR, in 
January 2009 . Over 200 organizations participated in 4 country-wide consultations that 
were held in L a Romana, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Barahona. The ma in messages 
emerging f rom these consultations include: (i) c i v i l society organizations recognized the 
value added o f the Bank in the DR as a strategic partner for development; (ii) strong 
in te res t in partnering w i t h the Bank; (iii) shared understanding o f the current 
development challenges to be addressed in the next 4 years. In addition a C l i e n t S u r v e y 
was administered to 300 key stakeholders in the DR in early 2009 . I t s resu l ts point to the 
need to continue the Bank’s focus o n poverty reduction and to strengthen the Bank’s 
focus on education and governance. 
63 . 
Finally, a special coordination meeting w i t h o t h e r i n t e r n a t i o n a l deve lopmen t 
agenc ies operating in the D R was held in November, 2008 . Mos t participants agreed that 
donor actions in the D R should be guided b y the need to strengthen institutions and 
improve governance in the country given the importance o f these areas in addressing the 
country’s development challenges. At a f o l l ow up meeting held in February 2009 , over 
1 5 agencies engaged in an exercise to iden t i fy the most relevant po l icy reforms and 
conduct a harmonization exercise (Annex 8).

policy-based lending. W BG synergies w i l l enhance this f lex ib le approach a l low ing for 

the use o f diverse instruments. 

66. 
The new strategy places a stronger emphasis on strengthening soc ia l cohesion 
and improving access and quality of soc ia l serv ices . G iven that growth has not 
resulted in commensurate gains on the social front, the new CPS pays spec ia l attention t o 
increasing the human capital o f the poor and facilitates their access to finance and basic 
services - both as a m i t iga t ion factor during the c r i s i s and as a medium-term strategic 
investment for addressing development challenges in the country. The previous CAS 
showed that having strong social safety ne t s in p lace i s c r i t ica l for m i t iga t ing the negative 
effects o f a c r is is , as witnessed during the 2003 financial c r i s is . In addition, the new CPS 
w i l l support the country in generating more inclusive growth, that can translate in to lower 
levels o f poverty and inequality. Finally, spec ia l attention w i l l be g iven to gender i s s u e s , 
b y inc lud ing this dimension in lending operations, AAA, and po l i cy dialogue at a l l levels. 
67. 
Based on lessons from the previous period, the new CPS w i l l tackle 
governance and institutional development issues from the “Quality and Efficiency of 
Public Expenditures” angle. The approach o f the previous CAS w i t h respec t to 
governance i s s u e s yielded m ixed re su l t s . Given the progress made in the design and 
implementation o f a new institutional model for planning and budgeting, clear entry 
points now exist to address governance issues . Specifically, the new CPS w i l l support 
SEEPyD, the Secretary o f Finance, selected spending ministries and Congress on i s s u e s 
re la ted to quality and efficiency o f public expenditures. The Bank i s already supporting 
the Government o n performance informed budgeting, p rov id ing techn ica l assistance to 
the Ministries o f Education and Hea l th on results-based management, and strengthening 
Congress’s oversight capacity on budget execution. C i v i l society and other donors have 
expressed strong demand fo r the Bank’s support to this agenda, wh ich in turn may help 
address underlying governance issues . 
68 . 
Past Bank engagement in the energy sector in the DR highlights the need to 
do things differently. Recent efforts have not improved the sector’s 
financial 
sustainability, due p r inc ipa l ly to the confluence o f an unfavorable external environment 
and o f Government’s fa i lu re to f u l l y r e f l e c t higher generation costs in retail t a r i f f s and to 
further reduce losses . Add i t iona l efforts are needed to consolidate the modest gains 
achieved during the las t CAS period and launch reforms wh ich w i l l put the sector on a 
sound footing and foster more rapid economic growth and greater competitiveness. The 
new CPS supports a new j o i n t Bank/IFC approach to the energy sector b y (i) conducting 
an analysis o f lessons f rom energy sector re fo rm over the past period (including the 
po l i t ica l economy dynamics), and (ii) supporting additional reforms in the sector. Three 
prongs w i l l guide the Bank Group’s work: (a) an intensive engagement w i t h stakeholders 
to establish a new “energy equation”, (b) a comprehensive approach to energy sector 
reform, and (c) support o f private sector investments. In addition, special attention w i l l 
be given to reducing external vulnerability, access to electricity b y the poor, and the 
development o f a c lean energy matrix. 
6 9 . 
The DR and the Bank Group have long maintained a c lose partnership, but 
the traditional modalities o f engagement employed so far have yielded only mixed 
results - suggesting the need for new approaches. Rather than having a number o f 
stand-alone activities, the proposed strategy wou ld be based on a proprammatic approach 
that w i l l provide continuity and direction to the Government re fo rm agenda. This w i l l

include a combination o f investment and policy-based lending, and a strong emphasis on 
analytical wo rk - both in terms o f ESW and Non-Lending Technical Assistance 
(NLTAs). W h i l e po l icy based 
lending w i l l support the country’s continuing 
implementation o f the reform agenda and provide the Government w i t h l iqu id i ty during 
the international f inanc ia l c r is is , a combination o f investment lending and AAA w i l l help 
strengthen capacity to addressing development i s s u e s in the country. These A A A 
products are included as activities to support the four strategic objectives o f the CPS. 
Annex 6 p resen ts a comprehensive l i s t o f the identified AAA fo r each o f the strategic 
objectives o f the proposed CPS and their existing and potential sources o f funding. W h i l e 
experience in the DR shows that a more programmatic approach towards policy-based 
lending and knowledge sharing i s needed, experience in the region shows that investing 
in a strong knowledge agenda i s necessary for sustaining innovation and making po l icy - 
based lending more effective. B y p rov id ing a more flexible approach and investing 
heavily in capacity bu i ld ing o f Government counterparts, this strategy w i l l help avoid the 
identified “bottlenecks” in t e r m s o f effectiveness and disbursement delays. 
70. 
IFC’s strategy during the upcoming CPS period w i l l be two-fold: 
P r io r i ty areas w i l l be the underserved segments o f the market, the ones having the 
highest impact on the bottom o f the pyramid. Reaching out to Microenterprises 
and SMEs w i l l be a key objective. 
Implied areas o f intervention w i l l include 
access to f inance (trade, microfinance and SMEs), imp rov ing the business 
environment (Doing Business Reform, Corporate Governance), access to basic 
infrastructure, and sustainable tourism development. Add i t iona l resources w i l l 
support opportunities arising in other growth and income generating sectors 
(agribusiness, general manufacturing, and so on.) when leading to sustainable 
private sector investment. 
Responding to the cu r ren t financial c r i s is , I FC w i l l place a particular focus on 
existing c l i e n t s and shorter t e r m financing (notably trade financing) and w i l l keep 
a particular attention to p r io r i ty areas (microfinance, SMEs, and infrastructure 
services). The concern w i l l be to maintain the latest development gains among 
the underserved. 
71, W i t h i n the above strategic framework, IFC investment and advisory actions are 
expected to include climate change m i t iga t ion (e.g. energy efficiency and renewable 
energy), raising sustainability standards (environment, social, and corporate governance), 
and linkages (e.g. SMEs, and so on).

75 . 

This first strategic ob jec t ive o f the CPS supports the DR in p ro tec t ing the 
vulnerable segments o f the popu la t ion f rom the effects o f the in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l crisis 
and p roduc ing better social outcomes, especially f o r the poorest D om i n i c a n citizens. This 
ob jec t ive i s fully a l igned with the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy that calls fo r 
b roaden ing good -qua l i ty emp loymen t opportunities, 
reduc ing pove r ty , p ro tec t ing

Solidaridad, and p r o v i d i n g better education qua l i ty and un ive rsa l access t o hea l th

inc luded under this strategic ob jec t ive w i l l support the 
Government in ach iev ing four m a i n strategic outcomes: (i) im p r o v e d effectiveness o f the 
social p ro tec t ion system in preserving and p r om o t i n g human cap i ta l f o r the poorest 
Dom in icans ; (ii) im p r o v e d qua l i ty o f mo the r and c h i l d healthcare services; (iii) increased 
access t o and qua l i ty o f education; and (iv) im p r o v e d emp loyab i l i ty o f the poo r -a t - r isk

objectives and other in te rna t iona l agencies (e.g. IDB) are suppo r t ing the in te rna l revenue 
service t o bolster tax co l lec t ion . 
76. 
In line with the in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l c r is is con tex t and l o n g overdue reforms, the 
CPS takes a broad-based approach t o social p ro tec t ion . I t w i l l assist the Gove rnmen t in 
strengthening the effectiveness o f the C C T p rog ram Solidaridad - a p rog ram that was 
covered b y the past CPS - b y w o r k i n g o n b o t h the demand and supply-side f o r needed 
investments in human capital. T h r o u g h a comb ina t ion o f instruments and in strong 
coo rd ina t ion with the IDB and other donors, the CPS w i l l w o r k to expand the capacity o f 
the C C T p rog ram and equip i t with the design features o f best practice CCTs in the

process and impac t evaluation. At the same time, the CPS w i l l support comp lemen ta ry 
actions t o adapt and/or imp rove the supply o f hea l th and education services. Within this 
first strategic objective, the CPS w i l l give special a t ten t ion t o gender issues, m ig ra t ion , 
and r u r a l pove r ty . Spec i f ic objectives and outcomes o f this and the next th ree strategic 
objectives are inc luded in the Results M a t r i x presented in A n n e x 1. 
The Bank w i l l engage in this area th rough lending which c o u l d inc lude (i)

In addition, t w o AAAs w i l l be considered to underpin the Bank's support towards

The third strategic ob jec t ive o f this CPS i s t o enhance the qua l i ty and e f f ic iency 
o f p u b l i c expenditures and p romo te ins t i tu t iona l development o f the D om i n i c a n pub l ic

the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy tha t calls f o r strengthening ins t i tu t ions at the na t iona l 
and reg iona l leve ls , better qua l i ty o f p u b l i c expenditures, public security, good 
governance, and the development o f a r e s u l t s cu l tu re within the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion . 
Ac t ions inc luded under this strategic ob jec t ive w i l l support the Gove rnmen t in ach iev ing 
t h r e e main strategic outcomes: (i) im p r o v e d budget management; (ii) s ign i f ican t progress 
towards pe r fo rmance - in fo rmed budge t management; and (iii) increased r u r a l poo r 
mun ic ipa l i t ies ’ management capacity. The CPS w i l l support the Gove rnmen t in 
strengthening p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions ’ accoun tab i l i ty and their capacity t o p l a n and deliver 
resu l ts . Ac t i v i t ies under this strategic ob jec t ive w i l l inc lude the imp lemen ta t ion o f sound 
pub l ic f inanc ia l management systems, the conso l ida t ion o f transparent and e f f i c i e n t 
procurement mechanisms, the strengthening o f aud i t schemes, and the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
results-based management techniques.

F i n a l l y the Government i s c lose ly coo rd ina t ing e f fo r ts with other donors in these 
areas. F o r example the IDB has t w o operations f o r ins t i tu t iona l strengthening and the

Support o f the Ins t rumen ta t ion o f Performance-based management) and the U N D P has 
various governance related projects t o strengthen the Junta Central Electoral and the 
L o w e r Chamber. 
87. 
In addition, given that i t l ies at the core o f the DR’s development challenges, 
governance w i l l be mainstreamed as a fundamental element o f the ac t iv i t ies defined to 
achieve the other 3 strategic objectives o f the CPS. F o r example, ins t i tu t iona l analysis 
w i l l be conducted f o r c r i t ica l sectors (e.g. energy, health) and specially designed 
mechanisms w i l l be f inanced fo r increased accoun tab i l i ty in service delivery. Special 
emphasis w i l l be g iven t o support Congress in i t s oversight capacity and accoun tab i l i ty 
between Gove rnmen t agencies and c i v i l society. 
88 . 
This third strategic ob jec t ive w i l l be supported b y the implementation o f the 
P rog ramma t ic D P L o n Performance and Accoun tab i l i ty o f Soc ia l Sectors (p rov ided that 
there i s a sound medium-term macroeconomic f ramewo r k in place) - w h i c h includes a 
component to support a s e r i e s o f re fo rms t o build a cu l tu re o f resu l ts in pub l ic 
administration, by the M u n i c i p a l Deve lopmen t Investment Loan, w h i c h w i l l inc lude 
ins t i tu t iona l development ac t iv i t ies t o strengthening capacity o f l o c a l Governments and 
by the second H e a l t h Sector R e f o rm L o a n (PARSS 11) - which includes a s e r i e s o f 
actions t o support performance based management within the hea l th sector. 
8 9 . 
In order t o help achieve this strategic objective, the CPS w i l l consider two AAAs: 
(i) Qua l i ty o f Pub l ic Expenditures NLTA, w h i c h w i l l focus o n improving the qua l i ty o f 
p u b l i c expenditures in the DR b y strengthening f inanc ia l management and procurement 
mechanisms and strengthening the oversight capacity o f va r ious actors. This 
mu l t isec to ra l NLTA inc ludes the development o f a N a t i o n a l Procurement Strategy, the 
app l ica t ion o f the O E C D Ind ica to rs on procurement, techn ica l assistance to SEEPyD, 
Finance and Pub l ic Adm in is t ra t ion , and the support t o the DR Supreme Audit Institution. 
A c t i v i t i e s o n this f ron t are c lose ly coordinated with the IDB, the UND P , and the 
European Commission, w h i c h 
i s already supporting the Secretary o f Pub l ic 
Adm in is t ra t ion with € 8 m i l l i o n ; and (ii) Ins t i tu t iona l and Governance Review (ESW) 
w h i c h w i l l focus o n underlying p o l i t i c a l economy and governance i s s u e s that prevent the 
coun t ry f r o m addressing fundamental development challenges in key sectors like 
education, health, and energy. A se t o f safeguards capacity building ac t iv i t ies w i l l help 
achieve this strategic ob jec t ive b y o f f e r i n g assistance t o the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic to 
manage social and env i ronmen ta l opportunities and risks at a strategic l e v e l . Ana ly t ica l

well as other in te rna t iona l good practice f ramewo rks in a coo rd ina ted manner. 

Strategic Objective I V : Build Capaciq and Constituencies for Reform 

9 0 . 
The f o u r t h strategic ob jec t ive o f the CPS i s t o h e l p build capacity and 
constituencies f o r reform. A c t i v i t i e s a imed at ach iev ing this ob jec t ive are a l igned with 
the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy tha t ca l ls f o r strengthening democratic governance 
and active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector. A c t i o n s inc luded in the 
CPS w i l l support the Government in achieving three m a i n outcomes: (i) strengthening 
congressional budget ove rs igh t capacity; (ii) strengthened c i v i l society capacity fo r

budget analysis and mon i to r ing ; and (iii) enhanced pa r t ic ipa to ry p lann ing at the loca l 

l e v e l . 

9 1 . 
In response t o the demand iden t i f ied during the consultations with c i v i l society 
and Gove rnmen t o f f ic ia ls , the CPS includes a fourth strategic ob jec t ive t o help build 
capacity and constituencies f o r re fo rm , i n c l u d i n g Congress, c i v i l society, and the p r iva te 
sector. Addressing development challenges in the DR requires the co l labo ra t ion o f a 
numbe r o f actors beyond the Government. As learned during the p rev ious CAS , 
p romo t ing , imp lemen t ing , and sustaining re fo rms requ i res a strong constituency with 
enough capacity to m o b i l i z e c r i t ica l stakeholders and resources. W o r k i n g with c i v i l 
society i s at the core o f other in te rna t iona l agencies. F o r example, USAID has a p rog ram 
that p romo tes the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f C i v i l Society t o fight co r rup t ion and the U N D P has 
various p ro jec ts t o strengthen c i v i l society capab i l i t y t o interact and in f luence p o l i c y 
m a k i n g process at the na t iona l and mun ic ipa l leve l . 
92 . 
C i v i l society has p layed a m a j o r ro le in ra is ing awareness about the p rob lems o f 
co r rup t ion , weak governance and accoun tab i l i ty . Since the early 1990s, c i v i l society has 
p rog ress ive ly strengthened i t s vo ice in the p o l i c ym a k i n g process, pa r t icu la r ly b y 
fos te r ing p u b l i c debate and in f luenc ing dec is ion -mak ing th rough concrete p o l i c y 
proposals around key p u b l i c in te re s t i s s u e s such as pove r t y reduction, state re fo rms and 
transparency. Howeve r , c i v i l society organizations s t i l l lack the capacity t o m o b i l i z e 
grassroots movements throughout the country. The reach o f c i v i l society organizations i s 
strong b o t h at the na t iona l and the sub-national le ve ls , but only a few have been able to 
develop the capacity t o m o n i t o r Government pe r fo rmance and transparency. 
93 . 
In terms o f lending, b o t h po l icy -based and inves tmen t loans w i l l inc lude work 
with these stakeholders and a number o f non - lend ing techn ica l assistance ac t iv i t ies and 
ana ly t ica l pieces w i l l focus o n capacity building actions. F o r example, the Social 
P ro tec t ion L o a n inc ludes the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society organizations in m o n i t o r i n g the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rog ram and the P rog ramma t ic D P L on Performance and 
Accoun tab i l i ty o f Soc ia l Sectors helps build the necessary cond i t ions 
establishment o f social accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms around budget fo rmu la t ion and 
execution. 
94 . 
F ina l ly , this strategic ob jec t ive w i l l consider 2 AAAs, as 
f o l l ow s : (i) an 
Ins t i tu t iona l Deve lopmen t Fund f o r Strengthening Congressional Oversight, to help 
imp rove accoun tab i l i ty o f p u b l i c sec tor pe r fo rmance in the DR b y strengthening the 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f Congress t o conduct i t s ove rs igh t r o l e within the new p u b l i c 
f inanc ia l management (PFM ) f ramewo rk ; and (ii) a NLTA f o r Strengthening C i v i l 
Society, which w i l l support ac t iv i t ies t o strengthen the capacity o f c i v i l society t o be an 
e f fec t ive stakeholder t o p romo te change and an e f fec t ive development partner - and 
capacity building o f c i v i l society actors f o r engaging in pa r t ic ipa to ry p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion ,

IMPLEMENTING 

THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
95 . 
The CPS w i l l be based on a flexible approach given the existing uncertainty - 
derived f rom the international financial c r i s i s - over the medium-term macroeconomic 
framework. The strategy c a l l s for a combination o f policy-based and investment lending, 
which w i l l provide enough f lex ib i l i ty 
for 
implementation. However, 
i f the 
macroeconomic situation deteriorates, the CPS w i l l shift towards alternative instruments 
to support the Government. Instead o f re ly ing on a combination o f policy-based and 
investment lending, the CPS may emphasize the increased use o f investment lending. 
96 . 
For Bank operations, as r e f l e c t e d in Table 7 , the new CPS w i l l be based o n the 
implementation o f 9 existing investment loans and 3 new investment loans currently 
under preparation, a programmatic s e r i e s o f A A A , and a programmatic single-tranche 
s e r i e s o f DPLs aimed at reducing the existing vulnerabilities facing the DR today and 
increasing Government's accountability fo r re su l ts . In v iew o f the innovative nature o f 
this type o f operation for the DR, this Programmatic D P L w i l l be implemented on a p i l o t 
basis. An evaluation w i l l be conducted after the implementation o f the f i r s t loan included 
in this se r ies . The r e s u l t s o f this evaluation w i l l in fo rm the design o f subsequent loans in 
the se r ies or the adoption o f alternative lending modalities.

process w i t h the aim o f increasing impact and outreach and placing greater emphasis on 
innovation, learning and knowledge sharing. The scope and content o f the Institute’s 
future offerings for D R participants w i l l be determined together w i t h the L C R Region 
once WBI’s new medium term strategy i s in place. I t i s envisaged, however, that the shift 
away f rom country spec i f ic towards multi-country learning programs w i l l continue. The 
thematic composition o f the future programs are l i k e l y to be determined in l i g h t o f the 
governance oriented activities that have been delivered in the past (informatiodmedia, 
youth, support to Congress) as w e l l as the p r io r i ty themes identified in LCR ’s Region 
wide strategy (Le . trade/competitiveness, climate change, energy, social opportunities and

strengthening l o c a l governance w i l l beg in i t s imp lemen ta t ion in the DR in FY 10. 

F. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
(M& E ) 

107. The CPS w i l l rely o n a comb ina t ion o f M&E mechanisms. First, the CPS w i l l 
con t r ibu te t o strengthening the ex is t ing M&E systems ex is t ing in the DR. The B a n k has 
already app roved an IDF grant to help strengthen this capacity within the N a t i o n a l 
Statistical O f f i c e in close coo rd ina t ion with SEEPyD. In addition, the CPS w i l l support 
pa r t ic ipa to ry M&E mechanisms led b y c i v i l society o rgan iza t ion - inc lud ing , but no t

108. 
Implementation Risks. The new CPS w i l l require close coo rd ina t ion between 
the Ministries o f Finance, Planning, and Pub l ic A dm i n i s t r a t i o n o n the one hand, and the 
spending ministries o n the other. W h i l e this s i tua t ion e x i s t s in other countries as well, i t 
constitutes a pa r t icu la r r i s k in the DR because these m in is t r ie s are key fo r the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the Inves tmen t and P lann ing L aw , on w h i c h the new D P L series i s 
based. I t i s expected tha t this risk w i l l be m i t iga ted by p r o v i d i n g systematic technical 
assistance t o these agencies and b y the strong incen t ive t o cooperate in order to access 
B a n k funds. In addition, the fact that W o r l d Bank loans require congressional ra t i f ica t ion 
may create effectiveness delays. The B a n k i s already w o r k i n g with members o f Congress 
- in close coo rd ina t ion w i th counterparts in Government - to increase awareness o f the 
W B G p rog ram and h o w i t helps address development challenges in the DR. 
109. Economic Risks. Cond i t ion ing further B a n k support o n a number o f c r i t i c a l 
reforms that the coun t ry needs cou ld produce las t ing r e s u l t s and i s predicated o n firm 
Government comm i tmen t t o the r e f o rm process. P o l i c y actions need to be ca re fu l ly 
defined and mon i to red . This process shou ld p r o v i d e adequate flexibility to make the 
necessary adjustments ove r time and p rov ide the c l ien t with a reasonable l e v e l o f 
confidence that targets c o u l d be met and therefore, funds w i l l be disbursed. In addition, 
hav ing a balanced approach and ensuring that investment operations are strategically 
designed w i l l help m i t iga te this risk. 
110. An add i t iona l economic risk i s a m a j o r external shock that inhibits the 
Government f r o m undertaking p o l i c y changes, o r diverts i t s a t ten t ion t o mo re day-to-day 
i s s u e s . Such shocks c o u l d inc lude t rop ica l s to rm damage, s ign i f ican t ly higher o i l pr ices , 
o r the den ia l o f access t o external c red i t markets because o f creditworthiness concerns. 
In this case, the B a n k might have t o develop a lend ing p rog ram that i s mo re focused on 
emergency response. In fac t the current p o r t f o l i o has a numbe r o f operations already 
under imp lemen ta t ion tha t c o u l d be scaled-up to help the coun t ry cope with the shocks 
identified above and the proposed CPS includes spec i f ic interventions that may help 
m i t iga te this risk. 
11 1. F ina l ly , since the CPS contemplates the poss ib i l i ty o f suppo r t ing the Government 
with a s e r i e s o f DPLs , h a v i n g a sound medium-term mac roeconom ic f ramewo rk i s

necessary. The B a n k w i l l closely w o r k with other in te rna t iona l agencies t o support the 
Gove rnmen t in ma in ta in ing a sound macroeconomic f ramewo rk i n c l u d i n g addressing 
po ten t ia l f inanc ing gaps. In addition, the CPS w i l l re ta in a f lex ib le approach, t o enable i t 
t o shift m o r e s t rong ly towards investment lending i f necessary. 
112. Operational Risks. The proposed m o d e l requires the full adop t ion o f a multi- 
sectoral approach, both within the B a n k and in Gove rnmen t . The m o d e l can be e f fec t ive 
in reduc ing transaction costs in B a n k operations while addressing development 
challenges at the coun t ry l e v e l . T o m i t iga te this, a system for m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ing 
the new scheme w i l l be put in place, based o n systematic p o r t f o l i o m o n i t o r i n g and a 
robust CPS Progress Report. In addition, the B a n k w i l l continue the imp lemen ta t ion o f i t s

Annex 3: Lessons Learned f rom the Recent Past 

Lessons from CAS Completion Report 
1 . 
A comprehensive CAS Completion Report i s n ow being finalize. The report 
focuses on the implementation o f the CAS FY06-09, for wh ich analysis o f secondary 
data was made and over 24 o f interviews w i t h task team leaders, sector leaders, and 
sector managers were held. A draft document was shared and benefited from the 
feedback o f members o f the D R Country Team. 
2. 
The CAS Completion Report concludes that the DR i s a challenging country 
in which to work. Often Government signals about what i s needed f rom the Bank are 
not fo l lowed up w i t h the appropriate actions. I t is , at times, even hard to know who 
speaks for “the Government”. Any future strategy w i l l have to decide where the 
Bank’s comparative advantage l i e s , particularly g iven that i t i s not the biggest or most 
important donor/source o f f inance . The lessons that seem to emerge f rom this CAS 
completion review are: 
Keep focused on a few key sectors where there i s some potential for success 
and where Bank advice i s appreciated (if not always followed): education, 
health, safety ne ts , and perhaps power. 
S e t realistic objectives and targets that can be measured, 
The focus o f public sector reform should be on maintaining accountability and 
transparency in Government operations, inc lud ing budget formulation and 
execution, and imp rov ing the voice o f c i v i l society, 
Adopt a comprehensive approach and include po l i t ica l economy dimensions 
when dealing w i t h the energy sector, 
U s e ESW to focus on untraceable problems like corruption, drugs, money 
laundering, crime and violence, public sector reform. Conduct ES W 
cooperatively w i t h partners in country, so as to b u i l d ownership and local 
capacity, 
Strengthen C i v i l Society capacity to build constituency for the reform and 
engage with Congress for dealing w i t h complex development challenges in 
the country; and 
Strengthen donor coordination b y mapping donor’s interventions and p r io r i ty 
areas as we l l as aligning efforts fo r Policy Reform. 

Lessons from Country Assistance Evaluation 
3 . 
Some o f the conclusions o f the 2003 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE ) 
conducted b y the Independent Evaluation Group o f the Bank a re s t i l l relevant today. 
First, the report concluded that above a l l , the Bank should wo rk to continue to 
improve i t s dialogue w i t h the country. Second, the C A E emphasized the need to 
continue the strategic engagement in the energy sector, with a strong emphasis on i t s 
regulatory regime and i s s u e s o f efficiency and effectiveness o f the service.

Lessons from Consultations with Civil Soc ie ty 
4. 

Imu l ica t ions of the M C Reuort 

A s e r i e s o f consultations w i t h c i v i l society actors for the de f in i t ion o f the CPS 
took place in the DR, in January 2009 . Over 200 organizations participated in 4 
consultations that were held in L a Romana, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Barahona 
- covering a l l regions o f the country. 
These meetings 
were 
h igh ly 
productive and the process was su ccess fu l in 
achieving 
i t s objectives. C i v i l society 
participants provided important inputs to the 
Bank and i t was a good way fo r the Bank to 
reach-out to a number o f nontraditional 
partners. The fo l low ing are a sample o f the 
ma in messages we heard during these 4 
sessions. 
0 C i v i l society organizations recognized 
the value added o f the Bank in the DR as a 
strategic partner 
for development and 
requested the Bank to provide channels fo r a 
sustained and systematic dialogue w i t h CSOs; 
0 Participants requested the Bank to 
help keep the Government accountable. They 
seem to trust 
the Bank over their own 
authorities. 
There i s strong demand for the Bank 
to deepening i t s direct engagement w i t h c i v i l 
society, through capacity bu i ld ing activities 
and when possible, through funding; 
i s a pending agenda on 
territorial 
development w i t h a 
strong 
emphasis on loca l and participatory planning; 
0 Support micro, medium and small 
producers w i t h 
technical knowledge and 
access to markets; 
0 Eco-tourism was mentioned as an 
important p r io r i ty a number o f times; 
Increasing the quality o f education 
and health i s a p r io r i ty and addressing 
institutional i s s u e s w i th in these sectors i s 
important (e.g. corruption); and 
0 Rule o f law i s weak and Government 
o f f ic ia ls need to be accountable to their 
constituencies; 

I n 2006, the Development 
Committee o f the IMF and the 
World Bank produced a paper to 
“Strengthening the World Bank’s 
Engagement with IBRD Partner 
Countries.” The report presents a 
number o f recommendations 
applicable to 7 9 middle-income 
countries (MICs) on how the IBRD 
can become more effective i n 
delivering flexible, high quality and 
cost -effective menu o f services for 
achieving development results 
The report concluded that key 
services to be improved for MICs 
should cover the following five 
areas: (i) strategy and coordination 
services, by reflecting country- 
specific needs and priorities and 
accelerating the responsiveness o f 
the Bank to client demands; (ii) 
financial services, by making Bank 
financial services more competitive, 
developing approaches to help 
catalyze market-based solutions, and 
streamlining Bank procedures, (iii) 
knowledge services, with a strong 
focus on building on t h e Bank’s 
comparative advantages, 
strengthening linkages between 
research and operational work and 
eliminating barriers for the delivery 
o f global expertise, (iv) WBG 
synergies, making sure that IBRD, 
IFC and M IGA could strengthen 
their collaboration fo r development 
results, and (v) ensuring 
coordination among international 
cooperation agencies and fostering 
partnerships for development.

Annex 4: DR CAS Comp le t ion R e p o r t - FY05-FY09 

1. 
This CAS Completion Report (CAS-CR) evaluates the effectiveness o f the 
Bank’s 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Dominican Republic (DR). 
W h i l e the CAS period covered FY06-09, this rev iew also includes some o f the 
progress made in FY04 and ea r l ie r fo r background information. This report reviews 
the Bank ’s strategic objectives, program o f support and their relevance to the 
Government’s development goals. The report also assesses to what extent the Bank 
was success fu l in meeting these objectives and draws lessons to guide the design o f 
the new country strategy for FY10-13. The methodology for the production o f this 
report includes the analysis o f secondary data, a number o f interviews w i t h Bank staff 
wo rk ing on the DR program, and a number o f interviews with h i g h ranked Dominican 
Government o f f ic ia ls and members o f the c i v i l society and the private sector. 

I. The CAS Strategy and Objectives 

1.1 

Country Context and Background to the CAS 
2. 
A f te r a f inanc ia l c r i s i s in the early 1990s, the Government adopted a s e r i e s o f 
economic reforms wh ich resulted in a strong rebound. G row th during the 1990s 
averaged about 6 per cen t per year, fueled b y tourism, telecommunications and the 
free-trade zones, a l l beneficiaries o f the re fo rm program. Social indicators improved, 
and poverty declined, but distortions s t i l l persisted in many areas, especially in 
agriculture and industry. 
3 . 
The r o l e o f the Bank during this period was modest. The IDB had a much 
bigger in f luence , w i t h 2-3 times the amount o f the Bank’s lending. The Bank had a 
strong voice in the po l icy dialogue on structural reforms, but the dialogue was 
d i f f icu l t and discontinuous. W h i l e s t ruc tu ra l adjustment lending was included in the 
country strategies o f that time, such lending d id not materialize through the m i d 
1990s’ because o f the country’s sensitivity to external in te r fe rence and because o f the 
uncertainty w i t h regards to the country’s commitment to reform5. An I E G review o f 
this period noted that completed projects during this time were below average in 
t e r m s o f outcomes, institutional development impact and sustainability. W h i l e 
projects in the basic education sector were h igh ly successful, those in such areas as 
energy and transport sectors experienced major implementation difficulties and had 
l i t t l e institutional development impact6. 
4. 
The period o f strong growth came to an end in 2003, when the Dominican 
economy was plunged in to a c r i s i s w i t h revelation o f a major bank fraud, and the 
collapse o f several o f i t s major banks. Government deficits widened, growth slowed, 
in f la t ion accelerated, and the Government could not reach agreement w i t h the I M F o n 
a stabilization program. 
After two years o f deep economic c r i s is , a new Government under President

The C A S o f 2005 developed a p rog ram o f support f o r the p rog ram o f the new 
Government, focused o n a number o f key areas. I t s stated m a i n ob jec t ive was an 
“ove ra rch ing focus o n im p r o v i n g governance and strengthening institutions”’. This 
was seen at that time as necessary t o restore confidence in the coun t r y and restore 
g row th . Changes in governance were seen t o occur b o t h th rough a f ron ta l attack o n 
p u b l i c sector r e f o rm and th rough f inanc ia l management re fo rms in sector operations. 
T w o m a i n p i l la rs supported this focus: 
S tab i l iz ing the economy, im p r o v i n g competitiveness, and res to r ing economic 
g row th ; and 
A c h i e v i n g greater social equ i ty th rough human development and increased 
coverage and qua l i ty o f basic p u b l i c services. 
The f i r s t o f these p i l l a r s i s c lea r ly a l igned with the ove ra l l strategy l a i d ou t in

Progress in Meeting CAS Objectives 

11. 

The FY05 C A S was n o t “ resu l ts oriented”, and the re were n o e x p l i c i t targets 
f o r performance o r r e s u l t s given.g Instead the “CAS M o n i t o r i n g F ramewo rk ” was 
cast in t e r m s o f p o l i c y actions required, and the ind ica to rs that c o u l d be used to 
measure progress, but n o baseline data o r targets are given f o r these indicators. The 
m a t r i x was rev ised at the t im e o f the C A S Progress Repo r t in 2007, and mo re 
ind ica to rs and targets were added at that time, pa r t icu la r ly in education and hea l th 
(see Annex Tab le I, w h i c h updates this ma t r ix ) . Howeve r , many other areas lacked 
ind ica to rs o r targets at the time o f the Progress Report, and i t was no ted that “e f fo r ts 
t o determine benchmark and/or target values are ongoing”, despite the fact that the 
progress repo r t was comp le ted in 2007, at the m id -po in t o f the C A S pe r iod . Thus, i t i s 
s t i l l d i f f i c u l t t o j u d g e progress in meeting C A S objectives in many areas. 

A. The Overarching Objective - Public Sector Reform 
12. 
The 2006 CAS considered governance and institutional reform in the 
public sector the “over-arching” objective. U p o n assuming p ow e r in August 2004, 

the new Government started many in i t ia t ives in this area, but once g r ow t h rev ived 
there seems t o have been a lack o f a t ten t ion t o this agenda. O v e r a l l governance 
indicators o f the Bank ’s W B I f o r the pe r iod 2003 t o 2007 shows imp rovemen ts in 
such areas as “Vo ice and Accoun tab i l i ty ” , “Po l i t ica l S tab i l i ty ” and “Regulatory 
Qua l i ty ” . Howeve r , other areas such as “Government Effectiveness”, “Rule o f Law ” , 
and “Con t ro l o f Co r rup t ion ” a l l show deterioration over the same pe r iod .

The Government created a N a t i o n a l Comm iss ion o n E th ics and Anti- 
co r rup t ion in 2004, and an A n t i -C o r r u p t i o n Agency was created in the A t to rney - 
General’s O f f ice ” . The B a n k supported this w o r k with an IDF grant. Howeve r , l i t t l e 
was accomplished b y the Comm iss ion . A p rog ram f o r the repo r t ing o f assets b y 
p u b l i c servants, f o r instance, was never enforced, and the Comm iss ion i t s e l f p roved 
weak and ine f fec t ive . 
14. 
The Government did pass major legislation covering many key areas of 
public financial management, including a new budget and treasury law, and a 
law on transparency (public access). A l s o approved were a n ew procurement law, 
an audit law, and the c rea t ion o f a stronger Finance ministry (Hacienda) which 
comb ined finance, budget, external debt and p rocu remen t functions, as we l l as a 
strengthened Ministry o f Economy, P lann ing and Deve lopmen t (Econom ia ) . These 
reforms represent an attempt t o limit Presidential d isc re t iona l i ty over budget 
execution, strengthen checks and balances, and enhance accoun tab i l i ty f o r the 
management o f p u b l i c funds. Howeve r the imp lemen ta t ion o f m a n y o f these laws 
varies across ministries. The Ministry o f H e a l t h and the Attorney General’s O f f ice , 
f o r instance, have made s ign i f ican t progress implementing these re fo rms (access to 
in fo rma t ion , procurement, f inanc ia l mana ement), but this i s n o t duplicated in mos t 
other ministries. The Camara de Cuentas , w h i c h i s in charge o f auditing, remains 
weak and la rge ly ine f fec t ive , in pa r t because i t lacks resources . The l aw on 
transparency was passed, but n o agency created t o implement it, and as a resu l t few 
ministries grant real access t o in fo rma t ion . The p rocu remen t l a w i s far reaching, but 
progress in imp lemen ta t ion has been s low . Thus, there has been o n l y limited progress 
in increasing procurement e f f ic iency and transparency. 
15. 
There has been some limited progress in the reform of the public 
financial management (PFM) system. P r io r t o 2006, p u b l i c financial management 
(PFM ) did n o t adequately support the ob jec t ives o f aggregate f isca l d isc ip l ine , 
e f f ic ien t resource a l loca t ion o r operational e f f ic iency . Budgeted revenue and 
expenditure differed considerably f r o m outturns, with the President exercising a high 
degree o f d isc re t ion ove r spending, while expenditure con t ro l and procurement 
systems were inadequate and fragmented and enforcement was weak. Recogn iz ing 
these weaknesses, the D om i n i c a n Repub l ic has made some progress in P F M re fo rm , 
w h i c h in te r a l i a has strengthened the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk fo r P FM . 
These have 
inc luded s teps t o 
limit Presidential discretionary spending, and 
in t roduc ing a new f inanc ia l management i n f o rm a t i o n system (SIGEF). Other s teps 
have been taken to consolidate budget f o rm u l a t i o n and treasury management in the 
Ministry o f Finance, and the creation o f a new Ministry o f Economy , P lann ing and

The Government i s also focusing on improving the quality of public

to be completed b y mid-2009. In addition, ‘Results Agreements’, that set out strategic 
plans, objectives and iden t i fy performance measuredtargets w i l l be agreed with four

and environment. These f i r s t agreements w i l l be published as an annex in the 2010 
Budget. 
17. 
Bank Support for public sector reform had limited success. The Bank was 
not able to provide the kind o f support for public sector reform that was envisaged in 
the CAS. A $10 m i l l i o n t e c h n i c a l assistance loan, proposed for FY05, was dropped 
b y the Government during the “freeze” and given a l o w p r io r i ty . I t wou ld have 
supplemented the work o f the IDB in the public sector, w i t h a focus on the 
implementation o f the Transparency Law, and extend public sector reforms to the 
sector level. The proposed project had l i n k s to the Health APL . A D P L for Public 
Sector Reform has never been initiated due to la ck o f Government in te re s t . The Bank 
did support the development o f the Transparency L aw through t r u s t funds. The IDB 
had a major role in public sector reform, p rov id ing support in a number o f areas, 
inc lud ing financial rnanagementl4. The Government considered the IDB as taking the 
lead on this issue , and d id not see the need to invo lve the Wo r ld Bank as well. In 
addition, the Congress had a bias against borrowing money to fund techn ica l 
assistance, and the Bank also lacked the resources to mount an effective dialogue on 
sector issues , or iden t i fy a clear comparative advantage. 
18. 
However, the CAS strategy suggested that public sector re fo rm wou ld also be 
part o f sector operations, w i t h the objective o f making the general reforms (such as 
procurement, transparency) operational at the sector level. This appears to have 
happened on ly in the case o f health, through the Bank’s Health AP L . The Bank d id 
undertake a Country Fiduciary Assessment in FY05, wh ich pointed to the many 
problems in public sector financial operations, particularly the weaknesses o f the 

procurement system. 

19. 
The Bank i s providing technical support fo r the development o f the 
National Development Strategy, which will define priorities f o r the public sector, 
and set the frame f o r the production o f the MTEF. H o w e f f e c t i v e these 
instruments w i l l be in imp rov ing the efficiency o f Government spending has yet to be 
seen. Allocations and contract awards may be heavily po l i t ic ized while public 
investment in schools, health, roads and power lag behind and hinder economic 
growth. 
20. 
Du r ing the CAS period, the Government seemed to have los t focus in 
reducing corruption and reforming the public sector once growth revived. As a resu l t , 
Government corruption remains a problem. On Transparency

B. Stabilizing the Economy and Promoting Growth 

21. 
The Government has been very successful in stabilizing the economy and 
restoring growth. Rea l g r ow t h has averaged over 9 pe r cen t per annum fo r 3 years 
(2005-2007), double wha t the C A S envisaged (see Tab le 1). 
I n f l a t i o n has been 
contained t o single digits, and the f isca l pos i t ion has shifted from p r im a r y de f ic i ts t o 
p r ima ry s u r p l u s e s . At the same time, pub l ic debt ra t io t o G D P has declined 
s ign i f ican t ly and the r e s e r v e pos i t ion o f the Central B a n k has imp roved . 
22. 
Cond i t ions in 2008 worsened somewhat, as a result o f the impac t o f higher o i l 
and 
f o o d prices and a s l ow d ow n in the w o r l d economy. Subsidies f o r energy and 
food 
raised the budget de f ic i t , and despite tighter mone ta ry po l icy , i n f l a t i o n rose to 
over 
10 per cent. G r ow t h i s estimated t o have been about 5.3 per cent in 2008, and i s 
likely t o be l ow e r in 2009, as the w o r l d recession affects tou r ism and other expo r t 
industries. The recession has also reduced access by the Gove rnmen t to fo re ign 

borrowing. 

23. 
There has been a significant increase in private investment, reflecting the 
better macroeconomic condition and improved investment climate. The IFC ’ s 
“Do ing Business 2009” put D om i n i c a n Repub l ic in the t o p 10 reformers in the wo r ld . 
Re fo rms c i ted inc luded a reduc t ion in the corporate income tax, and reductions in 
taxes o n transfers and registry o f property, and imp rovemen ts in trade adm in is t ra t ion . 
In addition, the Gove rnmen t has taken s teps to imp rove the bank ing system, i n c l u d i n g 
imp roved bank supervision. 
24. 
Fo re ign d i rec t inves tmen t has been robust, lead ing t o a r ise in f i x e d cap i ta l 
fo rma t ion and a s ign i f ican t app rec ia t ion o f the peso. N e t d i rec t inves tmen t f l ow s rose 
from $612 m i l l i o n in 2003 t o $1.2 b i l l i o n in 2007. Other impo r tan t inflows include 
remittances (peaking at a lmos t $ 3 b i l l i o n I 6 in 2007), and unreported flows that m a y 
come f r om drug t rad ing p r o f i t s and money 1 a ~ n d e r i n g . l ~ As a resu l t , the index o f the 
real e f fec t ive exchange rate rose 27 per cent between 2004 and 2007 . M u c h o f these

The objective o f the Technical Assistance (TA ) loan was to provide assistance 
to the Government to help improve the transmission network and restore f inanc ia l

strategy was adopted b y the Government, and thus the PDO was attained, i t has not 
been effectively implemented. The E lec t r ic i ty D is t r ibu t ion Rehabilitation Project

The D P L was a three tranche operation targeting key po l i cy areas. I t included 
conditions designed to ensure that: i) major agencies o f the Government have paid 
their electricity bills, ii) Government subsidies have been transferred from the budget, 
iii) the Government initiate private sector participation in i t s distribution companies, 
and i v ) the targets fo r the CR I have been met. The Government froze electricity 
prices in September o f 2006, rather than make a required upward adjustment o f 18 
per cent in p r ices , under grounds that such an increase wou ld only increase theft and 
non-payment. As petroleum prices continued t o r i s e , the Government budget fo r 
paying subsidies to the electricity providers was insufficient. Rather than make the 
necessary payments, the Government accumulated arrears w i t h the generating 
companies. The resu l t i s an accumulated d e f i c i t o f over $400 m i l l i o n owed to these 
companies, and the companies being unable to provide su f f ic ien t power for the grid, 
and periodically imposing blackouts. 
The release o f the first and second tranches was undertaken w i t h waivers

because o f non-compliance w i t h the tariff formula. The last tranche o f the loan was 
cancelled in 2009 because o f failure to reach agreement on outstanding i s s u e s on 
tariffs, plus the non-payment o f Government arrears t o generators, and a failure to 
move further on privatization.

The power sector continues to face major problems. A large number o f

A ten-year plan for Health Sector Reform and a mid-term reform agenda 
to improve health service quality and accelerate the implementation of the 
General Health and Soc ia l Security Laws we re put in place in 2006. Rigorous 

implementation o f these laudable reforms should result in improvements in service 
quality, reductions in out-of-pocket expenditure, and increased consumer satisfaction. 
The Bank ’s Health APL (FY04) in i t ia l ly focused on p rov id ing support to meet the 
MDGs in health, namely reduced child and infant mortality. The project underwent a 
major restructuring in 2006 that refocused the project on funding health s e r v i c e s in 
poor areas, decentralizing se rv ice s to the provinces, and an increasing the enrollment 
o f the poor in health s e r v i c e s . The loan has been instrumental in imp rov ing financial 
management, pub l ic access to information, and procurement procedures in the 
Ministry o f Health. I t generally has been rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory 
in i t s ab i l i ty to reach i t s development objectives. The M i n i s t r y o f Health has generally 
been more w i l l i n g than other ministries to implement the national legislation on 
public sector reform, including the introduction o f improved monitoring and 
evaluation. 
In terms o f project PDOs, the percent o f primary health facilities in prioritized 
areas was projected to go f rom 0% in 2007 to 50% b y the end o f 2008 . The other 
PDOs are under discussion or data i s not yet available. 
In addition, parts o f a $25 m i l l i o n H I V / A I D S project f rom FYOl were 
disbursed during the CAS period; this project closed at the end o f FY08. The project

was mode ra te ly unsatisfactory. Howeve r , i t met o r exceeded a l l five o f i t s PDOs,

39. 
In addition, the Reg ion manages the G l o b a l A l l iance F o o d F o r t i f i c a t i o n 
P ro jec t (GAIN DR), a rec ip ien t executed grant o f $1.8 m i l l i o n in w h i c h the Ministry

Dominican primary school enrollment rates a re high but retention and 
completion a r e low. Throughout the system, the quality o f education i s v e r y low 
-well below regional and international standards. D e s p i t e almost universal 
coverage in p r im a r y education, secondary school en ro l lmen t represents a rea l 
“bottleneck “ in the system as en ro l lmen t rates d rop d ras t ica l ly at the secondary l e v e l . 
The l o w en ro l lmen t in secondary school education hampers the a b i l i t y o f the DR t o

has faced serious delays due t o insu f f ic ien t a l loca t ions o f l o c a l funds in the budget, 
and d i f f i c u l t i e s in a r rang ing procurement f o r the j o b t ra in ing centers, i n c l u d i n g

The p ro jec t has experienced

enable the p ro jec t t o adapt t o unforeseen cost increases, imp rove p ro jec t mon i to r ing , 
and permit f l e x i b i l i t y in procurement and f inanc ia l management to fac i l i ta te the

and the p ro jec t underwent a first-order res t ruc tu r ing (approved by the board on 
October 10, 2008). Despite the slow 
imp lemen ta t ion progress, the p ro jec t

them to health c l i n i c s for vaccinations and check-ups. The money i s distributed v ia a 
debit card, or tarjeta. So l ida r idad rep resen ts an important shift away from universal 
social assistance programs but requ i res a rigorous monitoring system to be e f f e c t i v e . 
W h i l e designed as a conditional cash transfer program, in fact the program runs as an 
unconditional transfer, because the Government lacks the ab i l i ty to check on 
compliance w i t h conditions 
43. 
The Bank i s helping improve the coverage o f the program through its 
Soc ia l Protection Investment Project (FY07). This project i s designed to help 
improve the targeting, coverage o f the country’s social protection programs, inc lud ing 
the So l ida r idad program. This project’s major expenditures are to provide identity 
papers fo r up to 200,000 Dominicans who lack birth ce r t i f ica tes , and are therefore not 
eligible fo r the So l ida r idad program, for subsidized health care, or fo r public 
education beyond the seventh grade. This project was approved in August 2007, but 
only became effective in December 2008. The latest ISR does not report progress on 
PDO indicators. A remaining problem, outside the scope o f this project, i s the large 
number o f i l lega l Ha i t ian immigrants wo rk ing in the bateyes (sugar plantations). 
44. 
The Government’s subsidy o f electricity and propane gas consumption, 
estimated at 2.5 percent o f GDP in 200522 continues to benefit the non-poor 
disproportionately, as do subsidies fo r pharmaceuticals and food d i ~ t r i b u t i o n ~ ~ . 
Overall, both social ass is tance programs and tax s truc ture , including a wide range o f 
exemptions, remain regressive despite the f i s c a l re fo rms o f 2005 and 2006. 

11. The Bank Contribution Toward CAS Objectives 

Overview 
45 . 
The CAS proposed to support the attainment o f i t s objectives w i t h a lending 
program o f $260 m i l l i o n in the base case (plus $15 m i l l i o n f rom GEF)24, and w i t h a 
l ow case o f $1 10 m i l l i o n and a h i g h case o f $360 million. Through FY09 , the Bank 
lent $194 m i l l ion , somewhere between the l o w case and the base case, and the 
composition o f the lending differed significantly f rom that proposed in the CAS (see 
Table 4)25. In addition, this total includes $80 m i l l i o n for the Emergency Recovery 
and Disaster Management Project (ERL), wh ich was not included in the o r ig ina l CAS 
program. Without the ERL , the total for lending wou ld be $1 14 m i l l ion , roughly 
equal to the original CAS l ow case (see F ig . 1). 

2 2 This includes both direct subsidies (e.g., for propane gas and the P rog rama p a r a l a Reduccidn de 
Apagones, or PRA) as we l l as Government transfers to cover electricity sector deficits. 
23 The subsidy on propane gas was eliminated in the latter h a l f o f 2008. . 
24 No t including a Carbon Finance proposal. 
25 None o f the GEF operations were approved.

The lending program was severely impacted b y the freeze imposed by the 
Government on new lending, required b y the IMF limit on new debt. Thus, only one 
loan was made in FY05, and none in FY06. The proposed Social Sector investment 
Loan was divided in to two operations, the You th and Development Project (FY06) 
and the Social Protection Investment Loan (FY08). The Institutional Development 
TA , wh ich was to support public sector reforms, was dropped (although a substitute 
project called Governance and Competitiveness has been proposed to replace it). The 
GEF and the carbon finance operations never went forward due to lack o f 
Government interest and the lack o f Bank resources to do the preparation work. 
47. 
The Water and Sanitation APL-1, originally proposed for FY07, was f ina l ly 
approved in FY09 . Thus, wh i le the CAS had a proposed base case lending program 
o f 10 projects, on ly f i ve projects were actually approved. However, o f the 10 
operations proposed in the CAS, only th ree came about as planned, since one project 
was an emergency p ro jec t (ERL), and another proposed project was divided in to two.

The “freeze” made c lea r Government priorities; there was in te res t in an 
operation focused on youth development, because o f a serious youth unemployment 
problem recognized b y the Government, but not fo r borrowing fo r technical 
assistance to further public sector reform. The Emergency Recovery and Disaster 
Management Project ($80 m i l l ion , FY08 ) fulfilled a special request to provide 
assistance to repair the infrastructure damages f rom two tropical storms wh ich struck 
the island in the F a l l o f 2007 . D e s p i t e the supposed urgency o f the loan, which was 
approved in M a y 2008, i t became effective a year later (May, 2009 ) after the 
Congressional approval was obtained in Ma rch 2009 . At the same time, important 
progress was made in some sectors using operations that carried over f rom the 
previous CAS . The most important o f these was the Health A P L f rom FY03, the 
Power Sector D P L (FY 05 $150 m i l l ion ) , and a Power Sector Technical Assistance 
Loan (FY05 $7 .3 m i l l ion ) . ’These last two loans became e f f e c t i v e during the CAS

Some o f these effectiveness delays can be traced to the freeze on new lend ing 
du r ing 2006, and the run up t o the 2008 elections. Howeve r , at the same time the 
Government froze new lending f r o m the B a n k and others, i t was p roceed ing with i t s 
Santo D om i n g o M e t r o p ro jec t . Thus, i t w o u l d seem that B a n k p ro jec ts had a l o w 
p r i o r i t y . Effectiveness delays also were common be fo re the freeze, as w e l l as after. 
The Emergency Recove ry and Disaster Management Project, w h i c h was supposed to 
respond t o emergency recons t ruc t ion f o r the hurricanes in Oc tobe r -Novembe r o f 
2007, was declared e f fec t ive o n M a y 6th, 2009 (a l though 40% can be used t o cover 
re t roac t ive payments). Projects take longe r than expected t o become e f fec t ive . The 
result i s a p o r t f o l i o o f p ro jec ts with ma jo r imp lemen ta t ion delays. F o r instance, the 
Social P ro tec t ion Inves tmen t Loan was approved by the B o a r d in Augus t o f 2007. 
The p ro jec t assumed that the loan w o u l d begin disbursing in the first quarter o f 
FY2008 , but the l o a n only became e f f e c t i v e in December 2008, 16 mon ths after 
approval.

I n addition to effectiveness delays, Bank projects in the Dominican 
Republic experience disbursement delays, b o t h compared with project expectations 
and with L C R Reg iona l averages. The disbursement ra t io (October 2008) was 3.2% 
o f the po r t fo l io , compared t o a L C R average o f 8.3%28. As shown in Table 5 , the 
average p ro jec t has a disbursement delay o f about 50% - - that i s , curren t 
disbursements are o n l y h a l f o f wha t was expected.

Howeve r , few projects a r e considered “at risk”. The p o r t f o l i o as o f October

disbursement and l o w numbers o f p ro jec ts at r isk , in an otherwise r i s k y environment,

The combination of effectiveness and disbursement delays results in the 
need to extend projects past their anticipated closing date. The average p ro jec t

During the FYOS-FYOS CAS period, IFC’s strategy focused on enhancing 
the competitiveness o f the private sector, supporting projects generating growth, and 
contributing towards greater soc ia l equity. IFC’s interventions concentrated in areas 
where the country has a competitive advantage or that are hard currency ea rne rs o f 
the economy-tourism, 
and f ree trade zone (notably developing inwa rd linkages 
towards the local economy); and human resources development (health and 
education). Other important areas included in f ras t ruc tu re and renewable energy. 
Du r ing the financial c r i s i s in the DR, IFC’s program focused on restoring confidence 
in the private sector in order to improve the country’s competitiveness and contribute 
towards greater social equity.

Annex 7: Governance in the Dominican Republic 

I. GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK 
The governance environment in the Dominican Republic (DR) i s complex and 
singled out by many as one o f the country’s main overarching obstacles f o r 
achieving a sustainable, equitable and inclusive growth. The latest U S A I D assessment 
o n democracy and governance in the DR (April 2007) conc luded that the coun t ry faces a 
p r o b l em o f good governance, one o f i t s m a i n causes be ing an “ove r ly p ow e r f u l executive 
b ranch con f ron ted by too few checks and balances.” S im i la r f ind ing s are underscored in 
the UND P ’ s 2008 D om i n i c a n Repub l ic H um a n Development Report, p o i n t i n g t o 
weaknesses in the r u l e o f law , l o w l e v e l s o f transparency and access t o public 
in fo rma t ion , access t o oppo r tun i t ies determined by personal and g roup powe r and the 
predominance o f patronage re la t ions in po l i t ics . M a n y argue that the i s s u e o f D om i n i c a n 
co r rup t ion rep resen ts one o f the greatest obstacles t o a mo re pa r t ic ipa to ry and 
representative democracy. Since the bank failures and economic crises that began in 
2002, D om i n i c a n society i s mo re acutely aware o f the i s s u e and the g rav i ty o f the 
p rob lem 
I n Dominican Republic the President exerc ises great influence over the other 
branches and levels o f Government. The T r u j i l l o regime that lasted 3 0 years has l e f t a 
strong legacy o f personalized and de - ins t i tu t iona l ized Gove rnmen t dec is ion mak ing32 . 
D om i n i c a n p res iden t ia l ism n o t o n l y r e s t s o n the powers given b y the Cons t i tu t ion , but 
also o n the t rad i t ion o f paternalism. Fo rma l ly , the Congress does have i t s o w n 
cons t i tu t iona l source o f independent au tho r i ty that cou ld p rov ide ce r ta in fundamental 
checks o n executive powe r . Howeve r , mos t analysts o f execu t ive - leg is la t ive relations 
concur that in practice, as i t happens in other countries o f the region, Congress does n o t 
exercise i t s ro le as a check and balance t o executive powe r . 
Despite recent modernization e f fo r t s , 
the effectiveness o f 
the country’s 
accountability institutions -including Congress, the Anticorruption Office, the 
Chamber o f Accounts and Regulatory Agencies- i s still very low. L a w 423-06 
increased the type and de ta i l o f budget i n f o rm a t i o n that the Execu t ive i s mandated to 
present before Congress in i t s budget proposal. F o r instance, a p r e l im i n a r y repo r t o n the 
macro-economic and f isca l forecasts and the expected econom ic and f inanc ia l r e s u l t s as 
we l l as a mu l t i -annua l forecast must be inc luded (PEFA 2007). A c c o r d i n g t o the 2007 
PEFA , “there are n o predetermined procedures f o r the budget review pe r fo rmed b y the 
leg is la t ive branch, but Congress’ P lann ing and Budget Comm iss ion analyses the budget 
f r om a geographical perspective and makes recommendations t o the p lena r y session”. 
The DR has scores 1 1 out o f 100 po in ts in the 2008 Open Budget Index developed b y the 
In te rna t iona l Budget Partnership (IBP), amongst the countries p r o v i d i n g “scant or no ” 
i n f o rm a t i o n o n the budget t o the p u b l i c . A l t h o u g h the Execu t ive ’s budget p roposa l must 
be submitted during the second legislature (August 16 th - Novembe r 13 th), in practice, 
the Executive’s budget p roposa l arrives in the last week o f December. Therefore, the 
document i s not k n o w n by the p u b l i c until i t s approval.

these 

t o ensure 

Congress has embarked in a modernization process that includes management 
reforms aimed at streamlining its organizational design, bylaws, personnel system, 
and communications, as we l l as institutional reforms for improving its capacity for 
budget analysis and tracking. D u r i n g 2007-2008, U N D P has supported the House o f 
Representatives in setting up a D i v i s i o n f o r Budget Ana lys is and Design, w h i c h i s 
cu r ren t ly operational (with personnel be ing hired th rough a merit-based system) and 
o f fe r ing techn ica l advice t o fou r House committees (Budget, Pub l ic Debt, Fiscal, and 
Accoun ts Committees). The Senate’s (art. 5 ) and the House’s (art. 7) by laws , however, 
mandate the c rea t ion o f a b icame ra l o f f i c e with the purpose o f p r o v i d i n g sound 
leg is la t ive analysis t o b o t h chambers. Th is o f f i c e has yet t o be created. The development 
o f leg is la t ive ana ly t ica l capacities, pa r t icu la r ly re fe r red t o f inanc ia l management and 
budget performance, as well as the s t ream l in ing o f Congress’s information system w o u l d 
enable better comp l iance by Congress o f i t s oversight mandate in an appropriate manner. 
The Chamber of Accounts (Chmara de Cuentus) has undergone through a prolonged 
legitimacy c r i s i s . In order f o r the Chamber t o fulfill i t s mandate, the P E F A repo r t says 
that i t needs t o be strengthened at t w o levels: f i r s t , by im p r o v i n g their capacity t o produce 
special audits 
(ca l led 
“ f inanc ia l audits” 
in the DR, and 
“comp l iance audits” 
in te rna t iona l ly ) that t r u l y assess f inanc ia l transactions beyond mere accoun t ing reviews; 
and second, since the recommendations o f the Chamber o f Accoun ts in the f i n a l reports 
are o f manda to ry comp l iance ( L aw 10-04, Art. 3 9 ) by the audited agency, other 
stakeholders such as Congress and c i v i l society organizations shou ld develop capacities 
that 
recommendations are 
rea l ly 
fo l lowed . The Execu t ive ’s 
A n t i c o r r u p t i o n O f f i c e (D i recc ion de Persecucion de l a Co r rupc ion Adm in is t ra t iva ) under 
the A t to rney General’s O f f i c e has been elevated in i t s adm in is t ra t ive h ie ra rchy and i t s 
mandate has been delimited t o the inves t iga t ion o f co r rup t ion and the con t ro l o f p u b l i c 
o f f ic ia ls ’ assets declarations. This, however, has n o t been supported su f f ic ien t budgetary 
allocations. 
Civil soc iety has played a major r o l e in raising awareness about the problems of 
corruption, weak governance and accountability. Since the ea r ly 1990s , c i v i l society 
has progressively strengthened i t s voice in the p o l i c ym a k i n g process, pa r t icu la r ly by 
fostering p u b l i c debate and in f luenc ing dec is ion -mak ing through concrete p o l i c y 
proposals around k e y p u b l i c in te re s t i s s u e s such as pove r t y reduction, s ta te r e f o rm s and 
transparency. Howeve r , c i v i l society organizations are s t i l l l a c k i n g the capacity t o 
m o b i l i z e grassroots movements thought ou t the coun t ry . The weave o f c i v i l society 
organizations i s s t rong b o t h at the na t iona l and the sub-national leve l s , but o n l y a few 
have been able t o develop capacities f o r m o n i t o r i n g Gove rnmen t performance and 
transparency. An Access t o I n f o rm a t i o n l a w was enacted in 2006 a l though i t has n o t been 
f u l l y implemented for the lack o f demand-side invo lvemen t . Nevertheless, in the last few 
years some coa l i t ions have been fo rmed a imed at strengthening their vo ice and in f luence 
in p u b l i c affairs. The C i v i l Society Consu l ta t ive C o u n c i l -representing a wide range o f 
CSOs- i s cu r ren t ly m o n i t o r i n g social po l ic ies -wh ich account for 44 percent o f the 
country’s expenditures- and regu la r ly in terac ts with the Government’s “social cabinet”. 
These organizations are also pa r t o f the “C i t izen F o r um ” (Foro Ciudadano) which 
comprises mo re than 200 CSOs spread out th rough the coun t r y . The Forum has p u b l i c l y 
denounced the im p u n i t y o f seve ra l co r rup t ion cases, and has also put f o rw a r d proposals 
fo r increasing transparency and access t o in fo rma t ion . Some CSOs have la te ly started to 

104 

focus o n m o n i t o r i n g the p u b l i c budget, pa r t icu la r ly the na t iona l budget and the 
a l loca t ions t o social expenditures. 
A l l of the above hamper development effectiveness o f Government interventions 
resulting in suboptimal policy outcomes. A Congress re la t ive ly weak, especially in 
te rm o f i t s oversight capacity, undermines representation o n the a l loca t ion o f resources 
and a l lows expenditure deviations f r om wha t was o r i g i n a l l y in the p u b l i c budget. The 
presence o f a n o t well a r t icu la ted c i v i l society with techn ica l weaknesses add t o the 
unce r ta in ty o f the p o l i c y m a k i n g process w h i c h tend t o be dom ina ted by the in te re s t o f 
the presidency. The Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o performance i s hampered b y these weaknesses, 
especially in the area o f disbursement due t o lack o f coo rd ina t ion between p lann ing and 
budge t ing . 

11. RECENT PROGRESS AND THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM AGENDA. 

Partly as a result o f the mounting concerns raised during the electoral campaign, 
but also accelerated by the worsening of economic conditions due to the financial 
c r i s i s , the Fernandez administration convened a national dialogue aimed at reaching 
consensus on a National Development Strategy. Despite signs o f skep t ic ism around the 
Government’s rea l comm i tmen t t o change, the dialogue convened b road pa r t ic ipa t ion 
f r o m dozens o f pub l ic , n o n p r o f i t and p r iva te organizations and umb re l la groups. The 
roundtables convened around a b road l i s t o f top ics concluded their w o r k with a l i s t o f 
proposals w h i c h h a d t o be approved b y the Execu t ive ’s representatives that were part o f 
each roundtable. Ins t i tu t iona l strengthening and transparency were transversal i s s u e s that 
emerged as central concerns in a l l the roundtables as ind ica ted b y the f i n a l Rapporteur’s 
summary. Am o n g the transparency measures inc luded in the proposal, i t i s no tewo r thy t o 
men t ion : increasing budget transparency and expenditures’ pub l ica t ion acco rd ing to their 
classification and components; increasing the transparency o f the Chamber o f Accoun ts 
(Camara de Cuentas) b y creating the access t o i n f o rm a t i o n o f f i c e and strengthening the 
mechanisms fo r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Access t o I n f o rm a t i o n L aw . 
I n the last few years the Government has passed important reforms33 that redefine 
the r o l e of the institutions involved in the planning and budgeting process. The 
Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Economy , P lann ing and Deve lopmen t - 
SEEPYD - have been established with a stronger mandate t o regulate and manage 
resource a l loca t ion and budget flows in detriment o f the Presidential O f f ice . The 1401 
fund o f the Presidency34 has been eliminated, the d isc re t iona l use o f revenue s u r p l u s e s 
has been regulated and the imp lemen ta t ion o f a f inanc ia l management i n f o rm a t i o n 
system has been enforced. SEEPYD , SEH and the Secretary o f Pub l ic Service are s i ning 
result agreements with the Secretary o f Labo r , Ag r icu l tu re , Educa t ion and H e a l t h 
f o r 
the 2010 Budge t .

Examples o f these laws are: 2006 Organic law on the Public Sector Budget, 2006 Creation o f State 
Secretariats for Treasury and Economy, Planning and Development, 2007 Financial Administration System 
o f the State law, 2006 Public credit law, 2006 Planning and Investment law, 2006 Government

3 4 The 1401 Fund was a discretionary spending h n d fed by revenue surp luses creating t h e incentive to 
underestimate revenue as a way to increase discretionary expenditure. 
These sec re ta r ies were picked on the basis o f their technical and infrastructure capacity to define and

This new public financial management framework paves the way f o r the adoption o f 
a medium-term expenditure framework and the use o f performance information to 
improve the quality o f public spending. Progress made in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
2006 O rgan ic l a w i s already im p r o v i n g the budget’s c red ib i l i ty , p red ic tab i l i ty and con t ro l 
fueled by recent tax re fo rms and the pos i t ive performance o f the economy in the period 
2005-2007. The budget n o w i d e n t i f i e s transfers and p ro jec ts o f decentralized agencies 
and the dev ia t ion between wha t i s in the budget and wha t i s f inanced by i t has been 
reduced. The Debt L a w has im p r o v e d debt managing and transparency. In the past, l i n e 
ministries w o u l d go d i rec t ly t o Congress t o in t roduce l o a n w i t h o u t any consideration fo r 
debt sus ta inab i l i ty . The inves tmen t and p lann ing - re la ted laws have strengthened con t ro l

criteria, investment i n f o rm a t i o n i s being systematized in the Pub l ic Inves tmen t Na t iona l

need. The Gove rnmen t i s p repa r ing the N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy and the Multi- 
A n n u a l Pub l ic Investment P lan . 
Nevertheless, many o f these reforms a r e still too recent and support i s needed to 
avoid backtracks in the light o f the international financial c r i s i s . Several challenges 
l a y ahead and further imp rovemen ts in p u b l i c f inanc ia l management are s t i l l needed such 
as the presentation o f f inanc ia l in fo rma t ion , non - f inanc ia l data f o r the public sector leve l , 
and imp roved f inanc ia l statements, the development o f an operational e f f ic iency capacity 
beyond lega l compliance, encompassing performance accoun tab i l i ty in the p rov is ion o f 
services and measurable imp rovemen ts in budget transparency (PEFA 2007). With 
assistance f r om the B a n k and the USAID, the Government has put in place a task force t o 
address the governance challenges. 

Challenges and Opportunities 

Nevertheless, many o f these reforms are still too recent and support i s needed to 
avoid backtracks in the light o f the international financial c r is is . Several cha l lenges 
l a y ahead and further imp rovemen ts in p u b l i c f inanc ia l management are s t i l l needed such 
as the presentation o f f inanc ia l in fo rma t ion , non - f inan c ia l data f o r the p u b l i c sector leve l , 
and improved f inanc ia l statements, the development o f an operational e f f ic iency capacity 
beyond lega l compliance, encompassing performance accoun tab i l i ty in the p r o v i s i o n o f 
services and measurable imp rovemen ts in budget transparency (PEFA 2007). With 
assistance f r o m the Bank and the U S A I D , the Government has put in place a task force to 
address the governance challenges. 
This present few risks as - in principle- the executive i s somewhat unconstraint and 
unaccountable- however, i t also provides some opportunities in the short term to 
improve the quality o f public spending and service delivery as there are fewer veto 
po in ts and a g r ow i n g social demand for this. Spec i f ica l ly , in education, health, agriculture 
and labor, the p i l o t Ministries that have agreed t o sign pe r fo rmance agreements, there i s 
an oppo r tun i ty t o m o v e towards some mo re e x p l i c i t contractual re la t ionsh ips between the 
line departments and the fund inghegu la t ing central agencies. This would enhance 
performance accoun tab i l i ty with more e x p l i c i t understandings about 
fund ing and 
deliverables in order to improve e f f ic iency and service de l ive ry in key areas, while

mov ing gradually the attention to strengthening the capacity o f Congress, the SA1 and the 
public at large to use performance information to undertake their oversight function. 

The Bank strategy i s aligned with the National Development Strategy that c a l l s for 

strengthening institutions at the national and regional levels, better quality o f public 
expenditures, public security, good governance, and the development o f a culture o f 
results w i th in the public administration. F rom the lending s ide the Bank has: (i) a 
Programmatic D P L on Performance and Accountability o f Social Sectors - which 
includes a component to support a se r ies o f reforms to bu i ld a culture o f results in public 
administration, (ii) a Mun ic ipa l Development Investment Loan, wh ich w i l l include 
institutional development activities to strengthening capacity o f loca l Governments and a 
(iii) Health Sector Reform Loan (PARSS 11) - wh ich includes a ser ies o f actions to 
support performance based management w i t h i n the health sector. F rom the AAA s ide the 
Bank has (i) Quality o f Public Expenditures NLTA, wh ich w i l l focus on improving the 
quality o f public expenditures in the DR by strengthening financial management and 
procurement mechanisms and strengthening the oversight capacity o f various actors36; (ii) 
an Institutional and Governance Review (ESW) wh ich w i l l focus on underlying po l i t ica l 
economy and governance i s s u e s that prevent the country f rom addressing fundamental 
development challenges in key sectors like education, health, and energy; and (iii) A se t 
o f safeguards capacity bu i ld ing activities, to offer assistance to the Dominican Republic 
to manage social and environmental opportunities and risks at a strategic level, for which 
analytical wo rk and technical assistance w i l l support the Dom in ican Republic in 
strengthening i ts norms and institutions to incorporate management o f the Bank’s 
safeguards policies as we l l as other international good practice frameworks in a 
coordinated manner. 

I n sum, the proposed approach f o r Bank engagement in Dominican Republic 
focuses on t w o lines o f activity- building on the recent improvements w ith in the 
executive while improving governance constraints on the executive. This means, 

leveraging on the recently approved reforms and ongoing initiatives to enhance 
performance accountability between the l i n e departments and the fundinghegulating 
central agencies in the short term. Similarly, i t i s important to continue p rov id ing Ban k ’s 
support to strengthen the wider governance environment in the long te rm , in the areas o f 
access to information, external audit and Congress 

3 6 This multisectoral N L T A includes the development o f a National Procurement Strategy, the application 
o f the OECD Indicators on procurement, technical assistance to SEEPyD, Finance and Public 
Administration, and the support to the DR Supreme Audit Institution. Activities on this front are closely 
coordinated with the IDB , the UNDP, and the European Commission, which i s already supporting the 
Secretary o f Public Administration with 8 million Euros.

Annex 9 : Country Financing Parameters 

Country Financing Parameters 
Du r ing the 2007 Country Po r t fo l io Performance Review (CPPR), the Government 
requested amendment o f the Country Financing Parameters (CFP) for the Dominican 
Republic to raise the Bank’s financing cost-share f rom 90 to 100 percent. The impetus 
for this change stems from a s e r i e s o f new laws that establish a framework o f e f f i c i e n t 
resource management and accountability in the Government’s budgeting process .37 
W i th in this new framework, the Government intends to align current budgeting standards 
on programming, budgeting, and administration w i t h international standards. These new 
laws w i l l also, among other measures, l im i t discretionary presidential and extra- 
budgetary spending, and eventually engender a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, 
expenditure po l icy and budgeting. 
In the past two years there has been a track record o f adequate and t ime ly allocation o f 
counterpart funds. In addition, a very positive outcome f rom the implementation o f the 
new Treasury L aw reduced the time i t took for the cycle o f transferring Bank proceeds 
f rom the Central Bank to the projects’ own operating accounts f rom 45 to 9 days. Based 
on improvements in this cycle, wh ich have effectively sped up p ro jec t execution, the 
Bank authorized, in M a y 2007, using advances as another disbursement method for new 
projects and now the borrower i s allowed to open Designated Accounts. 
In the 2005 CAS, the Government and the Bank agreed to limit the Bank’s financing 
share to 90 percent o f project costs, the rationale being to provide additional safeguards 
for Bank resources in l igh t o f i n e f f i c i e n t and opaque budget management processes in 
place at the time, as we l l as to provide a signal o f Government ownership and 
commitment. I t was expected that, over time, the Bank ’s average financing share wou ld 
increase as budget mechanisms improved w i t h the passing and implementation o f the 
new laws and a track record o f adequate and t ime ly allocation o f counterpart funds was 
established. 
The newly strengthened budget processes obviate the need fo r these safeguards (Le., l e s s 
than 100 percent Bank financing), and the lending program proposed in this CAS 
Progress Report r e f l e c t s close consultation w i t h the Government on their priorities and 
includes project-specific triggers designed to ensure Government commitment. Raising 
the CFP to 100 percent wou ld also alleviate existing constraints to implementing Bank 
projects. The new budget laws have in e f f e c t eliminated the previous f lex ib i l i t y to 
incorporate a budget l i n e item for contingencies that was used fo r counterpart funds. As 
a result, the deadline for inc lud ing projects in the annual budget i s September 30th, and 
the deadline for reviewing the budgets for active projects i s July 15th; with no line item 
for contingency, and the additional restriction o f including on ly approved projects in the 
budget, there i s l i t t l e f lex ib i l i ty to integrate counterpart funding for projects pending 
approval, This means that a l l projects ra t i f ied b y Congress after July 15 th in any given 
year stand l i t t l e chance o f receiving counterpart funding until a new budget i s prepared 12 
months la ter , effectively delaying implementation b y 1 8 months. 

3 7 The three laws promulgated in November and December 2006 that affect the budgeting process are: i) 
Law 498-06 on Public Planning and Investment, ii) Law 496-06 creating the State Secre tar ia t o f Economy, 
Planning and Development, and i i i ) Law 423-06 on Organic Budget for the Public Sector.

In addition to accelerating project implementation, the resulting increased f lex ib i l i ty 
wou ld a l low fo r more efficient project administration; with the phasing out o f the 
traditional pari passu approach, cost sharing needs are no longer determined at the level 
o f ind iv idua l expenditures, thus enabling project teams to focus more on technical aspects 
o f projects rather than on financing categories. 
There i s no expected impact o f the change in CFP on the po r t fo l io . Projects under 
execution w i l l not be affected as the Government has indicated that i t w i l l continue 
considering counterpart allocations on projects under execution a first p r io r i t y in the 
budget process. Potential impact o n the pipeline i s positive fo r some projects, nil for 
others. Projects under preparation w i l l benefit f r om this f l e x i b i l i t y and any counterpart 
contribution w i l l be applied on a selective and case-by-case merit/justification. 
W i t h the exception o f Cost Sharing, other themes on the CFP, such as Recurrent Cost 
Financing and Loca l Cost Financing, remain unchanged f r om the o r ig ina l DR CAS o f 
M a y 2005. The composition o f taxes and duties remains largely unchanged, w i t h the 
exception o f lowe r projected t a r i f f revenues in conjunction w i t h the Dom in ican Republic- 
Central American Free Trade Agreement wh ich became effective in Ma rch 2007. 

Item 

A. Cost Sharing 
L im i t on the proportion o f individual 
project costs that the Bank may 
finance 

B. Recurrent Cost Financing. Any 
limits that would apply to the overall 
amount o f recurrent expenditures that 
the Bank may finance. The two 
requirements for Bank financing o f 
loca l expenditures are met. Therefore. 
the Bank can finance local 
C . Local Cost Financing. 
Financing met: (i) financing 
requirements for the country’s 
development program would exceed the 
public sector’s own 
resources (e.g., from taxation and 
other revenues) and expected domestic 
borrowing; and ( i i ) the financing o f 
foreign expenditures alone would not 
enable the Bank to a s s i s t in the 
financing o f individual projects. 
D. Taxes and Duties. 
Are there any taxes and duties that the 
Bank would not finance?

Explanation/Remark 

Some individual projects may be 
financed up to 100%. Financing up to 
100% w i l l be applied on a s e l e c t i v e 
and case-by-case meriVjustification. 

The two requirements for Bank 
financing o f loca l expenditures are 
met. Therefore, the Bank can finance 
loca l costs in proportions needed in 
individual projects 

Yes 

None 

The two requirements for the Bank 
financing o f lo ca l expenditure are met. 
Therefore, the Bank can finance loca l 
costs i n the proportion needed in 
individual projects. 

N o taxes or duties are currently 
Identified as unreasonable or 
discriminatory. A t the project level, the 
Bank would consider whether taxes 
and duties constitute excessively high 
share o f eroiect exeenditures.
