EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. The poorest country in the M N A region, Yemen i s facing daunting challenges in an 

uncertain global and regional environment. S i g n i f i c a n t progress has been made o v e r t h e las t 
f e w years, but living cond i t ions f o r m o s t o f the 2 2 m i l l i o n Y em e n i s r em a i n d i f f i c u l t . Yemen ’s 
governance structures are c om p l e x and recen t events have he igh tened concerns o v e r secur i ty 
issues. Y em e n i s u n l i k e l y t o reach m o s t M i l l e n n i u m D e v e l o pm e n t Goa ls (MDGs) by 2015, and 
the s i tua t ion i s p a r t i c u l a r l y d i r e f o r women . T h e Gove rnmen t i s im p l em e n t i n g a p r o g r am o f 
econom ic and governance re forms , but t im e i s o f t h e essence as o i l resources are r a p i d l y 
dep le t ing w h i l e the p o p u l a t i o n con t inues t o g r o w a t a fas t pace. 

ii. The impact of the global crisis is already severe. T h e sharp f a l l in w o r l d o i l prices, and the 

consequent shrinking in p u b l i c expenditure, i s depress ing econom ic a c t i v i t y . Mo reove r , w h i l e the 
f i n a n c i a l sector has rema ined r e l a t i v e l y unsca thed due t o i t s r e l a t i v e insu la t ion , the im p a c t on the 
r e a l sector i s expec ted t o be s ign i f ican t t h r o u g h dec l ines in FDI, rem i t tances (espec ia l ly f r o m the 
Gulf), and ex te rna l f inanc ing . T h e Gove rnmen t rea l izes the p ress ing need f o r a comprehens ive 
f i s c a l adjustment, but the r i s k s o f a de te r io ra t ion o f t h e econom ic s i tua t ion a re high. 

iii. The Government has set out an ambitious vision for the country’s development with far 

greater emphasis on d i v e r s i f y i n g the economy ( t h r o u g h p r i v a t e sec tor- led ac t iv i t ies) , enhanc ing 
governance, 
im p r o v i n g soc ia l cond i t ions , and m a n a g i n g na tu ra l resources t h a n p r e v i o u s l y 
a r t icu la ted in Yemen . T h e de te r io ra t ion in the g l o b a l env i ronmen t has fu r the r he igh tened b o t h 
the needs t o im p l em e n t this amb i t ious agenda and t h e d i f f i c u l t i e s in d o i n g so. 

iv . The Bank Group has a long-standing relationship with Yemen, and implementation of the 
2006-2009 CAS i s rated moderately satisfactory (results we re ach ieved p a r t i a l l y o r comp le te ly 

f o r 2 0 o f the 2 6 pe r fo rmance ind ica tors) . T h e im p a c t o f the p r o g r am i s expected t o b e sustainable 
in the med ium - te rm , p r o v i d e d con t inued Gove rnmen t c omm i tm e n t and e f f o r t s in the next C A S 
pe r iod . Past exper ience shows tha t the B a n k G r o u p has been e f f e c t i v e at suppo r t ing r e f o rm s as 
w e l l as a t s treng then ing o v e r a l l imp lemen ta t ion capac i ty (in the sectors whe re there i s an ac t ive 
program) . Expe r ience also highlights the impo r tance o f p r o v i d i n g hands-on im p l em e n t a t i o n 
suppor t in a n env i ronmen t o f w e a k i n s t i t u t i o n a l capac i ty . 

v. The overall objective of 
the Bank Group’s program proposed in this CAS i s to facilitate 
Yemen’s further uromess towards the M D G s . This ob jec t ive re f lec ts a consensus v i e w 

expressed by Gove rnmen t a n d stakeholders with r e g a r d t o the challenges the c o u n t r y i s f a c i n g 
and the o p t im a l use o f B a n k G r o u p resources. In a con tex t whe re t h e l a c k o f econom ic and soc ia l 
oppo r tun i t ies i s o f t e n seen as c rea t ing a n env i ronmen t whe re frus tra t ions can b e e x p l o i t e d by 
v i o l e n t extremists, successful deve lopmen t e f f o r t s are a lso l i k e l y t o con t r ibu te t o s treng then ing 
the prospects f o r the coun t ry ’s (and the sub-region’s) m e d i um - t e rm s tab i l i ty . 

v i . The proposed CAS program foresees a broad-based, yet selective engagement across a 

variety of sectors. T h e authorities, stakeholders, a n d o ther deve lopmen t par tners have c a l l e d on 
the B a n k G r o u p t o subs tan t ive ly engage in a n um b e r o f sectors in order t o p r o v i d e a core p r o g r am 
a round w h i c h others can coalesce. In o rde r t o a v o i d a d ispe rs ion and d i l u t i o n o f e f for ts , however , 
the B a n k G r o u p w i l l a p p l y se lec t iv i ty : (i) in the c h o i c e o f thema t ic areas f o r engagement (at b o t h 
sec tora l and sub-sectoral levels); (ii) in the cho ice o f ins trumen ts f o r engagement (Techn ica l 
Assistance, ana ly t ica l w o r k , f i n a n c i a l suppor t t h r o u g h IDA o r IFC); and (iii) in t h e des ign o f 
i n d i v i d u a l produc ts (keep ing them s imp le so as t o f a c i l i t a t e imp lemen ta t ion ) .

‘ 

v i i . The proposed CAS program was designed in close cooperation between IDA and I F C , as 
one o f the p i lo ts under the recent in i t ia t ive by the j o i n t I D A - I F C Secretariat. This i s translating 
in to an e f fo r t to be t ter integrate relevant ac t iv i t ies b y bo th institutions, through: (i) the j o i n t 
des ign o f t h e resu l ts framework; and (ii) t h e iden t i f ica t ion o f “target strategic themes” (Le. 
f inanc ia l sector, business environment, energy, mining, and health) where mechanisms have been 
put in place t o pursue close cooperation throughout the C A S period. 
... v i i i . Bank Group assistance under the CAS is organized around four strategic objectives, 
wh ich are closely aligned with the Government program: 
(i) Help accelerate and diversify economic g row th (macroeconomic stability; pr iva te sector 
development; infrastructure; support t o non -o i l drivers o f growth); 
(ii) Help enhance governance (transparency; pub l ic finance management; c i v i l service); 
(iii)Help foster human and social development (cross sectoral issues such as gender, youth, 
and qat; education and health; commun i ty development and social protection); and 
(iv) Help manage na tura l resource scarcity and natural risks (water resources; natural 
disasters and c l ima te change). 

ix . The Bank Group intends to use the fu l l spectrum of available instruments: managing the 
existing po r t fo l ios (IDA and IFC); p rov id ing continued f inanc ia l support (IDA, Trust Funds, IFC , 
and possibly MIGA); us ing the Bank Group’s convening power (to help mob i l ize , implement, 
and harmonize aid); p rov id ing further ana ly t ica l and advisory services (IDA and IFC); and 
scaling up capac i ty-bu i ld ing and learning activities. 

x. 

I n particular, the Bank Group w i l l aim to make use of 
its resources to support the 
Government in facing the challenges associated with the global crisis, building on lessons 
lea rned during the food crisis and using options available under the IDA Fast-Track Fac i l i ty and 
the I F C Cr is is Response In i t ia t ives . I n the short-term, this includes p rov id ing macroeconomic 
po l icy advice (underway), identifying possible re-allocations o f IDA resources within the ex is t ing 
po r t fo l io t o help m i t iga te the impac t o f the crisis on the poor, and wo rk ing with pr iva te partners to 
prov ide l iqu id i ty support through trade finance fac i l i t ies . As the g loba l s i tua t ion evolves, the 
Bank Group may propose substantial adjustments t o the proposed program in the C A S Progress 
Report, wh ich i s currently scheduled fo r FY 1 1 (but cou ld be advanced o r delayed i f appropriate). 

xi. The proposed CAS program entails an element of 
risk which w i l l have to be carefully 
managed. Consistent with past exper ience in Yemen, the proposed approach i s based on p ro - 
active risk management rather than risk avoidance. Key r i s k s include: f rag i l i ty o f the po l i t ica l 
and secu r i ty environment; negative external economic environment and macroeconomic shocks; 
diminished Government’s comm i tmen t o r ab i l i ty t o reform; and f iduc ia ry risks. 

x i i . Executive Directors may wish to consider the following issues: 
(i) D o Execu t ive D irec tors support the proposed areas o f focus (against the backdrop o f 
requests by bo th Government and stakeholders fo r a broad-based Bank Group 
engagement that wou ld help mob i l ize others and strengthen imp lemen ta t ion capacity)? 
(ii) Are Execu t ive D irec tors satisfied that the proposed risk management approach i s 
appropriate, inc lud ing with regard t o risks deriving f r om current g loba l economic 
uncertainties ? 
( i i i )D o Executive D irec tors support the proposed approach t o integrate IDA and IFC 
activities under the C A S framework?

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. The poorest country in the MNA region, Yemen is facing daunting challenges in an 

uncertain global and regional environment. S i g n i f i c a n t progress has been made over the last 
f e w years, but l iv ing cond i t ions f o r m o s t o f the 22 m i l l i o n Y em e n i s r em a i n d i f f i c u l t . T im e i s o f 
the essence in m a k i n g the necessary re fo rms : o i l resources are r a p i d l y dep le t ing w h i l e the 
p o p u l a t i o n con t inues t o g r o w a t a fas t pace - and the g e o p o l i t i c a l stakes are high. Ye t , this w i l l 
b e a d i f f i c u l t process, and w i l l requ i re de te rm ined and coo rd ina ted e f f o r t s by the Government, 
stakeholders, and in te rna t iona l partners. 

A. Political Context 

2. Yemen’spolitical context needs to be analyzed against the backdrop of the country’s history. 

“A r a b i a Fe l ix” , Y em e n i s a k e y s ta t ion o n b o t h anc ien t and m o d e r n trade and commun ica t ions 
rou tes at t h e Sou thern entrance o f the R e d Sea. A s t rong sense o f n a t i o n a l i d e n t i t y l e d t o the 1990 
r e u n i f i c a t i o n o f N o r t h a n d Sou th Y em e n and, in sp i te o f the 1994 c i v i l war, s t i l l in fuses p o l i t i c a l 
and soc ia l l i f e . Ye t , Y em e n has a lso l o n g been one o f the m o s t sec luded places in the wo r ld , with 
v e r y p o o r c omm u n i c a t i o n be tween remo te va l leys in a l a r g e l y moun ta inous and a r i d coun try . 
This has h a d a s i g n i f i c a n t im p a c t on the soc ia l fab r ic o f the c o u n t r y a n d i t s governance structures. 

3 . Overall, Yemen’s governance structures remain complex. 

The political system is a formal multi-party democratic system. There i s a r e l a t i v e l y 

f ree press, and a n ac t ive and v o c a l oppos i t ion . Pres iden t Saleh was e lec ted in September 
2006 f o r a s ix-year t e rm in a n e lec t ion w h i c h was c a l l e d by EU observers “an open and 
genu ine contest”, despite shor tcom ings . Pa r l iamen ta ry e l e c t i o n o r i g i n a l l y scheduled f o r 
April / M a y 2 0 0 9 we re pos tponed t o 2 0 1 1 t h r o u g h an agreemen t be tween the m a j o r i t y 
and the m a i n o p p o s i t i o n parties. 

The underlying social structure is largely based on a tr iba l system, whe re the p ow e r o f 

t r a d i t i o n a l leaders p laces limits o n State au tho r i ty . M o s t Y em e n i s tend t o de f ine their 
i d e n t i t y and a f f i l i a t i o n s t h r o u g h this t r i b a l system, and in a c o u n t r y whe re weapons are 
c omm o n l y ava i lab le the sheikhs o f t e n p l a y a s ign i f ican t r o l e a t the l o c a l leve l . 

Most institutions are relatively weak, as re f lec ted by the l o w CPIA (3.3). 

Insu f f ic ienc ies 
are re la ted t o capac i ty issues, corrup t ion , over- o r inadequa te s t a f f i n g in the c i v i l service 
(a legacy o f t h e 1990 r e u n i f i c a t i o n w h e n e x i s t i n g c i v i l services we re me rged w i t h o u t 
re form) , and the pe rs is t ing need t o c l a r i f y i n s t i t u t i o n a l manda tes and structures. 

The society is going through a transformation process. N e w forces are c om i n g i n t o the 

fore, with t h e g r o w i n g r o l e o f the p r i v a t e sector and t h e g radua l emergence o f c i v i l 
society. In a moun ta inous coun try , whe re until r e c e n t l y t h e va l leys in w h i c h a large part 
o f t h e p o p u l a t i o n l i v e s we re severely isolated, u r b a n i z a t i o n and m o d e r n i z a t i o n are 
cha l leng ing some o f the long-en trenched features o f the t r a d i t i o n a l order. 

4. Over the last years, Yemen has had to face a number of security issues, espec ia l ly f o l l o w i n g 

the 2000 a t tack on t h e U S S Co le . W h i l e an o v e rw h e lm i n g m a j o r i t y o f t h e p o p u l a t i o n l ives in safe 
and peace fu l env ironmen ts , the s i tua t ion rema ins comp lex . A (Sh i i te)

have con t r ibu ted t o p r o j e c t i n g the image o f a c o u n t r y a f f l i c t e d by endem ic v io lence . 

5 . I n this context, continued efforts w i l l be needed to consolidate political stability and security 

throughout the country - t w o k e y p re -cond i t ions f o r e f fec t ive econom ic and soc ia l deve lopmen t . 
A l t h o u g h there are d i v e r g i n g v i ew s am o n g observers as t o the prospects f o r such e f f o r t s t o b e 
successful, there i s a consensus tha t p a r t i c u l a r a t ten t ion shou ld be p a i d in the c om i n g p e r i o d t o t h e 
f o l l o w i n g areas: 

First, political inclusion. T h e cha l lenge i s t o ensure tha t im p o r t a n t cons t i tuenc ies can

6. Despite some progress, Yemen is unlikely to reach key M i l lenn ium Development Goals 

(MDGs) by 2015 . With GDP p e r cap i ta standing a t abou t US$930 , ove r 4 0 percen t o f the 
Yemen is l i v e in p o v e r t y (vs. a 2015 targe t o f 19 percent), espec ia l ly in r u r a l areas. Y em e n ranks 
153 o u t o f 177 coun tr ies on the 2007 H um a n D e v e l o pm e n t I n d e x . There has been progress with 
rega rd t o l i f e expec tancy ( f r om 42 years in 1970 t o 62 in 2005), and a s ign i f ican t , t h o u g h s t i l l 
insu f f ic ien t , increase in bas ic educa t ion en ro l lmen t ( f r om 3 m i l l i o n in 1996 t o 4.3 m i l l i o n in 
2007). Ye t , m u c h rema ins t o b e done, espec ia l ly in the areas o f i n f a n t a n d c h i l d m o r t a l i t y (82 and 
113 pe r 1000 l i v e births respec t ive ly) ; ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y (365 pe r 100,000 l i v e births); 
m a l n u t r i t i o n (46 percen t o f 5-year o l d are underwe igh t) ; and the q u a l i t y o f education. In add i t ion , 
in sp i te o f s ign i f ican t inves tmen ts in the las t decade, Y em e n has n o t caught up on i t s 
in f ras t ruc tu re lag, with access t o m a n y r u r a l areas r em a i n i n g d i f f i c u l t , e l e c t r i c i t y coverage l im i t e d 
(abou t 4 7 percen t na t ion -w ide , and abou t 20 percen t in r u r a l areas), and access t o safe wa te r 
i n s u f f i c i e n t (36 percent). U n em p l o ym e n t i s widespread, espec ia l ly am o n g you th .

7. Yemeni women face particularly difficult conditions as reflected in almost a l l social and 

economic indicators. Trad i t iona l r u l e s limit women’s r igh ts and opportunities, and early 
marriages (52 percent o f women ma r ry before the age o f 15) continue t o affect school enrollment, 
fe r t i l i ty rates, and maternal mo r ta l i ty . Desp i te progress over the last years, gender pa r i ty in 
education remains l o w (0.66 fo r basic, 0.45 fo r secondary, and 0.35 fo r un ivers i ty education) and 
female l i teracy stands at on ly 31 percent. Deep-rooted traditions also constrain the ab i l i ty o f 
women t o engage in the broad labor force. Overall, a recent W o r l d Econom ic Fo rum repor t on 
gender issues (“Global Gender Gap 2 0 0 7 ” ) ranked Yemen the lowest o f 128 countries. 

8 . The rapid depletion of water reserves (aquifers) i s a major threat to the country as a result o f 

three factors: (i) climate change-induced alterations o f ra in fa l ls wh ich are starting t o exacerbate 
the country’s aridity; (ii) extension and in tens i f ica t ion o f agriculture; and (iii) fast g row th o f 
urban cen ters (at 5 pe rcen t a year, the fastest in the MNA Region). In large swaths o f ru ra l areas, 
economic prospects and the sustainability o f l ive l ihoods are in jeopardy. In some important cities 
(e.g., Tai’z), running water i s already available on ly a few hours e v e r y other week and aquifers o f 
urban centers such as t h e capital, Sana’a, may well be fully exhausted in t h e next 20 years. T h i s issue 
has t h e potential to wreak havoc on the country. 

9. The widespread use of qat further affects Yemen’s social conditions andprospects. Qat i s a 

locally-produced plant, the leaves o f wh ich are chewed as a stimulant. Consumption in Yemen i s 
widespread and extensive: about 72 percent o f men and 33 percen t o f women are regular o r 
frequent chewers. The impac t o f excessive qat consumption i s mu l t i - fo ld : at the ind iv idua l level, 
poor health and reduced produc t iv i ty ; at the household leve l , d ivers ion o f scarce f inanc ia l 
resources t o non-productive uses (the average household devotes 10 percent o f i t s income t o qat); 
at the national leve l , substitution o f agr icu l tura l products (land planted with qat has increased by 
11 t imes be tween 1970 and 2005) and accelerated draw ing on water resources (qat cu l t iva t ion 
consumes one-third o f the abstracted groundwater). Yet, qat consumption i s deeply rooted in 
Yemen’s cu l ture and social behaviors. Qat also represents one third o f agr icu l tura l GDP and i s 
the ma in source o f income to 14 percent o f the population. 

10. Overall, Yemen’s social challenges are exacerbated by a fast-paced demographic growth. 

Nea r ly 50 percent o f the popu la t ion i s be low 15. D e s p i t e a 25 percent decline b e tw e e n 1960 and 
2003, the to ta l fe r t i l i ty rate remains among the highest in the world, at 6.2 b ir ths per woman, i.e. a 
demographic g row th rate o f over 3 percent a year. At this pace, Yemen’s popu la t ion cou ld grow 
f rom 22 m i l l i o n today to 50 m i l l ion by 2035 - in an environment o f l im i ted and depleting natural 
resources. 

C. Econom ic context 

Recent developments 

11. Over the last decades Yemen’s economy has been based on o i l , with the red is tr ibu t ion o f 

corresponding ren ts through c i v i l service salaries and a generous subsidy system. Hydrocarbon 
output ( o i l and gas) represents about one third o f GDP (Figure l), almost th ree quarters o f 
Government revenues, and 90 percent o f exports. However, Yemen’s o i l r e s e r v e s are rap id ly 
depleting (Figure 2): in the absence o f new discoveries, and based on current exp lo i ta t ion rates 
(about 300,000 barrels per day), crude o i l reserves are expected to be exhausted in t h e nex t 10 to 
12 years.

12. Since 2004, the Government has made efforts 
to enhance the business environment and 
facilitate private sector-led economic diversification. Recent achievements include: imp rov ing 

the regulatory environment (Yemen was top re former fo r “starting a business” under Doing 
Business 2009, and i t s ove ra l l rank ing improved by 15 places); amending legislations on fore ign 
investment, mining, land registration, and income tax; further l ibe ra l iz ing trade; and developing a 
dialogue to strengthen reg iona l economic cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Counc i l (GCC). 

I n parallel, the Government has taken some steps towards improving governance and 

13. 
f ight ing corruption. Key measures include: j o i n i n g the Ex trac t ive Industries Transparency 
In i t ia t ive (EITI); e f fec t ive ly establishing the Supreme Na t iona l An t i -Co r rup t ion Committee 
(SNACC); tak ing s teps towards e l im ina t ing “ghost workers” and “double dippers” f r om the 
pub l ic service payro l l ; adopting a new procurement law based on in terna t iona l good practices; 
and starting t o improve pub l ic finance management. 

14. Overall, these efforts are starting to pay offt but signijicant challenges remain. W h i l e 

national accounts rema in weak and s ign i f ican t discrepancies exist across sources o f key 
macroeconomic data, a l l indicators po in t toward overa l l progress. Acco rd ing t o the IMF, Yemen 
recorded an average non-hydrocarbon g row th rate o f 5 . 5 percent per annum over 2004-08, wh ich 
was large ly d r iven by agriculture, urban services, and construction. Ove ra l l rea l GDP g row th 
never the less remains lower, averaging about 4 percent a year, due to the sharp contraction o f o i l 
output estimated at an average o f about 6 . 5 pe rcen t per annum over the same per iod (Figure 3). 
Annua l average in f la t ion has been vo la t i le and in double digits (Figure 4), pa r t ly d r iven by 
Yemen’s dependence o n impor ts fo r basic products. The country was ha rd hit by the 2008 food 
crisis, wh ich especially affected the poorest (with overa l l in f la t ion peak ing at 19 percent).

15. Fiscal sustainability is the foremost macroeconomic issue, as the reduction o f o i l revenues 
i s not sufficiently compensated by increased revenues from other sources (tax revenues remain 
very low a t around 7 percent o f GDP). Government spending i s driven by a large public sector 
wage b i l l and unsustainably high fuel 
subsidies (around 14.5 percent o f 
GDP 
in 2008), which 
together 
account for 72 percent o f current 
expenditure. 
The 
f isca l deficit 
ballooned to 5.8 percent o f GDP in 
2007 (Figure 5) due to a sharp f a l l in 
o i l revenues and 
expenditure. The f i s c a l deficit i s 
estimated to remain in the range o f 5 
to 6 percent o f GDP in 2008 in the 
context o f declining o i l prices, 
continued rigid expenditures, and 
limited improvements in tax and non- 
o i l revenues. Towards the end o f 2008, a large supplementary budget was approved (as in 
previous years) to allow fo r additional spending on f u e l subsidies and an increase i n wages, 
pensions, and social welfare transfers. 

rising curren t 

1 6 . The external position remains satisfactory, but significant vulnerabilities remain. The 
Government has been maintaining a "managed f loa t" exchange ra te system, and monetary policy 
has focused on exchange rate stability and control o f excess liquidity in the banking system. The 
r i a l has remained steady against the US dollar, which has helped mitigate imported inflation. The 
current account balance moved into a large deficit in 2007 mainly due to FDI-financed imports 
fo r the Yemen Liquefied Na tura l Gas (YLNG) plant. W h i l e record high o i l prices in early 2008 
have helped reduce the current account deficit to around 2 percent o f GDP in 2008 (Figure 5 
above), the external sector w i l l remain vulnerable to the more recen t declines in o i l prices. On a 
positive note, gross o f f i c i a l reserves are estimated to remain a t the 2007 levels o f around US$7 
billion in 2008, providing a substantial cushion o f about 13 months o f imports. 

17. Although external debt has steadily declined, 
its sustainabilitv continues to be at risk due to 
Yemen's vulnerability to o i l prices, and to 
sustained difficulties in implementing f isca l and 
subsidy reforms. Yemen's external debt has 
declined steadily to an estimated 22 percent o f 
GDP in 2008, but domestic debt (a l l short-term and 
expensive) i s on the r i s e - estimated at nearly 16 
percent o f GDP in 2008 (Figure 6). U n l e s s the

o f GDP to over 65 percent o f GDP i n the medium-term, primarily due to a more than doubling o f 
domestic debt. The most recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that even with full 
implementation o f f i s c a l and s truc tura l reforms, one debt indicator (the present value o f debt-to- 
exports) i s above the sustainability threshold over the long-term (see Annex 4 fo r further details).

Short-term prospects and medium-term outlook 

18. The impact of the global crisis is already severe. The sharp f a l l in world o i l prices, and the 
consequent shrinking in public expenditure, i s depressing economic activity. Moreover, while the 
f inanc ia l sector has remained relatively unscathed due to i t s relative insulation, the impact on the 
r e a l sector i s expected to be s ign i f ican t through declines in FDI, remittances (especially from the 
Gulf), and external financing. The short-term impact on growth may be partly mitigated (or 
masked) by the coming on-line o f t h e large natural gas project in 2009 (YLNG) which i s expected 
to boost hydrocarbon growth in 2009 by up to 45 percent, resulting in overall GDP growth o f 7.7 
percent. Concerted e f fo r ts (monetary and exchange rate) w i l l remain necessary to curb annual 
average in f la t ion to around 14 percent in 2009, in spite o f easing pressures due to lower global 
commodity prices. And while detailed data are no t available, t h e c r is is i s expected to 
disproportionately a f fec t the poorest and most vulnerable (a household survey i s under 
preparation and i s expected to take place by Spring 20 10). 

I n this context, the Government realizes the pressing need for comprehensive f isca l 

19. 
adjustment. This would entail reducing expenditure (fuel subsidies and the public sector wage 
bill), which i s a politically sensitive endeavor. Fuel subsidies were reduced slightly in August 
2008 with the raising o f the price o f diesel fo r sales to se lec t industries - a positive but 
insufficient measure given the size o f the overall subsidy. In order to keep the f isca l deficit a t 
leas t a t last year’s level (below 6 percent o f GDP) in 2009, the authorities need to reduce f u e l 
subsidies substantially by mid-year, implement a nominal freeze on the public sector wage bill, 
and boost tax revenues. In order to reduce in f la t ion and maintain confidence in the rial, the 
Central Bank i s expected to continue to focus on exchange ra te stability in the short-term. The 
authorities are also currently discussing a public debt law with ceilings fo r domestic, external, and 
overall public debt, as well as measures t o drastically cut the investment budget. In the medium- 
term, Yemen needs to develop alternative sources o f growth and f i s c a l revenues. 

20. A t this stage, the scope of possible external shocks is such that detailedprojections and 
scenarios are of 
limited value and bound to change substantially. The baseline macro- 

economic framework i s based on an ambitious reform program for which substantial Government 
commitment and external support would be needed. This program i s focused on: (i) gradually 
eliminating f u e l subsidies by 2011; (ii) reducing the civil service wage b i l l by around 2 
percentage points o f GDP by 2013; and (iii) implementing substantial tax reforms, including fu l l 
implementation o f GST as well as an increase in rates, and streamlining income tax. This 
adjustment scenario i s guided by a debt sustainability analysis geared to keeping total public debt 
below 50 percent o f GDP over the medium-term. Based on these adjustment measures, and 
assuming an average o i l price o f almost US$70 per barrel, Yemen’s average economic growth 
would be around 4.5 percent a year during 2010-2012. Annual inflation would decrease, but 
remain in double digits. The average f i s c a l deficit would decline to around 3 percent o f GDP. 
The average curren t account deficit would stabilize a t about 1.5 percent o f GDP, while gross 
reserves would decline to around 8.5 months o f imports during this period (Table 1).

21. The above scenarios hinge on the severity and duration of the global economic downturn, 
wh ich w i l l become more apparent later in the year. Ea r ly s t ress tes ts indicate that Yemen w i l l be 
affected in the fo l low ing manner by a continued decline in o i l prices, a weakening o f reg iona l and 
g loba l growth, and limited access t o external financing: 

A continued fa l l of o i l prices would cause fiscal and current account imbalances to 
rise. F o r each US$ lO /bb l decline, the ove ra l l f isca l and current account balance wou ld 
deteriorate by almost 1 percentage po in t o f GDP. The f isca l impac t cou ld be m i t iga ted 
by a corresponding decline in f u e l subsidies, and pressure on the external account may be 
pa r t ia l ly alleviated i f g loba l commod i ty prices keep fa l l ing . 

Slower regional and global growth would bring lower levels of non-oil FDI, 
remittances, andpossibly a id . A 50 percent dec l ine in non -o i l FDI wou ld likely reduce 
grow th and the current account de f ic i t (each by around 0.5 percent o f GDP). A 50 
percent f a l l in remittances wou ld widen the curren t account de f ic i t by 0.5 percent o f 
GDP, marg ina l ly lowe r rea l GDP growth, and have an impor tan t impac t on poverty. A 
50 percent f a l l in a id disbursements wou ld ma rg ina l ly widen the ove ra l l f isca l deficit, and 
increase domestic debt by 1.2 percent o f GDP. A combined loss o f non -o i l FDI, 
remittances, and donor f inanc ing wou ld result in the f isca l and current account de f ic i ts 
deteriorating by 1-1.5 percent o f GDP, pub l ic sector domestic debt rising by around 2.5-3 
percent o f GDP, and in terna t iona l rese rves dropp ing by one mon th o f imports.

22. The Government has set out an ambitious vision for the country’s development with far 

greater emphasis o n diversifying the economy ( th rough p r i v a t e sec tor- led activities), enhanc ing 
governance, 
im p r o v i n g soc ia l cond i t ions , and manag ing n a t u r a l resources than p r e v i o u s l y

23. The “Strategic Vision 2025” has been translated into a series of successive nationalplans, 

w h i c h have been discussed with Par l iamen t , stakeholders, and in te rna t iona l partners. T h e Third

24. The DPPR is complemented by the Nat iona l Reform Agenda and the Public Investment 

Program. T h e N a t i o n a l R e f o rm Agenda sets a b r o a d agenda o f p r i o r i t y r e f o rm s f o r the c o u n t r y

inves tmen ts in suppor t o f the DPPR . 

25. Overall, these plans revolve around a narrow set of overarching goals andprovide a sound 
framework for identzfiing priorities -yet , as in many other IDA countries, they reflect some of 
the capacity and data constraints Yemen is facing. In pa r t icu la r , the p r i o r i t i e s r em a i n very b r o a d

26. The f irst overarching goal is to accelerate economic growth through private sector-led 

diverszjication. T o tha t effect, the D P P R a ims t o a t trac t p r i v a t e inves tmen t and deve lop an

P r i o r i t y econom ic governance r e f o rm s are essen t ia l ly re la ted t o three se ts o f issues : 

0 Transparency. T h e D P P R emphasizes the impo r tance o f fighting c o r r u p t i o n in a l l areas, 
and highlights a number o f p r i o r i t y ac t ions t o tha t effect,

dec is ions w h i c h can h e l p sustain the m om e n t um f o r fu r the r progress. 

Public finance management. T h e DPPR ’s a im o f im p r o v i n g e f f i c i e n c y and transparency 
has been opera t iona l ized in a P u b l i c F inance Managemen t R e f o rm Strategy, w h i c h was 
designed by the Gove rnmen t with the suppor t o f a g roup o f donors ( i n c l u d i n g the B a n k

execu t ion and i n f o rm a t i o n systems); con t ro ls and accoun tab i l i ty ; procuremen t ; and s k i l l s . 
T h e cha l lenge f o r the au tho r i t ies w i l l b e t o r a p i d l y make progress whe re poss ib le in the 
short-term, w h i l e p r e p a r i n g f o r an e f f o r t tha t w i l l need t o b e sustained o v e r the m e d i um -

Administrative capacity. T h e D P PR a ims t o strengthen capac i ty t h r o u g h the fu r the r 
mode rn iza t ion o f the c i v i l service. This w o u l d i n c l u d e a r a t i o n a l i z a t i o n o f i n s t i t u t i o n a l

w i l l b e t o set the right pace f o r such re forms , w h i c h are u r g e n t l y needed but w i l l need t o 
be imp lemen ted am ids t abundan t techn ica l comp lex i t ies and vested interests. 

28. The third overarching goal i s to improve living conditions and social indicators. O v e r the 

las t period, the Gove rnmen t has success fu l ly focused o n expand ing access t o bas ic services in a 
con tex t o f r a p i d demograph ic g r ow t h . T h e DPPR a ims t o pursue this e f fo r t , w h i l e a t the same 
t im e r e f o rm i n g o r even t r a n s f o rm i n g d e l i v e r y mechan isms t o im p r o v e e f fec t iveness and qua l i ty . 
T h e Gove rnmen t i s also beginning t o underscore the s ign i f icance o f c rea t ing synergies among 
sectors t o m a g n i f y im p a c t o f sector ou tcomes and i n f l u e n c i n g the MDG outcomes. 

0 Gender. T h e D P PR a ims t o further tack le a comp lex w e b o f economic, social, cu l tura l , 
and lega l obstacles t o women ’s empowermen t . In par t icu lar , the D P P R a ims t o increase 
women ’s emp loymen t in b o t h p r i v a t e and p u b l i c sectors and t h e i r p a r t i c i p a t i o n in l o c a l

p r o v i d e a c lear a c t i o n p l a n t o m o v e f r o m w h a t can b e ach ieved t h r o u g h l e g a l means t o the 
necessary soc ia l trans forma t ions tha t can u n d e r p i n sustainable progress. 

Qat . T h e D P P R highlights the c om p l e x i t y o f the qat issue and i t s link with ag r icu l tu ra l

I t hence recommends t o address i t in a n “ob jec t ive , 
in fo rmed , and g radua l 
fashion”, with a focus o n “striking a ba lance be tween i t s economic, social, hea l th and 
env i ronmen ta l aspects”. E f f o r t s t o date have focused on r a i s i n g awareness and launch ing 
a d ia logue with stakeholders. 

Youth. The DPPR ’s conce rn with c h i l d r e n and y o u t h issues has trans la ted i n t o the 
adop t ion o f a B a n k Group-suppor ted C h i l d r e n and Y o u t h Strategy. This Strategy a ims t o

across sectors, based o n a n assessment o f needs, gaps, challenges, and poss ib le so lu t ions . 
T h e Strategy recommenda t ions we re fu r the r e labora ted in f o r m o f A c t i o n P lans t o inc lude 
spec i f ic ac t iv i t ies and targets f o r re levan t l i n e m i n i s t r i e s as part o f t h e i r respec t ive sector

t o dep loy a n in tegra ted p r o g r am across a b r o a d range o f m i n i s t r i e s and techn ica l en t i t ies . 

Education. T h e cha l lenge in the sector i s t o con t inue t o absorb a r a p i d l y g r ow i n g schoo l- 
age p o p u l a t i o n w h i l e im p r o v i n g the q u a l i t y and re levance o f education. F o r basic 
education, the ob jec t ive i s to fu r the r increase en ro lmen t ra tes (cu r ren t ly a t abou t 74 
percent), espec ia l ly f o r girls and y o u n g w om e n - and t o r e f o rm curr icu la , further deve lop 
teacher tra in ing , and s treng then o v e r a l l q u a l i t y management. F o r technical education, 
the D P P R focuses o n strengthening the links with t h e p r i v a t e sector. F o r higher 
education, the a i m i s t o deve lop a system tha t can respond d y n am i c a l l y t o the needs o f 
l o c a l and r e g i o n a l markets, t h r o u g h w idespread i n s t i t u t i o n a l r e f o rm s and a d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n 
o f sources o f funding. These p r i o r i t i e s are sound, but w i l l requ i re sustained e f fo r ts ove r a 
l o n g p e r i o d o f time. 

Hea lth and population. S i g n i f i c a n t imp rovemen ts have been ach ieved over the las t 
years, in la rge p a r t thanks t o a d rama t ic expans ion o f h e a l t h fac i l i t ies , 
increased 
imm u n i z a t i o n coverage, and im p r o v e d c o n t r o l o f m a j o r diseases (malaria, TB). T h e 
D P P R a ims t o build o n this founda t ion t o accelerate progress towa rds the MDGs t h r o u g h 
a renewed focus o n the moda l i t ies o f serv ice de l ive ry . In the health sector, p r i o r i t i e s 
en ta i l im p r o v i n g managemen t and p l a n n i n g capacities, i n v o l v i n g l o c a l commun i t ies , and 
s treng then ing q u a l i t y o f services. With rega rd t o population, the D P P R ca l ls f o r a 
subs tan t ia l s treng then ing o f rep roduc t ive h e a l t h services in order t o reduce the annua l 
p o p u l a t i o n g r ow t h ra te t o 2.75 percent. Progress in this area w i l l requ i re n o t o n l y 
techn ica l measures but also soc ie ta l changes. 

0 Social safety nets. Y em e n has deve loped a m u l t i - t i e r sa fe ty net, i n c l u d i n g highly 
successful community-driven programs (no tab ly under the Soc ia l Fund f o r Deve lopmen t 
and the P u b l i c W o r k s Program), and the p r o v i s i o n o f l im i t e d cash transfers t o the poores t 
( th rough the Soc ia l W e l f a r e Fund). Ye t , the largest share by f a r o f soc ia l expend i ture i s 
consumed by a n expens ive and un targe ted subsidy system (essentially 
f o r energy 
products). T h e DPPR takes a cau t ious approach t o this po l i t ica l ly -sens i t ive issue, and 
focuses o n t h e need t o strengthen e x i s t i n g programs . S t i l l , t h e Gove rnmen t i s aware tha t 
in an inc reas ing ly cons tra ined f i s c a l env i ronmen t i t m a y n o t be poss ib le t o de lay f o r 
m u c h longe r t h e necessary r e f o rm o f the subsidy system, a n issue w h i c h i s likely t o take 
some degree o f p rom inence in the c om i n g pe r iod .

DPPR highlights the na tu ra l cons tra in ts t o Yemen ’s deve lopmen t and the need t o take f o r c e f u l

p a r t i a l m i t i g a t i o n o f the threats. Pa r t icu la r e f f o r t w i l l b e needed in several areas:

A substantive IDA program of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). AAA was

the p rog ram was sa t is fac tory and imp lemen ted with s u f f i c i e n t f l e x i b i l i t y t o respond t o 
Yemen ’s eme rg ing needs (e.g., o n an t i-corrup t ion , safety nets, c l ima te change).

investment climate improvement, mining po l icy reform, SME development, f inanc ia l 
markets (especially in the areas o f leasing, corporate governance, and SMEs), and pub l ic 
pr iva te partnerships (PPPs). 

I D A f inanc ia l assistance. During the CAS period, IDA p rov ided f inanc ing under 16 
new projects ( inc lud ing seven add i t iona l financings), fo r a to ta l comm i tmen t o f US$478 
m i l l i o n . The use o f add i t iona l f inanc ing proved an e f fec t ive way t o scale up the impact 
o f successful operations and to gradually reduce po r t fo l io fragmentation. A substantial 
par t o f the IDA program was also focused on responding t o emerging pr ior i t ies and 
addressing emergencies (avian flu, food crisis, floods). 

Implementation of 
the ongoing IDA portfolio. The current IDA po r t fo l io includes 2 1 
projects, fo r a to ta l commitment o f US$1,026 b i l l ion , o f wh ich US$684 m i l l i o n 
undisbursed. Overall, in sp i te o f a challenging environment, performance, including 
f iduc ia ry performance, remains satisfactory (with on ly two projects curren t ly rated l e s s 
than moderately satisfactory). Progress i s s ign i f ican t if considered over t h e medium- 
term: the share o f unsatisfactory projects f e l l f rom 50 percent in FY95 t o 6 percen t in 
FY09, and the disbursement ra t io rose f rom 10 percent to 23 percent. Yet, the pace o f 
implementation remains slow, re f lec t ing capacity constraints wh ich translate in to late 
effectiveness and s low procurement. 

0 Trust Funds. Yemen i s a re la t ive ly large rec ip ien t o f Bank Group-managed Trust Funds, 
with a po r t fo l io o f over $80 m i l l i o n in ne t grant amount. Trust Fund ac t iv i t ies are well 
integrated in the Bank Group program (bo th f inanc ia l and advisory). Trust Fund 
f inanc ing has proven especially instrumental: (i) to prov ide a rap id response to 
emergencies (e.g., GFRP Food Cr is is Response, GFDRR f o r f lood emergencies); (ii) to 
scale up the impac t o f successful operations (e.g., Educa t ion Fo r A l l - Fast Track 
In i t ia t ive) ; (iii) to expand the Bank Group’s ab i l i ty t o prov ide advisory services, 
inc lud ing in sens i t ive areas (e.g., EITI); and ( iv) to p i l o t ac t iv i t ies fo r an eventual 
streamlining (e.g., Output-Based A id (OBA), p i l o t programs t o improve water supply 
mechanisms, JSDF program fo r Cu l tu ra l Industries Development fo r Poor Communities). 

ZFC investments. I F C has prov ided increasing support over the C A S period, with a focus 
on the f inanc ia l sector, S M E development, education and health, manufacturing, and 
agribusiness. IFC ’s po r t fo l io has g rown t o U S $ l 5 0 m i l l ion , up f rom on ly US$16 m i l l i o n 
in FY2005, thus supporting pr iva te sector development. 

M I G A does not have any outstanding guarantee in Yemen. In coord ina t ion with IDA 
and IFC , MIGA has however prov ided advisory services on the overa l l investment 
p romo t ion arrangements in Yemen. 

34. The Bank Group’s engagement has also had significant indirect results thanks to a strong 
dialogue with the authorities as we l l as with stakeholders and partners. The Bank p layed a ma jor 
convening ro le in donor coordination, in particular through the co-cha ir ing o f the Consultative 
Group (CG) meetings and the des ign o f mu l t i-donor programs. As in other low- income countries, 
renewed donor engagement sen t a strong signal t o the pr iva te sector about po ten t ia l investment 
opportunities, and IFC helped Yemen attract sophisticated new investors, in add i t ion to i t s own 
pro jec t financing.

Lessons learned 

The lessons learned through the implementation of the CAS program point to a series 

3 5 . 
of recommendations, w h i c h have been discussed ex tens ive ly within the coun t ry team and are 
inco rpo ra ted in the p roposed strategy. 

Bank Group assistance has proven effective in supporting specific reforms. T h e q u a l i t y

I n a context of 
limited institutional capacity, implementation remains challenging 
although with significant variations across sectors. Ove ra l l , the pace o f disbursements 

i s b r o a d l y in l i n e with MNA and IDA averages, and risks ( i n c l u d i n g f i d u c i a r y risks) are 
w e l l managed - but con t inued e f f o r t s are needed t o fu r the r strengthen and accelerate 
imp lemen ta t ion . Em e r g i n g g o o d prac t ices in tha t rega rd inc lude : (i) simplifying p r o j e c t 
designs and s t ream l in ing imp lemen ta t ion arrangements; (ii) focus ing o n resu l ts based o n 
a rea l is t ic assessment o f capac i ty constraints; (iii) using decen tra l ized im p l em e n t a t i o n 
arrangements whe re appropriate; and (iv) p r om o t i n g r a p i d resu l ts approaches (such as the 
“1 00-day i n i t i a t i v e ” w h i c h has been v e r y success fu l in the h e a l t h sector). 

The Government sees Bank Group involvement in a given sector as an effective way to 
strengthen overall implementation capacity in this sector, and hence t o h e l p m o b i l i z e 

dono rs and fac i l i ta te execu t ion o f t h e i r pledges. This has t y p i c a l l y been ach ieved t h r o u g h

c omm u n i t y development, etc.), as well as capac i ty building ac t iv i t ies . 

Synergies within the Bank Group have proven effective to provide enhanced support at 

b o t h p r o g r am and p r o j e c t leve ls . C A S resu l ts have been unde rp inned in la rge p a r t by t h e

Yemen’s further uropress towards the M i l lenn ium Develoument Goals. This o v e r a l l ob jec t ive

3 8 . 
I n an uncertain global environment, the Bank Group w i l l a im to make best use of 
its 
resources to support the Government in facing the challenges associated with the global crisis. 

This e f f o r t w i l l build on lessons learned during the B a n k G r o u p response t o the f o o d c r is is (within 
the con tex t o f the GFRP) and emphasize responsiveness and f l e x i b i l i t y . T h e B a n k G r o u p in tends

16 

in wh ich case the Bank Group may have to dramatically shift i t s assistance program. The CAS 
Progress Report (wh ich cou ld be advanced o r delayed i f appropriate) w o u l d p rov ide the strategic 
framework fo r such revisions. 

B. K e v principles 

40. The proposed CAS program is derived from the Government program, as articulated in the 

DPPR and the Na t iona l Re fo rm Agenda. The actions proposed under the CAS are closely aligned 
with the pr ior i t ies identified by t h e authorities and stakeholders. 

4 1. The proposed CAS program foresees a broad-based, yet selective engagement across a 

variety of sectors. The Bank G roup i s seen by the authorities and many stakeholders as an honest 
and trusted partner - a so l id re fo rm proponent with the ab i l i ty t o translate g loba l knowledge in to 
pr ior i t ies wh ich re f lec t coun try circumstances. I t i s also perceived as a large financier to bo th the 
public and the pr iva te sector. In this context, the authorities, stakeholders, and other development 
partners have called on the Bank Group t o substantively engage in a number o f sectors in order to 
prov ide a core program around wh ich others can coalesce. In order t o avo id a dispersion and 
d i lu t ion o f efforts, however, the Bank Group w i l l apply selectivity: (i) in the choice o f thematic 
areas for engagement (at bo th sectoral and sub-sectoral levels); (ii) in the choice o f instruments 
fo r engagement (Technical Assistance, analytical work, f inanc ia l support though IDA o r IFC); 
and (iii) in the design o f ind iv idua l products (keeping them simple so as to facilitate 
implementation). 

42. The proposed CAS program was designed in close cooperation between IDA and I F C , as 

one o f the p i lo ts under the recent in i t ia t ive by the j o i n t I D A - I F C Secretariat. This i s translating 
in to an e f fo r t to op t im ize t h e in tegra t ion and complementarity o f ac t iv i t ies by bo th institutions, 
through the j o i n t des ign o f the r e s u l t s framework. In addition, several “target strategic themes” 
(i.e. f inanc ia l sector, business environment, energy, mining, and health) have been identified 
where mechanisms have been put in place to ensure a close cooperation during implementation o f 
the proposed CAS program (see Annex 7 ) . 

43. F ina l ly , the CAS i s prepared in the broader context of the Bank Group’s strategic focus on 

the Arab World. Wh i le Yemen i s one o f the few Low - Income Countries (L IC ) in the Arab 
World, and as such has to address simultaneously a broad range o f issues, mos t o f the key 
challenges it i s fac ing (and mos t o f the areas in wh ich the Bank Group intends t o prov ide support) 
re f lec t those identified in the broader Arab W o r l d In i t ia t ive , inc lud ing : (i) supporting economic 
re fo rm and integration with the g loba l economy, inc lud ing transport and infrastructure; (ii) 
he lp ing to enhance education qua l i ty to improve s k i l l s in the labor force; (iii) supporting social 
integration through wo rk in areas such as gender, health, and social safety nets; and ( iv) 
supporting reforms in the management o f water resources. 

C . Development partners 

44. Bank Group assistance w i l l be provided against the backdrop of a signijicant international 

effort. Until the early 2000s, the l e v e l o f a id to Yemen was lowe r than that prov ided to other 
IDA countries (with fewer donors and a large ly project-based assistance): f inanc ia l assistance f e l l 
f rom about US$400 m i l l i o n in 1990 t o less than U S $ l O O m i l l i o n in 1995, fo l low ing the 1991 Gulf 
War and the 1994 c i v i l war. F o l l ow i n g the launch o f the re fo rm program in 2004, however, 
Yemen has been able t o successfully rebuild i t s relationship with development partners, and a 
number o f donors have stepped up their engagement. 

17 

45. A t the 2006 meeting of the Consultative Group (CG), Yemen received about $5.3 billion in 

new pledges f r o m 39 bi- and m u l t i - l a t e r a l donors. G C C coun tr ies and GCC-based en t i t ies are 
p r o v i d i n g a lmos t two thirds o f t h e t o t a l (F igu re 7). F i n a n c i a l assistance by the B a n k G r o u p

ensure a n e f fec t ive im p l em e n t a t i o n o f the p ledges - and are r e v i ew i n g progress t h r o u g h f o rm a l

47. Yemen i s as a pilot country for 
implementation of 
the OECD Principles for Good 
International Engagement in Frag i le States. Yemen i s comm i t ted to wo rk ing with development 

partners to increase a id effectiveness through the implementation o f the Paris Dec lara t ion and has 
se t up an Aid Harmon isa t ion and Alignment Unit (AHA) within the Ministry o f P lann ing and 
In terna t iona l Cooperation (MOP IC) t o coordinate such efforts. A recent O ECD repor t suggests 
that some progress has been made towards harmonization, and yet that further e f for ts are needed 
t o meet the Paris Dec lara t ion targets fo r 2010.2 This repor t has also identified pr ior i t ies fo r 
further action (see Table 2). 

48. The Bank Group’s main contribution w i l l hence be closely linked to its continued and 
further strengthened effectiveness in being the ‘(gkle” of external support programs. In 

practical terms , during the CAS pe r iod the Bank Group w i l l further focus on: (i) he lp ing t o 
mob i l ize donors; (ii) supporting the Government in designing sound sector-wide and thematic 
strategies; (iii) bu i ld ing mu l t i -dono r 
investment programs; (iv) helping t o strengthen 
implementation capacity through i t s ow n projects fo r a broader use by other donors; (v) assisting 
in imp rov ing core Government systems; (vi) demonstrating new implementation approaches that, 
i f successful, can be mainstreamed by the Government and other development partners; and (v i i ) 
he lp ing to further advance the a id harmon iza t ion agenda in l i n e with the Paris Declaration.

55. Support selected drivers of non-oil growth (Thematic Area 1.4). The Government has 

identified a number o f p r io r i ty sectors t o spur diversification, 
in a deteriorated g loba l 
environment. The Bank Group w i l l engage selectively with a v iew t o max im iz ing the impac t o f

Strategic Objective 2: He lp enhance governance 

5 6 . The issue of governance cuts across the entire CAS, from the efficiency of service delivery 
to the rules that govern economic activities. The Bank Group program w i l l integrate governance 

across sectors, 
in l i n e with t h e recommendations o f the recent Coun try Governance and 
An t i -Co r rup t ion Assessmen t (CGAC) and building on the ongoing experience in the water sector. 
The Bank Group has also been asked t o help tackle specific overa l l governance issues, but given 
the capacity, po l i t ica l , and social constraints, se lec t iv i ty i s key. E f fo r ts w i l l hence focus o n th ree 
areas where the Bank Group has been encouraged to take the lead by the Government and a group 
o f donors invo lved in supporting governance reforms. 

57 . Further strengthen transparency (Thematic Area 2.1). In coord ina t ion with other donors 
( inc lud ing USAID and GTZ), the Bank G roup i s curren t ly p rov id ing Technical Assistance t o the 
authorities, including to SNACC . During the CAS period, the Bank Group w i l l build on this 
partnership and p rov ide Technical Assistance t o help: (i) further develop SNACC and COC A 
capacity; (ii) f ina l ize and implement the Na t iona l Strategy and Ac t ion P lan t o Combat

Assistance to help respond to na tura l disasters and prepare a na t iona l strategy t o increase 
resilience t o the impac t o f climate change. The Bank Group w i l l further pursue this effort, with a 
focus on: (i) strengthening the capacity o f relevant Government agencies t o establish an advanced 
alert system where possible and t o manage na tura l disasters and their aftermath; (ii) p rov id ing 
exceptional assistance, i f and as may be possible, t o support recovery efforts; and (iii) support the 
implementation o f p r io r i ty e lemen ts o f the c l ima te change strategy (and help enhance cross- 
sectoral approaches). 

Proposed instruments: (i) imp lemen ta t ion support fo r the ongoing IDA F lood Pro tec t ion

67. Overall, the Bank Group intends to use the fu l l spectrum of available instruments: 

financial, analytical, and advisory support, f r om IDA, IFC, and poss ib ly MIGA. Annexes 1 and 2 
present a summary l i s t o f instruments (by category) wh ich are expected to support CAS 
implementation. 

68. Manag ing the existingportfolios. Supervision o f ongoing ac t iv i t ies w i l l rema in the f i r s t and 
foremost p r io r i ty fo r bo th IDA and IFC . W i t h about US$685 m i l l i o n undisbursed fo r IDA, and 
about U S $ l 5 0 m i l l i o n in commitments fo r IFC, the ongo ing program i s s ign i f ican t and i t s 
effective implementation i s c r i t ica l t o getting r e s u l t s in the C A S pe r iod (projects already 
underway are the ones that a re most likely to translate in to actual resu l ts on the ground in the 
com ing years). This w i l l require hands-on imp lemen ta t ion support at bo th design and 
implementation stages. I t w i l l also require continued attention to f iduc ia ry i s s u e s (e.g., tightened 
mechanisms fo r implementation, re la t ive ly l o w threshold fo r procurement p r io r reviews, and 
stringent f inanc ia l management arrangements). 

69 . Providing continuedfinancial support. Such f inanc ia l support i s expected to be prov ided 
through a comb ina t ion o f IDA resources, Trust Funds, I F C instruments, and possibly MIGA 
guarantees. 

IDA resources. IDA resources are expected to be prov ided throughout the IDA 15 cyc le 
(FY09 -FY 11). The amount wou ld be adjusted annually on the basis o f several factors, 
inc lud ing imp lemen ta t ion performance and Coun try Po l ic ies and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment 
(CP IA) and the t e rm s o f t h e assistance (grants, credits or a mix o f the two) wou ld be 
determined annually based on the country's debt ~ u s t a i n a b i l i t y . ~ The ove ra l l size o f the 
IDA envelope during the CAS pe r iod i s assumed t o be about SDR 300 m i l l ion , i .e . an 
average annual a l loca t ion o f about SDR 75 m i l l i o n (about $120 m i l l i o n at current 
exchange rates). IDA i s intending to make use o f a var ie ty o f instruments subject t o the 
fo l low ing considerations: (i) focus resources on a re la t ive ly sma l l number o f large 
operations wh ich can have a s ign i f ican t development impac t on the ground (and w i l l no t 
require a disproportionate share o f IDA's administrative budget fo r supervision); (ii) 
m in im ize imp l ic i t commitments fo r the post-CAS pe r iod (when the IDA a l loca t ion i s 
unknown), such as those resulting f r om the use o f Adaptative Program Loans (APLs); 
(iii) scale up success through add i t iona l f inanc ing fo r we l l -pe r fo rm ing operations; ( iv) 
explore innova t ive instruments such as IBRD enclave o r guarantee as may be appropriate 
(e.g. in the mining sector); and (vi) make full use o f the flexibility a l lowed under the new 
Coun try F inanc ing Parameters (approved in October 2005). IDA i s also p lann ing t o 
prov ide f inanc ia l assistance in support o f the subsidies re fo rm through a Development 
Po l icy Grant (DPG) - based on the satisfactory experience ( inc lud ing on the f iduc iary 
front) under the current Ins t i tu t iona l Re fo rm Development Po l icy Grant. F ina l ly , IDA 
w i l l use f lex ib i l i ty in the selection, focus, and design o f f inanc ia l instruments to a l low fo r 

The CAS covers the period FY10-FY13, which includes the remaining two years o f the IDA15 period 
(FY10- l l) , and the f i r s t two years o f IDA16. Estimates o f ID A resources available for FY10-13 are 
indicative only and are subject to change. Actual annual allocations w i l l be determined annually on t h e 
basis o f several factors including: (i) total ID A resources available (in particular, FY12 and FY13 
indicative a l loca t ions assume that the total amount o f resources available under I D A 16 w i l l be similar t o 
IDA15); (ii) Yemen's CPIA performance relative t o the performance o f other I D A countries; and (iii) the 
t e rm s o f IDA's assistance to Yemen (gran ts or credits) and to other ID A countries. I D A allocations are 
made in SDRs and the U S $ equivalent amounts are dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate.

Annex 4 - Debt S u s t a i n a b i l i t v A n a l v s i s 

Annex 4: Debt Sustainability Analysis 

1. Debt ratios are presently relatively low by international standards, and hence Y em e n 
does n o t mee t the highly indeb ted p o o r coun tr ies (HIPC) c r i t e r i a f o r debt r e l i e f . E x t e r n a l debt has 
dec l ined s tead i ly t o an es t ima ted 2 2 percen t o f GDP in 2008, but domes t ic deb t ( a l l shor t- term 
and expensive) i s o n the r ise - es t ima ted a t n e a r l y 16 percen t o f G D P in 2008 . N e t p u b l i c debt 
(domes t ic and ex terna l) i s a lso o n the r ise a f te r three years o f con t inuous decline, reach ing 35.2 
percen t o f GDP in 2007. This i s a p o t e n t i a l l y la rge r a t i o p r im a r i l y due t o t h e Governmen t ’s l o w 
capac i ty t o m o b i l i z e revenues (non -hyd roca rbon revenue was o n l y 10 percen t o f GDP in 2007, o f 
w h i c h t a x revenue was o n l y 7 percent). 

2. Yemen i s at a high risk of external debt distress in view o f the medium-term fiscal 
outlook, charac ter ized by dwindling o i l p r o d u c t i o n and v o l a t i l i t y in o i l pr ices . T h e January 2 0 0 9 
D e b t Sus ta inab i l i ty A n a l y s i s (DSA ) done j o i n t l y by IDA and IMF highlights tha t even in t h e 
con tex t o f comprehens ive f i s c a l and s t ruc tu ra l r e f o rm s (Le., an ad jus tmen t scenario), the present 
va lue (PV) o f deb t- to-expor ts r a t i o i s p ro jec ted t o r ise above the 100 percen t th resho ld by 2018, 
w h i l e the PV o f deb t- to-GDP r a t i o i s p ro jec ted t o approach the 3 0 percen t th resho ld by 2028 . 
A l t h o u g h o ther ind ica to rs (no tab ly deb t serv ice t o revenue ra t io ) r em a i n b e l ow t h e i r respec t ive 
thresholds, D S A p ro jec t ions ind ica te tha t t h e o u t l o o k w i l l wo rsen as deb t accumulates and 
resources ava i lab le t o service it dec l ine as a resu l t o f the drying up o f o i l expor ts a round 202 1. 

3. External debt sustainability could be further weakened by adverse shocks, espec ia l ly a 
dep rec ia t ion in the exchange rate, l ow e r expo r t g row th , and l e s s favo rab le f i n a n c i n g terms. F o r 
instance, standard D S A stress t e s t s ind ica te tha t a one- t ime 3 0 percen t deva lua t ion o f the r i a l in 
2009 w o u l d bring the PV o f debt above 40 pe rcen t o f G D P and a lmos t 2 0 0 percen t o f f i s c a l 
revenue by 2028 . S im i la r ly , i f expo r t g r ow t h rema ins one standard d e v i a t i o n b e l ow i t s h i s t o r i c a l 
average in 2009 and 2010, the P V o f deb t w o u l d peak a t 245 percen t o f expor ts by 2025 and 
exceed 130 percen t o f f i s c a l revenue by 2028; ex te rna l deb t service w o u l d r ise above 10 percen t 
o f exports. The P V o f debt w o u l d peak above 2 4 0 percen t o f expor ts in 2025, if in teres t rates o n 
n e w ex te rna l b o r r ow i n g we re 2 percen t h i g h e r t h a n in the ad jus tmen t scenario. 

4. Yemen’s external debt would become rapidly unsustainable in the context o f a non- 
adjustment scenario. A l l thresho lds w o u l d b e breached qu i te rap id ly , even w h e n assum ing 
ex terna l f i n a n c i n g ava i lab le o n compa ra t ive ly favo rab le ( though n o t fully concessional) terms . 
Mo reove r , a l l thresho lds w i l l be exceeded by a cons iderab le m a r g i n over the med ium - te rm . 
U n d e r such a non-ad jus tmen t scenario, Y em e n w i l l have l i t t l e r o om f o r abso rb ing the shocks 
associated with a dep le t ion o f o i l p r o d u c t i o n by 2 0 2 1. 

4. The DSA assumes that the Government responds to falling o i l production and lower o i l 
prices through a concerted and sustained commitment t o : (i) f i s c a l ad jus tmen t (by enhanc ing 
revenue m o b i l i z a t i o n and con ta in ing recu r ren t expenditure); (ii) increased exchange ra te 
f l e x i b i l i t y ; (iii) con t inua t ion o f curren t e f f o r t s t o c o n t a i n in f la t ion ; and (iv) s truc tura l r e f o rm s t o 
im p r o v e t h e business env i ronmen t and encourage inves tmen t . 

5 . A l l o f Yemen’s external debt i s owed to official creditors, mostly on concessional terms. 
E x t e r n a l deb t was US$5 .8 b i l l i o n (26.9 percen t o f GDP) at end-2007, o f w h i c h ove r h a l f was 
ow e d t o m u l t i l a t e r a l cred i tors ( i n c l u d i n g US$2 .1 b i l l i o n t o the W o r l d Bank, US$0 .6 b i l l i o n t o the 
A r a b Fund f o r Soc ia l and E c o n om i c Deve lopmen t , and U S $ 1 7 0 m i l l i o n t o the IMF). T h e o ther

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. 
This CAS Completion Report evaluates the effectiveness o f the FY2006-2009 Country 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) f o r the Republic o f Yemen. The CAS, wh ich covered on ly the ac t iv i t ies o f 
the In terna t iona l Development Association (IDA), was dated M a y 17, 2006, and discussed by the W o r l d 
Bank Execu t ive Boa rd in June 2006. This CASCR constitutes a self-evaluation by t h e Bank’s country 
team o f the alignment o f the C A S with Yemen’s longer-term strategic goals, the extent to wh ich expected 
outcomes were achieved, and the Bank’s performance in con tr ibu t ing t o those achievements. The lessons 
learned f rom this experience have been taken in to account in the design o f the CAS fo r FY2010-20 13. 

2. 

This assessment i s based on discussions within the country team and with government 
counterparts, as well as a variety o f reference  document^.^ The country team has also benefited f rom a 

se r ies o f external evaluations o f the country program, inc lud ing the Independent Eva lua t ion Group’s 
(IEG) Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion o f August 2006 (Report N o . 36527), an Independent Procurement 
Review (IPR), and Project Assessments by the Qua l i ty Assurance Group (QAG). 

11. YEMEN’S LONGER TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

The 2006 CAS focused on supporting the main objectives o f the Government’s medium- 

3 . 
term strategy, embodied in the Third Socio-Economic Development P lan fo r Poverty Reduc t ion (DPPR 
2006-10)6 and subsequent Na t iona l Re fo rm Agenda fo r 2008-2010. Yemen’s DPPR, which also s e r v e s as 
i t s Second Pover ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) fo r ’ the same period, has defined the country’s 
development d i lemma as “a m i x o f chronic structural challenges per ta in ing to popu la t ion g row th and 
dispersal throughout the country, rampant i l l i te racy and unemployment, ma jor technological and 
knowledge deficits, and water resource ~ c a r c i t i e s . ” ~ The DPPR has also acknowledged the deficiencies o f 
the governance system and the urgent need fo r economic d ivers i f ica t ion prompted by the rap id depletion 
o f the country’s o i l rese rves . 

Reference documents include the CAS for FY2006-2009, Project Appraisal Documents, Implementation S ta tus 
and Results Reports, supervision reports (Aide-Memoires and Back-to-Office Reports), recen t Economic and Sector 
Work, Implementation Completion Reports, and the 2008 Country Performance Portfolio Review.

4. 
The priorities set out in the DPPR focus on tw o inter-related themes: (i) achieving 
accelerated economic growth and employment generation; and (ii) intensifying poverty reduction 

efforts. These themes represent a high degree o f c o n t i n u i t y f r om the ob jec t ives o f the p rev ious PRSP. 
Within these b road themes, the DPPR i s built o n e igh t p i l l a r s tha t p r o v i d e a p r i o r i t i z e d f r am ew o r k f o r 
ac t ion : (i) macroeconom ic p o l i c i e s and targets; (ii) good governance; (iii) deve lopmen t o f p roduc t ive and 
p r om i s i n g sectors; (iv) water, env ironmen t , and bas ic in fras truc ture ; (v) h um a n deve lopmen t ; (vi) 
Gove rnmen t services; (vii) soc ia l sa fe ty net, soc ia l pro tec t ion , and soc ia l security; and (v i i i ) women ’s 
empowermen t . 

I n 2006, the Government developed a National Reform Agenda (NRA) to overcome 

5. 
obstacles to DPPR implementation. T h e NRA addressed the m a j o r r e f o rm areas o f an t icorrup t ion , r u l e 
o f law , inves tmen t climate, and p o l i t i c a l pa r t ic ipa t ion . H a v i n g made g o o d progress o n NRA r e f o rm s ea r ly

NRA f o r 2008-2010 set o u t f i v e spec i f ic ob jec t ives : (i) j u d i c i a l re fo rm ; (ii) adm in is t ra t ive r e f o rm and 
c i v i l service modern iza t ion ; (iii) inves tmen t and business c l ima te ; (iv) an t ico r rup t ion , transparency, and 
accoun tab i l i ty ; and (v) p o l i t i c a l re fo rms . I n d i v i d u a l r e f o rm ac t iv i t ies and re levan t d o n o r suppor t w i l l b e

111. YEMEN’S PROGRESS TOWARDS ACH IEV ING I T S DEVELOPMENT GOALS’ 

The country’s long-term strategic goals, to which the CAS was aligned, remain relevant. At 

7. 
this stage, however , Yemen ’s c r i t i c a l deve lopmen t goa ls o f sus ta in ing h i g h e r econom ic g r ow t h rates

Consistent w i th the key focal areas o f the DPPR, the C A S fo r FY2006-2009 encompassed 
four pillars: (i) diversifying growth t h r o u g h be t te r governance and be t ter d e l i v e r y o f p u b l i c services; (ii) 
improving human development t h r o u g h m o r e e f f i c i e n t serv ice d e l i v e r y and im p r o v e d sa fe ty nets; (iii)

development partners, providing Technical Assistance (TA) to the Government, and working with other 
donors to mainstream new implementation approaches that can enhance performance in the sectors. 

A. Assessment Methodology 

14. 
The CAS Results Ma t r ix contained 26 CAS outcomes, defined as country results deemed 
achievable during the CAS period and which the Bank expected to influence through its 

interventions. The matrix also included about twice that number o f milestones, or progress markers o f 
CAS implementation. A few o f the CAS outcome indicators were imprecise or missing baseline and 
target values, which has made it difficult to evaluate progress in some areas as compared to their status at 
the start o f the CAS period. Overall, however, the Results Matrix has proved to be a so l id framework with 
which to assess the Bank’s contribution to Yemen’s development over the CAS period. 

15. 
This evaluation uses the Results Chain (Appendix 1) contained in the CAS to discuss 
progress on each key outcome identified within the four strategic pillars. The CASCR then reviews 

the overall achievements made under each pillar and the relevance o f the lending and non-lending 
instruments to that pillar, discussing whether, how, and why the assistance program did or did no t achieve 
each o f the CAS outcomes. Finally, the document draws lessons from the experience o f CAS 
implementation and provides recommendations for the next CAS. 

B. 

Assessment Summary 

16. 

Overall, performance under the CAS fo r FY2006-2009 i s rated Moderately Satisfactory. The 

challenges facing the Government o f Yemen grew considerably over the CAS period, a time when the 
World Bank resources available to the c o u n t y remained limited. In this context, the CAS embodied an 
appropriately focused strategy t o lay the foundation fo r sustainable economic growth and help Yemen 
meet its long-term goals, while supporting the Government in showing immediate, tangible results 
through the Soc ia l Fund for Development and activities under the Public Works Project. The CAS thus 
reached its objective o f better balancing the country’s need fo r short-term growth with the longer-term 
needs o f capacity development and public sector accountability, as recommended in t h e CASCR for the 
previous CAS period. The CAS succeeded in reaching many o f i t s planned outcomes in a positive context 
o f strong public commitment to reform, and t h e impact o f the strategy i s generally expected to be 
sustainable in the medium term. Table 2 summarizes the ratings fo r each strategic pillar and individual 
CAS outcome. (A detailed CAS Completion Matrix i s attached in Appendix 2.)

CAS f o r FY2006-2009 and assesses the Bank’s contribution to the country’s achievements under 

each o f the four strategic pillars. T h e c o u n t r y team has assigned ra t ings t o the B a n k ’ s pe r fo rmance on 
each p i l la r , as w e l l as each associated C A S ou tcome . D e t a i l e d achievements aga ins t C A S ou tcomes and

O v e r a l l p e r fo rm an c e on P i l l a r I outcomes i s r a t e d moderate& satisfactory. Significant 
progress was made against the indicators laid out in the CAS, particularly w i th regard to targets on 
improving the business regulatory environment. Progress on s k i l l s development outcomes has been 
slower, however, due to delays in project effectiveness. (Detailed achievements are presented in 
Appendix 2.) In general, the Pillar I CAS outcomes were relevant and adequately ambitious to support the 
Government’s goal o f diversifying Yemen’s economy. 

2 1. 

Business r egu l a to r y env i ronmen t . Satisfactory. Substantive reform measures planned in the 
Government’s National Reform Agenda and Ma t r ix o f Good Governance were achieved. 

The Government (at national and sub-national levels) established simplified business start-up 
procedures to minimize bureaucratic obstacles for private investors. As a resu l t , Yemen was l i s t e d 
as the Top Reformer on starting a business in D o i n g Business 2009. Progress in this area was 
supported through Bank and IFC policy dialogue and T A on improving the investment climate 
along w i th quick-disbursing budget support, backed up by Bank and IFC analytical work on the 
business enabling environment. The next step in consolidating these reforms w i l l be to translate 
successes in creating and amending laws and regulations into concrete implementation to support 
private sector growth. 

0 On tax po l icy and adm in is tra t ion , the Government developed a new corporate income tax law 
and replaced hidden turnover taxes w i th a 5 percent sales tax. The total tax burden on companies 
i s lower, but there i s room for improvement in actual tax collections. The Bank supported these 
reforms through dialogue, techn ica l help, and development policy lending triggers to draft the 
new income tax law, in conjunction w i th ongoing T A from FIAS and IFC to provide an 
assessment o f tax incentives and support for legal and administrative reform.

Regulatory frameworks and public investments in selected sectors. Moderately Satisfactory. 

24. 
Po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l frameworks improved over the CAS pe r iod in irr iga ted agriculture, l ives tock and 
ra in fed agriculture, f i s h e r i e s management, pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion in the gas sector, and ports. 

Annex 6 - CAS Comuletion Reuort 

In support o f irrigated agriculture, the Government has been imp lemen t ing a se r ies o f water 
sector projects t o improve par t ic ipa tory i r r iga t ion management through Water U s e r Associations 
and Water U s e r Groups. These ac t iv i t ies have also focused on rehab i l i ta t ing i r r iga t ion 
infrastructure and increasing agr icu l tura l p roduc t iv i ty (more crop per drop). P i l o t wo rk i s 
underway to tes t the concept o f integrated water management. The creation o f a Na t iona l 
I r r iga t ion Program at the Ministry o f Ag r icu l tu re and I r r iga t ion has centralized the government’s 
management o f i r r iga t ion ac t iv i t ies and thus improved upon the prev ious approach, in wh ich 
these activities were dispersed across fragmented Project Management Units. The Bank’s lending 
assistance has focused on strengthening spate i r r iga t ion through infrastructure rehabilitation, 
par t ic ipa tory approaches, extension services, and capacity bu i ld ing . 

O n rainfed agriculture and livestock development, the General Seed Mu l t ip l ica t ion Corpora t ion 
and contracted farmers produced 75 tons o f ra in fed cereal seeds that were sold back t o 1,646 
farmers operating in ra in fed areas (cover ing an area o f 4,721 hectares). This outcome has 
benefited f rom fruitful co l labora t ion among various agr icu l tura l research organizations. 
Veterinary tra in ing programs are underway, and 92 commun i ty groups are being formed in 11 
districts to develop loca l income-generating ac t iv i t ies that w i l l benefit group members and loca l 
communities. N e w government funding allocations have supported l ives tock hea l th and 
produc t ion as well as the creation o f fo rma l and in fo rma l cooperatives among farmers and 
beneficiaries to strengthen their capacity t o identify problems, p r io r i t ize needs, and seek f inanc ing 
to help them prepare and imp lemen t income-generating projects. Bank lend ing assistance has 
focused on enabling poor ru ra l producers in ra in fed areas to improve produc t ion (through better 
use o f land and seeds), processing, and marke t ing systems; protect their assets through improved 
l ives tock husbandry and hea l th services; and become be t te r organized through improved access to 
pub l ic and pr iva te services, markets, and in forma t ion . 

Onfisheries, a contract has been signed fo r Ministry o f Fish Wea l th res truc tur ing and creation o f : 
(i) Fishermen’s Au thor i t ies in coastal governorates; (ii) a Fish Research Au thor i ty ; and (iii) a Fish 
Por t Au tho r i ty . The a im i s to re formu la te the ministry as a po l icy -mak ing and mon i to r ing body 
wh i le transferring f i s h e r i e s management to the loca l authorities and F ishe r ies Cooperatives in 
coastal governorates. Bank lending assistance has concentrated o n strengthening sustainable 
f i s h e r i e s resource management, targe t ing improvements in ministry capacity, fac i l i t ies and 
handling, and cooperatives management; implementation has been delayed, however, due to 
changes in ins t i tu t iona l support. 

In the hydrocarbons sector, a constructive debate i s underway on gas p r ic ing fo r domestic use 
and on the in troduc t ion o f gas clauses in produc t ion sharing contracts t o boost na tura l gas 
exploration and production. The lega l and regulatory framework fo r pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion i s 
gradually improv ing . Bank TA has focused on natural gas development, in cooperation with IFC . 
A rev iew o f macroeconomic incentives fo r gas sector investment was completed and TA was 
launched to help structure investments in na tura l gas u t i l iza t ion projects. 

Progress on urban manufacturing has been supported by the development o f updated phys ica l 
and investment p lann ing in ma jo r po r t cities (Aden, Al-Hodeidah, and A l -Muka l lah ) . Bank 
engagement has been limited, occurr ing ma in ly through strategy preparation ac t iv i t ies on national 
ports and c i ty development.

Access, equity and quality o f education. Moderately Satisfactory. O v e r a l l achievements in the

Strategy in 2007. The Bank’s contributions in the education sector have inc luded support fo r 
implementation o f a sector-wide approach in education, assistance in fundraising under the Educa t ion fo r 
A l l Fast Track In i t ia t ive , TA on secondary education strategy development, and lend ing assistance fo r 
basic education development and expanding girls’ access to secondary school. In addition, Bank 
in i t ia t ives on pub l ic works and social fund development he lped support the construction o f schools. 
Desp i te this impor tan t progress, however, the CAS targets were no t fully met. It has become clear, in 
hindsight, that the general outcome indicators l a i d out in the C A S were ove r ly ambitious. A lack o f 
credible popu la t ion data and the use o f several inconsistent data co l lec t ion methodologies resulted in 
in f la ted educational data f rom 1999-2004, wh ich in turn led t o in f la ted baselines and targets in the CAS . 
The Ministry o f Education i s in the process o f rec ru i t ing Techn ica l Assistance t o strengthen education 
data collection, reporting, and ver i f ica t ion . Qua l i ty con t ro l mechanisms are being put in place fo r bo th 
retrospective and future data. 

28. 
Access and quality o f health. Moderately Satisfactory. Performance has improved s ign i f ican t ly 
over the previous CAS per iod fo l low ing a shift in Government pr ior i t ies toward broader systemic 
reforms. Access to health services has improved, but u t i l iza t ion o f these services has yet t o be assessed. 
The Bank’s lending assistance has focused o n increasing access t o maternal and ch i ld hea l th care, 
strengthening the effectiveness o f public health programs in ma lar ia and hea l th education, and supporting 
human resource development in the sector. The Bank has p rov ided substantial TA o n setting results-based 
po l icy options and strategies, analyzing hea l th f inanc ing trends, and fac i l i ta t ing donor coord ina t ion and 
a id harmon iza t ion in the sector. F ina l ly , Bank in i t ia t ives on pub l ic works and social fund development 
helped support the construction o f health fac i l i t ies . 

29. 
Safety net programs. Moderately Satisfactory. This area o f support became increasingly urgent 
in the context o f the food cr is is o f 2008. The Government i s wo rk ing to put in place a targeted social 
safety net to m i t iga te i t s effects on pover ty and l ive l ihoods . Pro-poor targeting has improved under the 
Social Fund fo r Development, with 69 pe rcen t o f resources go ing t o people in the lowest three income 
deciles. The Bank prov ided grant fund ing and lending assistance to support j o b creation and income 
generation and delivered emergency assistance in response to the food c r i s i s . Add i t iona l f inanc ing was 
approved to scale up support t o the Social Fund fo r Development. The Bank also prov ided TA on the 
development o f a social pro tec t ion strategy and just-in-time advice on establishing a cash transfer 
mechanism to m i t iga te the impac t o f pr ice shocks and a l low fo r an eventual reduc t ion o f energy subsidies. 
These ac t iv i t ies were supported by a wide range o f ana ly t ica l wo rk on pover ty analysis, social 
development, and disabilities. 

30. Water supply and sanitation. Moderately Satisfactory. L o c a l water and wastewater corporations 
have been established in 14 cities (well above the 4 targeted in the CAS). Coverage o f urban water supply 
services has thus increased, albeit more s low ly than o r ig ina l ly planned due t o capacity constraints. A new 
Ru ra l Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy was prepared and, though no t yet approved, i s in use- 
leading t o improved e f f ic iency o f ru ra l water supply management on the par t o f Water U s e r Associations. 
Access t o water remains constrained in bo th ru ra l and urban areas, however, ow ing to rap id popu la t ion 
g row th combined with the rap id lowe r ing o f the groundwater leve l in a few key aquifers. (See Section D 
be low fo r a discussion o f water resource management progress under P i l la r IV). Bank assistance took the 
fo rm o f lending ac t iv i t ies in urban and ru ra l water supply and sanitation. Go ing forward, these e f for ts w i l l 
be integrated in to the newly created Water Sector Support Project. 

3 1. 
Children and youth. Moderately Satisfactory. A Ch i ld ren and You th Strategy was approved in 
FY2006, and an associated ac t ion p lan was adopted in FY2009 . The next s tep i s to incorporate the 
strategy recommendations across l i n e ministries. The Bank p rov ided s ign i f ican t TA to the development o f 
the strategy and ac t ion plan.

32. 
Gender. Moderately Satisfactoly. Girls’ enrollment in basic education i s improving, with the 
share o f girls in basic education rising from 40.5 percent in the 2004/2005 school year t o 41.8 percent in 
August 2008; however, ambitious CAS targets in this area have no t yet been achieved. Women are 
gaining access to improved income generating activities in the rainfed agriculture sector. The Bank has 
mainstreamed gender considerations throughout i t s program o f lending and analytical work, paying 
particular attention to gender equality issues i n access to basic education and hea l th services.

Pillar III: Improving Fiscal Sustainability through Improved Public Expenditure 
Management 
33 . 
The third pillar included CAS Outcomes in five areas: (i) revenue transparency; (ii) 
expenditure management; (iii) public sector reform; (iv) public procurement; and (v) public financial 
management. The CAS envisioned that Bank support fo r these activities would consist o f six ongoing 
projects, tw o new loans ( o f which one was delivered, along with three additional financing operations), 
and six non-lending activities (twelve were delivered, but the planned Public Expenditure Review was 
postponed to FY2010). Implementation o f these activities was enhanced through several bilateral and 
multi-donor trust funds. Table 7 shows the various elements o f the CAS program that have supported 
Pillar I11 activities.

Overall performance on Pillar I11 outcomes i s rated sutisfuctory. Working with a reform- 
minded government, the Bank was successful in achieving i t s objectives o f improving revenue 
transparency, procurement management, and public 
f inanc ia l management. 
Institutional and 
administrative reforms established as principal objectives o f the DPPR were also tackled. Fuel subsidies 
were not reduced, however, against the backdrop o f external factors such as t h e hike in o i l prices and civil 
unrest in response to rising costs. (Detailed achievements are presented in Appendix 2.) Despite these 
important successes, achieving f i s c a l sustainability remains a major challenge fo r Yemen, requiring 
concerted efforts to fos ter sustained economic growth and diversification. The Pillar I11 CAS outcomes 

5 8 

Annex 6 - CAS C om p l e t i o n Report 

were highly relevant t o the country’s long- term development goals o f intensifying economic g row th and 
pover ty reduction. 

3 5 . 

Revenue transparency. Satisfactory. Yemen fo rma l ly j o i n e d E IT I and set up a Na t iona l E IT I 
Counc i l to support E IT I implementation. The counc i l comprises representatives f r om Government, o i l 
and gas companies, and c i v i l society organizations and has taken i n i t i a l steps t o begin imp lemen t ing E IT I 
requirements. Bank Group support has inc luded po l icy dialogue, TA, and ana ly t ica l wo rk on E IT I 
accession and implementation. These e f for ts have been backed up other donors, pa r t icu la r ly the United 
States Agency fo r In terna t iona l Development. In addition, Yemen has been selected as a p i l o t country fo r 
the Bank’s Coun try Governance and An t ico r rup t ion (CGAC) in i t ia t ive , wh ich seeks t o identify innova t ive 
approaches t o engage with clients and partners in strengthening a country’s par t icu lar governance 
challenges. An in i t ia l CG AC assessment was conducted to underpin preparation o f a CG AC strategy in 
FY2009 . The Bank i s also p rov id ing TA to the an t icorrup t ion agency, SNACC , and has completed a 
baseline survey on the incidence o f corrup t ion crimes, as well as a D iagnos t ic Survey o f An t ico r rup t ion 
Lega l and Regulatory Framework, towa rd assisting SNACC in t h e development o f a comprehensive 
na t iona l strategy fo r combating corruption. 

36 . 

Expenditure management. Moderately Satisfactory. Good progress has been made in imp rov ing 
budget comprehensiveness and transparency, in l i n e with the Pub l ic Finance Management Strategy. The 
Government has se t up a road map fo r establishing a Medium-Term Expend i ture Framework (MTEF) 
consistent with t h e DPPR and taken steps toward implementation. The Cap i ta l Budge t has been linked 
successfully t o the Pub l ic Investment Program (PIP), though development o f a three-year MTEF fo r 
budget formu la t ion i s s t i l l at an early stage. In the context o f i t s broader po l icy dialogue on governance 
and ins t i tu t iona l reform, the Bank has prov ided TA to support development o f an MTEF with budget 
ceilings that are consistent with MDG requirements. This wo rk has been buttressed by ana ly t ica l wo rk on 
pub l ic expenditure management and t rack ing and a mu l t i-donor assessment o f pub l ic expenditure and 
f inanc ia l accountability indicators. Though f u e l subsidies became increasingly unsustainable due to rising 
f u e l prices at t h e s t a r t o f the CAS, subsidy re forms have no t taken place given the high degree o f po l i t ica l 
resistance to this re fo rm and the recent drop in f u e l p r ices . The Government i s evaluating options fo r 
future reductions in subsidy leve ls . The Bank i s p rov id ing comprehensive TA in this area, backed up by 
macroeconomic mon i to r ing and an analysis o f t h e po ten t ia l impac t o f f u e l subsidy reductions on pover ty 
and social development. This w o r k has also benefited f rom the Bank’s e f for ts t o support the Government 
in defining a na t iona l social pro tec t ion strategy (see P i l la r I1 above). 

3 7 . 

Public sector reform. Moderately Satisfactory. Substantial r e s u l t s were achieved on central 
government reform, including the implementation o f an early retirement plan, de f in i t ion o f a na t iona l 
wage strategy, and ro l lou t o f a human resources database that includes b iome t r ic ve r i f ica t ion o f c i v i l 
servants and computerized links t o the pay ro l l system. Capacity has improved, and the Ministry o f C i v i l 
Service and Insurance (MoCS I) has embarked on a re-engineering process. The M o C S I has h i red a l l o f i t s 
h igh- leve l s ta f f us ing compe t i t ive and merit-based selection. Progress has been slower on other aspects o f 
restructuring and re-engineering and with respect to other pilots, though diagnostic wo rk has been 
completed. Bank support has taken the f o rm o f lending assistance on c i v i l service modernization and 
po l icy dialogue on ins t i tu t iona l re form . Local administration p lann ing capacity has improved fo l low ing 
the comp le t ion o f fou r c i ty master plans, construction o f loca l counc i l buildings, and preparation o f 
several c i ty development strategies. The Bank has supported these efforts through lending assistance fo r 
mun ic ipa l development and decentralization initiatives, d raw ing on ana ly t ica l w o r k on urban pover ty in 
Yemen’s second-largest c i ty o f Taiz. 

38 . 

Public procurement. Satisfactory. T h e Government enacted a new Procurement L a w that i s 
consistent with international bes t practice. The High Tender Boa rd was restructured, and a Na t iona l 
Procurement Manua l and associated standard bidding documents have been prepared and are be ing ro l led 

59 

Annex 6 - CAS Completion Report 

out t o p i l o t ministries. In the context o f the Bank’s po l icy dialogue o n ins t i tu t iona l reform, s ign i f ican t TA 
was prov ided to dra f t the Procurement L a w and fac i l i ta te i t s adoption. The Bank i s now supporting the 
Government in developing the executive by- laws fo r the Procurement L aw . 

3 9 . 

Public financial management. Satisfactory. The Government o f Yemen has adopted a 
comprehensive pub l ic f inanc ia l management (PFM) re fo rm strategy, approved by the Cabinet in 2005 , 
that includes general budget reform, enhancement o f con tro l and f inanc ia l accountability, re fo rm o f the 
system o f bidding and procurement, and improvement o f competence and s k i l l s . Bank TA has assisted the 
Government in conducting an assessment o f pub l ic expenditure and f inanc ia l accountability, in order t o 
identify strengths and weaknesses o f P F M systems and make adjustments to the Government’s P F M 
Re fo rm Ac t ion Plan. TA i s also helping the Government t o prepare Phase 2 o f the P F M Ac t ion Plan; 
fac i l i ta t ing an improved alignment be tween Yemen’s development agenda, i t s PIP, and i t s recurrent 
budget; and supporting the P F M A c t i o n P lan to wh ich several ma jo r donors have agreed. Amendments to 
the Ex terna l Audit L a w are being proposed to ensure the independence o f the Cen tra l Organization fo r 
Con t ro l and Audit (COCA) f r om the executive. COCA has been selected as a p i lo t ins t i tu t ion fo r 
restructuring under the c i v i l service modernization program. An Accoun t ing and F inanc ia l Management 
In fo rma t ion System (AFMIS) was deployed in four central m in is tr ies and i s be ing expanded t o the 
rema in ing Ministry headquarters in Sana’a. Throughout 2008 , AFMIS was used in para l le l to the manua l 
system in executing the budgets o f the largest fou r M i n i s t r i e s (Education, Health, Finance, and Pub l ic 
Works). AFMIS has also been used to prepare the 2008 f ina l accounts fo r these fou r M i n i s t r i e s and the 
2009 government budget ( inc lud ing func t iona l as well as economic classifications). Furthermore, the 
2009 budget was published on the Ministry o f Finance (MoF ) website at the same time as i t was 
presented to the Parliament. The Bank has prov ided support t o these ac t iv i t ies through TA on PFM , 
po l icy dialogue on ins t i tu t iona l reform, lending assistance on c i v i l service modernization, and capacity 
building in i t ia t ives to support government s ta f f in conducting more e f fec t ive in terna l audits. 

D. 
Pillar IV: Increasing Resource Sustainability through Improved Management o f Water 
Resources and Reduced Population Pressure 

40. 

The fourth pillar focused on CAS outcomes in two areas: (i) water resource management and 

(ii) con tro l over popu la t ion growth. Planned CAS support inc luded seven ongo ing projects, t h r e e new 
projects ( two were delivered, along with th ree add i t iona l f inanc ing operations), and seven non- lend ing 
activities (a l l but tw o were delivered). Water resource management ac t iv i t ies have been buttressed by 
t r u s t funds on coastal zone management, commun i ty water management, and water sector support. Table 
9 shows the various e lemen ts o f the C A S program that have supported P i l la r N activities. 

4 1. 

Overall performance on Pillar IV outcomes i s rated moderately satisfactory. Good progress 

was made against CAS indicators established to measure achievements in the water sector, but results on 
population-related indicators were limited. (A detailed analysis o f achievements i s presented Appendix 2 . ) 
Despite unsatisfactory progress o n popu la t ion objectives in the CAS, an ove ra l l ra t ing o f moderately 
satisfactory i s justified due to the comparative we igh t o f the Bank ’s planned and actual programm ing in 
the water sector and the re la t ive ly pos i t ive r e s u l t s achieved by those programs. The P i l la r N CAS 
outcomes were and rema in highly relevant t o Yemen’s longer-term development goals in light o f c r i t ica l 
issues surrounding the sustainability o f water resources, rap id popu la t ion growth, and l o w reproductive 
health status in Yemen. G iven these urgent concerns, the CAS was appropriately ambitious in this area. 
Results were incomplete, however. Approaches t o water resource management did no t address 
substantively the ro le o f qat in disproportionately consuming scarce water resources. Ac t iv i t ies targeting 
improvement o f con t ro l over popu la t ion g row th were large ly symbolic, and the Population I1 pro jec t was 
no t delivered despite the c r i t ica l challenges associated with demographic transition.

Average cost and time o f preparation was relatively high, excluding additional financing 
operations. A t U S $ 472,000 ( U S $ 557,000 with P H R D grants) fo r FY2006-2008, the h igh average cost 

o f preparation was driven by the considerable preparation expenses fo r highly decentralized p r o j e c t ~ . ' ~ 
Human and ru ra l development projects are typ ica l ly more costly t o prepare than projects in other sectors. 
L im i ta t ions in borrower capacity are also a factor. In contrast, preparation costs fo r additional f inanc ing 
operations in FY2006-2008 averaged U S $ 66,000, as they o f ten built on extensive supervision activities. 
The average time o f preparation--from 
concept note to approval-was 
23.8 months when exc lud ing 
add i t iona l f inanc ing and 15.39 months fo r a l l Yemen operations (as compared to 13 months Bank -w ide 
and 17.75 months in the Middle East and N o r t h A f r i c a (MNA) region. The IRD PG took on ly nine months 
to develop -from concept note to approval. 

SuDewision 

47. 
The Bank devoted greater resources to project supervision, resulting in improved 
supervision quality. Average supervision resources grew f rom U S $ 54,000 in F Y 0 3 t o US$ 110,000 in 

FY08 , b r ing ing the average fo r FY2006-2009 to U S $ 103,000-slightly 
above MNA 's average. As a 
result, IEG ratings fo r Bank Performance at Supervision show an increase f rom 62.5 percen t under the 
previous CAS t o 66 percent in the C A S fo r FY2006-2009 (see below).

B) F i d u c i a r y Risk Managemen t and Safeguards

Particular attention has been devoted t o managing fiduciary r i s k s in IDA-financed projects, 
but the level o f financial management country risk remains high. F i d u c i a r y risks in Y em e n r e s u l t

management o f projects inc lude weak ins t i tu t iona l capacity, the limited number o f qua l i f ied f inanc ia l 
management and aud i t ing professionals in the country, and a weak in terna l con t ro l environment. 
Manag ing these risks w i l l require close mon i to r ing by the Bank, coup led with ac t iv i t ies geared toward 
strengthening country f inanc ia l management capacity. 

50. 
The Bank strengthened its oversight o f procurement. There was one case o f misprocurement 
in one o f the water projects, but procurement performance imp roved in projects that encountered 
procurement problems during t h e previous CAS period. These improvements were supported by 
procurement s ta f f in the field. Oversight also improved as a r e s u l t o f care fu l diagnostic wo rk carried out 
by the reg iona l MNA procurement department, inc lud ing an Independent Procurement Performance 
Rev iew (IPPR) fo r the country and Independent Procurement Reviews (IPRs) fo r ind iv idua l projects. 

51. 
N o safeguard issue arose during the CAS period. The Bank conducted a safeguards po r t fo l io 
review, inc lud ing a field rev iew o f r i s k y projects, and prov ided TA t o the Env ironmen ta l Protection 
Au tho r i ty (EPA) fo r the review o f ex is t ing laws, bylaws, and regulations; preparation o f sectoral 
guidelines; and tra in ing o f E P A staff. At the pro jec t leve l , the review showed that many Category B 
Project Management Units (PMU) do no t systematically iden t i fy specific s ta f f responsible fo r 
implementation o f safeguards m i t iga t ion measures. Moreover, safeguards appear to be a high p r io r i ty 
on ly in project preparation, no t always during supervision. Go ing forward, the pr ior i t ies are to : (i) 
strengthen national safeguards compliance through improved capacity in l ine m i n i s t r i e s to comp ly with 
na t iona l laws and improved E P A capacity fo r mon i to r ing and en forc ing compliance; (ii) increase 
supervision focus on safeguards; and (iii) strengthen mon i to r ing and repor t ing on safeguards compliance. 

IEG and OAG Evaluations 

52. 
I E G conducted four project exit evaluations. G iven the number o f extensions granted through 
the seven additional f inanc ing operations, on ly fou r projects closed during the CAS per iod . T w o closed in 
FY2006 (Southern Governorates Ag r icu l tu ra l Pr iva t iza t ion and C h i l d Development) and tw o in FY2007 
(Basic Education Expansion Project and Ru ra l Access improvement program), hav ing disbursed a to ta l o f 
US$ 153 m i l l ion . Bank and Bo r rowe r performance were deemed satisfactory fo r the tw o projects that 
closed in FY2007, and the qua l i ty o f supervision was rated h igh ly satisfactory. Bo r rowe r performance 
was rated unsatisfactory fo r the t w o projects that closed in FY2006 due to l o w government ownership 
(particularly fo r “so f t” components such as capacity building), reforms that were exceedingly d i f f icu l t , 
and l o w P M U capacity. Ins t i tu t iona l development was considered modest o r neg l ig ib le fo r the tw o 
projects that exited in FY2006 . The Imp lemen ta t ion Comp le t ion Repor t fo r the Southern Governorates 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Pr iva t iza t ion pro jec t was rated exemplary. IEG recommendations included: (i) closer on-the- 
ground supervision, par t icu lar ly fo r “soft” components; (ii) simpler pro jec t design adapted to the loca l 
context; (iii) s t a f f decentralization t o fac i l i ta te rap id response t o project-related problems and improved 
donor coordination. I t was agreed in the Yemen 2008 CPPR Ac t ion P lan that Bank task managers wou ld 
strengthen efforts to ensure realistic po r t fo l io assessment p r io r to pro jec t ex i t so as t o diminish the gap 
be tween projected and actual pro jec t outcomes, and avo id tr igger ing a Coun try Record flag. 

53. 
The net disconnect between the actual outcome o f projects leaving the portfolio and the task 
team’s supervision assessments o f performance prior to exit was highlighted in the 2008 CPPR. In 
the last two CAS periods, Bank supervision assessments have been typ ica l ly more op t im is t ic than the 
actual outcomes recorded in comp le t ion reports and IEG project exit evaluations. B e tw e e n 1998 and 
2007, 29 percent o f projects f e l l short o f their development objectives while on ly one o f 20 projects (5 
percent) was designated as a “problem project” at any g iven time and no pro jec t was considered “at 
risk.”lg Du r ing the CAS period, the team devoted par t icu lar attention t o the candor o f Imp lemen ta t ion

Bo x 1: The Influence o f Wo r ld Bank Analytical W o r k on W a t e r Sector Strategy and Policy in Yemen 

The World Bank 's interventions in the water sector have been guided by the sector work that produced the f r s t 
Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy (CWRAS) in 2005. This strategy provided for five areas o f support 
in l i n e with National Water Sector Strategy and Investment Program (NWSSIP) o f 2004: (1) sector restructuring 
and institutional development; (2) decentralized water resources management through assistance to the National 
Water Resource Authority (NWRA) and basin and local-level initiatives; (3) water resources management and 
water use efficiency through irrigation improvement; (4) urban water reform and investment to expand coverage; 
and (5) r u r a l water and sanitation reform and investment. These approaches were incorporated into t h e 2006 CAS. 

Working together with other donors and under the leadership o f t h e Ministry o f Water and Environment and the 
Ministry o f Agriculture and Irrigation, the Bank supported NWSSIP implementation through five water sector 
operations backed up by strong analytical work, including a Country Social Analysis, a study on a possible sector- 
wide approach (SWAP) in the water sector, a Poverty and Soc ia l Impact Analysis (PSIA) on groundwater, 
irrigation, and r u r a l water and sanitation sub-sectors, and a PSIA on the urban water and sanitation sector. 

Based on this body o f ESW, the Government requested that the Bank and development partners move forward 
with a SWAP to guide and coordinate program implementation in the sector. This move has culminated in the 
preparation o f the Water Sector Support Project (WSSP) co-fmanced by Germany and the Netherlands.

Trust Funds 

59. 
Yemen benefited from a rich and varied trust funds (TF) portfolio, reflecting the Bank’s 
strength in leveraging additional resources from partner organizations. There are 30 active TFs in 
the por t fo l io , with to ta l commitments o f about U S $ 82 m i l l i o n in FY2009 . Three-quarters o f these 
commitments represented mu l t i -dono r co-financing. M o r e than h a l f o f Yemen’s mu l t i-donor TF 
allocations (US$ 58 m i l l ion ) are curren t ly directed to mu l t i-donor TFs in the education sector (basic 
education and the Education Fo r A l l Fast Track In i t ia t ive) . The mu l t i-donor G loba l Food Cr is is Response 
Program represented the second-largest allocation, after education, at U S $ 10 m i l l i o n . The Netherlands 
prov ided a US$ 5.7 m i l l i o n TF to co-finance the C i v i l S e r v i c e Mode rn iza t ion Project, and a U S $ 1 
m i l l i o n mu l t i-donor grant was approved t o develop the capacity o f the D irec tora te General o f An ima l 
Hea l th t o better respond to a po ten t ia l A v i a n Flu c r i s i s . 

60. 
Trust funds were strategically integrated into the Yemen country team’s business planning 
process. Po l icy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grants supported the preparation o f three 
lending operations delivered during the pe r iod fo r a to ta l cost o f U S $ 1.1 m i l l ion . Stand-alone activities 
inc luded funding o f US$ 700,000 f r om the Public-Private Infrastructure Adv iso ry Fac i l i ty (PPIAF) fo r 
pub l ic-pr iva te partnership (PPP) models o f domestic gas p ipe l ine financing; 
two Ins t i tu t iona l 
Development Fund Grants; a G loba l Env ironmen t Fac i l i ty (GEF) ru ra l e lec tr i f ica t ion project; funding o f 
three co-term positions in t h e Bank coun try o f f ice ; and support f rom the Japan Social Development Fund 
(JSDF) and the Trust Fund fo r Env i ronmen ta l ly and Soc ia l ly Sustainable Deve lopmen t (TFESSD). 
Annua l TF disbursements o f U S $ 19.2 m i l l i o n in FY2008 were equivalent to rough ly one - f i f th o f annual 
lending disbursements fo r IDA projects. 

61. 
The TF portfolio performed well overall. Trust-funded ac t iv i t ies tended t o pe r fo rm be t ter than 
the broader por t fo l io , in par t because these trust funds are linked t o the po r t fo l io ’s better-performing 
projects. In addition, trust-funded ac t iv i t ies have benefited f rom s l igh t ly d i f fe ren t disbursement 
procedures and, in many cases, mon i to r ing by multiple donor partners. Recipient-executed t r u s t funds 
experienced some s low disbursement and implementation delays due t o weak loca l capacity, limited 
fam i l ia r i ty with Bank procedures, and delays in the procurement process. Such r isks were m i t iga ted 
through close cooperation with the reg iona l TF coordinator to f lag s low o r non-disbursing t r u s t funds fo r 
special attention. 

Decentralization 

62. 
The Country Office in Yemen played a major r o l e in coordinating CAS activities and 
following up on portfolio performance. To ta l s ta f f numbers in the coun try o f f ice remained stable over 
the CAS period, though the number o f field-based technical and professional s ta f f has increased. A DFID 
trust fund has supported the add i t ion o f th ree international s ta f f in Sana’a, inc lud ing a macroeconomist, 
pub l ic sector management specialist, and water specialist. The presence o f f iduc ia ry s t a f f was 
strengthened through the deployment o f an In terna t iona l Procurement Specialist in Yemen, and 
implementation support was fac i l i ta ted by an expanded presence o f Task Team Leaders in the field: 42 
percent o f the 19 projects in the current po r t fo l io are managed f r om the field. This increased field 
presence has helped the country team respond in rea l time to government requests fo r assistance, as in the 
case o f Technical Assistance o n new procurement leg is la t ion and the development o f t h e NRA. Fo r the 
most part, l o w turnover in task management helped ensure con t inu i ty and strengthen implementation. In 
the area o f po r t fo l io management, the Coun try Manager in Yemen and other coun try s ta f f are members o f 
a CPPR fo l low -up committee invo lv ing senior o f f ic ia ls f rom M o P IC and M o F .

f inanc ia l assistance, the Bank has focused on: (i) he lp ing to mob i l ize other donors; (ii) supporting the 
Government in designing sound sector-wide and thematic strategies; (iii) building sector-wide multi- 
donor investment programs; (iv) he lp ing to strengthen broader coun try imp lemen ta t ion capacity through 
i t s ow n projects; (v) assisting in imp rov ing core Government systems; and (vi) demonstrating new 
implementation approaches that, i f successful, can be mainstreamed by the Government and other 
development partners. The Bank has also p layed a ma jo r convening ro le in donor coordination and a id 
harmonization through i t s ro le as co-chair o f the C G meeting in November 2006, wh ich brought a host o f 
new donors t o the table, par t icu lar ly f r om the A rab Wo r ld . This renewed donor engagement has 
strengthened the development debate and sent a signal t o pr iva te investors that attractive new investment 
opportunities are on the ho r izon in Yemen. 

65. 

Under the CAS, the Bank Group has made considerable efforts to build effective 
partnerships, including among non-traditional development partners. At the coun try program level, 

Yemen has been selected as a p i l o t country fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f the OECD Principles fo r Good

programm ing in the water sector and the Government-organized meeting o f donors in the transport sector 
illustrates good progress in donor harmon iza t ion over the C A S period. Yemen has also made progress in 
expanding i t s partnerships beyond the trad i t iona l group o f donors to include GCC countries and 
institutions. The Bank has support this move through i t s dialogue, as w e l l as in ESW on GCC in tegra t ion 
delivered in FY08 . 

B. Building Capacity in Yemen: the R o l e o f World Bank Institute (WBI) 

66. 
Acknowledging that weak institutional capacity i s the most formidable challenge to 
Yemen’s development, the CAS envisaged a more integrated approach to capacity development 
with W B I as a full-fledged partner. W B I ’ s mu l t i -yea r program fo r Yemen was closely aligned with the 
CAS fo r FY2006-2009. Wh i le modest in size, the WBI program o f fered substantive and relevant capacity 
building in i t ia t ives in a number o f key areas, as evidenced by the steady increase in par t ic ipa t ion o f 
Yemenis in WBI activities. 

Children and Youth: In FY2007, at the Government’s request, the Bank and WBI prov ided capacity 
building and TA t o the ma in agencies tasked with implementing the new Ch i ldren and You th Strategy 
in designing and implementing their ac t ion plans. 

Health: The Tra in ing and Capacity Building Program in Yemen was par t o f the WBI F lagsh ip 
Program o n Hea l th Sector Re fo rm and Sustainable Finance. I t s a im i s t o build a constituency o f 
hea l th care managers and decision-makers who share a common understanding o f the challenges and 
paradigms o f health sector reform, and appreciate the advantages and disadvantages o f different 
re fo rm options. This in i t ia t ive assisted the Government in i t s e f fo r t to re fo rm hea l th insurance and 
decentralize the hea l th sector. The program consisted o f four t ra in ing courses on hea l th sector re fo rm 
and one course on Rap id Resu l ts Assessment to s treng then health pro jec t implementation. 

Groundwater Management and Monitoring: WBI support focused on imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
na t iona l water strategy, especially on water use regulation; on wo rk ing with water use r groups to r e - 
enforce groundwater w i thd rawa l regulation; and on building PPPs t o improve water use e f f ic iency 
and service delivery. 

Governance Diagnostics: Starting f r om FY2008, WBI has been supporting a ma jo r W o r l d Bank 
governance in i t ia t ive by wo rk ing with an MNSED An t i -Co r rup t ion Technical Assistance Project 
aimed at supporting the SNACC in developing and implementing a Na t iona l An t ico r rup t ion Strategy 
and A c t i o n Plan. Under this program, WBI i s assisting the government in undertaking a Coun t ry 
Governance and An t ico r rup t ion Survey to diagnose the scope and nature o f corrup t ion and poor 
governance and the sector and sub-sector leve l . The survey wou ld focus on the barriers to service 
access and qua l i ty and prov ide baseline data on corrup t ion and service de l ivery that wou ld help the 
government evaluate future progress in i t s fight against corruption.

Collaboration between the Bank and IF’C has increased under the CAS period. I F C opened 
an o f f ice in Sana’a in 2005 (co-located with IDA), and substantially increased i t s operations during t h e 
CAS period, focusing on the f inanc ia l sector, sma l l and medium en te rp r ise ( S M E ) development, 
education and health, manufacturing, agribusiness, and infrastructure ( inc lud ing PPP transaction advice, 
power and transport sectors). Though the CAS fo r FY2006-2009 was prepared by IDA only, bo th 
ins t i tu t ions worked t o ensure coherence be tween their programs and to cooperate in areas o f mu tua l 

in teres t .

I F C has helped Yemen attract sophisticated new investors, most notably from Saudi 
Arabia, in addition to financing projects in key sectors vital fo r diversified economic growth. IFC ’s 
po r t fo l io has grown to US$ 150 m i l l ion , up f r om on ly US$ 16 m i l l i o n in FY2005 . IFC ’s commitments 
have r i s e n steadily in Yemen, f rom U S $ 35 m i l l i o n in FY2006 t o U S $ 91 m i l l i o n in FY2007 . In FY2008 , 
I F C comm i t ted US$ 24 m i l l i o n through t h r e e projects. Recent I F C commitments in Yemen inc lude the 
Magh rab i Hosp i ta l (US$ 10 m i l l ion) , University o f Science and Technology (US$ 8 m i l l ion ) , Saudi 
German Hosp i ta l (US$ 20 m i l l ion ) , the Trade Finance Fac i l i ty Line with Saba Is lam ic Bank (US$ 5.8 
m i l l ion ) , and Arab ian Yemen Cement Company (US$ 70 m i l l ion ) . A l l investments have contributed to 
employment generation and socio-economic development, in l i n e with the DPPR objectives. 

69. 
I n close coordination-and 
often direct collaboration-with World Bank teams, IFC’s 
Advisory Services have provided substantial assistance to Yemen in partnership with other donors, 
including DFID and the Netherlands. In add i t ion t o the advisory services described under P i l la rs I and 
I11 above, I F C i s engaged in the f o l l ow i n g areas: 

Business enabling environment and investment climate: (i) business start-up s imp l i f ica t ion 
(registration and licensing); (ii) tax s imp l i f ica t ion along with FIAS (design o f a new income tax law, 
assistance fo r i t s implementation, simplified tax repor t ing and auditing, development o f an SME tax 
system); (iii) investment po l icy and p romo t ion ( inc lud ing t o op t im ize the use o f existing f r e e zone 
and indus tr ia l estates in Yemen); (iv) mining po l icy re fo rm (legal, 
fiscal, 
institutional, and 
administrative re form) 

SME development: management t ra in ing through B u s i n e s s Edge; since 2005, IFC ’s f i v e accredited 
Bus iness Edge providers have sold 17,600 t ra in ing seats to 5,700 unique trainees 

Financial markets: (i) support t o “regional champion” banks f rom GCC to inves t in the bank ing 
sector in Yemen and establish new benchmarks and international bes t practices; (ii) assistance in 
developing t h e lega l and regu la tory environment fo r f inanc ia l leasing; (iii) advisory services to banks 
o n corporate governance, risk management, SMEs, etc.; ( iv) support t o the establishment o f Yemen’s 
f i r s t commercial m icro f inance ins t i tu t ion and leasing company 

Public-private partnerships: (i) transaction advisory services ( inc lud ing concession design, 
marketing o f the investment, and s truc tur ing and evaluation o f bids) fo r an Independent Power Project 
(IPP); and (ii) support to M o P IC in establishing a PPP unit 

70. 
I n January 2 0 0 9 , I F C signed a cooperation agreement with the Government o f Yemen and 
DFID to support a three-year advisory program worth U S $ 1 4 million. The program w i l l help further 
expand IFC ’s advisory ac t iv i t ies in t h e areas o f business enabling environment, f inanc ia l markets, SME 
development, PPPs, and sustainability. 

71. 
Yemen i s also included in a global effort, I FC SME Ventures, which i s designed to promote 
the SME sector in select I D A countries through integrated investment and advisory services. I F C 
w i l l contribute the i n i t i a l U S $ 6 m i l l i o n t o establish an investment fund that w i l l p rov ide risk capital t o 
SMEs. I FC has also allocated approximately U S $ 2.5 m i l l i o n fo r associated advisory services to support

A valuable relationship o f mutual trust has developed between the Bank Group and the 

Government o f Yemen. T h e q u a l i t y o f d ia logue es tab l ished with t h e au tho r i t ies and o ther stakeholders

75. 
The Bank Group’s convening ro l e i s increasingly important in an environment where aid

Annex 7: IFC - IDA Joint Strategy Implementation 

A. Translating a jo in t strategy into operational cooperation 

1. The CAS a i m to leverage synergies across the Bank Group, in l ine with President 

Zoe l l ick ’s v is ion o f a “One W o r l d Bank vision”. With support f rom the IDA / I F C 
Secretariat, the CAS was hence developed as a truly j o i n t produc t with substantial and 
substantive invo lvemen t by bo th IDA and I F C in i t s des ign . 

2. The jo int approach is built on a solidpre-existing foundation. IDA and I F C teams are co- 

located in the same country o f f ice (in Sana’a) and use the same technical hub (in Cairo). 
Sustained e f for ts have been made over the last years t o ensure an adequate f l o w o f in fo rma t ion 
across the tw o organizations and to strengthen coord ina t ion (e.g. j o i n t sectoral meetings in the 
ene rgy sector, j o i n t supervision o f the ongo ing Safe Mo the rhood Program) - in large part 
thanks t o management e f for t . A number o f sector teams have demonstrated their willingness 
t o learn about the other side o f bus iness and to develop strategic interactions, a lbe i t in fo rma l . 
The Yemeni authorities have also ind ica ted their strong support to an integrated Bank G roup 
approach. 

3 . The CAS proposes to take this agenda forward. B o t h IDA and I F C are seeking a more 

forma l ized cooperation t o further leverage each other and achieve better r e s u l t s o n the ground. 
At the strategic level, this requ i res deve lop ing a shared assessment o f constraints and 
pr ior i t ies , and a coordinated selection o f proposed instruments - wh ich was done through the 
C A S process. A t the l e v e l o f each sector, this w i l l r e s t on prac t ica l too ls wh ich w i l l vary 
across sectors, and can include: (i) preparing j o i n t activities; (ii) designing a comprehensive 
program o f complementary activities; (iii) strategically sequencing separate ac t iv i t ies to 
ensure op t ima l complementarity; o r (iv) coord ina t ing po l icy dialogue. 

4. This approach is reflected in the proposed arrangements for the integration of 

IDA and 

IFCp rog rams . Such arrangements are expected to rema in light and flexible, but t o a l low fo r 
close mon i to r ing o f the actual complementarity o f ac t iv i t ies between bo th institutions. This 
includes bo th a comm i tmen t to h o l d semi-annual rev iew o f progress by the j o i n t management 
o f bo th ins t i tu t ions (at D i rec to r leve l ) and close co l labora t ion be tween relevant IDA and I F C 
t e am s throughout the CAS per iod in implementing ac t iv i t ies under the five “target strategic 
themes” ( f inanc ia l sector, business environment, energy, mining, and health). 

5 . Fo r each strategic theme, I D A and IFC teams developed a common program. Strategic 

themes were selected as those sectors / areas where enhanced cooperation i s expected to yield 
the highest r e s u l t s (in view o f the cu r ren t status o f the programs). Management also 
highlighted that the challenge fo r IDA and I F C teams i s to develop a business cu l ture o f close 
cooperation. Hence j o i n t sectoral approaches should be developed in such a way that they 
translate in to enhanced cooperation throughout CAS implementation (and no t on ly during 
C A S design). W i t h i n the context o f the C A S preparation, each I D A - I F C sectoral team was 
hence requested to jo in t ly : (i) identify possible obstacles t o an e f fec t ive and genuine 
cooperation; (ii) develop an agreement on sectoral pr ior i t ies and respective instruments; and 
(iii) build an ac t ion p lan to ensure sustained f o l l ow up throughout the CAS imp lemen ta t ion 
period.

B. Findings of the jo int sectoral teams: challenges andpossible solutions for enhanced 
cooperation 

6 . K e y challenges f o r enhanced coope ra t ion i d e n t i f i e d by the j o i n t teams inc lude : 

The need to agree on a clear sharing of roles and responsibilities in sectors whe re there 

i s po ten t ia l ove r lap (e.g., p r i v a t e sector deve lopmen t (IDA) / bus iness enab l ing 
env i ronmen t (IFC)); 
The need to strengthen communication be tween teams in o rde r t o send cons is ten t 
messages t o the clients; 

The need to deal explicitly with differences in institutional approaches, in pa r t icu la r : (i) 

d i f ferences in c l ien ts targe ted by opera t ions and adv iso ry services in the same sector (e.g. 
p r i v a t e and p u b l i c banks in the f i n a n c i a l sector); (ii) p o t e n t i a l c o n f l i c t s be tween the 
r e l a t i v e l y s l ow pace o f r e f o rm s suppor ted by IDA a n d t h e eagerness to increase 
inves tmen ts by IFC (e.g. f inanc ia l , p ow e r and mining sectors); (iii) p o t e n t i a l c o n f l i c t o f 
interests within the B a n k G r o u p (e.g., r e f o rm s suppor ted by IDA l e a d i n g t o inves tmen t 
oppo r tun i t ies f o r IFC); 
The lack of corporate incentives f o r j o i n t w o r k as w e l l as f o r managemen t t o gu ide and 
m o n i t o r imp lemen ta t ion o f t h e j o i n t sec tora l strategies.

Annex 7 - IFC-IDA Joint Strategy Implementation 

0 F inanc ia l sector. 

IDA and IFC w i l l initially focus on capacity building activities to 
support the implementation o f the Yemen Financial Sector Reform Action Plan and begin 
strengthening associations in the sector and selected private bank, on corporate governance, 
risk management and MSME f inanc ia l services. In a second phase, the j o i n t team w i l l work 
on improving the legal and regulatory framework as well as the Central Bank’s supervision 
and oversight in areas o f corporate governance and risk management on private banks. 

0 M i n i n g . In the short term, IDA and IFC (including IFC Advisory Services) w i l l work 
together on policy i s s u e s to mitigate risks involved in investing in the mining sector. The 
IDA team w i l l continue implementation o f the ongoing t r u s t funds focused on mining 
institutional arrangement and promotion o f mining, and both teams w i l l continue their 
cooperation in the sector. Complementarity o f approaches w i l l be sought in operations 
going forward (Le. the planned IFC Advisory Services operation and the proposed IDA TA 
work and sector dialogue). 

0 Energy . While no specific joint activities are envisaged at this point, complementarity 
between IDA and IFC programs w i l l be maintained. IDA w i l l continue to promote power 
sector reform in Yemen, while IFC w i l l support the Government in instituting a Public- 
Private Partnership program (PPP) in the sector. In the short-term, IDA w i l l work towards 
improving the business climate fo r private sector investments in the power sector; in the 
medium-term IDA w i l l work with IFC in developing PPPs in power (including renewable 
energy) as well as na tura l gas midstream investments. 
IFC w i l l provide institutional 
support and transaction advice for a small number o f pilot PPP transactions. 

0 Hea lth . The j o i n t team w i l l contribute to the acceleration o f t h e achievement o f MDGs 4 & 
5 through the Health and Population Project and the ongoing Sa fe Motherhood Program. 
W h i l e IDA w i l l focus on financing investments o f t h e primary and secondary health care 
levels, IFC w i l l assess potential private health sector investment opportunities, and possibly 
undertake advisory support jointly with IDA for a PPP to strengthen Gomhoriya hospital 
(tertiary care level) which w i l l complement the broader Aden health coverage plan 
supported by IDA .
