EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Mo rocco ’s considerable development achievements ove r the past decade have initiated a 
process of social and economic transformation, positioning the country as one o f the leading 
reformers in the M E N A region. Morocco i s strategically positioned between the European Union and 
Sub-Saharan Africa, endowed with both Mediterranean roots and a long Atlantic coast, and i s a leading 
member o f the Arab world. Successive governments have invested in solid macro-economic 
management, progressive opening o f trade w i th regional and global partners, and an ambitious process o f 
legal, policy and institutional modernization that has far-reaching political, economic and social 
dimensions. Sustained higher growth rates have led to a decrease in absolute poverty and unemployment 
levels, while access to services o f education, clean water, and rural roads has improved. These 
achievements have been recognized internationally. Morocco has reached investment grade status. I t had 
i t s second successful international bond offering without external guarantee in 2007. I t has become one 
o f the leading destinations o f foreign direct investment in MENA . I t i s the only country in the MENA 
region to have signed an advanced status agreement with the European Union. The international 
development community recognizes the relevance and quality o f i t s development program, and i s 
providing increased levels o f resources and support. 

ii. 

Buoyed by ten years o f good economic performance, M o r o c c o i s showing resilience in the 
global c r is is . The economic outlook i s relatively favorable. The past ten years have seen sustained 
output growth, falling unemployment, rising investment, substantial reduction in public debt, and low 
inflation. This performance i s largely due to sound macro-economic policies combined with determined 
implementation o f structural reforms. The financial crisis has had limited direct impact on the economy. 
Implementation o f a stimulus package has helped the most affected sectors and social groups deal with i t s 
impact. Monetary and exchange rates policies remain appropriate. The macroeconomic outlook i s 
projected to remain favorable. Higher financing needs, should they arise, can be dealt with through the 
domestic market as well as a planned increase in longer-maturing external financing. The external 
position i s projected to remain sustainable over the medium term. 

... 111. 

Despite this progress, M o r o c c o still lags on human development outcomes. Absolute poverty 
has decreased sharply, from 15 .3 percent to roughly 9 percent between 2001 and 2007, but economic 
vulnerability (near-poverty) remains widespread meaning that a quarter o f population - 8 million people - 
remains either in absolute poverty or under constant threat o f poverty.. Unemployment stands at a 30- 
year low (9 .6 percent in 2008) but youth unemployment i s high, social protection coverage i s limited, and 
better jobs are needed for inequality to decrease. There has been a remarkable increase in access to 
education, but overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity i n access to secondary education remain very 
high. Both education quality and learning outcomes severely lag those o f other countries with similar 
income levels. Despite progress in increasing overall l i f e expectancy and reducing average infant 
mortality rate, levels o f infant and maternal mortality remain unacceptably high, and lag MDG targets. 
Inequality and urban-rural disparities in poverty and social outcomes remain a challenge. Youth 
exclusion i s a concern. Social and human development challenges are at the core o f the current 
government program, including the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) and health and 
education strategies developed since 2007. 

iv. 
The main long-term challenge i s to achieve higher growth and employment creation, while 
reducing social disparities and ensuring the environmental sustainability o f the development model. 
F i rs t ly , achieving higher and more sustained growth i s key to solving the unemployment challenge and 
w i l l require a combination o f higher quality human capital, an improved business environment, better and 
cheaper access to key infrastructure services, and a more competitive private sector capable o f driving 

increased economic diversification and export-orientation in a global economy. Secondly, reducing high 
inequality w i l l require soc ia l protection systems and safety nets and a reduction o f the rural-urban gap. 
Addressing the lagging condition o f women i s a priority. Access to quality soc ia l infrastructure and 
services such as roads, health, education, water and sanitation, and electricity i s key to achieving positive 
spillover e f f e c t s from urban growth-poles. Thirdly, ensuring long-term environmental sustainability 
requires addressing head-on the increasing vulnerability to climate change. Here, the immediate and 
overwhelming concern i s to cope with increased scarcity o f water. This requires transformative change in 
water allocation and management practices, as well as in institutional roles and capacities. Transforming 
the energy sector i s the next objective, focusing in particular on enhancing energy security while scaling 
up mitigation e f fo r ts . Morocco’s energy risks can be better managed through closer regional integration 
and can benefit greatly from carbon financing options. 

v. 
Starting i n 2007, Morocco elaborated a comprehensive set of new sector strategies to lead 
economic and social transformation over the next five years. In assuming the throne in 1999, K ing 
Mohammed V I se t out a vision o f rapid growth, improved transparency and governance, poverty 
eradication, and better soc ia l conditions. Since then, successive governments elaborated and sought to 
implement this vision. The government program for the period 2008-2012 frames the main directions for 
reform. The program has three main objectives: (i) improve soc ia l indicators by focusing on health, 
education, and more effective soc ia l protection; ( i i ) enhance growth, export potential and investment by 
focusing both on relevant transversal issues and on key sector strategies (industrial emergence, energy, 
water, agricultural development, export strategy, and justice); and ( i i i ) implement cross-cutting reforms 
that influence results in a l l sectors, such as improving governance, reforming public administration and 
deepening decentralization and deconcentration fo r better service delivery. This was followed by a major 
e f f o r t o f strategic formulation in key sectors, starting with the six priority sectors: health, education, 
agriculture, water, and energy, with justice s t i l l under preparation. Budget allocations, with a multi-year 
commitment, were increased substantially for these sectors. 

vi. 
The Bank Group’s objective over the next four years i s to support implementation o f the 
reform program. The government’s program i s encountering implementation challenges typical o f 
second generation reforms. This i s the area where the WBG has been specifically asked to help. Firstly, 
the WBG w i l l contribute on “the how to” o f implementation by facilitating institutional reform, 
sequencing of steps, and change-management, This i s an area in which Bank’s DPLs and analytic 
program have developed a solid track record. Secondly, the WBG w i l l continue to support reform 
implementation in areas requiring inter-agency coordination, and capacity building, through both S I L s 
and DPLs accompanied by analytical work. Finally, as requested by the government, a l l CPS activities 
w i l l seek to pay particular attention to increasing the results orientation o f country programs. The CPS i s 
structured around three thematic pillars o f relevance to both IBRD and IFC: (1 ) growth, competitiveness 
and employment; (2) service delivery to citizens; (3) sustainable development in a changing climate; and 
two cross-cutting “beams”-- governance and territoriality. 

vii. 
The government i s inviting the WBG to increase i t s financial support, rema in an engaged 
knowledge partner, and maintain a flexible approach. The CPS ensures continuity in the WBG’s 
support to government, as well as opportunities fo r scaling up and expanding engagement to new areas 
(e.g., climate change, skills development, or new opportunities opened by the Arab World Initiative, the 
Clean Technology Fund, or the Concentrated Solar Plan). CPS implementation w i l l be characterized by 
flexibility to respond to new reform opportunities or challenges (a key lesson o f the CAS Completion 
Report), and a focus on monitoring results (both helping the government monitoring its program as well as 
tracking results from WBG activities). This i s ensured by a flexible and evolving CPS framework, built 
around 19 program areas (encompassing lending and knowledge activities) which are at different stages o f 
development. This provides a medium term (24 months) business plan o f firmly developed activities 
where expected outcomes can be laid out, as well as a longer term strategic framework to foster selectivity, 

ii 

including areas where activities w i l l be defined later. I t i s envisaged that the CPS result matrix w i l l be 
fully up-dated mid-point through implementation. 

viii. 
The government has requested I B R D lending of $600 million annually. This level i s 
confirmed f o r FY10 , with lending levels f o r F Y l l - 1 3 indicative. This adds up to an expanded IBRD 
program in Morocco, focused on reform. Government asked the Bank for help in addressing structural 
constraints and long-term challenges, and particularly with reform implementation. As stated by a 
Government o f f i c i a l during a joint CPS brainstorming, “from the Bank program, the project we seek i s 
about the implementation o f reforms”. 

ix. 
I n line w ith the principles o f additionality and selectivity, I F C i s expected to deploy a sizable 
investment and advisory program, contingent on demand and market conditions. IFC ’s investment 
strategy w i l l complement IBRD activities in close alignment w ith the CPS pillars. IFC w i l l focus on 
financial and infrastructure sectors, as well as on high value-added investments in manufacturing, social 
sectors (health and education) and agribusiness. IFC’s potential investments in energy, utilities or ports 
as well as select investments in Emergence’s sectors, would contribute to Pillar 1 o f the CPS (growth, 
competitiveness and employment). Potential investments in the banking sector, microfinance and the 
education sectors would help improve financial and educational services to citizens (Pillar 2) . Finally, the 
focus on potential investments in renewable energy w i l l contribute to Morocco’s sustainable development 
objectives (Pillar 3). 
IFC w i l l also continue to deliver its on-going advisory program, in support o f 
business environment and financial sector reform. 

x. 
The international development community’s engagement i n Morocco i s well coordinated 
and guided by national programs and strategies. The CPS stands ready to take this further and 
actively support the EU advanced status agreement. ODA has grown significantly in recent years, 
although i t remains a modest portion o f total public expenditure. Delivery i s characterized by alignment 
with government programs, an advanced level o f coordination, and increased use o f budget support and 
country systems. IBRD and the EU are currently engaging jo in t ly in five key sectors (health, education, 
MDH, PAR, and rural roads), for a joint to ta l financing above $900 million. This strategic collaboration 
i s expected to increase as the EU advanced status agreement evolves. In this context, the government has 
expressed a preference for working with DPLs in support o f policy reform, and i t i s expected that this 
should represent a large proportion o f the program. The CPS w i l l seek to advance the greater use o f 
country systems, as requested by the government. 

xi. 
The CPS identifies the risks to the program and proposals to mitigate them. F i rs t , the short- 
term growth outlook i s subject to uncertainties on the timing, speed and shape o f the recovery from the 
global crisis. The Bank w i l l help analyze the risks through continued monitoring and dialogue with the 
authorities on the overall macroeconomic context, as well as through analysis o f options for remedial 
measures and program adaptation, contingent on need and government request. Second, the successful 
implementation o f the reform agenda i s dependent upon political economy factors. Second generation 
reforms w i l l likely see resistance from affected interests. Possible outcomes include the derailing o f 
reform objectives, a stalling o f the reform process, and a decline o f the credibility o f the reform agenda in 
the eyes o f public opinion. The Government’s recent emphasis on governance reforms, such as that o f the 
justice sector, w i l l help mitigate these risks. The Bank w i l l offer appropriate TA - with, i f requested, a 
specific focus on political economy constraints - to support the implementation o f sector strategies.

I. I N T R O D U C T I O N 

1 , 
The Wo r ld Bank Group’s engagement in Morocco i s framed by four parameters. These are 
c lea r national development goals, substantial challenges alongside considerable achievements, an 
increasingly sophisticated client, and requests for an expanded engagement to support further reform. 

2 . 

The Government has set clear development goals that guide public policy. 
Since the 
accession o f K ing Mohammed V I in 1999, successive governments have articulated a pro-development

Public funding i s then allocated to strategic priorities. The result i s a program o f political, economic, and 
social reforms whose effects are starting to be visible, even as much more remains to be done.

Morocco’s recent development ‘trajectory i s one o f contrasts. Considerable achievements i n 
establishing a sound macroeconomic framework, reducing poverty and extending access to basic services 
have not yet allowed i t to achieve key social indicators, which in areas like health and education remain 
well below those o f comparable countries. The contrast between growth on one hand, and poverty and 
exclusion on the other, i s a main development challenge. 

4 . 
Morocco i s an increasingly sophisticated client. Clarity in strategic direction i s matched by 
capacity in central government. Engagement takes place in an environment where development finance i s 
growing, but remains modest relative to the overall national development program. The Government 
increasingly seeks on-demand technical and strategic assistance. 

5 . 

The WBG’s program in Morocco i s expanding, focused on support to reform. The 
government has asked the Bank fo r help in addressing structural constraints and long term challenges, and 
particularly to support implementation o f the reform agenda. As stated by a Government official during a 
joint CPS brainstorming, “for the Bank program, the project we seek i s about the implementation o f 
reforms”. The identification o f the Bank as a key partner for reform implementation has led to requests 
for engagement in multiple sectors and for increased financial support.

Morocco’s recent development track record i s characterized by positive achievements 
alongside substantial challenges. Morocco has performed well in moving i t s development agenda 
forward during the past decade. Sound macro-economic management and good economic performance 
allowed for sustained capital spending on social and economic infrastructure and an amelioration o f key 
development indicators. The period 2001 to 2007 saw unprecedented ra tes o f poverty reduction, with 
absolute poverty decreasing from 15 percent to roughly 9 percent. Access to drinking water increased 
from 65 percent to 84.5 percent in 2007, net primary enrollment rates increased from 68.6 percent in 1998 
to 93.5 percent in 2007 and immunization coverage reached 94 percent. Yet, in spite o f the significant 
budgetary resources allocated to social sectors (more than 50 percent), key development outcomes in 
areas such as education, health and employment are below expectations. This limited progress i s 
evidenced by Morocco’s mixed MDG track record and Human Development Index (HDI) performance. 
Morocco i s likely to miss its targets on child mortality and maternal health, and lags behind regional 
neighbors and countries with comparable GDP per capita in terms o f HDI (Figure 1). In acknowledging 
that results have been below expectations, the Government recognizes the need to ensure that growth 
translates into broad based benefits and to reduce the disconnect between efforts and development 
outcomes.

Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook 

8 . 
Mo ro c co ’ s economic performance improved significantly dur ing the past decade, as 
indicated by sustained high growth in output, falling unemployment, rising investment, and low 
inflation. Economic growth averaged 5 . 1 percent over the period 2001 to 2008, almost twice as high as 
the average o f the previous decade. This performance allowed per capita income to almost double to 
reach US$2,850 in 2008. 
In addition, the growth pattern improved as i t became less volatile. 
Specifically, i t became l e s s dependent on agriculture, a sector that s t i l l accounts for a large, but 
decreasing share, o f GDP (an average 13 percent). Unemployment declined from 14 percent to 9.6 
percent, although questions remain over the quality o f the jobs available to large segments o f the 
population. Investment increased sharply from around 25 percent to 36 percent o f GDP, improving the 
prospects o f sustained strong performance. Inflation remained subdued at about 2.5 percent on average. 
Finally, Morocco became more integrated in the global economy, although the share o f trade i s s t i l l low 
relative to comparator countries (76 percent o f GDP), revealing ample room for improvement.

9 . 
Strong economic performance i s largely due to sound macroeconomic policies and sustained 
structural reforms. Since 2005, Morocco maintained sound f i s c a l policies leading to the consolidation 
o f public finances. As a result, the budget ran surpluses in 2007 and 2008 (averaging 0.3 percent o f 
GDP)'. The Government adopted a prudent debt strategy w i th central government debt declining to 47.3 
percent o f GDP in 2008 from 62 percent in 2005 (Figure 2). The Government pursued monetary policy 
geared toward maintaining low and stable inflation and enhanced financial sector supervision. Morocco's 
integration into the world economy deepened through the signing o f many FTAs. Overall, these efforts 
have led to a stable macroeconomic situation, stronger public finances, and a sound financial sector. 
Morocco gained investment grade status in 2007 from one rating agency, which further reinforced the 
confidence o f investors, both domestic and foreign.

The Government has implemented a stimulus package to help the most affected sectors and 
support incomes. The income support package includes an increase o f 10 percent in the wages o f c iv i l 
servants at the lower end o f the salary sca le and the minimum wage for private sector employees3. 
Effective January 2009, the marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent to 40 percent and w i l l be cut to 
3 8 percent January 2010. The upper end o f the exempt income bracket has also been extended. D i rec t 
support measures for affected firms include financial r e l i e f (guarantees on loans; rescheduling o f debt; 
help with export insurance) as well as subsidies for training and marketing. 

1 1 . 
Sound macroeconomic policies and efforts to improve competitiveness would allow M o r o c c o 
to respond to the global c r i s i s and to position itself t o benefit from the recovery o f the world 
economy. The government intends to maintain a prudent f i s c a l stance and to sustain the structural reform 
momentum o f recent years. Growth rates are projected to improve from 3 percent in 2010 to around 5.2 
percent in 2013, mostly driven by domestic demand, both private consumption and investment (Table 1). 
Achieving this level o f growth over the medium term i s contingent on implementing an ambitious reform 
program, and the recovery pace o f the main trading partners. 

12 . 
After a temporary higher deficit in 2010, the fiscal stance should remain sound over the 
medium term, w ith fiscal deficits under the targeted threshold o f 3 percent o f GDP. This would

derive from the ongoing fiscal reform and more targeted social programs, as we l l as a better-controlled 
wage b i l l . The budget deficit i s expected to edge up to 4.5 percent o f GDP in 2010 before dropping to 
around 2.2 percent by 2013. Reaching this outcome implies maintaining momentum o f the ongoing tax 
reform to broaden the tax base, improve the efficiency o f the VAT, strengthen tax administration, and 
remove tax exemptions. These measures would offset the negative impact o f the reduced top rates on 
corporate and personal income taxes. Under these assumptions, revenues are projected to stabilize at 
around 25 percent o f GDP. On the expenditure side, the consolidation o f public finances relies on three 
critical measures: reform o f o i l and food subsidies, tight control o f the public wage bill, and an active debt 
management. Under these conditions, public debt w i l l stabilize in 2010 at almost the same level as that o f 
2008 (47.6 percent o f GDP) before following a downward trend to less than 44 percent o f GDP in 20 13 .

The financing needs stemming from the higher budget deficit in 2010 and declining deficits 
over the medium term are easily financed through domestic market as well as from increased 
drawings on external loans (Table 2). 
In this context, domestic financing would remain the main 
source, although external financing would increase. Indeed, since 2006, net external financing reversed 
i t s long negative trend to turn positive, reflecting the government’s strategy to slightly change the debt 
composition in favor o f external borrowing. This financing strategy would ease the pressure on domestic 
financial markets and prevent crowding out o f the private sector’s investment now that the money market 
i s l e s s liquid than was the case in recent years. A t the same time i t i s consistent with the intention to 
maintain a comfortable level o f foreign reserves.

The external position i s expected to remain sustainable over the medium term. The current 
account i s expected to slightly deteriorate in 2009, and then to slowly decline to 3 .2 percent o f GDP in

2013. The balance o f payments i s expected to progressively improve, with lower trade and current 
account deficits, which would benefit from improved export performance and a recovery o f tourism 
activities and workers’ remittances. This scenario assumes continued reform efforts, sound 
macroeconomic and f i s c a l policies, and targeted sector strategies that en ta i l higher public investment. 
These would translate into higher private investments (including FDI), and progressive gains in export 
competitiveness, including tourism. I n this context, external debt i s expected to follow a downward trend 
to reach 23 percent o f GDP in 2013 down from 25 percent o f GDP i n 2010. A t the same time, gross 
foreign reserves would stay at an average o f 6 months o f imports.

Despite 
the positive growth 
experience of the last decade, persistent 
constraints to productivity and export 
orientation prevent M o r o c c o 
from 
reaching its full growth potential. Since 
the acceleration o f business environment 
reforms 
in 
the mid-nineties, private 
investment increased from 15 percent to 22 
percent o f GDP, a rate that compares to 
those in the most dynamic economies. FD I 
has also performed well. However, most o f 
this increase in private investment has 
occurred Outside 
the manufacturing 
sector (Figure 5) - mostly in real estate, 
tourism and services. Manufacturing exports have grown at 8 percent per year on average since 2002 - 
half the performance o f emerging middle-income countries. I n 2008, 72 percent o f manufacturing value- 
added and 77 percent o f exports were o f low technological intensity. The performance o f the 
manufacturing sector highlights the economy’s limits in productive capacity. The global slowdown and 
i t s impact on Morocco’s exports i s a reminder o f the need to diversify and enlarge the country’s export 
base away from low knowledge, low value-added, traditional products. Low value added exports further 
constrain growth as they f a i l to penetrate external markets and se t the economy on a low productivity/low 
growth/low wages course. Out o f i t s 20 most important exports, only one was in an activity growing in 
global trade where Morocco i s gaining world market share. Exports remain insufficiently diversified: 
Morocco exports 42 products per one million inhabitants, compared to 130 for Tunisia and 160 for 
Malaysia.

Business environment reforms have not yet led to the needed structural transformation of 
the private sector. Over the past decade Morocco has a) achieved a stable macroeconomic environment; 
b) improved the investment climate - including in the area o f infrastructure and regulations; c) adopted an 
ambitious FTA agenda; and d) turned i t s financial sector into one o f the most developed in the region. 
Yet, the progress in business environment reforms has not yet fostered the structural transformation o f the 
private sector into an engine o f a competitive, high-growth economy. Weaknesses remain, especially in 
those areas - like regulatory reform - that require a lot o f public agency coordination, and where a gap 
remains between the rules and regulations as they appear on the books and how they’re applied to 
individual investors. Also, some areas o f trade policy - including trade logistics and distortions in the 
trade regime between importers and local producers - remain weak. Financial sector reforms have yet to 
trickle down to domestic SMEs that remain credit constrained.

1 7 . 
Agriculture remains central for 
promoting growth, but the sector remains 
plagued 
by 
structural 
problems. 
Moroccan agriculture i s characterized by 
low productivity at farm level and low 
value-added along the agro-food chain. I t s 
dualistic nature sees a predominant rain-fed 
sub-sector (where 70 percent o f the poor 
live) co-exist with a smaller, but more 
competitive, export-oriented and irrigated 
sub-sector. Overall, producers, large and 
small, are constrained by the institutional 
environment. Weak investment incentives, 
low 
quality 
products, 
and 
diversification away from low value added 
products lock the sector into stagnant output, limited employment generation, and low incomes. The slow 
shift to high value crops and off-farm economy activities, together with a deficient rural transport 
infrastructure and weak land rights tenure systems i s s t i l l impinging on rural job creation and incomes. 
Morocco's efforts to take advantage o f the opportunities provided by a globalized food market remain 
constrained by limited progress in domestic price reform, market liberalization, and trade openness.

The unfinished business o f structural reform explains why the decrease in unemployment 
rates has not fully translated in improved households' well-being (Figure 6). Sustained growth had a 
direct positive e f f e c t on unemployment, which stands at a 30 - year low (9.6 percent in 2008 and 9 
percent over the first three quarters 2009). But to a large extent, the drop in overall unemployment veils 
critical shortcomings in the labor markets and the low quality o f growth. In urban areas, unemployment 
remains high ( 1 3 .8 percent), mainly for youth (3 1.6 percent), females (20.1 percent), and the educated 
( 1 8.7 percent). Improvement in employment i s also explained by low and decreasing participation rates - 
mainly for women (26.3 percent) - rather than by the ability o f growth to generate enough jobs. 
addition, the quality o f the jobs created remains a concern. Recent employment creation has favored low 
paid jobs in the informal and agricultural sectors and concentrated on low skilled workers. The labor 
market i s also characterized by skill shortages which constitute a constraint to the development o f high 
value-added businesses.

Poverty, Social and Human Development 

19. 
After the largely lost decade of the 1990s, the country achieved unprecedented rates of 
poverty reduction between 2001 and 2007 (Figure 7). Absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent to 
roughly 9 percent. The f a l l has been more marked in rural areas ( 1 0.6 percentage points reduction) than 
in urban areas (2.8 percentage points). Part o f this evolution i s explained by the e f f e c t o f sustained 
growth on unemployment, which stands at a 3 0 - year low (9.6 percent in 2008). The recent progress in 
poverty reduction made a decisive break with past performance, as for the first time since the 1980s the 
absolute number o f the poor i s clearly falling. 

20. 
Although absolute poverty has decreased, economic vulnerability (near-poverty) remains 
widespread. Based on official figures, 17.5 percent o f the population has consumption levels just above 
the poverty line. The combined number o f poor and vulnerable or near poor in Morocco i s 26.5 percent, 
meaning that a quarter o f population - or 8 m i l l ion people - remains either in absolute poverty or under 
constant threat o f poverty. The importance o f looking at near poverty (vulnerability) i n addition to 
absolute poverty results from three factors. First, poverty in Morocco i s measured by using a frugal 
poverty basket picking up only the very poor using a poverty line (10 dirhams per person per day) well 

6 

below that used by countries at similar GDP levels. Second, the period under review was preceded by a 
decade o f increasing poverty (from 1991 to 2001) during which many near poor were pushed into 
poverty. Resumed growth and economic stability helped these transient poor to move back to near- 
poverty from poverty, while core chronic poverty remained untouched. Lastly, the recent f a l l in poverty 
in rural areas i s not unprecedented. A similar episode o f falling rural poverty was observed between 1985 
and 1991, and i t was followed by a decade-long deterioration. The see-saw evolution o f poverty across 
the intermittent surveys in the 1990s reflects the vulnerability o f the economy to shocks, and the large 
number o f people who hover just above the poverty line.

2 1 . 
Despite being broad-based, recent progress in. poverty reduction was accompanied by 
increasing disparities. The partial closure o f the rural-urban gap has not cancelled entrenched 
disparities: 70 percent o f poverty in Morocco i s s t i l l rural. In 2007, the urban poverty ra te was 4.8 percent 
compared to 14.5 percent in rural areas. Even though a l l groups among the poor-the extreme poor, the 
poor, and the near poor - gained from growth, the pattern o f growth was not unambiguously pro-poor and 
i t was not equally shared. As inequality increased in both urban and rural areas to reach unprecedented 
levels, growth for the poor was slower than the average growth and it was s t i l l below the levels needed to 
reduce poverty by half in 20 years. Regional differences are substantial, but practically a l l regions contain 
pockets o f severe poverty in slum areas or in villages. 

2 2 . 
The overall decrease in unemployment rates has led to reduction in poverty incidence, but 
being employed does not necessarily guarantee protection from poverty. An absolute majority 
among the poor are working poor. The informal sector, primarily in agriculture, which employs 70 
percent o f Morocco's labor force, i s characterized by low pay, insecurity o f job tenure, and lack o f safety 
standards. Almost 70 percent o f Morocco's poor are employed in just two sectors (agriculture and 
construction) which are characterized by informality. Formal sector workers, especially those employed 
by the public sector, are well protected, and enjoy a significant wage premium. The poor, predominantly 
without education, or with only basic education, cannot compete for such jobs. 

2 3 , 
Recent e f fo r t s to increase the availability o f educational services and opportunities have led 
to expanded access to education at a l l levels, but have not always translated into improved 
outcomes. The national net enrollment rates for primary education increased from 52.4 percent (1 990- 

7 

1991) to 93.5 percent (2006-2007). N e t enrollment in middle school increased from 17.5 percent to 43.4 
percent (2006-2007), and in upper secondary education from 6.1 percent to 17.5 percent (2006-2007). 
This increased enrollment in compulsory education has placed pressure on higher education. I t has led to 
a substantial increase in student enrollment (about 25 percent between 1993 and 2006). Remarkable 
progress has also been made in-ensuring equitable access to education for children. The gender parity 
index in primary education between urban boys and r u r a l girls aged 6-1 1 has narrowed from 1.5 to 1 in 
the past decade. Nevertheless, the speed with which primary education has been generalized has not been 
accompanied by equivalent progress in returns to education, and serious enrollment disparities persist as 
children proceed through the education system. While access to primary education i s almost universal, 
only 71 percent o f children aged 6-1 1 complete primary schools (MDG 2008), and 72.2 percent o f ru ra l 
women cannot read (the national average for women i s 52.7 percent). Despite the noted increase in 
enrollment rates, the illiteracy rate o f the 15-24 cohort remains high (nearly 24 percent) with 
repercussions on labor productivity (MDG 2008). The quality o f education remains problematic. The 
grades o f Moroccan students in the TIMSS 2003 survey are low compared to the MENA region and other 
participating countries, despite high expenditure per pupil. 

24 . 
Lack o f affordable access to quality services explains why the poor are not benefiting from 
the expansion o f services. The poor gained from improvements in a l l social sectors, but not enough to 
make a decisive break with their condition, partly because o f limited access to services in sectors such as 
education, maternal health, and housing. For example, survey data show that only half o f the population 
uses health services for illness, and this share i s only 40 percent for the rural poor. Services are 
underused because o f financial, social, and geographic barriers. Low education outcomes o f the poor are 
related to problems o f progression through the system and low quality o f education. The main barriers for 
the poor in accessing better health care are high (informal and formal) payments, high transportation 
costs, and low quality o f service. Lack o f adequate local health fac i l i t ies , combined with poor roads and 
expensive transport, particularly hurts women. Overall, the performance o f the education sector shows 
how the contrast between achievements and gaps i s matched by a disconnect between efforts and 
outcomes.

Despite the recent improvement of health indicators, important gaps remain. The health 
financing and management systems do not appear to meet the needs o f the majority o f the population. I n 
addition to the deterioration o f physical infrastructure due to a lack o f appropriate maintenance, public 
health services suffer from an acute personnel constraint at a l l levels (medical and management). This i s 
reflected in the stark contrast with other health outcomes. Ma te rna l mortality stands a t 227/100,000, or 
45 times Europe’s average. 
Infant mortality rates (40/1,000 in 2004) remain intolerably high. The 
nutritional status o f infants and women remains o f concern, with approximately 18 percent o f under-five 
children considered to be stunted and approximately 9.3 percent wasted. Those in the lowest

I n the absence o f effective safety nets, large out-of-pocket payments fo r services strain the 

budgets o f the poor. In the health sector, until very recently, there was no systematic policy to provide 
health insurance to the poor. Major illness i s acknowledged to be one o f the most sizeable and least 
predictable shocks to the economic opportunities o f families. Healthcare expenditures may lead to 
divestment o f household assets (selling o f f property, and so forth), and ultimately to overall 
impoverishment. The poverty-ill-health vicious circle can undermine future economic welfare. Progress 
in housing and infrastructure i s also uneven. Despite impressive spending on a slum-upgrading program 
and a commitment to c lea r the slum areas, i t i s estimated that 780,000 households, or 4 million people, 
live in what i s considered “substandard or inappropriate” housing. Massive investments in the water 
supply have led to the improvement in access to sa fe water on a national scale. Yet many rural 
households have to travel to get potable water, and non-connected populations in poor neighborhoods in 
cities rely on standpipes, wells, or informal vendors. 

111. 

LONG TERM CHALLENGES 

2 7 . 
To consolidate its development achievements, M o r o c c o needs to address challenges that are 
both immediate and influence long-term outcomes. Over the past three years, the government has led 

a number o f diagnostic exercises involving the participation o f c iv i l society, academia and think tanks. 
These include the 2006 50 th Year Ann iversary Repor t ; the 2008 Repor t of 
the Superior Counc i l of 
Educa t ion ; the 2009 Repor t o f the Royal Ins t i tu te of S tra teg ic Studies (IRES); and the on-going Scenar i i 
2030 exercise led by the Haut Commissariat au Plan (HCP). These products converge in painting a 
picture o f substantial challenges, which can be clustered around three overarching objectives: ( i ) 
achieving higher growth and j o b creation; ( i i ) reducing soc ia l disparities; and (iii) ensuring sustainability. 
The government program, presented in Part IV , strives to addresses them. 

E n q u l t e nationale a lnd ica teurs Mu l t ip les e t Sante‘ des Jeunes, EN IMSJ 2006-2007, M in is try o f Health, January 2008). Lastly, 
few programs address the needs o f early childhood development either by prov id ing services or by encouraging demand for those 
services.

A. 

Accelerating Growth and Employment Creation 

2 8 . 
H ighe r and more sustained growth i s central to solving the unemployment challenge, but 
without higher quality human capital, higher growth w i l l not be achieved. Despite being markedly 
more positive than in the 1990s, current growth rates are insufficient to absorb the overall labor supply 
produced by the country’s demographic transition, the diminishing role o f agriculture in absorbing labor 
and a more active role for women in the job market. To enhance job creation over the next two decades, 
and to consolidate progress in reducing poverty, Morocco w i l l need to achieve a growth rate above 6 
percent a year. 
Investing in high valued added sectors i s a prerequisite to enhancing growth and 
improving job quality, as i s improving the quality o f human capital. Morocco has made progress in the 
education sector, but concerns about quality and efficiency remain. Despite evidence that continuous 
training increases labor productivity (and private sector growth), only 20 percent o f Moroccan firms in the 
manufacturing sector train their workers. Another important element to promote productivity growth, and 
hence better jobs, concerns the use o f active labor market and retraining programs to target workers 
and/or production units in the informal and agricultural sectors. The presence o f strong job protection 
mechanisms i s usually associated with lower formal employment and the proliferation o f part-time and 
informal jobs. 
Improving labor mobility and wages, and progressively increasing formal sector 
employment, w i l l require more flexibility in labor regulation, associated with the introduction o f income 
protection mechanisms. Finally, expanding the coverage o f the social insurance system w i l l imply having 
a more mobile labor force and workers that are more likely to engage in higher risks higher return 
activities.

i s a prerequisite for

diversification of the economy. N o 
emerging economy has been able to 
sustain high growth for long periods o f 
time without a competitive, diversified 
and technologically sophisticated private 
sector. Despite substantial progress since 
the launch o f the Emergence p r o g r am , 
Morocco i s still lagging in this area. 
Although real-estate, 
tourism and the 
services sector continue 
to show 
dynamism, industrial growth has lagged 
other emerging countries ( 2 . 9 percent a 
year, compared to an average o f 6 .2 
percent among emerging economies). 
Weaknesses remain in-areas that require public agency coordination (such as regulatory reform) and in 
the enforcement o f laws and their application to individual investors. Several constraints in the business 
environment remain problematic for firms, particularly new entrants. Access to land remains a pending 
and binding constraint to growth, as are tax ra tes . More generally, administrative procedures and the 
judicial system lack transparency and need to be better managed to avoid corruption, discretion and 
privileges to connected businesses. Corruption i s seen as a growing constraint for a representative panel 
o f businesses interviewed both in 2004 and 2007, and one that disproportionally affects smaller domestic 
firms. A consequence o f a constraining business environment, corruption and poor property rights 
enforcement, i s the uneven playing field in the business place. Competition from the informal sector and 
the dominant position occupied by a few large incumbents hurt the development o f some sectors and the

important constraints to businesses (Figure 8) . 

30 . 
Private sector development w i l l require further financial market reforms and the 
upgrading o f national ICT infrastructure. Morocco has reduced f inanc ia l sector vulnerabilities, 
especially as a result o f the restructuring o f ailing public specialized financial institutions. As concerns 
over stability have eased, policy attention needs to be directed to development o f the core f inanc ia l 
system, in particular to (i) enhance efficiency, competition and competitiveness, and improve access to 
financial services; (ii) promote the nonbank segment o f the financial sector, notably by strengthening the 
role o f capital markets in the economy; and (iii) build institutional capacity to implement and enforce the 
recently enacted legal framework for the financial system. Moreover, private sector would benefit from 
the emergence o f a domestic knowledge economy driven by investments in ICT infrastructure 

3 1 . 
T o achieve its growth potential, Morocco needs to improve the export orientation of its 
economy. 
International experience shows that internal demand alone i s insufficient to sustain high 
growth rates. Over the last two decades, growth has mainly been driven by domestic demand, while the 
contribution o f net exports o f goods and non-factor services has been increasingly negative. Past policies 
and investments have favored the production o f non-traded goods and services with high import inputs 
and geared towards domestic markets - real estate,. telecommunications, retail and wholesale services, 
transport, and financial services. To reap the fu l l benefits o f international interdependence, the trade 
regime needs to redress i t s anti-export bias. So far Morocco has pursued a strategy o f selective market 
opening through bilateral or regional agreements (Euro-Med, US-FTA, Turkey-FTA, GAFTA) aimed at 
taking the opportunities offered by international markets. The EU advanced status consolidates this 
progress, promising further economic integration between Moroccan and the EU and with global markets. 
Internationalization o f Morocco’s economy can benefit from a stronger push towards regional integration. 
As with other countries in the region, Morocco’s main trade relationships are with non-MENA countries. 
The recent progress in opening the economy can leverage the country’s favorable geostrategic positioning 
as a bridge between Europe and Africa. But i t i s losing out due to the limited integration o f trade, 
investments and financial markets at regional level. 
Increased intra-MaghrebMENA integration can 
deliver large potential gains in terms o f growth. Despite good recent progress in merchandise trading, 
integration remains limited in trade in services, banking and key sectors such as energy and transport. 
Required actions include reducing trade barriers, harmonizing the regulatory environment across borders, 
and improving trade logistics. 

3 2 . 

Global integration requires the structural transformation o f lagging sectors. The agriculture 
sector faces the strongest pressures to change. Moroccan agriculture remains one o f the least productive 
in the region, employing almost half o f the labor force but yielding not more than 13% o f GDP. Although 
the share o f the sector to total GDP i s decreasing, its direct and indirect impacts on the economy remain 
substantial, making Mo rocco ’s growth volatile (the 2006 GDP growth o f 7.8% i n 2006 f e l l to 2.7% in 
2007 and then increased to 5.6% in 2008). While needing to further diversify the economy, Morocco 
needs to transform i t s agriculture sec tor .

economy, Morocco needs to engage in second generation I C T reform. Morocco enjoyed a first-mover 
advantage in the Maghreb at the end o f the 1990’s, having engaged early in telecommunications 
liberalization and privatization. This first reform enabled fast growth o f telecommunications services and 
the development o f I T and off-shoring industries. But this advantage has eroded with time and the 
country i s now facing a number o f constraints that are hindering i t s competitiveness: prices are high in 
broad-band and mobile segments, reflecting insufficient competition; I T skills are scarce; and ICT- 
exports have remained below those o f comparator MICs. For the ICT sector to become a driver o f 
growth, modernization and economic and social transformation, Morocco needs to engage in further 
reforms. In particular, competitiveness o f the national I T industry and o f the off-shoring SMEs depends 
on fast and cost-effective broad-band ro l l out, increased competition, and empowered regulation. 

B. 

Reducing Social Disparities 

34 . 
Reducing the relatively high inequality and social disparities characterizing Morocco w i l l 
require equity-enhancing growth and targeted social protection policies. Morocco has relatively high 
inequality by regional standard (Gini index o f 0.407) and one which appears to be increasing over time. 
This i s in contrast with other countries in the region (e+, Tunisia), which have managed to gradually 
reduce the extent o f inequality to a level below that o f Morocco, while starting from higher levels o f 
disparity. One o f government’s objectives i s to ensure a fairer sharing o f the dividends o f growth and 
benefits o f the reforms. As noted above, large groups remain excluded from the recent increase in 
employment, with unemployment rate f o r urban youth and educated youth standing a t 3 1.8 percent and 
18.5 percent respectively. The recent apparent rapid improvement o f some social indicators i s only 
weakly affecting broad nationwide outcomes for the poor. Inclusiveness - reaching marginalized groups 
and promoting equal access to government services and economic opportunities - requires reform o f 
regressive policies, such as those on phasing out energy and food subsidies. Supporting action i s needed 
to strengthen social protection systems and safety nets, which have a potential to reduce most striking 
inequalities. 

3 5 . 
The rura l-urban gap remains large. Today, around 5 5 percent o f the population lives in urban 
centers, compared to 29 percent in 1960. I n 2025 Morocco’s population w i l l reach 3 8 million, o f which 
6 8 percent w i l l be urban. The challenge in this regard consists o f responding to the enormous demand for 
infrastructure and social service provision arising in the urban axis, without leaving the rest o f the country 
behind. S ince 1985 the demographic trend has been associated with a growing gap between urban and 
rural household expenditures, which was partly reversed between 2001 and 2007. Nonetheless, rural 
household expenditures remain on average 3 5 percent lower than urban ones. Cities remain the main 
areas o f economic dynamism, representing 80 percent o f productive activity (industry and services) and 
three out o f four employment opportunities. Access to and quality o f basic social infrastructure and 
services such as roads, health, education, water and sanitation, and electricity in more remote rural areas 
continue to lag behind those in leading urbanized regions. Strong spatial disparities in education and 
health access are associated to pockets o f high poverty. 

3 6 . 
Addressing the lagging condition o f women i s key to improving development outcomes. 
The first challenge i s to reduce maternal mortality, which can be largely prevented or treated if expectant 
mothers received prenatal care at equipped f a c i l i t i e s . Only 4.3 percent o f pregnant women in the poorest 
quintile deliver their babies with the assistance o f a doctor; 70 percent deliver them at home. The second 
challenge i s to increase women literacy over time, by securing equal access to education for girls. The 
gender parity index i n primary education between urban boys and rural girls aged 6- 1 1 has narrowed from 
1 .5 to 1 in the past decade but serious enrollment disparities persist as children proceed through the 
education system (Figure 9). Morocco i s one o f the few countries where the difference in illiteracy rates 
between men and women has increased s ince 1970, rather than experiencing a substantial decrease as in 

12 

other countries. A large majority o f the 2.5 m i l l ion children who do not attend school are ru ra l girls, 
especially in secondary education. Enrollment for ru ra l girls aged 12 to 14 in 2007 was just 15 .6 percent. 
Unemployment already a f f e c t s women more than men, and i s likely to increasingly do so in the future.

3 7 . 
The reduction o f social inequalities revolves around the improvement of the quality and 
coverage of service delivery. Key sectors such as health and education require the implementation o f a 
range o f institutional development measures aimed not only at extending access but also enhancing 
results. These include: (i) introducing greater accountability through improved incentive systems as well 
as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; (ii) pursuing the deconcentration o f the sector in line with the 
overall public administration reform program. Particular attention needs to be provided to 
deconcentrating human resources in order to ensure effective deployment o f health and education 
personnel and increase productivity; and (iii) enhance equitable provision o f health and education 
opportunities to the population by diversifying financing and paying greater attention to the 
implementation o f demand side measures. 

C . 

Ensuring Sustainability 

3 8 . 
The impact o f climate change i s already deeply felt, and vulnerability w i l l increase i n the 
coming decades. The country’s drivers o f vulnerability include i t s large reliance on agriculture as source 
o f income and employment, the scarcity o f effective risk management instruments; limited ability o f 
faster-growing sectors in urban areas to create new jobs and absorb excess rural labor force; and finally, 
the relatively large share in total exports ( 1 5 percent) o f products from irrigated agriculture, which over- 
uses increasingly scarce water resources. High value assets in urban areas and tourism resorts, and 
strategic infrastructure in transport and other sectors are already exposed to natural disaster risks, which 
could be exacerbated by climate change. In the absence o f adaptation, projections for Morocco’s climate 
over the coming decades depict a warmer and drier climate, with precipitation possibly declining 10 
percent by 2030, and twice as much by mid century. Such scenarios could cause declines i n rain-fed 
yields o f up to 10 percent in certain parts o f the country, an increase o f 10 percent or more in the 
probability o f poor harvests, and, in irrigation water, a widening between demand and supply, with 
inflows to reservoirs expected to decline 30 percent more than ra in fa l l . These impacts could materialize 
in the coming two decades, and would likely achieve a much larger scale towards mid-century. In the 
absence o f adaptation measures, declining cerea l yields and shrinking water resources w i l l increase the 
country’s dependence on staple crop imports for food provision (currently close to 50 percent for cereals). 

13 

 
39. 
The current and future challenges o f the water sector will not be met without both 
infrastructure development and institutional reform Morocco faces four challenges: (a) there i s 
already not enough water to meet current needs, and climate change w i l l severely constrain ability to meet 
the expected increase in demand; (b) sector governance and institutions are weak; (c) water use in 
agriculture i s inefficient; and (d) access to water supply and sanitation services i s still inadequate (more 
than 80 percent o f rural households lack individual water supply connections, and only 5 percent o f the 
country’s wastewater i s adequately treated). Because o f these challenges, frequent droughts have a major 
impact on the economy, public spending i s less efficient than i t could be, irrigation water i s frequently 
rationed in public irrigation schemes, and groundwater i s running out. Coping with scarcity w i l l require a 
better balancing o f supply and demand with a view to making water allocation and planning more 
efficient. The country needs better interagency coordination and a reinforcement o f some sector agencies, 
as well as better enforcement o f groundwater and pollution control rules. Public funding needs to be 
aligned with public priorities, through medium-term expenditure frameworks for the sector. 
I n 
agriculture, physical investment coupled with support to farmers can help improve the value that each 
drop o f irrigation water generates, but real progress w i l l depend on broader structural changes in the 
sector. Subsidies for technologies such as micro-irrigation can help soften the blow o f the necessary 
reduction in water use, but only i f groundwater use i s strictly controlled. Similarly, to improve water 
supply and sanitation services, the government w i l l need to invest more in infrastructure and to fund some 
soc ia l transfers, as well as making some institutional reforms. 

40 . 
Sustainable economic performance requires transforming Mo ro c co ’ s energy sector. The 
first challenge in this sense concerns enhancing energy security, and ensure that the needs o f energy 
consumers-- be c i t izens or firms-are met at least cost, without creating a burden for the economy. 
Morocco’s heavy dependency on energy imports (97%) induces energy supply risks and exposure to price 
fluctuations (at $145/barrel in 2008, the total energy b i l l stood at M A D 71 billion). The expected 
quadrupling o f the primary energy demand by 2030 w i l l further aggravate the import dependency. 
Ensuring security o f supply w i l l require a diversification o f an energy mix currently dominated by coa l 
and o i l (87%), a reinforced integration in the Mediterranean electricity market, diversification o f supply 
sources for o i l and other conventional forms o f energy, development o f indigenous energy resources 
(such as solar and wind), and enhanced energy efficiency (which could yield up to 15% o f energy 
savings). To meet these goals Morocco needs an institutional and regulatory framework to create the 
appropriate incentives and a restructuring o f the sector to ensure financial viability o f the operators. 
Secondly, Morocco needs to step up mitigation e f for ts , not only to reduce local C02 emissions and 
participate in the global action to attempt to halt global warming, but also to reap mitigation co-benefits 
and carbon finance revenues. The imperative here i s to shift i t s energy system to a low carbon path. 

4 1 . 

Mo ro c co ’ s energy risks can be better managed through c loser regional integration. The 
energy situation in the Maghreb countries i s diverse (with Algeria and Libya being major hydrocarbon 
exporters while Tunisia and Mo rocco are import dependent). However, a l l countries in the region face 
common challenges in terms o f growing domestic energy consumption as well as increasing demand for 
green electricity both at home and across the Mediterranean. Morocco has a stake in working with its 
regional partners to enhance security o f supply in a context o f environmental protection and globalization 
o f energy markets. 

IV . GOVERNMENT PROGRAM 

A. 

National Vision 

4 2 . 
Since the start o f the decade, M o r o c c o has pursued a renewed national development vision. 
This vision underpins an ongoing process o f strategic reform whose main elements can be broken down 
according to international, political, social and economic objectives. The international dimension i s one 

14 

o f increased and progressive integration in regional, European, and global markets, and o f a strategic 
partnership with the EU. Politically, the emphasis l i e s on respect for human rights, the fight against 
corruption, consolidation o f electoral democracy and acceleration o f the decentralization agenda. 
Economically, the vision aims to achieve strong, employment-creating growth through economic opening 
and liberalization, support to private sector development and foreign direct investment, major 
infrastructure works and selective sector priorities. In the area o f social development, i t aims to enhance 
the performance o f the education sector, reduce the incidence o f poverty and o f rural-urban disparities, 
and improve the condition o f women. 

43. 
Over that decade, successive governments have led a process o f legal, policy and 
institutional modernization, positioning the country over time as one of the leading reformers in the 
M E N A region. They have successfully managed f isca l consolidation, stabilized the economy, created an 
environment for sustained growth, reformed the financial sector, and enacted a number o f critical legal 
changes. They have created new governance institutions, signed trade agreements with key partners, and 
re-shaped government programs and budget allocations to better target key social and structural 
challenges. The reform o f the Family Code (Moudawana) in 2004, the launch o f the National Initiative 
for Human Development in 2005, and the establishment o f the Conse i l Supe‘rieur de 1 ‘Educa t ion in 2006 
are important landmarks o f social change. Morocco’s 2008 signature o f the EU Advanced Status 
Agreement, represents both a strong signal o f sustained political and legal reform and an act o f 
international recognition for the reform process. 

B. 

Regional and G loba l Space 

4 4 . 

Advancing integration w ith regional and global trade partners has been an objective for 
decades in Morocco. Since the early 1990s , Morocco sought to deepen i t s economic integration at 
regional and global levels through trade agreements. To this end, it pursued deeper preferential 
integration with external actors through signing an Association Agreement with the European Union 
effective in 2000, a Free Trade Agreement with the USA in 2004, as well as other preferential agreements 
with a number o f regional partners. 

4 5 . 
I n October 2008, Morocco signed an “Advanced Status” agreement w ith the European 
Union, which sets the stage for deeper strategic and economic orientation towards the EU. The 
agreement defines new ambitions for the relationship and deepens the previous Association Agreement. 
I t w i l l frame the EU’s future as a development partner in Morocco. I t opens participation in several 
European agencies, reinforces Morocco’s position within the EU’s neighborhood policy, and w i l l likely 
increase the level o f E U assistance. Over time, i t i s expected to lead to convergence o f legislation and 
regulations w i th the EU’s in selected sectors, at a pace and sequence which remains to be defined. I t 
could open the way for a long term alignment with the Acquis Communau ta ire , the joint legislative body 
o f the EU. 

15 

16 

C . 

Sector Strategies 

4 6 . 
The new government appointed in 2007 elaborated a national program, centered on 
enhancing growth and competitiveness and improving social outcomes. I t launched its Soc ia l and 
Economic Development Program for the period 2008-2012. The j r s t ob jec t ive o f the program i s to 
improve soc ia l outcomes, particularly in education, health, access to services including housing, and in 
due course to establish targeted safety ne ts mechanisms as a substitute for ineffective subsidies. The 
second ob jec t ive i s to enhance growth, export potential, and investment in the country by focusing 
simultaneously on key productive sectors (industrial emergence, agricultural and fisheries development), 
on infrastructure sectors contribution to growth (energy, transport, water) and on cross-cutting enablers 
(export strategy, ICT strategy, and business environment). The third ob jec t ive i s to implement cross- 
cutting reforms needed to deliver results i n a l l sectors: (1) improving governance; (2) reforming public 
administration; and (3) deepening decentralization and deconcentration, for better service delivery. 
Within these broad objectives, the program identified six priority sectors: health, education, justice, 
water, energy, and agriculture. I t also increased the budget allocation o f these sectors, within a multi-year 
framework.

4 7 . 
As a first step, key ministries produced comprehensive new sector strategies. These respond 
to the overall national vision, target known development challenges, and se t measurable stretch targets. 
They are well grounded by diagnostics, having made use o f an abundant stock o f knowledge resources. 
They formulate short and medium-term action plans, capable o f driving both policy changes and 
implementation steps, within a time horizon o f 2012 or beyond. Some are supported by newly-created 
agencies (Plan Maroc Vert and Emergence) to improve implementation effectiveness. Others rely on the 
establishment o f inter-ministerial structures to coordinate transversal issues, such as the ICT (Nume r ic 
2023) or energy strategies. Many are supported by dedicated infrastructure investments and have 
benefited from targeted budget increases in 2008 and 2009. Table 6 summarizes ten sector strategies 
produced since 2007. While i t i s too early to evaluate the results o f most o f them, some o f the older 
sector strategies such as Emergence (industry) have had early successes in attracting key international 

18 

investors, for example in the automobile, offshoring and aeronautic sectors, or in the tourism sector in the 
case o f the Plan Azur. 

D. 

Cross-Cutting Changes 

4 8 . 
Beyond the elaboration o f sector strategies, the program has focused on selected areas that 
impact future development outcomes. These include: (i) experimenting with a new comprehensive 
approach to social safety nets; ( i i ) deepening the focus on governance issues; ( i i i ) improving local 
government autonomy; and (iv) continuing support for public administration reform. 

49. 
Government i s testing a new approach to safety nets designed to better target the needs o f 
the poor and the vulnerable. The INDH program introduced in 2005.the first large-scale poverty- 
targeted interventions by selecting the poorest 264 urban neighborhoods and 403 rural communes. I t 
remains the key vehicle o f targeted poverty interventions, and has contributed to changing the policy 
direction on safety nets. The current approach i s pragmatic. I t pilots ways to introduce new social sa fe ty 
nets, while developing and improving their targeting and effectiveness through evaluation. Examples 
include: ( 1) implementation o f a conditional cash transfer pilot in education, aiming at increasing school 
retention rates (the Tayssir program); (2) pilot introduction o f a medical insurance scheme for the poor 
(RAMED), which i s now in the process o f being scaled-up; (3) improved geographical targeting o f food 
subsidies (tender wheat flour); (4) implementation o f a low-income housing construction program; and 
( 5 ) improving institutional capacity to target policies and subsidies. I n addition, increases in minimum 
wage have been enacted, as well as an increase in children allowances and extension o f their coverage to 
workers o f the agricultural sector. A comprehensive review o f social protection i s also under way at the 
same time as a review o f food and energy subsidies. 

50. 
The governance program builds on previous initiatives. During the past decade, successive 
governments have launched a series o f governance programs. These include the 1995 national program 
for good governance, the 1998 “Pacte de Bonne Gouvernance (PBG)” and the 2000 white paper on public 
administration reform. The PBG had three main objectives: (i) ethics and moralization o f public 
administration; (ii) efficiency and efficacy o f public administration; and ( i i i ) strengthening the capacity 
for coordination and promoting transparency in public affairs. The goal o f these efforts was to transform 
public administration into an effective and efficient institution able to deliver better services to citizens 
and be a driver for private sector development. A number o f specific governance and anticorruption 
measures were taken and new institutions created. The current Government has outlined a governance 
agenda around four pillars: (i) transparency and values in public l i f e and public policy; ( i i ) efficacy of 
public action; ( i i i ) completion o f initiatives to strengthen the capacity o f key Institutions; and (iv) 
improvement o f territorial governance. 

5 1 . 
The program aims to increase the r o l e o f local government, its performance, accountability, 
and empowerment. Since K ing Mohammed V I ’S Royal Address o f 12 December 2006 (reinforced on 
November 2008) the strengthening o f local governments has become central to the government’s agenda. 

Among those: (a) the 2007 Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crime Act, and the establishment o f a Financial 
Investigation Unit (F IU) i n the Office o f the Prime Minister; (b) the 1998 procurement decree which led to significant alignment 
w i th international best practices (its amendment in 2007 has deepened the reform, although additional amendments are yet 
needed to assure equivalence to best international practices); (c) a law requiring certain categories o f c i v i l servants and public 
officials to disclose their incomes and assets; (d) the creation in 2007 o f an agency for the Prevention o f Corruption (Instance 
Centrale de Prevention de l a Corruption); (e) the establishment i n 2005 o f a new legislative framework for po l i t ica l parties which 
has streamlined the r u l e s on the creation o f po l i t ica l parties; (0 substantial improvements made to the legislative framework i n 
the area o f freedom o f association and assembly that have led to the emergence o f a more active and dynamic c i v i l society; and 
(8) the liberalization o f the audio-visual sector w i th the issuance o f licenses to private operators for radio and TV broadcasting. 

19 

Enabling the empowerment o f the communes represents a strategic change. The 2003 Charte Communale 
was further amended in December 2008 to transfer a range o f management responsibilities to the 
communes. Strategy formulation at the municipal level has been piloted in Settat and E l Jadida. A recent 
initiative provides incentives for communes to develop a Communal Development Plan, to increase 
participatory strategic planning at the local level. Government now intends to accelerate the 
implementation pace o f i t s decentralization program through real decision-making and resource transfers 
to l o c a l governments, together with adequate deconcentration o f public administration o f f ic ia ls . A public 
dialogue started with the establishment o f a consultative commission which was tasked to develop a 
concept fo r regionalization. Two pilot regional spatial development plans ( for the Tadla-Azilal and 
Meknbs-Tafilalet regions), 16 regional agricultural plans identifying a series o f investments in agricultural 
development, and two pilot regional development strategies (for the Fbs-Boulmane and the Souss-Massa 
regions) have recently been adopted by the regional councils. 

5 2 . 
Government intends to continue the process o f public administration reform. The agenda 
seeks to: (i) develop a new results-oriented budget system with public policy evaluation mechanisms; ( i i ) 
renew efforts to improve public sector governance through enhanced internal and external controls, 
auditing, more transparent budget reporting and simplified procedures; (iii) improve the human resource 
management framework; (iv) improve the quality o f public services by introducing localized 
management, further pursuing the deconcentration process; and (v) simplify administrative procedures 
through the development o f e-government so as to improve public services and ensuring the integrity and 
transparency o f relations between the administration and the user. 

E. 

Implementation Challenges 

5 3 . 
Strategy 
implementation challenges are well recognized. 
The 2006 Rapport du 
Cinquantenaire noted that the “reform process demonstrates a level o f dynamism that needs t o be 
preserved and strengthened”. Consolidating i t [...I requires a clear view o f the risks that may 
compromise its success, such as the lack o f synchronization or coherence o f the overall reform process; 
the incapacity to reach adequate impetus, the risk o f a partial accomplishment o f expected objectives; the 
non-effectiveness o f new laws, which could compromise both the success o f the reforms as well as the 
country’s democratic future”. Meeting this challenge requires: 
Mov ing from the “what” to the “how to” o f reforms, w ith an increased need f o r coherence 
and coordination. To reach its ambitious results, the set o f sector strategies developed w i l l 
require structural, cross-cutting actions, likely falling outside the remit o f any single agency, such 
as fostering public ownership, exercising leadership over major trade-offs, and arbitrating 
allocation o f scarce resources. 

0 

0 A clear focus on results, supported by a government-wide emphasis on monitoring and 
evaluation. Today not enough i s known about the impact o f social programs or existing sector 
strategies, or the nature o f their incidence on beneficiaries. Focusing on results requires a cultural 
move from measuring inputs to assessing and managing for results. The new sector strategies’ 
selection o f measurable targets combined with the on-going public administration reform creates 
an opportunity for substantial improvements in the area o f result tracking. 

0 Reduced distance between citizens and the administration. As noted in the Rapport du 
Cinquantenaire, decentralization has been on the agenda fo r decades. Getting better results for 
public engagement w i l l require deconcentrating key ministerial agencies, delegating authority 
further, pairing the devolution o f f inanc ia l resources with a parallel trans fer o f authority, 
enhancing the role o f regional, spatial and urban planning, as well as empowering users to play an 
active role in accountability mechanisms. 

20 

Human resources. The quality, allocation and management o f human resources could constrain 
strategy implementation in a number o f sectors, particularly education, health and justice. 
Regionalization similarly faces l o c a l capacity gaps, notably within local elected bodies, which in 
turn may provide arguments for retaining control over decisions and resources centrally. 
Addressing on-the-job training needs, building capacity, and enhancing both deployment, 
recruitment and resource managements functions w i l l be essential. 

5 4 . W i th clear objectives defined, an ambitious set o f well-articulated sector strategies covering 
the next five years, widespread understanding o f cross-cutting constraints, and the experience o f having 
managed successfully a first wave o f reform, the country has an opportunity to face up to its 
implementation challenges and take a transforming step into its future. 

V. W O R L D B A N K GROUP STRATEGY 

A. 

Experience and Lessons Learned 

5 5 . 
Morocco made impressive progress in a number o f the pr ior ity areas supported by the 
2005-2009 CAS. These included maintaining macro-stability, increasing efficiency o f the financial 
sector, improving access to finance, and improving water management and access to water and sanitation. 
Progress was also made on access to basic education as measured by enrollment rates, efficiency o f public 
administration, access to all-weather roads in rural areas, improved housing options for the poor, and to a 
lesser degree on improving the investment climate. Some new areas o f activity were introduced during 
CAS implementation, such as energy sector, solid waste, and support for the national human development 
initiative. A t the same time, some areas in which outcomes were initially targeted did not advance as 
anticipated, such as activities in higher education and agro-business development. Table 7 summarizes 
the CAS Completion Report’s (CASCR) findings on development outcomes. 

56 . 

The CASCR finds that the four CAS pillars remained valid throughout the period. I t notes 
that opportunities arose during implementation to advance CAS objectives through new activities, and 
that the Bank Group appropriately adapted to respond to these opportunities. O f the 10 IBRD lending 
operations delivered during the period, five were not foreseen when the CAS was discussed by Executive 
Directors. The IFC program changed radically from one centered on providing advisory services to one 
that included significant equity and debt investments (see Table 8). 

The Bank delivered ten lending operations for a total o f $1 .127 b i l l ion , an average o f $280 m i l l ion per year. This comprised 
six DPLs and four investment projects, w i th the DPL proportion representing two thirds o f the value o f new commitments.

I F C played an important role during the CAS period through a record investment 
program, sizeable advisory activities and i t s entry into local capital markets. From an investment 
role previously limited due to the availability o f alternative sources o f financing, IFC has now stepped up 
its activities and positioned itself as a strategic partner with added value in both i t s investment and 
advisory services. During the CAS period, IFC’s investment increased substantially to reach $272.5 
million from $4 million, mostly aligned with CAS P i l la r 1 (improve competitiveness and the investment 
climate)’.

The principal lessons from the CASCR that can guide future Bank engagement are: 
The engagement strategy i n general, and the results matrix in particular, should have the 
flexibility to accommodate inevitable uncertainties over a four year period, specifically to 
introduce new activities to respond to shifts in country circumstances and government requests, 
and to do less o f or discontinue activities that may become relatively l e s s important or l e s s likely 
to advance. 
Strategic objectives supported by the Bank should have broad national support and, while 
selectively engaging with the authorities to analyze and advance often unclear reform choices and 

7 

For instance, in FY08 and FY09, IFC committed a record US$255 million in seven projects in multiple sectors, such as 
commercial banks, microfinance, wastewater public utilities, investment funds for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), 
property development in low income housing and building materials sector. 

22 

helping to build consensus, to avoid long-term commitments until a judgment can be made as to 
likelihood o f success and comparative advantage. 
Individual programming decisions need sufficient flexibility to respond to the outcome o f 
dialogue and changed global, regional or national circumstances. 
The importance o f building on the progress achieved in allowing IBRD and IFC to work together 
as a Bank Group. 
Continue coordinated work with development partners, including on joint forward planning.

provide depth o f exchanges on sector specific themes. These meetings were characterized by free and 
open dialogue and were a rich experience, quite unique fo r the Middle East and North African region. 
The key messages include: 
Widespread doubts about the real outcomes o f the reform process, with questions as to i t s 
credibility leading to perceptions o f ‘reform fatigue’ by external audiences; 
Specific need for results in education; 
Cross-cutting c a l l s for justice sector reform;

with pragmatic reminders o f the difficulty o f finding entry points for change; 
Concrete encouragement to the Bank to: (1) use i t s voice more; (2) evaluate more systematically; 
(3) help the government build an accountability culture;

The Wo r ld Bank Group Program 2009-2013 

60. 
The objective o f the W B G action in Morocco over the next four years i s to support 
government in the implementation o f its reform program. As discussed above, the government’s 
program i s subject to implementation challenges typical o f second generation reforms. This i s the area 
where the Bank has been specifically asked to help. Firstly, the WBG w i l l focus on “ the how to” o f 
implementation by facilitating institutional reform and coordination - an area in which Bank’s DPLs have 
gained a solid reputation with the client. Secondly, the WBG w i l l seek to maintain its ro le o f aggregator 
and facilitator o f inter-agency coordination by supporting reform implementation in cross-sectoral areas, 
through both S I L s and DPLs. Finally, CPS activities w i l l seek to pay particular attention to increasing the 
results orientation o f the government’s programs, in line with the findings o f the CASCR and in response 
to a specific request o f government. 

6 1 . 
The CPS ensures continuity i n the WBG’s support to Morocco, as well as opportunities for 
scaling up and expanding engagement to new areas. In addition to consolidating the 2005-2009 CAS 
Strategic Objectives (Figure 1 l), the CPS builds on the lessons learned from the previous CAS such as 
the need to ensure selectivity in Bank Group engagement, to focus on activities where the World Bank 
Group can bring value added, and to respond to client’s demand. 

62. 
The CPS provides a framework which w i l l insure continuity i n collaboration and enhance 
complementarity between I F C and IBRD. Building on the close collaboration which characterize the 
preparation o f the CPS, the IFC and IBRD w i l l jointly support government in i t s private sector 
development policies, specifically in the areas o f business environment, trade, competitiveness, financial 

24 

sector development and public-private partnership. Appendix 2 provides greater details on the WBG’s 
private sector approach in the context o f the CPS.

Program Areas in which dialogue and programming are still evolving are presented more briefly, and 
their related CPS Outcomes w i l l be firmed up at CPS mid-term. This provides a medium term business 
plan (24 months) o f firmly developed activities, and a four year framework for program areas where 
engagement w i l l be defined. Table 9 presents a breakdown o f program areas by level o f dialogue. 
Additionally, two crosscutting beams, Governance and Territoriality, aim to influence the overall WBG 
program through a diversity o f operational entry points. “Territoriality” i s a term which i s understood in 
Morocco as shorthand for deconcentration, decentralization, regionalization, and spatially-aware 
development programs. 

64. 

I F C w i l l focus on financial and infrastructure sectors, as well as on high value-added 
investments i n manufacturing, social sectors (health and education) and agribusiness, while 
retaining flexibility to adapt to opportunities and changes. IFC’s potential investments in energy, 

utilities or ports as well as select investments in Emergence’s sectors, would contribute to Pillar 1 o f the 
CPS (growth, competitiveness and employment). Potential investments in the banking sector, 
microfinance and the education sectors would help improve financial and educational services to citizens 
(Pillar 2). Finally, the focus on potential investments in renewable energy w i l l contribute to Morocco’s 
sustainable development objectives (Pillar 3). 
IFC w i l l also continue to deliver its on-going advisory 
program, in support o f business environment and financial sector reform. I t w i l l retain flexibility to adapt 
to change and to respond to new opportunities, as a fbnction o f evolving market conditions and pace o f 
sector reform.

6 5 . 
The structural transformation o f the Moroccan economy requires a comprehensive and 
coordinated set o f policies in many areas. These include a stable macroeconomic environment; an 

improved business environment-including 
in the area o f infrastructure and in regulatory institutions 
that level the playing field; a trade policy that supports the competitiveness o f Moroccan products; a 
financial sector that better serves smaller firms; a labor force that i s better trained and effective soc ia l 
protection and labor market institutions. W h i l e progress has been made in a l l these areas, there i s a strong 
need to increase the impact o f reforms and the private sector response. Activities under the first CPS 
pillar aim to support government’s objective to enhance Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. 
Under this pillar, government has invited the Bank Group to center its program on the seven Program 
Areas presented below, o f which the first three are already fully defined, while the remaining five are 
under preparation. 

Defined Program Areas within Pillar 1 
Program Area 1.1: Business Environment 
Government Goal: Improve the business environment for a l l firms, especially for SMEs, v i a a 
comprehensive investment climate reform strategy supported by an e f f e c t i v e reform implementation and 
coordination process. 

CPS Outcomes 

1 : Streamlined regulatory environment and a more equitable enforcement o f rules, particularly for new 
entrants and SMEs 
2: More e f fec t ive reform coordination and implementation in the business environment area. 

66. 

Mo ro c co ’ s business environment requires more favorable conditions for new entrants, i n 
part icu lar fo r small and medium-sized domestic firms. Government’s support to private sector 

development focuses on: 
( i ) reducing the current unpredictability and opaqueness o f the legal, 
administrative and judicial aspects o f the country’s business environment, which tend to favor well- 

26 

established investors; (ii) promoting transparency and accessibility o f laws, regulations, circulars, and 
procedures. 

6 7 . 

Support to government’s program w i l l focus on regulatory reform and institutional 

coordination. First, the WBG w i l l facilitate the development o f a simplified regulatory environment and 
more equitable enforcement o f rules. This w i l l be achieved via technical assistance activities in the areas 
o f (i) regulatory streamlining and improved measurement and benchmarking o f the implementation o f 
the regulatory framework; (ii) improving the legal framework for corporate governance and minority 
shareholder protection, and enhancing transparency o f r u l e s and regulations; and (iii) business entry 
simplification at one-stop-shops. Second, the WBG w i l l contribute to more effective reform coordination 
and implementation in the business environment area. Bank assistance w i l l focus on: (a) helping 
government in institutionalizing the new National Commission fo r Investment Climate Reforms (NCICR) 
as an organized, effective and participatory reform platform; and (b) developing consultation 
mechanisms, economic impact analysis and monitoring and evaluation tools fo r preparing projects and 
measuring progress o f investment climate reforms. Support w i l l involve technical assistance to the 
NCICR, and could possibly involve a lending operation with an investment climate pillar. 

6 8 . 

IFC’s Advisory Se rv ices in M E N A w i l l continue to support business environment 

reforms, in close coordination w ith IBRD. The IFC w i l l focus on areas that require f i e l d expertise in 
regulatory reform and process reengineering for regulatory simplification. I t w i l l further support the 
development o f alternative dispute resolutions systems, starting with capacity building o f a mediation and 
arbitration center in Casablanca. IFC’s support w i l l be selective, reflecting availability o f donor financing 
and additionality. 

P rog ram A rea 1 .2 : F inanc ia l Sector Reform 
Government Goa l : Improve access to finance by households and SMEs while promoting financial stability 
and cap i ta l market development through enhanced competition and risk management. 

CPS Outcomes 

1 : A restructured financial sector allowing for sustainable expansion o f access to finance by households 
2: Established credit infrastructure conducive to SME finance 
3 : Better financial risks identification through the introduction o f independent supervisors 
4 : Improved liquidity o f the benchmark y ie ld curve to foster capital market development. 

6 9 . 
Morocco’s financial sector experienced rap id growth i n the second ha l f o f the 2000s 
following a ma jor reform o f the banking sector. Despite progress, important gaps remain. Access 

greatly improved (43 percent o f Moroccans had bank or postal accounts in 2 0 0 8 , an increase of 9 percent 
points since 2005), but remains insufficient. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) played a key role in 
providing access to over a million poor people, but their fast growth (four fold in terms o f credit and 
doubling in terms o f customers in 2 0 0 5 - 2 0 0 7 ) stopped in 2008 when their credit portfolio started 
deteriorating. The entry o f a few large banks on the SME market improved overall access (credit to SME 
increased 40 percent in 2 0 0 5 - 2 0 0 8 and now represents a f i f th o f banks’ loan portfolios), but key segments 
remain underserved such as those concerning small enterprises and long term finance, and a more difficult 
economic environment may jeopardize recent achievements. Furthermore, despite successful efforts to 
strengthen the soundness o f systemic institutions, recent growth has generated new financial stability 
issues (e.g. asset and liability management, exposures to the real estate sector, linkages within the 
financial system). Finally, the potential for growth o f some activities such as long term market finance 
has not yet materialized. 

7 0 . 
The authorities have requested a second Financial Sector DPL to support second generation 
reforms. The ir four p i l lar program aims at increasing both breadth and depth, while enhancing 

27 

financial stability. Government’s first objective i s to foster access to finance for households. In this area, 
the Bank w i l l accompany the government’s actions to enhance the viability o f the Microfinance sector - 
building on IFC’s strong program in the sector and the set up o f a postal bank. The second objective i s to 
strengthen access to finance for SMEs. He re , the Bank group w i l l contribute to the establishment o f a 
strong credit infrastructure (modern credit bureau industry and partial credit guarantee scheme). The third 
objective i s to further strengthen financial stability and ensure that financial sector development can be 
sustained. To this effect, and building on the existing framework, the Bank w i l l assist the authorities in 
the preparation o f new tools to monitor risks and ensure that supervisors have adequate independence to 
take action where necessary. The fourth objective i s to foster capital market development. In this area, 
Bank support w i l l be geared towards improving the liquidity o f the benchmark yield curve, which w i l l 
help harness institutional investors’ potential. 

71 . 
I F C w i l l continue to support government’s goal in the financial sector via its advisory 
services as well as through strategic investments i n financial institutions, including microfinance 
institutions and possibly SME finance instruments. On the investment side, IFC w i l l continue to look 

fo r opportunities to invest i n financial institutions that aim at developing low income banking and to 
support the emergence o f some banks as regional players. In terms o f advisory activities, technical 
support to strengthen the credit information infrastructure w i l l continue to be provided to the central bank 
and possibly to specific banks. Other potential advisory activities include capacity building to financial 
institutions in risk management, modern SME lending techniques and credit scoring. 

P r o g r am A r e a I , 3 Skills and Employment 
Government Goal: Achieve a better match between supply and demand o f labor market skills through 
improved access to and quality o f higher education and vocational education and training (VET) system, 
better labor market information systems and extended ac t ive labor market programs. 
CPS Outcomes 
1 : Better match between labor market needs and higher education and vocational education /training 
(VET) schemes 
2: M&E system o f labor market policies and programs established 
3 : Introduction o f income protection mechanisms to improve labor mobility 

7 2 . 
Mo ro c co ’ s labor market i s characterized on the one side by high unemployment among 
higher education and VET graduates and on the other by s k i l l s shortages in strategic sectors. The 

skills mismatch i s due to rigid hiring and firing procedures, high severance payments, and highly taxed 
wages, as well as the large proportion o f the labor force which i s poorly educated and employed in low- 

paid jobs. 

7 3 . 
The Wo r ld Bank Group aims to help government address these challenges through a multi- 
sector operation supporting policy reforms in the areas o f higher education, vocational training, 
and social protection. 
I F C could play an complementary investment ro l e . I This operation w i l l 

include: (i) supporting reforms for improved relevance o f higher education and possibly vocational 
education and training to labor market needs; (ii) strengthening labor market M&E systems and 
institutions; and (iii) facilitating labor mobility through improved regulations and income protection 
mechanisms. Because labor market information i s poor and inadequate to inform policies, an AAA 
program i s also envisaged to complement existing analyses. Subject to the adoption o f an appropriate 
legal framework increasing the creation o f private universities offering accredited diplomas, IFC would 
consider potential investments in the education sector. 

28 

Program Areas under development within Pillar 1 

Program Area 1 .4 : Urban Development 

7 4 . 
I n light of Morocco ’s continued and rapid urbanization, government aims to improve the 
capacity of cities to respond strategically to challenges, in order f o r them to withstand the pressures 
they will increasingly face. Government has requested the Bank to consider possible support to manage 
the urbanization process through actions aimed at: (i) improving the coherence o f municipal projects with 
the national land use planning strategy, and the development o f long-term integrated urban area projects; 
( i i ) fostering the effective application o f unified management systems, the establishment o f contractual 
agreements and pooling o f resources for implementation o f city projects as well as the rapid adoption o f 
the new Urban Development Code; (iii) building awareness among the elected representatives as regards 
land-related issues,, the modernization o f the territorial c iv i l service, management and training o f human 
resources and the more systematic involvement o f c iv i l society in development plans; and (iv) supporting 
the mobilization o f loca l resources, the identification o f new revenue streams, and an investigation o f the 
potential for loans as part o f the overall financing o f urban needs. Finally, the Bank through i t s recently 
launched Marseille Center for Mediterranean Integration, w i l l provide TA under the theme “Strategic 
Urban Development” focusing on: (a) regional and urban planning; (b) urban land management; (c) urban 
expansion and renewal. 

Program Area 1 .5 : Information and Communication Technology 

7 5 . 
Government i s planning second generation reforms to restore Mo rocco ’s lead in IC T . 
Despite the success o f the first round o f reforms, significant challenges remain. First, prices in both the 
broadband and mobile sectors remain high, limiting access. Second, ICT-based exports remain well 
below those o f comparator MICs. Third, Morocco’s immature broadband infrastructure hampers the 
development o f domestic software and I T industries. Fourth, Morocco faces an undersupply o f trained I T 
workforce. Support to government’s reforms would aim at enhancing ICT competitiveness. Engagement 
would take place along two main axes: (i) supporting a new phase o f telecommunications and broadband 
reform; (ii) enhancing the emergence o f a business process outsourcing - I T enabled services (BPO/ITES) 
industry through skills development. Under the first axis the main objectives would be to increase 
competition and foster market structure reform through regulatory and institutional reform. To reduce the 
skills shortage, the Bank would provide support to the development o f an adequate Curriculum for I T 
Skills to accompany the launch o f training courses that match industry needs. The instruments discussed 
with government include: a program o f technical assistance in the areas o f e-government and I T 
development and continued policy dialogue on telecommunications reform. A new DPL operation could 
potentially emerge from this process. The skills development component would be integrated in the new 
education and skills development projects. 

Program Area 1.6: Justice Sector reform 

76 . 
Justice sector reform i s at the center o f government’s agenda and among the top priorities 
fo r the current legislature M a j o r issues include: (i) poor quality and lack o f transparency o f judicial 
decisions; (ii) lack o f qualifications and specialization o f magistrates and auxiliaries o f justice; (iii) long 
delays in case management and unreliable enforcement o f court decisions; (iv) uneven access to justice 
and to legal and judicial information; and (v) weak budget and human resources management capacity at 
the ministry and court levels. A strategy fo r the reform o f the justice system has not been finalized but i t 
i s expected to materialize in the coming months. Government has requested Bank support in supporting 
the reform o f the justice system to improve service delivery to citizens. The Bank i s ready to support 
government e f fo r ts starting with the finalization o f the strategy through tailored A A A such as topic- 
specific advisory services, quality o f service delivery surveys, and sharing o f international best practice. 

2 9 

Once in place, the strategic framework could be supported by a sector DPL to accompany reform 
implementation. The IFC w i l l maintain and strengthen its advisory activities supporting the Ministry o f 
Justice in the area o f alternative dispute resolution. 

P rog ram A rea 1 .7 : T rade and competitiveness 

7 7 . 
Government’s trade policy aims to boost growth and job creation by expanding markets for 
Moroccan goods and services and transform Morocco into an investment and production platform 
fo r global investors. However, current efforts have not yet led to robust export performance nor 
accelerated significantly the structural transformation o f the economy. Furthermore, the preferential 
stance in trade liberalization i s increasing ta r i f f dispersion leading to trade diversion and providing 
incentives for fraud. To address these challenges, Morocco i s reducing trade and investment barriers and 
i s pursuing deeper preferential integration. WBG support would focus on six areas: ( i ) fac i l i ta te tariff and 
non-tariff reforms on an M FN basis; (ii) facilitate further investment climate reforms to enhance the 
capacity o f SME to exploit opportunities offered by the global market; ( i i i ) encourage a further reduction 
o f barriers to trade and investment in services and regulatory convergence with the EU in selected areas 
o f Morocco’s interest; ( iv ) support export promotion and (v) enhance the modernization o f Morocco’s 
innovation system; (v i ) improve the performance o f trade logistics. Support could be extended through 
two main instruments: (a) a Competitiveness DPL with a substantive trade and integration component; (b) 
continued TA to improve technical capacity and the development o f new tools to monitor the trade strategy. T h e 
Bank w i l l continue technical support in the areas o f trade logistics and trade in agriculture. IFC w i l l consider 
potential investments in ports activity or logistical platforms in Morocco with a view to improving the trade 
logistics infrastructure and w i l l complement IBRD activities through i t s advisory support in the business 
environment area. 

7 8 . 
The IFC w i l l continue to focus on developing investment and lending opportunities in 
support o f the new industrial and agriculture strategies o f M o r o c c o . Morocco’s industrial and 
agricultural strategies aim at anchoring the country’s strategy to supporting the emergence o f world-class 
firms in a se lec t number o f sectors where Morocco’s comparative advantages are deemed substantial: (i) 
agribusiness; (ii) light automotive and aerospace manufacturing; (iii) fisheries; (iv) business process 
outsourcing; (v) electronics; and (vi) industrial “handicrafts”. Modernization o f these industries to 
become internationally competitive could offer investment opportunities for IFC. 

PILLAR 2: SERVICE DELIVERY TO CITIZENS 

7 9 . 
Reducing social disparities and closing the gap between e f fo r t s and results requires a closer 
attention to the effectiveness of the public administration and the outcomes of public policies and 
investments. Activities under the second CPS pillar aim to support the government’s objective to 
enhance access to and quality o f service delivery for a l l citizens. Under this pillar, the Government has 
invited the Bank Group to center i t s program on the eight Program Areas presented below, o f which the 
first seven are already fully defined, while the remaining one i s s t i l l under preparation. 
P rog ram A rea 2 .1 : Pub l ic Sector Managemen t 

Government Goals: Develop an efficient administration capable to contribute to enhancing the 
competitiveness o f the national economy and the sustainable development o f the country while promoting 
investment through the new sectoral strategies and ensuring the medium-term viability o f the 
macroeconomic framework. 
CPS Outcomes 
1 : Multiannual budgetary planning integrated with the process o f preparation o f the Budget Law; 
2: Key HR policies ready to be adopted : e.g. new standard job classification; 
3 : The wage b i l l i s i n line with the government medium term target o f 10 percent o f GDP; 
4: E-government i s introduced to simplify PA procedures including for service delivery. 

3 0 

80 . 
Increasing the efficiency o f the public sector i s crucial to the successful implementation o f 
the economic and social reforms needed to improve economic performance and achieve sustained 

growth. The government i s engaged in an ambitious Public Administration Reform (PAR) program since 
2002. The reform aims at ensuring the viability o f the macroeconomic framework by improving the 
efficiency o f public expenditure and the optimal allocation o f budgetary resources. Support to PAR 
remains a key element o f the Bank- government partnership. The Bank has engaged in PAR since its 
launch, jointly with the EU and the AFDB. I n the future, support to government w i l l firstly focus on the 
implementation o f a new results-oriented budget system which includes public policy evaluation 
mechanisms fo r enhanced service delivery. Second, the Bank w i l l support activities that w i l l facilitate the 
adoption o f new HR policies to improve HR management by: (i) simplifying c iv i l service employment 
regulations; (ii) adopting an efficient and transparent remuneration system and ( i i i ) introducing promotion 
mechanisms based on merit, competence and probity. Third, the Bank w i l l help improve public wage b i l l 
management in key ministries so as to maintain the current Government medium term target o f a wage 
b i l l at 10 percent o f GDP. Finally, the Bank w i l l support the on-going introduction o f e-government to 
simplify administrative procedures and to improve public service delivery thus contributing inter a l ia to 
the integrity and transparency o f relations between the administration and users. Bank support w i l l 
involve a mix o f advisory and lending services centered on the new Public Administration Reform Loan 
(the fourth phase o f the Bank's DPL support to Morocco's public administration reform program- PARL 
W ) , as well as Programmatic ESWs. 

8 1 . 

Looking forward, a th ird ser ies o f interventions i s envisaged to support further the next 

phases o f reform. The Program Administration Reform agenda w i l l evolve on several dimensions, such 
as: ( i ) finalization o f the draft Organic Budget Law (OBL); and .(ii) completion o f the deconcentration 
strategy and conclusion o f preparatory work and subsequent implementation o f the current phase o f the 
HR reform. The Bank i s prepared to design a new series o f lending operations to support the next 
Program Administration Reform phase and further strengthen the results orientation o f the program for 
enhanced service delivery. I n addition, the new series would further reinforce donor harmonization as i t 
w i l l be developed in fu l l coordination with the next EU and A fDB program. 

'rogram Area 2.2: Quality and Access in Education 
Government Goa l: Achieve universal compulsory basic education by 20 15 , promote initiative and 
excellence in upper secondary and higher education and improve system performance (teaching, 
management and stewardship). 

CPS Outcomes 

1 : Increased net enrollment rates for primary and lower secondary education; 
2: Reduced repetition rates for primary and lower secondary education; 
3 : Improved education quality with a focus on restructuring teachers' training and learning evaluation; 
4 : Improved management capacity and increased accountability o f results within the context o f 
decentralization. 

8 2 . 
Government aims, via its Education Emergency P lan (EEP) 2009-2012, to ensure that 
students leave the forma l education system w ith the knowledge and s k i l l s required by the Moroccan 

economy and society. The EEP presents a program o f reforms and actions with four strategic objectives: 
(i) universalize basic education by 201 5 ; ( i i ) promote initiative and excellence in secondary and higher 
education; (iii) improve system performance (teaching, management and stewardship); and (iv) mobilize 
the necessary resources. The Bank has been instrumental in forming an innovative consortium o f five 
major donors that w i l l support the government's EEP implementation through a set o f parallel financing 
operations and analytic work, a l l underpinned by a shared program matrix and a common monitoring 
system. The Bank's own Development Policy Lending program w i l l focus on measures that: (i) 
rationalize the supply of, and strengthen the demand for, basic education (including pre-school education) 

3 1 

through the development and refinement o f planning, targeting and mon i to r ing tools, and (ii) enhance 
overa l l system governance especially at the c r i t ica l regional level. 

’ rog ram A r e a 2 .3 : Hea l th Sector Reform 

Government Goal: Reduce the burden o f major health conditions, reduce inequity in access to services 
affecting poor and ru ra l populations, and improve governance o f the sector. 

CPS Outcomes 

1 : Integrated management o f non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and treatment at primary 
provider level; 
2: More comprehensive nutrition activities integrated in the provision o f maternal and child health 
services; 
3 : Increased transparency and equity in budget allocation, and improved capacity o f regions to manage 
and deliver services; 
4 : Good quality and affordable pharmaceuticals are accessible to the population in public health 

f a c i l i t ies . 

Morocco i s at the center o f a demographic and epidemiological transition. Despite progress 

83 . 
i n increasing overall l i f e expectancy, reducing average in fan t mortality, reducing average f e r t i l i t y rate and 
reducing the spread o f communicable diseases, the country faces health challenges. Specifically, 
maternal mor ta l i ty remains high, par t icu lar ly i n rura l areas, and major inequalities in health status and i n 
access to care persist. The Health Ac t ion Plan 2008-2012 translates the government’s long term v is ion 
presented in Sante, V is ion 2020 (2008) in to four operational p i l lars : (i) rev is ing ro le and responsibilities 
o f the various stakeholders in the health sector; (ii) development o f a care package that i s easily 
accessible, adequate in quantity and quality, and w e l l distributed on the territory; (iii) planning and 
implementation o f specific national plans fo r prevention and con tro l o f diseases; and ( iv ) strengthening o f 
health surveillance and hazard management systems. 

The Bank w i l l support government’s health reform through a combination o f lending and 

84. 
AAA activities, in coordination w i t h other donors (e.g. EU, AFD, AfDB and Spain). Support w i l l focus 
on the fo l low ing objectives: (i) improve maternal and ch i ld nu t r i t ion and chronic diseases prevention 
through in ter a l i a better prevention, detection and treatment at the pr imary care level, as we l l as 
communication; (ii) facilitate 
the reg iona l iza t ioddecen tra l iza t ion o f health services through the 
establishment o f Etablissements Pub l ics de Sank!; and (iii) re form o f the pharmaceutical sector to 
improve drug ava i lab i l i ty and reduce costs through the establishment o f the national pharmaceutical 
agency. In addition, the Bank w i l l support the transversal governance p i l la r o f the Hea l th Ac t ion Plan 
2008-20 12 inc lud ing budget preparation and execution processes, f inanc ia l and human resource 
allocation, health management in forma t ion systems, and the implementation o f systems fostering better 
accountability. 

Government Goal: Reduce poverty, soc ia l exclusion and vulnerability by empowering poor and 
vulnerable groups and particularly women and youth. 

CPS Outcomes 

1 : Improved access to basic infrastructure, soc ia l services and economic opportunities by poor and 
vulnerable groups, including women and youth; 
2: Sustainable and improved quality o f services to vulnerable groups; 
3 : Better coordination o f national policies and institutional mechanisms to reduce vulnerability; 
4: Consolidation o f participatory approaches to ensure that basic infrastructure and socio economic 
services with the needs o f the poor and vulnerable groups, including women and youth. 

32 

vulnerability. INDH r e l i e s on bottom up participation and planning to improve l iv ing standards and give 
greater voice to the poor in targeted communities. The program also aims to promote better coordination 
o f poverty alleviation policies and implementation mechanism across government agencies. Expected 
outcomes include: ( i ) reduction o f poverty, social exclusion and vulnerability; (ii) consolidation o f the 
participatory approaches to local service delivery planning; and ( i i i ) improvement o f the access to basic 
infrastructure, social services and economic activities by poor and vulnerable groups. The Bank w i l l 
continue its support to INDH, focusing in particular on (a) consolidation o f participatory approaches for 
bottom up planning o f interventions; (b) supporting increased access to basic infrastructure service 
delivery, basic infrastructure and economic activities; and (c) facilitating interagency coordination o f 
policies and interventions. The Bank w i l l consider supporting the second phase o f INDH, currently 
planned for the period 201 1-201 5 based on a thorough evaluation o f the experience to date and the 
proposed way forward. Specific support to the Government’s youth and gender agenda w i l l continue 
through dedicated ana ly t ica l work. One A A A activity i s under implementation on youth inclusion with 
the following objectives: ( i ) identify the key factors leading to the social and economic exclusion o f 
young people aged 1 5 to 29 years; (ii) support the national youth strategy that i s currently being 
formulated by the Ministry o f Youth and Sports; and ( i i i ) provide an investment roadmap for youth 
inclusion in a variety o f dimensions across sectors. Regarding gender, ana ly t ica l activities would be 
developed in line with government’s demand. These could take the form o f TAs in relevant sectors, or 
pilot interventions based on sound analytic work. For example, the positive experience in supporting 
gender budgeting could be continued in the coming years; the data effort associated with the youth AAA 
can lend i t s e l f to specific analytical work on gender issues that would inform sector strategies or specific 
programs as appropriate. 

Program Area 2.5: Transport 
Government Goals: Increase the rural population’s access to all-weather roads and improve urban transport 
by reducing congestion. 

CPS Outcomes 

1: Increased accessibility o f rural population to all-weather roads - from 65% ( 2 0 0 9 ) to 80% ( 2 0 1 2 ) ; 
2 : Sustainable maintenance o f unclassified roads; 
3 : Efficient planning and management o f the urban transport sector; 
4: Financial support allocated to urban transport projects with high economic returns. 

8 6 . 

Improv ing access o f ru r a l dwellers to basic transport infrastructure i s among the key goals 
o f the government’s 2020 Rura l Development Strategy. The f i r s t National Program o f Rural Roads 

(NPRR-1) was launched in 1995 and finished in 2006, with impressive results: over 11,000 kilometers o f 
unpaved roads were rehabilitated, with proven positive repercussions on the net enrollment ratio o f girls 
in primary school and the price o f some staple foods. Following the positive experience with NPRR-1, 
government requested Bank support to NRRP-2, which aims to expand access to an all-weather road by 
relying on a strong participatory process, vertical coordination among government levels, and a 
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system. The Bank, with other donors, i s co-financing the 
NRRP-2 whose overall estimated cost i s U S $ l . 8 billion. Given the satisfactory progress o f the program, 
the government requested an additional financing. Through i t s support to the NPRR, the Bank i s 
contributing, together with the government and a number o f other donors, to the gradual extension o f the 
rural network coverage to increase rural populations’ access to all-weather roads. In addition, the Bank 
and other donors are supporting the government to ensure sustainable maintenance o f the unclassified 
rural roads by facilitating the setting up o f an agreement between the local communities, the Ministry o f 
Interior and the Ministry o f Equipment to ensure that maintenance i s ca r r ied out and i s appropriately 
funded. 

8 7 . 

Government i s also engaged in addressing emerging problems i n urban transport. With the 

growth o f c i t i e s and rapid development o f motorization, urban transport has become a severe problem and 

3 3 

its improvement i s a priority for loca l governments. 
Increasing congestion i s affecting the 
competitiveness o f cities and the population’s access to jobs and services. Since 2006, the WBG has 
supported the government’s efforts at improving the efficiency o f urban transport in the country’s large 
cities. An extensive AAA program has allowed the Government and the Bank to jointly identify key 
issues and formulate the main strategic reforms needed to address these issues. government has requested 
Bank support to the design and implementation o f urban transport reforms through a series o f 
development policy loans. The focus w i l l be on: (i) improving the planning and management o f the 
sector and, (ii) developing systems and incentives so that public and private resources flow to investments 
and activities with the highest social and economic returns. More specifically the proposed Urban 
Transport DPLs would contribute to: (a) reduce transport costs and improve the mobility o f people and 
goods, therefore improving the cities’ competitiveness, and creating the proper framework for follow up 
employment and growth stimulating investments; (b) improve the quality and efficiency o f urban 
transport services; and (c) improve sustainable development by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The 
proposed DPLs would also contribute to reinforcing important cross cutting themes such as regional 
development, governance, and public private partnerships. 

P rog ram A rea 2.6: Ag r icu l tu ra l Sector Reform 
Government Goa l: Increased competitiveness and diversification o f the agricultural sector to sustain 
stronger agricultural growth and employment. 
CPS Outcomes 
1 : Improved integration o f smallholders into domestic markets; 
2: Improved irrigation water management; 
3 : Improved public sector support and services t o smallholders. 

8 8 . 

Government recently launched the Plan Mu roc Vert (PMV), an ambitious agricultural 

reform program. The PMV aims to turn agriculture into a source o f growth and employment creation. 
Investments w i l l aim at increasing productivity, improving food security, and encouraging climate change 
adaptation. The P M V ’ s two pillars (the first focused on developing high added value commercial 
agriculture and the second on increasing incomes o f smallholder farms) w i l l be supported by institutional 
reforms aimed at creating an enabling business environment. The Bank w i l l help government to: (i) 
improve integration o f smallholders into domestic markets, by piloting public private partnerships in the 
construction and management o f municipal agricultural and animal markets, slaughterhouses, and fresh 
fruit and vegetable markets; (ii) improve irrigation water management, by facilitating the delegation o f 
irrigation management responsibilities to private operators, implementing the National Irrigation Water 
Management Program, and enhancing coordination among government stakeholders; (iii) improve public 
sector support and services to smallholders by introducing transparent, competitive, and participatory 
procedures in the identification and implementation o f PMV pillar I1 projects. 
I n supporting 
government’s agricultural reform agenda, the Bank w i l l particularly aim to: 

a) 

Improve integration o f smallholders into domestic markets, by piloting public private partnerships in 
the construction and management o f municipal animal markets, slaughterhouses, and fresh fruit and 
vegetable markets, with a view to improve access o f smallholders to quality market infrastructure, 
improve price formation, as well as enhance the overall safety and quality o f domestically marketed 
food; 
b) Improve irrigation water management, by facilitating the delegation o f irrigation management 
responsibilities o f the Public Agricultural Development Agencies (ORMVA’s) to private operators, 
implementing the National Irrigation Water Management Program, and enhancing coordination 
among government stakeholders. Mo re efficient use o f irrigation water w i l l additionally be 
encouraged through improved water pricing and irrigation management, and enforcement o f controls 
on ground water extraction; 

34 

c) 

Improve public sector support and services to smallholders by introducing transparent, competitive, 
and participatory procedures in the identification and implementation o f PMV pillar I1 projects, in 
line with the recent reforms undertaken by government to regionalize and streamline the delivery o f 
agricultural services. 

P rog ram A r e a 2 .7 : Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Reform 
Government Goal: Design and implement a more equitable, efficient and coherent package o f social 
protection programs and re form the o i l and food subsidies programs. 

CPS Outcomes 

1:A more coherent, equitable, and sustainable supply o f soc ia l protection programs for poor and 
vulnerable groups; 
2 : More efficient and e f f e c t i v e social protection operational systems, including targeting and M&E; 
3 : Expansion and diversification o f social security coverage. 

8 9 . 
Government has intensified its e f fo r ts at building efficient social safety nets and social 
insurance schemes in the past years but the system still faces important challenges. These include 
the need to increase coverage, improve targeting, increase the adequacy o f interventions to the needs o f 
the poor and vulnerable, and strengthen coordination at both central and loca l levels. Government i s also 
trying to progressively reduce the predominance o f untargeted o i l and food subsidies as the main safety 
net, and to develop targeted soc ia l assistance programs promoting the insertion o f poor and vulnerable 
groups i n the economy. Following the exchange o f international experience on o i l and food subsidy 
reforms in 2 0 0 8 , government has requested the Bank’s help with social protection reform. Bank support 
w i l l focus on the design and implementation o f a more equitable, coherent and sustainable package o f 
soc ia l assistance and soc ia l insurance programs. This w i l l be achieved through the completion of the 
ongoing Targeting and Social Protection Strategy, and a mix o f lending and complementary AAA to 
f a c i l i t a t e the implementation o f its recommendations. The strategy under preparation analyzes: (i) the 
match between the needs fo r and supply o f social assistance and social insurance programs with a view to 
identify gaps and overlaps; (ii) targeting systems; and ( i i i ) the institutional framework fo r soc ia l 
protection. The analysis may lead to scaling up promising programs or setting up new ones which w i l l 
require stronger systems and processes (e.g. targeting, beneficiary registry management & maintenance, 
payment systems, M&E, communication,). 
I n parallel, the Bank w i l l continue to provide TA on soc ia l 
security expansion and diversification, and may initiate AAA where critical program gaps are being 
identified under the ongoing work such as Early Childhood Development. 

Program Areas under development within Pillar 2 
P r o g r am A rea 2.8: Leverag ing PPPs for infrastructure investments and serv ice de l ive ry 

9 0 . 
Public Private Partnerships represent an opportunity to enhance the effectiveness o f 
government’s future investments i n infrastructure and service delivery. Morocco has developed 
valuable experience in PPPs during the past decade. Yet, use o f PPPs remains ad hoc, lacking a strategic 
vision and constrained by a number o f shortcomings. Government can significantly benefit from 
additional usage o f PPP, given the country’s substantial infrastructure needs, its need to maintain f i s c a l 
balance, and the potential efficiency gains involved. World Bank Group support to PPP initiatives could 
be either sector-specific, via a component o f an investment lending operation or a AAA activity (in the 
infrastructure sectors for example), or crosscutting and focused on helping the government address the 
PPP agenda at institutional level, for instance through TA support to a new cen t ra l PPP unit. 

9 1 . 
The growth o f PPP transactions i n Morocco o f fe rs opportunities for IFC to play a ro l e 
either as an investor in specific project, o r as an advisor. 
I n the energy sector, the anticipated 
liberalization o f the power sector and i n particular, plans for independent power generation and renewable 

3 5 

energy could present key opportunities for IFC. In the transport sector, opportunities are also likely to 
arise from the large government-led infrastructure projects such as the Tangier M e d Port or from urban 
transport projects for large cities such as Rabat or Casablanca. I n the area o f solid waste management 
where recent reforms open new opportunities for the private sector, the IFC could support PPPs in new 
waste management plants, at the municipal level. 

P I L L A R 3: SUSTA INABLE DEVELOPMENT IN A C H A N G I N G C L I M A T E 

9 2 . Morocco’s future economic development i s vulnerable to energy supply disruption and 
price volatility, water scarcity and natura l resource depletion. Climate change impacts are already 

felt today. Activities under the third CPS Pillar aim to support government’s renewed attention to long 
standing environmental sustainability issues and future challenges brought about by climate change. 
Government has solicited the Bank’s support on four program areas, o f which one i s currently under 
development. 

. . 

Defined Program Areas 

P rog ram A rea 3 .1 : Water Managemen t 
Government Goal: Promote water resources conservation and protection and improve water s e r v i c e 
coverage and efficiency. 

CPS Outcomes 

1 : Reduced water losses and better control o f groundwater abstraction; 
2 : Increased urban sewerage and wastewater treatment coverage; 
3 : Better knowledge o f CC impacts on water resources; 
4 : Increased access to and efficiency o f WSS services; 
5 : Better coordination between ministries involved in the water sector. 

9 3 , 

Government recently launched its new water sector strategy. Although its details remain 

unpublished, i t i s announced to focus on: (i) accelerated investment in development o f conventional and 
alternative water resources; (ii) new policy emphasis on demand management and water savings in 
irrigation and utility service; (iii) continued support to resource protection and wastewater management 
programs; (iv) development o f flood control works; and (v) institutional reforms. In the water supply and 
sanitation (WSS) subsector, government remains committed to achieve equitable WSS access in rural and 
periurban areas, upgraded urban sanitation services and increased utility service efficiency. 

9 4 . 
Building on the gains and lessons o f a substantial water program under the 2005-2009 CAS, 
the 2010-2014 CPS w i l l seek to strengthen the Bank- government partnership in the water sector. I t 

w i l l maximize the cross-cutting contribution o f water to Morocco’s economic growth, social 
development, and climate change adaptation needs. The diversity, complexity and evolution of water 
challenges across the water resources management, irrigation, and water supply and sanitation subsectors, 
c a l l for a flexible and strategically targeted application o f Bank instruments. Policy and investment 
lending appear most relevant in subsectors such as irrigation and WSS with c lea r impacts on the 
economic growth, social development, and water demand management agendas. Policy reform and 
investment needs in water resources management, including strategy optimization in light o f climate 
change impacts, may best be addressed through policy lending, TA and ESWs, as well as through selected 
investments in resource development. 

9 5 . 
Accompanying the government’s efforts in promoting PPPs i n the water sector, I F C w i l l 
consider opportunities in water and sanitation concessions in new cities or i n desalination projects. 

Investment in the water and sanitation sectors might also offer opportunities for IFC subnational lending, 

36 

along the lines o f its investment in a sanitation project in a local utility in the c i t y o f E l Jadida in FY08. 
Finally, i t could also provide advisory support in specific PPP transactions as i t successfully did in the 
irrigation sector, in the Guerdane region. 

’ rog ram A rea 3 .2 : Low Carbon Energy Po l icy and Energy Sector Res truc tur ing 

Government Goal: Enhance energy security and ensure availability o f energy to a l l Moroccan 
households and businesses at competitive prices, while protecting the environment and mitigating 
climate change. 

CPS Outcomes 
1 : Reduction o f energy intensity and increased penetration o f renewables to transition the energy system 
to a low carbon path; 
2 : Price re fo rm implementation, t o reduce the budget burden o f price subsidies and ensure the financial 
viability o f energy operators; 
3 : Establishment o f institutions and financial mechanisms to successhlly implement energy sector 
reform; 
4: Development o f a local manufacturing capability for renewable technologies and energy efficient 
equipment-a green stimulus package-therefore contributing t o job creation. 

9 6 . 
T o address the challenges o f energy security, sustainable development and competitiveness, 
government formulated a new strategy in 2009 . The objectives are: energy security, availability o f 
energy to a l l Moroccan households and businesses at competitive prices, energy demand management, 
promotion o f national expertise and development o f technological know-how and environmental 
protection and climate change mitigation. To achieve these objectives, the key elements o f the strategy 
are: (i) diversify and optimize the energy mix around reliable and competitive energy technologies, in 
order to reduce the share o f o i l to 40% by 2 0 3 0 ; (ii) develop the national renewable energy potential, with 
the objectives o f increasing the contribution o f renewables to 10-1 5% o f primary energy demand by 201 2; 
(iii) make energy efficiency improvements a national priority; (iv) develop indigenous energy resources 
by intensifying hydrocarbon exploration activities and developing conventional and non-conventional o i l 
sources; (v) integrate into the regional energy market, through enhanced cooperation and trade with both 
other Maghreb countries and the EU. 

9 7 . 
Government has requested Bank lending to help address these challenges and make the 
energy sector an engine of sustainable growth and competitiveness. To address the objectives o f 
energy security, competitive energy supplies and low carbon intensity, i t i s essen t ia l to improve the 
operational and financial performance o f the sector and strengthen its governance. To that end, the CPS 
w i l l support actions in a number o f areas: (i) energy efficiency and renewable energy ( “ma i t r ise de 
l’e‘nergie’’); (ii) technology promotion for loca l use and exports, with a view to improving domestic 
environmental sustainability and increased performance o f the national economy but also help 
government contribute to global climate change mitigation; (iii) sound operational and financial 
performance o f the energy sector; (iv) management o f energy price subsidies, so as not to burden the 
economy, while at the same time not penalizing the most vulnerable populations (through targeted 
subsidies); (v) governance o f the energy sector, to enable the necessary institutional and sector reforms to 
improve sector performance. 

9 8 . 
IBRD will support these outcomes through a mix o f instruments. F i r s t , a DPL built on three 
pillars: (i) security o f supply, while ensuring a sustainable energy future, ( i i ) competitiveness o f energy 
supplies and ( i i i ) capacity building for strong operational and financial performance. Second, investment 
lending and credit lines are being provided to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, as part o f 
the investment plan recently approved by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) to access concessional 
resources for low carbon investment. This w i l l help improve energy efficiency in a l l end-use sectors - 
industry, buildings and transport, including railways - and increase the penetration o f renewable energy in 

37 

the power sector. Third, a GEF grant supports the construction o f a solar assisted combined cyc le power 
p lan t in the N o r t h east o f the country. Fourth, the concentrated solar power scale-up in i t ia t ive calls fo r 
use o f C T F f inanc ing fo r the large scale development o f solar based power generating capacity. Mo rocco 
p lays a key ro le in the development o f the vast untapped Maghreb solar potential. The Bank w i l l also 
finance essential basic infrastructure necessary to exp lo i t the region’s solar resources: transmission w i th in 
the coun try o r cross-border, storage ( fo r instance thanks to pumped storage) and other required 
transmission and balancing investment. F ina l ly , the Bank w i l l support reg iona l integration, in particular 
the construction o f the Maghreb common energy market and the integration in to the EU market (in 
par t icu lar through exports o f green electricity). 

9 9 . 

IFC w i l l pu rsue investments in v iab le renewab le energy pro jects . I t w i l l support investments 
in p r iva te ly sponsored w ind generation plants and w i l l also consider investments i n solar generation 
projects. 
Box 1: Concentrated solar power in Morocco - A Bank-Government partnership for energy security, 
sustainability and growth 
Renewable energy (RE) i s central to the energy dialogue between the World Bank Group and the government o f 
Morocco. Examples include the Bank-financed low-carbon energy supply strategy, the development o f the 
contractual framework for wind self-generation, the GEF grant for the A in Beni Mathar integrated solar combined 
cycle power plant, the various provisions contained in the Energy DPL for a law on RE, an implementation plan for 
wind power promotion, and price reform to promote energy efficiency (EE) and RE. The CPS w i l l support 
government’s objective to enhance the role o f the energy sector as an engine o f equitable growth, while ensuring 
sustainability. 

On November 2nd 2009, a US$9 b i l l ion solar plan was announced that aims to install 2,000 M W o f solar power 
generation capacity by 2020. With this plan, the equivalent o f Casablanca’s electricity consumption - 4,500 GWh 
annually - w i l l be produced from Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). This ambitious goal requires transformation o f 
the energy sector and has economy-wide implications. 
I t w i l l orient industrial development and the research 
community (e.g., through publicly-financed research centers) towards RE. I t w i l l foster low-carbon development o f 
the energy sec tor and enhance energy security. 
I t w i l l stimulate large investments, enhance Morocco ’s 
competitiveness and define i t as an ‘early mover’ on a promising green technology. Both construction and operation 
o f the projects would provide major employment opportunities. 

The Bank w i l l support Morocco ’s solar plan through the Energy DPL, concessional financing proposed through the 
Clean Technology Fund, and possible investment lending operations and technical assistance. I t could also serve as 
a ‘pilot’ for the PPP work envisaged by the Moroccan government together with both the World Bank and the IFC. 
I t i s intended that CSP projects currently planned w i l l be privately owned and operated. The sca le o f the initiative 
requires public support, concessional financing from donors, and implementation o f an enabling regulatory and 
institutional framework to make CSP competitive enough to attract private investment. I f Morocco succeeds in 
combining the CSP know-how with the right domestic regulatory environment, RE has the potential to export large 
amounts o f CSP-power to Europe and to become a major long-term driver o f green growth in Morocco. The PPP 
approach, to be tested in this CPS, offers promise in making this happen. 

Program Area 3 . 3 : Solid Waste Management 

I Government Goals: (i) effective establishment o f integrated municipal solid waste systems based on a I 
sound legal and institutional basis; (ii) enhanced sustainability through the introduction o f financial 
mechanisms and incentives; (iii) improve the environmental and social performance o f the solid waste 
sector through the upgrading and operationalization o f the existing E IA system. 

CPS Outcomes 
1 : Effective inter-ministerial coordination o f the National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and 
strengthened regulatory framework through the enactment o f executive regulations for Solid Waste 
Management (SWM) planning, norms and standards 

2: Better financial sustainability through: (i) allocation o f financial resources consistent with the sector 
policies and programs; (ii) improved cost effectiveness o f private sector operators involved in 
providing SWM services; (iii) additional sources o f revenues generated through Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM); 
3 : Disposal practices complying with international soc ia l and environmental standards, by establishment 
o f an Environmental Impact Assessment system. 

1 00 . Mo ro c co ’ s Mun ic ipa l Solid Waste (MSW) Management Sector faces ma jor performance 

constraints. These include: (i) poor waste disposal practices w i t h huge environmental and social 
negative impacts; (ii) domestic M S W production increasing exponentially; (iii) a weak legal and 
ins t i tu t iona l framework; 
( iv) poor cost effectiveness o f services; w i t h weak long-term f inanc ia l 
sustainability; (v) urgent need fo r integrated and modernized so l id waste management systems, wh ich w i l l 
m i t iga te negative economic, environmental, and social impacts o f the ex is t ing systems; and (v i ) l im i ted 
and ine f f ic ien t allocation o f f inanc ia l resources and missed opportunities available under international 
c l ima te change mechanisms. 

101 , The Bank w i l l support government in the key steps taken towards reform o f the S W M 

system. A f te r the passing o f the So l id Waste Management L aw 28-00 in November 2006, government 
launched a 15-year, 3-phase Na t iona l Mun ic ipa l So l id Waste Management Program to restructure and 
modernize the sector. F irs t ly , the Bank w i l l support the Government objectives o f pu t t ing the sector on a 
sound ins t i tu t iona l foo t ing by supporting effective interministerial coordination and a strengthened 
regulatory framework. Secondly, the Bank w i l l support f inanc ia l sustainability b y ensuring that financial 
allocations are consistent w i t h the program objectives, by devising measures to enhance the cost 
effectiveness o f private sector operators and mak ing sure that additional sources o f C D M revenues are 
leveraged. Th ird ly , the Bank w i l l help government in ameliorating the environmental and social 
performance o f the sector, by upgrading the EIA system and ensuring that environmental and social 
constraints are considered at various stages o f the decision chain. 

Program Areas under Development 

P r o g r am A rea 3 .4 : C l ima te Change 
Government Goal: Improve resilience t o climate variability and change through the integration o f 
adaptation actions across and within sectors and explore new avenues for mitigation. 

CPS Outcomes 
1 : Improved inter-agency coordination and policy coherence on climate change; 
2: Defined adaptation and mitigation planning in key sectors; 
3 : Adaptation pilots launched in selected areas; 
4: Development o f tools and mechanisms to increase resilience and a le r tness . 

102 . Government intends to strengthen the country’s ability to cope w ith current and future 
climatic variability and longer-term change, while at the same time lowering emissions. There i s 

increased awareness o f c l ima t ic vu lnerab i l i ty and interest in opportunities o f fered b y l ow carbon growth. 
The Na t iona l C l ima te Change Counc i l and the Na t iona l Scientific Committee fo r C l ima te Change are 
increasingly active. A number o f recent sector strategies attempt t o address c l ima te change implications, 
such as the new agriculture strategy, P l a n M a r o c Ve r t . I t focuses on e f f ic iency i n the use o f water, as 
sustainability o f water resources i s a national p r io r i ty . M i t iga t ion efforts are already under way i n the 
energy and so l id waste sectors. The transport, urban, and agriculture sectors are iden t i fy ing further 
prospects. A consolidated strategy i s needed to resolve the trade-offs posed to pub l ic po l icy . 

103. Government has requested the Bank’s support to address climate change. F i r s t , bu i ld ing on 

Morocco’s second national communication to the UNFCCC, the Bank w i l l support the preparation o f an 

39 

integrated adaptation and mitigation strategy. Second, the Bank w i l l contribute to adaptation and 
mitigation planning through ESW in areas such as integrated risk management, coastal c i t i e s adaptation, 
transport (both mitigation and adaptation), integrated coastal zone management and climate-induced 
migration. Th i rd , the Bank w i l l support the design and implementation o f adaptation pilots, for instance 
in the agricultural sector, combining investment, policy lending, ESW and GEF resources. Four th , the 
Bank w i l l support the development o f climate information tools and analysis, to help build the knowledge 
base required to inform policy. Going forward, the Bank w i l l remain open to increase i t s support to 
Morocco’s adaptation and mitigation needs and investments across a l l sectors. 
CPS - Crosscutt ing Beams: Governance a n d T e r r i to r i a l i t y 

Governance 

104 . The W B G w i l l support the government’s governance approach and program. Government’s 
ambitious development outcomes require addressing c r i t ica l governance issues, such as low internal and 
external accountability on results, and lack o f sufficient feed-back loop on the incidence o f public 
expenditure. I t has been agreed with government that governance i s therefore a crosscutting theme 
affecting engagement in the entire Bank program. Entry points for governance work w i l l be assessed at 
the concept stage o f a l l instruments. The Bank w i l l seek to maximize value for money in public 
expenditure and improve the delivery o f public services. The C-GAC analysis completed in 2009 
provided Bank teams with a platform to identify such entry points. Specific attention w i l l be devoted to 
efficiency gains to maximize the impact o f public spending in the delivery o f key services particularly in 
health, education, water and sanitation and social protection, and to strengthen the institutional framework 
in selected sectors. 

1 0 5 . 
The Bank w i l l support institutional development a t the national and local levels. The public 
administration reform DPL w i l l support budgetary and HR efficiency. The Solid Waste and Urban 
Transport DPLs aim to support more effective regulatory frameworks, as do engagements in the water 
and energy sectors. The Bank w i l l help strengthen the new National commission fo r investment climate 
reforms. Dialogue on urban development aims at improving the institutional coherence o f municipal 
projects and to align them with the national land use planning strategy. 

106 . 
Improved public expenditure w i l l be pursued through capacity to measure results and 
orient service delivery to outcomes.’ IBRD i s contributing to the development o f more efficient and 
effective social protection operational systems, including targeting and M&E. 
I t supports the 
government’s Education Emergency Plan (2009 -20 1 2 ) to focus on improved education quality by 
restructuring teachers’ training and learning evaluation and increasing management capacity to account 
for results. I t i s conducting a user survey on health sector facilities and services. The Skills Development 
DPL w i l l support government to establish an M&E system on labor market policies and programs. The 
Bank w i l l develop tools for economic impact analysis and monitoring and evaluation for measuring 
progress o f investment climate reforms. The Bank w i l l consider accompanying other initiatives, such as 
helping to pilot the use o f new accountability tools and supporting key governance institutions. This 
could be done through non lending support to the new anti-corruption agency (Instance Centrale de 
Pre‘vention de l a Corrup t ion , ICPC), MIS capacity building to enable easy access to development 
outcomes information (key service delivery s ta t is t ics , results/achievements) by citizens, particularly in 
social sector, and piloting the use o f citizen’s report cards and users’ surveys. Finally, the Bank’s 
commitment to increase the use o f country systems in the delivery o f i t s program also constitutes an 
opportunity to improve institutional performance in a range o f public financial management, procurement, 
social and environmental areas. 

40 

Territoriality 

107 . The Bank w i l l support the government’s objective t o foster spatially inclusive development, 
and to increase the ro l e o f local government, i t s performance, accountability, and empowerment. 
F i r s t , effective spatially inclusive development programs, such as those aimed at facilitating the 
integration o f lagging areas with growth-pole regions, require the establishment and development o f 
institutions and policies that respond to l o c a l needs and demands. Government’s spatial development 
agenda aims at a better regulation o f land, labor, and product markets; the provision o f quality basic social 
services; and investments in connecting infrastructure through territorial-based interventions. Second, 
achieving these results depends on a further definition o f roles and responsibilities o f the central and sub- 
national governments and a stronger link between the envisaged deconcentration and decentralization 
reforms. Improved capacity and accountability mechanisms at the sub-national level, and an appropriate 
distribution o f f i s c a l and human resources are then required. The Bank w i l l seek to further discuss the 
choices and implications o f a greater reliance on levels below central government in order to support a 
vision o f “territoriality” and use the Bank program to support its realization. 

1 0 8 . Numerous entry points exist and provide a foundation f o r further support. The PAR Loan 
and its related ESW address some o f the challenges o f the deconcentration agenda, such as reforming HR 
and budget policies. The Solid Waste Management DPLs support devolved decision-making authority 
and management functions to the communes, together with increased financial capacity and authority. 
Bank financial support for implementation o f the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV ) w i l l help readjust the balance 
between central and local level decision making in the agricultural sector. Lending and AAA activities 
support increased transparency, efficiency and equity in budget allocation, and improved capacity o f 
regions to manage and deliver services in the health sector. The Bank supports increased loca l capacities 
and better coordination o f national policies and institutional mechanisms in the National Initiative on 
Human Development (INDH). Other examples include rural roads and various operations (urban 
transport and solid waste) to fac i l i ta te direct private sector contracting by the communes. Going forward, 
the Bank w i l l broaden the dialogue through additional AAA products and w i l l consider requests for 
f inanc ia l support for the second half o f the CPS program period. 

D. 

Lending Volumes 

109. Government has requested an annual I B R D lending envelope o f US$600 million which i s 
more than twice the average annual lending volume during the FY06-FYOg CAS period. The 
interest to borrow more from the Bank reflects both a wish to benefit from Bank support on an expanded 
reform agenda and a debt restructuring strategy that would see a greater proportion o f external financing 
on favorable terms. Three main factors underpin the strategy to increase the proportion o f multilateral 
financing. The first i s linked to the public debt maturity structure. The average maturity has fallen in 
recent years, and i s expected to f a l l further given that the central government mostly financed its needs 
through issuing T-bills o f up to one year in the domestic market. The authorities therefore wish to 
lengthen average maturity. The second re la tes to the higher balance o f payments needs. The third i s to 
accommodate the current higher borrowing requirements from the budget in a context o f tightening 
liquidity o f the domestic f inanc ia l markets after a long period o f an over-liquid money market. 

1 10. The Government’s reform agenda i s reflected i n a strong pipeline o f operations f o r the next 
t w o fiscal years. Table 10 below shows a tentative lending program o f $600 m i l l ion in each year. Most 
operations listed fo r FY 10 are in the final phases o f preparation. The operations listed for FY 1 1 have 
been the subject o f a formal request by the government, and are currently under preparation. Current 
indications are that this level o f demand w i l l continue beyond FY 1 1 , A l l operations are intended to 
support the most critical reform programs, with a particular focus on the six priority sectors identified, as 
well as the transversal themes o f governance, territoriality, and public administration reform.

E. 

Principles and Rules o f Engagement 

1 12 . 
I n Morocco’s rapidly evolving reform environment, a client owned program requires 
flexibility. During the last programming cycle, the Bank avoided straitjacketing i t s action within the rigid 
contours o f the CAS program to effectively address the country’s shifting needs and remain relevant. 
This CPS addresses the issue directly by developing a clear medium term business plan (24 months) o f 
defined operations, while maintaining leeway to adjust the program based on the results o f dialogue in the 
remaining program period. Equally, the Results Matrix shies away from specifying outcomes and 
indicators for operations that are currently under development. The midterm CPS review w i l l provide the 
opportunity to do so while developing the definitive .business plan for the second ha l f o f the program. 

1 1 3 . Ensuring a flexible and client owned program w i l l also require particular attention to 
selectivity issues. To maintain a focus on the Bank’s mandate, while ensuring client ownership, future 
interventions w i l l have to go through a simple three-question test: ( i ) I s there a need? (ii) I s there a clear 
government demand? ( i i i ) Does the Bank have a comparative advantage in bringing or brokering 
capacity? I f the answer to any o f these questions i s “no”, then there w i l l be a case for staying out. 

F. 

Instruments 

1 14 . CPS implementation w i l l be supported by the full range o f IBRD instruments. The choice o f 
instruments w i l l be determined by three criteria: status o f dialogue, demand from the government, and 
the characteristics o f the specific operation. 

1 1 5 . DPLs have so fa r been central to the lending program, reflecting the reform nature o f 
engagement. O f the ten lending operations delivered during the previous CAS (2005-2009) for a total o f 
$1.127 billion, six were DPLs, representing two thirds o f commitments. The DPLs supported sector-wide 
structural reforms with substantial development impact in areas such as: (i) increased efficiency o f public 
administration; (ii) increased efficiency o f the financial sector and improved access to finance; (iii) 

42 

enhanced energy security, increased energy efficiency, and an improved framework for renewable 
energies development; (iv) increased access to low-income housing; (v) improved water management 
and increased access to drinking water and sanitation services; and (vi) more efficient and safer nation- 
wide management o f solid waste. The reform content o f Bank-financed S I L s and SWAps has also been 
substantial, as in the education sector and the National Initiative fo r Human Development. DPLs are the 
preferred instrument o f the Government. In addition to providing flexibility, they provide an adequate 
conduit for the kind o f structural challenges that sector-wide reforms entail. I f necessary, the Bank w i l l 
consider increasing the volumes o f i t s DPLs to respond to these preferences in line with the nature o f the 
proposed program. To the extent possible, the Bank w i l l consolidate DPL interventions based on 
synergies and sector compatibility. 

1 1 6 . The Morocco portfolio has seen significant changes i n recent years. As the Bank has 
responded to government’s preference for the DPL instrument, the investment lending portfolio has 
declined considerably in number o f projects from 14 in FY07 to 6 today. The aggregate s ize o f the 
portfolio has remained relatively large as the program i s consolidated into fewer but larger-size projects. 
The portfolio amounts to $433.7 million in commitments, o f which $237.8 million i s undisbursed. The 
performance o f the portfolio has been strong with one unsatisfactory project (currently being restructured) 
that accounts for just 6% o f overall commitments. Portfolio performance indicators on realism, 
proactivity and disbursement are a l l good. Looking forward, government has requested the Bank to 
develop further investment projects in the coming two years in rural roads and water and sanitation. 
These are sectors where the implementation track has been strong. 

I 1 7 . The Bank has a large trust fund program. I t supports 36 discrete activities in the aggregate 
amount o f $64 million, in ten sectors aligned with government priorities. I t i s guided by the principles o f 
country ownership, alignment with CPS objectives, being complementary to other Bank activities, broad 
dissemination o f findings, and selectivity in deployment. I t i s mainly focused on analytic work, much o f 
which i s linked to policy-based lending. Key areas supported are public sector management, energy, 
water, education (innovative testing o f Conditional Cash Transfer pilots) and climate change. Appendix 7 
provides more details on the role o f trust funds in the program. 

1 1 8 . The Bank’s r o l e as knowledge partner i n Morocco w i l l depend both on maintaining the 
quality of its AAA products as well as alignment w ith demand. ESW w i l l continue to play a particular 
role in increasing awareness as in the analytical work program proposed on poverty, youth and gender. I t 
w i l l also be deployed to build consensus on how to approach important challenges, as in soc ia l protection, 
economic integration, business environment, agriculture and climate change. AAA products w i l l also be 
developed to support large and complex operational engagements as in public sector reform, enhanced 
service delivery, water and energy. 

1 19. Analytical products w i l l provide the starting point o f engagement in areas where dialogue i s 
recent. This includes areas such as public-private partnerships, areas where there i s uncertainty about the 
impact o f a first generation reform or where there are reputational risks o f engagement through financial 
support. However, i n order to enhance its knowledge leverage, the Bank w i l l need to consolidate the 
ESW portfolio to make i t l e s s fragmented, and reflect on its approach to mobilizing trust fund support, 
with a view to align i t on client’s demand. 

120 . One key challenge i s to increase capacity fo r monitoring and evaluation to deliver 
increasingly complex policies, ensure the reduction of social disparities and reduce lower exposure 
to risk. In the context o f increasing decentralization o f decision making and implementation and the need 
to build capacity across key agencies the Bank w i l l concentrate on assisting Morocco overcome key gaps 
in the data on economic vulnerability and the impact o f risks on living standards. The value added o f 

43 

Bank involvement i s to improve quality o f nationally-owned capacity, facilitate better coordination in a 
decentralized system o f data collection and evaluation, and support greater openness and participation o f 
c iv i l society. 

12 1 . 
I F C w i l l focus on investments w ith demonstrated additionality and strong development 
impact. This w i l l include for instance large financing needs, exceeding the capacity o f domestic banks, 
or those requiring longer maturities, foreign currency financing or complex structuring that are not 
available locally. Through the use o f equity, quasi-equity and structured finance products such as 
guarantees, IFC w i l l also consider smaller investments in strategic sectors (e.g. agribusiness, education 
and health sectors, wind projects) where i t can add value. 
IFC’s advisory program w i l l continue to 
complement investments, with activities focused on the business climate and PPP advisory-based 
transactions in infrastructure. 

122 . M IGA ’ s stands ready to support pillars I and I 1 o f the CPS. First, building on 
trade liberalization and increasing trends o f Moroccan direct investments abroad, M IGA stands ready to 
accompany private sector competitiveness, by supporting the international development o f Moroccan 
enterprises mainly into sub-Saharan Africa. Second, M IGA could support government’s efforts to 
improve the delivery o f local services by supporting international investors considering infrastructure 
investments at the sub-sovereign level. 

1 2 3 . 
I n the context o f its A rab Wo r ld In it iat ive , the Bank w i l l wo rk w ith the Moroccan 
authorities to capitalize on the opportunities o f better regional and cross-border cooperation. 
Initiatives include: 

The regional Concentrated Solar Power initiative (supported by concessional financing from the 
Clean Technology Fund). 
A A A products addressing barriers to economic integration both in terms o f trade and FDI. The 
Bank has developed a substantive knowledge program on financial integration and works closely 
with the Arab Monetary Fund and the IMF . 
I n the area o f regional transport, the Bank i s playing the role o f facilitator and knowledge partner. 
In addition to contributing to the EU ‘Regional Transport Action Plan for the Mediterranean 
Region 2007-20 1 3 ’ in partnership with the EU, EIB, A fDB and other donors, the Bank i s scoping 
opportunities to further dialogue on logistics efficiency for intraregional trade through a portfolio 
o f ESW products. 
On employability, the Bank i s active in the development o f a regional qualification system, 
activating a regional labor market, and improving social protection and labor management for 
migrants. 
Morocco i s the focus o f several ESW products, TA and capacity building activities addressing 
regional dimensions o f climate change adaptation. These address issues such as the impacts on 
climate change on coas ta l c i t ies , internal migration, the role o f climate change for the ecosystems 
o f the region, technical support to planning and capacity for waste water treatment and a regional 
analysis o f the economic and soc ia l impacts o f climate change on agriculture). 
I n the water sector, MENA supports capacity building o f institutions such as the Arab Water 
Council, and activities such as the Arab Water Management Initiative, Regional Water Initiative 
and a regional Institutional Development Fund grant in Public Engagement in Water 
Management. 
Morocco i s one o f the founding members o f the M a r s e i l l e Center fo r Mediterranean Integration 
(MCMI) together with Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. The Center targets the strategic 
territory o f upstream knowledge management, by facilitating joint 
learning across the 
Mediterranean. The MCM I work builds on program clusters directly in line with Morocco’s 

44 

objectives. These include: ( i ) Skills, Employment and Labor Mobility, (ii) (Environment) and 
Water; ( i i i ) Urban and Spatial Development; (iv) Knowledge Economy, Innovation and 
Technology. As a founding member, Morocco i s both s e t to benefit from and play a key role in 
the success o f the M CM I regional program. 

124. The I F C w i l l continue t o support south-south investments and cross-border flows. Building 
on i t s recent investment in BMCE Bank which targeted the bank’s expansion in 11 Sub-Saharan African 
countries, IFC w i l l continue to support Moroccan companies expansion at the regional level, namely in 
the Maghreb and Africa. IFC w i l l also pursue investments in Morocco with emerging regional players. 

G. 

Alignment, Harmonization, and Use o f Country Systems 

1 2 5 . Donor financing has increased substantially during the past ten years. 
In 2006, total net 
ODA and official aid reached $1,046 million (equivalent to 1.6% o f GNI, or $ 3 4 per capita) up from $419 
million (1.2% o f GN I and $ 1 5 per capita) in 2000. The level o f IBRD disbursements between 2005 and 
2008 averaged $275 million per year, making i t the second largest donor a f te r the EU. Notwithstanding 
i t s increasing level, ODA accounts for a relatively small proportion ( less than 5%) o f total annual 
government expenditure. Appendix 6 provides more details on donor’s deployment. 

126. Donor coordination has improved, helped by strong national programs and the active ro l e 
of government. Donors are working to ensure greater upstream coordination in country programs and 
sector activities. This was visible in 2009 when four o f Morocco’s main donors - World Bank, AfDB, 
AFD and EU - initiated a process o f mutual collaboration in the development o f their respective new or 
updated strategies. Cerfain areas such as INDH, public administration reform, education, have seen 
particularly strong collaboration, with systematic use o f joint missions, harmonized results frameworks, 
and shared disbursement conditions. Others, like the rural road access program, have brought several 
donors together around a sector-wide approach. Donors increasingly recognize their respective areas of 
comparative advantage. 

127 . 
The Bank Group i s committed to greater collaboration and harmonization. I t stands ready 
to provide support to the EU advanced status agreement, should the government want it. IBRD and the 
EU are currently engaging jo in t ly in five key areas, education, health, INDH, public administration 
reform and rural roads, for a cumulated joint total financing estimated in excess o f $900 million. In other 
areas, such as justice, energy, and agricultural reform, parallel interventions are currently envisaged. This 
collaboration i s expected to increase as the content o f the advanced status agreement gets further defined. 
The IFC w i l l also continue i t s close coordination and collaboration with other donors and partners such as 
AfJJB, E IB and Proparco, particularly in the infrastructure and financial markets sectors. 

1 2 8 . Country systems are already the main channel f o r delivering donor support. Government’s 
progress on the overall fiduciary framework, i t s efforts to improve i t s systems, and the degree o f 
transparency and openness to external validation i t has demonstrated has led to increased reliance on 
country systems to deliver donor financing. According to the 2008 Survey on the implementation o f the 
Paris Declaration, about 80 percent o f donor financing was disbursed into what can broadly be described 
as national systems. Budget support contributed significantly to this result. 

129. 
Mo ro c co ’ s country systems, and its commitment to further strengthen them, underpin the 
national development. program and the environment fo r donor support. 
Improvements in public 
financial management, procurement and safeguard procedures form part o f the government’s overall 
objective o f improving the quality o f the administration and reinforcing the competitiveness o f the 
national economy. I t confirmed i t s in te res t to be considered a candidate country in the piloting program 

45 

in the use o f country procurement systems under Bank-supported operations. Following a CPAR (2007), 
i t i s undergoing further evaluation o f i t s national procurement system. I t also agreed to undergo external 
bench-marked evaluations o f its financial management systems (CFAA, 2003 & 2007, and PEFA in 
2009). These assessments noted that Morocco’s systems are relatively strong and present low fiduciary 
risk. They also identified areas needing improvement. Government has expressed a willingness to 
address these, and in many cases has already agreed to the establishment o f improvement plans. 
Appendix 5 provides more details on the status o f the use o f country systems in financial management, 
procurement, and environmental and social safeguards. 

1 3 0 . Government has requested the Bank and other donors to make increased use of country 
systems, in line with their commitments to do so in the Paris Declaration (2005) and Accra Agenda for 
Action (2008).8 I t wishes to see tangible progress toward this objective during CPS implementation. 
Building on the processes described above, the Bank w i l l sustain i t s partnership with the government to 
assess systems, identify directions for improvements, invest in capacity building and accompany change 
implementation, w i th the objective o f progressively increasing the use o f country systems. 

V I . 

R I S K S 

1 3 1 . 
Two issues threaten the objectives o f this Country Partnership Strategy. First, the short term 
growth outlook i s subject to systemic and exogenous risks. Morocco i s confronted with uncertainties on 
the timing, speed and shape o f the recovery from the global crisis. While there are encouraging signs of a 
possible end to the c r is is , i t i s too early to predict how the global economy w i l l emerge from the 
recession. I t i s yet unclear to what extent Morocco w i l l continue to be confronted with the impact o f the 
economic slowdown on i t s exports, remittances, ability to attract FDI and sustainability o f i t s public 
stimulus program. Morocco’s track record o f strong macroeconomic management suggests that i t i s well 
placed to face the uncertainties arising from the current crisis. The Bank w i l l help mitigate the associated 
economic risks through continued monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on the overall 
macroeconomic context, as well as analysis o f options for remedial measures as eventually requested by 
the government. 

132. Second, the successful implementation o f government reform agenda hinges on political 
economy factors. Once second-generation reforms are rolled out, the resistance o f vested interests w i l l 
add to the complexities o f implementation. Possible outcomes include the derailing o f reforms’ 
objectives, a stalling o f the reform process, and a decline o f the credibility o f the reform agenda in the 
eyes o f public opinion. Government’s recent emphasis on deep governance reforms, such as that o f the 
justice sector, i s a key factor in the mitigation o f these risks. The Bank Group w i l l offer appropriate TA - 
with, if requested, a specific focus on political economy constraints - to support the operationalization of 
sector strategies. 

* Paragraph 15 o f the Accra Agenda for Ac t ion states that “Donors agree to use country systems as the first option for aid 
programs i n support o f activities managed by the public sector [ . . . ] Should donors choose to use another option and re ly on aid 
delivery mechanisms outside country systems (including parallel project implementation units), they w i l l transparently state the 
rationale for this and w i l l review their positions at regular intervals.”

Appendix 2: PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 

L ines of engagement of the Wo r ld Bank and the IFC over the CPS 2010 -2014 period 

Private sector development, competitiveness and the structural transformation o f the Moroccan 
economy: 

I. Private sector development in Morocco: progress in reforms, the new sectoral approach and the 
persistence o f old challenges 

1. 
Over the past decade, M o r o c c o has made a lot o f progress in business environment reforms. 
The private sector has responded to these reforms, but productivity, export diversification and 
technological intensity lag other emerging countries. The needed structural transformation o f the 

Moroccan economy i s not yet happening. Since the business environment reforms accelerated in the 
mid-nineties, private investment rates increased from 1 5 percent to 22 percent currently - a rate that 
compares to the ones in the most dynamic economies. The attractiveness o f FDI has also been strong. 
However, most o f this rise in private investment has occurred outside o f the manufacturing sector (figure 
A2 .1) - mostly in real estate, tourism and services. In fact, 72 percent o f manufacturing value-added and 
77 percent o f exports in 2008 were o f low technological intensity. Even i f entrepreneurship has flourished 
over the past years - business entry rates increased from 8 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2007, most o f 
i t i s either in low-value added activities or in non-tradable rea l estate, services and construction sectors. I n 
manufacturing, fewer f i r m s are created than was the case twenty years ago, fewer export (20 percent in 
2007 compared to 27 percent in 1995), and new f i r m s are l e s s productive than older f i r m s . The 
concentration o f private investment in lower value-added activities explain why Morocco lags other 
countries in labor productivity: in 2007, i t represented only 20 percent o f the average labor productivity in 
manufacturing in the OECD, and about 50 percent o f that in middle-income emerging countries.

A l l these are symptoms o f weak creative destruction in the Moroccan economy, and therefore weaker 
economic and productivity growth prospects. N o emerging economy has been able to sustain high growth 
o f long periods o f time, without a profound structural transformation o f its economy made o f increased 
manufacturing exports and a more diversified and more technologically sophisticated private sector. This 
transformation i s not yet happening at a large scale in Morocco. 

62 

Appendix 2 

2. 
Such structural transformation o f the private sector requires a comprehensive and 
coordinated set o f policies in many areas: a stable macroeconomic environment; an improved business 
environment - including in the area o f infrastructure and in regulatory institutions that level the playing 
field; a trade policy that supports the competitiveness o f Moroccan products; a financial sector that better 
serves smaller firms; a labor force that i s better trained and effective soc ia l protection and labor market 
institutions. While progress in a l l these areas i s notable, there i s a strong need to increase the impact o f 
reforms and the response o f private investors to these reforms. Weaknesses remain in the business 
environment, especially in those areas - like regulatory reform - that require a lo t o f public agency 
coordination, and where a gap remains between the laws as they appear on the books and how they’re 
applied to individual investors. While export development plans are in place (Emergence and M a r o c 
E x p o r t ) and Morocco adopted an ambitious FTA agenda, some areas o f the trade policy - including trade 
logistics and trade finance - remain weak. Financial sector reforms have been impressive in Morocco, but 
there i s room fo r these reforms to trickle down to domestic SMEs that remain credit constrained. Finally, 
the employability o f Moroccan workers in a changing environment remains a critical problem in the labor 
market: firms which need to move up the value chain to remain competitive require better trained workers 
currently a scarce resource according to business surveys. In face o f this scarcity, the reform o f the 
education system i s only slowly improving the employability o f new job seekers. Improving the skills o f 
the labor force, the functioning o f labor market institutions and the effectiveness o f social protection i s 
paramount to help the structural transformation o f the Moroccan economy. 

3 , 
The global c r i s i s and its impact on Morocco’s balance o f payments i s also a reminder o f the 
need to diversify and enlarge the country’s export base. Manufacturing exports have grown at 8 
percent per year on average since 2002 - half the performance o f emerging middle-income countries. The 
contents o f exports i s also symptomatic o f the slow structural transformation o f the Moroccan economy: 
out o f its 20 most important exports, only one was in an activity growing in global trade and where 
Morocco i s gaining world market share. Also, exports are not diversified enough: Morocco exports 42 
products per one million inhabitants, compared to 130 fo r Tunisia and 160 for Malaysia (figure A2.2). 
Yet, this trend has improved lately with the growth o f exports o f services and new niches in electronics 
and car parts. 

4. 
The new industrial strategy i n place bets on further growth of these emerging sectors 
(offshoring, electronics, aeronautics, car parts) and other, more established exports (e.g. textile, 
agribusiness, tourism) - hence its name, Emergence . To increase private investment, exports and job 
creation, the government has launched a s e r i e s o f sectoral plans (most notably in tourism and industry). 
These consist mainly o f tax incentives to specific sectors, combined with dedicated infrastructure 
investments. The roll-out o f the 2005-2008 P r o g r amm e Emergence has been mainly focused on the 
offshoring and textile sectors. I t has also given strong signals to the automobile and aeronautic sectors 
which have benefited from notable foreign investments over the recent years.

5 . 
Looking forward, the challenge w i l l be in the implementation and coordination o f all the 
policies that affect private sector development-in 
particular to address persistent transversal 
constraints in the business environment that affect mostly domestic SMEs. The success o f a l l the 
sectoral programs (in industry, trade, agriculture, tourism, skills development, etc.) w i l l depend on the 
ability o f the government to coordinate, implement and evaluate policies at various levels and through 
various agencies. This has proven to be especially difficult in the past when strong inter-agency 
coordination i s required. A l l these interventions and support plans are also heavily constrained by 
remaining transversal issues in the business environment: the availability o f skills; access to land and 
finance for SMEs; rules and regulations - and especially their implementation by the administrations in 
charge - that are cumbersome and often arbitrarily and inconsistently applied; and a weak judiciary. 
Recently, the new ambitious public-private Pacte national pour 1 'Emergence Industrielle was 
launched to address these transversal issues and sectoral plans in a coordinated manner. New inter- 
ministerial commissions have been created to improve coordination. As with previous plans and 
commissions, the main challenge w i l l be in their implementation. 

11. Wor ld Bank Group support f o r a more competitive private sector i n Morocco 

6 . 

Over the CPS horizon, the Wo r ld Bank and the I F C w i l l continue to support-in 
a 
coordinated and complementary way - the Moroccan government i n its private sector development 
policies, specifically i n the areas of business environment, trade, financial sector development and 
public-private partnerships. This support w i l l take the form o f : (i) technical assistance and policy 
advice by both institutions - some o f i t done jointly; (ii) policy-based lending by the World Bank; and, 
(iii) investments and lending by IFC to private entities, and possibly transaction-based advice in the area 
o f public-private partnership. This jo in t appendix describes the challenges o f private sector development 
in Morocco, focusing on the four areas above. I n view o f the Government current policies, i t also 
describes the type o f cooperation and support that w i l l be provided by both arms o f the World Bank 
Group during the duration o f the CPS. 

7. 
The guiding principles o f the Wor ld Bank Group engagement in the private sector 
development are consistent to the pillars and overall approach o f the CPS: I t w i l l be flexible to be 
responsive to government requests and emerging priorities; and selective, by focusing on higher impact 
activities that are in line with the most important business environment issues facing the private sector. 

64 

Appendix 2 

The Bank-IFC activities w i l l also be consistent with the strategic pillars o f the CPS. Supporting private 
sector development by improving the trade and business environment i s at 
the core o f the 
competitiveness-growth-employment challenge o f the Moroccan economy (pillar 1). Similarly, 
supporting the development o f public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the soc ia l sectors w i l l contribute to 
improving the delivery o f social services to citizens, as to improving access to financial services o f the 
poor (pillar 2) . PPPs in the infrastructure sectors w i l l also help the Moroccan government in responding to 
the infrastructure needs o f its economy ( in water, energy and transport for example), in a sustainable way 
(pillar 3). As w i l l be argued in section 3 below, governance issues-a 
transversal theme that i s common 
to a l l three pillars o f the CPS, appear prominently in the private sector development agenda. 

111. 

IBRD and I F C complementary roles in investment and advisory projects 

8 . 

The successful experience of cooperation between the two institutions over the past years 
w i l l be carried on during the next CPS period. The Bank has usually taken the lead in strategic 
analytical exercises (like the investment climate assessments) or policy advice, while the IFC - through its 
Advisory Services activities - has been focusing on more operational assistance, supporting the 
implementation o f reforms. The key has been a jo in t involvement at the initial stages o f every 
engagement, and c lose coordination during every TA or ESW project, including at the design stage. Bank 
s t a f f involved in analytical work has systematically been involved in the initial conceptual phase o f 
advisory projects. Inversely, IFC was systematically consulted and involved in the preparation o f 
analytical pieces by the World Bank. 

9. 
Du r ing the next CPS period, such collaboration w i l l continue to target areas of strategic 
focus. In particular, IFC’s investment strategy in Morocco w i l l complement the Bank’s strategic priorities 
in the infrastructure sectors. I n the area o f public-private partnerships-an 
area where WBG support has 
been requested by the government, the Bank w i l l support the government in the development o f an 
adequate legal framework (in specific sectors, or a t the.broader level). The IFC could provide advisory 
support in specific PPP transactions, or be an investor itself in public-private ventures. This support could 
be provided along the l i n e s o f IFC’s landmark PPP advisory transaction in the irrigation sector in the 
Guerdane region in Morocco.

IFC’s engagement in M o r o c c o and current strategy 

10. 
I F C has significantly picked up its activities in Morocco and currently has a committed 
portfolio o f USS272.5 million in 12 companies. During the period FY08-09, IFC committed a record 
US$255 in seven projects in multiple sectors in Morocco, such as commercial banks, microfinance, 
wastewater public utilities, investment funds for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), property 
development in low income housing and building materials sector. While IFC has historically had a 
selective approach in Morocco due to the availability o f alternative sources o f financing, IFC has stepped 
up i t s activities and been positioning i t s e l f on strategic investments and partnerships, with clear 
additionality and role. 
IFC’s engagement i s predominantly in financial markets ( 5 3% o f to ta l 
commitments), including microfinance providing much needed access to finance to the poorer segments 
o f the population and in general manufacturing (35% o f commitments). 

11 . 
I F C has also developed a sizeable advisory program i n Morocco, with a focus on (a) 
promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to improving the business environment - with the 
Ministry o f Justice; (b) helping identify public-private partnerships in key infrastructure sectors - with the 
Ministry o f Finance; (c) simplifying business creations starting with the city o f Casablanca; and (d) 
strengthening credit information and SME finance, through the establishment o f a private credit bureau -

with the Central Bank. In addition, IFC i s providing advisory work to Morocco’s microfinance sector as 
part o f i t s investment packages. 

12. 

Despite competitive market conditions and availability o f other sources o f financing, I FC 
can still play a significant financing role f o r large investments exceeding the capacity o f domestic 
banks or for innovative projects requiring complex structuring through the use o f equity, quasi-equity and 
structured f inance products. IFC’s value-added also l i e s in i t s global expertise combined with a good 
loca l presence and image in the market. With a more vibrant private sector environment and important 
developments in key sectors, IFC has increased opportunities and can play a key ro le in the f inanc ia l 
sector, in infrastructure, and in the manufacturing, and agribusiness sectors. 

1 3 . 

Looking forward to the CPS period, and in line w ith the principle o f additionality and ro le , 
IFC’s investments w i l l focus on the infrastructure sectors (power, ports, renewable energy, 
transport, and utilities sectors), financial sector (microfinance and SMEs) as well as select 
investments i n manufacturing, agribusiness, education activities and municipal/local finance. This 
investment strategy w i l l be aligned with the priority activities o f the World Bank in these sectors and w i l l 
complement the technical assistance and financial support the Bank intends to provide along the three 
pillars. IFC’s potential infrastructure investments in energy, utilities or the ports, as well as selected 
investments in Emergence’s sectors, would contribute to the growthhompetitiveness agenda o f the CPS 
(pillar 1). Potential investments in the education and microfinance sectors would help in improving 
financial and education services to citizens, especially the most disadvantaged (pillar 2). Finally, the focus 
on potential investments in renewable energy and the power sector w i l l contribute to reaching the 
objectives o f the third pillar o f the CPS for sustainable development and the climate change agenda (pillar 
3). 

14. 
I F C w i l l also continue focusing on South-South investments and building strategic 
partnerships w ith regional players. Given that Morocco i s increasingly investing in the region, namely 
in West and East Africa, IFC would like to accompany Moroccan companies’ expansion in A f r icd IDA 
countries, along the lines o f IFC’s recent investment in BMCE Bank, targeting the bank’s expansion into 
1 1 Sub Saharan African countries. 

1 5 . 
I n complement t o its investment activities, IFC’s Advisory Services i n M E N A w i l l also 
continue to provide advisory services to improving the business enabling environment, building 
capacity o f f inanc ia l intermediaries to lend to MSMEs and encouraging public private partnerships in 
infrastructure. 

I V . Getting specific: pr ior ity areas o f engagement 

A. 

Improv ing the business environment f o r a l l firms and leveling the playing field 

Current challenges and po l ic ies : 
16. 
Diversifying the economy w i l l require improving the business environment through 
complex and in-depth reforms o f the legal, regulatory and administrative frameworks, which 
restrict access o f new entrants to the market while favoring established incumbents. The ability o f 
the government to carry on complex investment climate reforms w i l l be essential to address this 
challenge. Despite the many reforms carried on over the past decade, there seems to be a growing gap 
between the government ability to launch and adopt new legislations and regulations, and its ability to 
design adequately and implement key reforms that could actually make a difference for the private 
sector. Several key constraints in the business environment remain problematic for firms. Access to land 

66 

Appendix 2 

remains a pending and binding constraint to firm growth-and more so for exporters, as i s tax rates. I n 
spite o f several reductions, Morocco has one o f the highest corporate tax rates in the world and the 
existing tax regime penalizes the recruiting o f skilled workers-a 
scarce resource according to firms. 
More generally, administrative procedures and the judicial system lack transparency and need to be 
better managed to avoid corruption (a growing constraints for a representative panel o f businesses 
interviewed both in 2004 and 2007 -one that a f fec ts disproportionally more smaller domestic firms), 
discretion and privileges to connected businesses. A consequence o f a constraining business 
environment, corruption and poor property rights enforcement, i s the uneven playing field in the 
business place-competition from the informal sector and monopolistic situations o f a few large 
incumbents hurt the development o f some sectors and the emergence o f new industrial players. These 
issues are consistently rated in firm surveys as the most important constraints to businesses (figure 
A2.4).

M a n y o f these constra ints-corrupt ion , administrative uncertainty, enforcement o f the 
rules and the judiciary-relate 
to issues o f governance o f market institutions. Whether it i s with the 
judiciary, the discretionary enforcement o f regulations by the public administrations, the independence 
and efficacy o f market regulatory institutions-in particular in ensuring fair competition and a leveled 
playing field; or the control o f corruption, the private sector development agenda i s fundamentally 
charged by governance challenges. The link with other priority topics o f the CPS where the government 
have requested Bank support i s clearest i n the area o f judicial reform. The judicial system, through 
commercial courts, should play a key role in the development o f commercial transactions by providing a 
predictable and reliable mechanism for the resolution o f commercial dispute. Since commercial courts 
have been established in 1997, progress towards a professional and secured judicial system has been slow.

19. 
Recently, the government has developed a new comprehensive approach to private sector 
development, that aims at addressing past weaknesses in the conduct o f partial, uncoordinated 
reforms. By formally adopting in February 2009 the “National Pact o f Industrial Emergence - Pacte 
National pour I ’Emergence Industrielle ( PN E I , Contrat Programme 2009-2015” , the government has 
established a public private agreement aimed at undertaking 1 1 1 specific commitments over the period 
2009-20 15, taken both by ministries (Justice, Interior, Economy and Finance, Agriculture and Fishing, 
Education and research, Labor and Training, Industry, Commerce and New Technologies, International 
Trade, Economic and General Affairs) and representatives o f private sector organizations (CGEM, Banks’ 
Professional Organization GPBM) signatories to the Agreement. These commitments are gathered under 
10 different pillars: Off-shoring, Automobile, Aeronautic, Electronics, Textile and Leather, Agro- 
Industry, SME Competitiveness, Investment Climate, Training, Industrial Zones). 

20. 
The government’s strategic plan for private sector development i s a mix between sector- 
specific policies and comprehensive investment climate reforms. Its first axis o f measures i s sector- 
specific, and focuses on the sectors previously identified in the Emergence 2005 program. The second 
axis i s aimed at addressing cross-cutting constraints under the “Investment Climate” PNEI pillar. Under 
this second axis, the government i s establishing a Public Private committee for business environment 
(“Comite National de I’Environnement des Affaires” - CNEA) in charge o f identifying economic reform 
projects and overseeing their actual implementation through improved inter-ministerial coordination 
mechanisms. This committee i s headed by the Prime Minister. Its participants and working groups follow 
a common methodology and approach to the reform, in order to address the coordination issues that 
plagued the ability o f previous reform committees to deliver on otherwise well-designed action plans. 

World Bank engagement: 

2 1. 
The objective of the Bank support in the area of private sector development i s to promote a 
business environment favorable to new entrants, in particular to small and medium domestic firms. 
To this end, for the duration o f the CPS, the Bank w i l l assist the government in reducing the current 
unpredictability and opaqueness o f the legal, administrative and judicial aspects o f i t s business 
environment, which tend to favor well-established investors. Promoting transparency and accessibility o f 
laws, regulations, circulars, and procedures that shape the Morocco’s business environment w i l l therefore 
be a priority o f Bank’s assistance. An action plan o f priority legal and regulatory reforms has recently 
been adopted by the CNEA Committee and the government has solicited World Bank Group support to 
the different reform teams in charge o f implementing it. This action plan w i l l form the basis o f the 
cooperation between the World Bank Group and the government o f Morocco in the area o f investment 
climate reforms. 

22. 

I n addition, the Bank w i l l assist the government in setting up an organized, efficient and 
participatory reform process. This assistance w i l l aim at developing a well-managed use o f consultation 
mechanisms and economic analysis for preparing projects. U s e o f monitoring and evaluation tools w i l l 
also be promoted as essential too ls for measuring progress o f investment climate reforms. Consultation 
process, economic impact analysis and monitoring too ls w i l l be used and designed to measure the 
satisfaction o f end-users on government’s policy and administrative services. 

23 . 
I n line w ith these priorities, several technical assistance activities are envisaged fo r the CPS 
period: 

0 Continuing the current activity aimed a t assisting the MAEG in coordinating and implementing 
reform processes in the business environment area, through the development o f the CNEA, and 
focusing on the 20 - item investment climate action plan. 

69 

Appendix 2 

Assessing and prioritizing the reform needs o f the business environment - The Bank w i l l assist 
the government in preparing detailed and prioritized annual reform programs fo r private sector 
development. 

0 Launching a regulatory simplification project - A project aimed at identifying, analyzing and 
simplifying a l l administrative and regulatory procedures for businesses. This technical assistance 
project, based on a specifically-tailored regulatory simplification approach developed by the Bank 
and other international institutions, could have a major impact on the quality o f administrative 
services and the easiness to do business in Morocco. 
Improving the governance o f enterprises - Following the adoption o f a non-binding code o f 
corporate governance for enterprises, next steps could focus on a detailed assessment o f 
governance framework and practices for listed companies. This assessment would allow 
disseminating international best practices for corporate behavior and initiate reforms aimed a t 
further developing the use o f financial markets by private sector. 

24. 
I n addition to the technical assistance activities, a comprehensive approach to the trade and 
competitiveness issue could take the form o f a Competitiveness Development Policy Loan that would 
integrate an investment climate pillar as well as a trade and competitiveness pillar. Such a project would 
support the different policy initiatives that are ongoing in Morocco, and which aim at increasing and 
diversifying the export base in face o f the structural deterioration o f the balance o f payments. 

I F C engagement: 

25. 
The I F C w i l l continue to focus on developing investment and lending opportunities in 
support o f the new industrial and agriculture strategies o f M o r o c c o . Mo rocco ’s industrial and 
agricultural strategies aim at anchoring the country’s strategy to supporting the emergence o f world-class 
firms in a select number o f sectors where Morocco’s comparative advantages are deemed substantial: (i) 
agribusiness; (ii) light automotive and aerospace manufacturing; ( i i i ) f ishe r ies ; (iv) business process 
outsourcing; (v) electronics; and (vi) industrial “handicrafts”. Modernization o f these industries to 
become internationally competitive could o f fe r investment opportunities fo r IFC. 

26. 
I n the area of advisory activities, IFC ’s Advisory Services in the M E N A region, w i l l 
continue to support business environment reforms, in close coordination with the Wo r ld Bank. The 
IFC w i l l focus on areas that require field expertise in regulatory reform, and process reengineering for 
regulatory simplification. IFC’s support w i l l be selective reflecting availability o f donor financing and 
additionality. Moreover, in support to the second pillar o f the Judicial Reform Ian o f Morocco (this six- 
pillar major reform was announced by K ing Mohammed V I on August 20‘, 
2009), IFC’s Advisory 
Services in MENA w i l l further i t s support to the development o f alternative dispute resolutions systems 
(as arbitration and mediation), starting with capacity building o f a mediation and arbitration center in 
Casablanca. 

B. 

Improving trade and competitiveness to r ip the gains o f openness and FTAs 

Cu r ren t challenges and po l ic ies : 

27. 
M o r o c c o strives to use trade policy to boost growth and job creation by expanding markets 
f o r Moroccan goods and services and transforming Morocco into an investment and production 
platform for global investors wanting shift production processes to competitive and logistically efficient 
s i tes . However, current efforts have not yet led to robust export performance nor accelerated significantly 

70 

Appendix 2 

the structural transformation o f the economy. Furthermore, the preferential stance in trade liberalization i s 
increasing t a r i f f dispersion leading to trade diversion and providing incentives for fraud. 

28. 
Export performance i s below expectations, leading to forgone growth and job creation 
opportunities. Export grew by only 93% between 2000 and 2008 against more than 300% for the MENA 
and East Asia regions in the same period. Because global trade grew robustly in that period, Morocco lost 
world market share in merchandise exports. Despite the signing o f a large number o f preferential trade 
agreements, the geography o f export destination has not changed significantly yet. Morocco s t i l l ships 
75% o f i t s exports to the EU, only a few percentage points lower than in 2000. Exports to MENA, SSA 
and the USA are s t i l l low. Overall, producers tend to be small and medium enterprises facing many 
constraints in their environment that make them ill-prepared to take advantage o f the opportunities offered 
by the global market. These constraints include access to finance, unfair competition with the informal 
sector, macroeconomic instability, etc. Exporting i s a sustainable activity for only a fraction o f SMEs in 
Morocco. 

(Percentage o f manufacturing firms that export.) 

Figure A2.7 Declining proportion o f firms that export. 

29. 
Lackluster export performance led to worsening trade balance. The trade deficit increased 
from $3.2 billion in 2000 to $14.1 billion in 2007. However, Morocco has been able to maintain current 
account surpluses thanks to strong 
services exports ($12.1 billion in 2007) 
and net private transfers ($7.7 billion in 
2007). Morocco thus does not have a 
structural external balance/ financing 
need problem. This i s a l l the more so 
that FD I has been growing 
fast, 
reaching $2.8 billion in 2007 or 3.7% 
o f GDP against $220 m i l l ion or 0.6% 
o f GDP in 2000. The main issue i s that 
export has not played the growth and 
job creation engine i t has the potential 
to play, and this has slowed down the 
structural 
transformation o f 
the 
economy. A sign o f this 
i s that 
relatively fewer firms have engaged in 
exports over the past years (figure A2.7).

30. 
The pace o f structural transformation/ diversification i s indeed slow. The technological 
content o f export i s progressing (32% o f total in 2008 against 22% in 2000) but Moroccan exports are s t i l l 
highly concentrated in low-value added or primary export products (60 percent). The l i t t l e in the way o f 
increase in technological content o f export i s due to rising FD I in aeronautics and mechanical 
engineering. However, F D I to industry remains limited (5% o f the total in 2008) as the bulk o f foreign 
investment in Morocco goes to construction (30%), tourism (19%) and banking (13%). The extent of 
diversification i s highly dependent on FD I and in the years to come, Morocco should strive to attract more 
FD I in industries. This would be an important instrument to reduce unemployment o f educated and highly 
skilled would-be workers. Without a shift i n labor demand in favor o f highly qualified jobs, trade 
integration w i l l not be able to help employment. 

3 1 , 
T a r i f f dispersion i s creating distortions and increasing incentives for fraud on the origin o f 
goods. Morocco’s commitment to further opening o f its market, notably by implementing the Association 
Agreement with the EU, results i n widening ta r i f f gaps across import origins. The preferential 
liberalization w i l l reduce import tariffs vis-a-vis the EU, and bring the overall average o f effectively 
applied duties further down. However, the MFN ta r i f fs towards third countries w i l l not automatically 

7 1 

Appendix 2 

follow the path o f the EU and phase-out schedule agricultural tariffs w i l l only be marginally affected, as a 
result o f their limited coverage in the Euro-Med Agreement. The increased wedges between agricultural 
and manufacturing tariffs, as well as disparities between manufacturing products originating in the EU 
and those originating in non-preferential trade partners may create trade diversion and fraud on origin. 
The la t te r would increase unfair competition in the domestic market and could undermine investment. 

32 . 
T o address the above challenges, M o r o c c o i s reducing trade and investment barriers and i s 
pursuing deeper preferential integration (Le., including some degree o f regulatory convergence) with 
external anchors through its Association Agreement with the EU (75% o f Moroccan trade) and a Free 
Trade Agreement with the USA. Shallower preferential agreements were signed with a large number o f 
partners, including the Arab League under GAFTA, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan under the AGADIR 
Agreement, Turkey and other bilateral partners. Significant progress i s being made in improving transport 
and logistics and the efficiency o f backbone services (ports, air transport, telecommunications and 
financial services). More recently, Morocco has elaborated sectoral strategies to attract foreign investment and 
strengthen production in key strategic sectors such as aeronautics, offshoring o f services, automobile components, 

etc. 

World Bank and IFC engagement: 

3 3 . 
The Wo r ld Bank Group intends to support Morocco’s above trade integration policies, and 
w i l l focus on five interdependent outcomes/results: i) t a r i f f and non-tariff reforms on an MFN basis; ii) 
further investment climate reforms to enhance the capacity o f SME to exploit opportunities offered by the 
global market; i i i ) hrther reduction o f barriers to trade and investment in services and regulatory 
convergence with the EU in selected areas o f Morocco’s interest; iv) export promotion and v) 
modernization o f Morocco’s innovation system. These areas are crucial if trade integration i s to foster 
greater competitiveness and job creation and to contribute to a transition to a knowledge-based, skill- 
intensive and technology-based economy. 

34 . 
I t i s important to view these five pillars o f the trade integration strategy as integrated and to 
attempt to make progress i n a l l o f them to maximize impact. The whole i s greater than the sum o f i t s 
individual parts. One o f the key potential benefits o f Bank’s involvement w i l l be to help better integrate 
the different elements o f Morocco’s trade and investment strategy. 

3 5 . 
Effectively supporting M o r o c c o i n the above five areas could be done through tw o ma in 
instruments. First, through the potential Competitiveness Development Policy Loan, which could 
include a trade and integration pillar that would support, in an integrated fashion, measures to: 

Reduce trade transaction costs through tariff reforms, convergence to EU product and quality 
standards and reduction o f time and cost to trade through selective and streamlined technical 
controls o f imports and e-governance o f trade procedures; 
Improve trade finance and trade insurance to facilitate the penetration o f new markets 
Assist in implementing the services trade reforms scheduled in the Morocco-USA Free Trade 
Agreement 
Further encourage investment and trade in services by reducing the regulatory and policy 
bottlenecks faced by firms in emerging exporting sectors. 
The development o f new export promotion instruments, the modernization and streamlining o f 
trade-support and innovation-support institutions. 

7 2 

Appendix 2 

3 6 . 
Second, i t will be important to continue Bank support to build adequate technical capacity and 
tools to support and monitor the trade strategy. T h e Bank's capacity building efforts in recent years 
successful helped strengthen capacity at the Ministry o f Foreign trade. However, while t h e tools recently 
developed by the Ministry have increased their capacity to inform policy (the IMPALE MODELE), fbrther 
support i s needed for the current models to address emerging issues such as the impact o f the Emergence Plan 
and the structural transformation o f the economy. Additional technical assistance to improve the IMPALE 
MODELE (Ministry o f Foreign Trade) and enhance capacity in other relevant Ministries i s warranted. T h e Bank 
w i l l also continue its technical support in the areas o f trade logistics and trade in agriculture. 

3 7 . 
The IFC's will complement World Bank activities in the trade area through its advisory support 
in the business environment area. Also, potential investments in ports activity or logistical platforms in 
Morocco would also contribute to improving the trade logistics in f ias truc ture o f the Kingdom. 

C. 

Support to financial sector reform 

Current challenges and policies: 

3 8 . 
Morocco's p r ima ry objective i n the financial sector i s to ensure an efficient and stable 
financing o f the evolving needs of its economy - Following a major modernization e f fo r t spearheaded 
by the Moroccan authorities, the financial system appears well positioned to address upcoming challenges 
thanks to i t s development (with assets totaling almost twice the GDP), the existence o f key market 
mechanisms, a good diversification among sectors compared to regional peers and a restructured state- 
owned financial sector. The Moroccan financial system i s increasingly opening up and building t i e s with 
neighboring economies. Financial institutions have not been directly affected by the global financial 

c r i s i s .

3 9 . While improving access o f poorer households and smaller firms to modern financial 
services. Morocco's commercial banks are among the more sophisticated in MENA and offer a wide 
range o f financial services through specialized subsidiaries. However, they are mostly geared towards 
serving big corporations, a segment which i s reaching saturation. A large portion o f the population i s not 
being served by this banking system (bank penetration rate stands at a low 25-30 percent). Similarly, in 
the corporate world, despite the progress o f the recent years in terms o f firm access to credit, too many 

7 3 

Appendix 2 

SMEs remain credit-constrained, and large proportions o f them consistently ra te “Lack o f access to 
finance” among their top constraints - even i f that proportion declined s i n c e 2004 (figure A2.8). 

40. 
The financial sector first challenge i s to keep improving its provision o f financial services to 
a l l Moroccan economic agents: 

Meeting growing needs for long term finance (investment projects, housing etc.). Banks have 
been active in providing long term loans in the past few years, when funding was easy. They still 
bear most o f these long term risks, which reduces their leeway to make new loans, and face a 
more challenging funding environment, as the financial system i s less flush with liquidity. 
Moreover, although the size o f Moroccan institutional investors bodes well for the potential 
development o f long term instruments (long term bonds, securitization etc.), this potential i s not 
yet tapped on a large scale, either by financial institutions or by other companies. 

Ensuring that SMEs as well as a wider proportion o f Moroccan citizens can have access to 
financial services ( e g about a third o f Moroccan individuals have access to banking products). 
SME finance i s c r i t ica l for the Moroccan economy considering SMEs’ contribution to growth and 
employment. Additional progress i s s t i l l needed ( in terms o f availability, advice, venture capital 
etc.). 

41. 

A second challenge relates to the ongoing modernization of the financial infrastructure, 
including the supervisory framework, to sustain the development of the financial sector while 
preserving i t s safety: 

Ensuring that capital market and insurance sector’s supervision can be carried out at arm’s length, 
from the government and from the industry. I n a more complex, globaly integrated and market 
driven environment, the independence o f the insurance and, to a lesser extent, securities 
supervisors need to be bolstered. They would provide strong foundations on which to improve the 
regulation and supervision o f these industries, 

Implementing the new Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing o f Terrorism 
( AM L /CFT) regime across the financial sector. 

42. 
The Moroccan authorities prepared a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges. 
In a speech delivered in July 2008, the Minister o f Economy and Finance presented this strategy, which 
includes second generation reforms after state-owned financial institutions were restructured, banking 
supervision dramatically improved and key financial infrastructure modernized. I t incorporates 
recommendations made during the 2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP): 

Bolstering the provision o f long term finance by (1) the promotion o f long term savings 
(especially by individuals), (2) more efficient market mechanisms (long term benchmark yield 
curve, revised securitization framework etc.) and (3) a better coordination among state-owned 
financial institutions. More risk sensitive regulation for the insurance and pension sectors may 
also increase their demand for long dated products, making i t eas ier to place long term debt, 

Promoting access to finance for individuals and improving further SME finance thanks to: (1) a 
revamp o f public support mechanisms for SME finance, (2) the modernization o f the financial 
services o f the Post office, so that it can o f f e r a broader range o f services to i t s many customers 
(13% o f Moroccans), (3) the set up o f a credit bureau which w i l l be fully operational by 
September 2009, and (4) a review o f the framework applicable to the microfinance sector, 

74 

Appendix 2 

Modernizing securities markets with (1) the creation o f an organized market for derivative 
products, designed to help economic agents hedge their financial risks, (2) a diversification o f the 
shareholding o f the stock exchange beyond brokers , (3) a reform o f the regulatory framework for 
asset management and (4) the strengthening o f the securities supervisor’s independence, 

Creating a fully independent insurance supervisor ( in lieu o f the current division o f the Ministry 
o f Economy and Finance), 

Implementing the AM L /CFT regime across the industry, 

Continuing the international opening o f the Moroccan financial sector. Contemplated measures 
include (1) a further liberalization o f the capital account, (2) an increased flexibility o f the 
exchange rate and (3) more financial integration with Maghreb countries as well as other 
neighbors (European Union, African countries etc.). 

43 . 

These measures should also help enhance the resilience o f the financial system, thanks to (i) 
better regulation and supervision, ( i i ) improved risk management possibilities (development o f long term 
compartments, new market etc.) and ( i i i ) enhanced operational coordination among financial sector 
authorities. 

World Bank engaRement: 

44. 
The Wo r ld Bank w i l l continue to support the authorities i n addressing these challenges. 
Beyond the assistance provided at the time o f the first f inanc ia l sector Development Policy Loan (DPL, 
2005) and during the latest FSAP (2007), the World Bank i s working with the Moroccan authorities on: 
(1) identifying key areas in the securities sector where progress could be made to meet the best 
international standards; and (ii) on strengthening f inanc ia l stability arrangements. 

45 . 
The Wo r ld Bank i s also exploring the possibility o f providing additional lending through a 
new financial sector DPL which would support the authorities’ reform agenda. I n this context, the World 
Bank w i l l provide assistance in the form o f analytical work to help design the specifics o f the reform 
agenda. 

46. 
The contemplated financial sector DPL i s a key element o f the CPS program. I t would be 
built around four pillars:

Consistent with the overall financial sector reform agenda of the Government, I F C w i l l 
continue its support via its advisory services as well as through strategic investments in financial 
institutions, including microfinance institutions and possibly SME finance instruments. On the 
investment side, IFC w i l l continue to look fo r opportunities to invest in f inanc ia l institutions that aim at 
developing low income banking and to supporting the emergence o f some banks as regional players. In 
terms o f advisory activities, technical support to strengthen the credit information infrastructure w i l l 
continue to be provided to the central bank and possibly to specific banks. Other potential advisory 
activities include capacity building to financial institutions in risk management, modern SME lending 
techniques and credit scoring. 

D. 

Public-private partnerships f o r more efficient service delivery and responding to 
infrastructure needs 

Current challenges and policies: 

49. 
Morocco has developed a valuable experience in PPPs during the past decade. In many 
aspects, i t has been a pioneer in the use o f PPPs in the MENA region. Sectors as diverse as power 
generation, water and electricity distribution, urban transport, waste management, container terminals, 
irrigation, among others, have seen one or more PPPs developed and implemented. In contrast to other 
developing countries where fo r instance water concessions were canceled or renegotiated soon after 
approvals, water and electricity distribution concessions in Morocco have passed the t e s t o f time and have 
performed well in achieving their development objectives. 

50. 

The number o f public-private partnerships involving municipalities significantly increasedg 
over the past decade, even though the government did not establish a modern PPP framework until 
2005. Urban transport concessions were issued to private bus companies in Casablanca, Rabat, 
Marrakech, and Agadir by the end o f the 1980s. This surge o f interest in private participation in 
infrastructure was driven by two main consideration: (i) tighter f isca l space constraints significantly 
limited the central government ability to cope with the growing infrastructure needs o f the economy and 
the soc ie ty ; and ( i i ) the decentralization agenda that led to the consolidation o f municipalities as primary 
responsible entities for the delivery/supply o f local public infrastructure services such as water and 
electricity distribution, sewage, solid waste collection and management, s tree ts lighting, urban transport 
services to municipalities. In this regards, municipalities can opt to deliver these services through 
municipal owned utilities or by contracting out to private sector. 

5 1 . 

However, despite this breadth o f experiences, Mo ro c co ’ s use o f PPPs remains an ad hoc 
process, lacking a strategic vision and constrained by a number of shortcomings. Morocco’s use o f 
PPPs remains significantly below potential. As o f to date, the implementation o f PPPs projects have been 
highly fragmented and decentralized. I t i s crucial to move from this piecemeal approach into a more 
comprehensive and integrated approach that aims to the development o f a vibrant PPP market in 
Morocco. The development o f PPPs in Morocco remains constrained by: 

Water and electricity distribution: Casablanca ( l997 ) , Rabat (1999), Tanger and Tetouan (2002). I n Solid waste management: 
around 15 collection service contracts ( 5 years duration), and few BOT contracts for landfills management. In urban transport - 
numerous service concession agreements are in place for urban bus transportation services i n cities. 

76 

Appendix 2 

Lack of a clear PPP visionary approach - i t has now become urgent that the government 
prepares and publishes a PPP policy paper that outlines its visionary approach about PPPs and 
how i t intends to strengthen the existing PPP framework, and implement the next generation o f 
PPP projects. 
Incomplete PPP legal and regulatory framework - bylaws and executive regulations o f Law 
54-05 have not been issued four years after its enactment. Further, law 54-05 has provided 
Morocco with a modern PPP legal framework which applies specifically to PPP projects 
undertaken by municipalities and state owned enterprises (ONEP, ONE, RAM, etc.). 
Unfortunately, Law 54-05 does not apply to PPPs that could be initiated directly by the central 
government. 

Institutional weaknesses in contracts oversight and enforcement - For instance: ( i ) most 
municipalities still lack capacity to prepare high quality PPP transactions and are dependent on 
the support mobilized by the Interior Ministry; (ii) municipalities are still ill equipped to exercise 
their oversight over PPP contracts and effective regulation o f PPP/concession contracts i s uneven 
depending on project; (iii) the sanctity o f the PPP contracts i s often breached by granting 
authorities therefore weakening the balanced commitments agreed in the contracts; (iv) in some 
sectors such as solid waste management, granting authorities often f a i l to appropriate adequate 
budgetary resources to service their payment commitments with the private operator; (v) tariffs 
are not automatically adjusted according to indexation formulae agreed in the contracts; and, (vi) 
PPP contracts as any other administrative contracts are subject to the external audit o f the “Cour 
des comptes” whereas modalities for such audits have not been defined. 
Weak coordination mechanism and lack o f a framework to manage PPP fiscal risks - The 
implementation o f PPPs i s highly decentralized whereas there i s a need to strengthen coordination 
in project preparation to ensure consistency o f contractual arrangements across sectors. The 
absence o f a dedicated PPP unit makes the whole process inefficient, non predictable and time 
costly. 

Absence of a reliable dispute resolution mechanism f o r PPP contracts - with the 
multiplication o f PPP contracts, there i s a need to establish a dedicated dispute resolution 
mechanism for PPPs besides the tribunal administrative. 

Mu lt ip l ic ity o f counterparts on the public party end (municipalities, Ministry o f Interior, 
Ministry o f Finance, etc.). 

e 

Regulatory uncertainty in regards o f transfer o f staff when there i s a change o f the equity 
investor (private party) in a given PPP/concession project (e.g.: renewal o f solid waste collection 
contracts for Agdal-Ryad in Rabat or E l Jadida). 

E. 

The Case f o r PPPs 

5 2 . 

The central argument in favor of PPPs i s tha t of efficiency gains. This essentially means tha t : ( a ) 
fo r new (green f ie ld) projects, a significant reduc t ion o f cons truc t ion risk - delays and cost overruns, 
es t ima ted t o a f fec t up t o 30% o f publicly procured projects; ( b ) fo r existing (b rown f ie ld ) projects, 
improved qua l i ty o f service and be t te r value fo r money, by leveraging the know -how o f pr iva te sector 
operators. Additional arguments for PPP include: 

77 

Appendix 2 

Better risk allocation: well structured PPPs can substantially transfer project risk to the private 
sector (construction, tra f f ic , environmental.. . etc.). 

M o r e accurate project costing for better decision-making: publicly-procured projects often benefit 
from embedded subsidies that are seldom accounted for in the decision-making process. 

0 Lower transaction costs for grantors: PPPs replace multiple contracts (construction, management, 
financing., .etc.) with a single concession agreement. 

Lower total project costs: greenfield PPP projects avoid significant upfront cash outlays while 
brownfield ones allow the monetization o f existing assets. Depending on the Government’s 
discount and reinvestment rates, this can lead to lower project cost (on an NPV basis). 

5 3 . 

Emp ir ica l studies conducted by the Bank and other institutions (OECD , 2007) suggest that 
as a Low Med ium Income Country in the M E N A region, M o r o c c o should allocate around 9.2 
percent o f its yearly GDP to meet the infrastructure demand needs” o f its economy and society. 
This effort i s required to expand and upgrade the existing infrastructure stock as well as to ensure its 
adequate maintenance. Expanding, upgrading and maintaining infrastructure systems i s made necessary 
by demographic and urbanization trends as well as by the transformation o f the economy. Assuming a 
2008 GDP o f MDH689 billion”, we estimate that Morocco w i l l need to invest about MDH64 billion’* 
yearly in infrastructure. Available information in Morocco suggests that the public and private sectors 
currently invest around MDH48 billion a year in in f ra~ t ruc tu re ’~ . This represents approximately 75 
percent o f what i s needed to sustain growth prospects. Therefore, Morocco faces an infrastructure 
investment gap o f about MDH20 billion a year, and the question facing the authorities i s how such a gap 
can be bridged without deepening public deficits? 
Given: (i) the country’s substantial infrastructure needs; and ( i i ) the need to maintain f i s c a l balance, the 
government can significantly benefit from a well-designed PPP initiative. I t would allow to: 

Avoid the large upfront costs o f greenfield infrastructure projects (e.g.: in power generation); 

0 Optimize the use o f public resources: not a l l projects are appropriate for private participation. A 
PPP initiative would allow the government to focus public spending on essential but none 
commercially viable projects. 

Reap the efficiency gains the private sector can provide: these would be decoupled from the 
government’s efforts to upgrade/modernize the country’s public sector. 

In the social sectors, stepping up Government’s efforts: PPPs in education or health allow the 
government to focus i t s resources on the provision o f education and health services, not the 
construction and operation o f f a c i l i t i e s . 
Improve the management and maintenance o f certain public infrastructure facilities, and reduce 
the distortionary role o f State-ownership in certain markets. For example, access o f firms to 

lo Sectors covered: Highways; Ports; Railways; Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution networks; Telecom; Water 
supply and sanitation. This assessment excludes other important economic and social infrastructure.

This ballpark estimate i s computed w i th data from the M in is try o f Finance but should be treated w i th caution, as a more robust 
analysis i s needed to estimate current infrastructure spending i n Morocco. A t first glance, available data shows that the public 
sector represents around 90% o f infrastructure investments i n Morocco.

industrial land remains a key constraint to business in Morocco , despite the public investments in 
numerous industrial zones across the country (Morocco i s the middle-income country where this 
access problem appears as the most severe in business surveys-figure A2 .9 ) . Expanding 
successful PPP transactions to more industrial zones should help reduce this constraint.

Unlocking the potential o f PPPs: contours o f a Morocco PPP In it iat ive 

54 . 
T o unlock the potential o f PPPs, addressing the above constraints i s key. However, PPPs 
also require learning by doing and accumulation o f experiences. With this in mind, a dual-track 

approach could be thought o f : 

A ) I n the short-term: the establishment o f a small PPP screening unit, at the level o f the Ministry o f 
Finance to jump-start the. This unit’s mission would be to identify straightforward, plain vanilla 
projects that are appropriate for PPP financing, in coordination with the implementing ministries 
or agencies. In this first phase, the objective should be to restrict public financing only to those 
projects that really warrant it. This unit can also centralize some essential support functions 
(contracting o f financial, legal and technical advisors). 

B) I n the medium to lone; term: the central PPP unit’s role and ambition may be extended further to 
include: (a) long-term infrastructure needs assessment for better planning; (b) PPP Policy 
formulation, i.e., the definition o f c r i te r ia for identifying projects suitable for PPP financing; (c) 
central support role for implementing agencies and municipalities; (d) identification and 
implementation o f the required reforms o f the country’s regulatory and f i s c a l frameworks to 
enable PPPs and (e) expanding the PPP frontier, in particular to the social sectors. 

World Bank engagement: 

5 5 . 

Wo r ld Bank support to PPP initiatives could be sector-specific and pa r t o f a project o r 
A A A activity (in the infrastructure sectors for example). I t could also be transversal and focused on 

helping the government o f Mo rocco address the PPP agenda in a comprehensive manner, through a 
central PPP unit. Specifically, i f the government dec ides to systematize the use o f PPPs in certain sectors, 
the World Bank could support i t via: 

79 

Appendix 2 

An assessment o f the infrastructure needs o f the Moroccan economy to sustain growth prospects 
o f 5 to 8 percent per year. The proposed study would review alternative financing options to 
address these needs. I t would explore strategic infrastructure projects that could be developed 
through PPPs, and provide recommendations for policy, legal and institutional changes to allow 
for the development o f more PPPs. 

A similar assessment o f potential leads for PPP operations, but in the social sectors (health or 
education). 

0 Technical Assistance to build capacity at the level o f the central government (in particular in the 
Ministry o f Economy and Finance and the Ministry o f Interior), or in sectoral ministries (like 
transport or energy) to improve the ability o f the public sector to identify opportunities for PPP, 
negotiate their terms, conduct economic analysis, supervise the service delivery and the partner’s 
compliance with the terms o f the PPP transaction. For example, in the Solid Waste sector, i t could 
build on the ongoing pilot, initiated with the Solid Waste DPL, to support the preparation o f a 
draft National standard bidding documents. The technical assistance could also take the form o f 
support to specific projects or transactions, in the upstream analysis. I t could also include support 
to improving the PPP legal and regulatory framework. 

5 6 . 

IFC engagement: 
The growth o f PPP transactions in Morocco offers many opportunities for I F C to play a 
r o l e either as an investor in specific projects, o r as an advisor. M o r e specifically, investment leads 
have been identified in a few areas and may concretize over the CPS period: 

0

I n the energy sector, the anticipated liberalization o f the power sector and in particular, plans for 
independent power generation and renewable energy could present key opportunities for IFC. 
Examples o f projects that could potentially benefit from PPP transactions include the thermal 
power station o f Terfaya, the potential Liquid natural gas terminal, the regionalization o f the 
electricity market with the development o f independent power production or power purchase 
agreement arrangements. Moreover, the anticipated development o f wind power-generation 
plants could o f fe r opportunities to extend the concession projects realized in the North of 
Morocco and in the Essaouira plant. 

In the education sector, opportunities could develop in the health and education sectors if the 
legal framework i s reformed. Specifically, the higher education sector could offer important 
opportunities for IFC investments, but important legal and regulatory constraints remain which 
limit the creation o f private universities that can o f fe r officially recognized diplomas in Morocco. 

In the transport sector, opportunities are also likely to arise from the large government-led 
infrastructure projects such as the Tanger Med Port. 

I n the water sector, new concessions are expected in a number o f c i t i e s (like Oujda or Beni 
Me l la l ) , to extend the experiences o f Tangiers, Casablanca and Rabat. BOTS are also expected for 
desalination plants. A l l should offer opportunities for IFC investments, in particular in terms o f 
sub-national lending. 

5 7 . 

Finally, the recent reforms o f the regulatory framework for solid waste management w i l l 
o f f e r opportunities f o r I F C support to PPPs in certain cities f o r new waste management plants. The 
IFC could also provide advisory support in specific PPP transactions along the lines o f IFC’s successful 
PPP advisory transaction in the irrigation sector in the Guerdane region in Morocco.

Introduction 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) reviews the Wor ld Bank 
Group’s program in Morocco fo r the FY06-09 period. I t reviews implementation o f the planned 
program se t out in the CAS document, as well as new activities introduced during the period. The 
flexibility introduced in implementation made important contributions to Morocco’s development. The 
experience o f implementation provides lessons which inform the new Country Partnership Strategy for 
FY10-13I4. 

11. 

National Development Objectives and CAS Relevance 

2. 
The CAS was based on government’s reform agenda that had been formulated in 2002. 
This agenda focused on employment-generating growth and the reduction o f poverty and exclusion. I t 
had the following focus areas: ( i ) continue implementing the ongoing Public Administration Reform 
Program; ( i i ) reduce geographic disparities and the rural-urban divide; ( i i i ) capitalize on the rapid 
emergence o f a restructured and resilient financial sector; (iv) intensify efforts to attract foreign direct 
investments in manufacturing, tourism and agro-industry; (v) continue to focus on the successful 
convergence program with the European Union; and (vi) mitigate rising social pressure linked with urban 
exclusion and rural isolation and expand the benefits o f growth to the population at large, particularly the 
young with school degrees and those living in extreme poverty. 

3 . 
The CAS reflected broad consultation w ith government at central and decentralized level, 
academia, private sector, civil society representatives and development partners. 
These 
consultations continued during implementation, fostering an environment o f adaptation o f the program to 
evolving national priorities. They became a vehicle for communication and knowledge exchange, in 
particular with c iv i l society, including w i th the opening o f Public Information Centers outside o f Rabat. 
The CAS was founded on four pillars: (i) improve competitiveness and the investment climate; (ii) 
increase access to basic services for poor and marginalized people; (iii) improve the educational system; 
and (iv) strengthen the management o f water resources, access to drinking water and sanitation services. 
Governance was the main cross-cutting theme in support o f the institutional reforms needed to improve 
the transparency, accountability and inclusiveness in the public sector. 

4. 
Morocco’s development agenda took on a broader mandate when a new government was 
appointed i n October 2007. I t s vision was one o f faster progress on growth, poverty eradication and 
social conditions. Over the following 18 months, i t identified sectoral and structural constraints, 
developed a se t o f sector strategies, and allocated budgetary funding to these priorities. The result i s an 

l 4 The analysis o f the CASCR i s based on reviews of: (a) por t fo l io implementation performance reports; (b) the last two 
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) and Aide-Memoires o f each project active during the CAS period; (c) 
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) o f projects completed during the CAS period, Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) 
Reviews o f ICRs, and Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Reviews, where available; (d) interviews w i th selected client 
counterparts; and, ( e ) self-assessments by the Country Team.

Appendix 3 

ambitious program of reforms, particularly in sectors identified as priority - education, health, water, 
energy, agriculture and justice. 

5 . 
The CAS Progress Report” sought to align the program w ith the government’s new vision. 
I t confirmed that the overall CAS objectives and pillars remained relevant and aligned with the country’s 
program. I t highlighted the importance o f selectivity and flexibility and adapted the program to meet 
Government requests in various sectors. This led to increased interest in engaging the Bank Group, 
leading to an increase in the number and diversity o f requests to complement the government’s own 
resources and those o f other development partners. Among the new activities supported by the Bank 
were the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), solid waste reform, energy sector reform, 
initial work on climate change, and early work to introduce conditional cash transfers in education. These 
areas have become major opportunities to contribute to national development outcomes through both 
lending and non-lending activities. The mix o f lending and non-lending interventions adapted 
accordingly. Lending was increasingly channeled through budget support, with Development Policy 
Loans (DPLs) reaching 6 7 percent o f total financing over the implementation period. Programmatic ESW 
was used to provide the analysis underpinning the reforms supported by the DPLs. 
IFC adapted i t s 
program to respond to the new opportunities, particularly notable being a large increase in investments 
from $4 million in 2002-2004 to $244 million in 2008. 

6 . 
The I F C also significantly stepped up its activities in Morocco, achieving a turnaround o f its 
investments and reaching record levels o f commitments. Commitments were distributed through 
commercial banks, microfinance, wastewater local public utilities, and investment funds for SMEs and 
property development in low income housing. On the advisory side, IFC has broadened i t s efforts, by 
supporting the government’s landmark PPP in the irrigation sector, and has been active in supporting the 
business environment by developing commercial mediation, business simplification and improving credit 
information infrastructure. 

7 . 
I n summary, while the document was not formulated as a Country Partnership Strategy, 
implementation of the strategy saw adoption o f the essential features of a CPS. I t laid the foundation 
for a genuine partnership approach that emphasized broad consultations as an input to priority setting, the 
flexibility to adapt the program to new country conditions and government priorities, and commitment to 
improved responsiveness and diligence, as well as improved coordination on respective processes. 

111. 

Summary o f Wo r ld Bank Group Program 

8. 
Du r ing the CAS period July 2005 to June 2 0 0 9 , the Bank delivered ten lending operations 
f o r a total o f $1.127 billion, an average of $280 million per year (see Table A5.1 below). This was 
within the CAS proposed f inanc ia l envelope o f $250-350 million per year. The Bank’s lending included 
six DPLs and four investment projects, with the DPL proportion representing two thirds o f overall new 
commitments. Total disbursements were $1,088 million, averaging $272 million per f i s c a l year. The 
overall quality o f the portfolio remained strong with problem projects accounting for l e s s than 10 percent. 

9 . 
The Bank Group’s program remained focused on the four pillars o f the CAS. I t was adapted 
to respond to changes i n the Government’s program and choice o f lending instruments. The Bank 
delivered new lending operations in each pillar, with the exception o f pillar 3 where the Bas ic Education 
project (PARSEM) had just been approved in FY05 before the CAS was finalized. New areas o f 
engagement - energy, solid waste, the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) - were added 
to the lending program, building on other elements o f Bank engagement in these sectors. For example, 
the government re-engaged in energy sector dialogue with the World Bank in 2005, which led to Bank

support for a technical assistance program in energy, and subsequently led to the formulation o f a 
comprehensive energy sector reform program. I n this context, the energy DPL (FY07) and an energy 
investment lending operation (FY08) were approved and became a core part o f the Bank’s support to the 
first CAS pillar o f increasing Morocco’s competitiveness. Similarly, at the end o f 2006, the government 
embarked on a new reform program in Solid Waste Management. Bank support encompassed AAA , trust 
funds, regional reports and data gathering. A Solid Waste DPL was delivered in FY09, the first o f i t s 
kind in the sector for the Bank. Support for the MDH was introduced into the program as i t became the 
main poverty-focused program o f the government and 
involved multi-donor support to 
implementation. The INDH i s fully aligned with the second CAS pillar o f increasing access to basic 
services by the poor and marginalized.

Relevant experience for its demand-driven, bottom-up community approach had already been collected 
and lessons learned under the Bank-supported Soc ia l Development Agency project (implemented from 
2003-2008) and through the tw o rural projects - Irrigation-Based Community Development project 
(implemented between 2002 and 2008) and Rainfed Agriculture Development (under implementation 
since 2003). 

10. 
The choice o f lending instrument evolved, w ith increased demand for development policy 
lending (DPL) reflecting both the policy-nature o f the reform program and the government’s 
financing preferences. The PARL, ser ies , supporting public administration reform, remained a 
cornerstone o f the Bank’s DPL support. The positive experience from the Housing DPL (approved just 
before the CAS was finalized in FY05) and the Financial Sector DPL (FY06) further solidified the role o f 
DPLs in the Bank’s f inanc ia l support. The CAS-proposed investment lending project in.the water sector 
evolved to become a DPL and the new DPLs for energy and solid waste were approved. Overall, the 
larger use o f the DPL instrument was based on long-term dialogue and solid ana ly t ica l work, often in the 
form o f complex programmatic ESW (see below for discussion on AAA). DPLs allowed for a deeper and 
more productive dialogue on difficult reforms, and aligned Bank resource transfers to concrete actions 
required to launch or continue reforms in each sector. DPLs were supplemented by new investments in 
infrastructure, notably in supporting rural roads, water supply and sanitation. 

11 . 
The AAA program comprised 59 pieces o f analytical work of which 35 were economic and 
sector work and 24 were technical assistance activities. The flexible, on-demand approach facilitated 
responsiveness to key areas emerging in the dialogue, analysis o f new priorities and complex cross- 
cutting themes, and knowledge services that were aligned with the requests o f the client. At times, this 
approach came at the cost o f selectivity and resulted in some fragmentation. Technical assistance and 
policy advice e f f o r t s have been most o f the time demand-driven and o f high quality, although not always 
timely. 

12. 
I F C has played an important role in Morocco during the CAS period w ith its presence on 
the ground f o r advisory services, i t s entrance into the local capital markets, and a record 
investment program. During the CAS period, IFC’s portfolio expanded substantially, in sharp contrast 
with the previous CAS. In FY09, IFC’s total committed portfolio in Mo rocco reached US$272 .5 million 
in 12 companies, making i t the f i f th largest exposure in the MENA region. From zero commitments 
between 2002 and 2005, IFC’s investment activities started to increase sharply in 2006 and reached 
US$244 million in FY08. These commitments, ranging from investments in banks, microfinance 
institutions, water & wastewater utilities, investment funds for small and medium companies, to 
construction sector and property development in low income housing, were the result o f IFC’s refocus on 
investment activities and in line with the WBG strategic objectives. 

13 . 
Supporting the financial sector (Pillar I) has been the centerpiece o f IFC ’s strategy and 
program, particularly as i t supports the development o f SMEs and financial services to the poorer 
segment o f the population. IFC has been active in supporting investment funds bringing much needed 
capital and expertise to over 25 high-growth small and medium companies in Morocco. IFC has also 
worked with leading Moroccan banks to help them develop profitable SME banking operations. IFC also 
undertook various initiatives to develop the country’s financial and credit information infrastructure, and 
helped establish jointly with the Central Bank a best practice private credit bureau. IFC’s support to the 
microfinance sector has helped over 500,000 small borrowers’ access much needed financial services. 
Moreover, IFC’s investment in BMCE Bank, has helped strengthen the bank’s capital and expand in 1 1 
Sub-Saharan African countries. In infrastructure, IFC played a key role in advising the government on 
structuring and implementing the first public-private partnership globally for irrigation, and helped 
mobilize commercial funding f o r loca l water & wastewater utilities. On the Treasury front, IFC issued a 
bond in Morocco denominated in dirhams - a transaction that was the first domestic bond offering by a 

85 

Appendix 3 

multilateral institution in Africa as well as in the Middle East - thus contributing to the broadening o f the 
financial markets in the country. 

I V . Progress on CAS Pillars and Bank Group Contribution 

14. 

The CAS Results Framework provides a structure f o r assessing the contribution o f the 
Bank Group (see Appendix 1). 
Implementation experience yielded a number o f lessons which are being 
reflected in the new CPS. The four pillars were underpinned by 12 outcomes and 112 indicators. 
Experience has shown that this framework was too specific and, in some cases, lacked sufficient realism. 
A more appropriate framework would allow for greater flexibility both over time and to respond to new 
needs and opportunities. I t would also acknowledge that Moroccan institutions and stakeholders are the 
principal drivers o f country development outcomes, as the Bank i s a relatively modest sized player in this 
context, and that Bank performance i s better evaluated by a sense o f “contribution” to results rather than 
firm “attribution”. 

15 . 
Morocco made substantial progress in many areas during the CAS period. In particular, i t 
made progress under Pillar 1 (improve competitiveness and the investment climate), Pillar 4 (improve 
water management and access to water and sanitation), and - to a lesser extent - Pillar 2 (increase access 
to basic services by the poor and marginalized). Mo re modest progress was made under pillar 3 (improve 
education system’s efficiency). Morocco’s achievements under each CAS pillar are discussed below and 
the Bank’s contribution i s assessed.

P i l la r I: Improve competitiveness and the investment climate 

16. 
This p i l la r had five focus areas: (i) maintain macroeconomic stability; (ii) increase efficiency o f 
public administration; (iii) improve the investment climate; (iv) increase efficiency o f the financial sector 
and access to finance o f businesses; and (v) increase competitiveness o f small and medium-sized 
agribusinesses. 

A. 

Ma in ta in macroeconomic stability during the CAS period 

17. 
Morocco sustained solid macroeconomic performance. Growth averaged above 5% annually 
with certain sectors such as tourism, telecommunications, finance, insurance, and construction recording 
levels o f between 6 and 10 percent per year on average over the past four years. Since 2005, Morocco 
maintained sound f i s c a l policies and continued to address f isca l risks, leading to the consolidation o f 
public finances. As a result, the budget ran surpluses in 2007 and 2008 and again in the first half o f 2009 
(averaging 0.3 percent o f GDP), and central government debt steadily declined to 47 percent o f GDP in 
2008 from 62 percent in 2005. In addition, i t pursued appropriate monetary policy geared toward 
maintaining low and stable inflation (an average 2.5 percent since 2005) and enhanced financial sector 
supervision. The external position i s solid, with the current account in surplus for six consecutive years 
over the period 2001-06 and in quasi-balance in 2007. Public finances continue to be well managed with 
effective f i s c a l reforms pursued over the past few years. The most striking structural change was the 
shrinking o f the share o f the primary sector by 3 .5 percentage points o f GDP at factor cost to reach an 
average o f 15 .7 percent over the period 2001-08, a share that i s still high compared to leading transition 
economies. As a result, GDP growth and macroeconomic stability became more resilient to the variability 
o f the agricultural sector. The services sector grew by 4.3 percentage points to average 56.1 percent o f 
GDP, driven by the telecommunication sector and other services provided to businesses and households. 
Manufacturing has declined to an average 16.5 percent o f GDP s ince 2001, down from 18.8 percent in the 
1990s. 

1 8 . 
The Bank provided analytical support as i t engaged i n continued monitoring o f the overall 
macroeconomic situation i n close coordination w ith the IMF. Medium term issues have been 
nourished with a series o f formal and informal AAA and TA activities. A CEM on Morocco’s growth 
challenges was delivered in 2006; a TA on trade issues, s t i l l on-going, has strengthened inter a l i a 
Government capacity to evaluate the impact o f planned and on-going bilateral trade agreements; a series 
o f in-depth policy notes, informally shared with Government, have been developed to guide the overall 
economic dialogue and the preparation o f the new CPS. I n addition, issues o f specific relevance to the 
macroeconomic stability o f the country have been addressed in the sectoral policy dialogue developed 
around the design and implementation o f DPLs and related accompanying TAs. For example, issues o f 
public sector HR reform and wage b i l l management have been tackled by the PARL s e r i e s and the 
associated TA (programmatic ESW). Finally, the Bank’s Treasury Department provided advisory 
services in debt management, as Morocco was one o f the earliest clients to sign a Master Derivatives 
Agreement with the IBRD. 

B. 

Increased efficiency o f the public administration 

19. 
Government carried out a broad range o f reforms that led to improvements to the efficiency 
o f the public administration. C iv i l service reform contributed to a reduction o f the wage b i l l from 1 1.7 
% in 2005 to 10.2 % o f GDP in 2008. Measures included a voluntary retirement program, a limit to new 
recruitment, cancellation o f vacancies, and geographic and sectoral refocusing o f human resources. 
Government established a Medium Term Expenditure Framework in 9 ministries, together with the 
dissemination o f a methodological guide. Five additional ministries are expected to complete their 
MTEFs by the end o f 2009. Limited progress was made on deconcentration, with the creation o f ad hoc 

87 

Appendix 3 

functions at decentralized level and performance-based contracts with external services at regional level 
in a few sectoral ministries. 
Important progress was made in introducing an e-Government and 
information society framework, and high impact measures introduced on-line administration. Successful 
e-Government applications were developed in the area o f custom processing (the "Badr" platform), e- 
procurement, tax reporting and payments, and externalization o f key I T processes. 

2 0 . 
Since 2002 the Wo r ld Bank, the EU and the African Development Bank have supported 
Government with a mix o f financing and advisory activities. The key objectives o f the public 

administration reform program (PARAP) are: (a) improving Government efficiency in the management o f 
budget resources through greater transparency, accountability, and performance measurement; (b) 
improving Government efficiency in the management o f human resources; and (c) consolidating and 
controlling c iv i l service payroll evolution and (d) developing e-Government. A se r ies o f three 
Development Policy loans, called Public Administration Reform Loans (PARLs), has accompanied the 
reform process (FY05, FY06, FY08) with PARL IV scheduled for FY 10. The PARLs mostly addressed 
results (outputs) in terms o f reform implemented and modernized tools adopted by the various public 
entities, mostly on a pilot basis. A programmatic ESW (P-ESW) was delivered in parallel with its focus 
designed to accompany the reforms pursued under the PARL agenda. The PARLs are considered to have 
been satisfactory on meeting their objectives (June 2009 ICR for PARLs I and I1 and the on-going 
assessment o f PARL 111). Government showed commitment to implementing the program and donor 
coordination among the Bank, EU and A fDB was strong throughout and played a major role in program 
success. The Index o f the Quality o f government o f the Bank's Economic Development Prospects report, 
which i s a percentile rank relative to other countries o f the world, was 7 4 in 2007 (100 meaning best 
environment) compared to a rating o f 5 8 in 2 0 0 0 . See Table A3.3 below for outcomes.

Improve the Investment Climate 

2 1. 

Morocco experienced good investment performance. Gross investment reached 36 .3 percent 

o f GDP in 2008 and FD I increased by 8 percent per year over the last five years, reaching $4.5 billion or 
6 percent o f GDP in 2 0 0 7 . Most o f the FD I happened in five sectors: telecommunications (22 percent o f 
the total), new industry sectors ( 2 0 . 9 percent), tourism (17 .8 percent), real estate (16,5percent), and 
banking (5.9 percent). Most o f these sectors posted high growth rates over the period 2001-08, o f which 

88 

Appendix 3 

telecommunications (up 12.4 percent), rea l estate and construction (up 7.6 percent), f inanc ia l services (up 
6.9 percent), and mechanical and e l e c t r i c a l industries (up 6 percent). Liberalizing transport and energy, 
investments in transport infrastructure, strengthening the f inanc ia l sector, and selectively opening the 
trade regime have further contributed to the diversification o f the economy, especially since 2004. This 
progress, together with good macro management, contributed to Morocco achieving investment grade 
status in 2007, which further reinforced the confidence o f investors, both domestic and foreign. 

22. 
Important investment climate reforms have been introduced over the past four years. The 
corporate governance framework for joint stock companies (socie'te's anonymes) was reformed, an 
arbitration and mediation law was introduced, and the corporate tax rate was decreased. The business 
simplification project with the Regional Investment Center was instituted in Casablanca in 2007, with 
support from IFC, which helped accelerate business start-up procedures. As part o f the decentralized 
management o f investment, powers were vested 
in regional Wa l is in relation to consensual 
transfers/conveyance or rentals o f State-owned land for investment projects; a procedural handbook and a 
national committee for investment-related procedures were set up to simplify these procedures. Some 
progress was made on the legal authorization to freely enter into contracts for a limited duration, and on 
the review o f the 2003 Labor Code, applicable to dismissals based on technological, structural, or 
economic reasons. 

23. 
There remains a need to increase the impact o f reforms. 
In particular, the business 
environment continues to present challenges, especially in those areas-like 
regulatory reform-that 
require coordination across public agencies, and where a gap remains between the laws as they appear on 
the books and how they're applied to individual investors. Morocco's ranking in the annual Doing 
Business report i s largely static, at 128'h globally, and 13th under the Middle East and North Africa region 
Doing Business ranking. 

24. 
The Bank Group provided analytic support to the most urgent reforms in transport, 
logistics, fiscal reform and the investment climate. Analytical work included a study on Land Reform 
which identified regulations in industrial land as one o f the issues to be addressed and two Investment 
Climate Assessments (ICAs), in 2005 and in 2008. Debate on Morocco's Doing Business ranking led to a 
request from the main business organization (CGEM) to reopen negotiations with unions to bring more 
flexibility to labor regulations. The Bank was asked to provide technical assistance to organize an 
efficient public-private mechanism for identifying reform needs, and support the establishment o f a 
national committee to monitor and facilitate reforms among different ministries. 
IFC developed a 
sizeable advisory program to strengthen the investment climate and support private sector development. 
I t s advisory program focused on (a) promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to improving 
the business environment - with the Ministry o f Justice; (b) helping identify public-private partnerships in 
key infrastructure sectors - with the Ministry o f Finance; (c) simplifying business creations starting with 
the City o f Casablanca; and (d) strengthening credit information and SME finance, through the 
establishment o f a private credit bureau - with the Central Bank. Overall, the Bank Group's program was 
considered to have made a satisfactory contribution. See also Table A3.4.

microfinance, postal services and associations) previously excluded from regulatory oversight. Progress 
on regulation and supervision o f the insurance sector was less significant. The Bank and the IMF carried 
out a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) review in 2007 which underpinned the reforms 
supported by the DPL. The government reforms supported by the DPL and FSAP have reduced financial 
sector vulnerabilities, especially as a result o f the restructuring o f ailing public specialized financial 
institutions. Concerns over stability have eased and policy attention has now been directed increasingly 
to core financial system development issues. The formerly state owned banks are in an advanced state o f 
restructuring and are in compliance with prudential requirements. They have redefined their strategy, 
business plan and market niche. The share o f government involvement in the banking sector has dropped 
from 40% in 2002 to 23% by 2008. On Ap r i l 2009, the four authorities with responsibilities for the 
financial stability o f Mo rocco ’s financial system (Ministry o f Economy and Finance, Central Bank, 
Securities Ethics Council and Department o f Insurance and Social Welfare) participated in a financial 
crisis simulation exercise sponsored by FIRST Initiative and the World Bank. The exercise was designed 
to test how the authorities would work together to manage a potential systemic crisis within their financial 
system. 

27. 
The IFC has been very active in banking, micro-finance and investment funds covering. 
This included (i) the establishment o f the Credit Bureau; (ii) advisory work to Morocco’s microfinance 
sector as part o f i t s investment packages; and ( i i i ) support to the expansion o f BMCE Bank in to 11 Sub- 
Saharan countries, therefore contributing to strengthen South-South Cooperation. 
IFC has also been 
active on the Treasury front. I n FY05, i t issued a bond in Morocco denominated in dirhams. This 
transaction was the first domestic bond offering by a multilateral institution in the country and in the 
MENA region. The transaction contributed to develop the domestic capital market, provide a new top 
quality investment opportunity, introduce “best practices” in the domestic capital market, and provide 
Morocco with a market visibility throughout the region. The 7-year bond o f U S $ I 17 million equivalent 
was distributed to more than 20 Moroccan institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual 
funds and pension funds. IFC also financed several investment projects per year between FY06-FY09 
which provided critical credit financing to micro-finances institutions or delivered equity financing: 

US$3.3 million partial credit guarantee to Fondep, a microfinance institution, allowing i t to 
mobilize US$6.6 million in loca l currency funding; 

US$ 12.3 million in a regional private equity fund, Maghreb Private Equity Fund 11, targeting 
SMEs in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia; 

US$22 million financing package to Jaida, Morocco’s newly established microfinance fund. The 
financing i s in the form o f 100% sovereign-linked guarantee to allow Jaida to ra ise subordinated 
debt in loca l currency from Mo roccan banks; 

US$2 1 million financing package to A I Amana, Morocco’s leading microfinance institution. The 
l o c a l currency financing package i s composed o f subordinated and senior debt, in the form o f a 
l o c a l currency loan and credit guarantees. The subordinated debt was designed with the features 
o f Tier I1 capital, to help the M F I increase its capital base. This i s also IFC’s first local currency 
debt to a microfinance institution and also the first subordinated debt to an M F I in Morocco; 

U S $ l 10 million quasi-equity investment (Upper Tier I 1 capital) in BMCE Bank to support the 
bank’s international expansion, namely i n Sub Saharan Africa through the acquisition o f Bank o f 
Africa; 

91 

Appendix 3 

U S $ 8 million equity investment to Capital North Africa Venture Fund, a private equity fund 
managed by Capital Invest, an affiliate o f a Moroccan bank, which w i l l target high growth SMEs 
primarily in Morocco; 

US$7 million investment in Altermed, a private equity fund targeting SMEs with small 
capitalization needs in Morocco; 

2 8 . 
I n summary, Morocco’s strong commitment to carrying out financial sector reform and the 
Bank Group’s support to the financial sector overall are judged as satisfactory. (See also Table

Increased Competitiveness of Small and Medium-sized Agribusinesses 

2 9 . 

The agricultural sector in M o r o c c o continues to face daunting challenges. I t i s characterized 

by a dualistic nature with, on the one hand, a predominant rain-fed sub-sector where 70 percent o f the 
poor live characterized by low productivity levels, and on the other hand, a small, competitive, export- 
oriented, irrigated sub-sector. Both large and small producers are constrained by inter-locking incentive, 
institutional and investment environment issues. Domestic price and market liberalization i s not complete, 
nor i s trade liberalization. Mo re progress i s needed in land rights tenure systems and water management. 
An institutional framework compatible with demand-driven commercial and competitive agriculture i s yet 
to emerge. The recent launch o f the government’s new and ambitious four year strategic framework for 
the agriculture sector (the “Plan Maroc Vert”) constitutes a concerted response to this challenge. 
Government i s currently mobilizing support to this plan’s implementation, including from the World 
Bank and other donors. 

30. 

The Bank Group contributed to this pillar through a range o f mainly cross-cutting 

interventions.I6 I t continued to implement two on-going integrated rural development projects - the 
Development o f Rain-fed Agriculture Project (known by its French acronym DR I -MVB ) and the 
Irrigation Based Community Development Project (known by its French acronym DRI-PMH). The 
objectives o f these projects were to improve incomes and quality o f l i f e o f rural communities and to pilot 
new institutional arrangements to ensure greater community participation and integration o f sectoral 
programs. The DRI-PMH was focused on irrigation and c losed at the end o f 2008 and the DR I -MVB i s 
focused on rain-fed agriculture and i s still under implementation. Implementation experience from these 
projects demonstrates the difficulty in piloting new and innovative approaches. The community-driven 
approach was a relatively novel idea to Morocco and the projects took a long time to get o f f the ground 
and put the necessary institutional and human capacity in place. Thereafter, implementation accelerated. 

l 6 The Water sector DPL focused attention on the sustainability o f hydro resources and i s described in more de ta i l 
la te r in this document under P i l la r I V for Water Sector.

Appendix 3 

Government agencies are demonstrating capacity to implement and f i s c a l decentralization i s proving to 
aid the approach. The ICR o f the DRI-PMH highlights that the project demonstrated that participatory 
community-based planning and integrated local level investment programming are feas ib le in rural areas 
o f Morocco and add value i n terms both o f ownership and impact. The model adopted by the project has 
been transferred and sca led up in other parts o f the country, and nourished the design o f the nation-wide 
poverty reduction program INDH (see Pillar 11). The integration o f investment programs at provincial 
level under the coordination o f the governors has been effective although more needs to be done to ensure 
the effective implementation o f these programs. Lessons learned from these two projects are furthermore 
useful for the design o f the new Bank operation requested by the government to support the Plan Ma roc 
Vert’s component that targets the poorest rural areas and farmers. 

3 1. 

The Bank Group had an active AAA program. This included an ESW report on land tenure 
and a policy note on the implementation o f public-private partnerships contracts to improve agricultural 
competitiveness and strengthen quality and vertical integration o f four sub-sectors. The IFC, with the 
Bank’s support, advised the government on structuring and implementing the first public-private 
partnership (PPP) in irrigation worldwide. The project was for the construction and operation o f the 
irrigated perimeter o f Guerdane ( 1 0,000 hectares), which aims to increase the availability o f irrigation 
water for about 600 citrus producers, thereby increasing and stabilizing their production and revenues, 
with benefits for more than 10,000 people. IFC - with the support o f a technical assistance grant from 
France’s Fonds D’etudes et D’aide au Secteur Prive and the Bank’s technical expertise in the water sector - 
provided the government with advice on structuring and implementing the Guerdane PPP to deliver high- 
quality, accountable and financially and environmentally sustainable public service to end-users. IFC also 
worked with the government to ensure a highly competitive and transparent bidding process for the 
transaction. The CAS indicators for this sub-component are shown in Table A3.6.

Energy Sector and Climate Change 

32 . 
Although not foreseen at the time o f CAS preparation, the government resumed an active 
energy sector dialogue w ith the Wor ld Bank, leading to unplanned program activities. The Bank 

provided technical assistance focused on energy security and efficient management o f resources. I t led to 
the government formulation, in coordination with other development partners and particularly the EU, o f 
a comprehensive energy sector reform program. A t a time o f fast increasing energy prices, the Bank 
judged engagement important to the CAS objectives o f improving competitiveness and increasing access 
to services could not be achieved without due consideration to a well performing energy sector. 
In 
response, during CAS implementation, the Bank delivered three financing operations (Energy DPL for 

93 

Appendix 3 

$100 million, an investment loan to the e l e c t r i c i t y company ONE for $150 million, and a GEF grant for 
$43 million for a solar assisted gas-fired combined cycle power plant). The DPL operation aimed to 
support security o f supply, while ensuring a sustainable energy future; competitiveness o f energy supplies 
through cost reduction and improved sector performance in order to be able to reduce subsidies, building 
capacity building for strong operational and financial performance. The Bank delivered extensive ana ly t ic 
work in energy sector studies, policy notes and technical assistance (P-ESW). Against the background o f 
the Bank analysis and support, the new government undertook a strategic study o f the sector in the f a l l o f 
2007, reformulated i t s energy strategy and launched new thinking on reform o f the compensation 
mechanism. 

3 3 . 
Toward the end o f the CAS period, work was initiated to address climate change issues. 
The government and the Bank, in partnership with the African Development Bank, formulated an 
investment plan to access resources o f the Clean Technology Fund to finance investment that would 
lower the carbon intensity o f the Moroccan economy. Morocco i s also part o f the regional investment 
plan to scale-up use o f solar thermal energy through the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology to 
meet the energy needs o f both MENA region and European countries. Regional integration i s a key 
element o f these different activities, as i t would help achieve the objectives o f enhancing energy security 
and reducing the carbon intensity o f the energy system. 

P i l la r 11: Increase access to basic services f o r poor and marginalized people 

34 . 
Poverty in M o r o c c o fell from 15.3% i n 2001 to 9% i n 2007”, w ith a decline from 25.lo/o to 
14.5% in ru ra l areas where 43% of Moroccans live. The economic recovery in the 2000s has 
increased employment, reduced poverty, and improved social outcomes. Unemployment rates have been 
falling constantly and were, before the crisis, at a 30-year low . However, they remain high at around 9 
percent (estimated figure as o f first half o f 2009) and questions remain over the quality o f the jobs 
available. The reduction in unemployment i s due to slower labor force growth rather than employment 
creation. There i s broad national consensus on the need for growth acceleration over the next decade. 
Morocco w i l l need to continue to pursue reforms that accelerate the economic transformation toward 
higher value added and more diversified products and rely more on trade in world markets as an 
additional source o f growth. 

3 5 . 
The Bank Group provided a broad range o f support to this goal. The overall assessment i s 
that important achievements have been made, with c lear progress on housing, poverty reduction, and 
monitoring. Some o f the areas o f engagement proposed in the CAS - such as new integrated rural 
development projects - did not materialize as planned because the country context and the Government’s 
program evolved as described elsewhere in this report. 

A. 

Reduce the Number o f Households L iv ing in Slums by 60% 

3 6 . 
This CAS goal built on the Government’s housing sector reform which started i n 2003 w ith 
support from the Bank on the sector institutional setting and needed reforms. This engagement 
supported the formulation o f a national strategy highlighting urban poverty reduction, cultural 
conservation and local economic development objectives associated with the rehabilitation o f the 
medinas. I n support o f this national strategy, in June 2005, a $150 million, two-tranche Housing DPL 
was approved whose objectives were to: (i) strengthen the institutional, regulatory and f i s c a l environment 
for a well-functioning housing market and for the emergence o f market-based solutions to the country’s 
housing sector constraints; and ( i i ) increase the access o f low-income and severely disadvantaged 

” This i s the national poverty figure in Morocco. I t i s based on a poverty threshold o f $2 per day per person in new PPP which i s 
a level far below what other countries at the same level o f GDP are using.

households to more affordable and higher quality housing. The ICR concluded that the project was 
satisfactory in reaching its development objectives and in its implementation progress. Progress on 
institutional and regulatory reforms (the project’s first development objective) was stronger than that 
recorded on the second objective (focused on low-income and disadvantaged households), although both 
were rated satisfactory. Government strengthened the national slum upgrading program, set aside public 
land for social housing and contracted on-site infrastructure to the private sector. However, 
implementation difficulties meant that just 28 percent o f slum households benefited from the low-income 
housing program and 2.5% o f households are still located in slum areas (an improvement over the 
project’s baseline o f 4%, but l e s s than the ambitious CAS outcome goal o f 1 .5%) . The Bank’s urban 
AAA work continues to analyze key issues and contribute to reforms and policies. The Bank delivered an 
ESW in FY08 on Historic Cities Rehabilitation, followed by a policy workshop in FY09. I t provided 
analytical support in Urban Transport and Transport Logistics, with studies and technical assistance, 
including preparation o f the Urban Sector Strategy study. This has recently crystallized into a formal 
request for an Urban Transport DPL that i s under preparation for FY 10 delivery. 

37 . 
I F C invested $75 million in M ix ta , a Spanish property developer focusing on affordable 
housing (targeting low and middle income households) in Morocco and Africa. This was a further 

innovative investment by IFC in a new area o f business. IFC’s investment has provided Mixta with long- 
term financing to develop affordable housing namely i n the North o f Morocco, addressing the unmet and 
rising demand for affordable housing units, both in the lower and middle-market segments. The CAS 
indicators (Table A3.7) for this sub-component capture some o f the progress recorded during the CAS 
period.

Poor and Vulnerable Populations L iv ing in Rura l , Periurban and U rban Areas have 
Improved Access to Basic Services, Social Programs, and Economic Opportunities 

38 . 

Road access o f the ru ra l population exceeded the CAS target (see Table A5.8). The 

government’s national program fo r rural roads was supported in a harmonized way by the Bank and other 
donors with each donor providing parallel financing, with some similarities to a SWAP approach. Donors 
agreed to collectively finance investments with the government for rehabilitating 15,000 kilometers o f 
rural roads, providing coordinated technical and financial support, and assessing progress around an 
integrated results framework. Investments in the secondary road network had a major impact on access to 
services where these were coordinated with efforts in schools and water supply, building on participatory 
approaches with provinces and local communities. The impact o f the first phase was tangible: in villages 
that gained access to an all-weather road the net enrollment ratio o f girls in primary school rose from 28% 
to 68% and the price o f some staple foods declined by 50%. 

95 

Appendix 3 

39. 
After the CAS was finalized, the government asked f o r the Bank’s financial support to the 
National In it iat ive fo r Human Development ( INDH ) . This was delivered in the form o f a SWAP loan 
o f U S $ l O O m i l l ion approved in December 2006. The program targets urban neighborhoods and rural 
communes with multi-sectoral public infrastructure and revenue generating investments focusing on the 
most vulnerable populations. I t relies on bottom up participation and planning and gives a more cen t ra l 
role to elected local governments and to NGOs. The INDH approach built on the experience o f three 
earlier Bank-funded projects - the Social Development Agency (ADS) project which piloted capacity 
building and community mapping; and the two rural projects - Irrigation Based Community Development 
project and the Rainfed Agricultural Development project - which support bottom-up and demand-driven 
community development. Support for INDH has become a major element o f the Bank’s program under 
this P i l la r . There has been considerable progress in INDH implementation. Poverty in the communities 
targeted by INDH f e l l from 36% to 21%. 

40. 
The Bank delivered a substantial A A A program. I t built on the M i l e s Report on Skills and 
Employment to build consensus around the need for a reform o f subsidies and the potential benefits o f a 
cash transfer program. Budget issues related to the food and o i l crises saw further Bank analysis and 
advice on reform o f subsidies and the Bank provided technical and analytical support to monitor poverty. 
The Bank’s P-ESW instrument helped the government generate relevant information for policy decisions, 
analyze the effectiveness o f policies, and expose gaps in knowledge and data. Poverty maps introduced 
with Bank support changed the way poverty was perceived and addressed in Morocco, leading to more 
attention to poverty pockets in rich provinces. The use o f poverty maps, and the Bank’s poverty work 
more generally, have helped policy makers identify and implement social programs and have 
strengthened the authorities’ ability to identify and monitor poverty. This poverty mapping also shaped 
the design and targeting o f the INDH. 

41. 
The Bank’s program provided some support to the health sector, focused on advisory and 
technical assistance as well as the implementation o f a trust fund in support o f nutrition (GA IN program). 
Through this trust fund, the Bank was able to support the preparation o f the national strategy on nutrition. 
Health coverage and efficiency o f the multiple systems in place remain major concerns and the 
government assessed in the f a l l o f 2007 that the sector was in need o f a fundamental reform. Since then, a 
sector strategy has since been put in place. The European Union and the African Development Bank, as 
well as other bilateral donors, are heavily engaged in the health sector and, to date, the Bank’s work has 
been limited to technical support to complement the engagement o f other donors in the area o f assisting 
with the targeting o f the insurance scheme (RAMED) to the poorest. This scheme has been launched as a 
pilot in November 2008 so i t is, therefore, s t i l l too soon to see real progress. Bank support was small in 
this area. 

42. 
I F C carried out a pilot landmark investment aligned w ith the objective o f improving access 
to basic services. 
I t provided a US$21 million structured finance package 
to Radeej, a 
water/electricity/sewage u t i l i ty in E l Jadida. This was the first time ever in Morocco that a public u t i l i ty 
could access IFC financing and marked IFC’s 1 ” sub-national transaction in MENA . The guarantee 
provided by IFC led to the brokering o f long term commercial financing for Radeej’s wastewater 
upgrading program. Such long term commercial financing would likely not have been forthcoming in the 
absence o f IFC and a t tes ts to the ca ta ly t ic financing nature o f IFC. This initial transaction opened the way 
for other public utilities to access long term commercial funding, for needed investments in wastewater in 
three major c i t i e s (Marrakech, Kenitra and Agadir). 

43. 
Wh i le Table A3.8 shows the positive achievement that the CAS outcome indicator fo r ru ra l 
road access was exceeded, i t also shows that other indicators were not aligned w i th the actual 
delivery o f the Bank’s program. The Bank did not provide support to health insurance, the poverty

are supported by the Bank’s Irrigation-Based 
Community Development and Rainfed Rural 
Development projects. Loca l , provincial and regional 
committees have been se t up under INDH. 

44. 
Not foreseen at the time o f CAS preparation, the government requested support from the 
Bank fo r the solid waste management program i t launched at the end o f 2006. On ly 70% o f urban 

so l id waste i s collected and l e s s than 15% o f collected waste i s disposed o f i n an environmentally and 
socially acceptable manner. A 15-year, 3-phase program prepared in 2008 set out objectives fo r the 
modernization o f solid waste management w i t h specific targets. The sector had been addressed in the 
CAS under the water p i l la r but no t spec i f ica l ly iden t i f ied as a strategic objective. The Bank has been 
engaged in a long-term program o f support that encompassed A A A , trust funds, regional reports and data 
gathering. Fo l low ing a government request, the Bank approved i t s first D P L in the so l id waste sector in 
Ma rch 2009 ($132 m i l l ion ) . This path-breaking operation built upon the po l icy dialogue and advisory 
ro le o f the previous f ive years. 
I t focuses on imp rov ing the governance o f the sector, enhancing 
sustainability o f services, bu i ld ing pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships and mainstreaming environmental and 
social priorities. I t also assists Morocco to take advantage o f the Clean development mechanism and gain 
access to the carbon finance market through decreasing the emissions o f green house gases from open 
land f i l ls . A second D P L i s planned as part o f the new CPS. 

P i l lar 111: Improve the Efficiency o f the Education System 

45. 

Government devoted attention to pr imary and higher education f o r the past several years in 
response to high geographic, demographic and gender inequalities. Access to education at a l l levels 

has been expanded, w i t h national net enrollment rates fo r pr imary education, m idd le school and upper 
secondary a l l increasing. Th is increased enrollment has placed pressure on higher education and has led to 
a substantial increase in student enrollment (about 25% between 1993 and 2006). Good progress has also 
been made in ensuring equitable access to education fo r young children. The gender par i ty index in 

97 

Appendix 3 

primary education between urban boys and rural girls aged 6-1 1 has narrowed from 1.5 to 1 in the past 
decade. Nevertheless, serious enrollment disparities persist as children proceed through the education 
system. Illiteracy rates remain high in rural areas and among women, unemployment among high school 
and even university graduates remains high, and there i s a perceived disconnect between economic 
growth and standards o f quality in a l l levels o f the education system. With the goal o f facilitating a 
comprehensive assessment o f progress in education, the two CAS components under this pillar are 
grouped together. 

A. 

B. 

Increase Access to and Quality o f Basic Education and 
Increase Graduation and Employment Rates o f H igh School, H igher Education and 
Vocational Tra in ing Students 

46. 
There has been progress in improving access. The national net enrollment rates for primary 
education have increased from 52.4% (1990-1991) to 93.5% (2007-2008). Between 2000 and 2008, net 
enrollment in middle school increased from 17.5% to 43.4%, and in upper secondary education from 
6.1% to 17.5%. Education completion rates have progressed but the prospects to meet the MDGs remain 
uncertain. Primary school completion rate has increased from 57.8% in 2004 to 70.8% in 2007. The 
disparity between girls and boys remains an issue. It i s not clear whether, at the current pace, universal 
primary school completion can be achieved by 2015. The completion o f middle school education has 
improved (from 43.7% in 2004 to 78.6% in 2007), with rates for boys (74.9%) lower in comparison to 
that for girls (82.9%). Morocco has been l e s s successful in balancing the observed increase in enrollments 
with the required education quality and skills improvement. The internal efficiency o f the education 
system i s low at a l l levels. High drop-out and repetition rates are prevalent at most levels. Learning 
achievements and external efficiency are problematic. Ensuring the financial sustainability o f schooling 
expansion and strengthening the overall sector’s governance are challenging. 

47. 
The Bank supported improvement o f education access and standards, in particular through 
a P r ima ry Education loan (PARSEM 1). This project was approved in FY05 and implemented 
throughout the CAS period ( i t closed in June 2009). 
I t was implemented along with financing from 
several other donors. The principal objective o f PARSEM i s to support government efforts to provide 
basic education and improving quality o f that education to a l l children ages six to fourteen in a financially 
sustainable manner. To meet this objective, PARSEM contributed to the establishment o f practices, 
mechanisms, and approaches that w i l l improve the education system on an ongoing basis. As well as 
contributing to the enrollment outcomes mentioned above, concrete efforts were made through the project 
to improve the governance o f the sector by addressing fiduciary weaknesses, including with training in 
procurement and financial management to s ta f f o f the AREFs (regional academies recently instituted) and 
diagnosis on evaluation systems within the Ministry o f Education. These include the decentralization 
process (AREFs are gradually playing a key role in reform implementation), the strengthening o f the in- 
service training program and the execution o f learning evaluation. 

48 . 
I n June 2008, the Education Emergency P lan (Plan d’Urgence 2009-2012) was finalized 
which lays out an ambitious reform program that underscores government’s prioritization o f the 
education sector in Morocco’s development. Support to the preparation o f this plan was provided 
during preparation by donors engaged in the education sector (including the Bank through PARSEM). 
Since June 2008, donors have been delivering their financial support to the Plan d’Urgence and the Bank 
has a DPL under preparation in FY 10 in support o f this. 

49. 
The Bank supported the M in is t ry of Education i n putting in place a conditional cash 
transfer program in ru ra l p r ima ry education. Starting with technical discussions in early 2007, to the 
launch o f the program in the f a l l o f 2008, the Bank has been providing technical assistance through a 
series o f short technical notes and regular missions, to answer specific needs expressed by the Ministry o f

P i l la r IV : Improve Wa te r (Resources) Management and Access to Potable/Drinking Wa te r and 
Sanitation Services 

5 1 . 

Mo ro c co ’ s water policies have long focused on securing scarce and unevenly distributed 
resources f o r urban and agricultural needs. I t has done this through the development o f dams, large 
sca le irrigation perimeters, and urban water supply systems. While creating solid infrastructure and 
capable institutions, this supply-driven focus also led to neglecting parallel investments in demand 
management, water supply in rural areas, sanitation and pollution control. Starting in 1995 with the 
promulgation o f the Water Law, government has sought to bring about better resource management and 
protection, as well as improved access and efficiency in the water sector. Reform progress has been slow 
and Morocco’s water sector - understood as encompassing resource management, irrigation, and water 
supply and sanitation (WSS) - remains in transition towards a more efficient resource management and 
service. For a l l i t s infrastructure achievements, the sector faces pressing challenges, including large scale 
degradation and depletion o f water resources, substantial gaps in water supply and sanitation coverage, 
and generally inefficient water usage. Such water-related constraints contribute to limiting economic and 
social development opportunities across Morocco. 

52 . 
Building on three decades o f water project partnerships and renewed policy dialogue since 
2002, the government and the Bank agreed that the water sector would remain central to their 
partnership. The water pillar o f the CAS was conceived in this context. As highlighted in Tables 
A5.10, A5.11 and A5.12, there progress has been made. During the course o f CAS implementation, as 
the government showed an increasing preference for DPLs, it requested the Bank to provide DPL support 
to the water sector, to complement the investment projects underway or planned. In October 2005, the 
government confirmed that the reform program would seek advances in sector governance, resource 
management, irrigation, and water supply and sanitation (WSS), while ensuring continuity with previous 
sector reforms and adjustment operations. The DPL was designed as a series o f four loans 
(Programmatic-DPL, or P-DPL) to sustain the incremental implementation over several years o f the 
government’s broad reform program. The reforms aimed at bringing about more efficient and sustainable 
water management and service delivery. The program addressed central issues in sector governance and 
financing, while supporting sub-sectoral reforms in resource management, irrigation, and water supply 
and sanitation. I t was guided by principles o f integrated resources management, as well as demand and 
performance management. Goals and key measures included: (i) strengthened water sector governance, 
financing arrangements, and policy coordination; (ii) enactment o f integrated water resource management 
(IWRM) towards sustainable water uses; (iii) improved service, asset management and usage productivity 
in irrigation; and (iv) better access to water and sanitation services, and increased wastewater treatment 
capacity. Following satisfaction o f agreed actions in each o f the four reform tracks, DPL-1 was disbursed 
in June 2007. Despite good progress on the irrigation and water supply and sanitation reform tracks, DPL 
2 could not be triggered as planned in 2008, due to delays i n the implementation o f sector governance 
reforms and mixed results in the IWRM reform track. Accordingly the Programmatic DPL framework 
expired in May 2009. Premature termination aside, the DPL process i s believed to have facilitated 
meaningful policy and awareness gains, on the long path to sustainable management o f water resources 
and water demands. In support o f the water pillar, programmatic ESW (P-ESW) was carried out as part o f 
a flexible, multi-year approach designed to support reform scoping and design, to promote interministerial 
collaboration, and to benefit key institutional sector actors. Trust Fund support ($2.7 million) was 
mobilized for studies and TA .

53 . 

M a jo r results were achieved in this area, supported by the DPL. These included: (i) the 

Adop t ion o f the Na t iona l Sanitation Plan (PNA) for the per iod 2006-2009, and establishment o f criteria 
fo r the allocation and management o f subsidies granted under this Plan; (ii) the development and launch 
o f the Na t iona l Plan fo r I r r iga t ion Water E f f ic iency (PNEEI), and (iii) increased budget f inanc ing for the 
development o f rura l water supply. Some cr i t ica l ins t i tu t iona l constraints were addressed, inc lud ing 
complexities and inefficiencies o f sector organization; breadth o f r iver basin agencies mandates exceeding 
their financial resources; the slow enactment o f Law 10/95 on Water; the g row ing gap between water 
demands and available water resources; and lack o f policies to manage demand. As h igh l igh ted i n Table 
A3.10, there was some good progress made in achieving the outcome indicators o f the CAS fo r this 
component o f P i l la r IV .

B. 

Increased Access to Water and Wastewater Treatment in Target Basins 

54. 

Concrete results were attained in increasing access t o potable water and sanitation in ru ra l 

areas and poor peri-urban areas. The Bank supported through two interventions. In FY06 , i t approved 
a Rura l Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) project in the El Jadida and Safi provinces wh ich supports 
the national water operator - ONEP. The project development objective i s to support the government 
program to increase sustainable access to potable water supply in ru ra l areas, wh i le promo t ing improved 
wastewater management and hygiene practices. The project i s being implemented satisfactorily, although 
w i t h some procurement delays, and there i s a h igh demand f rom beneficiaries fo r the project’s services, 
par t icu lar ly fo r house connections. The project i s at i t s m id - te rm rev iew po in t so i t i s s t i l l premature t o 
assess i t s impact. Preparation has recently started on a second ONEP U rban and Ru ra l Water Systems 
(URWS) project to meet urban and rura l coverage and access goals in fou r provinces and pioneering a 
household-connection service and sanitation strategy fo r ru ra l areas. 

5 5 . 
The second intervention, partially foreseen at the time o f the CAS, was to support an 
innovative and successful large-scale pilot since 2007 in poor un-zoned periurban neighborhoods of 
Casablanca, Meknes and Tangiers, to demonstrate Output Based A id (OBA) mechanisms fo r the 

101 

Appendix 3 

promotion o f water and sanitation service connections in chronically un-served areas. Funded through a 
$ 7 million GPOBA grant, this pilot program promotes innovative partnerships between private or public 
operators, loca l authorities and the government, for the subsidized extension o f water service connections 
in chronically neglected marginal areas. Progress and lessons learned to date on these pilots have been 
very promising, and the principle o f output-based aid as an efficient targeted subsidy mechanism has been 
confirmed by the midterm review. The project i s aligned with INDH objectives and progress has been 
such that, with due scale-up streamlining and adaptations, i t can serve as a template for government to 
achieve its stated INDH goals o f providing access to basic utility services in poor communities 
nationwide. 

56 . 
The I r r iga t ion Based Community Development Project continued to be implemented 
during the CAS period, reaching successfully local communities w ith small irrigation schemes and 
strengthening bottom-up decision making mechanisms. This project was discussed above as regards 

its achievements at rolling out a bottom-up participatory development approach but its impact on 
irrigation and agricultural productivity merits discussion here. As noted in the ICR, the project’s 
outcomes were considerable as i t strengthened management o f irrigation schemes in a participatory way 
which lent to improved efficiency o f water use, greater agricultural productivity from better irrigation, 
and ultimately improved incomes. The economic rate o f return on the irrigation investments surpassed 
the project’s goal and the overall ICR rating was satisfactory (despite the problems with slow project 
start-up and the lengthy implementation period). 

57 . 

I F C has been very active in the water sector through several interventions: (i) a $40 million 

equity investment and stand-by loan to Veolia Water International which was part o f a multi-region 
investment; (ii) the Guerdane project, the first ever public-private partnership in irrigation, described 
earlier; and (iii) the $2 1 million structured finance package to Radeej, a water/electricity/sewage utility in 
E l Jadida, also described ea r l ie r .

irrigation and agricultural extension agencies). Service delegation transactions (PPP) are under review 
and ready to be rolled out for four ORMVAs. Public-public performance contracts have been developed, 
with Bank assistance, between government and the ORMVAs. Gains are also reported in water supply 
and sanitation service regulation (tariffs, performance), including a Service Delegation Law approved to 
rule the selection and contracting o f service providers and their performance management. On the other 
hand, limited progress was achieved for the design and implementation o f tariff policy reform and o f 
regulation reform. I t i s too early to assess if Bank-supported initiatives to build capacity within water 
resources management institutions or river basin agencies, w i l l be conclusive. Despite the urgency, Bank 
technical assistance for the development o f sustainable aquifer management strategies and studies 
conducted to forecast climate change impacts on agriculture and water resources management have until 
now only benefited from partial government ownership, and have suffered data disclosure delays.

I n conclusion, the 2006-2009 CAS saw the Bank support important initiatives in Mo rocco ’s 

water sector. Results were seen in the irrigation and WSS subsectors, both determined in pursuing 
reform, bridging infrastructure gaps and improving performance. Some progress has also been initiated 
for WRM, but in this subsector however, government’s c a l l for more effective policies and efficient 
expenditure i s lagging, and depends upon a difficult switch to demand management policies and selective 
pursuit o f new resource development. Nevertheless, the water sector partnership with the government 
over the 2006-2009 period can be seen as productive. The Bank’s policy dialogue, investment lending, 
policy lending and technical assistance have accompanied and supported several strategic and irreversible 
transformations and gains. 

V. Other Cross-Cutting Elements o f the Bank Group’s Program in M o r o c c o 

U s e o f Country Systems 

60. 

The Bank has been in discussion with authorities in M o r o c c o f o r several years to increase 

the use o f country systems in its program. The objective i s to help Morocco bring its national practices 
in line with international good practices on financial management, procurement, as well as i n the areas o f 
environmental and soc ia l safeguards. The context i s that o f the commitments made in the Paris ( 2 0 0 4 ) 
and Accra ( 2 0 0 8 ) Declarations on effectiveness o f development aid. Specifically, “donors agree to use 
country systems as the first option for aid programs in support o f activities managed by the public sector”. 
The government o f Morocco has encouraged the Bank to accelerate its efforts in this area. 

103 

Appendix 3 

61. 
The Moroccan government requested to be a pilot on the U s e o f Country Procurement 
Systems. The assessment o f the Moroccan procurement systems, as per the Pilot program’s 
methodology, i s currently being finalized. I t has concluded that Morocco has an overall solid public 
procurement system. However, four areas o f reform have been identified, which were discussed during a 
National Symposium on Public Procurement organized by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance in April 
2009. According to the pilot program, a mid-term action plan i s to be agreed with the government in 
order to confirm Morocco as a pilot country. The Bank expects to reach such an agreement before the end 
o f 2009. Morocco had also agreed to undergo external bench-marked evaluations o f i t s financial 
management systems (CPAR, CFAA in 2003 and 2007) and the PEFA in 2009. To date, the government 
has demonstrated strong willingness to implement the action plans. 

62. 
Important progress has been made towards adopting a country environmental and social 
protection system in Wo r ld Bank-financed projects particularly regarding the strengthening o f the 
environment protection framework. During the preparation o f the Solid Waste Sector Policy 
Development Project, a fruitful dialogue started with the Moroccan authorities. An evaluation o f the 
environmental protection framework targeted to Waste Management was initiated and the differences 
recorded have in great part been taken into consideration by the sector through convincing regulatory and 
institutional measures, specifically through decentralization o f reviews and approvals o f environmental 
impact studies at the regional level, and also through preliminary public consultations. 

63. 
The Bank provided support to procurement and financial management issues during CAS 
implementation (see Table A3.13 below).

Communications 

64. 
The program has main-streamed communications into Bank Group activities to support 
reforms. This was facilitated by decision makers who were increasingly convinced o f the need to open 
up the dialogue on reforms to a l l socioeconomic actors. The Bank Group was recognized as a trusted 
partner and a strong reform proponent. The communication activities aimed at promoting a better 
understanding o f issues, challenges and reform tradeoffs by a l l development partners to ensure increased 
development effectiveness o f Bank activities and programs. 

65 . 
The communications strategy covering FY 2006-09 was based on the recommendations and 
development challenges identified during the CAS preparation consultations. I t was designed to 
support Bank Group activities in order to achieve CAS strategic objectives. Through focusing on 
promoting dialogue, building awareness and understanding o f the reform process, communication 
activities facilitated consensus-building for reform and contributed to public debate to generate more 
proactive responses and leverage local ideas and inputs. I t was implemented through four pillars - Media 
Outreach, C iv i l Society Engagement, Knowledge Dissemination and Communication for Bank 
Operations. 

Box 1 -C l ien t Feedback 

Interviews o f selected government officials and development partners were conducted during the preparation o f this report. 
Ma jor points highlighted during these consultations include: 
The World Bank Group i s sought after for its financing role, technical assistance, knowledge, and as an interlocutor, 
convener and catalytic force o f other partners. 
I t demonstrated great f lex ib i l i ty in implementing the CAS program, 
showing very good responsiveness to Morocco’s needs and requests. 
The World Bank Group has been instrumental, over the CAS period, i n facilitating and accelerating the pace o f necessary 
reforms in Morocco. Although the financial support i s appreciated, Bank Group i s considered as a key partner that brings 
innovative solutions, catalyzes reforming ideas and helps bringing about change in Morocco. I t i s also valued for its role 
i n voicing areas for improvement. 
DPLs are very we l l appreciated as reform instruments. Although the overall quality o f ESW i s viewed as high, some 
remarks were made concerning the slow completion o f some o f the Bank products. There i s also some concern regarding 
the supply-driven aspect o f some ESW that was undertaken during the CAS period. 
There i s recognition o f the crucial role played by the Country O f f ice i n maintaining regular contacts w i th the government, 
which allows for good coordination and ongoing evaluation o f the partnership strategy. 
More formal consultations w i th government could be held regularly on the overall implementation o f the CAS program. 
This would complement the CAS Progress Report that only allows for stocktaking o f the implementation o f the CAS 
program at the midpoint period. There i s a perception that evaluation o f activities after completion i s not sufficient, 
especially i n the case o f repeater projects, and does not allow assessing the ultimate impact o f projects in improving the 
l i f e o f Moroccan citizens. Similarly, there i s some concern over the need for more and better monitoring and evaluation 
by the government, i n particular regarding the Bank Group’s program indicators. 
There are high expectations on the use o f country systems, and i t wou ld be an important step forward in the relationship 
w i th the Bank. On procurement i n particular, issues faced in the INDH program have led the Bank to provide technical 
support to their Moroccan counterparts, which has proven successful in improving Moroccan capacity and procedures. 
This w i l l be useful to the INDH but also more generally to other Bank projects i n the country. 
The Bank Group acts as a catalyst in many sectors. In education, donor coordination has been particularly success fu l , and 
there are good prospects in the health sector for example. On the government side, discussions are underway in order to 
improve the coordination framework for donor relationships.

Lessons Lea rned 

66. 
Importance of Partnership. The implementation o f the CAS represented a shift in the nature o f 
the relationship between the Bank Group and Morocco from one o f assistance to one o f partnership. This 
shift was illustrated and greatly facilitated by broad-based country dialogue, which became more 
pronounced during implementation. This led directly to adoption by the Bank o f a more flexible 
approach on programming o f activities and lending. Articulating this partnership more explicitly and 
fully should be a priority o f the new CPS. 

67. 
Ensuring Both Continuity and Flexibility. 
Even with the flexible and client-responsive 
approach that drove program adaptation, the four pillars structuring the CAS remained valid throughout 
the program period. Engagement in on-going and new sectors were covered by the pillars. The Bank 
Group’s flexibility was shown through adapting the scope o f the program (for example, engaging in new 
sectors while doing less in others), as well as in timing and instrument choice (for example, with DPLs 
assuming a greater than anticipated share o f lending becoming more important). The overall architecture 
and on-going relevance o f the CAS four pillars were confirmed in the CAS Progress Report. They remain 
a valid starting point in preparing the new CPS. 

68. 
Flexibility in Engagement. Flexibility and responsiveness were not new to the Bank Group’s 
engagement in Morocco, but have now appropriately become the rule rather than the exception. From the 
beginning o f CAS implementation, the Bank Group avoided a narrow interpretation o f i t s activities within 
the somewhat detailed specifics o f the initial CAS program. This was evident early in the CAS cycle 
when opportunities quickly arose for fuller than anticipated in energy and solid waste sectors as well as in 
the nation human development initiative. This flexible approach has allowed the Bank Group to make 
greater contributions to Morocco’s development and has meant a better client-focused program, and 
should continue to be a cornerstone o f the new CPS. 

69. 
Moving from Analysis to Advocacy to Action. The Government appreciated the Bank Group’s 
partnership and flexibility and recognized i t s ability to provide support to areas with the potential for 
path-changing, long-run impact. The Government had a good understanding o f the Bank Group’s 
comparative advantage and regularly confirmed where and how it wanted the Bank to play a role. The 
nature o f engagement was one which moved from analysis, to advocacy and then action through a 
sustained and incrementally larger package o f support (for example, as evident in the support to the 
energy and solid waste sectors). This was a successful and appreciated approach and led to further 
requests for increased f inanc ia l support. 

70. 
Importance o f One World Bank Group. The implementation o f the CAS saw a very close 
collaboration between IFC and IBRD. The broadened and expanded IFC program made important 
contributions to several CAS pillars, aided by mutual knowledge and frequent communication. Joint 
Bank-IFC involvement in the early stages o f analytical exercises or policy advice helped to secure impact. 
The Bank has usually taken the lead in strategic analytical exercises (as with the investment climate 
assessment) or policy advice, while the IFC-through 
i t s advisory services-has 
focused on more 
operational assistance, supporting the implementation o f reforms. Bank s t a f f involved in analytical work 
have systematically been involved in the initial conceptual phase o f IFC’s advisory services projects. In 
the same way, IFC was consulted and involved in the preparation o f analytical pieces by the World Bank. 
This collaboration provides a strong foundation for greater Bank Group synergies and should continue to 
be a central element in the new CPS. 

106 

Appendix 3 

Results 

71. 
Need f o r Greater Adaptation and Realism. The 2005 CAS result matrix was too specific. I t 
contained detailed goals and multiple indicators that were over ambitious. The framework soon 
provedobsolete, as experience quickly showed the need for program flexibility, with consequences for 
changing planned outcomes and deliverables. Even in areas where the Bank did engage as planned, some 
goals were seen as unrealistic and overly ambitious. In others, no baseline information was available, 
making i t difficult to assess progress. The CAS outcome indicators did not match the goals in the results 
frameworks o f some o f the Bank Group’s projects (notably education) which were more realistic and 
should have been used as the basis for assessing the Bank Group’s performance. The lesson learned i s to 
ensure a more reasonable and practical results framework that accounts for the flexibility o f the Bank 
Group’s approach. In this respect, the new CPS results framework should be simplified but dynamic, 
with the intention that i t should evolve as the program evolves. 

72. 
Joint and Dynamic Accountability. There i s a need to work more closely with the Government 
to jointly assess progress and update results and indicators. Monitoring and evaluation o f development 
activities are currently insufficient and there i s a need for a stronger results orientation for both 
Government and Bank Group programs. I n the context o f a Middle Income Country strategy, the Results 
Framework should allow sufficient flexibility to adapt to the evolving program. A t the same time, i t 
should be used as a management tool for both the Bank Group and Government to build management and 
monitoring capacity in Government institutions, including those supported by Bank Group programs. 
This should be pursued through building the capacity o f Government agencies to plan, budget and 
manage for results. The Bank’s project teams w i l l also need t o focus more on helping sectors develop 
M&E systems which would in turn help project data collection and reporting. As the new CPS i s 
implemented, the Bank Group and Government should jointly assess progress and update results and 
indicators to reflect the increased specificity o f the program and to ensure continued joint accountability. 

’ 

73. 
Attribution versus Contribution. 
The results approach in the CAS reflected an overly 
ambitious attempt to show direct attribution o f Bank activities to country outcomes. As a provider of a 
significant yet modest proportion o f international development finance to Morocco, the Bank Group’s 
impact on core development indicators i s limited, making it difficult to measure impact. In some areas 
such as public administration and education, the Bank i s just one o f many development actors and 
finances a relatively small amount o f the overall education program, so i t i s inappropriate to apply a 
standard o f attribution o f outcomes to the Bank’s program. This needs to be taken into account going 
forward. 

Propram Activities 

74. 
Experience with DPLs. The DPL lending instrument became more important in the Bank’s 
program during CAS implementation based mainly on the Government’s expressed preference for this 
type o f support. The tranche or programmatic support o f DPLs created a dynamic o f institutional and 
financial incentives which were conducive to the achievement o f the intended results. In some instances, 
the Government used its commitment to the DPLs as a tool to concretize reforms and overcome the 
administrative ine r t ia and disagreements between responsible  department^'^. I n DPLs, the quality o f the 
underlying technical analysis i s essential to a successful outcome2’. The success o f the DPLs was due in 
large part because there was a strong underlying foundation o f technical analysis that underpinned the 
policy dialogue and reform program. I n particular, the Programmatic ESW (P-ESW) was used very 
effectively in support o f the PARL, energy and water sector DPLs. 

19 

This was a concrete lesson learned as outlined i n the ICR for the Housing Sector DPL but also i s relevant to other sectors. 
2o The ICRs o f the PARL and Financial Sector DPL provide details on this point. 

107 

Appendix 3 

7 5 . 

However, experience from implementing the different DPLs was mixed. I n the case o f the 
PARL and the Financial Sector DPL, the Ministry o f Finance was simultaneously the champion o f 
reforms, the ministry responsible for their implementation and the direct beneficiary o f the DPL funds to 
the national budget. This created a more conducive environment for effective implementation and hence 
success. This was not the case, however, with the Energy, Water or Housing DPLs which involved 
multiple ministries and agencies, thus complicating the reform environment. For a reform approach that 
involves several actors, i t i s essential to have the right level o f coordination and to have a shared 
understanding o f the institutional incentives. Going forward, more attention needs to be placed on how to 
strengthen that coordination. 

76. 
The success of a reform program i s due not only to legal measures taken but also to 
strengthening o f the capacity o f the institutions involved in the reform. The importance o f 
institutional coordination around reforms and their implementation i s also critical. Commitment and 
goodwill alone are not sufficient and i t i s essential to ensure the institutional capacity o f implicated 
agencies to implement their component o f the reform. I n a M IC such as Morocco with a clear sense o f 
the challenges ahead and strategies in place, the Bank Group’s program should focus l e s s on the “what” 
and more on the “how to”. This i s crucial to respond to the main challenges o f the reform process - 
implementation and results. 

77 . 
Donor coordination played an important ro l e in project success and this needs to be further 
reinforced going forward. I n the case o f the PARL, Education and the Rural Roads projects, donors 
provide support on the same program framework that benefited the client by building credibility for the 
reforms but also focusing on a unified expertise from donors i n support to a complex program o f reform 
(particularly the case for the PARL). For the Bank and other donors, this has helped to mitigate the 
reputational risk o f some types o f reforms and has reduced the supervisory burden on each donor. Given 
that there are now clear strategies in place fo r each sector, the onus i s on the donors to really follow 
through on their commitment for greater harmonization through aligning themselves better around these 
strategies and ensuring jo in t implementation o f reform programs and investments. Such efforts at 
harmonization should be central to a l l areas o f Bank Group engagement for the future. 

78. 
The Challenge o f Service Delivery. The experience gleaned from Pillars I1 and 111 o f the CAS 
highlights the long-term challenge o f strengthening service delivery to ensure shared prosperity and 
greater equity. Results in the education sector were perhaps the most muted o f a l l the Bank’s 
interventions and some o f Morocco’s indicators in the soc ia l sectors give rise to concern despite the 
attention and resources provided to address them. A strict focus on access to basic services comes often 
at the expense o f enhancing the quality o f these services for a l l . There i s o f course no quick f ix here but 
rather this demands a second generation o f reforms that reorient service delivery on the users rather than 
providers. Such a shift should underline future Bank Group interventions in this area. 

79 . 
Importance o f a Longer-Term Framework for Certain Activities. Experience from 
implementing the two rural projects (DRI PMH and DR I MVB ) and from implementing the INDH to date 
have shown that bottom-up participatory approaches take time to get o f f the ground and demand a huge 
amount o f careful preparation and capacity building up-front before investments can be rolled out. 
Indeed, o f ten the very creation o f a participatory approach and the necessary management and 
coordination committees are achievements in themselves and can absorb the focus o f the f i r s t phase o f 
project implementation. This obliges a longer-tern focus o f support that continues the partnership 
through this first preparatory phase and into future phases o f implementation and investment. 

80. 
Communications. The CAS launched a broad se r ies o f consultations during i t s preparation and 
this was further advanced during implementation. These consultations nourished priority setting and 
knowledge exchanges and were mainstreamed into the communications strategy o f the Bank Group which 

108 

Appendix 3 

itself was designed to support the achievement o f the CAS strategic objectives. Through focusing on 
promoting dialogue, building awareness and understanding o f the reform process, the Bank Group 
facilitated consensus-building for reform and contributed to feeding the public debate in view o f 
generating more proactive responses and leveraging loca l ideas and inputs. This has been a truly path- 
breaking endeavor in Morocco and should be consolidated during the implementation o f the next CPS. 

81 . 

U s e of Country Systems. Morocco has high expectations for i t s eligibility on the use o f country 
systems. I t has considerably strengthened its public financial management, procurement and safeguards 
procedures. Donors have increasingly assessed Mo rocco to be a good reformer in this regard, with more 
than 80 percent o f donor financing now delivered through country systems, according to the estimate 
made in 2007 in the context o f the Accra process. I t i s therefore important to continue and extend the 
positive collaboration to date. This i s a challenge that must be reflected in the next CPS.

Appendix 4: CONSULTATION REPORT 

Overview 

1. 

. I n development, consulting i s essential at every step o f the process. I n Morocco, the World 
Bank has been engaged for a long time in the regular process o f consultations with the government as 
well as with numerous actors and stakeholders involved in the development o f the country. Consultations, 
conducted in a variety o f formats, took place at strategic planning meetings, during preparation and 
supervision phases o f projects, throughout the preparation and dissemination o f analytical work as well as 
in the monitoring and evaluation phase o f projects. 

2 . 
The a im o f this dialogue was t o better understand the priorities, challenges and obstacles. I t 
also contributed to defining the perceptions, the consensus, as well as the divisions o f opinion and was an 
opportunity to disseminate analytical reports and lessons learned. These consultations also shaped the 
thought process and the approaches as well as the implementation o f programs in the different sectors. 
Consultations for preparing the strategic partnership framework took place over an 18 month period and 
included the following steps: 

Techn ica l meetings. They were primarily focused on sectors, contributed to shaping the 
programmatic choices and guided the dialogue throughout the 18 month period. 

I n t e r n a l consu l ta t ions at the W o r l d Bank . The meetings 
at Kairouan (November 2 0 0 8 ) and Annapolis (March 
2 0 0 9 ) facilitated a joint reflection and cross sectoral 
coordination o f the Bank teams and the IFC to attempt 
to respond in a more concerted way to the needs o f the 
country. 

A s tra teg ic meeting between Mo roccan government 
representatives and a team from the W o r l d Bank 
(Skhirat, Ap r i l 2 0 0 9 ) provided clarification and 
recorded the expectations o f the government in the 
framework o f the partnership. Finally, a phase o f broad 
consultations, directly focusing on preparing the CPS, 
took place during the months o f May and June 2 0 0 9 . 
This report summarizes this most recent phase o f 
consultations. (See highlights t o the right). 

3 . 
Three pr inc ipa l priorities structured the approach o f 
this broad consultation:

Consu l ta t ions - h igh l igh ts 
15 round tables and 4 focus groups, held 
i n Rabat, Sale, Skhirat, Mohammedia, 
Tangier, Fez and Marrakech. 

J More than 330 persons consulted, 
representing different age groups and 
interests : 
- More than 60 N G O members, 
- More than 30 representatives 
from the private sector, 
- More than 150 academics, 
- More than 60 youth, 
students, PhDs, research professors 
and heads o f university. 

J T h e participation o f more than 30 experts 
from the Wo r ld Bank Group, local and 
international at different meetings. 

T o discuss the priorities and the r o l e o f the Wo r ld 
Bank in Morocco: The consultations were structured so as to introduce the World Bank Group’s 
approach to development in order to gather opinions on the development priorities in the country; 
the themes proposed by the CPS (pillars and cross sectoral themes); the role o f the World Bank in 
Morocco, perceptions relating to the efficiency o f i t s activities and its impacts; and the aspects to 
strengthen to better support the country.

T o listen to constituencies w ith weaker voices. A l l voices are important in the development 
process, but not a l l voices have the same impact. A specific effort was made to go and meet the 

121 

Appendix 4 

audiences and the beneficiaries who have the least input in order to listen to their particular 
visions and their perspectives on development priorities in ,Morocco. Particular attention was 
given to youth, women’s NGOs, loca l NGOs (particularly in rural areas), young researchers and 
students. 

T o provide depth to the consultations on the sector specific themes. Thematic consultations 
were conducted on the subjects and/or the sectors that emerged from the discussions during the 
pre CPS consultations phase and that had to be approached through other tools for example: 
gender issues, the knowledge economy, public-private partnership, or the stakes in development 
in rural areas. 

4. 

The second pa r t of the consultation phase organized in M a y and June 2009 was comprised 
of 18 meetings. These meetings were organized according to a variety o f formats (roundtables, broad- 
based meetings, workshops, and brainstorming. Participation was at both loca l and national levels. 
Participants were from different provinces, primarily Rabat, Fes, Casablanca, Tanger, and Marrakech and 
came from rural, semi-urban and urban areas. 

5 . 
These meetings were characterized by an atmosphere that encouraged f r e e and open 
dialogue and they were a r ich and unique experience f o r the M idd le East and No r th Africa 
(MENA ) region. Although the debates were at times passionate when discussing the means and activities 
to implement to concretize the development objectives, there was a broad consensus on the strategic 
direction that emerged from the first phase o f consultations. The criticisms and the suggestions were 
constructive and focused on the future with a common interest to work for the successful transition o f the 
country towards stronger human development and a place in the global economy. Additionally, the 
debates facilitated a progressive and conceptual understanding o f the CPS with the different audiences 
consulted. 

I t should be noted that the opinions expressed in this repor t do not reflect a l l of 
the ideas that 
emerged du r ing the consultations. The opinions represented were repeatedly emphasized, had a 
s trong consensus and took in to consideration the specifics of 
the Wo r ld Bank in terms of areas of 
expertise. Add i t iona l ly , these f ind ings do not c la im to represent any official pos i t ion of any of 
the 
groups or audiences consulted.

Principal Consultations: Debates and Recommendations 

A. 

Investment and development in the private sector 

I.A. 4 Consultations with representatives f rom the pr ivate sector: 

6. 
This meeting, jointly organized w ith the I F C brought together actors from the private 
sector, several of whom worked quite far from the Rabat-Casablanca area. The open and 
constructive debate assisted in forging a new consensus around two priorities considered by the 
participants as being essential elements: 

0 

Importance o f maintaining economic growth as a necessary condition o f development. 
Necessity o f developing a clearly articulated strategic vision o f the Moroccan economy with 
several projects o f reform. 

122 

Appendix 4 

The efforts and the engagement o f the government to improve the business environment was 
acknowledged and emphasized in different discussions; however, several participants brought up the 
persistence o f ce r ta in obstacles to investment particularly concerning the f inanc ia l sector and public 
administration, specifically: 

0 

D i f f icu l ty o f access to bank cred i t and particularly the slow nature o f the process; 
Lack o f visibility on the State’s f isca l policy for the next 5 years; 
Weakness in the correspondence o f education to the employment market and the lack o f qualified 
s ta f f ; 
Slow nature o f the decentralization process and the lack o f transparency within the public 
administration. 

7 . 
Several recommendations were 
formulated and 
particularly emphasized the importance o f reforms in the 

judicial and education sectors. Several participants stated that 
these reforms are essential conditions that cannot be ignored in 
the development of the private sector. Several other suggestions 
covering cross sectoral themes included: 

Strengthening human capital through educational reforms 
and professional training; 
Accelerating the implementation o f industrial policies already developed such as “Emergence” in 
implementing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; 
Initiating a regular and sustainable dialogue with the different decision makers, the financial 
sector and the economic operators; 
Broaden the dialogue with employers in a manner that includes a l l regions o f the country beyond 
the Rabat Casablanca area; 
Adapt the tax system to the specifics o f the Moroccan economic fabr ic while taking into 
consideration the world economic environment and i t s constraints. 

0 

The informal sector was also intensely discussed and brought out diverging points o f view. For certain 
participants, the issue i s o f better controlling the informal sector that i s currently not subject to any tax 
system. Others see the problem as an excess o f taxes and controls that push businesses to the informal 
sector. 

I I .A .4 Consultations on Public Private Partnership (PPP) 

8 . 

This consultation brought together representatives from public establishments and private 
enterprises who manage delegated services to discuss opportunities f o r and constraints to 
developing public private partnerships i n M o r o c c o . Two principal elements were identified as areas 
requiring considerable restructuring: 

T 

\ 

0 The 
legal environment to 
partnerships in Morocco. 
The problem o f underinvestment and lack o f inclusion in 
budgeting o f services. 

f a c i l i t a t e public private 

Several activities and reforms designed to promote public private 
partnerships were formulated: 

“The legislative environment 
remains ineficient and s t i l l 
constitutes an impediment to the 
implementation of numerous 
reforms. l fmany laws exist or are 
produced, there are often gaps and 
inaccuracies and are rarely applied 
and evaluated at the level of their 
application. ’’ 

123 

Appendix 4

I 

“Educa t iona l a n d j u d i c i a l reforms are 
fundamental requirements in any type 
of reform of s i g n i j c a n t stature.” 

Establish a comprehensive legislative framework designed to guarantee the development o f this 
type o f partnership; 
Strengthen the regulatory mechanisms by rewriting the 
legislative texts on the questions o f delegation o f public 
services at the loca l level; 
Establish these regulatory functions at the local level in 
order to move towards decentralization; 
Strengthen transparency in the grants process o f public private partnership contracts; 
Define and clarify the institutional plan o f delegated management and establish the necessary 
institutional mechanisms to improve coordination and arbitration; 
Analyze the budgeting systems for delegated public services, the proposed budgetary allocations 
and the priorities determined by the government; 
Revisit programming and strengthen the levels o f investments which remain insufficient; 
Develop capacities o f central and local c iv i l servants for more efficient management o f public 
private partnerships. 

Most o f the participants also called for more consideration o f the soc ia l implications o f public private 
partnerships. According to certain participants, an overhaul o f the labor law and management laws 
delegated to the public authorities has become a necessity. 

Consultation on the Knowledge Economy: 

9 . 
This consultation brought private operators, academics and representatives o f the public 
administration back together and began by discussing the significant progress that M o r o c c o has 
made in the domain o f information technology and communication both in terms o f infrastructure 
and regulation. The debates that followed the presentation o f the Impact Plan, which aims to implement 
the necessary conditions to make the Knowledge Economy a motor o f economic development in 
Morocco, identified the challenges that need to be met for the promotion o f a knowledge economy. 
The participants unanimously agreed that while Mo rocco has strong potential for developing digital 
content and strengthening human competencies, there are many obstacles that need to be addressed: 

e 
e 

e

e 

Review the pricing policies for information services and strengthen regulation in this sector; 
Respond to the lack o f human resources and the needs o f the sector which constitute a major 
impediment; 
Monitor and evaluate the training linked to this area and establish a reference for this sector. 
Engineering fields, the Universities and the Schools o f Science and Technology should adapt to 
the needs o f the market in this sector; 
Go from the concept o f a Technoparc to that o f Technopole in collaborating with the academic 
community; 
Seriously promote research and innovation that could help this sector create value and wealth; 
Encourage private operators to do more to promote their activities, which would make this sector 
to more attractive to young people. 

B. 

Services to Citizens: 

10. 
The following three cross sectoral elements emerged from the discussions during the first 
phase of consultations and the open debates in the meetings of the second phase o f consultations as 
key elements to improve the impact and consistency o f the reforms. 

124 

Appendix 4 

Involve a l l concerned parties in the development o f reform projects. Support from c iv i l society 
should be better channeled to increase the efficiency o f the reforms; 
Economic policies to strengthen growth should take into consideration the most vulnerable 
populations; 

The different programs in the f igh t against poverty should be better coordinated fo r a 
more comprehensive approach and execution. 

Throughout the meetings, the different audiences who were consulted invited the Bank to provide a more 
detailed analysis o f the Moroccan economy in order to move towards quantitative indicators and an 
examination o f major structural impediments. 

Consultations on the Educat ion Sector 

11 . 

I n a l l consultations, the education sector emerged as being at the heart o f development 

challenges i n Morocco. I n addition, the discussion with the c iv i l society actors, the private sector, 
academics, and public partnerships ra ised the following concerns: 
The quality o f education i s very low and i s still more problematic in the context o f current 
economic changes in Morocco. 
Reforming the education system should be considered the highest priority in terms o f reforms and 
particular attention should be focused on the quality o f teaching and informal education. 
The following conclusions and recommendations emerged from the consultations conducted with the 
actors and representatives from the different sectors: 
0 Despite a relevant assessment and a strategic vision o f the 
government and 
the 
principal actors, effective 
implementation remains challenged by a number o f 
problems that impede reform; 
Involvement o f a l l key actors in the discussions on education reforms i s necessary through a long 
term, yearly dialogue; 
Improve governance in the education system through strengthening the responsibility and 
investment in the capacities o f teachers; 
Improve the evaluation and monitoring system in the entire education sector and establish some 
quality norms; 
Promo te the decentralization o f the education system and reexamine the budgeting system in the 
sector as well as the mechanisms and processes o f 
execution; 
If we do not improve governance, w e 
0 Analyze and update the content o f pedagogical manuals mnno t su c c e ed in improv ing the 
education sector. 
and teacher training.

sector in the counrry, we should 
invest in education- in the t ra in ing o f 
the next generation. ”

12. 

The debate on public education vs. private education 

was characterized by several diverging views. Although several participants recommended regulation 
o f the private education sector, i t was also suggested that both private and informal education alternatives 
be encouraged, especially in rural areas. A third suggestion was made to strengthen partnerships between 
the actors in the private and public sectors. As for higher education, the participants expressed their 
satisfaction with the launching o f the Urgent Plan for the Acceleration o f the Implementation o f 
Education Reform and Training 2009-20 1 1. However, they insisted that i s necessary to emphasize the 
value o f scientific research in Morocco and the importance o f including the university in the development 
o f socio economic research. Several participants brought up the problem o f the territorial approach o f 
development and the importance o f considering the university community as an essential partner to 
resolve specific problems o f development to each region.

Consultations on reforming the jud ic ia l system 

Appendix 4 

13 . Reform o f the judicial system was brought up in the ma jor ity o f consultations as being a 

development pr ior ity in M o r o c c o . The different actors who were consulted shared similar points o f 
view and there was an overwhelming consensus that reform o f the judicial system was an essential 
condition for success and consistent reforms in the other socio economic sectors. The consultation session 
on the judicial sector also invited back representatives from a network o f 10 Moroccan associations that 
had introduced a memorandum calling for reform in the judicial sector in Morocco. Throughout the 
discussion o f suggestions contained in the memorandum and the debate that followed, important elements 
emerged as priorities in formulating a strategy for reform that would be both voluntary and ambitious: 
Reform should be comprehensive in developing a strategy that strengthens the development o f a 
modern equitable judicial system; 
Implementation o f evaluation and 
performance 
mechanisms, the efficiency o f the court system as well as 
the quality o f judgments; 
Zmprove the functioning o f the judicial system, and also 
access to justice; 
Implementation 
a mechanism 
independence to the judicial system; 
0 Strengthen mechanisms o f transparency and combating 
corruption; 
Reform of the penal code, penitentiary establishments, and the revision o f training systems for 
judges and lawyers. 

There is a problem w i t h evaluating 
the performance ofjudges. The 
measure of their effectiveness is 
calculated by the number of closed 
cases without reviewing the in teg r iq 
of 
their decisions.

Gender and Development 

14. 

Two consultations were organized around the crosscutting theme o f gender. The first meeting 

gathered representatives from development associations, economists and sociologists specializing in 
gender. The second meeting was held with female members o f parliament. The results that emerged in 
these two meetings confirm that the advances in terms o f reforms for a better integration o f gender 
aspects are undeniable, notably in the sectoral plan. However, the lack o f consistency and coordination o f 
sectoral actions denotes the absence o f a national strategy incorporating gender. The following 
recommendations were formulated as being necessary conditions to ensure an equitable and sustainable 
development in a l l the,sectors: 
Education reform and strengthening women’s access to 
the judicial system (particularly thorough training) are 
crucial to the empowerment o f women. 
I n dept, analyses and cross sectoral studies on gender 
should be conducted to serve as the foundation o f a 
comprehensive national strategy that could then be used 
at the sectoral level. 
Analysis o f the impact o f the global economic crisis on 
employment and women’s role in the labor force should 
be conducted immediately because the sectors that are 
threatened are essentially those that w i l l impact women in 
terms o f business and employment. 
Participants invited the World Bank to play a more active role 
proposing appropriate analyses in providing the technical base for 

“There is also ap rob lem w i th the 
lack of re l iab le statistics. Fo r 
example, at the level of continuing 
education we do not have any 
f igures for women. 

“The costs of reproduction weigh 
heavily on the da i ly l i fe and the 
future of women and stress the 
economic capacity. 

“ I t is necessary to develop gender 
expertise that effectively serves the 
communes and loca l associations. ”

Governance, Development and Basic Services 
The governance aspect i n the sense o f access to basic services by citizens was raised as an 
issue. A wide consensus was reached in the consultations on the following axes: 

1 5 . 

0 

Balance between economic and soc ia l issues needs to be maintained through better distribution o f 
the outputs o f growth; 
The success o f reforms i s measured according to the impact on the daily lives o f citizens. 
Monitoring and evaluation o f results o f the reforms i s absolutely necessary; 
Monitoring and evaluation o f results o f the reforms w i l l bring improvement in poverty reduction 
programs and should therefore serve as a reference to measure the results that show 
accountability for funds. 
This approach has a direct impact on the improvement o f governance.

Consultations on Governance and Citizen Services 

16. M o r o c c o has a large variety o f associations that have an important r o l e to play in the 
development of the country in a dynamic and constructive approach. The consultations with the 

consumer associations, who are an important component o f the Moroccan association community, 
allowed for the gathering o f opinions on the obstacles that inhibit 
performance in certain key sectors such as education, health and 
the judicial system. The absence o f evaluation mechanisms and 
ensuring accountability in public administration were recurring 
points that emerged from the consultations. The importance o f 
strengthening the mechanisms o f evaluation and transparency in 
terms o f delegation o f management o f public services was strongly underlined. 
The majority o f participants identified the problems o f governance at three levels: 
The lack o f mechanisms and transparent procedures encourage abuse; 

0 

0 

0 

Inadequate access to information leads to a lack o f understanding o f rights and c iv ic 
duties; 
The absence o f effective monitoring and evaluation takes responsibility away f rom the 
managers. 

These three elements demonstrate a c lose 
link between the 
efficiency o f public and private services and good governance. 

“Good governance is based on 
shar ing information. Unfortunately, 
this is not happening. ” 

Consultation on governance and local development 

17. 
This roundtable, comprised o f representatives 
o f the association community from the north, focused on the following themes: The important 

socioeconomic transformations put the governance at the core o f the problem in local development. The 
participants raised the point that the lack o f good governance i s an obstacle to loca l development and 
produces a loss o f confidence o f the population in the public management. They a l l identified the need to:

“The goal of 
the reforms is to 
modernize agriculture and make i t

benefitting the ru ra l population. The 
question to be asked is about 
adaptation to the context and the

19. 
This consultation session brought together economists 
and sociologists specializing in ru ra l development as well as 
representatives from professional associations. The Morocco 
Green Plan was cited by several participants as being open to new approaches, but does not contain 
detailed activities and does not clearly state what the eventual 
impact on the agricultural and rural development sec tors w i l l be. 
Additionally, the participants identified that there are multiple 
challenges with the agriculture sector including the management 
o f water resources, access to financing, land reform, improvement 
o f rural infrastructure and tax issues. 
The participants made several recommendations including: 
Improve the dialogue between the operators in the sector 
and 
the government 
in order 
to succeed 
in the 
implementation o f the Mo rocco Green Plan; 
Find solutions for threatened aquifers that over exploited, particularly in desert zones where 
ecosystems have been threatened or destroyed; 
Analyze finance mechanisms o f agribusinesses with support from professional agriculture 
organizations; 
Promote the transfer o f technology and skills in the framework o f the Green Plan and evaluate the 
different results in terms o f rural infrastructure before launching new initiatives; 
Strengthen interprofessional legislation in order to encourage coordination and development o f 
synergies between the different agricultural entities; 
Accelerate land reform to encourage private investment in 
rural areas, prudently approach the question o f change o f many nationalprograms: PERG 
usage

introduce systematic 
compensation for women’s rights; 
Improve the training o f administrators, specifically in

Youth: Actors in Development? 

20. 
Two meetings were organized w i th youth groups concerning pr ior ity activities and reform in 
M o r o c c o . The first meeting was a roundtable with young members o f NGOs and the second meeting 
included four focus groups in the field in several semi urban neighborhoods. The participants emphasized 
the importance o f the crosscutting nature o f the following stakes: 

0 

Soc ia l and economic integration o f youth; 
Appropriate training/employment considering the needs o f the private sector; 
The rural exodus that accentuates the vulnerability and the poverty in a semi urban neighborhood 
aggravated by the weakness o f traditional soc ia l solidarity; 
0 Accelerated urbanization and the precarious nature o f 
community infrastructure; 
Inequalities are pronounced, particularly in terms o f 
economic opportunities and employment as well as 
political participation. 

Taking the example of the necessity 
to better integrate gender in the 
reform process, it i s also important 
to consider the ro le of youth in 
development. ’’

Several recommendations were made: 

0 Conduct a sectoral and regional social analysis on youth to support the formulation o f 
adapted policies and strategies; 
Strengthen transparency mechanisms and encourage youth to participate in the 
development o f social policies. 

F. 

Decentralization 

2 1. 
Throughout the many consultations, the theme o f decentralization continued to emerge. The 
necessity o f strengthening the decentralization process was continuously raised by the participants. For 
several participants, territoriality i s a key requirement for equitable and supported development. The 
following recommendations were provided: 

0 

0 Analyze and initiate a dialogue on the framework o f 
decentralization with the different development priorities 
and the reforms already launched; 
Strengthen the decentralization process by supporting a strategic and global vision; 
Analyze the problems o f budgeting and financial management at the loca l level (arbitration, 
allocations, procedures); 
Be vigilant in ensuring that investments destined for regions are made in an equitable manner and 
that they correspond to loca l needs.

The meeting w ith 
the

in 
development allowed 
for 
the discussion and 
information 
dissemination on the program o f activities and the areas where 
cooperation can be strengthened in order to better serve the 
development o f M o r o c c o . Participants noted that: 

“Rea l decentralization is 
imperative in responding 
to local needs. There is 
also an absence of coordination 
and consistency between the 
national, regional and 
local levels. ” 

0 The different sectors and program o f activities of the World 
Bank and their own programs in Mo rocco are complementary. 
0 The programs established by the Moroccan government 
constitute a direct l i n e that helps to facilitate the partnership activities. 
0 The questions o f development are territorial and adaptation to the changing climate constitutes 
areas where collaborative opportunities between different donor agencies can be developed. 
Coordination between different funding agencies should be developed more in terms o f collaboration and 
simplicity, to ensure more efficiency fo r development aid.

Appendix 4 

Poverty and statistical information 

24. 
This question was widely emphasized by numerous participants during different 
consultations. According to the participants: 

More detailed impact analyses are necessary for the government to formulate policies that 
respond to the challenges in the priority sectors, particularly justice, education and governance. 
Support the efforts o f the High Commission Plan to develop the statistics by gender in the areas 
such as poverty, the standard o f living, work o f rural women and other areas for which there i s 
relatively l i t t l e statistical information. 
Raw s ta t is t ica l disaggregated data should be accessible to actors in development, particularly to 
researchers.

Implementation of reforms 

25. 
This key theme continued to recur and was the subject o f several discussion threads in the different 
meetings. The participants expressed the following points o f view: 

0 

If the reports are objective and the strategies are defined, the actual challenge for the country i s 
the effective and efficient implementation o f reforms. 
A cross sectoral consistency o f reforms i s essential given the interdependence o f sectors 
Certain participants also expressed their wish that the World Bank Group improve their performance 
indicators to fac i l i ta te the monitoring o f reforms in which they participate.

Social protection and f igh t against exclusion 

26. 

This subject was raised 
in a recurrent and crosscutting manner throughout the 
consultations. I t came up in most o f the interventions in the framework o f the following observations: 

An analysis o f results and real impact o f programs in the fight against poverty i s necessary; 
I t i s necessary to introduce implementation o f a rea l policy o f social protection particularly in 
extending 
the coverage o f social security and in strengthening the mechanisms o f the fight 
against social exclusion (youth and women); 
I t i s important to consider the vulnerable segments o f the population who can be affected by 
reforms; 
Specific studies should be conducted to better identify the needs o f cer ta in vulnerable categories 
o f society; 
The changes which are directly discernable for the users should be placed at the heart o f programs 
o f development in Morocco.

Appendix 5: USE OF COUNTRY SYSTEMS 

1 . 

This note summarizes the Bank’s overall view o f country systems in Morocco today, the process 
underway to improve such systems, and the direction for furthering the Bank/MOG partnership on use o f 
country systems during the CPS 20 10 to 20 13 .2 ’ 

I. Country systems in Morocco today 

2. 

F inanc ia l management. The five main components o f country systems are budgeting, 
accounting and financial reporting, treasury management, internal controls and in te rna l audit, and external 
audit. The Bank’s experience in Morocco, the CFAAs (2003 and an update in 2007), and the PEFA 
review (2009) indicate that the public financial management system i s governed by an elaborate legal and 
regulatory framework including a strict control framework that has ensured a high degree o f reliability o f 
the accounts and transparency. The public financial management cadre i s o f good quality. I n general, the 
Moroccan public finance system i s considered to pose a low fiduciary risk. Bank-funded projects are 
fu l ly integrated in the government annual budget. Bank financed projects are also integrated in the 
government accounting system. The Bank has long relied on the government treasury system for 
effecting project expenditures. Bank funded projects are subject to the existing national internal control 
system for control o f commitments and payments. Annual audits o f Bank-financed projects on the other 
hand are carried out by the Inspection Ge‘ne‘rale des Finances (IGF) and reporting on donor funded 
activities i s based on parallel systems. 

3 . 
Procurement. The Moroccan public procurement system i s considered one o f those in the M N A 
Region most i n line with international best practice, the results o f a major reform process underway s ince 
1998. The system comprises the framework o f laws and regulations; procurement procedures, capacity 
and staffing; how these procedures are applied in practice; and measures to ensure integrity. The 
governing laws and regulations largely follow international practice, a view generally endorsed by the 
administration, the private sector and c iv i l society. Public finance, including procurement, generally 
benefits from a strong and effective audit culture. Bank reviews, notably the CPAR (2008), PEFA review 
(2009), and a further internal procurement review” a l l generally note that overall fiduciary risk i s low. 
Bank evaluation o f national systems has allowed use o f relatively high thresholds for national competitive 
bidding in the Bank’s portfolio o f investment operations. A t the same time, the laws and regulations o f 
the government do not apply to public enterprises (many o f whom, however, have alternative strong 
systems and human resources), architectural services, and concessions. There i s not yet an effective 
complaints mechanism in place. 

4. 

The quality o f the Moroccan procurement system has evolved very positively during the last 
10 years. The revision o f the public procurement decree led to improvements, such as an increase in the 
minimum bid preparation period for high value contracts, the implementation o f electronic publication o f 
procurement and award notices encompassing the largest part o f public procurement packages, and the 
reinforcement o f measures aimed at the prevention o f fraud and corruption. Standard bidding documents 
for goods and works were put in place in 2009. Further reform o f the public procurement control 
mechanisms i s ongoing. 
International arbitration in contracts and bidding documents has been 
introduced. A Central Body for Prevention o f Fraud and Corruption has been created. I n addition to the 
above, other reform activities under preparation include: preparation o f General Conditions o f Contract 
for Goods and Services, amendment o f the General Conditions o f Contract for Works, and preparation o f

regulations related to the Public private partnership law. 

5 . 
Social and environmental safeguards. Important progress has been made in this area, especially 
during 2008, particularly regarding the strengthening o f the environment protection framework. 
Preparation o f the Solid Waste Sector Policy Development Project in 2007 saw the start o f a dialogue 
with the authorities in this area. An evaluation o f the environmental protection framework targeted to 
waste management was initiated and the differences recorded have largely been taken into consideration 
by the sector 
through significant regulatory and 
institutional measures, specifically through 
decentralization o f reviews and approvals o f environmental impact studies at the regional level, and also 
through the introduction o f a public consultation process during the environmental assessment process. 
The process now being followed to fill major gaps between the Moroccan system and internally accepted 
principles and practices i s described in paragraph 9 below. 

11. 

Process to improve country systems 

6 . 
F inanc ia l management. U s e o f country systems in financial management (and other areas) 
contributes to scaled-up development impact, increased country ownership, better capacity, donor 
harmonization, and increased cost-effectiveness, For these reasons they are, where feasible, the default 
option for implementing Bank-supported projects. The Bank has identified areas where improvements 
can be made, on which i t i s in dialogue with national authorities. These include reduced delays in 
drafting annual financial statements, greater use o f the recently-completed integrated system (GID) to 
track and report on a l l expenditures, a stronger internal audit function in line Ministries in order to 
provide an assurance on the soundness of, and compliance with internal controls in the light o f the 
ongoing reforms, and the move from the ex-ante to ex-post controls and greater accountability o f public 
sector managers. Greater reliance on country systems and institutions requires a shift o f the independent 
audit function o f donor-funded activities to the National Audit institution, the Cour des comptes, an 
institution that has seen major reforms and improvements and alignment with international standards over 
the past few years. 

7. 
Procurement. The Bank and the government have been in dialogue on procurement reform for 
many years. Dialogue includes other leading donors, and i s considered by the Bank to be intense and 
productive. Morocco confirmed its in teres t in becoming a candidate for the pilot use o f country 
procurement systems approved by the Bank board in Ap r i l 2008, the f i r s t country in the M N A Region to 
do so. In a recent report on the use o f country procurement systems, Morocco received relatively high 
evaluation scores, clearing 43 c r i te r ia out o f the 5 5 defined by the OECD/DAC methodology, one o f the 
highest scores recorded.23 A t the same time, some o f the criteria on which i t did not attract an adequate 
score w i l l require action before country systems can be used. Morocco i s a leader in providing electronic 
access to public procurement information and processes (see www.marchespublics.lzov.ma), and has 
launched initiatives to promote e-procurement. 

8. 

The key improvement f o r meeting the UCS piloting program has been identified as follows: 
Lega l f iamework (ensure broad legal consistency o f public procurement policies and principles o f 
a l l public procuring entities and covering a l l types o f goods, works and services through a public 
procurement law covering a l l public entities and a l l types o f goods, works and services; ensure 
that “objective qualification and evaluation criteria” specified in the public procurement decree 
are reflected in the standard bidding documents; and develop/amend the general conditions of 
contract for further alignment with international best practices and recent evolution within the 
Moroccan public procurement framework).

In teg r i ty i n pub l ic procuremen t system (restructure the complaints mechanism towards a system 
that i s independent, efficient, transparent, having the authority to suspend the ongoing 
procurement and to make binding decisions; put in place an effective internal control mechanism; 
and provide additional staff and resources to the entity responsible for fighting fraud and 
corruption to allow i t to carry out its mandate effectively). 
The Bank hopes to reach agreement with the government shortly on an action plan (as foreseen in the 
approved pilot program) to address these issues. 

Social and environmental safeguards. 

9 . 
The Bank i s expanding the process described in 
paragraph 5 to include the water and sanitation sector through a project currently under preparation (Oum 
E r Rb ia San i ta t ion P ro jec t ) . With regards to soc ia l safeguards, more specifically projects involving 
involuntary resettlement o f people, land acquisition, or expropriation fo r public use, the Bank intends to 
identify and seek to resolve known differences through a process similar to that applied to environmental 
safeguards. This w i l l involve analysis o f the equivalence between Morocco’s regulatory and institutional 
framework and the principles that constitute the basis o f World Bank policies. This w i l l be followed by 
an evaluation o f the acceptability o f the implementation modalities o f this framework. The Bank has 
initiated this approach in the preparation phase o f the Oum E r Rb ia San i ta t ion P ro jec t . This approach w i l l 
allow a deeper dialogue between Moroccan authorities and the Bank towards harmonizing the systems 
applicable to these aspects and also towards gradually using Moroccan environmental and social 
safeguards systems in Bank-financed projects. 

111. 

Advancing U s e o f Country Systems i n the CPS 

10. 
Government o f Morocco has consistently been requesting the Bank and other donors to 
make increased use o f country systems, in line w ith their commitments to do so i n the Paris 
Declaration (2005) and Accra Agenda f o r Action (2008).24 I t wishes to see tangible progress made in 
Morocco toward this objective during CPS implementation. According to the 2008 Survey on the 
implementation o f the Paris declaration, the proportion o f donors financing disbursed through what can 
broadly be described as national systems has been increasing, budget support contributing largely to these 
results. Building on the processes described above, the Bank w i l l sustain its partnership with the 
government to assess systems, identify directions for improvements, invest in capacity building and 
accompany change implementation, with the objective o f progressively increasing the use o f country 
systems. 

24 Paragraph 1 5 o f the Accra Agenda for Action states that “Donors agree to use country systems as the first option for aid 
programs i n support o f activities managed by the public sector [...I Should donors choose to use another option and re ly on 
aid delivery mechanisms outside country systems (including parallel project implementation units), they w i l l transparently 
state the rationale for this and w i l l review their positions at regular intervals.”

Appendix 6 

Append ix 6: DONORS’ DEPLOYMENT 

I. Ove rv iew 

1 . 
Morocco has good relations w i th its development partners, aided by a national vision fo r the 
country’s development and by its development achievements, particularly over the past ten years. 
There i s broad support among Morocco’s donors for its chosen strategic direction. 
2 . 
M o s t donor programs have aimed to align w ith the government program that was approved 
by Parliament in October 2007. The individual sectoral strategies and medium-term expenditure 
frameworks that have been laid out since then present a good framework for donors to deliver their 
support more effectively. 
Donor programs in M o r o c c o - especially those o f the large donors - have seen increasing 
3 . 
volumes of financing over the past few years. The increased financial support reflects recognition o f 
Morocco’s leadership o f the national development e f for t , support for the approved national program, and 
a demonstrated track record o f achievement. Around eighty percent o f donor financing in the last three 
years was disbursed using what can be broadly described as national systems either through budgetary 
support or other instruments. Budgetary support i s widely used by Morocco’s larger donors-the 
European Union (where i t exceeds 90 percent), the African Development Bank, and the World Bank- 
and i s becoming an increasingly important instrument for bilateral donors. 
4. 
Overall, donor coordination has improved in recent years, and i s relatively good. Donors 
are willing to cooperate closely around the government program. The responsibility to oversee donor’s 
programs i s shared across three different ministries in Morocco (Ministry o f Finance, Ministry o f Foreign 
Affairs and Ministry o f Economic and General Affairs). The government has indicated that it wishes to 
see more progress made more quickly on implementing the principles and commitments o f the 
international aid effectiveness agenda, adapted as appropriate to Moroccan circumstances. There i s scope 
fo r improvement by donors in this area. Donors are making progress to ensure harmonized upstream 
country and sector programming. Greater harmonization was facilitated in 2009 when four o f Morocco’s 
main donors - World Bank, AfDB, AFD and EU - a l l either prepared a new strategy (World Bank and 
AFD) or updated their strategies at the mid-way point (EU and AfDB), with broad national and cross- 
donor consultation and collaboration a feature o f the process o f each. 
5 . 
Donor collaboration has been strongest in those areas in which donors have been engaged 
over the long-term, such as public administration, education, and .transport, and in more recent 
pr ior ity areas such as the National In it iat ive for Human Development (Table A8.1). Furthermore, 
there i s good recognition o f the relative competences and areas o f comparative advantage o f each donor: 
fo r example, the EU i s taking the lead among donors on gender and human rights issues, while EIB i s 
heavily involved in infrastructure investments. 
Donor aid accounts for a small proportion o f government financing - between 4 and 5% in 
2007 - albeit higher than in many other middle income c ~un t r i e s . ’ ~ More than 95 percent o f a l l 
reported sources in 2007 came from the seven largest donors (France, EC, Germany, Japan, Spain, Italy, 
and the US). A id volumes have been increasing over time, more than doubling from 2004 to 2007. 
addition to official development assistance (ODA), IBRD commitments and gross disbursements have 
averaged $280 million and $284.5 million respectively in the last four f i s c a l years. Annual lending from 
the A fDB has been in a similar range. 

In 

6 . 

*’ ODA to Morocco in 2007 was $1.3 b i l l ion (source: OECD DAC database). This excludes financing provided by IBRD (to 
whom debt repayments largely equal disbursements in recent years) and A fDB .

Paris Declaration on A id Effectiveness 

7 . 

I n recent years, around 80 percent o f donor financing was disbursed using national budget, 
financial reporting and auditing, and procurement procedures either through budget support 
operations o r projects making use o f country systems. The large majority o f donor financing i s 

directed to the government sector (World Bank - 96%, A fD B - 93% and EU - 90%) . A significant 
portion o f the programs o f some bilaterals, such as Spain, Germany and Canada, i s delivered to the non- 
government sector. 

8 . 

A survey in 2008 into implementation o f the Paris Declaration in Morocco revealed a 

broadly positive message. A t the same time, i t recognized that donors could do more to align better w i th 
government program and concluded with a shared understanding o f the need to make progress on more 
streamlined and harmonized results management. Discussions with the government reveal impatience to 
see implementation deepened and accelerated.

The M a i n Donors i n Morocco 

9. 
The European Un ion program i s set in the context o f the EU Neighborhood Policy.26 Since 
2000, Morocco and the EU have increased significantly their cooperation and integration through the 
signing o f many bilateral agreements. Most important was the signature o f the Association Agreement 
which entered into force in 2000. 
In 2008, the European Union and Morocco further strengthened 
relations when Morocco was accorded “Advanced Association” status (see Box A6.1 below). 

10. 
Morocco receives financial support from the European Neighborhood and Partnership 
grant instrument. The EU grants an increasing proportion o f that assistance in the form o f budgetary 
support for the implementation o f Morocco’s major structural reforms (90 percent o f EU aid i s now 
delivered through budget support). The current financial programming covers the period 2007-201 0 and 
involves a total commitment for the EU-Morocco partnership program o f 698 million Euros, equivalent to 
$1,033 million. Specifically for 2009, financing w i l l be in the order o f 3 17 million Euros ($469 million), 
compared to 228 m i l l ion Euros ( $ 3 3 7 million) delivered in 2008.

Box A6.1: Morocco’s EU Advanced Association Status M a i n Measures 

- 

Morocco i s the first and only southern Mediterranean country to obtain Advanced Association Status w i th the EU, which was 
granted i n 2008. The advanced status means an increase i n EU aid, participation i n several European agencies, and a generally 
more favorable position w i th in the overall E U neighborhood po l icy . I t constitutes an ambitious roadmap for the years to come, i n 
particular: 
I n the po l i t ica l f ie ld : establishment, on an ad hoc basis, o f an EU-Morocco summit, ministerial-level consultation 
mechanisms, an inv i ta t ion to Morocco to be present i n the wings o f certain E U Council ministerial or working group 
meetings, negotiation o f a framework agreement for Morocco’s participation in crisis-management operations; and 
strengthening dialogue channels between bo th parties’ legislative institutions, in order to br ing Morocco’s legislation 
closer to that o f the EU. 
Economically, both partners w i l l seek to develop a comprehensive and deeper free trade agreement covering new 
areas such as public procurement, intellectual property rights, capital movements, competition and sustainable 
development. 
Other po l icy matters to be pursued include: harmonization o f laws and rules i n a gradual process beginning w i th 
pr ior i ty sectors; the gradual integration o f Morocco into a number o f EU sectoral policies; and the development o f 
people-to-people exchanges. 
International security: Morocco’s participation, systematically, i n the EU’s peace keeping operation, without having to 
negotiate the terms o f each operation.

The European Un ion i s finalizing i t s Indicative National Program (Programme Zndicatif 
National - P I N which covers the 2011-2013 period and i s based on the folIowing pr ior ity axes: (i) 
development o f social policy; (ii) economic modernization; (iii) institutional support; (iv) good 
governance and human rights; and (v) protection o f environment. I t i s expected that financing for this 
program w i l l be greater than i n the past. Initial indications are that the program w i l l exceed 165 million 
Euros per year. 

12. 
The EuroDean Investment Bank (EIB) has been active in Morocco since 1978. Morocco, 
Egypt and Tunisia are the three largest users o f EIB funding in the region, w ith Morocco claiming 
a share o f about 20% o f dedicated regional resources. The main focus o f EIB’s investments in 
Morocco i s infrastructure, particularly energy, transport and water sectors and this focus i s expected 
should continue in the next three years. Development o f the private sector, particularly small and 
medium-sized enterprises, and creating a favorable investment climate are also priorities o f the EIB’s 

26 Wor ld Bank relations w i th the European Commission and the European Investment Bank i n the M E N A region are structured 
around the Strategic Partnership Agreement i n the M idd le East and No r th A f r ica Region M o U (signed i n May 2004 and 
jo ined by IFC in 2007) and the Luxemburg Group process. The Luxembourg Group brings together the EC-E IB-WB- IFC- 
I M F for high-level consultations semi-annually since 2002 to discuss common strategic and operational issues in the region.

program. More recently, i t has increased i t s support to the education sector, alongside with the Bank, 
with a euro 200 million contribution in 2009. The total current program o f the E IB i s 744 million Euros 
(equivalent to $1,101 million) to cover a three year period. 

13 . 
The Morocco program o f the Afr ican Development Bank (AfDB) makes i t the largest o f a l l 
the AfDB’s client countries w ith total financing to date reaching $9 billion. The program i s forecast 
to continue to grow. Having delivered $327 m i l l ion (220 m i l l ion SDR) in new lending in 2008, i t aims to 
more than double this to $745 million (500 m i l l ion SDR) in 2009. The strategy for the A fDB in Morocco 
for the period 2007-201 1 was assessed at the mid-term point in 2009 and confirmed as being on-track and 
appropriate. I t i s focused on three pillars: (1) strengthening o f governance; (2) development and upgrade 
o f infrastructure and enterprises; and (3) promotion o f human development. 
The French development agency - Agence Francaise de DCveloppement (AFD ) - has been 
14. 
present in Morocco since 1992 and has focused its assistance on: (1) support to the social sectors 
(education and health); (2) private sector development; and (30 infrastructure investments in roads, 
transport and energy. AFD’s strategy for 2007-2009 provided 460 million Euros ($680 million) and this 
i s expected to increase for the 2010-2012 period. In 2007, AFD disbursed $ 1 8 7 m i l l ion in assistance o f 
which $125 million went to Government with the rest allocated to non-state actors such as the private 
sector and NGOs. Increasingly, the program o f AFD w i l l place an accent on non-sovereign financing. 

1 5 . 
M o r o c c o i s the largest recipient o f Spanish development financing w ith disbursements 
estimated by Spain i n the context o f the 2008 Survey on the Paris Declaration a t $285 million in 
2007. The Spanish program i s unique in Morocco because i t involves multiple actors including both 
central government and decentralized regional governments in Spain that each have their own programs 
with central government in Morocco and decentralized regional entities (e.g. Tangiers municipality). The 
program i s focused on three main sectors: (1) basic social needs - health, education, water, housing; (2) 
governance and institutional strengthening; and (3) economic development. Spain i s also orientating 
some o f i t s development financing towards budget support and i s planning to deliver budget support in 
the health sector, in harmonization with the EU program. 

16. 
The M i l lenn ium ChallenPe Account (MCA ) was agreed by the United States w i th Morocco 
i n August 2007, fo r a five year period and for a total amount o f US$696 million. This marked a 
major new chapter in the relationship between Morocco and the United States and substantially 
supplements the USAID program, which disbursed $20 million in 2007. The MCA focuses on 
contributing to enhance economic growth, by increasing productivity as well as improving employment, 
and has the following components: ( 1 ) investing in fruit tree productivity (US$300 million); (2) small- 
scale fisheries (US$ 116 million); (3) artisan crafts and Fez medina (US$ 112 million); (4) financial 
services and support to enterprises (USD 80 million); and (5) administrative, monitoring and evaluation 
(USD 88 million).

Appendix 7: TRUST FUND M A N A G E M E N T 

Appendix 7 

1. 

The Bank’s program makes significant use o f Trust Fund (TF) financing, mainly in support 
o f analytical work. This has facilitated the Bank’s ability to respond to government requests for support 
and address emerging development issues in a flexible and prompt manner. The TF program has helped 
the Bank deliver a broader knowledge program, including in some cutting-edge areas, and to pilot 
innovative approaches. This knowledge then feeds into the design o f Bank projects and programs. The 
audience includes policy-makers, academics, Bank staff, private sector, multilateral and bilateral donors. 

2. 
This CPS w i l l build on this foundation, ensuring that TFs adapt to support the objectives o f 
the strategy. The program w i l l be guided by the following principles: (i) ownership by government; ( i i ) 
alignment with CPS objectives; (iii) complementary to other Bank activities; (iv) findings disseminated to 
inform the design o f future national and donor-supported programs, and (v) selectivity in deployment. 

3 . 
The TF program i s organized according to CPS pillars. 
This alignment facilitates 
assessment o f results. The total TF portfolio comprises 26 activities amounting to $64.5 million in ten 
sectors (public sector management, soc ia l protection, transport, health, education, human development, 
climate change, agriculture, water, energy and inclusion). O f this, $43.2 million i s fo r one GEF-financed 
project supporting and integrated solar combined-cycle power plant. Other sizeable activities in the TF 
portfolio in terms o f financing include the GPOBA pilots fo r water supply and sanitation (total o f $ 7 
million), the GEF Africa Stockpile program ($4 million) and a JSDF grant for capacity building to 
improve schooling for the poor ($2.2 million). The rest o f the portfolio ($8.1 million) i s aimed at 
knowledge services and capacity building. 

4. 
TF supported activities provide valuable analytical underpinnings for IBRD’s DPL 
programs. Areas that benefit include public sector management, the energy sector, and the water sector. 
The education sector has made innovative use o f TFs by supporting the testing o f Conditional Cash 
Transfer (CCT) pilots fo r rural schools which aim to improve the transparency, accountability and 
effectiveness o f service delivery i n the education sector. Related analytical work influences education 
policy reforms supported through the Education DPL. The lessons learnt from the CCT pilot and its 
evaluation are expected to be useful to the broader development community in Morocco. TFs on climate 
change, a priority CPS area, have expanded. They help develop a better understanding among Moroccan 
decision makers and development partners o f the impacts o f CC and the policy measures or other actions 
needed to respond. They use participatory research techniques for building analytical models and 
predictive scenarios. They help define work that can be carried out under forthcoming projects.
