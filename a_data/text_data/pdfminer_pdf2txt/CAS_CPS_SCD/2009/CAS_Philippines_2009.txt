EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

i. 
The Philippines’ Development Challenges.  In recent years, the Philippines’ economic 
growth has rebounded on the back of fiscal consolidation, macroeconomic stability and a strong 
international economic environment.  Higher growth has, however, not translated into less poverty: the 
share of the population below the poverty line is the same as it was a decade ago and has increased 
between 2003 and 2006.  Income inequality remains high, and the country risks missing MDGs on 
education and maternal health.  Weak governance is a recognized constraint to sustained growth and 
poverty reduction.  The country’s main development challenge, therefore, is to achieve more inclusive 
growth.   In the short- and medium-term, the external environment for the Philippines is likely to 
deteriorate, and the country may face slower growth and renewed fiscal pressures.  Furthermore, the 
elections in 2010, typical of such elections, may slow down decision-making and program 
implementation.  At the same time, an incoming administration can be expected to engage with the 
World Bank Group on the policies and initiatives it gives priority to. 

ii. 
The World Bank Group Strategy.  The updated 2004-10 Medium-Term Philippines 
Development Plan (MTPDP) provides the framework for the Bank Group’s CAS for the Philippines.  
The MTPDP focuses on economic growth and job creation; energy; education and youth opportunity; 
and anticorruption and good governance.  It highlights the need for agriculture sector modernization to 
raise farmers’ incomes and to upgrade rural welfare; supports sustained investments in infrastructure; 
and gives priority to protecting the poor through more employment opportunities, shelter, health 
insurance, microfinance, low-cost medicines, and cash transfers.  Over the CAS period, the World 
Bank Group will contribute to achieving more inclusive growth by supporting the Philippines to (i) 
maintain macroeconomic stability and cope with increased macroeconomic uncertainty through a 
stronger revenue base, improved expenditure efficiency and targeting, and responsive financing; (ii) 
improve 
the 
investment climate through an enabling business environment 
that promotes 
competitiveness, productivity and employment, especially for sectors of particular importance to the 
poor, such as agriculture and fisheries, and developing better models of infrastructure finance and 
management; (iii) increase access to better public services for the poor by deepening the reform 
agendas in key public services sectors and expanding basic service delivery directly to the poor; and 
(iv) reduce vulnerabilities by expanding and rationalizing the country’s social safety net, improving 
disaster risk management, piloting climate change adaptation measures and expanding climate change 
mitigation programs.  In line with the Bank’s country governance and anticorruption framework 
(CGAC), the Bank Group will promote good governance as a cross-cutting theme by supporting more 
capable and accountable government at the national, local, and agency level to strengthen core 
governance systems in public financial management, procurement and decentralization.   

iii. 

The World Bank Group Program.  The Bank Group's program focuses on core results areas 
through engagements at the national, local, and private sector level.  The CAS proposes an IBRD 
lending program in the order of US$700 million-US$1 billion per year, which would reverse the recent 
trend of negative net transfers and could increase IBRD exposure to the Philippines from US$2.7 
billion in FY08 to US$3.9 billion in FY12.  The proposed lending plan is indicative as IBRD’s 
capacity to lend can change over time.  There is higher degree of certainty for the lending plans for the 
earlier years of the CAS period. The IFC investment program is expected to be in the order of 
US$250-300 million per year, while advisory services will be supported by funding of approximately 
US$3 million per year. The Bank Group will support efforts to counter the effects of the global 
economic crisis by financing faster-disbursing poverty alleviation programs such as the conditional 
cash transfers (CCT), the community driven development (CDD) project KALAHI-CIDDS, the 
national program support (NPS) for health and education, additional financing to ongoing operations, 
and repeater projects.  The Bank has committed to support a possible government program for 
increasing revenues and fiscal transparency in calendar year 2009.  Beyond current commitments for a 
development policy loan (DPL) with a possible draw-down option to mitigate the impact of the global 
economic crisis, the Bank will use development policy operations in support of disaster risk

management and in the context of a strong reform program in government financial management.  The 
World Bank Group will also continue to support increasing local government access to finance 
through more diversified financial instruments.  IBRD investment loans and IFC investment and 
advice will support the development of new models of financing and management for critical 
infrastructure. IFC’s response to the global crisis will also include access to four financing facilities.  
The World Bank Group, in collaboration with other development partners, will increasingly emphasize 
knowledge cooperation and formalize a rolling knowledge program with the Government and in 
partnerships with consortia of think tanks and universities.  A central aim of the program for the CAS 
period is to provide input into the MTPDP (2011-15) to be approved after the 2010 elections.   

iv. 
One Bank Group.  The Philippines CAS pilots deeper integration of IBRD and IFC efforts by 
building on lessons of successful World Bank Group integration, such as a shared assessment and a 
shared strategy developed jointly by a mixed IBRD and IFC team.  IBRD and IFC will pursue joint 
programs in three areas: infrastructure, agribusiness, and financial sector.  MIGA will also continue to 
offer its guarantee products, ensuring consistency with the overall Bank Group goals. 

v. 
Implementing the Program.  The World Bank Group will organize its Philippines program 
and its country team along the lines of the four strategic objectives, one cross-cutting theme, and 
eleven core results areas.  For each of these, the Bank Group will organize, budget for, and monitor an 
integrated program of AAA, lending, trust funds and partnership activities.  The Bank will flexibly 
adjust resource allocation among results areas depending on progress and emerging opportunities in 
those areas.  IFC’s resources will be integrated in the results areas that will be jointly pursued.  The 
Philippines Governance Advisory Team (PGAT) will prioritize activities in governance reforms, and 
will advise task teams on governance improvements in specific activities, including through use of 
―Governance Filters‖.  The World Bank Group will strengthen existing partnerships with civil society 
and academe and with other development partners within the overall framework of the Government-
led Philippines Development Forum, which the Bank co-chairs.  In delivering the program, the World 
Bank Group will pay special attention to strengthening the portfolio, improving lending efficiency, 
furthering the knowledge agenda, and leveraging its resources through strategic partnerships and trust 
funds.  The Bank has identified, and agreed with the Government, a set of early ―Readiness Filters‖ 
that will be used to screen projects during the regular programming discussions.     

vi. Managing Risks.  There are considerable risks, both internal and external, that may affect 
the implementation of the Philippines CAS.  Political risks stem from the upcoming national elections 
and associated transitions, which may influence commitment to ongoing and planned programs .  The 
World Bank Group will maintain dialogue with the administration to ensure continuity in its programs 
and help inform the development agenda of the incoming government .  The ongoing global recession 
and financial turmoil is expected to affect negatively the Philippines, particularly through reduced 
remittances, exports, and possibly, lower revenues.  The World Bank Group, together with the IMF 
and other partners, will assist the Government to manage fiscal and financial sector risks and external 
vulnerabilities through policy advice and monitoring of economic and social developments including 
through support for improved statistics.  In case of a sharper-than-expected deterioration in the 
economy, the World Bank Group stands ready to use IFC crisis facilities, and IBRD financing for 
quick disbursing budget support within the broad parameters of the CAS lending range.  The World 
Bank Group support will proceed once there is clarity on agendas and commitments, and projects meet 
the Bank’s processing filters.  Commitment to governance reforms is a major focus of these filters, 
including at the decentralized level.   

Suggested Items for Board Discussion 

(i)   Is the CAS adequately positioned to help the Philippines cope with emerging global 
uncertainties and likely shocks to economic management and prospects? 
(ii)  Is the proposed indicative program and choice of instruments appropriate, considering the 
country circumstances and the Bank's comparative advantages? 
(iii) Is the CAS approach to operationalizing governance sufficiently strong?

April 2, 2009 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The current World Bank Group CAS for the Philippines covers the period up to June 
2009.  It was discussed by the Bank’s Board in May 2005 and was originally planned to cover the 
period FY06-08.  The turn-around in the country’s fiscal position in the two years that followed the 
preparation of the CAS opened a window of opportunity for broader policy reforms for the 
Philippines.  In 2007, the World Bank Group, in agreement with the Philippine Government, decided 
to extend the CAS to June 2009.  The CAS Progress Report prepared in June 2007 reaffirmed the 
relevance of the CAS theme of Supporting Islands of Good Governance in national government 
agencies, local governments, and dynamic sectors in the Philippines that demonstrate how improved 
accountability and service delivery can lead to better economic and social outcomes.  The Progress 
Report also anticipated more Bank lending based on the increased fiscal space and government 
demand for more Bank assistance.   

2. 
Beyond the institutional requirement, the period of political transition lying ahead, the 
rapidly deteriorating external economic environment, and the emerging shifts in the Bank 
Group strategy provide the rationale for moving ahead with a new CAS.  Launching a new CAS 
in the first half of calendar year 2009 will allow the Bank Group one year of implementation before 
the May 2010 elections, and would provide an opportunity to contribute to the new MTPDP 2011-15,1 
the Government’s main guide for development policy.  A CAS Progress Report in FY2011 would 
allow the Bank Group to align priorities with those of the incoming government.  At the request of 
Government, the subsequent Bank Group CAS will be synchronized with the new MTPDP.  Other 
development partners have been closely involved in developing the CAS, and some expressed interest 
in a joint Partnership Strategy beyond 2012. 

3. 
The proposed strategy is grounded in the EAP Regional Strategy and the Bank Group’s 
strategic themes.  Many of the Bank Group’s current strategic priority agendas are relevant to the 
Philippines.  The country’s middle-income country (MIC) status, yet continuing high rates of poverty 
and inequality; struggles with the effects of climate change; challenges to bring peace to areas of 
enduring conflict; and requests for the Bank to bring to bear the best global knowledge all provide 
clear links to the Bank’s strategic priorities and the core areas of EAP’s strategy, such as MIC agenda, 
fragile/conflict states, global public goods, and the knowledge agenda.    

II.    PHILIPPINES CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

Social and Political Context  

4. 
The Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands located in Southeast Asia.  With a 
population of about 89 million in 2007, the Philippines is the world’s 12th most populous country.  The 
Philippines is the fastest urbanizing country in East Asia:  fueled by in-migration and natural 
population growth, the urban population has already passed the 50 percent mark and is expected to rise 
to 75 percent of the country’s population by 2030.  The country is divided into three island groups: 
Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.  Metro Manila, the capital, is the 11 th most populous metropolitan area 
in the world.  A per capita GDP of US$ 1,624 in 2007 ranks the Philippines as a low-middle income 
country.   

5. 
The Philippines has a strong potential for development in terms of natural and human 
resources, but overall development outcomes have fallen short of potential.  The Philippines is 
considered to be one of the most biologically rich and diverse countries in the world, with substantial 
mineral, oil, gas and geothermal potential. Its human resource base is strong, with many leaders in

into the next MTPDP, which will be completed after the 2010 elections.

Government, industries, and academe possessing world-class talents.  The country has a vibrant 
private sector and an active civil society, which are both important partners in development.  Modern 
productive sectors such as electronics manufacturing, business processing operations and 
telecommunications have experienced rapid growth in recent years.  The value of the country’s 
English-speaking work force is reflected in the rapid growth of the business process outsourcing and 
other services in the country, as well as in the international demand for its labor force and the resulting 
high level of overseas employment.2  As of December 2007, around 8.7 million Filipinos, about 10 
percent of the total population, were permanent residents or temporary residents/workers overseas, 
with annual remittances reaching US$14.4 billion, or more than 10 percent of the country’s GDP.  
However, the country has seen a relative decline in its income per capita compared to its neighbors 
since the 1950s, when it was second only to Japan.  Compared to its ASEAN neighbors, the 
Philippines has exhibited higher unemployment rates and greater income inequality.     

6. 
The next Philippine general elections are scheduled to be held on May 10, 2010.  At the 
national level, the presidency, vice-presidency, half the Senate seats, and all House seats are up for 
election.  In addition, all provinces, cities and municipalities (including 41,995 barangays), will also 
hold elections.  Current President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo came to power in 2001 after she, as then 
vice president, replaced then-President Estrada who was forced to leave his post amid popular protests 
and pending impeachment procedures against him on the grounds of alleged corruption.  He was later 
convicted of plunder, and subsequently pardoned.  The current president was elected in 2004 in a 
victory that has been contested by some parties and civil society coalitions.  President Arroyo faced 
two attempted military coups, several impeachment attempts, and repeated widespread popular 
protests against her rule, but she retains strong support in the House of Representatives and among a 
majority of governors and mayors.  Several high-profile corruption cases involving political figures 
remain unresolved.  A debate on possible changes in the constitution for several reasons, including a 
possible second term for a president and a change to a parliamentary system of democracy, is a 
recurrent theme in Philippine politics.  

7. 
Weak incentives embedded in the country’s political institutions may continue to 
hamper reforms.  The fragmented political structure and politicization of the government 
bureaucracy is seen as one of the constraints to promote and implement reforms.  In recent years, a 
number of reforms to strengthen the institutional capacity of the state have been launched, often with 
strong support from civil society.  The work of civil society, both in advocacy and in project 
implementation and monitoring, has contributed to the successful promotion of specific reforms, 
especially in the fields of procurement, textbook delivery, budget transparency, community 
infrastructure, etc.   

8. 
Weak governance has long been recognized as a key constraint to sustained growth and 
poverty reduction in the Philippines.  In the MTPDP 2004-10, the Government diagnosed various 
governance challenges, ranging from the lack of independence, capacity and integrity of government 
institutions, and regulatory capture, to built-in checks and balances that allegedly tended to slow down 
policy-making and policy implementation.  The Plan attributed the limited effectiveness of the 
government bureaucracy to the pernicious influence of vested interests and a system of patronage.  
Recognizing these challenges, the Government embarked on reforms on a number of fronts , including 
anticorruption efforts and bureaucratic reforms.  Similarly, a variety of civil society organizations have 
engaged in advocating and/or supporting governance reforms of various kinds.  At the local level, 
some commentators have observed the prevalence of patronage politics, with consequent implications 
for poor provision of public services.  At the same time, a growing number of local leaders have 

2 Some would argue that the large number of migrant workers is a mixed blessing.  On the one hand, their 
remittances bring in much-needed foreign exchange, but on the other they reflect the incapability of the domestic 
economy to generate sufficient number of jobs, their remittances keep the real exchange rate high, so export 
oriented industries develop more slowly, and their absence from home delays the formation of a domestic middle 
class that in other countries is considered to be instrumental in developing stronger gove rnance.

demonstrated good governance and effective management.  The challenge is how to expand these 
innovations and scale them up to benefit more people across more local governments.   

Recent Economic Developments  

9. 
Philippine economic growth during 2000-08 averaged around 5.1 percent.  Economic 
growth picked up gradually from 2002 to 2007 when it peaked at 7.2 percent—the highest growth in 
three decades—and slowed down to 4.6 percent in 2008 as the twin shocks of the food and fuel crisis 
and global slowdown took their toll on the economy.  Notwithstanding the improved growth 
performance, the Philippines growth has been noticeably below other developing East Asian countries, 
which grew at an average of 8.7 percent during 2000-08. With population growth at more than 2 
percent per annum in the Philippines, growth in per capita income has also been lower relative to most 
of its neighbors. 

10. 
Growth during the period was driven by private consumption and the services sector.  
Demand growth was largely driven by consumer spending, with public sector expenditures more 
recently providing an extra boost.  In recent years, around 70 percent of the growth can be attributed to 
private consumption, supported in part by growing overseas Filipino workers’ remittances.  The 
services sector comprises more than half of GDP and employs more than half of the wo rkforce.  The 
contribution of private investment to GDP growth, at around 5 percent during 2004-08 has been 
relatively weak.  During 2004-06, the Government focused on fiscal consolidation and reforms which 
entailed a cut in public investment expenditures, and the contribution of the public sector to growth 
was around negative 3.6 percent.  Since then the significant progress made in fiscal consolidation, 
together with hefty privatization receipts, permitted the Government to increase spending. 

11. 
In 2008, growth slowed down to 4.6 percent as higher oil and food prices and the onset of 
the financial crisis reduced real incomes and slowed the growth of private consumption, 
investments, and exports.  In the first half of 2008, public sector spending lagged, and contracted in 
real terms.  In May, the Government announced that, in response to the increases in oil and food 
prices, it intended to postpone its balanced budget goal to allow for higher spending on infrastructure, 
social protection, and subsidies to the poor. Public spending, in particular infrastructure spending, 
accelerated in the second half and buoyed overall growth.  The relatively weak demand has resulted in 
slower growth of the services sector. Inflation, which had been falling over the past few years and 
averaged only 2.8 percent in 2007, rose sharply in the first half of 2008 , peaking at 12.5 percent in 
August 2008, but receded almost as quickly to 7 percent in January 2009.  However, the inflation 
faced by the poor, especially the urban poor, is estimated to be about 2 to 3 percentage points higher 
given the high share of food in their consumption basket (up to 70 percent).  Food prices rose sharply 
through 2008—rice prices, in particular, rose by almost 50 percent.3  

12. 
The balance of payments position weakened, following several years of strong 
performance, but remained in surplus.  The higher oil and food prices in 2008 increased the import 
bill, while the global slowdown began to take its toll on exports.  Remittances, however, still remained 
robust in 2008, keeping the current account in moderate surplus.  Direct investment inflows have 
diminished but remain positive.  Portfolio investment was more adversely affected by the financial 
market turmoil and global risk aversion.  Nonetheless, the overall balance of payments remained in 
surplus in 2008 and enabled the country to continue to accumulate international reserves. 

13. 
As in other emerging markets, the Philippines has seen a decline in stock market and 
asset prices, higher spreads on its international bonds, and a depreciation of the currency 
against the US dollar.  Following the strong appreciation of the peso in 2007, the currency 
depreciated by about 15 percent against the US dollar during 2008, despite interventions by the central 

3 It is estimated that the food crisis may have pushed up the poverty incidence by 3.2 percentage points and is 
equivalent to 2.7 million more poor people during the height of the food crisis. Lower inflation since September 
of last year is likely to have reversed some of this increase.

bank.  Stock market prices have nearly halved since the end of 2007, a decline comparable to that in 
other East Asian economies.  Meanwhile, spreads on international treasury bonds issues increased by 
around 500 basis points.  Nevertheless, the Philippines successfully issued a US $1.5 billion 
international bond in January 2009, as the first Asian country to return to the international markets 
after the September 2008 crash, giving off an important signal of confidence in the country and the 
region. 

14. 
So far the impact of the global financial turmoil on domestic financial markets has been 
relatively contained.  The Philippines’ direct exposure to distressed credit products appears to be 
limited.  Overall exposure to structured products is estimated at about 2 percent of banking sector 
assets and a sizable portion have provisions for loss.  A key vulnerability to the turmoil in the global 
financial markets arises from its still relatively high stock of public sector debt.  About one-third of 
Philippines foreign currency denominated debt is held by domestic banks, which makes them 
vulnerable to global re-pricing of risks and interest rate increases.  However, the banks appear to have 
appropriate cushions to weather the shocks—with reported capital adequacy ratios of over 14 percent 
as of the first half of 2008 and declining non-performing loan ratios.  Moreover, recent changes in 
accounting rules cushion the impact on capital of bank losses on their investments. Nevertheless, bank 
profits, though positive, have fallen significantly. 

Macroeconomic Prospects  

15. Macroeconomic prospects for 2009 and 2010 have clearly become less favorable than the 
preceding CAS period.  Overall, the economy is in a stronger position than before to weather the 
uncertainties brought about by the recent turmoil.  The fiscal reforms and current account surpluses of 
the last few years have served to improve investor confidence and boost the level of international 
reserves.  Nevertheless, the Philippines will be affected by the projected slowdown in the global 
economy and growth is likely to slow considerably given the country’s high degree of trade and 
capital openness. Weaker domestic demand due to lower real income, rising unemployment and 
underemployment, slowing remittances, and falling exports of key products such as electronics are 
expected to limit growth severely in 2009 with only a very gradual recovery in sight in 2010 (see the 
base-case projections in Table 1).  At this stage, risks for further slowdown remain real. 

16. 
Over the medium- to long-term, economic growth is projected to recover to around 5 
percent. Its sustainability, however, will depend on further progress in structural reforms . In 
particular, turning around low investment and productivity are essential for sustaining economic 
growth.  Domestic investment as a share of GDP is expected to fall in 2009 due to tighter global credit 
and financing conditions, followed by a gradual recovery in response to future improvemen ts in 
governance and the investment climate. 

17. 
The current account of the Balance of Payments is projected to remain in surplus in the 
near term.  Under the current assumption that the global economy may take up to two years to 
recover, exports are expected to contract significantly before improving while the import bill would 
also contract given the high content of electronics parts and falling commodity prices. Slower exports 
and imports would lead to a lower trade deficit in the near-term followed by an increase in the trade 
deficit as imports pick up again.  Exports of manufactured goods, dominated by highly cyclical 
electronics, remain vulnerable to global demand conditions. While the growth in remittances is 
expected to slow significantly, remittances are nonetheless expected to remain relatively strong, 
because a sizable share of the migrants is employed in sectors (such as health care) that may be less 
vulnerable to cyclical downturns.  This is expected to help keep the current account in surplus. A 
current account deficit might arise in the long-term however, should export competitiveness lag, 
commodity prices increase, and growth in remittances declines further. 

18. 
The global uncertainties and risks will continue to pose threats to net investment inflows.  
Net inflows of direct investments are expected to be minimal this year and next.  Over the medium 
term, attracting significant inflows of FDI will depend on further improvements in the investment 

4

climate. Consistent with global financial volatility, net portfolio investments are expected to be 
minimal as well.  The net outflow in 2008 could be reversed if the interest rate differential rises in the 
coming months and if global prospects become less pessimistic. Overall, though, the combined 
strength of the current, and capital and financial accounts would still contribute to further reserve 
accumulation in the medium-term. 

Table 1: Philippines – Key Macroeconomic Indicators and Projections 
(As percentage of GDP, unless indicated otherwise) 

19. 
In response to the global economic slowdown, the Government has prepared an 
economic resiliency plan to stimulate the economy.  In February 2009, the Government announced 
a stimulus package of Php330 billion of which about Php200 billion is estimated to come from a 15 
percent increase in national government spending and from previously scheduled tax cuts. This is to be 
complemented by about Php100 billion in contributions from government financial institutions, social 
security institutions (SSIs), and private banks to fund additional infrastructure projects. The balance of 
about Php30 billion is to come from the Social Security System in the form of new and temporary 
extra benefits to members.  The Plan indicates the Government’s intention to: (a) front load spending; 
(b) shift resources from slow to fast-moving projects; and (c) implement/upscale quick-disbursing high 
impact projects.  Implementing agencies are expected to spend 60-80 percent of their calendar year 
2009 discretionary budget totalling 1.2 percent of GDP in the first half of 2009.    

20. 
The public sector’s fiscal position is expected to remain manageable , but fiscal risks 
could materialize.  For 2009, the Government projects a deficit of about 2.1 percent of GDP.  Tax

collections this year will be more challenging because of several policy measures already taken4 and 
lower oil prices.  In the absence of new measures, tax revenues as a share of GDP are projected to 
decline well below the ratio achieved in 2008.  Under these circumstances, reforms to improve tax 
administration will be critical for keeping the deficit within sustainable levels.  A further source of risk 
is the gross financing needs of the non-financial public sector, which are large and rising, thereby 
generating significant rollover risk (18.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 19.7 percent of GDP in 2010).5  
With considerably higher and more volatile interest rates in the domestic and international capital 
markets, financing such large amounts could become more challenging.  

21. 
The public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue to fall over the medium-
term, in spite of the global financial turmoil.  Non-financial public sector debt fell from over 100 
percent of GDP in 2003 to about 62 percent of GDP in 2008.  This ratio is projected to fall further over 
the coming years, albeit at a markedly slower pace. While the projected pace of decline is sensitive to 
various macroeconomic parameters, especially GDP growth and the exchange rate, the overall trend of 
a declining debt burden is broadly robust to various scenarios. 

Poverty Profile and Trends  

22. 
The Philippines has made significant progress in the fight against poverty over the last 
two decades. The share of the population living below the national poverty line, which almost reached 
50 percent in the mid-1980s, was brought down to less than a third in recent years (Figure 1)6.  Poverty 
measured using the international benchmark shows a similar trend.  The proportion of the population 
living below US$1.25-a-day declined from 34.9 percent in 1985 to 22.6 percent in 2006, or a reduction 
of about 2 percent per year over the two decades.  While significant, these gains are lower than those 
recorded in some neighboring countries, particularly Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and China.  
Moreover, the absolute number of the poor based on the $1.25/day poverty line increased from 18.5 
million poor people in 1985 to 19.7 million in 2006.

23. 
Income poverty hardly fell in recent years.  The latest estimates show that between 2003 
and 2006 income poverty as measured against the country’s own poverty line increased from 30 
percent to 32.9 percent, back to its level in 2000.  The incidence of poverty based on alternative 
measures of the poverty line also show similar increases during that period, consistent with the official 
statistics.  Between 2003 and 2006, the US$1.25-a-day poverty increased from 22 percent to 22.6 
percent7, and consumption-based poverty estimates increased from 26 percent to 28.1 percent8.  
Furthermore, self-rated hunger indicators showed steady increase since 1998 and rose to an all-time 
high of 19 percent by the end of 20069.   

24. 
Non-income dimensions of poverty and welfare are lagging behind, specifically in health 
and education.  The latest statistics show that the Philippines has made good progress in reducing 
child mortality, combating tuberculosis and other diseases, improving access to water and sanitation, 
and protecting the environment, but has done poorly in achieving universal primary education and 
maternal health (see further analysis of  progress in achieving MDGs in Annex 1). 

25. 
Regional poverty rates vary significantly.  Although the national poverty rate increased 
between 2003 and 2006, official estimates of poverty declined in four of the country’s 17 
administrative regions.  Poverty declined in three regions in Mindanao: Zamboanga from 49.2 percent 
to 45.3 percent, Caraga from 54 percent to 52.6 percent, and Northern Mindanao from 44 percent to 
43.1 percent.  Poverty in Western Visayas also declined from 39.2 percent to 38.6 percent.  In contrast, 
poverty headcounts in the other 13 regions increased in 2006 compared to 2003.  In particular, poverty 
in conflict-affected Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) swelled by almost 10 
percentage points (to 61.8 percent).   

26. 
Poverty remains predominantly a rural phenomenon in the Philippines, but urban 
poverty is on the rise.  In 2006, about three-quarters of the poor resided in rural areas (Table 2).  
Estimates also show that rural poverty increased (although marginally) between 2003 and 2006 and 
that poverty among agricultural households is about three times higher than poverty in other sectors.   
While rural poverty remains more than double that of urban poverty, the share of urban poor to total 
poverty has been increasing since 2000 due to rapid urbanization and inequitable income distribution.  
Between 2003 and 2006, the share of the poor population living in the urban areas increased from 23.2 
percent to 28.8 percent.  With rural-urban migration and rapid population growth, this trend can be 
expected to continue over time unless rapid urbanization is accompanied by better income distribution.

27. 
High levels of inequality partly explain why growth translated into limited poverty 
reduction.  The country’s Gini coefficient remains high relative to its neighbors in the region (45.8 
percent in 2006), and large variation in economic opportunities persist at the sub-national level.  
Geographically, the National Capital Region and two adjacent regions, which account for more than 
half of GDP, have above average per capita income and have seen the fastest decline in poverty 
headcount.  In contrast, per capita incomes in the poorest regions (ARMM and Caraga), are only 50-60 
percent of the national average.  Estimates suggest that the Philippine's growth elasticity of poverty is 
greater than unity, but has been declining in recent years (Table 3)10.  Between 1985 and 2000 when 
growth averaged 3 percent per year, poverty declined by about 2.2 percent annually.  In the period 
2000-2006, when the country posted about 5 percent growth per year, the pace of poverty reduction 
dropped to 0.1 percent per year.

High population growth may have slowed poverty reduction efforts over the past two 
decades.  While the trend in poverty incidence has generally been downward over the years, the gains 
in poverty reduction may have been affected by the country’s high population growth, which averaged 
about 2.2 percent, compared to less than 2 percent in neighboring countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, 
and Thailand.  Rapid population growth puts high demand on education and health services, and on 
the economy’s capacity to generate jobs.   Recent growth has generated more jobs, but not enough to 
absorb the increase in the working-age population.  Consequently, even though the share of population 
living in poverty declined from nearly half of the population in 1985 to only one-third in 2006, the 
absolute number of poor increased from 26.2 million to 27.6 million (Figure 2).

29. 
It is estimated that 45 percent of Filipinos are vulnerable to poverty11, and that half of 
poor households became poor because of an income shock12.  For example, the sharp increase in 
food prices between July 2007 and July 2008 is estimated to have increased poverty incidence by 3.6 
percentage points, an additional 3 million people.  Household spending patterns shed light on their 
degree of vulnerability to shocks.  An average household spends 41 percent on food, making them 
highly susceptible to falling into poverty with sudden increases in food prices, and only 2.9 percent on 
health and 4.4 percent on education of its total expenditures.  The poor, meanwh ile, spend even more 
on food (60 percent) and less on health (1.4 percent) and education (1.7 percent) making them more at-
risk to future shocks and less equipped to exit poverty.  Some of the factors that drove the increase in 
poverty in recent years are further discussed in Annex 1.  

Philippines Development Challenges and Opportunities 

30. 
The proposed new CAS for the Philippines will be addressing many of the same 
development challenges that the country has been struggling with for decades.  The country’s 
main achievement over the past years has undoubtedly been the hard-fought improvements in the 
country’s fiscal position and resulting macroeconomic stability and higher growth rates.  Yet, poverty 
is proving to be relatively insensitive to growth in the Philippines and has even drifted upwards in 
times when the highest economic growth in three decades was recorded.  Indeed, in absolute numbers, 
the Philippines now has more people in poverty than three decades ago.  While public investments 
have started to increase again, supported by growing fiscal space, private investment continues to be 
lackluster in an investment climate that many consider as weaker than that of most of its neighbors. 
And while rising budget allocations to and recent progress in reforms in the social sectors promise 
better services, for now the Philippines is at risk of missing its targets on basic education and maternal 
health.  Many observers in the Philippines see weak governance as an underlying cause in all of these 
development challenges, even though some notable progress has been made in this area—progress, 
which was on occasion overshadowed by headline grabbing corruption scandals.   

31. 
Ensuring sustainable growth in the Philippines will require addressing the key 
challenges to progress on critical structural reforms.  Recent improvements in macroeconomic 
management, especially fiscal consolidation, will need to be put on a sustainable and permanent 
footing by improving tax administration and tax policy on the revenue side, as well as by improving 
expenditure management and the management of fiscal risks.  Underinvestment in infrastructure, and 
the poor quality and maintenance of services, transport in particular, limit overall competitiveness, 
increase the cost of doing business, and adversely affect trade-related transactions.  Private sector 
development is further impeded by a constrictive policy and regulatory environment, particularly in 
areas such as rice trade where policies favor the public sector; inter-island shipping and port services; 
land administration and management; and access to credit.  Strengthening the investment climate , 
improving the policy and regulatory framework, and creating a more competitive financial sector will 
provide opportunities for enhancing productivity and ensuring sustainable and broad-based longer-
term growth.  Given the decentralized nature of the country, much of the reforms (including revisions 
of local fiscal and revenue authority, and the Local Government Code) and improvements will need to 
be at the local government level, in particular, in the large and expanding urban areas.  

32. While considerable progress has been made in human development outcomes, achieving 
some of the key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a major challenge.  The 
country is on track to halving poverty by 2015 (the proportion of the population living below the 
national poverty line is down to a third), and has made good progress on reaching the MDGs on 
nutrition, gender equality, reducing infant and child mortality (infant mortality fell to 23 per thousand 
live births in 2006 from 57 in 1990; under-five mortality in 2006 fell to 31 per thousand live births 
from 80 in 1990), water supply and sanitation, and combating AIDS and other diseases.  However, the

net enrolment rate (NER) for elementary education has been falling, and that for secondary education 
is stagnating at a low 58-60 percent, whereas completion rates at both levels were declining until 2006.  
Despite a decline from 209 per hundred thousand live births in 1990 to 162 in 2006, maternal 
mortality remains high.  Achieving the MDGs for primary education and maternal mortality remain 
major challenges and are increasingly unlikely to be met.  The incidence of malnutrition is also an 
issue.  There are significant opportunities to improve the efficiency of increasing budgets in the social 
sectors, as well as further raising allocations as efficiency and fiscal space improve.   

33. 
There are significant inequalities in the access to basic infrastructure and social services 
by regions and income groups.  Income disparities at the sub-national level translate into 
significantly lower access to vital infrastructure services such as electricity, water supply, paved roads, 
and telephone service.  Less prosperous regions, mostly in Mindanao, have much lower levels of 
access.  Gaps are also largest in urban areas where many poor households often lack access to services 
due to their informal status.  There are also persistent gaps in educational and health outcomes, as well 
as access to good quality schools and health services and inputs, between poor and non-poor areas, and 
between poor and non-poor families.  

34. 
A key feature of the recent Philippines’s economic story has been the weak response of 
poverty reduction to income growth and persistent vulnerability.  Official estimates show that 
nearly half of the population is vulnerable to falling into poverty as a result of shocks, including rising 
prices.  Analyzing and understanding the causes and nature of poverty are critical to responding to the 
challenge of how the poor can better benefit from growth.  Factors for the disconnect between growth 
and poverty reduction include the impact of cumulative inflation on real incomes of households; the 
compression of public expenditures, including both infrastructure and social spending, in the face of 
unsustainable budget deficits in the early years of this decade; the quality of growth which accrued 
largely to the corporate sector compared to households; and, insufficient job creation for low skilled 
labor with growth favoring the services sector.  Poverty is also driven through the nexus with the 
environment and climate change, as well as with natural disasters.  A poorly coordinated and 
inaccurate social protection system further reduces the effectiveness of poverty targeting programs.  

35. 
The overarching and cross-cutting challenge of weak governance remains a key 
constraint to sustainable growth and poverty reduction.  The Government recognizes this 
challenge and there has been considerable progress in strengthening the overall framework for good 
governance.  Governance reforms have encompassed anticorruption drives, bureaucratic reforms, 
strengthening of public procurement and fiduciary processes, promotion of local government 
oversight, and the engagement of strong civil society groups, communities, and lawmakers in 
providing checks and balances.  For example, following up on the findings of an INT investigation of 
the first phase of the National Roads Improvement Program, the Government and the World Bank 
designed for the second phase of the project a battery of stringent anti -corruption measures and 
governance mechanisms, such as the use of independent procurement evaluation, tighter procurement 
controls, building the agency’s capacity for internal audit, and independent monitoring by a civil 
society group. An example of the Government’s recent administrative reform efforts is Oplan 
Kandado (Operations Padlock) launched in January 2009 and aiming to strictly enforce administrative 
sanctions for noncompliance by taxpayers.  However, governance challenges continue to overshadow 
these achievements. Key challenges include the need to further strengthen public institutions and make 
them more accountable and transparent; intensify the demand and political impetus for reforms; and, 
consolidate and expand the engagement of the vibrant civil society.  See further analysis in Annex 2. 

36. 
Finally, the conflict-affected areas in Mindanao pose a particular challenge.  The 
decades-long intermittent conflict between government forces and separatist groups have resulted in 
loss of life and displacement of people, destroyed infrastructure, slowed development, below-average 
human development, and stagnating economic outcomes far below potential in the affected regions.  
This potential is somewhat evident in the island’s growth centers where there is relatively better 
economic performance.  The World Bank Group, along with many other development partners, has 

10 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

been supporting development activities in Mindanao, but the various short-term initiatives need to be 
better coordinated to result in improved outcomes and more sustainable longer-term development. 

37. 
Addressing the country’s development challenges is likely to become more demanding in 
the coming CAS period.  As for most developing countries, the external environment for the 
Philippines is deteriorating rapidly and is likely to be less benevolent in the coming years.  Although 
better prepared than in the past, and better prepared than some other middle income countries, the 
Philippines is likely to face slower growth in the years ahead, and renewed fiscal pressures are already 
emerging.  The country needs to manage these additional pressures in times of political change.  The 
elections scheduled for May 2010 offer risks as well as opportunities: on the one hand, elections in the 
Philippines traditionally slow down decision making, reform initiatives and program implementation.   
On the other hand, though, the upcoming elections offer an opportunity for a renewed political 
mandate for the incoming administration, the potential for new policy directions, and new coalitions 
for needed reforms.  The baseline expectation therefore is that the CAS will operate in a rapidly 
changing and often challenging political environment. 

Updated 2004-10 Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan (MTPDP) 

38. With a fresh mandate in 2004, the Government outlined the country’s MTPDP for the 
period 2004-2010 with a macroeconomic framework designed to maintain economic stability.  
Starting in 2005, the Government implemented crucial reforms to improve tax collection, increase 
revenues and prudently manage expenditures.  Fiscal reforms resulted in stabilized public finances, 
large prepayments and lesser dependence on external borrowings. Consequently, the budget deficit 
was contained, in turn resulting in lower interest rates.   Record levels of overseas remittances coupled 
with increasing export earnings led to an improvement in the country's credit outlook.  These further 
attracted foreign investments and boosted the peso's strength.  Hence, an economy once struggling to 
recover after the Asian crisis began to show a turn-around in 2007.  However, the momentum receded 
by mid-2008 in the wake of global shocks: soaring food and fuel prices, and a downturn in the U.S. 
economy. 

39. 
The MTPDP was updated in 2008 to review past performance , attend to remaining 
commitments in the Plan, and reformulate policies to address the new challenges .  The update 
was undergoing final review during the CAS preparation time.  The updated MTPDP focuses on the 
areas of: economic growth and job creation; energy; education and youth opportunity; and 
anticorruption and good governance.  It highlights the need for the agriculture sector to become more 
competitive in view of the liberalized global economy and stresses the need to decentralize 
development by decongesting Metro Manila through the establishment of new centers of government, 
business and housing in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.  It aims for the nation to become more self-
reliant in its energy mix, becoming a world leader in renewable energy. It puts new emphasis on 
science, technology, and innovation, and speaks of boosting the outsourcing industry and establishing 
regional ICT centers.  The MTPDP supports sustained investments in infrastructure, pursuing an urban 
rail-based mass transport system, and linking the islands via more Roll-on-Roll-off ports. It highlights 
actions to manage inflation, as well as to address the relatively high rates of unemployment and 
underemployment.  The Plan gives priority to protecting the poor through more shelter, health 
insurance, microfinance, low-cost medicines, and cash transfers. 

40. 
The overall goals of the MTPDP provide the country framework for the Bank’s CAS for 
the Philippines.  The CAS will be broadly aligned with the themes under the updated MTPDP, and 
will serve as early input to the next MTPDP that is to be approved by the incoming government after 
the 2010 elections.  At the Government’s request, the Bank will provide input in the preparation of the 
new plan that is expected to start in the coming year.  Given the possibility of a shifting focus with the 
change of administration after elections, the alignment will be measured in terms of adequate 
responsiveness to changing client requests, within a selective framework that focuses on areas in 
which the Bank can best serve the country’s development and poverty reduction goals.

III.   BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR THE PHILIPPINES 

A. 

LESSONS LEARNED FROM FY06-09 CAS AND STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK 

Lessons from FY06-09 CAS Completion Report 

41. 
The FY06-09 CAS Completion Report (Annex 3) presents an assessment of the strategy 
that aimed to achieve fiscal stability, generate economic growth, ensure social inclusion and 
improve governance.  The following lessons have been learned that have implications for the design 
and implementation of next FY10-12 CAS: 

 The overall strategic direction of the CAS was sound.  Sound fiscal management and 
improved governance will continue to be critical for ensuring sustained economic growth and 
poverty reduction.  The next CAS will need to ensure that the gains made in revenue 
generation, public expenditure management, and procurement are sustained while pursuing 
further improvements in governance.  Continued focus on implementing the project portfolio 
will be critical to success during the next CAS. Going forward, the Bank will need to 
understand better the factors explaining the relationship between the country’s economic 
performance and lack of poverty reduction, and ensure that Bank-supported operations 
emphasize the needs of the poor. 

 Continued engagement is a critical element for success, but at the same time the Bank 
needs to develop criteria for strategic and selective engagement.   The Bank has a long 
history in the Philippines and has been able to develop relationships and trust with many 
government agencies, which has enhanced the Bank’s effectiveness. The Bank would need to 
build on these relationships with counterparts in pursuing results during the next CAS.  
However, the Bank, jointly with the Government, would need to be strategically selective and 
develop criteria to determine when the Bank should disengage given the extent of current 
engagements and Bank resource constraints.   

 Monitoring (and evaluation) of AAA needs to be strengthened.  Knowledge transfers are 
an important part of the Bank engagement with the Philippines.  But the Philippine program 
has not been adequately monitored and the possible impact of its AAA program has not been 
assessed.   There also needs to be a stronger link between the Bank’s AAA program with that 
of the priority analytical study needs of the Government. 

 The CAS results framework needs to be strengthened.  The FY06-08 CAS results 
framework has not proven useful in monitoring, managing and evaluating the CAS.  The Bank 
can make the results framework into an effective CAS management, monitoring and 
evaluation tool by clearly stating the expected CAS outcomes, including specific, measurable, 
achievable, relevant and time-bound indicators to allow for better monitoring, and making 
explicit the link between expected CAS outcomes and Bank instruments.  Linking CAS 
monitoring and operational (including AAA) monitoring would facilitate data collection.  
Closer strategic monitoring of progress towards CAS strategic objectives should facilitate 
decisions on engagement.  These lessons have been reflected in the new results framework. 

Findings from Recent IEG Evaluations 

42. 
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared a country brief for the Philippines 
in April 2008.  IEG’s country brief provides the following highlights:  

 The main challenges identified in the Philippines have been the Bank’s late response to 
clients’ demands for more programmatic lending and the lack of synchronization with the 

12 

 
 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

budget process. Going forward, government officials were optimistic that the new 
programmatic loans which started in 2006 would allow for appropriate flexibility.  

 Clients appreciated the Bank’s high-quality knowledge work. At the same time, they lamented 
the lack of applicability and appreciation of country dynamics.  

 At the project level, a weak regulatory framework for Local Government Unit (LGU) finance 
and private sector participation has hampered participation of LGUs in Bank projects.  

43. 
Overall Value of the Bank.  More specifically, IEGs’ 2006 Development Results in Middle-
Income Countries (MIC) report indicated that Philippine partners value the Bank for its longstanding 
relationship and consider the Bank to have an intimate knowledge of the country. Appreciation was 
universally high for the Philippine Development Forum and the Bank’s role in it; this relationship 
helped assure the relevance of the Bank’s strategy. 

44. 
Operational Challenge.  One of the main challenges identified in the MIC report was the 
Bank’s late response to clients’ demands for more programmatic lending.  The new National Program 
Support operations, which were started in 2006, were designed to respond to these challenges and 
provide the needed flexibility. This type of loan instrument continues to be relevant under the new 
CAS given continuous feedback on the preference of the Government for programmatic lending. 

45. 
Knowledge Agenda.  IEG’s evaluation highlighted the clients’ appreciation for the Bank’s 
high-quality knowledge work, particularly its power to bring its international experiences in its 
advisory work.  Bank reports were considered to be of good quality and holding weight in political 
debates. Still, clients noted that the Bank’s knowledge work sometimes lacked applicability to the 
country situation, and insufficiently account for country dynamics. Bank documents were sometimes 
seen as too ambitious, identifying issues of which the Government was already aware, and 
timelines/procedures did not take into consideration the culture and traditions of the Philippines.  The 
new CAS emphasizes a flexible knowledge agenda consistent with the main strategic objectives. 

46. 
IFC-IBRD Collaboration. From the IEG evaluation, it was concluded that some clients had 
not observed much coordination between the Bank and IFC, and government officials expressed that 
better coordination would be welcome and could lead to enhanced public-private partnerships, 
particularly in the infrastructure and power sectors.  This particular feedback has been one of the 
driving forces for the stronger IFC-IBRD strategy component of the new CAS. 

World Bank FY09 Client Survey and Multistakeholder Consultations 

47. 
The FY10-12 World Bank Group CAS was prepared by drawing on various dialogue 
and feedback mechanisms.  Instruments that gave qualitative and quantitative information were also 
part of the preparation process.  In addition to the CAS Completion Report (Annex 3), these included a 
World Bank Client Survey and a series of formal and informal meetings with participants from 
different parts of the country, with national and local government officials from oversight and 
implementing agencies, and with other development partners.  (See Annex 4 for more details on the 
multistakeholder consultations, the World Bank FY09 Client Survey for the Philippines, and the 
overall CAS preparation process.) 

48. 
The FY09 World Bank Client Survey was conducted in the Philippines in August 2008 
with a total of 337 respondents. The results of the survey indicate that the Bank’s work in the 
country was valued, and stakeholders were eager for the Bank to be involved in the most critical 
development challenges that the country faces. In terms of development issues, corruption and poverty 
were considered the key development priorities in the Philippines.  In terms of value of the World 
Bank to the clients, the results indicated that the Bank was mostly valued for its lending to finance 
development projects. The survey indicated that the Bank’s knowledge was less valued in the 
Philippines than in many other countries surveyed. Similar to the IEG findings, the client survey 

13 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

indicated that the Bank’s greatest weakness was perceived to be its disregard of political realities on 
the ground and its bureaucratic way of conducting business that is not attuned to country conditions.   

49. 
A series of meetings were held with top government officials and leaders from civil 
society organizations (CSOs) and private sector, as well as with other development partners, 
both bilateral and multilateral agencies.  Eight CAS Working Groups, (growth/fiscal, investment 
climate, poverty/social, governance/anticorruption, environment/climate change/disaster 
risk 
management, food policy issues/rural development, decentralization, and political issues) also met 
with partners from government, civil society, and bilateral and multilateral development agencies.  
The key messages and implications for Bank Group assistance gathered from the consultation 
workshops are summarized in Box 1.  As the goal was to listen to a wide spectrum of voices, these 
details show some divergent views and opinions of various groups across the country.  A detailed 
feedback report was sent to all the participants and was posted on the Bank’s Philippines website to 
inform the public about the messages and recommendations. 

Box 1:  Key Messages from Multistakeholder Consultations 

 Poverty.  The main causes for increasing poverty are: (a) bad governance; (b) the poor quality of 
education, particularly in rural areas; and (c) lack of livelihood and employment opportunities. 
 Governance.  The inadequate performance of public institutions is caused by: (a) the prevalence of 
corruption at all levels; (b) weak citizen participation in governance; (c) lack of professionalism and 
inadequate leadership and management capacities of political leaders; and (d) a bloated and inefficient 
bureaucracy that results in lack of communication and coordination and hampers the delivery of public 
services. 
 Suggestions for Bank Group involvement.  Ideas for priority programs for the new CAS included: (a) 
basic education, health and other social services at the grassroots level; (b) food sufficiency and 
security programs that will improve productivity and agricultural market development; (c) capacity-
building to improve local governance, including programs that improve transparency and accountability 
in government agencies (e.g., strengthening of civil society participation in oversight roles, prosecution 
of erring public officials, etc.); (d) electoral reforms to strengthen democratic processes (e.g., voters’ 
education); and (e) social protection.  
Issues that the Bank Group should avoid.  Conversely, the World Bank should avoid programs 
related to: (a) political intervention, including engagement in partisan politics, giving in to political 
pressure or direct involvement in conflict resolution and the war against terrorism; (b) mining projects 
that are not supported by communities, and (c) human rights violations, including support for 
enterprises or industries that encourage human trafficking, sex slavery and those that employ minors.   
 Divergent views on Bank Group involvement.  A number of issues surfaced where consultation 
participants had divergent views on World Bank involvement. While the majority felt that the World 
Bank should avoid these issues, some participants felt that there were opportunities for Bank 
involvement in the following:  (a) policy making on procurement, taxes and tariffs; (b) family planning 
programs; (c) cash grants and subsidies; and (d) project identification and prioritization.

PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

World Bank Group Assistance Strategy Overview 

50. 
Based on the context presented above, the forthcoming CAS proposes to shift emphasis 
within the existing overarching goal rather than introduce a radically different approach from 
past CASs.  The following key strategic shifts form the basis of the new CAS: 
i. 
Intensifying the focus on poverty reduction in light of its importance for the Philippines 
development agenda, the lack of progress on this front despite higher growth, and the 
vulnerability of the poor to the impact of the global slowdown. 
ii. Further operationalizing governance in all Bank-supported activities.  Improving 
governance is considered critical for better development outcomes in the Philippines, and 
is an area in which government and non-government groups alike consider the Bank’s 
experience and contribution of value to the Philippines.   

14 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

iii. Including emerging global challenges with particular relevance for the Philippines e.g., 
mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change, and reducing the risks associated with 
increasing intensity and frequency of natural disasters to which the country is already 
prone. 
iv. Emphasizing the knowledge agenda, because the Philippines as a middle income country 
is facing increasingly sophisticated development policy challenges, and because the Bank 
has in the past shown to be effective in producing relevant knowledge and in convening 
the development community to achieve results. 

51. 
Over the CAS period, the World Bank Group will contribute to achieving more inclusive 
growth in the Philippines.  It will do so by supporting the Government to: (i) maintain macro-
economic stability and cope with increased macroeconomic uncertainty through a stronger revenue 
base, improved expenditure efficiency and targeting, and responsive financing; (ii) improve the 
investment climate through an enabling business environment that promotes competitiveness, 
productivity and employment, especially for sectors of particular importance to the poor, such as 
agriculture and fisheries, and developing better models of infrastructure finance and management at 
national and local level to reduce transaction costs for the poor ; (iii) increase access to better public 
services for the poor by deepening the reform agendas in key public services sectors, and expanding 
basic service delivery directly to the poor; and (iv) reduce vulnerabilities by expanding and 
rationalizing the country’s social safety net, improving disaster risk management, piloting climate 
change adaptation measures and expanding climate change mitigation programs in key sectors.   

52. 
The World Bank Group will promote good governance by supporting more capable and 
accountable government.  To achieve this goal, the Bank Group will pursue an engagement strategy 
at the national, local, and agency level.  It will support cross-cutting as well as agency-specific reforms 
to strengthen core governance systems in public financial management, procurement, and 
decentralization.  It will make use of certain types of poverty-reduction interventions, such as 
community-driven development (CDD) and conditional cash transfers (CCT) to increase the demand 
for better governance and better services.  The Bank Group will also facilitate empowerment of the 
Philippines’ civil society and academe by promoting more transparency in Bank-supported operations 
as well as in public finance and public procurement in general.  The Bank will use the Philippines’ 
own governance systems to assess the capabilities of prospective implementing agencies of Bank-
financed projects, and will carefully consider new engagements with agencies that cannot meet the 
country’s own standards of good governance. 

53. 
The World Bank Group's program focuses on core results areas through engagements at 
the national, local, and private sector level.  IBRD will aim for a lending program in the order of 
US$700 million-US$1 billion per year, with lower commitments expected for FY10 due to the May 
2010 elections.  The proposed lending would reverse the recent trend of negative net transfers and 
could increase IBRD exposure to the Philippines from US$2.7 billion in FY08 to US$3.9 billion in 
FY12.  The proposed lending plan is indicative as IBRD’s capacity to lend can change over time.  
There is higher degree of certainty for the lending plans for the earlier years of the CAS period.  
During the CAS period, IFC will support recognized and replicable successes in the country.  Success 
will be measured by the development impact in key selected sectors, jointly or in coordination with 
IBRD, wherein IFC services would maximize and catalyze impact.  In recognition that impact from 
IFC's engagement is significantly greater when investment and advisory services are properly aligned, 
the IFC strategy clearly incorporates both.  The IFC investment program is expected to be in the order 
of US$250-300 million per year, while advisory services will be supported by funding of 
approximately US$3 million per year.  MIGA will continue to offer its guarantee products.  Annexes 5 
and 6 present the CAS results framework and the Bank Group program by results areas. 

54. 
The World Bank Group will support efforts to counter the effects of the global economic 
crisis (see Box 2).

Box 2. World Bank Group’s Response to the Global Economic Crisis  

In terms of financial assistance to the Philippines for addressing the impact of the financial turmoil and the 
global crisis, the Government has asked the Bank to focus on faster-disbursing assistance in a variety of areas 
so as to contribute to key programs for alleviating the impact as well as general budget financing.  The World 
Bank Group support will proceed once there is clarity on agendas and commitments, and projects meet the 
Bank’s processing filters.  Commitment to governance reforms is a maj or focus of these filters, including at 
the decentralized level.  

 

IBRD expanded support in the short-term includes: 
- Scaled up support for the Government’s new Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program.  The 
planned loan amount in support of the CCT program was increased from US$50 million to US$405 
million.  The objective is to strengthen the effectiveness of the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development (DSWD) as a social protection agency to efficiently implement the CCT and to 
improve the national household targeting system for social protection programs in selected areas.   
- Accelerated disbursement under the National Program Support loans for Health and 
Education.  Through accelerated disbursement and additional financing in these sector-wide 
operations, the Bank could contribute more financing. 
- Additional financing for the community-driven development project KALAHI-CIDSS.  This 
program that helps build community infrastructure and income generating investments is an ongoing 
program for which the Government has requested additional financing. 
- Continued program of development policy loans (DPL).  The 2006 DPL series focused on 
increased fiscal revenues and fiscal transparency.  A DPL2 planned for 2007 was postponed because 
the Government fell short of its objectives, and the DPL series closed in December 2008.  The 
program could be continued with a $250 million new DPL for calendar year 2009, with a possible 
additional US$250 million as a deferred drawdown option, supporting the objectives of fiscal 
revenues and transparency, complemented by measures to improve the Philippines’ response to the 
crisis. 

 

IFC Crisis Response Initiatives.   IFC will aim to address increased risk and liquidity constraints 
through a series of instruments devised to help countries and firms respond to the global economic crisis.  
These instruments include Advisory Services to help strengthen insolvency regimes, improve corporate 
governance and strengthen risk management capacity in banks, and four recently approved or expanded 
financing facilities: 
- Bank Recapitalization Fund – global equity fund to recapitalize distressed banks 
- Expanded Trade Finance Program – existing IFC program that guarantees the trade -related 
payment obligations of approved financial institutions in emerging markets 
- Infrastructure Crisis Facility – to bridge the gap in available financing for viable, privately funded 
infrastructure projects facing financial distress 
- Global Microfinance Funding Initiative – to assist the microfinance sector in terms of filling 
funding gaps despite sound fundamental and continued strong performance. 
 MIGA Response.  MIGA’s ongoing commitment to the country will seek to reassure private sector 
investors through its political risk insurance product.  MIGA’s standard products address risks of Transfer 
Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract and War and Civil Disturbance.  In addition, the Small 
Investment Program (SIP) offers a more streamlined product for smaller scale investments in the country. 

55. 
The global uncertainties as well as the Philippines’ political environment and transition 
require the Bank Group to be flexible, and adapt to changing circumstances.  The Bank Group 
will be engaged in a relatively broad set of result areas, but the intensity of engagement will vary 
depending on the progress made and emerging opportunities for reforms, as well as on the 
opportunities that the Bank’s global initiatives offer.  Beyond current commitments for a DPL with a 
possible draw-down option to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis, the Bank will use 
development policy operations in support of disaster risk management and in the context of a strong 
reform program in government financial management .  The Bank Group will also continue to support 
increasing local government access to finance through more diversified financial instruments.  IBRD 
investment loans and guarantees and IFC investment and advice would support the development of 
new models of financing and management for critical infrastructure, including good practice Public 

16

April 2, 2009 

Private Partnerships (PPPs).  The World Bank Group will adapt its financing share of those PPPs in 
light of availability of private financing.  MIGA guarantees may also offer reassurance for foreign 
investors, especially those concerned about turbulence in foreign exchange markets.  To increase 
flexibility in a time of global uncertainties, the Bank Group will aim to reduce preparation times and 
increase the responsiveness in the lending program by better aligning it with the Government’s 
evolving priorities through more frequent lending program discussions and review, and by scaling up 
successful operations through additional financing and repeater loans, and by using national program 
support loans as platforms for innovation and reforms.  A CAS Progress Report in FY11 will align the 
Bank Group’s program with that of the incoming government.   

56. 
The Bank Group, in partnership with other development partners, will increasingly 
emphasize knowledge cooperation and formalize a rolling AAA program with the Government.  
A central aim of the AAA program for the CAS period is to provide inputs into the 2011-16 MTPDP.  
Implementation of the knowledge agenda will increasingly be done in cooperation with local institutes 
through programmatic partnerships in key results areas.   

World Bank Group Program Integration 

57. 
A number of the development challenges facing the Philippines call for solutions that 
involve both “public goods” such as improved policies, institutions and incentives, as well as 
private sector investments.  The business case for IBRD-IFC-MIGA collaboration results from the 
possibility of more effective use of financial and technical resources for the delivery of those public 
and private goods, and potential innovation through a public/private funding mix.  The Philippines 
CAS pilots deeper integration of IBRD and IFC efforts by building on lessons of successful World 
Bank Group integration, including a shared assessment and strategy developed jointly by mixed IBRD 
and IFC teams (see Box 3).     

Box 3.  One Bank Group: IFC-IBRD Integrated Programs 

The IFC-IBRD CAS team considered joint programs in several key sectors seen as having significant potential 
development impact, where a combination of public and private sector actions are needed to realize the 
potential.  The team agreed to pursue joint programs in three sectors:  

 

 

 

In infrastructure, new ideas in subsectors of joint interest will complement the significant number of 
ongoing operations.  A key priority is the support for the implementation of the cur rent reforms in the 
electricity sector.  IBRD and IFC have also defined specific roles and synergies to more effectively help 
catalyze private participation in household water service delivery in specific localities, and in the transport 
sector through the preparation of well-developed transactions and in defining enabling policies and better 
institutional processes and arrangements for procuring and implementing PPPs within the current legal 
framework.  The overall program has the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the risk 
allocation and the division of labor between the public and private sectors. 
In agribusiness, the challenges of low productivity and poor integration into global supply chains limit 
job creation and income growth for farmers.  These challenges will be addressed through a joint IFC-
IBRD program designed to increase rural and farmer access to credit through expansion of a menu of 
innovative financing instruments (e.g., partial credit guarantee, index-based weather insurance, etc.), and 
improve market access in domestic and international markets for agriculture and agribusiness through 
better quality assurance, more efficient logistics and supply chains for agribusiness development.  This 
planned collaboration will build initially on IFC's current program in the banana sector and expand 
gradually to other export crops, as well as in IBRD’s operational experience in supporting the 
Government’s rural finance agenda and agricultural diversification efforts.  
In the financial sector, the program will support increased access to financial services; banking sector 
competitiveness and reach; and financial literacy.  The joint framework includes work on financial sector 
infrastructure including credit, payment and collateral systems , leveling the playing field between 
government and private financial institutions, and promoting consolidation in the sector.   In addition to 
addressing the cross-cutting issues, specific operations will provide access to finance for LGU initiatives, 
microenterprises, farmers, fishers, SMEs, housing and energy efficiency projects.     

17

April 2, 2009 

58. MIGA will also continue to offer its guarantee products .  It will make sure it is operating 
consistently with the overall Bank Group goals, and coordinating with IBRD and IFC where this is 
necessary or appropriate.  The areas of joint and coordinated work are captured in the integrated 
results framework (Annex 5) and will be jointly managed and monitored. 

Strategic Objectives and Results Areas 

59. 
The Bank Group's contribution to addressing the intertwined development challenges of 
poverty and governance will comprise eleven core results areas through engagements at the national, 
local, and private sector level.  The anticipated outcomes presented below are the result of both 
ongoing operations and the new ones proposed in this CAS.   

- Strategic Objective 1: Stable Macro Economy 

MTPDP Goal: Maintain economic stability through further fiscal consolidation (improved revenue 
generation as well as strengthened expenditure management) , rationalized national government spending for 
devolved services, and reduced debt. 

Results Area and Outcomes 

1.1 Fiscal and financial stability through consolidation and improved macroeconomic risk 
management 
Outcome 1: Maintain tax effort through strengthened tax administration and tax policy reform 
Outcome 2: Improved efficiency and targeting of public expenditures 
 Outcome 3: Improved management of key fiscal and financial sector risks 

60. 
The first CAS objective supports the Government’s efforts to encourage growth and 
maintain macro-stability while coping with increased macroeconomic uncertainty.  Although the 
Philippines may not be as vulnerable to global economic conditions as some neighboring countries, 
growth prospects are likely to diminish over the short- to medium-term as the current global recession 
is likely to be deep and protracted and is expected to impact on the Philippines’ economy with a lag 
compared to other regional economies—remittances are a key factor in delaying the immediate 
impact.  Given limited fiscal space, a modest and well-targeted fiscal stimulus package will likely be 
needed, and the government is working on such a plan (the Economic Resiliency Plan).  To enable its 
delivery and without jeopardizing fiscal stability, a significantly enhanced effort to improve tax 
administration and implement tax policy reforms will be essential for the country to both protect the 
poor and preserve its hard-gained macro-fiscal stability. 

61. 
Outcome 1: Maintained tax effort through strengthened tax administration and tax 
policy reform.  The fiscal improvement of recent years needs to be placed onto a more permanent 
footing.  The fiscal consolidation that took place since 2002 resulted in substantial improvements in 
revenue collections from 2004 and 2006.  There is still considerable scope for increasing the efficiency 
of the tax collection system. Estimates suggest that the Government only collects about 60 percent of 
tax revenues due, because of widespread tax evasion and avoidance.  Current global developments 
warrant a countercyclical fiscal policy stance, and the Government’s initial response in part included 
tax cuts that have set back previous gains in tax collection.  The need to protect the most vulnerable 
members of society from the impact of the global economic crisis, however, argues more in favor of 
applying countercyclical pressure through an expansion of targeted social spending than by allowing 
tax revenues to decline.  Accordingly, the World Bank Group will focus on supporting government 
efforts to avoid protracted slippages in the tax revenues to GDP ratio—through support for both tax 

administration and policy reforms—to allow enough fiscal space for expanding targeted social 
spending without raising the fiscal deficit to unsustainable levels.  This would allow the non-

financial public sector debt ratio to fall further over the CAS period to a less burdensome level.  The 
eventual aim is to move to a broad-based, low rate, simplified tax structure that minimizes distortions, 
increases horizontal equity, facilitates tax administration and fosters compliance.  The Bank will 
engage in this area through lending (through the ongoing NPS for tax administration), technical 
assistance, policy notes, the Philippines Development Report, and quarterly economic reports, which 

18 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

would also help raise public awareness of these issues. The Bank could reform and scale up its NPS 
for tax administration once credible reform plans gain more traction.  Complementary to efforts to 
increasing the tax base and improving tax administration, key official statistics such as the system of 
national accounts and industry surveys would be improved to support more evidence-based policy 
making, broaden the tax base, and improve tax revenue forecasting, goal setting, and  allocation.   

62. 
Outcome 2: Improved management and greater transparency in public expenditures.  
On the expenditure side, the Philippine Government has generally been effective in controlling the 
aggregate level of spending in line with the country’s fiscal capacity.  But in a number of priority 
sectors such as education, health and infrastructure, the levels of spending tend to be insufficient for 
the country to achieve its own stated policy goals such as the MDGs or rapid infrastructure 
development.  The fiscal turnaround in the past few years has reversed the trend of mandatory 
expenditure cuts that compress discretionary spending items including capital outlays.  Yet capital 
outlays still remain below 2 percent of GDP, compared to almost 3 percent of GDP a decade ago.  In 
terms of sectoral allocation, the Government has increased the budgets of several priority agencies, 
including Public Works and Highways, Education, Health, Agriculture, and Social Welfare and 
Development over the past few years following annual reviews of expenditure programs in the 
respective sectoral agencies.  These allocation decisions generally improved the composition of 
spending within these agencies, but there still appears to be scope for improving the efficiency of 
expenditures in general.  For example, social safety net programs are still dispersed across agencies 
and poorly coordinated.  The inefficient nature of part of the agriculture budget has repeatedly been 
pointed out but the realignment of the budget composition has progressed slowly.  The public works 
budget is littered with small, fragmented projects with limited strategic thrust.  The Bank’s technical 
assistance will focus on improving expenditure allocation through introduction of DBM -led annual 
budget strategy papers and medium-term expenditure plans for the Departments of Education, Health, 
and Social Welfare and Development.  The Bank will also be supporting the Government in improving 
the targeting of key social protection spending such as the conditional cash transfer program. The 
ongoing TA will be supplemented with a programmatic AAA on public expenditure issues in close 
coordination with relevant government agencies. 

63. 
Outcome 3: Improved management of key fiscal and financial sector risks.  The 
Philippines’ public sector debt has come down significantly since 2003 when it peaked at over 100 
percent of GDP.  Recent debt sustainability analyses undertaken by both the IMF and the World Bank 
find that debt is broadly sustainable, with exchange rates and growth shocks having the most impact 
on debt dynamics.  Nevertheless, at an estimated 62 percent of GDP at end-2008, public debt remains 
at an elevated level for an emerging market, especially in the current global environment of heightened 
risk aversion and pullout from emerging markets.  The composition also exposes the Government to 
significant fiscal risks.  Key among these are exchange rate shocks as close to 60 percent of public 
debt is denominated in foreign currency, and rollover and interest rate risks given that a large share of 
the debt is short term; this results in large and growing gross financing requirements for the public 
sector (15.7; 18.5; and 19.7 percent of GDP for 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively).  There are also 
potentially important fiscal risks from contingent liabilities (e.g., PPPs), and GOCCs, and possible 
macro-financial risks arising from large exposure to government securities and balance sheet 
mismatches in the financial sector either directly or indirectly thorough their lending to the cor porate 
sector and/or household sectors.  The Bank and IFC (through its Advisory Services) can provide 
expertise and cross-country experience in matters related to fiscal and financial risk assessment and 
management, crisis response, managing insolvencies, and advice on risk reduction strategies and 
capital market development. 

64. 
Part or much of this segment of the results area would likely be done in partnership with 
the IMF (e.g., the financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on which the assessment of macro-
financial vulnerabilities would rest).  In the fiscal area, a public statement of fiscal risks could be an 
important outcome.  In the current global environment, the Department of Finance (DOF), the Central 
Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas – BSP), and Treasury are likely to be interested 

19 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

in better macro-fiscal and macro-financial risk management, and the Bank will engage them through 
policy notes as well as the FSAP, the Philippines Development Report and the Philippines 
Development Forum (PDF), and potentially, technical assistance.  

- Strategic Objective 2: Improved Investment Climate  

MTPDP Goals: Encourage the private sector to improve productivity, strengthen trade and investment and 
attain national investment rates of about 25-28 percent of GDP; continue with the integration of the transport 
system, and develop and diversify the energy mix; ensure smooth financing for entrepreneurs, including 
microfinance for underserved areas. 

Results Areas and Outcomes 
2.1  Enabling business environment to promote competitiveness, productivity and employment 
Outcome 1: Increased and improved delivery of infrastructure  
Outcome 2: Enhanced regulatory policy  frameworks and institutional capacity for investment,  service 
delivery, and trade 
Outcome 3: Increased investment and employment in rural and urban development 
2.2 Financial services  
Outcome 1: Increased delivery and access to financial services  

65. 
A better investment climate remains a key challenge for the Philippines, and one that is 
becoming more pertinent as risk aversion increases and availability of investment finance could 
decline.   There is a need to adopt policy reforms and implement programs that would help increase 
competitiveness and improve governance in order to attract more investment, which would lead to 
higher productivity and employment.  The key constraints to improving the investment climate 
include, among others, the lack of infrastructure, a weak regulatory framework, and limited access to 
finance.  As the pace of urbanization in the Philippines gains momentum, the Bank Group will expand 
its focus on the urban dimensions of development.  Urban centers, cities in particular, have an 
increasingly 
important role 
to play 
in 
improving 
the 
investment climate and 
improving 
competitiveness.  In addition to establishing business friendly environments—including conducive 
regulatory frameworks and quality infrastructure and services—cities and towns must also become 
more adept at managing complex and large-scale development programs.  

Results Area 2.1: Enabling environment for competitiveness, productivity, and employment 

66. 
Outcome 1: Increased and improved delivery of infrastructure. The Bank Group will help 
deliver more tangible transport results linked to improvements in governance through the ongoing 
Second National Roads Improvement and Management Program (NRIMP2), and will support 
expansion of this approach to the management of secondary and rural roads.  In urban areas, such as 
Metro Manila, the Bank will support the integration of the transport infrastructure improvement 
programs within a broader metropolitan development context and local government planning 
processes.  Investments in road upgrading and maintenance will increase their levels of service to 
facilitate efficient movement of people, goods and commerce along major corridors.  In rural areas, 
better roads will increase access to basic services, places of employment, and markets for products.  In 
addition, to operationalize the framework for PPPs with better risk-sharing between the public and 
private sector, the Bank Group will support one model PPP for a national toll road and one for a light 
rail project.  In response to a possible reduction in the availability of private financing due to the 
current global downturn, the Bank Group could provide risk mitigation products and assistance in 
preparing financing and implementation packages for public investments. The Bank Group will 
continue to support the public sector reform process in the sector dialogue under the Philippines 
Development Forum.  Better access to reliable and affordable power will promote investment in SMEs 
in rural and urban areas. It will also help to reduce the constraints to and the cost of doing business; 
improve the attractiveness of smaller urban and rural centers as engines of growth; expand coverage of 
business and service delivery; and, extend services to the underserved poor who reside in remote and 
isolated areas.  The Bank will continue its support for rural electrification and, together with IFC, will 
explore opportunities for new power investments.  A particular emphasis will be placed on supporting 

20 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

investments on renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro, geothermal, waste -to-energy and 
helping develop a program on renewable energy to access carbon credits from the new carbon finance 
facilities managed by the Bank.   To address issues of inadequate connectivity, the Bank Group will 
also explore innovative applications of ICT to achieve results, especially in rural areas.  

67. 
Outcome 2: Enhanced regulatory policy frameworks and institutional capacity for 
investment, service delivery, and trade.  In sectors where the Bank Group is providing investment 
financing—including transport, power, water, and waste management—the development of more 
transparent and stable regulatory frameworks will continue to be supported, including the 
strengthening of regulatory agencies for transport and power, solid waste, water supply and sanitation 
to balance investor concerns and consumer welfare; support for multi-year infrastructure investment 
programming, planning and strengthened budgeting at the national and local level including adequate 
technical capacity and financial resources in line agencies to prepare projects for implementation, for 
which private firms can bid competitively; development of trade and transport facilitation policies; 
and, increased private investment in renewable energy technologies.  The Bank Group will continue its 
efforts to support the reform of the institutional and legislative framework through bi-lateral and multi-
lateral engagements such as the infrastructure working group of the PDF.  If successful , these reforms 
could trigger increased financing from the World Bank and other partners (e.g., by creating a common 
policy for financing of operationally and financially sound water and sanitation providers) leading to 
significant scaling up of investments in the medium term.  IFC will continue to benchmark the 
Philippines’ overall investment climate through the Doing Business indicators, particularly in highly 
urbanized cities, to improve their administrative processes to reduce transaction costs for businesses.  
IFC will also seek to scale up Advisory Services in key sectors such as water supply, building on 
success of the Manila Water Company privatization. This will be complemented by MIGA’s political 
risk insurance product which seeks to reassure private investors , and standard products for Transfer 
Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract and War and Civil Disturbance.  In addition, the MIGA 
Small Investment Program (SIP) offers a more streamlined product for smaller scale investments in 
the country. 

68. 
Outcome 3: Increased investment and employment in rural and urban development.  In 
rural areas, the Bank Group will focus on both farm and non-farm sources of growth.  Efforts to scale 
up agriculture and agribusiness development through public investment opportunities that promote 
market-based approaches will be stepped up, including through joint effort of IFC and IBRD.  MIGA 
will continue to offer its guarantee product, and IBRD will also continue to support targeted local 
infrastructure development programs through the Second Mindanao Rural Development Project, the 
Second Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project, the LISCOP, the ARMM Social Fund 
Project and the KALAHI-CIDSS Project, and a proposed Secondary/Local roads project.  The Bank 
Group will intensify its focus on urban development through a broad-based engagement with urban 
practitioners and decision makers to identify strategic actions.  The forum for urban dialogue will also 
ensure broad consensus, and lay the foundation for a joint Government-Development Partner program 
of technical assistance, and analytical and advisory services to increase knowledge and shape public 
policy. The Bank’s ongoing support to the League of Cities’ ―City Development Strategy‖ (CDS) 
program will be continued and a broader partnership with the Housing and Urban Development 
Corporation, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and NEDA built with funding 
support from Cities Alliance and other development partners. IBRD will also continue to support 
urban investments through the Support for Strategic Local Investment and Development Project 
(SSLDIP), Metro Manila Urban Transport Project (MMURTRIP) and other new lending windows.  
IFC will explore a limited number of transactions in mining, an industry with high potential, but with 
considerable challenges and risks. IFC will seek transactions that can demonstrate the feasibility of 
environmentally sustainable and socially responsible mining in the Philippines, and can be 
implemented in full compliance with industry best practice and the IFC's Social and Environmental 
Performance Standards.

April 2, 2009 

Results Area 2.2:  Financial services  

69. 
Outcome 1:  Increased delivery and access to financial services.  The investment climate 
will improve when sources of financing, especially in the countryside and underserved areas, are 
available and accessible to the private sector, service providers, LGUs , and other entities for various 
types of investments, ranging from micro-small-medium enterprises to major capital expenditures. In 
addition to increasing access to financing, refinements and innovations will also be required to better 
tailor financing instruments to particular segments of the market; allow the entry of new financial 
service providers; and encourage borrowers to improve their credit worthiness.  To address weak 
capacity and limited access to affordable finance for LGUs, the Bank Group will facilitate access to 
additional sources of finance, such as commercial banks and sub-sovereign lending.  Increased access 
to grants and concessional financing will be provided, especially for LGUs with low-income and for 
complex public goods, such as sanitation and solid waste management.  In addition, LGUs will be 
supported in their efforts to increase own-source revenue through better business tax and real property 
tax collection.  Improvements in the overall regulatory framework for credit will also be supported to 
encourage greater private sector provision of credit, for example , through a single Credit Information 
Bureau for SME credit and increased coverage of the public credit registry.  Access to credit for small 
farmers will be improved by the development and adoption of guidelines and transparency 
mechanisms for the publicly-managed farm credit guarantee facility.  The Bank Group will promote 
options for increasing access to finance by private agribusiness.  Innovations will include the pilot 
testing of a long-term credit facility for agriculture/agribusiness and an index (weather) based 
agricultural insurance system to mitigate weather-related risks. 

- Strategic Objective 3: Better Public Service Delivery  

MTPDP Goals: Improve governance of service delivery to support reforms of social welfare and 
development; continue to pursue implementation of the health and basic education sector reform agenda to 
increase access to quality basic education, health services, and water and sanitation by the poor . 

Results Areas and Outcomes 
3.1 Public service delivery in key sectors 
Outcome 1: Improved access to quality basic education services 
Outcome 2: Improved access to health services  
Outcome 3: Increased household access to safe drinking water and sanitation services 
3.2 Basic service delivery in poor areas 
Outcome 1: Scaled-up provision of basic services through a nationwide community-driven development 
program 
Outcome 2: Enhanced effectiveness of public service delivery through more coordinated area -based 
approaches 

70. 
The third CAS objective focuses on improving public service delivery, especially for the 
poor.  Ensuring adequate access to and quality of public services , especially for the poor, remains a 
major challenge.  Improved access to and quality of public services in education, health, and water and 
sanitation are key to achieving social sector MDGs, some of which are lagging in the Philippines.  In 
poor areas, a multi-sectoral set of basic public services is needed to address poverty in a 
comprehensive manner.  As national and local governments share responsibility for achieving the 
MDGs, better coordination of activities is essential.  Well-targeted and transparent CDD programs that 
empower the poor to participate in local decision-making are effective instruments to strengthen 
transparency, coordination and cooperation, and promote social inclusion, leading to improved service 
delivery and outcomes for the poor.  Improved inter-agency coordination and institutional 
strengthening are also needed to realize greater synergy between anti-poverty initiatives in both rural 
and urban areas.  Further refinement of the overall decentralization framework is also needed to clarify 
the roles, responsibilities and funding arrangements at each level of government (see also strategic 
objective 5.3).

FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

Results Area 3.1:  Public services delivery in key sectors 

71. 
Outcome 1: Improved access to quality basic education services.  The Bank will continue 
to support DepEd’s reform program—the Basic Education Reform Agenda (BESRA)—as part of a 
multi-partner effort, through the National Program Support project.  The education reform agenda is 
based on improving institutional performance linked to attainment of MDGs for education.  While 
access—measured by enrolment rates—remains a concern, improving the quality of education services 
is also a priority given high drop-out and repetition rates, as well as low completion and achievement 
rates compared to other middle-income countries.  To achieve greater equity in access to basic 
education services and to support quality improvements in public schools nationwide, BESRA also 
supports school-based management, with corresponding decentralization of resources to local schools.  
A quality assurance and accountability framework with defined minimum service standards for inputs, 
outputs and outcomes, and a rigorous monitoring and evaluation mechanism at all DepEd levels are 
key elements of the reform initiatives undertaken across all public schools.  In addition, LGUs’ role in 
the delivery of education services will be strengthened by ensuring that local special education funds 
are properly mobilized to support education needs, that LGUs will lead the processes of education 
governance in their municipalities/cities, and that schools are well managed.   

72. 
Outcome 2: Improved access to health services.  In health, the Bank is supporting the 
Department of Health (DOH) reform program (FOURMULA 1) through the National Program 
Support project, which promotes the improvement of health outcomes and the attainment of MDGs for 
health through increased public investments in health care delivery, specifically investments to support 
an increased number of facility-based births, and improved immunization rates and treatment rates of 
tuberculosis, particularly of the poor.  It also calls for universal social health insurance coverage and 
enhanced insurance benefits, and the use of performance-based financing to support local level service 
delivery and improved performance of public hospitals.  It is also strengthening the regulatory 
capacity to assure access by the poor to quality medicines and other health goods and services.  The 
role of LGUs in ensuring access to health services will be strengthened.  At the provincial level, 
funding for health services is one of the largest expenditure items and plays a significant role in 
leveraging health services.  Incentives for LGU participation in the delivery of quality health services 
will be strengthened through various mechanisms, including performance-based measures. 

73. 
Outcome 3:  Increased household access to safe drinking water and sanitation services.  
In addition to its support for regulatory reforms in the water supply and sanitation sector (see strategic 
objective 2), the Bank Group will continue to support the expansion of access through investments: in 
Metro Manila’s water supply and sanitation systems, including output based subsidies to enable poor 
households to connect; in secondary cities through GFI project sub-projects for expansion of water 
supply, solid waste and septage and sewerage systems; and in community-level infrastructure through 
various community-driven development initiatives.  In the context of these engagements, the World 
Bank Group will continue to innovate and develop new instruments for engaging water and sanitation 
providers (WSPs) including Advisory Services for PPPs, scaling up existing output-based aid 
programs to include sanitation and reach poor households in other cities, financing small scale private 
providers of water supply, and scaling up investments in solid waste management facilities. 

Results Area 3.2:  Basic service delivery in poor areas 

74. 
Outcome 1:  Scaled-up provision of basic services through a nationwide community-
driven development program.  Poor communities typically lack adequate access to a range of basic 
public services, such as elementary schools, health clinics, day care centers, water supply and 
sanitation, access roads and bridges, electricity, small scale irrigation, livelihood support and others.  
To accelerate the delivery of public services to targeted poor communities, the Bank will partner with 
national government agencies, LGUs, development partners, NGOs and other civil society 
organizations to support a scaled-up CDD program with nationwide coverage, including a focus on 
areas and groups with specific characteristics that make service delivery especially challenging, such 
as disaster-prone areas; conflict-affected communities, especially in Mindanao; environmentally 

23 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

fragile areas; rural and urban poor communities, and vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as 
indigenous peoples. 

75. 
Outcome 2:  Enhanced effectiveness of service delivery through more coordinated area-
based approaches.  The effective delivery of services to the poor is hampered by weak inter -agency 
and inter-governmental coordination, and a fragmentation of funding sources.  Previous efforts to 
promote ―convergence‖ across the Government’s anti-poverty initiatives relied on top-down direction 
and have not been sustained.  A renewed effort is needed to promote greater synergy between 
programs designed to benefit the poor within specific geographic areas.  Utilizing an area-based focus, 
the Bank will explore opportunities to enhance the coordination between core anti -poverty initiatives, 
such as the conditional cash transfer program, community-driven development initiatives, and the 
reform programs of the education and health sectors, as well as improved inter -governmental 
coordination, especially between municipalities, provinces, and regions. 

- Strategic Objective 4: Reduced Vulnerabilities  

MTPDP Goal:  Reduce poverty and increase welfare, particularly in rural areas; sustainably manage the 
environment and natural resources; reduce disaster risk and improve recovery management . 

Results Areas and Outcomes 

4.1  Social protection system 
Outcome 1: National household poverty targeting system in place and used  
Outcome 2: Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program fully operational  
4.2 Disaster risk management and climate change 
Outcome 1: Disaster- and climate change-related risks reduced 
Outcome 2: Greenhouse gas emissions reduced through expansion of mitigation programs in key sectors 
and LGUs 
4.3 Stability and peace 
Outcome 1: Enhanced impact and conflict-sensitivity of development programs implemented in 
communities in Mindanao affected by armed or violent conflict 
Outcome 2: Scaled-up provision of basic services and livelihood support through community -driven 
development (CDD) in communities affected by armed or violent conflict 

76. 
The 
fourth strategic objective supports 
the Government’s efforts 
to reduce 
vulnerabilities for a large part of the population.  This objective is aligned with the MTPDP goals 
of reducing poverty and increasing welfare, particularly in the rural areas; managing disaster risks 
which disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable; and sustainably managing the environment 
and natural resources to safeguard livelihoods.   

Results Area 4.1:  Social protection system  

77. 
Outcome 1: National household poverty targeting system in place and used.  This 
outcome addresses the challenge of persistent high poverty incidence in the country by providing the 
Government as well as the Bank and other development partners with a more systematic and strategic 
framework for poverty reduction.  Currently, existing social assistance programs are not accurately 
reaching the poorest and most vulnerable households.  A strengthened national targeting system would 
increase access to social assistance for those who are actually poor; and conversely reduce the leakage 
of budgets allocated for this purpose to non-poor households.  As a milestone towards this outcome, 
and to take advantage of the opening provided by the coming change in administration and the 
formulation of a new MTPDP, the Bank will assist in ensuring that a s trong anti-poverty program 
framework and policies, for both rural and urban poor, are adopted in the MTPDP.  The poverty 
targeting system will strengthen the coherence, synergy and effectiveness in the design and 
implementation of poverty reduction policies and measures shared across various government 
programs (e.g., MTPDP, MTPIP, plans, budgets).  It will also help to ensure that planned poverty 
reduction investments to be financed by the Bank are more coordinated, consistent, properly 
sequenced, and responsive to national and local development policy contexts.

78. 
Outcome 2: Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program fully operational.  The 
Government is implementing a CCT program.  Under the CAS, the WBG will support the improved 
design and operation of a well-functioning CCT program.  The CCT program will address 
vulnerabilities by: (i) providing income support and protection to the poor to shocks, including recent 
food price increases; (ii)  helping to reverse deteriorating educational indicators (primary enrolment 
and drop-out rates) which are likely reactions to households coping with increasing destitution; (iii) 
helping to improve health outcomes in critical areas, including maternal mortality and childhood 
morbidity; (iv) improving the governance of social assistance programs in general, by raising the bar 
as a program that is based on enhanced transparency and accountability; (v) increasing the supply-side 
responsiveness and accountability (by DepEd, DOH, and LGUs) to address stimulated demand; and, 
(vi) providing a ―convergence framework‖ that allows the relevant agencies to work in tandem on the 
supply and demand side measures in order to get social services to work for the poor. 

Results Area 4.2:  Disaster risk management and climate change 

79. 
Outcome 1: Disaster- and climate change-related risks reduced.  The Philippines is 
extremely vulnerable to natural disasters due to a high incidence of severe weather conditions—
especially floods, typhoons, and drought—and a large number of earthquakes and active volcanoes. 
This inherently high disaster risk is likely to be exacerbated by the effects of global climate change.  
The resultant human and economic costs of disasters are significant, with estimates suggesting 0.5 
percent of GDP lost annually due to natural disasters.  The country has begun to develop more in-
depth strategies for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation to address the dimensions 
of: (i) strengthening preparedness and adaptation at the local level with a focus on improving planning 
and capacity, knowledge and understanding of measures to reduce disaster risk, including adaptation 
to climate variability; (ii) reducing vulnerability of farmers to crop risk through support for innovative 
solutions such as weather risk insurance schemes for assisting small farmers to cope with the 
economic losses stemming from disasters; and, (iii) improving disaster risk financing strategy at 
national and local level through support for identification of appropriate instruments and establishment 
of new financing windows for preparedness, response and recovery.  Bank support for these initiatives 
is through the Global Fund for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) technical assistance to 
enhance the development of disaster risk management and climate change strategies; new financing 
instruments, such as a CAT-DDO; and GEF grant-funded activities, including a possible Climate 
Change Adaptation project, which would integrate climate risk management into national and local 
development planning in agriculture and natural resource management and would demonstrate cost-
effective adaptation measures to strengthen the resilience of investments, initially in those sectors. 
These measures may be expanded to other vulnerable sectors or regions such as in coastal areas, where 
an integrated coastal zone management approach could contribute to reducing vulnerability to natural 
disasters and other hazards while promoting sustainable livelihoods and poverty reduction. 

80. 
Outcome 2: Greenhouse gas emissions reduced through expansion of mitigation 
programs in key sectors and LGUs.  While the Philippines is a minor emitter of greenhouse gases, it 
is committed to continue to pursue cost-effective solutions for reducing emissions.  The emergence of 
new mitigation financing instruments—particularly the Carbon Partnership Facility and the Clean 
Technology Fund—opens up the potential for developing broader mitigation programs in areas such as 
renewable energy, reducing air and water pollution, and solid waste management.  Building on the 
experience and successes of ongoing mitigation projects in the Philippines supported by the Bank, 
such as geothermal and wind projects and wastewater treatment projects which already commit to an 
emission reduction of about 2 Mt CO2e, opportunities will be pursued in the power, transport and 
waste management sectors.  In cooperation with other development partners, the World Bank will 
assist the Philippines in mobilizing existing and future sources of international financing assistance.

Results Area 4.3:  Stability and peace  

81. 
The Philippines continues to be adversely affected by violent and armed conflict in some 
parts of the country, especially in the Mindanao region.  Sustained growth and development for the 
Mindanao region as a whole cannot take place without giving considerable attention to the 
development needs of identified conflict-affected areas, which comprise a sizeable portion of the 
island.  However, recent armed conflict during 2008, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of 
internally displaced persons and destruction of livelihood and property, and weak governance in many 
parts of the region reduce the effectiveness of development programs.  The complexity of the situation 
in Mindanao requires a flexible approach in designing and supporting development programs. 

82. 
Outcome 1: Enhanced impact and conflict-sensitivity of development programs 
implemented in communities in Mindanao affected by armed or violent conflict .  The goal will be 
to support, through the Mindanao Trust Fund, rehabilitation of homes for returning Internally 
Displaced Persons (IDPs) from recent and previous fighting between the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.  The program will be implemented in joint 
coordination with LGUs, NGOs and key development stakeholders under a coordinated approach with 
development partners.  The CAS period will see a major push to enhance the conflict sensitivity of 
Bank operations in conflict-affected areas in Mindanao and elsewhere in the Philippines to support the 
creation of an environment conducive to peace through more cohesive communities and stronger local 
governance (see Box 4). 

Box 4.  Enhancing Conflict Sensitivity 

Future activities will have enhanced conflict sensitivity defined by one or more of the following 
characteristics: (i) transparent and equitable distribution of development resources; (ii) broad -based 
consultations with different parties to the conflict over development needs; (iii) conflict -related needs are met 
(IDPs, rehabilitation of damaged assets, etc); (iv) strong grievance redress system is in place to capture 
problems and mitigate the risk of corruption; (v) focus on opportunities to bring conflicting communities 
together around neutral activities like identifying development needs and joint project execution (if 
appropriate); and (vi) strengthened local dispute resolution mechanisms. 

The enhanced conflict sensitivity will be achieved through three primary means: firstly, significant AAA 
work to generate systematic analysis on conflict typology, incidence and patterns; public expenditure to track 
development resources; impact evaluation to measure the effectiveness of development operations; and finally, 
detailed analyses of local conflict dynamics, including communal land and natural resource disputes; secondly, 
working closely with major development partners, harmonizing community driven development approaches to 
strengthen communities, enhancing local governance, and creating economic opportunities; and thirdly, 
adapting operations to conflict conditions, including through activities to encourage inter -communal 
cooperation and strengthen local dispute resolution mechanisms. 

83. 
Outcome 2: Scaled-up provision of basic services and livelihood support through 
community-driven development (CDD) in communities affected by armed or violent conflict .  
The goal will be to scale up provision of basic services, livelihood and peace programs through 
community driven development including capacity building for LGUs, People’s Organizations and 
other local groups.  This can be accomplished through additional financing (loan) for ARMM Social 
Fund and/or an expanded MTF-RDP (grant).  The CDD approach will assist in mainstreaming good 
governance at the local level through improved transparency in budgeting, allocation, and 
management of public resources and accountability in the effective use of these resources to improve 
services at the community level.  For non-conflict-affected areas, there is a need to work with 
Regional NEDA and LGUs to identify areas for development and investment.  A detailed evaluation 
of community development approaches utilized by the Bank and key partners in conflict-affected areas 
will also be undertaken to assess what has and has not been working.  Results from this evaluation wil l 
be used to harmonize development approaches, based on a strong understanding of effectiveness.

Cross-Cutting Theme: Good Governance  

MTPDP Goals: Strengthen partnerships and accountability among government, civil society, and the private 
sector; fully operationalize the Government Electronic Procurement System; conduct integrity development 
reviews in government agencies, and expand and institutionalize lifestyle-checks.   

Results Areas and Outcomes 
5.1 Governance and anticorruption in selected national government agencies 
Outcome 1: Core business systems, processes and capacities in selected agencies improved  
5.2 Procurement and public financial management reforms at national and local levels 
Outcome 1: The Procurement Law more strictly enforced 
Outcome 2: Improved management and greater transparency of public finances  
5.3 Better local governance through effective decentralization 
Outcome 1: Deepened and refined decentralization through broad -based reforms 
Outcome 2: Strengthened LGU performance for more effective service delivery 

84. 
Faced with the considerable governance challenges in the Philippines, the Bank has 
pursued strengthening public institutions as a key objective in the current CAS13.  While 
continuing to pursue this objective, the Bank’s new governance strategy for the Philippines 
emphasizes systematic efforts to increase transparency, accountability and participation at both 
national and local levels as a cross-cutting approach in pursuit of each of the results areas described 
below.  This is in line with the Bank’s country governance and anticorruption framework (CGAC), 
which emphasizes both government capacity and demand for good governance.  The new strategic 
emphasis takes advantage of the well-known strengths of the Philippine civil society as both advocates 
of governance reforms and partners in the Government’s own good governance initiatives. 

85. 
Strong political commitment backed by a broad consensus is essential for successful 
governance reforms.  The first two years of the CAS period offer an opportunity for building 
consensus and setting a clear agenda for governance reforms to be pursued by the next administration.  
During this period, the Bank will engage a broad spectrum of Filipino stakeholders and external 
development partners to help galvanize drivers of change for governance reform, so that efforts aimed 
at building a capable and accountable state are more consistent and sustained.  The Bank will pilot 
non-traditional and innovative approaches to promoting and supporting governance reforms, including 
working with actors outside the Executive branch of the national government.  There will be particular 
emphasis on strengthening the analytical bases for governance reform advocacy by a broad coalition 
of CSOs.  In partnership with other interested partners, the Bank will pursue the establishment of a 
consortium of CSOs and local academic institutions to carry out rigorous analysis and systematic 
documentation of political economy and governance-related topics.  

Results Area 5.1:  Governance and anticorruption in selected national government agencies 

86. 
Outcome 1: Core business systems, processes and capacities in selected agencies 
improved. In the new CAS, specific criteria will be utilized to determine agencies where Bank-
supported TA for agency-level governance improvements is likely to have greatest impact, including 
the intrinsic importance of the agencies for the CAS’s renewed emphasis on direct poverty reduction 
and governance improvements, as well as reform commitment and fiduciary benchmarking.  The Bank 
will explore ways to use the Government’s own mechanisms, such as annual agency audit reports, as a 
basis for assessing the quality of agencies’ governance.  The Bank will work with a small number of 
relatively well-performing agencies to ensure governance gains are sustained and their capacities are 
enhanced further. In addition, a few agencies which occupy important roles in the public sector and yet 
are known for their governance challenges would also be included as long as there is commitment to a 
governance reform agenda.  Agencies initially prioritized include: (i) the Departments of Education 
(DepEd), Health (DOH), Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), which are considered to be well-
managed agencies and each having a relatively coherent sectoral reform framework critical for poverty 
reduction; the Bank is already providing support to the internal audit units at those departments; (ii)

April 2, 2009 

Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), 
which are often cited as among the most corruption-prone agencies but have taken steps to put in place 
governance reforms; and, (iii) the Judiciary, which is responsible for fundamental functions of good 
governance. 

Results Area 5.2:  Procurement and public financial management reforms at national and local 
levels 

87. 
Outcome 1: The Procurement Law more strictly enforced.  A well-functioning public 
procurement system is critical to overall government effectiveness.  The reform agenda for 
procurement has been clearly articulated as the complete implementation of the Government 
Procurement Reform Act (2003).  Much has already been achieved in reforming the legislative and 
regulatory framework; however, important challenges remain in strengthening the institutional 
framework and management capacity; enhancing the competitiveness of the public procurement 
market; and, improving the integrity and transparency of the system.  In the recently concluded 2008 
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), actions by government agencies and development 
partners have been well-organized and coordinated resulting in agreed actions to further improve the 
public procurement system, including the issuance of improved Implementing Rules and Regulations.  
The Bank will continue its support to the Government’s effort at harmonizing the implementing rules 
and regulations for the procurement law.  Significant technical assistance and support from 
development partners will still be needed to further strengthen implementation and enforcement.  The 
Bank has played an active role in the procurement reform agenda and will continue to do so under the 
new CAS.  The Bank will work to improve the overall quality of procurement through its national and 
local development projects, by providing support to further strengthen civil society oversight and 
improve public access to procurement information; expand the e-Government Procurement; roll out a 
professionalization program for practitioners; improve procurement audit; and, bring down 
implementation of the procurement law to the sub-national level.   

88. 
Outcome 2: Improved management and greater transparency of public finances.  
Effective public financial management (PFM) systems form the core of a country’s national public 
management framework.  While a major component of the reform agendas discussed in Results Area 
5.1 aims to improve agency-level PFM performance, these reforms are not likely to have a significant 
impact unless accompanied by broader, government-wide efforts at both the national and local levels 
to strengthen the overall PFM framework.  Government efforts in the area of PFM reform have so far 
been fragmented and progressed more slowly in some important dimensions, such as improved 
accountability and transparency in budget execution and financial management.  The Philippines 
would benefit from having a modernized public financial management law that more clearly regulates 
and disciplines the management of public money.  Once a new law is in place, it is expected that 
subsequent efforts to support full implementation of the new law would be more coherently organized 
to avoid unnecessary fragmentation of efforts.  Another critical ingredient for good PFM is a 
comprehensive government financial management information system which would allow the 
Government to track, manage and report on financial transactions in a timely and transparent manner.  
The absence of such a system is currently a major impediment to budget transparency as well as 
operational efficiency.  The Bank is positioned to support PFM reform depending on demand from 
relevant government agencies in charge of PFM and work with civil society groups to promote 
increased budget transparency, such as through formation of a consortium of CSOs to monitor and 
analyze government expenditures.  A major challenge will be to improve inter-agency coordination 
among key oversight agencies to expand support for the cross-cutting PFM agendas. 

Results Area 5.3:  Better local governance through more effective decentralization 

89. 
Given the country’s decentralized democratic system, effective and accountable local 
government units (LGUs) provide the foundation for good governance.  Despite the emergence of 
some LGUs as strong champions of good governance since the introduction of the Local Government 
Code (LGC) in 1991, the overall decentralization framework is not conducive to promoting better 

28 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

local governance on a wide scale.  Assignments of service delivery responsibilities across different 
levels of government remain ambiguous for some services, and the internal revenue allotment (IRA) 
formula acts as a disincentive for increased local revenue effort for many LGUs.  In addition, the IRA 
formula does not take full account of LGUs’ relative fiscal capacities, service delivery needs or 
poverty status.  The Philippine Development Forum (PDF) Decentralization and Local Government 
Working Group, which the Department of Interior and Local Government convenes and the Bank co-
convenes, is the principal venue for engagement on these discussions and for coordinating actions by 
both the Government and development partners around a four-point agenda: (i) local government 
finance; (ii) capacity building; (iii) performance benchmarking; and (iv) policy reforms on devolution.  
The Bank—together with other development partners active in this area—contributes to the 
discussions, conducts studies, and aligns its financial and technical assistance to the broad agenda set 
by the Working Group. 

90. 
Outcome 1: Deepened and refined decentralization through broad-based reforms.  There 
is a general awareness among the stakeholders involved in the decentralization debate that the 
fundamental policy framework, as embodied in the LGC, needs improvements.  Through the PDF 
Working Group, the Government, assisted by the Bank and the other development partners, has 
initiated several efforts to reform the LGC; however, progress to date has been slow and incremental.  
While prospects for a major overhaul of the decentralization framework through revision of the LGC 
are currently limited, it is important to work toward a technical level consensus on a medium-term 
reform agenda.  Under the proposed CAS, the Bank will engage more frontally in debating pros and 
cons of the current arrangements and proactively suggest possible options for improving the overall 
intergovernmental arrangements.  The Bank will undertake a programmatic series of analytical 
activities and advocacy work in support of the PDF Working Group agenda. 

91. 
Outcome 2:  Strengthened LGU performance for effective service delivery.  The capacity 
of LGUs to respond effectively to the needs of the poor is often undermined by weak incentives and 
poor governance.  Although the problems of incentives and governance result largely from the 
patronage-driven nature of local politics and partly from the deficiencies in the design and 
implementation of the decentralization framework, there is still significant scope for enhancing LGUs’ 
incentives for service delivery within the existing decentralization framework.  The Bank will support 
the development of a more explicit strategy for LGU service delivery improvement using a 
combination of top-down incentives—through support for a performance-based grants system that 
links the availability of additional grants to the attainment of pre-specified performance criteria of 
good governance—and bottom-up initiatives—through the scaling up of the KALAHI-CIDSS project 
into a nationwide program as the primary vehicle for promoting community empowerment, 
strengthening bottom-up planning and budgeting, and enhancing social accountability.  Other tools to 
be introduced include scorecards and benchmarking systems.  In addition, the Bank will seek other 
opportunities to enhance citizens’ participation, and involve NGOs in addressing specific governance 
objectives. 

C. 

IMPLEMENTING THE FY10-12 COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

Operationalizing Governance  

92. 
A major innovation of the new CAS is to mainstream systematic approaches to 
addressing governance challenges and operationalize them across the portfolio and at each step 
of the project cycle.  In line with the Bank’s CGAC framework, the Bank will apply upstream 
governance/political economy diagnostics to all new operations at the pre-concept stage so that the 
decision to move forward to the PCN stage would be substantiated.  Thus, proper measures to mitigate 
governance risks are included in the project design and at the same time the project can maximize its 
impact on governance improvements.  All Bank projects will abide by an enhanced standard of 
information disclosure.  All new projects will be designed to contribute to governance improvements 

29 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

in ways that are appropriate to the specific context of the sector and the operation but still following a 
systematic strategic framework.  During implementation, the activities will be reviewed to ensure that 
the governance and anticorruption measures generate the expected results.  The review will be 
conducted on a sample of projects identified from the risk level at entry or on a case-by-case basis if 
issues arise.  Finally, at completion, the Bank will make sure that the completion report will assess the 
achievements in governance, hence providing basis for the next Bank investments in the sector. 

93. 
The Country Office has strengthened the fiduciary team and created a Philippine 
Governance Advisory Team (PGAT) to better operationalize governance considerations in 
project design.  The fiduciary team has been expanded with additional staff, leading to a strong 
international expertise on transactions. PGAT, a multi-disciplinary team led by the Portfolio Manager 
and composed of Manila-based governance specialists and senior operations staff, will offer advice to 
the task teams to address project governance risks and opportunities appropriately and systematically.  
The PGAT, supported by the Bangkok Governance Hub and an additional full-time governance 
advisor, will prioritize activities in nationwide and sectoral governance reforms, and will advise task 
teams on governance improvements in specific activities, including through the use of ―Governance 
Filters‖ (see Box 5). 

Box 5:  Governance Filters 

The Governance Filters will help task teams in charge of developing new activities identify the level of 
governance risks they should expect to face.  The filters will facilitate the decision process for the lending 
program and will provide the information needed to build a mitigation plan when the project concept has been 
approved. They will include government data such as the COA audits for the corresponding government 
agency, and the Integrity Action Plan of the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission (PAGC). In addition, the 
teams will carry out additional risk analysis, varying in substance according to the level of preparation. At the 
pre-concept stage, the teams will complement the government criteria with an analysis of the political risk of 
the potential activity.  While a high risk can lead to a decision not to pursue the idea, management may also 
decide to take a calculated risk, and ask for further analysis in the next stage. At the concept stage, risk 
assessment can then relate to the project concept. The analysis will assess the capacity versus corruption risk, 
and provide a mitigation program aimed at reducing the potential sources of corruption. At this stage, 
management can again make the decision not to pursue project preparation, with still a limited impact on Bank 
expenses.  Finally, the Governance Filters apply at the last stage, the decision review meeting, with the main 
objective of strengthening the mitigation action plan. The overall process wo uld then ensure a comprehensive 
analysis of governance risk leading to a well documented decision of management to accept or reject it with 
limited cost. 

94. 
Recognizing the need to improve performance, the Government has taken steps to 
address some of the bottlenecks in project implementation.  These focus on: (i) reviewing budget 
execution practices of both the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and implementing 
agencies with the view to simplifying the allocation of resources; (ii) ensuring the sustainability of 
policies, organizational structures and skills from project design, preparation and implementation; (iii) 
strengthening project implementation capacity of government agencies; and (iv) addressing issues in 
the financing and implementation of devolved activities by clarifying the roles and implementing 
mechanisms for MDFO, LGUs and national agencies in LGU subprojects. 

95. 
Another area of Bank support would be in strengthening the Government’s monitoring 
process and systems.  The Government recognizes the need to put in place a more systematic 
monitoring process and review of projects, particularly those in problem status so that early follow-up 
action will be taken.  Also of concern are the budget execution practices of the DBM and 
implementing agencies.  A number of budget-related issues have been raised as one of the main causes 
of project implementation delays.  The Bank may also need to provide technical assistance to improve 
budget execution not only to the DBM but also to the implementing agencies.

Managing the Program  

96. 
The World Bank Group will organize its Philippines program and its country team 
along the lines of the four strategic objectives, one cross-cutting theme, and eleven core results 
areas.  For each of these the Bank will organize, budget for, and monitor an integrated program of 
lending, AAA, trust funds and partnership activities.  Individual products remain the responsibility of 
sector units, but management of the key results will be done by multi-sectoral teams, coordinated 
through the Country Leadership Team (CLT).  The World Bank Group will flexibly adjust resource 
allocation among results areas depending on progress and emerging opportunities in those areas.  
IFC’s resources will be integrated in the results areas that will be jointly pursued, notably in 
infrastructure, agribusiness and financial sector.  Consistent with the overall strategy, MIGA will also 
continue to offer its guarantee products.   

Box 6. CAS Results Monitoring  

Monitoring of the CAS will be carried out by the Country Leadership Team (CLT), with a designated 
leader responsible for each of the strategic objectives of the CAS.  Reporting for the different CAS results 
will be consolidated at the level of the four CAS strategic objectives and the cross -cutting theme of 
governance, and will form a central part of the mid -year and year-end reviews of the Work Program 
Agreements and CAS progress.  To support this effort, a quarterly report detailing expenditures and 
disbursements under each of the activity codes mapped to each of the specific results areas and strategic 
objectives and a semi-annual qualitative review of progress on each of the five strategic objectives will be 
prepared.  As part of this process, task teams will be asked to provide brief updates on prog ress achieved on 
individual activities. 

97. 
In delivering its program, the World Bank Group will pay special attention to 
strengthening the portfolio, improving lending efficiency, furthering the knowledge agenda , and 
leveraging its resources through strategic partnerships and trust funds.  This will be part of an 
implementation approach with clear indicators and commitments for bringing down the cost of doing 
business with the Bank as well as the cost of business for the Bank itself in terms of preparation time 
and budget.  The World Bank Group will actively mobilize other funding sources to support 
analytical, advisory and supervision work, and will use resources more efficiently through risk-based 
approaches to fiduciary supervision to achieve enhanced implementation efficiencies. 

Loan Portfolio and Pipeline Management 

98. 
The IBRD’s ongoing portfolio consists of 18 active loans with total loan commitments of 
US$1.2 billion, of which US$871 million undisbursed, and 78 country specific grant projects with 
a total value of US$140 million.  Nine loans (including one DPL) totaling US$1.05 billion were 
approved during the period FY06-08.  This was higher than the US$450 million - US$900 million 
anticipated in the CAS and the US$852 million approved lending between FY00-05.  The increase was 
due to Government’s improved fiscal position starting in FY06, which allowed adequate budget space 
to accommodate requirements of new projects.  Improved fiscal performance also resulted in the 
processing of the first Development Policy Loan (DPL1) to the Philippines amounting to US$250 
million in FY06.  Nine projects exited the portfolio during the same period.  The trust fund portfolio 
has likewise grown and evolved in recent years, with free-standing recipient-executed trust funds 
accounting for 41 percent of total trust fund commitments as of mid-FY09, representing a marked 
increase from FY06 when these types of trust funds accounted for only 17 percent of the Philippines 
trust fund portfolio. 

99. 
Despite the 
improved 
lending commitment for the FY06-08 period, portfolio 
performance reflects a slow start for the majority of projects and overall disbursements lower 
than expected.  Portfolio review findings indicate that similar issues cause delays in both regular and 
national program support (NPS) operations, as well as trust funds, and adversely affect portfolio 
performance.  In FY08, 16.7 percent of projects by number and 7.8 percent by amount were at risk .

The Government has been taking steps to address some of these implementation issues through 
important policy actions and has intervened in some cases in order to secure renewed ownership and 
support from government agency champions.  These interventions have started to exhibit positive 
results, including the favorable FY08 disbursement ratio (20.1 percent compared to 15.2 percent in 
FY07), but the portfolio continues to face challenges.  None of the projects evaluated by IEG during 
the last five years was rated unsatisfactory.  Both the Bank and the Government recognize the 
importance of maintaining performance momentum and the need to formulate and institutionalize 
sustainable measures so that commitment levels will be matched with disbursements and eventually 
achieve desired results.   

100. Efforts will also continue to improve and strengthen partnerships with the Government, 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) 
aimed at harmonizing and aligning processes between financial institutions and government agencies 
to further enhance aid effectiveness and reduce transaction costs.  Ongoing harmonization work on 
environmental and social safeguards will be a continuing activity and further harmonization work on 
government procurement system will be pursued even as the Philippines is being considered as one of 
the candidates to be a pilot country for the ―Use of Country Systems‖ in the Bank-Supported 
Operations Piloting Program.  The Bank will sustain coordination with oversight agencies through 
quarterly meetings and the conduct of joint portfolio reviews and will continue to work with the 
Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) and development partners on procurement reform to 
improve the government’s public procurement system in line with the recommendations of the CPAR .  
Annex 9 contains further information on the Philippines harmonization agenda. 

101. The Bank Group will actively engage with the Government in a dialogue aimed at 
addressing weak technical capacity of implementing agencies, including measures to improve 
quality at entry and project implementation.  The Government recognizes the need to improve 
existing monitoring practices, particularly for projects in problem status, so that early follow -up action 
can be taken.  The Bank has offered to provide technical assistance to strengthen institut ional capacity 
and monitoring processes and systems to help improve government fiduciary functions.  The Bank has 
also been providing assistance to improve budget execution practices of both the Department of 
Budget and Management (DBM) and selected executing agencies.  The Bank will also help the 
Government to identify the main constraints to building and retaining capacity in government 
agencies, including issues linked to implementation of the government -wide rationalization process. 

102. Going forward, the Bank will adopt strong performance criteria for project preparation 
and portfolio operations building on keen engagement and a strong interest shared with 
government agencies to improve efficiency and responsiveness.  This will require making more 
strategic choices and agreeing to engage only in areas where the Bank has strong partners and 
joint/shared commitment to deliver results.  The CMU will take an active hand in shaping the pipeline 
by encouraging teams to pursue additional financing for well-functioning operations and engaging 
with teams during the pre-identification stage.  Opportunities to pursue additional financing for well 
functioning projects will be actively evaluated with a view to reducing transactions costs, deepening 
and broadening successful reform efforts and building on tested fiduciary and implementation 
arrangements. 

103. New project ideas will be screened early in the process and preparation resources will be 
allocated incrementally based on project complexity and demonstrated progress and traction 
with counterparts.  Teams will initially be allocated modest budgets to develop the business case for 
new and potentially innovative project ideas.  These initial assessments will cover the critical issues 
and progress of ongoing reforms in the sector and the likelihood of success in proposed new reform 
areas.  As part of the WPA process, all project ideas will be subject to an initial CMU and Sector 
Management Unit (SMU) review before they are cleared and provided with additional resources to 
move to the pre-identification stage, leading to the PCN preparation phase.  The Governance Filters 
and the PGAT’s inputs during the PCN review will also guide further preparation work.

104. The Bank has identified a set of early “Readiness Filters” , agreed with the Government, 
which will be used to screen projects during the regular programming discussions.  This process 
will allow both the Government and the Bank to effectively determine ―ready-to-go‖ projects and 
decide to postpone or drop those that will not pass the filters.  Only project ideas that pass the early 
Readiness Filters will be listed in the Bank’s annual program and will receive full preparation budgets.  
Project preparation activities will subsequently be monitored closely and expected to be comple ted 
efficiently and within Bank standards. 

105. The Bank has also identified a set of country team objectives for project implementation 
and supervision.  The CMU will continue to monitor progress of ongoing projects and pursue 
improvements in portfolio management in order to accelerate disbursements.  The Bank may also 
decide to refocus engagement in some problematic sectors depending on country portfolio review 
results.  The Bank will aim to further strengthen implementation and M&E review practices in project 
supervision and monitoring.  Timely ISR reporting for all projects will be strictly imposed and 
increased supervision budgets will be provided, if necessary, for projects that are considered high risk 
or in problem status.  The practice of integrated fiduciary performance reviews will be continued but 
using a more risk-based approach, with increased attention to team composition and thematic reviews 
for high risk projects.  The Bank will also pursue a broader post review strategy that will include 
periodic reviews of country systems and processes, in addition to transactions review processes, in 
order to better assess agency performance, including governance practices and challenges of 
implementing agencies.  The Bank will also proactively work with INT to address specific project 
complaints.  

Knowledge Agenda 

106. The Bank will pursue an expanded and re-focused knowledge agenda through close 
coordination with the Government and by establishing partnerships with (consortia) of think- 
tanks and universities.   This will maximize the developmental impact of its analytical work in the 
Philippines, taking into account the context of a new administration and plans for a new MTPDP.  The 
knowledge agenda will also involve and build on a network of Knowledge for Development Centers in 
leading state and private universities.   Understanding the underlying causes of poverty and how the 
poor can better benefit from growth are critical questions for the Philippines.  The World Bank, along 
with other partners, has embarked on a study to further analyze the nature and causes of recent poverty 
and to assess how growth could result in greater reductions in poverty. 

107. The AAA program will be developed around thematic areas that are consistent with the 
CAS objectives.  The AAA program will focus on deepening the Bank’s knowledge of and 
engagement in the key strategic areas identified in the CAS without being restrictive.  The AAA 
program would therefore focus on aspects of one or more of the following themes: (i) macro/fiscal 
stability; (ii) investment climate; (iii) better service delivery for the poor; (iv) reducing vulnerabilities; 
and (v) governance.   

108. A more consultative process to identify and agree on priority AAA activities will be 
established with government and other stakeholders.  The Bank will aim at a more demand-driven 
AAA program, while acknowledging the difficulty of satisfying multiple sources of demand.  A 
process would be established to capture demand for AAA and respond in a constructive and strategic 
way, combining efforts with other partners whenever possible.  This will address concerns identified 
in IEG evaluations.  Some AAA will also respond to Bank needs to further knowledge in critical areas 
where policy and operational response would be needed.  AAA work focused on innovative ideas and 
business development would be important to guide the Bank program in the Philippines as well as to 
ensure the Bank stays relevant and anticipates future demand by government and other stakeholders.  
The Bank is planning to establish an "Advisory Council" of eminent Filipino intellectuals to provide 
advice on the Bank’s AAA work.  Such an Advisory Council will be in addition to the broader 
consultations with government and other stakeholders and may eventually broaden its focus to advise 
the Bank team on the whole country program.

109. Monitoring the AAA at all stages will be improved.  The Bank will assign dedicated senior 
staff to ensure that AAA monitoring is carried out more effectively in order to improve 
implementation and enhance impact.  The AAA leader will coordinate the overall AAA portfolio to 
ensure that the activities undertaken are in line with priorities agreed between the Government and the 
Bank, and will form a cohesive support structure for the achievement of the strategic objectives of the 
CAS.   

Trust Fund Portfolio Management 

110. The Country Management Unit manages the trust fund portfolio jointly with the loan 
portfolio.  The country trust fund coordinator monitors trust funds in the pipeline and progress on trust 
funds under implementation and alerts task teams when action is needed through the monthly 
management reporting process.  Trust funds are also incorporated in other management reports on the 
overall country program, including the CAS, the Memorandum of Understanding on the annual work 
program and annual retrospective reports.  In addition, the Portfolio and Quality Team conducts 
periodic reviews of the country’s combined loans and grants portfolio together with implementing and 
oversight agencies and shares its findings with Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to 
identify cross cutting issues and solutions.  Annex 8 contains a list of World Bank Group-managed 
Trust Funds in the Philippines. 

111. The Bank team is working toward integrating trust fund planning and management with 
overall business processes.   The Bank will use the WPA process to get an indicative list of lending 
and non-lending activities planned along with the proposed funding sources for such activities (Bank 
budget, trust funds, or other) to allow the CMU to assess their strategic fit with the CAS in advance of 
the formal submission of trust fund proposals.  The Bank will work closely with program managers of 
trust fund programs managed by the networks or at the regional level to ensure that CMU inputs and 
sign off are secured prior to the approval of trust fund proposals to be implemented in the Philippines. 

112. Trust fund proposals are currently put through a rigorous review process during which 
the Country Leadership Team reviews and prioritizes new proposals to ensure alignment with 
country priorities and the CAS.  In the case of free standing jumbo trust funds involving partners, 
such as the Mindanao Trust Fund, the task teams pursue a formal due diligence and review process 
similar to the one applied to regular Bank operations, comprising a concept review, decision meeting 
and appraisal prior to the execution of legal agreements to formally establish the trust funds.   

113. Active involvement of country and regional trust fund coordinators at the conceptual 
stage has proved effective in anticipating questions or issues, facilitating the approval process, 
and helping ensure smooth implementation. Further, country management, sector specialists and 
fiduciary staff conduct training on Bank policies and fiduciary procedures relating to trust funds 
shortly before, or immediately after grant signing to facilitate start up of grant implementation.  The 
training is customized to the specific needs and circumstances of the agency/ies implementing the 
grant, making it more effective compared to generic training.  Fiduciary and disbursements staff are 
also available to provide hands on coaching and trouble shooting to implementing agencies. 

Fostering Stronger Partnerships  

114. The Bank has established strong partnerships in the country with Government and other 
stakeholders, and intends to sustain and further deepen these to help achieve core results under 
the new CAS.  At the policy level, the Bank will continue to draw on its strong convening power in 
the Philippines through support of the PDF, which is chaired by the Government and co-chaired by the 
World Bank. The PDF is recognized by the multistakeholder participants as an effective forum for 
facilitating dialogue on critical policy reforms as well as for providing an overall framework for 
partnerships not just with the Government but among other PDF players. As the co-chair of the PDF, 
the Bank will continue to ensure the effectiveness of the PDF process , and will continue to be an 

34 

 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

active co-convener or participant in all of the eight PDF working groups whose thematic areas cut 
across all the new CAS strategic objectives. 

115. At the program level, the World Bank Group continues to be a key player in the 
Philippines and intends to sustain this position in the next CAS.  Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) in the Philippines as of end calendar year 2008 was at the level of US$9.7 billion. Together, 
Japan, ADB and the World Bank provide approximately 75 percent of total ODA.  Japan’s share is 43 
percent, while the World Bank and ADB have equal shares of 16 percent each. Within the context of 
the ODA composition in the country, partnerships with other players will continue to be an important 
element of the strategy.  (See Annex 7 on the mapping of development partners’ programs.) 

116. At the operational level, scaling up of existing partnerships with various stakeholders 
will be a key element of the strategy.  The Bank will pursue complementarity of our lending 
programs with those of ADB and Japan, the two other large ODA contributors in the country, in areas 
of common interest.  Cofinancing with multilateral as well as bilateral agencies will be explored 
particularly for large program loans.  As a specialized member of the United Nations, the Bank will 
continue to cooperate with the UN country team on addressing the MDGs and other common 
activities. In portfolio monitoring, the Bank will continue to collaborate with ADB and JICA through 
the government-led country portfolio review to harmonize and align processes among development 
partners and government agencies. 

117. The operational collaboration with other international and national development 
partners has been strengthened through the establishment and implementation of jumbo trust 
funds administered by the Bank in recent years, and will be continued under the new CAS.  The 
Bank Group’s close partnership with Australia, whose program in the Philippines has increased 
significantly in the last two years, is especially significant. A number of externally financed outputs 
with AusAID financing were activated in FY09, and a new country level programmatic trust fund is 
expected to be activated soon. The European Commission (EC) is another close partner of the Bank in 
the Philippines, with two ongoing jumbo trust funds for the health sector, one specifically focused on 
Mindanao.  Under its governance and anticorruption initiatives, the Bank will seek active partnerships 
with JICA and ADB and with the Government on harmonization of procedures on procurement, and a 
new set of coordination on financial management activities with the Government. The Bank will also 
pursue partnerships with CIDA, Spain, and other interested partners on a proposed multidonor trust 
fund on Decentralization and Local Government.  The Bank will continue to implement the first phase 
of the multidonor trust fund for Mindanao, which includes contributions from Australia, Canada, EC, 
Sweden, New Zealand, and the United States and which has focused on capacity building in the local 
post-conflict communities of Mindanao.  Annex 8 contains the list of the major World Bank-managed 
Trust Funds in the Philippines. 

118. A network of strong partnerships is critical to delivering not only Bank lending, but the 
knowledge agenda as well.  In partnership with other development partners, the World Bank Group 
will increasingly emphasize knowledge cooperation and formalize a rolling AAA program with the 
Government.  The country team will also proactively pursue new partnerships and trust funds to 
mobilize additional resources and expertise for the Philippines country program. 

119. The Philippines is known to have an active and vibrant civil society, and the Bank 
recognizes the potential partnerships this offers.  Building on the consultations conducted for this 
CAS, the Bank will enhance its existing partnerships with CSOs at the project level, as well as on the 
knowledge agenda, through more informal but regular dialogues with think-tanks and academe on 
current policy issues.  The Bank will strategically use the eleven Knowledge for Development Centers 
around the country for policy dialogue at the local levels and with the local CSOs.  The Bank will 
continue to support specific themes under the CAS (e.g., inclusive growth) through the Panibagong 
Paraan program (Development Marketplace) on a bi-annual basis by providing small grants to a broad 
range of civil society groups, local governments and grassroots organizations.  The next Panibagong 
Paraan may be held in FY10.

120. Looking ahead, there is scope for closer collaboration and synchronized efforts in several 
new areas being supported under the CAS, including on global issues such as climate change 
adaptation and disaster risk management.  The Bank Group will continue to expand ongoing 
partnerships and explore new activities with global programs such as the Public-Private Infrastructure 
Advisory Facility (PPIAF), Global Environment Facility (GEF) , Water and Sanitation Program, 
Carbon Finance Funds, Monteral Protocol, Cities Alliance, and others.  On the global economic crisis, 
closer collaboration with local and global partners will be needed with the expected higher levels of 
lending and advisory services, including continued close coordination with the IMF on the assessment 
of macroeconomic policies and conditions.   

Mainstreaming Gender  

121. The Bank Group will continue to ensure that gender considerations are mainstreamed 
into operations, consistent with government policy.  Development partners are required by the 
Government to report annually on how they mainstream gender into their programs, and a government 
report is prepared in conjunction with the Philippines Development Forum, the country’s main aid 
coordination vehicle.  The Bank’s portfolio in the Philippines is being continuously monitored as part 
of regular Gender and Development (GAD) assessments by the Government. The Bank Group will 
continue to support this process through the Gender Focal Person , designated to champion the focus 
on gender issues in the Bank’s program and to participate in the Government-led GAD network, and 
other mechanisms already in place.  See further details on gender mainstreaming and harmonization in 
Annex 9. 

122. Going forward, the CAS will support the Philippines in the promotion of gender equality 
as part of the Government’s commitment to the Millennium Declaration.  The target of 
eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and all levels of 
education not later than 2015, is projected to be reached or even surpassed by the Philippines. Hence, 
the main challenge for the Philippines is to ensure that the development programs already in place, as 
well as new ones, will continue to support this positive trend in reaching the specific MDG on gender 
equality.  The 2008 Joint Country Gender Assessment14 also identified the following major GAD 
challenges/agenda: (i) policy support for alternative social protection mechanisms/services; (ii) 
increased investment for more inclusive education; (iii) passage of policies and increased services on 
reproductive health; (iv) coordinated response to address gender-based violence; and (v) sharpening 
gender lens of disaster management.  Specific IBRD  projects that will be started or continued under 
the CAS that respond to the emerging GAD challenges include: 

 The National Program Support for Basic Education involves alternative delivery 
modes to achieve gender-balanced education. 

 The National Program Support for Health Sector Reform promotes maternal health 
care that seeks to reduce maternal mortality rate. 

 The Mindanao Trust Fund-Reconstruction and Development Project (MTF-RDP) 
undertakes various initiatives on gender and peace building work such as implementation 
of Female Functional Literacy program; engagement of NGOs on GAD in conflict 
communities through a small-grant facility, and the training of trainers on gender and 
peace building.  These types of activities will continue as the program extends into this 
CAS period. 

 The Second Mindanao Rural Development Program and Second Agrarian Reform 
Community Development Project involves economic empowerment of women in 
agrarian reform communities.

 The Community-Driven Development or KALAHI-CIDSS Project promotes women’s 
empowerment through participation in the planning and decision-making in "barangay" 
(local district) governance, and developing their capacity to design, implement, and 
manage development activities that reduce poverty.  

 The Social Welfare and Development Reform Project (Conditional Cash Transfers) 
will contribute to economic empowerment of women since the expected recipients of the 
actual cash transfers in the targeted households are the mothers, who are assumed to take a 
more hands-on approach to the health and education needs of the children.  

IV.    MANAGING RISKS 

123. 
Political risks.  The FY10-12 CAS for the Philippines will be implemented during a period 
fraught with considerable risks that may undermine its results, or at the least, affect outcomes in an 
adverse way.  Among them, political risks feature very prominently as the CAS will be implemented 
in a period of elections and government transition that could influence commitment to the ongoing 
program and continuity, as well as ownership and buy-in for the proposed future program.  However, 
the elections will also put pressure for delivering results, especially in areas such as governance, 
community development, social protection, infrastructure, and investment climate.  Elections could 
also open up political space for reforms as new leaders with new mandates form their agendas.  The 
CAS will position the Bank Group to best support the preparation of the next MTPDP and to suggest 
ways for addressing key development challenges that the country faces. 

124. Conflict in Mindanao.  There is an ongoing risk that development gains made may be eroded 
by spikes in violent conflict despite a ceasefire.  Government agencies may be constrained in 
implementing a common framework for peace and development in Mindanao.  Sufficient resources 
from the Government may not be forthcoming for scaling up of basic services in Mindanao, especially 
in conflict-affected areas, which will threaten the sustainability of assistance.  Development partners, 
including the Bank Group, will have to commit to work on stability and peace for the long haul and 
stay the course as much as possible.  While the prevention of spikes in violent conflict and peace 
negotiations are beyond the bounds of the Bank's program, a number of steps will be taken to mitigate 
direct risks and support an environment conducive to peace.  During the CAS period, the Bank will 
increase the sophistication of its security and risk analysis, including through the establishment of a 
conflict monitoring database that will track conflict incidence and typology.  The conflict sensitivity of 
Bank-financed projects will be enhanced by increasing attention on strengthening community 
cohesion and equity in the distribution of resources in conflict-affected areas. 

125. Vulnerability to the external environment, external shocks, and changes in investor 
sentiment.  The Philippines, as all other open developing countries, is being affected by the ongoing 
global recession and continuing deep financial turmoil.  Three key sources of uncertainty are the 
impact of the global environment on remittances, exports, and the fiscal sector. So far, remittance 
flows have held up well, reaching about US$16 billion in 2008 (about 10 percent of GDP).  The 
geographical distribution of overseas Filipino workers is relatively well diversified; nonetheless, the 
US still accounts for 33 percent of total overseas workers and 68 percent of permanent overseas 
workers, and the slowdown in the US economy will have a negative impact.  Exports, on the other 
hand, contracted by 2.9 percent in 2008 as key electronics exports plummeted by a third. The 
composition of Philippines’ exports has changed significantly since the early 1990s, and is now 
heavily skewed towards machinery and transport equipment, particularly high-tech exports.  While the 
high-tech industry has its own sector dynamics, demand is relatively income elastic and sensitive to 
global growth conditions.  Also, while China’s rise has provided opportunities for exports in its own 
market, it has also heightened competitive pressures and cut into the Philippines’ exports shares. The 
recent increase in private capital inflows has included sizable portfolio flows which are sensitive to 
cyclical factors and global downturns. FDI flows, which are less affected by short-term cyclical 
factors, are still relatively low. Finally, concerns about falling tax effort, large and rising public sector 

37 

 
 
 
FY10-12 Country Assistance Strategy for the Philippines                           

April 2, 2009 

gross financing needs for 2009 and 2010,15 and the potential for fiscal risks to materialize in a 
downturn could trigger a reassessment of the country’s fiscal sustainability and affect overall 
confidence in the economy. These vulnerabilities underline the need for prudent macroeconomic 
management, including robust fiscal and financial policies which ensure continued growth, reduce 
poverty, and protect the vulnerable. In case of a sharper-than-expected deterioration in the economy, 
the World Bank Group stands ready to use IFC crisis facilities, and IBRD financing for quick 
disbursing budget support within the broad parameters of the CAS lending range.  The CAS would 
continue to focus on assisting the Government address fiscal and external vulnerabilities through a 
continuation of its policy advice to the Government on tax policy and administration and on a more 
timely manner, strengthening the design and implementation of the tax reform project, and constant 
dialogue with the Government on managing fiscal and financial risks. To improve data collection and 
reporting, the Bank would engage the Government in a program to improve its statistical reporting 
systems beginning with improvements in the country’s system of national accounts to adequately 
measure economic and sectoral performance.   

126. Concerns about continued commitment to the reform agenda.  There are a number of 
areas where the proposed CAS engagements are prone to risks emanating from any possible 
discontinuity or weakening of commitments to the reform agendas, particularly given the upcoming 
election-related transitions.  For example, in the social sectors, it is critical that the reform agendas of 
national agencies, such as the Departments of Education, Health, and Social Welfare, continue to be 
articulated, and there is ownership and commitment for implementation.  Bank support for 
implementation will proceed once there is clarity on the agendas and clear signs of commitment, and 
when projects meet the Bank’s selection and processing filters.  Absence of consensus with the next 
administration and inadequate capacity to implement may weaken the desirable pro-poor focus of the 
MTPDP under the social protection framework.  These concerns will be addressed by early and 
constant coordination with the Government through policy dialogue and AAA, as well as through the 
development of 
framework operationalization 
instruments 
(e.g., 
revisions of planning 
/programming/budgeting guidelines). 

127. Risks posed by weak implementation capacity at the LGUs.  A separate set of risks are 
associated with the various Bank engagements where most of the implementation activities are at the 
LGU level with weak capacities.  Risks also arise from the often weak institutional framework 
governing national government management of LGU implementation of programs, and the extent of 
LGU support and cooperation.  The absence of an appropriate incentive and sanction regime raises the 
risk whether LGUs will buy into the performance monitoring scheme being proposed for social sector 
service delivery, and the monitoring indicators will need to be vetted properly.  The management 
capacities of CSOs also need addressing.  The Bank will mitigate the risks of local-level capture of 
public resources (including development assistance) by enhancing emphasis on transparency and 
participation in its lending operations, especially by scaling up these measures in some of the CDD 
operations, while also investing in development of transparency enhancing measures such as local -
level citizens' scorecards and service delivery impact evaluations.  The Bank is providing an IDF for 
the reform of the Local Government Academy (LGA) aiming at changing its role from service 
provider to broker of capacity building services that LGUs can access.  

128. 
Possible impediments to implementing disaster risk management mechanisms.  The 
Philippines is particularly vulnerable to frequent and devastating natural disasters, and the proposed ex 
ante and ex post mitigation and management mechanisms need to be carefully designed and 
implemented.  Earlier efforts to support the reform of risk finance tools and instruments were not fully 
successful and the Government may still be reluctant to introduce options outlined in the disaster risk 
finance strategy.  The possible inability to effect legislative changes required to modern ize DRM 

15 Gross public sector financing needs are projected to increase from 15.7 percent of GDP in 2008  to 18.5 
percent of GDP in 2009 and 19.7 in 2010.

April 2, 2009 

systems, lack of LGU buy-in to financing DRM activities, and the unwillingness of the national 
government to establish financing mechanisms for LGUs, are also to be considered.  The Bank will 
support the Government’s efforts to reduce disaster risk, by developing and rolling out a program of 
capacity development assistance to highly vulnerable LGUs; and developing financing facilities to 
enable LGUs prepare for and mitigate disaster risk.  In addition, the Bank will support the preparation 
of a disaster risk finance strategy to help the Government put in place appropriate insurance and risk 
transfer schemes. 

129. Risks concerning implementation of governance reforms.  The centrality of the CAS 
support for the Government’s governance reform agenda raises some risks.  A major source of risk is 
the concern that the new administration may choose to emphasize a new set of priorities and under -
invest in the ongoing reforms.  In particular, in the run-up to the elections there might be a shift to 
lower priority, politically-driven projects within the context of more relaxed fiscal discipline.  Public -
private partnerships have their own governance problems arising from the opportunities for special 
deals awarded to politically favored clients, and the impact of such negotiations on the preparation of 
bankable projects.  Another high risk area is tax administration reform, where there are signs of 
capture by various vested interests, and it is uncertain that the new administration will be able to push 
it much more aggressively.  In other governance reform areas, it is possible that key stakeholders will 
not be able to form a shared view on reform priorities or, worse yet, fragmentation and factionalism 
may stymie joint actions.  Efforts to promote better local governance could be frustrated by clientelist 
politics at the local level.  Demanding good governance in some areas, especially those in conflict 
areas and areas where powerful clans dominate politics, may be seen by communities as a low-reward 
high-risk activity.  Targeting poverty programs in conflict-affected areas also has its own risks.  The 
proposed engagements under the cross-cutting theme of good governance in the strategy, together with 
the implementation measures to operationalize governance (e.g., ―Governance Filters‖) and the 
systematic efforts to increase transparency, accountability and participation at both national and local 
levels, including through fostering partnerships with CSOs, form the core of the mitigation approach 
to risks concerning implementation of governance reforms.

Poverty, Inequality and Progress toward the MDGs  

Progress and Challenges in Achieving MDGs 

1. 
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide an important reference point for 
achieving the Philippines’ objectives with regards to human development outcomes.  Halfway 
through the 2015 target of achieving the MDGs, the Philippines has made considerable progress in 
some goals, particularly in poverty reduction, nutrition, gender equality, reducing infant and child 
mortality, water supply and sanitation, and combating AIDS and other diseases (see Annex A2). 1 
However, in addition to slow progress in reducing income poverty, there has been mixed progress in 
addressing the non-income dimensions of poverty in the Philippines, particularly as they relate to 
human development outcomes.  More specifically, the Philippines needs to intensify its efforts to 
achieve lagging key social MDG targets, especially universal access to primary education, maternal 
mortality, and reproductive health services, and address the uneven progress at the local level.  

2. 
The Philippines remains on-track in halving poverty by 2015, but must step up efforts to 
preserve the gains it achieved in the past two decades.  The incidence of poverty and the poverty 
gap ratio have been reduced significantly over the years.  From about half of the population two 
decades ago, the proportion of the population living below the national poverty line has now gone 
down to a third.  At this rate, the Philippines may well be on its way to achieving its target of reducing 
national poverty to 22.7 percent of the population by 2015.  However, the recent increase in poverty 
would require a more progressive approach from the Government to preserve the gains it realized in 
the past two decades and to maintain, if not accelerate, the pace of reducing poverty moving forward. 

3. 
Clear gains have been made in reducing infant and child mortality, as well as mortality 
from tuberculosis and other diseases.  Infant and under-five mortality rates have also declined 
considerably.  From 80 deaths per thousand live births in 1990, under-five mortality in 2006 fell to 31. 
Infant mortality was also reduced from 57 per thousand live births in 1990 to 23 in 2006.  
Improvements in the immunization program of the Government, however, are needed to hasten the 
pace of progress in increasing the proportion of 1-year old children protected against measles.  
Prevalence rates of tuberculosis (TB) and other diseases have also remained within target.  While TB 
remains a major public health concern, being the sixth leading cause of death in 20032, the prevalence 
of TB was nearly halved since 1990. Through the Government’s re-energized National TB Control 
Program, case detection and cure rates for TB increased to 63 percent and 82 percent in 2006 from 53 
percent and 73 percent in 2001, respectively. Similarly, prevalence of malaria declined to a quarter of 
its level in 1990 and deaths controlled to three persons for every million from 15 in 1990.  The 
prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV and 
AIDS) based on recorded cases has been kept below 1 percent of the population3. 

4. 
Access to safe drinking water and sanitation has also improved.  Based on the latest 
Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (2004), access to safe drinking water increased to 80.2 percent from 
73 percent in 1990, while the incidence of using sealed water and closed pit toilet facilities increased 
to 86.2 percent from 67.6 percent in 1990.  However, at the current pace of development the 
Philippines is unlikely to meet the MDG targets for water supply.

5. 
Meanwhile, efforts to meet the MDGs are challenged by poor performance in key 
education and health targets: 

 

 

In education, net enrolment rate (NER) at the elementary level has been declining since 2002 
and moving farther away from meeting the MDG target. At the secondary level, NER barely 
improved between 2006 and 2007 and remained low at 58-60 percent in the last five years.  
Completion rates in both elementary and secondary levels have also been on the decline since 
2002 until a reversal in 2006, but still remains low and far from achieving the target of 81 
percent by 2015.  The quality of education has also been deteriorating.  Overall achievement 
rate for the elementary level has remained low at 59.9 percent in 2006 while it remained 
stagnant at 45 percent at the secondary level.   

In health, maternal health is considered to be the goal least likely to be achieved by the 
Philippines by 2015. Despite the decline from 209 per hundred thousand live births in 1990 to 
162 per hundred thousand in 2006, maternal mortality remains higher than in neighboring 
countries4.  Latest health surveys revealed that while 88 percent of mothers received prenatal 
check-ups, only 66 percent received postnatal care and only a few obtained complete care.  
The low incidence of contraceptive usage and the resulting high population growth also 
contribute to the low likelihood of meeting the MDG target on maternal health.  As of 2006, 
only half of married women of reproductive age use contraceptives and practice family 
planning while the unmet need for family planning was at 15.7 percent, reflecting the need to 
scale up efforts to provide universal access to reproductive health education and information.  
Meanwhile, immunization rates are not close to universal, improving only marginally in the 
last two decades.  Malnutrition also remains a major issue, especially among school children.  
In 2006, malnutrition incidence was at 21 percent of children in public elementary schools. 

6. 
Across the various regions, human development outcomes vary significantly.  Most of the 
lagging regions are in Mindanao while those which have been progressing are in Luzon.  Consistently 
on-track in almost all the regions were targets on poverty, infant and child mortality rates, access to 
safe drinking water, and sanitation.  Meanwhile, consistently off-track were indicators of primary 
participation and survival, maternal mortality, and contraceptive prevalence.  This is reflected by wide 
geographical disparities in the availability of good schools.  Latest data on teacher distribution across 
schools and regions show the difficulty of attracting good teachers to schools that serve poor, 
backward areas and schools that have few resources.  Meanwhile, latest surveys on health showed that 
while more than 85 percent of births in NCR and Central Luzon were attended by a skilled health 
professional, less than 30 percent of births were similarly attended in the ARMM and MIMAROPA 
regions.  There is a need for investing further in service delivery in lagging or poorer regions.  
Reaching the poor requires geographic targeting of supply-side interventions in areas where the poor 
live. 

7. 
The key challenge is to improve the efficiency in the use of the increasing budgets for 
education and health, and other social sectors.  Between 2004 and 2008, the real budget of the 
Department of Education increased by 6 percent and that of the Department of Health by 18 percent 
(CPBD 2007).  Nevertheless, government spending in basic education and health remains way below 
that of other developing countries5.   In education, interventions addressing declining net enrolment 
rates, high dropout and low completion rates, and poor transition rates between the two levels of 
education, need to be prioritized.  In health, budget allocations need to be prioritized for investing in 

4  For instance, Thailand is at 110 per 100,000 live births while Malaysia is at 62, China at 45, and Vietnam at 
150 (Source: www.unicef.org). 
5 Developing countries spend about 4 to 6 percent of GDP on education and 3 percent on health, while the 
Philippines only spends about 2.5 percent of GDP and 0.3 percent on education and health, respectively.

health facilities and professionals who will attend to mothers during delivery.  The emphasis on 
governance and public expenditure reforms is the right one.  An important challenge will be to find 
effective ways of devolving further responsibility to local governments who share the responsibility 
for health and education outcomes with the national government. 

8. 
To the extent that the poor find it hard to afford schooling and health care, targeted 
demand-side interventions to increase the ability of the poor to access health and education will 
also be key.  On this front, several demand-side transfer programs have already been initiated by the 
Government, including the Food-for-School Program and the PhilHealth Indigent Program aimed at 
subsidizing health insurance of poor households. The operationalization and effectiveness of these 
programs, however, have been compromised by a lack of a good targeting mechanism. Indeed, 
improved targeting of the poor is critical to the efficiency of using public funds for poverty reduction 
and attainment of key MDGs.  The conditional cash transfer (CCT) program (Pantawid Pamilyang 
Pilipino Program or 4Ps) that is currently being designed by the Government with several attractive 
dimensions, including adopting a targeting system of poor households based on a proxy means test 
that can also be used by other programs, shows promise. 

9. 
The attainment of the MDG outcomes depends critically on the ability of the central 
government to work in close coordination with local government units and communities.  
Ongoing reform agendas in key national agencies need to focus on interventions that also integrate 
community-driven development (CDD) tools and involve communities in their design.  Indeed, 
targeted demand side interventions, including CDD tools and increased access to information, will 
increase the ability of poor households to demand and access health care and education services and 
will trigger improved delivery of public services to the poor.  The availability of a functional 
information system that can provide timely and accurate data on the performance of LGUs and of 
national agencies is similarly important, as is building up local capacities. 

Inequality in Access to Basic Services 

10. 
Large inequalities in access to basic infrastructure services persist.  Wide income 
disparities at the sub-national level reflect the uneven access to vital infrastructure and human 
capabilities.  Least prosperous regions, mostly areas in Mindanao, have the least access to 
infrastructure and basic services while areas where economic activity is concentrated and poverty rates 
are lower have better access to such services (Table 1).  As of 2006, 30 percent of those living in the 
Mindanao regions remain without access to electricity compared to 11.2 percent among regions in 
Luzon.  Yet even within Luzon, large variations in access to electricity exist. More recent data also 
show that even within areas covered by electrical cooperatives in the country, about one-third of 
households remain without access6. Same is true for access to water, communication facilities, and 
good roads.  

11. 
Educational gaps between poor and non-poor areas and between poor and non-poor 
families likewise persist, in terms of children’s access to schools of good quality and other inputs, 
as well as in terms of outcomes7.  Visits to schools in poor areas reveal basic supply shortages.  In 
poor, overcrowded urban areas, pupil-teacher ratios are as high as 1:80 in many NCR schools8, and 
school shifts are too short (three to four class shifts in highly urbanized areas such as in NCR, Cebu 
and CALABARZON).  In poor rural areas, many students sit in classrooms without the rudiments of 
instruction, including a teacher who has mastered the curriculum.  In health, the latest National 
Demographic and Health Survey showed that while more than 85 percent of births in National Capital

Weak Response of Poverty Reduction to Growth and Increased Vulnerabilities 

12. 
The weak response of poverty reduction to growth and increased vulnerabilities are key 
challenges that the Philippines faces.  Government estimates reveal that 45 percent of all Filipinos 
are vulnerable to falling into poverty due to shocks, particularly those related to financial crises, 
health, unemployment, natural disasters, civil unrest, and prices that are likely to throw vulnerable 
households into poverty, and increase the severity of poverty among those already in poverty.  For 
example, it is estimated that the 18 percent increase in prices of all food items by July 2007 may have 
increased poverty by 3.6 percentage points, equivalent to about 3 million people. 

13. 
Understanding the underlying causes of poverty and how the poor can better benefit 
from growth are critical questions for the Philippines.  The World Bank, along with other partners, 
has embarked on a study to further analyze the nature and causes of recent poverty and to assess how 
growth could result in greater reductions in poverty.  While more careful analysis is required, there are 
several apparent factors that drove the increase in poverty in recent years.

 First, the increase in the poverty headcount in 2006 has been partly caused by a fall in real 
income of households.  While nominal income rose by 17.5 percent between 2003 and 2006, 
cumulative inflation in the period was higher at 21.1 percent.  In particular, cumulative food 
inflation of 19.3 percent was more than double the cumulative food inflation of 9.5 percent in 
2000-2003.  These translated into falling average real income for all deciles.  Average real 
family income declined by 3.7 percent between 2003 and 2006, while average family 
expenditures declined by 2.4 percent.  Efforts aimed at increasing incomes and opportunities 
for the poor, while maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, will be key to poverty 
reduction. 

 Second, the fiscal crisis would also have contributed to higher poverty between 2003 and 
2006.  The Government had an unsustainable budget deficit by 2002 and consolidated public 
sector debt exceeded 100 percent of GDP the following year9.  As revenues had been falling in 
real terms since 1997, the Government had no recourse but to compress spending.  At the 
same time, the share of interest payment increased from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2000 to 5 
percent between 2003 and 2006.  Consequently, both capital and social spending fell 
significantly.  The enhanced delivery of social services to the poor, both through increased 
spending in sectors that are important to the poor as well as improved accountability and 
service delivery by the public sector, will also be critical to reducing poverty in the context of 
the current fiscal situation. 

 Third, there are also indications that the quality of growth has not favored poverty 
reduction.  While growth averaged 5.4 percent between the conduct of the FIES in 2003 and 
2006, GDP by factor shares of institutions shows that growth accrued largely to the corporate 
sector which grew by 27.7 percent on average over the three years (in nominal terms).  In 
contrast, the household sector grew by only 3.6 percent on average over these years.  
Consequently, the share of the corporate sector to GDP increased from 43 percent to 55 
percent, while households’ share to total GDP fell from 47 percent to 37 percent. 

 Fourth, the pattern of growth creates insufficient jobs for the low-skilled labor the poor are 
relying on.  Sector GDP growth, and consequently employment growth, was largest in 
services, especially in financial services and business processing services, for which the poor’s 
education levels often fall short.  Agriculture has been growing at 4 percent in recent years, 
but without creating many additional jobs, as labor is not the constraining factor in that sector.  
Growth in manufacturing industry and employment, often a pathway out of poverty for low-
skilled labor in other countries, remained modest in the Philippines because of constrain ts in 
the investment climate.   

14. Most poor households in the Philippines are also susceptible to shocks driven by climate 
change and natural disasters.  Many of the poor live in naturally hazard-prone areas and are largely 
dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods.  Being an archipelagic country with a tropical 
climate, the Philippines is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, including 
increases in the frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, typhoons; alteration of agricultural and 
coastal marine ecosystem output and productivity; reduction of water availability and quality; and 
increases in the incidence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases.  The progression of climate change 
has accelerated the susceptibility of the country to natural disasters and underscores the need to start 
adapting to this phenomenon. 

15. 
The effectiveness of social protection and poverty reduction efforts is severely 
compromised by the lack of an accurate and legitimate system to target poor households.  There 
is also a lack of policy and institutional coordination and capacity in the broad area of social

protection, as well as disaster management.  Different targeting schemes are being used for different 
programs and have relied on faulty targeting systems which resulted in high leakage rates to the non-
poor and under-coverage of the poor.  Conflicting provisions of various laws and their implementing 
rules and regulations and the overlapping mandates of agencies have hampered the effectiveness of 
government action in these areas.  This has been compounded by the lack of clarity in the mandates 
and responsibilities, or actual functions, of national versus local government in the provision of 
services related to reducing risks, including those of social protection and disaster risk management, as 
well as poverty reduction in general. 

Challenges in Conflict-Affected Areas in Mindanao 

16. 
In Mindanao, the intermittent conflict between government forces and separatist groups 
has been ongoing for more than three decades.  It has resulted in the destruction of infrastructure, 
population displacements, deferred development, and lack of trust among people at the local level and 
between these and government authorities.  There is a consensus among Filipino policymakers and the 
public that political instability and/or absence of peace in parts of Mindanao are major impediments 
for the island to attain its full development potential. 

17. Mindanao has two faces:  the growth centers and the lagging areas in conflict-affected 
communities.  The former exhibit relatively healthy economic performance, and by doing so, have 
become the island’s centers of manufacturing, trade and commerce.  However, they are far from their 
potential of high growth.  On the other hand, the latter demonstrate an underdeveloped and stagnating 
economy caused largely by the persistent conflict and neglect that have made them lagging areas.  
Most of the conflict-affected areas, as listed by the Government of the Philippines and the Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) Peace Negotiating Panels, are also located in the poorest regions in 
Mindanao.  These regions are: the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), Western 
Mindanao, and Central Mindanao.  The ARMM and Western Mindanao have the highest percentage of 
poor among their respective population, with about 70 percent and a little under 50 percent 
respectively; Central Mindanao has over 40 percent. 

18. 
The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has the poorest human 
development outcomes among the 16 regions in the Philippines.  Poverty incidence is twice that of 
the nation as a whole.  Life expectancies for men and women are more than 10 years below the 
national rates.  Infant and maternal mortality are 30 percent and 80 percent higher than the national 
rates.  And net primary and secondary enrolment rates are 14 and 33 percentage points lower than the 
national rates.10 

19. Many development partners are operating in Mindanao such as USAID, AusAID, CIDA, 
JICA, ADB, EU, and the World Bank Group.  Most of them are engaged in implementing small 
and community-based infrastructure, social development and livelihood projects.  Although such 
projects are valuable in rebuilding trust and confidence among community members, and within and 
among communities, the positive gains of such engagement need to be translated into sustainable 
livelihood activities that will provide employment and decent incomes to residents of conflict-affected 
and poor communities.  The short-term initiatives need to be linked to medium and long-term plans in 
order to achieve sustained growth and development of Mindanao in general and of the conflict -
affected areas in particular.

Governance Challenges, Opportunities and Risks 

The Governance Challenge 

1. 
The Government has recognized the governance challenges as obstacles to development 
and in its MTPDP (2004-2010) diagnosed various dimensions of poor governance.  The Plan 
candidly assessed the governance situations at the beginning of the current presidential term, covering 
a range of topics from corruption as a threat to development, the government institutions’ lack of 
capacities and integrity as well as their capture by vested interests, and even certain aspects of the 
constitutional structure which were seen to hamper efficient and coherent decision-making and 
coordinated policy implementation (Box 1). 

Box 1: Governance Assessments in the MTPDP 2004-2010 

On corruption (Chapter 21):  Graft and corruption are increasingly viewed as threats to the sustained growth 
and development of the country. Corruption distorts access to services for the poor, results in government’s poor 
performance and, consequently, low public confidence in government. The culture of corruption in the country 
breeds the vicious cycles of poverty and underdevelopment. 
On the need for bureaucratic reform (Chapter 22): 
• The independence, capacities and integrity of government institutions are not enough to provide quality and 
efficient public services. Regulatory capture works as powerful brakes on various government initiatives, 
eroding their effectiveness and sustainability. The bureaucracy is largely perceived to be beholden to vested 
interests which interfere in the bureaucracy’s functioning, rendering it unable to perform its functions and 
undertake its programs unhampered. The entrenched system of patronage and payback in the political 
landscape is the source of such particularistic interests. 
• The institutional design, systems and processes of government pose a challenge on the quality of public 
goods and services. A number of factors impinge on this quality; these are: (a) redundant, duplicating and 
overlapping programs/activities, (b) diffused resources to nonessential undertakings, (c) uncoordinated 
policy and program implementation, (d) poor sector management, (e) proliferation of special task bodies or 
interagency committees, (f) ineffective performance management system, and (g) highly politicized 
bureaucracy. 
• Despite previous efforts to trim the bureaucracy, the Government is still weighed down by unclear 
delineation and overlapping of functions. This results in high transaction costs internalized by government, 
business, nongovernment organizations and the general public as a result of poor coordination in policy and 
program implementation, weak sector management and wastage of resources. 
• The perception of a “bloated” bureaucracy lies not only in the distribution of government employees in 
terms of national vis-à-vis the local government units (LGUs), but also its maintenance cost. Neighboring 
Asian countries have higher government personnel ratios, but they deploy greater number of civil servants to 
local areas and frontline services. The other issue is more of efficiency and cost. 
On the country’s constitutional structure and its effects on governance (Chapter 25): 
• The country’s political institutions have become less effective to address problems under the present 
presidential setup. The separation of powers and checks and balances between the Executive and Legislative 
branches often result in delays in legislation and policymaking. The Executive has to resort to compromise 
and concession to pass the annual appropriations bill and the other major initiatives. But even when good 
legislation is passed, it may suffer from execution problems because of the lack of legislative support to 
impose or raise taxes that are needed for its implementation. National policymaking has come to depend on 
the lowest-common-denominator of agreement among Executive and Legislative branches of the

Government. 
• The national government remains highly centralized, slow and unresponsive to the needs of the people in the 
rural areas and cultural communities. Although local governments are supposed to enjoy local autonomy 
under the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code, they are in fact controlled in many ways by 
the national government on which many of them have become habitually dependent for guidance and 
resources. This inhibits local initiative and resourcefulness to effect progress and development within their 
territories and communities.

2. 
The importance of addressing the governance challenges as noted in the MTPDP was 
echoed in the CAS consultations and in the Bank’s 2008 Global Poll 1 .  In the Global Poll, the 
Philippines is the only country in East Asia where “improving governance” was identified as the most 
important means to generate faster growth.  It is also the only country in the region where “improving 
governance” was mentioned as one of the top two priorities for poverty reduction.  Similar messages 
were received in the series of consultations on the CAS formulation and the FY09 Client Survey (see 
Annex 4).   

Government Responses 

3. 
The MTPDP included corresponding reform goals, strategies and action plans.  For 
anticorruption, the Government’s priorities included turning the BIR and the BOC, two agencies with 
the highest perceived levels of corruption according to local polls, as “showcases in the fight against 
graft and corruption”, conducting comprehensive corruption risk assessments (Integrity Development 
Reviews) in government agencies to devise agency-specific anticorruption action plans, and 
strengthening the investigative capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman, modeling it after Hong 
Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).  To improve the incentives and the 
capabilities of the government bureaucracy to perform its functions effectively, the Plan aimed to 
rationalize functions and organizations of government agencies, professionalize the public service 
through pay reforms and introduction of performance management systems, and institutionalize merit-
based promotion as a means to ensure the bureaucracy’s independence from political influence.  
Finally, the Plan proposed constitutional changes and called for legislating ways to enforce the 
constitutional prohibition of “dynasties” (i.e., clans and families which dominate local politics in given 
geographic areas), which are widely seen as a source of corruption and clientelism. 

4. 
Following this ambitious agenda, the Government launched a number of reforms. While 
some programs are yet to yield notable results, others have achieved partial results to date, such as the 
government-launched innovative anticorruption program called the Revenue Integrity Protection 
Service (RIPS) which intends to control corruption in the revenue agencies and the conduct of 
Integrity Development Reviews in 17 national government agencies.  In January 2009, the 
Government launched Oplan Kandado (Operation Padlock) which aims to strictly enforce 
administrative sanctions for non-compliance by taxpayers. As reported by Government, this program 
has started yielding good feedback and promising outcomes in terms of compelling taxpayers to abide 
by the rules, thereby generating revenue. 

5. 
To enhance performance of the bureaucracy, the Government initiated a government-
wide agency rationalization program in 2003.  This is a long-term reform program, and to date, 

1 The 2008 World Bank Global Poll was carried out in 42 countries, covering 2,611 “opinion leaders” from 
government, media, academe, private sector and NGO/CSOs.  For the Philippines, 60 phone interviews and 16 
web interviews formed the basis for the data collected.

relatively few national government agencies have actually completed the exercise. Thus its effects on 
improving agency performance have yet to be assessed and firmly established.  The planned civil 
service pay reform requires new legislation.  Several bills for this purpose have been filed but this has 
not yet resulted in a new Salary Standardization Law. 

6. 
While not explicitly highlighted in the MTPDP, reform of the public financial 
management became one of the priorities throughout the Plan period.  Efforts have tended to 
focus on improving the policy base of budgeting and development of organizational performance 
indicators framework (OPIF), which has now been officially adopted in the national budget process. In 
terms of the MTEF, the Government envisions this to be fully institutionalized within the CAS period.  
In contrast, reforms to enhance budget transparency and improve efficiency and accountability in 
budget execution have lagged behind.  The Commission on Audit (COA) developed an electronic 
accounting system (eNGAS) and had started installing them in government agencies some years ago, 
but the roll-out had not been completed in all agencies for various reasons before the COA recently 
announced its suspension due to a policy change.  Follow-through on COA audits and the mandated 
internal audit units in ministries are constrained by limited capacity and personnel. 

7. 
In sum, despite the reforms launched on a variety of fronts, some of which require 
longer-term 
implementation, desired 
improvements 
in governance and public sector 
performance have not yet come about.  The MTPDP agenda of enhancing government institutions’ 
independence, integrity and capacity remains as relevant today as in 2004, and so does the need to 
continue to address systemic causes of corruption as well as appropriate responses to specific cases of 
graft.   

8. 
Given the obstacles to reforms, a strategy for governance reforms needs to go beyond a 
simple call for institutional development and capacity building.  It is necessary that reform efforts 
be guided by sober assessments of the obstacles to reforms as well as judicious identification of 
windows of opportunities. 

Opportunities for Governance Reforms 

9. 
Despite the obstacles to reforms as demonstrated in the difficulties a number of the 
attempted reforms have faced in the recent past, there are positive developments that can 
provide opportunities for incremental governance reforms in the country.  Procurement reform is 
arguably the most coherent and sustained governance reform in the Philippines in the last decade.  The 
reform agenda is clearly articulated and broadly understood and shared among key government 
agencies, civil society groups, and external development partners.  Because a serious procurement 
reform addresses one of the most abused sources of rent seeking, the challenge of fully implementing 
the core elements of the reform cannot be under-estimated.  Against the odds, however, much has been 
accomplished already.  The 2003 Procurement Reform Law is widely considered a sound legal 
framework which unified procurement-related provisions hitherto covered under various 
uncoordinated legal instruments.  The Law includes various provisions intended to increase 
transparency in government procurement processes, using both civil society oversight and increased 
disclosure of procurement information through the electronic procurement system.  Equally important 
is the Law’s role in clarifying and organizing pending reform actions to be implemented by various 
government agencies, with support from CSOs and external development partners.  The Bank has 
played a central role in articulating the reform agenda and tracking its progress through periodic 
country procurement assessments conducted in a participatory manner.  Although the Philippines’ 
procurement system is not yet perfect and procurement-related corruption continues to be uncovered, 
these are considerable achievements by any international standard.  In the Philippine context, having 
coherent reform legislation passed can be a challenge on its own.  However, the case of the 

 
 
 
 
Philippines Governance Challenges and Risks  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 2 
Page 4 of 7 

procurement reform suggests that once such a law is in place it could galvanize reform momentum and 
channel energy and resources in pursuit of clear objectives commonly shared among key stakeholders.  
In this CAS, the Bank’s governance strategy partly relies on this insight and pursues broad-based 
policy dialogue to promote major legislative reforms in a few key areas: public financial management 
and decentralization, as detailed below. 

10. 
Decentralization creates challenges, but also provides additional opportunities for 
improving governance.  Some of the most promising governance innovations have emerged in local 
government units (LGUs) at the provincial, city, and municipal levels.  Despite having to deal with 
often entrenched patronage politics, endemic corruption and poor public service delivery, there are a 
growing number of Governors and Mayors who, as local reform champions, have demonstrated 
leadership and commitment to governance reform and have been successful in improving development 
outcomes.  Success stories come from a wide variety of LGUs and include provinces such as Bohol, 
which has implemented a comprehensive development planning system; cities such as Naga City, 
which has supported transparent and participatory governance, and Marikina City, which has 
promoted managerial innovations (see Box 2); and poverty-stricken municipalities such as Talaignod 
near Davao, Mulanay in southern Quezon, Asipulo in the Cordillera region, Mondragon in Northern 
Samar, Balangiga in Eastern Samar, Pinabacdao in Samar, Juban in Sorsogon and many others that 
have promoted greater citizen’s participation in governance.  Key instruments of Bank support have 
included the City Development Strategy process, LGU support projects, and community-driven 
development programs. 

Box 2: Managerial Innovation in Marikina City 

Marikina City has been a leader in governance reforms and a role model for LGUs.  Its latest innovation 
was the creation of a central warehouse with bar coding system and wide area network (WAN) designed with the 
experience of the best private warehouses as well as leading hardware enterprises in the country.  The objective 
was to enable quick inventory as well as proper and quick release of supplies and materials online to all its 45 
departments – each of which had originally been conducting procurement separately.  The computerized system 
has enabled strategic positioning and priority purchase of fast moving items and allows management to inspect 
the inventory of supplies, while also complying with the procurement law.  It has reduced the number of staff 
involved in supplies management from 135 to 34 and provides a better safeguard against pilferage through closer 
monitoring of materials and even the retrieval of excess materials from completed projects. Hence, wastage has 
been reduced or even eliminated and significant savings realized. 

11. 
Civil society continues to play a critical role in promoting good governance.  The 
Philippines’ most well-known governance “endowment” is its vibrant civil society organizations.  
CSO activism has not only kept problems of governance and corruption high in public awareness but 
has also contributed constructively to strengthening some of the Government’s own reform initiatives.  
This has resulted in some of the best-publicized successes in curbing corruption and increasing 
government accountability such as the mobilization of the Boy Scouts in monitoring delivery of 
textbooks. CSOs are also active in partnering with reform-minded LGUs, providing training to LGU 
officials and serving as a zealous watchdog of public affairs in specific regions or localities. The 
freedom of the press and a free media in the Philippines also have a positive impact on accountability. 

12. 
Replication of promising governance initiatives needs to step up.  A challenge facing both 
CSO activism and local governance innovations is to find a way to replicate and scale up proven or 
promising individual initiatives so that their positive effects can transcend sectoral and geographic 
boundaries.  While local governments such as Marikina and Naga have been sought after as beacons of 
good governance and developed programs for training and transferring knowledge and experience to 
other LGUs, the high degree of geographic and social fragmentation limits the effective reach of 
replication of good practice to a handful of LGUs.  The various leagues of LGUs are playing an 

 
 
 
 
Philippines Governance Challenges and Risks  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 2 
Page 5 of 7 

important role in sharing successful experiences but more needs to be done to spread good practice to 
a greater number of LGUs. 

Relevance of the Proposed Bank Governance Strategy 

13. While continuing to pursue the objective of strengthening government institutions, the 
Bank’s new governance strategy for the Philippines emphasizes systematic efforts to increase 
transparency, accountability and participation at both national and local levels as a cross-
cutting approach.  Taking account of the obstacles and opportunities discussed above, the new 
strategic emphasis takes advantage of the well-known strengths of the Philippine civil society as both 
advocates of governance reforms and partners in the Government’s own good governance initiatives.  
The challenge is considerable, but the perceived relevance of Bank assistance in improving 
governance is high.  Both local stakeholders and the Global Poll respondents expect the Bank to 
address governance issues as a key constraint to development in the Philippines (Table 1).

14. 
Although these perceptions are encouraging, these are obviously not sufficient for 
successful governance reforms.  What is essential is strong political commitment backed by a broad 
consensus on reforms without which reforms will likely remain incremental.  The first two years of the 
CAS period offer an opportunity for building consensus and proposing a clear agenda for governance 
reforms to be pursued by the next administration.  During this period, the Bank will engage a broad 
spectrum of Filipino stakeholders and external development partners to help galvanize drivers of 
change for governance reform so that efforts aimed at building a capable and accountable state are 
more consistent and sustained.  The Bank will pilot nontraditional and innovative approaches to 
promoting and supporting governance reforms, including working with actors outside the Executive 
branch of the national government.

Political Context and Risks Concerning Implementation of Governance Reforms 

15. 
The new CAS will be implemented through a critical period of political transition, as the 
next Philippine general elections are scheduled to be held on May 10, 2010.  All of the elected 
offices at both the national and the local levels, except half of the Senate, are up for elections. 2 

Box 3: The Constitutional Design of the Philippine Political System 

The 1987 Constitution, approved after the removal of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, restored the 
Presidential system with separation of powers among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.  The 
directly elected President is the chief executive with extensive regulatory, administrative and budgetary powers.  
The country's inter-governmental arrangement was defined subsequently in the 1991 Local Government Code 
(LGC) which decentralized considerable powers and administrative responsibilities to the Local Government 
Units (LGUs), which consist of 81 provinces, some 1500 municipalities, 118 cities, and almost 42,000 
Barangays or villages,, the lowest political unit of the country. 
To be elected President requires a plurality among the candidates in a one-round nationwide election.  Presidents 
are elected for one six-year term only; the vice president is elected separately from the president, not as part of 
an election ticket.  Legislation requires the approval of Congress, which consists of a 24-member Senate whose 
members are elected at large for a six-year term, and a 238-member House whose members are elected for a 
three-year term, the vast majority in US-style single-member district voting system and a small minority on the 
basis of a party-list voting system.  At the local level,  provincial, city or municipal chief executives, as well as 
provincial, city and town councils are also up for elections.  Political parties play a minor role in developing 
political platforms and hardly impose party discipline, while “list hopping” from one party to the next is 
common among members of Congress and legislative initiatives often rely on ad-hoc coalitions of individual 
members of congress rather than on party alliances.  The President’s considerable powers in implementing the 
budget are often instrumental in forging such coalitions. 
Provincial governors, city/municipal mayors and barangay captains are directly elected and are overseen by 
elected local councils.  Many LGUs belong to provincial, municipal, and city leagues, which are member 
organizations recognized and institutionalized under the local government code.  Central government has 
deconcentrated limited executive powers to the Regions, which consist of a number of provinces, and to the 
Super Regions, consisting of a collection of Regions.  In many local jurisdictions, politics has for decades been 
dominated by a few families, thus increasing the risk of elite capture. 

16. 
The inherent uncertainty in the electoral process and the tendency for national debates 
to be politicized and the Government to slow down are some of the risks inherent in an electoral 
period.  In addition, an important source of risk is the concern that the new administration may choose 
to emphasize a new set of priorities and under-invest in the ongoing reforms, such as in tax 
administration reform and in other sectors such as  transport and agriculture, where there have been 
recent incidences of corruption scandals.  

17. 
The Bank as well as other international development partners can best promote 
governance reforms in an environment with strong political support and consensus on reforms.  
Although the Bank’s strategy is not to shy away from difficult sectors if these are of strategic 
importance to the CAS objectives, the application of the Governance Filters will reduce the Bank’s 
exposure to high-risk sectors where development outcomes are unlikely to be achieved because of the 
prevailing governance environment.  In such sectors, the Bank will continue to engage in dialogue 
through analytical work (e.g., sector political economy analysis) and support for reform advocacy by 

2 Specifically, these elected offices are the presidency, vice-presidency, half the Senate seats, and all House seats 
at the national level and all the provincial governors’, city/municipal mayors’ and barangay (village) captains’ 
offices as well as provincial, city, municipal and barangay legislatures.

civil society and private sector actors in the country.  In other sectors (e.g., social sectors) where there 
is strong support for reforms, the Bank’s approach is to pursue governance improvements within a 
framework of sector-wide reform agendas with multidonor involvement, as already practiced in health 
(with EU), education (with AusAID), and social safety net (with AusAID). 

18. 
In other governance reform areas, it is possible that key stakeholders will not be able to 
form a shared view on reform priorities.    To mitigate these risks, the CAS proposes to invest in 
multistakeholder engagements on priority governance reform issues with the intent of contributing to 
formation of a solid reform consensus, similar to what the Philippines has been able to establish in the 
area of procurement reform with the Bank’s continued analytical input.   Here, again, selectivity is key 
and hence Bank efforts at reform consensus-building will focus particularly on public financial 
management reform and budget transparency as well as local governance and decentralization, given 
the Bank’s technical expertise and comparative advantage in these areas.  The Bank will mitigate the 
risks of clientelism and local-level capture of public resources (including development assistance) by 
enhancing emphasis on transparency and participation in its lending operations, especially by scaling 
up these measures in some of the CDD operations, while also investing in development of 
transparency enhancing measures such as local-level citizens’ scorecards and service delivery impact 
evaluations.

A. Introduction 

1. 
This report assesses the effectiveness of the Bank’s assistance program to the 
Philippines for FY06-09 and draws lessons learned for incorporation into the new Country 
Assistance Strategy (CAS).  The report is based on the Bank’s CAS for the Philippines (Report 
No. 32141-PH, discussed by the Board on May 17, 2005), and the CAS Progress Report (Report 
No. 40085-PH, June 21, 2007) which expanded the Bank program and extended the CAS to end-
FY09. 

B. Philippine’s Development Objectives 

2. 
The Bank’s 2006 CAS saw the Philippines as a country not living up to its potential.   
The country was endowed with mineral, oil, gas and geothermal potential.  Government, business 
and academe benefited from world class talent.  The Philippines had experienced growth in GDP of 
over 4 percent per annum in real terms since 2001.  But this growth was driven largely by 
consumption, supported by overseas remittances, which raised questions over its sustainability.  
Investment remained low, reflecting investor concerns over perceived corruption, inadequate 
infrastructure, uncertainty and inconsistency in the application of regulations, and the overall cost 
of doing business in the Philippines.  Total factor productivity and per capita GDP growth lagged 
behind other East Asian countries.  Over one quarter of the population remained poor and 
inequality remained high. 

3. 
The Government’s weak fiscal position was seen as a key constraint.  Public debt and 
interest payments had been increasing since the mid-1990s.  In 2003, non-financial public sector 
debt reached 101 percent of GDP and the debt of the national government was nearly five times its 
revenue.  By 2004, national government interest obligations had reached 37 percent of revenue and 
accounted for nearly 30 percent of expenditure.  Tax revenue continued to fall from 17 percent of 
GDP in 1997 to 12 percent in 2004, contributing to the problem.  A continuation of these trends 
was expected to squeeze further government expenditures on infrastructure and social services and 
adversely impact investor confidence and private investment.  Start-up and implementation of Bank 
investment projects were also constrained by a lack of budget and counterpart funding.

4. 
Poor governance was another constraint.  The Philippines compared poorly to other East 
Asian countries in corruption, rule of law, government effectiveness and political stability1.  There 
was a perception that public institutions were captured by special interests and did not necessarily 
work effectively for the common good.  This created a vicious cycle of weak public services, lack 
of trust in the Government, and an unwillingness to provide adequate resources to it.  Poor 
governance limited the effectiveness of public institutions.   

5. 
The Medium Term Philippines Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004-2010 laid out the 
Government’s goals, strategies and action plans for the CAS 2 .  The plan corresponded to 
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s term in office and reflected her priorities - livelihood 
(employment generation), education, fiscal strength, decentralized development, and national 
harmony3.  The plan consisted of five parts: Economic Growth and Job Creation; Energy; Social 
Justice and Basic Needs; Education and Youth; and Anticorruption and Good Governance.  
Addressing the fiscal problem was seen as essential in sustaining and accelerating economic 
growth.  Addressing infrastructure deficiencies, power sector reforms, improving knowledge, 
tackling corruption and simplifying business procedures were expected to promote investment and 
exports which would drive economic growth.  This in turn was expected to create around 10 
million jobs and reduce poverty to 18 percent by 2010.  The plan was comprehensive and did not 
reflect clear priorities which were supported by the budget, limiting its effectiveness.   

C. The Bank Country Assistance Strategy 

6. 
The FY06-08 CAS aimed to support the MTPDP and focused on four strategic areas: 
economic growth, social inclusion, fiscal stability, and improved governance.   It had the 
following objectives4: 

 Achieving fiscal stability to generate resources aimed at spurring growth and raising 
investments in the social and infrastructure sectors; 

 Generating economic growth to accelerate job creation and poverty alleviation; 

 Ensuring social inclusion and the improved delivery of basic services; and 

 

Improving governance. 

7. 
Fiscal stability and improved governance were considered to be two levers which would 
promote economic growth and social inclusion.  Economic growth would create jobs and income 
generation opportunities which would contribute to poverty reduction (although there was a 
concern that high income inequality would lessen the effect of growth on the poor).  More social 
inclusion would empower the poor and enable them to participate in the opportunities afforded by 
economic growth, supported by public spending targeted to the poor .  Fiscal reforms were essential

2 The National Economic and Development Authority, Medium Term Philippines Development Plan 2004-
2010, 2004.  The plan was quite comprehensive and covered 277 pages. 
3 The MTPDP was based on the President’s 10 point agenda which laid out 10 outcomes that she wanted to 
achieve during her term.  
4 The FY06-08 CAS had two objectives (economic growth and social inclusion) and two levers (fiscal 
stability and governance), in that fiscal stability and good governance contribute to economic growth and 
social inclusion.  The CAS Progress Report restated these as four strategic objective statements.  These are 
presented in this Completion Report.

Page 3 of 33 

for growth and for building-up of effective social spending that reaches the poor.  Governance 
improvements were needed to deliver core services to all citizens, especially the poor. 

8. 
The CAS adopted a “back to basics” approach, focusing on the ability of agencies to 
deliver services on the ground and make real implementation progress, rather than on 
sophisticated reform design.  The strategy required the Bank to be more selective in its approach, 
but opportunistic in specific engagements5.  It focused on ―Islands of Good Governance‖ – national 
agencies, local governments, or economic sectors for which the basic governance arrangements are 
sufficiently sound to provide a reasonable chance of success.  Bank engagement would be as 
follows:   

 At the national level, the Bank would focus on working through and improving in-country 
systems and processes, with more Bank operations focused on agency core mandates, 
functions, and service delivery improvements within the budget.  The Bank would also 
focus on making decentralization more operational, representing a critical link to the local 
government agenda. 

 At the local level, there would be an integrated cross-sectoral focus on local governments 
as the direct client.  Developing a performance framework and capacity building program 
for local governments that is consistent across local governments would be central to this 
effort.  Linking financing and capacity building to a clear performance framework in a 
practical way would also facilitate good governance at the local level. 

 At the private sector level, there would be greater coordination between the Bank and IFC 
to promote private investments by strengthening regulatory agencies, reducing the cost of 
doing business, improving financial intermediation, and financing investments for public -
private partnerships projects as well as investments in sectors with high growth potential.   

9. 
The CAS anticipated a lower level of lending, compared to past CASs , and the 
continuation of a robust non-lending program.  The base case program for FY06-08 was 
expected to range from US$450-900 million, lower than the US$1.1-1.3 billion in previous CASs.  
The level of Bank commitments would be determined by the progress on fiscal reforms, especially 
a reduction in the consolidated public sector deficit (CPSD) and improved tax effort, going up to 
US$1.8 billion under the high case6.   The Bank would continue knowledge transfers through its 
economic and sector work and non-lending technical assistance program, mobilization of trust 
funds, and the network of Knowledge Development Centers.  Greater emphasis would be given to 
―just-in-time‖ knowledge transfers to respond to immediate client needs.  

10. 
The Government strengthened its fiscal position by 2006 and the Bank scaled up 
lending and extended the CAS to end FY09.  The Government reduced the CPSD, turning it into 
a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2006.  The bulk of the adjustment was due to enhanced tax 
revenues, with the tax-to-GDP ratio increasing from 13 percent in 2005 to 14 percent in 2006.  
Reflecting the improved situation, the Region issued a CAS Progress Report which confirmed the 
continued relevance of the strategy and approaches taken, extended the CAS by one year to end-
FY09, and proposed a new base case of US$1.7 billion for FY08-09.  The larger program was 
based on increased fiscal space, the need for more public investment, and strong demand for Bank 

5 Selectivity under the CAS would be functional and not sectoral.   
6 The triggers for the high case were (a) a CPSD reduction of 2 percent of GDP relative to 2004, (b) 
compatible with a CPSD reduction of 3 percent during 2005-07, (c) with a significant portion of the 
adjustment due to increase in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP.

support.  The CAS Progress Report was distributed to the Board on a lapse-of-time basis 7 on 
August 2, 2007.   

11. 
A results framework was developed, but design weaknesses limited its usefulness.  The 
CAS identified 12 outcomes: one outcome corresponding to each of the four objectives 
(governance, fiscal stability, growth and social inclusion) by one of three platforms (national, local 
and private sector development).  These country outcomes were presented in a 4x3 matrix (Table 
13 in the CAS) which is replicated in Table 1 of this report. The results framework did not, 
however, include baselines or targets with which to measure progress against CAS outcomes. 
Therefore, it was not possible to determine what changes the Bank expected to achieve during the 
CAS period.  The results framework did include ―Milestones‖ which reflected the expected 
outcomes of the Bank Group assistance.  But the milestones were generally framed as outcomes or 
objectives without baselines or targets which again made it difficult to assess whether they had 
been met.  The CAS included a separate annex table (Annex B-10) mapping Bank interventions 
(lending and non-lending) by goal and platform.   

12. 
The country team tried to use and refine the results framework by defining baselines 
and targets during annual portfolio reviews. The weaknesses in the design of the results 
framework made the task of monitoring and evaluating the CAS unwieldy.  While the periodic 
monitoring of CAS milestones was useful in confirming the overall consistency and direction of 
progress and in increasing country team ownership of CAS results , it did not allow calibration of 
Bank Group interventions to meet pre-agreed targets.  Many of these milestones were subsequently 
updated and/or formally revised in the CAS Progress Report to reflect evolution in the Bank 
program. 

D. Relevance of the Bank Program 

13. 
Aligning the CAS with government priorities and maintaining the relevance of the 
Bank program is a dynamic (not static) process.  The CAS was aligned with the MTPDP, both 
plans acknowledging the importance of addressing the need to tackle the fiscal situation.   A 
consultative process, the Philippine Development Forum (PDF), proved to be effective in aligning 
government and Bank priorities and maintaining (and enhancing) the relevance of the Bank country 
program. In 2005, the Government and the Bank started the PDF by widening the Consultative 
Group meetings to include civil society, private sector, legislators and other stakeholders.  In order 
to make the PDF into a continuous dialogue rather than an annual event, working groups (co-
chaired by the Government and a development partner) were set up to follow up on issues and 
agreements during the last meeting8.   The PDF has proven effective in building consensus and 
aligning development partners around key challenges.  Interviewing government counterparts, IEG 
found that there was almost universally positive appreciation of the PDF9 and the Bank’s convener 
role.  The IEG report noted that one senior government official considered the forum to maintain ―a 
good concentration on strategy and implementation rather than the pledging and positioning of 
donors.‖  

7 In the absence of a request by Executive Directors to schedule a CAS Progress Report for discussions, the 
minutes of a subsequent Board meeting record that Executive Directors noted the report. 
8 Working groups are set up in seven thematic areas: MDGs and social progress; growth and investment 
climate; economic and fiscal reforms; governance and anti-corruption; decentralization and local 
government; Mindanao; and infrastructure.

E. CAS Outcomes 

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 5 of 33 

14. 
This section assesses the progress made towards the CAS objectives and the results 
achieved by the Bank.  The Philippines has made significant progress in addressing the fiscal 
situation, turning the consolidated public sector deficit into a surplus in 2006 and achieving an 
economic growth rate of over 5 percent in 2006 and 2007.  On the other hand, poverty increased 
between 2003 and 2006 despite the strong economic performance, raising concerns both in the 
country and the Bank.  Progress is being made on government procurement reform and 
strengthening budgeting, but corruption continues to be a major concern and investment has 
continued to decline.  There are growing concerns that the tax revenue increases will not be 
sustained. The Bank not only implemented its program of lending and Analytical and Advisory 
Activities (AAA), but also played a key convener role around the PDF and mobilized grants to 
supplement its lending and AAA program.   

15. 
Overall, Bank program outcomes are considered to be “moderately satisfactory”.  
This is based on the assessment of each of the four CAS objectives.  The results for fiscal stability 
is rated ―satisfactory‖ (bordering on ―highly satisfactory‖), economic growth ―satisfactory‖ (but 
bordering on ―moderately satisfactory‖), and ensuring social inclusion and governance ―moderately 
satisfactory‖.  The CAS objective assessments were based, in turn, on assessments of the individual 
CAS outcomes under each platform (national, local and private).  The assessments for each CAS 
outcome are discussed below and the summary results are presented in Table 1.   A more detailed 
results summary by outcome is presented in Appendix 1.  Bank performance is assessed in the 
following section.  The poor design of the results framework (noted above), however, made the 
assessment of the CAS outcomes more difficult.

reform. Improving tax effort was 
part of DPL1. The Bank is 
assisting the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue to improve tax 
collections through the NPS on 
Tax Administration, an IDF 
grant, and policy notes.  In 
addition, the Bank has been 
supporting government efforts to 
privatize the power sector, with 
a positive impact on government 
finances. However, the slow

Improving Governance 

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 7 of 33 

16. 
The Government has been taking steps to improve governance.  A key development 
has been the strengthening of the procurement process.  The Government Procurement Reform Act 
(2003) created a single legal framework for procurement and streamlined and modernized 
procurement. The Act resulted in the harmonization of national procurement procedures between 
government and its three main development partners, the World Bank, the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).  It created an e-procurement 
system which was deemed to increase transparency.  The Government also addressed the concern 
over the fragmentation of rules and regulations by preparing a unique set of rules for all 
procurement activities covered by the Act. Similarly, the Government has taken steps to improve 
budgeting by piloting of a results-oriented Organizational Performance Indicator Framework, 
introducing Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs), and linking government priorities 
and resources through the Budget Strategy Paper.   

17. 
But challenges remain.  Civil service reform, another area identified for improvement, 
remains stalled. While the frameworks for procurement and budget improvements are in place , 
corruption continues to be an issue: the Philippines ranked 112 out of 125 in a list of countries 
where irregular payments are required for public contracts according to the Global Competitiveness 
Report 2006-07 and the Bank’s 2008 CPAR noted that by one estimate possibly 20 percent to 30 
percent of each contract goes to leakages.  The challenge is to ensure implementation of the 
procurement and budgetary reforms throughout the Government.  However, there are concerns 
over slippages, such as the delay in making public budget utilization data (see below).  

18. 
The Bank has supported the Government’s efforts to improve governance.  The Bank 
has contributed to the budget reforms by providing analysis through its analytical and advisory 
activities (AAA) and by using the PDF as a forum to discuss key public expenditure and 
governance issues.  Bank operations are supporting agency efforts to internalize and implement 
many of the changes.  At the national level, the Departments of Education (DepEd), Health (DoH), 
two agencies with Bank National Program Support (NPS) operations, and the Department of Social 
Welfare and Development (DSWD), have adopted MTEFs.  The Bank has provided grants to the 
Government Policy and Procurement Board, the Office of the Ombudsman , and the Presidential 
Anti-Graft Commission to strengthen their capacity to oversee procurement and fight corruption 
(see Box 1).  Finally, governance improvement is a key objective of the Bank’s program of 
Development Policy Loans (DPLs).  Increasing the number of postings under the Government’s e-
procurement system was a prior condition for the first loan (DPL1, FY07).  However, lack of 
progress on disclosing budget execution information is one of the reasons, which delayed the 
second DPL (DPL2). 

19. 
Individual Bank projects strengthen agency capacity in budgeting, procurement 
and/or financial management, both at the national and local levels.  At the national level, the 
Second Social Expenditure Management Project (SEMP2, completed in FY07) focused on 
strengthening fiduciary and procurement systems in DepEd, DoH and DSWD and demonstrated the 
benefits of competitive bidding10 .  The Second National Roads Improvement and Management 
Project (NRIMP2) includes an Integrity Strengthening Action Plan for the Department of Public 
Works and Highways (see Box 1).  At the local level, officials from 979 local government units 
(LGUs) have been trained in planning, finance, construction supervision and other municipal 
management areas under the Local Government Finance and Development Project (LGFDP-
Logofind).  The Bank’s community-driven development projects have engaged communities in the 

10 ICB under the project resulted in improved quality and cost savings.

planning and implementation of local investment and service delivery.  It is not clear, however, 
whether all these individual project level efforts would be sustainable and would lead to system-
wide improvements at the local level.  The Bank is addressing these concerns by working through 
the PDF to refine the local government performance framework and assisting the Department of 
Interior and Local Government to review local government training through an IDF grant.   

Box 1: Fighting Corruption in the Philippines 

The Bank has been assisting government agencies to enhance their capacities to oversee procurement 
and tackle corruption through various grants to procurement and anticorruption agencies. The Bank 
provided the Government Policy and Procurement Board (GPPB) with two consecutive grants which helped 
GPPB develop and pilot test generic procurement manuals (which were harmonized with the Asian 
Development Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the Bank), institute a national 
procurement training program through state universities and colleges, and prepare and pilot test Agency 
Procurement Performance Indicators.  GPPB is currently developing further training and certification 
programs for public procurement professionals.  The Office of the Ombudsman received an ASEM grant 
with which the Office conducted field investigation training and developed an electronic data bank for the 
Statements of Assets and Liabilities and Net Worth and an electronic case tracking system for use by the 
Office of the Special Prosecutor.  The Bank also provided IDF grants to the Bureau of Internal Revenue to 
strengthen its revenue administration capacity and reduce opportunities for graft and to the Presidential Anti -
Graft Commission to strengthen agency internal audit units for effective procurement monitoring and 
enforcement.  

At the project level, the Bank is conducting due diligence in procurement and financial management, 
tackling corruption when it arises, and working with agencies to improve their controls and 
procedures.  For example, the Bank rejected road contracts in 2003, 2004, and 2006 due to signs of bid 
rigging under the First National Roads Improvement and Management Project (NRIMP1). These cases were 
referred to the Bank’s Department of Institutional Integrity which found that a cartel of contractors had 
engaged in corrupt and collusive practices in all three rounds of bidding. The findings were disclosed to the 
Government in November 2007 for possible follow-up under Philippines law.  This also led to tightening of 
procedures within the Department of Public Works and Highways and in the follow -up project, NRIMP2.  
The Department adopted an Integrity Strengthening Action Plan which is supported by a range of measures 
incorporated into the Bank project, such as the use of an independent procurement evaluator, independent 
oversight by a coalition of citizens and road user groups (―Road Watch‖), strengthening of procurement and 
financial controls, and business process improvements to reduce opportunities for interference. 

20. 
The Bank is strengthening the oversight functions of the regulatory agencies in the 
power sector and in Metro Manila water and sanitation.   The Government has been pursuing 
the privatization of power, and water and sanitation since the 1990s, changing the role of 
government from service delivery to policy and oversight .  Strengthening the regulatory agencies is 
critical to increasing private investment in infrastructure.  The Electricity and Power Reform Act 
(2001) provided the framework for restructuring the power sector.  The Bank has been supporting 
the implementation of the Act, most recently in assisting the Energy Regulatory Commission to 
develop rules and regulations for a concession agreement for power transmission.  Similarly, the 
Government divided the provision of water supply and sanitation in Metro Manila into two 
concessions in the late 1990s with technical assistance from IFC.   The Bank has since been 
assisting the Metro Manila Water Supply and Sanitation System Regulatory Office carry out the 
rebasing of the tariffs through the Third Manila Sewerage Project and is extending financing to one 
of the concessionaires through one of its projects.

Achieving Fiscal Stability to Generate Resources Aimed at Spurring Growth and Raising 
Investments in the Social and Infrastructure Sectors 

21. 
The Philippines has experienced a turn-around in its fiscal position.  The consolidated 
public sector balance went from a deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to a surplus of 0.2 percent 
in 2006 and an estimated surplus of 1.4 percent for the first three quarters of 2007 (Figure 1).  
Increase in tax revenues was a major factor behind this turn-around.  The Government 
implemented various measures to improve tax revenues between 2004-2006, such as the passage of 
the reformed value-added tax law which removed exemptions and increased the tax rate by 2 
percent effective in 2006; increase in the corporate tax rate; and, the enactment of a ―Sin Tax‖ law 
which raised excise taxes on cigarettes, tobacco, and alcohol.  Tax revenues increased from 12.4 
percent of GDP in 2004 to 14.3 percent in 2006 (Figure 2).  Improvements in the financial position 
of public corporations and revenues from privatization in the power sector also contributed to the 
improvement in the Government’s fiscal position.  There is a concern, however, that the tax effort 
is stalling with tax revenues as a percentage of GDP in 2007 dipping slightly below the level 
reached in 2006. 

Figure 1 

Figure 2 

22. 
The Bank and IFC have supported the Government’s efforts to improve revenue 
generation, both at the national and local government levels, and reduce the fiscal burden of 
public corporations through increased cost recovery and privatization.  Bank economic reports 
have been making the case for fiscal improvements: fiscal reform was discussed in detail in the 
2005, 2007, and 2008 economic reports11 which served as inputs into the PDF. The PDF acted as a 
forum to raise awareness and develop a consensus for tax increases.  The Bank, together with 
Filipino academics and development partners, helped develop and sustain the momentum for fiscal 
reform.  Operationally, the Bank supported the Bureau of Internal Revenue to improve collections 
through the NPS on Tax Administration Reform (FY07), an IDF grant, and short policy notes.  
Improving tax effort was one of the objectives of DPL1.  However, there are concerns.  
Implementation of the NPS on tax reform is not progressing as originally anticipated and the 
stalling of the tax effort in 2007 is one of the factors behind the Bank’s decision to delay DPL212.

23. 
At the local government level, the Bank is working with local government units 
(LGUs) to improve their ability to raise revenues.  A total of 535 LGUs have participated in 
training on real property tax and the local revenue code under the LGFDP-Logofind.  These LGUs 
increased their local revenues by Php 8.7 billion or by 114 percent between 2000 (the baseline) and 
2007, although it is not possible to establish how much the training contributed to this increase.  In 
addition, participating LGUs improved revenues by investing in bus terminals and markets and by 
implementing business and real property tax enhancement programs. The Bank is also assisting the 
Government to develop performance based grants to improve local government revenue 
mobilization by providing information on performance based grant systems and their possible 
application to the Philippines through an IDF grant13, and developing a project designed around 
performance based grants to LGUs.  

24. 
The Bank and IFC are furthering privatization of the power sector which contributes 
to improvements in the Government’s fiscal position.  Improving the financial viability of the 
power sector is one of the objectives of the Bank’s DPLs14.  As mentioned above, the Bank is 
supporting the Government on a concession agreement for power transmission.  IFC has increased 
private participation in the National Power Corporation’s Small Power Utility Groups (SPUGs) 
which service off-grid areas (mainly rural and isolated communities), took an equity stake in the 
Philippines National Oil Company Energy Development Corporation’s (PNOC-EDC) initial public 
offering, and financed the privatization  of two power generating facilities.  In addition, IFC helped 
reduce the Government’s fiscal burden through the sales of non-performing assets held by the 
National Home Mortgage Corporation and the National Development Corporation and government 
equity investments in listed and non-listed companies.  

Generating Economic Growth to Accelerate Job Creation and Poverty Alleviation 

25. 
The Philippines continues to experience high economic growth, but declining 
investments raise concerns over its sustainability.  GDP grew at over 5 percent in 2006 and 2007, 
driven by demand which in turn was fueled in part by overseas worker remittances (Figure 3).   
Economic growth, however, has not led to significant employment generation or poverty reduction: 
unemployment remained around 8 percent and poverty increased (see ―Social Inclusion‖ below).  
Investment also continued to decline (Figure 4).  The 2008 economic report15 noted that the recent 
growth was facilitated by an uptake of spare capacity, but that this capacity was mostly exhausted, 
requiring higher investment to sustain economic growth.  The 2006 CAS had questioned the 
sustainability of consumption-driven growth and raised the lackluster investment climate as an 
issue; the challenge of increasing private investment remains.   

26. 
The Bank Group is assisting the Government to address the infrastructure needed to 
promote growth.  The CAS identified lack of infrastructure as a serious constraint to investment 
and economic growth.  At the national level, the Bank and IFC are supporting government efforts 
to improve the national highway network, address the transportation needs of Metro Manila, and 
strengthen power supply, including rural electrification.

In transport, NRIMP1 (completed FY07), upgraded 382 km of national roads, conducted 
preventive maintenance on 721 km of national roads, piloted performance based maintenance 
contracts on another 254 km, helped to establish a Road Board and Road Fund, and carried out 
business process improvements in the Department of Public Works and Highways.  The follow up 
project (NRIMP2) was approved in FY08 with a noteworthy approach to improving governance 
and reducing corruption in the implementing agency (see Box 1) .  The Metro Manila Urban 
Transportation Project improved access 
to 
the Marikina Valley and made 
intersection 
improvements along major thoroughfares.  In addition, the Bank and IFC are exploring support for 
the expansion of the Light Rail Transit System in Metro Manila.   

28. 
In the power sector, the Bank Group is furthering the Government’s privatization of the 
sector.  IFC has invested in the privatization of two power generation plants.  Both the Bank and 
IFC are promoting rural electrification by financing and strengthening rural Electrical Cooperatives, 
promoting off-grid systems (e.g., solar power), and furthering sector reforms through the Rural 
Power Development Program, GEF grants, and IFC investments and advisory services.   

29. 
At the local level, the Bank is providing LGUs with access to financing for infrastructure 
and service improvements through financial intermediaries and geographic or sectoral projects.  As 
of June 2008, 462 LGUs have obtained financing through the Municipal Development Fund and 
653,141 households have gained access to basic infrastructure and services through the LGFDP-
Logofind.  LGUs are also funding rural roads and bridges, small-scale irrigation, rural water and 
other infrastructure and facilities under the Second Agrarian Reform Communities Development 
Project (ARCDP2) and the Second Mindanao Rural Development Project (MRDP2, approved 
FY07).  These rural investments are seen to have a positive effect - Agrarian Reform Communities 
that have participated in ARCDP2 for at least three years have reported a 21 percent increase in 
real income due to, among others, rural infrastructure. 

30. 
The overall effect of Bank support is difficult to determine.  Improving infrastructure is 
still seen as a major challenge. The 2008 economic report noted that the Philippines fares poorly in 
many infrastructure indicators in the Global Competitiveness Index and that the quality of transport 
infrastructure was a particularly serious concern.   

31. 
Bank efforts to improve the investment climate and the productivity of firms have 
been less successful.  The Bank has been emphasizing the need to address corruption and reduce

Law in 2007 and is taking steps to improve the productivity of local businesses, but it is not clear 
whether the Bank had any influence.  The Bank is supporting the Department of Agriculture to 
strengthen its marketing and regulatory functions in order to promote new products, diversify 
production, and encourage private investment in agriculture under the Diversified Farm Income 
and Market Development Project.  Progress of reforms and the project have been much slower than 
originally anticipated.  

Ensuring Social Inclusion and the Improved Delivery of Basic Services 

32. 
Despite high economic growth, poverty increased between 2003 and 2006.  While the 
Philippine economy grew at an average of 5 percent per annum since 2000, the poverty incidence 
increased from 30 percent in 2003 to 32.9 percent in 2006 or the level in 2000 (33 percent).  In 
2006, 27.6 million Filipinos lived below the poverty level, more than ever before.   Some possible 
reasons for the drop are a fall in real incomes of households, economic growth which favored the 
corporate sector, and low government social spending caused by the fiscal crisis.       

33. 
The Bank works with national government agencies and LGUs to improve access to 
basic services for the poor and social protection.  The poor rely more on the Government for 
education, health and basic services since they cannot afford to obtain them from private providers.  
The Bank has been working with DoH, DepEd and DSWD, piloting school based management 
under the Third Elementary Education Project (closed FY06) and procurement and financial 
management reforms under SEMP2 (closed FY07).  These projects contributed to improvements in 
test scores in project schools; improvements in textbook to pupil ratio in math, science and other 
key subjects; improvement in TB cure rates; and reduction in the incidence of measles.  Both 
projects laid the foundations for sector-wide approaches: the NPS for Basic Education (FY06) 
furthers school based management and improves teacher competency and the NPS for Health 
(FY06) aims to increase the enrolment of indigent people in national health insurance and improve 
health service delivery.  The proposed support to government on the conditional cash transfer 
(CCT) should also provide substantial benefit to the poorest, and, more broadly, reform the poverty 
reduction program. 

34. 
At the local level, the Bank is promoting greater community empowerment through 
participation, accountability, and transparency in local decision making, especially of the 
poor and disadvantaged groups.  Using a community-driven development (CDD) approach, 
where communities identify priorities and manage sub-project implementation, the KALAHI-
CIDSS Project has financed more than 4,200 small scale investments in infrastructure and other 
facilities in 184 of the poorest municipalities.  LGUs provide technical support and counterpart 
funding with responsibility for operation and maintenance being shared between communities and 
LGUs.  Two projects, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Social Fund and 
MRDP2, focus on Mindanao, one of the poorer regions which is experiencing conflict.  In addition, 
the Bank has helped to establish and get off the ground a multi-donor Mindanao Trust Fund. 

35. 
The Bank also anticipated increasing access to financing for micro- and small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs).  The Third Rural Finance Project (closed FY08) made 546 subloans 
to SMEs, creating around 17,000 jobs, and around 115,000 subloans to micro-enterprises.  
However, no new initiatives were started during the CAS period.  IFC has concluded advisory 
agreements with private financial institutions on SME support in 2008.

F. Bank Performance 

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 13 of 33 

36. 
The Bank’s performance during the CAS period is rated “Satisfactory”.  The Bank 
has been able to deliver a program in line with the country needs.  Improvement in the fiscal 
situation allowed the Bank to expand its lending, committing US$1.3 billion, including a DPL and 
several NPS operations.  The Bank reacted to the typhoon damage in Bicol region with a power 
restoration project and to the food crisis with a development policy operation under the Global 
Food Crisis Response Program.  The Bank has been delivering knowledge products through AAA 
and trust funded activities which have been appreciated by the client , but it is not possible to assess 
their effect.  Project implementation has not always been smooth in the Philippines, but the Bank is 
proactively managing its portfolio, both lending and trust funds, with the Government. 

Non-lending 

37. 
The Bank plays an important role in the transfer of knowledge to the Philippines.  
The Bank’s ability to bring knowledge on international experiences, especially in carrying out 
complex reforms, is valued by government counterparts 16 .  In addition, the Bank was able to 
provide multi-sectoral analysis, provide consistent policy advice, and maintain continuity during 
times of frequent changes in government, i.e.,  to act as ―an important policy anchor‖ in the view of 
a senior government official17.   

38. 
The Bank’s non-lending program has evolved from a number of formal studies to a 
mix of formal economic and sector work, smaller “just-in-time” policy notes and studies, 
training and technical assistance.  The Bank’s economic reports provided background for the 
PDF discussions.  In addition, the Bank’s involvement in the various PDF working groups has also 
provided opportunities to transfer knowledge to government counterparts and other stakeholders.  
Many of the non-lending activities have been funded by both Bank executed and recipient executed 
trust funds.  The FY06-08 CAS saw the AAA program evolving over the CAS period, as the Bank 
adjusted to evolving client priorities and opportunities, and did not provide a definitive list of new 
AAA tasks.  The major AAA outputs are listed in Appendix 2. 

39. 
Trust funds have been critical in the Bank’s support to the Philippines by providing 
technical assistance to build the Government’s capacity and to support sector-specific and 
cross-sectoral initiatives.  The Philippines country team supported the Government’s efforts to 
pursue trust fund opportunities from other donors in order to complement Bank operations and to 
help address areas that the Government has not been inclined to borrow for.  Strategic partnerships 
between the Government, concerned donors and the Bank, have built on and further reinforced 
coordinated policy dialogue on sector issues and reform agendas, especially in education and health 
and in extending support to the conflict affected areas of Mindanao.  Besides providing support to 
lending operations, trust funds have allowed the Government and the country team to undertake a 
range of strategically positioned analytical, advisory and capacity building activities and have 
served as effective vehicles for strengthening country systems and advancing harmonization 
initiatives. 

40. 
The Bank’s monitoring and evaluation of the effect of its AAA program has not kept 
pace with the changes.   Approximately one-quarter of the Bank’s budget was spent on AAA 

16 In interviews with IEG, a senior government official said ―The Bank is more than just money . . . [It is] an 
independent source of advice‖ and another said ―I personally valued the advice more than the money.‖  From

during the CAS period.  Feedback from government officials indicates that the Bank’s work is 
appreciated.  However, it is difficult to get a good overview of the AAA program or assess the 
effect it may have had on the Government and other audiences. Compared to the project portfolio 
and the trust fund program, the monitoring and evaluation of AAA activities is less structured.  At 
present, the Bank is not able to answer the questions: ―What worked, what did not, and why?‖  
Going forward, the Bank will need to strengthen the management of its AAA program. 

41. 
Finally, knowledge transfer is not limited only to AAA.  The Bank’s external country 
website features not only economic reports and some sector reports, but also reports produced by 
the Networks and DEC on the Philippines.  The Bank is also making development information 
more accessible to the population through Knowledge Development Centers (KDCs) which are 
established in partnership with academic institutions throughout the Philippines.  The 11th Center 
was established in Iloilo City in September 2008 in partnership with the Philippines Central 
University.     

Lending 

42. 
Bank lending over FY06 through the second quarter of FY09 was US$1,250 million, 
higher than the US$450 - US$900 million anticipated in the CAS and the US$852 million 
committed between FY00-05.  The improvement in the Government’s fiscal situation allowed the 
Bank to increase the amount of lending and deliver DPL1 in FY06.  The Bank increased the base 
case to US$1.7 billion and extended the CAS period by one year to end-FY09 in 2007.  Actual 
deliveries in FY08, however, were below expectations because of insufficient progress in reforms 
or due to availability of alternative financing.  The DPL series closed in December 2008 without 
completing DPL2.  A new DPL might be considered in calendar 2009 in response to the financial 
crisis. The Bank was able to respond swiftly to rehabilitate power after a typhoon devastated the 
Bicol region in 2006 (Bicol Power Restoration). The Bank quickly developed a Food Crisis 
Response Development Policy Operation (US$200 million) under the Bank’s Global Food Crisis 
Response Program in 2008.  Planned and actual lending is listed in Appendix 3. 

43. 
At the national level, the Bank has been responsive to government demand, shifting 
its focus from investment lending to national program support or sector wide approach 
(SWAp) operations and, most recently, to additional financing.  NPS operations were approved 
in basic education, health, tax administration, and environment and natural resource management in 
FY06 and FY07 18 .  These operations aim to strengthen the agency’s institutional capacity by 
supporting critical policy and institutional reforms and by using government procedures for fund 
releases.  One project, the NPS on Participatory Irrigation, originally scheduled for FY06, has been 
delayed due to lack of progress on rationalizing staffing within the implementing agency, a critical 
step for improved efficiency.  The NPS operations have gotten off to a slower start than anticipated, 
in part, because of the need to set up the internal procedures and policy issuances to support the 
institutional reforms and system level changes supported by the projects.  While there are concerns 
over uneven support from high level management in the implementing agencies, the NPS approach 
enjoys strong support from the core government oversight agencies 19 who have introduced a 
number of innovations in budget processes in response to analysis and agreements reached in 
workshops organized in 2007 and 2008 to improve the performance of NPS projects.  The sector 
reform agendas supported by these NPS operations have also served as good platforms for forging 
strategic partnerships and mobilizing additional resources (see Partnerships below).  In the last year 

18 While not designated a NPS operation, NRIMP2 follows a similar approach, focusing on institutional 
capacity development and reform. 
19 The Department of Finance, the Department of Budget and Management, and the National Economic 
Development Agency.

Page 15 of 33 

of the CAS, the Bank is increasing the number of additional financing projects, bringing a quick 
answer to a demand for supplemental resources in successful sectors. 

Portfolio  

44. 
The Bank has been proactively managing its project and trust fund portfolio with the 
Government.   The Bank conducts regular, annual implementation reviews of both its project and 
trust fund portfolios with the core government oversight agencies.  These reviews include not only 
implementation, but also outputs and expected outcomes and the likelihood of projects achieving 
their stated development outcomes.  In FY08, the Government carried out a country portfolio 
review, including major development partners such as ADB and JBIC as well as the Bank, to better 
understand implementation issues and identify areas needing further attention.  As mentioned 
above, a separate review of the NPS operations was conducted in FY08 to address the slower than 
anticipated start-up of these projects.  In FY09, the portfolio review focused on activities financed 
at the local level, e.g., involving LGUs and CDD approach. 

45. 
The Bank’s project portfolio during the CAS period is mixed.  From FY06 to FY08, a 
total of 12 new projects, including GEF projects but excluding DPL1, with a total commitment of 
US$856.8 million entered the portfolio and nine projects, including two GEF projects, for a total of 
US$601 million exited the portfolio.  As of end FY08, the Bank’s on-going portfolio stood at 24 
active projects, with a net loan commitment of US$1.4 billion.  The disbursement ratio has ranged 
from 15.2 percent (FY07) to 21.1 percent (FY06)20 which is within the historical range of the 
Philippines 12 percent to 23 percent.  The share of problem projects has increased from 13 percent 
in FY06 to 16.7 percent in FY08.  Portfolio indicators are presented in Appendix 4.  It is not 
unusual for projects in the Philippines to encounter problems some time during the ir 
implementation.  Of the nine Bank projects closed between FY06-08, three have rated as a problem 
for development outcome sometime during their life time.  All three projects were rated 
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory for development outcome in the Implementation Completion 
Report21.  

CAS Monitoring 

46. 
The Bank has been proactively monitoring the CAS, however the results framework 
has not necessarily proven to be an effective management tool.  The data in the results matrix 
were updated annually to identify priorities for the remainder of the CAS per iod and some 
milestones were formally revised in the CAS Progress Report.  The design of the results framework, 
however, has made it less effective as a strategic management and learning tool.  Updating the data 
has not necessarily been easy because they do not correspond directly to project level indicators. 
As discussed under CAS outcomes above, the lack of baselines and clear targets had made it 
difficult to assess whether progress is being made relative to original expectations.  Nonetheless, 
the CAS results framework has been used in making broad decisions on country team priorities and 
resource allocations, but not necessarily in calibrating the team’s response in specific sectors or 
outcome areas.   

20 In FY08, disbursement was 20.1%. 
21 The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated five of the seven closed projects .  The Outcome Rating for 
one project, the Water District Development Project, was downgraded from Satisfactory in the 
Implementation Completion Report to Moderately Unsatisfactory.  This project, however, was not rated as a 
problem during implementation.

G. Partnerships 

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 16 of 33 

47. 
The Bank strategy has emphasized partnerships: working closely with the 
Government, development partners, and civil society, leveraging the Bank’s presence in the 
Philippines.   The PDF has been an effective mechanism in engaging the various government, 
donor and civil society partners and in developing a coordinated approach.  The Bank has actively 
engaged development partners and consulted widely with local stakeholders and civil society in the 
preparation of its CASs.  At the operational level, the Bank has worked closely with other 
development partners active in that area: e.g., the Bank is coordinating with ADB in power sector 
reform and the NPS operations in education and health are part of a coordinated effort to support 
the Government’s basic education and health reform agendas.   

48. 
The Bank and its development partners are using their resources more effectively 
through partnerships supported by trust funds.  As a middle income country, the Philippines 
has not been a major recipient of donor financing, increasing the importance of coordination and 
the effective use of limited resources.  Recipient executed jumbo trust funds have emerged as a 
significant new business line for the Bank during the CAS period, helping to achieve major 
benefits across a number of sectors as well as in advancing harmonization among development 
partners.   

 Mindanao Trust Fund for Reconstruction and Development (MTF-RDP): The MTF-
RDP was established in 2006, following a joint needs assessment in 200522.  Close to US$9 
million has been mobilized including a grant from the Bank’s Development Grant Facility.  
The MTF-RDP provides a single channel for donors, making it easier for smaller donors to 
contribute, and a single interface with the development community for trust fund recipients.  
It has helped establish better accountability mechanisms to manage the flow of funds and 
information in a post-conflict setting.  MTF-RDP is supporting stabilization, training and 
capacity building in the Bangsamoro Development Agency, conflict-affected communities, 
and municipal governments in Mindanao. 

 

 European Commission Trust Fund for Health Sector Reform:  The trust fund, 
amounting to 13.45 million Euros, supports the implementation of the health reform 
strategy at the provincial level and capacity building for DoH at the national level, 
complementing the Bank’s National Program Support for Health Reform Project.  Both 
initiatives form part of DoH’s broader health reform program. 

 The Trust Fund Supporting Philippines Basic Education Reforms (SPHERE):  The trust 
fund provides US$35 million equivalent to DepEd to support its basic education sector 
reforms.  SPHERE is administered by the Bank and complements the National Program 
Support in Basic Education Project. 

49. 
The Bank has been harmonizing its procedures around government regulations 
together with ADB and JBIC.   The Government and its largest development partners (ADB, 
JBIC and the Bank) agreed to align their national procurement rules and regulations with the 
Government’s new procurement system following the passage of the Government Procurement 
Reform Act in 2003.  As a result, the agencies agreed on a common set of: implementing rules and 
regulations; bidding documents for works, goods and consulting services; procurement manuals; 
training for procurement staff; and procurement reporting and monitoring. 

22 The joint needs assessment was financed by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UN, ADB and the EC. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
FY06-09 CAS Completion Report  

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 17 of 33 

50. 
Success of harmonization in procurement has led to similar efforts in financial 
management and safeguards.  The Government developed a new government accounting system 
in 2002 to simplify financial accounting and to ensure consistent application of accounting 
principles across government agencies.  Financial reporting for Bank projects utilizes the new 
government accounting principles, with some adjustments, for financial reporting.   The ADB, 
JBIC and the Bank are exploring ways to harmonize financial management and reporting with the 
Commission on Audit.  The Bank conducted a diagnostic review, together with the Government 
and other stakeholders, of the country’s safeguard systems on environmental assessment, 
indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement.  The objectives of the reviews were to 
recommend measures to strengthen local capacity for undertaking safeguards work and to identify 
areas where local processes, practices and policies could be harmonized with that of global good 
practice.  The assessments of environmental safeguards and indigenous peoples were completed in 
2007 and involuntary resettlement in 2008.  The reviews identified areas for improvement and 
some of the key recommendations have been adopted through the issuance of administrative orders 
by the relevant agencies or will be implemented under proposed Bank operations23.  Based on the 
partial success achieved, the Bank has identified the Philippines as a pilot country to complete 
harmonization on environment and indigenous people standards and to extend the harmonization of 
procurement to International Competitive Bidding.  Work has already started in both cases. 

51. 
An active civil society is one of the Philippines’ key assets in promoting better and 
more accountable governance.  In addition to engaging with development partners, the Bank took 
several steps to expand its engagements with civil society organizations (CSOs) during the 2006 
CAS period. 

52. 
First, the Bank helped create additional space for dialogue with CSOs.  At the local 
level, the Bank organized dialogue sessions held in KDCs around specific development topics, 
such as empowering marginalized communities in implementing procurement reform, peace and 
development in conflict-affected areas, disaster risk-management, anticorruption initiatives, as well 
as consultations for the Bank’s new CAS.  These sessions were well attended by local government 
officials, businessmen, non-governmental organizations, and citizens.  At a national level, the PDF 
encouraged CSO participation, both at the plenary and the working group level, providing CSOs a 
venue to give their perspectives on a national stage.  The Panibagong Paraan (local Development 
Marketplace) provided selected CSOs with resources for their projects.  The 2008 Panibagong 
Paraan, ―Building Partnerships for Effective Local Governance,‖ not only provided grants to 
CSOs, but also organized discussions around topics which CSOs identified as relevant to 
governance issues, such as assessing the impact of political dynasties, transparency and 
accountability in local governance, youth involvement in governance, and cutting the ―red tape‖ at 
the local level. 

53. 
Second, the role of the CSOs in Bank operation was expanded.  The Bank engaged the 
CSOs in improving the reach and quality of its operations and in results monitoring.  For example, 
DepEd has a nationwide partnership with CSOs among the youth, including the Boy Scouts and 
Girl Scouts, in monitoring procurement of key educational inputs such as textbooks.  In the 

23 The results of the review indicated that the legal bases, policy and institutional frameworks of the country’s 
safeguard systems for environmental assessment and indigenous peoples are strong and sound, but suffer 
from weak implementation due to capacity and financial constraints and overly bureaucratic procedures and 
processes.  The country’s involuntary resettlement system has huge gaps with global principles and good 
practices.  The Bank is providing support to the Government on environmental assessment through the NPS 
for the Environment and Natural Resource Management and on indigenous peoples through grant-funded 
technical assistance to the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples.

NRIMP2 design, ―Road Watch‖/―Bantay Lansangan‖ will play an active role in monitoring the 
progress of the project, improve transparency and accountability.  In the MTF-RDP, international 
NGOs are working with the Bank to implement capacity building initiatives and pilot projects 
aimed at stabilizing, training and building the capacity of the Bangsamoro Development Agency, 
conflict-affected communities and municipal governments.  The KALAHI-CIDSS project 
empowers local communities to participate in the selection, design, implementation, and 
monitoring of projects that respond to their priority needs.  Aside from improving community 
infrastructure, in drawing on the enthusiasm and commitment of community volunteers, KALAHI-
CIDSS has also helped to put in place more transparent and accountable systems of governance in 
communities where it is active and has enhanced local capacities in planning, procurement, 
financial management, and operation and maintenance.  

54. 
Finally, the Bank is forging strategic partnerships to scale up better governance.  
Working with selected network-based CSOs using different grant mechanisms, such as the Japan 
Social Development Fund and Development Grant Facility, the Bank is supporting the expansion 
of capacity development initiatives for improved governance.  A partnership with the Philippines 
Council for NGO Certification is helping to expand the institutionalization of better governance 
practices in NGOs through a globally-recognized system of certification.  The Affiliated Network 
on Social Accountability–East Asia and Pacific—a regional DGF-supported program based in the 
Philippines—is designed to support and advance demand-side governance initiatives drawing on 
the experience of well-established regional NGOs, delivering capacity building initiatives and 
technical assistance for both CSOs and governments across the region.  Through partnerships with 
urban poor communities, local NGOs and city governments in five sites nationwide, the Bank has 
been able to support the provision of infrastructure and the upgrading and renewal of slum 
communities. 

H. Conclusions and Lessons Going Forward 

55. 
The results under the 2006 CAS are mixed.  The Bank has been able to make progress in 
assisting the Government to address the fiscal deficit and make progress on procurement and 
budget formulation.  Bank knowledge transfers (including those provided through trust funded 
technical assistance) and convening role, working through the PDF, are seen to have played a role.  
The Bank and IFC have been supporting power sector privatization that has contributed to the 
reduction in the public sector deficit and improvements in service delivery.  Bank projects continue 
to finance needed infrastructure and services, oftentimes engaging local communities and aligning 
delivery closer to the residents’ needs.  The Bank is now moving to NPS operations that align Bank 
support directly with the agency’s core agenda.  However, poverty in the country not only 
continues to be a concern, but worsened between 2003 and 2006.  There is concern that the 
improvements in tax revenues will not be sustained.  Implementation of Bank projects continue to 
be a concern with actual disbursements lagging significantly behind appraisal estimates.  Some 
NPSs have not resulted in faster disbursements as expected.  As discussed in the sections above, on 
balance, CAS outcomes are considered to be ―moderately satisfactory‖ and Bank performance 
―satisfactory‖.   

56. 
The following lessons have been learned from the experience to date under the 2006 
CAS.  These have implications for the design and implementation of the next FY2010-12 CAS. 

 Overall strategic direction of the CAS is sound.  Sound fiscal management and 
improved governance will continue to be critical for ensuring sustained economic growth 
and poverty reduction.  The next CAS will need to maintain the gains made in revenue 
generation, public expenditure management, and procurement while pursuing further 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-09 CAS Completion Report  

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 19 of 33 

improvements in governance.  Continued focus on implementing the project portfolio will 
be critical to success during the next CAS: the NPSs in education and health can result in 
improved educational outcomes in basic education and improved access to health care for 
the poor; NRIMP can improve management of the national highway system; various Bank 
LGU projects can increase local residents’ access to infrastructure and basic service s in 
line with their perceived needs.  Going forward, the Bank will need to get a better 
understanding of the link (or lack thereof) between the country’s economic performance 
and lack of poverty reduction and ensure that its operations emphasize the needs of the 
poor. 

 Continued engagement is a critical element for success.   The Bank has a long history in 
the Philippines and has been able to develop relationships and trust with government 
counterpart agencies.  The Bank has been engaging in a continuous dialogue with the 
Government on many of the challenges facing the Philippines and the basis for results 
under the 2006 CAS has been laid during previous CAS periods.  For example, the Bank 
has been emphasizing the need to address the fiscal deficit through revenue generation and 
not just through reductions in expenditure. The Bank’s CPARs, the latest prepared in 2008, 
have pointed out issues with the Government’s system.  The Bank’s Social Expenditure 
Management Projects demonstrated the benefits of competitive bidding in terms of quality 
improvement and cost savings at the agency level.  The Bank would need to build on and 
continue to develop relationships at both the national and local government levels in 
pursuing results during the next CAS. 

 But the Bank needs to develop criteria for disengagement.  While continued 
engagement is necessary, it is also important to develop criteria to determine when the 
Bank should disengage.  The Bank is working with close to 20 national departments and 
GOCCs and a larger number of LGUs through its operations.  Given Bank resource 
constraints, the Bank will need to be selective.  There may be many reasons for 
disengagement.  It could be because there is limited support for and progress on the 
objectives that the Bank may be pursuing with the agency.  Alternatively, operations may 
be proceeding smoothly and the relationship may have matured to the point that continued 
Bank engagement may no longer be necessary (i.e., generate insufficient benefit for both 
parties).  In some cases, it may be important to continue working with an agency although 
progress may be limited.  The decision to engage or disengage will need to be made on the 
possible impact to the Bank’s strategy.   

 Strengthen monitoring (and evaluation) of AAA.  Knowledge transfers are an important 
part of the Bank engagement with the Philippines.  It is also an area where it is possible for 
the country team to make direct impact during the CAS period – project results achieved 
during FY10-12 would most likely come from projects already underway or in advanced 
stages of preparation and projects developed during the next CAS period would most likely 
start generating results beyond FY12.  The Philippine program has not been adequately 
monitoring nor assessing the possible impact of its AAA program.  The move from larger 
reports to smaller and targeted notes makes monitoring and evaluation more difficult.  But 
given the importance of knowledge transfers to the Bank’s effectiveness, it is important 
that the country program strengthen its management of AAA.  

 Strengthen the CAS results framework.  The current results framework has not proven 
useful in monitoring, managing and evaluating the CAS.  As mentioned above, the lack of 
baselines and targets made it difficult to assess whether the Bank was making progress 

 
 
 
 
 
 
FY06-09 CAS Completion Report  

Philippines FY10-12 CAS – Annex 3 
Page 20 of 33 

towards its stated objectives and country outcomes.  Another issue was that the underlying 
―development logic‖ (link between Bank instruments, outputs and CAS outcomes) was not 
necessarily clear.  The Bank can make the results framework into an effective CAS 
management, monitoring and evaluation tool by: (a) clearly stating the expected CAS 
outcomes; (b) including specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound 
(SMART) indicators to allow for better monitoring; and (c) making explicit the link 
between expected CAS outcomes and Bank instruments (i.e., making clear the 
development logic underlying the CAS).  Linking CAS monitoring with project, trust fund 
and AAA monitoring would facilitate data collection.  Closer strategic monitoring of 
progress towards CAS objectives should facilitate decisions on the appropriate level of 
engagement.

Appendix 1: FY06-09 CAS Results Summary 

CAS Outcome: Systems and processes for allocating and executing budgetary resources are more 
transparent and efficient  (Governance: National Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

The Government had been reforming the budget 
process - strengthening the links between policy, 
planning and budgeting; increasing transparency; 
and placing a greater emphasis on results.  The 
Organizational Performance Indicator Framework 
was introduced in 2005 and results-based 
planning and monitoring piloted in 13 
departments. 

The Government was improving procurement and 
addressing corruption.  The Government 
Procurement Reform Act (2003) created a single 
legal framework for procurement and streamlined 
and modernized the procurement process.  The 
Government instituted ―lifestyle checks‖ for 
public servants which led to the dismissal of 
several senior bureaucrats. However, there were 
concerns over capacity building, transparency and 
dispute resolution, and monitoring of 
procurement. 

The Government initiated a program to rationalize 
the bureaucracy.  It issued Executive Order 366 in 
2003 on procedures and benefit packages for staff 
rationalization, developed implementing rules, 
and initiated agency restructuring plans.  

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned  

The Government is proceeding with budget reforms, 
introducing MTEFs with the 2007 budget (linking 
policies, plans and budgets) and the Budget Strategy 
Paper and forward estimates with the 2008 budget 
(clarifying the Government’s priorities and resources 
prior to the preparation of budget).   

The Government continues to strengthen procurement 
and address corruption.   The Bank’s recent Country 
Procurement Assessment Report (2008) noted that the 
public procurement system has become more efficient, 
many loopholes have been closed, and the promotion 
of e-procurement (the Philippine Government 
Electronic Procurement System) improved 
transparency and efficiency.   

While progress is being made, challenges remain.  
The most recent economic report (2008) noted that not 
all agencies are implementing MTEFs, progress on 
rationalizing the bureaucracy has been very slow, and 
corruption continues to be an issue: e.g., the 
Philippines ranked 112 out of 125 in a list of countries 
where irregular payments are required for public 
contracts according to the Global Competitiveness 
Report 2006-2007 

The Bank contributed to government budget reforms by providing analysis through its economic reports (as 
background documents to the PDF) and using the PDF as a forum to discuss key public expenditure and 
governance issues with the Government, development partners and other stakeholders.   

The Bank plays an important role in operationalizing budget reforms at the agency level where it was 
supporting the implementation or preparation of  National Program Support operations (DepEd, DoH, 
DENR, DSWD) or providing agency-wide support (DPWH). 

The Bank provided the Government Policy and Procurement Board (GPPB) with two consecutive grants 
(TF053254, closed FY07, and TF057655, ongoing) which helped GPPB develop and pilot test generic 
procurement manuals (which were harmonized with ADB, JBIC and the Bank), institute a national 
procurement training program through state universities and colleges, and prepare and pilot test Agency 
Procurement Performance Indicators.  GPPB is currently developing further training and ce rtification 
programs for public procurement professionals.  The Office of the Ombudsman received an ASEM grant 
(TF054210, closed FY07) with which the Office conducted field investigation training and developed a 
data bank for the Statements of Assets and Liabilities and Net Worth and a case tracking system for use by 
the Office of the Special Prosecutor.  The Bank also provided an IDF grant (TF055185, ongoing) to the 
Presidential Anti-Graft Commission to strengthen agency internal audit units for effective procurement 
monitoring and enforcement.

Appendix 1: FY06-09 CAS Results Summary 

CAS Outcome:  System and process of Local Government Units (LGUs) for planning, budgeting, 
delivering services, and investments are transparent and efficient     (Governance: Local Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

LGUs include 78 provinces, 68 cities and over 
1,500 municipalities whose resources and 
capabilities vary significantly.  Generally, 
planning was weak (especially in environmental 
protection) and budget formulation and execution 
were largely non-transparent.  The PDF included 
a working group on Decentralization and Local 
Government (co-chaired by DILG and the Bank) 
which addressed local government finance, 
capacity building, benchmarking and 
harmonization.  The Local Government 
Performance Management System (LGPMS) was 
developed and rolled out in 2006. 

Various projects are developing local government 
capacity.  The PDF working group contributed to 
improvements in planning, budgeting and 
management in local governments: e.g., the national 
government agencies with oversight functions over 
local governments harmonized their procedures for 
planning, investment programming, revenue 
administration and budgeting, eliminating overlapping 
and conflicting guidance and reducing the 
administrative burden on the LGUs.  The working 
group is also supporting efforts to improve data 
quality and operationalize the LGPMS.  Over 80 
percent of the LGUs use the LGPMS.  

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

Various Bank operations including trust funds have supported LGUs’ efforts to strengthen planning, 
budgeting and the delivery of services. The LGFDP-Logofind trained officials from 979 LGUs in planning, 
finance, construction supervision and other management areas as of March 2008.  LISCOP resulted in 57 
LGUs in 24 micro-watersheds adopting multistakeholder micro-watershed planning as part of municipal 
development planning. SSLDIP (approved FY06) includes funding for participating LGU capacity building 
in construction supervision and management of municipal enterprises and services.  MRDP1 demonstrated 
the success of community engagement in natural planning and management which has been scaled up 
under MRDP2.  Bank financed-projects also help strengthen procurement and financial management in 
participating LGUs.  The Bank has also assisted 61 cities develop city strategies using participatory 
approaches through the Cities Alliance Program with many investments being funded by the Bank or other 
sources.  While capacity is being developed under various Bank projects, it is not clear whether this is 
having a wider impact – i.e., sustainable capacity development in LGUs as a group. 

The Bank has provided an IDF grant to DILG’s Local Government Academy to review and strengthen their 
role in local capacity building. 

CAS Outcome: Improved governance of corporate sector and infrastructure regulatory agencies 
(Governance: Private Sector Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

The Philippines had been pursuing a policy of 
privatization in infrastructure since the 1990s.  
Water supply and sanitation in Metro Manila had 
been provided by two private concessions since 
1997.  The Electricity Power Industry Reform Act 
(2001) provided a framework for restructuring the 
power sector - creating the National Transmission 
Corporation (Transco) to assume the transmission 
assets and functions of the National Power 
Corporation (NPC); creating the Power Assets 
and Liabilities Management Corporation 
(PSALM) to own Transco and other NPC assets 
and assume NPC’s liabilities; and replacing the 
Energy Regulatory Board with the Energy 

The Government continues to pursue its policy of 
private provision of infrastructure.  One of the water 
and sanitation concessions (Manila Water Company 
Inc.) is considered to be a major success.  A major 
development in the power sector was the creation of a 
wholesale electricity spot market in Luzon in 2006 
(this was one of the prior actions for DPL1).   The 
Government is proceeding with a concession for 
Transco’s transmission function.

Regulatory Commission (ERC).  The Government 
is transitioning from a provision to an oversight 
role.  Strengthening the regulatory agencies was 
seen as a priority. 
Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

The Bank has been assisting the Government strengthen its regulatory functions.  The Bank is supporting 
Metro Manila Water Supply and Sanitation System Regulatory Office through the Third Metro Manila 
Sewerage Project, most recently in rebasing tariffs for 2008.   

The Bank is assisting ERC develop the regulations for the Transco concession through a PHRD grant for a 
partial risk guarantee.  

In terms of corporate governance, the Bank has conducted a ROSC on Accounting Standards and training 
on corporate governance, but the effect of these interventions is not well understood. 

CAS Outcome: Improve public revenue mobilization, public expenditure management and management of 
state owned enterprises  (Fiscal Stability: National Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

Unsustainable growth in the public sector deficit 
due primarily to declining tax collection was seen 
as a major constraint to development.  Non-
financial public sector debt exceeded 101 percent 
of GDP in 2003.  The increase in debt was driven 
by public sector deficits due primarily to 
declining tax collection and rising power sector 
losses through 2004.  The CAS identified the lack 
of political will for reform and the pace of change 
as risks and noted that ―failure to rein in fiscal 
deficits would create greater economic 
vulnerabilities and reduce further expenditure 
contraction‖.   

The Philippines has experienced a turn-around in its 
fiscal position.  The consolidated public sector 
balance went from a deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP in 
2004 to a surplus of 0.2 percent in 2006 and an 
estimated surplus of 1.4 percent in 2007.  Increase in 
tax revenues was a major factor behind this turn- 
around.  The Government implemented various 
measures to improve tax revenues between 2004-
2006, such as the passage of the reformed value-added 
tax law which removed exemptions and increased the 
tax rate by 2 percent effective in 2006, an increase in 
the corporate tax rate, and the enactment of a ―Sin 
Tax‖ law which raised excise taxes on cigarettes, 
tobacco and alcohol.  Tax revenues increased from 
12.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 14.3 percent in 2006.  
Improvements in the fiscal position of public 
corporations and revenues from privatization in the 
power sector contributed to the improvement in the 
Government’s fiscal position.  There is a concern, 
however, that the tax effort is stalling with tax 
revenues as a percentage of GDP in 2007 dipping 
slightly below the level reached in 2007. 

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

The Bank emphasized the importance of increasing tax revenues (and not just cutting expenditures) in 
addressing the deficit.  The Bank consistently conveyed this message through its economic reports, policy 
notes, and other outreach.  The Bank helped develop and sustain momentum for fiscal reforms together 
with local academics, opinion leaders and development partners.  Improving the tax effort was one of the 
objectives of DPL1.  The Bank also approved a National Program Support (NPS) for Tax Administration 
Reform Project in FY07 to strengthen the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and is assisting the BIR 
improve tax administration through an IDF grant and policy notes on increasing excise tax rates and tax 
administration.  Implementation of the NPS, however, is progressing slower than anticipated.

Appendix 1: FY06-09 CAS Results Summary 

CAS Outcome: Expanded local revenue base and increased revenues from local resources in at least 20 
LGUs  (Fiscal Stability: Local Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

LGUs depend heavily on transfers from national 
government and have limited incentives to raise 
own revenues. 

Overall, LGUs continue to depend on national 
government transfers.  But there is diversity among 
LGUs.  Cities and larger municipalities in more 
developed locations (especially in Metro Manila) have 
more opportunities to and raise more local revenues.  
Poorer (4th and 5th class) municipalities with limited 
economic bases will continue to rely on national 
government revenue sharing for their revenues. 

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

Bank-supported projects include measures to improve local revenue generation.  LGFDP-Logofind 
financed improvements in real property tax administration and training on implementing local revenue 
codes and increasing local revenues.  Five hundred-thirty five LGUs have participated in the training to 
date.  These LGUs increased their local revenues by Php 8.7 billion or by 114 percent and increased the 
share of local source revenue from 24 percent to 26 percent between 2000 and 2007, although it is not 
possible to differentiate the impact of the training from other influences.  In addition, LGUs participating in 
the project increased revenues through investments in bus terminals and markets and through 
implementation of business and real property tax enhancement programs.  

The Bank is also piloting performance based grants to improve local government revenue mobilizatio n.  .  
An IDF grant provided the Government with information on performance based grant systems and their 
possible application to the Philippines.  The Bank is currently developing a Local Government Support for 
Performance Project which is expected to provide, among others, a performance based supplement to the 
Internal Revenue Allotment (revenue sharing). 

CAS Outcome: Reduced fiscal burden through financial strengthening of government corporation and 
financial institutions  (Fiscal Stability: Private Sector Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

The GOCCs’ financial position improved.  The 
GOCCs faced a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2004, 
but eliminated it in 2006 and are estimated to have a 
surplus in 2007.  A 30 percent increase in generation 
tariffs in 2004-05 and the resulting reduction in NPC’s 
deficit was a key factor.    

Deficits in Government Owned and Controlled 
Corporations (GOCCs) were another contributing 
factor to the public sector deficit.  Deficits in the 
National Power Corporation (NPC) were of 
special concern.  NPC deficits increased from 0.2 
percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.1 percent in 2003 
and an estimated 1.8 percent in 2004, as power 
tariffs were allowed to erode.  The Government 
had initiated power tariff increases starting in 
2004, but its impact was not fully known at the 
time of CAS development. 

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

Improving the financial viability of the power sector is one of the objectives the Bank’s DPLs.  This 
increase in tariffs and the publication of the guidelines for the universal charge for stranded costs and 
stranded debt were recognized as prior actions for DPL1.  As mentioned above, the Bank is supporting 
further privatization of the power sector through the Transco concession.    

IFC made several contributions to the reduction in the Government’s fiscal burden.  IFC has supported the

privatization of power sector by (a) advising the Government on the privatization of NPC’s Small Power 
Utility Groups (SPUGs) which service off-grid areas (mainly rural and isolated communities); (b) taking an 
equity stake in the Philippines National Oil Company Energy Development Corporation’s (PNOC -EDC) 
initial public offering; and (c) financing part of the privatization on the Masinloc coal -fired power plant and 
the Magat hydo-electric power plant.  IFC’s SPUG projects have reduced subsidies from NPC.  PNOC -
EDC was eventually fully privatized in 2007.  In addition, IFC has reduced the Government’s fiscal burden 
through the sales of non-performing assets held by the National Home Mortgage Corporation and the 
National Development Corporation and government equity investments in listed and non -listed companies.  

The Bank provided technical assistance through an ASEM grant (TF053181, closed FY06) to the Central 
Bank to improve consolidated supervision in the market risk area and establish an IT examination unit.  
The Bank also provided ASEM grants (TF052298- Bank executed, closed FY07 and TF052349 – Recipient 
executed, closed FY06) supporting the Government’s pension reforms. 

CAS Outcome: Competitiveness of the economy improved by increasing investment, upgrading 
infrastructure, and adopting reforms aimed at improving productivity of firms  (Growth: National 
Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 
The Philippines had been enjoying rising 
economic growth, which averaged 4-5 percent in 
2002-03 and accelerated to 6.1 percent (the fastest 
pace in 15 years).   The Philippines was 
benefitting from the economic restructuring since 
the late 1980s which helped the country better 
integrate with regional and global trade and 
investment, and a favorable external environment.  
However, the question remained on the 
sustainability of higher growth because it was 
driven by consumption, supported by remittances.   
Concerns were raised about the low level of 
domestic and foreign investment compared to 
other East Asian countries.  Lackluster investment 
was seen as the result of a fragile fiscal and debt 
position, perceived corruption, infrastructure 
weaknesses, concerns over law and order, and a 
sluggish financial system.  

Current Status 
The Philippines continues to experience high 
economic growth.  GDP grew at over 5 percent in 
2006 and 2007, driven by demand which in turn was 
fueled in part by overseas worker remittances.  
Economic growth, however, has not led to significant 
employment generation or poverty reduction: 
unemployment remained around 8 percent and 
poverty increased.   

Investment also continued to decline, raising concerns 
over the sustainability of growth.   The 2008 
economic report noted that the recent growth was 
facilitated by an uptake of spare capacity, but that this 
capacity was mostly exhausted, requiring higher 
investment to sustain economic growth.   

The report also noted that weak infrastructure was still 
seen as one of the important constraints to doing 
business in the Philippines and that substantial 
additional expenditures are required to bring the 
quality of infrastructure up to acceptable standards. 

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

Bank-supported projects have assisted the Government meet key transportation infrastructure needs and 
strengthen the management of the road network.  NRIMP1 (closed FY07): (a) updated 382 km of national 
roads; (b) conducted preventive maintenance on 721 km of national roads; (c) piloted performance based 
maintenance contracts on another 254 km; (d) helped establish the Road Board and Road Fund; and (e) 
made business process improvements in DPWH.  The follow up project, NRIMP2, was approved in FY08.  
The Bank-financed Metro Manila Urban Transportation Project improved access to the Marikina Valley 
and improved several intersection improvements on major thoroughfares.  The Bank is now focusing on 
larger private financing of transportation infrastructure in Metro Manila and the surrou nding areas together 
with IFC – the Light Rail Transit System Line 1 extension and the CALA highway. 

The Bank group is supporting the Government’s efforts to improve rural electrification by financing and 
strengthening rural Electrical Cooperatives, promo ting off-grid systems (e.g., solar power), and furthering

sector reforms through the Rural Power Development Program, GEF grants and IFC investments and 
advisory services.  Progress to date has been mixed.  Through advisory services, IFC has been able to bring 
in private generation in a number of SPUGs which are responsible for power in remote areas.  The Bank -
financed Rural Electrification Project has provided access to finance for Electrical Cooperatives through 
the Development Bank of the Philippines, with all of participating cooperatives having a debt-service 
coverage ratio of at least one.  All the funds are committed and 1,265 new customers have received 
electricity as of March 2008. A program to pilot the use of investment management contracts in Electrical 
Cooperatives with a partial guarantee is yet to get off the ground.   

In agriculture, the Diversified Farm Income and Market Development Project supports the transformation 
of Department of Agriculture into a service and market-oriented agency.  However, progress on reforms 
and implementation of the project has been slow.  The project enjoys strong support from the Department 
of Finance, Budget and Management and other core agencies.    

Finally, the Bank has been making the case for the need for p rivate investment and for ―strengthening the 
investment climate‖ through its AAA work, but it is difficult to assess whether it has had an impact. 

CAS Outcome: Productivity increased through local provision of infrastructure and services (Growth: 
Local Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 
Despite increase in LGU spending, wide 
disparities persist in coverage, quality, and 
availability of public services delivered by LGUs. 

Current Status 
While data does not exist to allow an analysis of 
service provision across LGUs, disparities most likely 
continue to persist between LGUs given their 
differences in resources and capabilities.  Projects 
supported by the Bank and other development partners 
are most likely having an impact in their participating 
LGUs. 

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

Bank funds are on-lent to LGUs through intermediaries for infrastructure and service improvements:  
LGFDP-Logofind through the Municipal Development Fund (MDFO) and SSLDIP through the Land Bank 
of the Philippines.  As of June 2008, 462 LGUs have obtained financing through the MDFO and an 
additional 653,141 households have gained access to basic infrastructure and services through LGPS-
Logofind.  As of July 2008, 27 projects are ongoing and another 40 are in the pipeline under SSLDIP. 

The Bank is also providing financing to the LGUs for water and sanitation improvements through the 
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) under the LGU -UWSSP2.  Under the project, water supply 
and sanitation improvements have been made or are ongoing in 12 LGUs, seven of which are being carried 
out as lease and management contracts, increasing private sector involvement in cities outside of Metro 
Manila.  A consumer assessment study carried out in 2008 found that 87 percent of respondents expresse d 
satisfaction with water services (compared to a target of 80 percent), 16 percent of households without 
sanitation showed improvement (compared to a target of 10 percent) and 46 percent of households were 
considered poor based on their self-reported income and provincial poverty thresholds.   

In addition, LGUs receive financing for rural roads and other local investments as participants in Bank -
financed sectoral projects. ARCDP2 provides financing for rural roads and bridges, small scale irrigation, 
potable water systems and facilities in agrarian reform communities.  MRDP2 provides financing for rural 
roads, communal irrigation and rural water systems in participating LGUs.  As of October 2007, agrarian 
reform communities that have participated in ARCDP2 for at least three years have reported a 21 percent 
increase in real income due to, among others, rural infrastructure improvements.

CAS Outcome: Catalyze private investment in key sectors including infrastructure  (Growth: Private 
Sector Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

As mentioned above, a fragile fiscal and debt 
position, perceived corruption, infrastructure 
weaknesses, concerns over law and order, and a 
sluggish financial system were seen as 
constraining investment.  Private provision of 
infrastructure was taking place in the power and 
in water and sanitation in Metro Manila.   

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

Low levels of investment continue to be a concern.  
Progress is being made in individual infrastructure 
projects involving the private sector. 

The Metro Manila Sewerage Projects financed by the Bank have supported the private provision of water 
and sanitation in Metro Manila.  The Third Manila Sewage Project provides financing through the Land 
Bank of the Philippines to the Manila Water Company Inc., one of the two concessionaires, for sewage and 
septic management.  In addition, the Bank has been promoting private management of water systems in 
cities outside of Metro Manila through the LGU -UWSP2.  

IFC is active in private provision of infrastructure.  IFC has invested in hydro-power generation in Magat 
and power-generation in Masinloc and provided technical assistance to rural electrical cooperatives in 
support of the Government’s power sector privatization.  IFC has inve sted in MWCI to help it develop new 
water sources, expand its water and sanitation services, and improve and maintain its network.  IFC is also 
advising the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA) on the extension of the LRT1 Line.  This project is 
designed as a public-private partnership with the Bank expected to provide financing for the public part.  

The Bank is supporting the preparation of additional operations to further private participation in 
infrastructure.  The Bank is exploring the possibility of supporting the expansion of the LRT1 line and the 
Cavite-Laguna (Cala) North-South Highway in transport.  Another effort, the MWSS Water Supply 
Distribution System Project with the second concessionaire, Maynilad Water Service Inc ., was dropped 
from the Bank’s pipeline because of availability of alternative sources of funding.  It is not clear whether 
the ongoing efforts in energy and transport will result in Bank operations, but the Bank has been providing 
important knowledge to the Government in overseeing and managing private participation in infrastructure 
as part of preparation. 

CAS Outcome: Improved performance of national institutions and increased access for the poor and 
disadvantaged groups to basic services  (Social Inclusion: National Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 
Lack of social inclusion was a serious obstacle to 
development.  Inequality remained high: the 
richest 5 percent of the households accounted for 
nearly one third of the national income while the 
poorest 20 percent accounted for only 6 percent.   

The poor were often not able to access quality 
public services, implying that they were likely to 
benefit less from national programs and subsidies, 
although they were more likely to rely on 
government services since they could not afford 
private alternatives (e.g., education, health care).  
The poor also suffered worse social outcomes.  
Compared to the richest 20 percent, the poorest 
20 percent of households had: (a) higher infant 

Current Status 
Despite high economic growth, poverty increased 
between 2003 and 2006.  While the Philippine 
economy grew at an average of 5 percent per annum 
since 2000, the poverty incidence increased from 30 
percent in 2003 to 32.9 percent in 2006 or the level in 
2000 (33 percent).  In 2006, 27.6 million Filipinos 
lived below the poverty level, more than ever before.   
Some of possible reasons for the drop are a fall in real 
incomes of households, economic growth which 
favored the corporate sector, and low government 
social spending caused by the fiscal crisis.       

The 2008 economic report noted that overall 
investment in developing the human capital of 
Filipinos through investments in health, education and

higher respectively; (b) 28 percent lower 
enrolment rates; and (c) 9 percent lower female 
literacy rates (ages 15-49).    

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

social protection is low, despite recent increases in 
spending in the social sectors. 

The Bank worked with national government agencies to improve access to basic social services for the 
poor, building on the experience gained in previous projects.  The Third Elementary Education Project 
(closed FY06) pilot tested innovative approaches such as school-based management.  Under TEEP, test 
scores and completion rates improved between 2003-05 at rates higher than non-project schools.   SEMP2 
(closed FY07) provided key inputs in education and health, supported community based services in the 
poorest barangays, and enhanced performance and governance in three soc ial sector departments (DepEd, 
DOH and DSWD). The project contributed to: (a) an improvement in the textbook to pupil ratio for math, 
science, English and Filipino from 1:2.5 in 2003 to 1:1.32 for elementary and 1:1.35 for high schools in 
2007; (b) improvement in the TB cure rate from 73 percent in 2003 to 82 percent in 2006; and (c) a 
reduction in measles from 7,194 cases in 2003 to 173 cases in 2006.  It also demonstrated the effectiveness 
of procurement reforms - ICB resulted not only in an improvement in quality but also a reduction in cost of 
46 percent. 

Both projects laid the foundations for sector wide approaches - NPS operations in Basic Education 
(approved FY06) and in Health (approved FY06).  Both operations support sector reform and efficiency 
improvements in DepEd and DOH respectively: i.e., school based management, teacher competency 
standards and reduction in disparities between schools for education; and increased enrolment of indigent 
people in the National Health Insurance Program, health services delivery (supply side) improvements and 
stronger regulations.  Start up of both projects is taking longer than planned so no results are available as 
yet. 

CAS Outcome: Greater voice and improved access for the poor and disadvantaged in planning and 
delivery of education, health, and other basic services at the local level  (Social Inclusion: Local Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

The 2008 economic report noted that there continues 
to be a pressing need to target human capital 
interventions to the poorest households.  It noted 
continued disparities in education and health service 
levels between developed and poor regions in the 
Philippines.   

In addition to disparities between the rich and 
poor (outlined above), disparities exists between 
different parts of the countries.  For example, 
poverty incidence in 2003 was 61 percent in the 
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao 
(ARMM) and 49 percent in Western Mindanao 
compared to a national average of 26 percent.  
Life expectancy in ARMM was 10 years lower in 
2000.   

Poor service delivery was seen as leading to lack 
of engagement in government by the poor, which 
in turn resulted in poorer services.   

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

The Bank has been engaging local communities directly in the delivery of local services and infrastructure, 
targeted to the poor.  Several Bank-financed projects take a participatory approach where local 
communities identify their priorities, with support from project and local government staff, and select 
project investments from a menu of options (generally including roads, water systems, school buildings, 
and other facilities).  These could be part of a national program, e.g ., promoting better natural resource 
management (CBRMP) or land reform (ARCDP2), or these could be community-driven operations, e.g.,

Appendix 1: FY06-09 CAS Results Summary 

Kalahi-CIDSS,  ARMM Social Fund, MRDP2, and the Mindanao Trust Fund.  The Kalahi -CIDSS is a 
national program targeted to the poorest provinces and municipalities.  The ARMM Social Fund, MRDP2 
and the Mindanao Trust Fund target Mindanao.  

These community oriented projects have had positive impact on beneficiaries.  Sixty-five percent of 
participating households in CBRMP experienced an increase in income (compared to a project target of 25 
percent).  Participating households in ARCDP2 are estimated to have experienced a 21 percent increase in 
real income three years after joining the project.  An economic analysis of Kalahi -CIDSS investments at 
mid-term estimated economic rates of return of 22 percent for rural (farm to market) roads and 65 percent 
for small water supply investments. 

CAS Outcome: Increased access to financing of micro-enterprises, cooperatives, and small and medium 
enterprises and increased private service delivery of basic social services  (Social Inclusion: Private Sector 
Platform) 

Status at CAS Design 

Current Status 

The poor were seen as not benefiting from 
economic growth.  While economic growth 
increased employment in the formal sector, a 
heavy pool of under-employed labor and new-
entrants kept the unemployment rate around 11 
percent.   

Bank Contribution & Lessons Learned: 

The Philippines continues to experience high 
economic growth.  Economic growth, however, has 
not led to significant employment generation: 
unemployment remained around 8 percent.   

The Bank provided credit to rural micro -, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through Rural Finance 3 
(closed FY08).  A total of 546 subloans were made to rural enterprises through the Land Bank of the 
Philippines for a total investment of Php 11.1 million, creating close to 17,000 jobs.  Another 114,902 
micro-loans for US$15 million were made to rural micro -enterprises through the People’s Credit and 
Finance Corporation.    

IFC is playing a role in small scale private sector development and the private sector provision to social 
services.  In 2008, IFC signed advisory agreements with a mid-tier commercial bank and the largest micro-
finance institution in the Philippines, both of which are interested in greater involvement with SMEs, under 
IFC’s SME Banking program.  IFC is advocating for increased private investment in Mindanao and is 
providing advisory services to the banana export industry in southeastern Mindanao with the overall 
objective of improving the take home pay of banana farmers .  In terms of social services, IFC has invested 
in Asia Hospital, serving Metro Manila, southern Cavite, Laguna, and Batangas.

World Bank FY09 Client Survey   
and CAS Multistakeholder Consultations 

World Bank FY09 Client Survey for the Philippines 

1. 
Background.  A Client Survey was conducted in August 2008, which was timed to provide 
some initial client perceptions prior to the face-to-face stakeholder consultations on the CAS.  The 
survey was designed to assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in 
the Philippines perceive the Bank, as well as use data to inform the CAS formulation process that the 
country team was about to embark on.  The survey asked about: overall attitudes toward the Bank; the 
importance of specific areas of the Bank’s work and the Bank’s effectiveness in those areas; the 
respondents’ level of agreement with the way the World Bank does business; general issues facing the 
Philippines; and the Bank’s communication and outreach efforts in the Philippines. 

2. 
Process. Approximately 1,500 stakeholders of the World Bank in the Philippines were 
invited, through mailed questionnaires, to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the 
country.  Participants in the survey were drawn from among national government officials or staff, 
local government officials or staff, members of Congress or staff, government -owned corporations or 
financial institutions, agencies implementing Bank-supported projects, bilateral and multilateral 
development agencies, private sector organizations or businesses, civil society organizations, the 
media, and members of academe or research institutes.  A total of 337 stakeholders participated in the 
client survey (22 percent response rate), mostly from the Government.  This response rate is a little 
higher than the standard response rate in the Philippines for mailed questionnaires, according to the 
local expert firm which handled the logistics for the survey.  The analysis of the results was conducted 
by the World Bank team in headquarters which supports the client surveys globally. 

3. 
Results.  The FY09 Client Survey results in the Philippines indicated that, overall: the Bank 
was very well regarded in the Philippines; the Bank’s work in the country was valued; and that 
stakeholders were eager for the Bank to be involved in the most critical development challenges facing 
the country.  The Bank was very well regarded in most areas including: relevance, results, and 
alignment with stakeholders’ development priorities; work on poverty; and in its collaboration with 
other development partners. Stakeholders were quite positive about the Bank’s work specifically in 
poverty. The Bank was considered responsive and collaborative with other donors. 

4. 
Areas of Focus.  In terms of areas of focus, the Client Survey indicated that corruption and 
poverty were considered the key development priorities in the Philippines; a plurality of stakeholders 
believed the Bank should focus primarily on corruption, followed by poverty.  Stakeholders clearly 
recognized the connection between corruption and poverty; when asked what would contribute most to 
poverty reduction, corruption and jobs emerge at the top of the list.  The results of the Philippines 
Client Survey demonstrated a clear interest in Bank involvement in supporting efforts to reduce 
corruption in the country, not only in terms of its overall support, but also, according to the data, in its 
knowledge and research. 

5. 
Value to the Clients.  In terms of value of the World Bank to the clients, the results indicate 
that the Bank is mostly valued for its lending to finance development projects.  The Bank’s knowledge 
is less valued in the Philippines than in many other countries surveyed.  The Bank’s greatest weakness 
is perceived to be its disregard of political realities on the ground and its bureaucratic way of 
conducting business that is not attuned to country conditions.

CAS Multistakeholder Consultations 

7. 
Background.  The multistakeholder consultations were the main instrument for early 
consultations about the key challenges and possible CAS themes.  Building on the experience in the 
past CAS period and on its regular outreach and dialogue activities, the Bank Group, together with the 
Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs, which are partnerships between the World Bank and 
leading state and private universities), organized multistakeholder consultation workshops across the 
country in September and October 2008.  These workshops involved national and local governments, 
civil society, the business community/private sector, academe, labor groups, and other development 
partners. 

8. 
Process. Four consultations were co-organized with the Ateneo de Naga KDC for the 
consultation in the Bicol Region; Central Philippine University KDC in Iloilo City for Central and 
Eastern Visayas; University of Southeastern Philippines KDC in Davao City for Mindanao; and Asian 
Institute of Management KDC in Makati City for Metro Manila and neighboring areas in Luzon. 
Participating in the consultations were 288 representatives, of which 42 percent was from government, 
36 percent from civil society, 16 percent from academe, 3 percent from the private sector; and 3 
percent from development partners. These representatives were chosen from the Bank’s wide network 
of contacts and partners at the national, regional, and local levels. 

9. 
The consultations provided a venue for a meaningful exchange of views with government and 
various stakeholders on the critical development challenges as well as policy options and programs 
that would address these challenges. They also helped increase government’s and stakeholders’ 
understanding of the Bank’s work in the Philippines.  Four questions were tackled in small group 
discussions, using a format called Knowledge Café. These questions referred to the causes of 
worsening poverty; causes of the inadequate performance of public institutions in delivering public 
services to citizens; priority programs that should be included in the new CAS; and issue s that the 
Bank should not be involved in. A consultant organization facilitated the workshop, and key s taff from 
the World Bank participated in the discussions. 

10. 
Results.  The issue of governance surfaced throughout all the four consultations. In the 
discussion of poverty, three causes were identified: bad governance, poor quality of education, and 
lack of livelihood and employment opportunities. In the discussion of the failure to deliver public 
services, governance-related causes were again identified, specifically corruption, weak citizen 
participation, weak leadership, and a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy. A wide range of solutions 
were recommended, including electoral reforms, strengthening local governments, streamlining the 
bureaucracy, decentralization, and increased investment in human capital. The priority areas 
recommended for the new CAS were along the same theme of governance: electoral reforms, 
transparency, and improving local governance. Also identified as priority areas were education, health, 
and social protection. The Bank, the participants said, should not engage in any form of political 
intervention and should not be involved in mining. 

11. 
The following is a summary of the key messages from the four regional multi -stakeholder 
consultations for the new CAS:

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 4 
Page 4 of 9 

A. 

Causes of Worsening Poverty and Recommended Solutions: 

Causes 
Bad governance, including: (a) the 
dysfunctional system of governance in 
BLGU, LGU, national governments; and (b) 
corruption at all levels of government 

Poor quality of education, particularly in the 
rural areas, results in high illiteracy rate, 
weak political voice, unemployment, and 
continuing poverty 

Lack of livelihood and employment 
opportunities 

Solutions 
 Continue education for electoral reforms (educate 
voters, communities) and promote strong political 
parties 
 Strengthen regulatory agencies (COA, CSC, etc) 
 Reform the justice system to make government 
officials accountable and impose corresponding 
punishment on corrupt officials 
 
Institute a well-defined transparency and 
accountability program within the Government and 
all its agencies 
 Set up an institute for leadership to train and 
educate, mentor and coach government leaders 
 Promote vigilance in the community; set up 
“community watch”  
 Make the national budget transparent and open to 
public scrutiny. If possible, this should be accessible 
on-line 

 Increase investments in human capital, particularly 
for health and education 
 Provide scholarships for formal and vocational 
training 
 
Improve the educational system and facilities 
(including training of teachers) 
 Lessen political intervention, particularly in hiring 
teachers 
 Provide incentives to students to increase their 
participation rate, such as the “Food for School 
Program”  
 
Improve statistical systems as planning and 
development tools for more responsive programs 
 Implement microfinance projects with social 
insurance and capacity building for micro enterprises 
 Develop livelihood opportunities in the rural 
areas to stop rural people from migrating to urban 
areas 
 Encourage big companies to practice corporate 
social responsibility 
 Pursue asset reforms (i.e., Agrarian Reform, 
Fisheries Program, Certificate for Ancestral Domains, 
etc) 
 Promote micro & SMEs to generate employment

B. 

Causes of the Inadequate Performance of Public Institutions and Recommended 
Solutions: 

Causes 
The prevalence of corruption at all levels, 
which results in the high cost of doing 
business. This is due to the lack of 
transparency in transactions and lack of 
community vigilance 

Lack of or weak citizen participation in all 
aspects of local governance 

Lack of professionalism and inadequate 
leadership and management capacities of 
political leaders and public servants 

Solutions 
 Ensure transparency and disclosure of public 
budgets, programs/projects and disbursement through 
posting of information, publication or on-line 
disclosure on the internet 
 Strengthen the current judicial system 
 Strengthen people’s participation and 
involvement in the identification and prosecution of 
corrupt officials 
 Ensure the active participation of business and 
private sector in anticorruption campaigns 
 Strengthen the auditing system  
 
Institutionalize close monitoring and regular 
evaluation of programs and projects 
 Cut red tape 
 
Increase corruption penalties 
 
Implement lifestyle checks and use results as 
basis for funding 
 Discourage solicitations from government 
personalities and institutions 
 Strengthen local development councils and local 
special bodies 
 Professionalize elective leaders 
 Upgrade qualification standards for elective 
officials 
 Focus support on lower-level government units 
and communities 
 Government should engage the private sector and 
civil society in identifying priorities that truly address 
development needs of the community 
 Provide continuous capacity building for NGOs 
and POs  
 Conduct values education and capacity building 
activities for government officials and workers 
 
Implement rewards-based performance system 
 Develop an integrated and institutionalized 
Performance Management System for government, 
e.g., public disclosure or report card system for 
national government agencies and LGUs (there are 
existing practices but should be done in all 
institutions) 
 Advocate for electoral reforms to make the 
appointment process transparent and based on merit 
and performance,   
 Advocate for civil service reforms, e.g., to 
improve compensation package for public servants 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FY09 Client Survey/CAS Multistakeholder Consultations  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 4 
Page 6 of 9 

Causes 
A bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that 
results in the lack of communication and 
coordination and hampers the delivery of 
public services 

Solutions 
 Streamline the bureaucracy – both in offices and 
processes 
 Further decentralize the governmental system in 
order to give rise to a more local government system 
 Shorten time in processing government 
transactions and lessen minimum requirements 
 Upgrade computer systems and maximize ICT 
infrastructure 
 Professionalize the bureaucracy by ensuring 
competitive salaries for civil servants 
 Better implement “rationalization policy” 

C. 

Proposed Priority Programs for the New World Bank CAS: 

 Basic education, health and other social services at the grassroots level. 
 Food sufficiency and security programs that will improve farm gate prices of the produce 
of farmers and promote collaboration between the government and private sector. 
 Capacity-building to improve local governance (e.g., institutionalization of social 
accountability mechanisms, replication and/or scaling up of and replication of best 
practices in local governance).  
 Programs that improve transparency and accountability in government agencies (e.g., 
strengthening of civil society participation in oversight roles, prosecution of erring public 
officials, etc.).  
 Electoral reforms to strengthen democratic processes (e.g., voters’ education).1 
 Social protection (e.g., poverty maps and improved targeting mechanisms and conditional 
cash transfers through municipal LGUs).2 

D. 

Issues that the World Bank Should Avoid: 

 Political intervention, whether engagement in partisan politics, giving in to political 
pressure or direct involvement in conflict resolution and the war against terrorism. 
 Mining. Large-scale mining is against sustainable development. “Responsible mining” is 
still a vague concept. In one consultation, however, a workshop group qualified its 
opposition as follows: “mining projects that are not supported by communities.”  
 Policy of government on the importation of goods. The rice importation program of 
government (DA) is a failure. At the same time, technologies developed in the Philippines 
have been copied by foreigners and Filipinos have ended up as consumers of goods 
produced by these technologies. 
 Human rights violations. The World Bank should not support or fund enterprises or 
industries that encourage human trafficking, sex slavery and those that employ minors. 
 Use of foreign consultants. The World Bank should minimize the use of  foreign 
consultants and maximize the use of local experts. 

1 While electoral reforms was suggested as a priority program for World Bank support, this recommend ation 
must be viewed against the concern of some participants that the World Bank should avoid engagement in 
partisan politics (see succeeding section on Issues that the World Bank Should Avoid).   
2 There were no objections to World Bank support for socia l protection in general. However, some participants 
expressed disagreement with CCT programs (see Section E: Issues Where There Were Divergent Views on 
World Bank Involvement).

E. 

Issues Where There Were Divergent Views on World Bank Involvement:  

Participants had divergent views on World Bank involvement in several issues. While many 
felt that the World Bank should avoid these issues, some participants felt that there was 
opportunity for World Bank involvement:  

 

 Policy making on bidding, procurement, taxes, tariff. While the majority felt that the 
World Bank should not be involved in policy-making, one participant disagreed that the 
Bank should refrain from engaging in issues such as taxation since, for example, the 
value-added tax, or VAT, has reaped many benefits.  
 Microfinance assistance with NGAs, LGUs.  One participant commented that one 
workshop group had recommended World Bank support for microfinance, while another 
group had recommended against World Bank support. Another participant clarified that 
there is no conflict because the other group had said that World Bank should not support 
microfinance implemented by the Government. 
 Partisan politics in 2010. Many felt that partisan involvement in the 2010 elections 
would erode the credibility of the World Bank. However, a participant commented that the 
World Bank could contribute to electoral reforms through: (a) policy reforms (e.g., putting 
in place a nomination process); (b)  examining the comparative advantages of a two-party 
vs. multi-party system; and (c)  leveling the playing field, e.g., supporting qualified 
candidates who do not have the resources to run. 
Indigenous peoples.  A participant sought clarification on why the World Bank should 
avoid issues related to IPs. Another participant responded that it is all right for the World 
Bank to help IPs as long as the cultural heritage of the latter is preserved.   
 Family planning programs. There was divergence in participants’ views whenever this 
issue was brought up in the regional consultations.  In Bicol, a participant commented 
(during the open forum) that one workshop group had objected to the Reproductive Health 
Bill, while another group had identified it as a solution to the problem. In the NCR 
consultation, while population control was identified as an issue that the World Bank 
should avoid, two measures were proposed for World Bank support to address the 
population issue: (a) pass laws on population control; and (b) include population education 
in World Bank projects. 
 Cash grants and subsidies. Sustained social security measures must be put in place 
instead. If conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are to be implemented, these should 
be implemented by municipal LGUs (who are closer to the ground) than provincial LGUs.  
 Project identification and prioritization. A participant clarified that, as an operating 
procedure, all projects approved by World Bank are proposed by national government and 
therefore, are assumed to be for the betterment of the nation. However, the World Bank 
should look into these projects and make sure that these are what the people really need. 

12. 
A detailed feedback report was sent to all the participants of the multistakeholder 
consultations and was posted on the Bank’s Philippines website to inform the public about the 
messages and recommendations.  A second round of meetings was held with top government officials 
and leaders from civil society organizations (CSOs) and private sector, as well as with other 
development partners, both bilateral and multilateral agencies in January 2009.  The meetings 
provided a venue for the Bank to present the issues it heard from the nationwide consultations and 
Bank management, and for the groups to give insights on key policy directions. The groups identified 
the need to factor in the economic and political climate on the magnitude, distribution, timing, and 
prioritization of lending and non-lending programs in the country. There is also an expressed interest 
in developing valid and reliable systems for collecting and analyzing data as the basis for development 
intervention as well as instituting a monitoring and evaluation system for deve lopment projects. The

groups indicated that critical to M&E system is the institutionalization of disclosure of information in 
the public sector. 

CAS Formulation and Consultation Process  

13. 
The CAS process was launched internally through a retreat of the Country Leadership Team in 
April 2008.  The discussions on the CAS then went through various stages of brainstorming, debating, 
working group discussions, government and external consultations, and 
internal reviews.  
Organizationally, a CAS leadership team and core team served as the nucleus for the work which, at 
many points, involved the entire country team.  

14. 
Following is a summary of major events that took place throughout the almost year -long CAS 
formulation and consultation process, including the major highlights of each activity.  In addition to 
the list below, a CAS team meeting was held on a bi-weekly basis during the period June 2008 to 
April 2009.  It should also be noted that many other external consultations happened through bilateral 
meetings with development partners and other stakeholders, as well as internal consultations through 
virtual meetings not captured in the table below.

Indicative World Bank Group (WBG) Program by Results Areas 

Strategic Objective 1: Stable Macro Economy 

MTPDP Goals: Maintain economic stability through further fiscal consolidation (improved revenue generation as well as 
strengthened expenditure management), rationalized national government spending for devolved services, and reduced debt. 

CAS Results Areas and Outcomes 

Indicative Financing and AAA /Other 

1.1 Fiscal and financial stability through 
consolidation and improved 
macroeconomic risk management 

Outcome 1: Maintain tax effort through 
strengthened tax administration and tax 
policy reform 

Outcome 2: Improved efficiency and 
targeting of public expenditures 

Outcome 3: Improved management of 
key fiscal and financial sector risks 

Ongoing Financing: (See Annex 5: Results Framework) 

Indicative Financing: 
 Development Policy Loan (DPL) 
 Development Policy Loan – Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL DDO) 

Indicative AAA/Others: 
 Philippines Development Reports 
 Quarterly Economic Updates 
 Programmatic AAA on Public Expenditure Issues 
 Development of the Philippines Statistical Development Plan (including 
grant to improve quality and usefulness of Philippine household surveys) 
 IFC Advisory Services (AS) on crisis/insolvency management 

1.1 Fiscal and financial stability through consolidation and improved macroeconomic risk 
management 

Indicative financing: The World Bank Group will support the objective of maintaining macroeconomic 
stability with a combination of instruments including rapid-disbursing financing, diagnostic AAA, economic 
monitoring, focused TA, and policy advice.  The close collaboration with other international financial 
institutions, in particular the IMF, will continue, and the Philippines Development Forum (PDF) will be 
used as a platform for dialogue in addition to regular policy discussions.  The Bank will use development 
policy operations in support of a strong reform program in government financial management .  Along with 
the ongoing National Program Support (NPS) for Tax Administration Reform, these operations can provide 
quick-disbursing financing.    

Indicative AAA/Others:  The regular economic monitoring reports and updates, as well as the annual 
flagship reports (which in the coming years could focus on topics such as the political economy of reforms 
and competition policy, governance, and medium-term development issues) will be supplemented by 
programmatic AAA on public expenditure management.  It will be essential to provide support (with the 
IMF) to the Government to assess and manage fiscal risks including debt.  The IFC may also provide 
advisory services to clients on crisis response and management of insolvencies.  Grants and trust funds will 
be provided to strengthen the statistical capacity in the country (e.g., in areas such as the drawing up of a 
statistical development plan; the quality, timeliness, and usefulness of household surveys; industrial surveys 
to improve the tax base; and national accounts). 

The Bank will generate selected briefing notes for the new administration which should ultimately lead to 
action-oriented policy briefs for the government on a range of topics covering all key results areas under the 
strategic objectives of the CAS.  The task would follow an intensive engagement approach which would 
entail encouraging public and policy debates on issues prior to the election, and put forward the Bank’s 
policy recommendations in an appropriate manner.  It would also link up with work on the next Medium-
Term Philippines Development Plan (MTPDP).

2.1  Enabling business environment to promote competitiveness, productivity, and employment 

Indicative financing: The outcomes in this result area are being supported by instruments in the ongoing 
WBG portfolio and will be further strengthened and deepened, as well as selectively broadened during the 
coming CAS period.  Several current projects support CAS objectives in the agricultural sector, 
infrastructure (transport and power, including in the rural areas), and rural development.  IFC is also 
involved in infrastructure, particularly in energy and in transport.  Going forward, envisaged transport 
projects under the CAS include Light Rail Transit 1 (South Extension) with Public-Private Partnership 
(PPP); Metro Manila/and other cities transport integration as a follow-up to MMUTRIP; and Cavite-Laguna 
tollway in a growing urban community as a model PPP.  In the energy sector, Rural Power APL2 will 
support implementation of the Electric Power Industry Reforms and Renewable Energy Act.  IFC 
participation will have a particular focus on renewable energy development including geothermal, and stress 
privatization of power generation.  WBG-financed projects will also focus on urban development and 
renewal (e.g., Metro Manila Cities); and, water supply at sub-national levels (with IFC).  Rural and area 
development objectives will be supported through: the Mindanao Development Project; support for 
agriculture and agribusiness (e.g., projects to improve market access, product quality, access to technical 
support services); and participatory development of irrigation.  IFC will work with clients to support supply-
chain linkages in agribusiness (e.g., bananas). 

Indicative AAA/Others:  Planned AAA will emphasize assessments of the investment climate and policies 
for greater private sector participation in investment, growth, and employment generation, particularly in 
underserved regions, poorer populations, and subsectors with high potential for development (including 
agriculture and agribusiness).  The findings of an ongoing study on infrastructure constraints to the 
development of the nonfarm sector will underpin activities.  The WBG will support the development and 
strengthening of the policy frameworks for trade facilitation, transport and logistics, energy efficiency, PPP 
regulations, legal and institutional settings, agrarian reform, agricultural productivity, urban strategy, and 
power sector reforms.  A proposed TA will pilot the use of country systems for environmental safeguards 
(including EA, physical cultural resources, natural habitats, and pest management) to institute good 
governance.  These activities are expected to be supplemented by grant funds and TF resources (e.g., PHRD 
grants, GEF) for project development and cofinancing, as well as for studies and TAs.  IFC’s Advisory 
Services will complement Bank efforts and fill gaps.  MIGA’s services and guarantees will continue to be 
on offer. 

2.2 Increased delivery and access to financial services 

Indicative financing: Outcomes in this results area will be supported by IBRD lending through a sub-
national finance project and a sub-sovereign financing facility in collaboration with IFC during the later 
years of the CAS.  These may include, among other components, increased provision of credit to 
creditworthy LGUs and the local private sector for the development of key infrastructure and services.  IFC 
has ongoing collaborations in the banking sector, and going forward, IFC envisages the promotion of risk 
sharing facilities to support sustainable energy investments; MSME finance; the provision of mortgage 
toolkits to financial institutions; enabling increased housing finance for middle-income families; and 
contributions to private bank financing of credit-worthy LGUs.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  Studies and TAs will explore a Financing Innovation Facility jointly with IFC 
(including components for a First Loss Facility for agriculture and agribusiness, and   Remittances for 
Development), and the implications of sub-national financing.  IFC Advisory Services will emphasize 
strengthening of the financial sector, SME banking, financing for sustainable and renewable energy projects, 
and improving the business environment. A weather-based (index) agricultural insurance system will be 
pilot-tested in at least one region.

 IFC Advisory Services 

3.1 Public service delivery in key sectors 

Indicative financing: Future IBRD financing in support of these outcomes will emphas ize the National 
Program Support (NPS) instrument for both health and education.  NPS for Education will increase access 
to quality basic education services and support the Basic Education Reform Agenda; and NPS for Health 
will finance budget items of the Department of Health in implementing the health sector reform agenda .  An 
innovative Output-Based Aid (OBA) Facility for Urban Services is proposed in FY10 to support the 
extension of water and sanitation service coverage through a connection charge subsidy for the poor.  
Current WBG support in this results area includes the ongoing education and health NPSs, the Second 
Women’s Health Project, and the Manila Third Sewerage Project (with supplemental GEF funding) .  Bank-
managed trust funds support sector objectives and projects as well as studies and technical assistance (e.g., 
AusAID support to Philippines Basic Education Reforms; European Commission TF for Health Sector 
Reform; a PHRD grant for Local Government Support for the Regional Water Supply Project, and a PPIAF 
grant for the Metro Iloilo Water District Options Study).  IFC is a partner of the Manila Water Company and 
the Asian Hospital.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  Programmatic AAA for both health and education are planned in the coming years 
(moving away from multiple small activities to a comprehensive AAA program to help in designing the 
proposed NPSs), as well as a study of best management practices in water pollution control.  IFC will 
contribute to a water sector strategy note.  Advisory Services and TA will emphasize strengthening the 
capacity for undertaking PPPs in the water and sanitation subsectors.   

3.2 Basic service delivery in poor areas 

Indicative financing: The key IBRD lending instrument will be the NPS for CDD (Community Driven 
Development) which will finance the scaling up of the existing KALAHI-CIDSS as a core approach to

poverty reduction through increased access to basic public goods and services in targeted poor communities.  
The operation will increase basic services to the poor such as community infrastructure, water supply and 
sanitation, education and health services, and community electrification; enhance community empowerment 
to engage LGUs in meeting basic needs; and, strengthen participation and accountability consistent with the 
Local Government Code.  Other donors and partners, including NGOs and civil society organizations, will 
also be supporting the CDD operation.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  The implementation of the current KALAHI-CIDSS is supported by two JSDF 
grants on strengthening the capacity of NGOs and community procurement, and a PHRD grant.  Urban CDD 
activities are supported through the Urban Partnership for Sustainable Upliftment, Renewal, Governance and 
Empowerment (UPSURGE) funded by a JSDF grant.  AAA tasks are planned to study issues relating to 
indigenous people, population growth, and the interactions and coordination among key poverty reduction 
interventions such as CDD, CCT, NPS, and sector reform programs. 

MTPDP Goal: Reduce poverty and increase welfare, particularly in rural areas; sustainably manage the environment and 
natural resources; reduce disaster risk and improve recovery management. 

Strategic Objective 4: Reduced Vulnerabilities

4.1  Social protection system 

Indicative financing: WBG will financially support the outcomes in this result area with a loan for the 
Government’s Social Welfare and Development Reform (SWDR) - Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) 
program.  The CCT will provide income support to the poor and protection from shocks, address 
deteriorating education and health indicators for the poor, and work on both the supply and demand sides of 
social services for the poor.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  Non-lending support for the SWDR program will be provided through TA to the 
Government in strengthening the design and implementation of the CCT program and the roll -out of the 
National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction.  The TA will assist in the proper operational 
implementation of these programs and support the intensive inter-agency policy dialogue that would be 
required for success.  Programmatic AAA for social protection and poverty reduction would undertake key 
pieces of new knowledge generation to advise the Government on policies and actions, conduct continued 
core poverty diagnostics, and provide a roadmap for the development of poverty monitoring systems and 
statistics.  This is particularly critical given the context of the unfolding global economic crisis.  IFC is 
currently partnering with several real estate and mortgage finance institutions that provide middle -income 
housing.  Future involvement will also be through support to credit financing agencies that cater to 
underserved clients. 

4.2  Disaster risk management and climate change 

Indicative financing: The CAS proposes increased IBRD financing for disaster risk management (DRM) 
including a disaster risk reduction Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) operation in FY11 
and related TAs.  The CAT-DDO would provide immediate liquidity for post-disaster reconstruction to 
allow for rapid recovery and encourage mitigation investments.  A drawdown option for LGUs that 
demonstrate commitment to implementing a DRM plan would be created.  Support for disaster mitiga tion 
activities, such as flood protection infrastructure, slope stabilization, and retrofitting of schools and hospitals 
in hazard-prone areas, could also be provided.  The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery 
(GFDRR) is funding a TA program to support LGUs to enhance their capacity to manage natural disasters 
and similar support is expected to continue.  Bank-managed trust fund resources are expected to address 
issues relating to land use-based climate change adaptation measures and assist the Philippines (along with 
other countries in EAP) to formulate strategies and programs to mitigate greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions 
from current land use practices (the major source of GhG in developing countries).  Global public funds, 
GEF, and bilateral trust funds  are also expected to continue the funding of selected high priority DRM and 
climate change mitigation/adaptation activities as at present.  Activities under consideration include 
improving energy efficiency of chillers to reduce carbon emissions, addressing climate change concerns for 
coastal areas and climate change impacts through waste management, groundwater management, and 
integrated management of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). 

Indicative AAA/Others:  AAA tasks will support the WBG financing program with studies related to both 
disaster risk management and climate change issues.  IFC Advisory Services will also be relevant in topics 
such as electrification and Renewable Energy Technologies (RET).  An innovative weather-based (index) 
agricultural insurance system will be pilot-tested.  The World Bank Institute (WBI) has considerable 
expertise and cross-country experience in these areas, and the partnership with the Philippines will be 
strengthened. 

4.3  Stability and peace 

Indicative financing: Currently, WBG resources to conflict-affected areas are being provided through 
several channels such as the Mindanao Rural Development Project Phase 2 (MRDP2), the Autonomous 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indicative World Bank Group Program by Results Areas  

            Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 6

Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Social Fund Project, and a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for 
Mindanao Reconstruction and Development Program.  Going forward, a Fund for Peace and Development 
is envisaged in the outer years of the CAS.  The fund would reduce gaps in development assistance, improve 
basic services and livelihoods in vulnerable areas, achieve convergence in the implementation of various 
assistance approaches, and strengthen the pivotal role of LGUs as the focal point for peace and development 
assistance in their municipalities.  A Mindanao Development Project could also be pursued to further 
strengthen infrastructure and basic services.  It is expected that some IFC operations would include activities 
(such as in the energy sector) in the area.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  A key piece of AAA will focus on the topic of encouraging more resilient 
communities in conflict-affected areas in the Philippines to enhance the understanding of local conflict 
dynamics and typologies, develop a more harmonized and conflict-sensitive framework for CDD 
approaches in line with those at use by the Bank and others, and strengthen LGU capacity for development 
planning and project execution with improved governance in targeted conflict-affected areas.  GEF and 
various TF resources are expected to continue their support for preparatory work and various project 
components or stand-alone activities.   

Cross-Cutting Theme: Good Governance 

MTPDP Goals: Strengthen partnerships and accountability among government, civil society, and the private sector; fully 
operationalize the Government Electronic Procurement System; conduct integrity development reviews in government 
agencies, and expand and institutionalize lifestyle-checks.

(GIFMIS) 
 Local Government Unit Performance Grants/ Capacity Building fo r Local 
Government 

Indicative AAA/Others: 
 TA for Agency Institutional Strengthening 
 Programmatic AAA on Sector Governance Assessments (for various sectors/ 
SOs - Strategic Objectives) 
 Support for Procurement Reforms (including update of Country Procurement 
Assessment Report – CPAR, and study of Approved Budget for Contract 
(ABC) effectiveness) 
 Public Finance Management (Government Integrated Financial Management 
Information System –GIFMIS; Department of Budget Management – DBM; 
Bureau of Treasury – BTr; Budget Watch) 
 Programmatic AAA on Decentralization (e.g., revenue mobilization) 
 IFC Advisory Services (e.g., ‘Doing Business’, sub-national ‘Doing 
Business’, Business Enabling Environment - BEE, regulatory simplification, 
Corporate Social  Responsibility 

5.1  Governance and anticorruption in selected national government agencies 

Indicative financing: A World Bank-financed Judicial Reform Support Project (JRSP) has been under 
implementation since 2004.  Under the CAS, a second JRSP operation is proposed for FY12.  A proposed 
grant-funded TA for Agency Institutional Strengthening would support selected agencies to develop 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indicative World Bank Group Program by Results Areas  

            Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 6 
Page 8 of 8 

coherent institutional development and anti-corruption plans, and provide technical support for their 
implementation.  The focus will be on strengthening the agencies’ core PFM and procurement functions, but 
could also include broader institutional development needs on a case-by-case basis.  The TA would 
complement ongoing or planned lending operations (such as the NPSs in the social sectors) to reinforce 
Bank support for strengthening governance systems.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  Selected institutional strengthening efforts would be pursued through the use of 
TFs (including IDFs) as at present, and IFC would also address the issue of reducing corruption through 
dialogue related to its transactions.  A programmatic AAA is planned for Sector Governance Assessments for 
some selected sectors. 

5.2  Procurement and public financial management reforms at national and local levels 

Indicative financing: The WBG has an active dialogue and engagement on procurement issues related to 
the implementation of the Bank-financed and managed portfolio of operations.  To support the PFM 
outcomes under this results area, the WBG will finance a Government Integrated Financial Management 
Information System (GIFMIS) Project in FY11 focusing on integrating core FMIS for the Department of 
Budget Management (DBM), Bureau of Treasury (BTr), line agencies, and possibly the Commission on 
Audit (COA).  The Bank will continue to support the implementation of the Government’s procurement 
reforms and procurement systems (including e-procurement). 

Indicative AAA/Others:  The ongoing programmatic AAA on PFM Reform Support would continue with 
the details and outputs to be determined during annual concept and progress reviews.  Future subjects could 
include government-wide and specific PFM issues, PEFA updates, agency-PEFAs, agency budget 
management reviews, topical PFM workshops, and PFM policy notes.  IDFs currently support the 
Professionalization of Public Procurement Practitioners, the implementation of the Government’s e-
procurement system, and capacity building of COA; similar and other TF-funded activities will continue 
during the CAS period.  Follow-up support for the implementation of the main recommendations of the 
Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) accounting and auditing will continue. 

5.3 Better local governance through effective decentralization 

Indicative financing: LGU performance grants and capacity building for local government will spearhead 
WBG efforts to support better governance through decentralization in addition to various sub -national and 
local level components in other Bank engagements.  The activity would build core competencies of the 
LGUs in financial management, procurement, planning, and administrative functions by linking incentives 
to the achievements of pre-identified performance targets.  A secondary objective would be to target poorer 
provinces to help them bridge the growing gaps within LGU groupings.   

Indicative AAA/Others:  A series of reports on various aspects of decentralization in the Philippines and its 
effectiveness under the current design of intergovernmental arrangements will be undertaken within a 
programmatic AAA.  Programmatic AAA will also be undertaken on sector governance assessments . 
Analytical work will underpin the development of a country action plan for demand for good governance.  
Local government capacity strengthening will be supported through a TA focusing on support to LGUs for 
implementing difficult investments, (e.g., PPP), complex projects, and institutional reforms.  Trust funds, 
including IDFs, currently support various LGU capacity strengthening activities, governance performance 
frameworks, and CSO/NGO effectiveness, and such support will continue.  

Note: Support through multidonor trust funds and global funds such as GEF, PPIAF, Carbon Finance Funds, Cities Alliance, Water 
and Sanitation Program, Private Enterprise Partnership (IFC), and others is not necessarily all reflected in this annex. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Annex 7 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) Programs  
in the Context of the CAS 

1. 
This Annex provides an overview of major official development assistance (ODA) activities 
in the Philippines, organized according to the four strategic objectives and one cross-cutting theme of 
the CAS.  The mapping was based on records of ODA programs from the National Economic and 
Development Authority (NEDA), as well as updates from the ODA agencies.  The purpose of this 
Annex is to present an overview of the broad distribution of ODA activities along the CAS objectives 
and results areas to help indicate areas where there is potential for further Bank engagements, as well 
as where the role of the Bank Group needs to be delineated against that of other ODA partners. 

2. 
Based on NEDA figures as of December 2008, Japan provides the largest portion of ODA to 
the Philippines, accounting for approximately 43 percent of the total ODA net commitments of around 
US$9.7 billion.  The Bank ranks second (tied with the Asian Development Bank) with a 16 percent 
share.  Together, Japan, ADB and the World Bank Group provide an estimated 75 percent of all ODA 
to the Philippines.  China, which is ranked fourth, accounts for 11 percent of the total ODA.  The 
remaining 14 percent is comprised of ODA from other agencies, mostly bilateral organizations which 
provide grants to the national government, local governments, communities, and/or to NGOs under 
their respective programs/strategies. 

3. 
It should be noted that the mapping presented in this Annex may not capture activities of 
development partners which have smaller programs in the Philippines.  In addition, many development 
partners participate in the policy dialogue under the Philippines Development Forum (PDF), which 
may not be captured in specific programs or projects reflected in the matrix (see Attachment 1).  Thus, 
it should be stressed that this write-up is not necessarily a comprehensive picture of all the 
development partners active in the Philippines, nor of the areas of involvement of the development 
partners. 

Strategic Objective 1:  Stable Macroeconomy 

4. 
The ADB, Australia, Japan, Sweden and the USA are the major development partners with 
strategies/thrusts that directly support macroeconomic stability through technical cooperation, grants, 
project loans, and/or policy-based program loans that relate to tax revenues, tax administration, tax 
policies, finance and public expenditure management, and management of fiscal and financial sector 
risks. ADB-financed Development Policy Support Programs (DPSP) and TA projects support policy 
reforms related to, among others, revenue administration, macroeconomic management, and public 
expenditure issues.  Japan, through its Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has recently 
committed to co-finance the ADB-financed DPSP.  JICA also supports customs administration 
reforms at the Bureau of Customs.  USA supports tax and customs administration reform, revenue 
forecasting, and budget oversight management.  Sweden has a small grants program in support of tax 
policy and tax-related statistics work with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) which is coordinated 
under the same framework as the Bank-financed National Program Support for Tax Administration 
Reform.  Australia has supported various relevant work under its Partnership for Economic 
Governance Reforms program, and has assisted the BIR in putting together the results framework for 
the Tax Administration Reform project, as well as provided capacity-building for the BIR. In addition, 
Australia has partnered with the World Bank Group on joint analytical work related to public 
expenditure management, an area with strong potential for continuing partnerships.  The IMF is also 
involved in this strategic objective through its ongoing annual Article IV consultations, and it is

expected that the World Bank Group will coordinate with the IMF on financial sector assessments as 
well as on the policy advice and TA that the IMF provides to the Government on tax administration 
reforms and other related matters.  Aside from partnerships on specific operations, the World Bank 
Group coordinates at the policy level with all the active players in this area through its co-chair role in 
the PDF Working Group on Fiscal and Economic Reforms. 

Strategic Objective 2:  Improved Investment Climate 

5. 
Given the broad coverage of the CAS results area of Enabling Business Environment to 
Promote Competitiveness, Productivity and Employment, this area has the biggest confluence of ODA 
programs.  The programs which support this results area include those of ADB, Australia, China, 
France, Korea, Japan, and the UK which support relatively large infrastructure projects such as 
national roads/highways, railways, airports, fish ports, rural roads, bridges, irrigation, water supply 
and sanitation projects, power and rural electrification, including power sector reforms through a 
program loan by ADB. Additional bilateral support for infrastructure is coursed through global 
programs administered by the Bank, such as the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility 
which is a multi-donor technical assistance facility aimed at helping developing countries improve the 
quality of their infrastructure through private sector involvement, and (specifically for the water 
sector) the Water and Sanitation Program. The EC and Canada have trade facilitation and other 
trade-related assistance that support the country’s overall investment climate and competitiveness.  
Other partners, such as the USA and the UN, support activities that indirectly address productivity, 
livelihood, and competitiveness through various entry points such as support for agricultural 
productivity, youth employability, sustainable livelihoods, community enterprises, and other 
interventions mostly at the grassroots level.  Canada and Australia have provided support to the 
World Bank Group through the IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership facility for small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs). The World Bank Group, including through, as well as jointly with IFC programs, 
seeks to increase private sector investments in infrastructure through actual investment operations, 
promotion of public-private partnerships, and support to SMEs and micro-enterprise growth. 

6. 
On Financial Services, ADB is assisting in financial market regulation and intermediation 
through a program loan, as well as capacity building for housing micro-finance, while Spain and USA 
are supporting micro-enterprise development through various types of projects. Germany is 
supporting various credit lines to private financial institutions for the SME sector, as well as on-
lending through government financial institutions to local governments for local infrastructure needs.  
. All these related programs to improve the investment climate are being coordinated at the policy 
level through the PDF working groups on Growth and Investment Climate and on Infrastructure, 
which are co-chaired by the World Bank Group and by Japan respectively. 

Strategic Objective 3:  Better Public Service Delivery 

7. 
ADB, Australia, Canada, EC, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Spain, UN, and the 
USA all have programs that focus on Public Service Delivery in Key Sectors specifically related to 
health, education, water and sanitation services. The ADB, Australia, EC, Germany and the USA 
have substantial programs in the health sector.  The ADB, aside from technical assistance, is funding a 
health project which was recently restructured to support the same health sector reform agenda 
supported by the World Bank Group under the National Program Support for the Health Sector 
Reform Agenda. Australia’s investment in health is focused on maternal and child health, 
reproductive health and malaria prevention, delivered through partnerships with UN agencies. The EC 
is funding two ongoing trust funds administered by the World Bank Group to support implementation 
of health sector reforms in selected provinces, one specifically for Mindanao provinces. In the basic 
education sector, Australia is providing support to the Philippine Basic Education Reforms through a 

 
 
 
 
ODA Programs in the Context of the CAS  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 7  
Page 3 of 6 

jumbo trust fund administered by the World Bank Group as well as through projects to improve the 
quality of access to basic education in Mindanao and the Visayas, including specifically for Muslim 
education and disadvantaged groups. USA’s assistance in education is aimed at increasing access to 
quality basic education for children. For both the health and education sectors, the World Bank Group 
is financing budget support-type operations within the framework of the Government’s reform 
agendas for the sector.  The other development partners mentioned above support a variety of 
interventions (loans, grants, analytical and advisory activities, and technical assistance/cooperation) to 
support access to basic services at the national and local government levels, and at the community 
levels.  

8. 
In terms of the results area of Basic Service Delivery in Poor Areas, almost all partners are 
involved:  ADB, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, EC, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, 
UN, and the USA.  The programs include various forms of assistance targeted at poor 
communities/municipalities/cities/provinces/regions, including agrarian reform communities.  Many 
of the programs/activities are directly related to addressing the MDGs, particularly on health, 
education and poverty levels. Programs in health and education (as well as social protection) are 
coordinated at the policy level through the PDF Working Group on MDGs and Social Progress, of 
which the Bank is an active member. The Banks’ major engagement in this results area is through 
support to the nationwide community-driven development project (KALAHI) which provides 
opportunities for closer partnerships in targeted communities, as well as in enhancing effectiveness of 
public service delivery through more coordinated area-based approaches. 

Strategic Objective 4:  Reduced Vulnerabilities 

9. 
The results area of Social Protection System is one where there are no other major ODA 
programs in place that directly address social protection systems, although Australia, EC, Germany, 
New Zealand, Spain, UN, and USA have various activities that support increased and more equitable 
access to basic social services by the poor and the vulnerable, as well as programs specifically targeted 
to vulnerable groups such as children, women, the poor, and indigenous peoples.  In particular, the EC 
is supporting the Philippines Health Insurance Corporation to increase financial protection of the poor.  
In terms of analytical work, the ADB has an ongoing technical assistance for the assessment of 
poverty reduction which would be an important analytical tool for designing and targeting social 
protection systems. The Government’s  Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program is envisioned to 
serve as the framework for all ODA support to social protection. The upcoming World Bank-
supported Social Welfare and Development Reform Project is expected to be the major ODA program 
in the social protection area. In partnership with the Bank, Australia is providing technical assistance 
to strengthen the design of the CCT pilot’s targeting and other related operational mechanisms. 

10. 
Relatively fewer partners have specific programs/thrusts relating 
to Disaster Risk 
Management -- Australia, Japan, EC, Spain, and the USA.  Such projects include Australia’s 
support for geo-hazard mapping and building disaster risk management capacity in the Philippines; in 
addition, Australia is also supporting the Bank’s Global Fund for Disaster Risk Reduction.  On the 
more general area of climate change and environment, ADB, Australia, Germany, Korea, Spain and 
the UN support specific programs that help address these issues including environmental programs, 
water resources or river basin management, and programs that address sustainable development and 
management of natural resources at the national, local and community levels. The EC is considering 
providing some support to climate change adaptation, and depending on the specific focus, this could 
be a potential area for partnership with the World Bank Group. The Netherlands is co-financing the 
Bank-supported Laguna de Bay institutional strengthening project.  Various bilateral organizations are 
supporting climate change initiatives through multi-donor global programs such as the Global 
Environment Facility, the Global Climate Change Fund, and the Carbon Finance Funds 

 
 
 
 
ODA Programs in the Context of the CAS

administered by the Bank and for which specific activities in the Philippines are ongoing and planned.  
The PDF Working Group on Sustainable Rural Development, of which the Bank is a member,  
facilitates the policy coordination for ODA-supported environmental programs/projects. 

11. 
On Stability and Peace, Australia, Canada, EC, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, 
Sweden, UN and the USA have active programs that support the peace and development of Mindanao, 
as well as other interventions related to conflict-affected areas through community-driven 
development. Some of the support is provided through the multi-donor Mindanao Trust Fund 
administered by the World Bank Group (with contributions from Australia, Canada, EC, New 
Zealand, Sweden and the US), as well as through the development partners’ own programs. 
Assistance may be in the form of targeted programs for specific areas in Mindanao and/or for specific 
sectors in Mindanao.  The range of programs include almost all types of interventions -- from large to 
small-scale infrastructure, from national government- to LGU- or community-based assistance, from 
sector-specific operations (e.g., health, education) to cross-sectoral operations, from livelihood to 
institution-building activities, and from post-conflict to peace and development interventions. The 
Bank plays an active role in coordinating ODA for Mindanao in partnership with the Government and 
other ODA partners as co-chair of the PDF Working Group on Mindanao, as well as through 
chairmanship of the steering committee for the Mindanao Trust Fund. 

Cross Cutting Theme:  Good Governance 

12. 
Under the cross-cutting theme of Good Governance, many development partners are involved 
but spread out across the three results areas.  Under Governance and Anticorruption in Selected 
Agencies, ADB, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, and the USA are providing assistance 
to specific agencies.  The ADB has a large Justice Sector Reform program loan, while Canada and the 
USA are providing support for other related interventions (mediation, alternative dispute resolution, 
legal education reform, etc.).  Since a strong civil service has a positive impact on good governance, 
Japan’s support through JICA to the BIR in human resource development aspects and Korea’s 
program for capacity building in policy development and public administration covering various 
agencies are mapped under the governance agenda.  Australia is providing parallel support to the 
World Bank-supported Land Administration Project which has a strong governance aspect, and is 
supporting enhanced supervision of the World Bank-financed roads project.  In addition, Australia is 
providing support for the design and pilot test of governance and anticorruption measures relating to 
the upcoming World Bank-supported Social Welfare and Development Reform Project, which would 
be a major program for which the anticorruption component would be key to success.  Coordination of 
ODA programs/projects at the policy level is undertaken through the PDF Working Group on 
Governance and Anticorruption, of which the Bank is an active member. 

13. 
On Procurement and Public Financial Management Reforms, ADB, Canada EC and Korea 
have limited, but strategic, involvement in the area.  Canada will be supporting an ICT component of 
the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) operations, while Australia and the EC are 
actively supporting PFM reforms through various grants. ADB has ongoing technical assistance to 
strengthen the Government’s electronic procurement system, and a separate technical assistance to 
support the harmonization agenda which is primarily focused in this results area.  Many other partners 
participate more actively in the policy dialogue through the sub-group on procurement co-chaired by 
the Bank under the PDF Governance and Anti-Corruption Working Group. 

14. 
The results area of Better Local Governance Through More Effective Decentralization is 
another area where multiple partners are engaged, and the forms of engagement include technical 
assistance for local planning and expenditure management, local government financing, and budget 
reforms at the provincial and municipal levels. Active development partners here include ADB, 

 
 
 
 
ODA Programs in the Context of the CAS  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 7  
Page 5 of 6 

Australia, Austria, Canada, EC, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, UN and the USA.  ADB 
has a program loan and technical assistance for local government financing, and budget reforms.  
Canada continues its long term assistance through its local governance support program currently in 
the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and for local economic development.  Also, Canada 
and Spain are planning to provide funding for a Dialogue Fund, to be administered by the World Bank 
Group, to support the decentralization and local government agenda. The World Bank Group plays a 
key role in coordinating the dialogue on decentralization through its co-chairmanship of the PDF 
Working Group on Local Government and Decentralization. 

15. 
The following matrix indicates the presence of ODA partners in each strategic objective and 
results area of the CAS. Overall, it will be noted that there are some results areas where there is a 
proliferation of ODA activities while in others there may be only a few.  This could be due to the large 
financing requirements in one sector relative to others, as well as the availability of government 
financing and/or private sector assistance in some areas compared to others. Because of the varying 
degrees of detail available for each organization’s programs (some have general strategic thrusts while 
others include details up to the activity level), the mapping does not differentiate on the levels of 
involvement of the various development partners, but should be able to give a snapshot of the presence 
of ODA in each strategic objective and results area.

Philippines Harmonization Agenda  

Procurement Reform 

1. 
Procurement reform continues to be pursued by its champions in the Government since the 
passage of the Government Procurement Reform Act in January 2003.  The commitment to 
sustaining progress in the pursuit of reform has been clearly demonstrated since the passage of the 
Procurement Law, and has benefited from the Bank’s continuing technical assistance and financial 
support. 

2. 
The Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) has developed as an active, efficient 
and effective procurement policy oversight body. The GPPB has so far issued more than 70 rules that 
clarify and interpret provisions of the Procurement Law to aid implementation at the agency and local 
government levels. The Bank supported the creation of the GPPB and its early years of operation through 
a US$300,000 IDF grant that closed in 2005. 

3. 
The Government has standardized and harmonized with ADB, JBIC and WBG 
procurement documents and forms, which are now being used in all ODA assisted projects.  The 
Procurement Law requires the development of standardized procurement documents and forms.  
Moreover, the country is a signatory to the 2003 Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness that calls for 
harmonization and alignment to achieve better aid effectiveness, and has also endorsed the Accra Agenda 
for Action to further strengthen development  effectiveness. The Government harmonized with the three 
development partners successively the Philippine Bidding Documents in August 2005 and the Generic 
Procurement Manuals in July 2007. With only a few differences with international procurement practice, 
as recorded in the 2007 CPAR,  the country’s public procurement system can now be described as 
substantially aligned with international standards.   In supporting the attainment of these initiatives, the 
Bank has provided Technical Assistance to the GPPB through an ASEM grant of US$796,000 that closed 
in 2007. 

4. 
Efforts by the Government to improve transparency in procurement biddings include the 
operationalization of the central E-Government Procurement (e-GP) portal and participation of 
civil society observers in the bidding process.  The Government operates a central e-GP portal, the 
Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS), for all procurement biddings.  The 
World Bank and Asian Development Bank carried out an assessment of its acceptability for MDB-funded 
procurement in November 2006, leading to an agreement to modify five areas of the system to suit MDB 
Procurement Guidelines. The five changes were substantially completed. Six implementing agencies have 
conducted a pilot harmonization program of e-GP system application.  The PhilGEPS provides, under its 
Phase 1, a centralized web portal for publication of notices, registration of suppliers, issuing procurement 
documents, and publication of contract awards. The Bank approved an IDF grant of about US$300,000 in 
2008 to develop Phases 2 to 5 which will expand the capacity of the system to virtual store, e -payment, e-
charging of fees,  and e-bidding.  The law requires every bidding process to be observed by civil society 
representatives.  While there is a challenge in sustaining this requirement of the law, there are CSOs that 
are committed.  A JSDF was recently approved with a funding of about US$1 million to find ways of 
strengthening GPPB and the Transparency Accountability Network (TAN) towards providing appropriate 
incentives to the CSO observers in local and community procurement.  

5. 
The GPPB, having a vital role in monitoring implementation of the procurement law, has 
also initiated moves to strengthen procurement monitoring and evaluation which significantly 
improve transparency in procurement activities.  GPPB monitors procurement performance of 

 
Philippines Harmonization Agenda  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 9 
Page 2 of 6 

government agencies through three channels: (a) Online Monitoring and Evaluation System – a self-
monitoring tool for agencies online at www.gppb.com to find out their level of compliance with the law; 
(b) Agency Compliance and Performance Indicator System, a set of indicators based on the OECD-DAC 
Baseline Indicator System, which assess the performance of an agency compared with a set of 
internationally accepted good procurement practices; and (c) e-procurement system, through PhilGEPS. 
In promoting transparency, PhilGEPS now posts procurement notices by more than 50 percent of all the 
agencies and local government units (excluding barangays or the lowest unit of government).  More than 
15 percent of them have started posting the award notices as well, including 90 percent of the GPPB 
member agencies.  Most recently, the Transparency Accountability Network (TAN) developed a 
monitoring system that would encourage each agency to maintain good records management systems 
such that documents evidencing the procurement process will be available for scrutiny by the civil society 
members.  The project is financed by a portion of the recently completed IDF grant on Strengthening 
Internal Audit Units. 

6. 
Recognizing the importance of effectively enforcing the intent of the Procurement Law, the 
Bank and the Government supported programs to strengthen the procurement audit systems.  The 
Bank’s IDF of US$300,000 which closed in June 2008, supported the “Strengthening of Internal Audit 
Units toward Effective Procurement Monitoring and Enforcement”.  It was executed by the Presidential 
Anti-Graft Commission under the Office of the President.  The IDF funded activities that produced: a 
mapping of the quality of existing internal audit units, a generic internal audit manual (GIAM), a 
certification study for government internal auditors, and a procurement record monitoring system from 
the perspective of CSO observers.  The GIAM has been accepted by the Bank as substantially meeting 
international standards for the practice of internal auditing.  Moreover, the Bank in its July 2008 letter 
informed the Government that the GIAM will be prescribed to agencies implementing Bank-assisted 
projects as part of project financial management arrangements, and as an anticorruption measure. A new 
IDF grant for the strengthening of Commission on Audit (COA) intends to provide financial resources for 
the development of a Procurement Audit Guide for COA auditors to provide guidance on audits 
appropriate for the new public procurement system. The grant is being executed by COA. 

7. 
The Bank supported a capacity building program for marginalized communities and local 
government units to improve their know-how in correctly applying the Procurement Law in their 
bidding processes.  The Procurement Law covers all units of government including local government 
units and communities or barangays.  While officials and staff of national agencies have easy access to 
training, procurement practitioners in the LGUs and barangays have difficulty in availing good 
procurement training. Moreover, they have found it difficult to apply the Procurement Law correctly.  To 
address this issue, and as agreed in the 2007 CPAR, a capacity building project involving marginalized 
communities and LGUs will be supported by the Bank.  A JSDF grant of about US$1 million was 
recently approved to support the activities of the project.   

8. 
Good fiduciary practices have now been increasingly linked with governance and 
anticorruption measures and have found their way to a number of strategies applied in various 
Bank-financed projects.  Innovative anticorruption measures were included in the National Road 
Improvement Management Project (NRIMP) including the use of an independent procurement evaluator, 
civil society observers in bidding and contract implementation called the Road Watch, and the 
strengthening of internal audits.  A Generic Internal Audit Manual with focus on procurement audit 
programs was completed in June 2008 and is now being used in the Departments of Public Works and 
Highways, Education, and Social Services.  Project Appraisal Documents (PADs) include an annex on 
how to address the issue of governance and anticorruption and a governance and anticorruption team in 
the World Bank Office has been established.  In the Department of Education, the Bank-financed Third 
Elementary Education and the National Program Support for Elementary Education have used CSOs as 
observers in the bidding process.  Moreover, CSOs such as the G-Watch, Boys’ and Girls’ Scouts, 

 
 
 
 
Philippines Harmonization Agenda  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 9 
Page 3 of 6 

NAMFREL, and others, have participated in the Textbook Count ensuring that the books are delivered to 
schools.  

9. 
The Government, together with the WBG, ADB, and JBIC, has raised the bar in achieving  
harmonization, standardization, simplification and alignment of procurement rules and procedures 
through the recent move of revising the existing Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of 
Republic Act (RA) 9184 with the view of having only one IRR instead of the previous two IRRs.  In 
2003 when the IRR of the law was first crafted, there were major differences between the legislative 
framers of the law and the development partners funding foreign assisted projects, such as the ADB, JBIC 
and WBG.  The IRR, which is supposed to cover all types of procurement regardless of funding source, 
ended up as an IRR-A covering only domestically funded projects, with foreign assisted project 
procurement to be covered by an IRR-B, which has not yet been formulated.  From 2003 to 2008, 
procurement reform made significant progress 
towards greater standardization, simplification, 
harmonization, and alignment.  In the April 2008 Philippine Development Forum, the Government and 
the development partners agreed to formulate the IRR-B for foreign-funded projects.  The preparation of 
IRR-B promoted greater harmonization, simplification of rules, rendering the IRR -A obsolete and 
therefore needing major revisions.  As such, the GPPB decided to consolidate the two sets of IRRs for 
foreign and locally funded projects into a single IRR which it intends to adopt formally during the next 
PDF meeting in April 2009.   

10. 
To ensure that the civil service has the capacity to deliver under the new public 
procurement system, the law mandated the professionalization of the procurement function.  The 
GPPB, through the support of an ongoing IDF grant of US$300,000, has contracted the Asian Institute of 
Management to develop the modules for a certification program for procurement practitioners.  These 
modular training programs are expected to be offered by accredited learning institutions leading to 
certification as  procurement professionals.  The parameters of the certification program have been agreed 
with the Civil Service Commission and discussions are underway on the establishment of objective 
qualification standards for procurement positions in government. Once these standards have been 
established and adopted by the Civil Service Commission, only certified procurement practitioners will be 
eligible for government procurement positions.  

11. 
The Bank has nominated the Philippines as a candidate in the Piloting Program on the Use 
of Country System given the Government’s proven commitment to procurement reform and the 
demonstrated successes achieved so far.  With proven government commitment to reform, and 
demonstrated successes in harmonization and alignment, substantial use of country systems has been 
accepted by development partners in the procurement arrangements of projects financed by them. Only a 
few differences with international procurement practice were recorded in the 2007 CPAR. The country 
has also scored well in the OECD-DAC Baseline Indicator System.  Thus, the country’s public 
procurement system can be described as substantially aligned with international standards for the use of 
National Competitive Bidding method. The Bank, in December 2008,  nominated the Philippines as a 
candidate for the Piloting Program on the Use of Country System (UCS).  The UCS intends to cover the 
procedures for International Competitive Bidding.  

Financial Management and Public Expenditure Management  

12. 
Recent changes in Bank policies have enabled the Bank to place greater reliance on 
countries’ financial management systems, including budgeting, financial reporting, and external 
auditing.  The Bank has issued guidelines that strongly encourage the use of country systems in the 
public financial management (PFM) area when circumstances permit.  Indeed, the default position in 
Bank-financed operations is to use existing PFM institutional frameworks unless the country context 

 
 
 
 
Philippines Harmonization Agenda  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 9 
Page 4 of 6 

requires the use of special-purpose implementing entities or particular capacity-strengthening measures.  
The Bank’s reliance on country systems in the Philippines has been focused on financial management. 

13. 
The Bank’s own Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment 
report (2008) provides a comprehensive diagnostic overview of the full PFM cycle and other key 
dimensions.  The PEFA report identifies the following areas of relative strengths in the Philippines’ PFM 
system: (i) a reasonably comprehensive budget (i.e., limited extra-budgetary operations or unreported 
government operations); (ii) an incipient effort to introduce a medium-term expenditure framework into 
the annual budget process; (iii) a strengthened procurement legal framework and a credible program of 
reform implementation; and (iv) comprehensive annual audit practices, although legislative oversight and 
follow-up of audit findings are weak.  

14. 
There is, however, room for improvement, and in recent years, the Government has been 
implementing several reform programs to strengthen various aspects of PFM.  Aspects of the PFM 
covered in these efforts range from budget formulation (e.g., introduction of a medium-term expenditure 
framework as part of the annual budget process) to accounting (e.g., adoption of the New Government 
Accounting System, or NGAS) and auditing (e.g., use of a risk-based approach to audit selection).  A 
dialogue has been initiated with the authorities to strengthen financial reporting requirements and 
effective oversight function (external and internal auditing).  Other areas still require attention.  One in 
particular relates to an integrated financial management and information system (IFMIS).  To improve on 
the somewhat piecemeal approach to PFM reforms, the Bank and several development partners active in 
this area are offering support to the Government to develop a comprehensive medium-term PFM reform 
strategy, based on the PEFA findings and other diagnostic inputs. 

15. 
PEFA assessments and other PFM diagnostics have revealed the need for strengthening the 
Commission on Audit (COA).  The Bank is providing technical assistance to support COA in its efforts 
in reviewing and modernizing audit approaches to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of COA in the 
audit of government revenues and expenditures through the development and adoption of a results -based 
integrated audit methodology that will focus on the outputs and outcome of public expenditures, using a 
risk-based audit approach. 

16. 
In 2006, the Bank, through the Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance of 
Standards and Codes (ROSC), reviewed the Philippines’ private sector accounting and auditing 
practices with an emphasis on compliance with international standards and codes.  An action plan to 
improve corporate financial reporting practices in the Philippines was developed and adopted by the key 
players in the Philippines corporate financial reporting architecture.  The Bank, through the Financial 
Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), is providing technical assistance toward organizing 
preparatory activities that will build institutional capacity and strengthen the corporate accounting and 
auditing practices of the Philippines.  The activities supported are expected to lead to the development of 
a regulatory framework of accounting and auditing in line with international good practices.  These 
improvements will contribute to financial and private sector development in the Philippines and are fully 
consistent with the Philippines’ current initiatives on accelerating private-sector led-growth. 

17. 
The Bank will also address fiduciary risk through a multi-year program of fiduciary 
analytical work aimed at strengthening the policy dialogue in financial management and 
procurement (particularly at the sub-national level) and raising general awareness.  This program 
will consist of (i) a national level CFAA update; (ii) a sub-national level financial management and 
procurement ESW; and (iii) policy notes on specific areas of interest to the Government.  These analytical 
products will be conducted in close coordination with all relevant sectors.  The main emphasis of the 
CFAA update will be the assessment of the control environment, aid management, and the budget process.  
Specific analytic work to provide a more systematic assessment of financial management risks at the sub -

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Philippines Harmonization Agenda  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 9 
Page 5 of 6 

national level is planned for FY 2009/2010.  This will aim to design relevant indicators and measure 
fiduciary performance at the sub-national level.  The Bank will conduct the sub-national ESW jointly with 
the Government and other development partners. 

Safeguards 

18. 
The Bank has been conducting regular Safeguards Fora for Bank-assisted projects with 
implementing agencies, safeguard oversight agencies as well as other stakeho lders.  These fora aim 
to present and share good practice examples, identify and address common and systemic issues and 
develop a network of safeguards practitioners with the ultimate objective of developing capacity, and 
improving outcomes and sustainability. Through these fora, safeguards instruments, e.g., use of 
frameworks and guidelines, and processes for community driven development (CDD) -types of projects 
across the Bank portfolio have been harmonized. Increased project compliance on safeguard processes 
and requirements during implementation is also noted.  

19. 
Following the issuance of Operational Policy 4.00 in 2005 on the piloting of the use of 
borrower systems for environmental and social safeguards, the Bank, in partnership with the 
Government and ADB, and in consultation with other bilaterals and stakeholders, conducted a diagnostic 
review of the country’s safeguard systems on environmental assessment (EA), indigenous peoples (IP) , 
and involuntary resettlement (IR). The objectives of the review are to assess the strengths and weaknesses 
of the country systems vis-à-vis global principles and good practice in order to recommend measures to 
strengthen local capacity for implementing safeguards work and to identify areas where local policies, 
processes and practices could be harmonized with those of global principles and good practice. The 
review for EA and IP was completed in 2007 and for IR in 2008.   

20. 
The results of the reviews indicated that the legal bases, policies, and institutional 
frameworks of the country’s EA and IP safeguard systems are strong and sound, but suffer from 
weak implementation due to capacity and financial constraints and overly bureaucratic procedures 
and processes.  The country’s IR system, on one hand, has huge gaps with global principles and good 
practice.  The Government has responded to some of the key recommendations through the issuance of 
administrative orders by the relevant agencies and through existing projects, for example, the NPS-
ENRMP for EA, and the grant-funded TA for the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples for the IP.  
The Bank also continues to support the Government’s efforts to adopt more uniform policies and 
practices for involuntary resettlement through its support and participation in the Government’s Technical 
Working Group on Involuntary Resettlement. 

Gender 

21. 
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the National Commission 
on the Role of Filipino Women (NCRFW) have adopted the Harmonized Gender and Development 
Guidelines for Project Development, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation which was prepared 
in partnership with the ODA-GAD Network.  The ODA-GAD Network, composed of more than 15 
development partners, considers the Guidelines as a vital contribution to the process of gender 
mainstreaming.  It provides for the integration of the GAD perspective in development planning processes 
and at various stages of the project cycle. 

22. 
The Guidelines have been used by the NEDA and NCRFW to regularly assess the gender -
responsiveness of all official development assistance (ODA) projects.   The World Bank report of 
March 2008 showed that of 19 projects financed by the World Bank in the Philippines, 84 percent have 
been rated as either gender-responsive or gender-sensitive on both the project design and implementation 
aspects, with the remaining 16 percent rated as “with promising GAD prospects”.  None of the projects 

 
 
 
 
 
Philippines Harmonization Agenda  

 Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 9 
Page 6 of 6 

has been rated as gender-blind.  Consequently, the GAD aspects of World Bank-supported projects, using 
the NEDA-NCRFW Guidelines, will be monitored as part of the supervision missions and safeguards fora. 

Mutual Accountability and Managing for Results 

23. 
The Philippine Development Forum (PDF) has served as an effective mechanism for 
facilitating substantive policy dialogue on the country’s development agenda.  The PDF has evolved 
from the Consultative Group to broaden representation at the annual meetings to include representatives 
from civil society, academe, private sector and the legislature.   

24. 
Aside from the annual PDF event, working group meetings are held around thematic areas 
- MDGs and social progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms; governance 
and anticorruption; decentralization and local government; sustainable rural development; and Mindanao 
– throughout the year to follow through on issues and agreements reached and facilitate consultations 
across a broad range of stakeholders.  Each working group is convened by the head of the relevant 
government agency and a development partner as co-convenor.  Key initiatives and achievements of the 
Working Group on Decentralization and Local Government , which is one of the active PDF Working 
Groups, are discussed in the section below. 

25. 
NEDA has been leading the conduct of joint ODA portfolio reviews among government 
implementing and oversight agencies and the Philippines’ major development partners – ADB, JBIC and 
the Bank.  It prepares an annual report to the legislature on the performance of the ODA portfolio. 

Local Governments and Decentralization  

26. 
The establishment of the Working Group on Decentralization and Local Government under 
the Philippine Development Forum has led to better harmonization of development partners’ 
efforts.  The Working Group is convened by the Department of Interior and Local Government and co-
convened by the WBG and has membership from various international development agencies and 
government agencies.  The working group has a website, which provides a good sense of the kind of 
activities that have been undertaken to harmonize activities/approaches, etc.  The Working Group is 
currently addressing the issue of establishment of a multi-donor trust fund to support its activities. 

27. 
The Working Group focuses on four themes: local government finance (accelerating revenue 
mobilization and improving LGU access to financing, and better expenditure management), capacity 
building (improving delivery of training to LGUs, national oversight agencies and other agencies), 
performance benchmarking (improving the integrity and credibility of monitoring systems), and policy 
reforms on devolution.  Key achievements include improved information sharing between the BIR and 
the LGUs through Executive Order 646: Accessibility of Information on Taxpayers between the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue and the Local Government Units for Tax Collection Purposes signed by the President 
in August 2007; integrating the financial monitoring indicators with a broader performance monitoring 
system; identifying measures to improve the integrity and quality of data collection at the LGU level; and 
enhancing the capacity of the DILG and the DOF-BLGF to maintain the performance systems. 

28. Most recently, the Working Group supported an effort by the four oversight agencies to 
harmonize local planning, budgeting, and revenue mobilization manuals; and jointly disseminate, 
train and brief local governments on the harmonized system.  Efforts are currently focused on 
streamlining and synchronizing duplications and contradictions in training programs for local 
governments offered by various agencies and supported by international development agencies. 

 
 
 
 
Annex 10 
Country Financing Parameters for the Philippines  

(January, 2005) 

The country financing parameters for the Philippines below have been approved by the Regional 
Vice President, East Asia and Pacific Region. 

Item 

Parameter 

Remarks / Explanation 

Cost sharing Limit on the proportion 
of individual project costs that the 
Bank may finance. 

Up to  

100 percent 

Recurrent cost financing Any limits 
that would apply to the overall amount 
of recurrent expenditures that the Bank 
may finance. 

No country 
limit, but 
strong 
emphasis on 
arrangements 
to ensure 
sustainability 

The Bank’s overall financing share is 
not expected to change significantly in 
aggregate level, with expected increase 
in sector-wide assistance (in which the 
Bank’s financing share is typically 
low).  Projects implemented by local 
governments will likely include some 
counterpart funding.   For projects 
implemented by government-owned 
corporations, evidence of ownership 
and commitment would be assessed, 
taking account of budget and planning 
processes and project cost sharing. One 
hundred percent Bank financing could 
be provided for some projects and 
activities with strong evidence of 
ownership and commitment. 

Integration of Bank financing in the 
budget process ensures that increased 
recurrent cost financing would not 
jeopardize overall debt and fiscal 
sustainability. The Bank will continue 
to monitor the overall fiscal situation 
and its implications for recurrent cost 
financing.  At the project level, 
recurrent cost financing could be 
considered if consistent with project 
objectives, provided there is strong 
demonstration of arrangements to 
ensure sustainability after Bank 
financing ceases. 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Country Financing Parameters  

Philippines FY10-12 CAS - Annex 10 
Page 2 of 2 

Item 

Parameter 

Remarks / Explanation 

Yes  

Local cost financing Are the 
requirements for Bank financing of 
local expenditures met, namely that: (i) 
financing requirements for the 
country’s development program would 
exceed the public sector’s own 
resources (e.g., from taxation and other 
revenues) and expected domestic 
borrowing; and (ii) the financing of 
foreign expenditures alone would not 
enable the Bank to assist in the 
financing of individual projects. 

Taxes and duties Are there any taxes 
and duties that the Bank would not 
finance? 

None  

The two requirements for Bank local 
cost financing are met.  Therefore the 
Bank may finance local costs in the 
proportions needed in individual 
projects.   

Taxes and duties are considered 
reasonable.  At the project level, the 
Bank would consider whether taxes and 
duties constitute an excessively high 
share of projects costs.  The Bank 
would monitor local taxes for possible 
distortions and that these maintain 
consistent acceptable practices.
