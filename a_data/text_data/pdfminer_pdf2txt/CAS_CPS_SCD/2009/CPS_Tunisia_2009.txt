E X E C U T I V E SUMMARY 

1. 
Since independence, Tunisia has performed better than most countries i n the region, 
successfully implementing a far-reaching and ambitious development strategy w ith strong results. 
This strategy i s characterized by an early commitment to structural reforms, steady investments in human 
capital and infrastructure, pro-active macroeconomic management and a focus on global trade integration 
with the accompanying needed market reforms. This development model has served Tunisia well as i t 
has sustained an average 5 percent growth rate over the past 20 years, with a corresponding increase in 
the welfare o f its population underscored by poverty levels that are the lowest in the region and strong 
education and health indicators. 

2. 
Despite the excellent growth track record, Tunisia continues to suffer high rates o f 
unemployment particularly among the better educated. Tunisia recognizes that i t must do more in 
order to grow faster and become even more competitive and, most importantly, create jobs for i t s young, 
well-educated population. This c a l l s for an acceleration o f the economy’s structural transformation 
towards a higher value-added, knowledge-intensive one. The Government i s finalizing the update o f the 
1 lth National Development Plan (NDP) which has the main goal to transform the economy to bring about 
sustained job creation. A t the same time, the current global economic cr is is , especially the EU recession, 
i s impacting negatively on Tunisia with a rapid decline in exports in la te 2008 and the first half o f 2009. 
The Government has shown skill i n addressing the challenge and responded with mitigating measures, 
drawing on experience o f managing exogenous shocks. There are promising signs that the worst o f the 
impact may be over and the overall macro-economy remains so l id with a comfortable level o f reserves. 

3 , 
I n this overall context, the strengthening o f the partnership between Tunisia and the Wo r ld 
Bank G roup through this CPS comes at an opportune time. Tunisia considers that the Bank Group i s 
a key strategic partner which plays an important role in its development. The Government has often 
expressed its appreciation for the Bank’s knowledge services and considers the Bank’s dialogue and 
analysis as important inputs to the NDP and sectoral strategies. The Bank has notably supported the 
Government on reforms and 
investments targeted at maintaining the country’s development 
achievements, as well as providing support to better target further reforms. Thanks to i t s strong 
development performance and continuous reforms, Tunisia achieved Investment Grade status and was 
able to access financing on the global market for i t s development strategy, such as i t did in 2007 with a 
successful bond offering. In FY09, in the context o f the global economic crisis, Tunisia turned to the 
Bank fo r increased financing and the Bank responded by delivering record lending o f $335 .6 million. 

4. 
The Government considers its partnership w ith the Bank as a strategic and long-term one 
where the Bank’s role o f knowledge partner in accompanying the country on i t s reform path i s 
highly valued. Tunisia plans to carry out i t s NDP in the overall context o f continued pragmatic 
economic management and pro-active public debt management. I t intends to engage external financing 
when necessary but expects this to remain modest as the economy rebounds and the Government’s 
mobilization o f i t s own internal financing further strengthens. I t w i l l continue to engage the World Bank 
Group in a broad range o f sectors given its appreciation for the knowledge role o f the Bank but w i l l 
maintain its IBRD debt at moderate levels. In a context o f reduced international commercial financing, 
IFC expects to play an active role in supporting the Government’s ongoing PPP program in infrastructure 
(in particular in the power, water and transport sectors), by providing debt and equity financing to 
selected projects. Tunisia views IBRD and IFC financing as contributing to long-term development 
purposes to accompany the transition to a higher value-added and more knowledge-intensive economy. 

5 . 

Tunisia has shown itself to be a consistent and successful development partner and this CPS 
builds on its track record as a well-performing IBRD client. The sustained improvement o f human 
development indicators and recognized leadership in critical areas such as water resource management 

i 

and energy efficiency underscore the good development performance. Tunisia i s considered a leader in 
the region as regards to gender issues and strengthening women’s role in soc ie ty . Furthermore, i t scores 
highly on comparative governance rankings and development indexes: i t has consistently scored above its 
income category and the MENA average on most dimensions, although there remains room for progress 
in areas such as voice and accountability. The CAS Completion Report highlights that the achievements 
recorded in the previous CAS were positive, underscored by the Government’s commitment to prudent 
macro-economic management, phased structural reforms and steady investments in priority sectors. 

6. 
Alignment w ith the NDP, flexibility in approach and selectivity in the areas o f engagement 
are the co r e principles o f the CPS. Tunisia’s NDP provides strategic priorities which guide the CPS 
and allow for greater alignment. I t confirms that employment generation remains the highest priority o f 
the Government. The rolling nature o f the NDP obliges the Bank Group’s program to be flexible, 
responding to challenges and demands as they present themselves. The NDP priorities have guided the 
selectivity on where the Bank i s engaged and reflect the understanding o f where the client sees the value- 
added o f the Bank. The Government and the Bank have agreed on three CPS strategic pillars; (i) 
employment, growth and competitiveness; ( i i ) sustainable development and climate change; and ( i i i ) 
improving the quality o f service delivery. Within these pillars, the CPS outlines a partnership program 
which i s grouped into results areas that facilitate focusing activities and tracking impact. As the program 
i s implemented, the Bank and Government w i l l jointly assess progress and update results and indicators 
to reflect the increased specificity o f the program and to ensure continued alignment. 

7 . 

The CPS outlines a lending program up to $280 million f o r FYlO and an indicative lending 
program f o r FY11-13. The lending requests from Government a l l build on the Bank’s engagement to 
date either through on-going operations or particularly through the programmatic AAA support to 
employment, environment, SMEs, energy and social sectors. Increased IFC financing i s also expected 
although investments would remain contingent on progress in key ongoing infrastructure projects, the 
extent o f investment appetite in the country, and the financing t e rm s in the loca l Tunisian debt markets. 
The Bank and IFC also plan to work together on public-private partnership opportunities as requested. 
The CPS outlines how the Bank’s regional integration initiatives and its management o f global funds can 
benefit Tunisia, and discusses Tunisia’s interface with the Arab World Initiative. 

8 . 

The CPS discusses the risks faced by Tunisia and the Bank Group’s program and describes 
the measures for mitigating these risks. The most immediate risk o f the global economic crisis i s 
mitigated by Tunisia’s pro-active macro-economic track record, its proven capacity to respond and 
prudent debt management that gives the authorities room to conduct f i s c a l policy and engage financing. 
There are risks related to the pace o f reform on ensuring greater competition in the private sector 
environment to move to a knowledge-based economy. To respond, the flexible CPS design ensures that 
the program w i l l move with the speed o f the Government in its implementation o f reforms under the 
NDP. I n addition, the approach to A A A w i l l allow the Bank to assist the Government in addressing 
challenges and thus reducing risks. Finally, implementation risks to the Bank’s program are posed by 
slow procurement which causes significant delays in the execution o f Bank projects. The Government 
and the Bank have been working in a concerted way to address the procurement issues in the portfolio and 
the need for greater progress in procurement has been given more urgency recently by the Government as 
i t continues to manage the impacts o f the crisis and accelerates NDP implementation. 

9 . 

In ’ conclusion, the CPS sets out the enhanced strategic engagement o f the Wo r ld Bank 
Group in Tunisia as the country continues to integrate globally and carries out an ambitious 
transition to a knowledge-based economy. This partnership builds on the excellent opportunity offered 
to the Bank to provide support not only through IBRD financing but, perhaps more importantly, through 
strong knowledge products at country and regional level.

Introduction 

1. 
Tunisia’s 1 l t h National Development Plan (NDP, 2007-2011) charts an ambitious course to 
generate sufficient employment through transforming its economy to a higher value-added, 
knowledge-intensive one that w i l l allow i t to consolidate and improve its strong progress to date. 
The NDP builds on a prolonged period since the 1960s o f very solid economic and social development 
often in the face o f unprecedented challenges and exogenous shocks. However, high unemployment 
threatens the social achievements to date and the impact o f the global c r i s i s puts extra pressure on Tunisia 
to do better in terms o f growth. Tunisia recognizes that i t needs to carry out a transformation to a higher 
value-added, knowledge-based economy through increasing further the integration o f its economy, 
bringing about even faster improvements in productivity growth and innovation, and carrying out deeper 
structural reforms in order to generate employment, particularly for its well-educated population. 

2. 
Tunisia i s calling on the Wo r ld Bank to play a key role i n i t s development plan and 
strengthen its partnership through its knowledge engagement and financing. The Bank has 
remained a valued partner during important periods i n Tunisia’s development, most often for its 
knowledge role, although IBRD financing has proven important and timely. The Bank has a broad 
program already in Tunisia and a productive dialogue with the Government and the country’s 
development partners. This invitation for the World Bank to step up its engagement reflects a 
strengthening o f the partnership with Tunisia and provides an excellent opportunity for the Bank to 
provide enhanced support to a well performing, middle-income country. 

B. 

Tunisia’s Development Achievements 

3 . 
Tunisia has made remarkable progress on equitable growth, fighting poverty and achieving 
good social indicators. I t has sustained an average 5 percent growth rate over the past 20 years with a 
steady increase in per capita income that compares favorably to other emerging countries’ growth 
performance (see figure l), and a corresponding increase in the welfare o f i t s population that i s 
underscored by a poverty level o f 3 .8% (2005) that i s amongst the lowest in the region. The steady 
increase in per capita income has been the main engine for poverty reduction. In addition to rising 
incomes, public investment in infrastructure (roads, transport and communications) and human capital, 
including housing programs, also played an important role in reducing poverty (about 60 percent o f 
Tunisia’s budget i s allocated to the social sectors). Rural roads have been particularly important in 
helping the rural poor connect to urban markets and services. Food subsidies, which have been targeted 
to the poor, albeit not optimally, have also helped the urban poor. 

4. 
Tunisia i s on track to reach the MDGs (Box 1). As regards education, in 2007/08, 97.4% o f 
both male and female 6 to 1 1 year olds were enrolled in school. Primary completion rates are high for 
girls at 91% and have been increasing for boys reaching 87% in 2007/08. I f the pattern o f lower 
repetition rates in primary continues, a l l students regardless o f gender should complete primary school by 
2015. Health status i s generally better than that found in most other MENA countries, as l i f e expectancy 
i s approximately 74 years and the infant mortality rate i s nearly the lowest in the region. Rapid progress 
has been made on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates and malnutrition over the past two 
decades, and HIV/AIDS prevalence remains relatively low. Coverage o f health care benefits i s provided 
through two national social assistance schemes, which together cover approximately 85 percent o f the 
population. Access to basic socio-economic services (water, electricity, sanitation) i s near universal and 

there i s a broad social protection system in place. Tunisia i s considered a leader as regards gender issues 
and strengthening women's ro le in society. With 66% o f the population living in cities or towns, Tunisia 
i s one o f the most urbanized countries in MENA.

Poverty: O f f ic ia l poverty numbers show a decline in poverty between 2000 and 2005 from 4.2% to 3.8%. Data 
from the latest household survey conducted in 2005 show a 37.6% increase in average per capita income between 
2000 and 2005. The gap between Grand Tunis, the richest region, and the northwest and center west, the least 
affluent regions, has narrowed. However, Tunisia's o f f ic ia l poverty line only captures the essential needs o f 
physical survival. Using a higher poverty line, the Wor ld Bank global poverty project finds an incidence o f poverty 
o f 7% for 2005, s t i l l the lowest in the MENA region. Policy makers are try ing to face the challenge to look beyond 
absolute deprivation as captured by poverty incidence to issues o f vulnerability and exposure to risk. 

5 . 
Increasing integration into the global economy has dr iven economic growth. The first wave 
o f integration reforms in the early 1970s created an off-shore regime that has attracted FD I and led to the 
creation o f new industries for export (including textiles and clothing). The composition o f exports in 2006 
shows a strong evolution compared to 1980 when fuels accounted fo r 50 percent o f a l l exports (see Figure 

2 

 
2). The second wave o f trade liberalization in the 1990s helped penetrate new markets in manufacturing 
(for example, mechanical and electrical engineering sector) and led to remarkable improvements in total 
factor productivity'. These evolutions occurred, however, mostly in an offshore sector, operating with a 
liberal investment climate. The domestic on-shore economy i s le ss dynamic, with lower levels o f growth 
and a domestic private investment rate which continues to remain sluggish (around 14-15% in recent 
years, see table 1).

Good and effective macroeconomic management, especially since 1996, has underpinned the 
strong growth performance and helped moderate the impact of exogenous shocks on economic 

growth. A continued pro-active f i s c a l policy has kept f i s c a l deficits below 3% (Figure 3 ) and prudent 
debt management has brought down the public debt ratio to 47.5% o f GDP in 2008 (Figure 4), which has 

' "Tunisia's Global Integration: A Second Generation o f Reforms to Boost Growth and Employment", A World Bank Country 
Study, 2008

contributed to Tunisia’s stable investment credit rating (BBBBaa2). Tunisia also has a good track record 
o f keeping inflation under control at or below 3 percent (except in 2008 due to imported inflation). The 
drop in the public debt ratio meant a decline in interest payments and, together with a favorable evolution 
o f revenues, provided the f i s c a l space to increase transfers and subsidies from 3.7 to 4.2 percent o f GDP 
between 2006 and 2007, and thus protect the population from the increases in food and energy prices.

This development model that Tunisia pursued over the past tw o decades has thus served the 
country well. However, despite the excellent growth track record, the Tunisian economy has not 
generated sufficient jobs to employ the growing and better educated labor force. Unemployment has 
been persistently high in Tunisia - 14.1 % in 2008 - with the burden mostly falling on young and educated 
individuals. The high level o f unemployment reflects an imbalance between the demand for labor, tilted 
towards the unskilled, and a growing supply o f skilled labor where 57% are graduates o f tertiary 
education. In addition, the insufficient creation o f businesses in knowledge-intensive sectors has also 
contributed to keep employment o f the educated workforce low. The profile o f labor supply positions 
Tunisia well to changing the structure o f i t s economy toward more skill-intensive sectors and higher 
productivity in the long-run.

Tunisia scores highly on governance rankings but business environment and accountability 
issues continue to be cited as constraints to growth. Tunisia has consistently scored above i t s income 
category and the MENA average on most dimensions o f comparative governance rankings and 
development indexes, although there are nuances behind these rankings. I t achieves high scores on the 
CPIA ratings, ranks 691h on the 2010 Doing Business indicators (up from 73rd in 2009 and from 81” in 
2008) and 36th on the Global Competitiveness Index. In WBI’s World Governance Indicators, Tunisia i s 
ahead in terms o f government effectiveness, rule o f law, control o f corruption and regulatory quality, but 
has made l e s s progress in areas o f voice and accountability. Moreover, there i s s t i l l room for further 
progress on strengthening the business environment - characterized by a heavy and pervasive intervention 
by the state in the economy2 -wh ich has defined the private sector in Tunisia to date. The MENA region 
has recently finalized a regional report on private sector development 
that concluded that there exists a 
business environment i n most MENA countries, including Tunisia, that i s perceived to be based on 
privilege and unequal application o f the rules o f the game and has resulted in l e s s competition. 
I n 
Tunisia, this environment has constrained the creation o f jobs and i s the likely reason why private 
domestic investment has remained intractably low.

Since the 1980s, Tunisia has been a pioneer among developing countries in emphasizing 
environmental conservation, rationalizing energy use and managing its water resources prudently. 

I t has also successfully implemented Bank projects using country systems fo r safeguard compliance, w i t h 
pa r t icu la r ly strong resu l ts w i t h respect to environmental safeguards. As shown in B o x 2 , Tun is ia has 
carr ied out impressive re form programs in water and energy in particular.

~ %%a 

has achieved remarkable results in the areas o f water supply and sanitation and improvements in these 
services have continued to be priority areas in the national development plans. Currently the entire urban 
population and over 90% o f the rural population have access to potable water. Moreover, 85% o f the population 
has access to improved sanitation services. Though per capita renewable water resources are l e s s than half the 
MENA average, urban water i s supplied 24 hours a day, while water saving technology in the agriculture sector 
has increased water use efficiency to the second highest in the region. These achievements are even more 
remarkable given that water resources are limited, the climate i s arid, the ecosystems are fragile and the 
required financial investments are high. The water sector’s performance i s due to the vision and experience o f 
the operators, to the institutional framework which has been implemented and to the sustained growth o f the 
economy. The relatively low-cost o f water for low-income households has also helped increase overall service 
delivery and the implementation o f an efficient cost recovery system has played an important role. Tunisia i s 
addressing the important water challenges o f the next few decades through regularly updating i t s water resource 
management and sanitation strategy with support from the World Bank amongst others. 

Enerev 
Tunisia should be particularly recognized for i t s early investments i n energy efficiency and promotion o f 
renewable sources o f energy. I t formulated a policy for rational use o f energy and promotion o f renewables as 
early as 1985. The energy intensity o f the economy stopped increasing i n 1992 and has declined to the lowest 
level in the MENA region. The Government has formulated a 4 year energy conservation program for 2008- 
201 1 which proposes to strengthen further the institutional and legal framework that i s already well established.

Global Economic Climate and its Impact on Tunisia 

10. 

The current global economic climate, especially the EU recession, i s having a negative 
impact on Tunisia mainly through weakening external demand. To ta l export g row th dropped f rom 12 

percent i n 2007 to 1 percent in 2008 at constant prices, and fur ther to negative 22 percent (at current 
prices) in the f i rs t h a l f o f 2009 (the European Un ion i s the destination o f 76% o f Tun is ian exports). This 
was d r iven largely by declines in exports o f textiles, c lo th ing and automobile components wh ich together 
represent more than 60% o f to ta l merchandise exports, However , the worst o f the c r i s i s in exports may 
be over as much o f the decline occurred in the first quarter o f 2 0 0 9 . Textiles and c lo th ing exports 
rebounded in June and Ju ly 2009 , wh i le automobile components have regained a p p i t i v e g row th 
trajectory since July. Domestic trade remained unaffected and the telecommunications sector has 
continued to grow strongly. Tourism, another sector sensitive t o external demand, seems so far l i t t l e 
affected by the g loba l c r i s i s and cou ld reg is te r pos i t ive g row th in arr iva ls th is year, thanks to Tunisia’s 
price-competitiveness and the importance o f tourists com ing f r om A lge r ia and L ibya . Nevertheless, a 
decline i n the number o f tourists f rom the E U i s likely, accompanied b y a decrease in the number o f ho te l 
nights.

11. 

Fortunately Tunisia was well prepared t o respond to this shock and the authorities have 
responded effectively. Growth in 2008 reached 4.5%, revised downwards from the expected 6.3%, a 
respectable performance given the global environment. The macro-economy in 2008 was sound with a 
modest f i s c a l deficit (-1.2% in 2008), low inflation (3%), and a healthy level o f reserves ( 5 months o f 
imports). The manageable level o f public debt (47.5% o f GDP i n 2008 compared to 58% in 2005), 
together with the modest f i s c a l deficit, have provided the Government with room to respond. 
Furthermore, the financial sector was insulated - local banks have l i t t l e foreign exposure and foreign 
participation in the stock market i s only 28%, r e a l estate loans represent only 10 percent o f GDP, the 
money market i s s t i l l highly liquid, Tunisia has managed i t s foreign reserves prudently and the Tunisian 
dinar i s non-convertible for most capital-account transactions.

Despite the export shock, the economy shows resilience. This i s confirmed by the recent 
assessment by the IM F in the framework o f i t s Article I V consultations. Real GDP growth dropped 
significantly from 4.5% for 2008 to 1.3% in the first quarter o f 2009 but rebounded in the second quarter 
to 2.5% as the f a l l in external demand was partially compensated by the dynamism in the mining, energy 
and services sectors. The increase in salaries o f public servants (4.7%), public enterprise employees (4%) 
and private sector employees (between 4.2 and 5 .5%) , decided in la te 2008, i s also bringing about a 
positive dynamic in private consumption. 

13 . 
The external position remains comfortable. The current deficit contracted in the first trimester 
o f 2009 after having increased in 2008 (4.2% in 2008, due to o i l and food subsidies) and i s projected to 
decline to 3.5% in 2009. Thanks to the resilience o f i t s tourism receipts and remittances o f Tunisian 
workers abroad, the external position remains solid despite a slight decrease in FD I . Reserves reached a 
total o f US$10 .6 billion at end July 2009. The continuous inflow o f foreign exchange combined with 
reduced issuance o f government bonds over the last few years led to a situation o f over-liquidity which 
the Central Bank managed to absorb by raising the reserve requirement o f banks. From January to May 
2009, the nominal exchange rate depreciated by 1.7%, due to the depreciation o f the dinar vis-a-vis the 
euro (4%) while the effective exchange ra te appreciated by 1.5%. 

14. 
Inf lat ion remains controlled, decreasing from its peak o f 5% in 2008 to 3.5% in June 2009 
thanks to a decrease in the price o f basic products (food and oil) and an appropriate monetary policy. 
Inflation i s estimated around 3 . 5% in 2009 (y-0-y) and i s expected to be contained and remain in the 
range o f 3-3.5% thereafter. After two increases in 2008, the ratio o f obligatory reserves was reduced from 
10 to 7.5% by the end o f 2008. In addition, the Central Bank reduced the key inter-bank rate from 5.25% 
to 4.5% in February 2009 for the f i r s t time in 30 months. Finally, even through customs receipts have

f a l l e n by 3.6%, o v e r a l l revenues increased by 9.5% thanks t o an increase in VAT revenue and p e t r o l 
rece ip ts .

The Government’s response to the global crisis confirms bo th its approach to pro-active macroeconomic 
management and to economic reform. In fact, the Government used the onset o f t h e c r i s i s to move the re form 
agenda forward. The Government took a set o f quick actions to support the real economy in response to the 
economic slowdown. Measures were announced in December 2008 to increase public investment b y 20 percent 
and to assist exporting f m s . The ma in support measures were: 
(i) 
a subsidy o f 50 percent o f the employer’s cost o f social security for f m s experiencing a dramatic f a l l 
in exports to Europe; 
a subsidy o f 100 percent o f the employer’s cost o f social security for f m s that had to stop production 
and run down stocks; 
a subsidy o f 50 percent o f the cost o f export insurance; 
an acceleration o f procurement procedures for public contracts granted to the loca l private sector; and 
selected reforms to enhance integration, improve the business climate and strengthen the financial 
sector w i th in the framework o f the Integration and Competitiveness program. This program supports 
reforms inc lud ing reducing the number o f tariff bands from 9 to 6, converging product quality and 
safety norms to international standards, preparing a strategy for regulatory reforms in the services 
sector, improv ing the business registry to make i t accessible and up-to-date, reducing the delays in 
access to industrial land (amendment o f the urban code) and reforming venture capital and mutual 
funds to make them more effective. 
The Integration and Competitiveness Program i s being supported by Tunisia’s ma in donors - Wo r ld Bank, E U and 
A fr ican Development Bank ( A D B ) - who increased their financing in 2009 to the re form program in line w i th the 
Government’s strategy for undertaking greater external finance. The Bank increased the amount for i t s D P L on 
Integration and Competitiveness to $250 m i l l ion , in line w i t h t h e increased financing from the EU and A f D B o f 
$350 m i l l i o n combined. 
In addition, in July 2009 , the Parliament approved an additional stimulus package featuring an increase in public 
spending o f more than TN700 m i l l i o n (equivalent to 1.4% o f GDP). 
Infrastructure projects (mainly road and 
highways) ready for incorporation in next year’s Finance L aw were advanced and are now being implemented. The 
December 2008 measures aimed at supporting exporting f m s have also been renewed for another six months, 
w i t h e l ig ib i l i ty now extended also to par t ia l ly exporting f m s . 
The Bank worked closely w i t h the government in assessing the impact o f t h e c r i s i s and preparing the response. 
This program o f analytical support i s ongoing as additional analyses requested b y the Government are being 
finalized.

The impact o f the stimulus plan i n 2009 (year 1 ) should not be overestimated. A recent paper shows that the impact o f an 
increase i n public investment i s small i n the short run but robust i n the medium term. Lengthy procurement procedures prevent a 
rapid impact o f public investment on output. For more details, see Diop and Abdallah (2000): “The Dynamic Effects o f 
Countercyclical Fiscal Stimulus on Output in Tunisia”, Policy Research Working Paper 5087 (October 2009 ) . 

contribute positively to growth, as well as most services sectors (notably trade and telecommunications). 
Manufacturing industries (which account for 19% o f GDP) should likely suffer negative growth given 
their export-orientation, The pace o f growth i s expected to increase in 2010 to 3 . 8% and to return to a 
more sustained pace o f around 5% from 201 1 onwards.

The financing o f the current account deficit comes mainly from foreign sources. FD I i s 
expected to slow down in 2009 (from a record increase in 2008) and then stabilize or increase in the mid- 
term. Remittances showed a strong resilience to adverse economic conditions. Reserves are expected to 
stay at comfortable levels in 2009 (around 4.5 months o f imports) and for the rest o f the mid-term period. 

17. 

M a j o r public investment activities in 2009 and 2010 should help the economy recover so 
long as the project preparation procedures and procurement are accelerated. Public investment i s 
an important driver o f growth and a key political counter-cyclical tool, but as noted in footnote 4 its 
impact in the short term remains weak due to the long delays in the preparation o f projects. The 
uncertainty as regards the global environment and the possible delay in the execution o f projects proposed 
in the stimulus plan constitute risks to growth in 2009. Added to this would be the delay in the EU’s 
recovery and i t s impact on Tunisia. A l l factors being considered, i t i s likely that unemployment w i l l 
worsen in 2009 and the beginning o f 2010 even i f growth rates are positive. 

18 . 
I t i s important for the Government to continue its policy o f fiscal consolidation and active 
debt management in the medium term. Once the downturn i s over, a decrease in energy subsidies 
could f a c i l i t a t e both macro-economic management and especially the debt management policy to decrease 
further the ratio o f debt to GDP. The Government intends to continue pro-active public debt management 
through: ( i ) early repayment o f high-interest debts; ( i i ) active management o f the risk related to the 

8 

interest rate (8% o f external debt in 2008 had a variable rate); and ( i i i ) active management o f exchange 
and refinancing risks (in part through issuance o f long maturity bonds in local currency). Keeping debt 
increases below the rate o f growth o f the economy w i l l help reduce debt-to-GDP ratios, freeing foreign 
exchange reserves and allowing for the maintenance o f reserves at a comfortable level through 201 1 ,

TUN IS IA ’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

A. 

Boost Growth and Transform Tunisia into a Knowledge Economy 

19. 
The broad challenge for Tunisia over the long-term i s to accelerate the structural 
transformation of the economy to increase productivity and generate sufficient numbers of skilled 
jobs. The growth model followed to date has served the country well and Tunisia has attracted FD I and 
established a light manufacturing industry that i s competitive on an international scale. This industry has 
been supported by an off-shore regime that offers a good incentive framework to investors as well as 
attractive f i s c a l and financial advantages. This regime facilitated a strong increase in exports and FD I as 
well as a large creation o f low-skilled jobs, especially for women which in turn helped reduce poverty. 
This growth model was successful in the early stages in reducing total unemployment as, up until the la te 
1990s, the public sector was there to employ most university graduates. Now the public sector i s seldom 
recruiting and the light manufacturing sector has not reinvented i t s e l f . The la t ter remains specialized in 
low value-added sub-contracting and has not incorporated more knowledge-intensive segments in the 
production process ( in part because the European client does it). As analyzed in the World Bank’s 2009 
Development Policy Review (DPR)’, 
the majority o f new entrants to the labor market today have a 
university degree while the productive sectors have weak capacity to absorb highly qualified workers. 
This naturally raises concerns on the quality o f growth achieved by Tunisia whereby growth has created 
an employment profile focused on low skilled workers, leaving highly qualified workers behind.

The task for Tunisia is thus to bring 
about an economic transformation which 
intensifies the sophistication of the economy, 
creating demand f o r highly qualified labor, 
which in turn will contribute to a rising 
productivity o f the economy. 
The DPR 
provides a detailed analysis o f the strategic @ ,ow

o f the economy and identifies reforms in the 
areas o f 
innovation, support 
to SMEs, 
integration, and the other accompanying policies 
needed to strengthen the financial sector, adapt 
education, improve the functioning o f the labor 
market and continue to 
improve economic 
governance. Tunisia’s own past experience and 
the experience o f other countries (such as 
Malaysia) that have managed to jump the ladder 
o f technological sophistication (Figure 6 ) can 
inform economic policy in the coming years.

the experience o f other successful countries to launch this ‘transformation. Bes ides con t inu ing to assure 
macroeconomic s tab i l i ty in an environment o f h igh g loba l uncertainty, Tun is ia faces a broad agenda that 
B o x 4 identifies. The strategic thrust i s t o seek a greater integration in to the g loba l economy ( inc lud ing 
services and agriculture), such as has been undertaken in the framework o f the in tegra t ion .program. This 
should be supported b y further e f for ts to strengthen the business environment, make finance available to 
start-ups and innovators, reduce the costs o f logistics and create an innova t ion p la t fo rm that can launch 
the country in to new areas o f economic ac t iv i ty such as I T and advanced se rv ices . 

Further Integration into the Wo r ld Economv: 

B o x 4: A reas o f F u t u r e R e f o rm 

Trade policy: Tunisia i s advancing well i n its trade policy reforms. Since January 2008, trade o f industrial goods 
with the EU i s duty-free. The agenda i s however unfinished as import tariffs for non-EU trade are high and product 
standards are not fully aligned with those o f potential markets. The government has been reducing tar i f f dispersion 
created by the gap between tariffs on EU imports and imports from other sources and these e f fo r t s should continue. 
A key challenge w i l l be to reduce non-tariff barriers in the services sectors unilaterally for some sectors (e.g. 
telecom) and in partnership with regional and global partners fo r others (e.g., open skies agreements). Finally, export 
promotion and particular support to SMEs w i l l be critical since Tunisia’s f i r m s often manage to penetrate new 
markets but do not mature in those markets (opportunistic export behavior). 

Logistics: Logistics i s an integral part o f integration reforms and improvement i n logistics w i l l benefit the overall 
economy. The challenge i s to better integrate Tunisian services with international logistics networks, by blending 
openness and consolidation o f l o c a l providers. A wide spectrum o f areas need attention including trade facilitation at 
customs, improving port performance, encouraging investment in logistics platforms and reducing entry barriers and 
informality in the logistics sector. The government has launched investments i n ports (Enfidha) and other c r i t i c a l 
infrastructure but there i s s t i l l a way to go t o bring about the needed logistics overhaul. 

ComDetition and the Business Environment: 

For Tunisian firms to benefit fully from global integration and for greater innovation and productivity to flourish, 
enhanced and fairer competition in markets i s required. Repeated surveys show that competition i s weak i n the on- 
shore economy, underscored by the 2008 IEQ study where 60 percent o f f i r m s denounced anti-competitive practices 
such as implicit agreements, discrimination among clients and linked sa les and 67 percent o f firms cited at leas t one 
type o f unfair competition i n the domestic market. The private sector has often denounced the regulatory 
environment which they face . The slow execution o f reforms often reduces their credibility and thus their equal and 
reinforced application would greatly improve their credibility and the private sec tor ’s response. The M E N A 
region’s flagship report on Private Sector Development6 emphasizes that this i s a regional problem. As Tunisia 
looks to the future, and if i t intends to pursue a credible transformation o f i t s economy, the role o f the state needs to 
become more selective and much lighter with a smoother and more equal implementation o f policies.

Financial Sector: Onshore firms need better access to credit as do potential new entrants. Mos t financing tools are 
available (bank finance, factoring and leasing, stock market, venture capital, etc.) and the government has put in 
place several dedicated support mechanisms ( e g BFPME a bank specifically dedicated t o SME finance and 
SOTUGAR for guarantees). However, despite this fairly favorable environment that generates viable financing 
opportunities, private sector funding (as a percentage o f GDP) has leveled o f f in the las t decade. Tunisia’s IMF - 
World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP - 2006) presented a diagnosis with recommendations that 
remain valid. I n line with the recommendations, the government has been improving the design o f the public credit 
registry and promoting the creation o f well-regulated credit rating agencies. A plan i s underway - with the support 
o f the Bank’s DPL to the Integration and Competitiveness Program - to reduce the s ize o f the non-performing loans, 
and provisioning them (only 53 .8% are currently provisioned). I n addition to strengthening banking, and in line with 
the FSAP recommendations, the development o f the non-banking financial sector i s a priority, as innovative 
channels o f financing are needed to support SMEs and encourage entry and innovation (see Appendix 9 for details 
on SME financing i n Tunisia). 

Innovation, Research and DeveloDment: Tunisia has followed an active policy to develop a national innovation 
system including scientific research, technological diffusion, education and industrial upgrade. 
I t has achieved 
notable progress in terms o f the public investment rate in R&D - including ICT and e-government, the proportion o f 
researchers in the population and the education level o f i t s work force. I n addition to the investments made, a dense 
institutional infrastructure has also been put in place to support innovation, science, technology and research with 
multiple research and promotion agencies active, often with overlapping mandates. Despite this progress and 
investment, recent analysis shows that there i s s t i l l a limited contribution o f research in the economy, a developed 
technological base i s s t i l l fledging and the partnership between the productive sector and research institutions i s 
weak. 

23 . 
Agriculture requires special attention as i t remains an important sector o f the economy 
(about 10 percent o f GDP) and employs a sizeable percentage of the labor fo rce (about 16 percent 
o f the total labor force and 27 percent o f the ru r a l labor force). The natural po ten t ia l o f agricultural 

land has been mob i l ized fully and ra in fed agriculture remains dominant in terms o f land use, w i t h strong 
inter-annual variations in ra in fa l l . Despite decades o f Government e f for ts to protect natural resources, 
over-exp lo i ta t ion and inadequate land management have led to s ign i f ican t resource degradation. The 
performance o f the sector and the agr icu l tura l po l icy o f the Government have a respectable record o f 
g row th bu t the agriculture sector i s wo rk ing be low i t s po ten t ia l fo r pro-poor grow th . Ag r icu l tu re g row th 
has no t been as strong as the overa l l economy (average annual g row th o f 2.8 percent), and to a great 
extent, poverty i s a ru ra l phenomenon (the Government figures estimate rura l pover ty as be ing tw ice the 
national average o f 3 . 8 percent). In th is regard, there i s a need - as mentioned in B o x 1 - to look at 
poverty beyond absolute depr iva t ion and poverty incidence and instead t r y t o address issues o f 
vu lnerab i l i ty and risk fo r poor farmers. 

24. 

A recent study on Tunisian agriculture’ found that productivity in certain sub-sectors i s low 

and not competitive internationally. Some o f these sectors surv ive through subsidies, most no tab ly a 

l ow pr ice o f water fo r irr iga t ion . F u l f i l l i n g agriculture’s po ten t ia l w i l l require (i) trade and pr ice 
l ibera l iza t ion and a recon f igura t ion o f the state in terven t ion in commod i ty markets; (ii) modernized pub l ic 
s e r v i c e s in areas such as inpu t and output marketing, research and phyto-sanitary controls; (iii) leveraging 
support to the pr iva te sector based on needs expressed rather than by impos ing regulations; and ( iv ) 
supporting more e f fec t ive ru ra l finance and i r r iga t ion water management. Tun is ia has taken an active 
part in the Doha process and has started b i la tera l negotiations fo r l ibe ra l iz ing agr icu l ture and services as 
part o f i ts Association Agreement w i t h the EU. Bu t , as Tun is ia contemplates further l ibera l iza t ion o f 
trade, there i s greater urgency - expressed by the Government through the NDP - to address the current 
l im i ta t ions o f the enab l ing environment, while at the same time deve lop ing an upgrad ing program ( “M i s e

25. 
The transport sector i n Tunisia contributes about 5.9 percent o f GDP and i s relatively well 
developed even though quality and capacity could be strengthened. In several instances, Tunisia's 
current transport infrastructure and logistics services are still short o f fully supporting a growing and 
modem economy, especially one that i s dependent on exports and integration. There are capacity gaps in 
urban and inter-urban infrastructure, value-added logistics are under-developed, and congestion i s a 
growing and serious problem in most large urban areas. Energy saving i s a key challenge fo r the 
transport sector as i t consumes 3 1 percent o f the country's energy and 56 percent o f o i l products, thus 
being one o f the main contributors to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Relevant reforms are being 
pursued i n several transport-sub-sectors (institutional reform o f ports, public-private partnerships in 
Enfidha airport) but the pace o f these reforms should be accelerated to strengthen Tunisia's ability to 
grow at a stronger rate. The Government has a large transport investment program in the NDP with a 
focus on facilitating trade and improving urban transport services. As part o f the stimulus plan described 
in Box 3, the Government has targeted increased public investments in the transport sector. 

B. 

Increase Employment and Address the Problem o f Employability 

26 . 
The pattern o f economic growth unt i l now has not generated sufficient employment f o r an 
increasingly better educated labor force. Unemployment has been persistently high in Tunisia reaching 
14.1% in 2008 with the burden falling on young and educated individuals (Figures 7 and 8). The 
unemployment rate reflects three factors; (i) demographically, Tunisia i s boasting a large number o f 
higher education graduates entering the labor market (57% o f entrants have a university degree), thus 
swelling the labor supply o f educated people; ( i i ) the existing economic sectors (textiles and clothing, 
agriculture, agro-industry, automobile components, tourism, etc.) are predominantly intensive in low- 
skilled workers and do not generate sufficient demand for workers with a post-baccalaureate level o f 
educatioddegree; and ( i i i ) while greater trade integration and significant FD I inflows have allowed new 
sectors to emerge, the trend o f business creation in newer, knowledge-intensive sectors i s insufficient. 
Despite high levels o f education o f women in Tunisia (who make up the majority o f university graduates), 
their participation in the labor market remains low.

27. 
A critical action t o address some aspects o f the unemployment problem lies in the move 
towards a knowledge intensive economy which can shift the demand fo r labor towards the more 
educated. This brings r i s e to a particular set o f issues that need attention; (a) the workings o f the labor 

12 

market; and (b) the availability o f required skills. The labor market in Tunisia i s relatively rigid, affecting 
the distribution o f jobs between formal and non-formal, and affecting negatively the labor productivity o f 
the overall economy. Firms create informal jobs because the labor code i s overly rigid. This rigidity i s 
also linked to a public policy o f protecting workers that i s provided through the firm rather than more 
effectively through neutral general schemes. Removing this rigidity would require putting in place social 
safety nets that go beyond what i s now in place towards well-targeted labor market programs. 
In 
addition, the government could increase the flexibility in the rules and procedures governing hiring and 
firing, retrenchment and firm restructuring which are currently too rigid. 

28 . 
There i s an urgent need to provide the appropriate s k i l l s to assist transformation o f the 
economy. The Investment Climate Assessment surveys point to quality o f labor as a constraint and there 
i s widespread evidence through various business surveys o f a skills mismatch and a high-skilled brain 
drain (the 2008 IEQ enterprise survey found that over 60 percent o f f i r m s were constrained because o f 
lack o f engineering, technician or skilled worker profiles). Therefore, there i s a need for re-orienting 
higher education to techn ica l and s c i e n t i f i c sectors, as well as a need for a new and comprehensive focus 
on skills development encompassing professional reinsertion and retraining o f workers in traditional 
sectors and reforming the higher education system to respond to the needs o f a knowledge-based 
economy. New ways o f working w i l l need to be explored with the private sector to ensure both a better 
match with the needs o f firms and the delivery o f training. 

29. 
Notwithstanding the importance o f s k i l l s and a well functioning labor market, the driver to 
create more jobs remains the private sector demand f o r hiring people. Thus the issue i s how to 
unleash the demand for employment in the private sector. I f Tunisia’s economy remains in the traditional 
sectors, this w i l l imply that firms w i l l continue to need more uneducated labor as they grow, thus leaving 
the unemployment situation relatively unchanged. The solution i s naturally increased trade and 
investment but ca l ls for a more fundamental shift to a skills-intensive, knowledge economy that operates 
in a more competitive and enabling environment. 

C . 

Improve the Quality o f Service Delivery 

30 . 
Tunisia’s public sector has helped steer the economy along a sustained growth path and 
deliver increasingly better outcomes. However, now the public sector once again faces the challenge to 
reinvent i t s e l f to meet emerging challenges. Selected and phased reforms have been undertaken to date 
but would need to be further continued in five areas that are already identified in the NDP as priorities: ( i ) 
introduction o f new methods o f public adminstration; ( i i ) weeding out o f obsolete regulations; (iii) 
equitable rule enforcement; (iv) active encouragement o f greater openness and participation; and (v) 
strengthening o f Monitoring and Evaulation capacity. The Government has introduced performance 
based budgeting and Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) which are showing some progress. 
The effectiveness o f public procurement urgently needs to be addressed and a serious reform program 
undertaken. Slow and burdensome procurement procedures have greatly constrained the delivery o f 
services and infrastructure. 

3 1 , 
Tunisia has made great progress i n extending the educational system to greater segments of 
the population. As already noted in Section I above, Tunisia most likely w i l l meet i t s MDG targets. In 
addition, enrollment rates and completion rates continue to improve in upper basic education (12-16 year 
olds) and secondary levels. Enrollment in tertiary education has tripled in the past ten years reaching 3 1 % 
o f 19-23 year olds, 58% o f whom are female. Forecasts are that higher level education enrollment rates 
w i l l continue to increase at a rate o f approximately 10% per year. Total expenditures on education (not 
including vocational training) represented 6.1% o f GDP in 2006, higher than the average o f OECD and 
middle-income countries. Allocations within the sector follow the needs emerging from a shrinking 6-1 1 
year old population and an expansion o f post-primary education. 

13 

32. 
The coming challenge i s to improve the quality and relevance o f education. 
International 
students tests for children in Grade 4 and 8 show that Tunisian students’ scores in math and science are 
average for countries o f similar income levels. S ince 2000 the government has undertaken extensive 
curriculum reforms, but evaluations show that greater attention should be paid to linking pedagogical 
reform and learning outcomes. The rapid expansion o f the popuation i n secondary education has seen 
worsening o f performance and higher drop-out rates, with resulting weak links between secondary 
education, vocational training and higher education institutions. In addition, the increased demand for 
secondary education has led to hiring o f young teachers who are not prepared to respond to the demands 
o f a diversifying population. In the future, Tunisia w i l l continue to face a demographic transition that w i l l 
shift a greater share o f the student body to secondary and tertiary education, making i t urgent to work on 
relevance and quality. Universities and other institues o f higher learning need to have the incentives aqd 
the flexibility to respond to labor market demands which w i l l imply controlling the flow o f students, 
particularly where there i s recognized over-supply in certain professions. The Government i s aware o f 
these challenges and i s undertaking strategies to address them, taking into account that the challenges o f 
reform across all forms o f higher level education (university, vocational) are significant and additional 
measures w i l l be needed to ensure the sufficient re-orientation o f the education system to the needs o f the 
market. 

33 . 
Hea l th status in Tunisia i s generally better than that found i n most other MENA countries, 
and the health-related MDGs are largely on track to be achieved. The population enjoys a relatively 
high l i f e expectancy rate o f 74 years (76 for women), rapid progress has been made as regards infant and 
maternal mortality rates and HIV/AIDS prevalence remains relatively low. Coverage o f health care 
benefits i s provided through two national social assistance schemes, which together cover approximately 
85 percent o f the population. Tunisia i s also experiencing an epidemiologic and demographic transition, 
such that a greater prevalence o f non-communicable chronic diseases and a gradually ageing population 
w i l l likely increase the demand for more technologically complex health services. This transition w i l l 
require ensuring effective and sustainable health services and promoting healthy lifestyles to address 
demand. 

34. 
Wh i le the health sector performance compares favorably w i th other countries at a similar 
income level, there are a number of health system challenges that need to be addressed. These 
include improving the quality o f public services and the efficiency o f health resources, particularly in 
public hospitals, and improving equity in terms o f expanding health insurance coverage and reducing the 
financial burden on the poor. Tunisia has witnessed a relatively rapid increase in to ta l health 
expenditures, largely attributed to the particularly high rate o f growth o f out-of-pocket household 
spending at private health facilities. This trend reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the quality o f 
service offered by the public sector. 

3 5 . 
Tunisia has developed a comprehensive social protection system combining active labor 
market programs (ALMPs), social insurance and social assistance programs. The latter include 
consumer food and fuel subsidies, targeted transfers, emergency and education loans and family 
allowances. Tunisia i s rightly proud o f i t s social protection system and spends approximately 19 percent 
o f GDP through the general budget or through contributions levied on the a f f i l i a t e s to the soc ia l security 
system. However, the current system o f unemployment assistance leaves most workers uncovered and 
provides weak and even adverse incentives. As noted previously, i t would be advisable to move 
gradually to a more universal and neutral protection scheme that would support a greater mobility in the 
labor market. The pension system i s running annual deficits which have to be covered from reserves. 
Various pillars o f the social safety net system are not well targeted to the poor despite some reform efforts 
in the past - such as food and fuel subsidies. The system has unconditional transfers in cash and in kind 
that are high and it lacks evaluation on their impact. The Government has made efforts to simplify and 

14 

streamline the system but much remains to be done to ensure greater efficiency and better targeting. 
Medium-term f i s c a l stability w i l l requre continuing reform o f the subsidies system. 

36. 
Sustaining the decentralization and de-concentration process, through strengthening o f 
municipal and local authorities, i s needed to improve the quality o f services to citizens. With a 66% 
urbanization level that continues to increase, there i s pressure on municipalities to improve their services 
as service delivery has not kept pace with population growth in urban areas. Some o f the pressing 
challenges in this area are: (i) capacity building at municipal levels; (ii) fostering local economic 
development; ( i i i ) preserving the urban environment; and (iv) safe-guarding the country’s cultural 
heritage. 
In the 1990s, a process o f decentralization was supported by an increased transfer o f 
responsibilities to municipalities and the creation o f a specialized financial institution (Caisse de PrBt e t 
de Soutien uwc Collectivite‘s Locales - CPSCL) to provide lending and manage central transfers to 
municipalities. These measures were followed by re fo rms o f local f inance and tax systems which have 
had positive but limited effects. There has been l i t t l e progress made in the de-concentration o f municipal 
income and municipalities have few services for which they are fully responsible, a narrow se t o f income 
sources and a constraining infrastructure investment program. There i s a need for future budgetary 
reforms in order to target a more de-concentrated delivery o f public services, as well as engage the private 
sector more in the delivery o f services. Tunisia benefits from a huge cultural heritage that currently 
remains under-exploited. Preserving and promoting better this heritage i s a critical element in continuing 
to transform the current tourism model (based on the lower-end, beach-type holiday) to a higher-end 
model with greater value-added to the loca l economies. 

D. 

Manage the Impacts o f Climate Change 

37. 
Tunisia’s already vulnerable environment i s being further tested by climate change. Tunisia 
i s a land and water scarce country and has managed these scarc i t ies well, building an institutional set-up 
that has kept the country well supplied with water (see Box 2). However, the rapid demand for water 
associated with economic growth and greater coverage o f the population has meant that the country i s 
reaching i t s maximum potential and must bring demand in balance with supply. This means measures to 
induce greater productivity in water use, particularly in agriculture that i s the major consumer (agriculture 
uses the.majority o f the water resource base, although the potable water share i s projected to increase 
from 13.4% in 2010 to 17.7% in 2030). There i s also room to expand the recycling o f water through 
treated waste water reuse. Tunisia’s agricultural economy, despite the investments that have been made, 
remains vulnerable to the variability o f rainfalls that causes recurrent droughts: in years where drought 
occurred, there was a decline in agriculture output with an average corresponding 1% decline in overall 
economic growth. The urgency to meet the water use challenge i s further highlighted by the current 
consensus amongst experts that Tunisia’s climate w i l l become warmer and drier over the coming decades, 
with precipitation possibly declining 10% by 2030. Moreover, efforts to increase water productivity in 
agriculture should be accompanied by efforts to preserve f e r t i l e arable land ( i t i s currently estimated that 
about 47 percent o f arable land i s eroded). A combination o f conservation, desalination, recycling and 
agricultural rationalization i s essential to ensure water use i s sustainable in the medium to long-term. 

38. 
Tunisia has achieved considerable progress to date on energy efficiency and increasing the 
use o f renewable energy sources. As previously outlined in Box 2, Tunisia boasts one o f the highest 
energy efficiencies in the MENA region. However, i t must bring about greater progress i f i t i s to reach 
the levels o f neighboring Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Portugal. Tunisia has made some 
laudable efforts in promoting alternative and renewable forms o f energy although the vast majority o f its 
energy needs are s t i l l met through the use o f foss i l fuels. Tunisia evolved from being a net exporter o f o i l 
and gas in the 1970s and 1980s into a net energy importer by the late 1990s. Today imports supply a 
quarter o f energy needs but this i s expected to increase with greater advances in industrialization and 
greater consumer demand i n cities. The challenge thus remains to continue the path o f reducing the 

15 

energy intensity o f the economy, find alternative non- foss i l sources o f energy and reduce energy 
dependency on imports and foss i l fuels. Leveraging the resources o f the private sector in the 
development o f large scale renewable energy projects can accelerate the pace o f diversification o f 
Tunisia’s energy mix, in particular in electricity generation, taking advantage o f Tunisia’s good wind and 
solar resources. The recent new law allowing large industrial customers to generate their own electricity 
from renewable resources, and efforts to develop large scale wind and solar parks are steps in the right 
direction. Encouraging private sector participation, through a more favorable regulatory framework, as 
well as providing visibility to international investors could accelerate the pace o f development o f 
Tunisia’s renewable energy sector. 

39 . 
H igh value assets in urban areas and tourism reso r ts , and strategic infrastructures in 
transport and other sectors are already exposed to natura l disaster risks, which could be exacerbated 
by climate change. Flooding in c i t i e s i s happening with greater frequency, causing severe damage to 
sanitation and road infrastructure. Urban development i s concentrated in coastal areas that are 
increasingly vulnerable to the impacts o f climate change. Coastal cities in particular, often the location o f 
globally-important cultural heritage sites, are increasingly under threat from rising sea levels and coastal 
erosion. Changes in sea temperatures are also impacting the delicate marine ecosystems o f key tourism 
s i t e s (for example, Gu l f o f Gabes). 

40. 
Tunisia i s well placed to benefit from external financing in support of climate change 
mitigation and adaptation. Financial instruments, such as the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and the 
Carbon Partnership Facility (CPF) can help re-align low carbon development options with Tunisia’s 
national interests, by closing the financial gap at investment stage (CTF), or generating additional stream 
o f revenue upon delivery o f carbon emissions reductions, even beyond 2012 (CPF). IFC’s strategic focus 
on the financing o f private-sector led renewable projects in Tunisia can also play a substantial role in 
encouraging private sector investment in the country’s renewable energy sector, in particular early 
investors. Furthermore, Tunisia could eventually become a net exporter o f renewable energy through 
participation i n the MENA Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) scale-up initiative and the possible energy 
interconnection project between Tunisia and Italy (see section on CPS program for details). 

E. 

Exploit the Benefits o f Regional Integration 

4 1 . 
Tunisia would be i n a better position to address most o f the above development challenges if 
i t anchors its development strategy into an open regional framework. Regarding the employment 
challenge, Tunisia’s strong integration with the EU could yield much more benefits in terms o f growth 
and job creation with stronger regional integration. Indeed, by widening the scope fo r economies o f scale, 
the la t ter would allow Tunisia to a t trac t more foreign (and regional) investments to fuel growth and job 
creation. A larger market would also make Tunisia more attractive for investors outside the EU. This 
would create more effective capacity to reduce unemployment in Tunisia and in the region as a whole. 

42. 

Regional integration would also allow Tunisia to better address climate change issues. 
Concerted efforts at the regional level would allow Tunisia and its neighbors to address drought, water 
and land scarcity issues while enhancing the capacity to invest in c lean technologies, undertake research 
on environment sustainability, biotechnology, water management technologies and renewable energy. 
Situated between Libya and Algeria, two large and energy-rich countries, Tunisia cannot afford to 
manage its key environment concerns alone. 

43 , 
Mainstreaming regional integration in Tunisia’s development agenda w i l l require greater 
cooperation in many areas. In the area o f trade, regional integration should be considered as one 
element in a strategy o f trade and broader economic liberalization, which also encompasses unilateral and 
multilateral removal o f trade barriers. A decisive move towards adopting common approaches to 

16 

standards and e l im ina t ing behind-the-border barriers to trade and investment wou ld improve the overa l l 
reg iona l investment c l ima te and boost growth. Beyond synchron iz ing trade and. investment regimes, 
greater project-based cooperation cou ld be sought in many areas: energy, transport, bank ing and 
environment. Tun is ia stands to benefit f rom the different activities underway through the Arab Wo r ld 
In i t ia t ive and has been active in pushing fo r such in i t ia t ives bo th i n the Maghreb and the MENA region. 

IV . 

N A T I O N A L DEVELOPMENT P L A N 

I n 2007, the Government launched its llth Nat iona l Development Plan (NDP) which covers 

44. 
2007-2011. The Government i s currently upda t ing the N D P t o adapt i t to a ro l l ing development plan w i t h 
regular updates during i t s implementation, to respond to new challenges and demands as they present 
themselves and assess risks and constraints regu lar ly . The update o f the N D P w i l l be f ina l ized before the 
end o f 2009 and extended to cover the 2010-2014 per iod . The NDP emphasizes that employment 
generation remains the highest p r io r i ty o f the Government and i t lays ou t the goal fo r Tun is ia to establish 
an in fo rma t ion society and a knowledge-based economy w i t h a focus on human capital development. The 
p lan outlines that the nex t decade i n Tunisia w i l l be marked b y deepening reforms and the acceleration o f 
the pace o f their implementation. The Government recognizes that Tun is ia must do more in order to grow 
faster and become more competitive, in order to deliver on the employment challenge. 

. 

Bo x 5: The Five Axes o f the NDP 

The consolidation o f the economy and acceleration o f growth through further efficient integration into the global 
onomy and private sec tor development. This involves deepening o f structural reforms, consolidation o f good 
ivemance and transparency, strengthening competitiveness, diversification o f the sources o f growth and 
velopment o f innovation capacities and continued solid macroeconomic management 
A comprehensive development approach that guarantees sustainable growth and a harmonious balance among 
economic, social and environmental priorities. The Government w i l l continue t o pursue poverty-fighting 
programs that ensure effective income distribution and further strengthen the social safety net. This axe focuses 
on integrating the environment dimension into programs, generalization o f environment upgrading, increased 
energy efficiency, improved waste management and rationalization o f natural resources exploitation 
The modernization o f the national economy towards a knowledge-based one, so as to offer new sources o f 
growth and t o improve the capacity o f job creation and adapt i t to the new structure o f employment demand. 
This encompasses accelerating the improvement o f productivity, upgrading o f knowledge in the private sector, 
and upgrading the ICT infrastructure and promoting generalization in its use. The axe also focuses on the 
development o f the necessary human resources, adaptation o f the educational system to the knowledge economy 
and the creation o f centers o f excellence i n training and research. Finally, as regards the c r i t i c a l issue o f 
innovation, the plan targets greater focus on science and technology, introduction o f a partnership between 
research centers and the productive system. 
The consolidation o f investment in human capital in order to increase i t s contribution to growth and 
consequently to establish i t s driving role in the development process. This involves improving the quality o f 
education, better adaptation o f professional and vocational training programs, reforms in the university system, 
creation o f centers o f excellence in the universities and development o f pre-school education. I n the health 
sector, the goal i s to bring about a higher quality in medical services and a control o f health expenditures. 
Finally, e f f o r t s w i l l be concentrated on the generalization o f soc ia l security coverage and better targeting o f 
support programs to women and children. 
The adoption o f sec tora l policies which respond to the need for transforming the economic structure through a 
greater diversification i n the productive base and an increase i n the contribution o f high value-added and skill- 
intensive activities. Efforts w i l l be focused on transforming the agricultural system, exploiting investment and 
development opportunities i n traditional sectors such as textiles, tourism, mechanical engineering and 
electronics. and strenethenine the Derformance o f services i n the economv. 

45. 

As pa r t o f its NDP, the Government i s evaluating the availability o f financing f o r the 
investments and reforms planned, given the overall macro-economic and public finance situation. 

This i s being undertaken in the overa l l context o f continued pragmatic economic management and p ro - 

17 

active public debt management that has served Tunisia well up to now8. With a public debt ratio o f 
47.5% o f GDP in 2008, Tunisia has some space to increase its debt prudently. IBRD financing w i l l be 
requested for those key investments where the value-added o f the partnership with the Bank i s strong. 
For some large projects, IFC’s financing and support to public-private partnerships can support the NDP 
(on the model o f the Enfidha Airport when IFC arranged the total debt package o f EUR380 million). 
Tunisia does not view the World Bank Group’s financing partnership purely as a response to the global 
crisis but sees the ro le o f IBRD and IFC financing as contributing to long-term development purposes to 
accompany the transition to a higher value-added and more knowledge-intensive economy. 

46. 
The strong collaboration between the Bank and the Government on analytical wo rk has 
facilitated a common understanding of the challenges and reform options. The Bank’s knowledge 
work contributes to the national dialogue on challenges and constraints to development. For example, the 
recently-completed Development Policy Review has informed the NDP update. Other parts o f the Bank’s 
knowledge work - particularly programmatic ESW - inform the design o f sectoral strategies and their 
related investment programs. There i s agreement on the analysis and reforms needed and also a large 
degree of convergence between development partners’ and the Government’s perspectives o f areas where 
progress to date has been good.

The Bank’s relationship w ith Tunisia i s mutually acknowledged as being good and has 
emphasized the importance o f flexibility to evolving needs. I n particular, the Bank’s engagement in 
Tunisia has focused on quality analysis and global knowledge which has underpinned a l l lending 
operations. The Government has often expressed i t s appreciation for the knowledge services o f the World

Plans and sectoral strategies. The knowledge ro le o f the Bank i s especially valued because the Bank has 
undertaken economic and sector reports in a fully collaborative way, with strong ownership from 
Government. Equally important, the Bank has been able to mobilize rapidly its team and resources to 
respond flexibly when requested and to focus on providing just-in-time policy advice. The Bank’s non- 
lending program i s one that builds on a good track record and i s sufficiently multi-sectoral in nature to 
respond flexibly to the client’s demand. 

48. 
The financing role o f the Bank has also remained flexible and has undergone some 
important evolutions over the past few years. The management o f the economy by Government meant 
that Tunisia achieved Investment Grade status and was able to access favorable financing on the global 
market”. As a consequence, the Government did not seek large financing from IBRD during the FY06- 
08 period as foreseen in the previous CAS. I n parallel, the Government decreased its public debt and 
repaid considerable amounts o f its debt to IBRD. The f isca l year 2009 marked a significant new 
departure in the Bank’s relationship with Tunisia. Due to the more favorable IBRD terms, and in the 
context o f the global economic crisis, Tunisia sought the Bank as a preferred financial partner with record 
lending delivered o f $335.6 million in FY09. In particular, Tunisia engaged i t s first Development Policy 

* One element o f the country’s prudent management o f i t s debt involves the support o f the Bank’s Treasury department. Tunisia 
was the first country to sign an MDA w i th the Bank in 2003, and i s among the top users o f hedging products and one o f only 
three countries to have used the MDA to execute hedging transactions. 
This occurs i n the context o f the Wor ld Bank Group’s annual and spring meetings as we l l as visits to Tunisia by senior 
management. 
lo I n 2007, the Government launched a h igh ly successful $260 m i l l i o n equivalent yen Samurai bond, underscoring its stable 
investment credit ratings (BBBIBaa2).

Loan ($250 million) in support o f its ambitious global integration and competitiveness agenda. The 
experience o f the last several years has thus shown that the Government masters itstmobilization o f 
external financing and the Bank has shown flexibility in adapting its financing to needs. The Bank’s role 
i s valued independently o f the volume o f financing which has allowed i t to maintain an important 
strategic and fruitful partnership with the country. Finally, Tunisia has appreciated the Bank’s reliance to 
a large extent on its country systems for financial management and for safeguards due diligence and has 
performed successfully in this regard. 

49. 
I F C has been active in Tunisia since the early 1990s and currently has a committed 
portfolio o f US$278 million in 8 companies. While IFC has historically had a limited role in Tunisia 
due to alternative sources o f financing at lower spreads, i t has more recently stepped up its activities and 
been positioning itself as a partner which can add value on a wide range o f issues instead o f just 
financing. IFC’s engagement i s predominantly in infrastructure and financial markets, including 
microfinance targeting women borrowers. Recently, IFC has been active in Tunisia’s infrastructure sector 
i n step with the Government’s efforts to develop i t s public private partnership (PPP) initiatives, as well as 
in the general manufacturing sector. For instance, in FY08, IFC invested EURlO5 million for its own 
account and mobilized EUR255 million to f inance the upgrade o f Monastir Airport, the construction o f 
the new Enfidha Airport, and the operation o f both under a 40-year Build-Operate-Transfer concession. 
In.FY09, IFC invested an additional EUR28 million in this project. 

B. 

Implementation o f the CAS and Lessons Learnt 

50. 
The previous CAS fo r Tunisia was approved in June 2004 and covered the FY05-08 period. 
The CAS had three strategic pillars: (i) strengthen the business environment; (ii) enhance skills and 
employability; and ( i i i ) improve the quality o f soc ia l services. The CAS continued to emphasize the 
knowledge role o f the Bank and proposed an ambitious lending program for FY05-08 o f up to $200-$300 
million each year. The CAS Progress Report (CAS-PR) was completed in September 2007 and 
confirmed that the CAS pillars and strategy remained valid. The CAS-PR updated the lending program of 
the CAS and laid out an indicative program for FY08-09 o f $200-$250 million per year. 

5 1 . 
The CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) notes that the implementation o f the CAS was 
globally positive although lending volumes did not reach the proposed amounts. The decision o f the 
Government to engage alternative external financing on the global market reduced new IBRD 
commitments to Tunisia, which declined from $163 million in FY05 to $ 1 14 million in FY06, $ 8 8 . 8 
million in FY07 and just $6 m i l l ion in FY08. This trend was reversed in FY09 when lending increased to 
$335.6 million. In parallel, the s ize o f the project portfolio, comprising IBRD and GEF operations, 
declined slightly from 17 projects to 15 . However, given that a substantive program was in place at the 
beginning o f the CAS, yearly disbursements averaged $123 million and the overall s ize o f the portfolio 
remained relatively robust at around $500 million. The average disbursement ratio for FY05-09 was 
satisfactory at 21.4 percent, c lose to the Bank’s average. There were no problem projects during the CAS 
period, and pro-activity and realism indicators remained good. While a l l new lending did no t develop as 
expected during the CAS, the Bank was able to deliver i t s program through the on-going portfolio o f 
projects, selective new investments and a concerted focus on AAA . 

52. 
The Trust Fund portfolio made an important contribution and allowed the Bank to 
innovate. The trust fund portfolio - encompassing GEF, IDF, and several country-specific and regional 
trust funds (see Appendix 10 for details) - has been integral to the Bank’s overall partnership with 
Tunisia. I t has allowed fo r innovation in the program through financing a more comprehensive AAA 
program than the one financed purely through the Bank’s budget, testing o f pilot approaches in new areas 
and increasing the Bank’s ability to deliver a critical mass o f support within the overall framework o f 

19 

sectoral engagements. Tunisia’s strong leadership in’ environmental management has allowed i t to benefit 
from a broad and dynamic GEF portfolio, o f ten as a complement to IBRD financing. The mobilization o f 
other types o f trust funds in support o f AAA has also facilitated important areas o f reform dialogue on 
procurement, labor markets, energy sector, youth and environment. 

5 3 . 
The CAS CR highlights that there were important positive achievements o f the Bank’s 
program but there were also areas o f improvement needed. Overall, the picture i s a positive one with 
clear results in the following priority sectors: (i) export promotion, trade integration and ta r i f f reform; (ii) 
improvements in access and quality o f service in the transport, water and energy sectors; and (iii) progress 
noted in the education sector and developing the knowledge economy. Tunisia also performed strongly in 
the U s e o f Country Systems approach for safeguards, where two projects piloted the approach successfully 
and fo r financial management where country systems are mainly used. The CAS CR also concludes that 
there was good performance on cooperation with donors (see Box 6 ) . However, the CAS CR points out 
that more modest results were achieved in some key sectors - employment, social protection policies and 
increasing the competitivity o f agriculture. Improving the quality o f soc ia l services, especially making 
higher education more relevant, remains challenging. 

54. 
The Bank’s program i s judged to have been responsive and timely in delivering good 
quality AAA which was conducted in close cooperation with the Tunisian authorities. In particular, 
there was gradual but significant results o f the Programmatic ESW (PESW) approach, which helped build 
capacity and consensus on a se t o f major issues in employment, macro-economy, trade integration, and 
energy. In its Ap r i l 2009 report, IEG evaluated the Bank’s performance in Tunisia on earnings growth 
and employment creation and gave the Bank’s Program a satisfactory outcome rating. The report 
concluded the following (i) the Bank’s strategy and interventions were relevant to the issues; (ii) 
performance was strongest in the Bank’s support to macroeconomic policy; (iii) there was a positive 
contribution from the Bank on trade liberalization and f i s c a l policy; and (iv) high quality work was 
delivered on the financial sector, including work undertaken jointly with the IMF . The Government has 
also emphasized i t s appreciation for the good quality o f country dialogue and analysis” which has been 
greatly strengthened by the increasingly decentralized Bank team in Tunis. 

5 5 . 
The CAS CR identifies the operational factors that dogged the Bank’s program and which 
are, for the most part, linked with procurement weaknesses. This led to slow disbursements and 
repeated extension o f projects. Excessive centralization o f decision making power on procurement 
processes i s the main cause for the considerable delays. The lessons learn t on procurement are 
particularly pertinent going forward: Tunisia must grasp more opportunities to align procurement systems 
with international best practices, as well as to harmonize and develop knowledgeable and skilled human 
resources and institutional capacity. The need for greater progress in this regard has been given more 
urgency recently by the Government as i t launches the rolling development plan and steps up public 
investments. The CPS w i l l aim to capitalize on this momentum to ensure real progress in procurement. 

56 . 

The CAS-CR recommends a greater alignment between the Bank’s program and the 
country’s priorities. A main conclusion o f the CAS-CR i s that the CAS could have been more aligned 
with Tunisia’s NDP priorities and time-frame for undertaking intended policy reforms. This i s a key 
lesson learnt that i s embedded in the CPS which aims for greater alignment with the NDP. The CAS-CR 
also emphasizes the importance o f having a more practical results framework with a corresponding focus 
needed on strengthening M&E systems. 

I ’ Main analytical reports produced during this time included the Global Integration Study, M ILES , FSAP, Employment PESW, 
Water and Sanitation Strategy, SME Finance Study, Agriculture Sector Review, Energy Management Policy, and Development 
Policy Review. 

20 

5 7 . 

An important conclusion o f the CASCR i s that Tunisia performed well in areas where i t 
was ready t o deepen reforms and i t has performed l e s s well i n areas where i t determined that the 
political o r economic context was not yet ripe f o r such bold measures. The experience in Tunisia i s 

that re forms are undertaken steadily but re la t ive ly s low ly to a l low for the necessary t ime to study issues, 
consult w i t h a l l na t iona l parties, and ensure consensus before embarking on any new po l ic ies . Once the 
c l ima te i s considered ripe t o move fo rwa rd w i t h reforms, Tun is ia has brough t about good results. 
Consequently, key considerations fo r this CPS include the need t o be more sensitive to the time-frame o f 
re forms and no t just the substance o f reforms. The Bank’s experience in Tun is ia has shown that when 
Tun is ia has comm i t ted to a re fo rm path and has engaged the necessary f inanc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l 
resources, then i ts achievements are impressive. 

5 8 . 

Lessons learnt from the I F C program. Tun is ia benefits f rom i t s stable business environment 

and i t s investment grade ra t ing . However, there continues to be h igh levels o f regulation and government 
in terven t ion in the economy. 
IFC ’s experience in the country has demonstrated that successful project 
implementation i s o f ten contingent on Government support to investors (par t icu lar ly fore ign investors) to 
navigate the Tun is ian administration and meet the country’s regulatory requirements. 

Box 6: Good Donor Coordination 
I n the context o f a strongly-owned and country-led program, the Government plays a lead role on donor 
harmonization and coordination. The Government has a deep understanding o f the comparative advantage o f 
each donor based on its assessment o f the technical quality o f their work and the terms o f their financial support. 
The main donors in Tunisia are the European Union (EU), the African Development Bank (AfDB), 
Agence Francaise de Developpement, Japan and the World Bank. The EU, A fDB and World Bank have 
deepened their collaboration in the past couple o f years, most notably around their budget support which i s being 
provided to Tunisia’s integration and competitiveness program. This positive experience has solidified the 
increased financial role that Tunisia i s requesting from donors and serves as a model o f donor cooperation in 
support o f the Paris Declaration. 
The EU i s an important development partner for Tunisia because o f the overall context o f the EU 
Neighborhood Policy and Tunisia’s strong political, economic, so c ia l and cultural t i e s with Europe. The EU has 
an active program o f support focused on economic reform, education and environment. 
I n addition to their 
support to the integration and competitiveness program, the World Bank and the EU have a particularly c lose 
collaboration on performance-based budgeting, PEFA, employment and education and are seeking greater 
collaboration around water and agriculture. 
The Bank, A fDB and Agence Francaise de Developpement are also collaborating well i n sectors such as 
water, energy, agriculture, municipal development and cultural heritage management. Appendix 6 has further 
detailed information on donor programs in Tunisia. 
IFC has also been actively collaborating with other IFIs and w i l l pursue more opportunities moving 
forward, especially for large projects. For instance, IFC helped bring i n the A fDB , Proparco and the European 
Investment Bank as co-financiers for the Enfidha Airport project. 

C . CPS Guiding Principles 

5 9 . 
The Bank’s engagement emphasizes the importance o f understanding the Tunisian context 
and building on the strong relationship that already exists. The Wo r ld Bank Group i s wo rk ing w i t h a 

Government that has a s trong ly-owned strategy and a so l id understanding o f where the Bank can add 
value. IBRD f inanc ing i s very sma l l compared to the country’s budget so the Bank’s f inanc ing ro le must 
be selective on the c r i t ica l pr ior i t ies . S im i lar ly , I FC f inanc ing w i l l selectively target projects where i ts 
additionality, role, and development impac t are clear. The Bank’s ro le w i l l be very much in the ve in o f 
partnering with the country when requested and agreeing on h o w and where we should and should no t 
engage. W i t h i n this context, and with the bene f i t o f the lessons learnt f rom the implementation o f the 

21 

Bank’s program to date, the main principles that guide the Bank’s partnership for the future are 
alignment, flexibility and selectivity. 

Alignment 

60 . 
The update o f the NDP into a rolling development plan provides strategic priorities which 
guide the Bank’s program as outlined in this CPS. The CPS aims to align the Bank’s program to the 
maximum extent with the NDP as regards priorities, approach and pace o f reform. As previously 
mentioned, the Bank’s knowledge work informs the NDP, particularly the recently-completed 
Development Policy Review. There i s agreement on the analysis and reforms needed and also a large 
degree o f convergence between the Bank’s and the Government’s perceptions o f areas where progress to 
date has been satisfactory. The CPS focus i s on supporting the directions that the Government has 
decided on but aiming to clarify thematic context when necessary, highlight trade-offs, add value by fine- 
tuning implementation modalities, assess risks and bring international experience to bear. 

61. 
Greater alignment w ith country systems w i l l also be pursued. Tunisia has successfully 
piloted the use o f country systems approach for safeguards compliance in the Bank’s water and solid 
waste projects and w i l l continue this going forward through broadening i t to other projects in the 
portfolio. The Bank has also concluded that Tunisia has performed well with respect to financial 
management in the Bank’s operations. Such a track record strengthens the case for greater use o f DPLs in 
the Bank’s program. 

Flexibility 

62. 
The CPS aligns w ith the flexibility demanded by the rolling development plan. Within the 
context o f c lea r national priorities, the CPS adopts a flexible approach on how best to support the 
government as circumstances change. By being demand driven, i t avoids programs that are not realized, 
as noted above about the last CAS. The CPS builds on the experience in Tunisia that the Government 
only requests IBRD financing when i t judges i t necessary, when i t has carefully weighed the pros and 
cons o f a l l alternatives and where i t assesses that the Bank can add most value. I n the same manner, the 
IFC program i s designed to be focused on a select number o f sectors, yet w i l l remain flexible and 
responsive to new opportunities. 

63. 
The use o f DPLs w i l l become gradually more important as a way o f introducing flexibility 
through aiming fo r a r e a l i s t i c assessment o f reform progress and possibilities and focusing attention on 
where success i s most likely and reforms are most urgent. The challenge for the Bank i s to deepen its 
understanding o f the pace o f reform implementation and develop more the “how” rather than the “what” 
given the degree o f convergence on the substance o f the strategies and reforms needed. This approach 
w i l l be critical in ensuring effective implementation and results. In areas where a phased approach i s 
required, the Bank w i l l use opportunities to promote future reform efforts through advocacy and sharing 
o f international best practice. 

64. 
Flexibility means that the AAA program i s aimed to provide timely analysis and t o set the 
ground f o r operational work. On the knowledge front, the Bank w i l l continue to provide just-in-time 
policy advice and to mobilize Bank and non-Bank international best-practice, even i f in some cases the 
Bank’s knowledge work does not lead to IBRD lending but rather to financing from other partners. The 
Bank’s knowledge work i s valued and requested by the Government both for its substance and fo r i t s 
timely delivery, so having flexibility in the A A A program i s critical to be able to respond to requests 
when they are forthcoming. 

22 

Box 7: CPS Consultations and Communication P lan 

I n the preparation o f this CPS, and as a regular part o f a l l i t s activities, the Bank has consulted different development 
partners and independent actors in Tunisia which has greatly enriched its knowledge base and understanding o f the 
country. The elaboration o f the CPS has been a collaborative process with Government through multiple discussions 
at different levels starting in November 2008. The Government has a c lea r vision o f where i t wants the Bank to 
engage but it has also been open to dialogue on other issues on which the Bank was i n more o f an advocacy mode. 
This has nurtured the context o f the CPS and the sectoral content o f the Bank’s engagement in areas such as 
employment, education and service delivery. 

For the CPS itself, consultations were carried out with other development partners at urban and ru ra l levels with 
representatives from private sector, NGOs, Parliament, c iv i l society, unions, farmers’ associations and women’s 
groups. The following issues were highlighted (further details are in Appendix 7): 
0 Ru ra l development: Participants were particularly keen to s t ress that special attention should be given to 
improving access to micro-finance and strengthening r u r a l infrastructure for water accessibility/coverage and 
improved hygiene. 
P r iva te Sector: The main recommendation from entrepreneurs i s for an improved administrative and 
bureaucratic inter-face with the Government, strengthening the financial sector and access to finance for firms, 
and developing trade and transpop further. The importance o f professional training was also highlighted. 
Par l iamen tar ians : The challenges as they seem them revolve around areas identified as priorities: education, 
employment, developing the private sector, agriculture and health. 
C iv i l Soc ie ty : The CSOs cited issues o f transparency and accessing information on the state’s activities due to 
what they perceive as a lack o f communication and insufficient consultations. CSOs would like to see the 
Government encourage a more effective participatory dialogue and implicate i t i n aspects o f the decentralization 
process and its relationship with the various development priorities. 

0 

The Bank also consulted Tunisia’s main donors and collaborated particularly closely with the African Development 
Bank (AfDB), given the degree of harmonization o f the two development banks’ programs and due t o the fac t that 
the A fDB was conducting i t s mid-term review o f i t s strategy at the same time. 

The development o f the CPS benefited from several other Bank-related activities that occurred during the process 
which are detailed in Appendix 7 “CPS Consultations Report and Communications Outreach”. 

The CPS consultations reaffirmed the importance o f reaching out and listening to different audiences. Stake-holders 
expressed great interest in interacting more with the Bank to debate development issues and have greater access to 
Bank reports (global, regional and national). Moving forward, the main vehicle for outreach efforts and access to 
development content w i l l be: ( i) the Tunisia websites; (ii) conferences, workshops, dissemination events on topics o f 
relevance for Tunisia’s or the region’s soc ia l and economic development (Le . World Development Report 2 0 0 9 , 
M N A report on Job mobility); ( i i i ) ongoing consultations on the Bank ’s activities, and (iv) further strengthening the 
Public Information Center (PIC) housed within the library o f the University o f Tunis. 

Consultations around the CPS w i l l continue in order to interact further with those met during the CPS process and 
share the Bank’s strategy with a broader audience to promote a better understanding o f issues, challenges and reform 
trade-offs. I n addition, Bank teams working on lending and analytical work w i l l be encouraged to identify 
mechanisms early on for engaging with c iv i l society and strengthening participatory processes. The Bank w i l l ensure 
that the PIC’S impact be further increased by generating greater awareness o f its services among stake-holders. The 
Bank’s outreach efforts w i l l be conducted jo in t ly with local and development partners such as the European 
Commission Delegation, the United Nations and the African Development Bank i n Tunis. These are proactive 
institutions i n their outreach efforts and have expressed willingness to co-organize events with the Bank as was 
already successfully done previously. 

23 

Se Iectivity 

6 5 . 

The priorities o f the NDP w i l l continue to guide selectivity on where the Bank i s engaged. 
While the Bank’s program in Tunisia remains broad, selectivity i s imbedded in the program by the client. 
The Bank has had an active and fruitful dialogue with the Government during the CPS preparation 
process and the design o f the program reflects the decision o f the Government to engage the Bank on 
specific areas where i t sees a c lea r role and value-added. These areas o f intervention are those where the 
Bank already has a long-term engagement or where the Government i s now inviting the Bank to step up 
i t s partnership. The choice o f selected areas has gone through the f i l t e r o f whether they meet the criteria 
o f ownership, strategic impact, harmonization with other actors and a focus on implementation. 

66. 

The CPS emphasizes synergy across interventions around pr ior ity results. The Bank’s 
support w i l l aim to bring greater synergy in the range o f Bank instruments around the client’s priorities 
through ensuring streamlining o f IBRD, Trust Funds, and AAA , and eliminating where possible 
dispersion in the portfolio. I n particular, the Bank w i l l continue to strive to create the building blocks for 
engagement through phasing o f instruments: on-going dialogue and AAA program (supported by trust 
funds) form the foundation o f the engagement and lending w i l l only be carried out where there i s already 
a solid knowledge base and a c lea r assessment o f the reform program and implementation schedule. 
Trust Fund financing - including GEF, Carbon Funds, and Clean Technology Fund - w i l l continue to be 
delivered in those areas such as energy and environment where the Bank already has an engagement and a 
coherent approach, preferably in parallel with IBRD financing. 

67. 
The Bank’s program seeks greater synergies and collaboration w ith the other main 
development partners in Tunisia (see Appendix 6 for further details on donor harmonization). The 
Government pro-actively coordinates the programs o f donors, requesting co-financing where appropriate 
and encouraging greater harmonization around priority issues such as global trade integration, 
employment and education. For its part, the Bank has continued to deepen i t s collaboration with the 
African Development Bank, EU and AFD, as well as participate in other donor coordination fora 
involving bilateral and the UN agencies. There i s a good understanding among Government and donors 
o f the comparative strengths o f each donor which enhances the complementarity o f programs. The Bank 
recognizes that harmonization with other donors may mean disengaging where we do not bring the most 
value-added, letting other donors lead in areas where they have greater comparative advantage, and 
accepting that the Bank may be asked to play a convening role rather than a financing one. 

68 . 

For the I F C , the focus w i l l be on projects where its additionality, r o l e and development 
impact are strong. Through its debt instruments, IFC w i l l focus i t s interventions on: (a) projects with 
large financing needs, exceeding the capacity o f the domestic banking sector; (b) projects which 
necessitate foreign currency financing; or (c) projects requiring longer term maturities than those 
available locally. I n select cases, IFC w i l l also target smaller size investments in the manufacturing, 
agribusiness and soc ia l sectors, using debt substitutes, such as guarantees as may be needed. Through its 
equity and quasi-equity instruments, IFC w i l l consider projects with strong demonstration effect and high 
development impact (for example, renewable energy projects, high value-added manufacturing, ICT and 
health & education). 

D. 

Results 

69 . 
One important lesson learnt on results from the CAS-CR i s to ensure a more reasonable 
and practical results framework that accounts for the flexibility o f the Bank’s approach. The 
previous CAS contained a highly ambitious and, in some cases, inappropriate results matrix which had 
overly detailed goals and indicators that were not aligned with the evolution o f the program. I t proved 

24 

out-dated, overly rigid and often didn’t capture progress. The CPS results framework i s simplified but 
dynamic, with the intention that i t should evolve as the Bank’s program evolves. Where the Bank’s 
program i s already engaged (those projects active at the time o f this CPS and confirmed areas o f future 
engagement), the matrix provides a detailed description o f expected results and indicators. For those 
activities where the nature o f the Bank’s engagement has yet to be defined but where we expect future 
opportunities w i l l l ie , the matrix aims to set out the broad goals. The matrix also has designed outcomes 
realistically given the pace o f reform in Tunisia. As the program i s implemented, the Bank and 
Government w i l l jointly assess progress and update the matrix to reflect the increased specificity o f 
results and indicators and to ensure continued alignment with the country’s program. 

70. 
Na tu ra l ly any attempt to show attribution f o r outcomes i s difficult because the Bank has 
limited influence on the achievements o f broad social and economic objectives. Rather, the goal i s to 
assess contribution instead o f attribution. Achieving and demonstrating results w i l l remain a critical 
element o f the Bank’s program and monitoring results o f Bank-financed interventions w i l l coincide with 
overall monitoring o f Government results in the National Development Program. In this regard, the Bank 
w i l l ensure that results indicators in projects/programs are those which are shared by the Government and 
w i l l provide continuous support to strengthening capacity at the national level for monitoring and 
evaluation. 

E. 

CPS Program 

71. 
The Government and the Bank have agreed on the CPS Program that supports Tunisia’s 
strategy to generate employment through establishing a knowledge based economy w ith emphasis 
on human development. The pillars o f the CPS are: 

1 . Growth, competitiveness and employment; 
2. Sustainable development and climate change; and 
3 . 
Improving the quality o f service delivery. 

The Bank’s program i s hereafter laid out along the lines o f these three pillars and its delivery i s focused 
through six results areas that facilitate targeting o f activities, tracking o f impact and monitoring o f results. 
Both the country-specific activities and the regional activities which cover Tunisia are described 
(Appendix 3), as well as Tunisia’s interface with the Arab World Initiative (Appendix 4). 

72. 
IFC ’s partnership w ith Tunisia w i l l continue in the next few years, w ith efforts focused on 
the infrastructure and financial sectors. On a case by case basis, IFC w i l l also support private led 
investments in the soc ia l sectors (health and education) and in the manufacturing sector. In the 
infrastructure sector, IFC w i l l continue its support to the Government’s PPP program, with an emphasis 
on the power (gas-fired and renewable energy generation), water (sanitation and desalination) and 
transport (ports) sectors. In the f inanc ia l sector, IFC w i l l support the country’s banking sector, through 
direct investment in important banks, and a continued focus on enhancing domestic financing to loca l 
SMEs, including micro-finance institutions. 

P i l la r 1. Growth, Competitiveness and Employment 

73. 
Given its political and economic importance and the high pr ior ity assigned by the NDP, the 
employment challenge i s central to the CPS. To address this, the Bank’s program focuses on two 
results areas which combined should help Tunisia transform over the long-haul into a knowledge 
economy and generate employment for an increasingly educated population. The f i r s t results area 
addresses the growth and composition o f the demand for labor by deepening global integration, enhancing 

25 

the environment for private sector (especially SMEs) and financial sector development, as well as 
opening space for the development in Tunisia o f a knowledge economy through greater global integration 
o f services and improved conditions for existing business to innovate. The second results area turns 
attention to the employability o f labor, with the aim to improve the adequacy o f the skills m i x supplied by 
the educational system and to develop the labor market policies and social assistance mechanisms that 
w i l l facilitate an increased mobility o f labor i n the economy. In both o f these areas, the Bank’s work w i l l 
increasingly take a regional outlook as regional integration i s critical to further growth. Success achieved 
in Tunisia i n addressing unemployment would yield valuable lessons for other countries in the region.

Together, the various components o f the first result area wo rk to facilitate the 

transformation o f the economy w i th the contribution o f the CPS organized around three themes. The 
first theme focuses on global integration through support to rationalizing ta r i f f protection, trade 
facilitation and logistics with the objective to open to competition those activities (including services) that 
have not been we l l integrated into the global economy through improving conditions under which 
businesses operate. The second theme i s to improve the environment for bus inesses (especially SMEs) 
through reducing the regulatory burden, curtailing anti-competition behavior and strengthening the 
capacity o f the financial sector to intermediate savings and finance investment especially among small 
enterprises and new entrants. Lastly, the CPS assistance focuses on two sectors that the government has 
assigned a special priority, strengthening the foundations o f the knowledge economy and agriculture. 

Deepen Global Integration for Trade in Goods and Services 

7 5 . 

The CPS w i l l support a greater integration o f Tunisia into the global economy. The World 

Bank Group’s support focuses on a gradual reduction i n the external tariffs and thus the level o f 
protection o f the on-shore economy, which includes the serviced sector and where the Tunisian economy 
has a great potential to generate skilled jobs. Thus far, the growth o f the services sector has lagged the 
growth o f the rest o f the economy and i t s participation i n total exports i s below that at countries with 

26 

similar levels o f development. The tariff reduction and simplification i s already underway and w i l l serve 
to eliminate distortions across various preferential trade regimes with the support o f the Integration and 
Competitiveness DPL program (ICL). The first ICL was already delivered in FY09 in close collaboration 
with the EU and African Development Bank (AfDB) and the second phase w i l l be delivered in FY 1 1 and 
w i l l deepen the agenda. 

76. 

The CPS w i l l continue to provide strong support to the improvement o f logistics to help 
further the integration o f the economy into the global markets. The expectation under the CPS i s to 
help reduce the direct and indirect costs o f trading with the rest o f the world. Although Tunisia already 
has made progress in developing a working logistics sector that facilitates trade, recent analytical work on 
trade points to gaps that need attention for the country to be fully integrated into international logistics 
networks. To help c lose these gaps, the Bank w i l l continue supporting improvements in the access to 
export markets through availability o f finance and support for the improvement o f trade logistics. The 
third phase o f the Export Development project (FY 11) w i l l build upon and anchor more deeply the 
institutional reforms and support to SMEs started i n the first two phases o f the project, whose positive 
achievements are informing the design o f similar projects in the region (see Appendix 8 for fu l l details on 
the Bank’s Export Development projects in Tunisia). Further work on logistics i s carried out under a 
PPIAF, AAA and other trust funds. W h i l e the Government has not requested Bank financing for transport 
in FY 10 or FY 1 1, the large program o f transport infrastructure investments outlined in the NDP and the 
stimulus plan mean that future requests for financing may be forthcoming. The WBG would consider 
such requests positively given its long-term engagement in the transport sector, both through lending and 
providing technical advice. 

77. 

Wo r k on integration and trade facilitation w i l l have a regional focus as well. A broad AAA 
program - strengthened by additional activities o f the Arab World Initiative - w i l l address specific 
regional issues such as barriers to integration, cross-border trade issues, regional transport and logistics, 
and regional financial systems (see Appendix 3 : Regional Integration Activities for more details). The 
Bank i s discussing with its regional partners potential activities in the trade and transport sectors that 
could strengthen the overall momentum and widen benefits expected from facilitated trade. The Bank’s 
role i s that o f convener and facilitator, as well as knowledge partner and potential future financier. The 
support o f the Bank aims to complement the priorities o f the EU’s Regional Transport Action Plan for the 
Mediterranean Region 2007-2013. I n the area o f logistics, the Bank’s program i s looking at the following 
initiatives; (i) audit o f logistics efficiency on intraregional trade aiming to support improved trade 
facilitation between countries; (ii) regional trade facilitation and logistics conferences for Maghreb 
countries; and (iii) a study on logistics training programs to agree on quality standards and develop 
curricula for the training o f logistics specialists in each country. 

78 . 
As pa r t of the focus on global integration, the I F C w i l l continue supporting inward and 
outward South-South investment flows. IFC w i l l assist companies interested in investing in the region 
and other developing countries given that Tunisia i s proving to be a source o f South-South investments in 
the Maghreb and Africa. IFC has financed some projects with Tunisian sponsors looking to invest within 
the Maghreb and other developing countries in the areas o f manufacturing, banking, and health, insurance 
and leasing. Conversely, as i t did in the past in the infrastructure sector (Enfidha Aiport), IFC w i l l also 
support investments in Tunisia by other regional or other emerging markets investors. 

The Enabling Business Environment for Private Sector (SMEs) Improves 

79. 
The CPS prioritizes improving further the business environment, especially i n the on-shore 
sector o f the economy and f o r SMEs. As the economy opens, the CPS supports a strategy that increases 
the attractiveness o f doing business in Tunisia, building on the continued progress shown to date in this 
area (Doing Business 2010 places Tunisia i n 69th place, an improvement o f four rankings compared to 

27 

2009). The strategy i s based on a large body o f analytical work that has identified the main restrictions to 
doing business and the needed reforms to allow the country to move to a more knowledge-based one. 
Particular focus w i l l be on strengthening competition law and support to SMEs, and tracking progress 
through periodic surveys. This i s being supported by the ICL series, the Export Development Projects, as 
well as through A A A (a possible future AAA could cover specific aspects o f the business environment for 
services sector development - construction, tourism, financial, rea l estate). 

Capacity of the F inanc ia l Sector to Fund Productive Activities Increases 

80. 
The Government i s working on improving the stability o f the banking sector and deepening 
its ability to finance new economic activity. The Government’s work to improve the performance o f the 
financial sector i s on the analysis and recommendations o f the 2006 FSAP by the Bank and the IMF, a 
recent policy note on S M E financing (Appendix 9: SME financing i n Tunisia) and on the on-going 
regional flagship report on the f inanc ia l sector. The assistance o f the Bank, tracked in part through the 
IC L se r ies but delivered mainly through AAA , w i l l center on improving the stability o f the banking 
system by reducing the share o f non-performing loans and increasing the share o f provisioning. In 
addition, the support foresees increasing financial resources from the banking and financial sector towards 
SMEs and the creation o f new companies. IFC w i l l maintain its engagement in the financial sector 
focused on (i) improving access to finance and competitiveness especially o f SMEs; (ii) exploring 
financing opportunities o f large and complex private sector infrastructure investments which w i l l help 
unleash the growth potential o f the country; and ( i i i ) engaging in sectors that are not serviced by Tunisian 
commercial banks, . e.g. IT, health, and education. IFC w i l l re ta in flexibility and continue exploring 
opportunities in Tunisia where i t can add value and where i t has a clear developmental role to play. IFC 
and the Bank w i l l also work together, as requested, on supporting public private partnerships. 

81 . 
Support for the financial sector includes a regional focus. The Bank’s Arab World Initiative 
(AW I ) knowledge program i s looking at the benefits o f greater financial integration in the MENA region 
and the 2010 Flagship Report for MENA w i l l focus on the financial sector. For the Maghreb, the Bank’s 
AAA work encompasses assessing possibilities for enhanced competition and greater scope for 
economies o f scale. The Bank i s aiming to contribute to the Maghreb financial integration effort by 
maintaining an active policy dialogue and offering technical assistance in areas critical for harmonization: 
(i) governance o f the banking system, ( i i ) managing f inanc ia l crises, (iii) accounting, auditing and credit 
reporting; and (iv) insolvency and creditor rights. 

The Foundations for a Knowledge Economy are Strengthened 

82. 

The support f o r the knowledge economy centers on the further development of the I C T 
sector as part o f a strategy that seeks to make the services sector overall more competitive. The ICR 
project (FY05) w i l l continue to be implemented and a new TA w i l l be conducted on innovation and high 
technology that w i l l seek to identify promising high-tech/knowledge-intensive sectors and provide 
guidance on how they should best be supported. Further, to create conditions that foster the development 
o f high value industries, the Bank i s completing a AAA on Competitiveness Poles and would consider 
financing investments as part o f a follow-up project i n FY 1 1 or later years. Such a project would support 
the development o f competitiveness poles to be designed and managed by the private sector targeting 
high value-added industries through the financing o f needed infrastructure, technological platform 
(incubators, technological resources centers), and technical assistance. 

Agriculture Sector Performance Improves 

83 . 
The CPS proposes to continue support f o r agriculture and the ru ra l population. The Bank 
w i l l continue supporting interventions that improve the incomes and socio-economic conditions o f some 

28 

o f Tunisia’s poorest people who live in the r u r a l areas o f the north west o f the country, with a focus on 
farmers associations, SMEs and micro-finance. To this e f fec t , the Bank w i l l prepare a fourth phase o f the 
North West Development Project (FY 1 1 .) The Government has also requested a follow up on the Bank’s 
Agriculture Sector note and Agricultural Support Services Project (which closed in December 2008) with 
an operation in agriculture in FY 1 1. This operation may take the form o f a DPL and would be delivered 
in close cooperation with the EU which has ear-marked budget support in this area.

84 . 
CPS activities under this results area support the objective o f increasing the employability 
o f labor from two perspectives. On the one hand, the CPS includes work to improve the alignment 
between the needs o f the labor market and the supply o f skilled personnel coming into the market. On the 
other hand, the CPS w i l l support the reform o f the labor market in an e f fo r t to combine greater flexibility 
in hiring and firing with a more adequate system o f social assistance that protects workers rather than 
specific jobs. 

Institutional Framework for H igher Education Favors Quality Improvements 

8 5 . 

The CPS supports improvements in the quality o f education and greater adequacy of the 
supply o f s k i l l s to the market. First, the focus on inclusion w i l l continue at a l l levels o f education, while 
at the same time promoting excellence in teaching and learning. I n this regard, higher enrollments are 
expected in secondary and tertiary education, which are supported by the on-going Education and Higher 
Education projects. Here the agenda includes reforms o f the institutions o f higher learning that would 
provide the universities with greater autonomy and would engage the private sector more forcefully in the 
delivery o f educational services. 

Skills of Professionals and Graduates Improve Through Continuous Education 

8 6 . 

The wo rk on s k i l l s and their adequacy w i l l be supported by the Education and H igher 
Education Projects and a S k i l l s Development Project (FY11). The latter w i l l support the government 
to put in place a program that includes (i) consolidation o f the partnership between the training system 
and private sector; (ii) reform o f the financing mechanisms used for pre-service and in-service training; 
and (iii) developing a life-long learning policy framework. The project w i l l define the specific results 
under the program. The AAA program w i l l focus on skills analysis and youth inclusion which w i l l 
encompass analyzing the current skills o f the unemployed youth and how these align to what the market 
needs. 

29 

Fac i l itate Employment Through Effective and Well-Targeted Labor Ma rke t Policies 

87 . 
The CPS w i l l respond to the request o f the Government to support labor market reform 
through a new DPL program on Employment (FYlO), with a focus on easing o f hiring and firing 
restrictions. This DPL i s under preparation and specific reforms are not yet identified. Extensive AAA 
(through the Programmatic ESW on Employment) i s informing the design o f the Employment DPL. This 
DPL, like the ICL, w i l l be closely coordinated with the European Union that also has earmarked budget 
support in this area. The Employment DPL w i l l be delivered in alternate years to the ICL, thus ensuring 
one DPL operation per year in Tunisia. I n addition, the Bank w i l l continue i t s A A A program within a 
programmatic framework which encompasses Active Labor Market Policies (ALMP), study on youth 
exclusion (looking at unemployment issues beyond educated youth), social protection, and education. 
The gender dimensions o f the unemployment challenge w i l l fea ture strongly in these activities. IFC w i l l 
consider investing i n sectors that are both technology-intensive and labor-intensive. Employment 
generation, as well as the skill-intensity o f employment, w i l l remain key selectivity criteria for IFC during 
this CPS period. IFC’s focus on the financial, infrastructure and select high value-added manufacturing 
and social sectors w i l l also support this objective. 

88 . 
The Government and the Bank are discussing options fo r support t o different aspects o f the 
current social protection system. The Bank’s AAA program can provide support for targeted reforms to 
the soc ia l protection systems which can increase labor mobility and job creation, while at the same time 
improving efficiency in budget management. The Government has expressed an interest in support for 
piloting labor-intensive services such as early childhood development, old-age and community nursing 
and after-school tutoring which can be win-win in terms o f human development outcomes and in terms o f 
employment (especially for female and university graduates). Other areas o f work could encompass 
statistical capacity building for better monitoring o f vulnerabilities and impact evaluation o f soc ia l 
programs. The specific activities in this area w i l l be discussed in the CPS Progress Report as confirmation 
on the lines o f engagement i s not yet in place. 

89 . 
At the regional level, the Bank’s program in the Maghreb countries encompasses different 
elements of employability issues (more details are in Appendix 3): (i) skills development - improving 
the quality and relevance o f post basic education to give better job opportunities for young people, 
through the development o f a regional qualifications system; (ii) building the capacity o f management and 
provision o f Quality Assurance (QA) in Higher Education in the MENA countries, to enable them to 
participate in the mutual recognition o f International Qualifications and Standards. The Mediterranean 
Integration Program w i l l help the Tertiary Education Institutions and the Quality Assurance Agencies in 
the MENA region to reach the European QA standards; (iii) activating labor markets,- building the 
capacity (including design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation o f results) for effective labor 
market intermediation institutions to improve matching o f demand and supply for existing skills; better 
employer-focused skills enhancement; facilitating the transition between education and employment; 
creating opportunities for young people to develop entrepreneurial skills and income generating activities, 
supported by twinning arrangements between relevant and interested public sector institutions in the 
EuroMed area; and (iv) improving soc ia l protection and labor management for migrants - in partnership 
with the European Training Foundation (ETF) and IOM, facilitating legal and sa fe intermediation o f labor 
demand and supply across the Mediterranean. 

P i l lar 2. Sustainable Development and Climate Change 

9 0 . 
The CPS supports the government’s commitment to manage the impacts of climate change 
and to maintain the leadership position i t has built i n the region. While Tunisia has been in the 
forefront in MENA on environmental issues, i t still faces serious challenges on environmental 
sustainability and natural resource management. The main challenges include, f i r s t , the limited 

3 0 

availability o f water, which i s likely to decrease in the future and, second, the growing dependence on 
foss i l energy. The Government i s looking to the Bank to step up its assistance to respond to these 
challenges given the Bank’s broad experience in the country through its previous and on-going 
interventions on the environment, energy, agriculture and water sectors and its global knowledge o f 
climate change issues. To respond, the CPS aims to focus efforts to bring about synergies across 
activities around an integrated approach which delivers value-added over the long-term while addressing 
urgent issues. The World Bank Group w i l l therefore target its interventions towards producing results in 
two cluster areas which are: ( i ) strengthening environmental and natural resources management; and (ii) 
promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy. As regards the latter area, the CPS recognizes the 
linkages between this pillar and pillar 1 whereby investment in clean energy can create more jobs per 
dollar invested than investment in foss i l fuel energy. As part o f the CPS program, the Bank w i l l endeavor 
to mobilize greater f inanc ia l support for Tunisia through the Clean Technology Fund, Carbon Funds, GEF 
and other Trust Funds. Greater use o f country systems fo r environmental and other safeguards w i l l also 
be ca r r ied out.

Measures to strengthen the management of water demand in place and measures to increase water 
supply introduced 

9 1. 

The CPS supports Tunisia’s strategy to manage judiciously and in a sustainable manner its 

limited water resources. I t supports both the demand side to curb the use o f water and the supply s ide 
by increasing its availability. On the demand side, the Bank w i l l promote more efficiency in the 
management and operation o f selected irrigation schemes, improved access to and consumption o f 
drinking water in poorly-served rural communities, and strengthening the water institutions in demand 
management practices. The Bank w i l l provide its support through the recently-approved Second Water 
Sector Investment project (FY09) and a follow-up operation in the outer years o f the CPS. On the supply 
side, the Bank w i l l assist in developing the re-use o f treated waste water for irrigation purposes, through 
the planned Northern Tunis Wastewater project and its GEF partner project (both FY lo) , which may also 
have a follow-up operation during the CPS period depending on progress. I n turn, building on the 
Government’s efforts in promoting PPPs in the water sector, the IFC and the Bank w i l l consider investing 
in private-sector sponsored projects in desalination and water sanitation. Tunisia i s one o f the priority 
countries for the IFC comprehensive MENA water sector strategy initiative. 

The AAA program w i l l provide further support to the government in water management 

92. 
through continued evaluation o f the implications o f climate change for water resource management and 
analyzing options for water supply-augmenting projects (desalination and waste-water re-use), which 

3 1 

could be submitted to careful cost-benefit analysis, explicitly incorporating future climate change 
scenarios and developing analytical tools required to deal with trade-offs. The Bank w i l l also continue to 
support key reforms and institutional strengthening, building on the recently-completed Water and 
Sanitation Strategy (April 2009 ) , through further promoting demand-driven water management, 
incentivizing water savings and better controlling ground water extraction. The Bank w i l l provide 
technical advice to the Government in the re-balancing o f water resource allocation in favor o f higher 
value added production in irrigated agriculture through the proposed Agriculture/Climate Change Project 
(FY 11). Other areas o f support through regional and country AAA would be in helping the Government 
with disaster risk management based on Tunisia’s vulnerability to weather induced hazards whereby the 
Bank can work with the Government on mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into priority sectors to 
mitigate disaster risks. 

Progress in Managing the Impacts of Climate Change 

93 . 
The Bank w i l l support Tunisia’s efforts to improve land management practices, w ith 
emphasis on creating sustainable production systems in ru ra l areas. The focus o f the Bank’s work 
w i l l be on helping farmers improve agricultural productivity and natural resource management through 
so i l and water conservation, small-scale irrigation, agro-forestry and pasture improvements. The goal i s 
to ease the vulnerability o f some o f the poorest communities in Tunisia and develop better capacity to 
manage the impacts o f climate change. Bank support for these efforts w i l l be provided through the 
Community Based Integrated Rural Development Project (FY 10) and its GEF complement the Water and 
Land Optimization Project. An Agriculture/Climate Change project w i l l also be delivered in FY 1 1 (as 
mentioned in paragraph 83 ) . Other projects already mentioned, the Northern Tunis Wastewater project 
(FY10) and the North West Development Project (FY11) w i l l also contribute to improving land 
management practices and incorporate as necessary disaster risk reduction measures. Tunisia i s also the 
recipient o f a PHRD Grant on Climate Change o f the Forest Ecosystem that w i l l provide further synergies 
with other Bank work. The Bank w i l l continue i t s support to help Tunisia reduce ozone depleting 
substances in the country through the on-going Ozone Depleting Substances project. The Gu l f o f Gabes 
project w i l l continue to focus on coastal environmental issues that are being exacerbated by climate 
change. 

The Negative Environmental and Health Impact in Cities is Reduced 

94. 
The CPS supports the country’s environment agenda to meet the mounting urban 
challenges. Objectives o f the government’s environment agenda in urban areas include improving 
municipal solid waste management practices, containing coastal erosion, developing infrastructure that i s 
adapted to climate change impacts, and reducing landfill gas emissions and the production o f ozone 
depleting substances (these issues are being supported by the on-going portfolio o f projects - Gulf of 
Gabes, Ozone Depleting Substances, Landfill Gases Project, Municipal Development and Sustainable 
Municipal Solid Waste Management). I n particular, the CPS provides concerted support to consolidate 
improvements in solid waste collection, disposal/treatment and management services, with a focus on cost 
effectiveness and environmental sustainability while benefiting from carbon finance funds. The on-going 
Municipal Solid Waste Management Project and Municipal Development projects w i l l provide this 
support. 

9 5 . 
Lastly, the Bank w i l l use several regional initiatives to provide further support to Tunisia i n 
addressing climate change especially in the context o f the A rab Wo r ld Initiative. Relevant initiatives 
include a multi-donor regional climate change trust fund, study on soc ia l impacts o f climate change, an 
assessment o f the climate change ecosystem o f the region, technical support to planning and capacity fo r 
was te water treatment and a regional analysis looking at the economic and soc ia l impacts o f climate 
change on agriculture. The city o f Tunis i s also covered under a regional study on the vulnerability o f 

32 

coastal cities to climate change and natural disaster. In the water sector, MENA supports capacity 
building o f institutions such as the Arab Water Council, and activities such as the Arab Water 
Management Initiative, Regional Water Initiative and a regional IDF in Public Engagement in Water 
Management. Finally, the M a r s e i l l e Center for Mediterranean Integration has two relevant programs on 
Strategic Urban Development and Cities and Climate Change which w i l l also fac i l i ta te knowledge 
sharing in the region. 

Results Area 4: Promoting Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 

Improve Energy Intensity 
Reduce dependency on fossil fuels 

Improve Energy Intensity 

Reduced energy intensity o f GDP 
Decline in Green House Gas emissions 
Increased energy efficiency investment 
Increase the share o f renewable energy in primary 
energy 

96. 
The Bank’s program supports the ambitious strategy o f the Government i n the energy 
sector to reduce the intensity o f energy by 3% per year which recognizes the importance o f effective 
energy efficiency policy and related investments. The goals o f this program include (i) providing a 
larger and more secure energy supply through scale-up o f the potential in renewable sources; (ii) 
promoting enhanced energy efficiency in key sectors such as industry, transport and residential buildings; 
and (iii) contributing to global efforts to control carbon emissions. The design o f the strategy under this 
pillar has benefited from Bank’s AAA delivered mainly through the Programmatic ESW which i s 
supported by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) Global Partnership (a type o f 
trust fund). The ESMAP covers various studies to review the country’s energy management policy, 
assess the options for pricing methodologies and procedures, identify barriers to energy efficiency 
improvements, increase penetration o f renewables and make recommendations to scale up investment in 
energy efficiency and renewable energy . 

97. 
T o increase the supply of efficient energy, the Bank i s helping develop a local market to 
finance energy-efficiency investments by the private sector. To this effect, the recently-approved 
Energy Efficiency Project (FY09) provides l i n e s o f credit to financial institutions in Tunisia to finance 
investments and assistance to develop the capacity to evaluate these investments. Pending on the pace o f 
project progress and the demand from the private sector, the Bank would consider a follow-up operation 
later in the CPS period. The Bank i s also supporting enhanced energy efficiency in the industrial sector 
through the implementation o f a Global Environment Facility (GEF) Energy Efficiency project (FY05). 
Another GEF grant has been requested by the Government o f Tunisia in FY 10 to complement the Energy 
Efficiency IBRD project through technical assistance and biomass pilot projects. 
In turn, IFC i s 
committed to support viable renewable energy investments, contingent on the evolution o f the Tunisian 
regulatory environment and the availability o f well designed private sec tor sponsored renewable energy 
generation projects. In a first phase, this w i l l consist o f providing financing, as needed, to industrial 
companies seeking to generate wind power fo r their own consumption. I n a second phase, IFC w i l l also 
consider solar generation projects. 

Reduce Dependency on Fossil Fuels 

98. 
I n a further effort to increase domestic supply of non-fossil fuel energy, the Bank i s working 
w ith the Tunisian authorities on accessing resources o f the Clean Technology Fund (CTF ) in order 
to help the country use i t s large, and largely untapped, renewable energy potential for wind and solar 

3 3 

energy. Tunisia’s solar energy potential could be promoted in the context o f the Bank’s regional initiative 
on Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), launched together with the African Development Bank, which i s 
likely to get up to $750 million concessional financing for the region from the Clean Technology Fund 
(see Appendix 5 for details). This initiative has synergies with the Mediterranean Solar Plan which 
promotes CSP and other renewable technologies, as well as regional market integration. Tunisia has 
already proposed several projects for consideration in the CSP regional investment plan. Further support 
to develop wind energy w i l l come through preparing a carbon finance operation that w i l l purchase 
Certificates o f Emissions Reductions (CER) from the S id i Daoud wind farm o f 3 4 MW . Several other 
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects are in preparation with Bank assistance, including a 
solid waste project and a gas flaring reduction project. 

99. 
To curb energy demand, the Bank i s preparing a Low Carbon Transport Strategy in support 
o f the Government’s stated objectives o f improving the energy efficiency o f the transport sector and 
reduce i t s vulnerability to o i l price increases while decreasing GHG emissions, a ir pollution, and noise 
pollution through some specific strategic decisions and actions. This i s part o f the NDP ’s focus for the 
transport sector on energy savings activities as part o f an overall coherent strategy to reduce energy 
consumption and pollution. 

100. The CPS supports sharing o f knowledge on energy at the regional level, where Tunisia’s 
experience can serve as a model in various areas and should contribute to activities under the AW I . 
For instance Tunisia has been conducting industrial audits and offering capital subsidies for energy 
efficiency investments since the la te 1980s, and the approach could be adopted by other countries. The 
U M A (Union for Arab Maghreb) organization has set-up several committees to improve cross-country 
cooperation and one o f them i s focusing on energy efficiency programs in industry and buildings. The 
Bank i s coordinating on these initiatives. In addition, the Bank i s bringing international knowledge to 
inform the thinking behind a possible creation o f a regional energy market by being an honest broker in 
helping cross-border coordination, bringing experience from other regions and ca ta ly t ic financing, 
including for interconnection projects within the Maghreb. The Bank has very recently been asked by the 
Government to provide technical assistance to the early stages o f a possible interconnection project 
between Tunisia and Italy that would involve a sub-marine cable between the two countries. This could 
eventually lead to a future request for financing o f the project. 

P i l la r 3. Improving the Quality o f Service Delivery 

101. 
Following good progress in ensuring access to services, the Government sees as the next 
challenge to improve the quality o f service delivery, particularly as regards delivery o f services to 
citizens (education, health, and municipal services.) The support under the CPS i s grouped around two 
results areas: ( i ) improving the quality o f social services; and (ii) strengthening the capacity o f the state at 
central and municipal levels to deliver quality services.

102. 

The CPS w i l l support the Government’s commitment to the continued transformation o f 
the education system and address the efficiency in the delivery o f health services. In education the 

strategy o f the government is: (a) to continue improving access in secondary and tertiary education; (b) to 
work on quality at all levels; and (c) to achieve a greater level o f matching between the supply o f the 
educational system and the needs o f the market. I n line with this strategy, the government has asked the 
Bank to provide support through the Employment DPL, Education, Higher Education, and Skills 
Development projects, which have already been discussed under the first pillar. 

The Quality of Service Delivery and Long-Tem Efficiency at Hospitals Improves 

,103. 
I n the health sector, after tw o years o f Wor ld Bank technical assistance, the Government 
has invited the Bank to work on improving the quality o f hospital service delivery and the efficiency 

and sustainability o f financing for health services. The Bank w i l l respond to this request for advice and 
resources to improve service delivery at hospitals through a Health project, which w i l l be delivered in 
FY 11 . Support to the health sector w i l l also be provided through an Avian Flu Trust Fund that was 
activated in August 2009.

Capacity of the Public Management System Improves 

104. A t the level o f the central Government, the CPS w i l l continue to support the M in istry of 
Finance with the modernization o f budgetary practices. The Bank, in close cooperation with the EU, 

i s providing ana ly t ica l and methodological support to strengthen budget management through multi-year 
programming and improved expenditure efficiency through performance-based budgeting (PBS). The 
work undertaken thus far has already led to the development o f MTEFs i n education, higher education, 
and vocational training. In mid-2009, a PEFA exercise was launched in Tunisia which w i l l analyze and 
make recommendations on strengthening the public expenditure management system, and provide a 
benchmark to track future progress. The Bank w i l l also continue to work with Tunisia on the successful 
experience o f using country systems for financial management by further integration and alignment o f the 
country’s PFM arrangements with international standards and good practice. In this regard, two main 

3 5 

areas w i l l be the focus o f attention; (i) move towards computerization o f the accounting system which 
remains manual despite a well computerized budget; and ( i i ) supporting a more comprehensive view o f 
the public sector control systems and framework. 

105. Additional support includes assistance with the reform o f public administration. The 
Government has recently requested the Bank to mobilize Trust Fund financing fo r the National Program 
fo r the Development o f the Public Administration (known by its French acronym PROQAP). This 
program i s an ambitious one that targets the modernization o f the public administration through (i) 
focusing on the quality o f services to the public and enterprises, especially as regards services targeted a t 
SMEs and the R&D sector; ( i i ) reducing costs through optimization o f procedures and ( i i i ) strengthening 
human resources. Bank support w i l l come through AAA and the mobilization o f trust fund resources. 

Living Conditions in Urban Areas Improved 

106. 
The CPS supports strengthening o f municipalities to deliver better services and bring about 
improved living conditions in urban areas. The main thrust in this regard foresees strengthening the 
operational capacity o f the Caisse de Pr&t et de Soutien aux Collectivites Loca les (CPSCL) that provides 
lending to and manages central transfers to municipalities. The Bank’s contribution centers on the design 
o f incentives to improve municipal finance performance and on the upgrading o f the capacity o f CPSCL 
to select projects and co-finance investments. The Government has asked the Bank to continue its support 
and focus in addition on large agglomerations and on the preparation o f urban development strategies 
focused on environment sustainability issues. The main instrument to support these objectives w i l l 
continue to be the Bank’s Municipal Development Project, which i s now in its third phase and fo r which a 
fourth phase i s planned under the CPS. The expectation i s that these efforts w i l l contribute to improving 
the living conditions in urban areas, the perception o f which w i l l be tracked by the follow-up Municipal 
Development project through periodic surveys. 

107. Complementary efforts to improve the quality o f l i f e in urban areas center on waste 
management, sanitation, urban services and preserving cultural heritage. Rapid urbanization i s 
putting pressure on sanitation services and waste management. The Government has requested the Bank 
for a follow-on operation to the Solid Waste Management project with delivery likely in F Y I 2 to 
consolidate improvements in solid waste collection, disposalhreatment f a c i l i t i e s and management 
services, with a focus on cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability, benefiting from carbon 
finance funds. 

Mo re Efficient and Sustainable Development of Cultural Heritage Potential 

108. 
The Government has indicated its desire to have a follow-up Cu ltura l Heritage project to 
the one currently underway that would cover issues o f heritage preservation (including rehabilitation o f 
old urban centers, medinas), cultural industries, urban management, and lo ca l economic development. 
The Bank w i l l seek to continue to innovate in responding to this request and to ensure synergy with other 
urban and municipal development projects underway or planned. 

F. 

Financing 

109. 
The proposed IBRD lending program i s confirmed for FYlO through official requests 
received from Government and project preparation i s already underway (Table 2). Tunisia can 
access a financial envelope o f up to $280 million in FY10, o f which 25% i s likely to be development 
policy lending. This financing w i l l be sufficient to cover the Government’s IBRD requests in FY10. 

36 

Thereafter, the Government would likely only request higher levels o f IBRD financing should i t face a 
protracted difficult global environment and not mobilize sufficient financing elsewhere either on the loca l 
or global markets’*. Such a request would be considered in the context o f IBRD’s overall resource 
availability. 

110. 
The lending program f o r FY11-13 i s indicative at this stage and w i l l be managed in the 
context o f country demand and the Bank’s ability to service such demand in the context o f its 
capital position. For now, the Government has indicated i t s project requests for FY 1 1, o f which several 
are already under preparation. The FY 12 and FY 13 lending program i s indicative only and currently 
outlines the natural evolution o f the Bank’s long-term engagement in certain sectors and thus foresees 
follow-up DPLs fo r Integration and Competitiveness and for Employment, as well as follow-up 
investment operations in Education, Higher Education, Energy Efficiency, Water Sector Investment, 
Tunis Wastewater and Solid Waste Management. These and other possible new operations would be 
agreed with Government during the course o f CPS implementation and as the country situation evolves.

R I S K S AND IM P L EM EN TA T ION CHALLENGES 

1 1 1 . 
The global c r i s i s i s the most immediate risk facing Tunisia due to the recession in the EU 
and Tunisia’s dependence on the EU market for its exports. Should the crisis continue across the 
medium-term, this w i l l likely result in a further drop in demand for Tunisia’s exports and a reduction in 
foreign direct investment. The economic risks can be partly mitigated through continued strong 
macroeconomic management: Tunisia’s track record shows that i t has good capacity to respond to 
negative shocks and, so far, i t has weathered the impacts well. The Bank hopes to help mitigate this risk 
through ensuring close monitoring o f the overall macroeconomic context through regular liaison and 
dialogue with the Government and an enhanced AAA program that focuses on management o f macro- 
risks and impact o f the global crisis, as well as just-in-time analysis o f options for remedial measures. I f 
the crisis proves longer-lived, the Bank’s program can be adapted through the application o f the principle 
o f flexibility. 

3 8 

112. 
IFC’s program may also be affected in the event o f a continued deterioration o f Tunisia’s 
macroeconomic situation, declines in FDI, and reduced risk appetite o f loca l and foreign investors. 
During the f inanc ia l crisis, IFC has been actively engaged in portfolio management and i s ready to 
provide assistance to existing clients i n need o f restructuring their companies to adjust to the external 
environment. IFC also actively stepped up to mitigate the impact o f the sharp contraction o f available 
external private financing by initiating early discussions with interested bidders in relation to ongoing 
infrastructure PPPs (power and water) on alternative financing options and IFC’s potential contributions. 

1 1 3 . 
There i s a risk that the desired outcome o f the increase in public investment w i l l not 
materialize because of lack o f fiscal space to follow through on the stimulus package. Given 
Tunisia’s room to engage more public debt, the financing from loca l and external sources (including 
IBRD and other development partners) should help to mitigate any possible squeezing in f i s c a l space. 
Moreover, the Government has consistently shown that i t adheres to i t s f i s c a l deficit targets (below 3%) 
and manages its reserves prudently. This macroeconomic management provides a solid foundation for 
responding to the negative impacts and suggests that policy w i l l respond in the face o f negative shocks. 
The launch o f the PEFA in mid-2009 could also allow the Bank and other partners to provide an updated 
assessment on the management o f public finances. 

114. 
The nature and ambition o f the reform agenda may be such that only slow progress w i l l be 
made. The goal o f the Bank Group’s program i s to ascertain carefully when opportunities for addressing 
difficult issues arise, build on the analytical foundation and then respond in a supportive and beneficial 
way. Tunisia has shown that i t engages steadily but, in some cases, slowly on reforms as many important 
reform measures are based on a consultative and consensus-building approach that takes time. Given the 
complexity o f such reform measures, a key consideration for this CPS includes the need to be more 
sensitive to the time-frame o f reforms and not just the substance o f reforms. This underscores the 
importance o f ensuring knowledge sharing on the “how” o f reforms and not just the “what”. The Bank 
Group w i l l also endeavor to have wider dissemination o f analytic work and continued consultations with 
development partners, c iv i l society, private sector and other actors to help generate a broad consensus for 
reform. The impact o f the c r i s i s may have a positive effect here as i t underscores the urgency o f timely 
reforms to ensure that the economy - and the private sector in particular - can respond. 
1 1 5 . 
There i s a risk that the NDP may not achieve the desired success and that growth rates w i l l 
remain respectable (at 4-5 percent) but not reach a higher level. I t i s possible that the risks already 
identified above w i l l combine with a slow implementation o f the NDP and Tunisia would, in the medium- 
term, get stuck exporting low-productivity goods and would not be able to master the high-productivity 
knowledge-intensive course that i t wants to take. The Bank Group hopes to mitigate this risk through a 
broad program o f support to the goal o f transforming the economy that encompasses global integration, 
private sector development (especially SMEs), skills development, education, labor market reforms and 
innovation. I n particular, the Bank Group w i l l make available international best-practice knowledge to 
Tunisia and can draw on i t s global experience in other countries that have pursued such a path. 

116. 
There are implementation risks to the Bank’s program given the problems o f slow 
procurement. Tunisia’s track record in implementing IBRD investment projects i s satisfactory but .not 
stellar and there i s a room f o r more progress to be made here. Mitigation measures being taken include a 
gradual increase in the use o f the DPL instrument within the allowed lending envelope, continued AAA in 
support o f the Government’s re fo rm program which focuses on implementation, continued intensive 
procurement training and stepped-up portfolio support on the investment portfolio through reinforcement 
o f the Bank’s decentralized team in the Tunis office. The risk o f implementation delays in the DPLs i s 
being mitigated through careful design that takes into account the necessary time-frame for reforms and 
lays out a building-block approach to reform measures to ensure continued engagement.

CAS COMPLET ION REPORT 

Date a f CAS: June 3 ,2004 
Date o f CAS Progress Report: September 2 1,2007 
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: June 2004 - Ma rch 2009 
CAS Completion Report completed by: 

Sophie Muller, Junior Professional Associate, and Eavan O’Halloran, Senior Coun try O f f icer , w i th 
con tr ibu t ions f rom Coun try Team members. 

Date: Ap r i l 2009 

Summary 

The CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the contribution o f the Bank’s program in Tunisia for the period 
June 2004 -March 2009 . I t concludes that the CAS strategic objectives were consistent with the government 
program and the country’s long term goals. 

Under CAS pillar I “Strengthening the business environment and improving the competitiveness o f the Tunisian 
economy”, c lea r results have been obtained in areas such as trade integration, access and quality o f service in the 
transport, water, and energy sectors, protection o f the environment and the strengthening o f the banking sector. 
Good progress has been recorded in improving the investment climate and business environment, although there i s 
s t i l l room for hr ther gains in this area. 

Under pillar I 1 “Enhance skills and employability o f graduates and labor force in a knowledge economy”, significant 
progress has been made in terms o f efficiency at a l l educational levels, while results have been modest regarding the 
relevance o f the education system, employability o f the labor force and development o f a knowledge economy, and 
insufficient in terms o f financial sustainability o f the education system. 

Achievements o f pillar I11 “Improve the quality o f social services through enhanced efficiency o f public 
expenditures”, are notable as regards f i s c a l mobilization and debt management, where very strong results were 
achieved. Progress in the areas o f soc ia l protection policies has been slower than expected and only more recently 
has some progress been made. L i t t l e progress has been achieved i n the areas o f health and pension where the Bank’s 
program during the CAS period was limited. 

The Bank’s program in Tunisia i s characterized by a good country dialogue as the Tunisian Authorities value the 
Bank’s support, especially fo r the knowledge aspect o f the Bank’s work. However, the CASCR highlights 
implementation delays - based mainly on slow procurement - as a recurring issue that has affected the portfolio 
quality. 

An important conclusion o f the CAS CR i s that Tunisia made steady progress i n areas where i t committed to reforms 
and provided the necessary leadership and resources, although sometimes the pace o f this progress was slower than 
expected. This was due to the political sensitivities o f the reforms and the need t o build consensus across 
stakeholders in the country which naturally demand more time. 

Key considerations for the next CPS period include the need to be more aligned with the country’s own na t iona l 
development plan, be more sensitive to the time-frame o f r e f o rm s and not just the substance o f reforms, and to 
provide enhanced support to Government in addressing unemployment.

Introduction 

1. 
The CAS completion report (CASCR) assesses the effectiveness o f the 2004 Country 
Assistance Strategy for Tunisia in bringing about expected results and highlights the lessons 
learned over the period. The report’s conclusions w i l l inform the new Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS). I t i s an evaluation tool for the Bank’s country team to help guide strategic thinking for the future 
and lea rn important lessons from past engagement. 

2. 
I n addition to discussions w ith the country team, this assessment i s based on reference 
documents such as the CAS, the CAS Progress Report, Project Implementation Status and Results 
Reports, supervision reports (Aide-Memoires and Back-to-office Reports), Implementation Completion 
Reports, IEG reports and QAG Assessments. The draft o f the CASCR has been shared with the Tunisian 
Government and their reactions and comments w i l l be incorporated. 

3 . 
The 2004 CAS had a strong focus on results with a detailed results matrix. As such, i t 
provides a set o f core measurable outcomes that has helped guide the implementation o f the 
program and facilitated’ the assessment process. Since i t was the first attempt by the Bank in Tunisia to 
systematically identify results and indicators, i t was conceived as a jo in t learning exercise where lessons 
learned would help design subsequent monitoring and evaluation efforts. However, the results matrix had 
important weaknesses - i t was very ambitious, over-reaching and applied a standard o f attribution rather 
than contribution to the Bank’s activities in influencing development outcomes. Moreover, the Bank’s 
program i n Tunisia evolved significantly from what was laid out at the time o f the CAS so many 
important activities were not encapsulated in the results matrix. 

I. Tunisia’s Long Te rm Strategic Goals 
4. 
The 2004 CAS was designed to support Tunisia’s l o t h National Development P lan (2002- 
2006) whose main goals were to (a) accelerate the pace o f growth in order to reduce unemployment, boost 
incomes, and consolidate Tunisia’s progress in the reduction o f poverty; (b) foster the emergence of a 
knowledge economy in order to take advantage o f Tunisia’s valuable human resources and f a c i l i t a t e 
integration in the global economy; and (c) uphold social achievements by ensuring that a l l social groups 
participate in the benefits o f economic and social development. 

5 . 
I n 2006, the Government set an ambitious agenda to double per capita incomes by 2016 and 
to reduce unemployment from 14 percent to 10 percent over the same period. Tunisia’s 1 Ith National 
Development Plan for the period 2007-11 supports this agenda and i s based on four pillars: (a) 
accelerating private sector driven growth; (b) maintaining macro stability; (c) upholding social 
achievements and human development and (d) preserving natural resources. 
6. 
The key challenges identified i n the CAS - (a) employment growth and (b) maintenance o f 
macro stability and social achievements - were fully i n line w ith the Government’s development 
agenda. The three strategic objectives (pillars) se t out in the CAS: (a) strengthened investment climate 
and competitiveness, (b) improved education quality and graduate employability for an increasingly 
knowledge-based economy, and (c) improved social services through more e f f i c i e n t public expenditure-- 
also respond directly to the goals o f the 1 lth Plan. 

7 . 

Du r ing the CAS period, Tunisia made progress towards these long-term strategic goals, 
although challenges remain. The GDP growth surpassed the average rate o f 5 percent a year that had 
been anticipated in the base case scenario, since i t reached 5 . 5 percent i n 2006, 6.3 percent in 2007 and 
4.5 percent in 2008 (thus averaging a 5.4% growth rate over the period). This i s particularly good given 
the impact o f the global economic slowdown in 2008. Overall, recent growth performance reflects the 

50 

dynamic behavior o f exports, robust private consumption and growing foreign investments. Tunisia has 
been particularly successful in integrating into the global economy thanks to trade reforms, the 
establishment o f a f r e e trade area between Tunisia and the EU for industrial goods in January 2008, and 
the signing o f a large number o f trade agreements with other partners. Sound macroeconomic 
management has allowed Tunisia to resist adverse shocks, including the Multi-Fiber Agreement 
dismantling in 2005. 
Tunisia committed to reforms in pr ior ity areas - such as supporting private sector 
development (as witnessed by continued improvements in its rank ing on Doing Business indicators) 
and reforming higher education - and indeed some notable progress was made. However, reforms 
took longer than anticipated which had an impact on the expected results. The modest level o f gross 
private sector investment (between 13 and 14 percent between 2005-2008), remains a concern that i s 
shared by the Government and the Bank. Moving forward, the Government recognizes the need for 
building on past progress and strengthening reforms to support private sector investment and to ensure 
that growth and investment further accelerate and translate into job creation. 

8 . 

9 . 

Despite the admirable progress on economic management, the unemployment challenge 
remains and i s threatening Tunisia’s good economic and social achievements. The 1 lth Plan 
considered that an annual growth rate o f at least 6.1 percent was needed to reduce unemployment. While 
growth has been respectable, i t f e l l short o f this target (except in 2007) and no progress was made in 
terms o f reducing the unemployment r a t e over the CAS period, which hovers around 14 percent o f the 
labor force. 

11. Progress and Achievements of CAS Outcomes 

10. 
Outcomes fo r each CAS p i l la r are analyzed i n terms o f the pillar’s main objective, related 
Bank instruments and the CAS monitoring indicators. I t i s understood that activities in any particular 
pillar are likely to contribute to the outcomes o f other pillars, that CAS activities build on each other, and 
that each outcome i s likely to be influenced by more than one instrument and by activities in other pillars. 
Consequently, pillars are not separated or seen in isolation, but as the main arteries through which efforts 
and resources flow in the direction towards achieving the CAS goals. 

1 1 . 
Although the results matr ix has proved relevant in the assessment process, some weaknesses 
have been noted. I t was far too detailed and ambitious given the nature o f the Bank’s program and o f ten 
the choice o f indicators was not the most appropriate. The CAS had clearly indicated the need to better 
define some indicators as the implementation was progressing, and se t the CAS Progress Report as an 
opportunity to do so. Yet, i t seems that this has not been done as the result-matrix does not report relevant 
updates. Where data on indicators i s weak, the assessment has also used information related to CAS 
 milestone^'^ and incorporated qualitative judgments. The CAS results are collectively summarized in 
Annex 1 . 

A. P i l la r I Outcomes: Strengthening the business environment and improving the 
competitiveness o f the Tunisian economy 
This CAS p i l lar responded directly to both the l o t h Development P lan (2002-2006) and the 
12. 
llth plan (2007-2011) that set the objectives to accelerate growth, integrate Tunisia to the global 
economy and promote the r o l e of the private sector. The ECAL I V project and the Bank’s A A A work 
have been the backbone o f the Bank’s engagement i n the competitiveness agenda. Building on the 

l 4 CAS milestones are intermediate outcomes that were incorporated to the results matrix to track implementation towards 
expected CAS outcomes. 

5 1 

analytical work, the ECAL IV focused on improving the regulatory framework for private investment and 
strengthening competition. Overall, CAS outcomes under this pillar have been satisfactory. Clear results 
have been obtained in areas such as trad,e integration, access and quality o f service in the transport, water, 
and energy sectors, protection o f the environment ‘and the strengthening o f the banking sector. The 
promotion o f economic competition has, however, yielded more moderate results. 

13 . 
I n i t s M a r ch 2009 report, I E G evaluated the Bank’s performance in Tunisia on earnings 
growth and employment creation and gave the Bank’s Program a satisfactory outcome rating. The 

report concluded the following (i) the Bank’s strategy and interventions were relevant to the issues; ( i i ) 
performance was strongest in the Bank’s support to macroeconomic policy; (iii) there was a positive 
contribution from the Bank on trade liberalization and f i s c a l policy; and (iv) high quality work was 
delivered on the financial sector, including work undertaken jointly with the IMF.

The CAS monitoring indicator shows considerable progress, other relevant data provide 

important contextual elements. The CAS monitoring indicator, which was the increase in annual 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows, surpassed the target, as shown in table 1. However, the IEG 
report o f the ECAL IV points out that FD I was relatively limited in a few sectors - the large increase in 
FD I in 2006 reflects US$2 .35 billion received from the partial privatization o f Tunisie TBlecom, and 
around two thirds o f overall 2007 FDI went to the energy sector.

The CAS monitoring indicator may not be the most suitable to assess achievements under 

this outcome. As stated i n the CAS, this outcome also has to be measured against indicators o f the ECAL 
IV”, which were defined a f te r the CAS and the result matrix were finalized. One o f the ECAL IV 
indicators shows that investments by on-shore and off-shore companies have increased but the target set 
in 2005 was not met: On-shore investment grew by 6.1% instead o f 9.7% and off-shore investment grew 
by 17.7% instead o f 37.9% (perhaps reflecting overly ambitious expected indicators at that time). The 
ICR o f the ECAL IV indicates that the number o f private investment opportunities increased and the 
number o f administrative authorizations for private investment and the delays in granting authorizations 
have been reduced. However, the CAS Progress Report expressed concern about the low level o f 
domestic private investments, and highlighted the need fo r better understanding the reasons for i t and 
identifying measures to help the authorities redress the situation. Further improvements o f the business 
climate are being supported by the F Y 0 9 Integration and Competitiveness Loan - IC L (proposed in the 
CAS as ECAL V), which was approved by the Board i n March 2009. I n addition, t h e L o i sur l ’ l n i t i a t i v e 
Econom ique that was enacted in December 2007 contains several “investment climate” reforms, including 

’’ PDO Indicators o f the ECAL I V are: (i) level o f bank provisioning as a share o f NPLs; (ii) j o b creation by private sector; ( i i i ) 
evolution o f investment by on-shore and off-shore companies; ( iv ) evolution o f FDI and (v) number and amount o f new l i f e 
insurance contracts.

provision on the protection o f investors; and the level o f private investment showed some recovery signs 
in 2008. 

16. 
The Bank contributed to noticeable results with regard to the tax system, the increased 
transparency o f accounting standards and the improvement o f the competition regulatory 
framework. Following an assessment o f the f i s c a l system, undertaken as part o f the ECAL I V project, 
the f i s c a l Law no. 2006-80 was enacted in December 2006, normalizing V A T rates and reimbursement 
mechanisms and simplifying the relationship between tax payers and tax administration. The standard rate 
o f corporation tax was reduced from 3 5 percent to 30 percent in order to increase competitiveness and 
encourage investment. The ECAL IV also contributed to improved transparency and respect o f 
international accounting standards with the requirement for public companies to publish certified financial 
statements. The Competition Authority and the competition regulatory framework have been improved 
thanks to the Law 2005-6 that aims at strengthening the power o f the Competition council, notably in 
terms o f auto-seizure, the council’s independence and actions taken against unfair competition. However, 
the Global Integration Study underlined that while Tunisia’s competition laws meet international 
standards, implementation issues remain and the capacities o f the competition authorities could be 
enhanced. Recognizing this situation, the Government undertook to pursue these reforms with the support 
o f the Bank’s Integration and Competitiveness Loan (FY09). 

17. 

Some progress has been made towards other CAS milestones such as leveling o f the playing 
field between off-shore and on-shore firms and upgrading the capacity o f the judiciary. Despite 
considerable Government’s efforts to reduce the incentive gap between onshore and offshore sectors in 
recent years, as witnessed by the continued improvement in the Doing Business indicators and other 
indexes such as the Global Competitiveness Repod6, the on-shore sector s t i l l faces constraints. In 
contrast with offshore firms, formal enterprises selling in the domestic market cite what they perceive as 
anti-competitive practices and unfair competition stemming from privilege, informality, tax and soc ia l 
security avoidance. Following a round-table o f magistrates that took place in January 2007 to assess 
Bankruptcy procedures, bankruptcy regulations have been implemented. 

18 . 
Sustainability o f the outcomes o f the E C A L I V i s high due to the particular attention given 
to supporting the reform program, the clear commitment o f the authorities and the synergy 
between donors supporting the reforms (the WB, A fDB and the EU). The design was the result o f an 
extensive dialogue with the Tunisian authorities, which were very active in the loan preparation and, in 
some cases, went beyond the committed benchmarks o f the loan agreement. This activity i s also a good 
example o f donor coordination since i t was designed, implemented and supervised jointly with the EU 
and the A fDB . The cooperation between partners was excellent and the presence o f the EU, World Bank 
and the A fDB in Tunis helped the dialogue between a l l three institutions and with the Government. 

19. 
O the r activities proposed i n the CAS have not been carried out, at the client’s specific 
request. The Investment Climate Assessment was not conducted as planned because the authorities 
wished to carry out the analysis on their own, with some limited level o f Bank support. This involvement 
helped foster country ownership and capacity building but, at the same time, did not allow for 
international benchmarking. Instead o f producing an ICA, and as requested by the client, the Bank 
delivered a SME Study. Focusing on SME development, the study provided concrete recommendations 
for the reforms o f the technical centers o f the Ministry o f Industry and o f industrial land management in 
Tunisia, and contributed valuable input to the Ministry o f Industry’s strategy in these two areas. Another 
result o f the study was the capacity building o f IEQ (Institut d’Economie Quantitative) to independently 
conduct ICA surveys and analyze the data. 

l 6 Tunisia’s ranking on the Do ing Business Indicators improved from 8 I i n DB2008 to 73 i n DB2009 and 69Ih i n DB2010. I n 
the 2009 Global Competitiveness Index, Tunisia i s ranked a commendable 361h place.

Two out of four indicators were met, as shown i n table 3, and two CAS milestones” were 

20. 
achieved, which are the revision o f the Customs Code and the continued reduction o f the number o f 
tar i f fs on imports outside the E U (wh ich was reduced from 14 to 9). Some reductions also took place i n 
the applied most-favored nation (MFN) tar i f fs on imports o f inputs and intermediate products from the 
rest o f the world. L i t t l e progress was made, however, w i th regard to the dismantlement o f import 
monopolies and the modernization o f commercial registries. A study on the modernization o f commercial 
registries was carried out by the Bank in 2004, but no action was taken by the Government un t i l March 
2009 when the Inter-Ministerial Council o f Tunisia adopted a draft law amendment designed to ensure an 
effective updating o f the information contained i n commercial registries. This measure was a pr ior action 
o f the I C L that was approved by the Board in March 2009. 

21. 

Strong results were achieved in the areas o f customs and trade facilitation thanks to the 
Bank’s Export Development projects I and 11. Ac t iv i t ies supported by the Expor t Development I 

project, which was rated satisfactory by IEG, helped improve trade transactions. Customs clearance and 
technical controls now take 2 days on average, compared w i th an average o f 8 days in 2003. This was 
achieved through the s imp l i f ica t ion and adoption o f international standards for trade documentation, and 

” ICT Sector Development project was called Information Society project during CAS preparation. 
CAS milestones are intermediate outcomes that were incorporated to the results matrix to track implementation towards 
expected CAS outcomes.

the establishment of electronic processing, through the creation o f a semi-public agency (Tunisie Tradenet 
- TTN). These results are likely to be sustainable as the modernized customs are now more focused on 
trade facilitation than control. However, there i s a need for stronger coordination among different 
agencies involved in the TTN network to acce lera te progress in this regard. This issue i s currently being 
addressed by the second Export Development project (EDP2), which pursues the same development 
objectives and also includes a component on WTO technical barriers to trade enquiry point. Additional 
financing of the EDP2 was granted in FY08 to respond to the high demand for Export Market Access 
Fund (EMAF) services by the private sector. As o f March 2008, this operation i s making satisfactory 
progress. I n addition, the ECAL I V contributed to the implementation o f measures designed to reimburse 
V A T taxes more quickly to those doing international business, which should crea te an incentive for 
exporters. 
22. 
Although the two CAS indicators on business creation and closing costs did not register 
strong improvements Tunisia made laudable progress on the Do ing Business Indicators. Tunisia’s 
ranking in the Doing Business survey improved from 8 l S t in DB2008I9 to 73rd in DB2009 and 69‘h in 
DB2010 with major regulatory improvements in the area o f business creation and in the financial sector. 
Improvements have taken place regarding business transaction costs. The minimal capital requirement 
was eliminated in 2008 but it i s not evident that this was due to the Bank’s contribution. Activities 
initially planned in the area o f ICT were modified and did not include a component on reducing 
transaction costs and improving market access. The ECAL IV, as mentioned in Outcome 1.1 a, 
contributed to reduce the number o f administrative authorizations for private investment and the delays in 
granting the authorizations. 
23. 
Bank ESW, especially the Global Integration Study, played an important r o l e in shaping 
the Government’s trade and competitiveness program. This study made various recommendations to 
reduce the gap between preferential and MFN tariffs make the on shore sector more competitive and 
harness the potential in services sectors, which formed the basis o f the recently approved ICL operation. 
The review o f logistics services and infrastructure has prepared a strategy to develop efficient logistics 
infrastructure and services that also helped inform the content o f the IC L program. The SME finance 
policy note, currently being finalized, focuses on the demand for enterprise credit and i s aiming at 
identifying potential credit market failures and credit rationing for SMEs, and assessing the quality o f 
demand o f credit. Preliminary findings o f this study have provided inputs to the design o f the ICL . I n 
addition, technical assistance i s being provided on ta r i f f reforms to anticipate trade integration reforms to 
be supported under the ICL .

procedures o f the Commission Superieure des Marches (c f . part 111), but also to the magnitude o f reforms 
prescribed under these projects and the time needed for the Government to establish and enact new 
legislation. 

27. 
A l l indicators have been reached in the energy sector and some were even surpassed. 
Achievements in terms o f energy savings and the number o f energy services enterprises created have 
surpassed the targets. The value o f gross investment in ene rgy efficiency in the Tunisian industry may be 
higher than the $16 m i l l ion stated in Table 5 as this figure only reflects one part o f the Tunisian industry 
that i s dealt with under the Energy Efficiency project. The gross investment in energy efficiency in the 
Tunisian economy as a whole i s $110 million. The Solar Heating project also reached i t s goal o f 
encouraging the use o f renewable energy, establishing a competitive market o f suppliers in Tunisia and 
strengthening renewable energy institutions. Nevertheless, energy programs lack continuity and are 
heavily dependent on government f inanc ia l support and international grants. For instance, the solar water 
heater program slowed down when GEF support came to an end. This i s why the Government decided to 
revisit i t s energy management policy, for which the Bank i s currently providing support. 

28. 

Significant achievements have been made i n terms o f access to water and sanitation, and 
reduction of urban and coastal pollution. As stated in the IEG evaluation report o f the Grand Tunis 
Sewerage project, this operation has substantially improved the service levels o f urban sewerage. 
Appropriate new sewerage technologies have also been introduced and urban and coastal pollution has 
been significantly reduced. The connection to potable water ra te has greatly increased, in particular in 
rural areas, as shown in Table 5 . An additional project on Tunis sewerage started in 2006 in order to 
pursue the objectives o f the first project. Urban water supply issues are also being addressed through a 
Bank project that i s progressing slowly due to procurement delays. Finally, the Bank has provided the 
Government with guidance on a water and waste water strategy that was finalized in 2009. 

29. 
Mun ic ipa l infrastructure activities are producing mixed results, as the CAS indicators show. 
The Municipal Development I11 project, still ongoing, has produced good results in terms o f financing 
priority municipal investments but the institutional strengthening component i s making slower progress, 
although QAG has rated the achievement o f development objectives as moderately likely. In addition to 
the Municipal Development I11 project, the Bank i s providing technical assistance, via PPIAF, to the city 
o f Sfax to include private sector participation in the operation o f a new slaughterhouse. The Sustainable 
Municipal Solid Waste Management project, started in 2007, i s making progress, although delays 
occurred in starting up the institutional component o f the project. 

30. 
E f fo r ts were made towards privatization o f services, improved financial capacity o f public 
enterprises and opening o f ta r i f f regulations i n the transport and water sectors. The privatization 
processes have produced m ix results. In transport, the container terminal o f the port o f Rades has not yet 
been privatized but the concession o f the passenger terminal at the port o f L a Goulette has been awarded 
and that o f Enfidha deep sea port should come to fruition la ter i n 2009, while the construction o f the 
concessionned Enfidha airport i s ongoing. Furthermore, private bus operators are providing 4.6% o f urban 
transport services in the Tunis area under concessions with the Ministry o f Transport. Private sector 
objectives in the water sector have not been achieved because o f the Government's change o f view on the 
Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) scheme that would have allowed the Office Na t iona l de 
1 Yssainissement (ONAS) to outsource some o f i t s activities. Delays in concession processes are partly 
due to the lack o f capacity in Tunisia for private provision o f infrastructure. The Bank played a role in the 
preparation o f the recent concession law and should pursue this effort and help Tunisian counterparts 
develop regulations and tools to manage such complex procurement processes. 

3 1 . 
The Government has faced challenges w i th regard to reforms aimed at improving the 
financial capacity or reaching the financial autonomy of public enterprises such as the water utility 
ONAS and Socie'te' Na t iona le des Chemins de Fe r Tunisiens (SNCFT), and s t i l l subsidizes some 

5 8 

subsectors. Although the severance program for the SNCFT was fully implemented, i t s labor costs remain 
above the 2008 target and its financial situation i s still fragile, as well as that o f ONAS. Tariff 
restructuring objectives in the water sector and on the financing o f public service obligations in urban 
transport have not been reached either, partly due, in the water sector, to the changes in the Minister and 
ONAS’ CEO, which made tariff increase decisions more difficult to obtain. The financing strategy o f 
urban transport, recently completed, has identified sustainable financing mechanisms relying on non 
budgetary resources for this sector. 

32. 
The I C T sector has substantially developed. Three out o f four CAS indicators, as shown in 
table 5 , have been met and even surpassed the target, showing evidence o f improved access to ICTs. The 
ICT sector development project contributes to better delivery o f services also through the creation o f e- 
portals such as e-culture that has been recently completed. An achievement o f this project i s the design o f 
special software to enhance the learning performance o f disabled students (3,000 disabled students have 
been reached to date) and the equipment o f 24 Internet centers to allow disabled persons to access the 
Internet. Such an achievement i s considered as international best practice. However, delays in the 
implementation o f the process to award new fixed line and mobile licenses have prevented fwrther 
liberalization o f the sector during the CAS period. The Government has recently announced its intention 
to award new competitive licenses and the process i s expected to be completed by end 2009. 

3 3 . 
Progress in the area o f cultural tourism has been steady but slow. The ongoing Bank’s 
activity, the Cultural Heritage project, i s experiencing implementation delays and the other planned 
activity, the Tourism project, was dropped because o f change in government priorities. Tunisia was the 
first country where the Bank designed a free standing Cultural Heritage project. Although this project has 
significantly contributed to the renovation o f some cultural s i t e s and the improvement o f communication 
on the national heritage, the implementation o f major components i s slow, mainly because o f procurement 
delays and the institutional difficulties within the tw o institutions in charge o f cultural heritage 
preservation and management to adapt to techniques necessary to improve cultural heritage management 
and promote cultural tourism. One should mention that no progress on CAS indicators should be expected 
until the project closes since cultural visitors to the museums rehabilitated under the project w i l l be 
attracted only after the s i t e works are completed. A t the time o f the mid-term review, the project was 
reduced to four s i t e s rather than s ix . This decision was made to increase focus on a reduced number of 
emblematic sites for added impact and also to accommodate for higher costs than originally expected. 
However, as QAG underlined, the potential economic benefits may be underestimated from a “world s i t e ” 
o f the caliber o f the Bardo museum (which i s being renovated and expanded with the support o f the 
project). 

34 . 
Other Trust Fund activities are addressing the following issues: The Bank’s activity designed 
to provide Tunisia with support in decreasing the use o f Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) i s progressing 
well despite the slow implementation. Waste management issues are tackled through two activities that 
are aimed at installing a Gas Recovery and Flaring Project at the Djebel Chekir landfill and nine new 
landfi 11 s.

treated wastewater in non-agricultural sectors, so that water resources could be used sustainably. 
Furthermore, the study covering the cost assessment o f water degradation was able to build capacity on 
environmental valuation, which w i l l enable the Tunisians to replicate this type o f cost analysis in other 
sectors o f the economy. The Protected Areas Management project, which closed at the end o f 2008, 
developed capacity o f national parks’ staff, public awareness o f natural resources management, and 
improved biodiversity conservation in three distinct ecosystems o f Tunisia as demonstrated by the increase 
in the number o f selected species. 

37. 
The participatory approach developed by the Bank’s projects yielded good results in terms 
of community development and social impact. The Natural Resources Management I project was 
successful in promoting local integrated development and paved the way for participatory projects in 
Tunisia. The first Water Sector Investment project achieved considerable progress in terms o f community 
development. An estimated 80% o f irrigation schemes are currently managed by local water users 
associations, although female participation remains low. As noticed by IEG, however, these local 
associations have yet to achieve fu l l financial autonomy and are not able to fu l ly cover their operational and 
maintenance costs. The Northwest Mountainous and Forestry Areas Development project has achieved i t s 
objective o f assisting 180 ru ra l communities to formulate community development plans, which contributed 
to better policy and planning framework for local governments and increased participation by the 
beneficiaries. Continued support to these young institutions i s s t i l l required, however, in order to ensure 
their sustainability. Improvement o f irrigation schemes has also enabled beneficiaries to diversify and 
increase their revenues, contributing to labor generation and a reduction in rural migration. The Bank’s 
activities allowed the rural population to have better access to sa fe drinking water (cf. Table 5 ) . 

3 8 . 
Other planned activities have either been delivered, albeit later than planned, o r are under 
preparation. The Natural Resources Management I 1 project has been renamed the Community Based 
Integrated Rural Development Project and i s currently under preparation for delivery in F Y I 0 and the 
second phase o f the Water sector investment I 1 project was delivered in FY09. I n the case o f the Water 
Sector Investment 11, i t s delivery was delayed as the first project had to be extended in order to complete 
various project activities which took longer than planned given their innovative and cross-sectoral nature. 

39. 
The ECAL I V has been instrumental in the reduction o f the level o f non-performing loans 
(NPL) and the increase in the provisioning ratio. The CAS target was almost fulfilled reaching 17.3% in 
2008 and the provisioning and restructuring efforts o f the NPL portfolio have brought their level to 5 3 . 8 % 
in 2007 while the target was 5 5% for 2006. NPL levels are s t i l l high by international standards but similar 
to other Middle Income Countries. New targets have been se t up in the context o f the 1 lth Plan and are 
supported by the Integration and Competitiveness DPL (ICL): 15% o f NPLs and 70% o f provisioning by 
the end o f the ICL.

Overall, the banking sector has been institutionally strengthened. The 2006 Financial Sector 
Assessment Program (FSAP) Update provided the framework to allow the government to conduct a s e r i e s 
o f reforms intended to improve the credit culture, promote good governance, and strengthen the legal 
framework for banks. A 2006 legislation gives the Banque Centrale de Tunisie (BCT) new powers to 
monitor the financial system, ensure alignment w i th prudential norms and regulations, enforce transparency, 
and supervise publication o f financial and economic data. Thanks to the ECAL I V project, transparency and 
respect o f international accounting standards have greatly improved with the requirement for SMEs to 
publish certified financial statements. A working group has been set up to apply IFRS standards to 
consolidated accounts. The credit registry sponsored by the central bank has been modernized and i s now 
fu l ly operational. 

41. 
Two out o f three CAS monitoring indicators have met their targets and the th ird one shows 
progress. The number o f listed companies and mutual funds has increased and this trend i s continuing, in 
particular as a result o f f i s c a l incentives that have encouraged the opening o f capital and stock exchange 
listings. 

42. 
Significant progress was made with the support o f the E C A L I V i n the development o f 
contractual savings, especially in the insurance sector. As underlined in the IEG report o f the ECAL IV , 
the role o f the insurance supervisor was strengthened, restrictions on the participation o f foreign investors in 
insurance companies were reduced, and the flexibility o f companies to raise regulated insurance rates was 
granted. In addition, a new law was passed that increased the mandate o f the securities market regulator, 
and enhanced the transparency o f the market. Sales turnover o f l i f e insurance rose 44% from 2005 to mid- 
2007, while the capital o f insurance companies rose 28% during the same interval. The total number o f l i f e 
insurance contracts, however, has slowed down between 2005 and 2006 but this i s due to consolidation o f 
numerous small contracts and the value amounts o f the contracts have increased considerably from 
56.5MDTto 78.4MDT.

B. Pillar I 1 Outcomes: Enhance s k i l l s and employability of graduates and labor force in a 
knowledge economy 

43. 
This CAS pillar was relevant to the Government’s development agenda to reduce 
unemployment to 10 percent by 2016. Both the l o t h Development Plan (2002-2006) and the 1 lth plan 
(2007-201 1) aim at expanding the knowledge economy and investing in Tunisia’s human capital. 

O v e r a l l achievements under this p i l l a r are mode ra te ly sa t is fac tory . S i g n i f i c a n t progress has been made in 
t e r m s o f e f f i c i e n c y at a l l educa t iona l levels, while resu l ts have been modes t r e g a r d i n g the re levance o f the

44. 

The internal efficiency o f primary, secondary and higher education significantly improved. 

The EQIP I project was rated moderately satisfactory by IEG as there was progress made on achieving the 
development objectives. This operation did achieve results in terms o f quality o f primary education, mainly 
due to the generalization o f the competence-based approach. The completion rate came very close to 
meeting i t s target (89% instead o f 90%). The only area o f concern remains the dropout rate in the upper 
primary education, which kept increasing until 2006, partly because the number o f students increased and 
the curriculum changes were not introduced until 2006. I n higher education, the Higher Education Reform 
Support I 1 project contributed to introducing pedagogic reforms, teacher training, greater university 
autonomy, quality assurance plans and to expanding shorter-term professional programs, which in turn 
played an important role in improving overall quality. The follow-up Higher Education Reform Support I11 
project made good progress on the implementation o f the new law approved in February 2008 that includes 
the adoption o f Quality Assurance Standards for external evaluation o f institutions. 

45. 

Sustainability o f these achievements will depend upon better results in terms o f program 

evaluation and stakeholders' involvement. The above-mentioned activities have introduced changes in 
the areas o f student assessment, teacher evaluation, and pedagogic reforms but have not allowed for 
program evaluation, which would have ensured the sustainability o f the use o f the new approaches. Their 
outcomes would also have been greater had they developed a communication strategy towards parents, 
teachers and communities in order to reach a larger consensus in favor o f the reforms. Such issues are 
currently being dealt with by the ongoing operation EQIP 11. 

46. 

Some achievements have been made in terms o f relevance o f the education system and 

employability o f the labor force. The Higher Education Reform Project I11 was designed to deal with the 
issue o f relevance o f the education system and included piloting two-year programs with the business 
sector. The issues o f integration o f higher graduates to the labor market, skills mismatch and development 
o f vocational training programs were analyzed through the PESW Employment, which was delivered under 
a s e r i e s o f four TAs. This work fed into the design o f the Higher Education Reform 111 project. The 
capacity o f monitoring and evaluating the relevance o f education and employability has improved 
markedly. 

47. 

The PESW has contributed to a sustained dialogue with the Government on Employment 
issues covering a wide range o f topics. 
(See Box I on PESW Employment). 

The Government 
demonstrated strong commitment and co-delivered several o f the PESW outputs, and synergies were 
created with activities under CAS Pillar I (such as the SME study). The Bank's PESW outputs fed into the 
'national consultation on employment' that was ca r r ied out by the Tunisian Authorities in 2008. 

64 

Box 1: M a i n Achievements o f the P E SW Employment 

The PESW Employment i s an innovative Bank instrument designed to provide the Tunisian Government with a 
multi-year capacity building program in the area o f employment policy formulation and monitoring. This activity 
was delivered during the CAS period under a series o f four TAs, which have contributed to strengthening the skills 
and methodology o f the staff o f the Observatoire de I'Emploi e t des Qualifications (ONEQ). With the support o f the 
PESW, the ONEQ and the Ministry o f Employment have co-delivered high quality individual level tracer surveys on 
VET, Higher Education graduates and micro-credit ALMP graduates. I n particular, the ONEQ has developed 
capacity to deliver to very high standards, which i t could effectively share throughout the MENA region. 
Furthermore, the MILES report (the integration report o f the PESW, product o f the TA FY08) has received a warm 
reception by various Ministries and the Ministry o f Employment has called i t the 'new strategy for employment'. 

The Bank's PESW outputs fed into the 'national consultation on employment' that was carried out by the Tunisian 
Authorities in 2008. This consultation was aimed at developing concrete new employment policies, in various cross- 
institutional thematic stakeholder groups, involving a l l relevant Ministries as well as the Higher Education sector, 
Tunisian scientists from abroad, industry experts, the unions and research institutes. As a result o f this consultation, 
a decree reforming the ALMP portfolio was issued in February 2009. 

The in i t ia l steps for the planned project on vocational training have been conducted and have allowed for a sustained 
dialogue with the Government over employment issues . This dialogue has recently led the Government to express an 
interest i n the Bank taking a leading role for a national reform for employment, under a DPL operation planned for 
FY 10. As part o f the PESW, a tracer survey o f Vocational Training graduates was conducted, and the results w i l l be 
used as a baseline for the future professional development project (FY 10). As part o f the reforms to be supported, 
the Government i s initiating financing o f TVET reform, through piloting the use o f vouchers for 1000 trainees.

The CAS indicators under this component were highly ambitious and consequently were not 
achieved. The Higher Education Reform Support I1 project, which closed in 2004, was intended to support 
the implementation of cost-recovery reforms, the increase o f tuition fees, non-academic services and private 
sector participation in service delivery. None o f these materialized, and the non-salary expenditures even 
f e l l from 12% to 5% of total expenditures for higher education. As part o f the CAS goal on improved 
f inanc ia l sustainability, the restructuring o f scholarships and loans schemes made some progress but did not 
allow for major changes. Although the internal efficiency improvements impacted the financial 
sustainability o f higher education, i t i s not sufficient to ensure the long-term sustainability o f the system 
given the growing demand for higher education in Tunisia. 

49. 
The weak achievements under this outcome were mainly due to an over-reaching CAS 
objective that wasn’t grounded in the realities o f the reform environment. The overall implementation 
of financial reforms of higher education rested on measures that did not change the existing structure o f 
relying on state expenditures. The action o f the Government towards such reforms was influenced by their 
political sensitivity and the practice to guarantee free access to higher education. The Higher Education 
strategy, which was mainly designed to inform the design o f the third phase o f the Higher Education 
Reform Support project, did not manage to build a consensus with the Government on cost-recovery 
reforms. More attention to developing a communication strategy and building support for financing reforms 
amongst students and parents, who showed resistance to cost-recovery reforms and skepticism concerning 
public-private participation, could have strengthened the outcomes. But the setting o f this CAS goal was 
overly ambitious and not relevant to what was feasible at that time. 

50. 
Possibilities for future improvements exist. The private sector participation has gained in 
strength as a priority objective in the Government’s strategy. One has to acknowledge that reaching 
consensus over policy reforms takes time and that the results o f the Higher Education I1 operation that 
closed in 2004 may bear f r u i t s in the future. The follow-up operation, which started in 2006, supports the 
same objectives and i s making good progress on the implementation o f the new Higher Education Law that 
was approved on February, 25, 2008. This law promotes increased autonomy for Universities and provides 
opportunities to outsource student services. The Ministry o f Higher Education plans to introduce 
performance-based budgeting and sign contracts with universities to deliver their work programs.

The CAS indicator on private investment i n R&D shows clear progress and some progress i s 
noted on students graduating w ith scientific and technical qualifications. Steps have been taken 
towards better awareness o f the knowledge economy. The Bank organized with the Tunisian authorities, in 
November 2004, a national knowledge economy conference that included a wide audience from the private 
sector, and helped ra ise awareness. This activity allowed building capacity o f the IEQ, which was in turn 
able to contribute a summary document at a Maghreb Knowledge Economy Conference held in Tunis in 
early May 2005. Technical assistance has been provided to Tunisia in the preparation o f an annual report 
surveying knowledge economy developments and policies, the second edition o f which was published in 
May 2006 by IEQ. Yet, IEQ has produced no other annual report since 2006. The follow-up activity 
consisted mainly in facilitating the idea o f techno parks through a series o f conferences. Two techno parks 
are now operational and five others are under preparation. The government i s rehabilitating and expanding 
industrial zones in different regions and i s trying to integrate them with research institutes and laboratories.

Support I1 has been instrumental in the purchase o f 42 lots o f laboratory equipment, which benefited 
students and teachers o f several engineering schools, science faculties and Higher Institutes o f Technology 
(ISETs) throughout the country. The expansion o f short-term professional programs at ISETs, whose 
students are the most successful in finding employment, as well as the provision o f teacher training for 
ISETs have played a role. The Agricultural Support Services project also helped develop regional research 
centers and programs and produce agricultural s ta t is t ics . 

C . P i l la r 111: Improve the quality of social services through enhanced efficiency o f public 
expenditures 

53 . 
This p i l lar was aligned w ith the Government’s goal to uphold social achievements and 
ensure equitable growth where a l l social groups participate i n the benefits o f economic and social 
development. Tunisia has made good progress in terms o f f i s c a l mobilization and excellent progress in 
terms o f debt management by reducing the debt to GDP ratio to 47.5% in 2008 from 61% in 2003. Progress 
in the areas o f budget management and employment and social protection policies has been slower than 
expected which reflects the complex nature o f reforms in these areas and the need for a longer-term reform 
horizon (as witnessed in many other countries). 
L i t t l e progress has been achieved in the areas o f health 
and pension where the Bank’s program was limited in these areas.

54 . 

The CAS indicators show good progress. The reduction o f total public debt i s a result o f the 
government’s pro-active public debt management, which included using Tunisie Telecom privatization, 
proceeds to cover a substantial share o f the public debt. Notable progress was also made in reducing the 
wage b i l l even if the CAS indicator wasn’t met (again, possibly due to an overly ambitious CAS indicator). 
Furthermore, progress towards normalizing the tax system was achieved with the support o f the ECAL I V 
as V A T rates reimbursement mechanisms were c la r i f ied ( c f . Ou tcome 1.1). 

5 5 . 
One may question, however, the extent to which the Bank contributed to this progress as the 
PER was not conducted and the two Bank activities conducted under this outcome yielded poor 

results. The ICR o f the IDF grant for Public Debt Management rated i t unsatisfactory as activities were 
achieved under only two out o f the five components. The objectives, however, were partly achieved 
through other Bank instruments, including the Treasury’s Technical Assistance on Public Debt 
Management in 2004-2005. But this TA has been executed only partially due to implementation delays and 
limited coordination within the Bank, between this activity and the IDF grant, caused some confusion. The 
improvement o f budget management functions has also been supported through the PESW on Public 
Financial Management (c f . Ou tcome 3.2).

Important achievements were made under this component despite the complexity of the 

reform and the time needed to reach consensus. Achievements under this outcome were reached with 
the support of the PESW on Public Finance Management that was delivered under a se r ies o f four TAs. The 
first TA, conducted in 2005, had modest impact on policy reforms and was rated moderately satisfactory by 
QAG for this reason. The Bank pursued a step-by-step approach and dialogue with the government was 
maintained through a dissemination workshop on budget reforms in the Maghreb countries in 2006, and the 
delivery o f a methodological guide for program budgeting classification in 2007. The reform i s now on 
track and the government i s making good progress. Most o f the necessary institutional arrangements for the 
reform have been made and four pilot Ministries have restructured their budget by programs. The reform 
master plan which was delivered in 2008 has raised awareness amongst the Tunisian authorities with regard 
to the sequencing and the financial and technical implications o f the reform. This result has been reached 
thanks to a prudent and participatory approach where the master plan was developed i n close coordination 
with the Tunisian authorities. The global MTEF work has now begun, with financial support from the 
European Union, a partner with whom the Bank has been working s i n c e 2006. Furthermore, although no 
follow-up activity to the 2004 CFAA was conducted (as requested by the Tunisian Government), some o f 
the CFAA recommendations are included in this performance budgeting reform program.

Some steps have been taken in the hea l th sector. A new health insurance program was 

initiated in August 2004 which aimed to improve the social coverage and quality o f services, as well as 
manage be t ter the costs o f the system. Since 2007, this reform has been gradually implemented with 
important steps taken in the regulation o f private health providers and their coverage under the national 
health insurance program. These steps were taken by the Government and the Bank’s activities have been 
rather limited during the CAS period in this regard. The Health sector review, the first one to be conducted, 
was delivered at the beginning o f the period and indirectly helped the Government in formulating i t s 1 lth 
five-year health plan (2007-201 1). But i t was completed too late to inform the 2004 CAS and no further 
activity, including the health sector project, was conducted afterwards. A t the request o f the Tunisian 
authorities, however, a new technical assistance on assessment o f hospital performance has recently been 
delivered. 

58 . 

Dialogue over social protection and active labor market policies i s slowly producing some 

results. The se r ies o f four TAs delivered as part o f the PESW Employment (also see Outcome 2. I and Box 
I ) has significantly helped build capacity o f the Observatoire de 1’Emploi e t des Qualifications (ONEQ), 
whose team demonstrates high techn ica l s k i l l s that i t could effectively share throughout the MENA region. 
The PESW explicitly fed into the national consultation on employment that was carried out by the Tunisian 
Authorities in 2008 and a decree reforming the ALMP portfolio was issued in February 2009. N o dialogue 
has been pursued on the pension reform, because the Tunisian authorities have not confirmed their request 
for Bank support. The Government undertook i t s e l f to reform aspects o f the pension system starting in June 
2006. The Centre de Recherches e t d’ Etudes de Securite Sociale conducted a study on legislation and a 
consultative committee - chaired by the Minister o f Social Affairs and Solidarity - was put in charge to 
follow up on the study. 

There has been substantial capacity building in the area o f Mon itor ing and Evaluation. An 

59. 
impact evaluation workshop (Ap r i l 2008), requested by the Ministry o f Employment, has been delivered by 
the Bank and co-funded by UNDP. I t benefited about 100 participants from most central and line 
Ministries, including its agencies and the Central Bank. The Ministry o f Employment continues to build i t s 
capacity in this area, through Bank and other donor means, and to apply i t consistently. Furthermore, the 
Trust Fund on statistical capacity building, which closed in 2005, helped build capacity o f the National 
Statistical Office’s staff, for example on access to survey micro data.

111. Measuring Bank Performance 

A. Volume, lending instruments and scenarios 

60. 
The volume of lending was significantly lower than had been anticipated i n the CAS, which 
forecasted a base case program o f $200 to $300 million a year on average. The total volume o f loans 
delivered was $372 million over four years, averaging $93 million per year. 

61 . 
Ou t o f 1426 projects planned i n the CAS, only 5 were undertaken. But two additional projects 
were initiated, namely the Tunis West sewerage project and the Sustainable Municipal Waste Management 
project, illustrating the Bank’s flexibility in implementing the CAS. N o departure in instrument type 
occurred and five loans were approved as planned, with one Development Policy Loan (ECAL rV), one 
Technical Assistance Loan (ICT Sector Development) and 3 Sector Investment Loans. The two additional 
projects were also S I L s . Although suggested in the CAS, no SWAP was used during the CAS period. 

62. 
The gap between the planned lending program and what was delivered can be explained by 
several reasons: (i) the Government preferred t o access favorable external financing elsewhere and 
launched a highly successful $260 million yen Samurai bond in 2007. This meant that i t did not engage 
in a high level o f IBRD lending as originally expected; (ii) implementation delays led to extension o f 
projects which delayed the need to prepare follow-up projects, and (iii) Tunisia’s own calendar o f 
development strategy meant that the Bank program had to adapt to the timing o f projects planned therein. 
The extension o f the Water Sector Investment I and the Natural Resources Management I project meant that 
the second-phase o f these projects was delayed to FY09 and F Y 10 respectively. The extension of the EQIP 
I 1 project also did not allow for the repeater project to be undertaken during the CAS period. ECAL V 
(renamed Integration and Competitiveness Loan), initially planned for FY07, was postponed to FY09 in 
order to coincide with the country’s own development strategy and the execution o f the 1 lth Plan.. The 
Government did not confirm i t s interest in planned projects such as Tunis Urban Transport. For projects in 
Employment and Health sector, the Government has indicated it would like the Bank to deliver these in 
FY 10 to align better with the 1 1 th Plan. 

B. Portfolio quality 

63 . 
The IEG evaluation o f projects that exited the portfolio in FY00-08 shows that the quality o f the 
portfolio i s high and above the M E N A average in terms o f outcomes, sustainability and institutional 
development impact (Table 25). QAG evaluated quality at entry in five projects and concluded that four o f 
them were satisfactory and one was rated moderately satisfactory. No project was at risk and there were no 
problem projects during the CAS period (Table 26). The disbursement ratio was satisfactory during the 
CAS period although dropped in f i s c a l 2007 and 2008 (Table 26).

However, delays in implementation have led to slow disbursement and closing date 

extensions. Out o f 9 projects that were planned to close during the CAS period, only one closed on its 
original closing date (ECAL IV). Projects were extended from 12 to 3 6 months. These extensions put the 
average age o f the Tunisia portfolio above the M E N A and Bank-wide averages for FY05-08 (Table 27).

Implementation delays are mainly due to procurement issues. This i s why both the 2005 and 
2008 CPPR focused on procurement processes, and a continuous dialogue was conducted with the Tunisian 
Authorities throughout the CAS period. As part o f the 2008 CPPR, four workshops were organized in 2008 
and the first half of 2009, the f i r s t two exclusively with the Higher Tender Board (CSM) and the las t two 
with project implementation units in order to identify practical solutions that would help ensure timely 
implementation o f projects. Key reasons for delays and a se t o f recommendations have been identified as 

Implementation agencies lack knowledge of Bank’s procedures: Specialized training 
workshops are being organized in partnership with the CSM for s t a f f o f implementation 
agencies. Bank teams are also advised to include a Procurement Specialist (PS) in every 
supervision mission; 
Redundant Bank and CSMprocedures for p r io r control: These have been clarified during the 
CPPR workshops; however, the Tunisian counterparts apply additional national requirements. 
Although these requirements are not inconsistent with the Bank Guidelines, they add to the 
complexity of the procurement processes and delay the procurement execution; 
Lack of coordination between intra-ministerial departments for selection of consultants, the 
process of which is not we l l understood and implemented: Roles and responsibilities o f 
technical and procurement units have been clarified during the workshops and should be 
followed up by the PS within each project; 
Multiple implementation agencies in a project: Bank teams are requested to l im i t the number 
o f implementation agencies in a project to the extent possible; in case numerous agencies are 
involved, a coordinated capacity building program should be implemented; 
Lack of common standard bidding document: A standard bidding document has been 
prepared in FY09 under the second phase o f the Water Sector Investment project. Such 
documents should be used under a l l projects ; 
Lack of detailed and regularly updated procurement plans: Bank teams are requested to 
attach an updated procurement plan to each supervision Aide-Memoire. This w i l l allow for 
anticipating and reducing implementation delays; 

66 . 
A Technical Assistance on the Modernization o f Public Procurement (IDF) was also provided (this 
closed in March 2009). This was designed to modernize public sector procurement management and 
buildhrain human resources with the overall objective to improve the effectiveness o f public expenditure. 
.The Implementation Completion Memorandum for the IDF noted that some progress was made on 
improving the public procurement website and building capacity (including training o f trainers) but that l e s s 
progress had been made on strengthening the public procurement management information system. 

C . Results approach 

67. 

The results approach was integrated into the design and supervision o f activities, although 
further progress i s needed in the area o f Monitoring and Evaluation. Initiatives taken by the Bank towards 
the end o f the CAS period are offering good prospects for improvement in this area. For the first time, a 
specific monitoring and evaluation workshop was designed and conducted together with Tunisian 
counterparts as part o f the Sustainable Solid Waste Management project, setting the stage for similar 
activities in other projects. 

68 . 
A t the CAS level, further improvements i n the design of the results matr ix would be 
necessary. During the course o f this assessment o f the 2004 CAS, important weaknesses have been noted 
regarding the choice o f indicators and their ambitious nature, which may not have been the most appropriate 
in some cases. For instance, additional relevant data could have been useful to the assessment o f the 
outcomes 1 .1 and 1.4, the pillar I1 and the outcome 3.2. Da ta i s not available in some cases, in part hecause 
the indicator chosen i s hardly measurable (i.e. Outcome 2.3). Furthermore, some o f the indicators added at 

73 

the occasion o f the CAS Progress Report lacked baselines and targets and other indicators weren't added as 
planned. Finally, lack o f details i n the CAS document about the measurement method o f each indicator has 
proved to be a major constraint i n many cases. 

D. Safeguards 

69 . 
The Bank provided continuous technical assistance to the Government during the CAS period on 
environment and soc ia l safeguards. Tunisian counterparts generally show very good awareness and 
competences on these issues. Social safeguards are being respected and implemented with a participatory 
approach. As the existing Tunisian environmental regulatory framework i s relatively sophisticated, the 
Bank tested the " U s e o f Country Systems" approach for Environmental Safeguards in the Sustainable Solid 
Waste Management and Water Sector Investment projects, which proved successful. 

E. AAA program 

70. 
The AAA program i s o f high quality and responsive to the client's needs, as indicated by the 
country assessment conducted by QAG for activities delivered during the period FY02-FY06. The overall 
program was rated satisfactory, including the dimensions o f internal quality, coherence and integration, and 
Bank inputs and processes. QAG rated the program highly satisfactory in the area o f strategic relevance. 
The Government values the quality o f AAA and policy advice and i s highly committed to the definition o f 
tasks. The program i s mostly demand-driven and there i s generally c lose cooperation in carrying out the 
task, leading to important capacity building. 

71. 
The impact o f the AAA program i s important in the medium-term. The Government o f 
Tunisia sees AAA products through a long term lens, as they wish to r e f l e c t on whether and how some o f 
the recommendations might best be put into practice. They remain convinced that a gradual and steady 
approach i s superior and they have made commendable achievements. The Bank thus needs to be aware o f 
the importance o f the timing o f reforms analyzed by the AAA and not just the nature or scope o f the 
reforms. The QAG assessment o f the AAA program rated the likely impact as satisfactory. 

72. 
Dissemination o f AAA i s still limited. QAG rated the area o f participation, consultation and 
dissemination as moderately satisfactory. Indeed, the c lose collaboration and detailed discussions held 
between task teams and cooperating o f f ic ia l s did not extend beyond government circles. This i s why, as 
QAG noted, the client's commitment with AAA starts strong at the conception stage and diminishes 
progressively thereafter. After this review, the Bank and Government worked successfully together to 
strengthen dissemination o f key AAA reports in FY07 and FY08, broadening the audience to other 
stakeholders such as private sector, academia and c iv i l society. 

73 . 
As planned in the CAS, the Bank continued piloting the PESW approach, which has 
produced slow but significant results. Both PESW on Employment and Public Finance management have 
been instrumental in building capacity and consensus on a set o f major issues and have contributed to 
significant results at the end o f the CAS period (see Box 1 and Outcome 3.2). 

F. Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination 

74 . 
As intended in the CAS, the Bank has put a renewed emphasis on country dialogue, which 
was significantly strengthened during the CAS period particularly through strengthening o f the Tunis-based 
team. The QAG evaluation o f quality at entry o f four projects highlighted the good quality o f dialogue 
between the Tunisian Government and the Bank. The Country Office, although s t i l l small, has played a 
major role i n facilitating relationships with the client and the donor community. There i s recognition that 
the Bank's presence in Tunis has been instrumental in pursuing dialogue on Bank's ongoing activities with 

74 

Tunisian counterparts. I t has also been very helpful in coordinating aid with other donors, especially 
through very good and regular informal discussions. The Tunisian Authorities value the Bank’s support, 
especially for the knowledge component that the Bank contributes, and have often expressed their 
appreciation o f the on-the-ground partnership from the Tunis office. 

75. 

Substantial e f fo r ts were made in the area o f outreach and communication as compared to 
the previous CAS period. Conferences, such as the Maghreb Roundtable in 2005, workshops and 
consultations on Bank’s activities in the areas o f agriculture, investment climate, governance, trade and 
climate change have been organized during the CAS period, allowing for greater interaction with 
stakeholders in the country. For the first time, an agreement was reached for the Bank to contribute to a 
speakers program or conferences on development issues and knowledge within the National Library in 
Tunis. The Public Information Center has also been strengthened so that average monthly visits went from 
40 in 2007 to 1 18 in the first semester o f 2008. 

76. 
Cooperation with development partners has been close during the CAS period. Bank teams 
worked with bilateral donors (AFD and KFW) and multilateral institutions (A fDB and EU). This has 
materialized mainly through the co-financing o f several projects, as indicated in Table 28. Cooperation has 
been particularly close with A fDB as it houses the Bank’s office in Tunis. Informal dialogue was conducted 
with GTZ on environment issues. Collaboration also took place in the area o f outreach as, for the first time; 
a jo in t conference was organized in 2007 with the EU and the UN on access to development information. 
However, Government’s preference for bilateral relationships with each donor did not give the opportunity 
to develop jo in t analytical work and harmonize financing procedures as suggested in the CAS.

IV . Key considerations f o r next CPS 

77. 

I t i s important to align better the Bank’s wo rk program w ith Tunisia’s own calendar o f 
development strategy. The CAS CR has noted a significant gap between the planned lending program and 
what was delivered. One o f the reasons for this gap i s that some projects planned in the 2004 CAS had to be 
postponed in order to coincide with the execution o f Tunisia’s National Development Plan (2007-201 1). I t 
i s therefore important that the future CPS be designed w i th more flexibility and aligned both in substance 
and timing with the rolling National Development Plan. 

78 . 
The Bank needs to be more sensitive to the time-frame of reforms and not just the substance 
of reforms. The CAS CR has highlighted the slow but steady pace o f reforms’ implementation in Tunisia. 
Tunisia performed well in areas where i t was ready to deepen reforms and i t has performed le ss well in 
areas where i t determined that the political or economic context was not yet ripe for such bold measures. 
Greater time i s needed to build consensus within Tunisia and to ensure broad ownership. The challenge 
moving forward w i l l be for the Bank to work closely w i th the Government on supporting i t s reform agenda 
that takes into account the realities o f the political economy o f Tunisia but that also pushes forward on 
unblocking some o f the key constraints to growth, private sector development and employment creation. 

75 

79 . 
An important lesson learnt on results f o r the future i s to ensure a more reasonable and 
practical results framework that accounts for the flexibility o f the Bank’s approach. The CAS 
contained a highly ambitious and, in some cases, inappropriate results matrix which had overly detailed 
goals and indicators that were not aligned with the evolution o f the program. I t proved out-dated and overly 
rigid and often didn’t capture progress. Moreover, the results matrix aimed to show attribution for 
outcomes rather than contribution. As a relatively small player in Tunisia, any attempt to show attribution 
for outcomes i s naturally going to be difficult because the Bank has limited influence on the achievements 
o f broad social and economic objectives. 

80. 

Development Policy Loans @PL) should be encouraged. The Bank had envisaged developing 
the sectoral DPL type o f lending in Tunisia as it i s a very flexible instrument and i s particularly relevant to 
accompanying reforms, but there was not sufficient awareness among Tunisian counterparts o f the benefits 
o f this type o f instruments and not much lending taken on. The recen t successful experience o f delivering 
the Integration and Competitiveness DPL, however, has now built an understanding and appreciation for 
this instrument within Government, particularly when i t i s aligned with budget support from other donors 
such as the EU and AfDB. 

81. 

Employment creation w i l l have t o be a key area o f engagement in the next CPS. The CAS 
made specific reference to employment as being a key challenge in Tunisia and each CAS pillar was 
designed to tackle the employment issue from different angles (growth, education, services). However, 
there was no specific pillar or outcome focused on employment. Given that unemployment remains a key 
concern in Tunisia and that no progress was made over the CAS period in this area, the next CPS w i l l have 
to address this issue more directly, both on the supply and the demand sides. 

82. 

Fu r the r progress w i l l be needed in the area o f Mon itor ing and Evaluation, despite initiatives 
taken by the Bank towards the end o f the CAS period.

Regional Integration Issues in the Maghreb and M E N A 

Issues 

Current World Bank Program & Potential Future Activities 

Maghrebcountries i s very diverse. 
Algeria and Libya are important 
exporters o f hydrocarbons, 
Morocco i s almost entirely import- 
dependent, and Tunisia i s 
increasingly becoming more 
import-dependent . 

However, a l l these countries face 
common challenges: globalization 
o f energy markets, security o f 
supply, environmental protection 
and industrial competitiveness. 

The MENA region has amongst the 
world's best production conditions 
for solar power: abundant 
sunshine, low precipitation, and 
plenty o f unused f la t land c lose to 
road networks and transmission 
grids. 

MENA's consumption o f energy i s 
growing faster than that o f any 
other region in the world. In the 
Mediterranean Basin as a whole, 
demand for green electricity i s 
growing very rapidly. 

ENERGY 

The World Bank has launched an initiative to support 
deployment o f Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)'scale-up to 
fac i l i ta te both renewable energy development and energy market 
integration (see Appendix 5 ) . This would be at the scale o f 
about 1,000 M W over a 6 -8 year time frame, through around 8- 
10 commercial-scale power plants in Maghreb countries. This 
would be complemented by related transmission investments by 
adding highly concessional funds from the Clean Technology 
Fund (CTF) to other sources o f capital. About $750 million in 
CTF resources i s being sought as part o f the preparation o f a 
regional investment plan. This plan i s scheduled to be submitted 
before the end o f 2009. A workshop was held in Rabat in June 
2009 to initiate the preparation o f the investment plan and 
discuss projects fo r possible inclusion in the investment plan. 
The Maghreb countries presented projects amounting to 600- 
1000 M W o f CSP capacity by 20 1 5 . 

The MENA CSP scale-up has strong synergy with the 
Mediterranean Solar Plan (MSP) whose vision i s to take the 
world-scale solar potential o f the South, and the green electricity 
needs o f the entire Mediterranean Basin, and transform i t into a 
massive opportunity. This would be done by linking 20GW of 
power production from solar (as well as other renewable energy 
resources and suitable energy efficiency and demand side 
management options) through reinforced transmission grids to 
demand centers o f the Mediterranean region, both in the North 
and the South. 

Morocco and Tunisia are eligible countries under the CTF and 
have expressed interest in participating in the CSP scale-up 
initiative and in contributing to the preparation o f the CSP 
Regional Investment Plan 

In addition to the above work, the World Bank i s bringing 
international knowledge to in fo rm the thinking behind a possible 
creation o f a regional energy market by being an honest broker 
in helping cross-border coordination, bringing experience from 
other regions and catalytic financing, including for 
interconnection projects within the Maghreb and with 
neighboring regions. A request for Bank's assistance on an 
energy inter-connector project between Tunisia and Italy has 
already been received 

83 

In the Maghreb, current transport 
flows reflect the level o f regional 
integration which has the following 
dimensions: (i) very low within the 
region since the share o f intra- 
regional in total trade was only 2.7 
percent in 2007; ( i i ) well advanced 
with European countries which are 
the main economic partners and 
represent 80 percent o f trade; and 
(iii) limited to a few sectors with 
other African countries. 

A Bank survey on the Efficiency o f 
Logistics Infrastructure and 
Services to Promote Regional 
Trade showed the high burden o f 
logistics cos ts in the Maghreb and 
MENA, and the resulting hurdles 
to the development o f trade for 
countries where exports 
significantly contribute to 
economic activity. 

Shipping i s the main transport 
mode for trade between Maghreb 
countries and Europe and 
environment risks are a concern. 
Heavy traffic should continue to 
increase with the development o f 
exchanges and the motorways o f 
the seas supported by the Euromed 
transport plan. 

The continuity and capacity o f 
transport networks i s critical to the 
development o f freight transport 
and passenger traffic between 
Maghreb countries and with 
Europe. There i s a critical need to 
remove physical obstacles to cross 
border transit and f a c i l i t a t e the 
development o f quality transport 
services. 

There would be important benefits 
in harmonizing transport and safety 
regulations or standards on 
international transport routes. 
Currently country standards for 

TRANSPORT 

The Bank i s discussing with its regional partners potential 
activities in the transport sector which could strengthen the 
overall momentum and widen benefits expected from facilitated 
trade. The Bank’s current role i s that o f convener and facilitator, 
as well as knowledge partner although i t stands ready to provide 
financing as needed. 

The Bank’s work aims to complement the priorities o f the 
Regional Transport Action Plan for the Mediterran,ean Region 
(2007-20 13) prepared by the European Union under the 
Euromed initiative. This action plan i s being funded by the 
European Union, European Investment Bank, African 
Development Bank and other donors involved in transport 
operations in Maghreb countries. 

The Bank’s program i s looking at the following initiatives in the 
area o f logistics; ( i ) Audit o f logistics efficiency on intraregional 
trade to provide a regional action plan taking stock o f national 
initiatives and aiming to support improved trade facilitation 
between countries; ( i i ) Regional trade facilitation and logistics 
conferences for Maghreb countries which would allow for 
sharing experience in addressing impediments to efficient 
logistics and the facilitation o f trade as well as provide the 
opportunity to discuss and agree on j o i n t initiatives; and (iii) 
Study on logistics training programs to agree on quality 
standards and develop curricula for the training o f logistics 
specialists in each country. 

The Bank i s promoting the “Western Mediterranean Marine 
Highway Development and Coastal and Marine Contamination 
Prevention” project with a view to reduce the risk o f ship-based 
environmental contamination. 

A study could assess the current condition o f and gaps in the 
road, rail and port infrastructure within Maghreb and linking 
those countries to Europe, identify the capacity investments or 
rehabilitation works required to satisfy capacity and quality 
requirements, and suggest coordinated initiatives to promote 
cross border transport services. Based on the results o f the study, 
the Bank could participate in the promotion o f specific 
investment operations - infrastructure as well as logistics zones 
- and services development in coordination with other donors. 

As a first step to address this issue, a study could review current 
standards and recommend common references also consistent 
with European Union regulations. In order to help each country 
step up i t s efforts to address road safety issues through 
partnerships under a regional approach, the Bank could facilitate 
further road safety initiatives coordinated by the Arab Maghreb

F INANC IAL SECTOR 

A recent external study suggested 
huge gains from intra-regional 
integration o f non-bank financial 
markets. I t found that creating a 
larger Maghreb market through 
integration would lead to the 
consolidation o f firms at the 
regional level in the insurance 
market and stock market that 
would channel more funds to 
finance loca l businesses 

Financial integration in the 
Maghreb could generate larger 
efficiency gains i f i t i s part o f a 
broader integration agenda in the 
region, and a step towards further 
economic integration with other 
MENA countries and the EU. 

The Bank has joint programs with the Arab Monetary Fund 
(AMF) in the areas o f payments and settlements, credit 
reporting, and debt management systems. The Bank i s also 
working with the IMF which has been actively engaged with 
Maghreb countries in the area o f financial integration. The 
Monetary and Capital Markets Department o f the IMF provides 
technical assistance on payment systems, central bank 
operations, financial stability and banking supervision. The 
Bank intends to become more involved in this IMF initiative 
through collaboration on the design o f the reforms conducive to 
greater integration. 

The Bank i s aiming to contribute to the financial integration 
:ffort by maintaining an active policy dialogue and offering 
technical assistance in areas critical for harmonization: ( i ) 
payments and settlements, (ii) accounting and auditing, ( i i i ) 
:redit reporting; (iv) insolvency and creditor rights; (iv) 
:orporate governance o f listed companies, and (v) corporate 
governance o f private and state banks. TA on financial 
regulation and supervision could cover specific areas, such as 
:he adoption o f Base l 2, Solvency 2 fo r the insurance sector, 
:ffective arrangements for home-host country supervision, and 
jeposit insurance systems. Finally, the Bank could also provide 
TA on housing finance, as housing i s one o f the c r i t i c a l pre- 
:onditions for labor mobility within and across borders. 

PRIVATE SECTOR 

CVELOPMENT -TRADE AND INVESTMENT 

Regional integration at the private 
sector level involves both trade and 
investment dimensions. 

rhe Bank’s A A A work in this area looks at ( i ) integration 
hrough trade - imports and exports; and (ii) integration through 
nvestment - FDI. 

For the Maghreb countries, the EU, 
U.S. and China are more prominent 
trading Dartners than are other 

The recent MENA PSD Flagship report on private sector 
levelopment analyses why MENA countries have not been 
p icke r to embrace integration through investment. I t highlights 

85 

how patterns o f privilege have created barriers to entry and 
investment, sustained by a political economy that, in many 
countries, has resisted rapid reform. I t concluded that breaking 
down these barriers opens channels to greater regional and 
international integration through productive investment and the 
mobility o f capital, goods and workers. The Bank’s dialogue 
and AAA program in the MENA countries i s informed by this 
regional analysis. 

Recent work by the Bank suggests that the payoffs to further 
liberalization in services are higher for services than in 
manufacturing. The AAA programs o f Bank countries are using 
this work - and other studies - to inform the dimensions o f 
reform programs. 

MENA countries. The share o f 
intra-regional in total trade was 
only 2.7 percent in 2007, whereas 
trade with European countries 
represented 80 percent. Among 
MENA countries, only Saudi 
Arabia figures among the top 6 
trade partners o f Maghreb 
countries for imports, and no 
countries in the region provide a 
leading destination fo r exports. 

There i s huge potential for further 
progress by lowering remaining 
ta r i f f and non-tariff trade barriers. 
Non-tariff trade barriers pose a 
much bigger constraint to regional 
integration than any deficiencies o f 
infrastructure. 

EMPLOYABILITY 

Access to adequate employment 
opportunities, in particular for 
qualified youth, i s a key challenge 
in the Maghreb and other countries 
in MENA. The world average 
unemployment rate fo r the 
population aged 18-25, i s 1 1 
percent while the average for 
MENA i s 25 percent. 

I n particular, job creation has not 
been sufficient to accommodate the 
growth in the labor force, including 
an increasing number o f women 
and youth. 

I n the regional labor market, the 
low capacity o f MENA countries 
to create quality jobs domestically 
diminishes their capacity to attract 
migrant workers, and the lack o f 
skills o f their workforce leave them 
at a disadvantage compared to 
skilled workers from East and 
South Asia. 

In most countries, programs to 
address youth unemployment have 
been unsatisfactory. I n addition, 
soc ia l security systems (including 

The Bank’s program in the Maghreb countries encompasses 
different elements o f the following four key issues: 
(1) Skills development - Improving the quality and relevance o f 
post basic education to give better job opportunities fo r young 
people, through the development o f a regional qualifications 
system. 

(2) Building the capacity o f management and provision o f 
Quality Assurance (QA) in Higher Education in the MENA 
countries, to enable them to participate in the mutual recognition 
o f International Qualifications and Standards. The 
Mediterranean Integration Program w i l l help the Tertiary 
Education Institutions and the Quality Assurance Agencies in 
the MENA region to reach the European QA standards. 
(3) Activating labor markets. - Building the capacity (including 
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f results) 
for effective labor market intermediation institutions to improve 
matching o f demand and supply for existing skills; better 
employer-focused skills enhancement; facilitating the transition 
between education and employment; creating opportunities for 
young people to develop entrepreneurial skills and income 
generating activities, supported by twinning arrangements 
between relevant and interested public sector institutions in the 
EuroMed area. 

(4) Improving soc ia l protection and labor management for 
migrants - In partnership with the European training Foundation 
(ETF) and IOM, facilitating legal and safe intermediation o f

pension, unemployment and health 
insurance) are rarely designed to 
support mobility and labor market 
flexibility while providing 
adequate income protection for 
workers. As a result, employability 
has risen to the forefront in the 
agenda o f countries i n the region. 

Migration to Europe - legal and 
illegal - still often presents the 
only opportunity for young people 
although i s becoming increasingly 
difficult as the EU implements 
stricter border controls and fewer 
work permits. 

Maghreb countries share similar 
ecosystems, have comparable 
agricultural systems, and similar 
patterns o f urban development. 
They have similar profiles o f 
vulnerability to climate change and 
much to l e a r n from each other on 
how to integrate climate change i n 
their development process. 

The economic prosperity o f the 
Maghreb region w i l l depend 
crucially upon adequate 
management o f strategic sectors 
such as agriculture (a key user o f 
water resources) and development 
o f coastal zones which i s where 
most o f the region’s most vibrant 
economic activities cluster and 
which are critical for the tourism 
sector. These sectors are already 
exposed to a highly variable 
climate, and they are likely to 
become more vulnerable in the 
future as a result o f climate change. 

Experts concur in projecting a 
warmer and drier climate, as well 
as more frequent extreme events, 
such as floods and storm surges. 
Recent s c i e n t i f i c literature suggest 
that a rise in sea levels might 
materialize at a faster rate than 

labor demand and supply across the Mediterranean. Advancing 
the policy dialogue on bilateral social protection coverage and 
soc ia l security portability for labor migrants in MENA-EU 
countries. 

CLIMATE CHANGE 

Development o f a regional policy framework on climate change 
and agriculture, through a study addressing the following 
questions: a) How w i l l the region’s food security prospects be 
affected by climate change; b) W i l l climate change a l ter the 
ability o f the Maghreb’s high-value agriculture to compete for 
potentially lucrative export markets, particularly in the EU. The 
framework could then lead to the following activities: 

Pilot program for testing natural resource management 
options that can reduce carbon emissions from agriculture, 
combat desertification, and increase the resilience o f local 
communities to climate change 

Establishment o f a capacity strengthening program (possibly 
in partnership with Meteo France or with the Hadley Center 
in the UK ) to enhance the countries’ ability to model future 
climate change 

Regional study to evaluate the impacts o f climate change on 
fisheries 

Development o f practical decision tools to integrate climate 
change i n the programming o f water investments (possibly 
in partnership with the Arab water academy) 

Regional study on human mobility (scaling up a study which 
i s currently underway) 

Regional initiative on empowering community based 
adaptation and disaster risk management 

Pilot program to support, in partnership with the 

87 

previously anticipated, with severe 
:onsequences fo r the high value 
assets located in the region’s 
:oastal areas. 

Groundwater over-use i s 
widespread in the Maghreb, and 
with the drying-up o f surface 
water, i s likely to become an even 
more acute problem. 

A l l countries have i n common that 
they are almost fully reliant on 
fossil fuels to meet their energy 
needs and therefore are relatively 
carbon intensive. 

They also share a vast and largely 
untapped endowment o f renewable 
energy sources. In particular, 
Maghreb countries have the 
world’s best production conditions 
for solar power: abundant 
sunshine, low precipitation, and 
plenty o f unused flat land close to 
road networks and transmission 
grids. 

Transport i s a priority sector in 
MENA for C 0 2 emission 
reduction as i t i s the most energy 
intensive in the world2’. I t i s a 
major and fast growing contributor 
to GHG emissions in Maghreb 
countries. 

Marseille center, the development o f urban adaptation plans in 
selected Maghreb c i t i e s (plans would address implications o f 
climate change in terms o f locations, urban densities, urban 
mobility systems, integration o f residential and productive 
functions, and energy use) 

The main proposal for cross-border cooperation in the area o f 
renewable energy i s to further develop the MENA CSP scale-up 
initiative (mentioned above in energy section). 

The Maghreb countries are at different stages o f development in 
their energy efficiency programs and could benefit from sharing 
experience and drawing lessons from countries in the region and 
elsewhere that have several years o f implementation experience. 
For instance Tunisia has been conducting industrial audits and 
offering capital subsidies for energy efficiency investments since 
the late 1980s, and the approach could be adopted by other 
countries. The UM A (Union for Arab Maghreb - i n French, 
Union pour l e Maghreb Arabe) organization has set-up several 
committees to improve cross-country cooperation and one o f 
them i s focusing on energy efficiency programs in industry and 
buildings. Another possible area o f cooperation i s in 
harmonization o f technical norms and standards to facilitate 
trade and the setting up o f common equipment manufacturing 
facilities. 

In the area o f transport, the following activities are proposed: ( i ) 
a study to draw the lessons o f past experiences and assess how 
different transport and vehicle production policies in similar 
contexts have disparately affected GHG emissions; (ii) a pilot 
program in partnership with the Marseille cen ter to take stock of 
current transport initiatives, share knowledge, and jointly 
mobilize international expertise; and ( i i i ) development of 
methodologies to incorporate climate change impacts in 
transport infrastructure planning and use, and to retrofit existing 
facilities.

RESPONSE TO THE CR IS IS 

The Bank aims to triple IBRD lending for the 
FY09-11 period with a concentration on fast- 
disbursing DPLs. 
The VFF, INFRA and IFC-led private sector 
platform are the main programs. 

The Bank already increased the amount o f the FY09 
DPL (for Integration and Competitiveness) to $250 
million in response to the Government’s request for 
increased support from development partners to 
manage the impacts o f the crisis.

M E N A Region 
Concentrated Solar Power Scale-up Program 

Introduction 

1. 

The MENA region has amongst the world's best production conditions for solar power: 
abundant sunshine, low precipitation, and plenty o f unused flat land close to road networks and 
transmission grids (see figure 1). MENA 's consumption o f energy i s growing faster than that o f any 
other region in the world and, in the Mediterranean Bas in as a whole, demand for "green" electricity i s 
growing very rapidly.

2. 

In the MENA region, there i s an increasing interest in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) with 
projects under implementation in Morocco, Egypt and Algeria. The main objective o f this program i s 
to support gigawatt sca le CSP deployment in the MENA region to accelerate the global market 
adoption o f this solar technology - by realizing major cost reductions, through the economies o f sca le 
implicit in such a large-scale plan. CSP i s a relatively simple technology, but i s currently high cost 
because o f small production runs - large-scale demand could change that dramatically. The 
Mediterranean region could therefore be the crad le o f a technological leap forward in the battle against 
climate change. 

3 . 

Demand for electricity in the Southern Mediterranean i s growing rapidly, driven by 
urbanization and rising incomes. Southern Mediterranean countries broadly share the same goals as 
their northern neighbors fo r green electricity - energy security considerations and local environmental 
needs predominate, but climate change mitigation i s a rapidly emerging issue in the South. 

91 

4. 
In this context, the MENA CSP scale-up has strong synergy with the Mediterranean Solar Plan 
(MSP) whose vision2* i s to take the world-scale solar potential o f the South, and the green electricity 
needs of the entire Mediterranean Basin, and transform i t into a massive opportunity - by linking 
20GW o f power production from solar (as well other renewable energy resources and suitable energy 
efficiency and demand side management options) through reinforced transmission grids to demand 
centers o f the Mediterranean region, both in the North and the 
This would provide an 
opportunity to satisfy regional demands for green electricity, and an opportunity to promote regional 
integration and energy security in the Mediterranean and beyond. The success o f the MSP depends on 
the development o f an operational framework for sharing o f the costs and benefits between partners. 
To the extent that such a framework i s agreeable to the parties, MDBs could play a key role in 
financing. 

Rationale f o r C T F Financing 

5 . 

The Clean Technology Fund (CTF) presents a great opportunity to promote near-commercial 
low-carbon technologies like concentrating solar power (CSP). In order to fund project investments, 
CTF could be accessed to provide highly concessionary funding3’. From a global perspective, i t i s 
critical that the best solar resources are utilized fo r solar scale-up and the MENA region o f fe rs this 
opportunity. Scaling-up o f CSP can provide a catalyst fo r an increase in manufacturing in the MENA 
region. For the current plants under implementation, roughly 30% o f the hardware i s locally 
manufactured. 
If there i s an assured demand fo r large capacity additions in the GW scale, 
manufacturing o f precision components like the receiver tubes and mirrors may a lso become viable in 
the region. To sum up, the scaling-up o f CSP can spur loca l production and create new jobs, which in 
turn w i l l increase tax revenues for governments in the MENA region. “Green jobs” w i l l be important 
-economically and politically - for the success o f a MENA CSP Scale-up. 

Financing P lan 

6 . 
The World Bank Group w i l l work with the African Development Bank, Arab and Islamic 
Funds, European Investment Bank, AFD, KfW, and other donors to develop a regional investment 
program for significantly scaling up CSP through the CTF and other public and private sector 
financing. A regional CTF investment plan in the range o f US$ 750 million i s being prepared to 
leverage total concessionary funding i n the range o f US$ 6 -g3 ’ billion to achieve a GW order scale-up. 
Other concessionary sources o f financing might include the EU neighborhood funds, bilateral grants as 
well as f i s c a l incentives offered by National governments. The level o f the scale-up w i l l obviously be 
linked to the availability o f concessional f inance from various sources as well as CDM and green 
electricity sa les revenues. The concessionary financing w i l l leverage commercial financing in the 
range o f about US$ 15 billion. 

*’ The European council approved in principle the Un ion for Mediterranean (UfM) i n 2008, presided over concurrently by 
France and Egypt. Proposed regional initiatives under the UfM to enhance regional cooperation include de-pollution o f the 
Mediterranean, maritime and land highways, c iv i l protection, Mediterranean solar plan (MSP), higher education and research 
and the Mediterranean business development initiative. 
29 Demand-side management energy efficiency measures may also be needed to facilitate the gr id integration o f solar power. 
The CTF t e rm s for public sector investments are 40 yr maturity, I O yr grace, 0 .25% service charge and 0.10% M D B fee . 
The private sector terms are yet to be finalized. 
3 ’ This i s a preliminary estimate based on an approximate 30% capital cost subsidy requirement for 5 GW additions based on 
an average o f US$ 3000-40OO/kW. These w i l l be revisited during the preparation o f the investment plan.

Donor Programs in Tunisia 

Overview 

1 . 

In the context of a strongly-owned and country-led program, the Government in 
Tunisia has a deep understanding o f the comparative advantage o f the main donors based on an 
assessment o f the technical quality o f their work and the terms o f their f inanc ia l support. The main 
donors in Tunisia are the European Union, European Investment Bank, African Development Bank 
(AfDB), Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), Japan (JICA), German Cooperation (GTZ), 
Islamic Development Bank, UN Agencies and the World Bank. 

2 . 

The Ministry o f Development and International Cooperation has the responsibility for 
coordinating the programs o f donors and represents the main Government counterpart for donors. 
While Tunisia i s a signatory to the Paris Declaration on the Harmonization o f Aid, i t did not 
participate in the 2008 Survey. 

3 . 
The EU, A fDB and the World Bank have deepened their collaboration i n the past couple of 
years, most notably around the jo in t budget support which i s being provided to Tunisia’s Integration 
and Competitiveness Program. This positive experience has solidified the partnership among these 
three donors and serves as a model o f donor cooperation in support o f the Paris Declaration. 

4. 
The Bank consulted particularly closely with the A fDB in the preparation o f the CPS as the 
A fDB was conducting the mid-term review o f its country strategy for 2007-201 1. The AfDB’s 
strategy has three pillars; (i) strengthening o f macro-economic policy and acceleration o f structural 
reforms; (ii) modernization o f infrastructure and strengthening o f productive sector; and ( i i i ) 
consolidation o f human capital. The program encompasses support to infrastructure, higher education, 
health, PSD, employment and the integration agenda. 

5 . 

The EU i s an important development partner fo r Tunisia because o f the overall context o f the 
EU Neighborhood Policy and Tunisia’s strong political, economic, soc ia l and cultural ties with 
Europe. The World Bank and the EU have a c lose collaboration on performance-based budgeting, 
PEFA, and employment and are deepening this further in the education, water and agriculture sectors. 
Areas o f focus for the EU program include: reform and modernization o f the judicial system, private 
sector development, support to the EU Neighborhood Partnership Agreement and regional agreements, 
industrial modernization, natural resource and water management, 
improvement o f youth 
employability, higher education and health. The EIB’s investments are focused mainly in (i) 
infrastructure fo r energy, industry, transport, water supply, and solid waste, and ( i i ) support to SMEs. 

6 . 
The World Bank, A fDB and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD ) are collaborating 
well in sectors such as water, energy, agriculture, municipal development and cultural heritage 
management. The strategy for AFD i s designed around three areas o f concentration : (i) strengthening 
o f the competitiveness o f enterprises including support to financial restructuring o f firms, development 
o f hotels, and the national program for professional upgrading ; (ii) improving l iv ing conditions o f the 
population with a focus on urban development, rural development and support to the water sector; and 
( i i i ) stronger management o f natural resources. 

93 

7. 

I F C has also been actively collaborating with other IFIs and w i l l pursue more opportunities 
moving forward, especially for large projects. For instance, IFC helped bring i n the AfDB, Proparco 
and the European Investment Bank as co-financiers for the Enfidha Airport project. 

8 . 

Japanese Development Agency (JICA): Areas o f concentration o f JICA’s program include 
e l e c t r i c i t y , water, infrastructure and environment through techn ica l cooperation and f inanc ia l support. 

9 . 
Islamic Development Bank (IsDB): The support from IsDB i s targeted in the areas o f 
agriculture, management o f natural resources and the environment 

10. UN Agencies (UNDPAJNFPAAJNICEFAJNEP): The main focus areas o f the UN agencies 
are: (i) the health and education sector, particularly as regards achieving the MDGs; (ii) support in 
strengthening national capacity on employment issues; (iii) gender issues, including fight against 
gender-based violence; and (iv) youth, employment, and migration issues.

CPS Consultations Report & Communications Outreach 

During the course o f its engagement in Tunisia, the World Bank has maintained a good dialogue with the 
Government and with different development partners including parliament, private sector, academia, c iv i l 
society organizations and loca l representatives. In the preparation o f the CPS, consultations were carried 
out in different fora, orchestrated both around the CPS itself as well as around other elements o f the 
Bank’s work in Tunisia (analytical reports, projects, conferences, etc). The goal o f these consultations 
was to understand better the priorities, challenges and obstacles to development and to ascer ta in where the 
World Bank has brought value added and where its engagement could be strengthened. These 
consultations were also an opportunity to disseminate key analytical reports and lessons learned from the 
World Bank’s program in Tunisia. 

Consultations with Government 

The elaboration o f the CPS has been very much a consultative and continuous process with Government 
through a series o f discussions at different levels. These consultations were carried out mainly with the 
Ministry o f Development and International Cooperation (MDCI) which coordinates the Bank’s program 
in Tunisia, although discussions were held with other Ministries where the Bank has activities. The CPS 
discussions were launched in November 2008 with a large meeting between most o f the World Bank’s 
Tunisia Country Team and the principal interlocutors and representatives o f different Government 
Ministries and agencies. Thereafter, the Bank’s team followed up through a ser ies o f meetings with the 
MDC I and other Ministries to understand more clearly how they viewed the World Bank’s engagement, 
what were the lessons l e a r n t from the past, and where they were seeking the Bank’s partnership in the 
future. 

These consultations concluded that the Government has a c lear vision o f where and indeed how i t wants 
the Bank to engage. Moreover, the Government and the Bank kept an open mind about discussing other 
issues on which the Bank was in more o f an advocacy mode - such as regards regional integration. This 
level o f frank and open dialogue has nurtured the CPS and the sectoral content o f our engagement, 
particularly in areas such as employment, education and agriculture. 

Perhaps most notable from the experience o f preparing the CPS i s the important strengthening o f the 
relationship between the Bank and the Government. The Government actively contributed to the CPS 
beyond consultations through reviewing ea r l ie r drafts o f the document and providing useful insights, 
comments and inputs. This was carried out with good candor and underscored the marked improvement 
in the quality o f the communication and partnership between the Bank and the Government. 

Preparation of Other CPS Consultations 

The Bank’s CPS team prepared specific CPS consultations during the month o f June 2009 with a set o f 
development partners and stakeholders. This process was started first with an identification o f the sites 
where the consultations could take place and the target audiences that needed to be reached. The idea was 
to create events o f respectable but congregated size to allow a productive discussion and debate. 

The Bank team targeted specific partners and stakeholders through a careful review o f the main c iv i l 
society organizations, private sector representatives, professional organizations, unions and academics. I t 
was decided to hold consultations in Tunis and in the town o f B e j a in the north west o f the country, the 
latter because i t i s located in one o f the poorest areas o f Tunisia and i s a region where the Bank has had a 

97 

long-term engagement through the North West Development project. The Bank has developed strong 
partnerships with local stakeholders and beneficiaries in this region and thus i t was felt that participants to 
the Beja consultations would be already informed about the World Bank’s work and thus their insights 
and points o f view would be particularly valuable. Invitations to the consultations in Beja were extended 
to loca l representatives, CSO, women’s groups, farmers groups and NGOs. Three se ts o f consultations 
were held in Tunis with invitations extended to (i) private sector; (ii) CSOs including academia, unions, 
NGOs and representatives o f associations; and ( i i i ) Parliament. The participants from the Parliament 
were proposed by the Government with due consideration for broad representation among different 
political parties. 

Approximately 67 invitations to the consultations were sent out with a note on the CPS process which 
provided information on the nature and goal o f the consultations. At the meetings themselves, 
information packages were prepared and made available on site according to the target audience. 
Regarding the attendance, there was strong representation at the consultation in Beja with many loca l 
CSOs attending the meeting, as well as a good representation at the Parliamentarians consultation where 7 
members o f Parliament attended. However, there was weak representation at the private sector and CSO 
consultations in Tunis despite the Bank’s efforts to invite a broad spectrum o f people. 

Different channels and means of communication shared with participants included:

country data (http://go.worldbank.org/BTYHHQIRIO). 
Invitations for participants, including a framework note (“note de cadrage”) explaining what a 
CPS i s along with the purpose o f the consultations. 
Information packages with a set o f brochures (such as an updated one-pager o f the WB Tunisia 
Project Por t fo l io , 10 Things to Know about the World Bank, the WB Public Information Center 
resources) as well as more targeted materials according to the group (whether public, private or 
CSO) or region where the CPS event was taking place (i.e project PIDs, related sector analysis 
and studies). 
A Press release o f the activities including the World Bank’s website and email contact 
information fo r feedback. 

Consultation with local CSOs (Beja) 

The first phase o f the Consultation process was initiated with a round table involving local stakeholders 
from the agriculture and environment sectors in the town o f Beja in the north-west o f the country. During 
this consultation session, the discussions evolved essentially around the problems o f the farmers’ 
organizations (“Groupements de Developpement Agricole” or “GDA”) financial sustainability and the 
difficulties in accessing micro-credits. This issue was a particularly important one fo r those who had 
received training by the GDA and were not able to start new production or business lines due to lack o f 
financing. The Bank Group was asked to step up i t s work on micro-finance in the region either through 
the North West Development Project (currently funded by the Bank), the IFC’s support to ENDA, the 
main micro-finance organization in Tunisia, or through some other means. Improving the lives o f rural 
women was cited as an important issue, particularly as regards universal water accessibility/coverage and 
improved hygiene. Participants also cited the persistent problem o f brain drain towards urban centers and 
the need for the region’s development to be accelerated so that loca l graduates and young people can 
return to work there. 

98 

Consultation with Private Sector (Tunis) 

This consultation took place in Tunis and involved managers and heads o f enterprises from the private 
sector. Their main concern related to labor market problems, in particular in the industrial sector in terms 
o f personnel training and competence. Participants also addressed the issues related to the 
implementation o f administrative decisions (the case o f the cumbersome and lengthy reimbursement o f 
V A T paid by exporters) and stressed the difference in approach between imports which are very 
restrictive and exports which are highly favored. The financial sector i s still perceived as being 
insufficiently adapted to the needs o f businesses in terms o f financing and administrative procedures. 
Transport was identified by participants as an obstacle to the development o f their business. They also 
suggested that the effort to enhance employment should be broadened to focus on the industrial and 
services sector, including trade. They noted that more efforts must be made in professional training to 
enable their businesses to address the deficit in adapted profiles. Supporting R&D and facilitating 
exchange with Sub-Saharan Africa constituted other themes o f discussion. 

Consultation with Parliamentarians (Tunis) 

The second Tunis session was a lunch debate with 7 members o f the Chamber o f Counselors and the 
Chamber o f Deputies. The discussion centered on the government’s national priorities such as education, 
employment, developing the private sector, agriculture and health. The consultations confirmed that the 
Bank’s proposed CPS program i s focused on national priorities and has tFe support o f stakeholders across 
Government branches. The slow process with procurement was also discussed to ascertain ways o f 
reducing the lengthy public procurement procedures (both for World Bank projects and for the 
Government’s own investments). 

Consultation with CSOs (Tunis) 

This session was with CSOs who were representative and active i n different domains including social 
services, loca l development, rural development and women’s rights. There was a consensus between the 
various participants on priority activities for the country’s sustainable development. The representatives 
emphasized the gap between the theory and practice with regard to the state’s approach to engaging with 
CSOs which was perceived as needing greater communication on a local, regional and national level. 
They also raised the problem o f transparency and access to information and the absence o f a soc ia l 
dialogue on good governance. The c iv i l society stakeholders’felt that i t was necessary to assess the 
impacts o f projects through regular consultations and to have an evaluation each time there i s a change 
from one strategy to another and from one policy to another. 

Sectoral Consultations 

Other consultations on elements o f the Bank’s program in Tunisia were held in different fora between 
November 2008 and June 2009 according to important development themes. 

Consultations on Energy efficiency 

On November 25‘h and 26‘h 2008, the World Bank organized consultations in Tunis on energy efficiency 
with decision makers and various partners from different countries o f the MENA region. The workshop 
mobilized about 
forty participants, national and 
loca l decision makers, stakeholders and 
expertshesearchers in charge o f economic, financial, planning and energy issues o f the MENA countries 
in the presence o f some donor representatives and international institutions. 

99 

The Tunis consultation workshop focused on policies and strategies linked to energy efficiency through 
(i) pricing and social protection; ( i i ) institutions linked to energy efficiency; (iii) financing mechanisms; 
and ( iv ) the lessons learnt as well as the challenges inherent in implementation. 

The workshop enhanced the sharing o f experiences linked to energy efficiency between countries o f the 
MENA region, by getting comments from the countries on the results o f the study before i t s finalization, 
by making i t possible to have an exchange o f views on priority actions in terms o f energy efficiency, and 
by discussing the potential role o f the donors including that o f the World Bank. 

The consultation was a successful exchange among MENA countries on their experiences o f 
implementing energy efficiency strategies and energy pricing reforms. The World Bank study provided a 
platform for this exchange o f views in the form o f a knowledge base and a conceptual framework. 
Tunisia, which i s the most experienced and advanced MENA country in terms o f national energy 
efficiency strategy implementation, was able to showcase its approach. 

International Conference on Climate Change, Hammamet, Tunisia 

The World Bank was invited to participate substantially with a financial contribution and key note 
speakers in the “Cinquieme Colloque International sur I’Energie, l e s Changements climatiques et l e 
Developpement durable”, organized in Hammamet from June 1 5 to 1 7th, 2009 . This event was attended 
by a broad spectrum o f participants from universities, environmental agencies, private sector and NGOs 
and provided an excellent opportunity to put forth important elements o f the World Bank’s climate 
change work and to highlight priority measures needed in this area. 

Consultations on the Private Sector Development Flagship report ('%ram Privilege to Competition: 
Unlocking Private-Led Growth in the M idd le East and Africa’? 

The consultations organized in Tunis from December 1 Oth to 12‘h, 2008, put forward the main messages o f 
the regional report o f the World Bank that deals with the development o f the private sector in the Middle 
East and North Africa region. This report analyzes its different aspects, namely the role o f the State and 
its institutions to ensure a greater impact o f the current reforms in investments in the region. The aim of 
this presentation was to appraise t h e viewpoints o f the different stakeholders on these issues in Tunisia. 

A first event, in the morning o f December 1 1 th 2008, involved key stakeholders from the government and 
the private sector, and was co-hosted by the Government. The presentation focused on the gap between 
reforms as they’re designed and the way they’re implemented. This gap i s prevalent across the region and 
explains why the impact o f past reforms on private investment in the region has been muted compared to 
other regions. The presentation triggered an interesting debate and discussion and found large consensus 
among the participants around the main points o f the report. 

The discussion focused on how this diagnosis relates to the Tunisia situation, and focused more 
specifically on the need to increase the extent o f involvement o f the private sector in Tunisia in the policy 
debates with government on the design and prioritization o f reforms, as well as the evaluation o f progress. 
Participants from the government, the private sector and academia acknowledged that a lo t o f reforms 
have taken place in Tunisia, but that the implication o f the private sector to these reforms could have been 
stronger to accelerate the needed structural transformation o f the economy. This diagnosis i s in line with 
the report’s messages and some participants commended the report for highlighting what they viewed as a 
key issue in Tunisia. 

100 

Increased partnership between the State and the private sector in identifying what firms really need and 
assessing how effective i s the implementation o f reforms has been identified in the discussion as an 
important agenda for Tunisia. Recent initiatives in that direction between the customs administration and 
the private sector w i l l be strengthened and expanded through the support o f the Bank’s Export 
Development projects. 

A second, smaller event on the afternoon o f December 1 lth was organized by the Tunis World Bank 
office with selected private sector representatives. This allowed for a freer discussion on the above 
mentioned critical issues for Tunisia and confirmed again the main thrust o f the report. 

Youth Consultations 

The World Bank, in collaboration with the Ministry o f Youth and Sports, jo in t ly hosted a consultative 
workshop on 29th April, 2009, on the Bank’s MENA region report on “Youth - an under-estimated asset: 
towards a new agenda for the Middle East and North Africa - the progress, challenges and way ahead”. 
This report was particularly pertinent for Tunisia in the context o f its new national youth strategy that 
covers 2009-2014 and that envisages supporting the insertion o f 400,000 young Tunisians into the 
workplace. 

The workshop’s aim was to present the main recommendations o f the report and establish a discussion 
platform with the different Ministries on their activities and their action plans within the framework o f the 
national youth strategy. Amongst other issues, the report analyzes (i) the context in the Middle East and 
North Africa region; ( i i ) the transition phases o f youth including education, employment, migration 
movements, health, and starting a family; and (iii) recommendations for multi-sectoral policies in favor of 
youth. 

About 50 participants attended the workshop, including youth action groups, students and many high 
level representatives from different Ministries (Ministry o f Development and International Cooperation, 
Ministry o f Public Health, Ministry o f Culture and Heritage Protection, Ministry o f Employment and 
Professional Youth Insertion, Ministry o f Education and Training, Ministry o f Social Affairs, Solidarity 
and Tunisian abroad, Ministry o f Higher Education). Representatives from international organizations 
were also present including the United Nations, UNICEF, and the African Development Bank. 

In response to demand expressed by the Ministries, the World Bank discussed possible follow-up 
activities with the Ministry o f Youth and Sports to: ( i ) discuss potential collaboration on activities which 
are being organized for the 2010 Year o f International Youth; (ii) explore the opportunities o f focusing on 
the impact o f Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) given the large number o f programs the different 
Ministries have. For example, the WB could provide M&E for the National Strategy o f Youth, which 
presents an opportunity to integrate M&E from the beginning o f the process; and ( i i i ) hold bilateral 
meetings with different ministries to explore the proposed follow-up and other potential demand. 

A second small informal workshop was hosted by the World Bank on Ap r i l 30th with young people and 
youth organizations at the World Bank’s Public Information Center at the University o f Tunis E l Manar. 
The objective o f the workshop was to disseminate the report and get feedback on challenges, 
opp0,rtunities and solutions for youth in the region today. The aim o f the discussion was to listen to youth 
and youth groups to get an idea o f their thoughts on these topics. During this session, the youth and youth 
groups prepared write-ups on the challenges, opportunities and solutions for youth. They used this as a 
basis for discussions for 6 break-out groups. Each group reported back their views on these topics and 
generated ideas to feed into the Bank‘s dialogue with the Government on the Youth agenda (Summary 
available).

Global Integration Report Presentation and Dissemination at the University 

A presentation on the Bank’s report on “Tun is ia ’s g loba l in tegra t ion : a new generation of reforms to 
boost g row th and employment” was held at the University o f Tunis El Manar on May Sth 2 0 0 9 . About 80 
participants from academia and different donor agencies such as the AfDB, the AFD and the UN attended 
this event. This occasion allowed a platform fo r discussion and debate, triggering strong interest among 
the participants as the topic i s considered very pertinent to the local and global context. 

The study covers mainly the following points: i t assesses past integration policies by describing the 
policies implemented and evaluates their impact on foreign direct investments, exports and employment; 
i t examines the present challenges o f the integration o f Tunisia a f te r the creation o f the free trade area 
with Europe for industrial products in January 2008; and i t also proposes specific reforms which are 
necessary in order to draw on the vast potential o f the services sector. 

Following the presentation, the participants held a lively debate on Tunisia’s integration, expressing their 
concerns in certain sectors as well as their points o f view for the future. The World Bank’s Tunis o f f i c e 
received positive feedback and numerous requests for more information and a larger dissemination o f the 
report given the widespread interest in the study. 

Water report dissemination with media and web users’ reactions 

I n June 2009 , the World Bank team working in the water sector organized with local and governmental 
counterparts a dissemination event for the report “RBflexion stratkgique sur 
I’eau potable et 
I’assainissement en Tunisie”. This event provided an opportunity to present the main findings o f the 
report as well as to give an evaluation o f the sector with the suggested next steps to be followed. 

The event was picked up by journalists and a r t ic les were posted on different loca l websites. One o f the 
articles written had negative connotations and misinterpretations regarding the report’s recommendations. 
Immediately the Bank’s team took action and produced a clarifying note with regard to the 
misunderstandings entailed by the article. The Bank team also followed up on the reactions o f the 
different readers to the a r t ic le . A number o f readers - those who either had attended the dissemination 
event or who showed interest in the water sector in Tunisia - freely expressed their thoughts mentioning 
that the report’s messages were o f a different nature and were not negative. Some even went a l l the way 
by saying that the journalist did not seem to have understood the report at a l l . This event could be 
considered as a new consultation means. The reaction in the form o f blogs presents a new and different 
communication channel for the Bank’s consultation work in Tunisia as i t i s a spontaneous reaction on 
behalf o f web users who show interest in WB analysis and studies.

2 . 

The CPS consultations reaffirmed the importance o f reaching out and listening to different 
audiences. Stake-holders expressed great interest in interacting more with the Bank to debate 
development issues and have greater access to Bank reports (global, regional and national). 

Two key elements facilitate mainstreaming o f communications into World Bank activities to 
support reforms: f i r s t , decision makers are increasingly convinced o f the need to open up the 
dialogue on reforms to socioeconomic actors, and second, the World Bank i s increasingly 
recognized as a trusted partner and a strong reform proponent.

Through focusing on promoting dialogue, building awareness and understanding o f the reform 
process, World Bank communication activities w i l l fac i l i ta te consensus-building for reform 
and contribute to feeding the public debate in view o f generating more proactive responses 
and leveraging local ideas and inputs. The Country Office w i l l continue to expand i t s 
outreach and communication to strengthen partnerships in the implementation o f the new 
CPS. 

Consultations around the CPS w i l l continue in order to interact with those met during the CPS 
process and share the Bank’s strategy with a broader audience to promote a better 
understanding o f issues, challenges and reform trade-offs and to contribute to leveraging 
ideas and local input from non-traditional World Bank partners. In addition, Bank teams 
working on lending and analytical work w i l l be encouraged to identify mechanisms early on 
fo r engaging with c iv i l society and strengthening participatory processes. Some o f the Bank’s 
outreach efforts can be conducted jointly with development partners such as the European 
Commission Delegation, the United Nations and the African Development Bank in Tunis. 
These institutions are also stepping up their outreach e f f o r t s and have expressed willingness 
to co-organize events with the Bank as was successfully done in the past.

World Bank Export Promotion in Tunisia 

Overview 

1. 

The Bank has a long-term engagement in Tunisia in support o f export development through the 
Export Development Projects (EDP), o f which the second phase i s coming to a close and the third phase 
i s under preparation. The objectives o f the EDPs are to create a conducive export environment and 
encourage trade in Tunisia, with a focus on supporting SMEs. The successful experience o f the EDPs in 
Tunisia reflects to a large extent the country’s commitment to trade liberalization and the request for 
continued engagement o f the World Bank in this area. Tunisia has been committed to trade liberalization 
s ince the 1970s through various programs including through an export promotion program for Textile and 
Clothing exporters in the early 1970s, and the signature o f the first Association Agreement with the EU in 
the mid 1980s. Tunisia’s trade policy has rested on three pillars: (i) promoting exports, through generous 
incentives to attract FD I in the offshore sector, incentives to exporting firms, and trade agreements; ( i i ) a 
decisive move toward a market economy started in 1986, and a large number o f structural reforms that 
were introduced gradually including: liberalizing tariffs and prices, privatizing state enterprises, reducing 
entry barriers to economic sectors and pre-authorizations, and enacting a new competition law; and (iii) 
more recently, trade facilitation. 

2 . 

I n addition, Tunisia has complemented these export promotion efforts with an industrial 
upgrading (“mise a niveau”) program put in place in 1996, and largely supported by the EU. The program 
aimed to enhance the organizational, technological, and marketing capabilities o f f i r m s being gradually 
exposed to competition vis-a-vis the EU. This EU supported program also implemented in Morocco, 
Senegal and Madagascar, has been particularly successful in Tunisia. I n 2004, the Government launched 
a more ambitious program - Programme de Modernisation Industrielle (industrial modernization program 
or PMI), designed in cooperation with the EU, and aimed at providing technical assistance to support firm 
creation, innovation and quality enhancement. 

3 . 
Trade facilitation has received much emphasis since 2000, when the government adopted a 
comprehensive approach to the issue, with the objective to improve trade facilitation through streamlined 
technical controls, improved customs procedures, and increased access to information on standards and 
technical regulations to ra ise transparency and meet international trade obligations. 

Assessment o f the Export Development Projects 

4. 
The Bank’s project experience and IEG reports have assessed the EDP projects in Tunisia as 
successful with notable achievements. These assessments concluded that the successful experience o f 
EDPs in Tunisia reflects the design o f appropriate programs that support the country’s export 
development. Amongst other achievements, the export structure o f firms that benefited from the export 
development program i s much more diversified ( in products and markets) than other exporting firms. The 
success hinges mainly on the sustained commitment from Government and the World Bank’s 
responsiveness and flexibility in the design o f customized programs. Also, the lessons learned are being 
disseminated across similar projects in the Bank. For example, FAMEX, the World Bank pilot matching 
grant fo r export promotion that i s financed under the EDPs, was successful in Tunisia in terms o f export 
revenues, employment, and demand from the private sector. The program has quickly surpassed i t s 
performance target o f supporting 500 individual firms. Similar programs have subsequently been 
implemented in Ethiopia and Cambodia.

The Second Export Development Project (EDP II) 

5 . 
The development objectives o f EDP I1 which i s currently underway are: i) to improve access to 
export markets and finance, and ii) enhance the efficiency and performance o f trade clearance processes 
(customs operations and technical controls). 

The project’s main components are:

Second Export Market Access Fund (EMAF 11); 
Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantees (PEFG) Facility; 
WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Enquiry Point ; 
Trade Logistics - Enhanced integration o f technical control procedures and strengthened risk 
management protocols; 
Trade Logistics - Streamlining and Strengthening o f Customs Procedures. 

Component 1: The Second Export Ma rke t Access Fund ( EMA F II) 

6 . 
A major component o f the EDP I 1 i s EMAF I 1 (USD 22.5 million) which helps Tunisian firms 
(mostly SMEs) boost growth, employment and income through new export initiatives and the 
diversification o f markets and products. EMAF I1 i s a matching grant program that provides non- 
reimbursable co-financing o f 50 percent for individual firms and 70 percent fo r professional associations 
on a demand-driven basis to help implement investments in market research and pre-competitive 
programs that increase export market access and competitiveness;

898 firms (project target 1000) have finalized or are implementing their export plans under the 
program; 

30 percent o f these firms are new exporters and 49 percent o f these plans target new export 
markets for Tunisia; 

The f i r s t 460 exports plans which are completed generated an additional USD 171 million o f 
exports revenues. I t i s expected that additional exports generated by firms under the scheme w i l l 
reach USD 300 million by the end o f the project; 

About 28 percent o f these firms are in services and about 50 percent o f the beneficiaries are 
SMEs o f less than 100 employees (small firms o f le ss than 50 employees account for 3 5 percent 
o f a l l beneficiaries). 

Component 2: Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantees (PEFG) Facility 

8 . 
This component aims at further encouraging financial institutions to provide pre-shipment 
working capital financing to emerging exporters with viable export contracts. Eligible sub-loans financed 
are guaranteed for up to 90 percent o f the outstanding principal amount, which represents non- 
performance risks o f SMEs and emerging exporters which the participating financial institutions must 
bear for up to 180 days.

processing, and service activities that are unable to access pre-shipment export finance from commercial 
banks. 

10. 
From November 2006 to February 2009, 187 applications (mostly from SMEs) were processed. 
The amount o f credit guaranteed reached $16 .1 m i l l ion and the related value o f exports was $45.4 
million. 
Component 3: W T O Technical Barriers to Trade - Enquiry Point 
1 1 . 
This component aims to strengthen the capability o f the Standards and Intellectual Property 
Institute (INORPI) for collection, analysis and dissemination o f standards information. Specifically, this 
sub-component includes i) the Procurement o f computerized systems to strengthen WTO Enquiry Point 
(including the creation o f a new digital database o f Tunisia technical control regulations), ii) the training 
o f INORPI and Ministry s t a f f in best practice management o f information on standards and technical 
control regulations to meet WTO obligations in the TBT Agreement32, and iii) technical assistance for 
dissemination (web-based information dissemination on standards, through the new INORPI website). 

12. 

The main outcomes o f this component are the following: 

Notification to WTO o f new Tunisian technical regulations now takes 2 months (project target) 
instead o f 4-6 months before the project; 

0 

The access time to WTO notifications on export technical controls i s now down to 2 months 
(project target) instead o f 5 -12 months before the project; 

0 

Tunisian standards have been digitalized and are now available on-line. The new website of 
INNORPI i s operational since April 2009 and modeled after the website o f the Canadian Council 
o f Norms (which i s a worldwide reference in this area). 
Component 4: Trade Logistics - Enhanced integration o f technical control procedures and 
strengthened risk management protocols 

1 3 . 
This sub-component finances the application o f e-government to technical control procedures and 
processing to complement the e-government mechanisms developed under the EDP I. The objective i s to 
improve the efficiency, speed and transparency o f technical control procedures, thereby further reducing 
import clearance times. This component includes i) the automation o f workflow and decision making 
processes o f technical control agencies33, ii) the implementation o f an integrated risk management system 
at the level o f each o f the technical control agencies34 and iii) the implementation o f a technical control 
digital database. 

3 2 - The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) was negotiated during the Uruguay Round o f the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force w i th the establishment o f the WTO at the beginning o f 1995. The TBT 
exists to ensure that regulations, standards, testing, and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. The 
agreement prohibits technical requirements created in order to l im i t trade, as opposed to technical requirements created for 
legitimate purposes such as consumer or environmental protection

The main outcomes o f this component are the following: 

Reduced time for technical inspection services authorizations (AMC/APE). On average, since l a t e 
2007, i t takes 9.84 hours to provide these authorizations against several days before the project 
(project target, delay between 0 and 2 days); 

About 7 0 percent o f a l l the authorizations are now processed through the new digital system. 
Component 5. T rade Logistics - Streamlining and Strengthening o f Customs Procedures 
1 5 . 
This component streamlines customs clearance procedures in order to reduce border clearance 
delays while at the same time strengthening control processes. I t includes a technical assistance for the 
implementation o f risk analysis, management and selectivity techniques to customs control and 
administration; in parallel, techniques are also introduced within Tunisian Customs for deferred control 
and post event audit35. Furthermore, the management information system o f the customs i s being 
improved by adding database definitions for collection o f data within SINDA (Tunisia Customs 
Information System) which w i l l enable regular analysis o f customs operations effectiveness, productivity 
measures, fraud cases, detection rate, and other management indicators. Finally, the technology

(against 0 before the project); 

The overall duration o f stay in ports for containers (which includes loading/unloading, customs 
clearance) has been significantly reduced from 9.2 days in 2006 to 5 .6 days in 2008. 

j S These procedures act as a safety net for facilitation by providing a range o f control mechanisms (documentary, physical, and accounts

Appendix 9 

SME F INANCE IN TUN IS IA 

Overa l l background 

1. 
As discussed in this CPS, Tunisia’s National Development Plan has a main goal to transform the 
economy to bring about sustained job creation. This w i l l necessitate strengthening the development o f the 
private sector, particularly industry (manufacturing) and services. 
I n order for these sectors to grow 
sufficiently, it i s necessary fo r the private sector companies to be adequately financed. 

2 . 

The Tunisian government has long been aware o f the need to support companies in their search 
for financing. Over the last decade, the government has strengthened legal and regulatory frameworks in 
this area, created public financing systems, facilitated the development o f financial markets and helped to 
expand the supply o f financial products; especially those geared at SMEs. 

3 . 
SMEs play a vital role in Tunisia because 98 percent o f Tunisian firms (across a l l sectors) f a l l 
into this category. The main consequence o f the prevalence o f SMEs in Tunisia’s economic landscape i s 
that all development strategies are de facto based on the performance o f this category o f companies. 
SMEs’ ability to obtain financing fo r their business operations and investments i s therefore crucial to 
Tunisia’s future economic development. 

SME f inanc ing in Tunisia: despite a favorable environment, private sector f inanc ing has reached a 
plateau” 

4. 
SME access to financing i s a product o f both demand and supply constraints. Companies are 
deprived o f financial services either because o f constraints that exist at their level (demand side factors) or 
because the formal financial system as a whole i s not able to accommodate their needs (supply side 
factors). Supply side factors, i .e . making financial products and services available at a reasonable cost, 
depend not only on macroeconomic and microeconomic factors, but also on government initiatives. 

5 . 

Data available in Tunisia underscore a kind o f paradox. Tunisian SMEs have operated in the last 
few years within a constantly improving macroeconomic framework and business environment. Most 
financing tools are available (bank finance, factoring and leasing, stock market, venture capital, etc.) and 
the Tunisian government has put in place several dedicated support mechanisms (e.g. BFPME a bank 
specifically dedicated to SME finance and SOTUGAR for guarantees). However, despite this fairly 
favorable environment that generates viable financing opportunities, private sector funding (as a 
percentage o f GDP) has leveled o f f in the las t decade. I n effect: 
e Recent growth in outstanding credit i s mainly a result o f the increase in consumer credit. Though the 
lion’s share o f outstanding credit (almost 80 percent) went to productive sectors between 2005 and 
2007, outstanding consumer credit nevertheless increased more sharply than business credit. 
Outstanding consumer loans thus rose by an average o f 21 percent38 between 2005 and 2007, while 
loans to the productive sector only climbed by an average o f 6 percent (Chart 1) 

” A more detailed analysis o f these issues i s provided i n a forthcoming WBG po l icy note wh ich w i l l be delivered to the 
Government before the end o f 2009 . 
’* Consumer credit i s made up mostly o f short-term credit and real estate loans - 1.e. 40 and 56 percent o f outstanding credit in 2007 and 2008 
respectively. 

108 

0 Most o f the credit to the productive sectors goes to the services sector ( 5 6 percent) then to industry 
(roughly 3 8 percent, Chart 2). Within services, the main recipients are trade, hotels and restaurants; in 
industry, the main beneficiaries are the agro-industry and construction sector (Chart 3 and 4 ) ; 
0 Most o f the credit to productive sectors goes to private companies (about 96 percent in industry and 
services in 2007); 
0 Most o f the credit to the productive sectors i s short-term (about 65 percent in industry and 50 .5 percent 
in services in 2007, Chart 5); 
Even though credit to the private sector i s on average higher in Tunisia than i t i s in the Middle East 
and North Africa region as a whole, i t remains much lower than in the OECD advanced economies. I t 
has remained stable, at roughly 64-66 percent o f GDP s ince the mid- 1990s , despite the implementation 
by the Tunisian government o f various mechanisms aimed at promoting financing o f this sector (Chart 
6 ) .

I n short, recent growth i n outstanding credit i s mostly due to an increase in consumer credit. SME 
financing remains limited and largely short-term. This ra ises questions about the real efficiency o f the 
policies implemented, whether regulations or support mechanisms. 

Enterprises' perception: signijicant and persistent problems of access to f inanc ing that stem from 
banks' stringent requirements 

7 . 
Available data from 2006 and 2008 firm surveys show that Tunisian companies consider access 
to and cost o f bank financing to be two o f the greatest barriers to their growth. 29.7 percent o f firms, 
irrespective o f sector, considered access to bank financing to be a "major" obstacle to their growth, while 
49 .9 percent o f firms saw the cost o f bank financing in the same light. This perception i s even more 
negative for small enterprises. I t i s therefore hardly surprising to observe that self-financing, mainly 
reinvested profits, i s the main source o f funding for Tunisian companies. 

8 . 
The banking system's contribution remains moderate. Depending on the sector, bank credit 
provides for between 1 1 and 24 percent o f long-term asset financing compared with 48 to 52 percent from 
retained earnings. Financing provided by SICARs (venture capital in the Tunisian context) and other non- 
banking financial institutions play a minor role, irrespective o f sector. To some extent, the relatively 
limited use o f bank financing by Tunisian SMEs reflects the negative perceptions referred to above. 

9 . 
The available data indicate that Tunisian SMEs consider banks' collateral requirements to be the 
chief obstacle blocking access to bank credit (on average, the banks require collateral worth up to 167 
percent o f the loan granted). Though they are mentioned le ss often, administrative procedures and 
documents to be submitted are also obstacles. Conversely, according to the firms, SICARs' and leasing 
companies' small share in the financing o f Tunisian companies appears to stem partly from the 
companies' inadequate grasp o f these financing tools. Low recourse to financial markets i s also mainly 
due to companies' lack o f knowledge and to the perception that this type o f financing i s the preserve o f 
large companies. 

110 

 
10. 
These data underscore the perception that the financing problems faced by Tunisian companies 
and SMEs are considered as structural. They also indicate that firms do not appear to expect to see an 
improvement in the short term. 

The supply offinancial products and services 

1 1 . 
The main types o f financing available to SMEs in Tunisia are: i) bank financing that can help 
SMEs in the operational phase (working capital requirements, investment), ii) factoring and leasing that 
help to fund operations (and, in the case o f leasing, sometimes constitute an alternative to investment), iii) 
the stock market, which provides medium and long-term financing and iv) venture capital, which aims 
more specifically at companies in the start-up phase. 

The banking system and bank lending 

12. 
The Tunisian banking system has undergone profound changes in the last decade: the creation o f 
SOTUGAR in 2003, and that o f BFPME, which works exclusively with SMEs, in 2005, the change in 
status o f development banks to universal banks, and the privatization o f Banque du Sud. Despite the 
recent improvements, the sector still has certain structural characteristics that l im i t bank lending to SMEs: 
For a relatively narrow market such as Tunisia’s, the number o f credit institutions appears to be large 
(20 entities), credit supply i s therefore highly fragmented. In this context, i t appears to be difficult for 
Tunisian banks to create new products or try to tap into new risky markets such as the SME market, 
fo r they would be unable to achieve the necessary economies o f sca le or absorb the initial losses; 
In spite o f the significant improvements recorded in recent years, Tunisian banks are still burdened by 
the level o f non-performing loans on their balance sheets3’. In this context that i s not conducive to risk 
taking, there i s some concern that Tunisian banks w i l l continue to remain on the sidelines o f SME 
financing for a while longer, or even turn from i t altogether in the current climate o f economic 
recession and resurgent corporate default risk; 
Tunisian banks also appear to be ill-equipped to adequately capture SME risk. This i s a result o f i ) 
factors specific to SMEs (opaque finances, excessively high debt ratios, low quality o f demand and 
projects, difficulty o f obtaining collateral), ii) characteristics specific to banks (limited loan technology 
- little use o f credit scoring, lack o f information on SMEs, inexperience in certain areas and lack o f 
sufficiently qualified personnel in this segment) and iii) the external environment (difficulties o f 
registering collateral, absence o f sector information and studies). 

1 3 . 
In recent years, the Tunisian government has taken two very important measures aimed at 
facilitating SME financing by offsetting banks’ reluctance to lend to this sector: the creation o f BFPME 
and SOTUGAR. Even though banks see these mechanisms as a step forward, they are still somewhat 
reluctant to use them and invoke reasons relating to cost and time delays (SOTUGAR) or to the 
duplication o f procedures and contractual details (BFPME). 

Leasing 

14. 
The leasing business i s relatively new to Tunisia, i t was introduced in 1984. There are currently 
10 leasing companies in operation. The three largest companies account for almost 60 percent o f the 
market. Leasing has increased significantly in Tunisian SMEs in recent years as a source o f funding for 
fixed asset investment. Leasing penetration in gross fixed capital formation reached 1 1.4 percent in 2007. 

3 9 - These non-performing loans decreased from 24 percent o f to ta l credits in 2003 to 17 percent in 2008 while loan- 

loss provisioning increased from 43.1 percent to 53 .8 percent over the same period 

111 

Even though i t i s making steady strides, the sector still faces constraints such as i) the absence o f a 
secured transaction registry, ii) the difficulty o f obtaining financing for specialized equipment, which 
makes leasing less attractive to industrial SMEs and i i i ) the persistently high financing cost o f financial 
leasing. 

Factoring 

1 5 . 
Factoring i s a useful financing tool that accelerates SMEs’ cash flow and enables them to meet 
their working capital requirements. Factoring i s a technique whereby, under the terms o f a contract, a 
specialized credit institution takes responsibility for collecting a company’s debts while opting to bear any 
losses incurred as a result o f debtor insolvency. The factoring sector i s expanding and continuing to 
contribute to financing the Tunisian economy and to managing account receivables. The volume o f 
invoices purchased amounted to a total o f m D 408.7 m i l l ion at end 2007. 83.9 percent o f this derived 
from domestic business. The factoring business involved 464 s e l l e r s and 22,852 factors in 2007. The 
sector nevertheless faces several challenges such as i) contract enforcement difficulties, ii) difficulty in 
obtaining information on companies’ credit histories and payment records, and iii) the absence o f a 
specific legal framework. 

The Stock Market 

0 

16. 
I n December 2007, an alternative market (Marche‘ alternatij) was launched to fac i l i ta te SME 
access to financing. The hope was that this newly-created market would help to diversify financing 
sources (and therefore reduce the cost o f capital) and be a vector for the transformation o f SMEs, which 
are often family companies. Requirements for SMEs’ entry into the alternative market have been adapted 
in accordance with international best practices; they are l e s s stringent than the conditions imposed on 
larger companies listed on the primary stock market. This market remains l i t t l e developed because i t faces 
a number o f 
Institutional constraints: the small s ize o f the primary stock market (in 2006, as measured by market 
capitalization, i t was 14.7 percent o f GDP, i .e . six times smaller than the markets in Egypt or 
Morocco) i s not an attractive example, low liquidity on the primary market increases the risk o f low 
liquidity on 
the secondary market, 
the 
level o f investor protection could be 
improved, 
disclosure/reporting o f financial information need to be improved and there are s t i l l obstacles to 
foreign investor participation; 
Demand constraints: lack o f information odawareness o f the f a c t that the alternative market could be 
a source o f long-term financing for SMEs, strong reluctance to disclose the information required for 
market flotation and the perception that there i s a high cost to enter this market, which acts as a strong 
deterrent to potential candidates. 

Venture Capital (SICARs) 

17 . 
Venture capital i s a type o f private equity capital. I t i s a structured technique that provides capital 
to high-growth emerging companies. Venture capital enables enterprises to obtain private equity capital 
that i s granted without any collateral (or tangible and intangible guarantees) and i s paid back in the 
medium term by the enterprise i t s e l f once i t has started to generate profits. SICARs provide funding to 
help to finalize the financing plan. Together with the project sponsors and FOPRODI (a development 
fund), SICARs provide between 3 5 and 40 percent o f total investment. There are currently over 40 
SICARs operating in Tunisia. A t the end o f 2007, in over 12 years o f activity, venture capital had helped 
to finance 1,300 companies, w i th funds amounting to close to TND 600 million. While the Finance Law 
o f 2009 made it possible to remove major hurdles to the development o f SICARs, there are s t i l l two 
strong constraints that w i l l take longer to address: 

112 

0 Due to the limitations o f Tunisian stock market and the alternative market, prospects o f exit via the 
stock exchange remain slim; 
I t appears that a number o f SICARs lack expertise in the appraisal, approval and monitoring o f 
technology projects. This inhibits their involvement in this sector.

Conclusion 

18. 
As a whole, despite the government’s substantial commitment to supporting the private sector and 
SMEs, financing granted in the las t decade has plateaued at roughly 64 to 6 8 percent o f GDP. This i s 
because there are s t i l l a number o f constraints on the smooth functioning o f the SME financing system.
