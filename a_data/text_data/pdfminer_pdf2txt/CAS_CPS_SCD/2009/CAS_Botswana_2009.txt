EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Botswana i s one o f t h e world’s great development success stories. One o f only very few 
countries in the world to have sustained a long period o f high growth, it i s also a rare example o f a 
country that has escaped the ‘na tura l resource curse’, despite its abundant diamond resources. Political 
stability, mature democratic processes, good policies and strong institutions have underpinned 
effective economic management for over four decades. 

This exemplary success in good governance, macroeconomic and f i s c a l management has, 
however, not yet been matched by broad improvements i n human development outcomes. This 
apparent contradiction manifests itself today in high poverty and unemployment rates and in 
Botswana’s ranking as the fifth most unequal country in the world. Government recognizes that unless 
inequality i s reduced and human development indicators rise, f u t u r e economic growth cannot be 
sustained. A t no stage has this been more evident than at this time o f global economic turmoil. 

In order to reduce poverty and inequality, the key challenge for Botswana i s to diversify the 
economy away from diamonds. Today, despite major efforts towards diversification, the diamond and 
the public sectors s t i l l dominate the economy. There i s a growing recognition i n the country at the 
highest political level that a greater focus on public sector effectiveness, including more effective 
implementation o f policies and programs, as well as less dependency by citizens on the state for 
development solutions i s required. Botswana i s in need o f a more competitive and dynamic private 
sector that can generate more employment. To make this a reality, however, s k i l l s development must 
be more responsive t o the needs o f the labor market. Botswana also s u f f e r s from the second highest 
HIV/AIDS adult prevalence ra te in the world, and the pandemic i s a significant drain on the economy 
and on society. Furthermore, infrastructure capacity and quality have not kept pace with growth, and 
the electricity, transport and water sectors in particular are now presenting bottlenecks to sustained 
growth. With the threat o f losing 70 percent o f the current electricity supply by 2013, when South 
Africa w i l l stop a l l electricity exports to Botswana, achieving energy security has become an urgent 
national priority. 

In addition to these challenges, Botswana i s also strongly affected by the global economic 
meltdown s ince la te 2008. The consequences are a sharp decline in GDP growth caused by 
plummeting demand in particular for diamonds, triggering a closing o f mines and exacerbating already 
high unemployment rates, especially among youth, a burgeoning f i s c a l deficit and rapidly worsening 
balance o f payments. I n some sense, this scenario i s a ‘ fas t forward’ glimpse into the future when 
Botswana w i l l run out o f diamonds, and i t serves as an urgent reminder o f the need to diversify the 
economy in order to sustain past gains and achieve sustainable development in the future. 

Botswana i s conscious o f the fact that t h e past development paradigm, that was so successful 
in bringing the country to this point, may no longer be suitable fo r the future and require some 
adjustments while building on past successes. These changes w i l l not come overnight, but Botswana’s 
leadership i s poised to use the global economic c r i s i s as an opportunity to more rapidly rea l ize i t s 
vision o f using a l l o f i t s assets - not just diamonds - more effectively, to achieve shared economic 
growth and more rapidly reduce poverty and inequality. 

The Government i s responding swiftly to the immediate challenges while building for the 
future and looking for the “silver lining” beyond the c r is is . I t i s getting the economy ready for l i f e 
after diamonds by developing a 2 l S t century physical and human capital base, containing the crippling 
HIV/AIDS pandemic, increasing the effectiveness o f public sector spending and improving 
environmental management which i s essen t ia l for the large and growing tourism industry. To meet the 
immediate c r is is , the Government -just as this strategy i s being finalized - i s realigning the budget 
and reassessing policy priorities, improving public sector efficiency to ensure targeting and 
effectiveness and investing with urgency in the electricity sector to ensure domestic energy security. 

i 

In the medium term, the Government aims for greater competitiveness by providing c r i t i c a l 
infrastructure investments and skills upgrading for the future, by increasing the effectiveness o f social 
spending, education and HIV/AIDS programs and by building the foundation for diversification 
through private sector growth in non-extractive industries, with regional integration as one driver. 

After a long hiatus in the relationship, the World Bank has been requested to gradually and 
selectively scale-up levels o f support, always driven by client-demand as with other development 
partners. In l i n e with this request, the overall strategic objective o f the Bank’s engagement in 
Botswana i s to help the Government u s e a l l o f i t s resources (both non-renewable and renewable) to 
sustain growth and defeat poverty and inequality. 

The young partnership has grown steadily in the past few years. The Bank was first requested 
to assist the Government by increasing the effectiveness o f i t s response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, 
while taking into account the global public good nature o f the challenge and the high levels o f grant 
support the country i s receiving from partners. In response, the first IBRD ‘buy down’ operation in 
Africa was prepared to help Botswana fight the pandemic more effectively and was approved by the 
Board in July 2008 (US $ 50 million). Additional requests for f inanc ia l support have focused on 
making improvements in the transport sector (U S $ 180 million, Board in June 2009), achieving 
domestic electricity security (US$450 million, Board i n June 2009) and an electricity export project 
(US$ 100 million, Board in FY 10/11). For the purpose o f IBRD’s internal risk exposure analysis, an 
indicative lending envelope o f up to US$1 billion i s assumed for the CPS period, with the 
understanding that IBRD’s capacity to lend can change over time and that lending plans are indicative. 

In addition to these financial investments, which are c r i t i c a l i f Botswana i s to tack le poverty 
and inequality more effectively and rapidly, the World Bank has also been asked to broaden and 
deepen the ana ly t ica l knowledge base, which was depleted during the long hiatus, in order to provide 
policy advice. An ongoing Public Expenditure Review w i l l be one entry point into enhancing our 
understanding o f why public spending has not been more effective in providing better development 
outcomes, especially in soc ia l sectors. The HIV/AIDS project and a study on education, skills and the 
labor market w i l l complement this work. Government has also requested the Bank to prepare policy 
options in areas i t deems c r i t ica l for competitiveness, drawing on the Bank’s international experience. 

As the partnership with Botswana as an important middle income client in Africa continues to 
mature, the Bank intends to gradually deepen and broaden the policy dialogue in order to help the 
country more effectively address the poverty and inequality challenge by availing i t s e l f o f the full 
array o f the Bank Group’s analytical and financing support, while remaining selective and demand 
driven. Opening a country office in Gaborone would also provide a significant step forward in this 
regard. 

This CPS comes at a time when the fu l l impact o f the global financial cr ises on the Botswana 
economy i s s t i l l unfolding. During CPS consultations the Bank has discussed a wide range o f options 
and we intend to maintain flexibility in how we respond to the evolving needs. Adjustments to the 
program w i l l therefore have to be made in the coming months.

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Coun try Partnership Strategy (CPS) presents the W o r l d Bank ’s ind ica t ive program fo r 
Bo tswana fo r the pe r iod F Y 0 9 t o FY13 . This first-ever Bank strategy fo r Bo tswana comes in response 
t o increased in te res t f r om the Government o f Botswana fo r a scaled-up W o r l d Bank G roup (WBG) 
program tha t has been limited in the 15 years. The strategy has been developed in consu l ta t ion with 
the Government o f Botswana, and i s linked t o the na t iona l development p r io r i t ies as set fo r th in 
Botswana’s long t e r m development strategy “V is ion 20 16”, and i t s Na t iona l Deve lopmen t Plans 
(NDPs). The CPS w i l l support the f ina l year o f N D P 9 (2003-2008) and the f i r s t fou r years o f ND P 1 0 
(2009-20 16). 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. BOTSWANA: A COUNTRY OF CONTRASTS 

2. 
Bo tswana i s a land locked coun try o f about 1.9 m i l l i o n inhabitants spread over an area 
approx ima te ly the size o f France o r Kenya . I t s environment i s mos t ly a r id with the Ka laha r i Desert 
cover ing 70 percent o f the country, and the popu la t ion i s ma in ly concentrated in the l i t t l e arable land 
that e x i s t s in the eastern parts o f the country. Bo tswana i s an A f r ican success story. I t s remarkable 
economic g row th record (see B o x 1) and good governance have transformed it f r om one o f the wor ld ’s 
poorest countries (GDP per capita o f US$70 at independence in 1966) in to the ranks o f m idd le- income 
countries today. Botswana’s g row th story i s a testament to h o w a coun try o n a con t inen t r idden by 
pover ty and government fa i lu re can change i t s course, u s e na tura l resources well, and become one o f 
the fastest g row ing economies in the wo r ld . 

3 . 

Bo tswana takes pride in be ing a mature democracy. F ree and fa i r elections are he ld regu lar ly 
and the cons t i tu t ion prov ides fo r fundamental rights and freedoms. The po l i t ica l scene i s remarkab ly 
stable. The Botswana Democra t ic Par ty (BDP) has been in power since the f i r s t elections were held on 
the eve o f independence in 1965. Fo rme r Vice-president and the son o f Botswana’s f i r s t President 
Seretse Khama, Lt. General Sere tse Khama I a n Khama, was inaugurated as Botswana’s fou r th 
President in April 2008; the Presidential trans i t ion went smoothly. The nex t na t iona l elections are 
scheduled fo r late 2009. 

4. 

Bo tswana regularly ranks at the ,top o f countries in the A f r i c a n continent in terms o f 
governance and transparency. Acco rd ing to Transparency In terna t iona l ’s Co r rup t ion Index, Bo tswana 
i s the least corrup t coun try in Sub Saharan A f r i c a (SSA) and ranks 36’ 
in terna t iona l ly . The W o r l d 
Bank I n s t i t u t e ’ s Governance Ind ica tors place Botswana ahead o f the g loba l average f o r upper middle- 
income countries with pa r t icu la r ly high marks fo r po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and con t ro l o f corrup t ion . 

5 . 

In the reg iona l context, Bo tswana has always been active in seeking oppor tun i t ies fo r reg iona l 
integration. This i s pa r t icu la r ly impor tan t g iven Botswana’s sma l l popu la t ion and economy, 
land locked geography, and interdependency with i t s giant neighbor, South A f r ica . Bo tswana was a 
found ing member o f the Southern A f r ican Deve lopmen t Commun i ty (SADC ) wh ich has i t s 
headquarters in the cap i ta l c i t y o f Gaborone. I t i s also a member o f the A f r i c a n U n i o n (AU) and 
Southern A f r ican Customs U n i o n (SACU) .

6. 

Botswana i s one o f only about a dozen countries in the world that have been able to secure 
high economic growth for a prolonged period o f time’. Botswana’s economic growth, which averaged 
about 9 percent a year in the four decades following independence, outpaced even the Asian Tiger 
economies. W h i l e growth was driven by the discovery o f vast mineral resources, mainly diamonds, 
this alone does not explain the country’s success. How did Botswana succeed where so many other 
countries have failed? How did it avoid the “resource curse” and translated i t s mineral resources into 
economic growth and better lives for many o f i t s citizens? As Box 1 describes, the answer i s simple 
but profound: strong leadership that adopted good policies and built the institutions needed to 
implement those policies. 

Box 1 : W h a t explains Botswana’s past high growth rates? 
The key to success was that diamonds translated into wealth due to the good policies the 
Government adopted and strong institutions that implemented them. Three c r i t i c a l factors 
seem to distinguish Botswana from other natural resource-rich countries and to create an 
enabling environment for these good policies and institutions3. These include: 

*:* 

*:* 

Botswana has had a 150 year history o f enlightened leadership that promoted education, 
and strove to modernize and maintain independence from co lon ia l r u l e . 
Botswana was closer to a “nation state” than any other African nation. The national 
boundaries enclosed people who, i f not always ethnically Tswana, had been integrated 
into a set o f indigenous states and institutions. 
0 Botswana had relatively inclusive pre-colonial institutions which survived t h e impact o f 
colonialism. After independence, the political legacy o f indigenous institutions, such as 
the kgotla4 proved important in promoting accountability. 

Particularly in the years following independence, Botswana’s leadership, currently led by 
President Seretse Khama Ian Khama o f the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), adopted 
successful strategies to shape the hture o f the nation and established a multiracial and 
democratic society. Government’s e f for ts were reinforced by considerable foreign aid which 
Botswana was able to attract being the only liberal democracy surrounded by minority-ruled 
Southern African states. Barely ten years into independence diamond income had begun t o 
accrue and the Government’s budget was in surplus. Again, the Government made good 
decisions and invested the mineral revenues w e l l in improving soc ia l and economic 
conditions, including building infrastructure, and developing health and education systems. 
Soon, the diamond industry established itself as the main engine o f growth and the state-led 
development strategy continued to propel the country’s rapid development. 

7 . 

While growth ra tes have declined somewhat since the early 1990s, they have remained robust, 
averaging more than five percent over the past five years. Prudent investment o f i t s mining revenues 
and cautious f i s c a l management has ensured this strong performance. Despite these achievements, 
Botswana’s economy rests on a narrow foundation - - diamond production -- which in recen t years has 
accounted for over 40 percent o f GDP and in large part sustains economic expansion and social 

’ Commission on Growth and Development, “The Growth Report: Strategies for Sustained Growth and Inclusive 
Development” (2008). 
Most Countries that rely heavily on a single natural resource, such as diamonds in the case o f Botswana, have difficulty 
managing the associated foreign exchange income and i t s fluctuations. “Dutch D isease” i s the frequent result, characterized 
by the appreciation o f the exchange rate, relatively expensive labor costs, and the unsustainable expansion o f service sectors. 
For most o f the past four decades, Botswana has kept these symptoms i n check through t h e pursuit o f cautious 
macroeconomic policies and an emphasis on social expenditures. Instead o f unbalanced development, the country 
experienced four decades o f economic growth. 
See e.g. Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson: “An A fr ican Success Story: Botswana”. 
A ‘Kgotla’ i s a public meeting, community council or traditional law court o f a Botswana village. I t i s usually headed by the 
village ch ie f , and community decisions are always arrived at by consensus.

spending (a l e v e l that i s more ak in to a European social democracy with a large we l fare state than a 
deve lop ing economy in A f r ica ) . D iamond produc t ion i s reach ing a plateau, however. Within a decade, 
as surface diamonds a re pro jec ted to run out and mining w i l l go underground, d iamond p roduc t ion i s 
l i k e l y t o s low considerably, and current projections are tha t it w i l l v i r tua l ly cease by 2030. U n l e s s new 
sources o f m inera ls emerge, revenues w i l l fa l l . 

8. 
Bo tswana i s concerned that g row th i s s t i l l too dependent on diamonds and o n Government. 
D iamonds have in recent years accounted fo r 60 percent o f exports and about 40 percent o f 
Government revenues. Be tween 1994 and 2005, the we igh t o f the mining and Government sectors 
together grew f r om 52 to 58 percent o f GDP, while agriculture, manu fac tur ing and cons truc t ion 
experienced a secular decline, f rom con t r ibu t ing 16 percent t o GD P in 1994 to 10 percent in 2005. In 
agriculture, the to ta l rea l value o f output has decreased, in absolute terms, in the past t w o decades. 

9. 
The re la t ive ly short ho r izon until the pro jec ted decline in d iamond produc t ion implies that 
non-d iamond g row th must accelerate s ign i f ican t ly in the com ing years in order t o avo id a con trac t ion 
o f the economy. Yet the investment rate - especially f r om the pr iva te sector - i s curren t ly too l o w f o r 
that replacement t o occur. G r ow t h in the non -m in ing p r iva te sector has been disappointing, and has 
no t supported the rate o f j o b creation that the coun try needs t o reduce i t s high unemp loymen t rate, 
especially among the youth. 

10. 
Botswana’s economy does no t produce enough o f the right kinds o f j o b s . At almost 10 
percent a year, j o b creation in the fo rma l economy over the past 40 years has been faster than the rate 
o f popu la t ion and labor force growth, but over this pe r iod there has been a s ign i f ican t shift in wo rke r 
preferences, especially among Botswana’s youth. Rising education and l o w agr icu l tura l incomes have 
led recent school leavers t o turn their backs on agr icu l ture and seek emp loymen t in urban service and 
manu fac tur ing . This exodus f r om trad i t iona l emp loymen t has led to an unemp loymen t rate among 
Botswana’s you th o f 35 percent in contrast to an ove ra l l unemp loymen t rate o f near ly 20 percent5. 

1 1. 
In the sphere o f monetary and exchange rate po l icy , while in f la t ion has never reached the ve ry 
high l e v e l s seen by some deve lop ing countries, in f la t ion in Bo tswana has nonetheless been too high, 
as the coun try has been unable t o consistently get in f la t ion d ow n t o l e v e l s comparable with South 
A f r i c a o r ma jo r in terna t iona l economies. I n f l a t i o n has therefore had a negative impac t o n reg iona l and

Botswana’s impressive track record o f good governance and economic g row th supported by 
prudent macroeconomic and f isca l management stands in contrast t o the country’s s t i l l high l e v e l s o f 
pove r ty and inequa l i ty and generally l o w human development indicators. While Botswana’s economic 
progress over the past fo r ty years has s ign i f ican t ly raised l i v i n g standards fo r about two- th irds o f the 
population, a th i rd o r more o f i t s people have been l e f t behind. Unemp loymen t has been persistently 
high at approx ima te ly 20 percent, household incomes are much lowe r in ru ra l than in urban areas 
(HIES 2002/03), and, while ru ra l pover ty rates have fallen, they rema in s ign i f ican t ly higher than in 
urban areas. As a consequence, Botswana’s income inequa l i ty i s the fifth wors t in the w o r l d (Gini co- 
e f f ic ien t o f 60.5 % - UN ranking). The HIV/AIDS pandemic has further exacerbated the situation: the

W h i l e the factors con t r ibu t ing t o sustained high g row th rates in Bo tswana are well researched 
(see B o x l), the apparent con trad ic t ion between good governance and good economic management on 
the one hand and very l o w human development indicators o n the other hand i s l e s s w e l l understood. 
Ana lyz ing current data i s an issue, with t h e latest aggregated household income data go ing back t o 
2002/3, and disaggregated data on ly available f r om 19937. The Bank’s current body o f ana ly t ica l w o r k 
i s also limited due t o the hiatus in the lending relationship. However, the w o r k tha t has been done over 
the past years suggests a comb ina t ion o f factors con t r ibu t ing to this apparent contradiction, but more 
w o r k w i l l need to be undertaken in the com ing years. 

14. With regard to factors a f fec t ing human development outcomes, the i s s u e i s tha t despite high 
l e v e l s o f budget outlays, Botswana i s no t yet ge t t ing su f f ic ien t ‘value fo r money’. W h i l e Botswana’s 
s l i d e in the HDI rankings, f r om number 72 ( o f 130 countries) in 1990 to 126 ( o f 179 countries) in 
20088 can be large ly explained by the dec l ine in l i f e expectancy due to the W / A I D S pandemic, the 
coun try underperforms on a number o f other indicators when compared t o countries in i t s income 
range. Botswana’s past economic model, heav i ly centered on mining, has kep t unemp loymen t rates 
high, at about 20 percent. The economy’s inab i l i ty t o generate su f f ic ien t emp loymen t t o absorb newly

p r ima ry education, as well as in ne t enro l lmen t ratios in p r ima ry and secondary school (although 
Botswana compares favorab ly with Sub-Saharan A f r ican middle income countries such as South 
A f r i c a and Nam ib ia) . This i s pa r t icu la r ly striking g iven tha t Bo tswana outspends i t s comparators by a 
w ide ma rg in in education: Botswana’s pub l ic sector spends over 21 percent o f i t s to ta l budget, and 
near ly 10 percent o f GDP, o n the education sector, compared t o 14 and 4.7 percent fo r the average 
upper m idd le income coun try . Spending o n secondary education per student in Bo tswana i s a very 
high 40 percent o f per capita income, and 438 percent o f per capita income f o r t e r t i a r y education, 
compared t o 20 and 24 percent in upper m idd le income countries, respectively. 

16. 
In the hea l th sector the situation i s s im i lar : Bo tswana spends 4.5 percent o f i t s GD P and 18 
percent o f the to ta l Government budget o n the sector, compared to 3.5 percent and 1 1.2 o n average in 
other upper m idd le income countries. Wh i le Botswana compares favorab ly in access t o improved 
water sources and c h i l d immun iza t ion rates, in a number o f areas it per forms poor ly , inc lud ing in 
access to imp roved sanitation facilities, the prevalence o f undernourishment, maternal mo r ta l i ty ratios 
and l i f e expectancy - a l though the latter i s a func t ion o f high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Poor social 
development outcomes are fur ther exacerbated by a fragmented social pro tec t ion system. 

17. 
W i t h regard to the economy as a whole, Botswana, as a land locked coun try with a sma l l 
domestic economy, has a ve ry narrow economic base and has been dom ina ted by the m ine ra l sector 
fo r the past decades. Pr iva te sector growth, while positive, has no t been able t o keep pace with the 
much faster g row th o f the m ine ra l sector, and that o f Government. Constraints to competitiveness in 
the investment climate, regu la tory issues, an apparent m isma tch between the s k i l l s produced by the 
education sector and those requ ired by a modem labor marke t as w e l l as increasing in fras truc ture 
bottlenecks have hampered d ivers i f ica t ion , pr iva te investment and thereby j o b creation. 

18. 
Government po l ic ies and programs a imed at imp rov ing competitiveness and wea l th 
red is tr ibu t ion - a l though generally well designed and executed transparently - have n o t been e f fec t ive 
enough and o f ten lack in imp lemen ta t ion . M a n y in the coun try today be l ieve tha t the p le thora o f 
pub l ic programs may indeed have inadver ten t ly led to a ‘dependency cu l ture ’ in the economy and in 
society. Las t ly , in more recent years, the tremendous burden o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic has increased 
costs fo r the fiscus and companies, and continues t o pose a ma jo r sus ta inab i l i ty risk t o the economy, 
and a great burden on P LW H A , their families, communities and society as a whole. I t appears that, as 
a result o f a comb ina t ion o f these factors, pover ty and inequa l i ty have n o t decreased su f f ic ien t ly in 
Botswana. Government fully realizes that unless it can solve this d is t r ibu t iona l challenge go ing 
forward, g row th cannot be sustained over time. Government i s look ing t o i t s development partners fo r 
assistance in designing p o l i c y options and p rov id ing f inanc ing t o address these challenges. 

B. IMMED IATE CHALLENGES 

19. 
Botswana’s c r i t ica l medium-term p r i o r i t y i s to diversify i t s economy in order t o create the 
employment opportunities needed to lift citizens ou t o f pover ty and reduce inequa l i ty . T o do this, the 
coun try must increase competitiveness and reverse trends in human development ind ica tors (especially 
in education and health). But, as Botswana tackles these longer t e r m goals, i t faces more immediate 
and pressing challenges tha t must be met if the economy i s t o sustain i t s past g row th record and 
prepare fo r g loba l recovery. 

20. 
The f i r s t immediate challenge i s t o p ro tec t the economyfr.om the wo rs t of 
the global economic 
c r is is . Econom ic g row th i s down, exports and Government revenues have plummeted, and 
unemployment i s on the increase. Econom ic g row th fo r 2008-201 1 i s pro jec ted to dec l ine substantially 
f r om the 3.3 percent attained in 2007/08, f isca l de f ic i ts w i l l emerge a f ter years o f surpluses, and the 

5 

current account balance w i l l shrink substantially f r om the 19 percent surplus seen in 2007. As a sma l l 
open economy, Botswana’s re l iance o n in terna t iona l trade means tha t wha t happens t o exports and 
impo r ts w i l l be the ma in channel through w h i c h external economic developments are transmitted to 
the economy in the near term. In turn, the f a l l in d iamond income w i l l lead t o a sharp reduc t ion in 
Government revenues.

In terms o f economic growth, and in contrast to the 1981-2 crisis, where Botswana’s d iamond 
exports also f e l l by close t o 50 percent, and the impac t o n GD P and emp loymen t was neg l ig ib le , the 
e f fec t on GD P g row th o f the current crisis w i l l be large, with the economy projected t o shrink through 
2010, likely re tu rn ing to pos i t ive g row th in 201 1. U n l i k e the s i tua t ion in the early 1980s, where 
Debswana con t inued to produce diamonds and grew i t s stockpiles, today the decision has been made 
t o reduce p roduc t ion s ign i f ican t ly . At the sector level, the d iamond industry i s su f fer ing severely f r om 
restricted c red i t ava i lab i l i ty and reduced demand. By the end o f 2008, the d iamond supply p ipe l ine 
was no t able to absorb any new supplies o f rpugh diamonds f r om Debswana, the 50-50 j o i n t venture 
be tween the Government o f Bo tswana and D e Beers, and Botswana’s rough d iamond exports 
plummeted. This led Debswana t o announce that i t w o u l d shut down operations through April 2009 
(Le. no d iamond produc t ion fo r at least the f i r s t 3 months o f 2009) pending rev iew o f marke t 
conditions. The company also announced the closure o f t w o mines fo r the en t i re ty o f 2009. Smaller 
companies in d iamond exp lora t ion have also shut down operations, as have n icke l and copper mines. 

22. 
The mine closures have resu l ted in the loss o f an estimated 4,500 jobs, about h a l f o f them at 
Debswana. M o r e j o b losses are likely in the com ing mon ths as companies in the Debswana supply 
cha in are affected. Declines in produc t ion have also impacted Botswana’s f ledg l ing po l ish ing and 
cu t t ing industry. The impac t o f the crisis on the mining sector, wh ich emp loys around 13,000 people, 
i s just beg inn ing to be f e l t . The secondary effects o f a dec l ine in the sector w i l l reach deeper in to the 

6 

economy, fo r instance as many miners no rma l ly u s e their mining income t o finance ag r icu l tu ra l inputs 
and emp loy s ta f f in the house and fo r farm ing . 

23, 
The prospects fo r diamonds depend o n economic developments in the ma jo r r ich -coun t ry 
markets. The U S , Europe and Japan together account fo r 76 percent o f the d iamond market, with the 
U S alone representing 45 percent (2006). The Government expects d iamond sales revenue t o f a l l by 
ha l f . With mos t analysts n ow p red ic t ing tha t general economic recovery in the US and other developed 
markets w i l l be s low and weak, i t i s l i k e l y tha t Botswana’s d iamond exports w i l l rema in depressed fo r 
some time t o come. The early 1980s recession s e r v e s as a b leak reminder: i t took seven years be fore 
rough d iamond sales recovered t o pre-crisis levels. 

24. 
The impac t on Bo tswana has been severe. Since the g loba l economic cr is is un fo lded in the 
fou r th quarter o f 2008, in the fou r mon ths between October 2008 and January 2009, the value o f 
Botswana’s d iamond exports dropped by 5 1 percent as compared to a year earlier. D iamond prices 
have also fa l len by close t o 10 percent f r om the i r peak in August 2008, and h r t h e r declines are 
expected, with analysts forecasting a to ta l drop o f 20-30 percent. In add i t ion t o diamonds, copper and 
n i c k e l export values, wh ich represent about 15 percent o f to ta l exports, have also dropped by over 50 
percent since the crisis. Problems with m ine ra l exports w i l l a f fec t no t just those sectors but w i l l have 
macroeconomic consequences as we l l . 

2 5 . 

Dec l ines o f this magnitude are l i k e l y t o induce a f a l l in Government revenues o f close to 20 
percent. L ow e r m ine ra l revenues are l i k e l y t o be compounded by slower g row th in other revenue 
sources, inc lud ing S A C U revenues, earnings f r om fore ign exchange reserves, and domestic tax 
revenues (VAT and income tax). With the large f a l l in revenues, s ign i f ican t f isca l de f ic i ts are forecast 
at least through 20 1 1, averaging 10 percent o f GD P over the com ing t w o years (2009/10 - 201 0/11) 
accord ing the Government’s latest estimates. Given the large ro le p layed by Governmen t expenditures 
in the economy, infrastructure needs associated with d ive rs i f ica t ion and pove r ty reduc t ion efforts, and 
t h e f isca l requirements o f HIV/AIDS treatment and preven t ion programs, a sharp cu t in expenditures 
w o u l d carry large long- term costs. Currently, the Government expects expenditures t o rema in fa i r ly 
f la t in rea l t e rm s over the next t w o years, a l though this w i l l be con t inua l ly reevaluated in light o f 
g loba l developments regardin the pro jec ted depth and dura t ion o f the cr is is and their impac t o n 
Botswana’s m ine ra l revenues.

26. 
W i t h d iamond exports unlikely t o return t o pre-crisis l e v e l s any time soon, curren t account 
balances w i l l shrink, and are likely to turn to de f ic i ts fo r some years. The current account surplus i s 
estimated to have shrunk f rom 19 percent in 2007 t o under 5 percent o f GDP in 2008. The reduc t ion 
in exports due t o diamonds alone i s likely to be o n the order o f 10-1 5 percent o f GDP, but w i l l be 
accompanied by declines in exports o f other ma jo r commod i t ies such as copper-nickel. Bo tswana may 
well experience trade de f ic i ts close t o 10 percent o f GDP in the near fu tu re . While impo r ts w i l l be 
restrained by the decline in economic ac t iv i ty and the effects o f Pu la depreciation against some 
currencies’o, it i s likely tha t trade de f ic i ts w i l l need t o be pa r t ia l ly financed by fo re ign exchange 
rese rves . The rate o f drawdown o f fore ign exchange rese rves w i l l depend on the rate o f Pu la 
depreciation and on the Government’s p o l i c y response (Le. measures to res tra in imports). The 
impetus o n impor ts w i l l be supported by large infrastructure needs associated with transport and 
ene rgy requirements fo r sustained g row th and d ive rs i f ica t ion in the med ium and l o n g terms. In the

The Government is, at the time o f CPS printing, in the process o f prioritizing its expenditure program w i th the objective o f 
cutting back on unnecessary spending and focusing on items in both the current and capital budgets with clear long term 
benefits in terms o f sustained growth and diversification. The details o f this exercise are not yet available in time fo r

impor ts . W i t h to ta l reserves at around BWP70 b i l l ion , this i s no t a prob lem in the short-term, but w i l l 
become a concern as the f a l l in exports stretches in to the medium-term. 

27. 
Bo tswana i s in a stronger pos i t ion than many other m ine ra l p roduc ing economies in the 
continent, with fo re ign exchange reserves p rov id ing nearly two years’ w o r t h o f impo r t cover, and a 
year’s wo r th o f expenditures saved f r om prev ious years’ f isca l surpluses. Ano ther po in t in Botswana’s 
favo r i s the very l o w leve l o f pub l ic external debt, estimated at less than 3 percent o f GDP, and a 
s im i la r ly l o w domestic pub l ic debt, at 2.6 percent o f GDP. These a l l p rov ide degrees o f freedom and 
w i l l se rve as a cush ion that may enable a gradual, rather than abrupt, adjustment t o adverse 
circumstances. Nevertheless, the economy’s high dependence o n d iamond and m ine ra l revenues and 
o n Government spending based o n these revenues poses a s ign i f ican t danger tha t reserves can be very 
rap id ly depleted and debt accumulated, at the expense o f long te rm sustainability. Trade and f isca l 
de f ic i t f inanc ing w i l l become an increasing challenge i f the f a l l in exports stretches in to the medium 
term, as it appears l i k e l y t o do. T o manage this, Government spending w i l l need to be reduced 
substantially, and sharply focused o n items with s ign i f ican t con tr ibu t ions t o ma in ta in ing Botswana’s 
l o n g term grow th . I f the f isca l de f ic i ts pro jec ted in Table 1 are realized, and financed through the 
d raw -down o f accumulated reserves, they cou ld consume over 80 percent o f the Government’s 
accumulated savings at the Bank o f Botswana (estimated at about BWP 30 b i l l i o n ) by 201 1. As the 
f a l l in d iamond and other revenues are likely to extend in to the medium term, exc lus ive reliance o n 
reserves fo r f inanc ing i s no t feasible, and a comb ina t ion o f expenditure reduc t ion and recourse t o 
domestic and external debt w i l l be needed. 

28. 
The prospect o f f isca l de f ic i ts after many years o f su 
l u s e s has led Government to in i t ia te a 
process o f p r io r i t iza t ion in the budget, wh ich i s s t i l l ongoing? In the pub l ic expenditure program o f 
the Tenth Na t iona l Deve lopmen t P lan (NDP 10) Government o f f ic ia ls are n o w look ing f o r those 
projects that w o u l d have the greatest pos i t ive impac t on g row th and on emp loymen t in the short te rm . 
I t w i l l be impor tan t t o identify those expenditures tha t can p rov ide the mos t e f fec t ive f isca l stimulus, 
w h i l e at the same time pro tec t ing investments that w i l l assist with the d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the economy 
and reduce pover ty . Investments in human cap i ta l rema in essential fo r fu ture grow th . The l o n g te rm 
costs o f a discontinuation o f AIDS treatment programs fo r instance w o u l d have ve ry high costs in the 
l o n g t e r m through exponen t ia l ly h igher f u t u r e treatment costs, greater loss in p roduc t iv i ty and even 
higher f isca l outlays. Equa l ly , cuts in education spending w o u l d underm ine the country’s ab i l i ty t o 
generate the human cap i ta l needed t o make the trans i t ion to a more d ive rs i f ied economy. 

29. 
The second immed ia te challenge t o overcome i s the electricity crisis tha t has become acute 
since South A f r i c a began ‘ load shedding”* in early 2008. As have several other Southern A f r ican

unemp loymen t and pover ty sustainably i s to build a pr iva te sector that can compete and th r ive in 
reg iona l and g loba l markets. At present, however, the p r iva te sector lacks dynam ism and i s too 
dependent o n Government to be able t o drive d ivers i f ica t ion . A t t rac t ing FDI beyond the mining sector 
has been d i f l icu l t , due in par t t o the high cost o f do ing business in Botswana. Transport and utility 
costs and re la t ive ly high labor costs13 a l l increase the challenge o f compe t ing fo r in terna t iona l

The curren t cr is is provides, in some ways, a w i n d ow on a fu ture when d iamond revenues w i l l 
n o longer f o rm the mainstay o f Botswana’s economy. The need t o d ive rs i fy the economy away f r om 
m ine ra l wea l th cou ld ha rd ly be more stark. Over the past twen ty years, Bo tswana has begun t o reduce 
dependence upon diamonds: m ine ra l revenues accounted fo r well over 5 5 percent o f to ta l Government 
revenues in the late 1990s; today the figure i s under 40 percent. The balance o f payments i s less 
dependent o n d iamond exports than it was in the ear ly 1990s, with non-d iamond exports be fore the 
g loba l economic cr is is cover ing near ly 60 percent o f Botswana’s impor ts . Botswana’s h is to ry o f 
sound management, good governance, and an emerging focus o n enhancing reg iona l competitiveness

Botswana’s N D P 10 identifies tourism, in terna t iona l f inanc ia l services, energy, agr icu l ture and 
manu fac tur ing as the ma in po ten t ia l sectors fo r d ive rs i f ica t ion t o new value chains, as well as reg iona l 
power export. Whatever the sectors w i l l eventually be, g iven Botswana’s sma l l domestic economy, 
resource’s-endowment and geographic location, d ive rs i f ica t ion w i l l likely have to be expor t- led and 
skills-intensive, with a focus on non-extractive industries, but also require d ive rs i f ica t ion within the 
m ine ra l sector and add ing more va lue in downstream produc t ion . 

35. 
Botswana’s unique environment and abundant w i l d l i f e gives it a na tura l comparative 
advantage fo r nature-based tourism. The sector has fu ture potential, pa r t icu la r ly as i t i s increas ing ly 
being perceived as an engine f o r economic grow th . Botswana’s tou r ism industry in 2007 generated 
U S $ l .l b i l l i o n o f economic ac t iv i ty according to the latest Tou r ism Satellite Accoun t repor t produced 
by the W o r l d T rave l & Tou r ism Counc i l (WTTC) . Acco rd ing t o estimates, tou r ism directly 
con tr ibu ted 4 percent o f to ta l employment and 4.3 percent o f to ta l GD P in Bo tswana in 2007. Adding

Botswana’s labor costs high i n some industries.

the d irec t and ind i rec t impacts o f the tou r ism sector o n the economy brings the con t r ibu t ion t o 10.6 
percent o f to ta l employment, 9.7 percent o f to ta l GDP, and about 16 percent o f non -m in ing GDP . 

36. 
T o move this sector closer to i t s potential, the Government in 2007 updated i t s trave l and 
tou r ism po l ic ies and i s undertaking a se r ies o f actions ( fo r example through sub-leasing o f commun i ty 
safari concession areas and selling o f annual wildlife hunting quotas) designed t o open up 
development opportunities fo r the ru ra l poor, wh i le ma in ta in ing the eco log ica l balance. However , 
recent studies and interviews with stakeholders con f i rm that three over-arch iv ing reasons are 
con t r ibu t ing t o limiting economic performance and investments: a) the absence o f large in terna t iona l 
investments capable o f d r iv ing high va lue markets and building loca l supply chains; b) high input 
costs and poo r levels o f service as well as imm ig ra t ion and customs’ constraints; and c) the high 
prevalence o f HIV/AIDS among adults, wh ich has had a deb i l i ta t ing e f fec t on the work force , and 
cou ld jeopard ize the future development o f the t rave l and tour ism industry.

Ministry o f Ag r icu l tu re i s n ow look ing in to constraints to the supply response o f farmers, and t o land 
tenure as a possible constraint t o increasing outputs. 

39. 
In an e f fo r t to integrate within an existing va lue chain, the Government i s also inves t ing in the 
downstream diamond industry, pa r t icu la r ly in d iamond sorting, valuing, cutting, po l ish ing and j ew e l r y

A m o r e e f fec t ive p u b l i c sector 

42. 
D iamond income has enabled the Government to finance high per capita leve ls o f soc ia l and 
infrastructure spending and to become the largest employer in the fo rma l sector, p rov id ing near ly 40 
percent o f a l l jobs . As the Government recognizes, there are concerns about excessive bureaucracy and 
ine f f ic iency , capacity constraints, poo r service delivery, s low progress in pr iva t iza t ion , and delays in 
pro jec t and po l icy implementation. 

43. 
The Bank has ana ly t ica l gaps15, with regard to pub l ic sector management, but i t i s evident that 
the structure o f the economy and the s ign i f ican t pub l ic con t ro l o f m ine ra l resources have translated 
in to a large share o f Government in the economy, w h i c h - comb ined with l o w outcomes in areas such 
as education and hea l th t o name two - makes increasing pub l ic sector p roduc t iv i ty and effectiveness as 
a p r io r i ty , inc lud ing keep ing the size o f the Government under con tro l . This po in t was also 
underscored by the IMF’s 2007 A r t i c l e I V reportl6. I t i s no tewor thy that even in the face o f rising 
expenditure pressures, the Government has been able t o ma in ta in f isca l restraint, ho ld ing t o the ru le o f 
l im i t i n g pub l ic spending to 40 percent o f GDP o r less . Neve r the less , social needs are large and 
growing, and there are questions regard ing the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f these programs, 
especially given the need t o c lear ly p r io r i t ize spending within a tight budget constraint imposed by the 
current g loba l economic crisis, and t o ensure that a high value-for-money i s achieved. Government 
recognizes the need t o increase e f f ic iency in the p rov is ion o f services, wh i le tak ing care tha t any 
reduc t ion in pub l ic service w o u l d be done in a way tha t cushions those who w o u l d be retrenched. 

44. 
The short-to-medium t e r m f isca l challenges fac ing Government are considerable and grow ing . 
The impac t o f H I V / A I D S , the g loba l economic crisis, high dependency o n Government contracts, 
subsidies and welfare payments, a l l lead to concerns regard ing f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty and the need to 
p r io r i t ize Government spending. This ca l ls fo r a strengthening o f ex is t ing too ls and consideration o f 
new tools, fo r improved pub l ic f inanc ia l management, as we l l as an increased emphasis o n e f f ic iency 
and effectiveness in delivery o f pub l ic service. 

45. 
A Pub l ic Expenditure and F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty (PEFA) Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management 
(PFM) Performance Assessment, sponsored by the EC, was completed in October 2008 and i s being 
rev iewed by the Government. This assessment no ted Botswana’s re la t ive ly good track record with 
respect t o aggregate f isca l d isc ip l ine . However , the P F M system i s no t yet fully capable o f strategic 
a l loca t ion o f resources. The definite budget calendar that facilitates mean ing fu l bo t tom-up 
par t ic ipa t ion by l i n e ministries and the achievement o f predictable budget releases and e f fec t ive

impacted by capacity constraints, inc lud ing procurement management challenges.

strengthening o f external audit and the implementation o f the new public procurement legal and 
regulatory framework. The commitment to continuing improvements in PFM in Botswana has been 
championed at the highest levels including by the Minister o f Finance. However, there has been no 
public sector reform strategy, with a PFM pillar, formally issued or approved by cabinet. There i s also 
a strong push fo r PFM reform from the Public Service Reform Coordinating Office i n the Office o f the 
President. 

47. 
The planning and budgeting system i s likely to face increasing difficulty in meeting the 
challenges o f flat or declining revenues. A traditional system, based upon annual l i n e item dual 
budgets drawing from National Development Plans has served Botswana well. When mineral revenues 
burgeoned, Botswana’s planning and budgeting system ensured they were used for productive e f fec t , 
both in the recurrent and capital budgets. The planning and budget system also helped Botswana 
maintain f isca l and monetary stability, and encouraged the coordination o f policies and programs 
across sectors. Nevertheless the system i s facing growing pressures and a key question emerges 
regarding the suitability o f the current system to a future where revenues w i l l no longer be as buoyant 
as they have been in the past. Budget control i s viewed as having weakened, with too many 
supplements. Each year, there i s a large gap between the budget as approved by the National 
Assembly and the budget as executed by departments. The Government i s seeking a more explicit 
emphasis on performance in budget and human resource management systems, but implementation 
has been slow. There i s a desire to see a c loser link between finance provided through the budget and 
outputs. 

48. 
Beyond the budget and planning system, increased public sector effectiveness must also be 
founded on an effective and e f f i c i e n t public service. The public service in Botswana i s large. The 
wage b i l l takes an important share o f the central Government’s recurren t budget (over 9.5 percent o f 
GDP), especially when local Governments and parastatals are included. Despite efforts to control c iv i l 
service growth, the number o f staff needed to complete projects has necessitated continued increases 
in Government employment. A t the same time, recruitment o f techn ica l and professional grades i s 
becoming increasingly difficult, making both s ize and quality key i s s u e s f o r civil service reforms. The 
Government i s implementing a number o f initiatives to improve public service performance. I t i s 
important that these move hand-in-hand with the desired improvements to the budget and planning 
process. Building on the strong governance track record o f the country, improvements t o public 
service delivery could also take explicit account o f c l ien t feedback, possibly using tools such as c l ien t 
charters, customer satisfaction surveys, etc. 

49. 
With regard to state-owned enterprises Botswana has 1 1 commercial public enterprises. Most 
o f these enjoy varying degrees o f profitability, with the exception o f Botswana Railways which i s 
running losses . A ir Botswana and the Botswana Agricultural Marketing Board have also suffered 
from poor finances in the past, although their performance improved in 2008. The Government 
intends to privatize a number o f these enterprises, including the National Development Bank, where 
the development o f a privatization strategy i s ongoing. The Botswana Telecommunications Company 
i s expected to be privatized during 2009/10, with the IFC serving as transactions adviser. A ir 
Botswana i s being recapitalized and a management contractor has been appointed. Botswana 
Railways’ large infrastructure and maintenance expenditures, unmatched by revenue growth, have 
resulted in losses on the order o f US$10 million i n 2007/08. Consequently, the Government has 
decided to restructure and recapitalize the entity, along with increasing freight t a r i f f s to cost recovery 
levels. 

Improving the investment climate 

50 . 
To create jobs in the private sector, Botswana must address impediments to investment. The 
2007 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) found that while Botswana has a relatively attractive 

12 

investment c l ima te bene f i t ing f r om macroeconomic stability, l o w corruption, and re la t ive ly good 
infrastructure, f i r m s in Botswana are no t as compe t i t ive as those in many other m idd le- income 
comparator countries and the ir p roduc t iv i ty i s lowe r . But trends in this area are pos i t ive . The findings 
o f the D o i n g Bus iness 2009 Repor t ranks Botswana 38 ou t o f 18 1 countries and 3 rd in the S ADC 
region. In addition, Botswana was ranked among the Top 10 reformers in 2009 in starting a business, 
pro tec t ing investors and trad ing across borders. While Bo tswana per forms re la t ive ly well on pay ing 
taxes, c los ing a business and registering property, rema in ing areas fo r improvemen t inc lude ease o f 
dea l ing with cons truc t ion perm i ts and en forc ing contracts. In addition, the shortage o f industry- 
relevant s k i l l s i s o f par t icu lar concern to manu fac tur ing f i r m s i f Bo tswana i s t o compete in the g loba l 
markets. 

Creating a skilled workforce 

5 1. 
E f fo r ts t o develop the pr iva te sector and in terna t iona l competitiveness are also hampered by 
s k i l l s and p roduc t iv i ty issues . Concerns are o f ten vo iced in Botswana about a lack o f entrepreneurial 
s k i l l s o r inc l ina t ion , l o w produc t iv i ty , a lack o f techn ica l and managerial s k i l l s and inappropriate 
education fo r voca t iona l purposes. Fo r reasons that are n o t yet f i l l y understood, educational outcomes 
have also dec l ined since the 1990s. W h i l e education expenditure i s high at 8 percent o f GDP, 
Government i s concerned about the qua l i ty o f education prov ided . There have been s ign i f ican t 
educational achievements, inc lud ing the p rov is ion o f near ly un iversa l and free education (adult 
l i teracy rate stood at 8 1. 2 percent in 2005), but ove ra l l outcomes have no t created the s k i l l s and 
tra ined wo rk fo rce Botswana needs. Re la t ive ly l o w t rans i t ion rates f r om j u n i o r to secondary schools 
(66 percent) and the shortage o f techn ica l and voca t iona l s k i l l s have produced a labor force with 
qua l i f ica t ions that have no t kept pace with the demands o f the pr iva te sector. Fo r instance, in the area 
o f 8’ grade science achievement, Botswana’s score has dropped wo r ldw ide between 2003 and 2007 
f r om a score o f 365 to 355, compared to a scale average o f 500 (similar resu l ts in mathematics 
achievements)’ 7 . 

Overcoming the H IV /A IDS pandemic18 

52. 
Botswana’s f i r s t HIV in fec t ion was diagnosed in 1985. Today, the coun try faces the second 
most severe W / A I D S epidemic in the w o r l d (after Swaziland) and f r om a reg iona l perspective, i s in 
the midst o f the Southern A f r i c a sub-region with the h ighes t prevalence rates in the world’g. Key 
factors fueling the epidemic inc lude the high incidence o f multiple concurrent sexual partners and 
intergenerational sexual relationships, unprotected sex, and the vu lne rab i l i ty o f women. Recent 
estimates iden t i fy 283,000 adults living with HIV/AIDS in 2008 (NACA , 2008), implying a na t iona l 
adult (15-49 years) prevalence rate o f near ly 25 percent 20. Rising mo r ta l i ty rates have para l le led the

f r om US$69.8 m i l l i o n in 2000-2001, to US$130 m i l l i o n in 2005. 

54. 
I f the past has been d i f f icu l t , the fu ture looks even more challenging. W h i l e the treatment

analysis (pre g loba l economic crisis) o f Botswana's f inanc ing and de l ive ry o f H I V / A I D S prevention, 
treatment and social support prepared by the W o r l d Bank found that despite high l e v e l s o f ow n and 
fore ign resources allocated t o the fight against HIV/AIDS, Bo tswana faces an increasing funding 
de f ic i t o f up t o US$300 m i l l i o n by 2009. Rising numbers o f social program beneficiaries, and g row ing 
social and increasing H IV /A IDS - re la ted expenditures are a l l com ing at a time when short-to-medium-

1974/75. Over this pe r iod the sector’s con t r ibu t ion t o GDP has fa l len f r om 33 percent t o 1.9 percent. 
Poor agriculture performance i s a ma in reason fo r the weak ru ra l economy, w h i c h i s pushing up 
poverty, and increasing inequa l i ty and ou t-m igra t ion to urban areas. 

Removing infrastructure bottlenecks 

58 . 

T o re-establish a rea l sense o f energy security, the Government and the Bo tswana Power 
Corpora t ion (BPC) are pursu ing a number o f in i t ia t ives . First, a Demand Side Management e f fo r t i s 
underway t o encourage energy conservation and increase e f f ic iency through a campaign that i s 
expected t o y i e l d savings o f about 50 MW by 2012. Second, the Governmen t plans to tap the 
country’s vast coa l r e s e r v e s through pub l ic and pr iva te- led in i t ia t ives t o develop coa l t o power 
projects. The Mo rupu le B pro jec t (pub l ic ly funded) w i l l expand the generation capacity o f Mo rupu le 
f rom 132 MW t o 732 MW t o meet the g row ing domestic demand at a to ta l investment cost o f about 
U S $ 1.6 b i l l ion , inc lud ing associated transmission enhancements and other support infrastructure. The 
ma in pro-poor development benefits o f Mo rupu le B w i l l be to (i) prevent a ma jo r economic 
contraction after 2013 when Eskom w i l l stop exports to Botswana, (ii) create a l im i t e d amount o f 
d irec t and ind i rec t employment, and (iii) make possible the ru ra l e lec t r i f ica t ion program to bring 
power to ru ra l areas, where the bulk o f pover ty i s located. 

59. 
Furthermore, in the future, the Government i s exp lo r ing support f o r a p r iva te sector led 
in i t ia t ive t o develop a 1,200 M W green field coa l- f ired powe r p lan t (Mmamabu la Independent Power 
Project - IPP) wh ich w i l l be ma in ly or ien ted fo r export, po ten t ia l ly con t r ibu t ing t o reg iona l energy 
security by supplying powe r in to the Southern A f r i c a Power Poo l . The proposed Mmamabu la IPP 
wou ld be developed using supercr i t ica l bo i le r technology (one o f the f i r s t o f i t s kind in the region), 
that i s the mos t e f f ic ien t f o r a p lan t o f i t s size (600 MW unit size), an impor tan t factor to reduce 
po ten t ia l Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. Wh i le Mmamabu la w o u l d p rov ide some limited d irec t 
and ind irec t employment, i t s ma in pro-poor development bene f i ts w o u l d depend o n the e f fec t ive use 
o f export revenue through pub l ic expenditure. 

60. 
In add i t ion to the need to address e lec tr ic i ty security as a short t e r m risk, and linked t o the 
need fo r reg iona l in tegra t ion and a necessary cond i t ion f o r increased competitiveness, i s the p rov is ion 
o f e f f ic ien t and cost e f fec t ive transport. Because o f i t s geographic loca t ion at the center o f the 
Southern A f r i c a region, Bo tswana i s well pos i t ioned to connect t o a larger reg iona l marke t and cou ld 
become a land-br idge connec t ing South A f r i c a and Nam ib ia t o Zambia, Ango la and Eastern A f r ica . 
Botswana has done w e l l in i t s transport sector expanding i t s paved road coverage f r om just 12 
k i lome ters at independence t o more than 6,000 k i lome ters today, but much more i s needed. The sector 
faces several challenges inc lud ing gradual deterioration o f ex is t ing road networks, the lack o f a 
sustainable ne two rk approach, poor ne two rk management and insu f f ic ien t funds fo r the long- term 
sustainability o f existing investments. 

6 1. 
Furthermore, in infrastructure, water in the long run w i l l be the scarcest commod i ty in 
Botswana. Curren t ly over a hundred v i l lages and settlements su f fer f r om serious water shortages and 
the economy has ou tg rown the current wa ter sector framework . The sector w o u l d bene f i t f rom greater 
c la r i ty in the d iv is ion o f labor and accountability, a more e f f ic ien t t a r i f f regime and be t te r targeted 

15 

subsidies. At present, the sector i s no t f inanc ia l ly v iab le and Government i s embark ing on a ma jo r 
re fo rm e f fo r t fo r the com ing 3 - 5 years with a v i ew t o e l im ina t ing subsidies f o r recurrent costs and 
creating a f inanc ia l ly v iab le sector with clear accountability, increasing the qua l i ty o f service fo r all, 
with subsidies targeted to the poor and to smaller villages. 

Putting regional integration to work for Botswana 

62. 
A j o i n t study by the W o r l d Bank and the Botswana I n s t i t u t e fo r Deve lopmen t Po l icy Ana lys is 
(B IDPA ) o n expor t d ivers i f ica t ion26 also h igh l igh ted the need fo r greater reg iona l in tegra t ion as a 
ma jo r cross-cutting theme fo r Botswana’s economic d ivers i f ica t ion . G iven i t s sma l l size, Bo tswana 
cannot “go it alone”. South A f r i c a i s the p r ima ry destination fo r Botswana’s non-d iamond exports. 
Trade links are impor tan t and Botswana can benefit f r om South A f r ica ’s more developed pr iva te 
sector, marke t know-how, expertise and investment. The harmon iza t ion o f regulations and standards 
requ ired t o move towards a single market cou ld also act as a ma jo r spur t o increased investment and 
trade within the S A C U reg ion and beyond. 

Botswana’s Vision and National Development Plans 

63. 
Bo tswana has managed i t s development agenda through a series o f Na t iona l Deve lopmen t 
Programs (NDPs) built around V is ion 2016, a l o n g t e r m development strategy based o n the country’s 
five na t iona l pr inc ip les : democracy, development, self-reliance, unity and “botho,” a Setswana w o r d 
f o r respect, manners. Unde r the theme ‘ i l c c e l e r a t in Vision 2016 through NDPlO”, the mos t recent 
NDP , has 10 key resu l ts areas and 16 na t iona l goal$. The strategic thrusts o f N D P 10 w i l l be to 
accelerate d ive rs i f ica t ion and competitiveness through know ledge and produc t ive human resources, 
sustainable g row th and environment, enhanced we l l -be ing and social protection, security, transparency 
and governance. ND P 1 0 d i f fe rs f rom prev ious development plans in that it i s the f i r s t results-oriented 
p lan t o be supported by a strengthened mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion system. I t also spans a seven year 
ho r izon t o co inc ide with the t ime frame o f “V is ion 20 16” and t o bracket the end o f the Millennium 
Deve lopmen t Goa l pe r iod in 2015. A t the t ime o f f ina l iz ing this CPS, a Government task force i s 
rev iew ing the po l icy p r io r i t ies o f NDP10 in light o f the g loba l economic crisis. 

64. 
Government, led by the Presidency, has also recen t ly increased i t s focus on imp lemen ta t ion o f 
and l e s s dependency o n Government programs, wh ich - comb ined with the greater emphasis on 
p r io r i t iza t ion and results also triggered by the g loba l economic crisis - indicates a gradual shift in the 
development parad igm towards the need fo r greater competitiveness. Government leadership i s 
already ac t ive ly look ing f o r the ‘silver lining’ beyond the current g loba l economic crisis, in order t o 
pos i t ion the coun try in a way tha t i t can reap max imum benefits. 

III. COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

65. 
Over the course o f i t s partnership with Botswana, the W o r l d Bank G roup (WBG) has f inanced 
a to ta l o f 28 operations since the f i r s t operation was approved in 196428. Ac t iv i t ies focused on 
education, transport, water, and ru ra l development. As Botswana’s economy grew, the coun try turned 
increas ing ly t o i t s ow n resources fo r development financing, and stopped using fo re ign aid2’. W i t h 
lend ing phas ing out, the Bank ’s engagement in Bo tswana shrank, and i t s focus sh i f ted t o limited 
ana ly t ica l and advisory w o r k ma in ly in the f o rm o f f iduc ia ry and comparative ana ly t ic services such as 
an Investment C l ima te Assessment (FY07), a F inanc ia l System S tab i l i ty Assessment (FY07), a Repo r t 

26 Prospects for Export Diversification (2006). B IDPA and the World Bank. 
27 See Annex 1 for details on Botswana’s National Development Program. 
28 Botswana has been a member o f I D A and IBRD since 1968, ICS ID s ince 1970, IFC since 1979 and M IG A since 1990. 
29 Botswana contributed to I D A 11. 

16 

o n the Observance o f Standards and Codes o n Accoun t ing and Auditing (FY07), and an An t i -money 
Launde r ing and Comba t ing F inanc ing o f Terror is ts (AMLKFT) procurement assessment (FY07). A t 
the Government’s request, the WBG’s know ledge program also inc luded an Expo r t D ive rs i f ica t ion 
Study (FY05), prepared j o i n t l y with a loca l think tank, a Pover ty and Social Impac t Ana lys is (FY06), 
and a L ives tock Sector Deve lopmen t Strategy (FY06). This last study was la rge ly funded by the 
Government. I F C has had limited engagement in Botswana to date, while MIGA has n o t had any 
exposure in Botswana. 

66. 
In the past 15 years Bo tswana has had l i t t l e demand fo r Bank G roup services, in part due t o i t s 
strong f isca l pos i t ion and a demonstrated ab i l i ty t o deal e f fec t ive ly with the development challenges 
the coun try faced, but also because Bo tswana has in the past considered IBRD loan terms too 
expensive, argu ing fo r more concessional f inanc ing given the high incidence o f pove r ty and 
HIV/AIDS in the country. The non - f inanc ia l costs o f engagement were also considered excessive, 
especially in a country k n ow n f o r i t s high f iduc ia ry standards. 

67. 
In recent years, Bo tswana has expressed renewed in te res t in Bank G roup services. I n i t i a l l y 
Bo tswana wan ted to benefit f r om the Bank Group’s g loba l know ledge and techn ica l expertise in the 
face o f increas ing ly comp lex developmental challenges such as HIV/AIDS, inequality, and 
competitiveness and economic d ive rs i f ica t ion challenges. With the advent o f new instruments, lowe r 
bo r row ing rates and longer maturities, IBRD f inanc ia l solutions have n o w become attractive to wh ich 
requests fo r f inanc ing o f c r i t ica l infrastructure were added. As has been the case in other M I C settings, 
the onset o f the g loba l economic cr is is has accelerated the desire to deepen and broaden the 
re la t ionsh ip on the par t o f bo th partners. 

68. 
In add i t ion to f inanc ia l investments, wh ich are c r i t ica l if Bo tswana i s t o tack le pove r ty and 
inequa l i ty more e f fec t ive ly and rap id ly , the W o r l d Bank has been asked t o deepen and broaden i t s 
ana ly t ica l know ledge base, w h i c h has been depleted during the l o n g hiatus. Government has also 
requested the Bank t o prepare p o l i c y options in areas it deems c r i t ica l fo r competitiveness and pub l ic 
sector effectiveness, d raw ing on the Bank ’s in terna t iona l experience. Where appropriate, the 
instrument o f choice may be reimbursable techn ica l assistance, as i s already the case f o r the Bank in 
the water sector, and the use o f I F C adv isory services in ter t iary education and the te lecom sector. 
As the partnership with Botswana - as an impor tan t middle income c l ien t in A f r i c a - continues 
69. 
t o mature, the Bank intends t o gradua l ly deepen and broaden the po l icy d ia logue in order t o he lp the 
coun try more e f fec t ive ly address the pove r ty and inequa l i ty challenges and p rov id ing upon reques t the 
full array o f the Bank’s ana ly t ica l and f inanc ing support, while rema in ing selective and demand 
driven. 

70. 
The need to strengthen engagement with Botswana comes at a time when the Bank G roup i s 
revamp ing i t s support to m idd le- income countries through the development o f a set o f flexible, c l ien t- 
responsive instruments and solutions. The strategy se t ou t in this CPS i s designed around pr inc ip les 
d rawn f rom the WBG’s and the A f r i c a Region’s M i d d l e Income Strategies, and builds on lessons f r om 
an Independent Eva lua t ion G roup (IEG) review o f WBG scaled-up support t o the M IC s . 

7 1, 
Even with i t s excellent track record, Bo tswana faces a d i f f i c u l t road ahead. In the midst o f the 
wo rs t g loba l economic down tu rn in decades, i t must keep the economy ou t o f recession, increase 
e f f ic iency by accelerating investments in phys ica l and human resources, imp rove i t s pub l ic sector, 
manage i t s H I V / A I D S pandemic, a l l the wh i le ma in ta in ing i t s repu ta t ion fo r macroeconomic 
prudence. The impac t o f the g loba l economic cr is is i s tak ing place at a time when the po l i t ica l space 
f o r greater dialogue i s widening. The WBG i s w e l l pos i t ioned t o he lp with these challenges ind i rec t ly 
with know ledge and experience, and d i rec t ly with f inanc ia l instruments. 

17 

72. 

Activities presented in this Country Partnership Strategy w i l l also have regional and global 
public goods dimensions, adding to the importance o f this partnership. Energy and transport 
infrastructure investments w i l l support greater regional integration among Southern African countries 
through increased trade and ene rgy sharing. Work in support o f Botswana’s fight against HIV/AIDS 
w i l l have beneficial impacts throughout Southern Africa, as w i l l the work on environmental 
management and energy efficiency. The Botswana CPS i s designed to b r ing bene f i ts not only for 
Botswana, but also for the region, and the world. 

A. PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM 

F o u r c r i t ica l suppo r t areas 

73 . 
Consistent w i th Botswana’s vision and development strategies, the overall strategic objective 
o f the Bank’s engagement i s to help Botswana use a l l o f i t s resources (both non-renewable and 
renewable) to sustain growth and combat poverty and inequality. The WBG’s Botswana program w i l l 
focus on four elements o f the Government’s short and long t e r m agendas. In so doing, the Bank w i l l 
need to f i l l a number o f analytical gaps3’, in order to better understand the apparent contradiction 
between the strong track record in governance, macro-fiscal management and growth vis-a-vis high 
levels o f poverty, inequality and human development indicators, and to continue identifying key 
bottlenecks to economic diversification. 

74. 

To support Botswana’s efforts to manage the fallout from the global economic c r is is , the 
WBG w i l l accelerate and deepen i t s work on public sector management. To help Botswana through i t s 
H IV /A IDS c r is is , the WBG w i l l seek ways to increase the effectiveness o f HIV/AIDS expenditures in 
the country. To help Botswana develop an economy that can compete globally, create jobs and reduce 
dependence on diamonds, the WBG w i l l provide techn ica l input and financing for critical 
infrastructure investments in e l e c t r i c i t y , transportation and water, and support the Government’s 
efforts to improve education outcomes. To help the Government manage pressing environmental 
i s s u e s and maximize the economic benefits o f i t s natural endowments, the WBG w i l l work to improve 
w i ld l i fe management and promote natural resource management and eco-tourism. 

75. 
This CPS comes at a time when the full impact o f the global economic meltdown on the 
Botswana economy i s s t i l l unfolding. Adjustments to the program w i l l therefore have to be made in 
the coming months. De ta i led work programs w i l l be agreed on w i th the Government in annual 
business planning discussions. The broad outlines o f each o f the currently agreed program areas are 
given below. 

I. 

Enhanc ing Pub l ic Sector Effectiveness 

7 6 . 

Botswana faces two related challenges that are driving i t s desire to increase public sector 
e f f i c i e n c y and effectiveness. As the global crisis deepens, Botswana’s public sector-dependent 
economy i s likely to become even more so in the near t e rm . In the medium te rm , as diamond revenues 
decline, the economy must diversify and Botswana’s broad social safety net and extensive public 
s e r v i c e s w i l l have to be supported w i th fewer f i s c a l resources. On both fronts, the WBG’s global 
knowledge base can provide critical support. 

77. 
Public sector effectiveness has emerged as a potential core area for the Bank’s knowledge 
services. In addition to gearing up to deal w i th the fallout from the global financial c r is is , Botswana’s 
public sector i s undergoing a shift in focus in the area o f planning and budgeting. Efforts are underway 

30 S e e Annex B4 for the Bank’s proposed AAA program. 

18 

to implement an increasingly results-based approach to p lann ing and spending to reduce ine f f ic ienc ies 
in pub l ic spending programs, p r io r i t ize spending and prepare fo r the eventual decline in d iamond 
revenues, cos t ly HIV/AIDS and related social assistance programs and the accelerating pace o f 
infrastructure investments. 

78. 
The bulk o f Bank support in this area i s be ing de l ivered through a Pub l ic Expenditure Review 
(PER) that analyzes the ou t look in the medium and longer te rm f o r revenues and expenditures in 
Botswana, assesses planning, budgeting and f inanc ia l management, and reviews social service 
de l ive ry ( inc lud ing soc ia l protection) and infrastructure spending plans. The Bank sees the PER as an 
entry po in t in to a dialogue that leads to a greater understanding o f h o w Botswana can more e f fec t ive ly 
use a l l i t s assets fo r better development outcomes, in par t icu lar the reduc t ion o f pover ty and 
inequa l i ty . 

79. 
To complement the PER work, the Bank i s supporting the strengthening o f M&E capacity o f 
the V i s i o n 2016 Counc i l (IDF grant o f US$175,408), wh ich mon i to rs and evaluates progress towards 
the achievement o f the goals and objectives ou t l ined in V i s i o n 2016, and that o f relevant Line 
M i n i s t r i e s and O f f ices such as the Government Imp lemen ta t ion and Coord ina t ion O f f ice (G ICO) as 
we l l as c i v i l society organizations. Strengthening Statistical Capac i ty fo r Pover ty Ana lys is (multi- 
coun try TFSCB3 ’ grant o f US$260,000), a weak link hamper ing e f fec t ive targe t ing o f Government- 
funded programs i s also underway t o increase the capacity t o compile, analyze and disseminate 
poverty-related statistical in fo rma t ion (poverty re la ted household survey data w i l l be available by 
2010). The M F D P has also requested assistance in the area o f macroeconomic modeling, to imp rove 
forecasting and s imu la t ion capacity and support the ove ra l l ob jec t ive o f strengthening the framework 
fo r medium te rm budgeting. Within the framework o f the PER, the Bank w i l l also p rov ide assistance 
in the area o f debt sustainability analysis and debt strategy and management. 

80. 

Furthermore, in the area o f accounting the Bank i s he lp ing to strengthen Botswana’s Na t iona l 
Accoun tancy B o d y (IDF grant o f US$486,300), and has agreed t o p rov ide a p o l i c y note on the key 
issues invo lved with the in t roduc t ion o f accrual accounting in co l labora t ion with loca l and reg iona l 
bodies. I f requested, the Bank cou ld also p rov ide techn ica l assistance through i t s fee-for-service 
program in the areas o f pub l ic debt management and domestic debt marke t development, in order t o 
imp rove the Government’s effectiveness in these areas. The Reserves Adv iso ry and Management 
Program (RAMP ) i s also available t o Botswana t o support the strengthening o f the country’s capacity 
in asset wea l th management. In addition, capacity building fo r NBFI has been requested by M FD P . 

8 1. 
Botswana’s pub l ic sector management w i l l also bene f i t f r om several reg iona l know ledge 
services, inc lud ing a Southern A f r i c a Reg iona l Trade and In teg ra t ion Study, a Southern A f r i c a 
Reg iona l HIV/AIDS Strategy and a Reg iona l Inves tmen t C l ima te Assessment bu i ld ing on the recen t ly 
completed coun try leve l Investment C l ima te Assessments. 

II. 

Fighting HIV/AIDS and Improving Education Outcomes 

82. 
In recent years, Botswana’s H I V / A I D S program has bene f i ted f r om the support o f 
in terna t iona l donors, inc lud ing the European Commission, the Gates Foundation, Me rck , t h e U .S . 
Government (PEPFAR), G loba l Fund fo r AIDS, Tuberculosis and Ma la r ia (GFATM) and other 
selected b i la tera l sources. However, even the comb ined l e v e l s o f donor and Government spending 
have no t kept pace with the cost and comp lex i ty o f the epidemic response. The Government o f 
Botswana, therefore, reques ted an IBRD opera t ion in an t ic ipa t ion tha t this add i t iona l f inanc ing and the 
techn ica l resources tha t come with it w i l l support a more e f f ic ien t and evidence-based response t o the 
pandemic. 

3 1 Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Bu i ld ing . The grant covers Botswana, Lesotho, Nam ib ia and Swaziland. 

19 

83. 
In response to the Government’s request, the Bank has mob i l ized an IBRD loan fo r 
HIV/AIDS (US$50 m i l l ion , FY09 ) designed t o enhance ove ra l l program e f f ic iency and prevention, an 
area that has received less attention in Government’s heav i ly treatment-oriented program (See B o x 3). 
The IBRD -suppo r ted operation focuses o n a mu l t i-sec tor response, with par t icu lar emphasis o n sectors 
with pipeline IBRD operations (such as energy and transport). The Botswana HIV/AIDS opera t ion 
underpins a more e f fec t ive delivery o f bo th preven t ion programs and basic hea l th services. 

84. 
T o increase concessionality in support o f the fight against HTV /A IDS , the European 
Comm iss ion has comm i t ted t o con tr ibu te US$20 m i l l i o n t o “buy-down” the interest rate o f the 
proposed IBRD loan in wha t marks the first-ever IBRD “buy-down” arrangement in A f r i c a (see also 
B o x 3 fo r details)32. Symptomatic o f the general challenges o f pub l ic sector effectiveness, and despite 
s trong po l i t ica l w i l l repeatedly expressed by senior leadership, it took a re la t ive ly l o n g time t o have a 
p ro jec t ready fo r Boa rd approval in Ju ly 2008, and it has been lagg ing effectiveness since then. Pro jec t 
effectiveness, o r ig ina l ly planned fo r September 2008, has been delayed until M a y 2009. Government 
and N A C A w i l l have t o s ign i f ican t ly speed up in terna l processes if the coun try i s t o successfully 
combat these cross-cutting challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 

85. 
In add i t ion t o the H I V / A I D S project, the Bank i s also p rov id ing ana ly t ica l support in t e r m s o f 
es t ima t ing the impac t o f the g loba l f inanc ia l cr is is o n programs addressing the pandemic, in par t icu lar 
pub l ic treatment programs. The Bank i s also supportive o f reg iona l in i t ia t ives in Southern A f r ica , the 
g loba l epicenter o f the pandemic. This includes the ‘Champions fo r an HTV-free Generation” o f wh ich 
the fo rme r President o f Botswana, Mr. Festus Mogae i s a found ing member, and w h i c h focuses in 
par t icu lar at p rov id ing senior leadership in the area o f prevention. 

86. 
With a v i ew t o enhancing the qua l i ty o f education outcomes, the Bank has recen t ly been 
requested t o p rov ide ana ly t ica l wo rk in the sector. This w o r k w i l l complement w o r k that other partners 
(in par t icu lar the European Comm iss ion and UN IC E F ) have already undertaken. I t comes in response 
t o Government’s recogn i t ion o f the importance o f human cap i ta l fo r competitiveness and 
d ivers i f ica t ion . 

III. Increased Competitiveness - Infrastructure and the Climate for 
Investment and Growth 

87. 
E f f ic ien t , secure and cost e f fec t ive infrastructure as w e l l as an attractive investment c l ima te 
and sound f inanc ia l sector are c r i t ica l elements fo r Botswana’s continued economic g row th and 
increased competitiveness. In recogn i t ion o f the large demand f o r investment and the challenges o f 
de l ive r ing such infrastructure expansion and service improvement, the Government has asked the 
Bank t o p rov ide know ledge and f inanc ia l products t o support in imp rov ing Botswana’s strategic 
infrastructure. 

88. 
In the e lec tr ic i ty sector, in the broader strategic context, Bo tswana i s faced with two m a i n 
challenges: (i) h ow t o achieve e lec t r ic i ty security beyond 20 13 &id (ii) h ow to make responsible use o f 
i t s ex is t ing (coal) and po ten t ia l ( less carbon intensive and renewable) ene rgy resources in a responsible 
manner over the medium t o long t e rm . B o t h challenges are to be me t while max im iz ing the pro-poor 
developmental impac t o f investments in the sector, ensuring the v iab i l i ty o f the sector and w h i l e 
ma in ta in ing a balance between meeting Botswana’s development goals and ache iv ing a l o w carbon 
foo tp r in t to address c l ima te change considerations. Botswana i s faced with considerable challenges in 
this regard, and i s look ing fo r development partners, inc lud ing the WBG t o assist in this e f fo r t . 

3 2 W h i l e these resources come out o f the EC’s country allocation for Botswana, the EC has indicated that they had not 
previously been programmed and would now become available to Botswana through a program supported by an IBRD loan.

Box 3: Innovative Financing Partnership fo r Strengthening H IV /A IDS Prevention Efforts 

Botswana’s first case o f H I V infection was diagnosed in 1985 . Today, Botswana i s one o f the countries in the 
southern Africa region most impacted by H IV /A IDS epidemic. W i th a national adult prevalence ra te that i s 
nearly 24 percent - the second highest in the world - an estimated 283,000 Batswana adults, many in their prime 
o f their lives, are suffering from the debilitating disease. 

Recognizing that Botswana’s status as a middle income country precludes i t from receiving concessional 
financing, the World Bank, in cooperation w i th the European Commission, developed an innovative financing 
instrument specifically tailored to the coun try ’s needs. 

The US$50 m i l l ion Botswana National H IV /A IDS Prevention Support Project (BNAPS) i s designed to assist 
the Government o f Botswana in increasing the coverage, efficiency, and sustainability o f H IV /A IDS 
interventions, and enabling i t to make the transition from an “emergency” response to a broader, more strategic, 
and sustainable approach. 

The project’s innovative “buy down” design allows a grant donor, in this case the European Commission, to

MIGA w i l l also support the country’s competitiveness agenda through the p rov is ion o f 
po l i t ica l risk insurance, i f and when needed by fo re ign investors active in the coun try . T o date few 
investors have sought such support f r om MIGA, p r ima r i ly due t o the market’s percep t ion o f l o w 
po l i t ica l risk. However, this may change with the impac t o f the f inanc ia l crisis, especially as 
commerc ia l lenders to projects review their risk appetite. Specifically, MIGA’s insurance can be used 
as a cred i t enhancement t o o l ( to imp rove lending t e rm s and conditions o f p r iva te projects) in middle 
income countries like Botswana. In this regard, MIGA w i l l continue to w o r k c lose ly with the Bank

116. 
Botswana’s strong economic performance and i t ’ s m idd le- income status have resulted in donors 
gradua l ly leav ing the country. Excep t in the area o f HTV /A IDS , wh ich bene f i ts f r om strong support by 
o f f i c i a l donors and foundations, no t many donors are present o r active today. O f f i c i a l Deve lopmen t 
Assistance (ODA ) f e l l f r om US$148 m i l l i o n in 1990 t o a mere US$28 m i l l i o n in 2003 but has since been 
o n an upward trend reaching US$104 m i l l ion , o r 1.0 percent o f GNI in 2007, re f lec t ing the increased 
needs brough t o n by the HIV/AIDS situation. Indeed, over 85 percent o f ODA i s directed t o the Hea l th 
& Popu la t ion sector. The three largest o f f ic ia l donors a re the U n i t e d States fo l lowed by the European 
Comm iss ion and Japan. 

1 17. As par t o f the scaling-up o f Bank G roup engagement in Botswana, Bank teams have reached ou t 
to other donors active in Bo tswana t o forge strategic partnerships and t o share know ledge . The European 
Comm iss ion in par t icu lar has emerged as an impor tan t and supportive partner as demonstrated by the 
“IBRD buy-down” arrangement o f the HN/AIDS pro jec t . O F I D i s planning t o para l le l finance the 
Integrated Transport pro jec t and the AfDB fo r the Mo rupu le B pro jec t .

Using i t s conven ing power, the Bank w i l l also explore h o w Bo tswana may be able to be t te r 
harness i t s pos i t ive in terna t iona l repu ta t ion t o further stimulate p r iva te sector i n t e r e s t and investment. 
Bo tswana i s also ac t ive ly reach ing ou t t o f e l l ow middle income countries f o r South - South learning. In 
the course o f the CPS the Bank w i l l iden t i fy po ten t ia l areas and countries where i t can p lay a ro le as an

119. 
Dono r coord ina t ion in recent years in Botswana has no t been characteristic g iven that several 
development partners had reduced i t s presence as the coun try j o i n e d the ranks o f the M IC s . Government 
has made e f for ts t o bring the partners together in a “Donor Forum” in l ine with Paris and Acc ra 
Declarations, but this i s s t i l l a recent ac t iv i ty that may be bolstered as the Government re f ines i t s strategy 
o f wha t they wan t ro le they assign t o each development partner. The Governmen t i s firmly in the 
coord ina t ion driver’s seat.

121. 
Credit Risk. Bo tswana i s a we l l -pe r fo rm ing upper m idd le- income country, and has the best 
sovereign ra t ing in A f r ica . Bo tswana maintains a sovereign ra t ing f r om the commerc ia l agencies that i s 
five notches above investment grade: s im i la r ly rated sovereigns inc lude Ch i le , Ko rea and Poland. 
D e s p i t e the good track record o f prudent economic policies, Botswana’s ove ra l l creditworthiness i s 
constrained by i t s diamond-dependent na r row economic base and associated problems w h i c h have 
become more apparent with the onset o f the g loba l economic cr is is in recent months. 

122. 
The g loba l economic down tu rn has exacerbated downside risks f o r Botswana, as the severe 
contraction o f the d iamond industry may r e s u l t in substantial imbalances in i t s f isca l and external 
accounts. Unlike mos t other emerg ing markets, Botswana i s a net external creditor, and hence has no t 
been dependent on external financing, but the balances may change under a po ten t ia l ly long - l ived g loba l 
recession. Add i t iona l ly , w h i l e the f inanc ia l sector i s s t i l l fa i r ly robust, with ample liquidity and high 
cap i ta l iza t ion and p ro f i tab i l i ty , the bank ing system never the less remains vulnerable to the effects o f a 
protracted g loba l economic down tu rn on d iamond export revenues, wh ich i s the m a i n d irec t and ind irec t 
income source f o r a great number o f borrowers. The l ike l ihood o f rap id ly de ter iora t ing pub l ic finances 

28 

and the po ten t ia l ly lengthy down turn in the d iamond industry led Standard and Poor to rev ise , in February 
2009, Botswana’s ra t ing ou t look t o negative f r om positive; subsequently Moody ’s also changed i t s ratings 
outlook, f r om pos i t ive t o stable. IBRD exposure t o Bo tswana i s curren t ly nonexistent, but this CPS, 
wh ich i s designed t o he lp address Botswana’s ma jo r challenges, i s expected to bring exposure t o 
unprecedented levels in t e rm s o f the size o f i t s economy and popu la t ion . 

123. 
The p lanned large e lec tr ic i ty investments (Morupu le B) are l i k e l y to represent a s ign i f ican t 
por t ion , close to 20 percent, o f pub l ic capital spending over the com ing 4-5 years. W h i l e the proposed 
investments are large, they are affordable f rom a debt perspective. Beyond the country’s ex treme ly l o w 
pub l ic external debt levels, debt sustainability analyses ind ica te tha t there i s l i t t l e risk o f debt d is t ress in 
Bo tswana under a w ide var ie ty o f stress scenarios. One po ten t ia l concern i s the impac t o n the rea l 
exchange rate.37 However , as it i s expected that the bulk o f expenditures w i l l finance imports, this w i l l 
limit the exchange rate impact. The development o f Mo rupu le B w i l l a f fec t the current account balance 
as a resu l t o f the large associated projected impor ts . 

124. Reputational Risk. The Bank Group’s engagement in coal-to-power developments i s likely t o 
attract a t ten t ion and c r i t ic ism f r om those concerned with c l ima te change and f r om those who see a risk o f 
a worsen ing the HIV/AIDS s i tua t ion in the pro jec t area through the imm ig ra t ion o f people f r om within 
and outside o f Bo tswana in search o f jobs . In addition, a med ia a l lega t ion with regard to corrup t ion during 
the ‘Engineering, Procurement and Construction’ (EPC) contract award process fo r Mo rupu le B i s

Presidency. Government i s aware that on ly satisfactory reso lu t ion o f this case w o u l d a l low the WBG t o 
p rov ide f inanc ia l support. 

125. 
T o m i t iga te these risks, the Government and the Bank G roup need t o communicate e f fec t ive ly the 
na t iona l and reg iona l benefits o f this engagement and the e f for ts be ing made to use the cleanest possible 
technology, the responsible development o f coa l in l ine with in terna t iona l agreements and best practices 
and high standards fo r fiduciary, env ironmen ta l and social safeguards. A communications strategy i s in 
place and the Bank team i s also suppor t ing the Government in the development o f i t s ow n 
communications strategy and capacity (see B o x 4). Regard ing HIV/AIDS risks, specific programs in the 
locales o f proposed powe r plants w i l l be targeted t o con ta in and preven t new H I V / A I D S cases. 

Box 4: Strategic Communications for Development Results 

The Government o f Botswana i s f i l l y aware o f the importance o f strategic communications for development and 
has taken significant steps in the past few years to boost i t s communication capacity and effectiveness and 
increase openness in the governing process. I t plans to increase proactive communications with stakeholders 
about issues critical t o the country’s well-being - such as inequality and unemployment; the current electricity 
c r is is and the Government’s response against an overall backdrop o f a need for infrastructure investment and 
upgrade; economic growth and economic diversification; the fight against H IV /A IDS ; managing the environment 
and promoting tourism; and growing the private sector. A t a broad level, the World Bank plans to assist the 
Government’s communications efforts w i th capacity building o f communications staff within the M i n i s t r i e s and 
helping the Government develop mechanisms through which it can systematically l i s t e n to the needs, concerns 
and aspirations o f stakeholders and create platforms for dialogue around critical public policies. The Bank w i l l 
also support Government efforts in each o f the key strategic elements o f Infrastructure, H IV /A IDS , and 
Knowledge Products and Services. I t w i l l equally work to ensure that the World Bank ’s work in these areas i s 
shared broadly w i th a l l stakeholders and opportunities a re created t o expand dialogue and discussion w i th in the 
country around these themes. 

3 7 Here the case o f M o z a l aluminium smelter in Mozambique, built to produce aluminium for export, i s illustrative. M o z a l I 
and I1 amounted to about $2 billion in investment in a national economy o f $6 billion, larger in relative terms than the 
proposed Morupule B investments in Botswana (but similar to the combination o f Morupule B and Mmamabula, the latter 
expected to be privately financed). The investments were executed at a faster pace than i s being proposed in the Botswana 
case. Despite this, there was l i t t l e impact seen on the exchange rate as most o f the resources financed imports.

126. 
Commitment Risk. W h i l e the Government has expressed interest in a closer partnership with 
the Bank Group, there i s a risk that it may decide n o t to fo l low - th rough o n some o f the proposed 
ac t iv i t ies . W h i l e this strategy i s designed t o be flexible t o adjust to the Government’s needs, a 
s ign i f ican t shift in scope o r focus cou ld dera i l imp lemen ta t ion . T o m i t iga te this risk, the Bank w i l l 
ma in ta in a close dialogue with the Government t o anticipate possible changes and w i l l continue t o 
demonstrate strong value-added in areas o f partnership. The opening o f a Coun t ry O f f i c e in Gaborone 
w o u l d also deepen the dialogue in the partnership. 

127. 
Implementation Risk. Government does n o t have recent experience in prepar ing and 
implementing Bank operations, beyond the recen t ly s igned H I V / A I D S pro jec t . Imp lemen ta t ion 
capacity i s o f ten low , although techn ica l capacity i s high. This cou ld lead to delays in pro jec t 
preparation and imp lemen ta t ion as well as concerns over the non- f inanc ia l cost o f do ing business with 
t h e Bank . This risk i s h i g h in the ene rgy sector. T o m i t iga te this risk, opening a Coun t ry O f f i c e in

Annex 1: BOTSWANA’S DEVELOPMENT VISION AND STRATEGIC PLANS 

128. 
In 1996 when Bo tswana celebrated 30 years o f independence, the na t ion saw it fit to examine i t s past 
performance and t o define a better fu ture in wh ich “Prosperity Fo r All” w i l l be achieved by 2016, when the 
Batswana w i l l be celebrating 50 years o f their independence. “V is ion 2016” i s a l o n g t e r m development 
strategy based on Botswana’s five na t iona l pr inc ip les : democracy, development, self-reliance, unity and 
 both^^^. I t seeks t o p rope l the country’s socio economic and po l i t ica l development in to tha t o f a “competitive, 
winning and prosperous na t ion” through seven strategic pillars that are c lose ly a l igned with MDGs3’. V is ion 
20 16 prov ides the framework fo r the six-year Na t iona l Deve lopmen t Plans (with the excep t ion o f NDP10 ) 
w h i c h lay ou t Government’s medium t e r m development strategy and po l icy . The ove r r id ing ob jec t ive o f the 
NDPs i s to ensure that resources are used e f fec t ive ly to achieve na t iona l pr ior i t ies . The p lann ing system in 
Bo tswana i s re la t ive ly strong and we l l - func t ion ing with par t icu lar emphasis g iven t o a broad-based consultative 
system. 

129. 
In April 2003, Bo tswana launched the N D P 9 fo r 2003-2008, with the theme “Towards Realizations of 
Vision 201 6, sustainable and diversiJied development through competitiveness in g loba l markets” . The ma in 
p o l i c y goa l o f N D P 9 i s t o increase d ive rs i f ica t ion and t o foster emp loymen t in labor- in tens ive industries. I t also 
puts emphasis on development o f human resources ( inc lud ing the fight against H IV /A IDS ) , p r iva t iza t ion and 
labor marke t reforms. A rev iew o f the economic performance o f N D P 9 revealed tha t “g row th was slower than 
p lanned in the first h a l f o f NDP9 , and the g row th rate was declining.” The Government had fa l len short o f 
meeting se t targets on d ive rs i f ica t ion and emp loymen t creation. The imp lemen ta t ion o f Government’s plans has 
suffered f r om capacity and s k i l l s constraints, wh ich in turn has led to delays. Energy constraints also contributed 
t o delays in imp lemen t ing the Government’s ru ra l e lec tr i f ica t ion program. N D P 10 i s expected t o carry fo rwa rd 
the unrealized targets in to the fu tu re . 

130. 
The goals o f V i s i o n 20 16 have been cascaded down in to N D P 10 resulting in 10 key results areas and 16 
na t iona l goals. The strategic t h r u s t s o f N D P 1 0 w i l l be t o accelerate competitiveness through know ledge and 
produc t ive human resources, sustainable g row th and environment, enhanced well-being and social protection, 
security, transparency and governance. Unde r the theme “Acce lerat ing Vision 2016 through NDPlO ”, this 
development p lan i s d i f fe ren t f rom prev ious development plans since i t i s the first results-oriented p lan wh ich 
w i l l be supported by a strengthened mon i to r ing and evaluation system (M&E) and i t spans a seven year ho r izon 
to co inc ide with the t ime frame o f “V is ion 201 6” and overlap the assessment o f the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t 
Goals (MDGs) in 20 15. The consultative process was gu ided by mu l t i-sec tora l reference groups comprised o f 
Government o f f ic ia ls , p r iva te sector, trade un ions and NGOs. 

13 1. Desp i te weaknesses in t e r m s o f strategic focus, ND P 1 0 i s an adequate p lann ing instrument and the basis 
fo r the strategic interventions as envisaged under the CPS in H I V / A ID S , in fras truc ture (transport, energy, water) 
and c l ien t - driven know ledge services. 

132. 
T o address the pove r ty situation, the Government has also put in place a Na t iona l Pover ty Reduc t ion 
Strategy (NPRS) focused on reduc ing pove r ty through broad-based growth, enhancing human cap i ta l o f the 
poor, creation o f cost-effective pro-poor soc ia l safety nets, an e f fec t ive response t o HIV/AIDS, and 
strengthening ins t i tu t ions fo r the poor . The imp lemen ta t ion o f the NPRS i s vested in the Ru ra l Deve lopmen t 
Counc i l (RDC), underlining the s trong ly r u r a l nexus o f pover ty . Wh i le the Government has pursued a number o f 
pover ty a l lev ia t ing measures, a ma jo r weakness remains the lack o f exp l ic i t pover ty reduc t ion links in po l ic ies 
and programs o f the ND P . The imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRS also s u f f e r s f r om lack o f data needed fo r better 
targe t ing and an insu f f ic ien t mon i to r ing and evaluation system.

Annex 2 : HIV/AIDS IN BOTSWANA 

133. 
Botswana’s f i r s t case o f H IV in fec t ion was diagnosed in 1985. Today, the coun try faces 
the second mos t severe H I V / A I D S epidemic in the w o r l d (after Swaziland). I t i s estimated that in 
2008, 283,000 adults were living with W / A I D S in Bo tswana (NACA , 2008). T h i s indicates a 
na t iona l adu l t (1 5-49 years) prevalence o f nearly 25 percent4’. Rising mo r ta l i ty rates have 
para l le led the ma tu r ing epidemic over the past decade. A IDS -a t t r ibu ted mo r ta l i ty in Botswana 
increased f r om 4 percent t o 27 percent o f a l l reported deaths be tween 1992 and 2003. The 
p r inc ipa l mode o f epidemic transmission in Botswana i s heterosexual. Key factors fue l ing the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic inc lude the high incidence o f multiple concurrent sexual partners and 
intergenerational sexual relationships, unprotected sex, the vu lne rab i l i ty o f women, persistent 
inequa l i ty and poverty, and high l e v e l s o f popu la t ion mob i l i ty , inc lud ing cross-border challenges. 

134. 
The pandemic we ighs heav i ly o n society, the economy, fam i l ies and the fiscus. There are 
already 13 1,000 AIDS orphans in Botswana. By 2004, the Cen tra l Statistics O f f i c e estimates that 
l i f e expectancy had decreased t o 56 years (2007). (It i s estimated tha t l i f e expectancy wou ld have 
increased t o 70 years by 2000, in the absence o f the HIVIAIDS pandemic). As estimated by the 
Bo tswana Cen tra l Statistics O f f ice (CSO), W / A I D S drama t ica l ly reduced l i f e expectancy at 
birth by 10 years ( f rom 65.3 t o 55.6 years) within a decade (1991-2001). HIV/AIDS has distorted 
the popu la t ion structure o f Botswana. The magnitude o f the ep idem ic tripled crude mo r ta l i ty 
rates (deaths per 100,000) in Bo tswana between1991-2003. A l though d i f fe ren t demographic 
p ro jec t ion models va ry in p red ic t ing the specific degree o f epidemic impact, a l l concurs that the 
popu la t ion structure o f Botswana w i l l be rad ica l ly altered, given unprecedented death rates 
among young adults across a l l social strata over the past two decades. T rad i t iona l soc ia l safety 
ne ts are stretched t o the ir limits as a smaller number o f adults w i l l have t o support larger numbers 
o f the young and e lde r ly and the sick. 

135. 
Key hea l th indicators a re revers ing - in fan t mo r ta l i ty i s up f r om 45 (per 1,000 births) in 
1990 to 56 in 2006. Tuberculosis (TB) continues t o pose a heavy burden in Botswana. The 
number o f new TB cases per year has increased 21 1 percent since 1990. In 2008, there were an 
estimated 551 new TB cases per 100,000 popu la t ion . The TB treatment (D i rec t ly Observed 
Therapy - DOTS ) coverage and DOTS detection rates are estimated at 70 percent and 80 percent, 
respectively. An estimated 54 percent o f new TB patients are W - p o s i t i v e and 38 percent o f 
AIDS deaths are due to TB, emphasizing the magnitude o f the challenge posed by this dua l 
epidemic. In addition, in January 2008, Botswana hea l th authorities reported their f i r s t k n ow n 
cases o f v i r tua l ly untreatable, extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a highly 
contagious strain f i r s t detected in the Southern A f r ican reg ion . This poses a risk no t just to 
Botswana, but to the entire reg ion o f Southern A f r ica , the wo r ld ’s epicenter o f the pandemic. 

136. 
Government finances over 80 percent o f the na t iona l HIV/AIDS program. The na t iona l 
H I V / A I D S program, coordinated by the Na t iona l AIDS Coord ina t ing Agency (NACA) , has been 
very e f fec t ive in treatment. Botswana was the f i r s t A f r ican coun try t o p rov ide no-cost, 
an t i re t rov i ra l (ARV) therapy, cap i ta l iz ing on bo th i t s strong hea l th system and strong 
Government comm i tmen t to rap id ly expand access to these c r i t ica l services. Today, an estimated 
90 percent o f ind iv idua ls with advanced HIV in fec t ion are rece iv ing an t i re t rov i ra l therapy. The 
cost o f this disease-specific Government a l loca t ion has increased drama t ica l ly f r om US$69.8 
m i l l i o n in 2000-200 1 , t o US$130 m i l l i o n in 2005. The specter o f p rov id ing second-line ARV

drugs t o an increasing number o f HIV pos i t ive patients looms in the f isca l horizon, especially 
because these drugs cost 13 times more than the f i r s t - l i n e drugs41. An economic analysis o f 
Botswana's f inanc ing and de l ivery o f H I V / A I D S prevention, treatment and social support 
prepared by the W o r l d Bank found tha t despite high leve ls o f o w n and fo re ign resources allocated 
to the fight against HIV/AIDS, Bo tswana faces an increasing funding de f ic i t (up t o US$300 
m i l l i o n by 2009). Since i t w i l l be d i f f i c u l t t o find the f isca l space fo r higher budget outlays in this 
area w i thou t c rowd ing ou t other impor tan t development spending, the need t o increase e f f ic iency 
and effectiveness o f spending i s n o w even greater. A renewed emphasis o n preven t ion i s ca l led 
for, inc lud ing preven t ion o f disinhibiting sexual behav ior o f HIV pos i t ive persons w h o are 
already o n ARV treatment. 

Graph 1: New adult H I V infections and AIDS deaths 

137. Graph 1 (above) illustrates the dynamics o f the epidemic over the past 25 years. The 
number o f new in fec t ions rose rap id ly during the ear ly 199Os, peak ing in the mid-1990s. The 
number o f AIDS deaths started to g row rap id ly about 10 years subsequent to this r i s e in new 
infections, peak ing in 2003, just before the emergency expansion o f the na t iona l AIDS treatment 
program. By 2003, the number o f new infections, with respect to the adu l t popu la t ion o f 
Botswana, was approximately equal t o the number o f AIDS deaths. The successful expansion o f 
the treatment program has reduced the number o f AIDS deaths by ha l f . Acco rd ing t o recent 
estimates, the na t iona l treatment program had averted about 52,000 adults' deaths by end-2007. 
The mos t s ign i f ican t challenge fo r the na t iona l response t o HIV/AIDS, currently, i s t o strengthen 
e f for ts to reduce the number o f new in fec t ions s t i l l occurr ing each year. During 2008, i t i s 
pro jec ted that there were 14,100 new adu l t in fec t ions and 690 new c h i l d in fec t ions in Botswana. 
The Preven t ion o f Mo the r T o C h i l d Transmission Program (PMCTP) has demonstrated 
s ign i f ican t success in he lp ing t o reduce c h i l d in fec t ions . PMC T P increased i t s coverage f r om 37 
percent o f women (2003) who took prophy lax is t o reduce transmission t o the unbo rn c h i l d t o 89 
percent in 2007 (NDP lO dra f t report). I t i s estimated tha t the program has resulted in a decline in 
transmission to 4 percent, wh ich i s a Western Eu ropeadNo r th Amer ican standard. 

4 1 Experience from places where ARV has long been widely available shows that after a few years, the "first-line" o f 
ARV no longer works for an increasing number o f patients due to drug resistance, and these patients must then switch 
to "second-line" drugs.

assist in the financing o f individual 
projects 

D. Taxes and Duties. Are there any 

taxes and duties that the Bank would 
not finance? 

Yes 

None 

RemarksiExplanation 
W h i l e continuing to emphasize borrower commitment and 
ownership o f ind iv idua l projects, the Bank would retain the 
option o f financing up to 100 percent o f project costs. 
However, specific arrangements would be determined for 
individual projects, taking in to account project specific 
considerations. In practice, the Bank’s financing share in 
many projects i s expected to be l e s s than 100 percent given 
Government contribution and other donor participation. 

N o country-level l im i t on Bank financing o f recurren t costs 
i s proposed. On a project by project basis, the Bank may 
finance recurrent costs after ca re fu l consideration o f the 
sustainability o f project achievements; and imp l ied future 
budgetary outlays, w i th in 
the overall context o f 
Botswana’s aggregate fiscal position and prospects. 
The requirements for local cost financing are met. The 
Bank can finance local costs in any proportions required by 
ind iv idua l projects. 

The Bank may finance the costs o f taxes and duties 
associated w i th project expenditures. N o taxes and duties 
have been 
identified as excessive, unreasonable or 
discriminatory. A t the project level, the Bank wou ld 
examine whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively 
h igh share o f project cost.

BOTSWANA: COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS 

The following provides additional information on the country financing parameters for Botswana 
established pursuant to OP/BP 6.00, Bank Financing. 

Introduction: Botswana has enjoyed several decades o f sustained rea l GDP per capita growth, 
which was the r e s u l t o f its prudent management o f mineral wealth s ince the 1970s. This has 
allowed the Government to build up savings and to invest i n physical and human in fras truc ture 
needed for development. Furthermore, the Government has one o f the most meritocratic, 
transparent and e f f i c i e n t bureaucracy in Africa. However, poverty level remains high; prevalence 
o f HIV/AIDS i s threatening the country’s productive capacity as well as public finances; while 
unemployment i s also stubbornly high at around 18 percent. The Government’s development 
program aims to address these challenges by continuing to invest in human development as well 
as attempting to diversify t h e economy through increased competitiveness. 

A. 

Cost Shar ing: Government ownership o f projects i s strong. The political leadership has 
shown a strong commitment to its development program, which i s entirely homegrown as 
articulated in its Vision 2016 and the latest National Development Plan (NDP), which builds on 
Vision 2016 and focuses on economic diversification away from mineral production, employment 
creation and poverty alleviation. Botswana has a comprehensive and well functioning budget 
system, with f i s c a l and development policy and management being anchored in NDPs which in 
many respects, i s a textbook example o f an MTEF: there i s a close link between the cen tra l 
Government’s annual budgets and the NDP and in each year, capital expenditure allocations in 
the budget are derived directly from the investment program in the plan. 

Government ownership i s key and w i l l continue to be emphasized. The Bank’s financing share in 
individual projects would be determined in a manner which supports Government ownership o f 
projects, and on that basis counterpart funding by Government w i l l generally be expected in a l l 
projects. And in view o f the fac t that HIV/AIDS w i l l increasingly exert pressure on public 
finances, enhanced flexibility i s warranted for some projects. Therefore, while continuing to 
emphasize client commitment and ownership o f individual projects, the Bank would re ta in the 
option o f financing up to 100 percent o f project costs. 

B. Recurrent Costs: The authorities in Botswana pursue a prudent macroeconomic policy which 
can be seen from the long period o f strong and sustained per capita growth as well as low public 
debt ( less than 10 percent o f GDP). Strong diamond exports have also meant strong current 
account surpluses, which have enabled large build up reserves (2 years worth o f imports) as well 
as supporting the Government’s ambitious development agenda. The Government o f Botswana 
aims to dedicate 30 percent o f it budget to development -although this has not been achieved in 
recent years- and finances around 85 percent o f it within i t s budget (donors and loans make up the 
rest) resources and has the desire to allocate more o f the national resources for investment in 
pursuit o f sustainable growth and economic diversification. The Government’s commitment to its 
development agenda, coupled with i t s sound public f inanc ia l management track record indicates 
that the Government w i l l have no difficulties financing recurrent costs after the Bank exits. 

40 

Annex 4 

G iven Botswana’s exemplary track record o f pub l ic finance management, and i t s comm i tmen t t o 
i t s development agenda, we envisage no prob lem fo r the Government t o finance recurrent costs 
after Bank ex i ts . N o coun try- leve l limit on Bank f inanc ing o f recurrent costs i s proposed. O n a 
pro jec t by pro jec t basis, the Bank may finance recurrent costs after care fu l consideration o f the 
sustainability o f pro jec t achievements; and imp l ied f u t u r e budgetary outlays, within the ove ra l l 
context o f Botswana’s aggregate f isca l pos i t ion and prospects. 

C. Local Cost Financing: F inanc ing requirements fo r the country’s development program 
exceed the pub l ic sector’s o w n resources (e.g., f r om taxa t ion and other revenues) and expected 
domestic bo r row ing . Desp i te Botswana’s excellent track reco rd in economic management, i t 
faces serious challenges t o development and sustainable growth, wh ich in turn are l i k e l y t o put 
pressure o n pub l ic finances go ing forward : HTV /A IDS and anticipated dec l ine in d iamond 
produc t ion . Therefore, the an t ic ipa ted loss o f d iamond revenue, coup led with increasing hea l th 
costs fo r H I V / A I D S related spending as we l l as loss o f produc t ive human cap i ta l makes the case 
fo r supporting Botswana’s development program warranted. 

The loca l cost component o f envisaged investment lend ing i s expected t o be s ign i f ican t . 
Therefore, the f inanc ing o f fo re ign expenditures alone w o u l d n o t enable the Bank t o assist in the 
f inanc ing o f ind iv idua l projects. The tw o requirements fo r Bank f inanc ing o f loca l costs are met, 
and the Bank may finance loca l and fo re ign costs in the p ropo r t ion requ ired fo r ind iv idua l 
projects. 

D. 

Taxes and Duties Financing: Taxes and duties have been assessed as reasonable and the 
Bank may therefore finance taxes and duties associated with pro jec t expenditures. At the pro jec t 
level, the Bank w o u l d consider whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively h i g h share o f 
projects. Changes in tax and customs and/or related exemptions cou ld tr igger a rev iew o f this 
parameter. M a j o r taxes and duties are summarized be low .
