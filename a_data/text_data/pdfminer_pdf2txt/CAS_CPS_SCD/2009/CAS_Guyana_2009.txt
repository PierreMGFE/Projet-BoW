EXECUTIVE S U M M A R Y 

1. 
Guyana has made significant headway in lay ing the 
foundations for 
macroeconomic stability and higher pro-poor growth, but challenges remain. A f t e r 
years o f vo la t i l i ty , GDP g row th rebounded in 2006-2007, reaching 5.1 percent and 5.4 
percent respectively, underpinned by boom ing investment and favorable terms o f trade 
changes. Moderate and extreme pover ty rates declined f r om 43.2 percent and 28.7 percent in 
1992 to 36.1 percent and 18.6 percent in 2006, respectively, and at present, poverty-related 
spending continues to exceed 20 percent o f GDP. S ign i f ican t progress has been made on 
MDG targets that address the empowerment o f women as w e l l as hunger and primary 
education, par t icu lar ly to l o w income households. 

2. 
Guyana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper focuses on accelerating and 
sustaining economic growth through enhanced competitiveness and social development. 
I t i s comm i t ted to addressing the various challenges that constrain growth: (i) pro tec t ing the 
environment and managing natural resources with simultaneous sustainable social and 
economic development; (ii) managing the sea leve l r ise and changes in ra in fa l l patterns 
through disaster m i t iga t ion ; (iii) imp rov ing infrastructure to promote g row th and pr iva te 
sector development; (iv) imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f education; (v) imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f 
health services wh ich i s hampered by the emigration o f sk i l led hea l th personnel; (vi) 
deepening governance and modernizing the state, wh i le building on progress already made; 
and (vii) preventing cr ime and enhancing citizen’s security. 

3. 
An additional challenge that Guyana now faces i s i t s vu lnerab i l ity to the global 
cr is is . Weakened commod i ty exports (sugar, rice, timber, bauxite, and gold), lowe r workers’ 
remittances and reduced fore ign direct investment are l i k e l y to contribute to slower economic 
g row th in 2009 and 2010. 

4. 
Wh i le the last Coun t ry Assistance Strategy correctly identified the country’s 
challenges, it was overambitious in scope and had m ixed results, with t h e clear exception 
o f education where good outcomes (e.g. reaching un iversa l primary school comp le t ion with 
assistance f r om Education Fo r A l l-Fas t Track In i t ia t ive) were achieved. 

5. 
This new CA S i s both demand-driven and h igh ly selective. 
In add i t ion to 
expressed demand by the authorities, i t s design i s framed by four factors: (i) the sma l l IDA 
a l loca t ion ( U S 8 . 2 m i l l ion ) and i t s imp l ica t ions fo r the choice o f instruments; (ii) the need to 
stay engaged and rema in relevant in areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage; (iii) 
a focus on areas where the Bank’s support cou ld s ign i f ican t ly leverage additional financing; 
and (iv) the need to rema in realistic with regards to the selection o f outcomes to be achieved. 

6. 
The Bank w i l l assist Guyana in addressing i t s development challenges through a new 
Coun try Assistance Strategy with two ma in pillars: (i) strengthening environmental 
resilience and sustainability ; and (ii) imp rov ing education qua l ity and social safety nets. 
7. 
T h e C A S seeks to achieve its outcomes through a m i x o f instruments tha t re ly 
heavily on technical assistance and ana lyt ica l work, wh ich complement a l im i ted lend ing 
envelope, and that leverage other donors’ support. In b o t h lend ing and AAA, the CAS w i l l 
a l low the Bank to be in a pos i t ion to take advantage o f opportunities as they arise, and thus 
incorporates reserves fo r “seed money” to enable the Bank to explore areas where i t can 

11 

p rov ide analytical or project preparation activities that cou ld leverage additional donor 
financing. 

8 . 

Based o n lessons o f experience in imp lemen t ing the last CAS and f r om other donor 
experiences, and because o f the fact that CAS implementation and achievement o f expected 
outcomes wou ld depend s ign i f ican t ly on the success o f par tner ing with and leveraging other 
donors’ funds, the r i s k s associated w i t h this modest program are characterized as high. 
However, the Bank recognizes the po ten t ia l and high rewards f r om supporting the coun try in 
addressing some o f the constraints to faster g row th and pover ty reduction. 

9 . 
The r i s k s to t h e C A S w i l l be monitored, and m i t iga t ion measures w i l l be re-evaluated 
regularly, throughout the C A S period, inc lud ing : po l icy ownership and commitment; 
implementation capacity; fiduciary, accountability and governance risks; insu f f ic ien t donor 
coordination; and exogenous r i s k s (such as p r ice vo la t i l i ty and climate change); and po l i t ica l 
ins tab i l i ty . 

10. 

In i t s discussion, the Boa rd may wish to consider the fo l low ing : 

(i) G iven the Bank’s l im i ted f inanc ing in Guyana, does the proposed strategy 
represent t h e most appropriate ro le the Bank can pe r fo rm to support the 
Government’s strategy? 
Does the Coun try Assistance Strategy adequately identify the r i s k s to the 
successful implementation o f the Bank program? 

(ii)

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. 
Guyana i s situated in the No r the rn part o f South America, border ing the N o r t h 
A t lan t ic Ocean, and w i t h Suriname, Venezuela and B raz i l as neighbors. 
I t i s the third 
smallest country in South Amer ica after Suriname and Uruguay, and has a popu la t ion o f less 
than a m i l l ion ’ . I t i s also the third poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, after H a i t i 
and Nicaragua’. I t i s well endowed with natural resources inc lud ing baux i te and gold, fer t i le 
agricultural lands, and large trop ica l forests. W i t h 80 percent o f the coun try covered by 
forests, Guyana has one o f the wor ld ’s highest forest cover per capita ratios. N i n e t y percent 
o f the inhabitants l i v e on t h e narrow coastal plain, where popu la t ion density i s more than 115 
persons per square kilometer. Acco rd ing to the 2002 census, the compos i t ion popu la t ion i s 
composed of: Indo-Guyanese (43.5 percent); Afro-Guyanese (30.2 percent); M i x e d Heritage 
(17.6 percent); Amerindian (9.2 percent); and Portuguese and Chinese ( e 1 percent). 

2. 
A f te r over 25 years o f authoritarian rule, democratic elections were he ld in 1992. 
Since then, there have been three large ly free and fa i r general elections, but Guyana remains 
a fragile democracy where po l it ica l parties rema in large ly divided along ethnic lines. 
T h i s has per iod ica l ly resulted in c i v i l unrest and violence, par t icu lar ly around the 1997 and 
2001 elections, and in s low ing the pace o f economic reforms. However, the most recent 
general elections, he ld in August 2006, were peaceful, fostering hope that Guyana’s 
democracy has entered a more stable period. 

3. 
In 2007, Guyana’s GD P reached US$1.043 b i l l i o n with a GN I per capita o f 
US$1,300. With 72 percent o f Guyana’s popu la t ion classified as rural, i t s economy i s 
resource-based; specialized in agriculture and mining, wh ich account fo r 30 percent and 9.7 
percent o f GDP, respectively. In recent years, manufacturing has remained constant at around 
10 percent o f to ta l value added wh i le the share o f services has increased t o 47 percent. The 
IMF A r t ic le IV S ta f f Report (2007) and the Bureau o f Statistics pos i t that Guyana’s o f f ic ia l 
statistics underestimate the size o f i t s GDP by as much as 40 percent. T h i s i s due to tw o 
factors: a large in fo rma l sector that i s no t accurately accounted for, and the use o f biased base 
year (1988) weights in the estimation o f constant-prices GDP. 

4. 
W i t h one o f the highest rates o f skilled m igrat ion in the world, Guyana i s the 
greatest recipient o f remittances as a share o f GDP in the L a t i n Amer ica and Ca r ibbean 
Region, and has the largest percentage o f households who receive remittances. A l though the 
country enjoys the benefits o f remittances, m ig ra t ion in Guyana constitutes a significant 
challenge for human capital and socio-economic development - between 35 and 55 percent 
o f Guyana’s nationals l i v e abroad, and between 80 and 90 percent o f the Guyanese with 
tertiary education a re abroad (Wo r ld Bank, 2007). 

5. 
The incidence o f poverty, at 35 percent o f the population (w i th much higher 
rates in r u r a l and Ame r ind ian areas), i s among the highest in the Western hemisphere. 
Guyana r a n k s 107th out o f 177 countries in the U N D P Human Development Index - second 
lowest in the Car ibbean Region (after Haiti). Despite progress in recent years, s ign i f ican t 
challenges remain. 

6. 
Wh i le some MDG indicators a re l ike ly to be achieved (education, hunger, 
gender, and environment), the country i s s t i l l facing some challenges. Acco rd ing to the 

’ The population was estimated at 763,200 people in 2007 (Govemment o f GuyanalBureau o f Statistics). 
According to the 2008 WDI, and in terms o f GDP per Capita, PPP (current international). 

1 

Pover ty Assessment Report (Wo r ld Bank, 2008), the most s ign i f ican t progress (compared to 
2003) has been made on targets that address hunger and primary education, pa r t icu la r ly to 
l o w income households, and empowerment o f women. Guyana fares very w e l l in terms o f 
educational attainment compared to other L A C countries with similar per capita GDP. 
However, achievements related to maternal and ch i ld health, and con t ro l l ing the prevalence 
o f ma lar ia and other diseases, were assessed as being un l ike ly to be met. The fact that goals 
in chronic ma lnu tr i t ion , poverty, ch i ld mo r ta l i ty and maternal hea l th w i l l no t be met i s 
par t icu lar ly worrisome because o f their long- term imp l ica t ions fo r the we l l-be ing o f large 
segments o f t h e popu la t ion and fo r building human capital. 

Progress Towards Reducing Poverty 
7. 
Accord ing to a Household Income and Expenditure Survey3 completed in 2006, and a 
Pover ty Assessment Report (Wo r ld Bank, 2008), poverty declined at a fast rate during 
1992-1999, but seems to have stagnated afterwards. The na t iona l pover ty rate f e l l f rom 
43.2 percent in 1992 to 36.3 percent in 1999, and extreme pover ty declined even more 
rap id ly f rom 28.7 percent in 1992 to 19.1 percent in 1999. However, since 1999, bo th the 
overa l l and the extreme pover ty headcount rates have remained stable in para l le l with l o w per 
capita GDP (GDP grew at an annualized rate o f less than one percent). In 2006, the na t iona l 
pover ty rate was estimated at 36.1 percent, with the popu la t ion in extreme pover ty 
compr is ing 18.6 percent o f the population. T o achieve the 2015 pover ty MDGs, Guyana w i l l 
need a 10 percentage po in t reduc t ion in poverty, wh ich i s a higher reduc t ion than that 
observed during 1992-1 999. 

8. 
National poverty averages hide strong disparities between ru ra l and urban areas 
with 19 percent in urban areas and 74 percent in ru ra l in te r io r areas. Pover ty rates are very 
similar for the Afro-Guyanese (3 1.6 percent), Indo-Guyanese (30 percent) and the m ixed 
(33.7 percent) population. T h e Amerindians, the m ino r i ty group large ly res id ing in isolated 
ru ra l in ter ior areas, experience the highest pover ty incidence in t h e country (around 78 
percent). T h i s ethnic group represents on ly 9.2 percent o f the popu la t ion in Guyana, but 
contains one third o f the extreme poor population. Low education level i s the individual 
characteristic with the strongest negative association with poverty status. N o t 
surprisingly, the pover ty rate decreases mono ton ica l ly with increasing levels o f education. A 
big decline in pover ty rates i s associated with completed secondary education. In 2006, those 
with t h e least education (none at a l l or incomplete primary), exh ib i ted pover ty rates o f 41 
percent. Ind iv idua ls with completed primary o r incomplete high school show considerably 
lowe r pover ty rates. Comp le t ing secondary education i s associated with earnings that are 20 
percent higher than those with incomplete secondary. 

Gender 
9. 
Acco rd ing to the Pover ty Assessment Report, there are sharp differences in 
participation in the labor force. Guyana has the lowest female par t ic ipa t ion rate in the 
region, and the widest gender par t ic ipa t ion gap. Wh i le 84 percent o f men aged 15-64 years 
o l d look fo r a j o b o r have a job , t h e propor t ion fo r women i s on ly 37 percent. Even 
considering other factors that affect t h e decision to j o i n the labor force (mar i ta l status, 
ethnicity, o r area o f residence), the par t ic ipa t ion gender gap remains strong. This suggests the 
existence o f d is t inc t gender roles in Guyanese society that create a disincentive fo r women to 
participate in the labor market.

10. 
In bo th the PRSP and in i t s recent budget presentation (2009), 
the Government 
h igh l igh ted i t s increased focus o n equity and empowerment o f women. Government actions 
include: 
(i) increased focus to the legislative framework to protect women and to empower them to 
earn a living; (ii) greater emphasis on incorpora t ing entrepreneurial s k i l l s tra in ing in to the l i f e 
s k i l l s programme fo r women and, (iii) in 2009, a residential programme w i l l be implemented 
a long with expanded tra in ing fo r women in h in ter land communities. In addition, a 
programme to assist single parents, who are mos t ly women, w i l l be launched t h i s year. 

Fo res ty 
11. 
Guyana i s a ma jo r prov ider o f environmental services. I t i s located at the heart o f 
the Guiana Shield-a vast expanse o f trop ica l forest shared with Braz i l , French Guyana, 
Suriname and Venezuela. I t i s a center o f b iod ive rs i ty and a prov ider o f environmental 
services o f g loba l scale. M u c h o f Guyana’s indigenous popu la t ion l ives in forests o n wh ich 
they d,epend fo r the ir economic, social and cu l tura l subsistence. These Ame r ind ian 
communities h o l d fo rma l land t i t les over 2.4 m i l l i o n hectares. The annual deforestation rate 
i s estimated at 0.1 - 0.3 percent, wh ich i s re la t ive ly s low compared to most trop ica l countries. 
Abou t 90 percent o f Guyana’s forest i s s t i l l intact. At present, the ma in pressures on forests 
are considered as: forest clearing fo r mining, the conversion o f forest to agriculture, and the 
opening o f infrastructure, especially roads. The ma in factors that protected Guyana’s forests 
so far are considered as: t h e very l o w popu la t ion density away f r om t h e coastal plains, and 
the lack o f phys ica l accessibility to the forest hinterland. However, the l o w rates o f 
deforestation (and o f forest carbon emissions) experienced in Guyana in the past may n o t 
accurately predict f u t u r e trends, as the country continues to imp rove i t s infrastructure and to 
meet i ts development challenges. 

Vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters 
12. 
Guyana i s highly vulnerable to climate change and na tu ra l disasters. Acco rd ing 
to the 2005 Economic Commission fo r L a t i n Amer ica and the Caribbean (ECLAC), 
Guyana’s to ta l losses resulting f r om t h e heavy rains o f January 2005 amounted to US$465 
m i l l ion , o r 59 percent o f the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the most densely 
populated area in the country, 71 percent o f residents were affected, wh i le 20 percent o f those 
in ne ighbor ing regions were impacted. In low land areas, f lood waters persisted fo r over a 
mon th and t h e death t o l l reached 34, mos t ly attributed to waterborne disease. 

13. 
Sea level rise poses an impo r tan t challenge to Guyana’s geography, ecology and 
economy. Accord ing to recent estimates4, sea leve l can be expected to consistently r ise and 
poss ib ly reach one meter by the end o f the century. A r ise o f t h i s magnitude wou ld f lood 
about 200,000 hectares, where 70 .percent o f the popu la t ion resides, 40 percent o f the 
agricultural land i s located and 48 percent o f the GDP i s produced. Wh i le a change o f this 
magnitude i s decades away, the Government recognizes the need to plan ahead fo r the

Recent Macroeconomic Developments 

A. 
15. 
Economic growth in Guyana has been characterized b y h igh volatility. Between 
1997 and 2007, years o f GDP g row th were interspersed with years o f contraction. F r om 
2002 to 2005, GDP growth averaged 0.08 percent (Figure l), re f lec t ing increased o i l prices, 
natural disasters (severe floods in 2005), t h e w ind ing down o f produc t ion in Guyana’s largest 
go ld m ine and t h e deteriorating security situation. GDP g row th rebounded in 2006 and 2007, 
reaching 5.1 percent and 5.4 percent respectively, underpinned by boom ing investment 
ac t iv i t ies and favorable terms o f trade changes. S ign i f ican t remittance f lows (about 25 
percent o f GDP in 2007) and FDI (12.2 percent o f GDP in 2007) helped finance the 
additional investment. T h e estimated g row th rate fo r 2008 i s 3.2 percent. The slower g row th 
i s ma in ly due to strongly contracting sugar produc t ion and lowe r manufacturing output, 
wh ich f e l l by 15 percent due to heavy rains. Non-sugar g row th was strong at 6 percent, 
dr iven by grow th in construction and commod i ty exports (rice, gold).

The fiscal situation deteriorated considerably between 2002 and 2005, but the 
Government has made efforts to reverse the trend since then. 
Increased expenditures 
after 2002 were the result o f rising impo r t prices (especially oil), flood-related reconstruction 
expenses, the Cr icke t W o r l d Cup-related spending as w e l l as the much needed investment to 

4 

modernize the sugar industry5. Sugar sector investments were necessary to ensure the 
sector’s competitiveness in the context o f the gradual e l im ina t ion o f the European U n i o n 
(EU) sugar preference6. The overa l l Government de f ic i t after gran ts increased f rom 5.9 
percent o f GDP in 2002 to 13.6 in 2005 (or 9.3 exc lud ing the Skeldon sugar investment). 

17. With f isca l consolidation, t h e de f ic i t declined to 1 1.5 percent o f GDP in 2006, and to 
7.6 percent o f GDP in 2007. T h e recently improved f isca l balance reflects a strong revenue 
effort, no tab ly through improved administration, and the in troduc t ion o f a value added tax in 
January 2007, as w e l l as restrained expenditures w i t h improved p r io r i t iza t ion o f the Pub l ic 
Sector Investment Program (PSIP) and containment o f the wage bill. A reduc t ion o f in te res t 
payments due to the various debt forgiveness in i t ia t ives has also he lped to imp rove the f isca l 
position. 

18. 
The f isca l de f ic i t widened in 2008 to 8.7 percent o f GDP primarily due to measures 
adopted to m i t iga te the impac t o f h igher f u e l prices. The measures inc luded subsidies to the 
e lec tr ic i ty company to contain t a r i f f increases and a reduc t ion in fue l excise taxes, and cost 
about 4 percent o f GDP. These measures have been reversed. The other measures -- 
expanding t h e l i s t o f zero-rated VAT goods and a subsidy to flour -- have had a very small 
effect on the budget; however, i f maintained, they cou ld over the l o n g run erode the tax base.

At an average level o f 15 percent for the period 1998-2005, Guyana would appear to have a comparatively high public investment to 
GDP ratio. Comparator small countries have a rate we l l below 10 percent; however, due to Guyana’s particular geographic 
configuration (10 percent o f the land in Guyana i s below sea level), and the difficulties o f connecting communities dispersed over i ts 
vast land area, public infrastructure requires higher than average amunts o f public investment. 
A sugar modernization p lan was initiated in 2000, anticipating lower preferential prices for exports to the EU. The p lan calls for 
increasing output by nearly 70% over the medium term, f rom 226,000 tons in 2008 to 389,000 tons in 2012, and reducing costs f rom 
20 U S cents to 11 U S cents per pound. The program included the construction o f a new US$180 m i l l ion factory, mostly completed in 
2008 (source: IMF S t a f f Report, 2009).

B. 
Outlook for 2009-2012 
Impact of the Global cr is is7 . Guyana is vulnerable to the global crisis, through a 
weakening of commodity exports (sugar, rice, timber, bauxite, and gold), a reduction in 
workers remittances and reduced foreign direct investment. Since exports o f sugar, rice, 

timber, bauxite and gold account for 40 percent of GDP, the global slowdown in demand for 
these commodities is likely to have an impact on growth. In 2009, exports of goods are 
projected to decline (in value terms) by 16 percent, with a decline in all the main commodity 
exports except gold (whose exports are projected to increase by 7.2 percent). The commodity 
which is projected to experience the highest decline in exports (51 percent) is bauxite. 
Imports are also projected to decline by 19.2 percent in 2009, which will result in a projected 
increase in net merchandise trade from -484 to -365 from 2008 to 2009. Remittances, which 
account for over 25 percent o f GDP, are vulnerable to rising unemployment in labor markets 
in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom. Remittances have held up in 2008, but are 
projected to decline in 2009 by about -25%. Large investment projects under consideration, 
such as the hydropower plant, are likely to be delayed. 

20. 
The financial sector, even with limited exposure to international financial markets, is 
not immune, as the recent failure of the Caribbean Life Insurance Company (CLICO), the 
Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) based conglomerate, has shown. The fallout from the CLICO 
T&T was felt in the Bahamas where the liquidation process of the local company started on 
February 26, 2009, and subsequently in Guyana. The Government acted swiftly and put 
CLICO (Guyana) under judicial administration on March 2, 2009, with the insurance 
supervisor acting a s a manager. CLICO Guyana has 15,000 policy holders and holds about 
17% o f the National Insurance Scheme's assets. The deficit of its statutory fund is estimated 
a t USD 60 million according to the supervisor. The Guyana authorities are claiming USD 34 
million into CLICO Bahamas, but the Bahamian liquidator has proposed to reclassify this 
amount a s unsecured intercompany advances, which would have a low priority in the 
liquidation. The recent IMF Article IV for Guyana (February 2009) notes that as of end- 
September 2008, the Banks had capital to risk adjusted asset ratios well above 8 percent and 
liquidity levels were comfortable. NPLs are high at 10 percent, but do not appear to have 
risen. Stress tests, based on an update of the 2006 FSAP, with the current risks, show that 
banks appear resilient, with vulnerabilities emerging with severe shocks across the economy 
or a combination of shocks. 

Prospects in 2009 and 2010 show a slowdown in growth. These projections are 

21. 
more conservative than those presented by the Government in its 2009 budget and by the 
IMF in its recent Article IV (see table 1). Growth in 2009 is projected to decelerate sharply 
in most non-sugar sectors. Sugar production, while projected to grow compared to 2008, 
does not achieve the increase of well over 20 percent projected in the 2009 budget. In 2008, 
it declined by 15% due to the impact of the flooding. Starting in 2010, a more broad based 
growth would be underpinned by an expected global economic recovery, which would result 
in gradual increases in export prices and remittances. Growth in Guyana could then reach 
well over 3 percent in 201 0 and increase to 4-5 percent in 20 1 1 - 13. 

22. 
The Government has indicated its commitment to continue fiscal consolidation in the 
medium term, targeting an overall deficit after grants averaging about 3.5 percent of GDP. 
This fiscal strategy is crucial to achieve healthy public finances and a sustainable debt burden 
in the medium term, but it is also a very ambitious strategy. The authorities envisage a 

' The current macroeconomic projections are based on available information and staff estimates. 

23. 
Debt Management and Sustainabili@. Guyana’s debt sustainability has improved 
dramatically since 2002. T h e country reached the Enhanced H I P C (E-HIPC) Comp le t ion 
Po in t in December 2003 qua l i fy ing fo r US$329 m i l l i o n o f debt r e l i e f in NPV terms, 
additional to t h e debt r e l i e f o f US$256 m i l l i o n in NPV terms obtained under the or ig ina l 
H I PC in M a y 1999. A l though t h e external debt burden, as measured by the NPV o f external 
debt to revenue ratio, declined fo l low ing the E -H IPC Comp le t ion Point, debt sustainability 
concerns re-emerged in 2004 and were on ly eased after the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
Mu l t i la te ra l Debt Re l ie f In i t ia t ive (MDRI). In 2006/7 under the MDRI, about US$611 
m i l l i o n o f Guyana’s debt has been w r i t ten o f f by the IMF, t h e W o r l d Bank and the I n t e r - 
Amer ican Development Bank. 
In November 2006, Japan f ina l ized i t s b i la tera l debt 
cancellation agreement and, in July 2007, there was a w r i te -o f f US$15 m i l l i o n o f outstanding 
debt to China. As o f end-2007, external debt declined substantially and was US$719 m i l l i o n 
(67 percent o f GDP). F ina l ly , in 2008, Guyana benefited f rom debt reduc t ion o f fered by 
Venezuela that cancelled US$12.5 m i l l ion . 

24. 
The updated j o i n t IMF-WB debt sustainability analysis (DSA)*, presented in Annex 
E, indicates that Guyana remains at a moderate r i s k o f debt distress. The ma in conclusions 
f rom the DSA highlight that wh i le projected debt indicators are s im i lar to those o f the 
February 2008 DSA, the po ten t ia l vu lnerab i l i t ies have increased, name ly the r i s k o f a weak 
implementation o f the sugar modernization plan and a more pro longed g loba l s lowdown 
(than curren t ly envisaged). The to ta l pub l ic sector debt ratios show h igher vu lne rab i l i ty than 
t h e external ones, underscoring the importance o f deepening f isca l consolidation. Go ing 
forward, the DSA highlights that Guyana’s external and pub l ic debt ou t look w i l l depend on 
ma in ta in ing a sustainable medium-term f isca l framework, broadening the sources o f growth, 
and a prudent debt strategy. 

C . 

Challenges and Coun t ry Priorities 
25. 
T h e Government’s v is ion i s to accelerate g row th by addressing several challenges. 
These challenges were con f irmed at the CAS consultations as the Government’s ma in 
pr ior i t ies in the next four years: 

(i) Protecting the environment and managing natural resources w i t h simultaneous 
sustainable social and economic development; 
(ii) Manag ing the sea leve l r ise and changes in ra in fa l l patterns through disaster 
m i t iga t ion ; 
(iii) Imp rov ing infrastructure to promote g row th and pr iva te sector development; 
(iv) 
Imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f education; 
Imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f hea l th services wh ich i s hampered by the em igra t ion o f 
(v) 
sk i l led hea l th personnel; 
(vi) Deepening governance and modern iz ing the state, wh i le building on progress 
already made; and 
(vii) Preventing cr ime and enhancing citizen’s security. 

26. 
Protecting the environment and managing the country’s na tu ra l resources w i th 
simultaneous sustainable social and economic development i s a ma jo r challenge and one 
in which Guyana i s p lay ing a global leadership role. President Jagdeo i s ac t ive ly pursuing 
a v is ion o f a l o w carbon development strategy and i s seeking to leverage the preservation o f 
the country’s vast forests to raise cap i ta l to develop economic and social infrastructure. H e 
has expressed his country’s w i l l ingness to place the Guyana rainforest under long- term

protection, i f adequate market-based incentives are created to make th is e f fo r t economically 
and socially wo r thwh i le fo r the countryg. Guyana i s par t ic ipa t ing in the design o f a post- 
K y o t o climate change m i t iga t ion regime, and w i l l be one o f the f i r s t participants in the new 
Forest Carbon Partnership Fac i l i ty administered by the W o r l d Bank. I t w i l l l i k e l y receive a 
US$2 m i l l i o n grant to ready i tse l f to reduce carbon emissions f r om forests, and access larger 
f inanc ia l transfers in return-a grant to prepare the country’s Readiness P lan was approved in 
June 2008. Guyana i s n o w the f i r s t country to have submitted a readiness plan. The Bank 
w i l l support the Government’s goals in t h i s area sector through a Forestry project. 

27. 
G iven the importance o f agriculture income in ru ra l pover ty reduction, agriculture 
r i s k s (climate and p r ice r i s k ) must be managed in a comprehensive manner. Inappropriate 
agricultural practices, and inadequate exploration o f m ine ra l resources, the disturbance and 
degradation o f forests, and unregulated squatter settlements are the ma jo r issues related to the 
sustainability o f the environment. The Government has also taken the lead in promoting, at 
an international level, an approach to the climate change agenda that recognizes and 
addresses human development objectives. 

28. 
Manag ing the sea level rise and changes in ra in fa l l patterns through in te r a l ia 
disaster m it igat ion i s another important challenge. Drainage and i r r iga t ion systems were 
constructed over a hundred years ago, and have no t been adequately maintained, no r are they 
designed to deal with the added stress o f sea leve l rise. Currently, catastrophic c l ima te r i s k i s 
absorbed by the Government and agriculture producers at great cost, res tr ic t ing their ab i l i ty 
to ex i t f rom pover ty and inhibiting g row th and agricultural competitiveness. G iven Guyana’s 
need to increase agr icu l tura l competitiveness, f inanc ia l instruments such as agr icu l tura l 
insurance cou ld p rov ide a sustainable market mechanism to manage and transfer such r i s k s to 
international markets. The Bank w i l l support the Government in addressing t h i s challenge 
through technical assistance on agriculture risk insurance. 

29. 
Imp rov ing infrastructure to promote growth and p r iva te sector development. 
T h e 2006 Investment C l ima te Survey ( ICs ) revealed that access to finance (cost o f f inanc ing 
and collateral), electricity, telecom services, s k i l l s and education o f available workers, and 
po l i t ica l uncertainty o r ins tab i l i ty , were the ma jor constraints to do ing business. A g row th 
diagnostics study lo emphasized the poor appropr iab i l i ty o f returns o n pr iva te investment, 
wh ich hampers capital accumulation, innova t ive ac t iv i t ies and produc t ive d ivers i f ica t ion o f 
t h e economy and i s l inked primarily to a weak ins t i tu t iona l framework. The Government i s 
committed in i t s PRSP to undertake various measures to imp rove infrastructure, inc lud ing : 
imp rov ing drainage and i r r iga t ion systems; imp rov ing the roads ne two rk and the sea defense, 
as w e l l as expanding and d ive rs i fy ing power supply. In telecommunications, negotiations 
regarding the opening o f the sector to compe t i t ion are progressing we l l . The sector i s 
currently dominated by the pr iva te monopo ly prov ider GT&T. Once an agreement i s reached 
to end the monopoly, support w i l l be requ ired to modernize the sector’s po l icy , legal, 
regulatory and ins t i tu t iona l frameworks. In addition, as compe t i t ion i s likely to be 
concentrated i n i t i a l l y on the ma in urban centers, a comprehensive universal service program 
w i l l need to be implemented. The Bank w i l l support the Government’s goals in enhancing 
the telecommunications sector through a reg iona l connec t iv i ty project. 

30. 
Imp rov ing the qua l ity o f education. Guyana made significant progress in terms 
o f access to education, and p r im a r y school enrollment in the last few years was close to

100 percent. However, qua l ity and equity constitute ma jo r concerns a t a l l levels o f 
education. Over the past three years, Guyana has successfully implemented a series o f 
activities under the Education Fo r A l l-Fas t Track In i t ia t ive (EFA-FTI), wh ich has supported 
primary education under the Government’s Education Strategic Plan. Guyana has achieved 
good results in the number o f ch i ldren comp le t ing p r ima ry education (Grade 6), with the 
national average at 100 percent, and the h in ter land imp rov ing s ign i f ican t ly f rom 85 percent in 
2002 to 94 percent in 2007. Steady progress i s also be ing made towards achieving universal 
secondary education with about 78 percent enrollment, a l though reg iona l disparities persist, 
repe t i t ion and drop out rates rema in high, and qua l i ty indicators are be low expectations. 

3 1. 
There have been significant gains in the last few years, but the range o f qua l i ty needs 
i s wide: 
trained teachers in the coastland and h in ter land represent on ly 57 percent and 38 
percent o f t h e i r respective totals, student absenteeism i s high (20-25 percent), student 
performance on national assessments i s low , and a propor t ion o f school fac i l i t ies continue to 
be in poor condition. These concerns justify qua l i ty as the imperative fo r the Ministry o f 
Education in i t s future plan. The Government has focused much e f fo r t on ma in ta in ing and 
imp rov ing the number o f trained teachers in the system, resu l t ing in pos i t ive resu l ts despite 
t h e constant ou t f low o f t h e most experienced teachers to more lucra t ive jobs in the pr iva te 
sector, and emigration to other countries where teacher salaries are more attractive. 

32. 
The Government w i l l improve l i teracy and numeracy and vocational and technical 
education through imp rov ing teachers’ education. I t s ob jec t ive i s to increase the propor t ion 
o f trained teachers f rom 57 percent to 70 percent by 2012, and to upgrade the knowledge o f 
t h e teachers in their specialized areas at the secondary level. T h e Bank w i l l support the 
Government’s plan through an Education pro jec t focused o n the re fo rm o f teachers’ training. 

33. 
Imp rov ing the qua l ity o f health services. Compared to other L A C and even m idd le 
income countries, Guyana i s do ing better in certain areas o f hea l th such as immunizations, 
but worse in others such as ch i ld and maternal mor ta l i ty . Assistance during births i s also less 
prevalent in Guyana than in L A C countries o r M ICs . In addition, Guyana had 48 physicians 
per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005, a lower ra t io compared to Dom in ica and Grenada (50) as 
well as Jamaica (85). These ra t ios pa r t ia l ly exp la in poo r outcomes in maternal health care 
services in Guyana-maternal mo r ta l i ty in Guyana i s more than tw ice the rate in Jamaica. 

34. 
The prevalence o f HIV/AIDS i s estimated at between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent in 
the adult population. The epidemic appears to be stabilizing. Services fo r prevention, 
treatment, and care, increased dramatically in the last fou r years, especially aided by funding 
f rom t h e W o r l d Bank, the G loba l Fund fo r A I D S , Tuberculosis and Ma la r ia and the U S 
Government’s President’s Emergency Program fo r A I D S . The Bank i s supporting the hea l th 
sector through an ongo ing HIV/AIDS Prevention and Con t ro l project. Results show that 
Guyana has made significant progress in con t ro l l ing HIV/AIDS as demonstrated, in part, by 
the decline in the trend o f HIV in fec t ions among pregnant women f rom 5.6 percent in 2000

percent o f the popu la t ion in 2001 , to about 2.7 percent o f the popu la t ion in 2006. In the case 
o f tuberculosis (TB), although modest results were achieved in reducing i t s incidence over 
the period, disturbing high levels persist in 6 out o f the 10 regions in Guyana, par t icu lar ly in 
the hinterland regions. Acco rd ing to the recen t ly updated Na t iona l Hea l th Sector Strategy fo r 
2008-2012, the Government aims to achieve improvements across the who le range o f pub l ic 
hea l th services through strengthening human resources and expanding infrastructure to 
increase coverage.

Guyana faces a major challenge in retaining its skilled population. 
I t has 
experienced one o f the highest ne t em igra t ion f lows o f the region, and the estimated annual 
emigration rate i s 2 percent (Wo r ld Bank, 2007). However, m ig ra t ion also directs a 
significant in - f low o f f inanc ia l resources in to the country. Therefore, a care fu l strategy that 
links t h e diaspora to their home country may be effective in bene f i t ing f r om the sk i l led 
imm igran ts wh i le abroad (Box 1). An ongo ing regional study i s be ing undertaken at the 
Bank and aims at addressing nurse m ig ra t ion issues. 

Box 1: International Migration: A Challenge and an Opportunity 

Guyana has one o f the highest rates o f skilled m igrat ion in the m. The country has also one o f the 
highest net out-migration flows o f the La t in America and Caribbean region. I t i s the largest recipient o f 
remittances in the region (relative to GDP), and has the largest percentage o f households who receive 
remittances. M igra t ion in Guyana constitutes a significant challenge for socio-economic development. I t 
i s estimated that between 35 and 55 percent o f Guyana’s inhabitants l i v e abroad, and that between 80 and 
90 percent o f the Guyanese with tertiary education are abroad (Wo r ld Bank, 2007b). About h a l f o f students 
intend to migrate soon, and some o f them enter the university precisely in order to gain the necessary s k i l l s 
to be able to migrate. Entrepreneurs, professionals, teachers, and nurses are leav in Guyana for better 
opportunities, for higher pay, better work conditions, more freedom and more security”. A t the same time, 
m igra t ion constitutes an opportunity fo r the poor who are increasingly benefiting f rom the remittances. 
I t 
i s estimated that remittances constitute over 25% o f GDP, and about one-third o f the Guyanese population 
receives remittances. Th e Poverty Assessment Repo r t projected tha t “if remittances were to be 
exogenously taken away f rom Guyana tomorrow, the poverty ra te would increase f rom 36 to 46 
percent. Th e poverty among cu r ren t remittance receivers wou ld have doubled to 50%.” Remittances 
are an important part o f t h e social safety nets, and have a positive effect on education. For instance, 
remittance-receiving households are more likely t o keep their children in school, wh ich has an impact on 
secondary and tertiary enrollment rates. 
Addressing the m igrat ion issue becomes urgent as remittances a re l ike ly to decline significantly as a 
result o f the global financial crisis. 

37. 
Deepening governance and modernizing the state, while building on progress 
already made. T h e Government recognizes in i t s new PRSP that achieving higher economic 
g row th and improved pub l ic services w i l l no t be achieved w i thou t 
fundamental 
improvements in governance and pub l ic sector ins t i tu t iona l capacity. Corruption, weaknesses 
in pub l ic accountability and loca l Government ins t i tu t ions are the key challenges that 
constrain pr iva te sector development and wh ich also exp la in the l o w social and economic 
re turn on pub l ic spending. 

38. 
The Government has demonstrated its commitment to addressing governance in 
its national development through the appointment o f a governance advisor and the 
establishment o f a dedicated unit w i t h i n the o f f ice o f the president. Interventions o n

l o n g overdue loca l Government elections, (4) strengthening o f parliamentary oversight, and 
(5) imp lemen t ing constitutional reforms passed by the Na t iona l Assembly in 200 1. Guyana 
receives support f rom the IDB, through C i t izen Security and Justice Sector programs, f rom 
the UNDP , in commun i ty leve l security improvement and elections support, f r om DFID in 
t h e broad security sector, and f r om C I D A in t h e area o f loca l Government elections. U S A ID , 
through the M i l lenn ium Challenge Threshold program, has been supporting some o f the 
parliamentary reforms. I t i s wo r th no t ing that the re fo rm agenda fo r strengthening f iduc iary 
oversight and parliamentary systems was developed in the context o f the W o r l d Bank 
PSTAC program, wh ich closed in 2007. 

39 . 
T h e W o r l d Bank i s curren t ly par t ic ipa t ing in the dialogue w i t h the Government o n 
Governance issues in the context o f the donor-Government Governance Thematic Group. 
T h i s Thematic Group meets every s ix weeks, and includes Government representatives (the 
O f f ice o f the President), the W o r l d Bank, IDB, UNDP , DFID, C ID A , USAID, OAS, and the 
EU. Agenda i tems inc lude security, parliamentary re forms ( inc lud ing f iduc ia ry oversight 
re fo rm agenda), implementation o f constitutional reforms, loca l Government re fo rm and 
elections. 

40. 
Progress has been achieved in modern iz ing regulatory and ins t i tu t iona l frameworks. 
An Integrated F inanc ia l Management and Accoun t ing System ( I F M A S ) to interconnect the 
Government's f inanc ia l management and accounting systems and con t ro l overa l l pub l ic 
expenditures has been implemented. T h e capital budget i s prepared within the framework o f 
a r o l l i n g five-year Pub l ic Sector Investment Program (PSIP), with a p r io r i t iza t ion mechanism. 
Standard bidding documents and operational manuals are n ow used increasingly throughout 
central Government entities. The Audit O f f ice o f Guyana (AOG) has begun imp lemen t ing 
international aud i t ing standards and aud i t ing methodologies 
to pe r fo rm operational, 
performance, and forensic audits. The legislature has moved to strengthen i t s oversight ro le 
over the execution o f t h e budget through leg is la t ive rev iew o f the external audit reports, and 
by questioning responsible parties about the findings f r om the reports. Improvements have 
also been made in budget formu la t ion and implementation. 

41. 
However, challenges remain, in par t icu lar consolidating the re fo rm gains and mov ing 
towards a programmatic and results based system. The implementation o f common in terna l 
controls and audit frameworks, the un i f ica t ion o f current and capital budgets, and the 
strengthening o f the linkages between budget preparation and procurement planning, are key 
elements that need to be consolidated before mov ing towards a programmatic and results 
based system. T h e establishment o f an e f fec t ive mon i to r ing and evaluation framework also 
remains a p r io r i ty . The Government w i l l continue i t s e f for ts to promote governance in i t s 
new strategy. Concrete actions include: (i) strengthening parliament as w e l l as pub l ic sector 
e f f ic iency and effectiveness, and (ii) strengthening the O f f ice o f the Aud i to r General, and 
(iii) re fo rm ing the In teg r i ty Commission. 

42. 

Preventing crime and enhancing security. I t i s widely recognized that reduc ing 
cr ime and imp rov ing security in Guyana i s extremely c r i t ica l fo r the country's g row th and 
competitiveness, and i t i s among the Government's pr ior i t ies . C r ime and violence generate 
fear and anxiety, fue l migration, discourage long- term investment, and severely compromise 
good g ~ v e r n a n c e ' ~ . The Investment C l ima te Survey (2007) reported that cr ime losses and

111. WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. Lessons from the last CAS 

43. 
The 2002 CAS marked a fundamental shift in the IDA lending strategy fo r 
Guyana. D raw ing on the experience o f previous interventions, and guided by the Bank’s 
mandate fo r pover ty reduction and i t s comparative advantage in po l icy dialogue, the strategy 
focused on supporting the po l icy re fo rm agenda o f the PRSP. T h e CAS sh i f ted f i o m pro jec t 
lend ing to a series o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) consisting o f a series o f 
single tranche programmatic credits. T h e pace o f re forms was seen as the constraint on h ow 
many PRSCs cou ld be provided, but the f i r s t PRSC (PRSC-I) program document suggested 
that i t might be possible to proceed at a pace o f one PRSC per year. The CAS focused on 
areas where the Bank was v iewed as hav ing a comparative advantage, and sought to ensure 
complementarities w i t h other development partners. 

44. 
The CAS supported three key pr ior i t ies o f the 2001 PRSP: (i) s t imu la t ing economic 
g row th through sound macroeconomic management, more e f f ic ien t implementation o f the 
pub l ic sector investment program (in par t icu lar in the sugar sector), and imp rov ing the 
environment 
fo r pr iva te investment; (ii) imp rov ing pub l ic sector governance and 
accountability by strengthening oversight systems and building capacity; and (iii) enhancing 
prov is ion of, and access to, basic services and safety nets. 

45. While the CAS correctly identified the country’s challenges, i t was extremely 
ambitious and overestimated the consensus and capacity fo r reforms. Imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the CAS agenda was undermined by t h e macroeconomic program go ing temporar i ly o f f - t rack 
and the acceleration o f po l i t ica l disruptions. The ensuing delays (even w i t h a two year 
extension) and the under ly ing ins t i tu t iona l issues indicate that t h e o r ig ina l schedule o f one 
PRSC per year was too optimistic. Re fo rm e f for ts have been uneven. The ma in issues 
iden t i f ied during CAS implementation were: (i) lack o f broad consensus fo r reforms; (ii) 
even when there was consensus, the re fo rm process was slow; and (iii) l im i t e d management 
and technical capacity to carry out reforms. 

46. 
Among the achievements under the previous CAS, the outcomes o f the School 
Feeding Program under the EFA-FTI are noticeable. As o f December 2008, there were over 
11,000 bene f ic iary ch i ldren in 60 p r ima ry schools in the in te r io r o f the country (hinterland). 
T h i s represented 57 percent o f a l l primary school ch i ldren in Regions 1, 7, 8, and 9. In 
communities where the program operates, student attendance has increased, a loca l market 
fo r food i tems has developed, and parents and other commun i ty members are considerably 
more engaged in the school and loca l activities. An on-going impac t evaluation w i l l capture 
more precisely the levels o f improvement related to the objectives o f t h e program. 

47. 
The C A S Comp le t ion Report provides a detailed assessment o f Bank performance 
during FY03-08 (Annex D). B o x 2 summarizes the ma in lessons and recommendations.

Box 2: Lessons and Recommendations 

~ 

~~ 

Selectivity and simplicity in design are key. 

The strategy was w ide ranging w i t h highly optimistic objectives and implementation time. 
K e y performance indicators should be focused and as much as possible linked to measurable 
outcomes. 
Keep priorities well-focused and implementation flexible. 

Lack o f capacity in the Guyanese public sector i s a cross-cutting constraint. 

Future operations should aim at increasing substantially public sector capacity. 
Timefiame and design o f fu tu re operations should take in to account capacity constraints in the 
pub l ic service. 

Client ownership and commitment, including champions, are critical. 

The lack o f Government focus on some key reforms lowered expectations and the impact o f 

the CAS. 
Lack o f political and social cohesion can undermine the reform agenda. 

The Government noted that wh i le the conditions were conducive to growth at the beginning o f 
the previous CAS period, po l i t ica l conditions and social cohesion were no t in place, 
contributing to poor growth and sluggish reduction in poverty. 
Po l i t ica l constraints often prevented re form f i om moving, as was the case w i t h the VAT, 
wh ich was implemented in 2007 after much delay. 
Improve po l i t ica l economy analysis in project design. 

Resource flows need to be more predictable. 

Unpredictable resource f lows negatively impacted government programs, particularly with the 
debt re l ie f packages, where delays forced the government t o scale down some investments. 

Project sustainability requires retaining key personnel, 

Projects that re ly heavily on highly-paid consultants who are un l ike ly to be retained by the 
government at project completion are l i k e l y t o experience weak implementation ando r l im i ted 
long-term development impact. 

Donor coordination needs to be strengthened. 

Consider, for instance, j o i n t missions to address common issues and pooled funds/swaps. 

Choice and scope o f AAA should involve more consultation with the government 

Ana ly t ica l work and po l icy notes should be demand-driven, part o f the on-going re form 
process, and delivered in a t ime ly manner. 

B. Current Bank Group Program

The Guyana po r t fo l io o f IDA - f inanced projects i s small, comprising tw o projects 
to ta l ing US$21.3 m i l l ion , HIV/AIDS (US$ lO m i l l ion ) and Water Sector Consolidation 
(US$11.3 m i l l ion) . In addition, the Trust Fund po r t fo l io to ta l ing US$18.9 m i l l i o n includes 
the Education fo r A l l E a s t Track In i t ia t ive (EFA-FTI) program supported by the FT I

W o r l d Bank, and a Trust Fund fo r Na t iona l Statistics Strategy and Statistical Development 
TA project (US$285,000). Ongo ing ana ly t ica l wo rk includes a reg iona l energy study 
(A l terna t ive Energy Supply) in l i n e with t h e Government’s objective o f d ivers i f i ing power 
supply sources, and limiting Guyana’s exposure to hydrocarbon pr ice fluctuation. An 
Integrated F iduc iary Assessment has been recently completed and delivered to the 
Government (2008).

C. Country Assistance Strategy N 0 9 - F Y 1 2 
52. Ma in thrust o f the Strategy: T h i s CAS i s bo th demand-driven and highly selective. 
I t s design i s framed by four factors: (i) the small IDA a l loca t ion (US$8.2 m i l l ion ) and i t s 
imp l ica t ions fo r the choice o f instruments; (ii) the need to stay engaged and rema in relevant 
in areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage; (iii) the need to wo rk in areas where 
t h e Bank’s support cou ld s ign i f ican t ly leverage additional financing; and (iv) the need to 
rema in realistic w i t h regards to the selection o f outcomes to be a ~ h i e v e d ’ ~ . 

53. 
The CAS seeks to achieve i t s outcomes through a m i x o f instruments that re ly heav i ly 
on Technical Assistance and ana ly t ica l work, wh ich complement a limited lend ing envelope, 
and that leverage other donors’ support. In bo th lend ing and AAA, the CAS w i l l a l low the 
Bank to be in a pos i t ion to take advantage o f opportunities as they arise, and thus 
incorporates reserves fo r “seed money” to enable the Bank to explore areas where i t can 
prov ide analytical o r project preparation ac t iv i t ies that cou ld leverage add i t iona l donor 
financing. 

54. 
The CAS program i s summarized in Table 2 and in Annex B3 . I t should be noted 
that the amounts shown in outer years are ind ica t ive on ly . Ac tua l allocations w i l l depend on: 
(i) the country’s o w n performance; (ii) i t s performance re la t ive to that o f other IDA 
recipients; (iii) the amount o f overa l l resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the l i s t o f 
active IDA -e l ig ib le countries; (v) terms o f f inanc ia l assistance prov ided (grants o r loans); and 
(vi) the amount o f compensatory resources received fo r MDRI. 

55 . 

IDA assistance under IDA 15 comprises bo th the new allocations (SDR 5.6 m i l l i o n o r 
US$8.2 m i l l ion ) as w e l l as the debt r e l i e f o f SDR 7.5 m i l l i o n (or US$11 m i l l ion ) prov ided 
under the MDRI, wh ich leaves resources in the Government’s budget. 

56. 
The Government submitted to the donor commun i ty a dra f t o f i ts second PRSP in 
November, 2008. I t was considered prudent to proceed w i t h the C A S ahead o f the Joint S ta f f 

j 4 Given the limited envelope, the proposed support w i l l only contribuk to supporting some o f government3 challenges. As a result, 
the strict definitions o f the Results Framework may not be applicable here, and several outcomes identified i n the CAS may only be 
“outputs” at this stage. In the longer run, when the analytical support i s operationalized, those outputs w i l l indeed translate into real 
outcomes. 

14 

Adv iso ry No te fo r several reasons: (i) t h e CAS i s fully aligned with the draft PRSP; (ii) the 
Government i s f ina l iz ing the PRSP but the timing i s uncertain as i t faces many urgent 
priorities, especially in the wake o f the f inanc ia l crisis; (iii) the pr ior i t ies in the Second PRSP 
are clear and are no t expected to change, no r w i l l they require any change in the Bank 
program; (iv) t h e C A S i s also based on and aligned with extensive consultations w i t h the 
Government, other donors, the pr iva te sector, and c i v i l society; and (v) g iven l im i ted IDA 
allocations, there i s urgent need to have a clearly de f ined strategy to p r io r i t ize W o r l d Bank 
interventions. Further, early ac t ion wou ld also a l low t h e Government to seek alternative 
f inanc ing fo r activities that the Bank i s unable to finance. Pred ic tab i l i ty o f a id f lows was one 
o f the constraints highlighted by the Government in the lessons learned f r om earlier 
assistance. 

57. 

Pillars and Outcomes. The overa l l objective o f t h e FY09-12 CAS i s to contribute 
to the Government’s overarching PRSP focus o f accelerating and sustaining growth 
through two main pillars: (i) strengthening environmental resilience and sustainability; 
and (i) improving education quality and social safety nets. 

58 . 

In the area o f strengthening environmental resilience and sustainability, the CAS 
aims at contributing to achieving the fo l low ing outcomes: (i) P i lo t forest areas protected 
and sustainably managed by loca l communities; and (ii) Improved Government’s ab i l i ty to 
reduce exposure to na tura l disasters and g loba l c l ima te risk. In the area o f improving 
education quality and social safety nets, the C A S aims at contributinp to achieving the 
fo l low ing outcomes: (i) Imp roved qua l i ty o f education through re fo rm o f teacher tra in ing and 
better service delivery; and (ii) Imp roved ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f the Government, and 
ab i l i ty to deliver an enhanced social pro tec t ion program. 

59. 
Rationale. In add i t ion to the reasons explained above, the selection o f the two p i l la rs 
i s also based on: (i) the Government’s request fo r Bank assistance in Forestry, Education, and 
Social Protection, and i t s emphasis and commitment to addressing the issues related to those 
sectors; (ii) ongo ing engagement with the Government on environmental resilience and 
education (such as the w o r k on the Conservancy Adaptation Project and the e f for ts to reduce 
Guyana’s exposures to catastrophic r i s k f rom sea leve l r ise , hurricanes and other natural 
disasters; and the EFA-FTI program); and (iii) based on past achievements that w i l l be 
sustained and continued during this CAS.

The CAS i n h e r i t s a Water sector consolidation and H I V / A I D S ongoing projects 
whose development impac t wou ld be to support the achievement o f sustainable universal 
access o f safe and affordable water; and slow the increase o f HIV in fec t ions and mor ta l i ty , 
respectively. Those projects are no t part o f the fo rwa rd look ing engagements, and are no t 
par t o f the proposed CAS pillars. 

(i) Strengthening environmental resilience and sustainability. In l ine with President 
Jagdeo’s agenda on C l ima te Change, the Bank w i l l assist Guyana’s efforts to protect forests 
(mitigation) and prevent natural disasters (adaptation). On the m i t iga t ion side, t h e Bank w i l l 
accompany t h e country’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions f rom deforestation and he lp 
negotiate external resources in re turn (Readiness Grant f r om the FCPF curren t ly be ing 
processed ( U S $ 2 m i l l ion) . An IDA pro jec t supporting sustainable forest management wou ld 
complement Guyana’s par t ic ipa t ion in the FCPF. T h i s IDA project would: (i) he lp 
strengthen the capacities o f na t iona l ins t i tu t ions in charge o f forest pro tec t ion and 
management; and (ii) support community-based forest management in i t ia t ives undertaken by 
loca l and indigenous communities. Overall, the pro jec t wou ld promote multipurpose forest 
management, inc lud ing new systems o f payments f o r carbon and other environmental 
services (water regu la t ion and b iod ivers i ty conservation). G iven the size o f the challenges 
and budget limitations, 
t h i s project wou ld wo rk o n a p i l o t scale and he lp develop 
methodologies that can later be replicated and scaled-up. The FCPF and IDA support might 
also be complemented by a possible grant f rom the Japanese Social Development Fund 
(JSDF) to promote commun i ty-dr iven enterprises in Guyana and, possibly, by a grant f r om 
the G loba l Env ironmen t Fac i l i ty (GEF) to protect forests and b iod ivers i ty and m i t iga te 
climate change. 

62. 
A l though the CAS comp le t ion repor t referred t o a lega l and po l icy framework that i s 
no t conducive to successful implementation o f projects in this area, implementation o f this 
CAS w i l l be different. The re a re strong signals o f Government commitment to 
strengthening environmental resilience and sustainability. Fo r example, after a long 
delay, the Forestry B i l l was passed in January 2009; and a climate change unit i s being 
established in t h e President’s O f f ice to fac i l i ta te continued leadership f r om the highest leve l 
in the imp lemen ta t ion o f Guyana’s l o w carbon g row th agenda. The unit w i l l p rov ide the 
framework at t h e na t iona l leve l fo r c l ima te change and guide the concerned agencies in 
implementation. I t w i l l also act as a c lear ing house fo r various international partnerships and 
ensure consistency in approach. The Bank has been requested to p rov ide advice and 
f inanc ia l support to this climate change unit and contribute to building i t s ins t i tu t iona l and 
technical strength.

63. 
The CAS includes analytical w o r k that covers the agr icu lture risk insurance 
management. Through t h i s work, the Bank wou ld be targeting small and vulnerable farmers, 
and p rov id ing the basis fo r med ium and long te rm e f for ts to reduce poverty, smooth 
consumption, and bring f isca l s tab i l i ty to the economy. 

64. 
T w o ongoing operations contribute to this pillar: A G loba l Env ironment Fac i l i ty 
(GEF) grant fo r the Conservancy Adaptation Project (2008, US$3.8 m i l l ion ) i s expected to 
support the Government in reducing vu lne rab i l i ty to coastal drainage and the lowe r ing the 
po ten t ia l fo r f lood ing throughout the region. In addition, a Bagasse Cogeneration Pro ject 
(2006, US$2.6 million), funded by the Commun i ty Development Carbon Fund and managed 
by the W o r l d Bank, aims at m i t iga t ing the g loba l c l ima te change by fac i l i ta t ing the use o f 
market-based mechanisms sanctioned under the K y o t o Pro toco l through support to clean 
energy projects in Guyana. In addition, IDA aims to collaborate w i t h I F C to support the 

16 

development o f renewable energy sources (hydropower) to fu r the r contribute to the country’s 
stated l o w carbon objectives. 

(ii) Imp rov ing education qua l ity and social safety nets. 
In the context o f the 
Government’s new Education Sector Strategy 2008-20 13, wh ich aims at imp rov ing the

T o build on the w o r k conducted in 2005 under the social pro tec t ion component o f the 
PSTAC project (wh ich l e d to an ac t ion plan adopted by Cabinet in 2006) , and ‘the 2008 
“Strengthening Caribbean Pensions” study, the Bank w i l l conduct a small, focused, on- 
demand program o f NLTA in Pensions, and Social Assistance. T h i s program w i l l no t 
duplicate, but complement ex is t ing w o r k already undertaken by the Government, and w i l l 
contribute to imp lemen t ing some recommendations o f t h e ex is t ing work. Unde r Pensions, 
the Bank intends to assist the Government, in the short-term, in developing a time-bound 
strategy to address the effects o f the f inanc ia l crisis; and in the medium-term, to strengthen 
t h e equity, adequacy and sustainability o f the Na t iona l Insurance Scheme, as well as i t s 
administration, investment po l icy , and compa t ib i l i ty w i t h the c i v i l service pension schemes 
(to enhance labor mob i l i ty) . Under the Social Assistance program, the Bank intends t o focus 
on strengthening t h e in fo rma t ion system and targeting capacity o f the Ministry o f Labour, 
Human Services and Social Security, in order to improve social service delivery. As part o f 
strengthening the targeting capacity, the assistance wou ld inc lude analytical wo rk t o assess 
social pro tec t ion needs o f the re la t ive ly poo r ly covered Amer ind ian population, with special 
attention to education and food sufficiency.

In the wake o f the g loba l f inanc ia l crisis, there w i l l be a need to reach the poorest o f 
t h e poor. Some ground w o r k i s already underway, such as the school feeding program under 
the EFA-FTI project. The project w i l l b e expanded f r om covering 57% o f primary school 
ch i ldren in regions 1, 7 , 8, and 9 , to eventually cover about 82% over the nex t three years. 
The Bank w i l l also he lp Guyana better target social safety net programs to reach the poorest

69. 
The international development community in Guyana includes, among others: IDB 
(37 percent o f O D A in 2001-2006); DFID (14 percent); USA (12 percent); E C (7 percent); 
IDA (6 percent); and C I D A and C D B (4 percent). The f u t u r e compos i t ion o f the donor 
community, and i t s re la t ive f inanc ia l and po l icy leveraging capacity, however, i s set to 
change. Due to the debt re l ie f , IDB i s reduc ing i t s 2009-2012 assistance f r om US$300 
m i l l i o n to US$120 m i l l ion . In addition, DFID and C I D A w i l l be mov ing towards reg iona l 
strategies supporting reg iona l integration. However, Guyana may qua l i fy fo r approximately 
US$200 m i l l i o n f r om the M i l l e n n i um Challenge Account, and i s experiencing a r ise in 
fore ign a id f r om new players, such as China, India, and PetroCaribe. The IMF ended i t s

IDB i s curren t ly t h e largest donor in Guyana. 
I t s disbursements f r om ongo ing

in Guyana consisted o f 19 loans to ta l ing US$389.6 m i l l ion , inc lud ing operations in economic 
growth, infrastructure, governance and pub l ic sector, and social sector. In December, 2008, 
IDB approved a US$15 m i l l i o n F inanc ia l Sector Re fo rm Programme a imed at modern iz ing 
the f inanc ia l sector and strengthening i t s supervision, and at imp rov ing access to credit. The 
po r t fo l io o f IDB’s new strategy includes projects and technical assistance in the areas of: (i) 
infrastructure (electricity, hydropower, transport); (ii) competitiveness (export diversification, 
financial sector reform, 
telecommunications, avoided deforestation); and (iii) social 
development (water and sanitation, low- income housing, basic nutrition, teehnical vocational 
education, qua l i ty o f social spending). The IDB i s also planning to imp lemen t a number o f 
technical assistance programs to address a number o f r i s k s related to: (i) the natural disasters 
and environment; (ii) macroeconomic vo la t i l i ty (debt sustainability paper, imp l ica t ions o f

71. 
Based o n IFA recommendations, the U S Government through the MC A /MCC w i l l 
focus on parliamentary f iduc ia ry oversight, the national procurement system, and tax re fo rm 
and administration. The E C i s a l loca t ing a substantial amount in i t s 10 th EDF to support 
p r io r i ty actions identified in the IFA, in collaboration w i t h WB, C I D A and IDB. 

72. 
Donor coordination can be improved in Guyana. I t i s curren t ly framed within a 
number o f thematic groups set up by the Government that are expected to focus o n sector 
strategies. Each thematic group has specific terms o f reference and i s supposed to meet 
regularly. T h i s mechanism o f fers an impor tan t fo rum fo r the donor commun i ty and the 
Government to achieve common goals and enhance donor harmonization but i t w i l l on ly be 
effective i f the Government ensures greater frequency in convening them. In addition, the 
en t ry o f many new donors who curren t ly do no t participate in the donor coordination 
mechanisms poses a challenge. M o r e e f f ic ien t alignment o f a id towards Government 
pr ior i t ies wou ld happen more read i ly i f fora existed fo r a l l donors to participate in. 

73. 
The W o r l d Bank team conducted a number o f upstream consultations with t h e 
Government and other development partners. The Government agreed with the CAS focus 

18 

and the proposed interventions. Consultations with t h e donor commun i ty served to identify 
synergies and possible areas o f collaboration. Further consultations with the Government, 
t h e pr iva te sector, and the c i v i l society took place in February, 2009 and con f irmed t h e 
alignment o f the CAS w i t h Government pr ior i t ies and the popu la t ion needs.

underserved v ia access to finance (MSMEs, Cred i t bureau, trade financing), supporting the

an area where IDA - I F C collaboration w i l l be enhanced. The I F C w i l l continue to promote

attention towards compliance with the Guyanese mining, lega l and regu la tory framework, 
c i v i l society participation, the r i g h t s o f indigenous people, and environmental impact. Given 
the importance o f the mining sector in Guyana, COCPO (IBRD Po l icy D iv is ion , Oil, Gas,

and Mining) w i l l wo rk closely with the I F C on these matters. COCPO w i l l also be ready to 
assist the Government in the Ex trac t ive Indus t r ies Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI) process, i f i t 
chooses to move in that d irec t ion and i f i t requests such assistance f rom the Bank. 
F. Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation 
80. 
Country-level systems fo r poverty, economic, and human development mon i to r ing 
are be ing strengthened through Government e f for ts and donor support. The Government i s 
establishing a national M&E coordinating unit within the Ministry o f Finance, and i s 
establishing M in is te r ia l Foca l Po in ts that wou ld mon i tor the PRSP implementation and i t s 
related social outcomes. Acco rd ing to the PRSP, e f for ts to build M&E capacity w i th in the 
M in is t r ies and to develop a Na t iona l Statistics Strategy are planned. The Bank w i l l use 
Government systems to mon i to r CAS outcomes in Education, where systems were assessed 
to be reasonably acceptable, and where capacity building e f for ts are ongoing in the context o f 
the Bank’s wo rk w i t h the Ministry o f Education. In Forestry, M&E capacity building w i l l be 
embedded in the lend ing operation and add i t iona l capacity building efforts w i l l be made as 
par t o f the support to the climate change unit in the President’s o f f ice . 

8 1. 
In addition, two ongoing operations are he lp ing to m i t iga te the risk o f weak statistical 
capacity: (i) I D B ’ s Social Statistics Project, wh ich i s curren t ly be ing evaluated with expected 
use fu l lessons fo r the W o r l d Bank as well; and (ii) the W o r l d Bank’s Na t iona l Statistics 
Strategy and Statistical Development Project. T h e latter i s a continuation o f earlier Bank 
M&E and statistics capacity building e f for ts under the Pub l ic Sector Technical Assistance 
Credit, and t h e Pover ty Reduc t ion and Pub l ic Management Operation. The Bank w i l l also 
learn f r om statistical development issues that are in fo rmed by the Na t iona l Statistics Strategy, 
and incorporate the lessons in imp lemen t ing the CAS. 

G. Managing Risks 
82. 
Based on lessons o f experience in imp lemen t ing the last CAS and f r om other donor 
experiences, and because o f the fact that CAS imp lemen ta t ion and achievement o f expected 
outcomes wou ld depend s ign i f ican t ly on the success o f partnering w i t h and leveraging other 
donors’ funds, the r i s k s associated w i t h this modest program are characterized as high. A 
mid-term C A S Progress Report i s scheduled fo r end 2010, wh ich w i l l a l low the Bank the 
chance to rev iew and adjust the strategy as necessary. 

. 

83. 
Policy Ownership and Commitment. The Government has demonstrated 
commitment to the current po l icy pa th as stated in the PRSP and demonstrated at the 
inaugural speech o f President Jagdeo to the Na t iona l Assembly in 2006. A t temp ts w i l l be 
made to ma in ta in a close dialogue with the Government, the opposition, and c i v i l society to 
ensure continued broad-based ownership o f the program. In addition, to m i t iga te t h i s risk, 
the C A S proposes the use o f a results-based mon i to r ing framework with broad-based support 
f r om the donors that wou ld act as a powe r fu l too l against po l icy slippage o r reversal, o r 
against a s lowdown in the implementation o f the strategy. 

84. 
Implementation Capacity. Capacity constraints rema in a ma jor issue in Guyana, 
par t icu lar ly given the p reva i l ing high em igra t ion rates across sectors. To m i t iga te t h i s r i s k , 
the CAS w i l l conduct a CPPR tw ice a year, w i t h systematic meetings with pro jec t 
coordination units. In addition, there w i l l be t igh ter coordination w i t h other development 
partners to avo id dup l ica t ion o f e f for ts and imp rove efficiency. T o address the weaknesses 
observed in the last CAS and in particular, the oversight ro le and frequent coord ina t ion with 
the Government, the Bank has recen t ly appointed a full t ime Representative in Guyana fo r a 

20 

per iod o f three years. In addition, capacity building efforts w i l l continue through the lending 
operations and technical assistance in collaboration w i t h other donors ( fo r example through 
jo in t missions). T o address the issue o f capacity constraints, the Government i s also wo rk ing 
on incen t ive measures to attract sk i l led personnel and re ta in them. Fo r example, in the hea l th 
sector, i t i s planning on using a performance-based incen t ive and p romo t ion system that 
wou ld a l low fo r higher remuneration under the employment o f autonomous Reg iona l Hea l th 
Authorities, in re turn fo r increased produc t iv i ty . 
In the education sector, the Bank i s 
supporting the Government w i th a new pro jec t to restructure i t s teacher t ra in ing system, with 
a particular emphasis on imp rov ing teacher qua l i ty and enhancing the capacity and e f f ic iency 
o f i t s tra in ing institutions. In addition, the EFA-FTI program provides professional g row th 
through special tra in ing fo r teachers, establishes learn ing resource centers in the hinterland, 
and improves conditions fo r teachers through prov is ion o f hous ing and incen t ive pay fo r 
those stationed in remote areas. I t i s expected that the new pro jec t combined with EFA-FTI’s 
ongoing support, wou ld contribute to generation and retention o f sk i l led personnel. 

8 5 . 

Fiduciary Risks, Accountability and Governance. W h i l e the recent IFA indicates 
significant progress in the f iduc ia ry and accountability frameworks, many challenges in the 
area o f accountability and transparency rema in (see paragraphs 37-42). T h i s i s an area where 
coordinated actions w i t h other development partners cou ld accelerate the strengthening o f the 
f iduc iary set up and reduce r i s k s . T h e Bank w i l l participate in, and support the func t ion ing o f 
the planned wo rk ing group o f donors active in pub l ic f inanc ia l management and procurement, 
wh ich wou ld p rov ide a fo rum fo r donor assistance in support o f strengthening accountability 
and governance in Guyana. As part o f the IFA, the Bank w i l l he lp the Government prepare 
t h e Terms o f Reference fo r developing and costing the p r io r i ty items to be inc luded in their 
action plan, based o n the weaknesses iden t i f ied by IFA. The f ina l iza t ion o f the IFA ac t ion 
plan i s an impor tan t milestone in EU’s assistance to Guyana in 2009. 

86. 

As stated in i t s PRSP, the Government w i l l imp lemen t sustainable re forms in 
governance, to improve transparency and accountability. Ongo ing e f for ts to enhancing 
f iduc iary oversight are already in place with IDB support. The Government allocated 
resources in the 2009 budget fo r the strengthening o f in terna l con tro l systems, enhancing 
in terna l audit systems, and strengthening procurement and expenditure management systems. 
In addition, i t w i l l continue i t s wo rk on strengthening t h e Audit O f f ice ’s capabilities in the 
areas o f performance audit, forensic audit, and audit qua l i ty assurance. 

87. 

Insufficient Donor Coordination and Donor funding. T h i s C A S re l ies heav i ly on 
an enhanced d iv is ion o f responsibilities among Guyana’s development partners. The success 
o f the strategy w i l l therefore depend on key complementary support f r om other donors. 
There are also r i s k s inherent in this strategy, as i t relies heav i ly on leveraging t r u s t fund and 
other donors’ contributions. De lays o r poo r qua l i ty outcomes o f other partners cou ld affect 
the implementation o f the strategy. The C A S expects to reduce the r i s k by consu l t ing and 
coordinating closely w i t h donors during the implementation period. T h i s objective w i l l be 
facilitated by the recent appointment o f the full t ime Bank Representative in Guyana as 
indicated above. 

88. 

Political Instability. 
Po l i t ica l ins tab i l i ty due to d iv is ion a long ethnic l ines has 
diminished in recent years but the rema in ing tensions cou ld delay reforms. 
T h e 
Government’s PRSP acknowledges that this i s a risk, and that managing the po l i t ica l process 
through implementation o f the governance po l ic ies may he lp build na t iona l consensus to 
implement i t s strategy. The Government i s in the process o f “deepening a democratic 
culture” and p rov id ing opportunities fo r con f l ic t resolution. Fo r example, re forms are 

21 

currently taking place at the leg is la t ive branch o f the Government to a l low t h e parliamentary 
opposition to p lay a more proactive ro le in i t s oversight o f the executive. The CAS w i l l build 
continued dialogue, in collaboration with other donors, and w i l l emphasize strong support fo r 
the disadvantaged (such as the Amerindians). 

89. 
C r i m e and Secur ity . G iven the Bank’s l im i ted resources, i t w i l l r e l y o n IDB’s 
ongo ing w o r k on “Citizen Security”, and o n DFID’s “Security Sector Re form” to m i t iga te 
this risk. 

90. 
Exogenous R i s k s . Some o f these r i s k s inc lude commod i ty pr ice vo la t i l i ty , particular 
to agriculture and bauxite, and systemic c l ima te shocks. The CAS w i l l re ly on a 
comprehensive pub l ic sector strategy to manage and transfer such catastrophic exogenous 
r isks , using market based instruments, enhancing the e f f ic iency o f pub l ic resources, and 
a l low ing the Government to respond to such p r ice shocks and natural disasters. The 
expansion o f CCR IF to address excess ra in fa l l (wh ich Guyana i s more vulnerable to) i s 
currently be ing explored by the Bank and, i f viable, wou ld be an impor tan t m i t iga t ing 
measure. To he lp the Government m i t iga te the impac t o f the g loba l economic crisis o n 
remittances, the Bank proposes to partner with the IDB in i t s analytical wo rk on the 
“Macroeconomic Impac t o f Remittances”.

I. THE CASSTRATEGYAND OBJECTIWS 

2. 

Guyana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) o f 2001 ou t l ined a program o f 
fundamental re forms to re-orient i t s economic and social po l ic ies towards pover ty reduc t ion 
and the achievement o f the M i l l e n n i um Development Goals (MDGs). T h i s po l icy framework, 
wh ich resulted f r om w ide pub l ic consultations and benefits f r om strong donor support, rests 
on seven key pillars: 
broad-based, jobs-generating economic growth; 
environmental protection; 
0 stronger ins t i tu t ions and better governance; 
investment in human capital, w i t h emphasis on basic education and health; 
investment in phys ica l capital; 
0 improved safety nets; and 
0 special in terven t ion programs to address reg iona l pockets o f poverty. 

3. 

The 2001 PRSP remains the strategic program o f the Government. However, a 
revised PRSP i s under preparation and i s expected to be issued t h i s year. 

4. 

The 2002 CAS i s focused o n p rov id ing support fo r the po l icy re fo rm agenda o f the 
PRSP and on he lp ing the authorities increase the coherence o f the overa l l donor effort. 
Previous experience with pro jec t lend ing in Guyana had been very uneven. Projects were 
small and t h u s re la t ive ly costly, imp lemen ta t ion was d i f f icu l t because o f inadequate loca l 
capacity, procurement invo lved too much Cabinet involvement, and projects o f ten fa i led to 
address major po l icy issues. In addition, there were many other donors, inc lud ing the IDB, 
already p rov id ing project assistance, and IDA ’S a l loca t ion was re la t ive ly small. 
The Bank therefore concluded that IDA’S comparative advantage in Guyana seemed 
to be in t e rm s o f po l icy dialogue. In keep ing with Bank po l icy and the then recen t ly 
announced Pover ty Reduc t ion Support Cred i t (PRSC) vehicle, t h e C A S proposed a 

5 .

fundamental sh i f t away f rom pro jec t lend ing t o a program o f PRSCs -- a series o f single 
tranche credits that were part o f a longer t e r m program in support o f Guyana’s pover ty 
strategy. T h e strategy wou ld be supported with technical assistance to help implement the 
reforms, and augmented by Bank and core Economic and Sector W o r k to he lp re f ine the 
po l icy agenda and mon i tor and evaluate t h e impac t o f t h e PRSP. 

6 . 
The CAS focused on the fo l low ing pillars o f t h e PRSP: (i) broad-based, jobs- 
generating economic growth; (ii) stronger ins t i tu t ions and better governance; and (iii) 
investment in human capital, with emphasis o n basic education and health. However, in many 
areas t h e CAS ou t l ined a po l icy agenda that went beyond the scope and de ta i l found in the 
PRSP, and reflected on-going w o r k done by the Bank in key sectors. The CAS was 
in f luenced by the evo lv ing content o f PRSC-I, wh ich was then under discussion with the 
Government as the CAS was be ing prepared. In the water and sugar sectors, the PRSC 
inc luded actions wh ich were o r ig ina l ly designed to be part o f pro jec t operations. Other areas 
were iden t i f ied as be ing c r i t ica l to implementation o f the PRSP, even i f they were no t 
iden t i f ied in detail in the PRSP. 

7. 

Progress in Mee t ing CAS Objectives 
The overa l l development objective o f the CAS i s g iven as to “help create conditions 
fo r a sustained reduc t ion o f pover ty levels in the country”. The CAS ou t l ined the longer term 
po l icy program to be su por ted by programmatic lending, and iden t i f ied a number o f CAS 
performance indicators. I f : These indicators are a b lend o f actual indicators and p o l i c y steps, 
so that they become in rea l i ty a l i s t o f key steps expected that can be used to make an overa l l 
judgment on CAS progress. T o this l i s t we have added tke pover ty rate indicator, since 
pover ty was the overr id ing C A S objective. The b o x be low gives a summary o f progress on 
these indicators, fo r t h e per iod 2003-2008, w e l l beyond the o r ig ina l C A S period. Overall, 
look ing at ten indicators, we judge that four were completed satisfactorily, tw o were pa r t ia l ly 
completed, and fou r were no t completed at all. The prime development goa l o f the CAS, the 
reduction in poverty, was no t achieved. Poverty rates in 2006 were v i r tua l ly the same as in 
2002. Nevertheless, inequa l i ty seems to have been reduced between 1992 and 2006 and 
Guyana remains a country with re la t ive ly l o w inequa l i ty 1 9 , Pos i t ive results have been 
achieved in the areas o f macro management, imp rov ing pub l ic f inanc ia l management, and 
increasing social spending. Areas o f improvement include, besides the pover ty rate, the 
needed enactment o f a me thod fo r budget allocations to schools, t h e reduc t ion in the AIDS 
prevalence rate, and the preparation o f progress reports on the PRSP that are based on regular 
consultation with c i v i l society. On t h i s basis, we rank the overa l l performance o f the C A S as 
marg ina l ly unsatisfactory. T h i s ra t ing reflects the large gap between the high expectations o f 
t h e CAS, and l im i t e d achievement, even after extending the C A S pe r iod f r om three to six 
years. Nevertheless, some substantial progress was made in a number o f areas, as w i l l be 
discussed below. 

In fact, the CAS has two lists o f performance indicators. One in the text @24) and another in Annex Table A2 wh ich are 
completely different. The discussion here focuses on the indicators in the text.

lower than other L A C HIF’C countries, and inequality is l e s severe.

Assessment o f PRS Implementation. As noted in the two PRS Progress Reports 
and accompanying Joint S ta f f Adv iso ry No tes (JSANs), Guyana has made progress in 
imp lemen t ing i t s PRS, but achievements f e l l short o f expectations. Despite a d i f f icu l t 
domestic and external environment, macroeconomic s tab i l i ty was maintained and progress 
was made in imp lemen t ing structural reforms, but Guyana's g row th has been weaker than

projected. Poverty in Guyana has been dec l in ing in the last 15 years. However, pover ty 
decreased at a fast rate during 1992-1999 and seems to have stagnated afterwards. Progress 
on pover ty reduction in remote areas in the ru ra l in ter ior has been slow. Modera te progress 
has been achieved in bo th urban and ru ra l coastal areas and in bo th the Afro-Guyanese and 
Indo-Guyanese communities. Amerindians living in remote ru ra l in ter ior areas, about 9.2 
percent o f the to ta l population, s t i l l register extremely high pover ty rates (around 77%). In 
t e rm s o f social indicators, o f the 29 PRS goals, on ly 9 were attained o r exceeded. An MDG 
report prepared in 2007 reported that Guyana may no t reach 3 o f the 11 domestic target areas 
cover ing Goals 1 to 7. However, budgetary allocations fo r the social sectors have been high 
and (about 20 percent o f GDP) exceeded the H IPC target by 5.0 percent po in ts in 2007. 

P i l la r I. Stimulating growth 
Goal: Adequate macroeconomic stability performance under the agreed medium-term 
economic framework. 
Result: Accomplished. 
10. 
Between 2002 and 2006 the Government implemented a macroeconomic program 
supported by the IMF through SDR54.55 m i l l i o n Poverty Reduc t ion and G row th Fac i l i ty 
(PRGF). Guyana’s economic performance was considered good by the IMF, with on ly m ino r 
delays in PRGF disbursements. 

11. 

G row th performance has been mixed. F rom 2003 to 2005 GDP g row th averaged -0.3, 
re f lec t ing increased o i l prices, na tura l disasters, the winding down o f produc t ion o f Guyana’s 
largest go ld m ine and the deteriorating security situation. However, the g row th rate 
accelerated to 5.1 percent in 2006 and 5.4 percent in 2007. The persistence o f weak g row th 
in early part o f t h i s per iod po in ts to more fundamental structural weaknesses, name ly a poor 
investment climate and high em igra t ion o f entrepreneurial s k i l l s , weak governance, and 
inadequate basic infrastructure. The recent improvement in g row th i s be ing l e d by re la t ive ly 
strong performance in the mining, construction and agricultural sectors. The manufacturing 
sector i s also showing s igns o f recovery. 

12. 

T h e f isca l de f ic i t has increased since 2002, to accommodate much needed 
investments to modernize the sugar industry and to improve infrastructure. Expenditure 
g row th also was a func t ion o f f loods in 2005, and the decision to build a large stadium to 
h o l d the cricket w o r l d cup in 2006 (partly financed with fore ign assistance). The overa l l 
Government de f ic i t after grants increased f r om 5.8 percent o f GDP in 2002 t o 13.6 in 2005, 
and declined to 7.6 percent o f GDP in 2007. The recent improvement in the f isca l balance 
re f lec t a stronger revenue effort, no tab ly through improved adm in is tra t ion and the 
in troduc t ion o f value added tax in January 2007, as w e l l as containment o f expenditure 
though improved p r io r i t iza t ion o f the Pub l ic Sector Investment Program (PSIP). However 
in f la t ion , wh ich had been averaging on ly 6-7 percent per year, increased to 12% in 2007, and 
i s l i k e l y to climb even h igher in 2008 as a result o f the impac t o f sp ira l ing costs o f food and 
fuel.

13. 
Guyana’s debt sustainability improved dramatically since 2002. The coun try reached 
the Enhanced H I PC (e-HIPC) Comp le t ion Po in t in December 2003 qua l i fy ing fo r US$329 
m i l l i o n o f debt r e l i e f in NPV terms, additional to the debt r e l i e f o f US$256 m i l l i o n in NPV 
terms obtained under t h e or ig ina l H I P C in M a y 1999. A l though the external debt burden as 
measured b y the NPV o f external debt to revenue ra t io declined f o l l ow i n g the e-HIPC 
Comp le t ion Point, debt sustainability concerns re-emerged in 2004 and were on ly eased after 

3 9 

t h e implementation o f the MDRI”. Abou t US$611 m i l l i o n o f Guyana debt has been wr i t ten 
o f f by the IMF, W o r l d Bank and the In ter-Amer ican Development Bank. 

Goal: Fiscal Reform, including introduction o f consolidated, program budgeting with a 
medium term framework, implementation of a multi-year formulaic mechanism for 
determining public sector wage increases, and initiation of a comprehensive tax reform 
program. 
Results: Partially Accomplished. 
14. 
Some progress has been made during t h e CAS pe r iod in imp rov ing the budget 
process. In 2007, fo r the f i r s t time, inc luded a three-year forecast o f f isca l aggregates, but 
there i s no detailed M e d i um Te rm Expenditure Framework (MTEF). A lmos t a l l m in is tr ies 
and the 10 regions have program budgets, but the use o f realistic performance indicators 
remains very weak. L ikew ise , the goal o f integrating capital and recurrent expenditures has 
on ly j u s t begun w i t h an integrated budget c ircu lar cover ing bo th recurrent and capital 
spending, and a single integrated budget hearing fo r each ministry cover ing bo th capital and 
recurrent estimates ( fo r the 2009 budget). Investment decisions are no t l inked to sector 
strategies. An integrated f inanc ia l management and accounting system ( I F M A S ) 
to 
interconnect the Government’s f inanc ia l management and accounting systems, and con tro l 
overa l l pub l ic expenditures has been implemented. However, the system s t i l l has 
shortcomings, and i s cr ipp led by the rap id turnover o f trained staff. The capital budget i s 
supposed to be prepared within the framework o f a r o l l i n g five-year Pub l ic Sector Investment 
Program but the PSIP has no t been produced on a t ime ly basis. 

15. 
A formu la fo r pub l ic sector wage increases was agreed (cond i t ion o f PRSC), under 
wh ich pub l ic sector wages wou ld fully adjust fo r in f la t ion , plus have a p roduc t iv i ty 
component in years with pos i t ive GDP growth. In fact, wage increases have no t kep t pace 
w i t h in f la t ion , par t icu lar ly in 2007 when wages were increased by on ly 9% despite 12% 
in f la t ion . 

16. 
In August 2003, the Government in i t ia ted a med ium- term re fo rm program to broaden 
the tax base and increase efficiency, equity and transparency o f the tax system. M a i n actions 
completed include: (1) adoption by Parliament o f the value-added tax (VAT) and excise tax 
regulations in January 2006; (2) e l im ina t ion o f the Ministry o f Finance’s power to grant 
discretionary tax exemptions, (3) a limit on most income tax holidays;(4) 
increases in 
w i thho ld ing taxes, consumption taxes fo r certain services and personal income tax 
thresholds, and (5) a program fo r strengthening the Guyana Revenue Au tho r i ty . 

Goal: Strengthen the framework fo r private investment, including the enactment o f a 
new Investment Law. 
Results: Partially Accomplished. 

17. 

As a step to imp rove t h e environment fo r pr iva te investment, the PRSP envisaged 
reforms to strengthen the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l environment fo r investment. Ins t i tu t iona l and 
lega l steps completed inc lude the appointment o f a new ch ie f executive fo r investment 
promo t ion agency (GOINVEST). An Investment Act, prepared w i t h Bank’s support (IFC), 
and a Sma l l Bus iness A c t were passed by Parliament in Ma rch 2004. This new leg is la t ion 
establishes basic guarantees and rights fo r investors (e.g. against expropriation) and makes

incentives more transparent. A Compe t i t ion and Fa i r Trad ing Bill, wh ich establishes a 
Na t iona l Compe t i t ion Commission, was passed by Parliament in 2006. A Na t iona l 
Competitiveness Strategy was formulated in consultation with the pr iva te sector and donors 
and a program o f 122 needed actions were identified. Some actions are being implemented as 
part o f an IDB project and as part o f the program fo r the U .S . M C A (M i l lenn ium Challenge 
Account). 
18. 
Despite recent measures taken to imp rove the investment climate, significant factors 
continue to constrain pr iva te sector development and Guyana's competitiveness. At the 
request o f the Government, an Investment C l ima te Assessment ( ICA ) was f ina l ized after t h e 
CAS pe r iod in 2007. Accord ing to the IC A , in add i t ion to the d i f f icu l t security and cr ime 
situation, there are impediments to clearing goods through customs (e.g. exporters spend an 
average o f 14 days in customs with a max imum t ime o f 23 days), and the lega l and jud ic ia l 
systems are cumbersome and jud ic ia l enforcement i s lengthy. 
Infrastructure i s a serious 
bo t t leneck Guyana lacks a deep-water port, i t s road system i s deficient, electric power i s 
unreliable and expensive, and telecommunications services are l im i ted . Qualified workers 
and managers are scarce because o f emigration. 

Goal: Imp lement the agreed modernization and investment strategy for the sugar 
sector, 
including the eventual restructur ing o f the Guyana Sugar Corporat ion 
(GWSUCO) to achieve prof itab i l ity targets w i th agreed financing plan. 
Results: Pa r t ia l ly Accomplished. 
19. 
Sugar accounts fo r 16 percent o f GDP, 25 percent o f fore ign exchange earnings, and 
d irec t ly o r ind i rec t ly affects the l ive l ihoods o f over 75,000 people. The Bank, wo rk ing with 
D f D and other donors, helped the Government construct a comprehensive program to 
restructure the sugar sector. T h i s program continues Government ownership o f industry 
assets wh i le relying on pr iva te sector management o f the Guyana Sugar Corpora t ion 
( G W S U C O ) and increasing the share o f pr iva te ly-grown cane. One o f the ma jo r elements 
o f this strategy consists o f p lac ing emphasis o n produc t ion in the Berb ice area, through a 
new, larger sugar m i l l in Skeldon, capable o f produc ing 110,000-120,000 tons o f sugar per 
year, a long with expansion o f sugar cane cu l t iva t ion by some 10,000 hectares. In 2006 the 
Government presented to the EU an Ac t ion P lan de ta i l ing the sector restructuring program to 
qua l i fy fo r EU f inanc ia l support. 

20. 

A f te r in i t ia l delays, t h e implementation o f the p lan has gained pace and re forms are 
on track. W i t h Bank's support (through PRSC), GUYSUCO implemented measures to 
strengthen i t s f inanc ia l v iab i l i ty , inc lud ing by in t roduc ing a new wage po l icy limiting wage 
increases to in f la t ion startin f rom 2001, and imp lemen t ing a pro f i t-or ien ted management 
contract in February 2004 . However, the projected labor force downsizing, and the 
p ro f i tab i l i ty targets fo r G W S U C O have no t yet been attained, although more progress may 
be made t h i s year with t h e comp le t ion o f the new sugar mill. G W S U C O i s n ow able to 
cover i t s operating costs w i thou t Government subsidy.

21. 

The Bank also supported the preparation and implementation o f an Env ironmen ta l 
Management P lan (EMF') fo r the new sugar mill and associated canefields expansion. In 
particular, the EMP now requires that G W S U C O manage some 7,500 hectares o f freshwater 
swamp and ree f forest (conservancy areas) in a manner that w i l l m i t iga te the na tura l habitat

Goal: Introduct ion o f a new regulatory f ramewo rk for m in ing and forestry. 
Results: N o t Accomplished 
23. 
The development and use o f Guyana’s considerable mining and forestry resources are 
c r i t ica l fo r Guyana’s f u t u r e exports and growth. However, development o f mining and 
forestry resources needs to be pursued o n a sustainable basis. The Government was expected 
to draft and table in Parliament a new Mining B i l l imp rov ing the regu la tory environment fo r 
the mining sector ( inc lud ing issues such as environmental impact, taxation, and the rights o f 
Amer ind ian communities). T h e Bank prov ided technical assistance fo r the preparation o f a 
Strategic Env ironmen ta l Assessment (SEA) o f the mining sector to serve as a basis fo r the 
dra f t ing o f the new legislation. However, the submission to Parliament has been repeatedly 
delayed. 

24. 
The forestry sector i s also g row ing fast, boosted by pr iva te investment. Adequate 
controls to prevent over-harvesting, to m in im ize environmental damage, and to recognize the 
land claims o f indigenous people are hence crucial. Ex is t ing leg is la t ion ( f rom 1953) does no t 
adequately ensure that these objectives are me t and does no t prov ide the pr iva te sector with a 
clear regulatory environment. I t was expected that the Government wou ld approve a new 
Forestry A c t during t h e C A S per iod wh ich wou ld substantially imp rove the lega l basis fo r 
sustainable management o f Guyana’s forests, including clear delineation o f the rights o f 
Amer ind ian communities. A dra f t b i l l was submitted to Parliament in early 2006, but never 
brought to a vote24. Parliament did pass a l aw reorganizing the Forestry Commission, but 
this has had on ly m ino r impac t on the sector. 

25. Wh i le these two reforms, mining and forestry were high on the Bank’s p r i o r i t y l i s t , 
they were no t a high p r io r i ty fo r the Government, and w i thou t strong Government support 
languished, despite Bank pressure. Pre l im inary w o r k was a cond i t ion o f PRSC-I, wh i le 
PRSC-I1 (subsequently renamed PRPMO) was to have been cond i t iona l on passage o f the 
forestry act. In fact, the Bank accepted the submission o f the act to Parliament, and did no t 
push fo r pos i t ive measures on mining. 

Goal: Introduce a new lega l and inst itut iona l framework in the water sector, inc lud ing 
passage o f a new water bill and introduct ion o f pr ivate management to the newly- 
consolidated water utility. 
Results: Pa r t ia l ly Accomplished 
26. 
The Government has undertaken a ma jor reorganization o f the water sector with 
support o f IDA (PRSC-I) and DFID, setting up a new lega l and regulatory framework, 
merg ing the two pub l ic water companies in to one (Guyana Water Inc., GWI) i n d bringing in 
a pr iva te operator under a management contract. The Government also launched a program 
to increase service access, par t icu lar ly in urban squatter neighborhoods and ru ra l hinterlands. 

24 This was updated in the core text o f the CAS (see paragraph 62). The Forestry B i l l was passed in January 2009. 

42 

GWI began imp lemen t ing a combined plan to increase revenues and reduce costs, through a 
2005 tariff review, 
the procurement o f a new billing system, 
improved co l lec t ion 
performance, and reduc t ion in non-revenue water through d is tr ibu t ion ne twork repair and 
rehabilitation. These e f for ts and t h e Government’s goal o f achieving universal access to safe 
water are be ing supported by the ongoing IDA Water Sector Consolidation Project approved

access. The utility has been hampered by s t a f f a t t r i t ion to the p r iva te sector due to an 
inab i l i ty to pay compe t i t ive wages. Progress in imp lemen t ing the Bank’s Water Supply 
Technical Assistance and Rehab i l i ta t ion Project was impeded by the lack o f donor 
coordination characterized by uncoordinated standards, overlapping investments, and a lack 
o f coherent strategy.

27 . 

Goal: 
Public procurement reform, including new legislation and regulations, and 
implementation o f the agreed CPAR Action Plan 
Results: Partially Accomplished. 
In 1999, the Bank carried out a Coun try Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). 
T h e implementation o f the action plan that resulted f r om the C P AR recommendations was 
supported by the Bank through the PRSC and PSTAC. The ru les governing pub l ic 
procurement were revised by t h e 2002 Na t iona l Procurement Act, wh ich was subsequently 
amended by t h e Tender and Procurement A c t o f 2003. T h e PRPMO supported the adoption 
o f regulations and the preparation o f standard bidding documents and evaluation cr i ter ia in 
l ine w i t h international standards. 

28. 

The 2003 Procurement A c t provides t h e basis fo r imp rov ing regulatory, oversight o f 
operations, and complaint management functions. Overburdened by too many functions, and 
inadequate trained staff, the Na t iona l Procurement and Tender Adm in is tra t ion (NPTA) i s 
unable to pe r fo rm i t s ro le in regu la t ing procurement practices and insuring op t ima l use o f 
Government resources, as envisioned by the Procurement Ac t . 

29. 

The Bank’s PSTAC prov ided substantial technical assistance fo r writing o f the 
operational guidelines and training o f NPTA staff, The impac t o f much o f this good wo rk 
has been m i t iga ted by s t a f f attrition. O f 7 people trained in NPTA, on ly 4 are presently s t i l l 
on the staff. Government salaries fo r technical s t a f f cannot ma tch their alternatives in the 
private sector, either in Guyana or abroad. Despite considerable work, the development o f 
standard bidding documents and operational manuals has no t been completed. As par t o f the 
recent Integrated F iduc ia ry Assessment2’, a Procurement System Assessment Report (PSAR) 
was untaken using standard O E C D D A C lW o r l d Bank methodology. T h e PSAR rated 
Guyana’s procurement system as “moderately low ” in terms o f leg is la t ive and regu la tory 
framework, and “very 
low ” 
in terms o f ins t i tu t iona l framework, operations, and 
integrity/transparency . 26

Goal: Improve public sector financial management, including enactment o f a new audit 
law, strengthening o f the Auditor General function, and implementation o f agreed 
CFAA Action Plan aimed at improving oversight o f public expenditures. 
Results: Partially Accomplished 
30. 
The Coun try F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA), completed in 2002, 
considered Guyana's pub l ic audit and f inanc ia l management systems and processes as basic 
and fragmented. 
I t po in ted to a number o f c r i t ica l weaknesses in budgeting, accounting, 
audit and oversight o f the Government's finance. Recommendations were adopted by the 
Government through an action plan. Since 2003, the leg is la t ive and regulatory in i t ia t ives 
have addressed prev ious ly iden t i f ied systems and framework weaknesses. 

3 1. With Bank's support (PRPMO), a new Audit A c t was enacted by Parliament in April 
2004.27 The Aud i t O f f ice o f Guyana (AOG) has begun imp lemen t ing international aud i t ing 
standards and aud i t ing methodologies to pe r fo rm operational, performance, and forensic 
audits. F inanc ia l controls and audits have improved with the in troduc t ion o f the Integrated 
F inanc ia l Management System ( I FM A S ) , although gaps remain. Only four m in is tr ies have an 
in terna l audit capacity. The A O G was able to de l iver an audit op in ion o n the 2004 and 2005 
Government financial statements. The 2007 IFA no ted that the 2003 and 2004 AG reports 
have no t ye t been rev iewed by the Pub l ic Accounts Committee o f the Parliament, even 
though they were submitted in September o f 2006. 
32. 
Unde r PRSC-I, and o n the basis o f the C F A A recommendations, measures were 
introduced to strengthen f iduc iary oversight, wh ich has three elements: (i) ensuring e f fec t ive 
parliamentary oversight over pub l ic finances; (ii) cu r ta i l ing discretionary powers o f pub l ic 
o f f ic ia ls ; and (iii) ensuring effective pub l ic disclosure o f assets o f o f f ic ia ls . 
In 2005, 
consultants financed by the PSTAC prepared studies on each o f these elements. As a result o f 
the f i r s t study on Parliamentary oversight**, the legislature has mod i f ied some 15-20 standing 
orders, wh ich g ives the opposition more oppor tun i ty to exercise oversight roles o n f inanc ia l 
matters. This has improved i t s oversight ro le over the execution o f the budget through 
leg is la t ive rev iew o f the external audit reports, and by questioning responsible parties about 
the findings f rom the  report^.^' 

33. 
As noted above, steps have been taken to reduce t h e discretionary powe r o f 
Government o f f ic ia ls as part o f the overa l l tax re form . These invo lve limits on gran ts o f tax 
exemptions and tax holidays. However, much more s t i l l needs to be done in t h i s area. In 
addition, n o progress has been made in the area ensuring e f fec t ive pub l ic disclosure o f the 
assets o f pub l ic officials. 
Goal: Implement local Government reform. 
Result: Not Accomplished. 
34. 
PRSP consultations emphasized some shortcomings related to the weak leve l o f loca l 
Government services. Ac t ions planned under the PRSC -1- in support o f t h e PRSP agenda 
inc luded improvements in the fiscal framework fo r transfers and building the capacity fo r 
revenue mob i l iza t ion at loca l levels. L i t t l e progress was made in these aspects o f the reform. 
Some m ino r steps were taken to imp rove the system o f tax assessments, and imp rove the 
ab i l i ty o f loca l Governments to seize proper ty o f tax defaulters as part o f PRSC-1. However,

the actions contemplated fo r PRSC-2 in th is area were no t inc luded in the fo l low -on P W M O , 
because o f the need to increase selectivity. The Government focused o n the creation o f 
institutions, no tab ly the establishment o f t h e Mun ic ipa l Services Department in t h e Ministry 
o f Loca l Government and Regional Development and the appointment o f e igh t Reg iona l 
Development O f f icers 
to mon i tor and evaluate capital contracts within Reg iona l 
Development Councils. Loca l Government elections have no t been he ld in over tw o decades, 
and have been scheduled fo r 2008. I f they take place, they might he lp push fo rwa rd the loca l 
Government re fo rm agenda. However, loca l Government elections have been promised and 
canceled in t h e past (2004,2007). 

Goal: Establish framework fo r effective monitoring and evaluation o f PRSP 
implementation. 
Result: Not Accomplished. 
35. 
A Po l icy Coordination and Program Management Unit (PCPRMU) was set up in the 
O f f ice o f the President in 2003 (PSTAC, PRSC) to coordinate and mon i to r the pover ty 
reduction strategy, support the implementation o f structural reforms, coordinate and support 
the implementation o f social statistics strengthening activities, conduct po l icy analysis in 
support o f the PRS and produce the annual PRS progress report. The Government also set up 
the ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r mon i to r ing and evaluation. A plan fo r strengthening the 
Statistics Bureau i s being carried out with the support o f the PSTAC and a W o r l d Bank 
TFSCB grant.30 However, there i s s t i l l no system fo r track ing budget expenditure that wou ld 
perm i t mon i to r ing o f Government programs by sector and by ma jor poverty-related programs 
and i n f o rm the budget preparation process. In addition, the PC PRMU was disbanded after 
the PSTAC funding ended in 2007. T h i s seriously reduced the Government’s ab i l i ty to 
prepare the new PRSP, as w e l l as the PSIP, and to implement the planned PRSP mon i to r ing 
system. 

P i l la r III: Improving delivety and quali@ of basic sewices and safety nets 
Goal: Increase access by the poor to quality education. 
Result: Accomplished 
36. 
The Government’s Strategic P lan fo r Education (SPE) fo r 2003-07 emphasized the 
twin goals o f ra is ing access and increasing the qua l i ty o f education services. K e y goals 
inc lude improved teacher training, imp roved ratios o f trained teachers to students, reduced 
drop-out rates, and better facilities. Secondary education re fo rm was supported v i a the 
Bank’s Secondary Education Re fo rm pro jec t (1996-2004, I C R outcome ra t ing =S). 
addition, PRSC- 1 supported some basic re forms in education designed to decentralize con t ro l 
to the school and commun i ty leve l . Guyana i s one o f the 17 countries rece iv ing assistance in 
i t s education re fo rm as part o f the Educa t ion Fo r A l l-Fas t Track In i t ia t ive (EFA-FTI). 
Guyana has received three g r a n t s so far under the EFA-FTI, based on progress made under 
the program. Ac t ions in the third year o f implementation o f the EFA-FTI focused o n 
imp lemen t ing a community-based school-feeding program at the primary leve l and upgrad ing 
hinterland schools. T h i s complements the remote areas incen t ive payment scheme launched 
by t h e Government in 2005 to he lp re ta in teachers by topp ing up the hard-living allowance. 

In 

37. 
Guyana i s set to reach the MDG goals fo r education, and outcomes in 2005 were 
broad ly in l i n e with PRSP targets. The country achieved 100 percent p r ima ry school

45 

enrolment in 2004 and steady progress was made year after year towards achieving full 
attainment o f secondary school enrolment, although some reg iona l disparities persist. Guyana 
also achieved good results in t h e number o f ch i ldren reaching Grade 6, with a national 
average o f about 95 percent, although there are some significant reg iona l deviations. 
However, repe t i t ion and drop out rates in secondary school rema in high and qua l i ty 
indicators are also be low expectations. Despite tra in ing more than 4,838 teachers over the 
past f ive years, student trained teacher ratios at a l l levels o f education continue to be high, 
par t icu lar ly in primary education. Em ig ra t ion o f trained teachers continues to be a serious 
prob lem that undercuts teacher tra in ing efforts. In addition, the formu la based system fo r the 
a l loca t ion o f resources to schools, wh ich was introduced o n a t r ia l basis as part o f PRSC- I , 
has never been generalized to the rest o f the country. 

Goal: Imp rove the efficiency o f social assistance programs. 
Result: N o t Accomplished. 
38. 
Guyana implements a range o f social insurance and social assistance programs, many 
o f wh ich are administered by the Ministry o f Labor, Human Services and Social Security 
(M LHSSS ) . Guyana’s social pro tec t ion system i s characterized by: (i) lack o f an adequate 
targeting mechanism and criteria; (ii) l o w bene f i t levels; (iii) understaffing and outdated and 
ine f f ic ien t service de l ivery systems; (iv) manual record ing o f program records and 
deficiencies in the documentation o f procedures and f inanc ia l management; and (v) outdated 
social security leg is la t ion vi) dup l ica t ion and overlapping benefits. The ma jo r thrust o f the 
Government’s e f for ts i s to strengthen i t s capacity through improved systems, processes and 
tra in ing to better manage i t s ex is t ing social pro tec t ion programs, before expanding them o r 
starting new ones. T o this end, the Government has carried out, with support f r om IDA 
(PRSC-1 and PSTAC), 
fou r studies that prov ided recommendations in the areas o f 
management in fo rma t ion system, targeting, r i s k and vulnerability, labor market assessment, 
social legislation, and M L H S S S needs assessment. However, l i t t l e has been done to 
implement the findings o f the studies and these social programs continue to be bad ly 
administered. 

Goal: Address the spread o f HIV/AIDS. 
Result: Accomplished 
39. 
The PRSC supported the preparation o f the Na t iona l P lan fo r H I V / A I D S (2002-06). 
A new Na t iona l H I V / A I D S Strategic P lan (2007-1 1) prepared through a broad consultative 
process invo lv ing key stakeholders in Government, c i v i l society and external donors and 
mu l t i- la tera l agencies, i s under implementation. T h i s program i s be ing supported by the 
Guyana HN-AIDS Prevention and Con tro l project wh ich i s financed by a n IDA grant, the 
G loba l Fund, CIDA, programs o f the Un i ted States ( inc lud ing PEPFAR), and other b i la tera l 
and UN agencies. 

40. 

T h e Government i s expanding k e y services fo r prevention, treatment, care and 
support. Programs targeting prevention and behavioral change among young people and other 
par t icu lar ly vulnerable groups inc lud ing indigenous people are ongo ing and services centers 
fo r voluntary testing and counseling services have increased together w i t h prevention o f 
mother-to-child transmission o f HIV and an t i-re trov ira l (ARV) treatment. The number o f 
people on ARV treatment increased to 1,375 in 2006 (represents 50% o f the people who need 
ARVs). An estimated 81% o f pregnant women are n ow accessing PM T C T services. There 
i s 100% screening o f b lood fo r transfusion. The Government has expanded i t s multi-sectoral

response to the epidemic: n ine non-health l ine m in is tr ies are imp lemen t ing H I V / A I D S 
programs fo r the ir clients and s ta f f and over fo r ty c i v i l society organizations are helping to 
reach specific vulnerable groups: youth, miners, sex workers, orphans and other vulnerable 
children, indigenous peoples, people living with H I V / A ID S , workers and armed forces with 
targeted interventions. The Guyana HIV Prevention and Con t ro l A c t has been revised and i s 
expected to be approved t h i s year. 

41. 

Thus, Guyana has achieved the CAS objective o f addressing the HIV/AIDS problem. 
However, in terms o f PRSP and MDG targets, i t has no t reversed the spread o f A I D S . B o t h 
the number o f new cases o f A I D S reported, and t h e number o f reported cases by women aged 
15-45 have r i s e n since 2000. The PRSP target called fo r a decline in bo th cases. However, i t 
i s en t ire ly possible that the increase in the number o f reported cases reflects the greater 
outreach o f t h e new program in identifying and treating AIDS patients, rather than a spread 
o f the disease.

Problems w i t h the PRSC program arose early o n when, after Boa rd approval o f 
PRSC-1 in December 2002, the rev is ion o f the Procurement A c t was delayed, and, as a 
resu l t , the credit did no t become effective until September 2003. At the same time, the 
macroeconomic program went temporarily off-track, po l i t ica l disruptions accelerated and the 
implementation o f the pover ty strategy was hampered. These delays, and the unde r ly ing 
ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses they reveal, indicate that that o r ig ina l schedule o f one PRSC per 
year was too op t im is t ic and the Government’s commitment to the CAS/PRSC agenda was 
very weak.31 The CAS had assumed that the Government was committed to serious re fo rm 
in many sectors. 
In fact, re fo rm e f for ts have been spotty at best, with some progress in

certain areas, but w i t h l i t t le o r n o progress in many others. In addition, Government plans to 
execute a Cr icke t Stadium pro jec t showed that there was l i t t l e economic analysis o f pub l ic 
expenditures and that po l i t ica l factors p layed a large ro le in decision mak ing32 . I t became 
apparent that a program o f annual or biannual PRSCs wou ld no t be possible in the Guyanese 
context, and that f u t u r e operations wou ld have to be l e s s ambitious. 

44. 

Learning f rom the PRSC-1 experience, the Bank developed the PRPMO in place o f 
PRSC-2. The PRPMO (Poverty Reduc t ion and Pub l ic Management Operation, $9.6 m i l l ion ) 
focused on a few areas where the Government had made progress, and dropped many o f the 
areas foreseen as be ing par t o f PRSC-2. I t was approved in April 2006, about a year later 
than planned in the CAS. In part, i t built o n the technical assistance studies o f the PSTAC . 
However, while ma jor progress was made in imp rov ing the Parliamentary ro le in f iduc ia ry 
oversight, the re were no e f for ts to imp lemen t the programs fo r limiting the use o f 
discretionary powers (outside o f tax exemptions) or fo r imp rov ing t h e disclosure o f o f f ic ia ls ’ 
assets. Despite assurances in the Le t ter o f Development Po l icy , the program to ra t iona l ize 
and improve social protection programs was no t carried out. 

45. QAGDEG. Q A G per formed a Q E A rev iew o f the PRPMO and ra ted the operation 
Modera te ly Unsatisfactory (4) because (i) Government ownership and commitment to the 
re forms was weak, as evidenced by the slow progress in key elements o f the PRSP program 
in the areas o f the regulatory framework fo r mining and forestry and f inanc ia l accountability; 
and (ii) the pover ty focus o f the operation was weak, underm in ing i t s rationale. Furthermore, 
the panel i s o f the view that the overa l l Government expenditure program in 2006, invo lv ing 
a significant expansion o f pub l ic spending as a share o f GDP w i thou t commensurate 
expansion o f implementation capacity, did n o t justify the p rov is ion o f incremental f inanc ing 
by IDA. The team contested the assessment through a rejoinder. Assessments by IEG during 
the CAS per iod covered also projects approved under the previous CAS . Fo r the PRSC 1 and 
the PRPMO, the IEG outcomes were moderately satisfactory and satisfactory respectively. 
46. 
The C A S per iod expired in FY05, but n o new CAS was developed. The Bank 
decided to re turn to project lend ing w i t h a Water Supply Consolidation Project in F Y 0 6 ($1 1 
m i l l ion) , re f lec t ing the complex problems o f achieving po l icy reforms with development 
po l icy lending, and despite the poor performance o f the water supply technical assistance 
pro jec t wh ich had closed in FY05 . 

47. 
Bank invo lvemen t in Guyana has continued large ly through the use o f t r u s t funds and 
gant resources. Guyana has received three gran ts under t h e EFARTI fo r $4.0 m i l l i o n during 
2005-07, and in 2008 a GEF grant fo r preservation o f the conservancy area ($3.8 m i l l ion ) . 
The EFA pro jec t has worked we l l , and i s l i k e l y to be renewed at a higher level. The GEF 
pro jec t became effective in January 2008, i s rated as satisfactory in the latest ISR. In 
addition, a small grant f rom the Trust Fund fo r Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) was 
made fo r $285,000 to support tra in ing and improvements in the Bureau o f Statistics. T h i s 
grant experienced considerable problems in implementation in i t ia l ly , but has recen t ly 
improved. 
48. 
Non-Lend ing Services. The Bank completed i t s program o f E SW / A A A more o r less 
as scheduled. This included a D P R in 2003, and a Pover ty Assessment Report and an 
IFAPEFA (in l i e u o f the Governance Rev iew) in 2008. An Investment C l ima te Assessment 

32 This project was partly financed by concessionary aid (India) and private investments, but the Government had to finance a 
significant portion when private investors failed to deliver.

was undertaken in 2006 as w e l l as a FSAP. In fo rma l technical assistance was prov ided in 
water supply and fo r hand l ing the f lood in 2005. 

49. 

In general, good technical work, such as the IFAPEFA, the IC A , and the Poverty 
Assessment Report, have p roven very valuable in p rov id ing the Bank, donors and the 
Government with w e l l based technical assessments o f c r i t ica l areas. M o r e general reports, 
such as the DPR, have had less impact. 

50. 

B. Portfolio Assessment 
Po r t fo l io indicators are given in Annex Table 4. Guyana had four projects33 in active 
implementation at the end o f FY08, and none were considered “at r i s k ” . In t h i s regard, 
Guyana was above average fo r the L a t i n Amer ica and Caribbean Region. 

51 . 

C. Aid Coordination 
Ove ra l l development assistance to Guyana has rema ined strong. In terms o f 
overa l l resource flows, the In ter-Amer ican Development Bank (IDB), the European Un ion , 
the IMF, the UK Department fo r International Development (DFID), and the Un i ted States 
Agency have been ma jor prov iders o f assistance. IDA’S lend ing to Guyana in 2006 
represented 6 percent o f the annual (net) disbursement o f o f f ic ia l assistance. 

52. 

The leve l o f a id p rov ided has been extensive and generally supported the goals o f the 
PRSP (see CAS Annex C). Coord ina t ion among donors in the p rov is ion o f assistance in 
various areas has been generally good, especially in pub l ic f inanc ia l management. Sector 
thematic coordination groups have been formed in many areas, inc lud ing agriculture, water, 
governance and competitiveness, and these are chaired by the Government and/or a lead 
donor. The func t ion ing o f these groups varies in quality.

V. OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE CAS 
53 . 

Lessons L e a r n e d f r o m th e 2002 CAS. The 2002 CAS reflected an upbeat 

assessment o f the situation in Guyana; a PRSP had been written, Guyana was e l ig ib le fo r e- 
H I PC assistance, and was mov ing toward agreement on a mu l t i-sec tor PRSC program. There 
were many problems fac ing the country, and t h e CAS correc t ly iden t i f ied these and made 
some o f them i t s fundamental objectives. In hindsight, however, i t i s clear n ow that the CAS 
was far too op t im is t ic about the capacity and w i l l ingness to undertake re forms and to make 
ins t i tu t iona l changes. The record shows a few bright spots where re forms have taken h o l d 
(Parliamentary oversight, H I V / A ID s , education), but many others where re forms have fa l len 
short (audit, procurement, budget formulation, water supply), and s t i l l others where no 
progress at a l l was made (forestry, mining, bureaucratic discretion, asset declaration, 
targeting social programs). 

50 

54 . 

There are some fundamental problems fac ing Guyana: 
There i s no fundamental consensus fo r reform. Po l i t ica l pa r t ies are d iv ided 
along rac ia l lines; the opposition party has l i t t l e voice o r power, and what i t 
has i t uses large ly to obstruct, rather than contribute pos i t ive ly . 
Building consensus fo r re fo rm takes time. Where reforms have taken place, 
po l i t ica l and social consensus has been built over time, as in the case with the 
VAT, wh ich was implemented in 2007 after much delay. 
There i s limited management and technical capacity to carry out re fo rm 
programs, due to bo th a lack o f sk i l led manpower and the continued 
emigration o f sk i l led workers abroad. 
Key Considerations for the 2009-2012 CAS 

~~ 

~~ 

Selectivity and simplicity in design are key. 

The strategy was w ide ranging w i t h highly optimistic objectives and implementation time. 
K e y performance indicators should be focused and as much as possible l inked to measurable 
outcomes. 
Keep priorities well-focused and implementation flexible. 

Lack o f capacity in the Guyanese public sector i s a cross-cutting constraint. 

Future operations should a im at increasing substantially pub l ic sector capacity. 
Timefiame and design o f future operations should take in to account capacity constraints in the 
pub l ic service. 

Client ownership and commitment, including champions, are critical. 

The lack o f Government focus on some key reforms lowered expectations and the impact o f 
the CAS. 

Lack o f political and social cohesion can undermine the reform agenda. 

The Government noted that wh i le the conditions were conducive to grow th at the beg inn ingo f 
the previous CAS period, po l i t ica l conditions and social cohesion were not in place, 
contributing to poor growth and sluggish reduction in poverty. 
Po l i t ica l constraints often prevented re fo rm f i om moving, as was the case w i t h the VAT, 
wh ich was implemented in 2007 after much delay. 
Improve po l i t ica l economy analysis in project design. 

Resource flows need to be more predictable. 

Unpredictable resource f lows negatively impacted government programs, particularly with the 
debt re l ie f packages, where delays forced the government to scale down some investments. 

Project sustainability requires retaining key personnel. 

Projects that re ly heavily on highly-paid consultants who are un l ike ly to be retained by the 
government at project completion are l i k e l y t o experience weak implementation ando r l im i ted 
long-term development impact. 

Donor coordination needs to be strengthened. 

Consider, for instance, j o i n t missions t o address common issues and pooled funds/SWAps. 

Choice and scope o f AAA should involve more consultation with the government 

Ana ly t ica l work and po l icy notes should be demand-driven, part o f the on-going re fo rm 
process, and delivered in a t ime ly manner.

GUYANA Joint I M F W o r l d B a n k Deb t Sustainability Analysis3’ 
Prepared by the S t a f f s o f the W o r l d Bank and the International Mone tary Fund3’ 

Approved by G i lber t Terrier and An thony Boo te (IMF) 
and Marce l0 Giugale and Carlos Braga (Wo r ld Bank) 

February 2,2009 

The debt sustainability analysis @SA) indicates that Guyana is a t a moderate r isk of debt 
distress. Wh i le pro jec ted debt indicators a re s im i la r to those of 
the las t DSA, downside risks, 
associated w i th d i j k u l t i e s in the sugar sector and the impact of 
the g loba l cr is is have 
increased. Fu r the r f isca l consolidation, readiness to adopt offsetting measures if needed, and 
reforms to improve competitiveness wou ld help lower the r isk of distress i n due time. 

Background 

1. 
Wh i le debt re l ie f f rom the internat iona l community helped reduce Guyana’s 
external debt bu rden significantly in recent years, vulnerabilities have increased owing 
to difficulties in the sugar sector and the global cr is is . In 2006/07, debt r e l i e f was prov ided 
by the Fund, the W o r l d Bank, and the IDB under the Mu l t i la te ra l Deb t Re l ie f In i t ia t ive 
(MDRI), amounting t o US$611 m i l l ion . In November 2006, Japan f ina l ized i t s b i la tera l debt 
cancellation agreement and wrote o f f i t s claims as par t o f the Paris C lub 2004 Agreed 
Minutes.40 In July 2007, a w r i te -o f f o f US$15 m i l l i o n o f outstanding debt to Ch ina took 
place. 

2. 
Guyana benefited f rom additional debt reduction in 2008. In March, Venezuela 
cancelled a US$12.5 m i l l i o n debt stock. Russia also agreed to cancel about US$0.25 m i l l i o n 
o f outstanding debt, prov ided that the two countries reach agreement o n investment projects 
to be iden t i f ied in the pub l ic sector investment program (PSIP). 

3. 
As a result, the externa l public debt has declined substantially. I t declined f rom 
US$1,043 m i l l i o n (1 14 percent o f GDP) at end-2006 to US$719 m i l l i o n (67 percent o f GDP) 
at end-2007. Pre l im inary estimates suggest that in 2008 Guyana’s external debt rose by 
US$115 m i l l i o n (o f wh ich US$56 .5 m i l l i o n fo r PetroCaribe t o be saved abroad), to US$835 
m i l l ion . The central Government’s short-term domestic debt, de f ined o n a gross basis, has 
fa l len f r om 34 percent o f GDP in 2006 to about 29 percent in 2007. 

38 See Addendum at the end o f th is Annex E for an update based on the projected impact o f the global crisis. 
39 Prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff. JDB s ta f f was consulted during the preparation process. 
HIPC debt r e l i e f was granted by all multilaterals but one, Paris Club bilateral creditors, and four nowParis Club creditors (China, 
India, Venezuela, and Cuba). Debt owed to Brazil and North Korea was paid offwithout relief. The other creditors have yet to provide 
HIPC debt relief.

Macroeconomic and Financing Ass~rnptions~~ 

4. 
The macroeconomic framework assumes that the economy w i l l continue to 
perform well. Med ium- term macroeconomic assumptions (Table 1) and po l ic ies 
underpinning the exercise are broad ly unchanged with respect to the 2007 DSA (SMf08/44 
Supplement 1). 

Growth. Real GDP g row th wou ld rema in strong, averaging 4% percent a year 
through 2013, dr iven by recent large pub l ic investments in the sugar and energy 
sectors and prospective significant 
fore ign direct 
investment 
telecommunications, and agriculture, and by sugar production. I t wou ld stabilize at 
about 3.0percent in the l o n g term. Compared with the previous path, g row th was 
somewhat lowe r in 2008 due to problems in the sugar sector, but i t i s expected to 
increase with a recovery o f the sugar sector f o l l ow i n g large investments in recent 
years. T h e envisaged g row th rates re f lec t continued po l i t ica l and social stability. 

in mining, 

Inflation. W i t h the recent sharp drop in o i l and other commod i ty prices, in f la t ion i s 
pro jec ted to decline f rom about 6% percent in 2008 to be low 5 percent in 2009, and to 
stabilize at that leve l thereafter, supported by prudent monetary and f isca l policies. 

External current account. T h e current account de f ic i t i s projected to narrow 
gradua l ly to be low 11 percent o f GDP by 2013 and further to 8% percent by 2028. 
T h i s i s moderately higher than previous projections, re f lec t ing in part lowe r 
commod i ty exports, partly compensated by lowe r o i l imports. 

A gradual return to the medium-term fiscal framework would underpin debt 
sustainability. Wh i le f isca l de f ic i ts wou ld be h igher than prev ious ly envisaged during 
2009-1 1, the authorities envisage that the de f ic i ts wou ld be brough t in l ine with the previous 
pa th beg inn ing in 2012. Starting in 2013, the de f ic i t wou ld stabilize at about 3 percent o f 
GDP. These assumptions are based on a re turn to f isca l consolidation and a s lowdown in 
capital spending after the completion o f ma jo r pub l ic investment projects. 

6. 

Foreign inflows would gradually decline in the years ahead. The current account 
de f ic i t i s expected to be fully financed by mu l t i la tera l and b i la tera l concessional loans, 
grants, and FDI, even w i thou t inc lud ing the PetroCaribe loans that are expected to be saved 
abroad. Over the nex t few years, foreign direct investment wou ld average about 10 percent o f 
GDP and concessional loans and gran ts together wou ld average about the same amount. In 
the l o n g run, these same in f lows wou ld decline to about 7-8 percent o f GDP and 5-6 percent, 
respectively. T h i s includes f inanc ing f rom Venezuela under PetroCaribe, wh ich i s assumed to 
hover around 4-5 percent o f GDP before be ing discontinued by 2013 4 2 . W i t h f inanc ing 
exceeding the needs, the authorities have been saving most o f PetroCaribe f inanc ing in an 
overseas account fo r the ir eventual use on large projects, o r to offset the anticipated f a l l in 

41 In absence o f concrete plans at this stage, the DSA does not reflect the effects o f potential o i l production nor o f the large 
hydroelectric plant.

Baseline Scenario: PetroCar ibe Financing on a Gross Basis 
Results of the External Debt Sustainability Analysis 
7. 
Compared to previous projections, the end-2008 external debt position 
improved. The NPV o f external debt-to-revenue i s estimated at 119 percent, 10 percentage 
po in ts lowe r than projected in t h e baseline scenario o f the 2007 L I C DSA (the nex t paragraph 
discusses the relevance o f d i f feren t debt indicators). T h i s reduc t ion reflects, among other 
factors, lowe r PetroCaribe f inanc ing due to lowe r o i l prices. 

8. 
Ex te rna l debt bu rden indicators a re expected to improve significantly in the 
long run, broad ly in l ine with previous projections. Unde r the baseline scenario, the NPV 
o f external debt-to-revenue ra t io and external debt-to-exports ratios rema in w e l l be low the 
debt burden thresholds (Table 2 and F igu re l).44 
The NPV o f external debt-to-revenue 
(excluding gran ts) i s expected to c l imb f r om 119 percent in 2008 to 145 percent in 2013, 
re f lec t ing large external gross f inanc ing f rom Venezuela, and decline thereafter to 
128 percent by the end o f the pro jec t ion period. The NPV o f external debt-to-exports, 
estimated at 50 percent in 2008, fo l lows a similar path. The l o w projected debt-service ratios 
(about 4 percent o f exports and 10 percent o f revenue in the l o n g term), indicate that the 
Government wou ld have the ab i l i ty to meet i t s debt service payments. A l o n g with the NPV o f 
debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios, these tw o indicators appear to be the most 
appropriate ones, g iven the l i k e l y underestimation o f GDP (a new GDP series i s expected to 
be published t h i s year).45 Accord ing ly , wh i le the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ra t io breaches the 
threshold temporarily, this i s no t necessarily a signal o f debt distress. Moreover, with GD P 
believed to be underestimated, s ign i f ican t savings o f borrowing, and debt indicators be low 
the thresholds, t h e projected increase in the NPV o f external debt to GDP ra t io by some 5- 
percentage po in t o f GDP i s no t an ind ica tor o f debt distress.46 

9. 
Standard sensitivity analysis shows that Guyana’s resilience to shocks has 
improved slightly, bu t i t s risk o f debt distress remains moderate (Table 3 and F igu re 1). 
Fo r the external debt-to-revenue indicator, there i s a breach o f the threshold on ly under two 
o f eight tests (as in t h e 2007 L I C DSA). T h i s breach takes place under the B5 test, wh ich 
assumes that bo th net non-debt creating f lows and rea l GDP grow at their respective 
h is tor ica l averages: the external NPV o f debt-to-revenue ra t io wou ld increase to 255 percent 
in 2010 and decline be low the threshold starting in 2015. Under t h e A1 scenario, wh ich uses 
key variables (real GDP growth, non-interest current account, g row th o f GDP deflator) at 

43 The weighted average grant element o f the IDB lending i s assumed to be 52 percent. 
44 Based on the Wo r ld Bank classification, the external debt burden thresholds relevant for Guyana are (i) NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio 
o f 150 percent; (ii) NPV o f debt-to-revenue o f 250 percent; (iii) NFV o f debt-to-GDP o f 40 percent; and (iv) Debt service-to-exports 
and revenue ratios o f 2 0 and 30 percent, respectively. 
45 See SM/08/44 Supplement 1. 
46 Accordingly, this report does not present the high-investment, low-growth scenario envisaged in the guidance note. However, the 
country specific scenario models a situation o f substantially lower fiscal revenues and lower long-term growth. 

66 

their h is tor ica l averages, the NPV o f external debt-to-revenue ra t io never breaches the 
threshold before 2028, but has an upward trend and reaches 251 percent by 2028, just above 
the threshold. I f ne t non-debt creating f lows were to g row at the h is tor ica l averages (B4), the 
NPV o f external debt-to-revenue ra t io wou ld be be low the threshold on ly by very small 
margins in 2010-2013 (about 240 on average w i t h a threshold o f 250). These results 
underscore Guyana’s need to sustain economic g row th and ma in ta in the concessionality o f 
external financing.47 

Results of the Total Public Debt Sustainability Analysis 

10. 
Guyana’s tota l pub l ic debt i s considered manageable as long as the authorities 
adhere to the ir fiscal consolidation strategy. In light o f the su f f ic ien t ava i lab i l i ty o f 
external financing, t h e macroeconomic scenario assumes no recourse to domestic f inanc ing 
o f the f isca l de f ic i t in the med ium term and a l lows for a gradual redemp t ion o f domestic 
securities. As external f inanc ing fa l ls beyond 20 12, domestic f inanc ing wou ld ma rg ina l ly 
increase in t h e long term. Thus, the NPV o f to ta l pub l ic debt-to-revenue ra t io wou ld increase 
in the med ium term f r om 159 percent in 2008 to 170 percent in 2013, re f lec t ing large 
external disbursements, and gradually decline thereafter, to 153 percent by 2028. G iven the 
authorities’ assurances o f the ir commitment to re turn to the sustainable med ium- term fiscal 
framework, the projected p r ima ry f isca l balances are consistent with debt sustainability 
(Table 4). 

11. 
Unde r alternative scenarios and bound tests, Guyana’s to ta l public debt 
indicators 
indicate mo re vulnerabilities than projected b y the externa l DSA, 
highlighting the importance o f adhering to sound policies48. I f GD P grow‘th were at the 
h is tor ica l average minus one standard dev ia t ion in 2009-2010, adversely a f fec t ing t h e 
revenue collection, the NPV o f pub l ic debt wou ld reach 383 percent o f revenue by 2028 
(Table 5). Likewise, i f the 2008 primary de f ic i t remained constant throughout the pro jec t ion 
period, the NPV o f pub l ic debt-to-revenue wou ld c l imb to 384 percent by 2028 (Table 5 and 
F igure 2). T h e sensitivity analysis underscores the importance o f pursuing sound 
macroeconomic po l ic ies to achieve high GDP g row th rates and l o w f isca l deficits, as under 
shocks to these variables the pub l ic debt wou ld increase s ign i f ican t ly with respect to revenue, 
mak ing i t d i f f icu l t to service the debt. 

A lternat ive Scenario: PetroCar ibe Financing on a N e t Basis 
12. Wh i le debt indicators imp rove substantially when only the spent p a r t o f 
PetroCar ibe financing i s considered, the baseline scenario conclusions rema in valid. 
G iven the magnitude o f the estimated savings accumulated f rom PetroCaribe f inanc ing 
through 2013, the net debt indicators are s ign i f ican t ly lowe r than in the gross-basis baseline 
scenario. The NPV o f external debt-to-revenue ra t io wou ld reach 11 1 percent in 2013 (some 
35 percentage po in ts lowe r than in t h e baseline scenario), and in the long-term-as 
the 

47 Given the high degree o f concessionality o f the PetroCaribe loans, replacing this financing with less-concessional loans would lead 
to a sharp deterioration o f debt indicators. 
The assumptions for marginal lending in the case o f shocks under the public DSA i s identical to the last DSA, with 70 percent 
extemal and 30 percent domestic borrowing and concessionality slightly below the baseline. 

67 

savings are used-they wou ld converge to values similar to those obtained in the baseline 
scenario. The NPV o f debt-to-GDP wou ld increase by less than three percentage po in ts in 
2009 (Table 6), compared to more than f ive under the baseline. 

Country Specific Scenario 
13. 
A country-specific scenario that assumes a less-than-fully successful sugar 
modernization plan highlights significant downside risks and the importance o f early 
compensatory measures. I t assumes that the plan achieves on ly 70 percent o f the envisaged 
increases in sugar produc t ion bo th in the short and in the l o n g run. T h i s wou ld lead to lowe r 
GDP levels, f isca l revenues, and, under the assumption o f n o o f fse t t ing measures, a de f ic i t 
that wou ld be about one percent o f GDP higher per year. The increased f inanc ing 
requirements are assumed to be covered with new nonconcessional external disbursements. 
As a r e s u l t (Table 7), much o f the bo r row ing space p rov ided by the h4DRI wou ld be eroded, 
with the NPV o f external debt-to-revenue reaching 202 percent in 2028 (128 percent in the 
baseline). The NFV o f debt-to-revenue ind ica tor wou ld breach t h e thresholds o f three 
additional tests and the negative shocks wou ld have a stronger effect than in the baseline 
scenario (Table 8 and Figures 3 and 4). The worsening o f debt indicators, however, wou ld 
no t change the assessment o f moderate risk o f debt distress. 

Conclusion 
14. Guyana remains at a moderate risk of debt distress. Relevant debt indicators are 
well be low thresholds but potential vulnerabilities have increased, name ly the risk o f a weak 
implementation o f the sugar modernization p lan and a more prolonged than-currently- 
envisaged g loba l slowdown. Pub l ic sector debt ratios show h igher vu lnerab i l i ty than external 
ones, underscoring the importance o f deepening f isca l consolidation. Go ing forward, 
re turn ing to the sustainable medium-term f isca l framework and broadening the sources o f 
growth, as w e l l as a prudent debt strategy, wou ld be c r i t ica l to preserve recent gains.

GUYANA Debt Sustainability Analysis 
Addendum to t h e Joint IM F N B DSA49 

The add i t iona l scenario of 
lower GD P grow th related to the g loba l cr is is indicates that the 
main conclusion of 
the Jo in t IMF/WB debt sustainability analysis (DSA), i.e. that Guyana is 
a t a moderate r isk of debt distress, remains va l id . I n this scenario pro jec ted debt indicators, 
although slightly worse, are s im i la r to those of 
the Jo in t DSA. 

The macroeconomic f iamewo rk assumes that the economy w i l l continue to pe r fo rm we l l . 
However, as explained in the ma in text o f this document, due to a more pro longed g loba l 
slowdown, growth rates fo r 2009 and 2010 are lowe r than those o f the j o i n t DSA. The current 
scenario’s projections are more conservative than those presented by the Government in i t s 
2009 budget and by the IMF in i t s recent A r t ic le IV. GDP i s expected to expand by just 2.4% 
in 2009 and 3.6% in 2009. Fo r the rema in ing forecasting per iod n o change has been assumed. 

The results o f the additional scenario are presented in the table and figures” below. D u e to 
lowe r growth in 2009 and 2010, debt ratios are ma rg ina l ly above those o f the baseline 
scenario, however these ratios do no t present any s i g n o f increased debt distress or o f 
compromised sustainability. 

49 T h i s Addendum to the jo in t IMF and World Bank DSA was prepared by WB s t a f f only. 
T h e additional scenario i s labeled as “low grow th” in the f igu re below.
