Executive Summary 

i. 

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Georgia for FY10-13 has been prepared against the 
backdrop o f twin crises - the August armed conflict with Russia followed by the global economic 
downturn. As a result, the joint World BanWIFC strategy focuses on post-conflict and vulnerability 
issues in the near term, and strengthening the foundations for medium term competitiveness and growth. 

ii. 

Over the past five years, Georgia has embarked on a program o f deep reforms. The Government 
has pursued a large reduction in corruption, a major improvement in the private sector environment, and 
the introduction o f a targeted soc ia l assistance program. I t now has the highest policy and institutional 
assessment rating (CPIA) in the IDA cohort. I n keeping with these reforms, Georgia attracted significant 
foreign investments, trade expanded, and growth through August 2008 averaged over 9 percent annually. 

iii. 

The August 2008 conflict and the following global economic downturn have altered the dynamic. 
Georgia has remained on i t s high reform track. But the global economic environment may not provide 
the same growth impetus as in the past, as levels o f foreign investment and trade may be lower at least in 
the near term. Current projections are for GDP to contract by about 4 percent in 2009 before growth 
resumes at about 2 percent in 2010. 

iv. 
The Government o f Georgia has responded to the twin c r ises with an appropriate macroeconomic 
policy mix. The currency was devalued by about 16 percent against the US dollar and an auction system 
was introduced for foreign currency. Exchange rates have stabilized, as have gross reserves at about $1 .5 
billion, re-establishing the level before the conflict. On the f i s c a l side, authorities have implemented s t r ic t 
controls over non-priority public spending, while leveraging donors to support countercyclical funding in 
key job-creating investments and widening the social safety net. 
In the financial sector, the short term 
rollover risk related to the banking system has been contained, though vulnerabilities remain in the 
medium term. 

v. 
A central element in providing economic and financial stability during the current period has been 
donor support. The IMF approved a $750 million standby program in September 2008, which has 
recently been augmented by about $400 million and extended through mid-201 1. I n October 2008, the 
international community collectively pledged $4.5 billion over a three year period including budgetary 
support, expanding the soc ia l safety net and addressing the needs o f IDPs, core infrastructure priorities, 
and the private sector, including significant support to commercial banks. To date, donors have 
committed about $1 .7 billion o f the donor pledge. 

vi. 
I t i s in this context - and Georgia’s new s t a t u s as a blend country - that the CPS envisages Bank 
Group financing o f about $740-900 million over four years, underpinned by a strong program o f 
knowledge services. The financing envelope includes the remaining IDA -1 5 envelope (projected at about 
$130 million), IBRD lending (o f about $266 million), disbursements under ongoing IDNIBRD projects 
(o f about $135 million) and IFC investments and lending ( o f about $210-360 million). While lending i s 
necessary to meet investment needs, knowledge services are equally important to aid policy choices and 
suggest appropriate actions for addressing vulnerability and strengthening competitiveness, and therefore 
help meet Georgia’s development objectives. 

vii. 
New IDA and IBRD lending under the CPS program i s heavily focused on budgetary support 
(with an emphasis on further deepening reforms in social assistance, the business environment, and the 
expenditure framework) and infrastructure (particularly in the area o f roads to strengthen internal 
connectivity and Georgia’s role as a transport corridor within the South Caucasus). These activities, 
combined with 11 ongoing projects and IFC efforts, are intended to address both pillars o f the CPS. On 

the first pillar, these efforts would provide near term support for economic and f isca l stability, the poor 
and vulnerable and help create immediate jobs. On the second pillar, they would advance future 
competitiveness and export potential. 

v i i i . Now that Georgia i s a blend country, the pace at which i t w i l l begin the process o f graduating 
from IDA to IBRD adds to uncertainties. Resources are estimated conservatively, without pre-judging the 
potential for either continued access to IDA under IDA-16, or a change in the amounts o f IBRD access. 
Within this estimated envelope, ID A and IBRD funds are frontloaded to provide countercyclical support 
during the current downturn. As a result, at estimated levels, the Bank would not be able to provide 
much, i f any, new IDA and IBRD funding in the outer years o f the CPS. The levels o f IDA and IBRD 
support w i l l be reviewed at mid-term and may be adjusted to reflect the evolving situation. The program 
leaves open the potential for additional amounts, should they be available, to enhance budget and 
transportation support, but also maintain Bank lending in sectors in which i t has been active but where 
operations are concluding (such as municipal development, health, education, agriculture, energy). 

ix . 
The IFC program would continue to support the f inanc ia l sector with both resources and advisory 
services, but seek to rebalance i t s focus with a greater emphasis on support to the rea l sector through 
financing and advisory services to the private sector and possible support to the Government through 
advisory services related to priority sectors, such as agribusiness and infrastructure. IFC and IDN IBRD 
synergy w i l l be deepened in our support to the financial sector, in infrastructure and in further enhancing 
the conditions for doing business. 
IFC’s response, in terms o f both the s ize and composition o f the 
program, w i l l depend on the duration and characteristics o f the crisis. 

x. 
Knowledge services are central to the Bank Group’s strategy. Bank ana ly t ic work and dialogue 
on public expenditure choices and poverty analysis w i l l be critical inputs to supporting medium term 
f i s c a l adjustment. Post-conflict monitoring and reporting w i l l be essen t ia l to ensuring donor funding i s on 
track and well coordinated. Other critical work w i l l be the Bank’s e f f o r t s to support IDP welfare and 
economic integration, IFCs support for improving the business and f inanc ia l sector environment, critical 
sector work in health and education, supporting greater trade integration and quality standards 
(particularly in the context o f the EU’s Eastern Partnership Agreement) and helping the Government 
improve monitoring, evaluation and overall communications. 

x i . 
The strategy described above i s designed to channel funds in the most effective manner during a 
difficult period, but i s not without risks. The largest risks are associated with ( i ) the potential for the 
economic downturn to be longer and deeper than anticipated, based upon the global and domestic 
economic and political environments, (ii) limited scope for Bank financial support to respond to emerging 
needs in the outer years o f the CPS, due to IBRD and ID A frontloading and uncertainties regarding IDA - 
16 eligibility and (iii) rapid growth o f non-concessional borrowing in the wake o f the c r i s i s . A higher 
debt service profile, including a challenging peak in debt servicing obligations in 2013, could, in a slow 
recovery scenario, crowd out key growth and social expenditures. Broad national support for the key 
prongs o f the development strategy and continued Government reforms would help mitigate some o f 
these risks. But the risks require building a strong basis for recovery and post-crisis growth, medium term 
f i s c a l adjustment including strengthening public expenditure management, and careful debt management, 
taking into account external financing including donor support. These are central elements o f CPS 
implementation. 

Staff would appreciate views from Executive Directors on: 
Do the two pillars o f the CPS, and proposed activities, r e f l e c t Georgia’s development challenges? 
Are the programs o f the IFC, IDA and IBRD well integrated and mutually supportive? 
Does the results framework provide fo r sufficient accountability?

GEORGIA: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

I. 

The Country Context 

A. 

Introduction 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) fo r FY10-13 reflects the Bank Group’s intended 
support to Georgia in recovering from the August 2008 armed conflict with Russia and the global 
economic cr is is , and setting the stage for future competitiveness. With income per head about $2480 
in 2008, Georgia now ranks as a lower middle-income country and i s an IDNIBRD blend country. The 
CPS envisages full use o f the remaining IDA-15 envelope (projected at about $130 million), an indicative 
IBRD lending amount o f about $266 million over this four f i s c a l year period, as well as projected IFC 
commitments o f $210 - 360 million. Combined with undisbursed amounts o f about $135 million as o f 
end-FY09, total financing during this period from the World Bank Group i s expected to total about $740- 
900 million. Bank and IFC lending w i l l be complemented by a focused program o f advisory services. 

2. 

Several principles guide the CPS: First, there i s direct alignment with Georgia’s development 
program as provided in both the longer term plan set out prior to the August Conflict as Georg ia without 
Poverty, as well as in the Jo in t Needs Assessment (JVA) endorsed by the Government which se t out a more 
focused program in the aftermath o f the August Conflict, and in the Government’s just published Basic 
Da ta and Directions (BDD ) exercise i t prepares in the context o f i t s medium term expenditure planning 
exercise. Second, the Bank Group w i l l exercise a strong level o f selectivity, recognizing where other 
donors can lead or where the country has adequate internal knowledge and capacity. The JNA provides a 
strong framework for a division o f labor among donors based on an agreed framework. Third, the CPS 
w i l l need to be implemented with flexibility, given the uncertainties on the depth and duration o f the 
international c r i s i s and the uncertainty o f Bank lending levels. Heavy frontloading the allocation o f 
Georgia’s lending envelope at the request o f the Government i s expected to yield higher economic and 
social returns than a more even allocation, but increases the uncertainty in the outer years o f the CPS. The 
capacity o f the Bank Group to respond to Georgia’s growing and complex requirements beyond the initial 
period w i l l need to be carefully reviewed at mid-term. Finally, coordination within the Bank Group w i l l 
enable the Bank to deliver IDA , IBRD, and IFC resources to best meet the strategic objectives o f the CPS. 

B. 

The Political Context 

3. 
The domestic political scene i s strained. During the f i r s t four years following the 2003 Rose 
Revolution Georgia enjoyed rapid growth and the Government undertook significant governance, 
economic and social reforms, with impressive results. 
In 2007 domestic tensions grew and led into 
demonstrations to which the Government reacted with a brief period o f martial law. Early elections were 
called and President Saakashvili won a second five year term in January 2008. 
In 2009, tensions again 
rose with some opposition parties seeking fresh elections. Nevertheless, the domestic situation has been 
relatively peaceful, tensions appear to have recently eased, and there appears to be support across most o f 
the political spectrum on continuing liberal economic reforms. Domestic tensions underline the need for 
wide dialogue on policy options and investment priorities within and outside o f Government. 

4. 

Geopolitically, tensions with Russia also remain high. Although armed conflict lasted le ss than 
a week in August 2008, tensions remain. Following intermediation by the European Union, fighting 
stopped and both sides separated. The EU has stationed about 300 monitors in Georgia (EUMM) along 
administrative borders and, with the OSCE, the UN and the US, i s engaged in a longer term mediation 
effort in Geneva, in which all involved parties are participating. Nevertheless, a shared vision for conflict 
resolution does not yet exist. The OSCE monitoring mission ceased in Georgia on June 30, 2009. The 
UNOMIG mandate was terminated on June 15,2009 and by the end o f 2009 w i l l leave Georgia. 

C .

years. These inc lude impress ive progress in r e f o rm i n g the r o l e o f the state v is -a -v is the p r iva te sector,

6. 

Based on this high reform path, the economy grew rapidly w ith an average growth rate o f 
over 9 percent per year from 2004 through July 2008. Deep and fast paced imp lemen ta t ion o f

The August 2008 conflict led to a number o f severe shocks to the economy. While the conflict 
resulted in tangible direct infrastructure costs, the biggest damage was a result o f the heightened perception 
o f risk and weakening o f investor confidence. Bond spreads have since fluctuated between 800 and 1000 
basis points. ’ New credit came to a halt, and foreign lending and FDI, which had been engines o f 
Georgia’s growth, were put in jeopardy. Public f inances came under s t re ss due to the combination o f 
falling revenues and increased unanticipated expenditures related to the need to repair damaged 
infrastructure and the sharp increase in demands on the social safety net. Unemployment and poverty were 
exacerbated by new internally displaced people (about 137,000 at the height o f the conflict, though since 
then 106,000 have returned to their places o f origin and have received assistance for damaged or destroyed 
housing) and others who lost their livelihoods as a result o f the conflict. A t the request o f the Government, 
the World Bank and the United Nations took the lead in coordinating preparation o f a Jo in t Needs 
Assessment (JNA) during la te AugusdSeptember, 2008. The JNA estimated the financing requirements o f 
the recovery program to be about $3 .8 billion, including budget support, social funding including the needs 
o f IDPs, critical in f ras t ruc tu re and the financial sector. 

8. 
The international community moved quickly to provide support. The IMF Board approved a 
$750 million Standby Arrangement (SBA) in September 2008, recently augmented by about $400 million. 
In October 2008 the international community pledged $4.5 billion for a three years period (o f which 
approximately $800 million was for the private sectodbanking system). This i s additional to the IMF 
funding. During the first six months o f the post-conflict period (the “immediate period” according to the 
JNA), the amount o f legally committed donor funds for public and private sector operations was in excess 
o f $1.7 billion, o f which more than $1 billion has been disbursed. This has allowed the Government to 
maintain and reorient public expenditures in l ine with the JNA. Donor resources committed to date have 
been focused on immediate needs including budget support ($4 15 million), expanding the social safety net 
and addressing the needs o f IDPs ($165 million) and rehabilitation o f damaged infrastructure and core 
priority recovery needs ($442 million). Additionally, the banking and private sector benefited from 
significant financing from a number o f donors ($686 million), allowing them to meet cross-border 
obligations and ensuring banking sector stability. In addition to financial flows, Georgia also benefits as 
part o f the EU Neighborhood Policy and signed the Eastern Partnership Agreement in May 2009. 

9. 
However, the global economic c r i s i s has further exacerbated the economic and social impact 
of the shocks from the August conflict. Growth projections have been revised downward to -4.0 percent 
in 2009, with further downside risks. This contraction appears to be le ss severe than in some developing 
economies, due in part to Georgia’s growing economic resilience as a result o f reforms implemented since 
2004 and strong donor financial support. Unemployment i s rising from an already high 14 percent in 2008 
and may reach 17 percent by the end o f 2009. Poverty and inequality are also likely to rise. 

10. 
The economic c r i s i s has hit the Georgian economy through the following four main 
transmission channels-reduction of FDI, shrinkage o f remittances, collapse in export demand, and 

a sharp contraction in bank lending. FDI inflows have fallen sharply f rom $1 -7 b i l l i o n in 2007 t o 

a projected level o f about $900 million in 2009. Workers’ remittances which had reached $300 million 
dollars by 2008 (or about 3 percent o f GDP) have declined by about 20 percent in the first six months of 
2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Exports are expected to decline in 2009 by about 8 percent in 
real terms and about 20-25 percent in nominal terms. And in the f i r s t six months o f 2009, banks’ total 
assets, loans and deposits, have a l l fallen while Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) have r isen . 

1 1. 
The Georgian authorities have responded by implementing an appropriate macroeconomic 
policy mix directed at mitigating the downturn and maintaining macroeconomic stability in the

August c o n f l i c t . T h e IMF - s u p p o r t e d S tand-By Arrangemen t (SBA ) i s a k e y p i l l a r f o r this. 

12. 
Second, countercyclical fiscal measures have been introduced even as the authorities have 
implemented strict controls over non-priority public spending. K e y t o the f isca l response have been 
the leve rag ing o f donor i n f l ow s t o suppor t job -c rea t ing inves tmen t projects, and the w i d e n i n g and 
im p r o v e d ta rge t ing o f the soc ia l safety ne t . At the same t ime , non-essential spend ing has been cu t o r 
de ferred . M i l i t a r y expend i tures have also been reduced so as t o free up resources f o r p r i o r i t y soc ia l and 
in f ras t ruc tu re needs. These have been accompan ied by measures t o im p r o v e the e f f i c i e n c y and 
e f fec t iveness o f p u b l i c expenditures. A l t h o u g h the f isca l d e f i c i t i s expected t o w i d e n t o ove r 9 percent in

13. 
Th ird , the authorities have embarked upon a deliberate strategy of securing external public 
funds to compensate fo r smaller private inflows. T h e au thor i t ies have pursued the pledges under the 
JNA w h i l e also d r aw i n g d o w n the IMF suppor ted S tand-By Arrangemen t . Georg ia ’s capac i ty f o r higher

14. 
Fourth, measures have been taken to strengthen the solvency and liquidity of the banking 
system. Georgia’s f i n a n c i a l system i s dom ina ted by the b a n k i n g sector w i t h t o t a l assets equ iva len t t o 46 
percen t o f GDP .2 In the first two weeks a f ter the August 2008 c o n f l i c t there was a tempo ra ry w i t h d r aw a l 
o f deposits, but remed ia l measures, i n c l u d i n g p r o v i d i n g liquidity, were e f fec t ive in r e t u r n i n g some 
deposits. N o n -P e r f o rm i n g Loans ove r 90 days have r isen (cu r ren t ly abou t 4 .6 percen t o f  loan^).^ W i t h 
suppor t f r om IFC and EBRD, the shor t- term r o l l o v e r risk re la ted t o ex terna l b o r r ow i n g has been contained, 
t h o u g h vu lne rab i l i t ies rema in in the medium t e rm in the even t o f a p ro t rac ted g l o b a l econom ic c r is is . 
Depos i ts and ne t loans are d o w n 2 0 percen t and 1 1 percent respec t ive ly as o f end-June 2009 compared t o a 
year ago, s igna l ing tha t con f idence rema ins low compared t o pre-cr is is leve ls . W h i l e o v e r a l l loan demand

rates are high. As a consequence, some liquidity i s ava i lab le even within a tight l e n d i n g s i tua t ion and the 
Gove rnmen t i s cons ide r ing ways t o m o b i l i z e these funds, poss ib ly th rough issuing governmen t bills. 

15. 
A ser ies o f measures taken since September 2008 are helping to maintain financial sector 
stability. Aga ins t the backd rop o f rising NP L s , the F i n a n c i a l Superv is ion A u t h o r i t y (FSA ) has requ i red 
banks w i t h r i s k i e r p o r t f o l i o s t o strengthen l o a n loss p rov is ion ing , w h i c h has increased f r o m 5 percen t o f 

The banking sector includes 20 banks, o f which 7 are foreign controlled. 8 banks account for 90% o f lending. 
Using a 3 0 day overdue measure, NPLs are about 18 percent, which provides an indicator o f emerging s t ress .

total loans in August 2008 to 12.2 percent in June 2009. The f inanc ia l regulator has also taken a 
conservative approach to capital adequacy, requiring additional capital against foreign currency 
denominated loans. In May 2009, the FSA prepared s tress- tes ts on the five largest banks which found that 
their capital and liquidity had thus far withstood the foreign exchange depreciation and NPL increase, 
though risks remain. Draft legislation i s being prepared for the merger o f the FSA and the Central Bank, 
creating a consolidated regulator and supervisor for the f inanc ia l system. Banks are conserving liquidity to 
enable them to set aside larger loan loss provisions and to better prepare for repayment o f external 
obligations. 

D. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability 

16. 
The global economic c r i s i s i s having a significant impact on Georgia’s outlook for recovery 
and growth, which was already weakened following the August conflict. The baseline projection for 
the economy i s a contraction o f 4.0 percent in 2009, followed by marginal growth in 2010 and a pickup o f 
growth in 201 1-2012 (see Table 1). Given the uncertainty regarding Georgia’s external environment, as 
well as the impact o f recent domestic tension on investor sentiment, there are downside risks to this growth 
outlook. A t the same time, the projected contraction i s l e s s severe than in some other CIS economies, due 
in part to Georgia’s strong pre-crisis fundamentals, as well as the fact that the Georgian economy has more 
diversified trade and investment links. Notwithstanding the uncertainty associated with economic 
projections, the major downward revisions for key economic variables--such as GDP growth, FD I and 
trade--relative to the pre-crises prospects for Georgia are significant (see Figure 1 below). Inflation i s 
expected to remain moderate at 3 - 5 percent in the medium term, down significantly from 11 percent at 
end-2007 due to sharp declines i n capital inflows, credit from the banking sector, and global commodity 
prices in the second half o f 2008.

External adjustment i s projected to continue over the medium-term, supported by a flexible 
exchange rate. As a resu l t o f l ow e r cap i ta l i n f l ow s (and assisted by an exchange ra te p o l i c y consistent 
with ex terna l competitiveness), the ex terna l curren t accoun t d e f i c i t i s expected t o n a r r ow s i g n i f i c a n t l y

G D P in 2009, resulting f r om the econom ic con t rac t ion and a shift o f expend i tures away f r om im p o r t -

18. 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are projected to fall in 2009 before recovering 
gradually in the medium term. A l t h o u g h ex is t ing fo re ign inves tors have n o t p u l l e d ou t o f Geo rg ia and a

p ro jec ted F D I i n f l ow s have a lmos t h a l v e d t o about $900 m i l l i o n (abou t 8 percent o f GDP ) in 2009 . This i s 
expected t o inc lude several

transportation, commun ica t ions , and o ther sectors. FDI i n f l o w s are p ro jec ted t o recover t o abou t 11

19. 
Reflecting the changed economic fundamentals, a strong fiscal adjustment i s projected over 
the medium term. The o v e r a l l f isca l d e f i c i t i s pro jec ted t o w i d e n t o ove r 9 percent o f G D P in 2009 be fore

2008 t o 29.7 percent in 2009 and 2 6 percen t in the m e d i um te rm . 

20 . 
The higher countercyclical borrowing has led to a worsening of Georgia’s debt burden and 
debt service indicators, but they are expected mostly to remain within relevant prudential 
thresholds. Geo rg ia has been r e c e i v i n g s ign i f ican t f o r e i g n f i n a n c i n g f o r pos t c o n f l i c t rehab i l i ta t ion and

2 2 . 
Nevertheless, Georgia faces a number o f significant but manageable macroeconomic risks 
and vulnerabilities. First, given the uncertain global economic outlook, the decline in capital inflows and 
exports could be sharper than currently projected, which would increase the depth and duration o f the 
economic downturn. Second, with the global economic downturn affecting donor countries and given the 
increased demand for funds in other countries, actual disbursement o f donor assistance could f a l l short o f 
pledges made at the October 2008 donor conference. Both o f these scenarios would require greater 
external adjustment, and further downscaling o f planned expenditures. Third, the f inanc ia l sector remains 
vulnerable as a result o f the economic downturn. Given that similar shares o f assets and liabilities are 
denominated in foreign currency, the direct risk to balance sheets from exchange rate depreciation i s 
limited, although foreign exchange risks in the loan portfolio may increase credit risk. 

2 3 . 
A number of risk mitigation measures are being pursued under this strategy. Bank staff, in 
collaboration with the IMF, have intensified their macroeconomic monitoring and are engaged in 
continuous dialogue on policy tradeoffs and options. Economic projections are updated frequently as new 
data becomes available. In order to secure adequate donor assistance, the authorities have worked closely 
with development partners on monitoring aid flows. A Progress Report on the JNA which reviewed 
financing committed and disbursed, major activities funded, and the outlook on evolving priorities was 
publicly issued in July 2009 . In order to mitigate financial sector vulnerabilities, banks have increased 
provisioning, financing was secured to meet large repayment obligations in 2009 , and the authorities are 
strengthening supervisory efforts and developing a f inanc ia l stability plan. 

E. 

Poverty and MDGs 

2 4 . 
Poverty. In light o f the poor quality o f o f f i c i a l household surveys, the Bank and the Ministry o f 
Health, Labor and Social Protection (MOHLSP) did a separate LSMS survey in the Fall o f 2007 which 
benchmarked poverty at about 23 .7 percent with moderate income inequality. The results o f the LSMS 
were presented in a fu l l “Georgia Poverty Assessment” which was published and made publically 
available in April 2 0 0 9 . This report identified three crucial points in the fight against poverty: 
The importance o f widening social assistance: Pensions and the newly introduced targeted 
social assistance (TSA) program, developed under the Bank-supported PRSO series, have played 
an important role in poverty reduction. Extending coverage o f the TSA would help reduce poverty 
and income inequality, particularly in the rural areas. 
The importance o f increasing employment: Despite the r i s e in wages, unemployment remains 
the major concern. Public sector labor shedding as part o f reforms since Georgia’s Rose 
Revolution has not yet been fully matched by growth in private employment. 
The importance of addressing spatial disparities: Poverty in Georgia i s particularly entrenched 
in rural areas (see Table 2 ) . In terms o f the distribution o f the poor across urban and rural areas, 
ru ra l poverty rates are higher than urban poverty rates, and the incidence o f extreme poverty in 
rural areas i s almost twice that in urban areas. The poverty rate i s also quite differentiated by 
regions, with three regions - Kakheti, Shida Kartli, and Mtskheta-Mtianeti - having poverty rates 
over 40 percent. Beyond poverty levels, i t i s important to note that while rural areas account for 
only about 9 percent o f GDP, about half the population and work force are situated there.

The double shocks o f the August 2008 conflict and the global financial cr is is risk are 
expected to worsen the poverty situation in the near term. Were i t not fo r the negative welfare impacts 
o f the twin crisis, the poverty headcount in Georgia could be expected to decline (see Figure 2). However, 
w i t h the twin cr ises , the poverty headcount i s instead forecast to r i s e in 2009. In response, the Government 
has already increased budget allocations fo r social protection in 2009, and i s keeping a close watch to see 
i f more i s needed. The Bank i s cooperating closely in this e f for t .

Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): As noted above, the economic contraction may se t 
back efforts, in the near term, to make significant gains in overall poverty reduction. Progress on many o f 
the other MDG s i s strong, though continued efforts w i l l be necessary to protect gains dur ing the economic 
downturn. Annex 4 provides a full rev iew o f the M D G targets and status bu t some h igh l igh ts include:

In heath, significant progress has been observed. In fan t mor ta l i ty per 1000 l ive births has dropped 
f rom 20 in 2001 to 14 in 2007. However, there i s s t i l l some way to go to achieve the M D G target 
o f 7 per 1000 l ive births by 2015. Maternal mor ta l i ty decreased f rom 58.7 per 100,000 l ive births 
in 2001 to 15.6 in 2007, and i s now approaching the M D G target o f 12.3. 
In education, there i s very strong (92 percent) pr imary enrollment rates and close to full gender 
par i ty in classrooms. Qua l i ty o f education remains a wo rk in progress though, supported through 
the introduction o f new curricula and a 12' grade. Learn ing outcomes have been benchmarked 
through T IMSS and PIRLS, though the rank ing indicates room fo r improvement ( for example the 
8' grade rank ing shows Georgia as 3 3 out o f 49 countries in math achievements). 
On environment, there has been improvement bu t there i s also room fo r further progress. Wh i le 
close to 100 percent o f the urban population has access to improved water, access i s lower for the 
rura l population. Na t iona l parks are being managed professionally, but forestry i s not yet 
managed according to best international practices.

Governance and Anti-Corruption

Georgia has made major strides on governance and anti-corruption since the Rose 
Revolution. Addressing corruption and governance i s s u e s was seen as an overarching theme that was to 
be addressed in each o f the th ree p i l lars o f the last CPS. A long these l ines , governance reforms 
implemented over the last CPS per iod aimed at ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability, strengthening pub l ic 
finances and improv ing prov is ion o f basic pub l ic services. Enhancement o f the business sector 
environment was at the core of the re form agenda as a competitive private sector i s v iewed 'by the 
Government as the ma in engine o f growth. 

8 

2 8 . 
Significant steps were taken to improve the public financial management system, including 
budget reform and introduction o f a medium-term expenditure framework, implementation o f the Treasury 
Single Account, simplifying Tax and Customs Codes, reorganization and strengthening revenue 
administration, and transforming the Chamber o f Control into the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), 
including amendment o f the external audit legislation to address shortcomings in the area o f public 
accountability and oversight. 

2 9 . 
International surveys (BEEPS, Doing Business) corroborate that concern over bribery has 
come down considerably. These surveys indicate a substantial decrease in unofficial payments as we l l as 
time spent in dealing with public officials over interpretation o f laws and regulations. Pervasive petty 
corruption was addressed in many public institutions. Traffic police were reconstituted and restaffed to 
reduce this endemic source o f corruption. Objective testing was introduced to determine university 
placement. 

30. 
Notwithstanding these achievements, several areas continue to require attention. W h i l e the 
Government has made the establishment o f an environment conducive for private sector investment and 
growth as a centerpiece o f its development strategy, there i s a need to further improve business practices 
and regulations to promote maximum competition and transparency. While the judiciary i s being reformed 
with the courts system reorganized, re-staffed and judges retrained, continued efforts are needed to reduce 
the perception that it i s not independent and that i t can be heavy-handed in its approach. There i s also the 
perception of an ad hoc and heavy-handed approach to tax co l lec t ion . Many o f the institutions o f 
government continue to be weak. Most importantly, there i s a need to continue to deepen the dialogue 
between the Government and c iv i l society to build transparency in decision making and program 
implementation.

Country Development Agenda and Priorities 

A. 

The Country Development Program 

3 1 . 
Several recent documents have laid out the authorities’ development program o v e r the 
medium-term. I n January 2008, the Government laid out a medium term reform program entitled 
“Un ited Georgia without Poverty”. The program established policy directions in a number o f action 
areas, including macro-economic growth, lower taxes, creation o f jobs, focusing the budget on social 
programs, extending health insurance for the poor, rehabilitating the road network, increasing hydropower 
generation, increasing agricultural exports, and strengthening higher education. While this strategy 
predates the significant changes to the economic environment following the August conflict and the global 
economic cr is is , many o f the policy directions remain valid although the pace at which they are expected 
to be reached w i l l need to be adjusted. 

32 . 
I n the immediate aftermath o f the August conflict, the Government worked with the donors 
to develop a post-conflict response. This response has included f isca l adjustment, safeguarding the 
financial sector, addressing the needs o f IDPs, swiftly repairing damaged infrastructure, and seeking and 
obtaining international support. In September, 2008 a team lead by the World Bank and the United 
Nations (with the participation o f ADB, EU, EBRD, EIB and IFC and in collaboration with the 
Government) prepared the Jo in t Needs Assessment (JNA) which identified the following four areas fo r 
donor support: macro and f i s c a l stabilization, social needs (especially for IDPs), priority in fras truc ture 
investments, and the banking and private sectors. Donor commitments thus far are on-track in meeting 
these requirements. 

9 

3 3 . 
Each year, the Government prepares an annual strategy document titled Basic Da tu and 
Directions (BDD), which outlines the medium term reform program, provides the medium term 
macro-economic framework, including the f i s c a l resource envelope and allocations, and includes detailed 
descriptions o f the individual sectoral strategies for achieving these objectives. The 20 10-20 13 Basic Data 
and Directions paper has been submitted to Parliament. Some o f the overall strategic directions o f the 
Government’s economic reform strategy include: resumption o f economic growth, support for social 
needs, investments in critical infrastructure, rural productivity, education, judicial reform, and government 
effectiveness: 

Resumption o f Economic growth: This w i l l be pursued through continuing to reduce taxes, 
promotion o f free trade with the EU, improvement in customs processes, and strengthening 
infrastructure. 

0 Surmort for soc ia l needs. The social safety net w i l l be strengthened by increasing pensions 
and expanding the coverage and improving the targeting o f soc ia l assistance. Expanded access 
to medical insurance, with state subsidization for the poor, w i l l also be a priority. Living 
conditions for new D P s w i l l be improved and a phased program w i l l be implemented to 
provide dwellings for earlier IDPs. Water.supply and sewage systems w i l l be restructured and 
rehabilitated throughout the country. 

0 Sumort for c r i t ica l infrastructure: The state w i l l finance core infrastructure projects and a t trac t 
where possible foreign investments thus promoting businesses and jobs. A key sector w i l l be 
transportation where the construction o f E-W Highway and other segments in the South and 
West w i l l be a priority. Energy reliability w i l l be enhanced, including by attracting donor and 
private investment to support a new power transmission line and increased hydropower 
generation. 

0 Rural Productivity.: To increase productivity in agriculture, irrigatioddrainage systems w i l l 
be rehabilitated. Assistance to farmers on critical inputs w i l l continue. Agribusiness and 
processing w i l l be supported which w i l l also help create jobs. Efforts w i l l be strengthened to 
increasing productivity in ca t t le raising and providing safety against epizootical threats and 
providing for food safety. 

Education: A l l public schools w i l l be brought into l i n e with modern standards and equipped 
with computers linked to the internet. Quality o f teaching at universities w i l l be strengthened 
according to international standards and teacher training w i l l be enhanced. 

Judicial Reform: Judiciary reform w i l l continue to be implemented and independence o f 
judiciary w i l l grow. Criminal and administrative judicial systems, data bases, and judge 
selection w i l l be revamped along modern standards. Trial by ju ry w i l l also be introduced in 
certain criminal areas. 

Government Effectiveness: The public sector w i l l establish measurable parameters used for 
evaluation o f performance and this w i l l make public service more transparent. Budgetary and 
treasury processes w i l l be improved. On anti-corruption, a system o f asset declaration o f 
public servants w i l l be strengthened and a code o f ethics introduced.

Key Economic and Social Priorities 

34. 
I n the light of the twin crises, the strategic objectives o f the authorities fa l l into two ma in 
categories: (i) to address the fallout from the current shocks and (ii) to strengthen competitiveness 
for post-crisis recovery and growth. Over the rest o f 2009 and into 2010, economic performance w i l l 
continue to be constrained by the global contraction as well as the tight liquidity conditions. The f i r s t 
challenge for the authorities i s to restore economic stability and protect the social well being o f the 
population. The Government i s anchoring these objectives within a countercyclical stimulus, financed in 
large part by donors. The second challenge i s to position the economy for high ra tes o f growth as 
economic conditions improve. For a small open economy like Georgia, the Government believes this can 
only be achieved through strengthening international competitiveness and by making Georgia the 
destination o f choice for foreign investors. This requires building further on the achievements o f the past 
and completing the unfinished policy and institutional reform agenda. 

Meeting Post-Conflict and Vulnerability Needs 

3 5 . 
As discussed above, the economy faces adjustment pressures from the tw in crises. The 
Government recognizes this as a priority. Addressing these concerns over the next two years i s critically 
important in order to protect the economic and social fabric o f the country, and to assure growth and 
improved well being in the post-crisis period. This requires action on several broad fronts noted below. 

36 . 
First, the authorities are committed to the effective implementation of prudent counter- 
cyclical macroeconomic policies. The authorities have already taken important steps with respect to 
exchange rate liberalization which w i l l ease the external adjustment and improve export profitability. The 
Government has made maintaining an open trading regime a hallmark o f i t s policy. Countercyclical f i s c a l 
policies are being implemented with a strong focus on leveraging concessional donor financing and on 
offsetting rising unemployment and poverty. Restructuring on the expenditure side i s underway to keep 
the f i s c a l deficit in line with IMF targets. 

37 . 
The Government has accompanied its countercyclical program w ith shifts i n the composition 
of spending towards higher pr ior ity infrastructure and social investments as well as by improved 
efficiency o f investments. Infrastructure investments w i l l yield high returns in the short-term by the 
creation o f jobs, especially low skilled ru ra l workers. Social expenditures, on health, education, and social 
protection, have been increased from 8.2 percent o f GDP in 2007 to a budgeted 10.2 percent o f GDP in 
2009, while defense expenditures have decreased. Maintaining a focus on priority expenditures as the 
authorities adjust the budget i s essential to maximizing the impact on social well-being. A t the same time, 
public investment has increased significantly in recent years, rising from 2.8 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 9 
percent in 2007, and maintaining the same ratio to GDP in 2009 as part o f the stimulus package. Ensuring 
efficiency in the use o f these funds w i l l remain an important focus for the authorities. 

3 8 . 
Second, the Government recognizes that bolstering financial stability i s a key objective. The 
liquidity and solvency o f the banking system were strong at the start o f the cr is is , and the authorities a re 
intent on maintaining this strength. A t the same time, financial intermediation i s s t i l l low. The authorities 
are committed to a flexible monetary and exchange rate policy stance to help restore liquidity in the 
markets. In addition, the authorities are strengthening banking supervision through the Financial 
Supervision Authority (FSA), soon to be merged with the Central Bank, to monitor NPLs and ensure 
adequate provisioning to deal with increased risks to the economy. 

39. 
Th i rd , the authorities are improving the effectiveness o f the social safety net. Georgia’s 
system o f social transfers reaches 64.4 percent o f the population and includes pensions, assistance to IDPs, 
targeted social assistance (TSA), and a number o f smaller cash transfer programs. Fiscal outlays for 

11 

social trans fers have increased in the aftermath o f the economic downturn, rising from 4.6 percent o f GDP 
in 2007 to 5 . 8 percent in 2008 and an estimated 7.4 percent according to the amended 2009 state budget. 
Social transfers are important for poverty reduction: simulations indicate that poverty would be much 
higher without the transfers. In order to address current vulnerabilities but also to strengthen institutional 
arrangements for countercyclical social response, the authorities stand ready to (i) further improve 
effectiveness o f the part o f soc ia l transfers that i s already targeted (Le. TSA), ( i i ) expand coverage and 
adequacy consistent with f i s c a l constraints, (iii) continue to improve targeting o f soc ia l transfer programs, 
and (iv) further consolidate administration o f soc ia l benefits to ensure efficiency. Over the medium-term, 
implementation o f a well-articulated strategy on the social safety net w i l l promote a robust soc ia l risk 
management system in Georgia. 

40. 

Fourth, the Government i s expanding coverage o f health insurance, particularly for the poor 

and the vulnerable at affordable rates. Though increasing, overall health expenditures accounted for a 
small and insufficient 1.5 percent o f GDP in the 2008 state budget. Georgia has the highest share o f out- 
of-pocket payments in ECA -72 percent o f total health expenditures in 2006 compared with 27 percent in 
the EU -12 and 16 percent in the EU-15 (WHO Health for All). Georgian households also identify the 
health sector among the top priorities for government investment (see, e.g. L i f e in Transition report). The 
Government embarked upon an ambitious set o f health sector reforms in 2006 with the objective o f 
providing efficient, affordable, and quality health care to a l l . Health care providers are reimbursed on a 
contracted fee-for-service basis and money follows the patient. The Government has a long term vision o f 
attracting private operators for hospitals and primary health care facilities, and moving to a situation where 
those who do not quality for MIP can purchase i t through private insurers with a subsidized minimum 
benefit package. A key plank o f i t i s the Med ica l Jnsurance Plan for the poor which has already improved 
access to health care for the poor, although a significant share o f them are still not covered. The challenge 
fo r Georgia i s to fully implement i t s reform program and show the expected results from i t . The current 
economic situation makes i t important to ensure that this i s done in a fiscally sustainable manner. 

41. 

F ifth , the Government has made improving the economic and social well-being of the IDPs a 

pr ior ity . The Government has moved rapidly in the wake o f the August conflict with providing shelter 
and housing solutions and income support for the IDPs . At the same time, further work i s needed to 
provide income generating opportunities, and improve the quality o f their l i f e , particularly for the young. 
This w i l l be an ongoing challenge. The Government i s tackling this challenge in close coordination with 
the donor community. 

42. 

Sixth, the Government recognizes the importance of expanding jobs in the near term as pa r t 

o f its countercyclical efforts. While the Government w i l l seek to create long-term jobs through building 
a robust private sector, i t recognizes that targeted public investments in key infrastructure can help boost 
short term employment and income. But such near term investments are not enough. I t also recognizes 
that this w i l l need to go hand-in-hand with upgrading the skills o f the labor force (see para 49). 

43 . 

Finally, the Government i s working towards increasing ru r a l productivity and incomes. 

Although the share of agriculture in total GDP has declined significantly (from 25 percent in 1999 to about 
9 percent in 2008), i t remains an important sector in Georgia given that over 50 percent o f the population 
lives and works there. Issues depressing agricultural productivity and investments relate to fragmentation 
o f land, high transport costs and poor roads connectivity to markets, generally degraded rural 
infrastructure, and lack o f standards for agricultural products. Soc ia l outcomes also vary across Georgia’s 
regions reflecting the differences in income and poverty rates. While rural out-migration w i l l continue to 
be a natural and economic response fo r the population, Georgia has untapped comparative advantage to 
produce a wide variety o f high value agricultural commodities. But productivity and exports have fa l len 
short o f their potential and with f ree trade regimes under development with the EU and the US, there i s 
significant opportunity to increase production, exports, and create new jobs, especially in rural areas. 

12 

Environmental management i s another area, important for the ru ra l economy, where Georgia needs to seek 
a sustainable balance between stimulating private involvement and the Government’s appropriate 
regulatory and monitoring role. Similarly, greater involvement by the Government in integrated planning 
and management o f watershed areas would be appropriate. 

Strengthening Competitiveness for Sustained Post-Crisis Growth 

44. While addressing the short-term c r i s i s needs are important, the Government o f Georgia has 
a clear goal o f strengthening competitiveness and resume Georgia’s high growth path. To this end, 
the Government i s committed to continuing its strong reform approach even during the current crisis 
period. 
However, given the f i s c a l tightness, significant prioritization and focus i s needed. 
The 
Government i s moving forward in the following areas to strengthen competitiveness: 

45 . 
First, Georgia has made continued improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public 
finances an important priority. Given the scaling up o f public expenditures and the important shifts in 
composition o f expenditures that have already taken place, the priority at this point i s to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness with which these higher and better allocated inputs generate the necessary 
outputs to support economic recovery and to create the conditions fo r sustained growth in the medium 
term. First, the higher level o f expenditures implies the need to ensure that the expenditures are 
contributing effectively to Georgia’s growth and poverty reduction priorities. Second, in the current 
economic environment, greater efficiency in public finances w i l l ensure that the countercyclical f i s c a l 
response i s more effective in supporting economic recovery. Third, greater efficiency w i l l allow the level 
o f public expenditures to be reduced over time and thereby expedite the process o f re-establishing private 
investment as the engine for accelerating economic growth in the medium term. Further, the 2008 jo in t 
WB-EU Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment pointed to the need for 
further improvements in in te rna l controls, internal and external audit and f inan c ia l reporting. The 
Government has indicated i t s intention to move forward on public financial management reform including 
the gradual introduction o f International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Taken together, the 
Government i s committed to a medium-term agenda o f institutional reforms that would strengthen the 
results-orientation o f the budget and set into place incentives for efficiency, transparency, and 
accountability o f public finances. This w i l l be particularly important i f the downturn i s deeper than 
anticipated and further f i s c a l adjustments are needed. 

46. 
Second, Georgia has ‘set out a clear priority to support critical infrastructure improvement 
in order to spur foreign and domestic investment. Georgia lags comparator countries in the ECA 
region with regard to the quantity o f available infrastructure, based upon an index o f transport, energy, and 
telecommunications infrastructure (see Figure 3). A similar lag i s found in looking at the index o f 
infrastructure quality. The Government recognizes that in the current environment public investment w i l l 
need to play a key role in developing this infrastructure, especially in roads, though private participation- 
in power, airports, telecommunications, ports- 
i s already being tapped by the authorities. A key 
investment need i s o f course in the roads sector which i s essential for boosting the country’s potential as a 
transit country as well as to provide better connectivity between rural areas and market opportunities. 
Georgia i s also a key location for transit o f o i l and gas. The development o f infrastructure becomes 
particularly important to take advantage o f Georgia’s strategic location with the eventual reduction o f 
investors’ perception o f political risk.

Georgia’s transport system i s a key link in the historic “Silk Road”, which the Transport Corridor Europe 
to Central Asia (TRACECA) initiative seeks to emulate. Both in terms o f geographical location and 
existing infrastructure, Georgia i s well placed to absorb growing transport demands. I t i s located on the 
shortest route between Europe and Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Central Asian Republics through its Black 
Sea ports. Modernization o f the East-West Highway, along with rehabilitation o f feeder roads, i s estimated 
to cost over $1 billion. Therefore, the Government has asked separate international development agencies 
to rehabilitate different segments, The World Bank i s already financing the most congested section 
through i t s first and second East-West Highway Operations. Other donors including JICA, ADB and the 
MCC are financing different sections, and the Government i s seeking additional donor support for other 
segments. The Georgian railways represents another key link along the East-West transit corridor, 
especially for o i l and o i l products. I n order to increase its capacity and maximize benefits to the economy, 
Georgia i s planning to invest around $300 million in the short-run for modernization o f rail infrastructure 
from Tbilisi to the ports o f Poti and Batumi. 

48. 

On p o w e r and gas, t h e G o v e r n m e n t h a s made s i g n i f i c a n t s t r i d e s in r e c e n t y e a r s . System 

outages steadily improved in the power sector going 
from 15-20 hours per day (outside the capital) to 
virtually continuous power supply (see Figure 4). 
The turnaround in the sector was related in part to 
the privatization o f power generation and 
distribution. Georgia has also stabilized its basic 
energy security by increasing gas supplies from 
Azerbaijan through 
the new South Caucasus 
Pipeline (SCP) and other pipelines. Now that 
Georgia has obtained a more stable and reliable 
energy sector, the next challenge i s to continue to 
increase the production o f energy to meet future 
domestic demand and generate export income, while 
at the same 
time increasing the efficiency in 
domestic energy use. The most promising source o f 
additional energy supply appears to be hydropower 
where only 12 percent o f Georgia’s hydropower

potential i s being utilized. In order to implement i t s strategy focused on reaching energy security and 
export oriented production, in the near term the Government i s focused on securing private investments for 
construction o f small hydro operations. For the medium to long term, the Government w i l l explore larger 
hydropower projects. Further hydropower utilization would also require increased power transmission 
capacity fo r domestic and export purposes, an issue that i s being addressed in parallel. Strong regulatory 
involvement i s also needed, within the context o f private provision o f power. 

49. 
Third, s k i l l s development i s key to a globally competitive middle income economy. 3 8 percent 
o f firms surveyed i n BEEPS 2008 report that the skills gap i s a constraint to operating a business in 
Georgia. Thus the Government i s also upgrading skills through ongoing education reform. Reforms 
include measures aimed at reducing the gap between skills o f the labor force and the skills needed by a 
new globally integrated emerging economy. To this end, reforms include modernizing curricula, 
monitoring and reporting o f academic attainment, establishing vocational training, rehabilitating basic 
school infrastructure which has been run down through years o f disrepair and lack o f maintenance, 
implementing national and international testing i n order to benchmark progress and introducing transparent 
university entrance examinations, and strengthened per capita financing. A new education law has 
established School Boards across the country, a 12‘h grade was introduced in 2008, and the Government 
has started to benchmark learning outcomes against international ratings (TIMSS and PIRLS). The longer 
term challenge for the government i s to maintain the same level o f commitment for further advancing the 
broader education reform agenda. Now that basic reforms are underway in basic and secondary education, 
the next challenge facing Georgia i s on strengthening professional and vocational education after 
secondary school. The Government recognizes the need to consolidate and strengthen higher education, 
link higher education to the business and scientific community, and also strengthen vocational education. 

50. 
Fourth, the Government recognizes that strengthening basic public institutions and property 
rights are important in supporting private enterprise and investment. Further strengthening the rule 
o f law including protection o f property rights, increasing reliance on contracts, improving dispute 
resolution mechanisms, and further progress in adopting international technical standards are needed to 
expand business opportunities in the tradable sectors. A number o f efforts are underway in these areas. 
The Government i s implementing judicial reforms aimed at strengthening the rule o f law including 
protection o f property rights. In addition, the Government has recently decided to create , a special 
commission tasked with developing a program to adopt international and EU standards and technical 
regulations in se lec t industrial sectors. This effort has been undertaken in preparation for EU-Georgia free 
trade negotiations in the context o f the Eastern Partnership Agreement. 

5 1 . 
Fifth, the Government continues to see improvement o f the business environment as a key 
lever o f improving external competitiveness. W h i l e the business environment has 
improved 
impressively over the last five years, the costs o f tax compliance and the costs o f transactions across 
borders remain impediments to business activity in Georgia. The dimensions o f the business environment 
where relative weaknesses are found for Georgia, according to recen t D o i n g Business reports, are “Paying 
Taxes” and “Trading across Borders” (see Table 4). Along these two dimensions, Georgia significantly 
lags its overall high ranking o f 15, with the “Paying Taxes” rank at 110 and the “Trading across Borders” 
rank at 8 1 .6 BEEPS 2008 reports that one in every four firms finds tax compliance a r e a l constraint to 
operating a business and one in every five firms finds customs administration time another area where 
improvement i s needed. Significant progress has been made in recent years in introducing risk based 
customs procedures, but more i s needed. Reducing the costs associated with paying taxes and importing 
and exporting are key levers in improving external competitiveness in Georgia. In addition, there i s an 

6 

While Georgia also lags i t s overall ranking along the “Closing a Business” dimension, i t has recently adopted a new 

insolvency law that shortens timelines for reorganization o f a distressed company or disposition o f a debtor’s assets, 
which i s expected to result in improvement along this dimension going forward.

The Government also recognizes the need to strengthen its system o f monitoring and

Strengthening pub l ic sector management and budgetary processes to enable Georgia to 
better plan and meet its own development goals. 

54 . 
The centerpiece of the CPS was a se r ies o f Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs) 
which allowed the Bank to engage on critical reform areas such as energy policy, public sector 
management, and social sa fe ty nets. The CPS also supported new investments in transport and energy 
infrastructure with the aim o f improving the private sector environment and strengthening Georgia’s ro le 
as a transit corridor. The Bank also extended i t s engagement in the education sector. 
These new 
operations were complemented by 18 ongoing operations in a variety o f sectors. 

5 5 . 

As originally envisaged, the CPS relied solely on I D A financing, as at the time o f i t s 
preparation creditworthiness considerations, including debt levels, precluded IBRD. The original amount 
estimated for ID A financing was about $143 million. Subsequently, based on a dramatically improved 
performance-based IDA allocation and some frontloading, ID A was able to provide $267 million to 
Georgia over the CPS period. By the time o f the CPS Progress Report, i t was anticipated that Georgia 
would become eligible for IBRD borrowing beginning in FY09 and indeed the Bank extended its first 
IBRD to Georgia in FY09 in the amount o f $70 million (thus IDA and IBRD amounted to $337 million). 

56. 
IFC’s primary strategic focus was on the financial sector, both through advisory services and 
investments, to expand access to a wider range o f financial products. During the CPS period, IFC financed 
four banks to support access to SME finance, housing finance, and trade finance. 
I n the last year o f the 
CPS, IFC focused significant resources on ensuring that the largest commercial banks remained viable 
following the twin crises given their exposure rollover risks. I n addition to broadening the access o f 
businesses and households to financing through its support to f inanc ia l intermediaries, IFC also sought to 
make direct investments in export-oriented companies or those providing services that support overall 
private sector development. Within this objective, IFC financed Tbilisi Airport to the benefit o f Georgia’s 
travel and tourism business and two transactions to support the development o f business and retail 
infrastructure. I n total, IFC increased its committed portfolio from $54 m i l l ion at the beginning o f FY06 
to $3 12 million currently. As foreseen in the CPS, IFC also implemented a significant advisory program 
to improve the business enabling environment, strengthen corporate governance practices, and introduce 
new financial products, in particular commencing work on energy efficiency financing. 

Results achieved up to the August 2008 conflict 
57. With respect to the first pillar - promoting private sector led growth and jobs -- the Bank 
Group program led to good results. Economic growth accelerated driven by a solid macroeconomic 
foundation and deep structural reforms consolidating market economy institutions, but also helped by 
external factors (remittances, foreign direct investment). The Bank program has contributed to the 
achievement o f results primarily through the PRSO series and investments in infrastructure. 
IFC’s 
investments and advisory services were critical elements o f this pillar primarily through investments in the 
banking and real sectors. 
5 8 . With respect to the second pillar - human development and social protection - progress has 
also been strong. Ongoing investments in Education supported major achievements in curriculum reform 
and school financing. Additional achievements include restructuring the schools’ management system, 
introducing a new transparent examination system and refurbishing schools in the highest priority areas. 
The Bank also helped to fund and establish an International School o f Economics (ISET) based on 
international teaching, which i s helping to strengthen higher education and encourage use o f evidence- 
based economic policy making. IFC introduced a student loan program with Bank Republic towards the 
end o f the CPS period. The Health Project was restructured to support the new direction o f moving health 

17 

provision to the private sector and ensuring the poor had access to affordable health insurance. On Social 
Protection, the PRSO helped the Government achieve a major breakthrough - the introduction o f a new 
targeted social assistance program. On the analytic side, a key result has been the preparation o f a fu l l 
Poverty Assessment reviewing the components o f poverty and the link to jobs which was published in May 
2009. 

W i th respect to the th ird p i l lar - strengthening public sector management -- the results 
59. 
foreseen from Bank assistance have largely been delivered through progress in some specific areas 
lagged. Key achievements include improving the budget process and introducing multi-year budget 
frameworks, supported under the PRSO series, as well as through the Public Sector Financial Management 
Reform Support Project. The PRSO ser ies and the Municipal Development and Decentralization Project 
also supported a new inter-governmental financing system that transfers funds to local governments in a 
more transparent and effective manner. Though progress on public procurement has been slower, a good 
start has been made in designing an agenda and benchmarking future results through the Country 
Procurement Assessment (CPA) and the Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA). The recent 
adoption o f a new law on the Chamber o f Control elevating i t s status and establishing principles for i t s 
operations based on international standards was a major achievement under the PRSO series. Progress was 
slower in the area o f judicial reform. 

Post-Conflict Support in FY09 

60. 
The Bank modified i t s approach in the last year o f the CPS, following the August 2008 
conflict, to reflect immediate post conflict needs as well as longer term development goals. 
Significant analytic work was provided as part o f the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) as well as the 
organization with the EU o f the Donors Conference in October 2008. Analytic work was accompanied by 
additional ID A flows, and some $100 million in IDA was extended in October 2008. This included a 
Supplemental to the PRSO-4 ($40 million), a Regional and Municipal Infrastructure Development Project, 
including a special IDP housing component ($40 million), and Additional Finance for the Second East- 
West Highway Project ($20 million). 

61. 
I n the aftermath o f the conflict, the Bank worked especially closely w ith other donors and 
the Government on ID P housing. Working with the Government and using rapid response procedures, 
housing for new IDPs under the MDF credit were completed by early December, 2008, allowing many o f 
them to move out o f temporary f a c i l i t i e s before the winter onset. The Bank also maintained a continuous 
policy dialogue on economic management issues, assisted the Ministry o f Finance in improving i t s 
capacity to track external assistance, and worked closely with other donors to fac i l i ta te delivery o f their 
2008 pledges. In February 2009, the Bank also extended a Peace Building grant o f $2.2 million to further 
support the development needs o f IDPs. 

62. 
I n M a r ch 2009 , the Board approved Georgia’s first IBRD loan o f $70 million for Secondary 
and Local Roads. This had been part o f the Bank’s pledge in B r u s s e l s , and w i l l generate much needed 
short-term employment throughout the regions, as well as build connectivity and strengthen 
competitiveness for the medium-term. 

63 . 
I FC also accelerated its support i n the wake o f the August conflict, working seamlessly within 
the Bank Group on the JNA to assess the overall state o f the financial and private sectors, and provided 
about $250 million to Georgia. This included significant support (with EBRD, FMO and OPIC) to provide 
financing to the two largest banks in Georgia, Bank o f Georgia and TBC Bank. This support was critical 
and timely, enabling these banks to meet their foreign roll-over obligations in 2009 and preserve financial 
stability. IFC also supported the continuation o f trade flows through two trade l i n e s to Georgian banks and 
continued to invest in the improvement o f business and r e t a i l in fras truc ture . Within advisory services, IFC 

18 

has refocused activities to address emerging needs including conducting a survey o f SME’s on the impact 
o f the crisis and providing training to private bankers and regulators on NPL management. 

Lessons Learned 

64. 
Several key lessons are incorporated in this CPS. These are based on the results o f the Country 
Assistance Evaluation (CAE) and the FY06-09 CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). In 2008, the 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) to review the 
performance o f the Bank in Georgia from 1994 to 2007. Some o f the key lessons gleaned include: (i) the 
importance o f staying focused and consolidating lending and analytic work on the basis o f client demand, 
( i i ) strengthening coordination with other partners, including more joint work within the Bank Group, ( i i i ) 
ensuring that Bank operations work to strengthen institutions, monitoring and evaluation, and physical 
infrastructure, and (iv) continuing to integrate project implementation units into mainstream Government 
institutions and ministries. 

65 . 
The CPS Completion Report fo r the FY06-09 period concurs with these lessons, and indeed 
many o f them are reflected in this CPS. 
In addition, the CPS Completion Report highlights the 
effectiveness o f : (i) maintaining a balance between policy based and investment operations and 
maximizing the synergy between them, (ii) building a programmatic approach to both lending and 
technical assistance, keeping the focus on just-in-time assistance, and (iii) establishing a good staffing mix, 
maintaining experienced s t a f f with in-depth country and sector knowledge, while bringing in new s t a f f that 
bring fresh perspectives and ideas. 

B. 

The New Country Partnership Strategy f o r FY10-13 

66. 
The design o f the CPS strongly reflects the difficult economic situation in Georgia. The 
strategy rests on the two main strategic pillars o f the authorities’ program - (i) meeting post-conflict and 
vulnerability needs and (ii) restoring growth and competitiveness. The f i r s t pillar w i l l address key 
identified vulnerabilities including macro-stability and f i s c a l management, jobs, soc ia l services and the 
financial sector. The second pillar w i l l continue to support Georgia’s structural reform program to best 
position itself in the medium term by continuing to improve the private sector environment and build its 
role as a transit corridor. I t w i l l do so within the context o f strong selectivity (as underlined by the CPSCR 
and CAE). 

67. Within these results areas, the Bank will support good governance through four ways: (i) in 
the execution o f its fiduciary functions (auditing, procurement, monitoring) within the implementation o f 
investment operations, (ii) by building capacity within public and private institutions to provide improved 
services, (iii) integrating improvements in the monitoring and evaluation system through appropriate 
project design and implementation, and (iv) placing an emphasis on improving communications.

68 . 
Improved public resource management: In the wake o f the twin crises, preserving economic 
stability and improving the efficiency o f public expenditures gains prominence. The Bank w i l l work with 
the Government to support this, and monitor overall progress through broad economic indicators (e.g. 
growth, inflation, debt sustainability etc). Within this broad dialogue, the Bank w i l l focus strong attention 
on helping the Government manage countercyclical spending with improved prioritization o f public 
expenditures to support growth-oriented expenditures and key soc ia l programs targeted at the poor. Part o f 
the approach w i l l be to improve the effectiveness o f revenue adm in is t ra t ion , so that Georgia can maintain 
adequate f i s c a l space once the immediate donor financed stimulus declines. This includes specific support 
for strengthening the use o f the e-filing payment system, and risk-based tax and customs auditing. An 
equally important element in building a sustainable f i s c a l framework i s to strengthen systems to help the 
government to better prioritize expenditures. The D P O series w i l l play a cen tra l role in helping Georgia 
in these efforts - e.g. to build performance based budgeting processes and support adequate funding for 
soc ia l safety nets, public services, and priority infrastructure. This w i l l be accompanied by the Pub l ic 
Sector F inanc ia l Management Reform Suppor t P ro jec t , as well as annual ana ly t ic support through the 
Pub l ic Expend i ture Reviews. These efforts w i l l be supplemented by follow-up on the agenda on 
improving fiduciary controls, laid out in the 2008 Pub l ic Expend i ture F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment 
(PEFA) and the Coun try Procuremen t Assessment (CPA). The Bank’s Treasury Department w i l l also 
provide support on debt management. 

69. 
Improved performance o f key financial institutions: As an immediate response to maintaining 
f inanc ia l sector stability in FY09, IFC-with EBRD and others--provided significant financing to the two 
largest banks. Nevertheless, the banking sector continues to be a source o f risk. Georgia aims during this 
period to strengthen i t s banking and monitoring system, re-energize bank lending, and keep the level o f 
non-performing loans down. 
IFC i s playing a particularly important role in this through i t s f inanc ia l 
assistance to systemically important banks and i s also providing these banks with advisory services on 
managing NPL, risk management and corporate governance and w i l l continue to do so during the CPS 
period. IFC w i l l remain flexible and i t s mix o f products and the volume o f investments w i l l depend on the 
duration and impact o f the c r is is . The Bank Group w i l l measure i t s success primarily by the f inanc ia l 
health o f IFC-supported banks. The Bank and IFC (together with the IMF) w i l l continue to provide 
advisory services to the f inanc ia l sector during the CPS period. The Bank has an ongoing F IRST g ran t to 
ass is t the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA) in strengthening i t risk assessment o f banks. In addition, 
a banking sector d iagnos t ic o r an update of 
the FSAP w i l l be on the agenda during the CPS. Some areas 
o f the dialogue include ways to further strengthen the banking sector stability framework, build capacity to 
monitor prudential soundness indicators, develop domestic capital markets, and improve the capacity o f 
the FSA. The Bank i s also providing techn ica l assistance to improve paymen t systems to strengthen inter- 
bank transfers and the security deposit system. 

70. 
Increased Employment: A key element o f the Government’s near term strategy i s to create jobs, 
particularly to partly offset those jobs lost due to the economic downturn. The Bank w i l l help the 
Government monitor the overall levels o f job growth and employment in the country and develop sound 
employment enhancing policies. A t a more specific level, the Bank Group w i l l help create jobs directly or 
indirectly through the projects i t finances. During FY09, the Bank extended two new projects which would 
both build productivity and growth over the medium term while generating immediate employment - (i) a 
loan for Secondary and Loca l Roads, and ( i i ) the Reg iona l and Mun i c ipa l Development P ro jec t . The two 
new transport investments under consideration for FY 10 - East- West H ighway and Kakhe t i Reg iona l Road 
Improvement P ro jec t - w i l l also yield significant short term employment generation while also laying 
down the basis for increased permanent job and income growth. The P rog ramma t ic Pover ty Assessment 
w i l l continue to review labor markets and the impact o f the crisis on the population. IFC’s support to the 
banking sector helps sustain access to finance for S M E ’ s , allowing them to better weather the crises and 
keep jobs, and IFC’s direct investment and advisory services in the real sector w i l l similarly help 

20 

maintaidcreate jobs in those companies. IFC w i l l also seek to support the growth o f microfinance to 
support creation of self-employment and the sustainability and growth o f existing microenterprises. 

71 . 
Improved quality o f education: The Government recognizes that simply creating low level 
construction jobs i s not enough, and that sustainable job growth w i l l require a reduction in the gap between 
skills needed in a competitive economy and those currently available in the labor market. Georgian 
students participated in international testing in 2007, but the results were not strong which suggests further 
efforts are needed.' During the new CPS period, the Bank w i l l contribute to improved learning outcomes 
and w i l l help the country measure improved scores by students in international and national assessments o f 
student learning (TIMMS, P IRLS reporting i s being supported under the project). The Bank w i l l measure 
i t s own success through ensuring 100 percent roll-out o f the new curriculum in subsequent primary and 
secondary grades, completion o f urgent school infrastructure works, and introduction o f teacher 
certification. The Bank w i l l achieve these gains in primary and secondary education through the 
Education APL II Project which i s expected to be completed by 201 1. W h i l e higher education i s not 
included in the project, the Bank has secured Japanese and Danish Trust Funds to continue the dialogue 
on strengthening higher education and to monitor progress against Bologna standards. During the CPS 
period, the Bank w i l l also prepare an Education Sector Review which w i l l assess progress to date in both 
basic and higher education and help Georgia ensure that i t s education system i s at world class standards.

Safety Nets: 
Georgia has made major strides in introducing, w i th Bank support, an effective 
targeted social assistance (TSA) program in 2006. The Government recognizes that particularly in the 
wake o f the twin crises, i t w i l l be essen t ia l to widen this program further. The Bank w i l l continue to 
support the further strengthening the TSA through the DPO series, and w i l l ass is t in measuring the impact 
o f the TSA through the annual Poverty Assessment. While the Bank w i l l contribute to the Government's 
overall effort to strengthen social safety nets, it w i l l measure i t s success against the specific target 
contained in the DPO, e.g. the percent o f the extreme poor that receive poverty benefits through the TSA 
(2009 baseline = 30 percent; target = at least 50 percent). 

73 . 

Health Services: The Government i s in the midst o f a major health reform, with greater private 
provision o f services, combined with the introduction o f a Medical Insurance Program (MIP), subsidized 
for the poorest. The ultimate goal i s to improve key health indicators o f the population, where important 
strides have been made but further progress i s needed. The Bank w i l l continue to ass is t the Government in 
measuring progress in overall health indicators, and w i l l play a key role in supporting the Government in 
implementing i t s new health financing approach in an effective manner. This includes: (i) the 
establishment o f an effective health information data base that w i l l ass is t the Government in improving the 
implementation o f health insurance, and (ii) the specific DPO target o f a substantial increase in the share 
o f the bottom two quintiles o f population with access to subsidized health insurance (current baseline = 20 
percent in 2007). The Bank and the Government have recently restructured the ongoing Pr imary Hea l th

monitored and targeted to the poor. The DPO ser ies w i l l backstop the e f for t to extend the M I P to more o f 
the poor w i t h the effective implementation and fund ing fo r the M IP . The annual Poverty Assessment w i l l 
continue to mon i to r health outcomes and issues . The IFC i s exp lor ing potential investments in private 
health providers. At the same time, improved health f inanc ing systems must be accompanied w i t h 
strengthened ins t i tu t iona l capacity to be effective, and the Bank w i l l continue to provide analytic and 
technical support on health (and cou ld consider a fo l low -up project i f additional funds become available). 
Hea l th and safety efforts w i l l also be furthered through the Bank’s transport projects. 

74. 
M u n i c i p a l Services: Georgia recognizes the importance o f bu i ld ing loca l infrastructure not on ly 
as part o f increasing the we l l being o f the population bu t also as a key element in promo t ing growth. To 
this end i t i s supporting the improvement o f mun ic ipa l infrastructure, inc lud ing water supply, waste water 
management, loca l roads and housing through effective evaluation, prioritization, and financing o f projects 
through the Mun ic ipa l Development Fund. Georgia has also implemented a re form o f inter-governmental 
finance in order to ensure that loca l authorities have needed resources. The Bank has provided significant 
support through the M D F towards this e f for t in the past, and continues to measure i t s success in this areas 
against improve water access and quality in supported areas, as we l l as reduced transport t ime and cost on 
loca l roads. In 2006 the Bank entered in to a service agreement w i t h M C C to help supervise i t s fund ing 
through the M D F . In FY09 the Bank also extended a new Regional and Mun ic ipa l Infrastructure Pro jec t 
wh ich i s p rov id ing both regular and emergency support in l igh t o f the August con f l ic t . The Bank i s also 
administering a C i t ies Alliances G ran t for Tb i l is i to develop a C i t y Development Strategy. Project funds 
are being used qu ick ly and the Government may request additional financing in the CPS period. 

75. 
ID P s : Supporting IDPs i s a central and p r io r i ty feature o f both the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) 
and the recent Basic Data and Directions (BDD). Th is i s c r i t ica l not just to improv ing the lives o f IDPs, 
bu t strengthening country cohesion. The Bank i s wo rk ing closely w i t h the UN to assess and mon i tor the 
needs o f IDPs and has made available $10 m i l l i o n out o f the recent Regional and Mun ic ipa l Inpas t ruc tu re 
Pro jec t fo r direct assistance on IDP housing. The Bank has also approved an I D P Community 
Development G ran t to support the social and economic integration o f recently displaced IDPs in to the 
society. The EU i s also mak ing available grant resources to the Bank to support this e f for t . The Bank w i l l 
continue to mon i tor the situation w i t h IDPs through analytic wo rk on the impact of the economic cr is is on 
IDPs and i t s fo l low up JNA Progress Reports, and w i l l measure i t s own success through the specific leve l 
o f IDP housing supported under i t s project and more general integration supported by grant funds. 

Stratep ic Ob i e c t i v e 2: Strenpthen ing ComDetitiveness f o r Post-Crisis G r o w t h 

Outcome 1 : Transport time and costs reduced along key transit routes 
Outcome 2: Improved road safety 

76. 
Im p r o v e d T r an spo r t C o r r i d o r : 
The Government sees an enhanced transport corridor as a 
p r io r i ty in attracting investment and bu i ld ing on Georgia’s strategic location between Europe and Asia. 
The Bank i s p lay ing a c r i t ica l role in helping the Government achieve this p r io r i ty bo th through i t s own 
highway investments and in he lp ing to coordinate other donors. The cr i t ica l measure o f the Government’s 
success w i l l be enhanced transport t ime across the country to the market. The Bank w i l l measure i t s own 

22 

success primarily against time and costs o f the particular segments i t i s supporting directly. These projects 
w i l l continue to assist i n strengthening the transport corridor and loca l connectivity while also having a 
major impact on both immediate employment during 2009-2011 and on the regional economy (in 
particular agriculture). Indeed, improving roads in the Kakheti region i s particularly important as i t i s both 
one o f poorest regions in Georgia (46 percent poverty rate) and has considerable agriculture potential. At 
the same time, the projects w i l l help to strengthen road safety. Several key donors have come together to 
adopt the same road safety standards on their interventions, and this too w i l l be a monitorable indicator. 
The Bank’s ongoing transport program has been significant and includes Highway Improvement I and I Z , 
the Secondary and Local Roads project and technical assistance through the Infrastructure Pre-Investment 
Infrastructure Fac i l i ty . During the CPS period, the Bank w i l l extend new loans to support further 
improvements via the Third East- West Highway Project, as well as lo ca l connectivity through the Kakheti 
Regional Roads Improvement Project. Bank interventions w i l l also support greater coordination o f a 
broader multi-donor program o f rehabilitating the roads network in Georgia. The World Bank w i l l also 
continue to provide capacity building for road sector institutions. IFC w i l l seek to catalyze private 
investment in transportation and logistics through investments but also potentially through IFC’s 
infrastructure advisory services, as requested recently by the Government. On railways, the Bank Group 
and the Government may explore the potential for possible support through the IFC-World Bank 
Subnational Finance Program.

77. 
Overall Business Environment: A central element o f the Government’s growth strategy for the 
past five years has been to make Georgia investor and investment friendly, and i t has made great progress 
in this respect. The Government’s overall goal in further strengthening the business environment i s to 
restore foreign and domestic investor confidence, which has been the foundation stone fo r i t s strong 
economic growth. The Bank w i l l contribute to meeting this goal in specific ways. Clearly, improved 
transportation infrastructure through its various transport projects w i l l facilitate business activity (see 
results area 3). The Bank’s efforts to further streamlining tax and customs through the DPO series w i l l also 
be an important input. Improving financial sector intermediation (see results area 1) i s another essen t ia l 
element. The potential for SME and ru ra l development are also priorities that the Bank Group w i l l support 
(see below). Taken as a whole, these targeted results are really more than the sum o f their parts. The Bank 
w i l l play a role in the a l l o f these aspects and w i l l measure its own success against various indicators o f 
business and investor confidence which show further progress needed in specific areas (Overall ratings for 
Doing Business, BEEPS are strong, but particular sub-ratings show patches o f weakness). 
IFC w i l l 
continue to provide direct investment support to businesses and w i l l finish i t s project which has provided 
advice on improvements in licenses, permits and inspections. IFC i s exploring the potential o f future 
advisory work on the area o f food safety and w i l l work with regulators to support the implementation o f 
these processes. Complementing this, the Bank w i l l administer a trade and competitiveness grant to help 
Georgia upgrade national quality standards to encourage food and related exports so that i t can take fu l l 
advantage o f i t s low t a r i f f trade regime with the US, EU and other countries. A ROSC update to be 
conducted towards the end o f the CPS period w i l l evaluate the developments in private sector accounting 
and auditing practices. 

78. 
SMEs. SMEs have an important ro le in Georgia’s transition. They are only 8 percent o f output, 
but represent about 20 percent o f enterprise employment. Just as important, SMEs have the potential to be 

23 

engines o f innovation and growth. However, they have been hit by the economic downturn and access to 
f inance to them has become more limited. IFC’s support to the banking sector helps sustain access to 
finance for SME’s, allowing them to better weather the crises and keep jobs, and IFC’s direct investment 
in the real sector w i l l similarly help maintain jobs in those larger companies. 
IFC i s also developing 
advisory services for SMEs on c r i s i s management in a regional initiative that i s likely to include Georgia 
and would help SMEs to cope with key c r i s i s issues, such as currency devaluation, cash flow problems, the 
need to reduce operating costs, and the increased costs o f financing. IFC w i l l also seek to support the 
growth o f microfinance to support creation o f self-employment and the sustainability and growth o f 
existing microenterprises. Through i t s investments in the financial sector, IFC i s supporting microfinance, 
local currency finance, housing finance, energy efficiency finance, trade finance and reaching a range o f 
key sectors including renewable energy, agribusiness and tourism. IFC w i l l measure i t s own success by 
the amount o f its own direct and f inanc ia l sector lending support provided to SMEs (IFC w i l l target an 
SME portfolio o f at leas t $750 million by 2013 through i t s financial sector c l ien ts . This would be a level 
similar to 2007, representing a fu l l recovery after an expected decline in 2008- 10). 

7 9 . 

Rural Economy: The rural economy i s critical to Georgia’s future growth as well as employment 
generation and poverty reduction. The Government’s approach to the rural sector i s to strengthen rural 
infrastructure, while also facilitating agriculture financing and exports. To help the Government meet the 
first o f these goals, the Bank’s primary focus w i l l be on improving the transport time, particularly in the 
agriculturally important Kakheti region. I t w i l l do so through its transport pro jec ts which w i l l reduce 
transactions costs for farmers in getting products to and from local and export markets. The Bank has also 
provided support in the past for irrigation infrastructure, and while no decision on a new irrigation 
infrastructure project has been taken yet in the CPS, dialogue on improving efficient management in this 
area w i l l continue. On the Government’s second goal o f promoting agriculture financing and exports, the 
Bank w i l l actively work with farmers to strengthen supply chains in particular commodities, increase rural 
credit, and strengthen agricultural institutions including those involved in safety and certification. I t w i l l 
do so through the ongoing Ru ra l Development Pro jec t . The DPO series i s also supporting greater use o f 
food safety controls and phyto-sanitary legislation. The Bank w i l l also provide technical support to the 
Government in introducing greater food certiJication needed to increase trade, while maintaining an 
investor friendly environment and bearing in mind affordability constraints. ZFC continues to explore 
investments in agri-business, including through financial intermediaries, and may also support the 
introduction o f international principles in food safety. On the a n a l y t i c a l p o n t , IFC has just completed a 
study on the competitiveness o f particular agriculture products. The Bank’s Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) due in 2009 w i l l include a paper on rural development in Georgia. The Bank w i l l 
also do follow-up analytic work on the r u r a l investment climate and ag r icu l tu ra l supply chains. As 
Georgia has experienced both swine and bird flu, the Bank w i l l work with the Government to prepare for, 
control and respond to avian influenza, swine flu, and other infectious animalhuman diseases. I t w i l l do 
so through the ongoing Av ian Influenza project 

80. 
Energy: With the Bank’s help, Georgia has made enormous progress in privatizing the energy 
sector, providing a stable supply o f energy to i t s population and businesses, and beginning to be a ne t 
exporter o f energy to neighbors. The next step i s to facilitate investment in building increased energy 
supplies and transmission lines to neighboring markets. Towards this end, the Bank i s completing a 
feasibility study on the costs and bene f i ts o f the potential Khudoni powerplant through the ongoing 
Znfiastructure Pre-Znvestment Pro jec t . The Bank has also been helping to improve the domestic 
transmission system through the ongoing E lec tr ic i ty Marke t Support Opera t ion . Looking towards the 
future, The Bank and IFC may explore ways o f working together to attract private investors in the 
hydropower area, both directly and through f inanc ia l intermediaries, and w i l l also be coordinating with 
EBRD and E IB in this regard. In this regard, the Government has expressed interest in exploring the 
possible use of the Bank’s P a r t i a l Risk Guarantee product to maximize attractiveness for private 
investment in energy or other infrastructure projects. KfW, EBRD and EIB are in parallel considering 

24 

supporting a high-voltage power transmission l i n e to Turkey. The Bank may also extend analytic support 
to strengthen the regulatory ro le in protecting energy consumers and service quality and to address 
regional market issues . Although there i s considerable potential for Bank Group activity, the Bank has not 
yet set results indicators in this sector as options still need to be explored. 

81. 
Environment: The Bank’s operations in the environmental sector have wound down, in part due 
to the desire to focus its resources more on other areas, and in recognition o f the efforts o f other partners. 
The Bank continues to be involved in administering a multi-country grant - FLEG - which supports 
improvement in environmental legislation. I n addition, IFC i s also considering support fo r more e f f i c i e n t 
use o f energy and i s carrying out a survey o f energy efficiency practices in five countries in the region, 
including Georgia, with the potential for a project that would work with f inanc ia l institutions and SMEs to 
further support this. The Bank w i l l use i t s energy and infrastructure activities to ensure that environmental 
assessments and considerations are taken into consideration. The Bank w i l l also strengthen water supply 
through i t s ongoing Regional and Municipal Development Project. The EU i s now one o f the most 
significant partners for Georgia in the environmental field, especially engaged in assisting with solid waste 
management. The UNDP continues to administer modest resources from the Global Environment Facility 
granted to Georgia. The most active bilateral donors include Germany and the Netherlands. World 
Wildlife Fund (WWF) and International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) are international NGOs 
that continue to be active in Georgia, providing advice and assistance in biodiversity conservation, 
protected areas development, and forest management.

Implementing the Strategy 

Bank Group Instruments 

82. 

The CPS envisages a focused use of Bank instruments. Bank e f f o r t s would center around the 
Development Policy Operations, a set o f 11 ongoing investment projects which would largely complete 
disbursement during the CPS period, and new infrastructure (primarily transport) projects. Knowledge 
services would be central to enabling the CPS to aid the Government in making policy choices and 
undertaking appropriate actions to meet the objectives o f addressing vulnerability and strengthening 
competitiveness. IFC would provide critical support for both the financial and rea l sectors, using debt, 
equity and other risk management products to flexibly support both i t s counter-cyclical and longer term 
ro le . Bank and IFC trust funds would further help to strengthen ana ly t ic support. Close coordination 
between the Bank and IFC w i l l support effective implementation. M IGA also remains open for further 
projects in Georgia and in coordination with IFC i s in active discussions with the Ministry o f Finance on 
greater engagement to support more FDI. 

8 3 . 

A ser ies o f three annual DPOs, within a programmatic framework, w i l l provide both immediate 
budget support to the Government while supporting reforms in selected areas - improving public finances, 
strengthening soc ia l safety nets, and building external competitiveness. The cross-sectoral content o f the 
DPOs and their leveraging (directly or indirectly) o f budget support operations from other partners, such as 
the Netherlands, ADB or the EC w i l l give them high prominence. The CPS Completion Report highlights 
the benefits o f the programmatic approach, not just for budget support operations but also on the analytic 
side, to deliver just-in-time advice, and this practice w i l l continue throughout the program. 

84. 
Strong synergy between programmatic support under the DPOs, investment lending, and 
analytic support (from both the Bank and IFC) will continue to be a hallmark o f Bank operations. 
The importance o f this synergy i s highlighted under the CPS Completion Report. I t w i l l be important to 
harness the power o f a l l o f the Bank instruments to support reforms, institutional change and making 
efficient use o f Bank resources - as was done under the previous CPS. In light o f the tight focus o f Bank 

25 

investment operations, it w i l l also be important to b r ing other donor-supported operations in to this 
complementarity. For example, on pub l ic expenditures, the DPO-supported actions w i l l be complemented 
b y the Public Sector Financial Management Re form Support Project wh ich i t s e l f coordinates technical 
assistance across d i f feren t donors, as we l l as a* programmatic annual pub l ic expenditure review. In the 
f ie ld o f health, the DPO-supported po l icy action to widen the medical insurance coverage to the poor i s 
complemented b y technical assistance through the restructured health project to bu i ld an in forma t ion 
system to enable this to occur as we l l as analytic support. In the f ie ld o f agriculture exports, the DPO 
supports the Government in strengthening food standards to help bu i ld export markets. The Rura l 
Development Project w i l l reinforce this through practical support in rehab i l i ta t ing food safety laboratories 
and veterinary offices, as w e l l as tra in ing fo r food safety staff. Bank s ta f f w i l l also wo rk closely w i t h IFC , 
wh ich i s engaged in iden t i fy ing product competitiveness as w e l l as development o f a food safety program, 
and Sweden, wh ich i s p rov id ing analytic wo rk on food safety and testing. 
In the f ie ld o f business 
environment, the DPO w i l l leverage knowledge and advice f rom IFC . 

8 5 . 

The 11 ongoing operations w i l l enable the Bank to stay engaged in critical areas. These 
include health, education, agriculture, transportation, pub l ic f inanc ia l management, and energy. The to ta l 
amount remaining in these projects i s about $ 1 3 5 m i l l ion . This i s expected to be largely disbursed over 
the f irs t two years o f the CPS (by end-FY 11). The CPS provides for the Bank to continue to provide 
analytic support in these areas as needed after these projects close, and also the f lex ib i l i ty to consider 
fo l low -on investment lending should additional funding become available.

New investment operations by the Bank would be mainly focused on transportation. The 
Government has a made a clear p r io r i ty for the Bank in this sector for reasons discussed earlier. As the 
lead donor in transport, the Bank w i l l continue to convene regular donor meetings to ensure that a l l o f the 
different parts o f the transport corridor mesh together seamlessly. Beyond roads, the Bank w i l l stay 
engaged on a variety o f other sectors through ongoing and potential new projects, and cou ld provide some 
additional support to these, in l i n e w i t h any change in the f inanc ia l envelope o f the CPS. Interventions w i l l 
also be closely coordinated w i t h IFC and other partners to ensure that assistance i s provided in a coherent 
and effective manner. The Bank and the LFC w i l l stay engaged w i t h other key donors such as the EBRD to 
ensure financial sector sustainability. Infrastructure i s a key area where the Bank and the IFC have roles to 
p lay in cooperation w i t h EBRD, USAID, MCC , J ICA and other I F I s and donors. Th is t igh t focus i s an 
outcome o f strong donor coordination to avoid overlaps, as prov ided for in the Joint Needs Assessment. 

26 

87. 

Most Wo r ld Bank Group operations w i l l serve both strategic pillars. 

While the Bank’s 
strategy i s a two pillar approach o f addressing immediate vulnerability while better assuring long term 
competitiveness, most o f the specific Bank interventions serve both functions (see Figure 5). The 
Transport projects w i l l provide both immediate jobs and w i l l improve overall competitiveness and 
productivity. The DPO series w i l l help the Government widen safety nets and access to health insurance 
for the poor, but w i l l also work with the Government on improving trade and business competitiveness. 
The Municipal Development Project w i l l provide both housing and support for IDPs, while also addressing 
the need for longer term municipal infrastructure. IFC’s investments and advisory services w i l l help 
clients both survive the c r i s i s and become more competitive in the long run. Figure 5 below illustrates this 
overlapping situation. The balance between the two pillars has been developed in close collaboration with 
the authorities and reflects their strategic directions. 

88 . 

The proposed new lending w i l l be heavily frontloaded. Given the short-term financing needs, 

the Government has requested maximum frontloading o f financial flows from both ID A and IBRD 
sources. Frontloading i s possible in Georgia with a high confidence o f good results because o f the strong 
implementation performance o f the Government-both on policy and institutional reforms, and on roads 
projects. The frontloading i s driven by the recognition o f the need and Government commitment to put a 
stronger emphasis on countercyclical support and safeguarding social and economic outcomes i n 2009 and 
2010. IFC has also delivered a very large program ($224 million) in FY09 in response to the c r is is , and 
while i t w i l l deliver a significant amount in the CPS period, on an annual basis this may be l e s s than the 
FY09 level. 

89. 
I n terms o f amounts of lending, the Wo r ld Bank Group financing i s currently estimated at 
about $740-900 million during the FY10-13 period. The absolute amount o f new IDA and IBRD 

lending i s currently estimated to be at leas t $396 million, comprising $130 milliong utilizing the last two 
years o f IDA - 15 (IDA- 16 eligibility i s not yet determined) and $266 million in indicative IBRD funding 
(see Tables 5-6). 
IFC financing i s expected to be about $210-360 million over the period, depending in 
part on how the c r i s i s unfolds. In addition, there are currently 11 ongoing IDA and IBRD operations with 
an undisbursed balance o f about $ 1 3 5 million.

The IDA-15 resource envelope i s indicative and actual allocations are calculated annually based on IDA’S 
performance based formula, to ta l IDA available, and exchange rates. IFC lending leve ls also depend on the 
identification and negotiation o f appropriate private sector projects.

Given the lending envelope and frontloading, the program laid out has only been fully 
elaborated for FY10, and w i l l need to be further elaborated at mid-term. Georgia has started the 
process o f graduating f rom IDA to IBRD, bu t has done so dur ing an uncertain economic period. As such, 
the resource envelope has been estimated conservatively, w i thou t pre-judging the potential fo r either 
continued access to IDA under IDA -16 , or a change in the amounts o f IBRD access. A t current estimated 
levels, the Bank wou ld no t be able to prov ide much, i f any, new IDA and IBRD fund ing in the outer years 
o f the CPS. The levels o f IDA and IBRD support w i l l be reviewed at mid-term and may be adjusted to 
reflect the evo lv ing economic situation and ensure program con t inu i ty . The actual amount o f the envelope 
w i l l depend on the IDA-15 performance based allocation framework, possible I D A - 1 6 e l ig ib i l i ty , IBRD 
headroom ava i lab i l i ty and IFC ’s iden t i f ica t ion and negotiation o f appropriate private sector projects. 

91. 
The current unallocated amount of $56 million, and any additional funding that may become 
available at mid-term, would be allocated in the light o f evolving priorities. The Bank w i l l maintain 
f lex ib i l i ty in programming FY 1 1- 13. P r io r i ty areas fo r possible future support include further financing 
for the two areas - budget support and roads - wh ich are the emphasis o f the CPS, as we l l as continuing 
fund ing in certain areas where ongoing projects are w ind ing down and new lending support wou ld enable 
the Bank to continue to provide an active leve l o f engagement -- e.g. mun ic ipa l development, the social 
sectors (health, education), agriculture, or energy.

92. 
Knowledge services are central to the Bank Group’s strategy. Wh i le lending i s necessary to 
meet investment needs, knowledge services are equally important to a id po l icy choices and suggest 
appropriate actions for addressing vu lnerab i l i ty and strengthening competitiveness. Knowledge services 
wou ld be augmented b y the use o f about 20 Bank and IFC trust funds. These trust funds are we l l 
integrated in to Bank activities, e i the r d irec t ly attached to Bank projects ( for example, on rura l 
development, education and avian influenza) related to achieving CPS objectives ( for example: peace- 
bu i ld ing grant for IDP integration, Cities A l l iance grant to support mun ic ipa l p lann ing in Tb i l is i , a FIRST 
grant to help strengthen the f inanc ia l sector, and a grant to support produce testing and standards). The 
Bank w i l l also seek to use i t s knowledge services to look at practices across countries, for example in 
addressing the impact o f the global economic crisis or in the area o f trade fac i l i ta t ion . 

28 

9 3 . 
Knowledge support w i l l provide critical support on addressing post-conflict and 
vulnerability issues. Post-conflict monitoring and reporting w i l l be essential to ensuring donor funding i s 
on track and well coordinated. In July 2009 , the Bank and the UN issued the f i r s t progress report on the 
JNA and made this available to the public. A c r i t i c a l area o f vulnerability w i l l be to ensure adequate 
support to the poorest during the current downturn. The Bank w i l l build on the recently prepared Poverty 
Assessment (completed in Ap r i l 2 0 0 9 ) with annual program support in this area to help strengthen the 
analytic base. We w i l l also provide technical assistance in the fields o f health and education to 
complement investment and DPO policy assistance in these areas. Programmatic public expenditure work 
w i l l assist the Government in making critical fiscal choices in l i n e with the evolving needs for f i s c a l 
adjustment. Another critical vulnerability area i s the financial sector where both the Bank and IFC w i l l 
work together and with the IMF to provide assistance in further strengthening both the risk framework 
within banks and the framework for supervision. The Bank w i l l also work closely with the Government 
and other donors on supporting IDP economic integration. 

9 4 . 
Analytic and advisory work w i l l be equally critical f o r supporting the medium term growth 
and competitiveness strategy. The Country Economic Memorandum on Growth (expected in the f i r s t 
half o f FY 10) and the recently completed WBG Georgia Manufacturing Sector Competitiveness 
Assessment facilitated by IFC w i l l provide important foundations for future work. The Bank w i l l continue 
policy support in both transportation and energy regulation. The Bank and IFC w i l l also support the work 
under the DPO on facilitating trade through helping the Government develop a strategy as regards 
agriculture product certification. The Bank w i l l also work with the Government to follow-up on fiduciary 
benchmarking exercises in public expenditures, procurement, and financial reporting processes recently 
completed (PEFA, CPA, and Accounting and Auditing ROSC). The Bank w i l l provide additional support 

to the Government on imp rov ing monitoring and evaluation and communications. I FC w i l l continue 

i t s work on deepening the financial markets (including new lending instruments such as energy efficiency 
financing) and improving the investment climate with a particular focus on Public-Private Partnerships 
(PPPs) in energy and transport, as well as on SMEs. The Bank and the IFC w i l l further explore ways o f 
examining and addressing policy barriers to increased agriculture production.

IFC and IDNIBRD w i l l explore jo in t approaches and programs in the fo l low ing key sectors which would 
have a particularly h igh pay -o f f over the CPS period: 
I n the financial sector, The Bank, working w i th the IMF, w i l l provide analytic support and analysis on the 
overall financial sector. 
IFC w i l l in parallel provide financing and advice mainly to specific systemic 
banks bo th w i t h an eye to ensuring that they are financially strong as we l l as providing advice on non- 
performing loan (NPL) management. 
IFC w i l l also promote a range o f financing tools including 
potentially providing financing for microenterprises and SMEs, household (mortgage) lending, and energy 
efficiency lending. B y work ing at both the macro and at the individual bank level and sharing information 
across them, subject to investor confidentiality, i t i s expected that the effectiveness o f both w i l l be 
enhanced. 
I n the business enabling environment, IFC w i l l complete i t s advisory se r v ices program on decreasing the 
cost o f doing business. These efforts may be reinforced through inclusion o f related targeted re su l t s in the 
Bank’s DPO ser ies which w i l l help support improvement in tax and customs administrations and also 
support addressing non- tar i f f barriers to trade including technical barriers to trade. 
IFC measurement 
efforts w i l l be used to help monitor progress under the DPO, while the DPO provides a too l to enhance 
dialogue over IFC analysis and proposals. Further, IFC i s l ike ly to provide advisory services on improving 
practices related to food safety, complementing the DPO supported framework for improved food 
standards and the practical strengthening o f testing laboratories under the Rural Development Project. 
I n infrastructure, the Wo r ld Bank w i l l be investing heavily in transport infrastructure through various 
highway and road projects, and IFC w i l l explore private investments as we l l as how public-private 
partnerships in the transport sector can extend this effort. Similarly, in energy the Wor ld Bank and IFC 
w i l l work together to explore the potential for catalyzing private investment and public-private partnerships 
in hydropower.

Portfolio management and performance 

98. 

To ta l Bank exposure to Georgia amounts to the equivalent o f $1.1 billion, with disbursements 
amoun t ing t o $973 m i l l i o n . T h e ac t ive p o r t f o l i o consists o f 10 IDA credits, and one IBRD l o a n f o r a t o t a l 

30 

commitment o f $295 million, o f which about $135 million i s undisbursed. The Bank i s also administering 
about 20 t r u s t funds in support o f programs. 

99. 
Portfolio performance has been moderately satisfactory. The disbursement ratio'' o f the 
portfolio - - a key indicator o f overall portfolio performance - - was over 75 percent by end-FY09, well 
above the Bank average o f about 20 percent. The disbursement rate accelerated during FY09 (from 50 
percent at end-FYOS), reflecting the Government's capacity to implement projects and the urgency to 
provide countercyclical support during the current downturn. There are currently no projects in 
unsatisfactory status, though several were restructured in FY09 (Avian Influenza, Health Reform, Rural 
Development). These movements are symptomatic o f the fast paced Georgia policy environment, where 
Bank programs designed in different circumstances have had to adapt to changing approaches and 
priorities. The CPS Completion Report highlights the importance o f the Bank remaining agile in a fast 
paced environment. I t i s clear that in this environment, very active monitoring and supervision w i l l be 
necessary to maintain portfolio quality during the new CPS period. Over the CPS period, i t i s expected that 
the total number o f projects in the portfolio w i l l decline significantly. Even considering potential project 
extensions, almost a l l o f the ongoing projects are expected to close by the end o f the CPS period. 

100. Continued strong attention to portfolio and enhanced implementation support will be 
required. Infrastructure investments w i l l represent a higher share o f portfolio,, requiring more focused 
supervision to address quality issues and corruption risks. Supervision would be enhanced through (i) 
introduction o f risk-based approaches; ( i i ) more resources for risky projects; (iii) better physical 
verification o f works; and (iv) a greater re l iance on c iv i l society organizations in monitoring and 
implementation. Results w i l l be monitored through a ser ies o f Portfolio Performance Reviews, to be 
conducted regularly with the government. 

101. 
I n addition, country program management has been decentralized , The Country Director for 
the South Caucasus relocated to Tbilisi, Georgia, in la te FY09. Three additional international s t a f f at the 
level o f Country Sector Coordinators w i l l also be decentralized by end 2009. IFC has also strengthened i t s 
management presence in Tbilisi. Greater effort w i l l be taken to strengthen operations task management in 
the field and reinforce program synergies across the South Caucasus countries. Proximity to client and 
greater country presence w i l l likely strengthen implementation, policy dialogue, and results on the ground. 

102. As regards country systems, in line with the Bank's overall strategic direction i t would be 
important to continue progressively to move towards these in Georgia, recognizing that i t w i l l take time. 
The CPS Completion Report highlights the movement away from autonomous project implementation 
units towards a more integrated approach in the las t CPS, and this evolution w i l l continue under this CPS. 
Bank projects currently use the Treasury system for maintaining designated accounts. The Treasury 
system has been assessed and complies with basic Bank requirements. Other f inanc ia l management 
responsibilities are handled through regular Bank procedures and project implementing agencies have 
overall satisfactory financial management arrangements. As Government improves i t s financial 
management systems, the Bank w i l l assess i t s ability to utilize them. This includes the potential for greater 
reliance on country accounting systems with the introduction o f IPSAS and the potential for greater 
reliance on country auditing systems based on improved capacity. 

103. 
I F C has a committed portfolio o f $312 million, o f which $242 million i s disbursed (as o f June

sector clients. Portfolio performance overall has been satisfactory, but the portfolio has been impacted 
negatively by the conflict and the current f inanc ia l c r i s i s and s t a f f i s managing i t closely.

Results-Based Mon i to r ing and Evaluation 

104. The Bank will use results-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to assess how Bank 
activities are contributing to results on the ground. Monitoring progress w i l l also enable corresponding 
adjustments in the Bank’s lending and non-lending programs. The Bank w i l l also contribute to Georgia’s 
own capacity to manage for results. The Bank w i l l support this through the following:

Strengthening project supervision, including better physical verification o f works, and use o f 
country o f f i c e staff; 
Analytical work on impact simulation o f public policies and investments, for example, in health; 
Annual CPPRs based on results monitoring based upon this CPS; 
U s e o f evidence-based analysis, including benchmarking from international surveys (BEEPS, 
Doing Business), and performance ratings (CPA, PEFA); 
Improved multimedia e f fo r ts to raise awareness about results through stories o f successful impact. 

105. Statistics: Reliable statistics are essential to an effective and transparent development program. 
As noted, the Government has recently submitted a new law in Parliament to strengthen statistics including 
making the S ta t is t ics Agency an independent agency, adoption o f internationally recognized statistical 
methods and standards, and improvement in institutional and s t a f f capacity. The DPO series w i l l support 
adoption and implementation o f this policy, and annual Poverty Assessments w i l l also support such 
improvements. The Health and Education Projects are also working on strengthening the s ta t is t ica l 
databases in these two fields. 

D. 

Communications Strategy 

106. While Georgia has pursued an impressive and speedy public policy reform approach, i t 
needs to continue deepening its communication on the rationale fo r these choices and involve society 
Improved transparency and 
in these discussions so as to promote sustainable development. 
participation are fundamental for voice, accountability and good governance. Soc ia l awareness and 
involvement through communications and outreach can build support that w i l l ultimately enhance the 
sustainability o f reforms. 

107. 
T o this end, many o f the Bank’s projects will support increased stakeholder feedback and 
involvement in order to improve development outcomes. Further, many policies - for example in 
soc ia l and health sector reforms - - would benefit from transparency and public participation on how they 
are being implemented and how citizens can make most use o f them. Therefore, the Bank w i l l scale up i t s 
communications strategy on its own work, and ass is t the Government in doing so more broadly. This 
could, for example, include working with the Government and other donors to regularly host workshops 
and seminars around key policy issues for a wide audience. 

E. 

Partnerships 

108 . Building and maintaining partnerships with other donors and international institutions will 
be critical to the success o f the CPS. The CPS Completion Report highlights the importance partnerships 
have made during the last CPS to leveraging resources and knowledge and this emphasis w i l l continue and 
deepen under this CPS. There are two main elements in this. 

0 Post-Conflict Support Follow-up and Coordination: First, the Bank i s playing a leadership ro le 
in following up and coordinating donor flows following the October donors conference. To this 
end i t w i l l periodically work with other donors to prepare a progress report. The first one was 

3 2 

prepared in July 2009 and has been made available to the pub l ic . Ensuring that these pledges are 
met in a t ime ly and coordinated manner w i l l p lay a large ro le in the overa l l sustainability o f 
Georgia’s development strategy. At the donors conference, 38 countries and 15 international 
ins t i tu t ions participated and pledged a to ta l o f $ 4 . 5 b i l l i o n over three years. In the per iod f rom 
August 2008 through A p r i l 2009 , a to ta l o f $1.7 b i l l i o n has already been committed. 

Sector Specific Coo rd ina t ion : Second, the Bank ’s program i t s e l f i s quite focused. Wo rk ing 
closely with other donors w i l l therefore be essential to ensure that the Bank’s operations are 
implemented w i th in a wider context o f support. In l igh t o f these efforts, the Bank i s strengthening 
coord ina t ion in a w ide range o f areas as discussed be low . 

109. 

Transportation Infrastructure: The Bank i s perhaps most active in supporting coord ina t ion in the 
area o f transportation. Several international institutions and donors, inc lud ing ADB, J ICA and M C C are 
p rov id ing support fo r various segments o f the transportation sector. USAID also has a project in road 
safety that it i s coordinating w i t h the W o r l d Bank . Wh i le these are no t directly cofinanced with the W o r l d 
Bank, the Bank plays a leadership ro le in convening per iod ic donor discussions and ensuring this wo rk i s 
designed and implemented in a coherent manner. This coordination i s par t icu lar ly impor tan t in ensuring 
that donors are p rov id ing support w i th in a med ium t e rm approach to roads, use common standards in road 
construction, and coordinate their approach to road safety as w e l l (see B o x 3 fo r details). 

Box 3: The Bank’s Leadership Role in Coordinating Transport Investments in Georgia 

The Government’s program to rehabilitate i t s transport corridor and feeder roads i s a multi-donor effort which 
requires strong coordination. In the las t few years the Bank has taken the lead in organizing annual transport 
donor conferences for Georgia and the South Caucasus. The latest Georgia meeting, specifically dedicated t o the 
road sector, was held i n May 2009 co-chaired by the Bank and the Minister o f Regional Development and 
Infrastructure. The Government’s strategy for the development and financing o f the road sector was presented, 
and donors’ programs and ways o f addressing financing gaps were discussed. T h e Bank and the Government 
have been organizing such meetings on a regular basis in order to keep close coordination between the donors 
and the Government. The Bank i s committed to keep leading the effort with the government. 

Coordination i s particularly important to ensure that each o f these segments i s financed with compatible 
technical standards, social and environmental safeguards, and road safety measures. For example, the Bank has 
developed very close cooperation with two key financiers, the ADB and JICA, on a number o f important 
matters: (i) The ADB i s considering undertaking a similar road safety activity in their upcoming project on the 
E-70 to the one proposed under the Bank-financed Third East-West Highway Improvement Project for the E-60 
highway; ( i i ) The Bank, ADB and JICA agreed to apply similar implementation arrangements developed by the 
Bank and the Government, and ( i i i ) the three organizations w i l l coordinate approach on overall TA and training. 

The Bank also sponsors an annual transport donor coordination meeting for the three South Caucasus countries 
held in Paris. These meetings target a l l key modes o f transport: railways, roads, maritime, and aviation. T h e 
most recen t such meeting was held in June 2009 and was attended by a l l key donors active in the region. Donors 
have confirmed the high value they see i n this cross-country effort and have expressed hope that the Bank w i l l 
continue leading this effort. 

110. Macroeconomic Suuuort: The Bank i s wo rk ing closely with the IMF in development po l icy 
lend ing and overa l l economic po l icy dialogue. The SBA has played a c r i t ica l ro le in supporting Georgia’s 
overa l l macroeconomic situation. The Bank’s D PO program i s also being cofinanced by the Netherlands. 
The E U and the ADB also prov ide substantial parallel budget support. The Wo r ld Bank w i l l continue t o 
mon i tor the macroeconomic situation in close co l labora t ion w i t h the IMF , inc lud ing per iod ica l ly upda t ing 
i t s j o i n t debt sustainability analysis, as w e l l as fiscal e f f ic iency . 

3 3 

11 1. 
IDPs : A wide range o f donors are assisting in providing support to IDPs in the aftermath o f the 
conflict including the UN, USAID, KfW, the EU and the World Bank. The Government has taken the lead 
in coordinating these e f for ts to ensure compatibility in housing and related assistance, with the IDP 
Steering Committee convened by the Ministry o f Refugees and Accommodation playing a key role. 

112. Financial and Private Sector: The IMF and the World Bank are working together on the financial 
sector, which plays a critical role in the IMF program. This i s complemented by lending, equity and 
techn ica l assistance support,by IFC, EBRD and ADB. I FC and EBRD have been working particularly 
closely in providing coordinated investment funding to the largest systemically important banks. IFC also 
relies on CIDA and BP for their support for advisory work on the business enabling environment and 
corporate governance. 

113. Public Sector Management: The World Bank finances the Public Sector Financial Management 
Reform Support Project together with other donors including DFID, SIDA and the Netherlands. The Bank 
and the E U also jointly prepared a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) analysis and 
benchmarking. The EU i s also providing parallel technical assistance to a ss is t the Government in meeting 
DPO benchmarks on multi-year budget planning. GTZ i s providing parallel technical assistance to the 
Chamber o f Control to assist in aligning audit methodology as per the requirements o f the new law. 

114 . MuniciDal Infrastructure: The World Bank helped to establish the Municipal Development Fund 
(MDF) which has s ince evolved in to the premier channel by which various donors channel funds. 
Through this mechanism the ADB and the EBRD are providing parallel support to Bank funds through the 
MDF. The US MCC i s also providing funds through the MDF, and has contracted with the World Bank to 
supervise implementation o f i t s funds for a fee . Sweden i s also providing support on water supply. 

115 . 
Enerm Infrastructure: 
The World Bank Group has been preparing a feasibility study for a 
particular hydropower operation along the Khudoni River. In parallel, the EBRD and EIB have been 
reviewing the potential o f other hydropower operations and KfW, EBRD and EIB are considering 
supporting the construction o f a large regional high voltage power transmission l i n e to Turkey. USAID i s 
reviewing the potential for gas storage. The Government i s taking the lead in coordinating these efforts to 
ensure a l l o f these pieces f i t together in a coherent strategy. 

116. Education: The Japanese funded PHRD fund i s providing an implementation grant attached to the 
Bank project that provides critical techn ica l assistance funds to complement Bank provided investment 
funds. Other donors providing parallel technical assistance, including in the field o f vocational education, 
include USAID, KfW, EC, UNICEF, UNDP, SIDA, and the Netherlands. 

117. 

Health: Health care reform agenda i s being supported by different donors and international 
organizations, e.g. USAID, EC, Open Society, Global Fund, and various UN agencies. 

118 . 
Agriculture: 
The World Bank’s Rural Development Project i s cofinanced with F A D and a 
Japanese funded PHRD grant. Other donors providing significant assistance in this area include USAID, 
EC, FAO, UN, SIDA and MCC. Sweden w i l l provide ana ly t ic support for land registration and food 
safety and testing, and this w i l l be coordinated with the Bank’s DPO and agriculture e f fo r ts . 

V. 

Creditworthiness and Risks 

119. 
The largest risk i s that the downturn could be longer and deeper than anticipated. The 
proposed strategy i s premised on a temporary downturn, during which i t would be appropriate to support 
an economic stimulus to enable Georgia to maintain priority investments and social programs. Continued 
deep reforms would enable growth and fore ign investment to pick up a f te r this period with les s 

3 4 

governmental and donor financing needed. However, investor confidence, key to the Government’s 
strategy o f mobilizing private capital inflows, has been weakened by the global downturn and i s sensitive 
to political developments, both domestic and regional. In the event o f weaker than anticipated foreign 
investment and hence a more prolonged downturn than anticipated, the Government would need to adjust 
its approach in the following areas, and the Bank would need to support this adjustment, in c lose 
coordination with the IMF : 

0 Fiscal: The large f i s c a l deficit in FY09 i s an appropriate countercyclical measure that i s supported 
by increased donor funding. However, i f there i s a longer than anticipated downturn, the 
Government w i l l need to further prioritize expenditures and undertake f i s c a l adjustment. This i s 
one reason that the Bank has made the improvement o f resource management, including the 
introduction o f results based budgeting, a central part o f its strategy. The Bank w i l l continue to 
monitor the situation closely and w i l l as part o f its dialogue around the DPO provide advice to the 
Government on the public investment program, ensuring that continued support for basic social 
assistance i s maintained. The IMF-supported program provides a framework for an orderly 
adjustment in the medium-term. 

0 

j&t: 

Public external debt going into the c r i s i s had come down to about 18 percent o f GDP in 
2007, providing a cushion for the Government to take on more debt to support f i s c a l expenditures. 
Increased donor and international institutional financing i s not generally expected to overburden 
the Government - about half o f donor funding pledged in October 2008 are grants and the rest i s 
either concessional or long term market-based loans. As a result, though public debt to GDP i s 
expected to r i s e to the range o f 40 percent in the next few years, debt levels are projected to stay 
within prudential thresholds. However, difficulties in restoring market access would complicate a 
challenging debt service profile due to the fact that a peak o f repurchases to the IMF coincides 
with a $500 million Eurobond maturing in 2013. With an expected pickup o f growth and foreign 
investment over the medium term, these repayments are manageable. However, if growth and 
foreign investment continue to be constrained over the medium term, the Government w i l l need to 
engage in careful debt management to ensure sustainability. Debt management w i l l remain a 
cen tra l part o f our dialogue with the Government. The Bank and the IMF w i l l continue to work 
on the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) during 2009 to further build the basis for good hebt 
management policies. The Bank’s Treasury Department i s also providing support on debt 
management. 

0 Financial: During FY09, IFC, EBRD and others provided strong support to systemically 
important commercial banks to ensure that immediate repayment obligations were met. Near term 
risks have thus receded but the sector remains vulnerable to an extended downturn. 
IFC i s 
providing technical support directly to banks on managing liquidity and non-performing loans. 
Although IFC w i l l seek to diversify its support towards rea l sector investments during the CPS 
period, i t remains committed to supporting the financial sector as needed. The ADB i s also 
discussing possible support to the banking sector. I f foreign private investment i s not available at 
past levels to support lending growth, the Bank Group w i l l work with the Government to help 
expand domestic resource mobilization. 

120. 
Econom ic unce r ta in t ies w i l l also affect Georgia’s cred itworth iness: 
Prior to the August 
conflict, Georgia’s creditworthiness had been improving and i t was able to issue a large Eurobond in 2008 
that was significantly oversubscribed. Notwithstanding Georgia’s 
impressive achievements 
in 
macroeconomic policy and performance and structural reforms prior to the dual crises, Georgia’s 
creditworthiness since then has been constrained by domestic and regional tensions which have 
undermined investor confidence and private capital inflows. Prospects for a medium term recovery and 

3 5 

im p r o v e d c red i two r th iness in the pos t-cr is is p e r i o d w o u l d be p r om o t e d by adequate p o l i c y ad jus tmen t and 
an easing o f r e g i o n a l and domes t ic tensions. 

121. 
The availability o f Bank resources represents another source o f risk. The curren t resource 
enve lope has been f ron t loaded and has been set conserva t ive ly , w i t h o u t p r e - j u d g i n g the po ten t ia l f o r e i ther 
con t inued access t o IDA under IDA-16, o r im p r o v e d access t o IBRD. As a result, w i t h o u t a change in this 
envelope, the B a n k w o u l d have v e r y l i t t l e n e w resources (ou ts ide o f I F C funding) t o make ava i lab le t o 
Geo rg ia in the ou ter years o f the CPS. I f g r ow t h increases as planned, and Georg ia ’s cred i twor th iness 
ind ica tors imp rove , access t o ma rke t based resources c o u l d be strengthened. On the o ther hand, if the 
s i tua t ion deve lops where increased access t o ma rke t based resources i n c l u d i n g IBRD i s mo re l im i t e d , 
access t o IDA-16 might be considered. Ensuring adequate resources across the B a n k G r o u p w i l l be a k e y 
e lemen t o f the m i d - t e rm r e v i ew o f the CPS t o ensure tha t the B a n k con t inues t o have adequate ins trumen ts 
t o suppor t Georg ia . 

122. 
Beyond these key risks, there are other issues that bear watching. W h i l e the Gove rnmen t ’s 
c omm i tm e n t t o m o v e f o rw a r d o n p o l i c y re fo rms i s clear, there i s a need t o con t inue s treng then ing 
commun ica t ions and d ia logue with c i v i l soc ie ty t o ensure tha t p o l i c y re fo rms have a s trong founda t ion o f

Annex 2: GEORGIA -- CPS COMPLETION REPORT: FY06-09 

1. 

This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) evaluates Bank Group 
assistance to Georgia for FY06-FY09. The CPS (report number 33295-GE) was discussed by the 
Board in September 2005. A CPS progress report (report number 43354-GE) discussed by the Board 
in June 2008 assessed progress in implementing the CPS and indicated were revisions o f the program 
were needed. This Completion Report examines the relevance o f the CPS to Georgia’s longer term 
goals, the achievement o f CPS outcomes, and Bank Group performance in furthering the CPS 
outcomes. The report draws on project appraisal, supervision and completion reports and the 
evaluations o f IEG, including an CAE prepared in 2007. Other sources include the Government’s 
own assessments, the IMF program documents, various national and international studies and 
surveys, as well as inputs from former and current Government officials, other stakeholders in 
Georgia, and the Bank country team. 

I. 

Re levance o f CPS 

B a c kg round 

2. 

The Rose Revolution in November 2003 was a defining moment for Georgia. The new 
Government o f Mikhail Saakashvili that was swept into power inherited a near failed state. Georgia 
under President Eduard Shevardnadze was an early reformer. From 1992 to the turn o f the century a 
range o f economic and political reforms were implemented to se t Georgia on the path to a market 
economy and democracy. However, by the early 2000s, reform momentum sputtered to a halt. 
Political power was increasingly fragmented, corruption and crime had skyrocketed and tax revenues 
had plummeted giving r i s e to massive arrears in pension payments and teacher’s salaries. Also, 
infrastructure f e l l into a state o f near collapse, with most o f the country without power, and the road 
network increasingly deteriorated. 

3. 
The new Government moved quickly to reverse the deterioration. They quickly restored 
macro-economic stability and improved f i s c a l discipline and revenue collection which enabled them 
to eliminate arrears and pay bills. The Government also launched aggressive reforms in the social 
sector and o f the administrative and regulatory regime facing the private sector. Importantly, the 
Government signaled a major war on corruption by sacking the entire t ra f f i c police force and 
replacing i t with a completely new patrol police structure and followed up by holding Minister’s 
accountable for cleaning up corruption in their ministries, and developing a comprehensive national 
anti-corruption strategy. The early reforms yielded remarkable results. Growth rebounded by 2005,’ 
tax revenues grew from 14 % in 2003 to nearly 20% in 2005, and external debt f e l l sharply. 
Moreover, CPIA scores improved dramatically for both 2004 and 2005. 

4. 
Nevertheless key challenges still faced the Government in the 2006 - 2009 period. First, 
Growth, though accelerating had yet to increase employment, particularly in the ru ra l areas. Second, 
the poor state o f infrastructure, particularly roads and energy supply, continued to have a detrimental 
impact on the economy and public welfare. Third, far reaching reforms in education, health and 
social protection were progressing but further work was needed to sustain the momentum in these key 
areas. Finally, public administration reforms needed to progress further, particularly in budgeting and 
expenditure management, intergovernmental f isca l relations, procurement and financial management, 
the judicial system, and c iv i l service management. 

T h e Go v e rnm en t S t ra tegy 

5 . 
The previous Government had completed a PRSP, entitled the Economic Development and 
Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) just prior to the Rose Revolution. The new Government 

43 

acknowledged the EDPRP and broadly accepted the analysis in the report, 
To help direct 
expenditures to priority areas, the new Government developed a Basic Da ta and Directions document 
(BDD) that was used to kick o f f each year’s budget cycle in the context o f a newly adopted medium- 
term expenditure framework. The BDD spelled out the Government’s strategy over a three year 
rolling time frame, and contained strategic priorities that were a l l broadly in line with the EDPRP. 
Priority areas identified in the BDD were rehabilitation o f the road network, reform o f basic 
education, improvements in the soc ia l protection system, strengthening o f public sector management 
and improvement o f the business environment through regulatory and administrative reform. An 
overarching objective was to continue Government wide e f f o r t s to eliminate corruption. 
The 2006 - 2009 CPS Design 
6 . 
The CPS design supported the Government’s long terms goals o f reducing extreme and 
overall poverty and improving living standards. Support for these goals focused on tw o areas where i t 
was f e l t the World Bank Group had comparative advantage: (i) enabling income and employment 
generating growth; and (ii) improving human development and soc ia l protection. The CPS also 
focused on one intermediate objective -- improving efficiency in public services. These three areas 
formed the pillars o f the CPS. Addressing corruption and governance issues was seen as an 
overarching theme that was to be addressed in each o f t h e three pillars. 

7 . 

The program consisted o f a mix o f policy based and investment lending supported by 
analytical work. The Bank and the Government agreed to narrow the focus o f Bank assistance to a 
few key areas as i t was f e l t the portfolio going into the new CPS period was too fragmented. As a 
result, the number o f investment loans under implementation declined from 19 to 11 over the CPS 
period. 

Identified R i s k s 

8 . 

The CPS identiJedJive risks, all of wh ich were considered to be moderate. F i rs t , a slowing 
o f the reform process was deemed a risk arising from a possible lack o f political w i l l to overcome 
vested interests or political instability. This possibility weighed heavily on the minds o f the 
Government, which believed i t only had a limited window o f opportunity to act before political costs 
began to l im i t i t s ability to act boldly. Second, the CPS identified a fiduciary risk given past 
Government failure at expenditure management. The quick and substantial progress in expenditure 
management and fighting corruption was the product o f strong leadership and commitment across the 
Government and broad public support. The concern was whether political and popular support for 
strong anti-corruption measures could be sustained. T h i r d was the risk o f c iv i l conflict. The CPS 
noted that existing regional tensions would continue until a permanent resolution to the crisis was 
found and as a result a degree o f uncertainty would exist that would a f fec t the welfare o f the people 
and act as a drag on t h e investment and business environment. Fou r th , the CPS saw a risk o f a 
deteriorating external environment. The CPS cited as examples o f such risk the possible collapse in 
external markets or disruptions in o i l gas, or energy supplies. Thefinal risk indentified by the CPS 
was natural calamities. In the previous CAS period Georgia had been afflicted at various times by 
floods, drought and earthquakes a l l o f which set back development progress. 

Overall Assessment o f CPS Relevance 

9. 
This CPSCR rates the CPS design and the identiJcation of risks as Satisfactory. The CPS 
design was fully consistent with the new Government’s priority and reflected high Government 
ownership o f the program. Overall, the Bank was able to deliver significantly more resources and a 
larger number o f investments then anticipated in the CPS due both to Georgia’s excellent results in 
the performance based allocation mechanism and i t s quick accession to IBRD status. In fac t Georgia 
went from receiving h a l f i t s resources in FY05 as ID A grants due to its status as a fragile state, to 

44 

IBRD eligible in three years. Overall, nearly $ 3 3 7 million in credits and loans were approved during 
the CPS period compared to the $143 programmed in the CPS report. Moreover, the design o f the 
CPS proved to be robust. I t was able to accommodate Georgia’s rapidly evolving reform program, 
allowed the Bank Group to ramp up lending as more resources became available and provided crucial 
support to Georgia in the aftermath o f the August 2008 c r i s i s in the context o f a coordinated multi- 
donor response. The risks identified by the CPS were relevant especially the risk o f regional conflict 
and the risk o f deteriorating external environment. While in hindsight the risk rating for these two 
factors could have been set higher then moderate, the design o f the CPS has proven to be sufficiently 
resilient to help mitigate the effects o f the twin calamities that befell Georgia. Remarkably, most 
targets in the CPS were achieved, and many exceeded despite the twin shocks showing both the 
strength o f the CPS design and the determined e f fo r ts o f Government to overcome the obstacles 
thrown i t s way. 

11. 

Results Assessment 

10. 
The CPS period covers two distinct time segments - the first 3 8 months up to August 2008 
where reforms, growth, investments were a l l on a strong upward trajectory - and the last 10 months 
where the August 2008 con f l ic t , followed closely by the global economic crisis created a serious 
challenge for the Government in terms o f declining economic growth, falling FDI and tax revenues, 
and increases o f poverty and unemployment. The Government’s ability to meet this challenge i s 
bolstered by strong performance in macro-economic management and i t s aggressive reform agenda. 
Strong donor support following the August c r i s i s i s also helping to mitigate the impact o f the twin 
shocks. 

A. Overall Development Outcomes 

1 1. 
Enabling Income and Employment Generating Growth. With the exception o f the las t 10 
months, long term growth exceeded expectations in the CPS. In fact, growth in the first three years 
covered by the CPS (FY06-FY08, was more than double projections in the CPS and for the overall 
CPS period average growth exceeded expectations. The growth did create jobs, particularly in the 
f inanc ia l and construction sectors, but gains were offset by labor shedding elsewhere, particularly in 
the public sector so that overall employment levels stayed stable, while labor productivity likely 
increased. Growth in the ru ra l sector also continued to lag. S ince the twin shocks, economic growth 
has slipped and unemployment has increased. But Government actions to increase public 
investments, restart credit flows in the banking system and expand targeted benefits are helping to 
mitigate the impact o f the events o f the last few months. Moreover, debt levels are quite low which i s 
helping create some space in dealing with the cr ises . Mo re importantly the CPS’ medium term 
outcomes were for the most part achieved or exceeded laying a strong foundation fo r job creation 
once the Georgian economy begins recovery. That said the down-side risks are substantial. A further 
deterioration in the global economic climate, an unexpected c r i s i s in the financial sector, or continued 
political tensions could prolong the economic slide significantly and delay Georgia’s recovery. 

12. 
Fostering Human Development and Improving Social Protection. Soc ia l sector reforms 
have been significant, and in many instances the reforms outstripped what had been envisaged in the 
CPS. Expenditures for health education and social protection increased steadily throughout the CSP 
period with the share o f the state budget going to the social sectors increasing to 3 6 percent in the 
2009 budget, up from l e s s than 30 percent in the 2005. For education outcomes, assessments o f 
student learning based on international exams are just beginning, so i t i s not possible to draw 
conclusions at this time about trends in education outcomes. Nevertheless, the nearly completed 
introduction o f the new curriculum, continued extensive teacher training, improved assessments, and 
greater loca l autonomy in financing and management o f schools a l l point to a strong likelihood o f 
improvement in outcomes in the coming years. Health sector reforms were characterized by f i t s and 

45 

starts early in the CPS, fo l lowed b y a major reform push in the last two years that has emphasized 
private prov is ion o f health services and a l im i ted ro le for the state as a regulator and po l icy 
formulation. Significant progress has been made in health care financing w i t h the launching o f three 
t ie red health care financing approach inc lud ing a basic benefit package funded by the state for the 
poor, state insurance fo r certain c i v i l servants, voluntary participation in private plans par t ia l ly 
subsidized b y the state, and private insurance for those in the forma l sector. Soc ia l p r o t e c t i o n 
measures have also been improved w i t h the introduction o f targeted social benefit package aimed at 
the extreme poor consisting o f a cash payment and a basic medical bene f i ts package. Pensions have 
also been increased. 

1 3 . 

Improving Efficiency o f Public Services. 

So l id outcomes were achieved in improved 
pub l ic budgeting and expenditure management and be t ter inter-governmental fiscal relations. Judicial 
reforms have progressed, especially in the last two years, though a widespread perception s t i l l persists 
that courts lack independence. Bank-Group involvement in jud ic ia l system dur ing CPS per iod was 
l im i ted and confined to the f i r s t year o f the CPS. Other donors, namely the US, UNDP and EU have 
continued to support jud ic ia l re form and their efforts appear to be gaining traction. Progress has been 
made on financial management and procurement though issues s t i l l remain to be tackled. 

14. 

Reducing Extreme and Overall Poverty. The three goals covered by the t h r e e p i l lars o f the 
CPS aimed at he lp ing achieve the Government’s overall goal o f reducing extreme and overall 
poverty. The just completed Georgia Poverty Assessment uses available data to measure poverty 
levels and trends. A L i v i n g Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) financed by the Bank in 2007 
shows overall poverty at 23 .7 percent and extreme poverty at 9.3 percent. Poverty i s concentrated in 
rura l areas, specifically in the northern mountainous arc. Wh i le these numbers are lower than those 
reported by the Department o f Statistics, they are not directly comparable. Other data, namely on real 
household monetary incomes, however, strongly suggest declining poverty over f rom 2003 through 
2 0 0 7 . Over this period Real Household Monetary income grew on average 7 . 9 percent. Increases 
were larger in rura l areas then in urban areas and were largest fo r the lowest qu in t i le o f the population 
largely as a result o f the introduction o f the targeted social assistance program. Non-income 
indicators o f poverty such as access to infrastructure and social services also improved significantly 
over the period. Improved supplies o f power, available on a two- t ier p r ic ing structure w i th low tar i f fs 
fo r low consumption levels, better roads, access to the basic bene f i ts package fo r health, and 
improved administration o f social benefits a l l made l i f e a b i t easier for the poor. 

15. 

Impact on Poverty o f the August Events and the World Economic Crisis: The double 

shocks o f the August 2008 con f l ic t and the global financial crisis risk undermining Georgia’s poverty 
reduction efforts. As a result o f these shocks the poverty headcount i s forecasted to go up f rom 23.7 
percent in 2007 to 27 .8 percent in 2009 . Were i t no t fo r the negative welfare impacts o f the tw i n 
crises, the poverty headcount in Georgia cou ld have been expected to decline f rom 23.7 percent in 
2007 to 19.2 percent at the end o f 2 0 0 9 . Th is 2009 gap in the “crisis” pover ty headcount versus “a no 
crisis” poverty headcount represents in absolute t e rm s about 350,000 poor people. 

16. 

Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Pr ior to the impact o f the twin 

shocks, Georgia was on a path to achieve most, if not a l l m i l lenn ium goals, and despite the recent 
setbacks i t may w e l l achieve a l l goals, though the impact o f the crises on poverty i s indeed substantial 
and w i l l be d i f f icu l t to overcome in the near te rm . 
In other areas, good progress have been made in 
reducing infant and maternal mortality, and w i t h the educational re form underway Georgia stands 
poised for a significant improvement in education outcomes. Gender equality also broadly exists. 

46 

B. Overview o f Results Delivered by the CPS program. 

17. 
The CPS program had three pillars; (i) Enabling Income and Employment Generating 
Growth; (ii)Improving Human Development and Soc ia l Protection; and (iii) Improving Efficiency in 
Public Service. This CPS Completion Report finds that the results for each o f the three pillars were 
sa t is factory. 

Pillar 1: Enabling Income and Employment Generating Growth 

1 8 . Within Pillar 1, the CPS focused on six specific areas: (i) Addressing corruption and 
governance issues; (ii) removing administrative barriers to PSD; (iii) improving electricity and gas 
infrastructure; (iv) improving highway infrastructure; (v) improving access to rural infrastructure and 
services; and (vi) sustainable uses o f forestry and other natural resources. The Beeps surveys for 
2002 showed problems in nearly a l l these areas, which, while beginning to be addressed at the outset 
o f the CPS period were a l l still relevant areas o f focus. 

19. 
The operational instruments to deliver the assistance included a Poverty Reduction Support 
Operation (PRSO) ser ies o f credits and grants, investment operations in the power, transport, 
municipal infrastructure, rural, forestry and natural resources sectors and ana ly t ica l work. Among the 
analytical work, the Programmatic Poverty Assessment supported Government efforts to improve 
social protection measures and better target assistance to the poor. IFC provided financing to 
commercial banks, and for airport construction and real estate development. IFC technical assistance 
and advisory services were provided to improve the business environment through FIAS and PEP. 
The four PRSO operations, plus one Supplement following the August 2008 conflict focused on four 
areas - (i) strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency and transparency; ( i i ) improving 
electricity and gas sector services; (iii) improving the environment for private sector development and 
(iv) improving soc ia l protection, health and education. 

1A. Addressing Corruption and Governance Issues Affecting the Business Environment 

20. 
The CPS highlighted that corruption had so tainted the business environment that i t drove up 
the cost o f doing business, limited foreign capital inflows and distorted resource allocation. To 
improve the business environment the CPS identified measures aimed at reducing the opportunities 
for corruption at points o f service such as customs, inspections, licensing, taxation, and the court 
system. The CPS results matrix uses BEEPS 2002, 2005 and 2008 to measure results. The analysis 
i s complicated by the fac t that the 2008 results are not comparable to the earlier surveys due to 
changes in methodologies and in the questionnaire. Surveys o f voter attitudes conducted by the 
International Republican Institute (IRI) also provide useful information on the level o f corruption. 
Doing Business and other surveys compliment the analysis. Finally, Transparency International’s 
corruption perception index provides a good snap shot o f evolving corruption perceptions in Georgia.

2009 by the IRI showed 97% o f 
the respondents had not paid any 
bribes in the last 12 months. 
Similar results were recorded 
over the last 3 years suggesting 
that anti-corruption efforts have 
remained robust during the CPS 
period.

The

sustained improvements in education outcomes in the years to come. After a slow s tar t , and then an 
abrupt sh i f t in Government Hea l th care strategy, the Government reforms in the health sector have 
begun to ga in trac t ion . Ove ra l l services improved and c r i t ica l hea l th indicators have begun to show 
improvements. Good progress in reforming the social assistance system and improvements in the 
pension regime has served t o expand coverage and better target assistance, and as a result many 
thousands of Georgians have been kept f r o m s l ipp ing in to extreme pover ty . F i n a l b , changes in the 
organization and management of 
loca l Government units and steady improvements in the capacity of 
municipalities and loca l government units to design deliver and ma in ta in infrastructure and services 
are having a pos i t ive impact. Overarch ing all these improvements were concerted efforts to eliminate 
co r rup t ion in service p rov is ion . The uniform university entrance exam, consolidation of benej2

the targeted soc ia l assistance p rog ram and delegation of

A key Government priority was to improve public sector management. The Government was 
focused on streamlining public services, eliminating those deemed to be unnecessary, privatizing 
services where possible, and strengthening capacity and performance in those that were left. The CPS 
focused on six areas including: (i) addressing corruption and governance in public service; ( i i ) 
improving public expenditure management; (iii) improving Country Financial Management and 
Procurement Systems; (iv) modernizing the judiciary; (v) Strengthening Inter-Governmental Fiscal 
Relations; and (vi) Improving the Management o f the C iv i l Service.

Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations were improved significantly w ith the passage o f the 
Law o f Local Self Government Budgets. The law, wh ich defined f isca l relations be tween the cen ter

predictable. An equalization formu la i s used to determine the amount o f the transfers and the formu la 
i s be ing fine tuned as experience i s gathered. A l o n g w i t h the change in how LGU’s are financed, the 
number o f such units was rationalized, creating a smaller and more manageable number o f such units.

5 1 . 
The new Government chose not to pursue system wide civil service reform, instead 
allowing individual ministries and public agencies considerable latitude to devise personnel 
management systems best suited for their particular operations. As a result many agencies were 

able to restructure, rejuvenate staffing, adjust salary structures and introduce tra in ing programs. This 
approach was accompanied by a significant downs iz ing in Government agencies and the outsourcing 
t o the pr iva te sector o f some ac t iv i t ies inc lud ing power generation (completed) and med ica l services 
(underway). Some restructurings, however, may have l e f t agencies in weaker positions with fewer 
experienced s ta f f and less services, for example in the Ministry o f Agr icu l ture wh ich downsized 
considerably. 

5 2 . 

The CPSCR rates performance under p i l l a r 3 as moderately satisfactory. 
Achievements in

reforms were weaker, though the level of the Bank involvement in this a rea was l im i ted . Nonetheless, 
w i t h suppor t of other donors, j u d i c i a l and legal reform may be ga in ing momentum ra is ing 
expectations tha t the outcomes hoped for 
in Jud i c ia l reform can s t i l l be achieved. The CPS 
an t ic ipa ted a more cen tra l ized approach to c i v i l service reform then the Government eventually 
adopted, nonetheless the Government is now in a better pos i t ion to h i re qualiJied workers and 
ind iv idua l agencies have the leeway to adop t personne l management systems best su i ted to the i r 
circumstances. 

111. World Bank Performance 

5 3 . 

Overall the Bank delivered the CPS program on time, and with high quality operations and 
analytical work. The Bank fielded high quality teams, worked effectively with development partners 
and forged a strong working relationship with the Government. The CPS employed a balanced mix 
o f development policy credits, investment operations, and ana ly t ica l work to deliver an effective 
program o f assistance to reform minded and action oriented Government. 

Lending 

5 4 . 
Implementation of ongoing projects and proactive supervision has contributed to 
achievement o f project objectives in most instances. The portfolio o f projects under 
implementation during the CPS period decreased substantially following the decision o f the 
Government and the Bank to focus assistance on a few key sectors. Mos t o f the 12 projects that 
excited the portfolio during the CPS period exited with satisfactory ratings in the ICRs and by IEG, 
with particularly good performance by projects in transport and municipal development. O f the four 
projects exiting with unsatisfactory rating, Judicial Reform exited at the beginning o f the CPS period 
and suffered from the in i t ia l focus o f Government o f areas o f reform other then the judicial sector. 
The other three projects, integrated coastal zone management (closed in FY06) and forestry 
(cancelled in FY08) and Irrigation (closed in FY09) were a l l approved under the previous 
Government. Despite the best efforts o f Bank staff, differences in opinions on the policy stance and 
institutional arrangements in the rapidly evolving policy environment, were too wide to bridge and as 
a result the projects did not wholly met their development objectives.. I t i s interesting to note, 
however, that after Forestry and Irrigation projects closed the Government’s policy views actually 
evolved to a point closer to the Bank’s view. In both cases the Bank has found ways to stay engaged 
with the Government as i t s policy stance continues to evolve. Overall, ratings for proactivity, and 
realism for Georgia are at 100 percent. Disbursements have been high reaching over 5 2 percent in 
FY08 and 77 percent in FY09. The fast delivery o f the series o f roads projects, which were “shovel 
ready” when approved, was the main driving force behind the high disbursement rates. 

5 5 . 

Delivery of new operations has been timely, and in line with the CPS. The number o f 
operations and total amount committed during the CPS exceeded programmed amounts as the Bank 
and Government were able to take advantage o f Georgia’s increased ID A a l loca t ion from the 
performance based allocation system and i t s transition to LBRD to add projects for Avian Influenza, 
and the East-West corridor, and to provide additional financing for the Secondary and Local Roads 
project. Financing available for the Municipal Development Project (FY09) was also increased over 
CPS estimates. 

56 . 
The PRSO Ser ies was particularly successful in advancing the policy dialogue and the 
Government’s reform program. The improved resource picture available to Georgia during the 
CPS period enabled the addition o f a fourth PRSO operation in FY08 in addition to the th ree 

66 

operations anticipated in the PRSO, and a supplement to PRSO IV also in FY09 in response to the 
events o f August 2008. The PRSO operations focused on four priority reform areas for the 
Government including: Public Sector Management; Energy; Social Sectors; and Private Sector 
Development. These were a l l identified as key areas in the CPS matrix and the availability o f the 
development policy series strengthened the policy dialogue and reform e f for ts . The PRSO ser ies also 
complemented and was complemented by investment lending. The Electricity market support project 
helped to finance metering equipment which was critical to the reforms in the power sector, and the 
health and education projects, along with AAA work on the soc ia l benefit helped achieve reform 
objectives in the soc ia l sectors. Finally, the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support 
Pro jec t complements reforms in the first pillar o f the PRSO. 

Analytical and Advisory Services 

5 7 . 

Analytical and Advisory Services were in line with the CPS and delivered substantial 
results to the Client. Particularly important throughout the CPS period was PHRD Grant support for 
the PRSO program and for the education reforms where the grants continue to support curriculum 
development, teacher training, and testing and assessments. Other advisory support that has been 
successful in supporting PRSO reforms are the Programmatic Public Expenditure work and the 
Programmatic Poverty Assessment, which helped in the development o f the TSA. Complementing 
the programmatic poverty work was a full scale poverty report in FY09 which reported on the basis o f 
a L S M S survey o f over 7000 households. For public sector management, the Bank in partnership 
with the EU completed a Public Financial Management Assessment (PEFA) in FY08 which 
systematically reported on over 50 areas o f public management in x key areas, and which w i l l provide 
the basis for further reform efforts in PFM going forward. A Country Procurement Assessment was 
also undertaken and an action plan agreed with the State Procurement Agency which i s now 
overseeing i t s implementation. Finally, a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) which i s looking 
at factors affecting growth i s under preparation. These core activities were supplemented by sector 
studies including: (i) the financial sector (The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) jointly 
undertaken by the Bank and the IMF; (ii) an Education Policy No te that led to Georgia’s inclusion 
into the Education Fast Track Initiative (FTA; and (iii) an Accounting and Auditing ROSC. Finally, 
the Bank supports Georgia’s Youth Voices Group which implemented a Bank grant in support o f an 
international youth conference on youth issues in con f l ic t affected areas o f ECA and a loca l 
conference on IDP youth issues following the August 2008 events. Overall, the CAE concluded that 
the Bank’s analytic and advisory activities were relevant, o f high quality and well connected with the 
lending program and that the quality o f the policy dialogue was good. 

Work ing with Government 

5 8 . 
The Bank has a close and productive working relationship w ith Government forged on 
the basis of mutual respect, solid and professional teams and largely congruent views on reform 
priorities. The relationship was strengthened by the fact that there was continuity in key teams 
working on macro-economic issues, public sector financing and social sectors that allowed for close 
professional relationships to develop where focused, spirited and substantive policy dialogue could 
take place in an atmosphere o f mutual respect. The relationship benefited as well by the Bank’s 
ability to respond quickly in response to urgent situations, beginning with i t s response to the new 
Government’s accession to power by quickly ramping up assistance and.helping to convene a donor’s 
conference within six months o f the new Government coming to power. The Bank’s ability to 
provide just in time assistance during the floods at the beginning o f the CPS period, later during the 
Avian Influenza outbreak, and most importantly a f ter the events o f 2008 has also helped to solidify 
the working relationship with Government. Finally, the role o f the country o f f i c e with i t s cadre o f 
experienced and skilled s t a f f has contributed to a productive working relationship with Government. 
The recent trend o f moving task management responsibilities to country office s t a f f has improved the 
Bank’s over responsiveness, particularly in day-to-day portfolio management issues. 

67 

5 9 . 

The decision early in the CPS period to begin integrating PrUs in to the implementing 
ministry’s structure has also contributed to better Government ownership o f Bank investment 
operations and greater oversight by the Government o f project implementation. Responsibility for 
project implementation now rests solely with the implementing ministries with consulting support as 
needed only for those functions directly related to Bank requirements for procurement and financial 
management. N o t a l l changes in implementation were advantageous, however. For the irrigation 
project the decision to move responsibility for irrigation works to the Municipal Development Fund 
assured adequate supervision o f the c iv i l works contracts, but i t reduced the involvement o f Ministry 
o f Agriculture in project management and weakened the focus on maintenance and sustainability 
issues. 

Work ing with Other Partners 

60. 
Donor support fo r Georgia following the Rose Revolution has been substantial, 
sustained and reasonably well coordinated. The donor’s conference in June 2004, six months after 
the new Government took power, pledged $1.1 billion in support for the period 2004 -2006. Actual 
donor support exceeded this amount, totaling about $1.6 billion, as a result o f higher commitments by 
the US through the MCC compact, by the EC through Georgia’s participation in the European 
Neighborhood Program and from ID A due to Georgia’s strong performance. Bilateral assistance, 
notably from Germany, Japan and the Netherlands also was higher then pledged. 

61. 
International support for Georgia was reaffirmed following the August 2008 crisis. A Joint 
needs assessment co-managed by the Bank and the UN with participation o f other key donors 
including the EC, IFC, EBRD and ADB and working closely with Government parties was completed 
within weeks o f the end o f the conflict, enabling the Bank and EC to convene a donor’s conference in 
October. The resulting pledges o f $4.5 billion exceeded expectations and a recent assessment shows 
good progress in realizing donor pledges. 

62. 
The donors coordinate among themselves through a donor coordination framework group 
which meets regularly to exchange information on individual programs. The framework group i s 
supplemented by sector coordinating groups in a large number o f sectors. These groups are usually 
donor led though Government participation at the sector level i s routine. Since the JNA, the 
Government has further strengthened i t s ro le in leading the donor coordination e f for t , with the 
Minister o f Finance responsible for chairing periodic donor meetings to review progress in 
implementing programs identified in the JNA, and overseeing the operation o f key sub-sector groups 
dealing with transport, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and the financial sector. 

63. 
The Bank also coordinates with key donor partners on individual operations. Several projects 
during the CPS had direct or parallel co-financing. The Public Sector Financial Management Reform 
Support project (PSFMRSP) involves a unique pooled funding arrangement with funding from IDA, 
DFLD, SIDA, the EC and the Netherlands. The PRSO program was co-financed by the Netherlands, 
and the EC provided parallel financing in support o f complementary reforms. The education projects 
have benefited from PHRD funding for c r i t ica l technical assistance, and the Rural Development 
project i s receiving similar PHRD funding as well as parallel financing from IFAD. Finally, LFC 
advisory services have received critical support from Canada, British Petroleum and partners under 
the Regional Development Program and the International School o f Economics at Tbilisi State 
University (ISET) was established with f inanc ia l support from the Bank, British Petroleum, SIDA 
and Norway. 

68 

Management of Risks 

64. 
The identification o f risks unfortunately proved to be prophetic, with regional conflict 
and the external economic c r i s i s combining as twin shocks to the economy affecting both 
growth prospects and poverty levels in the last 10 months o f the CPS period. The donor response 
to the August c r is is , the Government’s strong record o f macro-economic management, and the solid 
base of reform provide a good basis for Georgia to withstand these shocks and return to a solid 
growth stance once the international economic c r i s i s eases, Two caveats are needed however. 
Donors w i l l need to work to fu l f i l l their entire pledge amounts both in quantity and timing and i f 
possible increase assistance in support o f Georgia’s recovery efforts. Second, efforts are needed to 
ease tensions between Government and some opposition parties, which i f left to fester could keep 
investor confidence from improving and stymie quick recovery. 

Rating Bank Performance: Satisfactory 

65. 

The CASCR rates Bankperformance as satisfactory. Overall, the CPS was well-aligned w i th 
Government p r io r i t ies and represented a welcome narrow ing of 
the Bank Group ’s focus. The CPS 
included an appropriate balance between the series of annual po l icy based credits and related 
investment operations, and analytical work , pa r t icu la r ly the programmatic poverty and economic 
wo rk wh ich was key in supporting on-going reforms. Seasoned and professional teams supported by 
a strong country office offered continuity and professionalism that cemented a close work ing 
relationship w i th the Government. The CPS proved to be f lex ib le in adapting to changing pr ior i t ies , 
sh@s in reform stance, and emerging crises. The assistance program was able to expand to 
accommodate the extra resources that became available to Georg ia because of 
its strong reform 
performance, and the Bank was able to respond quickly both to the changing resource p ic ture and the 
challenges that arose dur ing the CPS per iod . Of pa r t icu la r note was the quick response of 
the Bank 
and development partners to the August 2008 events in work ing w i th the Government to produce a 
comprehensive j o i n t needs assessment, and convene the Brussels Donor ’s conference that delivered 
badly needed assistance at a time when Georg ia was ree l ing f iom the effects of conflict and emerging 
wo r ld economic crisis. The CPS was marked by innovation as we l l including the unique poo l ing 
arrangement for the PSFMRSP, the service agreement w i th MCC , and restructuring of 
the health 
pro jec t to accommodate the major sh i f t in health care reform. There were some setbacks as we l l . 
Several operations fa i led to have the expected development impact mostly due to po l icy diferences 
between the Government and the Bank that were too wide to bridge. But even in the case of forestry 
and i r r iga t ion constructive dialogue w i th the Government o n h t u r e po l icy directions has continued.. 

IV. Lessons and Recommendations 

66. 
Selectivity - Prior to the CPS, the Bank had built a diverse portfolio o f small projects in 
numerous sectors. In preparation for the CPS, Bank Management had grown concerned about the 
fragmented portfolio and wanted to explore with Government options for making i t more focused. 
This view was shared in the CAE which noted the Bank’s “enthusiastic foray in to many sectors at 
once” in the period 1998 - 2003 that “stretched the scarce I D A envelope, weakening interventions in 
important areas”. I n early discussions i t was quickly apparent that the new Government had the same 
view. I t was agreed that new operations and analytical work would concentrate on a few sectors. As 
a result as older project closed, the number o f operations and the sectors where the Banks was 
involved were reduced considerably. The success in making Bank Group assistance more selective 
was largely due to the Government being on exactly the same page about the importance o f focus and 
depth. 

67. 
Balance among instruments -The balance between quick disbursing and investment lending 
worked very well. The PRSO series was used to elevate key policy/institutional decisions and the 

69 

investment operations assisted in defining the issues and implementing solutions. There i s a caveat 
however. These complementarities were possible partly because the Bank had a diversified portfolio 
for much o f the CPS period and this meant the Bank had expertise and in-depth knowledge o f a 
number o f sectoral issueshstitutions. Projecting forward, this could be more difficult i f the Bank 
reduces i t s activities to a more narrow set o f areas. 

6 8 . 
Implementation arrangements - Another area o f early convergence o f views between the 
Bank and the new Government was the desire to move from projects led by autonomous project 
implementation units to ones in which the beneficiary Government entity was very much in charge, 
with only limited project specific staffing, mainly to handle fiduciary tasks. In Georgia this approach 
works well, because the Government recognizes the importance o f ownership and control o f the 
implementation process and i s ready to take on this responsibility. 
Programmatic support - The programmatic approach worked well, not only with the PRSO 
series, but also with the AAA program where the focus was on keeping i t light in terms o f big formal 
reports, but making i t replete with lo ts o f just-in-time technical advisory help on a wide range o f 
issues. 

6 9 . 

70. 

Agility vs. Speed -The new Government se t ambitious targets for i t s e l f both in the scope o f 
its reforms and the timeframe for their implementation. The Bank was successful in calibrating i t s 
support to the Government’s ambitious timeframe in many instances while at other times insisting on 
taking more time where i t was essential for a successful outcome. The Bank moved v e r y quickly with 
a lo t o f interventions, particularly the PRSO series, and the various roads projects, not to mention the 
additional financing for irrigation to repair flood damage in 2005, and the accelerated processing o f 
the municipal development project in 2008 in response to the August conflict. At the same time, the 
Bank, very selectively, insisted on more time when more groundwork was essen t ia l . Examples 
include the privatization o f electricity distribution and the introduction o f the targeted soc ia l 
assistance. Finally, a t times views on policy directions were just too wide to bridge in the context o f 
investment operations and the best approach was to disengage. 
Staffing -- Bringing in new s t a f f to the team i s very important as i t brings renewed vitality 
71. 
and fresh perspectives to issues. But, continuity o f staff in key areas (country economist, sector 
TTLs, IFC staff, and much o f the country o f f ice ) provided the in-depth knowledge o f the country and 
sector issues that was essential for the success o f the program. Finding the right balance between 
rejuvenation and continuity w i l l be a challenge going forward. 

72. 
Decentralizing project management to country o f f i ce s t a f f can fac i l i ta te problem solving 
and speed implementation. Even where task management has stayed with headquarters staff, 
enhanced roles for loca l staff in day to day administration has yielded positive results. 

73 . 

Partnerships with other donors leveraged our resources, led to more effective project 
interventions and made the policy dialogue more coherent and effective. Partnerships in Georgia 
have been particularly innovative, including a service agreement between MCC and the Bank 
whereby the Bank for a fee supervises MCC investments in infrastructure. Also a pooled funding 
arrangement between four donors fo r the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support 
Project has resulted in a coordinated approach to reforms and simplified arrangements for 
procurement and disbursement. Bank quick disbursing operations were cofinanced by one bilateral 
donor, and were coordinated with other providers o f budget support and the PEFA exercise was 
carried out jointly by the Bank and the EC. Finally, strong partnerships across the donor community 
and with the Government were critical in the quick completion o f the Joint Needs Assessment 
following the August 2008 crisis and for the timely convening o f the Donors conference in October 
2008. 

70 

74. 
Repeater Projects. 
Repeat operations or additional financing in roads and municipal 
development over the years have built extensive implementation capacity in the respective 
implementing agencies. I t also eased project preparation and assured quick s t a r t up o f follow-on 
investments as much o f the preparation was done under the preceding operation.

Annex 3: Consultations on the CPS 

Consultations with the c iv i l society representatives, including NGOs, academia, think-tanks, 
private/banking sector representatives and the media were held in late May 2009 . A series o f 
presentations o f the proposed Country Partnership Strategy were made to various audiences in order 
to gain feedback and comments. 

OVERALL COMMENTS: 

9 There was widespread agreement with the assessment o f the difficult economic situation in 
Georgia, related to the August conflict, the global downturn and the tense domestic situation a l l 
o f which had undermined investor confidence and growth. There was also support for the two- 
pillar approach proposed by the Bank to address both the immediate vulnerability needs as well 
as long term competitiveness. 
9 There was strong appreciation for including governance as a cross-cutting theme in the 
forthcoming strategy by a l l groups o f stakeholders. Georgia has made progress in reducing 
corruption and liberalizing the economy and there i s a need for checks and balances and adequate 
regulation. Other priorities relate to the increased communication and dialogue, sanctity o f 
property rights, and the independence o f the judiciary. 
9 The World Bank and other donors should carefully monitor their assistance to Georgia, and 
condition this (for example on better transparency and disclosure, strong monitoring and 
evaluation system in place). The World Bank approach i s particularly important, as one o f the 
most reputable international organizations. World Bank fiduciary controls are helpful. The 
World Bank should also strengthen its communications and dialogue outside the Government. 

SECTOR-SPECIFIC COMMENTS : 

9 Transport Infrastructure: Participants agreed on the priority o f transportation for Georgia’s 
development. However, such issues as monitoring the quality o f the roads and road safety need 
to be carefully addressed. With regard to road safety, there are EU standards that could be applied 
to Georgia as well. 
9 Energy and Environment: There was wide agreement that the Government had made strong 
gains in providing reliable energy supply. Promoting energy-efficiency programs i s o f utmost 
importance to the country. 
9 Rural Development: There was strong support for doing more in this area as exports and 
agriculture production had not increased as fast as imports. 50% o f labor i s in agriculture so i t i s 
an important sector. The need to increase the scale o f farms, to strengthen marketing, and 
improve infrastructure including storage for vegetables were all mentioned. 
9 Health/Social: Tremendous importance i s attributed to health management improvement. A t the 
same time, more professional training for s t a f f and communication o f benefits and modalities 
with the public i s needed. While higher pensions did help reduce poverty, more targeted funding 
through the TSA would be more efficient. 
l+ Education: Education reform i s a top story in the country. In spite o f many innovations in basic 
education, there were continuing needs including appropriate teaching manuals at secondary 
schools, access to In terne t , and improved quality o f teaching. Although I n t e r n e t access has been 
improving, now there i s a need to strengthen and improve the content. Higher education 
management in Georgia requires further sustained improvements and quality upgrades. 

74 

> Annual Poverty Assessment: Participants were surprised at the level o f poverty noted in the 
CPS - 23.7% - which was different from that measured by the Statistics Agency. The Bank 
shared the Poverty Assessment with participants who acknowledged it as a very useful report. 
9 Private Sector: There was recognition that the Government had become much more business 
friendly. Moreover, the global economy and the domestic political tensions were undermining 
investor confidence. Government in te r fe rence with businesses in the areas o f tax and judiciary, 
and possible targeting o f certain businesses based on politics, were mentioned as a concern. A 
concern was raised about monopolies in certain fields (like pharmaceuticals) and the need to 
support small and medium enterprises. Some participants expressed concern that Private-Public 
Partnerships (PPTs) could reduce public accountability. 
9 Financial Management: 
There was strong support for the Bank continuing i t s efforts to 
benchmark and report on progress in public f inanc ia l management and procurement. There was 
also a need to strengthen transparency in corporate accounting. 
> Trade and Investment: There was a concern that Georgia not become overly reliant on foreign 
aid and investment, and that the Government needed to support loca l business growth with local 
management. There was also a need to strengthen trade systems and information on Georgia to 
facilitate trade and investment. 
> Construction sector: The situation was serious with a 40% o f labor fo rce reduction (including 
professional staff), and active sa les coming to a halt. A t the same, earlier investment was too 
focused on purchasing assets rather than creating jobs and productivity. There was a clear need 
for renovation (80% o f structures in need o f renovation) 
> Banking Sector: There were concerns on the level o f interest rates, now up to 20%. This can be 
explained because banks have to pay high rates o f about 12% on deposits. There was a need to 
strengthen confidence in deposits and improve domestic capital markets. Other concerns included 
i) lack o f credit; ii) lack o f liquidity; iii) fear o f non-performing loans.
